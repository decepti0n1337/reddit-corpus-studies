if i see a comment with that many downvotes i really can't help it

Thank you !!
---
Oh shit i got it mixed hahah. But yea I‚Äôm a high gold, and i promise you, i‚Äôve played 15 matches in 2 days and 11 of them had at least 1 mouse and key player. 3 matches had an entire MnK team, and 6 of them had 2 players, and 2 of them had 1. I promise u gold 1 and 2 is filled with MnK. Even in gold 3 and 4 I‚Äôm facing fucking mouse and key players. Literally the last match i played like 30 minutes ago had an entire spawnpeeking MnK 5 stack with pro league skins who 4-0‚Äôd my entire team

And a good way to counter anything similar to the IQ bug where she‚Äôs half in the floor is get atop something (apparently this keeps her from harming you)
---
Well he knows what head he really thinks with I guess
---
It‚Äôs kinda funny though
---
Some militaries use tactical ladders today, so it could easily be retracted and placed on the attackers back
---
It's not even much better is casual. You can be on a team with one or two guys over 50 and the other team is ALL over a hundred.
---
I miss IQ.... shes actually useful and not just situational like clash.
---
It's amusing that you assume I'm a woman, and then automatically start mansplaining to me.

Random 20 inch objects aren't the same thing as windows. Random 20inch objects aren't your only way, with the exception of doors, of entering a room. Don't make such stupid arguments.

If you got into a game when you opened it then after the game finishes you be shown wat you got on the alpha pack.

Defender side should be electrified or some shit

The no vaulting from inside mechanic could also come back to bite you later. Like if it‚Äôs a risky thing to vault into the room or it‚Äôs the only way out, you‚Äôd have to completely commit to the room you vault into then, and it would cut off your escape then.

Probably three months. Right before new season
---
Played it when it was introduced! It acted like a headshot and showed a picture of a squirrel. Them were the days.
---
Thanks! Most of my squad play useful ops such as Hibana, Thatcher, etc. so I usually play Zofia, who is useful, but I think Montagne will really help our squad especially in ranked.

The hostage won‚Äôt stand a chance with these upgrades

Ah yes, because level and rank matter in relation a charm's rarity

Eh, I normally rely on my teammates for that

Wouldn‚Äôt this cause an issue in a bomb plant or hostage situation. Image getting up to a window, grabbing a hostage, and not being able to get out said window.

Tactical ladder
---
Nice, I almost chose IQ and Nokk myself.
---
Blitz was coming for dat ass, only thing worse than that is turning a corner and staring right at the barrel of Cav‚Äôs Luison
---
Say that to defenders about Metal baricade reinforcement
---
Been like this every single season. 1st week is season pass owner getting access to new operators, 2nd week is non-season pass owner getting access to new operators, 3rd week is when they sell these Pro League set.
---
However, they changed the weekly challenges from Tuesday to Thursday, so I'm not sure if this will be affected. Also, starting from Nomad, Kaid, they don't have the operation season flag anymore, they are supposed to have Australian season flag. This is the same for Mozzie, Gridlock which both are still having Australian flag when they are supposed to have Phantom Sight season flag but there is no new map being added in Phantom Sight season, so Mozzie, Gridlock, Ash, Rook won't have flag.
---
Imagine playing hostage
---
Usually at the beginning of every season
---
Bruhh I‚Äôm not bout to check the whole sub
---
Also as per my original comment about it being vulnerable to run outs, I mean more of a defender running out from first floor and catching you while you‚Äôre on the ladder, not vaulting out at you. But I still love this idea and wish we could see it in game one day.
---
They're both really good with organised teams, but I'd say the iq ban is worse because echo and lesion
---
Pc already got the IQ 2d model patch. Console will get it this week. 
---
On PC ubisoft can push updates a lot faster than console platforms due to how the verification for updates work on console.
---
Shit wasn‚Äôt there just one I‚Äôve been waiting to play forever
---
Is that a real bayonet or just a prop? If it‚Äôs real let me know where you got it from!
---
Ok damn been waiting to play forever
---
How do you know they're mnk? I was accused of being mnk yet I'm not. People are generally getting good at the game and just aiming better.
---
Can never be too damn safe

there‚Äôs a discord server for rainbow and a bunch of chat channels you can jump into for different ranks and if you just wanna queue up with 4 people for casual

If you consider the behavior of those players inappropriate, consider filing a report to [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/SignIn?nextUrl=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.ubi.com%2fru-RU%2fCases%2fNew).

Or just no ladder at all. Make it one of those machine rappel things, forgot what they are called. That you can quickly zip up to a window or roof without having to walk all the way through and as a nice touch let him/her be able to rappel up hatches so it can be just as usefull inside.
---
Console
---
Hard work, outta doors
---
They did lol
---
Holy hell that pisses me off when I get pinned against that, I‚Äôm over here at silver one against low plat, high gold, as tho Ubi is just saying fu
---
Just remove her barb wire and give her impacts or a bullet-proof camera
---
You said this to a supposed lesion main at that.
---
yea, they really need to get a better matchmaking system for this
---
Half-smirk makes it, evil looking lol
---
Im currently working on one of those longer "operator idea" posts you usually see on here with the fancy infographic, but I wanted to get some opinions on the icons I made in paint.net
---
No. It‚Äôs been like that for a while.
---
IMO I think it should be similar to blackbeard's shield. Or somewhere between mira and blackbeard, but regardless, defenders should be able to take out the mirror and not the whole ladder system.
---
I know King George does, I actually run a stat tracker (siegestats.com) and track King Georges main account. And a few other big streamers on thier mains and Smurfs. 
---
I don't mind big names having Smurfs cause they need anonimity every once and while. 
---
I don't mind how you do your Smurf. But I do think it's being dishonest mainly with yourself. I'm a stats freak I love them hence building a site to track siege matchs. I feel you can use stats to improve your game and find your weakness's. I've looked at my numbers when playing with various squad mates, and there are definitely some we win with more then others. And that informs me which combination of our players will make our best ranked squad. Actually working on some code to automate that. But I only play on one account, and can not bring myself to making a Smurf
---
Bro u can literally tell the difference between good controller aim and good PC aim. There gets to be a point where it isn‚Äôt just ppl playing on high sensitivity or who have really good reaction times, you can literally see what an MnK player looks like. Incredibly agressive lean and crouch spam, ungodlike quickness when snapping on to a target, you can just tell. I can admit when i get outskilled cuz im not even the best player in my friend group but the way these kids play is indicative of MnK.
---
that‚Äôs another problem i can‚Äôt talk on discord it won‚Äôt work it‚Äôs wack
---
May I restate this, "So ubi, when are you gonna fix the whole game?"
---
It's horrible

So does this work for windows that aren‚Äôt breakable and ones that are?
---
&gt;And what? Why can‚Äôt I solo que? You‚Äôre telling me i can‚Äôt play this game if none of my friends are online? Lmao okay dude
---
I said you "shouldn't". Not "cannot" or "simply cannot". But in a 5v5 coordinated competitive team based tactical shooter where you NEED tip-tip communication and there's always a good chance the other team has that when you are solo queuing with barely any comms, if you take the risk of solo queuing, then you should be aware of the consequences that follow, which is purely the opponent overpowering you.

I've been TKed my share of times. What I dont have patience for is the whiney children who get TKed a few times and think the solution is to remove team damage. I don't ever troll or grief people, I do however get offensive when I see another person who thinks removing friendly fire damage is an acceptable solution in this game. It demonstrates that you clearly do not understand what this game is about and what it's trying to be.
---
Awesome play
---
Haha I am honored to receive your up vote
---
I agree sometimes the newcomers would be scared of nokk or being nokk and nokk can hear foot prints and its usually hard but I recommend at least all 2 speeds and a hero where if you die you have a 50% chance of being warden and 2 other recruits  but thats ok very much great idea and add head gears too

it's kinda hard to counter; if they have god aim you're pretty much screwed. i'd say just find some cover asap and wait it out

Who are you to say how many times I've been TKed? I have over 700 hours and have been pestered more than "a few times". It happens frequently enough that I see that it should be removed or replaced with a better system. Of course there's always idiots like you who are oblivious to everything, but I am trying to change the game for the better. I understand this game's quest for "tactical realism" but there's a point where if realism is ruining the game's experience then it needs to be changed. Quit being such a dunce and accept that there's an issue here.
---
So your point is because I use video game sub Reddit‚Äôs I have no life? Reddit isn‚Äôt real life dumbass. Even then wouldn‚Äôt you be the person with no life because your in multiple reddit communities talking to multiple people on the internet.

Me and my buddy that met during season 1 met in real life a year ago and now he moved from Arizona to Idaho and currently lives with me. Crazy how the game brought people together

Mavs AR does shit for damage though. It takes twice as long to kill.
---
I thought about an Attack op that reinforces a wall but it grants a 1 way mirror inside of it. (it would have some weakness like mira). 
---
Attackers would trade sight lines / ways into objective for OP information. You'd also be vulnerable when reinforcing.

I think he holds enough power to simply bring a turret into existence whenever he needs it and make it stop existing when he no longer needs it. No need to store it elsewhere.
---
All the 20 standard operators weapons, and also Frost and Buck
---
Some wear fooking lazer sights.
---
Grenades, C4, smonk, run out from below and put a cap in him, so not really
---
The problem is that most of the times someone from defender follow it and kill it before you have a chance to do that.
---
Otherwise I can confirm this is working sometimes or if time is out just quickly back to it, it will mark it.
---
I‚Äôve been drinking rum yes
---
I feel personally attacked by this relatable content
---
Your attempt at a joke?
---
I have N√∏kk to protect me now
---
Ubisoft brought back the progression system they originally had for the 20 original operators supposedly because new players were getting overwhelmed with all the different choices.
---
Play rook defense and sledge on attack until you get the basics of the game down
---
I got the game in February, I had to buy all of the operators. I only had recruit otherwise
---
There's an entire map for a reason. As a wise man once said
---
You are a dude with a gun, assaultung a building filled with other dudes with guns. Take the game for what it is. Anything goes.
---
True especially on console
---
You can surrender after 2 rounds. Wtf are you talking about.
---
One time I loaded in late to a game and I was greeted with "I hope you can exceed your predecessor"
---
I asked "what do I have to live up to?"
---
"Glaz didn't clutch"
---
I vote yes
---
Got in my way
---
Xbox
---
Have you ever played CoD?  They use a curved mapping, R6 uses a linear one. 
---
Linear: 1% joystick =&gt; 1 pixel, 100% joystick =&gt; 100 pixels
---
Curved (example): 1% joystick =&gt; .5 pixel, 100% joystick 1000 pixels
---
Basically, you can get precise aim on small adjustments while still being able to do large rotations quickly.
---
That's fucking stupid
---
"YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL!!!"

Dont always run vert grip, i usually go for angled if i can since it lets me ads quicker and the recoil is nonexistant anyways
---
Yes.
---
Lolol my exact thoughts.
---
I'm feeling it on PC. No idea what they did though
---
Probably would break the barricade
---
None in actuality. You need to get them specifically for each of the other guns.

*Woman's best garment*
---
I haven't experienced any yet. 450 hrs.
---
Not really. It still has the same problem. You can win 6 defense, and then you only have to win 1 attack.
---
üëÄ
---
He‚Äôs right. If he could pick up the drones then he can THROW them into ridiculous spots throughout the map. I think the best you can do is put the drones near where you get them at. 
---
It‚Äôs really not that hard
---
Claymores plus a Glaz or a DMR or a teammate with good aim and recoil control over long distance for windows or maps where the defenders can't hit you such as the balcony with the window and two soft walls on Hereford.
---
The game should really detect if a player is moving around the map like that and at least FLAG their account for investigation
---
That's even worse than rappelling, if you're talking about a ladder that means you won't be able to shoot as you climb into the window, easiest defender kill in their whole career
---
Not me. I can't surrender until the forth round for some reason. I check every round prior to Round 4 and it's locked for me
---
I struggled a lot at the beginning but I'm getting way better months after starting to play.. Don't worry skill will come lol. Had so many friends give up on the game just after a few weeks because they couldn't get a kill
---
It‚Äôs a fan idea.
---
Not even that. It's that you HAVE to win the first one. There's no room for error, or adaption. Sometimes a fluke round will ruin it for you. This is bad logic.
---
&gt;put them down like a mute jammer
---
Personally don‚Äôt see something like this working in Siege. 
---
Also, don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but you seriously need to work on overlapping action and smoothing out your keyframes bro. Yikes.
---
Hatches headass
---
i can‚Äôt hate on it

Hes pretty fun, for me 3 speeds are harder to work with due to lack of armor compared to my most played defenders but his gadget has netted me a good few shotgun kills

look, you put enough bullets downrange you're gonna hit something eventually.
---
I‚Äôm playing a ranked right now but if you want to play some casual I help you out what are the game is over my gamer tag is my username so invite me to a party if you want

Is this a meme or an actual concept
---
Well some windows you can't vault out from.
---
I've been away for a few months what in the actual f is going on with this game lol
---
kaid has 2 claws, which usually reach 2 each, so 4. bandit has 4 car batteries, so 4. but what makes kaids ability better is he can throw it out of reach and it is smaller, while bandit car batteries are just right there. and also different weapons
---
Thanks I thought I was the only person.

Just like have friends lol.
---
Because pc had the patch to fix iq glitch but for consoles it hasn‚Äôt been released yet

As a lesion, more spots for the GU mine. üòâ
---
you shouldn't worry at all unless you're a diamond player, which is like less than 5% of the community, although they still do cheat in gold/plat and even casual, but still not many, probably also because I don't play east coast where i'm sure has more.
---
That makes more sense now, Thank you!
---
That's one thing i sometimes miss on console, 10 year old children talking shit.
---
Good thing it‚Äôs free
---
I really do wish they added back casual mmr. Because I kind of despise getting a team of 4 newbies against a full diamond squad
---
Whe gon' talk about the reverse friendly fire tho üëÄ
---
No worries. For example, my k/D went from 0, 18 to 0,51 that's still shit but that's cause I need to catch up with all the deaths I got. (hardly does negative kd in my games now)
---
MacieJay did that once, i think you can find his clip on youtube or like any of  the fanmade clip compilation
---
That‚Äôs really cool!
---
I would rather not have cross-play between systems. PS4 has an officially licensed mouse and keyboard type setup for their system where as XB1 doesn't. Sure, there are ways to do mouse and keyboard on XB1 (XIM or Chronus Max) but its not officially licensed and its even possible to be banned for using such a device. If they do add it, at least give us the option to disable it.
---
I like that but make the first motion ping then in intervals of 2 or 3 seconds if there us movement. But if they stop it will stop updating the ping. Also if it a interval ping it could maybe a larger area.
---
shotgun rush and spam flashbangs super fun, only works for a few games

If you really "code in multiple languages" you should do some basic research on how simple VPNs and hardware mac spoofing is and how Majority of the worlds ISPs use dynamic IP addressing so IP bans dont work.

Even a 10 year old script kiddie can use google. Non of these suggested ideas will make it any harder for hackers to get back into the game.

Not the healing bullet wounds within a few seconds and recovering health after a friend pats you down?

Not the operator with a portable ADS system that deactivates nades mid air ?

A female operator in a VR simulator for CTU training is where you draw the This is absurd line?

Its more likely that your average roamer doesnt know how to deal with him

&gt; -Shut up, it's a fictional game with fictional tech and woman in CT is the least unrealistic of all of it.

The tech in this game is also dumb. But women are 1% of CTUs in real life but 40% of the game. It‚Äôs pandering

imagine being this mad some one said find 5 other player, dude didnt even say have friends man literally just suggested you be social, no wonder you struggle at teamwork and finding people to play with that attitude

And it will bring us ddosers so, both sides agree that no crossplay between console and pc is needed
---
u gotta take the M870

You probably play like a plat, but are a friend like a copper

Why does it matter? Do you hate women so much that you can't stand to play them in a video game? It's not like you can't play a male character - so what's your problem?

Also if you're not a fan of the game, then gtfo of the game's subreddit. Go play fortnite or whatever other game you prefer
---
Well just like a hr ago i went aginst a team of lvl 250+ that were a full diamond sweaty team, and my team was unranked and retarded
---
Then why put Tom Clancy‚Äôs name on it? He would hate it.
---
Glaz rework. The bars deplete if he moves so enemies don‚Äôt appear yellow. When he stays still the bars fill so enemies appear yellow again
---
This is pathetic. Even I can't play 1 game without being teamkilled.

Bunch of dapper bois

Her LMG is a blast too

I ended up getting blackbeard at the end for the 4k, but hit alt-F4 instead of f3 for the screen cap, and my alt-f4 disabler was off. RIP me
---
R6S multiplayer is a training simulator by the lore. 
---
If even the vanila operators are too advance for you techwise maybe go back to the older games or other games like insurgency or arma, R6S is a tactical shooter not a realistic shooter.
---
Try different keybinds to see if they work. There might be an issue with the ones you chose. I remember there were some things that just weren't compatible with the buttons I chose when I originally did mine for whatever reason.
---
DDOS‚Äôed, Monty and gridlock traps all in one. Yeah I‚Äôll stay in Minecraft then.
---
My kd in life is .2
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of shooters. And no I don‚Äôt hate women obviously. I‚Äôm just tired of pandering which is what they are clearly doing. (Same with COD and battlefield)
---
Please Elaborate
---
Exactly. I'd much rather see a ban on someone thats part of a common strat than someone who's 'annoying'
---
*MGS Alert noise*
---
Surprise, mother fucker!
---
Ikr?
---
Damn. Yall attractive. After playing with someone for a year or so I met them and they were *heavy*
---
Nice
---
It would be painful to apply in game, If you can't vault out as a defender, then you can't vault in as an attacker. So it's not a ladder, it's a window blocker. And that actually could be useful.
---
Well played
---
It was bugged so Ubisoft disabled it until they can fix it
---
Just use cat as mouse
---
The Xim also mimics a controller hence why it can be used on Siege without issue.
---
The only thing you said that has any basis is how dumb alpha packs are. Everything else comes from you not knowing the meta of game!! ( btw only a silver would call Cav op )
---
I'm surprised that purple shirt doesn't have 2 holes in it.
---
Hahaha this looks so much like a couple photo, garden of flowers and brightly colours shirts and all
---
Don‚Äôt tell me what to do
---
I‚Äôd keep the flashes.
---
I like the double barreled shotgun idea but I don‚Äôt think they can outright give his elite a different gun. What if the gun was purely cosmetic instead like Lions second pistol?
---
All 4 steps you described are nerfs. Where is the rework
---
Who would win
---
1 FNG

Or 4 Highly trained Operators with unreal gadgets
---
Alternate title: How to get c4'ed, in style.
---
That's an interesting take on it. I do feel like blocking windows helps defenders more than the attackers most of the time.
---
Alright little guy, chill. Seems like this bothered you way too much. You seem really frustrated on the internet right now. But what do i expert on the fucking siege subreddit?? lol
---
Just impatient
---
Great concept man! Would love to see this in game!
---
Bro copper to diamond

I that a KWC/Cybergun automatic Deagle?

how do you not look at that and instantly nut

Jackal and Rook, is that you?
---
I'm scared please go away i don't feel safe here.
---
Right, but since it's not officially licensed, you can technically be banned for using it. Granted, I don't think Ubi has banned anyone for using that. I know on Xbox, its possible to detect hardware like the XIM but I'm unsure if thats possible on PS4.
---
Thank you. Do you know how long it will take for it to get fixed?
---
He is testing you too see if your worthy.
---
If you wake him too many times he will give you bad luck, if you let him sleep and be happy he will give all the wallbangs.
---
Let them have their fun, it's one picture. Wont hurt you.
---
Why does the Ash remind me of South Park?
---
Remember when all we had to worry about was hackers with wall hacks and aimbot?  
---
Now I‚Äôm seeing videos of them go at warp speed, clipping through the walls like a ghost and flying in the air like their on a mega trampoline! Just what in the Sam hill‚Äôs are these guys able to find all these new ways to ruin your game? 
---
It is nice to see you make the POS hacker be his own downfall OP.   I can‚Äôt be the only one noticing the uptick in people who do this.
---
You need some Wi-Fi.
---
If you would change any one of those I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be that much less effective, just much less annoying. Is getting tracked by Jackal overpowered? No, but his ability is way too easy to use.
---
Fax. I need better WiFi my guy.
---
So does normal ones as well, just tighter
---
Very nice
---
WhiteMasks: Not bad kid..
---
Any and all of the base ops, try them all, see which one you like, then move to the DLC ops
---
Lucky you have that kind of cat, because my cats are very ignorant while i really want their attention to me (which is sad ofc i know, shut up).
---
Don‚Äôt forget clutching and still getting kicked because somehow that‚Äôs a thing too.
---
Hope you guys are strait
---
I got chills down my back
---
If I can't find the defuser to destroy at the end of the game after getting the last kill in a casual match, (as a new player), should I be kicked?
---
Musta been cold out
---
Ahahahahhahah
---
I think my brain lagged with this gameplay.
---
just have a look at the AMD side of things. their processors are really nice since they launched ryzen back then. with their 7nm Zen2 architecture they release the new Ryzen Lineup which includes a Ryzen 5 3600 for 199$/‚Ç¨ and thats with 6c 12 threads and beats intels competition. their new Graphics cards are also nice but not THAT nice sooo doesnt really matter which company you choose here aslong as you get the best performance for money. AND A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO INVEST IN WHEN PLAYING SIEGE: Get a fugging SSD please. PC loading times are so fugging long without it installed on SSD that most people are going to kick you probably if you are loading in to the match for more than a minute since its always an extra minute waiting every round.
---
Also, what did you report the other time for?
---
I think they may have been hacking
---
Very relatable, it always been jager that steals my cav kill.
---
I use charge on her so it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Then my job is done xd
---
It might feel better for you but iron sights make no difference to the recoil
---
I got a ssd:)
---
Damn that is weak
---
Imagine a BlackBeard using this RIP

Hello Cavelish, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c4j44j/this_is_most_definitely_the_truth/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Holy shit, absolutely in love with the makeup lmao
---
Season 2 on year 2 was op Health. Lesion was Year2Season3
---
honestly id feel better about spending 40 bucks on a season pass if all the bugs are fixed, than getting new content i cant even play
---
Scenery is already in the way of this design
---
But that's a meat cleaver
---
????? If a hacker gets banned you get elo back wym? Do your friends have otism?
---
I played against Emma before it's sad they haven't been banned.
---
We had Operation health in y2s2 with no operator release
---
&gt;https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons.aspx
---
Not if you are above the elo you started. Elo decay will fuck everyone watch
---
Well it‚Äôs a very sharp object. We can both agree on that
---
No,but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs definitely not booting because one I‚Äôve only been playing casual and it happens so frequently it can‚Äôt be booters
---
Ahah I see now. I TOTALLY forgot that was a thing lol. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
Bro reminds me of a time I started shooting at someone and my teammate voted to kick me and started spamming it and no one said yes they all said no so he left the game
---
i halfway support hardware bans, fuck the cheaters, but if someone innocent gets accidentally banned, its not fair
---
I hear the sound of doc/jager mains commiting sudoke one by one
---
The best Cav cosplay. Great job!
---
 Molon labe!
---
Agreed
---
Thank you I forgot about Op health. I thought it was a mistake.
---
He's catching the "mouse"
---
there will always be cheaters in every multiplayer game. it's just a fact of life. it's also impossible to detect _everything_. there will always be some workaround.
---
That sucks man,the game is in a god awful state rn. PC is littered with cheaters,and console has so many mnkers and booters.
---
Pros and streamers make a living playing this game.....
---
That‚Äôs cool, but a bit OP?
---
I got a question how did you get the Frost Main tag?
---
that's why you use NVidia GPUs
---
‚Äúhappens so frequently it can‚Äôt be booters‚Äù

consider yourself blessed friend

He had enough of cavs shit wanted to make sure she was dead

Black dude fucks a Russian man from a glory hole

what gaming socks do you use?

How does one acquire EYEBROWS OF DEATH such as these?

Nah dude that Snowmobile says,"Kill me now"

Socks?
---
I think you can change it on the web client
---
I‚Äôm not a high rank but I‚Äôve heard horror stories lmao

Technically, it's how it is supposed to be due to it's realism, but check this video https://youtu.be/1NTf2A0Y8dM
---
thx XD
---
You somehow look More terryfing than the voodo lady
---
theyre all too true sadly
---
What you talking bout? If you lose to a hacker and he gets banned you get the elo back. What you mean elo decay?
---
True that. Both platforms have it's issues which sucks. Imo they need to just take a break from adding new stuff in. Op health 2 is necessary imo.
---
Instructions unclear, dick is stuck in wood floor
---
?
---
Sorry don‚Äôt know what you mean by socks?
---
Tell that to Ubi it might actually get the game fixed
---
weird flex but ok
---
Wrong
---
I was confused as well
---
Do vigils dad next
---
we need that puppy too
---
I like the idea a lot but this is specific to second stories. If the shield was bigger it would compensate ground attacking. Cool idea with locking the defenders in. Really it should lock everyone in, unless glass is broken like lord T‚Äôs shield. Then open season.
---
All the good maps are in ranked my dude!!
---
Can I get one like this, but for Tachanka
---
Me and my mates always ban Mira cause we none of us use her and don't like versing good Mira's. Then the attacking  ban is always who is most annoying on that specific map.
---
There is no Elo decay
---

---
Because of anonymity and people wanting to be top MLG pros showing off their huge penis.
---
Don't get me wrong, some of the videos showing pros plays and aces are amazing. However, people focus too much on the kills and not setting up angles and objective play. People would rather boost their KD and be top score than win. 
---
Take a break for a few days and come back then.
---
The ammount of responding fuck yous your getting should be enough to tell you your a shit bag don't do this

That‚Äôs purely the most cruel way to die lmaoo.

nice vans

I almost said something inappropriate but realized that this is not the sub for that. You'll have to be content with a good job I guess :D

I can smell the c4 kills from here...... Mmmmmm
---
I don‚Äôt....get it?

That's why we love this game lol, moments like that feel sooo good
---
**What have I become
---
My sweetest friend
---
Everyone I know
---
Goes away in the end**
---
This helped alot... but sadly, the teleporting hacker I went against had a counter-measure for that. He just did a simple teleport to one spot and just ran towards us and killed us. The sad thing is that he's boosting his teammates (I don't know if they are his friends or they paid him to boost them).
---
Nice. Spooky lady is real.
---
No, same happened to me
---
Defenders should get their ACOGs removed all of them
---
Eeeeeew playing games in Dutch, why :(
---
If it's an important window and you hear this being deployed yet do nothing about it that's your fault
---
This seems more like 1080p bro.
---
Just erase the headphones, make the skin yellow and add normal glasses, erase the armor and you got ned flanders ready for church
---
Haha i was saying the vid is 1:20 min my mistake
---
Also, frag grenades.
---
I'm surprised he got injured at all
---
Ayyyyyyy dutch gang
---
Thats why I play Hostage
---
R/nope
---
This is my standard experience with melee in siege.
---
Tbh, it's kind of stupid af that a defender just arbitrarily can't get past an ankle-high obstacle. I'm not a fan of *"UH, JUST BECAUSE!"* rulesets.
---
I main her, here's what's wrong. The shotgun is a standout part of her. It does have a little too much range but it's easy to control recoil and very good fire rate and damage make it what it's supposed to be. A very good QCQ weapon nd mid range at that. Her scorpion is the worst gun in game by far, even statistically doing the 2nd lowest damage, having random horizontal recoil, and a shitty fall off range. Pistol is under average so you got that right. Her secondary gadgets are pretty much useless to her in mostly every sense. Her mines are only lackluster at best.
---
That's a beautiful flair
---
Cool, but useless.  I think a valk cam would be better.  Feel like you are wasting too much utility for an area of the map that sees next to no action as there isn't a bomb site down there.
---
I don't usually dig these fan concepts but man you went above and beyond. This is a very interesting idea, it's not something I ever thought of but being able to enter through a window quickly without warning everyone in the vicinity with your rappelling sound would be a cool mechanic.
---
The sad reality is, the time you spent on making this animation would probably completely blow out the budget and time the Siege dev team has to work on new ops, as seen with their obsessive recycling of game mechanics.
---
We I was making a 4K joke so don‚Äôt stress it
---
welcome to the kool kids klub I guess.
---
When your chillin in skyscraper trying to push geisha but your thermite gets ran out on
---
Wait a sec,
---
is this an actually decent clutch in RANKED by an actually decent player who won due to his gunskill and situational awareness and not just sheer luck and shitty enemies?
---
Haven't seen that in this sub for a long time...
---
I agree he‚Äôs harder to play
---
better representation than the chibi
---
"Balanced" operator
---
Amateurs
---
But how is he going to carry that ?
---
What do you mean this skin is fucking awesome
---
He took the cooking laser sights with him
---
Rather have perspective "issue" than peekers advantage tbh. Just don't peek right next to your cover and take longer angles is how I play.
---
Being a good Montagne player is hard btw, so I wish you good luck.
---
You need an awful amount of patience and play him lots to get the timing down for when to actually unextend your shield. Most players drop their shield way too early and get themselves killed but unfortunately, there is no general tip to that since every situation is different.
---
Fookin, not cookin
---
X to Doubt
---
You had died first that‚Äôs why you had lost that round. If you Lille‚Äôs him first then he killed you. You would have won.
---
Oof I just encountered that bug and thought my headset was breaking lmao
---
Well in my opinion it looks great
---
Seems just about right
---
Now....who's gonna clap who?
---
This right here is what every enemy that runs out on me sees.
---
üòè

Lol, my bird does that too.
---
Double whammy

Would be cool

I mean.. I don't wanna be that guyyyyy - Buuuut if you actually aced you would've won.. sry &lt;3

why

ddos?
---
End of white noise,  I miss when ela's gun was actually good (I only unlocked her mid chimera)  and IQ's frag grenades, I understand why they removed them but giving them to finka was stupid and giving her a claymore was also dumb, she should've been give smokes or flash bangs 
---
I also miss IQ being in the game 
---
I miss para bellum too, that was a smooth season now the game's a fucking mess
---
I'm not saying you can't, I'm asking that you don't give Ubi the opinion to fix something that isn't broke (yet)
---
It's an absolute joke atm, I watch KingGeorge a lot on Twitch and recently he's been playing hackers, teleporting hackers every 3/4 games, he hasn't gotten any ELO back yet which is pathetic cos it means those hackers are still out there not banned.
---
Thankfully I'm on console so all I have to deal with is MnK users and ddos'ing üòä
---
The F2 is no different imo. Both have high vertical so I just run standard Flash hider
---
Only Blitz
---
What exactly do you think an insult will accomplish? Especially over something so little...
---
Like in FORTNITE??? WE LIKE FORTNITE WE LIKE FORTNITE WE LIKE FORTNITE FUCK YOU WHORE
---
I don't think it matters what operator died, this isn't one of them situations where someone gets spawn killed because they weren't paying attention, there's literally nothing you can do there
---
Doc ascending for a split second right before he gets you has me rolling.
---
Nothing
---
M&amp;KB too, that's definitely cheating.
---
But. He‚Äôs. Looking. Through. One. Eye?
---
I‚Äôve always been dedicated to the idea that there is difference between ‚ÄúOverpowered‚Äù and ‚ÄúToo strong‚Äù Lesion is too strong while someone like OG Ela was overpowered.
---
If you want me to elaborate I will but I don‚Äôt want to go too off topic.
---
Ubi themselves have also taken small steps forward to nerfing Lesion. Look at his fucking win/pick rate. I believe he was in the top 5 of winrate and I believe he was the second most picked Defender behind J√§ger.
---
There is no elite in packs, maybe u got legendary? Also if you get in the game as you open packs it will show you after you exit/finish the match.
---
btw There is only one elite in packs and that Ash from outbreak.

Blitz and Clash piss me off. They don't even have to attack me, I just see them, and my day is ruined.
---
[Insert spiderman pointing meme]
---
No
---
It‚Äôs a similar problem to the deployable shield problem, which in a sense, was fixed but they messed it up again so
---
If you stack barbed wire can they destroy all of them in one go?
---
You guys look too physically and mentally healthy to be playing siege lmao
---
The game is competitive, ok that doesnt mean that you are only able to play competitive, i don't play casual as it is to toxic and i dont play ranked bc its sheit, the only thing i play is esl so i know what comp is, but i also get why people dont play like its competitive as you also need to have fun and some players dont like competitive or are just scared of being not good enough, you need to respect that.
---
Then why even do it?
---
Nope. Fun to play as, annoying to play against, but satisfying to kill. Both sides need skills to defeat the other..
---
U look around like: ‚Äúdid anyone else see that?‚Äù
---
Thanks, I made the switch and it‚Äôs been a lot better for me. It‚Äôs much closer to what I‚Äôm used to so it just feels much better
---
It feels good man
---
Completely agree with that, Ela was broke as shit meanwhile Jager is a solid ass operator
---
The point I'm trying to make is Ubi don't know what they're doing anymore, and I don't want a solid defender, such as Lesion, Taken out of the game cause Ubi wants to "fix" him. Especially in ranked since it's bomb only
---
Yeah Ubi.. fix this..i will definetly not use it..suuuure
---
Letting out your anger on people you don't know?
---
I don't usually have troubles dealing with the shields but blizt is really annoying.
---
this is not very common. I haven‚Äôt run into a hacker in minutes.
---
i dont get it, she came from the main door right?
---
then got banned for false reporting g
---
Explain?
---
Sorry was a rhetorical questio. Lots of people starting to call the Devs lazy or retarded etc I think it's just disrespectful and stupid. The Devs know what they are doing it's not like Ubi are hiring hairdressers and penguin erectors to program the game. Just feel people need to lay off a bit.
---
And vaginas too probably lmao I‚Äôd put out with a win rate like that
---
10/10
---
Is he deaf too ?
---
"I will die a thousand deaths before i yield"
---
i didnt get reddit gold tho
---
Nice plays, that was great! I really need to play Valkyrie more because whenever I do I always frag with her. I‚Äôve gotten more 4 pieces with her than any other op despite not player her much, and she‚Äôs one of the only two ops I‚Äôve ever gotten an ace with.
---
Where can you see those stats?
---
Was in a game where the other team was making the server lag, as in rubber band lag, and they waited until like 10 seconds in the round to make it normal again but I rushed and got an ace, most satisfying thing I‚Äôve done, then next round server was fine until they decided to push they all pushed together and I got a second ace. They surrendered the next round and all messaged me say I was DDosing. Even tho I was in a five man
---
What kind of evidence are you looking for?
---
All I can say is that it works like this as I have tried and used it myself
---
Except the teleportation cheat has only appeared during Outbreak due to one of the special zombies (Rooter) having the ability to teleport to players.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cheat makers re-used the code that was left over from Outbreak (and never deleted, god knows why) to make the teleportation cheat, the reason why it uses Vaults to activate it's self is most likely because the zombies (When they teleported to the player) were mid action animation so in place of the zombie animation of rooting the player they use vaults.
---
Look at this screenshot lookin' mfer.
---
1 mil...and what are you gonna do with it?
---
If it‚Äôs the esports one then the lesion penta one. If it‚Äôs the actual pro league sets then either Hibana, Ela or Castle.
---
Pewdiepie is that you?
---
Jesus I can almost imagine a creepy ass shadow of Cav where ever you walk.
---
Well you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm stupid lol
---
&gt; What kind of evidence are you looking for?
---
Something that supports what you're saying.

Does a breach now kill traps, wire, ect?

I'm on 160k now so I'm slowly gonna make it.

Another 840k to go
---
Cheat-Dev here:
---
Teleporting was possible before outbreak. It never had anything to do with it. You were overwriting your network-positions before and were able to teleport this way. They fixed that with a validation which happened during the vault.
---
Now we simply overwrite the vault-destination the game sets once you are able to vault.
---
Please stop spreading false information if you have literally 0 insight on the topic and 0 experience.
---
Definitely looks like a bug. The shield was not visible for both of you, so it might fail in putting it on.
---
Never played capitao I don't get it ;-;
---
yeah obv your enemies have to make several mistakes for someone to be able to clutch, i simply meant that this guy actually had some resemblence of skill whilst 99% of the clutch videos on this sub are just shitty casual clutches by ppl who have no idea what is even happening and basically get their kills gifted.
---
I‚Äôve got a buddy I‚Äôve played siege with for 3 years that has stacked his to 1.5 million. 
---
He refuses to spend a single point.

I would like to see this deployed in the tower

Doc: "Right Bandit, you've had enough training now. Go out and put it into practice"

Are u kidding me!?

Pls say this is fake

Boy it seems chilly out there huh?

Wait is this in ranked or casual?

Problably gonna flex on them haterss

I mean this season and last season have hardly been "fun" with all the glitches and bugs lol

Pulse check
---
Nice! I‚Äôm happy for you! It‚Äôs good to make progress. I started in Grim Sky and am only just seeing my skill level rise. In the past week I got my first ace as well :)

Yes that is legendary. Elites are only for specific operators that have to be paid for.

The only mistake is downing this kill hungry cocksucker.

Probably would‚Äôve had that if you had the commando.
---
Just kinda loafin about, you know. Wassup
---
I've played since Red Crow. Only seen teleport cheats after Outbreak.
---
I guess my bad?
---
I dont think that the elite skin was in the pack. According to my knowledge, it was if you owned the game before outbreak then you got the elite. This was to please current players since if you bought the game during the outbreak event, you were given a bonus of 5 outbreak packs, which were only obtainable with r6 credits
---
Look how Hes depressed

Looks amazing but don't snoop up from behind people they won't like it üôÇ.

I'm jealous. I got a black ice for Glaz's ots-03 the day he got nerfed. And also got one for the m870 and the five seven. Im so happy I got one for the m870. Now I can meme in style.

Hello Pure---, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c4mcud/discord_link/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Depends on the spot he's trying to mine, an example is Oregon Bedroom.
---
If Lesion is sitting on the door way of white stairs and wants to mine the corridor window of site (The one infront of master bedroom bunks inbetween kids and bridge) he needs to expose himself either to the Main Window or the corridor window + doorway by vaulting over the bunk wall.
---
So you admit that GU mines are not that hard to take out then, obviously if you're smart you won't throw it directly in their face but then again isn't that a weakness? He can't be aggressive with them as once seen they are effectively void.
---
ok.
---
Better not, I love clash
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Well done!
---
Gay as fuck.
---
# give j√§ger back his acog!
---
Because coding is fun, having a challenge is fun (bypassing BE).
---
I complain about certain things because it's actually just sad that ubi does care that little about it.
---
Like why am I able to vault 60m at once? Why am I able to plant the defuser in prep-phase? Why can I modify the amount of bullets coming out of my gun at once and the server registers it? Why can I kill defenders in prep-phase as an attacker?
---
The possibilities are a joke at this point. So little is server-sided/checked.
---
XBOX mƒ± PC mi?
---
All of these operators are *balanced*, people are just whiny.
---
FINISH HER
---
You are very correct and if we tell them this problem exists it will get fixed but right now they do not know
---
Nope. Never
---
Also they reset at some point. I had the 100 wins and 100 penetration kills on thunt left for the plat. Altho if yiu looked at my stats I had done both. Apparently there was a reset in the stats a few seasons back that made them even harder to get! So thankful I now have my shiny plat, considering how much I've played the game haha
---
Dont take my Alda ACOG
---
Years of training can't help you against a grenade launcher, mr. Warden.
---
IQ: 3000
---
H9nestly all you can do is watch streams of good players and keep practising.
---
Maybe some small changes you could make to give a little boost to skill like lowering your sens or learning some new spawnpeeks.
---
This is not how this works... just saying... i mean you dont look into an acog with, both eyes do you? you can take the blanket off... as long as youre looking through an acog
---
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
I've already seen this before
---
Very nice!  
---
Did she make the grzmot mine by herself?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEpost
---
I‚Äôd use either the compensator or the flash hider, with the vertical grip (that‚Äôs a must) and I personally like either the reflex or the holo. With the ACOG it‚Äôs honestly just a bit too jumpy for my taste
---
Might be a console. I'm fairly certain (but I might be wrong) that consoles don't have screenshot option.
---
 "We have disabled ranged weapons to prevent any possible spawn peeks"
---
Original title was better too
---
Eas server it is
---
That‚Äôs a pretty niche situation would you not say? You can always cherry pick a situation but that won‚Äôt represent the operator as a whole no matter what. For every one position where does need to expose himself there are probably, tens of spots where he doesn‚Äôt need to expose himself (at the very least the majority of situations/positions).
---
But once again that is weakness that is inherent to every operator. If bandit here where a thermite charge is being placed he is gonna trick it if a twitch see where J√§ger puts a ADS they will zap it. This is an inherent flaw of operators and can‚Äôt really be attributed to lesions himself. His gadget, when unnoticed is easily the best gadget on defence, except maybe the ADS.
---
Yes please
---
It has to be done my friend
---
Yeah at this point I don't even want to play casual let alone ranked.
---
It seems that "legit hacking" scumbag leaps into casual since state of ranked is oblivious.
---
this would be controversial but they should allow MnK on console officially and set matchmaking separately.
---
Whats this? Another reason maps like Chalet shouldn't be in the ranked pool.
---
So every door that I breach
---
I'd be ok with the Echo nerf, not too sure about his gun however, already can't have a muzzle attachment so his recoil is definitely not comparable to the French Boi MP5 frontline.
---
Also not sure I fully understand what you mean by "Sturdier turret", you mentioned a shutter speed nerf for closing so his turret if anything is more vulnerable overall no?
---
I'd be sad to see ACOG go on the Alda, I'm hoping we see tweaks that don't require the sight change first.
---
nice! whats sad is that i dont play therm much, so i might main him for abit haha
---
Every company has it's own sales startegies. Gameshare is a feature that's on console but not on PC. You really think ubi would allow for such an inconsistency?
---
Wait can you explain I don't get the joke
---
This is me being serious for a second, if you don't use Tachanka as an anchor and use him as an operator he is insane. don't insult the lord-o-high-all mighty-king pin-empire slayer-***god***, ever again for the people reading this.
---
I‚Äôd prefer this

You could for a more simple idea have two polls connected at the base and then the player toss it using a realse thingy to send the internal polls at the window, then a sorta sheet rolls between the two making it possible to walk on
---
. This way you can carry it since it will bw smaller.
---
Hmmmm this seems fair
---
That‚Äôs what i‚Äôm saying WHY did ELA push.
---
So you are telling me that if you removed the ACOG off say Doc and Rook, their viability and appeal won‚Äôt be affected negatively?? 
---
The ACOG is so strong in this game, and with the game overall favouring the defence especially at pro play, this change would definitely be a negative overall. It‚Äôs not a massive nerf, as they obviously want the weapon to be strong, but this change coupled with the turret nerf would definitely be a positive for the game
---
My Starbucks version just got deleted by the mods for no good reason :( glad yours is still up at least
---
Having only played newcomer queue and being fairly new, i dont think it should be in newcomer either. The other day, i was killed all 3 rounds of the game by a spawnpeak, and all 3 were different spots that i went to. Every time it happens its like, okay i have to run in from over here with no cover, and they're only peaking a sliver of their body with the rest behind a wall. What am i supposed to do? Hes mad far away with better positioning and cover and its seconds after the round started, am i really expected to just headshot him with no cover whenever they choose to do this?
---
Usually they kill at least 2 before someone lights them up enough that they retreat
---
Just sat down at my desk this morning to make this same post. I got ddoss'd 3 or 4 times this weekend on PS4. Once on the 4th round when we were up 3-0....talk about about taking the wind out of your sails.
---
 I guess they crashed the server so at least you don't lose elo in that situation. Still, there's the other type where they lag a particular player or everyone in the lobby and they're getting good at it. They'll wait till 30 seconds left and boom no one can move and the timer counts down, they win.
---
damn so many white people downvotes
---
This looks like you are playing on a N64.
---
Train is an atrocity, hence the rework but afaik sites (excluding haunted) are barely being touched.
---
I don't really know, one of them left, then reconnected and they started to kill each other

If they have potential but don't really want to work on getting better there's not much you can do to help them and they will limit your potential for winning games.
---
What about a magnet gadget that will pull in projectiles to it. So the projectile will still go off, but not where the attacker intended it to.
---
He is not the one getting /r/woooosh:ed here.
---
&gt;She can hit you and you can't hit her
---
She can't shoot or melee with the shield up (without the glitch), so I'm not sure what you mean by that. And if she's in a doorway just punch the shield and shoot her in the face. She's really not hard to counter unless you're really low on health or a slow op.
---
#Wham!
---
But they literally can't even do anything about it? They rent Microsoft's Azure servers, all they can do is ban the DDoSers, and even then that would be difficult to do as you'd need a mountain of proof.
---
Well I did mention I don't know exactly what weapons I would give him, I suppose you can choose any other shotgun instead the idea is to just give him a shotgun primary 
---
And he wouldn't simply replace Jager, this op can only place his gadget in doorways, while Jager is able to place his gadget almost anywhere, so he wouldn't be as strong in garages
---
Or finish her off with maverick....

---
Like when they made the Lost start with Holy Mantle in The Binding of Isaac.
---
I just did this shit to somebody all three rounds before the swap. It felt so dirty but yet so good.
---
I just started playing again (was lvl 20 when starting) played ranked for the first time, and ended up getting ddossers in one of my games very quickly. Its crazy to have played all but 15 ranked games and already run into cheaters. Only ranked Gold III too, its not even a high rank. Im on PC though so its happening on both platforms for sure.

---
Its going to be unpopular to say but I wish they brought back the crazy bloom effect from looking inside-to-outside and made it super dark looking outside to inside. This way more fighting actually happens INSIDE the building -- where it belongs in this game.
---
I just feel like spawn-peeking doesn't really take any skill and its cheesy as all hell. Not this game tries to be realistic (anymore anyway. The first season or two ops were a different story), but no one would stand in a window gun pointed out knowing special forces were about to approach the building. Great way to get sniped in the face.

1) these are spoofable. 2) legal implications of banning people on 2nd hand hardware.
---
I agree with both parts but I will add that the one reason jager is one of if not THE most picked defenders is not for the ads,but his carbine and 2nd gadget choices, and access to the m870
---
blackbeard doesnt need an alternative, just having one 'ha i see you but my head is invincible' guy on a window is enough
---
Yes but always remember with Zophia that you can stand up on your own when you go down, 
---
It‚Äôs a unique thing that only she has and it allowed me to win a 4-4 ranked match because the enemy team got cocky after downing me in OBJ. 
---
Not to mention she has two different rounds for her gadget (one to breach and one to concuss which is very similar to Ela‚Äôs gadget)
---
I mean more variety in weapons would be nice, but we all know that won't happen.
---
Do what
---
Basically, people have some bot that allows them to walk in a square to avoid being kicked from being afk, and some of those people end up coming back (some do this from the beginning) midround and teamkill, when they get the reverse team damage activated on them though, they just start throwing nades. It seemed to really  be bad this morning for whatever reason, but it seems to have since subsided.
---
Correct but Xbox also supports mouse and keyboard. The difference is that MS is allowing developers the choice if there supports M&amp;K or not. In this case, Ubi doesn't support it for their game so the Razer Turret doesn't work without something like XIM.

---
The reason that point made no sense is because in terms of re positioning his gadget he's no safer than an Ela or a Valkyrie.
---
The gu has to be first stepped into, meaning it has to survive. This already means a lot about the attackers, why weren't the entry ways to the OBJ cleared? The Gu's are only as powerful as the attackers are foolish.
---
Lesion mines are really more about Intel than damage or plant denial. You try and throw a gu mine down at a breached wall and see how that works, it will be destroyed within seconds and that's if you can find an angle to throw it without getting your head blown off.
---
Again to stop a plant that gu mine has to already be in place and in the attacker's way. As an attacker you can prevent that. You can't really prevent smoke canister othan than EMP'ing them or shooting them with really good reflexes.
---
The process is co-ordination, with smoke you can just yeet the canisters at where you think the attackers are from behind cover due to the AOE, with lesion have to point out your teammates where the gus are if any survived. That way your teammates can play around that.
---

what mouse and keyboard?

I mean even if you had one eye youd still see a full sight picture ü§î
---
Reinforce one half of a wall, place Mirror on it. Reinforcing next to the mirror would be reinforcing the other half
---
People learn at different speeds. The knowledge of someone who actively seeks out knowledge of the game would be greater than someone who just casually plays it and dose not care about improving.

How can i spawnpeek what i cant see? Please fix Ubi...
---
Nice nice.
---
I actually agree with this
---
for someone with special "aim sticks" he sure fucking sucks at aiming
---
I'd settle on 3 seconds tbh. 
---
Some spawn peeks involve throwing C4 so having it at 3 seconds would be the sweet spot to not getting headshot or blown up.
---
Why would that be necessary
---
Nah, if it was a mouse it would be smoother. I know long aim sticks are available so he‚Äôs probably telling the truth.
---
Really? Gonna try it tomorrow
---
BRUH
---
Depends on your outlook, I think rando saw Tachanka was selected and looked to balance the teams. He did a good thing.
---
This. People cant seem to understand you CANT go 4-0 on one side, so banning valuable operators that you will need when playing on the other side is stupid, because their team might be better at adapting than yours is. Its just better to ban operators that are are annoying to play against (bb, lesion, dokk, etc.)
---
Normally I associate jerkiness to being a mouse feature. Guess I need to play on a mouse more often.
---

The difference between what a small playtesting team can find and what gets found in millions of games a week is pretty substantial.

I‚Äôm playing Oregon night map rn
---
I've been saying forever Chalet is the worst balanced ranked map. Should have been reworked first. There are THREE other locations you can pick off spawners before they can react (as they t-pose into existence) on this map and dozens of places you can run out as  a defender and be 100% bulletproof while shooting attackers as they come in from spawn. No I won't share them. Yes I dropped them on r6fix. Multiple seasons in a row.
---
And can be destroyed by a grenade launcher.

Good, night maps are the best

her battery is quite short, and short ranged. every op can run up and melee the shield (I would maybe be careful about doing that with a 3 spd I guess tho) and she's totally fucked unless you ran in front of her teammates to do so. Not to mention that besides frags, capitao can light her on fire and nomad can knock her on her ass. Clash is honestly one of the weaker ops.
---
If clash is alone, you'll only die if you hesitate to push or get 360'd. As far as the whole "standing in a doorway" thing, monty does the same thing except a melee atk barely moves his shield, whereas clash jerks like you just cattle prodded her in the asshole. Not to mention Monty still maintains a regular shield when dropping the extension, and does it quickly. Clash's shield dropping is a time consuming process that requires you to learn to spin in a circle a certain way to even have a sliver of a chance to kill the guy watching you before you get lit up, and once it's down, she's just a slow motherfucker with a short mag.

I don‚Äôt disagree that it‚Äôs a dick move to take advantage of something like this but my point was simply it‚Äôs more the developers fault for not fixing it, since the beginning of competitive games players have looked for every exploit to get an advantage and win the game, doesn‚Äôt make sense to get more pissed at the players than the devs.

HEY STOP! Wtf I always catch you guys watching this sick shit

Thank you! I hope you go up and up till you are diamond üíé

Tbh she isn't that similar to lesion, she's far more mobile and doesn't provide the same amount of Intel, I'd picture her more as an ambush style roamer...if you're looking for that playstyle she's probably the best roaming operator for it, but if you prefer the more classical style of roaming I'd rather recommend getting vigil or alibi

200k active players per day, vs 400 peoples working on R6 (including devs, art, people who dont do levels, models, etc), and this took 4 years to find, so no I dont think devs would have find this.
---
Disabling is good if its a rapid fix but ubisoft don't seem to be rapidly dealing with it.
---
They disable entire gadgets to resolve an issue with a single operator but won't disable a gadget on a single operator to safe it.
---
The changes they make have a huge impact and disabling should be an absolute last resort.  They should hit exploiters hard and with heavy consequences which will deter and slowly weed out those who exploit.
---
Yes its a slow process but starting it now is better then not starting it at all.

As I said usually. Maverick is the exception. But the difference is is at Maverick can't instantly shoot through that hole. So if enemy hears it or sees it they can respond to it

What is the big problem with the 3 round rotation? Defender sided map? Well then you should both win your defends.
---
we won, i told said it to him ;)
---
Reminds me why I never play Cas.
---
This was about 2 months ago so it‚Äôs been changed
---
Not rly, if you win all those 3 rounds as an ATK you would PROBABLY had won them if there was 1 round rotation anyways. This quickens things up more. 
---
Let‚Äôs say often, in my matches. The other team goes for 3-0 and when the rotation hits we hit that 3-3. 
---
So it‚Äôs pretty much the same for me.

My game doesn't freeze and crash, it just closes. I would suggest to verify the game files through steam to fix it becuase that seemed to work for me.

If u just had hit that c4 :/

Yup. Played against that fucker last night. Same thing.

I would also accept if ubisoft did that but I just gave an idea that could work
---
Nice!
---
probably still got a bigger hitbox than ash
---
Level 181 and got black ice for ash‚Äôs R4C, IQ‚Äôs Commando, IQ‚Äôs LMG, FBI 5/7, SAS shotgun, Russian PMM, GIGN Magnum and Twitch/Lion DMR
---
Np
---
Just think of all the porn this gonna be used for!
---
Well, her hair are not dark green. Btw I made by myself the wig and i dyed with the right (i guess?) green color :) but yeah, the light is a bit weird and changes some color
---
On my Xbox I‚Äôm lvl 150 and have 0 black ice. Recently changed to PS4, now lvl 53 and managed to get four. Twitch‚Äôs F2, sledges and thatchers L85A2 ( fav weapon ), the MP5 on rook and doc and finally the P12 pistol for blitz, j√§ger, bandit and IQ
---
I have to force my teamies to run barb so I don‚Äôt feel too useless.
---
Ah ok
---
Thank you so much.
---
Double Barreled ‚ÄúShotgun‚Äù loaded with Explosive Shells
---
Then this is clearer now, I agree. It‚Äôs easier to get mad at the players as they are directly using these exploits against us.
---
We banned monty :)
---
Anyone wanna math that out?
---
Read again, makes sense now?
---
I don‚Äôt know if you said anything bad (whatever message was deleted) but this whole situation is just shit and part of why I moved to PC. Not just for siege, but the xbox community def played a part. It‚Äôs really toxic and annoying. And the whole comm bans system is shit.

Stop fucking drawing, SSG.  I love you guys.  Actually, I honestly love every one of the NA teams but SSG definitely has the best merch.

GO NA!!

Good job keep up the great work!

Looks like the game

i felt Oregon was balanced
---
I believe he shaves his head to fit in with a skin head biker gang
---
Yes change your ip lol
---
I was lucky and got it on the Ump45, though the ump kinda sucks.
---
It‚Äôs too simple and there‚Äôs not much rotations
---
In the outbreak cutscenes bandit was bald
---
You just 100% contradicted yourself.
---
kk
---
Fucking glitchers dude, we cant have any nice things.
---
Why would that matter? The point isn't to count how many women play the game and add the appropriate number of female ops , its that there is nothing wrong with being inclusive! You act like siege gets marketed as a realistic shooter but its not! It's a TACTICAL shooter.Creative liberties for the sake of fun are a given (as long as they are balanced). Its not to supposed to be like arma III!!And that brings us back to your other points,the reason you struggle so much with the game is because you don't even know what kind of game you are playing, much less HOW to play it!
---
I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong is it that diamond players are queuing with gold or that all of you people have reverse friendly fire on?
---
You see Ivan with the third eye of the slav activated one can teleport

No problem

At least it's not on the floor, in a corner, on ranked

Just reverse friendly fire

Ah gotcha

Just checked with R0-GR, can confirm

nothing suspicious here

Yeah because with the light it looks kind of grey-green color but with a better light it might look nice (and also your cosplay is really nice by the way :) )

Pretty much yeah

YOURE BREATHTAKING

I want a Ricardo version
---
i agree with defense being too strong because of this ban (especially echo), but as an IQ main since i first started playing, IQ was too strong w frags. she was a one-man army &amp; had too much utility.
---
Spawn peak ftw
---
Its a truly special moment fellow fuze main. We all remember our first hostage kill. I certainly didn't intend for it to happen but as Bob Ross would say Fuze mains don't make mistakes, they make happy little accidents.
---
I do the same.  lol
---
That's genuinely disgusting.
---
I'm shy :B 
---
Some people are already in parties too.
---
The first time an operator in sieges bio will have a "relevant experience" category that is just a list of terrorist attacks they carried out.
---
good for you, im now about 2k renown away and im excited!
---
Hey, my first black ice was the super 90 too! Sad many people have it because you were able to buy it..
---
Make your own witch hunting sub lol
---
no we should not be able to witch hunt. the overall post quality of this sub is poor to begin with but with every post being a name of someone accused of cheating, nobody wants that. if you have a video then send it to R6 Fix. there‚Äôs nothing anyone can do about it here.
---
Haha get it? Cause fuze sometimes kills the hostage?? Hahaha omg this is so funny.
---
Honestly never really thought about why he said that. I just assumed he was stating the name of the operation
---
cant wait to crossplay it on a switch XD, better yet on a SouljaPhone!!!
---
I know, it makes me so frustrated when I tell people this and then they don't believe me.
---
witch hunting is against the reddit sitewide rules. not just the R6 sub rules.
---
Ik a better spot for the third one

Well... heck
---
Probably because it‚Äôs a tired, dead meme. I mean how can people still find this joke funny after nearly 4 years?

I don't know why Smonks elite can't be a Nazi or Hitler, Like maybe a Black and Red WW1- WW2 uniform would be kewl

M&amp;K. Massive advantage on console and no real way of beating them as of now.
---
In my many months of playing Siege I‚Äôve never once seen a coordinated breach on the objective
---
Yes exactly
---
Well, that's actually the power of the switch.. they aren't looking to be the most advanced gaming experience. They are looking to be the best Nintendo experience available. And nothing Soulja will ever be a real thing.
---
Mnk is a huge problem but hackers are not a problem
---
Gotta up that FOV, child.  It makes all the difference
---
No, it really isn't.

Doxxing is digging up and/or publishing someone's private info on the internet. A DDoS is an attack that freezes a network by overwhelming it with data. If you don't know what things are don't claim that they're the same.

I haven't witnessed this problem but in relation to those squeakers who can't handle a game and kick me under the thought I was hacking because my ping was 400 at the highest but I was still at the top of the leaderboard.

I watch as well

Well jokes on me for being on Xbox üòÇ

Calm your tits im not attacking her personally white knight bitchass

Maybe if people would just play the game normally instead of exploiting everything

We wouldn't had shit disabled all the time

As a Fuze main, I support this.

Beautiful

Heres my edit [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WGnJ8bkmRU&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WGnJ8bkmRU&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
yeah but, you either got to know these people irl (which also isn't the best, since it might start rivalries and such) or from another game. anyways i won't complain that much because it is possible to have fun in siege even solo queueing.
---
So i‚Äôm not the only person to use irons? Well I personally prefer the irons on guns such as the MP5 and its variants and similar sights to that, examples being Thatcher‚Äôs AR33 and IQ‚Äôs 552 commando. Although i run irons on most guns to be honest. I also enjoy weapons with unique irons such as Lesion‚Äôs T-5 SMG. I also use irons on most shotguns.
---
Admirable performance. Slightly less admirable because they were all silvers
---
Because ubisoft are completely useless.
---
You can beat mnk players it‚Äôs just hard af. I‚Äôve had close games go in my favor but I will say I‚Äôve been beaten by them too many times.
---
Or just run a bot that detects ray traces from spawn locations to see if any interact with the interiors at all
---
Completely disagree but to each their own
---
At least you on pc
---

Well fuck

---
Fucking gold for that!?
---
Yeah, i see it now
---
When it 1st came out you would spend 5 to 10 minutes just searching for a game so at least you have a chance to play at all
---
&gt;Apparently an Irish Car Bomb is a drink, for instance. I did not read the context of this and started talking to some drunk dude (enthusiastically) about domestic terrorism.
---
"Fuck laddy, ets just a fookin drink!"
---
shut the fuck up you loser.
---
Ya the game is awesome but it has a large learning curve, but just putting time into it makes it the best game i have
---
Yes it is worth it and a lot of people are playing it...... TOXIC PEOPLE , u gotta learn the game fast or u will get team killed or killed every game üôÇ
---
And that was the exact date I stopped maining IQ
---
Now we gotta deal with Valk runouts every damn attacking round. Not to mention cheaters who DDOS the server when they‚Äôre losing to avoid losing Elo
---
I hope not.
---
Ore wa o chinchin ga daisuki nandayo
---
I used to climb to/through plat most seasons and ran into the same wall, its mainly that there is just a large jump in skill at that ELO. 
---
In gold you run into alot more people getting carried, people in an ELO too high for their skill, people not taking it as seriously, etc.
---
When you get past that group into plat, the skills groups are much tighter and its much less about one person carrying the team typically, because everyone is counter spawn-peaking knows the angles and how to best defend/attack each site.
---
The only advice I can give is to maximize playtime in plat, get away from pub-stopping/noob killing tactics. You typically have to assume they will drone intelligently and you wont get lucky as often and be able to avoid drone detection as a roamer. Focus on cooperative tactics and get away from the assumption that you can win 1v1 gunfights as the enemy will now be much more likely to have equal or greater than shooting ability to you. 
---
That might not be super helpful but best of luck.
---
You watch your damn heretical tongue
---
stop whining secure and hostage arent fit for competitive play but its not gonna be removed from casual
---
Yesir. It‚Äôs so fun once you get the hang of it.
---
Was gonna edit it, but figured that‚Äôs too much work
---
Just keep in mind that when you go away from a 1:1 on sensitivity, you'll need to dial in your up/down target acquisition again. So, if you find yourself snapping above or below your target too often once you make the switch, just know it is that and will take some time.
---
I'm just here to watch Beaulo
---
I ain‚Äôt got gold, but take that ü•á
---
We need someone else who can entrap projectiles and make them redundant, just like Jager. The issue at the moment is that Jager has a very high pick rate with part of this coming down to having a gadget that no other defender has in terms of mechanics and importance. 
---
This is why I came up with this operator idea. Her name is Pitcher ‚Äî&gt; 
---
Pitcher is equipped with 2 MK12 LDD‚Äôs (Localised Detonation Disperser). Each device can be placed on the floor only, and contains 3 redundancy projectiles each. The device will launch one of these redundancy projectiles at any incoming projectile. That projectile is then encased in a fabric that absorbs the blast and makes it redundant. The neat part of this gadget is that the fabric still allows all sound of that device to be emitted so a grenade will still make the explosion sound, a candela still makes its unique sound etc. The difference is that the effects of it are completely negated. The mind games and counter play options are very high with this gadget, which is always good to see. 
---
As this device isn‚Äôt actually destroying the projectile, instead encasing it, it means the device is a lot quieter overall making it less obvious overall further adding benefit to your team as it is likely to fool the enemy a great deal more. 
---
Another interaction I‚Äôd like to see if that they can entrap Capitao‚Äôs arrows if they pass over it‚Äôs radius. This is a nice mechanic and buff to your team if you pick Pitcher.
---
Pitcher would be a 2 armour, 2 speed defender. This is to have a clear distinction between her and J√§ger. She‚Äôd also have a completely unique weapon selection, with only having shotguns available to choose from. These would be the DP-12 double barrel pump shotgun or the SRM 1226. As for equipment, she‚Äôd have C4 and a BP camera. Another note to make is that she wouldn‚Äôt have access to a machine pistol. It always occurs that the machine pistol becomes the primary for that operator and I don‚Äôt want that. I‚Äôd say give her some stronger pistols such as a nice handling revolver and maybe a high damage pistol. 
---
A balancing change I‚Äôd want to make before Pitcher would be introduced would be to lower the amount of ADS‚Äôs that Jager has down to 2 (from 3), therefore stopping only 4 projectiles. This means that j√§ger just isn‚Äôt the better option in all situations and that if you pick Jager, you‚Äôll have a good gadget but it protects you from less projectiles overall. This means there is a real choice between the two. This is completely necessary and would be a great way to keep both viable when completing with each other and means that if both are run together, you can‚Äôt stop an absurd amount of projectiles overall
---
My ancestors are smiling at me imperials can you say the same
---
No you are using it complete wrong... your analogy would be; blame the gun manufacturers not the murders using the guns.., the gun is the medium for the action.... Fucking face palm
---
spawn peaking normally is fine and easy to counter  
---
you seem to just be shit 
---
however spawn peaks that instantly kill you should be patched, and they are gonna be, but their are so few of them that it wouldn't make sense to make a retarded change like that
---
You sure the loss wasn't because of the bad reinforcment decision by you
---
How did you even do this?
---
As a heavy Valk user, I'm glad to see running out and killing people still get players panties in a bunch.
---
 Does it even need to be explained that clash needs to go?
---
Anyone else noticed being shot buy a guy holding a nitro cell and not a gun also?
---
I did this but with zofias impact cannon thing
---
Yes! And give her frags back! I definitely do not have an ulterior motive here
---
I‚Äôm surprised it wasn‚Äôt jackal instead of mont
---
Take echo
---
Assuming im shit because im sharing a few opinions? Lol BOI
---
Clean
---
Ranked is still BETA
---
Exactly why I prefer one of those cranky, burly hostage killers up there and the angry Russian woman ship
---
Maybe lose some weight
---
why are you impressed, this isn't anything impressive it's just me tk'ing someone but stylish like
---
It was also possible to completely skip that mission, at which point you'd only hear about it through memes.
---
quit crying
---
Exactly
---
I think Did thermite have them too
---
Games been a lot more fun without clash tbh
---
Beware playing this game solo when you‚Äôre new is extremely intimidating, you will die over and over but just watch a bunch of youtube videos and practice practice practice
---
What‚Äôs the f to us consolers?
---
Which I wish I had done when I played it years ago. That mission left me **SHOOK**
---
Precisely
---
HAHA FUNNY JOKE LOL XD
---
I like this but I don't think Jager should be nerfed in another op comes in, for example bandit did not lose his c4 or any of his utility just because Kaid he was introduced 
---
But overall I like your operator
---
Yea they modified sounds with phantom sight
---
I like the idea but i am wondering how this gets exploited like every other gadget
---
Rip, was one game off plat 1 last season. It hurts :/
---
I love you forever now.
---
I agree, but its always possible we can continue to reduce it. I feel like the mirror damage was a big step in the right direction and have already noticed a reduction in individual toxicity.
---
Not especially unless you can hit headshots with the first or second shot, it will lose most gunfights if your only hitting body shots.
---
And somehow It always circles back to a persons rank.
---
yes, because any half decent player wouldnt be complaining about spawnpeaking.
---
haha original joke amirite guys??? fuze hostage and jager acog please gibe karma
---
They've maintained that number since the game started too.
---
Originally it was Sledge, Thermite and 1 other (I don't recall who). Then as Buck became available they took Thermite's because it made him "Too much of a loan wolf, that didn't need help"  and throughout my time playing everytime they give someone new grenades they take them from someone else.
---
I get it that they are trying to make it so you don't have 5 people with grenades, but they need to come up with a way to make the others options more appealing.
---
Like give operators Claymores OR grenades.
---
Now you have to choose if you're playing offensively or defensively.
---
I forget why did Shepard want war? Was it just to jerk his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a great general‚Äù ego?
---
I'm gonna write a pretty sad story. So there's this boy who have played siege since White Noise and have never used IQ pretty often. A few days ago that good fooking looking boi decided to bring his Bae into a round and love her so much he decided to buy her elite and after introducing the money in the game he read a tweet which said that IQ would be banned. &lt;3 if I should consideer not buying it and purchase his bald  GSG9 brother
---
Also IQ we be playable again on July 27 on consoles
---
Take finka and lion's ass outta here, werent even meant to originally be in the game.
---
... It's a fucking joke but okay.
---
Rude
---
Thank you very much, stranger
---
Even in casual games if im tryna learn it? Thats rough
---
Why tf this nsfw
---
this is much more than OK
---
Are you dumb no ones gonna does in gold a casual you idiot
---
S O C K S
---
Like all dlc ops?
---
I have a fix for this exploit, let‚Äôs take away claymores and give IQ her god damn grenades back!
---
Could be worse. ü§ó
---
no one because everyone can be countered and people like to complain about balanced operators being OP
---
For sure, I have a friend who used to always tk but now he doesn‚Äôt anymore lol, but also you gotta admit some people deserve to be teamkilled on rare occasion so they shouldn‚Äôt restrict it too much
---
All your credibility just went out the window. Good day.
---
What's funny is, Thermite still has grenades in his situation.
---
On release, I think it was Thermite, Sledge, and IQ, now it's only Sledge, Buck, and Finka.
---
No he was ranked diamond at lvl 56. No losses in ranked.
---
Yea , u only get kicked on casual cannot in ranked + u have to be lvl 30 to play rank but there is 2 gamemodes u can play to learn the game and avoid Toxic people
---
yeah no shit dude but you seem to be upset that it was removed from ranked
---
Git gud scrub
---
Obviously it means don‚Äôt be quick, take your time
---
No...^^^^rushing
---
You are using the wrong analogy
---
Really I didn't notice this sound change til yesterday it's really off-putting because everything sounds quiet and it's hard to hear someone coming
---
Waiting for "ME AND MY  BOYS" MEme
---
PLSZZZ POST IT AGAIN PLZZZ PLZSSSZSZ UBI(DUMMY)SOFT NEEDZ TO SEE THIS!!!11
---
Uhhhh... which one?
---
Alright. Thanks
---
The comment on -13? Evidently not.
---
this is more of an operator idea. even so, it would be incredibly annoying and maybe OP because the community already dislikes stun and disorient operators (ying, ela, echo, blitz)
---
She's the only good thing I have
---
If she still had her grenades, this wouldn't be happening
---
I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúrejected‚Äù any argument except this one right now unless by reject you mean ‚Äúdispute‚Äù.
---
I can play around lesion just fine but that doesn‚Äôt mean that he isn‚Äôt warranted of a nerf. I played the game before he even came out and he was such a game changer that I made sure me and my squad adapted because we saw how strong he was without being used to his fullest potential. I (and everyone else) adapted to Ela for 6 months and to Lion for a year I think I‚Äôm capable of working around little ol lesion. Does not make him less worthy of a nerf though.
---
A lesion doesn‚Äôt need to have map knowledge or even call outs  to be good because that is how easy lesion he is to play. A good backing to this claim is that lesion is widely considered to be the best op for solo queue players as generally your team will get the gist of where your GU went off and push them while GU‚Äôd. He doesn‚Äôt need the slightest effort to be good. Win/pick delta agrees with me.
---
Personally I think ELO loss for teammates quitting should be done on a round to round basis. If you team leaves after round 8 theres a more harsh loss than if they leave round 1. It should reflect how long you went without team mates and if they returned
---
Confused as how anyone ever thought otherwise

I‚Äôve lost over 500 elo this season because of it. It‚Äôs happened to me a little under 20 times. I‚Äôm normally 5000 plus elo diamond and I can barely crack 4200 this season because of it.

I didn't read fuck

Are you normally bronze or what?

What platform you on ? I need 5 elo for plat 3 if you wanna help. 1.25 kd

I mean Scott knew that right away he was undercover. Joined makarov and was going to commit a terrorist act(all of them pretending to be terrorist organisation 1) but makarov crosses and frames the Americans.

I found the campaign disappointing but the bigger maps and marksman rifle and pistol viability catapulted it into my #2 most favorite, behind BO1.

Look, I was pissed before hand,  I just wanted meh pack and Ubisoft do this? Fgs

Ubisoft is too dumb to implement a great idea like that. They want the game as unbalanced as possible!

Did u down two guys and then kill the last one?

Restart your client you mard ass.

Shotguns don't have a headshot multiplier. You probably only landed a couple pellets.

But there is always that  old teacher who hasn‚Äôt had a technology upgrade since the rotary phone was released...
---
If she sees this and reports it...after the investigation which finds you as the culprit the zero tolerance rules most schools have nowadays will nail you to the cross 
---
Just be careful man.
---
Or just google the solution. This has already been asked her a 1000times

Restart your game, it‚Äôll be there

Okay, thanks for the insight!

Why is Nomad there? She‚Äôs awesome

I didn't reinforce it again. Stupid comment

What about in college

Hit both sides of the window and still had momentum it‚Äôs a glitch

No those where my first kills in that round (I kinda suck at the game)
---
Last season I was silver... But this season I kept losing my placement matches and I was ranked bronze IV so I was like alright let's go to copper IV lol
---
this has absolutely nothing to do with my response. these posts are annoying. we know this bug is here. restart your game and getting upset on reddit about it.

I'd say it would probably be something from one of the 2 world wars since that's what most of the other elite skins are.
---
I love that their primary and secondary weapon slid through the floor.
---
Bruh I deal with lag 10x this in every game and I don‚Äôt complain and you get one spike and you whine about it
---
They can do something about it. You are completely wrong. They can add relays to the servers so it‚Äôs impossible to ddos. Counter strike did it, so stop letting ubi off the hook for something they could easily implement when  obviously don‚Äôt want to shell out the resources for it and would be rather let‚Äôs their player base continue to suffer.

I meant operator skins. My b.
---
Lol yeah
---
Forgive me if this was answered somewhere else, but are we allowed to do multiple entries? Like if I wanted to do two different ops?
---
The system doesn't allow them to disable just one character's item. They would have to ban all claymores. They said this once.
---
What it does: It overworks the connection so you either lag like hell or disconnect from the match.
---
You think I'm complaining? Get real lmao. My connection is great so its just abnormal for me.

Just make a sequel! Bingo bango problema solva.

But I think I just shot another guy trying to res and got the kill credit for the downed guy and the match doesn‚Äôt end if there are guys still down

Cool, do u think it‚Äôd be something like jager?
---
Colleges are much more strict in most cases.
---
Simply because there has been 300 students who have done this before you and they are tired of the complaints and public forums and reports they need to publish to the entire community.
---
I hope you get banned for this post because you're straight up breaking the rules of the subreddit
---
I've never hunted before.
---
Thing is is that it was point blank
---
so sludge bucc and who? i cant remember, was it finka?
---
Ya kinda seems like you are
---
I don't think a couple pellets would kill point blank
---
It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm probably worse lol
---
Noted I‚Äôll just say it wasn‚Äôt me since nobody was in class
---
PS4 but that‚Äôs a solo only account so I won‚Äôt be playing on it
---
Black ops 3 was pretty fun. But the redundancy gets old fast! Siege is the future.
---
Exactly. Most of the ops are easy to counter smh
---
I don‚Äôt really play flax a lot so that‚Äôs cool that he can collateral
---
Sure, go ahead. But I'm not sure how we'll handle prizes in case someone has multiple entries in the top 3, you might only be eligible for one prize.
---
Nah man, it looks really good
---
how did you change your crosshair like that

For someone so obsessed with data you seem to forget that correlation ‚â† causation. I could link a chart that shows motorcycle accidents increasing as sales of sour cream did, it doesn't mean anything though. The same goes for the charts. Correlation because you see only what you want to see doesn't mean anything. I find it pretty funny you've yet to rebuke that Frost isn't the most OP defender even though she had the highest win rate, its probably because you know in your heart of hearts that the chart is just that, a chart. It doesn't mean fuck all.
---
Why does the C7E sound so weird
---
WtfüòÇüòÇ
---
I'd add Insurgency to that.
---
probably its when they usually release the pro league bundles :)!
---
Thanks much appreciated 
---
I will try to do a proper sketch of an operator when I have time off work
---
Wouldn't Nokk stick out like a sore thumb though?
---
No it‚Äôs nothing like call of duty . It‚Äôs nothing like another game and we all like it that way hence it‚Äôs popularity . There is multiplayer game idea against players in casual such as bomb hostage and secure and ranked which is only bomb. Bomb to be general is to go in and defuse a bomb while one team reinforces and defends it. Secure is where one team has to secure and defend a objective zone from a rival team that has to overthrow it. And hostage is were you have to defend a hostage while the attacking team has to come rescue or steal it ( however you want to see it) and extract it to win. Each game mode has rounds to determine a victor of 3 rounds. You can play as both a attacker an defender. Anyone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong or tab in .
---
So you've decided not to make the connection between the boards a wall and expect me to ignore this?
---
r/mildlyinfuriating
---
Does it matter though? Rendering part was implemented specifically for Siege because of dynamic destruction
---
It appears to be the "Frost bundle" its 850 r6 credits (I dont see a price for renown) and comes with the trapper headgear (the only one i have lol) and the Super 90 black ice.
---
I have iron sights on alibi in case I want to hide in a hologram.
---
Nice man. Got my first black ice on MP5
---
Maybe for native speakers, but English is consistently ranked as one of the most difficult languages to learn

You can have anti roamer operators that are much better executed, honestly I wouldn't mind that thing MJ suggested and making it far harder to use. It would increase the skill required to use him and would be far less frustrating and overpowered. Also I've noticed you love your terrible arguments. My idea for an operator, Mega Fuck You, hes a defender who insta kills attackers upon spawning, its fine though hes an anti attacker, so that means no issues what so ever could exist with this.
---
Exactly, it clips all the time and I spoted a lot of Maestro's like this

Watch out for a guy on xbox named CaptNemo7300 if you're in high gold. He is in a squad with 3 other people and if you're the random on his team and try to team kill him or something him and his squad mates will make sure you get tkd every round. He is a montagne main but he sucks at ddosing (cant get everyone out at the same time) i ran into him 4 times already once on his team and the rest on the enemy team. The only reason they're in high gold is because of the lag switching. Him and his squad mates suck ass and belong in copper maybe bronze if I wanna be nice.
---
Omg lolol
---
Buddy, you'll get that 500 back in a few matches.
---
Shut
---
Yes but ONLY if it's done with renown. If R6 credits worked too it would be absolutely awful
---
Yes we know there's no way to 100% ban hackers, but this is the same story in every damn FPS sub, the harder it is, the better.
---
Are device ID bans a definitive solution? no. Better than nothing? absolutely, a good chunk of people hacking won't be able to get around a device id ban.
---
I agree
---
Those are grzmots, not gus
---
Yes. You should keep one to drone around and use the rest as cameras by putting them in a corner of a room
---
I didn't really ask but ok. I don't reall care but yeah obviously I knew that
---
Thank you lmao
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Tomorrow or Thursday
---
Lol ok
---
At point blank a 12 Gauge would blow a persons head off
---
I‚Äôve seen this somewhere before
---
You see I was in game at this point and had to ace out the round but I do agree with your point.
---
Thank you
---
What's up with all that negativity, somebody could kill you if you stick out like that.
---
Flashes are, and have been for some time, highly inconsistent.
---
Why is it dark?
---
Do you have to make a subreddit hashtag for everything? Shut the fuck up
---
Get mozzie, if you get clash you won‚Äôt even be able to play her for probably another month, until she gets unbanned. Plus mozzie is way more fun :)
---
Clash is currently banned so you‚Äôd be waiting a while to play her
---
Don't stress about it, it's a visual glitch only and you don't actually lose packs.
---
Have played skyscraper a 1000 times, never seen it. Useless
---
Don't wanna see this game turn into rocket league.
---
Frags basically made her become Thatcher with the ability to see where the electronics (and some defenders) are.
---
To clarify I was in the match with him and he did not "ace" the round. He got 4 kills and killed a teammate.
---
Oh no, I hurt your feelings and have a differing opinion OwO
---
Mozzie all day..
---
I appreciated how you reloaded after using one bullet
---
It did make sound but it was definitely not loud enough
---
Yes, but I've never encountered DDOSing in 400+ matches of CSGO MM, nor seen in r/GlobalOffensive. So I think it's very rare in CSGO
---
Unpopular opinion, I kinda like it and want a better version of that as a headgear
---
Wireless not good as wired? My friend, you‚Äôre living in the past. Have you had the chance to try logitech‚Äôs g pro wireless mouse and the g613 mechanical wireless keyboard? They will surprise you.

I saw this twitch consol clip where it was a 2v1 and the enemy got hurt from his teammate the. His teammate died, so he threw his twitch drone and shocked him twice then called it a clutch. I got 20 downvotes for saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a clutch, he had less than 20 hp‚Äù
---
*But it's not spelling at all, as that word isn't misspelled. It's grammar.*
---
If you read his bio, it talks about his "diminutive" stature.
---
I'm peaking in grammar too
---
Bulletproof shield is cool, but I would replace the black mirror with a two-way crackable but bulletproof like monty shield.
---
This combo looks really good too. I have the same headgear but just a bit different uniform. Mine is the tan uniform that has the green vest. Both look really good and I‚Äôve started playing smoke because of it. Looks so sick and he‚Äôs just a good op anyway so it‚Äôs a win win

You don't need to sledge it, he so powerful he can shoot through the wall himself.

This is why we need to remove 1 shot headshots. Cause you know they're not gonna remove spawnpeeking.

So it talks about him being short?

Cuz he is midget

Imo the only difference between gold and plat is solo queue vs playing with a squad. If you're gold II playing only by yourself then you can easily be a fine member of a Plat team.

You already proved to be a liar . You have a 1.58kd this season not a 1.7. Queuing with a plat doesn't mean crap if you have a sipver

Also rewards for ‚Äúgood play‚Äù are a bad idea, I think. They should be rewarded less. I don‚Äôt think R6 has an issue with tons of bad players, but rewarding those who are nice and good teammates would be the way to go. Otherwise someone will get two kills in a match but have them in the same round for a clutch and they‚Äôll get good player recs even though they actually went 2-5 for the round. Versus someone else who goes, say, 4-4, but played support for someone else. Had 6 assists and was good with smokes/flashes

Never said I queued with plats

Absolutely no one uses the shotgun on pc.
---
It‚Äôs not that difficult to not get killed by spawn peeks, save for maps like theme park but that‚Äôs an issue of map balance. If you want to spawn in a location drone the typical peeks, it‚Äôs usually free fucking kills when they don‚Äôt expect you to preform their head, and if you don‚Äôt think you can win the gunfight then spawn somewhere else. The only problem is spawn RUSHING and instant spawn peeks like this one. 
---
Say you get what you want and people can‚Äôt spawn peek, are they just not allowed to shoot out of windows? Are windows removed?

Unless you have 500 ping and eat 7 headshots

I disagree vehemently about outback. I love that map for both attacking and defending. Recently went 18-2 on it and always have a blast even when I play like shit. I‚Äôd rather play it over Fort, Hereford, Skyscraper and Chalet that‚Äôs for sure.

I was SO CLOSE on getting to good 3 and I matched up agiants coppers, silvers and one gold (beside me)

The other team?

They had a P L A T I N U M on their team

Yeah yeah I hear it from everyone lol.

It‚Äôs on console and buying a vpn doesn‚Äôt matter cause they literally crash the server, on high elo console it‚Äôs always happening with no consequences either

For me my issues with her using the FMG-9 are that it's just slightly too weak(IMO) for her role and it's the wrong weapon for who she is supposed to be lore wise. 
---
The FMG-9 would have made perfect sense for Warden but makes no sense for Nokk. By comparison I think Mute's MP5K would have been a much better pick both lore and stats wise as it's only marginally better having four more minimum damage and it's .2 seconds faster with both reloads. To me that tiny bump in reload time and minimum damage would help make Nokk more appealing without making her OP at all.
---
I‚Äôd rather just use the CZ and control the recoil while full auto

Damn you *never* draw IQ

The LED setup thoüëÄ

nah, hes not hacking, just pure skill.

Bandit is like *Hello there*

On PC it's thermite/jackal cav/echo until plat, then it becomes really random.

Found the guy who wonders why he is stuck in gold

I think it's just a meme tbh

I thought he said "no Russian" because he wanted to make a joke about to not rush in, by not saying rushing but Russian. But I could also be wrong.. so there's that.
---
Haha wait Nevermind the mods removed it. Inconsistent and unfair moderation all around. Really bummed out cuz of it :(

But reddit has multiple subreddits for a good reason, I only want a subreddit like this so people looking for pc clips can see this subreddit and the people posting can just put it on this subreddit and the pc one too.

Lag?

Nah lol he was running into objectives going mach 5 going at people

Well if they've done it once before it's super easy to guess where they're going next and you can shoot it by the first one

Hope you enjoy her, she‚Äôs a ton of fun to play. I personally think she‚Äôs the best soft breacher in the game.

Nope.

Oh, there's more

nah, thats pretty normal.
---
I think shotguns are stronger on console because it's harder to aim with a controller giving AR and semi-automatics a slight disadvantage.
---
Oh boy I sure do love playing my favorite operator in this game
---
He's 1.63m tall, I think. That is pretty short.
---
There‚Äôs a big rn where if you hit alt+f4 it‚Äôll recreate IQ glitch but with twitch. Only works with twitch though.
---
no and no

It‚Äôs a new glitch, saw some guy doing it a few days ago.
---
Maybe if she had an AR she'd be useful
---
I love thepeople in cas that will rage and whine when i rush and spanwpeek every round, completely convinced I'm sweating my ass off.

Me spawnpeeking 3 rounds in a row isn't exactly a high IQ strat, nor is rushing every round with Ash/IQ.

If you notice the ban waves hit when there is a sale.  It is a business decision.  Ban all the hackers during the sale so they will pick the game right back up giving Ubi more cash.
---
That has always happened but it's getting worse and worse every season, most of these people are good players but their behavior makes me sick, most of them are wannabe pro players who are not good enough for pro-league so they inflate their egos by shitting on people in casual or creating smurf accounts to shit on even more people. And as soon as they die, they either leave immediately or send some hate message to the enemy team.
