Either that was lucky as f\*\*k or you deserve more than plat 3

No

Perfect Rook Bait EZ
---
Use crouch as space, prone as control, and vault as v. Also, b is a good option. Wherever your thumb is closest too when it is resting on the space bar. Good luck &amp; i hope you find the most comfortable method!

T-AA. If I want fps, I go for 80 - 80 on the sliders.
---
Hm like half the people have mics on ps4 the other half can’t interact is what I’m trying to say
---
I should also add, in offline, on lowest, my frames are around 200 on average.
---
Why not ban bandit or Mira
---
I still would have found a way to get my c4 stuck on the top lmao. Nice tho
---
They’re pretty cool hacks
---
But banning thermite and thatcher
---
You could ban Mira or echo instead
---
Your comment literally means nothing.. Of course he can scam your footprints, that's his gadget.. I'm saying you can use his gadget against him if you have good game sense and can set up an ambush.....
---
I was on defense, the lesion downed the hostage and left and it said prevent revive instead of revive the hostage since they were essentially tk’d, then I went to revive the hostage, Valk shot me, the hostage died and we won the round, and they did this every round
---
Ok so i know some peoply think it dumb to put 50%, i m fine with that it gives me 144fps and i m happy with that, if you are not guy that need good graphics try with 50% and medium(or low) shadows.
---

---
Currently with 1050ti i can stay in 144fps.
---
Sorry for the confusion lol
---
I think it has to do with the announcement of reflective damage. There was an uptick in team killing back when they announced harsher punishments too.
---
We need echo in the background being hungry looking at the cat :D
---
Careful, I think the enemy has guns!
---
What do u play on i can help you out
---
I think the like super cheap 15 dollar version on steam made you buy each and every operator at high renown prices
---
Stick to one or two ops until you know some maps and game mechanics
---
First off Scan*. How can you use his gadget against him if he is constantly scanning you, it also doesn’t help that those 5 scans also show his teammates so your not only dealing with him but four other players
---
it ain’t much but it’s honest work
---
Try locking your fps to 60,120 and 144 to see cpu % will change atleast that how works for me. Currently i m on 80%~ cpu usage.
---
It’s the mouse he’s using
---
My solution would be if you lean left, let camera be on right eye, same for other side. If you arent leaning camera will be the new one.
---
Upvote if this glitch is far more game breaking than crouch spamming
---
I'm playing with medium and 50%. My fps is around 130.
---
I said "they're in the building" once and got kicked.

“Take Blackbeard’s ACOG”
---
Pretty much what happened in PUBG
---
villa can eat my cheeks
---
What? You guys never seen a smoke grenade before?
---
So long as you have a 4 or 5 man, ying, lesion, Finka, zofia are easy support characters to play with reasonably good guns with a steady amount of recoil as well as decent utilities. However I play bomb exclusively so this could differ on gamodes.
---
But their are no counters
---
Why
---
Not as bad as my pack luck I opened 7 packs yesterday’s and got 3 duplicates
---
What's 5-7 shield?
---
You ever just pull a 9 and 5 and still manage to lose a game so even if you dropped bodies like radiation in Chernobyl you still lose the mmr?
---
Sorry about the drop in frames, I blame Upload Studio
---
Defense: Valk / Mira / Ela / Echo.
---
Attack: Hibana / Jackal.
---
This happened to me earlier but i was on the same team as them with the same person too. i tried to get cav to down all of them but without knowing, after the third down i got kicked out to team killing.
---
I find using lesion for his traps to know when someone is coming through a door is very useful and using an easy breacher like hibana is also very useful cause you always need a breacher on the team
---
Yeah, I think he has been nerfed to hell, Ofc I don't want him to be at the stat he was first released, but damn his shield now is nothing but paper.
---
Buck is a good attacker and Frost is kinda op
---
Elephant skin gay lol
---
Although Operator alternatives are good for the game (bandit/kaid.  Thermite/Hibana) etc. I think having two characters that can repeal about half the utilities on attack would be a little Op.
---
“ALL”
---
Jesus
---
Casual is full of aggressive bots xd
---
If you're talking about limiting the fps to that, the config fps limiter doesn't work. I was using v sync originally to cap the fps to 75.
---
This would be good for stopping a whole team rushing at once
---
The lean spamming, AND the crouch spamming
---
Can’t upvote because at 69
---
THIS IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN SORRY TO BREAK IT TO YOU
---
Looked clean
---
Yeah, they admitted to being smurfs and called me a bot after I wiped them the next game I was placed in with their exact team. Apparently they were plats
---
Nah u shoulda seen it earlier
---
What about a operator that can use a bow and arrow to shoot a explosive arrow filled with flash grenades kinda like ting or just and explosive like ash
---
I always get kicked starting it up
---
Pc
---
No? What do you think developers can actually do about hackers on PC? 
---
Hacking has always existed in PC games, there isn't much the devs can do about it.
---
Username checks out
---
saw a guy called sumut like "ImGuduAint" get banned for being boosted by a cheater, that was quite funny
---
He ain't wrong
---
Well yeah but still glitched through the wall
---
now I want to see this implemented
---
nice p320!!
---
my brother always gets one started on him and then we have to deny it.
---
If you watched the whole thing you’d see that I glitched through the wall. Yes I did a horrible job at trying to kill him and would have lost that fight anyway but still.
---
You fool, doc cannot bring himself to share his stash of illicit drugs

Oops.

I might have confused a similar thread here. My had.
---
For fortress, I wouldn't want it removed cause I find the map beautiful, but it does have L hallway issues. And the bunker site has an attacker favouring plant zone. Needs tweaks.

Esc/options/video. You should see aspect ratio there. I am not at my computer at the moment and won’t be for about an hour, and I don’t remember if it’s video or graphics.

I have a cliop saved on my ps4 and i have the ps4 app is their a way i can get it from their and send it to you

Give it 63 damage and 5 more rounds and I have no complaints.

Ye but it’s not smurfing if I’m hitting my actual rank

You can, I was just talking about how you can do it on pc :)

Plant! The seeds...
---
I’m not is the thing, but I did try to melee him which would have given me a chance but I hit the wall I phased through
---
And on a smartphone?
---
He's probably going to be after bandit, Monty, smoke and castle.
---
Not sure what you’re exactly referring to. My point was OW change to a no duplicate system in spite of it reducing the amount of loot boxes they would sell because of it. It not changing because of booster packs is not a fact, in fact it might increase the sale of them because people might consider alpha packs actually worth it if there was a no duplicate system.
---
Okay thx

It wasn't lions ability because there's no on screen promts telling you it's about the scan. That being said I can say it was cheating or not

Do you have the passes or the certain edition
---
Maverick is an attacker
---
This is a defending round for the team
---
It probably didn’t load and needed to kick him, saw a post with this yesterday and I think it’s a PS4 issue
---
Me and a couple of my friends were dicking around in a casual match and we all got in the bath tub on skyscraper and just blew all of our c4's at once to see how far we could launch
---
Nah hes just a better player
---
The counter that Blitz needs.
---
Well it seems the objective is inside the building too
---
Wish i could have been there, the ragdolling recently is amazing. Watched a vigil get hit by my airjab into a wall like hed gotten blown up and since i was shooting him at first i thought he just died. Almost got me but he was already low

My bro had the same thing after buying the standard edition.

How many operators look like weird old men?
---
Maybe I'm not sure I'm not entirely familiar with how game share works
---
3 hits to 2 is decent especially if there's a whole hallways full and you don't wanna go through it. I don't know though, I see siege as a team based game so everyone doesn't need a gadget to kill or even damage people it's all about balancing what you have
---
Report him. If on console report his usename and give the reason. So if it comes out true if they look into a ban. If you have a message. Show the console or ubi. Then he will get banned. I filmed a xbox hacking on xbox1 only 2 times. One went underground with autoaim. Could see post ways.  2nd guy could see past walls.
---
understandable reaction
---
Incredibilis!

I would just check with them and see if the items line up, if not then it's just a cool glitch and that's awesome

Jaeger is closer phonetically than jager without the umlaut

Sounds good, champ 👍
---
You keep saying feelings which leads me to believe you don't know what we're talking about. So thanks for wasting my time.
---
I hate old Hereford. Whatever nostalgia I had for that map was wasted away by the cabbage waste of a layout and only 1 staircase, making any sort of retakes impossible.
---
I know casual is casual and fun is fun, but losing to the exact same hold in every game isn't fun at all.
---
I don't consider old Hereford even worthy of casual. Maybe custom games, but never PvP.
---
Yeah I think it was a lot more fun, even if it wasn't completely balanced. It would be cool if they at least added both to the casual map pool.
---
Sounds good thanks for the help

That's not that fantastical? he's probably just good

Not much of a roamer here, more of an anchor and soft roamer. That 1 staircase always bothered me.
---
As a jager main , i really miss those runouts and Spawnpeeks tbh...
---
Well right now there is a lot of gadgets that kill already, most of them require the enemy to be near dead already. I also think if this change was ever added to barbed wire, then defenders should only have 1

If I remember correctly they we're aiming to release 100 operators and keep the game alive for many years.

Horrrr.

It’s quite fun. This is my first season hitting plat in general and I kinda had a carry on my main so it’s nice I was able to “prove it” on my smurf.

It was t competitive tho that’s why it’s gone new Hereford is still not fun but it’s hell of a lot more competitive then that nightmare you want back
---
There hasn’t been any announcements for a new Rainbow Six game. In the past they’ve stated that they’d like to reach up to 100 operators. I imagine it’ll be supported for at least a couple more years. It’s still a massively popular game with a good following. I’d suspect we see another Ghost Recon or Splinter Cell game long before Rainbow Six. 
---
I played through release up until a few months back and it’s the most enjoyable multiplayer shooter I’ve played aside from the Battlefield games.

battleye is failing? should be able to detect obvious hacking like that.

The only good thing is the desert eagle at this point
---
Bitch I'm gold 4 and I'm just saying he said casual, why TF would you say casual if you know everyone else knows that it's almost impossible to do so
---
In not OP bud
---
If I was bad, then why would I say that you're retarded and said that this in casual
---
Did you know that casual doesn't goes to 5 rounds?
---
This is just luck, mate
---
I said this is casual because yall are noobs and play like casual
---
That made no sense but sure
---
Was dat a paladins quote?
---
I still dont get why they allow this.
---
Oh oh mate, thanks for the advice, but jackal still nerds a nerf. Cheers mate
---
Yes
---
Operator idea, wears two shields, one on chest one on back. No guns, ability is extra grenades.
---
What if Fuse blows out the lights and leaves everyone in darkness except for Glaz, Clash Blitz (have flashlight shields), and that new operator who can see in the dark?
---
Fuze is fine as he is.
---
Not even that, this gets reposted constantly.
---
That’s the gun you use when you don’t want to have fun PUSSY
---
Never mind. The fire rate is indeed capped on Buck's pistol and has been reported by other players, ubi just can't be bothered to do anything about it
---
Why isn't there a picture under the ban pic? It's just a big black rectangle.
---
Well, I can destroy the drone, rotate and flank the Ash, or Twitch whatever you said, but they will figure out If I try to flank them while pinged by jackal.
---
And i'm not holdimg angles, i almost never hold an angle, only if im inside the bombsite, when i room I often run around the map and then out of the blue jackal starts to track me and i am on the middle of the map, not geting killed is lucky or i have to figure out how to not get scape of that situation
---
Only Sweden and Finland uses ä among the  countries while Norway and Denmark uses æ
---
IP's are usually not static, it's simple to get a new one. You can either phone the ISP and request a new one (if yours is static DSL it's like 5 dollars here), or unplug your router for about 30 mins (If you are using Cable) and it will draw a new ip from the pool. This is mostly why IP banning does nothing in order to IP ban a single user you would have to blacklist an entire towns Cable IP range.
---
dont frequent this sub often. as I mentioned i play this game on and off. been playing it more recently
---
Seems like he wikipediad some useless unimportant text to me
---
Keeping that pesky ladder operator in check
---
yay-ger
---
Yup 😨
---
wasnt sure if i was going to be pushed immediately after killing thermite so I switched to the pistol but then got the call to defuse. I was going to go for the last kill.
---
It should update if you haven't altered the server stuff since it will go to "recommended" so you should be at 30-40 but if you want your same rank you're probably going to be closer to 100
---
It's not about preference, we pay more for our PC gear to get better quality gaming experience. I gaurantee if you tried a shooter with m+k on 144 hz you wouldn't say you prefered the "challenge"of a controller.
---
I got an even better call-out message yesterday "Echo in dat room"
---
&gt;Well, I can destroy the drone, rotate and flank the Ash, or Twitch whatever you said, but they will figure out If I try to flank them while pinged by jackal.
---
Im not talking about a drone just randomly pinging you. 
---
Gold and above entry players normally have a support player droning the room out for them while they are attacking into the room. Shooting the drone wont really help you cause they have your location (similar to a jackal ping).
---
If a jackal ping every 5s means you automatically gets killed, a drone will do the same to you. 
---
&gt;And i'm not holding angles, i almost never hold an angle, only if im inside the bombsite, when i room I often run around the map
---
Maybe reduce the amount of running and hold rooms/angles to slow down the attackers. Rotate into the room/area you wanna to roam in, set it up and stay in the room with a rotation available if you are getting pushed hard. 
---
This way if you do get tracked you know where you got tracked from so you have an idea of at least one of the attackers.
---
This needs to be a thing.
---
Legendary gear for sure.
---
You probably thought that way coz you can't understand our comms. 😅
---
Remind me to not run into the grass ever again
---
Oh yeah. They’re stupid expensive though. So now that I’m an adult living on my own, I would probably just go with an AR-10 as it’s way cheaper. 
---
But since I was 18 years old, working construction and living with my parents without any form of debt, I was able to buy one. It was like $3350 or something like that. But it was badass.
---
I mean...he's not wrong.
---
What's wrong with favelas ? I love it and the fact you can destroy pretty much everything
---
Germany uses Ä, Ö and Ü
---
nice trolling, it would be very funny to play under such pressure from own team, but sometimes it is good to have such option to surrender, because of very weak friendly team or when somebody from your team can't continue to play
---
it would have a dot to show he clicked if so
---
He forgot an important thing: never make a callout on the [ALL] chat channel
---
Yes please
---
I see. Gud fact there
---
I want to see this from Tchanka's perspective
---
&gt; My friend has a smurf account, but he only uses it so he doesn't have to worry about his rank.

You don't need to buy a second account to do that.

Matchmaking is suck. I am gold 3 and still matchmaking with unranked toxic troll kids. RIP my Elo. Thanks Ubi.

A museum like the 1st rainbow six game will be a good tribute.
---
BUG TRACKING TEAM ROLL OUT
---
It's either me panicking from a flanking roamer or the dots appear when I click and hold for a certain amount of time, like a second or something
---
I just stop playing with shields just because of this. This is happening way too much
---
&gt;I mean at that point I think it just wouldn’t be worth it for the dude + he did what he did because “impulse and struggling this season” if he did it to screw around and try it maybe try again, but there is no way he will have it easy again and at some point its gonna get difficult, and when it comes to cheating its hard to stop because it makes hard situations (in game) easy. Whats to say next time he struggles he doesn’t do it?
---
This was the first time ive ever cheating in an online video game, ever, and i hate that i did :/ Its not really a habit, i play cs and ow and never thought of hacking, i dont know why i did it in siege. But i guess im hwid banned this really sucks, i contacted customer service and apologised and requested to see if i could get the HWID ban lifted but they 'escalated' the ticket and i haven't herd from them since. Man this sucks, thanks for the help anyways though
---
The HUD is added on after as the "real" HUD at that point was probably an eyesore and not designed to look pretty yet but the game itself is likely running in game. In a pre-recorded demo they can edit out any crashes or performance hits that are caused not to mention that the actual release needs to run on console as well as lower end PCs. It's dishonest but I don't think it's CGI, the cinematic trailers we see in game cost an ungodly amount of money to make per second so instead having the developers put together a gorgeous looking build that will realistically never be released makes more sense.
---
probably a quick look up some stairs you were going up if i had to guess
---
I've seen this suggestion tossed around quite a bit, and I see its merits, but I'm not too sure how I feel about it tbh.
---
You do know that this can and will turn people away from this game we love. Im just trying to show light on a problem which shouldn't be that hard to fix (i think)

Only 1 speeds get the ACOG on defense. Castle is a 2 speed. I also feel like the ACOG is an overpowered sight. Many, many people disagree, and that's okay. Regardless, I don't want Siege balancing to become a matter of whether or not an operator should get the ACOG. But that's my 2 cents.
---
the longst game i've had was 9-10 it got really boring after a while, somehow we just kept shooting at the same time and hitting headshots, got a lot of fucking mmr tho.

The only thing making you suffer will be cav not picking up your armor

Yep, so the enemy didnt hear me. Didnt matter because he already knew were I was

Wow

Everyone already knows this, everyone experienced this, it's not that special. You're not revealing anything. Also it's pretty hard to fix, a matchmaking system os very complex, especially with premades.

I have elite Valk but there can't be 5 Valks in 1 team)
---
he  tricks the dude downstairs who is gonna runout that he is upstairs at the window, as this is a very good runout you can easily get kills on a lot of people do it. def. high iq. why would he place the breach charge down in the corner otherwise.

came here to comment this

Castle thrives in coordinated teams. Ubi has said time and time again that Castle is extremely viable with teams that communicate and have a plan. By himself though, he sucks. And the data shows that. He's in the same position as Clash. Both are a menace when used properly in a team setting. Almost worthless to a solo queuer
---
My mamá doesn't look like that, how dare you.
---
They wanted 1 blitz and 4 recruits, and just spam smokes. So we did that ez win.
---
Go for thunt classic, you can't have people screwing this one up.

I understand the frustration. But when you shoot a bullet, I believe there is a small range it spreads out and since you were at the tip of his head, the bullet flew a bit above.
---
*Stealth increased*

If you are fed up with people leaving and joining on going matches then stop playing casual, casual is there for people to drop in play and leave when they want. How many times have you been in a casual game and someone leaves but someone joins instantly and you are happy yet when it happens to you, then you are complaining. If it means so much to you play ranked it’s called fucking casual for a reason. Imagine actually complaining about the casual game mode it’s honestly ridiculous
---
First to six I believe

I would be 100% behind a big map rework (Hereford scale) for Favela. Could easily be the best map in the game in terms of setting and how it plays with a rework. Would be such a shame to miss out

I especially like the Britisch shotgun, the Russian shotgun and Ela's shotgun.

My Friends don't like it when I play kapkan or tachanka with shotgun.

Same way, add the German keyboard layout, download siege and hacks to play it on your smartphone. If this isn’t possible yet I had to summon basically Homeless.

That's really weird, might just need to reinstall whenever you're able to because I have no idea what else you could do besides maybe re rolling to a previous driver and see if that works but doubt it since you already tested it on two different updates

Never hit the head. Blaming the game for your aim mistakes will never make you better.
---
The only thing stopping them is the diamond 269 lvl smurf doc, that spawnpeeks 3 of you teammates as soon as the round starts.
---
Oh I'm sorry, my mind just blanked. I'll have to try this out and see cause that's really weird if that's the case
---
More effective to just TK you or critically damage you now. Plus by not doing it now, the tacit agreement between the devs and the TK community is the former pretends not to know and won't patch those trolling methods while the latter restricts themselves to the trolling method of the day.
---
Both benefit. Trolls get to continue to troll. Devs appear to be responsive as they attempt to patch the exploit of the day.

I play casual because it’s rare that I can be sure I’ve got a solid half hour in case a ranked match goes long. Don’t want to piss off the ranked folk. It’s also dinner stuffing around with mates in casual. But sure there’s something that can be done to stop being thrown into a match for a half minute of game play.
---
Who cares you fuck
---
Äh I see

Well, it is quiet nutty posting this unspectacular ace multiple times I guess..

Get a cheap external drive, install windows and r6 on it, boot from the external-drive, disable all "old" (flagged) ones and have (legit) fun again.
---
As far as I know it should require ps plus as it is an online game. You may want to check it has definitely expired.

well depends on the reason for the disconnect.

crash? well this will take some time

literally a disconnect? hit ranked again and you are back asap

they just do a ranked matchmaking, 99% of time it will reconnect to the actual match.
---
Yup, I'm sure of it. I don't even have a second user on my ps4. Not that I'm not happy about it ahah. Only siege works, if I try to play another game (destiny,gta,mwr) it won't let me.

i have an SSD and HDD, windows on ssd and everything else on HDD, if i replace JUST the HDD, will that work? Or will I need to replace both or just the ssd? If its both i might as well use your external drive idea

Nice construction wall u got !

happens every season. So, with the addition of year 4 season 2, all the operators from season 2 of year 1,2 and 3 will get a decrease

Thanks man, i just wish i was allowed to buy a new account to play normally without HWID getting me banned

Ok

The person who left and rejoined every game was playing legion. You would bring the health of the hostage down to nothing, then you would throw a gu mine and leave before the gu mine activated. I went from gold 3 to silver 2 because I got people doing this shit.

A 30 round mag with a high ROF and meh damage, showoff
---
I hope. I want to start maiming bandit
---
yea, i definitely see your point, but playing against him, i feel it is really easy to kill him
---
Yes legit
---
With regards to the 'just drone more' they mean that you drone the places you are going. Drone angles, door ways, room corners. Drone anywhere you intend to go before you enter until you learn the most common areas people play. Biggest help for me was learning operators gun sounds and gadgets, most trap operators will be your biggest enemy on attack, biggest tip for defence would be don't be afraid to hold back, don't over peek things as you have the advantage most of the time on defence. Hope this helps :)
---
ALT/CMD/CTR + F4
---
It seemed like they took full damage because it killed them outright, but it's possible that it was reduced and they still died
---
This is pretty old news at this point..
---
Yes it's legit, the animation and everything else has been leaked already.
---
Yes.
---
Yep hard breach windows basically
---
Do you have trench medic?
---
I'm a bandit main but I couldn't pull this off. I'd be switching to my pistol after the 2nd kill.
---
its to support their body against the surface they are against, just think if your standing near a corner or in a door frame and are talking to someone for a long time you will want to put your hand up against it to support yourself.
---
Which pixel do I look at?

Hello game ?

Game machine broke

Understandable have a great 1v4

Just turn your Keyboard on German😂😂

AFK recruit in spawn, it's legit
---
You do realize you can download clips to your phone from the app.
---
but the rank show a representative of it as he team up with high gold too.  
---
as I said the matchmaking is broken but some gold-plat are boosted so they not deserve their rank.
---
Oh well, big f to them I guess.

I think we could purchase it when new pro league season starts

Hope we get it soon

Took armor doesn’t give you any hp, it’s just allows you to get downed. If you pick one up again you can get downed again
---
love the bags

No I've never been sick of that. It happens to me all the time and it makes me happy.
---
Wait fr
---
Plat on PC is good, at least for me
---
Same I’m on console and it’s even better when it’s ur friend
---
Ran out of teammates to down so she switched teams
---
Nope woth it bullets do less damage
---
Rushing has given me experience when It comes to headshots
---
Oh God.
---
Ok so you think just because it’s not bad for you that it’s the same for others? I’ve seen that there was loads of people at the start of the season saying that they hate the new POV because the hit reg has been so bad for them.. even my friends say that headshots just aren’t a thing in this game anymore because of how fucked up the hitboxes are.
---
Getting 4 kills with one magazine with the MP7 is even more impressive than the clutch
---
Funny thing is there is no cav on your team comp
---
on defense play ops with gadgets that support the team, such as jager, bandit, rook, theres a lot of them and avoid ops like cav and pulse because their only role is fragging while an op like maestro for instance, has better bulletproof cams. Just be supportive of your team and eventually your aim will improve and you will have a hint of map layout
---
Your idea is good, Mav is so powerful. And the orange outlined is a great intel.  
---
The reinforcement is situationnal too as it works on certain map only.
---
Dayum. *Nice*.
---
Pretty sure it gives more armor as well, no?
---
I hope so. We get two elites by season. One on the beginning of it, and the second one some weeks after the mid season reinforcement.
---
The platforms passed by some fixes last week.
---
its 1/2 derankers/trolls

1/4 people who have been brought down by derankers

1/4 people who just suck

you can guess who I got paired with

In the echo clip I definitely shot his head, my sights was on his head when the trigger was pulled and he pulled back and then shot me, so it didn’t look like I shot his head, but I definitely did.

It is fun. I believe you can get away with a meme strat. If i can that are bronze 4 you can do it as well.

Bro what if an op, once a round could put into the kill feed that (s)he was dead? So on ui they were but they could still do shit

Glad I could make someone laugh :)

Cool

Ahhhh so you're one of they guys, the I've played more than you and am a higher rank so everything you say is irrelevant. So you're either 14 at most or a moron...
---
I can confidently say by your comments on this post alone I have a much larger grasp of how this game should be played, regardless of how well I can execute it. Answer this for me, in a 4v4 situation what's more beneficial? One teammate on 100 HP and the rest on 20 HP or everyone on 60 HP? I know what the right answer is as a Doc main, and I know your answer is something along the lines of "who care's, fuck my team it's all about me."

Grow up, you might have 4 to 5 times more elo than me if you do.

and introduce endless power creep? no thank you...

As much as people might beg to differ, Terrorist Hunt can help you out a lot. 
---
When defending in TH, you learn to listen for certain sounds. You can easily identify where the enemies are, where they are going, and what they're doing. Placing breach charges, shields, all that Jazz. 
---
You can also attempt to play Terrorist Hunt on the hardest mode, and that'll whip you in shape if you're a beginner. After you fail for the first 5 times, it teaches you to go slow, check corners, drop shot even, and navigate properly.
---
If you have no interest in starting out this way, and would rather try to hone some skills or tricks, most of what I do to ensure a match win, or just easy things I focus on:
---
If you know someone is in a hall/room etc., if you peek the doorway while leaning, and you see them, run out from the doorway and immediately lean the other way. They always expect your body to match with the first way you leaned. You can also drop shot, by just immediately falling to the ground and shooting them. Casual is known for "Spray and Pray"ers so this gets them all the time.
---
If defending, Roam. If you want to be a roamer, best to pick someone lightweight. Cav, Bandit, Jaegar, etc. Some have more strat with this than I do, but most of the time, I just run to a random part of the building as a match starts. I'll hide in a corner and check cameras real quick, and then proceed to just sit and wait. 9 times out of ten I always manage to come across a loner entering from that section, while I'm waiting. After that, I'll make my way back to the room we are protecting, and if you're quiet, you can usually easily find and sneak up on the offensive Team with their backs to you, and you can just pick off a couple, try a new way, pick off another, etc. 
---
Cameras. Know where they're at. As defender, will be helpful to see where the enemies are and where they're going. You can usually find a second way and cut them off or sneak up behind them. On offense, good to know so you can take them out.
---
Listen. Your ears are your friends. Like I said about TH if the others aren't so quiet, you can easily tell where they are at and what they're doing. Offense or Defense. When playing offense, I easily find Cav when I listen for someone checking cameras. Usually this part I just get lucky to stumble across her hiding spot, but I always hear the sound of her picking up the phone/camera checking right next to me. And I'll use it to my advantage to take her out. If defending, and in the room, I just listen for footsteps. Normally they're a little loud at first, but then they go quiet. If I can tell which door they're approaching, I'll wait a few seconds after the footsteps go quiet, and then shoot at the barricade. Got a lot of penetration kills doing that.
---
Blending in. The obvious. If you got green, laying on something green might give you a spare second while the enemy tries to figure out if Your mass is a person or odd graphics. My trick is laying with dead bodies that have similar colours to my operators clothes. Spares me a few valuable seconds most of the time.
---
Distractions. This one is rather risky. When using Thatcher, or another Breach charge operator, I get as close as possible to the room we need to go in. I'll place a breach charge on a barricade and run away to another point of entry, when I make my way to a different entrance of the room, I'll blow the breach charge, to make the defenders think I'm over that way, and then peek in and shoot who I can or enter and hide and watch the entrance around where I blew the charge.
---
Twitch. Yes the operator. This is just me, but the first drone I strictly use for gadgets and cameras only. Make them blind at the start. And the second drone I use when my teammates are close to the room to actually shock enemies. I stay outside, just in case, but using the drone, I find the enemies, scan them and shoot to distract so my teammates can catch them off guard while the enemies scramble to kill my drone.
---
Teammates. While sometimes helpful, they can completely blow a match for you. What I'm talking about isn't just them playing the game. I'm talking about ones with mics. I find if someone is kind of talking throughout the while match, it's better to mute them. Seems more often than none, they're the ones who will try to tell you what to do and how to play the game, when they're dead and you're alive, and in the end get you killed. I just mute and focus. If there are others, but are silent, I don't mute them. Sometimes I do get the hero of the day where a silent teammate will cut in and tell me that the enemy is in such room or is in the hallway to the left on the ground. These people I appreciate, because they don't scream at you to rush in or hurry up and shoot the guy or yell at you that he's "right there" when you have no idea where they're talking about. Obviously this isn't always guaranteed, but I'm speaking from my own experience.
---
Oh, and as a last one that's more helpful than a trick, if I'm on Offense, at the start of that match, I never immediately run to the building. I'll give it a moment or two before I move. Maybe I'm a jerk for it, but I let my teammates run out first and basically be bait. People still do a lot of spawn killing, so if my teammates make it to the building without any sort of gunshots or dying, I know I'll be 97% safe for the time being.
---
Stuff you can try and practice I guess. I feel like just having good aim and being quiet doesn't always get you the win. Sometimes you have to be creative, play a little different, find tactics that work for you, shit like that. I found most of these tactics from playing with other people. I just took notice of things they did, tried it out and mastered it. But in the end, you could play one way, and win and play the exact opposite way and still win.
---
It doesnt sound like a lot but the win percentage of teams with rook as opposed to teams without is bigger than that of any other operator at high plat/diamond level. So quite the opposite
---
I’ve met 12 year olds nicer then the guys that sound in their 30s that say the rudest shit to me
---
Its because they dont like girls beating them in a game
---
Try it on a free weekend
---
Then they should just get better
---
People will queue with lower ranks to get into lower ranked matches. The system works that way.
---
Also depends on the console you're on. I get a mixed crowd when I play with my female friends
---
I’m on Xbox
---
For some reason i thought you were high ranked, like gold 2+. Because some high ranked people i have meet in other games are mocking people for low ranks. And i don't mess around in ranked, only in casual.
---
I still feel like secure area feels more arcady instead of competitive. Just because there can be some situations where its more a test of patience rather then skill.
---
Unless you see patience as a skill
---
That semi explains it. My girlfriend is on Xbox and experiences that same thing.
---
People are just assholes. It’ll never stop because there are no real consequences. There’s even a girl on YT that made a series out of dudes harassing her &amp; team killing her on R6 because it happens so often.
---
I'd like to see you do that with one mag of an mp7
---
Wait... that's illegal
---
Lol, I don't care about my ranked. And lots of people at low ranks are also people who purposely deranked and m870 recruit is actually viable
---
Tachanka Good choice
---
I just ignore it but if it goes too far I will say something
---
It's the best you can do
---
This is a first person shooting game... we also already had a university campus. I get what you’re trying to say, but it’s not like it’s a simulator...
---
Ah. I forgot about the update that did that
---
They’re both still active I believe
---
As other others have said - Rook armor will guarantee that a defender will go down (except from headshots with bullets). Attackers don't have this option, so especially if you were a 1 armor operator, being close enough to that explosion will kill you outright.
---
I’ve had 3 aces in the last week with him
---
His is the guy who types GG EZ at the end of the game after going 0-5
---
GOD I'M GLAD I'M NOT ALONE. I can't tell you how irritating it is to hear grown men ask me if my man knows that I'm playing his game....
---
Sorry :(
---
Didnt see your shitty plat 3 post. If you are proud of that, thats a joke. My ways work. Its been working for 3 years and getting my 1k-2k points past diamond every season. Why would i stop roaming with doc bc some plat 3 told me to? I guarentee i also have 3 to 4 times more play time on doc than you. Clearly you cant keep your team healed if youre stuck in plat.
---
It so stupid what’s the point of doing it? Can some guys not accept that girl can be good and/or better than you at a video game?
---
You have to wait in the queue and it should still connect you to the same match
---
Yeah. If this is in casual then nothing you can do about besides play ranked.
---
But you realise some shotguns have lethal range of 35m with default buckshot?
---
Also, I mean like a grand hotel that was in the other games.
---
I get told to give my boyfriend back his controller and go back to the kitchen! Like wtf? It even happens in ranked
---
Wot you mean. Im a bit of an idiot so please dont get mad at me for asking.
---
Microsoft doesn't actively ban anyone for MnK lol. The system that xbox uses allows 3rd party devices and it CANT detect them therefore there is absolutely no proof someone is using MnK. Sure you can capture a video of people using it and them with a super shaky screen and fast movements but if you actually know how the xim works it is using controller inputs. Therefore anything that a person using MnK on console with an adapter, the same movements can be done using a controller with the right sensitivity settings even though its impractical to use them with sticks. Ive been playing the game since the beta and have been a diamond for 9 straight seasons now and I know people who have been using the Xim 3, Xim4, and now the Xim Apex for over 3 years. Not once have I ever heard of anyone ever getting banned for MnK because they literally can't detect it and they can't tell. They won't ban someone for a simple video of them moving around and aiming differently in game as for my reasons stated above. Anyone who say you can get banned are just people who think something can be done but nothing can. MnK on consoles attracts more players and if it attracts more players it brings in more money. Therefore MnK will not be banned and I think in the next generation we will see native support for it from Microsoft and Sony.
---
It works yes. And what's up with the "Lol" by the way.
---
It happens in ranked more than casual...
---
honestly if you cant outreact them easiest and quickest way is to out aim them. there are things you can do to work ok reflexs (aimbooster and kovaks aim trainer)
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
I try not to be because I actually want to play the game not screw around and I usually just report and block and move on
---
Do you aim with your wrist or with your arm?
---
I don’t solo queue often I only do if I have to but this is what happens when I do

No no no you have it all wrong, he's always 1000+ elo past diamond so we can't even talk to him and whatever he says goes. We are of an inferior species to this god like creature.

I really don’t understand why is this even a thing, like you have as much right to play games as us boys but it’s pathetic to see kids who are toxic. Don’t let it get over you.. just focus on the better part and next time if someone is toxic just clap their cheeks.
---
Had a fun Sunday afternoon playing Siege.
---
I don’t it’s just annoying
---
Well it's true that I'm a little angry when playing fps and. Maybe the fact that i'm angry and can't concentrate makes me slow and the slnowness makes me angry. That could be something.
---
Thanks!
---
Wrist
---
If it makes you feel any better, I was Take every round in a ranked game after the first two rounds BECAUSE I was top fragging.  People are always going to be assholes, just gotta find a squad who are less toxic to play with.
---
&gt;The fix is currently on Tts.
---
The patch notes don't mention this. Are you sure?
---
It’s sad how salty people can be
---
I don't see any difference, they all make big fucking holes
---
When someone has rook armor as long as they dont get headshot they go down instead of just dying
---
That's a dirty ace
---
Yeah those que times would be insane at certain times of the day for some people. And I respect your opinion but I don't think they should split up ranked into subcategorys for now at least for that same reason again
---
Neither is your aim 👌🏼
---
I don’t think it’s even lag anymore the hit detection is just fucking dog shit
---
yeah whenever i play i try to do full fiveman teams so that way we dont have toxic people, if you want to add me to play with someone whos not toxic my uplay name is frezbear lmao

You can't. I'm on PC btw
---
I guess ill just spend more time frustrated at siege for giving me golds that play like coppers. While the other team has diamonds and "silvers" that play like diamonds
---
Ah i love this game lol
---
But thank you I appreciate that!
---
That’s what net code means lol
---
Jackal is like one of the most balanced characters in the game. His guns aren't too strong but aren't the worst either. And his ability is fine where it's at. He also has the lowest win delta as of current. Quit being a salty baby and learn how to counter him.
---
if there's one thing that I've learned while being a bandit tricker is that you have to be really fucking precise, I don't even wanna talk about how many times I've been ass blasted by thermite charges.
---
Yeah I feel ya on that, the enemies are always better than their ranked and teammates are usually kinda a joke
---
That was dope!
---
Nah i use toggle, why?
---
The only way I think you could reset is by buying a new game. Luckily though ranks reset every season (when the next set of operators come out). I don't know how anyone would get out of the troll fest that is copper if they didn't. I also believe ranks don't carry over depending on regions so if you feel like playing on servers from a different continent that's a thing people do.
---
Depends on there maturity. I don’t really care on what they are like. It’s just a game in the end. To waste/pass time. Get you away from reality.
---
whomst the fuck plays secure in ranked
---
nice kills though

So like, you place the mirra window, and then if a drone rolls up on it the spider takes control?
---
you're pretty bad at following your own directions.
---
Welp, which way do I go fuck myself then?
---
Exactly I use siege  and CoD as anger outlets not to get grossed out by pervs with nothing better to do
---
Anyone get that awesome glitch where your operator has the mind of its own? Absolutely love it...
---
The UK, but my internet was having a moment. I live an area with a horrible connection (only 2mbps download) and sometimes my ping just spikes.
---
Sounds like Battlefield Hardline already did that.
---
That will always be better and not even related to the game.
---
*ptoo*
---
But with the last buff/rework, Capitao cant kill across floors or walls isnt?
---
It's my baby of course she would adapt
---
t a c h o c o l a t e s
---
U also forgot the part where pulse has a revolver in his pistol holster
---
As my friend would say “time to ring some ears”
---
They're every three months...
---
Besides teammates destroying your armor you’ll be fine
---
i dont think you understand the issue, the adapter tricks the console to think its a controller so if you made mnk servers the people currently using mnk would still play against controlelr players cause the game thinks is a controller
---
That have made their stance clear, they said it’s cheating. As the other dude said there’s no way to do it properly. A battleye type of client can’t detect it, and an individual review process would not be a good idea either. While MnK is very prominent a lot of the accusations people make are not legitimate, I’ve been accused of MnK several times before, which I don’t use. Even if someone can be proven guilty, how do you ban them? Account ban? On Xbox you can just make a new one for free and using your home Xbox hop right back on (idk about psn I don’t own one). IP bans? Ineffective and overly effective at the same time. There’s often multiple people playing on a single IP, dorm rooms, roommates, etc. It’s also not difficult to get a VPN which I believe (I’m not sure don’t rip me if I’m wrong) can get around IP bans. Ubi’s helpless, it’s not their fault, people are just toxic
---
Probably but what is up with legendary skins looking like cardboard boxes
---
We’re a little over two months in right?
---
The giant ass ship from star wars
---
I'm not claiming to be "so good". I never even said that, you just made that up lol. I'm talking about individual instances where I just happen to be playing well, often due to me using an operators utility well. I'm sure you can understand how annoying it is to be playing pulse for example and using your scanner below the objective effectively, then next round someone instantly picks him, runs outside at the start of the action phase and gets killed instantly lol. Same thing happens all the time when bandit tricking.
---
Improvise adapt overcome
---
I'm pretty sure they designed her this way so she's more effective in a close quarter combat and can't snipe people like she used to
---
Toss in an Echo and you got yourself the four horsemen of the apeekalypse.
---
welcome to siege :/
---
Well played
---
Pretty sure we have like a month
---
Damn, I can hear the sweats trickling down your back during that play
---
I play on PS4 European servers and unfortunately only like 5% of players speak, and only 5% of them talk English. But yeah I appreciate your civil-ness.
---
You new here or something?
---
Season 9 Pro League Finals are May 18 and 19. During that time they’ll do their new season reveal and following that they’ll have the TTS available for 2-3 weeks (maybe 4, I believe it was changed). Then if everything goes right the new season will release. I’d say around June 4th or 11th
---
You could probably find people in the R6 discord, it has it's own eu section and PS4 section so all you would need to do is search for people that spoke English

Wait did they flat out kick all of you from the game? Or did they do the thing where they can make it take forever to load and eventually the enemy team leaves
---
Instead of runout. I think that's is useful info

Varsity gaming JUST released an "operator mastery" of lesion, and his operator mastery videos are always on point.

BTW would it be ok to use this video on best of the week special on a YT channel? I'll greatly appreciate it.
---
I was actually looking at this a few weeks ago and I got so mad for some reason. They also have flax on defense on the old Hereford with a FAL
---
3 of our 5 got kicked from the match, i tried to rejoin and got the ban, after i couldn’t reconnect they kicked the rest of my team off too.
---
She's  training to  beat the crap out  of who  took  her  aim(BCS there can only be one aim for Ash).
---
He can, there is a video on it.
---
Unrealistic. 
---
Cav’s pistol should be pushing Buck’s skull into his other shoulder.
---
See a few jump scares in there....
---
U meen how 3 clash idiot

Its a glitch and it is legit, only works on tower though

Dont think so, I think I saw it just after or near the end of white noise

The walls are alive. You can never be to careful
---
How large is that? Can you give something for scale?
---
Part of Ela's identity is that she's high risk, high reward when it comes to her guns. If you cripple the recoil but give her a smaller clip, what distinguishes her gun from the dozens of high fire rate smgs? (T-5, MP7, MPX, MP5, to name a few.
---
Lol think of the teamkills
---
I only have played on console, so can’t speak to the pc, but it’s in the running for my favorite shotgun in the entire armory. It’s an absolute monster and feels responsive as hell.
---
Yeah I'm on console, for me, FO-12 9/10 times. I've tried to like the scorpion so many times, but it just feels too random to land a headshot and not enough damage to win gunfights with bodyshots.
---
ItsEpi was completely wrong about licensed devices not working. The licensed device for PS4 plugs in and works just like it is advertised. 
---
ItsEpi is either ignorant or intentionally misleading people. Either way, he likely shouldn't be believed just because he said something.
---
not really, since ‘overpowered’ becomes the standard, but not all overpowered things are equal. Echo is overpowered, but he isn’t a patch on prime lion, blackbeard or glaz
---
Oh Im stupid, nvm

Agreed very much
---
If it's an option, you might try Xbox.  There are other problems (smurfs, MnK, lack of communication), but verbal toxicity is much less common than on PC.  Or maybe it's just easier to avoid since everyone sticks to party chat.
---
Im stupid and for some reason the text didn't show up....

The link if u want to see the company who makes these is [https://www.reconrobotics.com/products/legacy-products/](https://www.reconrobotics.com/products/legacy-products/)

Im sry bout my stupidity
---
Vigil and cav on defense, both good roamers and fun to play. On attack you should get jackel or maverik, both can be played tactical or just used for rushing
---
which base ops are your favorites?
---
He would have gotten you if he faced it the other way or did it from the other side of the window. Good kill though
---
Me exactly 1 hour ago. Except , i ran into Cav's pistol through my mouth ...
---
I used to use kapkan with suppressed SASG-12, now I create more chaos with Elas suppressed FO-12
---
I'm almost there...
---
Because I think that there’s no need for these when they could be working on more important things like client side breaching and body’s  and  the ddosing
---
I've never seen this before
---
AFAIK the people that make the adapters push out counter measures anytime a game tries using the inputs to prove m/kb. Fortnite was detecting xim users and kicking them from the lobby a while back because WASD is completely perpendicular and does not mimic an actual analog stick very well. It wasn't long before they patched around it by making the inputs not go completely straight.
---
There is nothing they can do lol
---
I know it's not, but I'm just saying blatent cheating/glitching is more rare on console. And chill tf out, even though I play on PC I still play on console some and I know what kinda hell it is
---
my friend , this was posted before like 2 years ago
---
this post is marked "Fluff" not "discussion" I walked into here knowing what I was kinda expecting
---
Smurfs?
---
Vigil and cav good roamers. I like roam with Mozzie aswell but wherever you want
---
Do you have like 2 ping
---
I think a tracking system could help. For example, there is two accounts made on one IP, one is was say a gold 1 and the other is level 15, if the gold 1 was recently banned and the other accounts activity spiked it would result in both accounts being banned permanently or temporary for the lower leveled account (for potiental new players sake). An account can have up to 3 moves in IP (for players who try to use a vpn to go around the system). For players who leave due to a losing game, let an account have 5 freebies each month, passing it would result in a temporary ban and sticks to the account. I think it would stop smurfs but I know that this isnt that great of a solution reading it back.
---
Bandit, pulse on defense
---
Iq, Thatcher on attack
---
Maybe bought an account and just sucks?
---
Nice editing
---
Just a btw I'm online rn
---
Abandons don't count against win loss, so he leaves when he is about to lose and so it drops his rank hence the copper 2 but doesn't count as a loss hence the 89 w/l
---
Got a gta resupply mission to do and I’ll probably be on

There are a bunch of nerds in this forum omg, his ability sucks and he needs a nerf, I bet you guys play r6 all day

And the 200-300 ping...

No its really legit coreross made a video on them with ingame pics check it out
---
If you think thats impressive you havent seen rook break dancing
---
you cant hack on console
---
REEEEEEREEEEEEREEEEEEE
---
Git Gud
---
Graybeard.
---
He doesn't have a gun shield, or even a gun, but he does have a cane that he thwhack people with for 420 damage
---
Eww, lesion. Trust me, stop playing him, he is hated and bad. Plz stop
---
Does it have to be the LMG or would the AR work too?
---
Yeah I literally already uninstalled and got a refund, thanks anyway.
---
&gt;and PC has no Sony/MS of its kind to sponsor anything yet competitive leagues are a thing.
---
Okay? You're kind of stupid, eh kiddo?
---
&gt;I remember R6 xbox proleague back in 2016 (?). Hilarious and sad at the same time. Videoclips from those matches are still all over the internet as an example of a shitshow FPS on consoles could be.
---
No need to lie about this you embarrassing autist. You're going to be a sad embarrassment regardless. 
---
Enjoy the hackers, btw :)
---
Thats a very common tactic
---
Can you post a video of how it is suppose to look I'm curious now
---
No, sorry bud, haven't played in weeks. But now that we're making assumptions let me guess that you're likely in Bronze and you have no idea how to counter abilities.
---
here we go again  
---
Comparing Scorpion to MP7, we have :
---
MP7 dealing more damage per bullet, resulting in higher DPS overall.
---
MP7's recoil is much more manageable for more than just CQB fights.
---
MP7's firerate is still high enough to compete with Scorpion in terms of OHS potential.  
---
So, what is rewarding in using Scorpion? It's high risk, low reward weapon ATM.
---
Thanks.
---
The guy below claims that its impossible, but it can't be a coincidence that everything is fine until the attack starts. The whole server starts to lag both attackers and defenders.
---
This is r6s and you’re watching disney channel. 
---
**BANG BANG BANG**
---
&gt;ad hominem all the way
---
Okay, bud, I wasn't trying to hurt your feefees.
---
If it runs on batteries, I'll see it
---
Why do you not like it?
---
he probably hits the server when he's about to lose
---
Anyone mind telling me the average effective range? It's the one reason I don't use shottys. With how many ways I die I usually pick something more range flexible.
---
Which gun is Mute even carrying? Doesn't look like an mp5k or shotty to me
---
Oh no this is quite the common sight especially on bomb 😅
---
Looks like your mouse has some ink leaking.
---
If you play mnk on a cobsole you dont make me mad, just dissapointed...
---
Sorry man but he is right. I mean its kind of funny but its also being a dick.
---
I feel this Caveria in my soul. ***"BEHIND YOU, BITCH."***

Stop looking for attention. No one cares if you are female or not.

That's awesome! Be sure to post that when it's done!!
---
Do you know how much the PS4 siege community hates MnK?              
---
Just use controller on PS4 or mnk on a PC.Don't EVER use mnk on PS4
---
Yes I have every single operator expect gridlock
---
not gonna say it, not gonna say ittt..........THICCCCC
---
Sorry if i made u disappointed 😞
---
Ok but they’re not universal. Are you looking at Fuze, Ash, Buck, Kapkan, and smoke specifically
---
Yeah the title makes no sense, I just tought of something stupid then put it in the title
---
Ash main on mnk and console.  Well done boys.
---
Tbh you get better as you get more game time. Im still shit 100+ hours in but eh. Just dont go to mnk its classed as cheating by ubi.
---
That sucks
---
That means a lot to me thank you!!
---
So you pee sitting down?
---
No.
---
I Don't Know What to Say to this.

I have lion which Had a biohazard outfit I never got it it’s the in my outfits when I check

You played with hackers on your team on a couple occasions. Sorry. Even if you didn't realize it, that's the way this thing works.

What do you mean unlucky?

I would just delete this post and maybe also the game if I were you.

Bill Gays is the richest

Rogue-9 on YouTube did a really good analysis of both weapons.

That was just idiotic to

I did but my guess is they already had one.

Fuck you.
---
Fuck you too
---
For lurking the p10. Bit if you’re playing mostly on sight to or in a unrelated room to hide and play in drone I like the commando 9
---
It’s official
---
You aren’t getting worse, you’re just playing against better people, so you probably are improving
---
Not the best, but it is pretty amazing. There are stll flaws with it, but still amazing.
---
Ubi can.  They cannot detect MnK usage directly.  However, it should be possible to write programs that look for suspicious behavior (basically write code that checks for the clues you see).  It might be tough to hit the sweet spot where it catches enough MnK users to seriously curtail MnK usage without catching lots of non-MnK users.
---
In general, I think the main problem is the risk/cost of action is more easily quantifiable for Ubi than the risk/cost of inaction.
---
I just got a double that exact same way.
---
It gives you random Y2 OP
---
Take a couple days off, then come back. A break has helped me, especially when I’ve been doing a lot of grinding
