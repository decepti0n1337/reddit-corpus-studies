Right? Lol

---
---
Bruh I want to get either one but I can’t decide on which one that’s why I made this post
---
the post shows the attacker weapon leak for 2 seasons ahead. 
---

---
you said “yo next season is going to have some many weapons.” 
---
i said this is a leak for 2 season ahead. not next season like you said. 
---
you then keep on trying to tell me it’s for 2 seasons ahead when i told you that 10 times. I explain myself and you just don’t read.
---
Go for both then
---
Good question, i guess no because he is already a reflection but his suit block/invert it
---
Don’t share anything ever.
---
Probably one of those gold players who finally made it to plat 3 and think they are the shit and above the pleb ranks of gold.
---
Oh. You might wanna gain some experience before posting.
---
How is that gun name said? Boss-Gee? Or Bosog? Or just every letter individually?  I wish it was like Bo-Sog ACog
---
How have you even manged to get 3 legendary in the time that the Jackal set was released? Jesus, I have gotten legit 4 legendary in playing this game for almost two years.
---
I think OP meant that you can't buy it from the shop. Only way to get it is through packs

---
Who do you play more?
---
It has 2 shots and requires you to hit your shots, the DMR is still gonna be better
---
Humour me. How would they manage to rework Hereford better than they did? I’m generally curious as to what answer you could possibly give me.
---
How dare you, the karma farmers promised me I could post it tomorrow!
---
Probably, I've reached plat III many times and always drop out but from my experience Plat is easily the most toxic rank.
---
You can use the shotty like a silent buck or use the fmg to rush 
---
I always go whit my teammates when entering the building beacuse if they get down by a cav or a roamer i can help and later i start to search roamers or to sneak in the objective 
---
And you have to know the maps and drone a lot if you go lone wolf whit her but i dont recommend it in the first's minutes of the match
---
Nah played last night and got a game further
---
Call of Duty trickshoter more to me.
---
Yes.
---
Alternatively, for next April fools, an entire week where the only playable map is tower.
---
Caveira.
---
i pronounce is Baus-Gee basically, not really “BOSS GEE”
---
then i mean, ACOG is always “A-COG”
---
You get the charm for whatever rank you hit the highest and it doesnt matter if you drop
---
Listen kid, I dont want no shit rework, I want it back, the old and pure hereford base.
---
That makes no sense.
---
Why does putting my face near the gun tighten the spread? Why does shooting fast widen it? Why does a shitty laser pointer also tighten it?
---
Shotguns make no sense in this game.
---
You get the highest rank you earned that season
---
no
---
The highest rank you achieve is the charm you get.
---
:(
---
So you get the charm at the end of the season?
---
Yea
---
Wait that could be used to see into waiting room next to customs, as well as the storage thats right next to it, this is potentially very powerful information if you walk on the other wall a couple meters more
---
people who are angry about the bosg getting an acog are deluded and are anti-consumer.
---
players from all walks of the game wanted it. and saying "oh this means they should give the german defenders acogs sksksksk" is a gross leap in logic.
---
simmer down. take a step back and think about why your mad a 2 round dmr-shotgun is getting an acog on both attack and defence.
---
Highest rank in season.
---
It having 2 shots is irrelevant, it still does more damage than any gun in the game.
---
“Listen kid”, it’s a shite map with no sense of balance. Put away your rose tinted specs, okay?
---
dude recruit memes are hilarious
---
I think there's just 2 Aug A2s now. One that has an ACOG available for IQ and one without for Wamai. IIRC one of the reasons why they didn't want to make new weapons was due to the ever increasing file size, not entirely sure if that's true if they're duplicating guns now.
---
Even if day I get in gold and I drop down to silver I still get the gold charm?
---
Nah I’m going to go 1 attacker and 1 defender not 2 defenders and I’m going to get Hibanas one
---
I mean it's not impossible
---
They have ok hitboxes but the best servers I can easily play with my friends in Brasil even tough I live in the EU
---
No kid, screw balance, I would choose fun over balance any day.
---
Yes they can but 2weeks for verifaction from sony/xbox is to long, test server is only 3weeks with like 3-4updates so there is no time for consoles.
---
&gt; emulator-esc
---
It's "esque"
---
Nah it’s pretty bad honestly and she had a high ban rate so nah
---
Sadly people are quite petty and they need to protect their pride instead of swallowing it these days
---
It’s really not, having 2 shots mean if you don’t kill the person within 2 shots then you’re dead, and it kicks so much that you can’t spam the two shots either, and it has a high drop off rate and the dmr is also a 2 shot kill and has 14 shots instead of just 2
---
A lot of luck and a lot of faith and you’ll get one of your own. :)
---
Why tho? Like yeah they are from Japan but do you have to be from Japan to be a weeb
---
Never :P
---
Know the maps if you solo queue (not good idea believe me)  always go for frags and rest well
---
And take it easy :)  is just a game and you can get back ur rank dont care is someone insults you because a mistake (take constructive critics)  and use t-hunt to practice your aim and found the perfect settings for you (sensivite, fov (if you use pc)  audio etc) and i will repeat it again sleep well so you can give your 100% in the match :)
---
I said I play lesion more but have black ice for both Docs mp5 and revolver
---
That’s a noice angle poor thermite got clapped harder than jfk
---
Yeah I should probably add that to the video
---
I think you’d be surprised
---
Well go play a non competitive game.
---
Well, if you play Lesion more, than get the Lesion Elite
---
Whit love a guy who was close to hit plat
---
Not really because both the K1A and the DMR are better options
---
Only has a high ban rate because people suck ass.

Where Ela and Blackbeard mains are oppressed.
---
True. Theoretical, reflex should be the best, as it gives you the most vision. However, aiming above the dot is so unnatural, as the center of the screen is the natural place of aiming, so reflex triangle makes you aim a tiny bit lower than the centre, which is what makes the sight less than Holo, which sucks as reflex take up the least amount of retail.
---
Wdym, it was balanced
---
Is this theme park?
---
IMAGINE PLAYING THIS GAME !!
---
you're late stop this shit
---
i can assure you on plat on console i have never really had a problem with Ela or ever seen her banned this most be a bronse thing.
---
I'm gonna agree. I've never had too much trouble with the Scorpion. Ela is unbeatable in close quarters with it, and 4-5 shot bursts will do the trick.
---
I kind of get the feeling the way they achieved the 2 variants of the AUG A2 for IQ and Wamai is basically having 2 different AUG A2's (basically a copy/paste). One with ACOG and one without ACOG. If this is how they did it, then we'd end up with a lot of redundant models/textures (etc.) that'd bloat the games file size.
---
idk . Maybe it's not ready for testing
---
Why did ela get a Nerf?
---
Shit . Could you teach me how you do this ?

As someone who mains Ela on defense and has Blackbeard as a secondary I can confirm this. Bottom Text.

They were realistic-ish in the very beginning, but since the entire fucking game plays within a real shotguns "Fuck you up six ways from sunday" range, they were kinda op.

Ok well the sit awareness and reaction time is about the same. We are just confined to a set fov, range of maximum motion, and ability to do multiple things at once. An elite controller may help, with the customizability of the sticks and button layouts but it's nowhere near PC, not worrying about things like deadzone, or having to move to line up some shots, which can expose you.

Can someone define what oppressed means in this sentence.

---
I’m not going to bother because clearly you refuse to look at what I’ve said. Christians should be looking at themselves with a Christian view and from that, no Christian is good. What is your definition of good? From moral or laws, I’m good! No law stops me from watching hentai, right? Only from the Christian point am I “wrong” or as we say “sinful”, so I point out that ALL are sinful. Don’t judge me with Christian standards without even knowing where that lies. The point is that it’s a bar so high you can’t achieve on your own. That’s why Jesus dies for you and me, He was killed so we didn’t have to for failing God and delving into sin. There, I’m glad you asked because I finally was able to say it. Don’t judge someone with a standard you yourself cannot follow, that no human can, and then say I’m a “bad” Christian. The point is, with the original point they judged me with, the Christian one, NO ONE is good. You cannot even judge me from a lawful or moral point

Read my comment on Christian point plz. I get mad pissed when I talk to hypocrites. I’m not BAD from a lawful point of view. I’m only bad from the Christian one. Yet everyone is bad from the Christian view, so I pointed that out. No one understands and that’s fine. But don’t come talking mad shit being hypocrites not even understanding which view you’re talking from

The original ops are no longer free, since the start of this year u have to buy them with renown, in y3 they were free

Looks beautiful :')

Deluxe edition for my friends also did this since you get like $30 of free content you have to work for the main ops
---
Huh, I wonder why they did that then, that blows
---
I had a teammate just always place his lesion mine on my frost mat, he took like 3-7 of my kills like that. So the last time he did it, I was just so pissed I shot him in the head. Do I regret it now yes, yes I do
---
Tell me, how was it op
---
gotcha, thanks
---
I wouldn't regret it, I stopped playing frost when I was online with 1 specific friend as he would always go lesion just to spite me

Serenity is missing by almost 1 year 🙁😩

The only reason why I say this is because playing siege for as long as I have with ranked and all it’s a challenge that I think equals out the better overall attackers

Ah sweet dude! Orion_Core is my user if you’re interested!! In teaching a noob! Haha

I dislike the fact they gave her and Glaz grenades. Like why? It’s pointless to put grenades on two of the strongest mid distance ops. Not only that Doki and Glaz have Smokes. Doki uses them to secure a plant on certain sites whilst Glaz uses his to smoke off rooms so he can look for enemies. 
---
If you give them grenades not only are you telling us “hey forget about objective play” you’re also telling us they’re meant to be CQC ops which when you look at the fact they both have long range primaries it’s such a joke. 
---
Could’ve given those grenades to maverick or thatcher or lion even. Don’t get me wrong Doki having grenades is great seeing as they’re a good secondary gadget. However I just don’t think bringing grenades is more important than that Doki bringing smokes and helping secure a plant. Grenades are only good for a few kills each round and that’s if you’re lucky. If they had different loadouts I could understand it.

Pretty much everything on the new season TS always makes it through, it's more of a bug testing phase. Only times where things are usually taken out are when Ubi launch a TS cycle midseason.

This is a fucking cursed title

Bruh what

If i had a penny everytime I saw a plat 3 with an anime pic...

It effects your hidden casual mmr

Not a single bullet was fired that round

I mean there wouldnt be any problem with this map IF THE SOUND actually WORKED the way it supposed to be. Right now you can hear someone on the railings on any part of the map literally.
---
If I hadn’t overheated when I did I probably would have died.
---
The paint looks like crap or is that just me
---
Its is a shotgun that fire slug round , so its can do a fatal bodyshot at 10m below and 60dmg  at long range up to 45m if i remember correctly . And its recently got acog on tts which increase the meme potential by 2 .
---
It was a meme Cannon.
---
Now it is a zoomed meme Cannon.
---
You'd be dummy dud to pick that over the Kia.
---
You heard me
---
How could you say somthimg so controversial yet so wrong
---
*soon*
---
How does it effect your ranked stats? So like if I'm gold 2 and I leave an unranked game does  it lower me to gold 3?
---
On console the Fo 12 desperately needed a nerf, the crutch option of shit simmers for the last two seasons. It could easily demolish 3 people at 8 meters without aiming down sights, which is a massive feat for controller players.
---
It would make more sense if they did the roll. People can jump off 10 story buildings with no injuries if they do the roll correctly..
---
I consider myself to be no.1, aka thermosniper Glazzy, and the bottom one, Mr. Bearded slugDMR.

Bucks elite better be a Mountie. And that’s coming from an actual Canadian btw

How is that even possible, how committed you have to be to level to level 20 with just recruit?

You can't it depends on how many players are on

Thats one of my mains right there ny boy cap 👌

Who cares, don’t promote him.

You could have just done bucks underbarrel shotgun
---
But kaid has one on his shotgun lol
---
This is worded poorly.
---
Kaid is getting a buff, but to his electroclaw, not the shotgun.
---
The acog shotgun they are talking about is the BOSG. It's just an oversight, if they used a comma between kaid and acog shotgun it would have been more clear.
---
Every time i send tge link reddit delets it sorry

Yess
---
No you survive with 5 health
---
That smg is the definition of a lazer. last thing it needs is an acog.
---
Basically a dmr tho
---
Are you seriously suggesting that there are less than ten people playing the tts at any given time? I refuse to believe that until we get some kind of official statistic regarding player count.
---
Same deal with his pistol too
---
For me yes
---
I like sky scraper though

Perfect. Thanks.

It's funny because EU always wins majors but seas hasn't won one at all.

I added a link to the individual icons in another comment. Enjoy my guy and thanks for the help!

Aside from her gun being an unusual addition,  I would hope they don't add it to *any* operators, since it would make Kali especially easy to punish for missing a single shot

I live in western europea too and sometimes it takes some extra time to load the map

Wonder who the 5th was. Mama gridlock, or the Chad Mozzie.

For every player that leaves they should knock off the loss percentage by like 20%. So you still lose and go down in score but not by much.

It's even cooler when you clutch as tachanka.

If we all band together and boycott jäger we could plummet his pick rate to 0% and then they’d have to bring back acog to balance it.😤

eta december 2.
---
here's a few tips for console:
---
remember to check corridors and stairs (if only briefly). be careful when you rush towards something, pulse could have picked you possibly picked you up below so a quick glance towards the stairs could save yourself if you find in a similar situation.
---
if you burst fire to control recoil i suggest you switch the G36C, it's easier to control. recoil control is good but being able to accurately acquire a target and increase time-to-kill is more important. Burst firing so precisely takes a surprising amount of time, of course don't just spray full auto though. 
---
Additionally, try to learn to lean properly mid-fire fight so that you're always on target. It can be pretty hard especially on console because you have to press down relatively hard and rapidly to do it, this took me about a year to learn honestly so don't stress, but it is a good skill to try and learn. 
---
Also try not to get into the habit of crouch peeking around corners, like when you dropped hatch.  It slows your ADS movement a lot and makes you a much easier target.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm not saying you're bad or anything, but it's important to take stock of your mistakes, even if you got an ace and your enemy didn't capitalize on it.  If i said anything wrong, feel free to criticize. 
---
Best of luck :)

I used to think my life was an interrogation, but now I realise it was suppression.

Yeet

Are pros 'the most people' now?

That Ash gives me aids with the unnecessary console leaning
---
Yeah. Well the other team started by baning glaz, so we thought "let's pick some strange bans for fun". And they seemed to understand us, so they finished with tachanka. That was fun round

I think that people are actually over exaggerate the problem of 3 armors on attack. Yes, this is a downfall, but not so much that Fuze is always ends up being at the bottom of pick/winrate graphs
---
I have to strongly disagree. Her shotgun had great rate of fire, great spread and not too much recoil for a semi auto shotgun. It still is a shotgun, so you sometimes have to switch onto the pistol, but I would rather have ela's shotgun than most other shotguns in the game.

God, this has been happening to me constantly. Been driving me nuts.

---
Bro you are insane 😂😂. Its called an even playing field. This is the equivalent to saying why are quadrapelgics not on football teams? If they lose its because they are bad not because the enemies had an unfair advatangeor anything. You are literally saying that if players lose to the coinflip of Overtime even if the other tema played worse they dont deserve the win because they should be THAT much better. You understamd how ranked works right? You get put with people around your rank. Therefore you shouldnt win by huge margins you win by being just that much better and on unfair maps that is stolen from you and you are often robbed of any chance to learn or get better. I dont like Skyscraper because it is a rankedstars paradise. Not like I have some personal grudge its just not as fair. I HAVE to ask, what system are you playing on and what is your rank?
---
Wait, R6 on TikTok?
---
Maybe
---
I'm a bit out of the loop on the lore, how is this implying fuze might be able to breach reinforced walls?
---
Fair enough. 
---
Maybe also because a lot of people use Mav incorrectly. They only use him to make a hole right in front of them to get kills, and just get shot in the face. They don't want to be patient and learn him properly, so they just don't use him. That's just my assumption of course.
---
Maverick is the perfect solo player op. Hard/soft breacher, Thatcher junior, anti barb/shield, anti Maestro, anti Bandit-tricker, 3 speed with that sweet M4. 
---
You think you'd see him more in the mid-tier lobbies where most people are solo. Guess not.
---
Thanks!
---
Happy to hear that!
---
DETONATING
---
Try using display driver uninstaller. It's possible your gpu drivers got messed up when it crashed.
---
Np, in the official page you can see their full loadouts.
---
*btw never complain about downvotes or you are gonna get a lot more of them*
---
There’s no fix apart from stop searching for about 5 minutes then try again I have the same problem and it’s painful this is what ubi have said to do to fix it^
---
lvl 60 isn't really much, just play more
---
you sure thats not ingame artwork? holy shit
---
I see Nomad a lot on maps with a lot of run-outs like Coastline and Skyscraper.
---
Frost I totally agree with. I am so not used to seeing her that if I don't see her in the prep phase, or if nobody called out that defense has a Frost, AT LEAST 75% of the time, I end up running right into a Welcome Mat.
---
I never see nomad tho but her kalash is just good
---
A monty using a P9 gets me tilted.... LFP OR TK!
---
Yeah same thing almost happened to me in kafe while playing buck. i did the thing to the hatch then sent out my drone and seeing my drone is twitching like that i runaway from the hatch as soon as possible. because that thing was possessed
---
Id kill it
---
The hero of the match
---
Ясна, джокушка ловушкера
---
Wait, is there some sort of acog event I’m not aware of? I haven’t played siege in a couple of weeks.
---
thanks
---
Do you send your internet packets via carrier pigeon? 
---
Nice plays otherwise.
---
Yeah was searching on the sub for price decrease on operators when shifting sides drops and ran into this shitty post.
---
So if I ever see you in a game (xbox gang), then I should just be terrifies of the enemy buck?
---
Overtime is random
---
And it can be a big moral disadvantage because on some maps the defense has such a huge advantage that they can win 3 in a row and now sure you’re on defense but you’re on match point and it makes you feel more pressured
---
Hea nali
---
Because bandit is the only one that can put down his batteries fast enough to destroy the thermite charge, kaid is too slow
---
So why would they need to buff him
---
Yeah, its because I play on a hotspot the ping is a constant 70ish though.
---
Muuda K-commando MUPOks
---
they dont, person that posted this is clueless
---
Yes, Acogs on M870.
---
Wait, BOSG acog actually happened? Vigil, or defence Glaz?
---
The map pool is daunting. Don't worry. Vertical play and roaming helps. Don't be afraid to try something new in this game.
---
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
---
it was already posted
---
I thought he was wearing old man glasses and I am super disappointed now that I noticed it’s just paint
---
How about your mother
---
It's great BOSGACOG worked but where's my #DuplicateOperatorsInCustomGame?! I want to play 5 Ash against 5 Tachanka with my friends!
---
I think it's heist mod that was leaked while ago.
---
thanks for the red circle
---
I wouldn't have know where to look at.
---
Not so fun for anyone else in the game though

Flip the head so jager says your weak

I'm on bronze/silver border and i can't aim shottys at all
---
If they can make a map like doktors curse without giving a big update and keep the normal map they can do the old Hereford too
---
Im pretty sure he only had 3 claws and not the increased range as well.
---
Wait what’s the green laser on? Ik Ela and Zof’s pistol has one but the suppressor doesn’t look like it
---
I just hope vigil doesn't get it bc oh Lord the **spawn peeks**
---
Why are you such a cunt?
---
Terrible idea
---
Didgy flora, and partizan
---
Just give me a free operator again and I’m good.
---
Sure but you want all the stuff in the beginning, stats, attachments and operators, it’s not as simple as doktor curse.
---
I like it

sorry I don't get what you mean, can you spell it out for a dummy?

If you want to get sucked off by clash who looks like an angry crack addict be my guest, I wouldn't call it an opportunity of a lifetime.

How do they determine who gets skins
---
The stuff you made out of cardboard is impressive lmao
---
RIP
---
DOOR IN SIEGE
---
What do u mean?
---
It’s called maining spy
---
Lion and Mute.
---
Lion is still amazing yet people think the nerf killed him. His ability is amazing post plant and he is also great at refragging.
---
Mute isn't really underpicked, but the fact that he denies the attackers most useful tool, drones, makes him super useful to have around. Plus he has niche uses like instantly cancelling Dokkaebi calls, or jamming reinforced walls which makes him somewhat of a substitute for Bandit.
---
If you can spare the money and want more accuracy, VitiazSpec (VSO) makes a Gorka 3 with the exact camo Kapkan uses, Partizan-M, a.k.a. Medusa Spring.
---
Though ofc, some time last year(?), Ubi made it so that Kapkan's jacket doesn't have camo on it anymore.
---
https://youtu.be/cG3VjqyzMzw at 2:10 and it is indeed the Bandits clip
---
Blackbeards sheild after the nerf be like
---
ssg got the commando and idk about rogue
---
I was totally expecting a rush.
---
Ya, and it's fuckin sick
---
I don't hate Siege on console, I hate people posting clips from it. They are boring, unrealistic, and embarassing to watch.
---
FUCK
---
she is popular but yeah she gets way too many skins and cosmetics while some ops never get any
---
That doc is so bad lol
---
Peak console gameplay
---
Since schools teach stuff no one uses, might as well
---
Wasn't a headshot
---
Neither Lion nor Ela were ever "op", but keep lying to yourself.
---
Not to be rude, but the fuse shield makes me cringe hard
---
That’s sweet! Hopefully it wasn’t rainy lol
---
How many times have you been comm banned to be hit with a 2 week ban? I said “good fucking job” in a message once and only got a 24 hour ban.
---
I'm going to do some cheeky shit with this
---
Finally someone who gets it!
---
“Still took 4 years”
---
I haven’t noticed any problems with the scorpion
---
I see no lies in your statement. However, I’m absolute shite with shotguns in this game. In the 3 years I’ve been playing I have a total of 3 kills with shotguns.
---
seems a bit overtuned.
---
That makes more sense. As a console player myself most rounds are the same. Drone, pick off the cab hiding in a closet, and run into obj
---
You should've made the lesion's T-5 smg cos it had the legendary skin made of cardboard  :D
---
You don't find "Russia invading Canada" in a conventional war to be one of the most contrived, laughable plots written? I don't know, to me a plot has to at least be semi-believable. And if its not 100% accurate, say a science-fiction novel, it at least has to be internally consistent, follow a set of believable rules for the circumstances. Tom Clancy novels tend to be neither believable or consistent.
---
House
---
NO WAY! DID THEY REALLY ADD IT???
---
The scope is completely uncharged yet the guy is still highlighted, this is new to the TTS
---
Can't really say, never played or read any Overwatch backstories.
---
This is footage straight from coreross I believe, this is new
---
Ash has had like 6 skins in a row and 12 for the R4-C, meanwhile my boy Mute hasn’t had a buyable bundle since White Noise, and if he has, he hasn’t had a skin in a long ass time. He, along with many others, get shafted in terms of cosmetics. Just check how many skins Ash has compared to Mute. Just sucks to see someone get drowned with cosmetics while somebody whose been in the game since launch hasn’t had many bundles.
---
this is reddit in a nutshell and I hate it
---
Ah okay makes sense. Ive done it a few times on chalet and never been able to drop it. definitely didn't miss any sections. Thanks for the reply.
---
This is really good and its made of cardboard at the same time
---
That doesn't matter. How often do you see stacks communicating with randoms? It's not even a factor to make solos and duos play vs 3, 4 and 5 stacks. Lack of communication is a different issue on the players part, it's not the game's fault like in the case of  the broken match maker we have now.
---
That's a really good cardboard mp5! This looks really good
---
Okay cool thanks!
---
bandit mains rise up
---
You  mean 5.6? Because 56.0 is impossible to do unless you played one game and never touched BO4 again.
---
Terrible troll
---
YES
---
I've been saying for a while my old boy needs that barbed back.
---
I've seen a lot of some group with a kid named "Reee Kid" recently but I don't know what group it is. They seem to play a lot of VR games.
---
Theres a meme in everything
---
Well SAS shotgun is broken and literally long range :p
---
Have you played before?
---
I recently played against joystick on favela in casual
---
I hate it when people whip around like that. Puts me on edge for the next 30 seconds
---
Lol no
---
This says a lot about society
---
same with bandit, he only gets cosmetics through GSG9 bundles.
---
~~he also just got a PL skin but we don't need to know that~~
---
It was hyperbole but yeah...
---
&gt;Did you miss theme park?
---
no.
---
Just make the guns self loading Nerf guns and it's perfect
---
"ptsd flashback to console siege before the TK Changes"
---
That was a Valk.
---
for 2 and 1 armors and only inside 8ms for 2armor and 10ms for 1armor
---
What are you saying?
---
capitao/ying and kaid/goyo
---
It's a casual match on a trash map. Not everyone wants to use the metaloadout 24/7
---
Until they made a post complaining how they never hit hip fire shots
---
if he misses the single shot and lands a body it will do like 20 dmg. the drop off for the slug is intense.
---
maybe ypur enemies eill think they're ceiling lights.
---
Stop
---
The one at the invitationals
---
Well dont i feel silly now...
---
It really is down to the controls.
---
On high ranks on PC the people who play often have many years of FPS experience and since the MnK system is such a direct way to input in an FPS people play with no obstacle in how they move, they "control the game with their eyes" sorta say (which makes for better clips because they are about straight up outplaying someone, not them struggling to aim).
---
True. The PL skin he got looks like shit imo and I’d love to see more skins for him. I was really hoping we’d get more operator PL skins but it seems like that won’t be happening. If it makes you feel any better it was leaked that Bandit would be getting his PL skin (Carbon fiber, white, and gold) sometime soon, probably either Shifting Tides or next season.
---
End War wasn't even written by Clancy. Half of the books that say Tom Clancy are actually ghostwriters.
---
Nice job man
---
ur one clip from black ice
---
I guess I shouldn’t have said that lol
---
Maybe youre not getting enough sleep
---
yea, I'd like to see actual video of this
---
Yes but unlike siege most other games just have increased damage on headshot not a straight 1 hit kill regardless. The current 1 hit headshots system is also scientifically proven to lead to Shaiikoitis. Oh god Shaiiko
---
#101 minutes
---
It’s a leak for next years Halloween event.
---
#100 minutes apparently
---
ALready tried patching MnK out. Xim4 programmers just changed the code and it was running again after a few days. You can't really win against these guys.
---
So I scrolled past your post and didn’t think anything of it. I just got voted out of the game after watching them play a whole round cause I joined an ongoing match. This needs to stop.
---
Valk: "I wanna play a ga-"
---
Fuze: "NYET!"
---
How slim of a pixel peak do you think you can get on tachanka?
---
I had no idea he can do three
---
I always play as him
---
How recent is the buff?
---
He has frags, and dont forget the yellow scope might be getting significantly buffed again now (except the smoke part of it)
---
I'm using light mode and it took me a solid 30 seconds to figure out why it was just some red squiggles.
---
all aboard the awp train..
---
Oh they’re going to have to glue you back together!
---
TACTICAL ROOMBA
---
It happened to me yesterday as well. My first time to
---
Ejaculation
---
wait i cant tell if youre not spencer or if this is a bit
---
I expected Fuze to put his charge over the peekhole for whatever reason
---
Well if they want it to be as powerful as it is it needs to be a 50 cal so probably not
---
I mean it’s casual
---
Yeah but it’s still easy to counter if you have a thatcher or kali. I’m assuming this is to just make him more of an appealing choice and to compete with bandit a little more
---
It’s random.
---
My first 2% alpha pack was a legendary...
---
People really do enjoy sucking their own dicks lol
---
That was joe phase 1 worked. Phase 2 and beyond is random.
---
That scream
---
No, teams chose the phase 3 skins.
---
There are times when I start playing poorly that I need to step away from the game for a while. Like I wont play for a week or two and I'll come back and feel like I'm playing better than ever
---
Winning.
---
Is it just me or is the ADS really fast? I thought he was using angled grip.

This literally won't happen, ever. 90% of XiM users buy XiM to play MnK on console. If people have disabilities, they use specialized adaptive controllers (the one Microsoft has) to play more story oriented games or adventure games. XiM users need to be banned, or at least detect it to not allow them to play.
---
Who the fuck doesn’t run revolver?
---
Vigil stole it
---
But see, theres like 2 worth while legendaries, I like the mav one, and I think jackal c7e one, microchip thing for ump is ok, which I think is what I got
---
Why did you use Finka to do this instead of sledge or buck?
---
I gathered that. But there are plenty of people who are on console that actively use a mouse &amp; keyboard instead of a controller
---
I'm used to not having enough sleep dude. Aren't we all?
---
The worst part is that controller and mouse already have separate recoil systems in the game. So when these guys plug their xim4 in it mimics a controller input and they get the controller recoil settings and they get to use a mouse. Bunch of sad little shits. Sadly there's no way to fix it. People are developing the mindset that "everyone else is using it so why shouldn't I?" I'm Plat 2 and I'm gonna guess around 50% of people are running MnK.
---
I can confirm.
---
Cav is an undead
---
But the thing is, I open 1 ap it's a legendary, second one rare, third(2%) legendary, it was a good night
---
You violated the law!
---
God that’s terrifying, amazing job!
---
KILL IT
---
Kapkans isn’t the TCSG. That’s Kaids shotgun.
---
Sorry, you’re right. The phases are off cause they rebranded. 
---
Phase 1 was the original one and they chose the op and gun (liquid smoke and SK Twitch for example)
---
Phase 2 was this last one with full skins and was random (g2 sledge for example)
---
Phase 3 is this one with just one skin and seems to be up to teams (g2 smg11)
---
Phase 4 is unknown criteria and was just leaked (cloud9 on SAS shotty)
---
But they seem to have rebranded to this 2nd version of the pilot program completely
---
I haven’t played mnk in so long that by this point I’d probably be terrible but I’m fairly good on controller (place gold every season). I start in gold and drop to silver so fast because of a) shit team mates who can’t find the triggers in their controllers or b) mnk nerds who are too dogshit on pc to compete so they have to get an advantage on console players.
---
Aight I was just thinking about the tombstone placed and the “lore” of the event, I know it’s a joke but thanks for the explanation of the joke!
---
Big W for both of us
---
Does anyone know what the nerf to the fo-12 is going to do?
---
Ok but how rare is teamkilling? On PC?
---
Mnk players on console will love her.
---
I’ve had it happen twice. Once got a common 2nd time an epic.
---
Also got a pack at 9% then 4% then 2% in a row...sadly all were commons.
---
Ok i was under the impression that Thatcher emp will destroy friendly gadgets. I feel dumb now, since i was playing thatcher quite a bit
---
Why does everything have to be about mnk on console?
---
But it's annoying. Especially since it's moving around so much.
---
blitza isn't dead, but boy is he bleeding out in the corner, desperately swatting castle and hibana away.
---
Wdym?
---
It kinda be looking good doe
---
A lot of discussions I see being up mnk.  It’s not even that big of an issue.
---
Oh the game is way less buggy than it used to be lmao
---
It’s meh just find a good team to play with and probably little but ransoms idk
---
Do you play on console?
---
OH MY GOD ITS MEXICAN JOKER!
---
I like it a lot
---
mp5k?
---
It did in the closed beta. I cant remember if they changed it for the open beta or the live game. But I know closed beta me and my friends would run shield line up the dot on the head and hip fire
---
I do.  It’s really not as big of a problem as people make it out to be.
---
Yeah...it’s against rule 9, no self promotion :|
---
What rank are you?
---
Just give kaid his barb wire back. That is my only request.
---
Police be like "we thought it was real"..
---
Can I ask for buck after lion?
---
I thought about doing one with lee being a downed enemy and then shooting him like clementine does at the end of season one.
---
Which I think is a great balance, as an attacker I want it to not reset so I can use it against them.  As a defender I want it to reset so I can GTFA from it before I get blown to bits by a grenade that wasn't even meant for me.
---
Good gadget, well balanced, the gun is a "little" OP for the defense, but still within reason and needs no nerfing IMHO.
---
That is correct
---
Literally every company in existence: nah
---
As I recall only overwatch has different balance for pc and consoles and it is For Honor downfall
---
Cav mains rise up (don't, we don't need more soloque players who die in the first minute)
---
Currently stuck in silver 1, have been up to gold 2 this season.  I know mnk is more common in plat and diamond but at that point, you should expect to see mnk.
---
A bit less
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Yeah, I also usually am dealing with a lack of supplies

Kinda

No beta users only

Fire is a skin you get for play during alpha or beta of the game
---
It’s a skin for playing the beta so no.
---
Beta users only. :’))))
---
No
---
Yes it's been well requested
---
Thnx mate
---
Silver 1 he says...there's your answer, so you acknowledge mnk is prominent in higher ranks but then say it isn't a issue? Why isn't it a issue? Because your silver and no one uses mnk there so it doesn't really affect you? Yeah, makes sense bud and just because i should expect it doesn't mean it's still not an issue, people who are below plat 3 shouldn't have an opinion or say when it comes to talking about mnk on console. "I'm not affected it so it isn't a problem", that honestly is the dumbest mindset to have, delete it from your brain please.
---
Kaid can pick up electric claw after 1st emp is dropped but not detonated. It’s not a complete counter
---
The cut at the end
---
Yeah whichever. I meant the system its using just so ppl can understand
---
People who call things OP before they are fully released suck
---
Nokk’s role is basically a cav-vigil type role. She can easily get into the objective when the defenders are on camera especially if shes a 3 speed. IQ doesnt have that ability other than using her scanner. Nokk removes her image from the camera whilst IQ has to find the camera using her scanner and destroy it. 
---
I will amend my weapon choice statement tho. I wouldnt mind her with an ACOG but it has to be a gun that matches the performance of the FMG so i would think the SPEAR would be a good choice.
---
He deserved it
---
It happens
---
Won’t even affect bandit. Bandit is still better at doing bandits job than Kaid.
---
True lol 😂
---
Yes
---
Exactly bandit and laid are two completely different operators doing similar things in completely different ways, they don’t really impede on each others territory at al
---
If you don’t have a headset you’re going to die
---
dont let him get on rooftop
---
In the New season
---
Noob holes, it's funny how many people think these are a good idea. It's like they don't realize you can shoot though them.
---
I’m an idiot.. was playing with my bro and he didn’t understand lol
---
When you can’t find your own content so you use a youtubers and don’t even credit him in the title
---
Yea if you don't have surround sound your ded
---
Push to talk is in probably or the key isn’t binded
---
VIBE CHECK
---
Have a good headset
---
Use alibi or maestro
---
New sniper because at least she has a usable and good ability
---
Kali has about equal footing with Thatcher against Bandit. The explosive damage is about 5 damage per grenade, which isn’t a whole lot in total.  
---
Kali is unable to counter a Kaid who is actively tricking, however.
---
I have the Jager elite but was looking at other cosmetics to change it up for a bit for myself, but there really isn’t any good headgear and outfit for him (that I like at least)
---
A lot of pro league players run lasers just because that split second of hipfiring before ADSing will save your skin.
---
I do die alot from not hearing players when they’re right next to me, but its more than that, it just seems they always know where i am
---
Yeah it’s called having a headset
---
Nope if that was the problem i would've been able to hear them
---
Why do i need the skin.... When i have the Mask........
---
on a side note the Fro...Bro... lol
---
It’d been funnier if you put the “to be continued”
---
How is that the same thing, if 2 want to ban cav and 3 people click no ban then cav isn’t banned but if they clicked no vote then cav would still get banned
---
Is this a new meta? I've been out of the game for a while, but I used to play constantly and watch pro league. I don't really remember them using lasers ever.
---
I’ve been playing Escape from Tarkov and I find myself point shooting a lot more often and it screws me up with other FPS games like siege
---
It always annoyed me that Doc can use his stim pistol on himself while downed, and Zofia can just get back up for no fucking reason, yet Finka can't find it in herself to press a button on her glove when shes DBNO.
---
That is the MP5K not the MP5 duh.
---
Jokes aside congrats. I like it.

Yeah I only ever run laser right on Twitch's F2 because its actually insane hipfire. everything else I feel its nearly useless to run a laser most of the time, except obviously shotties
---
Dude this is 76 days old.  Why’re you necroing?
---
Yes you can log into the same Uplay account as you do on your Xbox on a pc and you should be able to download the test server I recommend something with at least 8GB of ram if you do that
---
Try going more slowly. Drone before entry. Drones are incredibly valuable. First minute, use for intel. 2nd minute for positioning and prep. 3rd minute move to site. This is not hard and fast but is a good guide. Intel is everything.

Me after cav elite skin leak

When I got this game I had no idea how it played so I just picked Glaz cause he was a sniper and I got constantly dunked on. Now that I've learned him through trial and error, he is really fun to use.
---
Please let this be true
---
Well first thing you need to do is get some earbuds at least. There are a lot of subtle audio cues you miss if you are using a speaker. If you don't, the enemy will always have an advantage over you in terms of sound.
---
That aside, you also need to focus on being disciplined. Think about what you did wrong that led you to die, and focus on not letting that happen. Obviously you can lose a gunfight to someone who has better aim but you should never be in a position where you are outplayed.
---
Discipline is the most important thing.
---
I really like Capitao.  He was the first operator I ever used back when I first got the game and now that I’m building myself into a support role, he’s the attacker I choose the most (well, right behind Finka).
---
very old angle but never seen it work as effectively as that
---
if I dont move the bad man cant see me
---
I play on Xbox as well and can confirm. Playing casual solo queue means I’m just as worried about my team mates shooting me as I am the enemies.

Kaid tricking is so difficult that I feel like if you're able to do it consistently then more power to you.
---
This is literally what i do, i spend alot of time on drones in attack, and the opposite in defence, mainly because I use lesion as my main so i dont use cameras , the Gu does that job
---
 Necroing?

Bandit is still in a fine position and a strong operator. 3 speed, a gun that’s a headshot machine, and can still counter thatcher/thermite
---
Survivorship Bias in full play, Ladies and Gentlemen
---
because you're afraid he's going to roll his ankle?
---
That sucks, hopefully one day they can pull it off, fingers crossed!
---
I take bandit and don’t use his guns because his ability sucks
---
You still add time by having to flick over to their head from the doorway or whatever you're putting your dot on to not make it visible. I did't ever personally run them except on secondaries or shottys.
---
&gt;
---
Quick question I’m still new to siege and this subreddit please don’t be harsh but what is tts
---
I somewhat disagree, I've tricked Thatcher with Kaid before, but it's kinda difficult.
---
Noticeably. It takes a while before you get used to closed ears. As somebody who played his first 10 placements ever in siege 2 years ago on loudspeakers, I can confirm that it took me a few games to get adjusted but it was a godsend to have much more directional Intel.
---
One gets spawnpeeked for only one reason- he rushed towards the building. There is no valid and legitimate reason for you to rush blindly towards the building. It is ok, and I repeat, completely ok, for you to wait 10 seconds at spawn, either droning, or adsing and pre-firing all doorways and entrances facing spawn. Staying alive for the remainder  of the  round is  worth  the  wait. Ideally, if you fear getting spawnpeeked, drone at spawn and callout. Here, in prep phase place your drone at common peek spots OR at your preferred entry point, and always drone before entry.
---
Choose a playstyle. Either frag, or support, or flex. Pick one, get good, and then move on to the next.
---
If you are getting rushed, play trap ops. There's no disadvantage to playing trap ops. Lesion, frosty, Ela, kapkan, all have decent loadouts and useful gadgets. Plan your defense so that you can  safely get back to objective/your off-site hold and hold angles.
---
And yes, pay attention to sound. Even Cav in silent step makes sound.

Sorry, but I am not from that show and not into stunts.

That's really good for something made out of cardboard. Whenever I try something like this it looks like hot garbage.
---
Play ranked and drop in Elo til it’s fun.
---
Most people I know that play only casual (including me) completely hate this change. It doesn't make any sense at all to force AADD on the casual mode since, and I can say this with some certainty, most people that play only casual play it BECAUSE it's ADAD and not AADD.  
---
Truth be told it's very possible that my play time with my friends will reduce tremendously because we will simply get fed up super easily with this style of matches.

Won't really have a huge impact. That Ela nerf was more for consoles where Ela shotty is kinda strong.

Reviving an old, dead post.  It’s forum etiquette to avoid necroing.

If people are curious why his W/L was so high it's because playing siege on Xbox with a full squad (which I did with BostonBearJew most of time) is 10x easier then solo queuing.....I don't think the two of us ever played siege without a full squad plus it was much easier back in the day. For instance if you go look at my Xbox profile that I would play on I had a 79% W/R compared to switch to PC I only have a 55% W/R.

Thing is you can’t control the recoil lol

Literally any rusher: "To the objective!"

Kaid with ACOG on AUG A3: "Ho, instead of running away, you came closer?"
---
Lmao it was so funny when the gun was just going straight up so we had to burst fire
---
Oh no
---
Seems people don’t understand. They made it so defenders will be highlighted when the scope isn’t charged but you won’t be able to see through smoke unless the scope is charged.
---
Always bums me out that you can’t use it in the courtyard on coastal to get to the 2nd level.
---
Would also be sweet to use as a zip line and go from window to window on canal.  Maybe it could stay attached for 3 seconds after Amaru uses it and be good for one other OP
---
I would just bring a shotgun lol. 
---
Avoid trying to hit their head and shred them in one shot
---
Lol man, that is fricking creative. I like how you sticked to that "role play"
---
Zofia - her gun has no recoil and has a good ttk, her gadget has a lot of utility and you’re not stuck playing one way with her. Also claymore.
---
Jackal - you get to shut down roamers and his c7e is godlike
---
Maestro - his gun is as good as the attackers, his evil eyes provide information and can prevent bomb defusals
---
I think that would be cool but wouldn’t fit sieges game style
---
I need more
---
That's happened to me before with cav as well!
---
Attackers wouldnt have any reinforces though. Im sure it would be a mess on both sides.
---
which gun for zofia
---
I really want to correct the answer but if I do, it will go to r/whoosh.

Oh well I think he's talking about OwO

I don't wanna see Jäger running with F2 around the map killing everyone. It would be a fun mini gamemode thou.

it does have a bit of recoil not much tho
---
Everyone would just pick the same 3 best weapon.

Lol okay. Commenting on lasers giving your position away in a situational awareness-focused game is role play. Gotcha
---
😂
---
But the real question is, Did you win it?
---
Looks like you're going to the shadow realm, u/ImARoadcone

I'm still surprised people rely on that so much without looking into it further

That program always shows the highest rank reached, Doesn't matter if you changed region or even if you deranked from diamond to gold

How did u do this with finka? She has a shotty?
---
It is the most realistic cosplay on kapkan I've ever seen. Well done mate!
---
What’s wrong with posting clips? I doubt they care to wait for more pc players to post in order to post their console clip. I agree, siege on pc is better and most of the time more entertaining to watch and I’m on Xbox until hopefully cross progression comes.
---
Play her for a couple of hours and you’ll get the hang of it

I know it won’t, maybe as an event

Anchoring used to be fine on Chalet but the more new ops come the worse that map plays.

Ubi just removed 165 MMR from my ranked, because of banned players. That's rough.
---
Maybe it’s a forgotten template for there new support beams that they are adding in maps like Kate for example and just hadn’t been implemented yet
---
Well on pc you get up to 90 fov so 110 would be kinda dumb
---
Even Ubi knows the brown skin is doo doo, so they’re trying to keep us from getting it
---
And Thatcher's bombs can be countered by Jager. But I'd be more concerned with Bandit tricking than I am Mute Jammers.

Hmmm this may sound stupid but have you made sure you’re headphones are plugged in

Yeah don’t get yourself down bud. Awesome work!

I'm pretty new to rainbow so I haven't seen anyone really tricking. I'm a dirty casual so that's probably why?
---
Well either way I hope you have a good day!😁
---
🤮
---
Yes but people would bitch to have them in pvp as well. Better to not give them acog at all.
---
Chalet is so fun
---
Knife double kill? I didn't even think that was possible
---
I think his point is that Fortnite players are the type of players to like these skins
---
I've had this glitch happen to me multiple times this and last season. Especially with doors..
---
When the clown masks and "toy gun" skin came out I was sorely worried and for evidently good reason
---
Even if it wasnt a glitch our lord is probably laughing his ass off thinking "dumb mortal you can't breach me."
---
Just depends how good the people your playing are.  Some maps like Kanal it’s easy to trick the box, others are a bit tougher.
---
Idk this happens to me too.
---
What?
---
Doesn't come close, no, but its apparent that they are trying to shift their player base to the kind of players who will spend money on cosmetics. Surely you can see that in some of the new operators they've been putting out. A grappling cannon.... Come on
---
Ok
---
Its universally agreed that the map is good
---
Down them, then place a breaching charge next to them.
---
&gt;Put breach charge on wall.
---
&gt;Pray like a motherfucker that someone is in the otherside.
---
Better than I can draw. Good job
---
I heard that using a high fov with a stretched res really had no benefit. Is that true, does it actually not help?
---
\&gt;
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Tbh how often do you see a hibana, thermite and mav in ranked where they all push the main wall? Thatcher and kali cant easily counter bandit because you pick up the battery as soon as its destroyed the charge and even if they do chain emps you still have ample batteries to take put the other thermite charge. Plus mavs counter is literally just shoot him. If he opens up a big enough hole to enter through hes incredibly vulnerable and if its just taking out batteries that leaves thermite vulnerable while placing his charge.
---
Yeah naturally
---
*sweats in security room on plane*
---
I like it very much, and many pro players use it aswell. It is of course a personal opinion, but i recommend trying it.
---
Other than...?
---
&gt; banana vision
---
🍌👁️
---
Diamond, but that was when I played all the time with my friends. Now as soon as I hit any plat I back off and just do whatever.
---
very noice
---
Yea, I’m going to try it out, my question is that shouldn’t you use a lower fov?
---
Spawnpeek that ghost
---
&gt;e mo
---
it'd be fun to add magnifier in exchange of decreased field of view or adding grips that have more effect on horizontal recoil.
---
Idk I’ve never tried it. Until recently, I just had heard about people playing on 4:3. The sensitivity I have makes it 1:1 from hip aiming to ads also, which idk how changing the aspect ratio will affect that.
---
Plat 1+ players like balanced maps. Chalet is not balanced at higher levels. That’s the reason it’s not in pro league anymore.
---
How do you play on it?
---
Haha if only these youtubers where remotely funny
---
He prolly poked out his eye with his bionicle when  he was 7.
---
Just let me switch to default skins so I dont have to see these things running around. Like make it client side if you have too.
---
Cool. Does changing you aspect ratio mess with sens?
---
Literally pointed the laser into her eye oof
---
But wacky look-at-me outfits sell like hot cakes if you tell players they're time-exclusive
---
Damn. This is how I play regularly though.
---
Hacking or lag?
---
Do not be mean to yourself it is very nice
---
You are correct sir
---
glaz was never a great entry fragger *unless* coupled with smoke, so i doubt if he'll be anywhere neae as good at it as before. Glaz will however benefit a lot in terms of countering peekers, seeing people who expose only the smallest part of their body etc. (once again seeing yellow through tiny bullet holes in walls will be massive)
---
As someone else mentioned, it’s largely the stupid kids doing this stuff. Could you imagine the haven a kid-free siege would be? It sounds amazing
---
THAT'S MY FRIENDS AND IM HIDING IN THE BATH my friends just scream everything at me and I can't hear and they wonder why I don't want to play ranked with them
---
My guess is that he was too powerful in pro-play on certain points (kitchen hatch on clubhouse for example)
---
I am so confused
---
Just install the TTS, boot it up and voila :)
---
Cant find it on the Uplay store
---
I hope you are kidding, if not, I am truly sorry.
---
Fair enough. I was thinking more of scenarios where Bandit already has some of his batteries down, or he’s switching a couple back and forth. Between three Kali grenades and three Thatcher ones I figure they could outsmart an average player. If someone is good at Bandit tricking though I’ve no doubt they could run a Kali and a Thatcher out of gadgets, even then there is the possibility of a flank or Maverick making a hole and just killing Bandit while he’s busy. Overall I just don’t see Bandit tricking as enough of a benefit for him to be considered on par with a range buffed Kaid,  at least in terms of gadget.
---
Hello ZeGengis, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dwy5o5/the_lord_has_arrived/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I just looked up the new L85A3, the difference in game would be purely cosmetic. "Free-floating" Barrel and a better railing system for more optic options are the big changes from what I see. No reason for Ubi to do the change.
---
I’m about to DM Nora Misini, wish me luck boisss
---
Very old
---
Yeah I've noticed he doesn't get picked often but when he does he normally kills me.
---
I play with the highest possible fov because then you can really see what's to the left/right side of the screen.
---
Have you ever used Amari? She's likely attack on titan but in this.... Also, nobody is forcing your arm to play her though.... And there come Khali and wamari and the BosgACOG.... So, I disagree with your "realism" issue with skins and characters
---
Alt+z make sure instant replay is on
---
With stretched res? I heard there really is no advantage if you use a high fov with stretched
---
Your hole team left. No one has any points.
---
I'd be content if we still had bundles and instead they were credits only instead of the lootbox bullshit ubi loves to shove into our mouths.
---
Me after a depressing round.
---
Kills matter? Tell that to the high level, unselfish dudes who play Monty, Clash and Smoke and have a &gt; 1.0 win rate.
---
But you can shoot while adsing, I got a bunch of kills like this.
---
Also it won’t help newcomers at all.
---
So we just gon ignore the fact that they changed the 1st floor of Club House?
---
exactly, there was almost no vertical play, the rooms were small yet large in quantity, and the map was just a maze of confusion; and the audio in tower is terrible
---
did your dumbass just use an emoji
---
That's why i said some (I hate myself for missing Vigil's pro league bundle) Mira, Lesion (event stuff mainly has one nice bundle tho) and Jackal have nice ones to. Dokkaebi (I like her PL bundle her invitational event skin ony) , Zofia, Ying (one nice bundle PL skin uses the same headgear to which is nice) and ela on the other hand have disappointing bundles you can purchase with renown
---
Que worm motion montage
---
came out great :)
---
Finka shotgun is fun in my opinion
---
Coming from a game like Overwatch, I like the skins... They're don't distract me from the game and they look great. I haven't played hey with pink tachankas hey though
---
That part was pretty funny ngl.
---
What settings did you use? This is in T-hunt right?
---
I’m partial to the Polish girls, I play really aggressive and they are both extremely versatile
---
Well if you play a cheese operator, sometimes people will cheese back. It sucks when it happens but guess what? You can circumvent this problem entirely by not playing her. She is not even in the meta. It's as if you were complaining that you get shot through Tachanka shield in Ranked. My first thought would be "why the fuck you playing Tachanka in Ranked to begin with"
---
The fact that Thatcher beat the shit out of three people singlehandedly is phenomenal
---
Toxic
---
So that’s a piece of shit HyperX
---
I think they would die as soon as they stepped outside their base
---
Yes she should
---
So you enjoy them ?
---
That seems like a pretty good idea, but the no melee thing sounds kinda op. Maybe it should take more hits to break
---
Honestly I’d enjoy this. Maybe even a small head level one way window. Not like game breaking. But like you’d have to be right up on the door to see through. And ur view is limited to where the doorway is facing.
---
The old system was the best. For the first halloween event i bought hibana's pack with in game currency  then bought buck's bundle for cash because i liked it. I had no problem with limited content until they put them in loot boxes
---
This is wow
---
Yeah same. I'm confused on why they removed skyscraper from ranked. It's one of my favorite maps since themepark was removed. And it ~~doesn't~~ didn't seem all that unbalanced. Each site was relatively easy to defend with a team that communicated.
---
Are these boxes have stimpaks as well ?
---
Mmmm. Weird, they're feeling her coming through windows doesn't feel likes Siege. But going up an edge isn't? Some weird excuse there
---
No because operaters that are based on a defensive role such as Mira or castle would be useless
---
I wouldn’t main them if I didn’t
---
Not even using ACOG
---
