Black Ice, Y1 S1 seasonal skin. But it's available in Alpha Packs it's a Epic (purple) so it's rare.
---

---
Here's a video showcasing the skin on all the weapons it's available on:

Technically a modified FAL, the L1A1.

Caveria: "Youre Next"

I thought it was kind of obvious he was gonna blow it
---
No wonder their terrorists! They are missing like half of their brains so they just think that they are working for the military.
---
If pubg devs can do it, ubi can do it
---
Rank is about to reset so just wait
---
Help appriciated as my first time buying credits hope this isnt a rare thing or bad.
---
Yeah but there's not many alternatives, much less faster ones
---
If kapkan has 5 gadgets and he is only a 1 speed then he cant place anything down during prep phase. If they made him a 3 speed I think it would balance him out
---
PC////PST
---
Not sure but worst case scenario they send your money back to Well you
---
Nokk need the mp5SD not the mp7.
---
Uhhh sure man... whatever you say...
---
Nope I was active, I got disconnected either due to server issues or internet issues

you aren't being critical you're being retarded

Oh just wait, there's at least one cheeky way of spawn peeking.
---
Nobody chooses him because he is trash. He needs to be buffed somehow
---
or you can play on intel graphics and get shit fps no matter what lol.
---
If you get a clip of them admitting it and multiple people submit clear video evidence, they can be banned. However, on consoles you can have unlimited accounts so it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre banned in the long run.
---
Not as bad as warden he‚Äôs pretty much useless. And the other ops that have there same guns are more useful.
---
Ya sadly. I do hope it gets fixes though
---
Warden is hotter
---
Have you ever heard of cognitive dissonance? You might find this interesting https://www.pbis.org/Common/Cms/files/Forum17_Presentations/B4_H4_CognitiveDissonanceinRelationtoWhiteFragility.pdf
---
We just have to live with it.  We‚Äôve done fine for a few years already, so we can continue managing.
---
I'm just yanking your chain man
---
The buff is not to the damage or recoil, its that it allows Nokk to equip an ACOG. In this game, they could not allow her to use the ACOG without also giving it to Smoke. Weapons are treated as universal assets that operators have access to, i.e. giving the Warden‚Äôs MPX an ACOG would require giving Valk an ACOG.
---
Protect your account better?  Stop failing for phising scams and dont be a dummy.
---
Absolutely correct!
---
ok thanks for your input.
---
I honestly doubt that. N√∏kk is not doing well in in the current version of Siege, and I think we've seen how an ACOG affects the balance of an Op with Bandit, J√§ger, and Ash. After the scope was removed, pick rate plumeted, but yet they still remain as some of the best choices available.
---
Yeah, but the guy I was replying to was saying that she should get the MP5SD without the ACOG.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt clear in 24 hours, send a ticket.
---
Hello Schoolboy_Slav, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/czcnvk/nokk_is_here/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Exactly what a bot would say thanks for your service machine.
---
Change my mind. How is he balanced
---
But Ubisoft literally said she was too op with the gun that had an acog she was given
---
maybe a new MP7SD? Just an mp7 with a forced suppressor
---
Even with high fps it's choppy
---
Black ice flexing I see
---
Yeah I had this problem and contacted support and they couldn‚Äôt tell me why this happened and I was annoyed because they take the money but you get nothing. But like someone said wait 24 hours if still nothing, contact support
---
i use glaz to counter spawnpeeks lol
---
I don‚Äôt really understand what you are trying to do, but I think you completely didn‚Äôt get what I said at all, I said of course no one gives a shit that people are bashing a mesh of digital non sense... it‚Äôs not a real person
---
Maybe, but I don't think they can accurately tell how powerful someone will be before release. Blackbeard, Lion, and Ela are great examples
---
Only if you're trying to fake people out. Otherwise they're there for defender jackal.
---
Yes, it is a joke.
---
This isn‚Äôt funny at all.
---
The account is attached to an email I never use, appreciate the grammatically incorrect and condescending answer ‚Äúdummy‚Äù

They did say she was op but yes I‚Äôll give you that but some others might disagree
---
there is nobody in this galaxy who would think a buff which helps lesion in any way is justified
---
It used to make a big difference, so it is mostly just muscle memory and habit.
---
Thanks friend
---
You hate to see it
---
Love it!
---
I guess that dude is good but got unlucky with pairing, or played with some friends who were not quite at his level of play ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You where shooting his helmet
---
Ok Adam
---
3 speed, just clear out gadgets and use them to find out where your opponents are when they're on their drone. Also, being 3 speed means she's good for entry fragging so on the rare occasion that Ash is banned in a scrim I hop over to IQ.
---
my bad it was only 3 but it still felt pretty good lol
---
ngl he out here looking like Ben Shapiro no cap
---
Woah there buddy, we're not all born experts in the game
---
I haven't encountered any lag switching and by the sound of what you're describing it sounds like ddosing. Not heavy enough to crash the server but enough that no one can move. If that's the case then there is simply nothing Ubi can do about it other than pay Microsoft Azure for better servers but also feel as if Microsoft Azure should secure their servers better. And as for MnK there isn't anything Ubi can do it that regard either, there was a patch that caused adaptors to stop working but the third party that sells the adapters came out with a patch for the adapter after only 3 hours that gave it functionality again.
---
I don't know why, but I think it looks like a shaven 'LA Beast'
---
Finka isn‚Äôt the most useful in the majority of situations. Thatcher, twitch, nomad, gridlock all would suit your play style well
---
I mean you Australian geography is a little questionable. Gridlock is QLD not NT.
---
No
---
FMG/MP5K are used by operators with wide range of utility who holds angle. Smoke especially watches for one entry while the other entries are being blocked by his gadget. He has the advantage of facing 1 or 2 Speed Attackers who are coming toward him. 
---
Nokk is an Attacker without such advantage. She's the one entering and moving toward her targets. Her angles are much more limited. Attackers often have advantage of having range and damage. Nokk is the only non-shield Attacker without those benefit. 
---
She's basically using a Defender gun without having the benefit of being a Defender.  
---
We already have 3 Speed Attackers who can shorten the distance much quicker and more reliably than Nokk who relies on 2 Speed walking. 
---
Dev said "Nokk had an AR and she was too strong with it". Not to mention ppl are starting to call that a bs when their own data showed Nokk being the second worst Attacker when Glaz was nerfed. With Glaz buffed and Amaru joining soon, Nokk will get buried. 
---
As of now, IQ taking out hidden cams/drones/gu-mines before crouch walking around is as sneaky as Nokk while also having much stronger guns and faster rotation due to being 3 Speed. There's no reason to pick Nokk over someone like IQ or even Ash who is far superior than Nokk in close combat.
---
He fr looking kinda chill
---
I didn't realise Alibi was from Libya
---
Im sorry but, if you bought black ice when it was a seasonal skin and not when alpha packs were around, why cant you equip it to all weapons?
---
Why is he white?
---
Give me downvotes
---
I‚Äôd say Finka, since Lion got a nerf just a short while ago.
---
Way too over the top
---
Ying has easy recoil just prefire that's how I play Ying. Would also recommend watching hungry in PL to see how ying is played.
---
üíØ yes
---
Probably Maverick
---
Getting rid of his running animation with it's slightly longer ads time would be enough.
---
That‚Äôs what it is...
---
Clear out some space on your drive,
---
Make sure steam isn't downloading the HD texture pack DLC, it is about 30GB and not really worth it.
---
Also apparently MP5SD suppressor is not even quiet compared to the other suppressed weapons in the game. Rogue 9 did a video on it if I remember correctly.
---
He looks like the heavy from TF2
---
Probably Warden and N√∏ok- both underwhelming tbh. I don't mind the MPX, it's a laser, but the FMG9 is abysmal. If she had the PDW or MP5 I'd be fine.
---
That's what I do, but it's still nerve-wracking.
---
Nah just nerf
---
That seems better than actual jackel
---
If every single op Ubi released was very useful, balancing the game would be a bitch. I think it's okay to have some cool and fun operators once in a while.
---
He had a gunsight and head gear on alibi...
---
He deserved to be killed.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôll check it out. 
---
Much appreciated!
---
my account i mainly use is from december 15th of 2018 and ive had all the ops since the end of burnt horizon
---
I think he can't scan footprints if the person isnt within 10 m
---
Tachanka and fuze
---
Ubi doesn't do them because they'll be too easy
---
Really looking forward to the elite skin, gonna buy it for sure
---
His bio pretty much seems to point to that.
---
Sofia is the best all around versatile op in the game. Nothing situational about her, and a potential self revive to boot.
---
Ela's gerzmot,   
---
Nomad's Airjabs,   
---
Legion's GU,   
---
These are all proximity based mines.
---
I know how r6 works I‚Äôve been playing it since operation chimera and I wish i found it earlier tbh
---
Thanks
---
I think flawless ranked victory is a good idea
---
Not without dying like you said but just flawless ranked victory
---
mods hate him
---
There are a few people here that main ela and wholeheartedly say she is terrible

Year 1 or base game operators? Ultimate Edition comes with all year 1-4 Operators unlocked, the 20 Base game operators have reverted back to the old unlock system when year 4 started.

Hahaha can't disagree with that one. I mean more of how Lesion won't ever use the shotgun over really good SMG.
---
Yeah i know inned 10 bucks to change my name
---
Yeah you can't go more than 9 rounds now in ranked they removed the possibility for rounds to end in draws.
---
I believe lag switching is more of a temporary and controlled lag spike for everyone on the server until the culprit decides to end it. Usually it happens when the person doing the lag switching is on defense so the offense can't even get to the objective. I've had it happen a couple times on console. 
---
I've also been DDOS and that is more of a targeted attack on the individual users IP and pretty much doesn't end until you reset your network and get a new IP.
---
Not an expert but I've experienced both and those were the differences I noticed.
---
Explosive mines though...
---
You're welcome!

N√∏kk birthplace leaked: question mark island in the middle of the Indian Ocean

It's all about get used to the guns. I believe that's half of the equation to getting gud

10th But you cant get ops till a week later unless you have the season pass
---
GO4 make sure you have synergy with your teammates. Also, most people use MNK so don't be surprised if you lose. You can appeal to admins but they honestly can't do much. Also, come up with strats on GO4s (I recommend Kaosx and watching PL/CL) and please don't run out or do any ballsy ranked plays all the time, you'll get punished easily. Raw fragging power doesn't matter, it's all about time wasting on defence and being efficient on attack.  About the MNK players, just time waste and catch them off guard, aim isn't the game - always focus on OBJ. GO4s on PS4 are great but can be mentally draining - so please don't get too worked up over it, the best teams can adapt and not fret on the past. Finally, rehearse your maps on defence and make sure your team has designated roles. In my team, I'm the IGL and entry, then we've a pure support and three flex players. Good luck!
---
LMAOO, that McDonald‚Äôs WiFi though
---
Ok
---
Pretty good
---
I want a free play mode where you're not locked into attackers and defenders. I know certain oops would be stupid broken but I just want to see it.
---
Thanks man, people don't remember my real birthday so this is nice
---
good luck!üëç
---
Agreed.
---
Not really. Even if Nokk gets R4C she would still not be better than 3 Speed Attackers who can be as sneaky as Nokk while having faster rotation capability along with utilities for the team to benefit from.
---
I dont have a team :(
---
Quite informative but you did forget
---
Kaid‚Äôs Electroclaws are destroyed
---
Warden‚Äôs Glance smart glasses are disabled 
---
And bulletproof cameras are disabled
---
Bullet to the back of the dome. Or drugs.
---
You can see alibi swaying as well

Stepping on the beach daba do do do

Oh man you shoulda seen the other set of messages I blocked him and he started messaging me on his main account about how I was trash at the game and how he‚Äôs a top xbox player and I looked him up and he had a 1.3 k/d and only like 600 wins.

During Operation Health I was able to catch up with all the ops I didn't have yet, and stockpile renown for the future. I don't ever spend renown on anything except the ops, and like once a month maybe I'll buy some alpha packs. I have about 200,000 renown just sitting waiting until the new season drops (+ the week where only season pass holders can get them).

I think your describing a horror movie

Yo how often do you use that lol? Posted that on 3 different posts...

Take a look at the Original announcement trailer.
---
that is definitely true. But in terms of my group of friends not knowing who he was til last season but knowing about flanked and other streamers he seems underrated to me. I want everyone to know about him I guess lol.
---
Once the drones find the bombs and scanned a majority of people really no point to destroy them until the start of the round
---
I feel like the mp5sd would be good suppressor helps fit in with the operator
---
Is that not cav in a nutshell

HE HIT THAT DAB

If you know, you know.

Just had something like this happen to me the other night but it was on attack looking into obj

It‚Äôs always a castle that‚Äôs dumb

Mp5sd has arguably better recoil and (what people want most) an acog
---
I just don‚Äôt see Ela as a biker chick

Eerie

Yeah

Course I‚Äôve never been able to read her boi so.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm......

You lost me at losing her breaching charges. I'd rather take her flashbangs.

Simply because

J√§gers gun right

Yes

Oh god there‚Äôs more of them

Never too late. I started on June this year, when it was on sale. I had no friends who played this game at tht time. Now 4 of my friends have this and I got more than 10 random friends just by playing. Ya some LL be toxic. Avoid them by just muting. Be open to learn from anyone above u
---
 Jus say to them u are new and they LL teach. I learned that way. 
---
Btw I am copper 1 only now with lvl 104 and jus trying to have fun
---
I'd say give her Echo's MP5SPK instead
---
Those buffs for his gadget are bad, there's already a grenade indicator and operator gadgets tend to be very loud, such as the fuze charge, usually loud enough to where you can find and shoot the gadget through a wall
---
I understand the acog argument though. I don't think the mpx should get an acog, because it would be even more of a beast than the mp5 which is already one of the best guns in the game for long range firefights 
---
I think they should give him either the p90 or jackals smg (but remove the angled grip)
---
I also think they should make smoke's gas grenades have a solid cloud rather than the weird inconsistent translucent cloud we currently have, this would give the defenders some way to get better visual cover, keep the same area denial that smoke already has, and it would create synergy between two more ops, which is never a bad thing cuz teamwork
---
See the enemy. Feel the enemy. Become the enemy.
---
Obviously
---
that is the face of countless horror filled experiences
---
She‚Äôs super easy to counter every time I see her it‚Äôs a free win, ever since they nerfed the swap speed and fixed the clash glitch there‚Äôs really no viable strategy with her everyone also knows about the 360* strat now so even that is not viable.
---
how do you glitch it?
---
That was found during the test sever for operation Aussie auss
---
You're violating the law!
---
better to ensure 3 kills and hope your teammates not preparing 10 seconds after prep phase ended tho.
---
‚ÄúCAPS LOCK TO RELOAD‚Äù
---
when the season starts at 9/10 you can have the ops if you have sp, if not wait a week  hope the rephrasing good
---
Looks like those magicians did it again

Yeah Just missed some of the big name channels I never knew about it
---
you mean the classic ubisoft [showing a completely different game basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wlvYh0h63k)
---
big ok
---
that would be nice but ubisoft
---
I don‚Äôt care how easy she is to counter. As long as she is in the game it isn‚Äôt fun
---
That's MP5SD there my good man.
---
I cringe when i see those clips too bro. People really cant use their thumbs üëÄ
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ucHkNbyJY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ucHkNbyJY)  new channel and need some feedback
---
People argue for the MP5SD because it has a suppressor and therefore suits her stealthy style.
---
Console is easy mode try hitting plat on pc
---
The defenders are the good guys too...
---
Do you think FBIs like Pulse and Castle are bad ?
---
I paid a dollar for mine
---
lose your drone in the prep phase
---
And your reason for that is? Why does she make the game not fun?
---
Why not just leave ,it was a casual
---
What kaid gun has an acog???
---
I feel like you‚Äôre thinking too hard, because in retrospect. There is no defined lore of Rainbow Six Siege, besides the the operator bios.
---
Well i hate my memory loss

*laughs in mnk on console*

Yeah, I don‚Äôt agree with it and it‚Äôs def a scam but platinum isn‚Äôt easy to get. Props to you

Damn really?Feels bad.

---
Yeah they used to be good but then defected in order to use their skills for bad.
---
Why are castle and pulse defending bombs the police are trying to defuse?
---
not even close

Well that's not inherently true. The lore is established from the book. Then you add in all the information we already know from the character bios and videos.

Where do I get that glorious mask? I need it!

I‚Äôd love to see the video.

GetUwUedd is the name getting killed is my game

His is extremely situational, but can be useful. Rushing a hallway on plane with a tachanka in it is a death sentence

I would love it if he could counter interrogate cav

I can‚Äôt play siege while tripping. Not enough action bc of the whole wait to respawn thing. But it‚Äôs nice to know ppl can pull off something as ridiculous as that while having no idea what the hells going on üòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôll be honest with you I have no idea what‚Äôs happening when I play, I just play. If that makes sense lol
---
SUPER excited. I never got to play the outbreak event because I joined a season too late, and after watching game-play of it I've been craving to play it...(I'm assuming quarantine will be similar.)
---
XD nice
---
Yikes
---
They are spicing up the game, what harm is there in that? It‚Äôs not becoming pro league believe me, but it is becoming more competitive and for a competitive game to do so is a good thing.
---
It‚Äôs all good. I just realized it might‚Äôve  seemed like I was saying suicide is funny, which I‚Äôm most definitely not. Just wanted to explain a little more why I thought it was funny. My sense of humor is darker than most

So what if the ranked games are long, plus that‚Äôs a bs excuse now that we have pick and ban. Also it‚Äôs not like you are forced to use the tt. The other team can, that‚Äôs an extra 30s but you and your team don‚Äôt have to if they don‚Äôt want to. Seems like a win win to me
---
Well there's a precent chance of you get a legendary which is low. Then once is determined your getting a legendary, there's another precent chance of what that legendary is going to be which is higher meaning its easier to get duplicates. The reason they do it in this two step process is so they can put new skin in too the rarity pool they belong and not worry about the chance of getting it. The down side is more duplicates.
---
Is it the recoil? Just try burst firing
---
So triggered you had to look through my post history lmao
---
You should know where or is if you're looking at it. Use a mic to call it out
---
he almost looks innocent like he's not a terrorist bomber.
---
Yep.
---
She needs the mp7 or Kia like you said.
---
But most importantly, a gadget overhaul.
---
this, in ranked more thank anything
---
Reloading should also cancel ADS too.
---
I was half expecting him to get a wall bang tbh.
---
he looks almost innocent though like he's not a terrorist bomber.
---
please
---
Games themselves aren‚Äôt competitive people make them competitive sure I sometimes go sweat mode in a ranked game every now and then when me and my friends try to make it to plat but most of the time we are fucking off and casual is just to casual I would be ok if siege had its own pro league/ competitive playlist but still
---
James bond
---
My clip btw :\^)
---
Thats what the image on the post showing.
---
the forever gunfire sound?  
---
Yes, never fixed.
---
Is this all you? Or is it tool assisted? Ive seen some tool assisted speedruns before and I recognize that jiter kind of aiming. Amazing job either way.
---
Seriously tho, it‚Äôs so fucking boring just having a single teammate wipe the floor and not give anyone else a chance to do anything. Cool, free ELO. But did you have fun? No.
---
I got a black ice on my first pack I ever opened for the russian smg and a legendary on my fifth
---
For the baliff but I don't even have alibi or.maestro
---
Well i don't think it's in clubhouse anymore after the reworks
---
Is that Aaron Rodgers?
---
So you want to play casually but not play casual? That doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me. Plus this is a competitive game because it wouldn‚Äôt be in ESL if it wasn‚Äôt. You are allowed to play however you want in a game, that‚Äôs fine, but you can‚Äôt say that when they are changing the game for the better in terms of the competitiveness that it‚Äôs a bad thing, because that simply can‚Äôt be true.
---
?
---
And in a few days you'll get more
---
I find it crazy the ranks that fall for the alibi decoys, Silvers shoot them over and over, golds don't shoot them at all and plats shoot them out of reflex when they rush.
---
I made the image. I don't recall it ever being a point

should we assume that you didn‚Äôt get a 5 on the test

I mean she‚Äôs no where near as broken as some other ops. Just don‚Äôt care. People still claim lion is OP after his nerf and people always complain about jackle when he can be avoided by just positioning your self right. So don‚Äôt care and play who you  like. You shouldn‚Äôt have to have less fun cause others complain about a reasonable part of the game. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs Blackbeard who has 2 lives basically

I think it would technically count as a macro. My mouse also has a double click button built in. I just avoid it for the most part so people dont get mad
---
How does your friend like to play? It‚Äôs easier to find an operator that fits his play style than to try to fit his play style to a good operator. Granted, he‚Äôll still probably need to adjust the way he plays a little bit he‚Äôll feel that out on his own

And let‚Äôs not forget the frags lol, I‚Äôve played a lot of Finka and I cant tell you that The LMG is most of the time what you want to be using. But if you‚Äôre gonna rush or you‚Äôre on cq maps the shotgun will not let you down ( most of the time). Honestly the only advantage of the spear is the faster ads time. But it does like 10 dmg less than the lmg and only 20 rpm more.

I think you need to be older than 18 to accses the website so if you entered an age lower than 18 you get blocked. But try incognito mode or if you have a vpn and you should be able to see it.
---
It all but says it, yeah.
---
Those 2 guns you've suggested would be fine. The community says she should get MP5SD and I'd settle for that too, though honestly I'd go for the K1A.
---
Whatever the gun among those mentioned above, let's hope Ubi addresses Nokk's problem.
---
no he didnt, the elevator is too dark for you to see the guy.
---
you can't buff it without buffing smoke and he's a must pick defender.
---
you can buff her ability to an extent until she has the lowest pick rate and people will keep asking for a new gun ubi will need to do something, That or rework her where she can't trigger electric traps then her pickrate would go up.
---
Her ability isn't the issue it's her choice of shit primaries.
---

One can dream. I love talking about this game almost as much as I love playing it. I've been play for almost a year and a half now and my aim is still potato, but my actual game knowledge is real big brain. My friends that play constantly tease me for knowing the dumbest shit. But at this point it's a 50/50 of either having such great game sense combined with game knowledge that leads to great plays, or I'm dumb af and have the worst call outs (because I'm probably dead anyways).
---
What platform are you on?
---
Alright chief I'll wait to get her 
---
Thanks for the help :D
---
nice
---
As long as it doesn't get strong enough to compete against SMG11 + Shotgun combo, I think it's possible to buff FMG without really making Smoke that much stronger than in his current state.

Zofia isn't dropping in price next season. Evert DLC operator drops in price every 12 months, currently Zofia's price is set at 20k renown, with the next scheduled price drop being Y4S4.  Here's a handy dandy chart of the current prices of operators and when they're scheduled to go down; [https://siege.dangeraspect.xyz/assets/images/operator-prices/OperatorPricesY4S2.png](https://siege.dangeraspect.xyz/assets/images/operator-prices/OperatorPricesY4S2.png) *(Props to DangerAspect from the R6 Discord for making it)*
---
As for the release date of Y4S3, the release date ha not yet been announced, so all the dates you're being told are merely speculations. I'd imagine it being around September 9-10th, but only Ubisoft can confirm whether that's the case or not.
---
Lol same. Nice to see other people out there that are actually well mannered and very knowledgeable of the game and it‚Äôs core. I better get to bed, staying up this late has been killing me lately. It‚Äôs been good talking about this kind of stuff.

Alibi has the 1911(might be incorrect) in her bio picture and it always annoys me knowing that it‚Äôs there

Whats wrong with it
---
It sucks aye cause I was going 6-3 it happend twice by the 2nd game I was with a 5 stack we all got server disconnected the guy who was with me said ‚ÄúGod dammit Ubi‚Äù
---
Well because the point of ranked is to take it serious...
---
Sounds about right
---
I love the slow realization at the end
---
LET THEM COME
---
it doesn't matter because it's her gun that's the issue she cannot hold angles good like all other attackers, her primary is just weak and buffing it is just pointless you can't buff it without needing to buff it for smoke as they can't buff things separately they already have said this, it's not because Nokk has no ACOG it's because she has the weakest gun for an attacker.
---
ubi thought she'd be broken at launch and it turns out they are wrong.
---
Frick you
---
Not using an smg-11 on smoke?! I could never
---
No one else look further to see that a guy was behind the free weekend player....
---
Yo I play clash in ranked and she is annoying as fuck to the enemy team. You can delay them and if you're good enough with her you can swap to your gun, turn around crouch so they have to readjust there aim and that usually works. But you only do that if there is one enemy maybe two if you're a mad man
---
"Realistic" just pick up the stim pistol of the dead doc next to you jager ffs
---

Nokk is a good operator. Stop complaining

Underrated comment. Wish I could upvote this more.

Jackel gets banned every ranked, doc is the most useful outta the options tho
---
I bought it 5 days ago, was discounted to 10 Euro, had some spare money on my account so I thought what the hell, bought it. I really enjoy shooters, and Rainbow is one hell of a game. It‚Äôs very realistic, in the sense that there are no gamertags above enemies, you have to rely on your own eyes to spot them from a distance. You can‚Äôt take 10 shots before dying like in Black Ops, for example, merely a few bullets and you‚Äôre done. The game is very strategic, there are two teams, one attacks, the other defends. Gamemodes range from Secure the Objective to Rescue the Hostage. As an attacker, you have to choose a route through a building to the room, then break through the defences. There are many operators, with different abilities to suit your play style. I really like the game, it takes some getting used to but you‚Äôll get the hang of it in no time. I‚Äôd rate it 8/10, definitely worth the buy, especially discounted.
---
Ps4
---
But I do prefer unique and quirky looking rifles or civilian military rifles. They are different than your average AR-15, and I have seen many guys with 3-5 ARs that look exactly the same. I like variety, but there is no point unless you look cool lol

I have basically lived on both games for the better part of a year lol. Siege is more toxic in some ways, less in others. In OW the toxicity was always so devastating because you have to work with said player, as a 5v6 is basically a lost game. That isn‚Äôt true for rainbow. I‚Äôve had toxic teammates that we just took turns killing at the beginning of each round, and still won the game. Rainbow community is a lot more blatant with the toxicity as well. Whereas in overwatch a handful of reports will result in a ban. It takes MUCH more for siege. Ppl are not afraid to shit on you in text chat, or spam cuss words, etc. that doesn‚Äôt really happen in overwatch. I think you will see ppl occasionally get way more aggressive/toxic than you are used to in overwatch, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to bother the community as much here. You mute them and move on. You can‚Äôt really do that in overwatch (without losing) so I‚Äôve personally found the toxicity much easier to deal with.
---
"almost"
---
Give it some time. They‚Äôre stretching this over the next 7 years. I don‚Äôt doubt they do this. 
---
But the G8 isn‚Äôt actually bad. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to say ‚Äúno one wants to use it‚Äù, that‚Äôs quite a stretch.
---
BBs MK.17 is pretty piss-poor but we don‚Äôt have much choice in wether we want to use it or not when we play, do we?
---
I want to see the Alda 5.56, K1A, Vector, 9x19 VSN on attack one day.
---
But do you frag with her?
---
I disagree with the dude who said wait. I‚Äôd get her now and just use this time to make up majority of the spent renown. Plus she‚Äôs gunna be more versatile than the new ops so I‚Äôd wait for them and got zofia ASAP since you can always play her.
---
You are one of those i guess.
---
I fell in live with r6 because its not just a shooter, it involves strategy too and I think Castle gives you this set up potential and promotes a good strategy
---
Damn I was gunna suggest maybe combining our two groups but I‚Äôm on Xbox. You‚Äôre fault not mine  /s
---
/cheers Not me
---
Yes. Some rounds I will just sit there shocking the enemy team and maybe get a kill but when I decide to play agro I will get atleast 1 kill
---
He‚Äôs totally worth it. I Usually place one drone in one important spot (like stars or bomb sites) and use the other 2 moving around the map while e lurk

I got RSS on friday with the free week. I and a few friends then bought it (on discount) on saturday. i have been a solid COD and BF player for a while but Blackops 4 is past the point of saving now and BF is having big issues. I Digress. This game has a big learning curve, choosing the operators that suit your play style. learning to rush or hold (not camp lol)  but if you have a solid team or a group of friends its so fun. You learn very quickly to become creative (making sight lines by shooting/punching small holes in walls etc) playing objectives by blowing holes in roofs / floors windows etc. Its a lot of fun but requires time. Dont be put off if youre not great in the first week etc. there are so many players that have been playing for a while that know all the spots etc. but you will learn ! :)
---
IMO i would say go for it. i mean less than ¬£8 you cant go wrong.

Already have those defenders, his guns seem strong from what I‚Äôve heard from other people and ofc getting killed by him.
---
Ty
---
Why his head so tiny
---
I think the problem is it can't just use the same asset like that, because it doesn't use the character model, and I would imagine there's significant metadata differences (different attachment nodes, etc...) between the two asset types.
---
Yes the p10 is a no recoil death machine and the commando is nice to and killing people with a shock drone is nice to

well if u want then okay i just dislike him

Both of them if you have a full team and the enemy relies on drones

Mute if there are less drones but people who play dokki and shit

Mozzie for people who do not drone much as it allows you to have the info advantage

These are my opinions because they have worked for me

Wtf is that laser sight placement

Yeah something like that

have kinda bad feelings about this word maybe would be better to use another one

I have over 150 in this game and only have two operators.

Get the MVP with just 2 kills and 3 assists

So by the looks of it gold has the game + season pass, meaning you'd get the 8 ops from this season (as they come).

Unsure about year 1, but in some pages it says it comes with. I'd double check that wherever you're buying it in case (I can't browse the ubi store on phone apparently).

Actually alphama‚Äôs account is still alphama if you go and search it on stats website

And risze acezz and korey have .GIA in front of their name and not .VGIA

But for some reason they played with .VGIA in major

And because lan is offline you can keep whatever name you want

Is it even his?Acog on ash means this clip is very old no?Why did he say he just got it?
---
i could tell you were surprised , but it was a well deserved ace just because they decided to rush you. i hate it when the other team gets impatient or cocky and starts to rush out. you put them in their place
---
Okay this is probably what I‚Äôll do, solid feedback. Any defenders better/equal to these level of defenders?
---
With the current state of her gadget? Highly unlikely since you'll still be useless to the team.
---
True that.

I have no idea how people do this

Wouldn't really call this a rush but I Fuzed the bedroom on house for an ace

A pc that runs siege costs less than a console and the device to use mouse and keyboard on said console

If you use the windows/xbox overlay it'll tell you gpu usage, cpu usage, and ram usage by the game you're playing.

Press Windows + G

Maybe using the shift+f4 buying?

You have to press the gadget button again. If it is middle mouse for you, then yes, that's the button.

Must be bugged. Restart should fix that.

Can you imagine the backlash and the sanctions Ubi would face if the next 911 incident revealed that the participants had played Siege in their countries?

I‚Äôm positive he your friend was right because that‚Äôs what I do, if it still doesn‚Äôt work mess with ur settings and if u really have to, reset some of ur stuff to default. (The communities nickname for Hibana‚Äôs gadget is fidget spinners which is easier to say)

I'm pretty sure advertising is against the rules bud.

Castle is totally useless tho and doesn't make any impact on my game. And capitao is who I try to ban anyway

The trend is increasing. Not sure about other games, since R6 is the only multiplayer game I play.

I started it about one and a half year ago and I definitely feel a change.

Why would you say it does when you don‚Äôt even know for sure?

That was my understanding of the system 
---
Guess i was wrong
---
The face you make when you know you fucked up

You will lose every operator you didn't own before you got the ultimate edition. Like if you had every dlc except hibana you would only lose hibana when your trial ended.

This is how I think of people who main blitz

WE WANT TACHANKA#
---
What room did that get? Is it the small hallway next to the site?
---
I want them too but they are so expensive it is like they don't want you to have them!
---
Now fear my ultimate power „ÄåZa Shieldo„Äç 
---
You are now flashed. My max flash time is 7 seconds
---
What's with your hud?
---
~~Agreed~~
---
It's called a free week, the games free for a while so there's a bunch of new accounts and smurf accounts that are throwing to play in lower ranked games, that sort of thing
---
Holy shit. That‚Äôs so cool
---
Looks really good, thought it was a painting at first
---
Play console you just get ddossed
---
How you identify them?
---
Hey everyone :3
---
Just wanted to share the awesome picture mllebellec made for me.
---
I had a lot of fun Cosplaying Ela and I want to do a lot more cosplays now :D.
---
My Cosplay IG is @zentiacosplay :).
---
Im not sure if thats a collar or a choker... Not sure which would be better either
---
Even still why am I not being matched with good players my level?
---
He's right, it is low effort, who cares if the guy got the skin thats been in the game for ages especially on an op he's never going to use, dont get why you lot upvote the karma farm low effort BS
---
Ty :) I really like her editing :3
---
Did you bring icecream cones with you?
---
I also lost 1749 ELO for a winning match last night :(
---
Wait youre saying you cant hit gold but youre playing with ppl Below level 30??
---
Because it‚Äôs not that big of a deal?
---
Pickrates should be changed as operator and map meta's dictate, operators shouldn't be picked purely on weapon, they should be picked on ability and team coordination
---
Yes and I‚Äôm level 189, so I‚Äôm wondering why I‚Äôm getting out on teams with these morons
---
what the hell!! Lmao
---
Please stop calling developers lazy.
---
I don't even like the black ice skins. I don't like any skins that change the texture of the gun, personally
---
Just, dont leave the match if you die, learn.
---
This game is about it, not allways you are suposed to be John Wick, but this game, i can promise, it can make you feel like him.
---
Main issue is that if you're bringing Fuze you're not bringing someone like Zofia or Twitch etc.
---
They removed an entire operator for a month
---
BB‚Äôs ability never bothered me when I play against him but he isn‚Äôt fun to play. He‚Äôs way to one dimensional. Hold angle and wait as you are way to slow to do anything else and your gun sucks.
---
It looks like that character customisation feature in Dark Souls 1 where you can select tiny head
---
Well.. Maybe that's because I'm indeed a biological man...
---
They have the rights
---
Aim for the bushes
---
And what does that have to do with you calling them lazy?
---
Just ban all shield ops. Mainly monty
---
I would say this is a step in the right direction but a step back too. At least we didn't have to buy some stupid alpha packs foe a chance at getting what you want. The step back is making them limited time only. Why?
---
Naisu :D
---
Jackal is banned for convenience reasons. 
---
Firstly both his guns are amazing so he‚Äôs a good ban just for that fact. 
---
Having the ability to locate a roamer is very strong. If you have a well organized team, you can go pick off the roamers early on in the round and then it‚Äôs an easy (most of the time) win vs the remaining anchors. 
---
Jackal is banned because it makes you feel safer knowing you can move around from room to room and not have to worry about your footsteps being tracked. I know like you said there are better bans. But it‚Äôs just the peace of mind factor to me why he is banned. 
---
I roam a lot, and when I started learning I absolutely hated playing against jackals. I‚Äôve learned how to counter him and I would intentionally go to a room knowing I‚Äôd get tracked so I can in return learn his location as well. But anyways to answer your question 
---
He‚Äôs banned because his ability makes it harder to roam, and people don‚Äôt like their location being given away from an ability (lion)
---
I mean i love this game to death but the devs have serious issues.
---
are there any option that is better than hibana? or hibana is the best for me
---
Fair point so I‚Äôm just hoping they don‚Äôt lock them again or I have to continue my tedious grind( but it does come with the season pass ops
---
FUS RO DAH!
---
Well they made them free because Starter edition was a thing and the DLC operators costed 25K
---
is this a reference to something? because the poses are kinda specific.
---
Same bruh. No random kicking
---
Ah yes, finally some good r6 material
---
If you have the renown the spend, I‚Äôd reccomend giving Finka a try. She‚Äôs fun, she‚Äôs versatile, and she has drag grenades which are always a blast to use.
---
its that easy haha..
---
Team rocket blast of again
---
why is that?
---
what about her recoil?
---
If you don't have Capitao, he's a good option.
---
LOOK
---
You auctually may be able to because microsoft says that any game you have on xbox you can also have on a winddows pc, but you may have needed to get it from the microsoft online game store first idk
---
*Soviet National Anthem Intensifies*
---
Cos summer and coercing customers into spending more impulsively. Its for dumb people with no will power.
---
*pirates of the Caribbean music*
---
Which one??
---
Thank you I agree
---
Then yeah you get the 8 Y1 and you'll be unlocki the 8 Y4 :)
---
Really? Clash!
---
No. Fuze‚Äôs AK is what makes him special. Give him to someone else, and you would ruin it.
---
If you think about it, people are not creative and independent enough in terms of choosing a operator. Picking Ash/Twitch is like a habit - you don‚Äôt pick anyone else because there is a thought that if everyone picks, why should i not? 
---
On paper, Fuze‚Äôs gadget is OK for clearing rooms(in fact, most people don‚Äôt even understands that his gadget isn‚Äôt suited for kills that much), his guns are superb, and he is lacking in terms of speed.  But he is unpopular, because people got used so much to other ops with Fast RPM guns they didn‚Äôt even give Fuze a chance and do not want to learn how to play him. 
---
If you take away that gun that makes him special, there won‚Äôt be any reasons to pick him, even for casual player.
---
i dont have him,is he fun to use? and what about his recoil
---
Flair checks out
---
**How The Turned Tables Ol' Chap!**
---
As smoke, gas Blitz, IQ, and *ACCIDENTALLY* gas a Jager or Bandit.
---
**RUSH B DON'T STOP**
---
As an entire team of Russian Ops, rush into B site within 45 seconds of the round and Die or get Bomb down.
---
**I think we've been here Before**
---
As IQ or Blitz, Kill Ela, a French Op, and a Russian Op before being killed by another Russian Op.
---
**Welcome to the Jungle**
---
As an American Op, team up with a Capitao to flush the enemy into a Firebolt.
---
Ela wasnt that bad, they nerfed her into oblivion imo
---
we have 2 variants of fal, 3 mp5, 2 ak  (not counting zofias  m762 since it's only based on ak platform and not ak  itself) , and a lot m4 . They are already reusing ideas in but different versions.
---
Pls don‚Äôt
---
The spear‚Äôs recoil is minimal, and pretty much straight up and down. Her special ability makes her entire team have practically no recoil as well as a load of different small buffs, including a health boost. She has access to the Russian LMG, as well as the Russian shotgun. As well, both weapons are decent, and her shotgun is particularly fun to use after boosting yourself and running into a room with a semi automatic shotgun with no recoil. Her primary rifle, the Spear .308 is my go to weapon on her though.
---
One minor suggestion replace mute with recruit and let the recruit mains rise up
---
Siege is growing in popularity what are you on about?
---
Lol no they don‚Äôt. They have to buy licenses to use each gun. It‚Äôs not laziness.
---
or maybe you do. everyone did 5 seconds of research and know that engine limitations are keeping them from adding new guns.
---
*Tachanka comes in on a boat*
---
Upvote now, it is no longer time
---
Y u so smol
---
Because she was so bugged that leaving her as an available option would have caused more issues than removing her while they tried to fix her.  The same went for shields and claymores.
---
Interesting that we cannot see the FPS in the corner....almost like it is disguising the sped up footage. Come back to me when you do this with visible FPS counter.
---
I got it from Microsoft store

There isnt really such a thing as ddos protection the only thing i could see ubi trying to implement is having an OVH or VPN on the server so when ppl pull the ip they pull the vpn ip and not the server
---
Well blame it on the players who abused the glitch instead .
---
No, Obsidian (Year 2 skin) can be be used on all Year 3 operators that means there isn't a reason why the Damascus Steel (Year 3 skin) can not be used with Year 4 operators, Mozzie and Gridlock to be precise since they are the only operators this Year that got new weapons.
---
People need to stop complaining about them re using weapons  this game has plenty of guns
---
tbh i love the P10-C but the SPSMG9 is just better in almost every way so i use the smg
---
This pleases me
---
A gadget is one thing...but a whole Operator that people paid real money for.
---
The art‚Äôs nice but Jojo references are really played out.
---
It will soon be unavailable through steam too.
---
That beard looks really good how did you make It to look like that ?
---
Germans (blitz) lost against Russians (kapkan and Tachanka) in WWII
---
Lmaooo*
---
Very good game, also bought this a few days ago. I am level 30 now. It is not noob friendly. The community (ps4) is super toxic. THe mechanics are not simple like CoD.   
---
However I figured the game out rather fast (obviously not a pro or anything though) but I enjoy the game a lot. just get ready for toxic chat, being kicked randomly, team killing, and learning curves.
---
I like this idea. Adds another dimension to shotguns rather than it just being a destructive tool that you can *sometimes* rely on
---
You're 18 days late get with the program
---
It ain't abnormal to me so cool it. 
---
I watched it with no audio so I did not realise there was normal audio. My bad.
---
The footage looked jittery :P
---
Take a chill pill....its only THunt lol :P
---
I‚Äôm dumb, I mean Japan. I see Echo and Hibana, but who else is from there.
---
Yeah nah i don't think so
---
Ash is not a better choice because she gets dumpstered by Zofia in just about every way possible but whatever
---
Those operators you pointed out have nothing to do with Nokk they have different roles so your point is pretty much invalid
---
I see. Yeah, th√© toxicity in overwatch males it that the teams cannot work as team and some people throw.
---
I have had also many, many games where people leave I'm th√© middle of ranked games because they don't knowing however too lose and sometimes we fight a 4 VS 6 and it sucks.
---
I'm used to more blatant aggressive words in chat as you say, I only ignore them
---
Every time, whenever I draw a little drawing with my limited art skills and post it in my friend‚Äôs group chat. Another friend reposts masterpieces by ppl like u. Then I go cry in a corner because literally no one would look at mine anymore. Shame on you for being too good.
---
What a steal!
---
idk, i get matched with people who are level 100+ in casual and they suck ass
---
Nah, It's fine. No need to apologise. It happens.
---
No, they removed it to fix it and to let the fix be huge since was for shields, not for clash, they had to be sure that the fix wouldn't have compromised something else.
---
Tell me the point of having favela and yacht in ranked, the only one you can actually complain about for it's pointlessly design is skyscraper.
---
The game at the time (operation health) was becoming big, one of the most influent operation, they had to do something quickly to change something, I remember what changed, and if they didn't, this game would be bad, I think you never played before operation health since you're saying that.
---
It's like saying that &lt;fps game name&gt; has every weapon in the world, yeah, cool, but I want to see smg-11 as a name, not submachine Gun.
---
It will end before the weekend comes around. I‚Äôd recommend getting it today if possible.
---
I dunno, but it should be
---
as you may see...he didnt even get time to play
---
For me its either twitch or thatcher depending if were attacking or defending first. If im attacking I ban monty
---
Practice: Use t-hunts to improve aim and learn maps. Casuals to improve your PvP combat. Steep learning curve for most, but find some other people to play with constantly and you will enjoy this game greatly.
---
I kinda hate that you pointed that out because I would never notice this myself and now this will bother me.
---
Personally, everything on medium or low (textures are a preference depending on your hardware, I use medium since there's little to no performance hit for me), shadows should be on at least medium, as when you go below that you lose dynamic shadows which can be helpful, as someone else mentioned. Turn AA, depth of field, and lense effects off.
---
As far as it looking blurry, make sure you don't have the resolution scale set below native. Also the temporal AA can sometimes cause the picture to be blurry as well.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Next Tuesday supposedly
---
2,5 hours in Steam
---
This is why I don't play PC
---
Her SMG has a really high DPS in close range and that fire rate really helps you getting headshots. 
---
I remember used to liking pistol more for slight faster traveling when I needed to rotate but that was before the full auto buff on her MP9.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a thing.  I bought the $15 version because I was unsure of if I would even like the game and I worked through needing to buy all of the ops.  I still don‚Äôt have them all, honestly, but I don‚Äôt play as much.
---
i mean i mostly only play on fri/weekends and i usually buy 2-3 seasonal camos + other shit, and each of those are 25k or so
---
I don‚Äôt encounter a lot of toxic people every now and then you‚Äôll come across some
---
use the search bar
---
Favela and Yacht were removed from the game entirely. Ive been playing since March 2016...imma be back after my appointment to bitch
---
valk headgear was an instabuy for me, but the rest arent that good imo
---
Hibana and Echo are the only ones from Japan. Glaz was born nearby but in Russia. Is that what you mean?
---
That'll make a good phone case
---
Nice cheers man
---
I had a mnk but you can‚Äôt flick, it feels very latent  and imprecise, it‚Äôs impossible to turn as fast as you can on controller, and the only thing you get is small aim adjustments that could just as easily be done with some kontrolfreeks. Unless it‚Äôs like a XIM or something I‚Äôd rather have a scuf controller any day.
---
Thanks!
---
Cheers man
---
Why did we have to watch 30 seconds of nothing to see 3 seconds of interesting
---
We all have these kind of moments good for you fellow console player
---
I did watched guides. I knew I had to quit because I didn't enjoy it even after pouring hundreds of hours training. I haven't enjoyed them game for months tbh.
---
People leaves in the middle of ranked matches, people throw, you somehow need 6 people to work together and I'll be honest, I just have 1-2 hours sometimes in a day to play. I can't organize with friends to play on weeks. I just want to play a nice chill multi-player to steam offensive then stress off the day
---
Do we know when does it release?
---
Please for the love of the god . Use google search . It won't spawn peek you .
---
Don't take this as offensive . I just hate seeing the same posts over and over.
---
It's coming next week . End of discussion
---
Didn't answer to my operation health question, so this is my answer to
---
&gt;Ive been playing since March 2016
---
**Press x to doubt**
---
\^\^underappreciated comment here\^\^
---
&gt;!Captain America quote from Age of Ultron!&lt;
---
It looks like there is a third operator icon in between their icons. I guess I got bamboozled by pixels.
---
I feel you, this triggers me as because these are my main skins for every operator (Primary Obsidian, Secondary Damascus Steel) and especially since we finally got the black holo, it goes perfectly with obsidian.
---
Thats bad, feel sorry for you man
---
My bad I wasn't being intentionally beinng toxic i just meant you were insinuating there was some form of foul play involved. I apologise.
---
OP is already getting shit on. I dont mind the reuse of weapons I care more about abilities
---
Who will be interested [here is my twitter](https://twitter.com/LineKotsi)
---
It's the most complicated arcade shooter I ever played and I love it for it. Map Knowledge, where drone vents are, operator gadgets and how they counter or interact with each other. It all takes time.
---
Stop saying PCs are cheaper than consoles they just aren‚Äôt
---
you're a retard if you think Zofia is better than ash and your argument is irrelevant, That and if you think Nokk is better than any 3 speed you're mentally challenged.
---
If we find a repost without credit, how should we report it?
---
Man you smurf on newcomers??? You are just a bully lol I learned not to play newcomers after 2 games lol
---
"Nokk uses 9mm gun but has AR mags on her vest!"
---
I think gold is a good option giving you freedom of new ops but still letting you have something to work towards, it's fun buying a new op and might be a bit less fulfilling if you have all of them
---
I suppose. Still seems like a weird flex.
---
People who use the term ‚Äúcamping‚Äù don‚Äôt play this game very much.....
---
this is why i hate ongoing matches
---
Absofrigginlutely
---
Recoil is low because of how low her fire rate is
---
Frost mats are very visible and took a serious hit after their health nerf (which I think was unnecessary).
---
No problem! Feel free to ask if you have anymore questions.
---
You preach old news
---
Ok, thank you for the advice
---
Well another option is to just overlay the cosmetics to the hologram. Im sure ubi didnt put any new hitboxes on these headgears so it shouldnt interfere with anything.
---
It really is just as simple as creating a new prop. It's not like alibi has a thousand cosmetics.
---
Lesion is a much better alternative for the points your friend gave you. Lesion provides a ton of intel and late game pushes won't be able to see the gu and will give your team a pretty loud sound que to hunt down the enemy
---
Frost reminds me of Cr1tikal with his long hair. Nice artwork!
---
idk
---
Oh yes again
---
&gt;oh ... i just found out so
---
Ive only played one week, but people seem to be helpful but I dont play ranked so I wouldnt know
---
Now imagine if Lesion had a Lego elite skin and his Gu mines are Legos . I can imagine someone screaming like [William](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn6hhrX34Pw) when he steps on it
---
I can hear his voice in my head as I read this
---
Mhm, mhm, notes, notes. Anything else? Lol can‚Äôt wait to try some of this out later
---
Who is cheating and how? Reload animation Fuck up or?
---
All online communities have toxicity, especially competitive ones. It's just really easy to abuse the systems in R6 to make your toxicity much more palpable. All of the systems that make Siege the unique experience that it is also serve to let toxic people completely fuck your shit up.
---
Nothing you can do but mute, report, and move on, honestly.
---
Ty :3
---
Well, I needed a lot of time for researching everything and figuring out how to do it. But then everything came a little late and I had to rush it.
---
Kinda did everything in one week then and needed the most time for the hood. A girl friend helped me paint it a few hours before I had to get to the train for the convention after I worked on it through the night and didn't sleep.
---
I still didn't finish some parts like the patches and still need to improve my cosplay. But I was very happy how it turned out and that everything still worked out :3.
---
A tad bit to the right or left would be a bad time
---
Well frost is getting it back
---
THEN WHY NOT CASTLE
---
VE CONSISTENT UBI
---
Notable parts, A10-7850K bought for ¬£80 Radeon RX 480 bought for ¬£230, 16gb ddr3 ram which Google says is ¬£25 at most new, that's under 400 so far. I dare say the motherboard was that expensive, and the power supply wouldn't be too expensive either. Mouse and keyboard ¬£5 each.

Report through button or via modmail.

We judge case by case whether a post should be removed or not.

If it was published without credits because the OP does not know the author but then someone in the comments puts the source and more than 6 months have passed since the publication we leave it.

If a post is stolen and the OP wants to pass it as his own it is removed (and we also take actions on the user's account)

KameHameHaaaaa

I'd prefer to waste my time *efficiently*
---
My dude I did this in Call of Duty to get used to insane sensitivity levels 8 years ago. Siege isn't Call of Duty, and I can say without a question of a doubt I'm on the sens that is comfortable and precise for me, which is way more important for this game. I've been using a controller for a decade so I'm pretty sure I know my way around one. And nothing you said changes the fact MnK has inherent advantages over a controller. There's no way in hell anybody, no matter what sensitivity they are on, is going to be able to control recoil with a controller as precisely as you could with a mouse.
---
It's fun to use. I'm probably gonna have to pick up goyo just for the tcsg and 2 speed
---
I clutched 3 rounds i a row in a 1 vs 3 last game, we would have lost if I safed my kda. It is a problem when you solo q and no one is a caller, so try to fit in this rolle. I lost countless times because the whole team ‚Äûtaked there time‚Äú
---
This is fucking sick
---
/s
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre powered up, get in there‚Äù
---
not new enough
---
valk gots life guard so were fine she will pull to shore if he droned
---
Starting year 4 (this year) starter ops aren't free.
---
ngl but this might get banned
---
They changed it, but you‚Äôre first op from each ctu will only be 500 renown then increase by 500 each op you get
---
Id love to dig into the archives for you but the truth is i dont have time. And were not talking about current ela. 
---
Just make a post asking how op was ela and im sure youll get many replies with people who can find time to find it for you. 
---
Btw its not just the one streamer go watch any pros VOD from operation health wait 10 mins and theyll definitely complain about ela being op.
---
Not new at all
---
if you run out backdoor then a well placed c4 would be pretty cool
---
It‚Äôs actually-100 for whoever Teamkills the guy reinforcing it.
---
I‚Äôm tryna convince a dude on the discord that Mavericks‚Äô easily hotter than Jackal but he won‚Äôt listen
---
Frost
---
yes because using your pc on your tv is completely an option.
---
my family loves it when i drag my big ass pc case to the living room to play a few games of siege.
---
In my head I said yeet when sledge hit that hatch
---
I dont understand how someone can not restart the que after 2min
---
¬øQu√©?
---
Well sure, but if you want to compete with MnK players, which is much, much, much easier than everyone here makes it sound, just run a high sensitivity. If someone‚Äôs playing MnK on console it‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt good enough to play MnK on pc where it belongs, which means they‚Äôre really not that great at the game.
---
I serve the Soviet Union
---
I restarted it four times. I simply added it up to fifteen minutes.
---
Put.....put your dick in it.
---
It‚Äôs called a flair. Tap/click the subreddit name and then click the three dots on the top right corner, click changer user flair.
---
didnt work , thx tho
---
Haha I‚Äôm not sure it was a well documented change they just added the pistol speed thing in sometime in the last few operations I think, I wish you luck making this even faster with your newfound information!
---
Yeah that's gunna be a report for toxic behavior from me dawg
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt even know anything about the operators apart from their gadgets
---
it goes to the same page and still doesnt work , thanks for the suggestion
---
why did you say that i can't unsee it now
---
**300% A N G E R Y**
---
what the fuck did you take this with? an ipod nano?
---
Well if you're gonna use a console on the family TV i dont see why you can't use your PC on it?
---
It's almost overpowered, but it would make sense and make her a much more picked op for sure.
---
Thermite is only 20 min away!

That would be kinda cool I think, logically in real life it would make no sense. But guessing how her device wipes her off screen while not being connect to it I could see how it works, could like fool their detection area or something of the sort. If you wanted to get more behind it, but honestly that would make a great buff to her as she could flank easier without getting exposed.

Let me get this straight, you're telling all the people who use CONTROLLERS on CONSOLE to play on PC instead as to not ruin the experience for those using MOUSE AND KEYBOARD on CONSOLE? Do you have any idea how backwards that is?

Buck

Yeah but now the games seems pretty good and balanced to me, lost its realistic purpose, but still a masterpiece.
---
Oh the irony of thinking it isn't toxic to go around shitposting about how toxic people are. This is the backlash you deserve, it doesn't make me toxic.

You should make a new one if you think you‚Äôve improved in the computer art thing, I‚Äôd like to see a more updated version. But yeah I think it‚Äôs really good.

TOXINS ‚ôÇ SET

Free weekend was more of a recruit massacre for me.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm not sure what software I could use though. My school provided it on their computers but now I would have to use my personal computer and I‚Äôm unsure about what software I should use.
---
I didn't know the season pass owners have to wait like non-season pass owners /s
---
While I do agree with that 100% I still feel he needs to be buffed or have something added as most people just play him for the memes/fun. But chonk has a shield on the turret for his head and most people put him in a corner to avoid being flanked on the side and when people do kill him it‚Äôs usually from body shots if he is on the shield
---
I'm just going to assume that you don't know how 3D animations work and how difficult they are to build...
---
Beta was shitty compared to its level now, I remember it and I wish it wasn't there. LUL
---
It's an extended beta in my book
---
Well you resamble her really nicely, have to admit.
---
Also, do you think ela is still a good op? Bc every time i play her i die in 20 secs, and yet i dont even roam allot or spawnpeek.
---
Handing the w to the attackers is never good.
---
Would recommend gold or ultimate?
---
Ahh. Well I hope you can find something and message me through this post or something whenever you find something to do it on
---
We ain't got the soul stone/"dark orange" tho
---
Do they teach you about this symbol ? In pre school?If not then you might outta learn about it.Its quite crucial if you wanna grow up.Legit was just asking questions.Y u hafta be mad
---
Show me fire and I'll think you're right.
---
Can do.
---
New lock screen thank you
---
Boomer Capit√£o was genuinely good tho
---
I wasn't playing during the beta but it feels like an unfinished game
---
Do the daily missions, the easiest one are the ones that ask you to play as a certain force and then kill yourself as fast as you can, because you don't need to finish them in order to complete the daily.
---
Also, use the ubiclub, you have more missions there that gives you 150 renown or more
---
I don't understand what's going on, but continue
---
SLEDGE SMASH
---
FYI, this is a new thing. If you're an older Siege player and this is blowing your mind, it's because it's a recent rework.
---
Yea it has but you have to look almost straight down to activate this animation so you hardly see it. Also that debris went flying
---
Sludge aka fucking shit up.
---
Gorgeous
---
They want to reach 100 op so yeah, if you see it like that it's understandable.
---
At Least they dont charge an outrageous price for it
---
*German music intensifies*
---
That is awesome, i'm sure i've not seen that before.
---
Maybe!
---
Nope. A phone. Its just a bad drawing.
---
Platform?
---
hes talking about the "silent walk", you can see before i go in the stairs.
---
I feel your pain dude. It sometimes takes me 2 hours to download a gigabyte
---
I second this
---
They should've expanded the Year 1 dlc CTUs...
---
Extended barrel on the SMG-11? Blasphemy
---
Yes, because he cant move to stop this, like my other comment says, best possible rework would be to make him mobile and give him the suicide bombers health. It would allow him to lock down areas but the slow speed would balance out the increased health pool. Adding more defense to his turret isn't gonna affect that standing still in siege is still not ideal.
---
And I don't know if you're new, but do the situations with 3 stars and watch the 3 tutorials videos
---
Im going to assume you dont understand what im saying. They made a decision to animate with the alibi standard cosmetics instead of an effect overlay.
---
It's just an action pose I set up because I think it looks cool.
---
This is up to you : 
---
1-Do you want to grind your way to buy operators ?
---
2-You don't want to grind too much and buy the basic operators instead ?
---
Nah, they're fine to me.
---
Damn, looks like it took at least 3 hours
---
We should just make chonk a suicide bomber
---
New ops for sure
---
Say sike right now
---
Heck yeah!
---
Your English is more broken then my ribs after seeing your retort.

I fully support this. Make his meme status legendary

Oh I'd be so mad!
---
Is she? That's some good news. Do you know if it'll replace the bullet proof camera or the barbed wire?
---
Thats why I said Thatcher OR a GIGN operator such as twitch or monty. Capitao and Lion are also pretty solid bans.
---
Pretty sure in the book VR is mentioned
---
Even if it isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs the bested possible explanation
---
This is so sad, guys, can we reach 1 downvote?
---
His pick rate is so high becauswehes the only operator who can block nades. No need to nerf him more than the acog. I dont know if you have played Pre-blood orchid/white noise r6 but every gun had RIDICULOUS recoil, jagers gun was almost as bad as bucks. There was also no need for any acog nerfs for jager, bandit,ash and sm11. It took actual skill to use/spanpeek with those guns but people are trssh and running out of spawn 5 seconds in the round and complaining about it rathwr than fkxing their mistakes. This applies woth quick leaning there is a key combinatiom to do it and its pretty difficult to do fast, and yet again siege community sucks at the game and are complainimg because people are better than them.
---
Dang dude, he got the signature and everything

Yeah the gadget is just way too good in any situation + his carbine. I really think they gotta do something with him at least

I got tk'd for throwing a gadget at someone who was reinforcing those walls.

The animation only happens when breaking a hatch or something lower than you. (This also applies to human skulls.) I love how thr debris flies everywhere
---
Console? PC? Laptop? Specs?
---
Rook
---
That's what I was thinking, it just feels better with the M762 than the vertical.
---
Same here, I went from gold 3 to silver 2 in one night cuz of solo queue, I consider it one of my accomplishments
---
Rook, doc, mute and bandit and thermite, thatcher and ash are always good choices.

Every ~~game~~ thing that involves a "defense" side is build mainly around camping. That's literally the point of defending something.

Thats Sledge after he has unlocked his first transformation. We call it Super Sledge.
---
üéµ HAVE YOU... HEARD OF THE BIG STRONG MAN, HE LIVES IN A CARAVAN.... üé∂

me when i get mad XD
---
Probably Sledge for attack, and Rook for defense, they aren't complicated and have pretty nice weapons
---
This isn‚Äôt even funny guys no one upvote this.
---
Yeah I'm NA, I'd say I'm pretty good, I usually get top kills/leaderboard when I play (through kills aren't every thing)
---
Im eu well frick
---
He mad
---
Nice, ty for the little tips, hope it will go better now :)
---
That isnt true at all, it should never be over your head whatsoever. I've used a sledgehammer for 10 hours a day the past year and a half on the railroad and anyone swinging like this is told to go home
---
Dang, well good luck getting a team
---
FLASHBANG OUT
---
Yea thx good luck to you as well
---
You should check out r/rainbow6teams (it's called that or something like it) you could try to make one there
---
Castle.
---
Can someone tell me why not? I genuinely want to know
---
Hmm.. Fair enough x) 
---
But to be honest, Ela isn't looking like a real elite operator anyway xD.
---
She doesn't even have mag pouches &gt;-&gt;.
---
There are 2 members tho
---
That's it, I'm gettin me mallet
---
Some people in this thread take cas way too seriously. Unless the other team is being toxic I usually just fuck around. But on House I'm either dead in the first 10 seconds or have a 2-3k, there's no other way to play house
---
Ita12l and  smokes is the only way to go on jackal. You are not the breacher at all you are the roam clear and well a shotgun helps and you can do verticle play better than with a BC. The only thing that's personal preference is between the PDW9 and the c7e
---
Np :) I hope you have fun with her &lt;3
---
Bro, good game sense is like almost non existent.
---
There's another bigger one, look up rainbow6 team and try to find it
---
It depends on what you‚Äôre swinging on, if you‚Äôre hitting railroad ties below you you don‚Äôt want to swing like this if you‚Äôre swinging at someone in front of you then yes swing like this
---
Been this way on that hatch for a long time, around a year
---
r/R6teams
---
N√•h i just Played the game its actually really easy
---
Honestly just adding an acog to the turret would make it so much better.
---
I kinda switch pdw and c7 depending on map like a map with long halls I take the PDW while with the c7 it's better for more close up maps
---
In addition to what others said, consider this.
---
The reason to reinforce anything is to stop attackers from entering. Well, in kids there are three windows to the outside, attackers almost never come from inside the house, that's too dangerous for them compared to just shooting through windows. So they come from the windows, and suddenly they're defending, and *they* don't have to worry about windows. If the walls are reinforced then tough luck, there's only a single doorway that you can shoot/enter through.
---

it looks like a bilateral amputee surgeon about to examine a prostate
---
I made a guy whine once because I killed him as Monty in casual. The guy was livid for some reason. My friends still joke about it often.
---
"Playing the game is kinda sweaty to me" yeah okay
---
*The only killed I needed to make
---
Win a 1v1 clutch round in a 4v4 ranked game with no other kills made.
---
Got dat Natalie Dormer smirk
---
Kars
---
A masterpiece
---
oh  you understand me, THANK YOU
---
Like everyone else said, it really comes down to which operators you pick, and what play-style you prefer most.
---
Some operators are meant to stay on the objective, and some are meant to walk around (anchoring and roaming).
---
Anchors: Rook, Doc, Kapkan, Tachanka, Echo, etc.
---
Roamers: Caveira, Pulse, Vigil, Bandit, J√§ger, etc.
---
However, some operators can do both, like Frost and Ela. It still comes down to choice.
---
Sorry that this was a lot, I‚Äôve been helping my friends understand the game since they‚Äôre new. Hopefully this helps!
---
Fus ro dah!!
---
Is it as accurate?
---
tbh exactly, one time I seen a frost mat in a room I didn't fully drone, it was put in a place I knew that there was someone near by, run into the room, cut a corner in the room and just knife frost, it was one of the funniest things to look back on.
---
You mean Rook?
---
Yeah him hahaha
---
Remember that it‚Äôs just a game, take a break and play something else for a while. Don‚Äôt worry about what anyone says also, that‚Äôs silly.
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Not really. It's probably a thick sheet steel enough to stop small calibers and shrapnel and than just padding. If it was solid enough to stop a large caliber round it probably would still knock the wearer the out, or break their neck with the weight.
---
Free weekends followed by huge sales. Easy and cheap throwaway accounts
---
Ok.
---
To me if you want to play the game to play the game play ranked, or unranked. But don't get mad at me for screwing around in cas. I don't drone and I rarely try in casual, because I don't care
---
This sounds like a quote of a rapist not gonna lie
---
That was my first thought as well
---
dunno, a couple every day minimum.
---
Find your perfect sensitivity.  That‚Äôs the first thing I think of. There‚Äôs alot of videos in YT, how to find yourself a good sens.
---
Don't buy jackel. He's always banned in ranked. Get Ela for an easy OP to learn in my opinion.
---
Well she wasn't expecting to get nerfed. You have to understand it takes time to adapt when you use to be able to kill 9 people with one magazine
---
That sounds like a good workaround, but i'd personally prefer hold for menu and tap to talk
---
Maybe that's do I guess idk. Guess I just play more than I thought.
---
I put 2 miras in construction, 1 facing kids and the other facing master bedroom/bathroom door and main stairs.
---
Should be -5. This game is not about punishing, so severely, such bad setup. That‚Äôs the attacking players‚Äô jobs. -5 points is enough to tell those not understanding that what they did is wrong without demeaning and lambasting them. Whereas no amount of negative points will garner attention from the trolls who do it on purpose.
---
*hostage has been killed*
---
My troll detector is going nuts!
---
Damn... we are all on Xbox sorry bro
---
I mean... Its called push to talk for a reason right?
---
But jokes aside, with that would you have to push it to start talking and then push it to stop?
---
I know, it's just that this try it's so poorly done...
---
because restaurant has less soft walls and doc bc you get downed  instead of killed and he‚Äôs 3 armor
---
By the Power of Graystone He has the Power!
---
Is that what the ar33 is called IRL?
---
I agree with don‚Äôt buy Jackel, but I recommend getting Zofia or Twitch.
---
Sick. Thanks
---
You're absolutely right but it does so much in such a small area it you might as well just not even have it
---
My favorite was when I asked the guy to plant, and he said, "its casual, who cares".
---
Me. I have more fun winning than losing.
---
That's only a fraction of how much he gives out everytime he shouts **WHY ARE YOU THERE!**
---
Whoops. I was confused by the wording of your comment. I agree with you. I though you meant, that you would have to hold menu and then press it again to stop talking.
---
Exactly, but this goes ways, don't cry about someone that does try in casual just because you don't care enough to try to begin with. (Not saying that you do, but some people are like that)
---
but I'm in gold
---
Oh I didnt read it properly ü§£ with my credit, I got many things including lesuon, capitao and clash. Was that a mistake?
---
Ohhh nah, it's all good. Yeah I mean like how you have it on pc, you let go and it turns off yep
---
ela is one of the harder ones and not that useful.
---
\*angry swedish noises\*
---
get all base game operators before you buy dlc ones.
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
Ha ha, you are so funny. 
---
No.
---
It sounds like a good idea in speculation. But i can imagine if this was to make it into the game, it would be badly executed.
---
Yea, you physically can‚Äôt get over 1000 renown from a casual with a booster xDDD. And that‚Äôs not including completed challenges.
---
Yeah probably
---
Somebody more talented add ‚Äúfus ro da‚Äù (Skyrim scream) to this please
---
That looks like  normal crouch for you? He's crouching on the lower ledge but the legs decided to go on the top shelf, making them go inside the body.  That's all, just looked funny to me.
---
Anyone that uses shotgun secondary over pistol has low brain cell count
---
It has no counter. How's it not broken. And no, you don't because 90% you already got shot trying to peek him.
---
Thank you comrade! Much love!
---
As I said elsewhere, it just makes taking back the room from attackers impossible.
---
Ohhhh never mind. I though they were different images. My bad.
---
Why not, I mean his gadget isnt very skill based and his weapons are very strong. You learn fast how to play him + He is fun to play. Only if you want to play Hard rank with you can forget it, cause He is the most banned OP on attack
---
Same. I've never played ranked because R6 is just way too toxic to get into that kind of thing in the first place.  
---
At least with casual I can pop right out when my team decides to be a bunch of shitters and take turns tk'ing me and I don't have to care about "mmr" or rank or any of that.
---
\*bass boosted pillarmen theme plays in the distance\*
---
So great, now we only need people to pronounce his name right
---
Gold is the highest achieving rank in the community. There are so many people who should not be in there, just because it is the easiest rank to get. This means there are so many bronzes, silvers and even coppers who do not belong at all in there.

Could we please not upvote displays of unfair plays like this one?
---
Before someone comments that this could be a private match or something, OP commented on the same post a few hours ago that they were toxic throughout the entire match before it was deleted.
---
Oooh you meant the map was only in casual. I get it now lol
---
Thing*
---
I dunno, I dont spawnpeek, but its literally part of the game, and one that is easily avoidable. Every map has a pretty decent length of cover and multiple ways to exit said cover, and droning is a pretty effective counter as well, along with glaz. 
---
There just hits a point where you have to accept that its a valid part of the game, and one that is encouraged or allowed by the devs. Its like getting mad about run outs. Like, its part of the game, and its not even that bad of a part. 
---
As far as new players goes, there is a newcomers playlist for them.
---
Ar33 cause Sledge dont have it
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but i‚Äôm not playing Siege if there‚Äôs ever gonna be an operator called ‚Äúflycatcher‚Äù lmfaooooooo
---
Out of spite? Psh nah gotta get your friends and all pick him for fun.
---
I've heard "it's just casual" dozens upon dozens of times, and 99% of the time, it's used by people who are playing selfishly and not letting anyone else enjoy the match. Oh, you want to actually win, in a video game about winning? Tryhard. 
---
Unless you communicate and agree with your entire team on a joke or weird strat, you should ALWAYS be earnestly trying to win. Not necessarily trying to your best, most optimal ability, but your goal HAS TO BE TO WIN.
---
if you play without even trying to win, you're being a complete shithead to EVERYONE else in the match.
---
And it‚Äôs really annoying when they say ‚Äúmy first black ice‚Äù because they weren‚Äôt even here when they released alpha packs and everyone got a guaranteed black ice.
---
Sledge:

#ALLAHU AKBAR
---
5 montanges and 1 clash
---
I feel like that's a difficult one, because in an ideal world the mirror will never be open, so you'd have to find a way to detect that people are using it to wallbang; which sounds problematic, though I'm no expert.
---
agreed, especially on console it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
I was going to ask why he is crosseyed until I zoomed in.
---
Good job op, someone who can actually make some good shit  here for once.
---
Mozzie. You take away enemy drones and gain one for your team. That is massive. Though, I think I would probably play Mute over Mozzie if no one has selected either of those ops. But both together are great as well.
---
Use the compensator
---
Then I get team killed and they say "iTs jUsT cASuAl"
---
Legit had a guy do this on every one of my soft walls yesterday. He basically nullified me the entire match. Especially considering he‚Äôd put the reinforcement on the opposite side of mine so I couldn‚Äôt put another mirror down. Then he threw a fit when I team killed him and he called ME trash.
---
yes
---
nope
---
I would like a way to stop him from making a hole in the first place. Right now, to counter him he is always making a hole. Even a small one.
---
Hello VoidedGamer_,
---
U lucky

lol, favela. 
---
Mute them bruh, it aint hard.
---
tell me exactly why tf did you leave first 20 s?
---
Someone got paid $5 to teamkill me.
---

---
It is less silent, but the indications of a suppressed weapon are the real use of a suppressor
---
It isn‚Äôt at all
---
There isn't a best fov option lol. Just tinker around, I like the look of 90, tho I play better on 78.
---
Theme changes
---
*BEWARE BEWARE THE DRAGONBORN COMES*
---
Yeah you're right but this way you controll where the head goes
---
I usually shotgun a hole at the top of the wall for c4 throws. It is usually enough of a signal to my team that I want it to stay soft.
---
Ah, I see. Thanks 
---
One of the guys I play with uses Mira but I don't think he does this. I'll have to suggest it sometime
---
You can literally google "Ember Rise Release Date" lol.
---
I don't get to play with many smart people :(
---
I'm mega casual and don't play ranked though, so its *really* my own fault.
---
Yeah I got black ice for Buck pistol the one right before this one and later on UMP 45
---
Yep it's a tiny map so it is a lot easier to hold it down from other rooms in the top floor.
---
r/redditchangesthesong
---
Okay so wtf are they
---
It's better than them being in alpha packs, I guess. I'd rather have them do this with the future events. 
---
Even though these had no event tied to them...
---
He got a mushroom on he head
---
All of them.
---
Ahhh ok, thanks
---
Seems pretty pissed at that hatch
---
Just look at the positives. You‚Äôre plat 3 in next seasons elo. Which means you know you can‚Äôt get it. Good luck securing it this season though!
---
R/whoooooosh
---
You *know* these were originally meant to be in packs
---
Its just the worst, isn't it?
---
Tachanka rework now. Give him horses and a cart
---
lol... well my friend don't know and we got only 30 seconds tho :P
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you were someone who abused this back then and only came back now, or you are randomly spamming that in the chats.
---
I love both a lot but I think maverick is a better over all op.
---
She really didn't
---
she has an acog, learn how to use the other gun.
---
See this is why full auto is not as reliable as people think, semi auto and with the right aim does the job quicker.
---
that was the fakest laugh
---
Yea it was removed due to an exploit. Will probably return with the start of the new season.
---
Here is the post about it from August 17th https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/creqfv/pc_hot_breaching_temporarily_disabled/
---
Incoming ‚ÄúnO wItCh HuNtInG‚Äù comments, but Ye those guys are scums
---
One of them was DDOS‚Äôing. Spikes you entire teams pings up to the 1000‚Äôs and makes the game basically unplayable. They usually do this on defense, so you can‚Äôt attack site. Battleye picked up on this and banned their whole stack for queuing with a cheater.
---
There‚Äôs an invisibility bug rn so they removed hot breaching temporarily
---
That was a f\*\*king jumpscare
---
I think he should just have the cart and other operators should be able to come grab it and wheel him around. They do say they emphasis teamwork.
---
I think the L85 is probably better but I love the AR33 and only use that
---
He should definitely try it; a lot of people don't expect it at lower ranks/in casual, they're super comfortable standing around in front of mirrora; literally free kills.
---
And in some circumstances you can shut down whole pushes by having a reinforced mira next to a soft wall, just because of the threat it offers.

Not at all. Work on that aim tho lol.
---
*Tower intensifies*
---
My potato aim never seems to leave me. Most of my kills are luck based now a days, don‚Äôt know if I should be proud or worried.
---
I read this as "Capit√£o is shit in ranked" I was like whaaaat
---
Yeah, that was My thought. Already the way it is, shotguns drop off just decreases when you ADS(not really but the pellets stay closer together I think, resulting in more dmg over Range). I can't get that in my brain and forget to ADS all the time, because in my head, it just doesn't make sense that ANYTHING changes when ADS. It changes nothing about the gun. 
---
Recoil control, yeah okay, but physically changing the spread of the a gun just because of ADS just makes no sense. It screwed me over countless times. Now if they introduce this, the difference is even bigger? NO THANK YOU I'LL PASS.

Correct an H&amp;K replaced the famas, I knew I felt funny about that for a reason. I was thinking it looked nothing like any other H&amp;K. I appreciate the correction.
---
How
---
They did just remake the shields and how they work though
---
Yeah and they have no idea how the game was like at the start. I guess I know how old people feel lol.
---
No one cares stop playing
---
Because boobies
---
cool
---
No kidding Sherlock, maybe don't take leaks with a grain of salt next time instead of being gullible
---
There are communities on ps4 for finding people and its no surprise that silver player's aren't the best

Start doing back exercises. You'll need to carry randoms.

Check the road map for nokks vigils in game profile

Except that all the evil the soviets did was based on race hatred.
---
The JMBs hated

Buck has a good gadjet for ranked as does alibi, yings is a little situational, and needs communication but is still good
---
Opposition Forces
---
Worse they make you and altar boy and reinforce your bedroom from the outside so you can‚Äôt get out and they throw a priest in with you

Pulse

bottom right corner, it says AISoFINK I believe

It doesn't mean they were on your team. It just means you won the game. The cheater was either on your team and you won, or on the other team and they lost. Either way you still lose the elo. In my case I almost always queue in a 5 stack so it most certainly means we are beating cheaters who then get banned. I hadn't had a single elo gain from cheaters getting banned all season until today. I had lost over 350 elo prior to today from cheaters getting banned.

Oh my... jeez sledge what kind of juice is he using. Need some of that. He hit that with some anger.
---
I just need to get gold rank for 100%
---
And I'm only bronze 3
---
I'm a noob
---
Annoying, but necessary to actually have fun in this game when you don't want to sweat. If they had a death match mode where people could just mess about and practise aim or casual with ranked settings(which I think they are actually adding in Ember Rise) it'd be fine. 
---
I personally don't want to find any joy in "relaxing" in Plat 1/Diamond Elo games. And no I am not playing casual. 
---
This game is extremely limited in what you can actually do. Custom games suck, t hunt sucks, casual sucks, ranked sucks unless you are sweating.
---
You'll get there!
---
That part of the map is so bugged. Even you can just teleport from there to inside of map
---
Characters don‚Äôt move while you are ADSed
---
Throw a team member in order to protect his deployable shield
---
Looks great, I love it!
---
Rook will pretty much always be useful but someone people find anchoring boring. I thoroughly enjoy him though and his gadget benefits everyone (as long as you remember to put it out)
---
Imagine not
---
While ADSed you don‚Äôt move
---
Alibi‚Äôs bandana does cover her face
---
Thanks mate I was just confused
---
Maybe reinstall?
---
truth
---
Mmmm....no.
---
so absolutely no counters? seems fair
---
Eating those alpha snaccs, I see what they did there
---
It does take place after siege, so technically yes
---
Your trial ubisoft account is linked to steam. Launch it through Uplay and you can log in to the other account.
---
When you say 'very likely' do you mean you're still questioning it? If so I hope you find your true self-identity soon! Awesome cosplay by the way :)
---
I just don‚Äôt see the point. Sure there are ops I‚Äôm better at then others but I just use whatever the team needs or whatever I‚Äôm feeling at that moment in time
---
Dont apologize dude, they reinforced kids room.
---
Plus, your name is JohnRambo90.... john Rambo doesnt apologize for shit
---
Pretty sure it is because you are running it through steam and do not have it purchased on there. If you run it through ubisoft game launcher then it would work I think. Or you know you could just buy the game.
---
Im makin fucking mac and cheese

You assume you can only 360 no scope with glaz
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Dam bro can you frame that and send it to me.
---
not expected/unexpected Thanos ? damn
---
Literary no one outside of this sub thinks outbreak was a failure.
---
Outbreak still has some of the highest player counts for this game and that only counting pc numbers. The event was good enough to green light the premium pack system and quarantine as a standalone game.
---
Quarantine is made by a different dev team so your comment about improving TH makes no sense.
---
i‚Äôm big confused?
---
Wow you stopped some drones at a mute jammer, low effort post OP
---
Stronger than Kars.
---
I had this happen to me on clubhouse it happened a while ago
---
Good at wearing a beret and saluting
---
I deleted it then went on the uplay app to reinstall. It just sent me back to steam telling me i have to for it even though i am using my friends Ubisoft account(he owns the game)
---
I wasn't trying to lol. I had just smoked so I'm a little nutty
---
No, he took one half of the off brand
---
Not true. Every R6 veteran buys a new account.
---
bout 80 most of the time, 100 in intense parts
---
You may change bloom also. You may adjust it until you see things clearer.
---
Awhile ago, this happened on Kafe, I was defending, a teammate tked me, I had asked, and was fine on the following round.
---
I knew you would say that buddy. It's why I worded my comment the way I did. How does it feel to know that you've been out maneuvered, to be a puppet on a string? I have you now, and always will.
---
Spetsnaz operators are the best memes lol
---
Mmmmmm tasty
---
p much
---
So much of new ends up being people bitching about a toxic enemy team or teammate and whining about their mmr being wrong and hitreg and so much other garbage.
---
Honestly, I don't *mind* console clips, as long as it's not a shitty clip. But 99% of them (even the PC ones) end up being "Hey I'm playing fuze and fucked up my aim and ACED AND KILLED THE HOSTAGE AND A TEAMMATE HAHA
---
It's just disheartening. I wish there was like /r/SiegePC or something. /r/SiegeAcademy is decent but all the questions are stuff new players just dont wanna google like "what mmr is gold" and "what sight do you use"
---
Are you using his steam or yours? Maybe if you logged into the account associated with the uplay
---
Lol maybe there all vodka
