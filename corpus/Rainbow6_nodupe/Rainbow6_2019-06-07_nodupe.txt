That's what my teacher said in primary school 
---
i never did and that isn't about to change
---
Still no rpg 7
---
Me and the boys getting piss drunk on a tuesday evening tryna walk up the stairs to the apartment
---
Good design, some of these are questionable tho. How is ying more of an antiroamer than jackal and gridlock?
---
You need 3
---
Thanks. This just makes me wanna find it more now.
---
I too have some ideas that I've posted before, which maybe you could include in a year 6 concept
---
Maybe also include a stat for how good they are at pushing site and planting for attackers, or redefine support to include this.   
---
Same goes for plant denial on defense.   
---
I think these two stats would help new players think in terms of winning as a team, instead of saving the AWP.
---
They already talked about releasing the old client as a "game mode" some time
---
HOLY HECKIN FRICK! IS THIS A JOJO'S REFERENCE?????
---
I would love a pp bizon
---
THANK YOU
---
It's not in beta as of June 11th (the pro league update)
---
Got one for fuzes lmg yesterday. Sucks cuz i never play fuze but i was pretty hyped
---
Luckily it doesn‚Äôt matter is banned I main all üòà
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna try again now
---
Irl shield bearers usually catty 2 pistols, but they don't throw one instead they holster the first and take out the second
---
Silent dawn sounds like a great idea, I really like the idea of placing something like microphones all around the map.
---
Your sens is digusting, poor kid couldnt even move a muscle
---
Rook mine
---
Pretty sure Ar33 is a version of the G3 or is the G3 but probably will change stuff. Also pretty sure irrc cap's AR is a Fal.
---
For balancing reasons. Eg, the UMP. Terrible gun, but it has to be, or pulse would be op. Unfortunately, Castle is also affected by that.
---
"Some people" should uninstall.
---
*cries in bandit main*
---
This is why certain people get Tk'd.
---
Wait really? üò± When was this?!?!
---
I WANT DEAD UWU UWU X3
---
Idr like the pistol guy, although I have a great idea for a replacement.
---
I just got here today, lol
---
Do you know the file? And we need to delete it every time we update the game right?
---
You could still play them in casual at least. But this is really a subjective issue. A lot of people will prefer it to be more competitive than having more game modes cuz just focusing on improving their gameplay and getting better at the game is enough, and others want more modes even if they aren‚Äôt as balanced. Both are valid ways of thinking. Idk I feel like the game already has so much variety in how a match can play out that leaving the other modes to casual and having the most balanced parts in competitive makes sense. Counter strike only has one game mode yet it‚Äôs one of the most popular games of all time. It‚Äôs more about variety in how a match can play out and focusing on improving your gameplay for a lot of people who actually play competitive.
---
Why are sledge and buck so different on your stupid chart? And why on earth is sledge so low on the entry fragging scale?

Cease your furry actions.

I like the hexagon one

Pay the court a fine
---
so arrogant
---
Plane can be turned into a one floor map with 5 reinforcements and 2 roamers. Attackers can be trapped in spawn with very little effort on the defenders part. 
---
Every plant in house can be held from outside the building with only one vault prompt.
---
I remember playing ranked on both of these maps and I, along with a majority of the player base, do not wish to return there. They are fun maps, not competitive maps. They should remain in casual.
---
Idc what anyone says, this flat out dope! Good job bro!!! Keep it up!!
---
CSGO has 3 ranked game modes and you can choose maps to play on. Besides that there's plenty unranked modes and shot tone of unofficial modes. This isn't really an argument
---
Virginian as well! Anyone in Fredericksburg?
---

---
Noice
---
Reinforcements also do sort sort of damage to drones near the bottom. I wonder if you can kill with them as well.
---
No help is needed
---
Spend a good bit playing T hunt to get the feel of the weapons and learn the maps a bit.
---
Watch pro league matches or people like pengu, gather what you can from footage like that. 
---
Also don‚Äôt let anyone whose being toxic get to you, just mute and report them and go about your day.
---
Good god...why?!
---
Make sure to learn where the cameras are on each map, it can be the difference between winning and loosing a round, and remember on attack, that you have an extra drone to use in the middle of the round if you're unsure about pushing!

It's a pretty simple change. Bomb just requires covering a bit more space and planting a bomb. That's it.
---
This is awesome. I really like all of the operators. Great job
---
It is kinda disappointing the vast majority of people down at copper 4 are really just mid-gold to plats who wanted to ‚Äúsmurf‚Äù, except there‚Äôs lot of other good players with the occasional ‚Äòreal‚Äô copper player... it‚Äôs amazing wouldn‚Äôt trade it.
---
This isn't actually true. They're strictly detecting whether or not they're using an adapter, and the manufacturers keep circumventing this.  
---
It's blatantly obvious who is uses M+KB on console visually, if Ubisoft has access to movement datasets they could throw something together to formulate MKB usage based on raw input.  
---
I'm not saying it's easy, but to say it can't be done is unimaginative and misinformed.
---
So muzzle break on PC and compensator on console?

I may or may not be slightly aroused after seeing this
---
definately not the only one that is bout that bizon
---
Nice and simple, good job. Seems like a lot of work but it would be cool ur u made this into a survey or connected it to r6 tracker and u would get an average result on your play style in this chart form
---
oh yes. ela on ps4 was a bitchhhh
---
now? one of my favorite defenders on PC
---
If ranked stresses you out play casual..
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
When I was playing I heard the taser hitting metal sound and I don‚Äôt know how to put that in slow motion other than on the quarter speed scrubbing on a phone
---
Oh it‚Äôs so sexy when they just run into headshots
---
Did you not know how to spell embarrassing so you copy paste it? Lol
---
If youre level 300 you'll be better than a large majority of PC players. Don't get me wrong, the top level PC players are better than the ones you'll find on console. but PC has its fair share of more casual, or just worse players. Just go in and enjoy the game. I see tons of silvers and golds with no sense of aim or awareness.
---
Why do you not have our Lord Tachanka? He is the best op
---
What's weird is, I've not had that many toxic experiences in siege on EUW...
---
I dunno, it's got to be down to the time I play siege at during the day
---
r/R6OperatorCreator
---
I agree, people just treat it bad because they have SMGs
---
yeah, what next? a MP5 with a drum mag, scoped MP5 with a long barrel and a stockless short MP5
---
You‚Äôre really underestimating how important thatcher is on some sites. It makes attacking straight up impossible if there‚Äôs no vertical play and you have no thatcher. There‚Äôs just too many counters to hard breachers now and too many trap/intel ops that will slow down any sort of old school push. In the past you could ‚Äúget creative‚Äù and do crazy things because there wasn‚Äôt an extra ten defenders designed to eliminate pushes and block off hall ways. The number of denial gadgets and plant denials has more than doubled since year one yet there‚Äôs still only one real counter to them. 
---
Twitch isn‚Äôt a real counter, a well placed mute behind a shield renders her ineffective, or her drone can be easily spotted/destroyed. Without a thatcher you also can‚Äôt destroy jagers so you‚Äôll expend most of your smokes and grenades just trying to get rid of them if they‚Äôre well placed. So that leaves you limited utility in narrow hallways that give defenders all the advantages. If both teams are of equal skill this kind of advantage is a death sentence in a close game
---
Will it give me a rank (mmr/badge/etc) if I play or is it a dressed up casual playlist?
---
I've been playing for a month now, I saw the playlist update last night. I have never played ranked. 
---
My friends and I are keen to try but don't want to play ranked early because we're not that adept to the game yet
---
*BANS ASH*
---
That's where you're wrong, bud.
---
Or don't use echo on a 1v1.
---
I mean. steam play isn't the actual name
---
High Quality x100
---
Is it just me or is Arc a bit too strong? A trap which makes you extremely vulnerable and loud for a moment, can potentially kill you or make you useless if you have the wrong weapon in your hand and on top of that, it recharges so can be triggered again. His weapons look really cool tho.
---
Use g36 then if you want an acog
---
Thank God!
---
Why would you say that recruit is the best op
---
Why would you hit it twice?
---
is there way to get that wallpaper in back i kinda like it!
---
yes me too
---
I would so buy these. Love the fonts, too
---
Lol
---
Puerto Rico :\
---
No. For a good while ps plus was not needed to play online. I was always able to play without it until today.
---
It's the TK aspect and the fact that there's fuck all you can do when outnumbered
---
Really why bomb only I wonder
---
What about the president?  He‚Äôs done the same thing so I guess it‚Äôs ok.
---
its not funny im considering overdosing on asprins because of this shit
---
remember to take breaks, or you'll break something
---
You pay for your crimes

I'm in a party with my friends and thy got in

same thing happening to me
---
I see uou play a lot of cs go , brother
---
Did you miss the patch notes that they're bringing guns to a sword fight?
---
Same here, This is dumb
---
I'll keep that in mind. She just seemed pretty cool. Is Finka worth it? I was interested initially but then I learned her 'Heal' isn't really a heal. My next Defender is gunna be Lesion most likely(just got Mira, and it's been advised I should rotate between ATK/DEF each time.) I'm also pretty tempted to save up for Nokk instead but she seems to not be all that beginner friendly, but I like the sneaky playstyle. 
---
I have all base operators along with
---
Hibana
---
Mira
---
Any suggestions for whose next? Thanks!
---
Shame, ive had some really good plays with fuze and the pmm, but becoming more and more nervous when engaging with a damn shield is not worth it
---
Guess i'll keep reporting until they fix it
---
Ok, good to know!
---
I'm having the same issue
---
Congrats! It was ubis way of celebrating your cake day
---
It's probably because in the code, player deaths are recorded and displayed while gadget deaths are hidden from the feed. So by this theory, there might be a debugging mode where gadget deaths are displayed. So maybe the gadget icon is from leftover assets and code that can be activated by killing a player.
---
I agree to an ID, cheating in sports is bannable. Or fineable. But that vould also establish a really easy way for us smart asses to get around if us hackers can hack past a firewall deaigned to blick us then whats stoping me from maling a fake id. Thata my opoion good idea. But realistically would put people off
---
Sadly...

He fades with every hostage kill
---
Hello fellow, Virginia Beach here!
---
I hate getting TKd but even I would laugh at that.
---
I see the game here. Act like no one gives rewards so that someone will prove you wrong and give you a reward. Reverse reverse psychology!
---
I dont like that ranked is only bomb now, I only play hostage and secure area and it feels like ubi is forcing us to play ranked like its pro league. I'm okay with pick and ban or whatever else they added but I dont like the game mode change.
---
I‚Äôve had it too
---
You could always practice on terrorist hunts! Practice aiming/ looking at head hight because headshot = DEAD, it's important to learn to recognize when you actually see a person, and slowly working up the difficulty in t hunt, it's really just a time and patience thing, so just keep practicing and your reaction time and aim will just gradually get better as u play
---
Go online
---
Yeah I'm having the same problem
---
Love the pick and ban, everything else should have been left alone.
---
Yeah, same here and for my firends. I thing only xbox is affected
---
Wishlist and patience are key.  I don't remember the last time I've gotten a game full price besides pre orders I was excited for.  My downfall is never passing on a good deal though,  so now I have probably hundreds of games I haven't beaten/ played.
---
It's doing the same thing for me on xbox
---
I made a post on this subreddit earlier about it. And it would be an easy fix, just make it so that there is VOIP settings in options in game. Where you can choose your speakers and microphone
---
Holy shit the color matches. Awesome trucks!
---
Is that a motherfucking Jojo reference?
---
Yep same
---
I had it, but I‚Äôm back up now.
---
Yeah I know I‚Äôm just saying the general rule. Depends on whether you prefer to control recoil or burst really.

thanks man, as a rook main, the only vehicles i can get now are big and blue

Same issue here. Kicked me out of my ranked match. If I lose points I'm snapping my disk

Hi snapping my disk, I'm dad.

Yah it happened to me on Xbox but I finally got it by hitting y then invite players so and it finally worked
---
How the hell did you get 7 digits and a space
---
Guess the servers are down. I‚Äôve been taking a break but I guess everyone on Xbox is getting that
---
Bruh. The people who know a lot about this system are like the top 1% of the Siege player base.
---
Please the new recoil nerf is more useless than the first ela recoil nerf. the F2 is for all intended purposes the same gun.
---
yeah I think so too

Dead center in pick+ban rate for Pro League - 11th out of 21, which is higher than Ash, Twitch, and Glaz. He's an operator greatly enhanced by good communication, just like how rushes with Ash and Twitch are greatly restricted by defender teamwork. Most balanced attacker in the game if we're going by that metric.
---
Thatcher had 88%, Cap had 82%, Mira had 99.5%, Jaeger had 89%. If you want to complain about BS OP operators, maybe talk about them. Or if you want to talk about brainless operators, Dokkaebi, with only a 4.4% pick+ban in PL, because her gadget is much easier but less effective than Jackal's.
---
Unlike most tier lists posted, I don‚Äôt have any huge issues with this

Imagine playing casual

Good luck to you.

Yeah, only trouble with siege servers were my own

Shes banned that much?
---
804 Squad up in here

What helmet is that and where did you get it trying to get ahold of one for an Airsoft loadout.
---
delete this shit and send it to ubi
---
Mira, bandit, and hard breachers aren‚Äôt a must pick for ever round
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just a game. Just start another match and move on, And that‚Äôs not that toxic.
---
bot team mates tho.
---
Banned or picked. There was ONE round in the entirety of PL Finals where she wasn't picked despite not being banned.
---
1. Sights don‚Äôt give range
---
2. It still does the same damage as always
---
WHERE ARE THE THREE SPEEDS
---
Mr Stark, I don't feel too good.
---
I‚Äôm very confused because of this grammar.
---
It's not useful to ban ops for your team in any way. If you don't want an op then just don't use them. 
---
i.e banning Bandit does not help my team in any way at all when we are defending. Banning Bandit would only help my team if the enemy is the one using the operator.
---
Why does my teams ban pick have to affect us too? There is no reason for it.
---
Wdym people die from 3-4 bullets
---
The kill cams are bugged this season due to the camera view point change done on the last update to fix lean spam. 
---
He saw your model in his game and shot you, the kill cam will have a small difference on where your model is. he is not hacking or anything like that.
---
What spawn point is he at?
---
But that‚Äôs not really answering why lol?
---
As soon as I got into the game my game glitched but I‚Äôll do this when I close my app and restart. Also is the newcomer match making glitched or something?
---
**One word:** *Huh?*
---
Garden spawn.
---
If you use 5.7 instead of deagle on n√∏kk imma break your kneecaps
---
Much thanks, now to show my other low silver players I know strats...
---
Coz recruit memes are lame
---
F
---
Probably
---
What if as an attacker he threw down mini automated turrets
---
You won‚Äôt get banned and it‚Äôs no called a smurf.
---
instead of the usual spawn peek circle jerk
---
No i mean the invite
---
No
---
I've played the division and well...yeah of course there diffrent game typed
---
They would need to give him a special version that lacks an ACOG since they obviously don't want him with an ACOG.
---
Yeah I noticed I got damage when placing it real low. Didn‚Äôt think of it killing someone, but that is possible of course.
---
Why not? I want to see this from the other perspective
---
Are you sure you just didn‚Äôt steal this shit from Ubisoft? That looks professional and awesome af!
---
Words?
---
Nah she's fine

---
You've summoned me

Look at r/meatbabys ...its worth it

They‚Äôre aware that it isn‚Äôt reversed and said that they‚Äôre gonna work on all explosives
---
xD
---
I feel like any time anyone on this sub gets a minor sound glitch or other bs ttb they immediately go to the " Ubi WhY U No FIx GaMe Plss HeLp" its annoying
---
The problem is 
---
* The semi auto gun, he will go back to his older days where you no longer has the fire rate of a automatic compared to other operators and has not special ability . So you have a operator with a slightly high dmg DMR. Which can be replaced by an operator like Blackbeard for fragging or dokki for utility and similar playstyle but with a smg has a CQC backup which glaz doesn't have.
---
* The nerf of glaz's banana vision is due to the power of the ability not the gun. Even with a slower firerate gun he can dominate long hallways, bomb plants, angles that the defenders can fight back. 
---
So with this change now you have 2 versions of glaz thats has the same issues that was there with him with OG glaz and Banana Glaz
---
Uninstall
---
Who wouldnt?üëÖ
---
Same dude! It's the first elite I bought!
---
What server you on?
---
Can you explain a bit more about what you mean by your game glitched?
---
Ah your matchmaking on the newcomer playlist, yeah that tend to have less players so it'll take a bit longer to find a match.
---
North America
---
Bad time to test it with the free weekend happening.
---
I really dont like this,but i guess other people will enyoy it if you are into that kind of stuff so i cant complain,you do you.
---
i agree with this. Boston was a big part of the community and Isaiah was only a friend of our small group. it wouldn't be fair to everyone else that has had a similar experience. i love seeing the nice comments and support but i think this is just pushing it in my eyes.
---
Where are you from? What datacenter is it connecting you to? What platform are you on?
---
Played it this morning and got pitted against a toasty five stack, definitely a clan and probably plat, didn‚Äôt check. 
---
It went as you‚Äôd expect
---
How do we even deploy black mirror so low? Any help for pc?
---
Just add ranked and ranked pro so I can actually play my new ops I paid ¬£26 for
---
I also have made the exact same transition to and it's so much less toxic than Xbox. Still a few imbeciles but the game feels so much more different on pc
---
Just in case anyone else has this issue and sees this. All PC versions steam and whatnot end up loading through the uPlay launcher regardless of where you purchased it. Steam will open uPlay etc, so you can just add to the uPlay friends list and play.
---
Me too, how will I M870 rush on attack without recruit.
---
wish ubisoft would give a playing field for everyone
---
They're trying to emulate pro league. Pro league is first to 7 with switch at 6 rounds (first to 7 would be way too long for regular ranked). I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, but that's they're reasoning.
---
Looks great, so sorry for your loss
---
I'm Aussie but with New Zealand family so half right
---
Ooh lmao, all my friends use Xbox and I‚Äôm stuck with PlayStation :‚Äù)))
---
Oh heck I typed the wrong thing, rip
---
So sorry to hear your friend passed away. Hope he's using the sensor in heaven.
---
Thank you. This is a much clearer explanation.
---
I can literally hear the team saying "it's right over there!"
---
Skins are fcking AMAZING !
---
They should just let it be an option to select on Ranked as opposed to being the sole option.
---
Making everyone play what the pros play sort of limits the game imo.  Like, my friends aren't very good at bomb and I can see this killing their interest to continue playing.

It's embedded in it and built in. These are very small tubes filled with Tritium, a radioactive gas , the green light doesnt have anything to do with it being radioactive tho, it's simply the color of the glass, it could be red or purple as well but light green is one of the easiest color to see as it's very rare in nature!
---
Ahhh, so like Bandit and not smoke, coolamoondo.
---
And bummer about the Season pass
---
I‚Äôll admit it happens to me sometimes, but at the worst possible times. Like when we‚Äôve breached, the coast is clear, and right as I‚Äôm clicking to sprint Buck spots Pulse across the way and *boom* takes my head off. 
---
Every time.
---
There's absolutely nothing in Virginia other than getting a speeding ticket for three over
---
I'm willing to try it man. I need players too lol
---
[removed]
---
That would make them less money, not more, then you add in development time.
---
The worse is tryhards are all over the mode . Smurfs , toxic clans , toxic 5-4 stacks . And they tell us to go play casual where tryhards are even there . Time for a real casual mode
---
Ebay most likely. I've seen charms for about ¬£1.5
---
I was given a code from a streamer from season 1, I don't even really use the skin on anything.
---
Yeah
---
Yeah I notice cav gets insta banned and for the tk/ vote kick I‚Äôve started solo queuing less and less in even casual because of it
---
rest up man he seems like a great person sorry for your loss
---
Yeah fr it‚Äôs almost as if I enjoy other game modes. Inb4 bOmB iS mOrE cOmPeTiTiVe or JuSt PlAy CaSuAl.
---
Sorry for your loss brotha, some of the best always die young, I lost my brother when he was only 17 and one thing that always helped me was when a friend told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre living for more than just yourself now, everything you do in life is for him and the shit he won‚Äôt be able to‚Äù Good luck out there man and congrats on graduating!
---
√∏7
---
Oh ok, thank you !
---
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. And thank you for the kind words. I actually graduate tomorrow and my 18th birthday is the day after :)))
---
rude but okay. I moved from Europe to where i am Now. thankyou. Not smart to suggest we become world star when we dont have pings to be our fullest potential!~! honestly triedandtrusted your just some rude ass. i enjoy siege alot, therefore i have the right to say as loud as i want that i want 9 ping, besides. when you get killed by good players with 200 ping you and alot of others moan, ping abuser.! suck it up and sign the petition to help me or mind your own business. thank you anyone else who is supportive of this subject.
---
You should be able to shoot once an operator dies Inside
---
Why tachanca...
---
It‚Äôs almost as if people can have a preference for what they enjoy
---
I've seen a few of these on the first page of this subreddit today and I'm wondering..
---
Is this normal on consoles
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it brotha, it was a long time ago and I‚Äôm at peace. Enjoy these years, some of the best ever!!!!
---
Why is Oregon out? What is wrong with this map?
---
This is true
---
Does it ever show the barbed wire?
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Reddit check list,
---
Step 1, get Reddit
---
Step 2, find mp7 in other game and add acog
---
Step 3, lul out on r/rainbow6
---
Have never seen this before.
---
now thats a doujinshi i would read
---
Its been known killcam is broken. Git gud.
---
But why male models?
---
Testies
---
And the acog being a thing too
---
Hmm
---
Awful changes. Gonna miss secure and hostage. Casual is not at all fun to me. And this new csgo style side switching is gonna kill the game. This update is just as bad as when they removed maps from ranked because they ‚Äúaren‚Äôt competitive‚Äù. Ubisoft seems to be going backwards they just keep removing more and more stuff. Wish I could go back like 2 years and play this game again. Welp bring on the downvotes.
---
great idea 
---
actually why dont we just make it so that defenders cant use primary weapons at all? pistols only, flintlocks, actually, so they can have 1 shot before they have to reload for a minute
---
You're friend has been banned for toxic behavior
---
It sounded sarcastic, what i meant was you should be able to shoot outside once an attacker operator dies inside by a defense operator instead of disabling the whole shoot outside thing 
---
Sorry btw lol
---
Maybe a restriction to not let you play ranked unless you have 5 attackers and 5 defenders?
---
Similar systems are pretty common in MOBA games
---
Thanks! I appreciate that you enjoyed my post.
---
It takes skill and years of training to think these tweets up.
---
^I make it up as I go along.

Leave queue and queue back up after 2 minutes.

Hello Irdiii, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bxsja6/gravity/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
###Caps lock title
---
The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.
---
Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
This is my worry with that concept, but it might work out balanced still. It‚Äôs used as the format in pro league but not sure if that transfers to an average run of the mill ranked match involving us peasants? Time will tell!
---
I know that added to that it's on bb and call and if it's seasonal, that means it goes from the operation, down (to older ops)
---
This has been going on for the past 2 days whenever I cue for any multiplayer game type. I‚Äôm up to 18 mins now.
---
The fact that there's an icon for it is beautiful
---
This ain't it chief
---
If it feels so wrong just buy a new account. You neglected the game for over 2 years and let someone play on it.
---
Must be the result of our constant:
---
&gt; Busty Latina gets hammered from behind, while on another man
---
&gt; Tied up and gagged girl electrocuted by a French petite
---
&gt; A big fucking hole get banged against the wall
---
&gt; Game developer spreads redhead‚Äôs legs in an unusual way
---
...stuff. He just mixed up the subs while commenting.
---
That's because killcams are broken, have been for a while.
---
I love how the civilians have the same model as hostages. In Article 5 they are all dead....you have a fuze on your team... no wonder there is no other civilians.
---
Yeah i was talking about IQ
---
It would be cool if they could give you like a one of a kind charm to remember him with while playing. It would be something small and wouldn't take a lot of time or resources
---
I literally just told you what to do. Leave the queue and queue back up, after 2 minutes it's going to ignore you so you are going to sit there in queue until you decide to stop.
---
idk why people ban blitz when montagne is much worse, and people ban mira on maps like consulate where she's basically useless
---
The toxic trio bandit j√§ger and blitz
---
Awh man, rest in peace :‚Äô(
---
What I mean is that I‚Äôve done that multiple times and never gotten a game. I‚Äôve left and joined and left again whenever I get to 4 mins, this time I kept it going to see what it would get up to.
---
I just wanted to try it out again and found a match in 20 sec so ü§∑. a lot of low levels cuz of free weekend
---
Thanks I was going crazy
---
Had something very similar happen to a buddy of mine I played Elder Scrolls online with on PS4. He hadn't been on like normal then we recieved a message from his parents telling us he had taken his own life, he was only 18. RIP Fateweaver &amp; Isaiah
---
That was probably the most foolish way to die in the end
---
Why keep it going wasting your time people have posted 120+ mins. It doesn't matter how long you wait past the first couple of minutes you're just wasting your own time.
---
Well it's best you do it sooner than 4 minutes so you're not wasting your time but you do you dude.
---
I don't think she got banned because of the glitcher, if she didn't que up with him. More likely someone she has queued with did cheat (maybe without her knowledge) and she got the ban too.
---
I personally just don't think the 3-round switchout between offense and defense really lends itself well to Siege.
---
Makes a bit more sense in a game like CS:GO because of the static nature of the bomb sites in each round, the relatively short duration for rounds, the number of rounds needed to win, and because there's an economy system within the match itself.
---
If you get attack on a heavily defense-friendly map, then you have an uphill battle for 3 rounds before you finally get the chance to be put in the role of the more favored side. If you lose those 3 rounds, at that point, your team is probably already tilted to the point of just wanting the match to be over. I've been in a few games like this where people just straight-up leave if they see that they have to start off with the short end of the stick in terms of attacking or defending on a certain map because they know they'll have to try harder for 3 rounds straight and it could be for nothing.
---
Maybe it works in pro-league where people can keep their heads cool even if they didn't do too well for those 3 rounds, but for a lot of typical players in ranked, they don't have that type of patience and will get upset fairly quickly if they have to fight an uphill battle. They'd much rather throw the round and match so they can try again in a new one.
---
NAT type? I never have this issue.
---
You CAN, but it‚Äôs not the most effective way of getting kills. 
---
Someone with an SMG or AR is going to more than likely burst you down before you even get close enough.
---
and I'm saying only shitters main echo
---
Kaid has the best shotgun in game (a very good slug shotgun, dokkaebi and vigils are abysmal and I wouldn't recommend), along with sledge, smoke and mute due to their automatic secondaries if you need to play long range lines of sight. Sledge is the best attacker in terms of shotgun combat, because even though bucks shotgun is better for destruction, it's not nearly as effective a weapon due to the massive spread. Sledge can get in really close with his hammer and use a very lethal shotgun effectively. Bandit and Jager have the best pump action action shorties in the game imo, but I prefer smoke and mute on defence because they ALSO get a secondary smg.
---
unpopular opinion but Nokk should have gotten a diffrent pre exisiting gun but I can't think what.
---
Dead civilians? Oh, you better believe Fuze is there to admire the beauty of it.
---
I love this. The sunny side of the siege community. Lifts my spirits after getting teamkilled last night, when I asked "why" I got the reply "cos I got swag yo" .........
---
I should finish it when there's free weekends around, I guess.
---
Harvard wants to know your location
---
The two people that said what stairs???
---
Doesnt work every day, but every once in a while you may be able to find a match. Its a good thing Ubi doesnt listen to the people who want it removed.
---
The eyes are to close to each
---
üëç
---
I'd rather have 4 new ops no new maps and a year of bug fixes and polish.
---
Hey thanks for that op! It‚Äôs great to see you changed your mind and retreated!
---
The maps, most of them are defender favored, even the coveted ESL maps do.
---
Where is the note: WARNING STAIRS
---
As far as I know it should only ban people who are in a squad with someone who gets banend for cheating, not if you're paired with a cheater by the matchmaking.
---
Small world
---
Capitao, Smoke, Maestro, Valk and IQ should be S tier. Caveira F tier and Ela E tier. I would place Castle either in A or high B as well. I don't really agree with the majority of the tier list, but these were the things that stood out the most for me.
---
I get this as well sometimes and I just restart the game. Don‚Äôt know what else to do though.
---
I think it's great that they put tchunky in the middle
---
Yeah but when I die to body shots that should have easily been covered by the shield, I dont think that's a "visual" glitch
---
Doing Gods work
---
I don‚Äôt main him, but I like to play him sneakily with a suppressor
---
I want a drone like echo or twitch that heals and one that flies freely and stun/does a little damage like Maestro.
---
I dont wanna ruin it, but that's not the play
---
Maestro, maverick, and alibi
---
No they reversed that when they removed the starter pack. Now all version other than the ultimate version you need to grind out the base operators like the og game 500-1000-1500-2000
---
Out here with that Gucci face mask lol
---
No idea but I know my friend got it way before me
---
It's the best wtf do u mean
---
Rip Isaiah
---
Of course it's too early to tell at this point, but I hope they just haven't slapped the Rainbow Six brand on it to boost sales and its appeal to customers. 
---
Rainbow Six in space doesn't exactly appeal to me personally, but we'll see.
---
Yea that sounds logical. Well hopefully it does get announced and we get to hear some good details about it. 
---
Kinda hoping they allow you to use defenders aswell as attackers too.
---
It is my dude
---
And responding with a trying-to-troll-but-instead-sounded-salty comment? Okay... Seems to me u cant move on from the game.
---
I‚Äôve never played ranked, do attacker‚Äôs start farther away or something
---
RIP Isaiah üôèüèº
---
I mean, i can do that now after a good 4hrs to understand the recoil and 1hr of THunt per day to practice.
---
If you don't have any available ops it puts you on recruit
---
Whoa, calm down dude. Looks like you're getting emotional.
---
I don't see why they should personally, I'd love a discount of course, but people who played previous rainbow six titles didn't get a discount for siege, or people who played the original assassin's creed don't get a discount for the later games.
---
Total maybe
---
it's okay to be wrong sometimes
---
But that makes zero sense. I understand the argument for new weapons if they are actually new, but why would you want them to just basically be reskins? Besides, they said that N√∏kk with an ar and an acog was broken af and way too strong.
---
Friend's fault, not only did he run into a prefire but he also shouldn't have gotten kill hungry as a Monty when you were going to get the kill
---
Yea as everyone else is saying it‚Äôs definitely on him. If he was going to move, which he had no reason to, he should have communicated his move to you
---
No my friend called Mitchell actually bought this for me I‚Äôm not that desperate
---
Thanks
---
Yes Clash is my fav but I play her the least because she too op
---
I'd say both and neither. You did see him moving with enough time to stop shooting, but he did start moving with no warning. Biggest thing here though is that wild ass hitreg because I swear to god you didn't even actually hit his head.
---
I know. It needs to be improved.
---
No sadly not
---
Y'all need to chill then, I mean, at least in casual/fake ranked. In general insulting people is such a childish thing lmao, funny though, but stupidly childish.
---
I meant that it was condensed and I couldn't select 5 or 4 without scrolling each individual question to the left.
---
Oh well, I thought it was fine
---
I think it‚Äôll be fine
---
Damn. Well at least it was only $12 lol
---
Why can‚Äôt people ever take a decent photo of their skin? I swear it‚Äôs a damn meme at this point to have your gun rotated to the worst possible angle to show what they got.
---
I like the bottom one better than Batman and he would def win in a fight lol
---
Its exactly like ranked its just hidden
---
He uses a specially made rounds that could penetrate breakable walls, including reinforced walls.
---
it does 80 damage per round, and damage fall-off is pretty short. (smallest - 26)
---
It makes holes big enough you can peek through it,
---
and you can hit the enemy behind the wall.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pretty expert level operator.
---
Nah
---
Awesome, I wish my friends were so friendly
---
Yes us they get the saltiest of any rank. Mostly the people carried here as with a high rank they think they are better than anyone else.
---
this is me lmao
---
Not to be confused with Dj Blyatman
---
Way to strong. Besides, she‚Äôs not even in the main game yet let‚Äôs wait and see how she performs. Same goes for Warden (though his loadout is much weaker)
---
Probably a breaching charge somewhere. The aoe is a little buggy with those
---
Aye Another RVA r6 player
---
Modding on console?
---
I agree strongly
---
His fault. I have a friend like this too.
---
I think its like :Vigil: or somerhinf like that
---
Rest In Peace üòû
---
Ubi is justvwaiting for you to level up one more time
---
Update: I updated my drivers and the red circle is now acting like some kind directional sound radar. For example, If a sound comes from behind me in game then the bottom part lights up. This is the strangest thing I‚Äôve seen in a while.

Hello lebronx974, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bxtwdj/pcps4xbox_new_spot_antispawnkill_et_spot_mira/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
their cosmetics really have me wondering sometimes.
---
some legendaries are lit asf - others are like wtf
---
I call bull. Seeing as 90% of Bomb matches that I get into when queueing for **Realistic** are Article 5. I get it atleast 5 times a day. And instantly leave 5 times a day.
---
Why?
---
Wow 1 free cosmetic item that you dont have to pay 25k for. WOW.
---
Be careful tho, that thing kicks like a mule
---
He died in a motorcycle accident
---
tbh seems like ur projecting a bit not everyone focuses on meaningless internet points
---
maybe i make comments for the sake of making them?
---
thx anyway tho
---
I want to cry.
---
PC gamers.
---
Gotta be the kill steal. Large disrespect.
---
&gt; every once in a while you may be able to find a match
---
I wonder how I can get that to work. I queue for **Realistic** and still get into A5 atleast 5 times a day.
---
/u/lgsunknown Cause people who want to play Realistic are pissed we get pulled into this shit several times a day. And no, disabling Bartlett in the map preferences doesn't work. I could disable the Bomb gamemode, but I wanna play that.
---
That flashbang at the end might have helped too lol.
---
Monty moved back while u had an angle, u kept shooting while he was moving back. Simple
---
Its casual, and i own the game on Xbox, so not free weekend
---
But which Jager?
---
Actually I've gotten messages from Microsoft saying successful bans from even talking shit to other people have been applied. There is a character limit before the report will be manually reviewed.
---
Hang in there buddy!
---
I disagree, Caveira has a decent pickrate in ranked and is the best roamer in the game, not to mention she is the only operator immune to Jackal, that itself has become extremeley valuable today.
---
For the range about how far
---
I swear it‚Äôs not the people I took another photo that showed the skin but it didn‚Äôt show up In my gallery
---
I tried survermonkey, but it was laggy and the best survey options were locked behind a pay-wall :/
---
7m. (about 23 feet)
---
Probably one of the best op ideas I‚Äôve seen recently well done also good job on the artwork
---
Understandable
---
So wait is this paid dlc, a free event, or an entirely new game?
---
No one is gonna bother shooting his emp‚Äôs they‚Äôre too small. Besides ADS‚Äôs destroy them anyway.
---
Instead of nerfing him they could add another operator like him, because twitch is too unreliable as a substitute for him.
---
Yeah I saw gu in the description and I am pretty sure you can‚Äôt jam toxins
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox lol
---
Shut up you dick
---
I agree, it‚Äôs not that good of a clip. Atleast not good enough for someone to think I‚Äôm M + K

**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**
---
Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
It's either not a good team, or ur a bad apple.
---
One of the standards of getting into an esl team is taking blame.
---
High plats up to even top10 diamonds do that to keep the team clean and focused on winning the game not the arguement.
---
So by that calculation ur a low plat.
---
What?
---
I mean, there a dude screaming in the well in ruins attacker spawn on Villa. I don't know about his backstory but I assume he's a civie.
---
Hostage is going to be fun this weekend
---
Nah. Just a misunderstanding between us.
---
Amazing.
---
Didn't somebody do that in a tweet to a verified person and they responded with that link? Or am I imagining things?
---
Neither it‚Äôs dumb luck that you moved into eachother
---
Check out her work on instagram, she‚Äôs amazing, for real.
---
Honestly I don't get why twitch had her drone nerfed down to 5 shots. She would be as viable as Thatcher if she had 15 again. If anyone could kindly explain why they needed her in the first place I'd appreciate it.
---
Accurate to a T
---
Just a little prick
---
I have all ops but i mean SMG kinda confusing if they're called smg but arent actually smg.
---
I would pay top dollar for this
---
well if it is bannable, where can I report this?
---
Or you know... because they‚Äôve been catering their maps for bomb, so they‚Äôre not balanced for secure area. You can‚Äôt make everyone happy.
---
Theres no point in fixing the old shields so instead they will apply the fixes to the new ones and release them instead.
---
I am simple man, i see Post with Bizon, i upvote
---
Adults aren't even good with precise movements at that high of a sensitivity. There's no muscle memory development if all you're doing is twitching your wrist to do a 180.
---
60 is good enough
---
They removed the bundle from the store few months after it went live. Was in store for less than 6 months.
---
I'm a jackal main and I have a "fetish" for that
---
Awesome
---
Good way to present all of this. My only problem is that I don't want a fresh player to take doc and die with full stims like me.
---
im in ps4 and will have to wait 2+ minutes before i back out and try again
---
Old owners still have it?
---
the ragdoll makes it so much better

If you are using Steam and if you want to upgrade R6 Standard edition to deluxe, gold or ultimate edition, then follow the below steps.
---
1. **Click -&gt;** https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGame/?appid=359550
---
2. **Select -&gt;** "I want to permanently remove this game from my account"
---
 
---
3. Then buy the desired edition on steam.
---
4. Play the game. You will retain your progress.
---
Nah, Gridlock is one of the best operators to secure a plant. Her gadget plus smoke grenades make her great at getting a defuser plant off.
---
Nice bro! ‚úäüî•
---
I agree with you too. We need some more operators in thatcher's position.
---
The only difference is that Gold has this year season pass
---
Pretty much, you can't just get it anymore. They never specified it was limited time bundle, just plain removed it out of blue from store.
---
üëÄ oops.
---
I am in ps4 aswell.
---
Been trying for 20 minutes now with no luck.
---
there are people in a container on Kamala screaming when you shoot the container
---
Omg that guy is awful.
---
How is this the worst achievement, am I missing something?
---
Must be how my day is going but just shed a tear, RIP
---
can you link her page? I must see the shoes
---
Fuze is a good person, he has nothing to do with civilians. I know it‚Äôs a meme but come on man.
---
To be  honest,  I hope  it's not  a  big   project. I'd rather see  them focus on a  new  singleplayer Rainbow 6   game  than on a generic zombie shooter  with   a Tom  Clancy  label.
---
Therapist: Ash who uses drone isn't real, she won't hurts you

Ash who uses drone:
---
Bro my dad OWNS hereford he get you spawnpeeked
---
That's an opinion, it's for you to decide.
---
Nice idea, ty
---
Yes we 100% need this. I hate Casual so much because it‚Äôs just a mess of people leaving and joining and teamkilling, and I enjoy hostage and biohazard more than bomb. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll play this game much anymore if they don‚Äôt fix the ranked problem.
---
Cool
---
Looks like max payne
---
They said they dont want to make a Siege Successor, doesnt mean they aint making new games in the R6 universe
---
Lame post, stolen post and the actual Smoke elite has already been leaked. 
---
Low effort post 1/5
---
Yeah lmao

Do you gameshare with someone?

I like chalet personally. I honestly think that I play the best on chalet and I don‚Äôt know why. Really nice looking map, too.

It's called karma whoring though . and they're almost taking over the reddit

Hello fellow players, I also only have one main per side and I want to be your friend even though I am not a mute main. Is this possible? Please check a box below:
---
\[  \] Yes
---
\[  \] No
---
\[  \] Maybe
---
Wrong
---
You said in the history of r6 there has been 0 paid dlc, the stuff on the steam site is technically DLC and is paid.
---
This is so fucking wholesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Literally unplayable
---
This is absolutely incredible.
---
How'd you do?
---
Same
---
How is this relevant? Do people even read the post before replying? They are talking about a new game in the series that is going to be exclusively PVE and might not even have any connection to siege.
---
I'm so proud of thos community
---
Pve only? Meh
---
Rainbow Six Siege anyway.
---
No. I have another friend who played siege without ps plus aswell, i dont know if he can still play it thought.
---
It‚Äôs rare to find people who hate of BwB
---
Bruh I almost called bullshit
---
I can do this one D2. but I can't play with friend, it won't let me join or invite to a party.
---
What stuff? I'm on console
---
Pulse with shotgun
---
That was so clean and satisfying to watch
---
Strange, i was able to invite anyone.
---
They are currently back out in the test servers.  Which means they should be out at operation phantom sight 
---
Mid way through phantom sight we should be seeing the deployable shield rework
---
Just nope.
---
I'm making it.
---
#‚ÄùAbsolutely ‚Äú
---
I don‚Äôt think it looks too bad but it‚Äôs not at all how I imagine bandit looking. It makes him look to big. It might have been an alright look for a different or new op
---
Just dont play it then.
---
The only legendary I got was on my first pack for the revolver for gign which has engravings
---
phoneposting is exactly why you're a fucking normie
---
Had to flex on us with the black ice
---
Would you suck on big Rhondas mega clit for it?
---
had to do a double take while scrolling, it looks so good.
---
He cane outside and teabagged, then we lost.
---
So,  this is the reason we don't have Clash, claymores, and shields?  
---
Also, I had a lot of problems last night trying to play just one game, uPlay was going down every 5 minutes.
---
i mean i‚Äôd hope you‚Äôd believe in your own bullshit, otherwise what‚Äôs the point ya know
---
O.M.G ... My true love OUTBREAK finally
---
Tbh, I think the game could really use another operation health.  Fix the spaghetti code and optimize it so that the netcode/servers don't struggle so much.
---
I don't know what other players' experience is, but (on Xbox) late or missed hit registration, lag spikes and rubber-banding (including sometimes when lag is fine) is an every day occurrence for me.  And it's something I pretty much never experience with other games (COD, Halo, Battlefield, battle royale games).
---
Small sample size, but messing around on WEU with friends lately was more stable than playing on the closer US servers.
---
I'd rather a Player vs. Terrorist story expansion. I love siege but I've been missing that aspect terribly.
---
The first seaonal askin if im not wrong
---
usually you‚Äôll find some decent op ideas on here, but some take it to the extreme with their abilities
---
It took me forever to get a black ice and even when I did it was for tachankas shotgun. And his first pack is an ash black ice. I hate it
---
My favorite ace was on Oregon and rook didn't put the armor down until the round started. I rush in and everyone was grabbing armor.
---
I thought the right was actually hibana

He stuck it to the wall

Lol i just wanna match up against you kunts. Cant wait to screw u twats over

Thank you sir

That or the 100 defend hostage rounds in TH. Are the only o as I'm still missing, even tho I'll probably never get lucky enough to get the Charge kill.
---
Most disappointing? Only legendary skin I use.
---
What do you mean? I know there‚Äôs a lot wrong with the game, but FOV and aspect ratio is a choice in a lot of games and it‚Äôs kind of fun to mess around with, especially 4:3  60 FOV Ash holo rush
---
I used to actually think her mirror could be fired through while the seal was not broken when i first got the game.
---
Not pistols, I sleep

That‚Äôs a possibility

Maybe I've studied or learnt proper English coz I wasn't born with a silver spoon up my arse and i will accept the compliment of being a child just shows I'm young. If you don't understand the cheese slice thing then no point in throwing a ham slice insult my way so hop on your flying llama and go eat more shoes you insole muncher.
---
It's so you don't get distracted by switching sides. By the time you switch sides and switch back, you forget what happened in the first round.
---
I think its because of the free weekend - it requires ps plus. I think after the free weekend you can play again without ps plus.
---
Roam. Use your ability to your advantage when 1v1, They don't actually know where are you until they see you with their own eyes [?]
---
Nah dude her name is "Noban" now
---
i mean complete pack
---
Because every PS4 game needs PS+ for multiplayer
---
Really like the idea of using the Shiva virus. I get that R6 is its own thing now but I‚Äôd like the game to tie itself with the book more than it is now.
---
Look into reddit posts, joining their perspective discords, twitter posts, and reaching out to the owners of the small leagues. Most Leagues have a Discord usually with a section to apply as a Caster. And usually the main caster is the one streaming due to having 0 latency and able to call out the plays on the spot, co-casting can be difficult due to finding adequate solutions for spectating the match.  
---
I've joined CES (Competitive eSports) and Collective eSports as a Caster so far and loving it.
---
Repost
---
Well I was just wondering if there was any more information out there about the game besides this little snippet.
---
Played it last night and it worked exactly like I predicted. We were adapting and so were our enemies. It was fun.
---
Use the shotgun as secondary and blow out the wall first before you reinforce then put up the mirror.
---
are good
---
Popsicle stick??????
---
Wow amazing work!
---
Im 100% sure

i was working so much when outbreak was out i olny got to play a maybe a hour a day with randoms never got those cool glowing chibis
---
Idk. Thats why i was hoping it happened
---
r/ShittyShittyRainbow6
---
If you have more than one account on your PS4 and one of the others had ps+ it counts as you having ps+ too, so if that‚Äôs the case maybe the other accounts ps+ ran out?
---
Yes but you still have to unlock original operators with renown.
---
It's actually quite good if you can't control the recoil on the type with acog, or want to play her more close up.
---
Thinking about ops in this way is maybe even more useful for advanced play on organized teams, where you have assigned roles. Newbies just need to worry about shooting the correct team. 
---
As someone who recently got assigned a ‚Äúroam clear‚Äù role on my team, the AR ratings really interest me. Doka I have barely even considered because I hate not having an automatic weapon, but maybe I should force myself to use her more. I am curious what the reason was for giving IQ such a high score - I guess she can fish out a roaming vigil or pulse with her gadget, but droning is so much more reliable, and having the gadget equipped is a huge disadvantage in a gun fight. 
---
Lion and Gridlock becoming unlocked in ESL forces me to also think more about picking them. Neither will help you expose a roamer if you don‚Äôt know where they are (no need to expose yourself to a Lion scan if you‚Äôre hidden), but their gadgets might help to isolate and box in roamers once they‚Äôre spotted.
---
Yeah, i was having the same thoughts. I will post an update after the free weekend.
---
Again, dude I'm sorry but you're not making any sense. But you also don't understand sarcasm which again does show you're incredibly young, it's not a compliment since the reason I've come to this conclusion is from your failure to control and convey your emotions. Feel free to keep going though, I'm getting a laugh watching you try insulting for what appears to be the first time :)

for a real u.s. made one yeah around $1000 but you can get a chinese repro for around $75

At least Buck has someone to cover him from that spooky bitch

This is just R6 RTX on.

what about year 1 2 3 4 operators?

wtf was the first clip what

and how is the price of originals? 500~1000?

You'll have them

I finished it, apparently secondary smgs arent smgs. smg11 and smg12 are machine pistols. I went defense and used smoke fmg9 and it worked. kinda confusing tbh kinda wish the challenge wasnt vague
---
No. You get the season pass for Year 4.
---
Probably good OpFor too.
---
With ELO on the line (even if its not as much as a competitive mode game) and bans for team killing or leaving early, the toxicity doesn't seem like it'd be much more than in a current ranked match.
---
When attackers drone a room you are roaming in, let them see you first at a spot then activate the his ability directly and immediately change your spot.
---
You should've heard my reaction
---
then i need to buy year 5 operators by renown or r6 credit in the future? not free?
---
spam ability at the beginning of the round so you can get 2+ points per drone, per use of the ability, and always topscore
---
Yeah, even after remodelling Hibana they didn't bother to look how a japanese woman looks like.

I have some tips for you.
---
1 When playing vertical, use the breaching charge first as a distraction and then set off the real fuse charge.
---
2 Use his gadget when a teammember has an angle inside the objective to shoot then while running from the charge
---
3.Use the gadget to clear a room from gadgets. Like the Gym/Bedroom on Clubhouse
---
4. Team up with Capitao and let him smoke/fire up the room first before you detonate the charges
---
Yes. Year 5 starts next year. We're still in Year 4 Season 1. You'll get 3 more seasons for free.
---
Most of the time, we just goof off in Casual, I mean more power to you, but higher ranks usually do not care.

The best part is I recibed like 3 different responses from Ubi at the same time regarding this saying different things lmao

One told me that they contacted the ubi shop  and that I should check again in the few days if they are any changes.

If you are gonna contact ubi support send 2 fullscreen picture (do not crop it) that one shows the wrong advertisement and the other one the actual price in the store, sorry for the long response

Outbreak was, IIRC, built by a separate team. I anticipate that this will be a cheap spinoff sorta deal, maybe 20-30 bucks for a 10 hour campaign and a half decent multiplayer, as opposed to a full fledged $60 triple A release.  Not unlike Far Cry's Blood dragon and New Dawn DLC's. Just speculation though.
---
I‚Äôve seen better commons I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want it

Yeah, her ability involves her melting through steel panels, a skill that only a few characters have. She launches things that stick to the panel and melt through, and they do kind of [look like flowers](https://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/e6/75/9d/85/d4/hibanana_x_solid.png).
---
You are asking why you should have to pay 25K renown for an operator with a similar ability to a completely different operator? I don't know how long you have been playing, but Glaz's ability ISN'T his thermal. It is technically his scope, which offers a zoom that was buffed with thermal. His thermal is now receiving a nerf, while the scope keeps the zoom. Warden wasn't made to imitate Glaz, it was to solve the problem of smoke plant denial relying on Echo/Maestro. A ton of people are incredibly excited for Warden as he allows for a lot of previously "unwinnable" situations to be won. You can choose to view the operators in the most basic light possible, but in no way should that cause fault to be placed on Ubisoft. Just because a new operator shares ONE similarity with a completely different operator doesn't mean they are a copy of them, and shouldn't take anything away from the price of the operator. You are getting a new defender, and you are going to pay the price for a new operator.
---
I got one like 2 months ago

I'll take the renown, I'm not picky.

I would argue that is different tho. Counter Strike always had one game mode and over the years added others. Siege however started with certain game modes and now removes them.

Your contradicting yourself your saying that‚Äôs the charm isn‚Äôt worth anything but it‚Äôs worth more than 5k renown.

It‚Äôs in the title...

Well wouldn‚Äôt a hostage be a civilian?

Yeah, Kafe Dostoyevsky has one that can insta kill one defender at a spawn point that idk atm
---
9.2/10
---
Would it really be that interesting? Wasn't the Rainbow Six story kinda wrapped up already?
---
Exactly, he wouldn‚Äôt care about this dead civilian. He doesn‚Äôt care about their lives so he‚Äôs not going to care about them when they‚Äôre dead
---
They removed the shields dumbass, they literally announce in game when stuff is getting removed, why do none of you ever read it!
---
Depends on your play style, but jackal has the most versatile weapons by far. 
---
Dokk is either long range, like over 20 meters, or really close range, like under 10 meters. 
---
Lion is also somewhat versatile, although his biggest drawback is that he doesn‚Äôt have the shotgun secondary that Jacks has. He also doesn‚Äôt have as high a fire rate I don‚Äôt think.
---
ha gey

I can‚Äôt even download the demo on my PS4, I‚Äôve tried everything and search repeatedly. After not being able to on my PS4 I signed in and get the free demo mobile and tried to downloaded by clicking the button on my phone but it‚Äôs not working.
---
They won't do it because Ubi doesn't care sadly. It's easy money if we transfer to another system. 
---
I want this feature so badly. I'm switching from PS4 to PC and wanna transfer the hours of work I've put into the game, and also not drain my bank account rebuying what I bought. Sadly they will make some BS excuse as to why its impossible or something.

Almost all the guns in star wars are just converted from real life weapons.

---
Well thats just heresy
---
That‚Äôs true. But it‚Äôs just cool to see the original model for a Star Wars weapon on siege
---
Not really. They got it started with Article 5 and just left it on a cliffhanger making it sound like the white masks were still a threat.
---
I'm absolutely hyped and pumped for the new Pick &amp; Ban coming to ranked. Haven't played the game in months, i think this is gonna be my return to the game.

Alright, thanks!

Hello _Muchpaper_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bxydos/audio_issue/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Ew
---
Prequel trilogy/animated shows

I think that would give pistols a bit too much viability. They‚Äôre meant to be a last resort type thing, or a timely substitute if you can‚Äôt reload. 
---
I think adding a sight to some of them, Cav‚Äôs pistol, P9, GSG9 pistol, revolvers, etc. would make them far too exchangeable.
---
Thank you! All I can hope is that it somehow gets fixed with the new season

Oh yeah I thought u also mean the stormtroopers and that's what confused me terribly

Ah, I see. Nice work then.

Thanks for the input. Really helpful

I'm pretty sure that can be solved with 20 minutes and a Google search.

When‚Äôs e3?
---
&gt; The worst part is that there is no punishment for them, you can report them for toxic behavior, but everyone knows that Ubi doesn‚Äôt fucking do anything about that. 
---
Yeah, like, what is Ubi supposed to do? Such a system would rely on some advanced AI in order to differ between bad players and trolls - OR you would need several people to watch the vods and then swing the ban hammer. 
---
I'm sorry to burst your bubble right there, but there really isn't much which can be done in such situations, except recording the events and sending it to the support. They eventually will have a look at it and take actions, if needed.
---
Furthermore, f-up games happen to all of us, so don't worry about that too much.
---
Why would you aim with a shotgun
---
You will die a lot in the beginning but each time you learn something new, I‚Äôm nearing level 100 myself and I started in year two I have clips that are from 2017 that show me playing like an idiot and I thought I was the shit. You will play and play to no avail, until you pop off. When you pop off you will be asking for more of that euphoria and that‚Äôs what gets you hooked onto this game
---
Plot twist. Pretty sure Caviera is Gay (with Twitch). At least that was implied in Wildlands with the R6 DLC.
---
how do i do that?/ thx for responding
---
Yes you have to pay to this official R6 PayPal account and you‚Äôll get the season pass.
---
Is this what that survey Ubisoft sent out was about?
---
Will they spend time and money to program good bots? Or all the money will go to hype creating marketing machine? We all know the answer...  
---
Remember the AI quality from Wildlands.
---
44 now üòâ
---
You aren‚Äôt forced. The F2 would have less damage and basically 5 less rounds too boot. Maybe give her an angled grip to help alleviate the ADS time but for more recoil. Could still keep the ACOG and would still be accurate as it is currently
---
You need to watch Pro League and or any high skill Siege tournament. The way they play Monty, really exposes how one-sided it can be. Traps don't really so much if the Monty is backed up by another player whose job is specifically to clear any traps or obstacle for the Monty so he can push in with ease.
---
You spelt sasg-12 wrong.

I tried to send a link but it was auto removed
---
Room behind the bar
---
Can this be a full edition to the game instead of a limited 3 week event that we only ever got to play once? It'd be nice to have another pve mode to mess around with. They only do the limited event because of Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 before it. But at least in TF2 you could play those map events after it was gone if you really wanted to.
---
I know I‚Äôm going to sound like I‚Äôm blowing smoke here but I did. I typed the name of the charm, ‚Äúcharm‚Äù and legendary skins.

Guartees that at least one pellet from the spread will land dead center. Everything else is random though. With semi-autos i do agree that is better to hipfire.
---
1440p 144hz thank me later

It's more likely you were kicked for being new.

It's stupid, but some people don't want to deal with having someone new (and thus not playing with game sense built up over hundreds of hours) on their team.
---
I‚Äôm being team killed by vigil * seriously it‚Äôs always vigil who team kills me no matter who play him in my time of playing it hasn‚Äôt never been anyone else
---
I‚Äôve always done it for personal reasons. Buck was the first Operator that killed me when I started Siege. I‚Äôll never forgive him. I do believe there is a trailer which includes both of them!
---
/u/vredditdownloader
---
Well I wasn‚Äôt directing it towards you specifically  and wasn‚Äôt trying to be a cunt so sorry if you took it that way.
---
3rd floor can actually be attacked much easier if you assign a buck to go to sewing room to eliminate the typical Mira stray eliminating the possibility of them covering Tractor room from the site across from it as easily as they could? Is it defender favoured? To an extent but I don‚Äôt think everybody is using the tools in front of them to counterplay. 
---
As for the buffer rooms, this is a good thing? If we didn‚Äôt have buffer rooms we would have more rooms like Drug storage on TP and Trophy on Chalet where a attacker can just hop into the window and plant right from the get go, also giving the attackers the handicap of not defending the defuser from right outside the window.
---
A big map isn‚Äôt a inherently bad thing, if it‚Äôs done right you have a effective map like Hereford or Villa. Done wrong you have Theme park and Fortress.
---
for me its the wave skin from the japanese season
---
At least the PP19 would be do-able. Kapkan and Tachanka already have one, essentially. Add the tube magazine which would increase ammo capacity and remove the under barrel utility for grips.  
---
This is all just talk, of course. I've seen many people wanting them to "just remove" Buck's master key so another Op could use his AR. Can't say I don't like that idea, but who knows how complicated it really is...
---
It's true there's 1 attack and defense, but the randomization occurs at the start of overtime.  The teams alternate after each overtime round, but the starting side for the first overtime round is random.
---
I loved the outbreak event
---
that sucks.
---
I guess after you buy all the OPS you gotta spend your dosh on something. Kudos reward man.
---
it basically is
---
In theory,  yes.  But those types of matches aren't fun.  It's best when it's more evenly matched. 
---
The point is that *no one* wants to get their shit kicked in 0-3 even if they swap sides during Round 4. It doesn't matter if they lose that match and go on to find a new match where they stomp 3-0.
---
The issue is all about the psychological mindset - it is more difficult to prevent feeling tilted,  down or upset that your team is going 0-3 as opposed to *swapping sides every other round*.
---
And I'm saying this as someone who plays for fun, has a terrible K/D and can take literally 2-3 hours of having my face wrecked before I start feeling hopeless.
---
It's about balance. I don't care that Pro Teams do it. Pro Teams make the game their careers and have established practices and dedicated roles
---
 Your average Joe who logs on for 2 hours, 3 times a week, isn't treating it like a job.
---
not in terms of the maps I really like pro league maps
---
Just search 'operator price' and go back about 3 months ago
---
Or I could actually play the game like I already do and know from experience that he isn‚Äôt that bad.
---
Most people put Ela‚Äôs grismont mines above doorframes meaning you can‚Äôt destroy it without setting it off, along with some liking to throw their grismont mines at Monty forcing him to drop his shield. Same thing with Lesion since people will throw their gu mines at Monty making him back off, along with unless you bring Iq or carefully study the ground you aren‚Äôt going to see them.
---
true
---
The problem with this solution, along with the current issue if someone leaves mid-interrogation, is that it assumes Caveira would've definitely gotten the interrogation had the player not left.  The best solution IMO is to have the operator model for the downed player stay in the game until it bleeds out, is revived, is interrogated, or dies through other means.  This way, if the attackers are in position to stop the interrogation they don't get screwed by the player leaving (who contrary to popular belief, is not always part of a squad with the other players) but the defenders aren't screwed out of the interrogation if no attacker can stop it.
---
No Fun Allowed‚Ñ¢

You might want to report this to Ubisoft as I'm pretty sure this shouldn't be allowed.

just in case anyone was wondering about who was being reduced price wise(either forgot or didnt know)

Dude this is straight up amazing. This girl has more talent in her finger than I have in my e tire existence.
---
I don't want to be that guy but. he's dead!
---
Glitches my guy. They took those out because of it
---
idk bro, they just play and they're surprised when the menu changes every few months and they dont read the news
---
Sinner.
---
Clash is double banned. Also how even did they do that
---
Happen to me too, for the first time since beta. I dont know why

Hello RealDuolingoOwl, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bxzx4w/ash_is_godly_operator_so_this_was_drawn_with/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Right? Like the first thing i do is check patch notes and come to the reddit but i do play it more serious. I guess someone could say the same about me and COD but I've never seen COD as super competitive even though there is an esports community around it
---
Because playing the same few maps would be a snoozefest.
---
:O Really?! Every round I thought I put them down somewhere and completely forgot where I put them, that explains why people been getting mad at me when I've been walking around looking for them.
---
Yes you should be punished bc u chose to play with those toxic people. 
---
Really the random player was trolling? What chance does he have to troll? He is out numbered
---
You need to put yourself in a solo queue players shoes. You seem very naive.
---
Was that supposed to be a pun?
---
Yea they probably won't be back in time for the new season but we'll see
---
In pro league they do 3 round rotation and depends on the tournament are six and some are 7
---
She's just an alternative to Nomad- better weapons, worse gadget. With how extremely good Nomad is though... There's not that much of a reason to pick her at all.
---
The skin is back
---
but
---
You can never get it
---
Some skins are pretty basic, but some of them are really really good
---
So maybe only add the optic to some of the lower tier pistols
---
Wtf
---
qqeeqqeeqqe
---
Most players are casuals, stop the press!
---
Thank you!
---
Ubisoft should of used her for the recreation of Hibana.
---
They should be, I cant be arsed to look for it again but they mentioned they have a "fix" which is more like a band-aid fix that resets players when they perform the glitch that will be coming out on the 11th. So fingers crossed we can stop dealing with #NoBalls run-outs every 10 seconds.
---
I can't remember if it ended, but if it didn't it would be awesome to see how outbreak ends
---
Her gadget is good in late game but early game she suffers. If you had to buff (not saying she needs one) her gadget it should dispel more traps
---
No it's not gonna be awesome..  
---
Anything outside of Siege won't be awesome because it will most likely be paid.  
---
It's a pretty cool game mode, but we want this in the game.
---
Come to a game this late you will get stomped.
---
Depends on the gun

Do you realise how powerful it is post plant

It doesn't, this is more likely a weird bug.

To me at always feels like a fist pump kind of thing. Like they're just really pumped. Wayyy better than tbagging in my opinion
---
i bet you were screaming your head off when you did that.
---
Should've been glaz "details"
---
i would love to have more bans, but this made me LMAO
---
Maverick can burn wall in stealth. But Sheriff's gadget is pretty loud so it isnt great for stealth gameplay
---
The logo at the beginning is way to long, downvoted.
---

R4C Holo, Flash Hider, vertical grip, Off Duty out fit
---
idk
---
Waht's your username, so I can r6tracker your MMR history?
---
Her gadget is great tho
---
It's like I'm not pressing the button, even though I am, so "the green circle" won't appear that im talking
---
Yeah you can look at the top left and see normal speed
---
Why are you getting downvoted lol this is why I just genuinely downvote everyone no matter what shits ridiculous
---
I would‚Äôve gave an award if I could lmao
---
I hate that people call her a worse Nomad. Even though they have similar gadgets Gridlock is more effective at taking over bomb sites whilst Nomad specialises in flank and run-out denial.
---
A fat 9.9
---
Imho its gonna be a failure...
---
*kitchen roll?*
---
It‚Äôs a good game to play with friends. I just started playing as well. If you have friends with less skill they can play ranked with you no matter the skill level, and because of the 1 shot headshot + low recoil + no movement mechanics in this game, even the most potato friends can contribute a lot unlike other games like CS/LoL where you‚Äôre basically down a person. Also so far in the ranking system (up to Plat 3 so far) its not that sweaty since everyone plays sooooo slowly which lets you talk a lot during this downtime with your friends or try out dumb strats. Seriously almost every game as defender you usually wait until there‚Äôs no time left before they push.
---
You just defined my Saturday mornings üëèüèΩ
---
You can climb up the banister and you can spawn peak the attackers through the bars, it's hard for them to see you, but easy for you to see them, it works both spawns aswell
---
eh i dont want a stand alone outbreak but a expansion to siege would be nice. i guess it will be a "not expansion" like new dawn is for far cry 5 due to limitation to place all content on the game for consoles.
---
in wich case i'm fine.
---
Ohhh ok I got you now I was just confused why you were looking down so much
---
Is this guy blind or did he not see the news?
---
I'm terrible at balancing so I needed to keep my sights on the banister
---
agreed. i‚Äôm a new player and this chart needs a tldr version or something cuz i have no idea how to make sense of this wall
---
Is your discord push to talk the same as your in game? Also, why have push to talk for discord? I dont cause I can just mute my mic If I need to and I'm really not on discord with anyone id want to not talk to.
---
Or they could add individual map selection like they have for t hunt
---
and why is it shit?
---
Thermite/Hibana, Mira/Maestro/Echo
---
if this is a new game and soft expansion like new dawn for far cry 5, i will miss my siege crew, i hope new characters are good.
---
yeah season 8 was 6 points to win, but still rotation after 5 rounds
---
I don't like it either tbh, mainly because I like the constant switching.
---
the other team also has to defend?
---
Oh yeah, that too
---
Man, I left out quite a few haha. I was really straining to figure out who I was missing without having the game in front of me lol
---
But he is probably giving excellent callouts

Update: Thank for the penalty too! Like losing elo for no reason wasn't enough!

With constant switches u can‚Äôt build up momentum and it‚Äôs a lot harder to work on your strats if they don‚Äôt work out like u want them to

That's a fidget spinner

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.

Typically comes out 2 weeks after new season is released.

Play one game to unlock an operator üòÇ
---
this is pretty useless, the mira should do damage forward, how cool would it be to have someone straffe you outside the wall only to get killed by a mira placement instead
---
What? It says yes next to multiplayer and singleplayer
---
I‚Äôm 30 and play.  Fuck kids can be annoying lol.
---
I just got into Siege again after a couple months of not playing it. My bad I guess?
---
Ah that makes sense
---
Ahh the glory i can feel it
---
Do not go into the helicopter!
---
Some maps are extremely offense sided, others are extremely defense sided. I had games where our team and enemy team won only while attacking. This is a **huge problem** for ranked with only 4 rounds to win the game. If you play a map that favors attackers and you get to attack first, you would in quite big advantage and Vice versa.

---
i hope the new game features the original outbreak as a "terrorist mode"
---
T-hunt is pretty good for improving your aim and learning maps and operator abilitys
---
I know probably nobody really cares, I'm just a singular victim, but what if this happened to you? To your friends? I am getting so tired of these kind of things, it's gotten to the point where the game is purely just frustrating. I've been here since the closed beta but this really shook my faith and trust in this game. I don't know what to think of this.
---
[There you go](https://i.imgur.com/4uAUiJn.jpg).
---
This is what I‚Äôm thinking of when I saw spawn peeking has to be changed. There is STILL a spot on chalet you can be killed upon spawn. You can be shot before moving and yet people still say it‚Äôs all good
---
What platform you on? I'd be down to hop on a Smurf and show you the ropes.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Wow,I use this in ranked now
---
&gt; So my guess is a free event, Outbreak style
---
Yeah I wouldn't hold my breath on that.
---
Outbreak was free to test the waters, try out the concept.
---
it will problably be a standalone expansion like new dawn was for FC5 because of limitation to load assets on consoles memory
---
We need a ‚Äúreport kid button‚Äù
---
Wait ash can‚Äôt use drones? Since when
---
r/wooosh
---
I like it a lot and it's super fun when you're losing 3 - 0 and you make an epic comeback
---
They changed the camera placement, could that be your problem?  The camera is now centered on the character‚Äôs head instead of their shoulder.
---
Confirmed
---
The truth cuts deep
---
???
---
Restart console
---
Alright I hope it works
---
Same thing happened to me, But worse. Lagged out of ranked, had to reque got into an entirely different game and lost to Diamond booster nerds. Lost two games in one, Pretty good I should say. It‚Äôs just ubi and you‚Äôve gotta just deal with it.
---
Good luck
---
I get what you mean,wish we get a "wipeout" section in the scoreboard just like in games such as cod bo4 blackout.
---
The person who downed that one guy gets the full kill and the teammate who killed the downed person gets a wipeout kill point.
---
? How come the legendary 11 kills
---
Fuck off back to Facebook with this shit.

How man gu mines did you place in your doorway

Only problem is that it would be too op if Mozzie was able to throw a twitch drone.

sounds to me like whoever got the down didn't do *enough* work

I think that's actually Hibana...

Is she holding an actual fucking fidget spinner

Cause in terrorist hunt no matters

Im young and kids are annoying.

every season up to now has had a hard MMR reset at the beginning of a new season. with phantom sight, everyone starts out at 2500 elo (around gold 4 I think), and you do placements like that
---
You deserved it
---
They don‚Äôt even acknowledge TH anymore. The AI is broken, the spawn bugs are game breaking, and there has been nothing new.
---
So you‚Äôre saying competitive shouldn‚Äôt be fun.... ok

Restarting my PS4 didn‚Äôt fix it üòî
