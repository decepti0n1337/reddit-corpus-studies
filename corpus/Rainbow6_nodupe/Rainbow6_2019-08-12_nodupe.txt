Yes I’ve seen you play with George, you’re absolutely insane ! Will be checking out the content for sure ! One question I have to ask if you don’t mind, do you play on night mode or hi-fi?

---
Hey, the Beaulo event
---
Casual is terrible that's were all the Smurfs live and people who are diamond or plat Cole to sweat there ass off you are better playing off ranked. Casual is the new ranked it's been that way for awhile.
---
It wouldn’t make sense for jackal with the nerf example you gave but it’s the same reason people ban cav blitz and lesion they don’t want to figure out how to play them jackal actually has the lowest win delta for attackers just saying
---
It is from the boys
---
Distance got super nerfed/s good read though, I really enjoyed it
---
Welcome to siege
---
Hey bb i got the book to
---
Intel, or ryzen?
---
He didn’t say it isn’t toxic-he said it isn’t as toxic as people make it out to be. 
---

---
That means-yes, it’s toxic BUT it’s not as bad as most people think it is.
---
did you get linux on switch
---
Same. 
---
My friends are pretty much the most toxic people I’ve met. 
---
There’s some toxic assholes in Casual and some Smurfs that tbag the shit out of you but it’s not as bad as new players think it’s going to be.
---
I thought that data was before the buff. I guess I need to check that part again later
---
This is a first time for us lol. Weird, not too sure.
---
I understand, but the defender this time is making a choice, a risky one, where they have the potential to be scanned based on what they choose to do
---
Just a little peek
---
Wow, this is as fucked up as slipknot
---
It's time for a buff. I totally agree with you, I love the book. (More than some people, it was being used as a doorstop at my local library)
---
Android so kind of yes
---
How to get worse than a console version?

I'll try some terrorist hunt with those setting holy cow but I'll do my best!
---
First off why tf do you care in terrorist hunt, it’s an easy way to afk renoun farm, let’s say ur on vacation just leave ur pc on and do that then you’ll be pretty happy when you come back.
---
I love how those 2 rappel down at almost the same time, just to get shot out like birds
---
No they don't, money does. I'd never have taken that guy hostage in the bank if I wasn't broke as fuck!
---
Shoots five bullets out of eighty count drum mag
---
Swaps to secondary
---
Once monty is close, he *should* win these every time. Smack clash, shoot the feet, if she pulls her gun just put the shield back up. Its like a dance, except its deadly and clash loses.
---
Only time clash can win this scenario is if the monty plays nervous and doesn’t push, letting her slowly tase him to death.
---
No, not really being at a disadvantage and still dunking on shitters is what keeps people up at night
---
Was just messing about with friends in customs when I remembered you can shoot through the windows on the plane. Had no idea how this shot worked...
---
Also, lag spikes.
---
Thanks man appreciate that a lot, for anyone else who might see this, feel free to just join the discord and message me personally with any questions you might have about siege :)

Yes

You fired 2 shots

Never seen it spelled like that before

🤔🤔🤔
---
Yes, you never can trust Cav.
---
It seems a little faint on the OP Photo, is it as vibrant as it is in game then real life?
---
I know.
---
They don't need to. Just as long as you're not practically across the map, you're susceptible to a pinch. Even if you manage to get into obj, if they have anyone roam clearing or something (Probably jackal) they would be able to shoot you from below if there's a destructible floor. And that's not even including the fact he has the second-best AR in the game.
---
If you have a bad game take a break watch a YouTube video or grab a snack. Cool off then go back in clear. Also wait in between matches a few minutes to make sure you play new people. Keeps it interesting. Most importantly have fun with it and your friends. Do a spawn peek, play tachanka ect. Just what I do generally and I can play all night. If I super sweat I'm burnt in like two or three hours.
---
Not sure about that, but I'll take your word on it for now.
---
dont even know where to begin to tell you how wrong you are, go read a book
---
Jäger needs an ACOG. Its his gadget.
---
They won't be buffing lion anytime soon, until they get at least 2 seasons worth of days. I get why you are asking for it, since he's the only attacker other than cap to not have breaches, but they won't take that decision now.
---
I consider sweating just playing it like ranked. Doing your normal ranked strats in casual and just generally trying too hard to win. I don’t care about angles and spawnpeeks or whatnot. Now as for the ranks your mentioned, anything below Plat 2 is garbage. That’s not even an opinion that’s just fact. Over 80% of the player base is gold or lower, and over 90% of the player base is Plat 3 or lower. Gold and Plat 3 are not high skill by any means considering 65% of the player base is Plat 3 and gold. High skill is Plat 2+. Only about 6% of players are ranked above Plat 3. There are more plat 3s than all higher ranks combined. You see where I’m going with this?
---
r/rainbowsixdadjokes
---
Idk just because lion’s gadget only works if they move
---
Fookin’ Tuberculous
---
Lol no, I was watching Matimio’s sunday mailbox where he was talking about an operator who could passively detect enemies who run outside. I thought it was stupid and thought of something similar but a lot better
---
Different timers mate. As a defender you should deny the plant anyway.
---
Cause the bomb is defused when its defused
---
I don't get the other one tho
---
Really?
---
If the guy typed UwU immediately after it was me. I do that shit anytime I'm on house.
---
It is kind of faint but that is because of how I photoshopped it. Regardless I still love it!
---
\&gt;_&lt; 
---
 An UwU has been identified! That makes 3031 UwUs in the last 48 days! 
---
 ^(Blep. Blop. I am a bot!)
---
Because the defuser has completed it’s defusal cycle. The objective has been nullified. The defenders have failed regardless of whetherthey killed the opfor or not.
---
Never actually heard of roam clearing (assume jsut some guy checking each room for potentially roaming defenders) but if I am correct sounds like a standard approach to a match. And pdw or c7e? Wait what's the best? 
---
Curious to how you just came across this month old post. Did that sound like an odd question...
---
I have to agree. Mute is easily the most underrated op in the entire game. Because it surprisingly good counter to hibana
---
Shields are so underpowered what you mean nerf
---
Shields arent op your just bad and are mad that a good shield player killed you
---
Was my comment dumb sure. But not as stupid as wanting death match in R6. Look I’m sorry if I upset you. But the whole damn point of siege is learning how to use your operator for the betterment of your team and learning how to counteract the operators on the other team while engaging in semi tactical firefights. It’s about strategy, map understanding, communication, and accuses you in FPS. Drop in a death Amy here and the suspense of only having one life is totally gone as is the meta of every operator. So yes I’m going to adamantly defend how the game is designed. If you desire a semi tactical FPS with death match I suggest SQUAD or Insurgency Sandstorm
---
No, sorry if it looks like I meant it that way. I mean that shields are usually banned when i play ranked, and I see that there are a lot of people complaining about it, so i tried to make a solution. Sorry, this is my first post on here

One word. Consoles.
---
It most likely has to do with most people overlooking his usefulness to counter lots of ops and just see him as the guy who mutes walls and drones so they pick bandit or laid to bandit trick or deny drones entry with kaid
---
Yes UwU
---
Don’t do the MP7 like that
---
It’s mostly because other ops are more needed then him on most sites, but the sites that he is good on shows how good of an op he can be.
---
?
---
he two shots theres no way you can make it his primary weapon without basically overhauling the balance
---
Hereford was a rework...and what about Outback, Villa,Skyscraper etc.
---
Come again

Thanks for the info, this needs to make it to hot.

This is terrifying

Yes if I put this on r6 fix it’ll never be noticed. I don’t care about karma I just want ubi to fix it.
---
go with ela, you’ll have much better shotgun. Her smg do take lots of time to learn, but it fine on me. Somehow I see people with visual blind spot if you put grtmoz mine on the half of the stairs, where you just land your mine flat on the ground next to the handle.

Maverick, my partner plays him and has a lot of fun

no

Then that’s is exactly maverick. I’d say maverick is better than Dokk. Better guns, more important role for the team, and being a three speed is always nice.

The sad thing is this isn't even that unusual. We played FIVE (5) straight games where the average MMR of the enemy team was 1-2K above ours.

I don't really even understand why your even mad. You stood behind a soft wall at the most common wallbang spot on the map. You asked for that

Yeah, my brother just got ddos'd from a casual match after they tk'd him and invited him to a party

I’m sooooo tired of seeing people complain about matchmaking
---
Now you know my life. I play on an HP laptop all the time.
---
I feel for you man.
---
That’s how it has always been. People boost and you’re unranked so it usually bases it off previous rank. Also, the plat  didn’t get on top so I wouldn’t be too concerned.
---
(REDACTED)
---
When I first started I thought Monty was trash. Now that I slightly understand how to play Monty, it’s fun distracting the enemy team while someone on your team sneaks up behind. Also getting cheeky kills when they turn and are distracted.
---
All that's important is the facial resemblance.
---
Concept up
---
Happy cake day mate!
---
silver 2 i think? i honestly dont remember anymore haha
---
You ever notice how a lot of the smurfs are really good? It's cause they are all the plat 1s and diamonds who are sick of giving it their all because of they don't give it 110% of their skill all the time they lose
---
so much no. low skill ceiling &amp; high reward &amp; we don't need anymore trap operators.
---
Especially since you need just 3 round in casual. Most people will be surprised and unprepared by a spawn peeking/ rushing team.
---
I am quite possibly the opposite of you.  I can get aces and just do super good when I am not with friends.  Then again most of my friends don't really care about being good at this game, they play it more for the memes.
---
I just have one because my dad messed up my main acc.☹️
---
I'm kinda salty about that movie. There where some branding fights over the Tom Clancy characters when he died, and Paramount had a hard on for Clark cause they wanted to make a movie about him, but never did. Then Amazon makes the jack Ryan TV show (which I personally like a lot) they couldn't use Clark's character cause of Paramount. And now they're finally making the John Clark movie.
---
This just happened to me
---
walter also used thermite to break in &amp; steal methylamine
---
I played with this guy in my team yesterday

He’s a console player

Gotta love cas

He looks so much like Commissioner Gordan
---
I have an alt account as well but I haven't used it yet, my intention is to learn the game and everything and then approach the game with my knowledge with the alt so my stats aren't dog shit, lol

deagle kills in 2 shots with very little recoil, you can fire those 2 shots in less than a second. And you're saying getting killed by a secondary that quickly is okay? Pistols having less recoil than automatics make them easier to get follow up shots so actually not as hard to use as ARs or SMGs. 
---
Secondaries should be nowhere near as strong as primaries lol.
---
Also if you take into account the realism aspect of it if you tried shooting as quick as you can irl with a pistol youd blow your wrist out and have literally 0 accuracy.
---
Worked cheers mate
---
absolutely not. recruit brings absolutely nothing to the team. he’s never viable over an operator. if you’re going to play ranked, the serious game mode, pick someone who helps the team.
---
sadly due to engine limitations from what I gather. so it wouldn't tank performance.
---
Boy do I have a game for you. It's called ground branch and it's from the original designer of a large portion of the first two games.

Is this the Rainbow Six book that starts with a hostage situation in Spain? The whole poison the population in Sydney during the Olympics?
---
Well that’s your opinion I guess. Literally anybody else will tell you what I just said. It’s an interesting topic but ultimately it’s not a change that is needed or ever will be needed anytime soon. So I guess I’ll just agree to disagree.
---
Defence top 5 for new players imo would be
---
1. Rook (Easy to use and pick up, good guns [P90 and MP5 are both solid, if you’re into shotguns, maybe not the best shotgun but still good at opening sightlines], and is always useful)
---
2. Kapkan (Again easy to use and pick up, easy recoil management on the smg, and also an ok pick for if you want to start trying to roam)
---
3. Jager (Gun is amazing with manageable recoil, useful in general. Also good for learning to roam.)
---
4. Frost (Almost no recoil at all on her gun, and her ability is also really good - dump them under windows or around corners. Again a good choice for learning how to roam, but plays well as an anchor too.)
---
5. Kaid (Shotgun is broken. Requires decent aim, but gadget is good.)
---
this is good for on the go. cuz you can be like i got a ace going 150 mph
---
Playing against papers I see, nice.
---
The God himself is there. Nice
---
Didnt that weapon got 2 nerfs now?
---
I honestly thought it was 1 of those cats at random. Until I saw that tiny ass charm by the letter B.
---
Biggest question is y r actually queuing t hunt
---
[removed]
---
When makarov says no Russian hes referring to everyone to not speak a word of Russian not referring to kill all the Russians like many people think, because he wants the world to think the attack was from Americans (also why he left pvt Allen's body there at the end as he was a spy for general Shepard getting into Makarovs organization and makarov knew they would find out hes an American)
---
No, I don't want useless voicelines. Makes harder to hear footsteps and other useful sounds.
---
Probably because most clips are console players filming a television screen
---
Let me get yo...uuuuuuuuuu
---
i got sweat in my eyes from watching this
---
If you let alibe holograms change skins it would be a huge buff for her in the current state because of the same outfit you can recognize its alibi then you are thinking it is a hologram or not. But if they change it you can’t realize the operator easly so you will shoot most of the time. For an example proleague sets are so similar to eachother and there is a proleague alibi. So it will confuse players too much.
---
Here is the real reason why they are not changing the skin of alibi. They are waiting to release elite set for her :)
---
Because everyone does solo because queuing with people is a mess
---
500 meters away yet he can’t see any heartbeat upstairs unless it’s in the corner of the monitor.
---
GAME WINNING
---
Good job from you but that was some pretty shit defending
---
No, blackbeard can take a headshot and survive, DMRs with an angled grip have basically no recoil , a blackbeard being able to ads almost instantly with a DMR would be overpowered
---
Go watch coconut brah on yt.By looking at a specific angle at behind the short wall in lockers(where attackers try to push in from(ya know the walls where hard breachers open up at 2nd floor))you can vault on the small ledge and climb up and continue to vault through the lockers and plant there.To defuse, the defenders have to do the same thing cuz they cant reach it from down there.Not much people use it because its quite difficult to pull off in an actual match
---
It's casual starts at 3:15
---
These voicelines would only be at the beginning of the round. Also they'd be fairly infrequent and only one op would talk at a time. Maybe there could be an option to disable these voicelines for pros or people that don't want it.
---
Wait... what.

These voice lines are at the beginning of a round/prep phase , how would they make it harder to hear other sounds?
---
ranked is a serious game because siege is a competitive shooter. that’s why there’s a rank and reward system. if you want to play for fun and mess around then go play casual or another game.

Where did you read that she got in problems?

Btw, the defender will be an area denial with fire, like smoke. The attacker has a grappling hook that will grant him mobility through hatches, faster rappelling, etc.
---
Alibi isnt neceseraly op or played often. Also, i would like to use the legendary headgear i got for her from the cowboy event.

It also fits with their new theme of naming the seasons; Each word describes the two ops.

- Phantom was Nokk

- Sight was Warden

Ember Rise
---
- Ember is fire shield

I mean, since you cant see the full face but only the eyes and beard, it does look like BlackBeard
---
I can only guess there is finka THE LORD vigil and frost i cant guess who the others are

Cool must feel good about ya self don’t ya talking shit on reddit lmfao

[This taught me how to trace](https://youtu.be/0LADw_gBQJI)
---
Thanks!
---
I enjoyed that, good improvisation
---
I mean so do I lmao I work 75 hour weeks ;)
---
Nice! I’m hoping to improve a lot.
---
nah i’m just joking that was good tho i tried to use CAMRS on Buck and i messed up so bad so i decided to do C8 holo and i’m like a copper 😂 good one mate
---
Cav, monty
---
Yea exactly most people don’t solo queue up in plat usually 3-5 stacks
---
Can you read?
---
I’m thinking or learning that next :)
---
Only reason why I posted it was cause it was with the CAMRS dmrs in this game are ridiculous sometimes
---
same lol. wanted to see in comment section if anyone thinks the same
---
You've not given a coherent reason
---
Wait guys what headgear am i wea-*dink*
---
Matches:2
---
And Fuze from Uzbekistan.
---
*sad evil eye noises*
---
lmao did he just say maestro and capitoa arent usefull for the team?
---
I think so
---
monty got the melee nerf ...i only use him for a plant in intel honesty
---
Yeah and communicating with my team mates if super fun then right? The only way to have advantage is to aggressively push. If you even attempt to hold an angle and they push they will see you first.
---
What about Monty being really fucking good? Just all the time
---
Dang :/ I guess I should get myself one.
---
lol thats true once sombody in my was was ela and we tkd her
---
Count slabula is my gt. We’ve been on a copper journey too
---
So what you are saying is that if my account gets hacked and I changed the password and make it so that the hacker can't get on my account anymore i still cannot get unbanned what kind of bs is that
---
You’re second OP would replace Ela, make her pointless
---
umm he only really has 2 counters and if you fuck it up you will pay...3 counters i mean lesion, echo, and a c4
---
Life of a bronze
---
I think some players want to play ela if that happens.
---
Yeah, the melee Nerf was pretty strong, it changed him complete
---
Legit yesterday friend lol

---
&gt;Not to mention most EU kids that play over here are higher ranks then they are playing in here because we have 3 rank divisions.
---
People should be able to climb different ladders as long as they're not deranking.
---
And smoke, but c4 is the only actual reliable counter. Monty is a more powerful otp because of the pick ban system, lesion,echo, blitz,jackal
---
honesty...i dont understand why they did that nerf
---
I mean its definitely worth it for not just online games. 
---
If you're looking into a good quality, inexpensive VPN I'd reccomend avast secureline. I've always used that and it's been pretty solid. (Not selling out or anything it's just a genuinely good VPN lol)
---
Jackal is a garbage op overall. Only thing that’s decent is his gun , smoke, and budget buck shotgun. 
---
His ability is ass. It doesn’t ping constantly. Only people who ban jackal are shitters and stoners with anxiety problems. They think they are gonna get wallbanged or something so they panick and do something stupid. Better ban would be thatcher, monty, nomad or twitch. Those are the bans i see when i play ranked (diamond pc)
---
Im confused. Are the operators from siege in r6 books?
---
i forgot about smoke lamo
---
I just felt bad for a gadget
---
I'm old enough to remember this...nice baiting, Mr T!
---
Mira is in a good place now. Her gadget is one of the strongest in the game, that's why she's in the little ban-triangle with Maestro and Echo in Pro League (try watching the first few matches of the Raleigh Major later today). Giving her an ACOG is just boosting an already strong operator. And since you mostly burst fire with the Vector, which doesn't give that much recoil, it would make her a must-ban on high level. And let's not forget that every recoil pattern can be mastered.
---
The best is when you're attacking and get ddos'd and then with 20 seconds left you can move but there's no time to even get to objective. Then on defense the enemies aim is to plant asap and ddos again so you have no chance to defuse. If they fail then they ddos the full server so the game kicks everyone out.

#REPOST

Does shoes get jammed by Mute's jammer ?
---
These look amazing! How did you make these? I wanna make a few based off my mains
---
I was just making a joke like how people usually say others are hacking in these types of clips
---
What do you mean her guns aren't the best, the ARX is literally the 4th best weapon in terms of dps output. Even better than the R4C and hibana's type 89
---
damn . beat me to it
---
Me at play 1 jackel still gets banned 90% of the time
---
I mean some how Cavs sneaky feet do
---
I demand cat pics!
---
can we all agree clash is aids
---
Similar to Agent 47 actually
---
Typo but your solution is also fine. 😀
---
Platinum 3
---
Ty. :)
---
Side button on your mouse works great if you're not comfortable on a keyboard yet, otherwise I would recommend maybe binding 2 buttons to melee and see which works beter for you. I used to use Mouse 4 for melee, but have since switched to using V and B for melee since my thumb rest right in between both on the spacebar. That way if I happen to miss one the other is right next door lol

As someone who has never played this game what am I supposed to be looking at here?
---
I dont think it's the anniversary skin
---
Pro tip: you can press Q and E to lean
---
Would pay🌚
---
Which birthday skin? Who is using it?
---
If you’re an anchor go like Doc or lesion. Lesion is great especially in late rounds
---
 it’ll be fixed next season so no worries. just do your best
---
no player facing changes

I can't believe you've done this.

True

Vigil’s gadget does nothing to prevent his feet from being scanned....
---
Vigil’s gadget cloaks him from a drone (camera) scan of the map when Lion’s gadget goes off
---
Simple to understand really
---
it is, i just checked. and it would make sense why the shots werent hitting because his shield is meant to be there. must be a glitch or something

---
!!! My first black ice got removed within 5 minutes

Oof, I’m plat EU which took some work. But in NA Me and my friend got plat 3 in a couple of sittings. And then helped someone place plat in NA. 
---
I hands down believe NA is easier. So much that I play on them servers more than EU. If I get one more Romanian yelling at me on vc I’ll legit leave EU for good 😂
---
You are the cancer killing this game. Fact.
---
u can play ranked at level 30
---
I use the hyper x cloud core

And so we see the dividing lines of the inevitable race war between consoles. Whilst pc watches from high above in their golden castles of blackjack and hookers.

Bruh pc is a different story lmao. Most you eu people play pc which is why console over there is weak
---
You just had to pop into the corner of his screen before haha
---
Øk
---
It is the same size as an Airjabs AoE (roughly double a Mute). This way, it can penetrate one surface, not multiple. 
---
The penetration is important I think. It adds a skill curve, because you will not get any decent impact from lobbing it in a room mostly. The fact you can make little pockets of silence is great and this helps achieve this. Plus we really haven’t seen this at all. Promoting vertical play is important and obviously a positive. I get the worry though. 
---
It may be too strong but it needs testing. I honestly feel it would be ok overall, as it’s not a stun or a disable of any sort, just a deafen. 
---
Thanks for the feedback 👍
---
oh based on this clip im going to guess your rank ok ..... maybe silver bronze1-silver4??
---
&gt; just
---
Ha
---
PL=Pro League.  They play on a reduced map pool of only the most balanced maps.
---
so the point if this video is to show an incredibly routine kill?
---
Why is your sensitivity -400
---
Or maybe the toxic community that keeps complaining avout everything.Or is it the hackers which ubisoft doesnt really care.Oooooor maybe its the lack of development in the game which makes it stale and boring?Nah its just people like you.Fun killers that doesnt have friends so they tryhard each casual game instead of having fun
---
Oh never touched console R6. But it wouldn’t surprise me if Console EU is easy.
---
but how will she wear a scarf if she doesn't have a head anyway
---
You know you didn’t have to run back and get it right?
---
Ranked's stakes are too high and is constantly unfairly abused, making the matches less fun. Plus the time commitment is much longer. I'd rather just go for a quick match in casual with some dudes with potato aim who are just looking to have fun
---
It's certainly been the least interesting. Only thing keeping things fresh was dealing with all the exploiters and cheaters...
---
If mods cared a tad bit they would have done this a long time ago.
---
Yes he did it’s in the rules

Fæn (Translate into Norwegian)
---
Yeah, a few people are saying similar things. I said I *personally* don't know anyone that plays casual. I'm sure there are plenty of you guys, the point is the complete tards this guy was playing against are either copper/bronze or their just people that aren't good at the game playing casual. Idc if you guys play casual, have fun however you want, but the point about the competition stands
---
&gt;There you are
---
Hereford (NEW) is so unbalanced in favor to defenders. I wish we could have old one back. It wasnt perfect but it was much better imho.
---
Pro smurf
---
Everybody else did. So the defence setup was in shambles.
---
Fair enough
---
I am open to suggestion about the mouse I wanna get a new one a better one and I have astro A10
---
Lol, "variety of skins". This games skins have very little variety, but it probably would still cause tons of bugs.
---
My girlfriend have the elite version and am not a fan of it to be honest
---
Yes. It will limit you. You won’t feel held back because you’ve never tried 144hz, but once you get a higher hz monitor, you’ll never want to go back to 60hz. A 144hz monitor is a great investment if you have a beefy pc.
---
how long yall play to get this good?
---
The MMR reduction or addition is based on having a chester in a match, not based on team.
---
Basically if one guy out of the 10 players in a match cheated and got banned, this match never happened basically, so whoever lost mmr will gain it back, and vice versa.
---
I wanna see this from his POV
---
oh thats cool i’m in germany
---
I don’t like gel around my ears....

---
I had a 2004 5.7 too! It had the bigger back door than yours, though from what you said. Nostalgia!
---
1 tap...... it is not.
---
The point is putting seasonals in alpha packs is bullshit. Either you were there or you were not.
---
Everybody has a black ice skin these days. And you are telling me it's not affecting the rarity?
---
I’d say yes but I feel like it would either be worthless or extremely overpowered. Idk how it could be balanced.
---
No

I never knew that. Thanks bullshit.

Hmmm what a coincidence
---
U dont like fabric and cushion that feels like gel
---
is a 1.3kd for someone who has played pc only for 2 days average?
---
also ive vsed mostly plats and high golds during this time
---
The worst idea I’ve ever seen in my life
---
Casual has it's own ELO system. They used ranked ELO to matchmake people for 1 season and everybody on this subreddit lost their shit and complained about, so they changed it back to its own MMR.
---
While all this is true a lot of siege is split second choices and often people will still shoot a previously shot holo
---
The player base is plenty large (larger than most games).  And you wouldn't really have to split it--just pick the map first then populate it from those who have that map in their pool.  The impact should be minimal on most maps.  And even on less popular maps, the longer matchmaking times might well be offset by not having players leave immediately.
---
That leaving isn't punished has other positive effects.  It means you can try to play with a less than perfect connection, squeeze in one more match, and that you don't have to wait (often for an extended period) for friends to join.  Casual is a casual experience intentionally--where people can warm up, or play without worrying about winning, or try out new things.  If you are that worried about winning, you should be in ranked instead of casual.  Casual fills an important niche and being able to drop in and out freely helps with that.
---
&gt;ash main
---
You lack self awareness lmao
---
Interesting idea but do you really want to shoot a dog
---
I bet ur fun at parties
---
ok
---
No. 
---
He can only zap electronics.
---
Castle is a good defender at Plat and higher ranks where your utility matters.  Casual and most ranks below Plat he's useless because no one cares if they waste their zofia/ash/breach on the barricades and it only takes a few seconds to punch them down.
---
He just needs a slight buff to his barricades, I'm just not sure what it would be that would prevent him from being too overpowered.
---
Yea I honestly don’t know just throwing it out there
---
They should emulate rocket league. I was D2 in 2's and one of my club mates hadn't even done his placements. We only played people that were my rank. It prevented uneven matchmaking which was cool with us. I am currently in D3 and he is D1, so now we are playing against people D3 and D2.
---
*Say goodnight, Gracie*
---
i am asking for help not your idea
---
No :(
---
Like you can do better.
---
YES PLEASE
---
if you do not want to help then shut up
---
Modern Warfare intensifies
---
It’s not a one tap if you pull the trigger more than once
---
I'm not sure if you're too lucky or too unlucky...
---
A grapple for the attacker yes a grapple that goes faster and can go up hatches an is in gun form while the defender has a deployable shield when like a Mira is popped deploys fire everywhere or when destroyed
---
Who tf has ever put gel on their ears..
---
No silly
---
Seems strange to go with Castle at all tbh.  He's certainly one of the weakest defenders don't get me wrong but Warden is a dumpster fire.  At least Castle can force the attackers to use some utility most of the time.
---
No you’re fun at parties!
---
Honestly, the very first step would just be find out what mother board you have. That determines what parts you can put in. For example if you have like a decent x470 board, you could use one of the brand new CPUs and be set almost. You also need to know how much RAM your current motherboard can handle. I would google this for you, but these pre-built versions don't all have the same components.
---
I don't really have a problem with it IF they are playing the same in both regions.  I wouldn't even consider that smurfing, just cross-region play.
---
You can only play ranked with players within X mmr of yours
---
I just joined the sub
---
Gameplay wise next level you would definately shredd on pc
---
Did you get air jabbed through the wall
---
Rainbow six for you
---
Doing same as camera ooga boog
---
K my yt is Kuma Kenzie
---
Buddy. What?
---
My actual guess is that the first player to join the match is put on attack.  This seems plausible, since you would tend to think it would be random.  And it would be random if tested with everyone on low/no ping.  IF that is the case AND ping effects how quickly you connect, players with low ping would tend to start on defense more often (possibly much more often, depending on how low their ping is).
---
In soviet Russia the text reads you
---
Those mics and background sounds would kill me instant.
---
Realistically, both yes and no.  As someone else said, since you have never played abobe 60hz you wont be limited compared to yourself now.  Also,  the game itself only runs at 50ish hz so the only advantage you will see over that is purely on your side.  The most major thing you will notice is the smoothness of the game.  Although the game itself is not processing it, you will process the game in a much higher frame rate and as such you may see people a few frams earlier.  Unfortunstely along with this, you will likely encounter a situation where you hit a clean shot that either doesnt register or registers as a trade due to frame and lag differences.
---
The bottom line is, there is a legitimate reason why pros use at least 144hz moniters HOWEVER it is not the defining feature to "gitting gud".
---
Personal allegory for if you do get a monitor.  I have a friend who purchased a "cheap" 144hz monitor but forgot/didnt know that you have to changed the monitor settings in windows to allow (dont know if this is the right verbage) the monitor to actually run at 144hz.  He played go4s peetty competitively and reached diamond on siege all at 60 hz and didnt notice a difference until someone else was joking about struggling with their monitor settings not saving the 144hz selection.
---
Nice ace
---
Still mad at this. Give Nokk real guns, she's so bad at the moment...
---
I think Clash can be insane even in lower rank games. She’s consistently banned because no one wants to deal with her. It’s not as easy as “pick Ash” or something because you are exposed trying to explode stuff on her.
---
I think Warden’s problem is just that Smokes are already “balanced” in the game. There are already several ways to counter them and they only get two. Warden would only be good in a pre-nerf Blitz/Ying/Glaz world. Except we aren’t in that world because they are already (rightfully) nerfed. That said being flashed is STILL powerful. So I propose they do something to make his gadget somehow useful to the rest of the team. I know we don’t want globals so maybe just some AOE. And give it a limit.
---
You can't make it more random than 50/50 chances with two teams... you can look at it as it being sided towards blue but for other people they get significantly more orange. It's just a coin flip and you happen to get heads more then tails. 
---
_
---
No way to make it "more random," if anything you're asking for a stop gate of "if x player gets x more blue than orange, give an orange" which is the opposite of randomizing"
---
Exactly
---
Chess not checkers
---
There is no difference u buy it on one u get it in the other
---
This is what ash mains do best tho

Ubisoft mmr in a nut shell:

Ubisoft: "Well they are both 15"
---
i hope not, but if they do, i hope they give them at least a better weapons, unlike nokk and warden which is the underwhelming weapons in the game.
---
I subbed
---
warden is worse tho :(
---
Honestly I have no idea why they made an entirely new map, some simple rotation fixes as well as room cover /accessibility and it would have been fine, they needed a map buff like Kafe or Clubhouse, not a replacement
---
Magic Rook!

Don't think that's the way it works

When your team dosen't bring iq.
---
Ebic content
---
yeah in a world where Alibi can hide behind a hologram and not get flashed just makes him even more pointless.
---
however they buff Warden, its not gona be for the entire team, esports hates global gadgets, however i can see Warden get better weapons and maybe even a 2-2 speed/armor change.
---
 i think thats enough to bring him forward and be a viable pick because right now he is badly needing something to lift him up.
---
UW?
---
1. All new players get 2500 MMR at the start, next season it calculates and places them higher or lower than that based on the rank at the end.
---
2. No idea. The whole system is in big trouble right now, and somehow coppers can matchmake in party with diamonds.
---
3. Its best to find some players that are close to your skill level and try to 5 queue. If You Play enough you will know if you are too high or too low on bracket, you will see how much you REALLY communicate or/and get kills, and use your gamesense. And always learn from the enemy team, not yours.
---
He was last season. This season was supposed to be Lesion (Which we already have) and Smoke.
---
When your crush calls but you gotta kill an ash.
---
Honestly this game is super 50/50 with matchmaking all around... you'll constantly ping pong back and fourth between playing team that are pretty much 5th graders and then next you'll play against super computers who never miss a shot and somehow always know exactly where you are at.
---
Yackity sacks needs to be playing on this
---
If they DID have an attack dog operator, it should instantly start rushing towards the nearest defender. Kinda used as an intel gadget.
---
:3
---
No, it's not it looks really good I would use it 10/10
---
ohhhh yikes toxic community

Hardly even qualified for that post-Raven Shield. Both Vegas games were more or less arcade shooters with very light tactics mixed in. 
---
We're a far cry away from planning routes/waypoints on maps in the beginning of missions and whatnot.

I think you got the top five but wrong order

I'd say: jackal, lesion, Mira, zofia, vigil

---
Try doing what most folks do in Ranked DDOS there ass or do what I do and quit the game it is shit now
---
I haven’t played Vigil and all other are great, but I will put Dokkaebi instead of Mira, because I like playing her and she’s funnier to use than Mira
---
Read in Jager's voice, here's an upvote
---
That doesn't seem creative enough. Have one operator with three mini trophy systems, and a new one with just one big one? Kind of underwhelming.
---
it does but microsofts report system doesn’t work unless its voice communication. you have to report it here : https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Games/2559

That drone will prevail on the loop de loop and all other drones will bow before their new mechanical god

Vigil has entered the chat
---
With a reply like that you may not cheat but you sure come across as what some consider toxic. Grow up son it is just a game with fake digital points that in the end nobody cares if you have diamond or any rank for that matter.
---
Thanks I’ll report it there
---
Same as kaid and bandit, same function just reworked
---
lmao
---
I have warden.
---
Oh
---
I decided to buy an alpha pack with the renown from this and got a fucking common. Legit want to kermit
---
Maestro: bruh sound effect #2
---
I don't have warden
---
I like how the Darkish Red goes with the Black and Grey.
---
If they do, and depending on how shit the reused ones are, itll settle the debate for me coming back to the game or not.
---
I played the first 2 days of the season and quit cause it got boring and even worse that the new ops have reused weapons, not to mention nokks one which is utter garbage. A subpar smg on DEF now on OFF.
---
this is three months late, but yes. if it's in prep phase, then yes, even one kill should kick you. i know, you can accidentally TK when shooting drones, but that is both uncommon, and due to people being idiots.
---
when you about to jizz and your knees get weak (keep rewinding to 3.57)
---
Nokk isn't the only one that came come from the waters.
---
He didn’t move an inch, I think he knew what was gonna happen
---
Probably would on pc but fuck console amirite
---
Den why aww uwu a wawden main?
---
I think the guy in the pic above is the only trustworthy leaker recently and I don't think he's said anything about finka's weapons has he? I might have missed something
---
Oh , well shit lmao didn't realize cause I couldn't see my phone very well
---
Okay to add on to that you have to actually practice the physics of frags. It’s the same trajectory as throwing your drones. You have four seconds. Sometimes you want to cook it. Practice practice practice. Don’t just “use frags” because they’re good, because you can easily kill your teammates if you’re clueless. Throwing a frag in the drone hole also is significantly easier if you do not prone and just aim at the floor very slightly ahead of the drone hole.
---
Many people get to fucking Ranked and still have no clue how to use frags.
---
This is sad
---
Suicide
---
they (Ubi) Normally give(I think for free) the elite skins to the folks who play in majors. it helps show off the new skins. before they are in the game for teh rest of us.
---
Ohhhh I gotcha. I dont post on this sub, just lurk lol so I didnt know. But that is super scummy
---
Shes belarussian
---
lol
---
I’m not going to keep arguing over this. It IS NOT a fucking weapon stock. He’s holding the ice pick from the top, where you “pick” at shit, and then the handle is going downward to the ground. How are you going to tell me it’s a fucking gun when the part he’s holding going downward is maybe 2 inches wide. It’s not a fucking gun. It’s an ice pick. He is holding the ice pick by the top. It LOOKS like a gun stock. Zoom in on the pic and you clearly see the fucking grip for the ice pick and the little ball that’s on the side of them for whatever reason
---
They certainly don't address MMR Roll back, and Ddoss'ing on console which plagues ranked play. They should definitely address both of those issues
---
Garbage.
---
Yep.
---
I'm gonna say what I say every time this is posted; It's fake. Take a look at the linework, specifically the black outlines making up the contour of the pick, and it should be clear that the art style of this icon is completely different from every single other operator icon in the game.
---
Oh, it is from unofficial Polish one:  [https://www.facebook.com/unOfficialR6Polska/photos/p.2371648136485410/2371648136485410/?type=1&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/unOfficialR6Polska/photos/p.2371648136485410/2371648136485410/?type=1&amp;theater)
---
Lol. I’ve never touch my sensitivity, so you’re probably right
---
I hate elite skins, am I the only one?
---
That's an understatement.
---
what makes it even more boring is the fact that there will be no new map at all for this year, and they decided to give the new operators a recycled weapon is just make it worse, not forget to mention nokk and warden gadgets are too similiar to what we already have in the game right now. I hope this season wont be like the last one.
---
This happened to me before in clubhouse...
---
This is actually very helpful, once I get a pc I’ll be doing this, here’s the upvote
---
I know, but I just don’t like playing Mira and Dokkaebi is great with coordinated team.
---
The title is perfect for this
---
Yea
---
Look at year 3 and 4s newest operators, their picture card was being shaped differently as well. It’s just their design. It’s not fake and you’ll see by the end of this week
---
Your bullets not going where your reticle is, how is that any good
---
MMR rollback was invented to combat hackers which is only present on PC, and they have addressed the Dossing for both platforms and it’s simply not an issue that can be fixed easily as it would require Microsoft to take action considering they are the ones that own the Microsoft Azure servers that Siege is ran on for all platforms.
---
So?
---
Lag 1000
---
I think we are going to have Atleast 2 new guns in total since Ubisoft saw all the outrage
---
Reflex and holo are equals, those two all come down to preference
---
Reflex has a smaller housing, holo’s reticle is just a tiny dot in the center 
---
Red dot is worse than both though
---
I'm pretty sure they just did maintenance on the servers.
---
So it's very obviously fanmade?
---
its the same artwork and its the 556 gun stock
---
Kinda crazy the book's main plot revolves around Climate Change, and here we are 21 years later.
---
Definitely matched with the attacker leak we’ve got, with the grappling hook, and sieges art style
---
taking care of the regular siege multiplayer is already enough work for the team I'd imagine
---
some things just need to take priority and I'm sure terrorist hunt is statistically played much less than the regular multiplayer, it's better without randoms anyway
---
Look at the light blue glow around the icon when he touches on the icon
---
You mean ash
---
I have the one that matches the Hi-NRG headgear ( which I also have)
---
Microsoft and other pc operating softwares will definitely do it but Sony is a fucking ass.
---
How to kick 4 people at once??
---
Congrats
---
wat
---
Preference.
---
But tbh if you get used to aiming from the tip, then reflex becomes the downright best sight due to a simplistic housing and easy to use reticle.
---
How does the icon look very different? Look at ash or bandit, day 1 operators, their emblem card is not the same. Their borders are chopped up and broken just like irbis. This guy who leaked the pic has been leaking everything since the beginning of year 2. It’s like you guys are grasping at straws trying to tell yourselves it’s fake, yet the rumors and leaks since the last season have been THESE two operators. The reason the pic here was even found was because the guy was datamining last season and found the attackers operator icon name and his weapons. I could not possibly care if you don’t believe me but you really shouldn’t be surprised when these 2 drop
---
Ddoss'ing is "hacking" or "Cheating" there are people that even standby which is also cheating and for anyone of those there should be MMR rollbacks. I'm pretty sure there were patches for Halo 2 back in the day to stop ddoss'ing so I'm pretty sure there can be something done about it.
---
MP5SD would be enough for her tbh
---
I don't follow. How long ago are we talking about?
---
Look at the full picture from the "leak" and compare to adjacent operator icons and it's very clearly not the same art style at all
---

So I am a mercy main in Overwatch and this is the most accurate description of it ever
---
lmao, hay at less you did not have to go out and get a new one.
---
You are literally brain dead I’m done responding LOL
---
There a legendary that is a banana that worse
---
Reminds me of the classic COD video where the guy sneaks up on a sniper by crouching and pops up into his scope before blasting him with the shotty. The perspective of the dude with the sniper is fucking hilarious
---
I dont feel that another stealth op is needed at all rn
---
I love the OP's logic of "I'm just trying to have fun, why do I have to go up against diamonds, who are also just having fun, but are better than me?"
---
Reddit logic.
---
hopefully
---
IDEA OF THE CENTURY
---
Also this wouldn't be even that hard to balance
---
Sound like a speedy cav with a knife
---
Please, PLEASE no. I don’t get why people want this broken map back. Sure you may have fond memories of it but think for second just how bad it was. There was no way to roam effectively. Vertical play was almost non existent. It was extremely attacker favored and defense had no choice but to spawnpeek and runout if they wanted to have a slight chance at winning. It was not aging well with how the game was and is developing. Don’t let nostalgia blind you, people wanted Favela back but immediately remembered how bad it was and ever since wanted it removed again.
---
How come everyone I play against in casual is like the best players in the world and I never find people like this
---
Yeah no, the amount of times I've heard a dude drop and I flick to shoot them and end up clapping some copper or silver hugging my back is insane, I've genuinely apologized and they still turn on the reverse fire
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
like come on, get some ears and proper spacing before we suggest changes to reverse fire, I'm not your parent and you're not on a toddler leash lmao
---
Your laughter is contagious.
---
you're a fucking moron. you've literally been proven wrong with photo evidence i don't know how more clear we can all be. the new season teaser photo does NOT show the new operator. plain and simple lmao
---
You know, when this was released it could only be purchased in a bundle together with Buck's Poutine skin and Saint-Jean headgear and it was 50,000 renown.
---
Long shot, but try disabling your on board graphics card if you already haven't.
---
I had a problem where the game wouldn't start for WEEKS before I found out it was randomly trying to boot off the wrong GPU, and then simply closing after a few seconds without any error code.
---
*brain explosion sounds*

Hello x4EFr6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cpip2k/how_to_counter_cav_tutorial/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Fake news.

Well that's just being retarded, I mean just play the game relaxed and you'll improve your rank over time.

Pushing yourself to your absolute limit every match just ruins the fun for yourself.

Capitalism is a corrupt system run by megalomaniacs
---
But plz PUT IT IN DAMN CUSTOM GAMES FOR DUCKS SAKE
---
saving this comment to call you an idiot in a week
---
I played two games just now after a break..one with 12 and one with 10 and didn't get the charm, F's
---
Too bad recoil in this game is mostly _random_
---
I'm literally playing Rook though my usefulness drops to the Nether as soon as I put down my plates my dude
---
I mean that still is the point of it, Maverick is still meant to be a hard breacher that doesn’t alert the entire server to his position. They just increased the noise slightly.
---
Sadly no. If it will work this way buying one black ice will give you this on all guns that have this skin
---
21:9 is supported, but you need an expensive monitor and it's probably not very good for competitive gaming.
---
If you're not a competitive player with a lot of money however, go for it I guess.
---
Bruh I'm dead
---
You’ll be surprised
---
Nice ace!
---
Fair enough but I just feel like that description would give new players the idea that he’s extremely quiet and get themselves killed because they relied on the sound too much
---
Naughty.
---
How'd they not see that on their minimap? Wow. COD players are getting so much worse, I swear.
---
OP is a fool, you're completely right
---
Haha yes! A stunt drone with a turbo boost. We can race them!

There's nothing

The game is extremely difficult and almost impossible to learn without friends, you're honestly better off just playing an easier shooter and having fun in that.
---
YOU WENT NUMBER 2 ON HIS CHEST LOL
---
Did you make this?
---
Have you checked killcam? It no it probably showed peeking + prefire
---
I'm interested
---
I understand the uncertainty value, completely agree with it. However I believe there should be some sort of system that allows an ELO boost dependent on your win streak, and the same for losing streaks.
---
About time i can stop worrying about grenades
---
Nanoboost
---
Why would you even bother posting this if you're not going to give information on your computer specs and what not?
---
What have you changed in the time between the game working, and it not working any more?
---
Oof I guess ur right
---
DDOS kicked the entire enemy team by accident?
---
Yeah, no.
---
Is your only reason for using Reddit to disagree with people and shoot them down? I’m basically just a lurker of this subreddit and use it for up to date game info and news, but if I sort by new I frequently see you commenting nothing useful or beneficial, you almost seem agitated that the OP made the post to begin with, like it somehow offends you. Just wondering what your philosophy is here....
---
No need to reload
---
Yeah they’re talking about fixing the boosting thing soon
---
It’s actually the unranked players that are “screwing it up”, their ELO is higher than the silver and bronze
---
V o r e
---
Meanwhile the only alpha packs I open nowadays are commons and uncommons.
---
This is some very cool art
---
Blyatiful

Funny cause this is pc. When in console control is almost non existent
---
very nice

It's not a story Ubi would tell you...

people who can’t take the time to read the sub rules before posting should really be banned

Rainbow Alpha Packs in a nutshell..😂😅
---
Its...its magnificent
---
Why does this remind me of butters with a ninja star stuck In his eye.
---
I do NEED that attacker if it does what I think it does
---
Yea it will 60hz to 144hz is night and day
---
Oof
---
Ya but at lower  ranks it’s just easy to have a safe ban with jackal, lesion, and echo just because the skill level and awareness is low you know not for all player but for some.
---
Not. Yet.
---
r/pcmasterrace
---
I hope it isn't our last surprise before reveal
---
Yeah. Deluxe edition stuff transfers. As does anything bought in store like pro league skins and gemstone bundle. Year pass doesnt
---
Wait till you see his outline being turned then you know the interrogation starts
---
Oh so you stole something I wrote because you can't write anything filled with important information in a few sentences. Things that describe an important issue require much more space to be told on. Sorry you can't understand that. But thanks for plagiarizing my stuff.
---
The Apex servers are way worse but I guess that's what you get for free.
---
Yeah I can see that. The gun feels weird to me sometimes but it is good and having ACOG helps.
---
Do you have a certain type of controller or something? Your aim is great
---
Hostage tonight
---
I honestly don’t get it is it some glitch or just a troll
---
Youth Bible
---
I haven't really played for a couple of seasons but on ps4 they used to have matchmaking settings for ranked. You could turn off maps and game modes that you don't like
---
Pretty much xD
---
The reason they don't is because of limitations. Their engine can't handle having multiple alibi hologram skins.
---
HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHAH
---
Test
---
Hmm could be one, looks ok I suppose
---
Unbalanced or not it was fun. I don't want it in ranked but I would honestly love to see it in casual.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing more 'shit maps' like house and plane. Yeah they're unbalanced as fuck... but they're fun; that's why I play R6.
---
D A T A  L I M I T S
---
OR, we don't force the entire team to be punished because one person TK'd by accident or on purpose
---
Hell yeah, Bartlett was so much fun!
---
You uhhh
---
You might want to rethink that title my dude
---
SHIT LOL
---
luison?
---
Wait what lol
---
I've played 10 games in the past hour and only encountered one toxic person on the enemy team who TK'd
---
it's really not as common as people seem to make it out to be
---
That's so odd. You basically ask a bronze/copper level player to get stomped until they reach their "actual" rank. Whereas if you start everyone at the bottom, use a bit of unranked MMR, and then accelerate the climb for players who are outperforming their expectations (assigned by the matchmaker), add win streak bonuses etc and it would be fine. Smurfs would only get a few hours of being OP (unless they throw) and bad players would feel less pain and could be getting fun matchups.
---
Personally I use ironsight on the mp7 but I’m also very weird I suppose. I’d try it out thought it’s very good!
---
Filth
---
I wouldn't mind a pick axe, tired of the heavy and slow sledgehammer
---
Every time I see that skin, it reminds me of the Hyenas in Division 2
---
I'm Irish and play r6s. In Ireland we have the defence forces (Army, Air force and Navy), Garda Special Detectives Unit (GSDU) which are counter terrorists and finally the cream of the crop the Irish Army Rangers which are like navy seals on steroids. Any of which could be used as a CTU especially the last two.
---
The fire rises, brother
---
Probably playing cav because you can see the obj
---
see, this is why I think we should have segregation for stuff like this. If you get x penalties in x amount of time you go to a "special" server
---
How tall are you
---
Typical clash main
---
6'
---
yuck dosers on console🤢
---
I’m on ps4, I’ve only tried MnK when I was at my friends house, I liked the fact you could tilt without aiming. But it definitely felt weird because of how unnatural it is to me
---
I’ve been wanting to get a pc to play games but I don’t want to lose all my progress on the games I play, plus it’s going to be a pain to get used to MnK after about 10 years on controller
---
Wait until Pablo gets hungry for spicy food.
---
Or ya know, just turn off text chat or voice chat if it bothers you that much, kinda what the features there for, it's disgusting to hear sure but people really only do it for attention and to get a rise out of people
---
like bruh I'm low key gonna laugh when the new CoD releases since I'm hoping it returns to the MW2 lobby voice chat glory days
---
Tachanka so it would be a quick death
---
How can I get them to transfer. Thanks in advance
---
But I play on console.🥺
---
Cause baby tonight! The attackers trying to steal the bomb site!
---
Turning off maps only works in thunt, every map but barlett is in casual, ranked is built to be competitive like pro league not to have you play game modes that don't matter in the competitive scene
---
How do I get them to transfer? Thanks in advance!
---
Dang it you forgot the heads up part, start from “hostage tonight”
---
Hes not even hacking
---
Every season gets both an attacker and a defender. Exceptions are Blood Orchid and White Noise (due to Operation Health pushing a season of content back) as well as Chimera and Para Bellum (because of experimentation, which they have followed up to say they are never doing one sided content releases anymore).
---
But its ceramic...
---
Thanks! I have an Elite Controller but it doesn't really change my aim I don't think
---
That's too bad. A lot of the old maps were a lot of fun. Secure area and the occasional hostage were a lot of fun too
---
Kaid mains rise up
---
Bro that was fishy. You might get banned for nothing
