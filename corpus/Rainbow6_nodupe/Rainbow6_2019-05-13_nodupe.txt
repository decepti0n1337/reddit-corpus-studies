Well, this clearly isn't an update about the game so...
---
---
---
1.) you team killed already 
---

---
2.) if you knew you already team killed (even if accidental) why shoot right behind your teammate
---
Welp.
---
Time to teamkill everyone who does this. I should get a medal for it not bans, but oh well. Worth it to TK the cunts who do this.
---
*complains about teammates when playing with other people*
---
Is still possible to do this glitch? Few seasons ago it ruined many ranked matched but I thought it has been removed.
---
Wait... Soggy doritos is a sin...
---
not so much the spawnpeeks but the runouts when I am peeking another window are crazy. The L shape part of the lap let's defenders shoot ur back.

Wow

You do realize console and pc have way different reaction times especially when you mag dump a semi auto you‚Äôre more focused on firing faster then having your teammates walk in front of you
---
Umm no, because here's the thing buddy.  When you can't even hit anything 2ft of you, you won't get a headshot. And actually hit reg is s bitch sti it won't register anyways. And good on you for not providing any actual evidence or statement because you haven't and only go off what everyone else says about her and don't want to actually say that she is the worst roamer in the game because oh she used to be good so she should be shit more,  yeah alright pal.

Its there as a way to hide his identity in a more comp setting. Or save it from the enrmy getting armor. Its just that peoppe are children and can't handle being normal

It's a joke, but depending on where you are in the arctic that is true. In the south the ice is growing in size in the north it's melting. So it really depends on where the map is there.

I don't think the people commenting know how often console players run in front of their teammates while they are firing

This game started to go to shit once Ela was introduced, it only went downhill from there after buffing blitz, adding dokk, lion, finka, etc... I miss old siege

r6 went to shit overnight idk what happened, but a bunch of exploits like this and deployable shield heads and shield ops being able to shoot with no gun out. Stay away from ranked

throw one smoke and a trap, and the defending team will waste plant denial utility cause it'll sound and look the same as a normal plant.  then throw another smoke, 2 traps, and plant.  plant denial is something to always worry about, but I feel like gridlock allows for safer and easier plants.

This is good point. Rook plates stop me from placing my turret sometimes. But I give people warning to get armour before smashing rooks dreams.
---
We can't blame both? This game has been out for 3 and a half years now. And this isn't the first time this glitch has appeared in the game. I see absolutely no reason that we can't be upset at Ubisoft for allowing a bug that has existed before to return. Believe me, I absolutely am upset with the people who decide to abuse it but I am also equally upset that shit like this still happens. And to be fair, this isn't the only game breaking glitch we've had to deal with. We've had the deployable shield one multiple times, the invisible operator glitch, the infinite stim pistol glitch, the Monty extended shield glitch, the hip fire glitch, the 3 speed 3 armor glitch, and I'm sure there are more that I can't remember. Even at this moment there's an equally infuriating Clash shield glitch. This is in addition to the insanely poorly balanced operators that Ubi has released throughout the games life cycle, that failed to see major changes for months. So yes, I think it is completely fair to be upset with Ubisoft.

People who use the laser voluntarily on anything but a shotgun rush distress me...
---
I can't tell you HOW MANY TIMES someone on my team has had their position exposed due to that fricken laser and how many kills I have gotten PURELY due to the enemy TELLING me where they are by using the laser. That thing, in my opinion (notice I said OPINION), is the most useless gadget of them all and is more of a hurt than a help.

I disagree. To press the face buttons or the dpad buttons you have to take your finger off the thumbsticks which puts you at a huge disadvantage. On MK+B though you can easily access several different buttons without letting go of WASD, and that's not counting all the buttons you might have on your mouse. In most shooters, moving in more than 8 directions is pretty unimportant. I'd say controllers are better for platformers and racing games, but not shooters.

There's a bug that lets her fire her gun while she has her shield up. Don't ask me how, I'm not telling cuz this community is tosic enough without glitches.

It's pretty shitty for sure. Making ranked reaaally unfun right now.
---
FYI: If you manage to lure her into an airjab or otherwise get her to put the shield away, it resets the glitch. Lifelines don't work, unfortunately. Not sure about friendly fire from an echo drone.
---
Yes, clash shi–µld glitch is annoying to go up against. Deployable face shields are back again also but not many people I have seen using it yet. So hopefully both get patched out before too many people catch on.

---
I like it because it's a slightly less zoomed ACOG - allows me to have the zoom of an ACOG with less recoil on certain guns. It's all down to personal preferences.
---
For instance, i disavow the meta on Twitch's F2, and run a holo or a reflex.

I find that sometimes I am struggling mid round. What I used to do was try new operators, new strats or try to play a different way. However, I‚Äôve found that if you just continue to play the way you are comfortable with, you will be focused on the game because you don‚Äôt need to worry about where to push, how and when to use your gadget,etc. you just need to focus on hitting your shots. In terms of warming up, I just go into a couple t hunts and just rush and try to be as accurate as possible while maintaining a game like speed
---
I play jager with reflex, compensator and grip. the gadget is barbed wire.  I also play maverick with m4 acog, compensator and grip and the gadget is claymore

im sorry if my comment was assholish, i just haven‚Äôt seen a suppressor used successfully at high levels of play. if you clap cheeks with it, then you clap cheeks. more power to you bro lol

The window's corner you see is the rest of the barricade, which shouldn't eat bullets.

In the replay you can hear that the metal shelf is hit - which you don't hear in the gameplay.

The pulse on the other hand can shoot me perfectly fine.

Pulse was a buddy of mine u/Themafiapro and we tried to film that in a custom game. I told him not to move.

Otherwise he is pretty fresh ;-)

Right, and since the communities play separately and the weapons are balanced separately, how is it "unfair"?
---
did you shot him?

Cav i mean

Blackbeard: *cries in american*

Vigil/Dokk top right

The only correct answer. Only one laser needs to be tripped for full damage to be done. Hid the other two beams for maximum stealth and let the enemy walk into the third one.

This past week has been horrendous. It's caught on like wild-fire and everyone is Clash / Deployable shield hacking. Tonight, we were playing and of course we ran into a Clash exploiter. But what stunned us was this guy using IQ on Villa to melee kill us from ACROSS THE MAP FROM SPAWN POINT. WTF??? What is this bug?!

So true story, just happened a few days ago. Playing with my best friend and my brother. Both my brother and I are relatively newer (lvl 45 and 69, respectively) and my friend is a 180. Game ends with a win, brother drops an alpha...boom! Black ice for buck...his main! Couldn't believe it, how lucky right? NOT TWO GAMES LATER...with a 6 percent chance to get an alpha pack, he gets another one. And guess what? ANOTHER BLACK ICE FOR THE M59A1. Wtf...Why are we still here!? Just to suffer?

Any other clips, that are guaranteed hacks, that one could again be placed on a visual glitch, something such as walls or locking on to enemies?

Oh i was talking about the clash shield glitch not the IQ. The shield glitch is pretty common (at least this week) in addition to the return of the jager face shield glitch. (covers your face with a deployable shield and allows you to run around with it while shooting) 
---
Not too sure about the IQ knife, seen a few videos around.

How the hell did you get those potato settings?

It's the worst.

What have you done!!

That is some of the best luck ever

You don't.

Nope, just an IQ invisible glitch.

Damn I'll try that one next time

Really depends on the map, and operaters really depends on the role(s) you want them in.
---
E.g. hardbreach, soft, fragger etc.
---
*lol*
---
Nicu-Nicu
---
Nope.  It‚Äôs meant to counter roamers, namely Cav.  Cav has her own workaround(Silent Step does not leave footprints and intercepts ping), and others are able to prone, which leaves no footprints at all.  Any Jammers nearby or electricity damaging him will cut out his visor, temporarily blinding him.  Him getting shot screws up his vision too.  Killing Jackal gets rid of the debuff, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to know where he is or where he‚Äôs peeking.  Footsteps also disappear after about a minute, which would punish any player who takes too long.  Jackal is an info-gatherer, and anyone that can predict Jackal can kill him easily.  A nerf to his guns may be needed, but his ability is in a good place right now.

I dunno, maybe someone below me might know

What about Echo?

I bet you have "Better Gaming Chair" than him

I think it works too if you place Vigil next to Rook

It would have made shooting things even harder, which might would have been a good thing.

My first, and only black ice is for Smokes SMG. I rarely use him, sadly.

I think if they did change this, then they need to semi blur out the background of the room your in, and make the audio less noticeable as well, while making audio from the camera the same/louder, so that you are still focused in on it while having an idea of where you are still and somewhat of what's going on around you. I think the main issue is that audio already tends to be super buggy and changing to this would be difficult to implement and keep up with audio working correctly.
---
I think as well that attackers would need a change similar if it was implemented for defenders, but how to implement for droning phase I'd have no idea, but afterward they'd have the same effect, that their surroundings and audio are blurred as they focus on droning
---
For all of this though, Echos and Twitches pda would be awkward so they wouldent see much around them as they stare at their wrists, and Dokka is a full tablet

I don‚Äôt get why people actually feel good playing like that there is no difference in doing that or using aim bots and wall hacks.

Assasin's Creed Sledgehood
---
How about tapping that trigger instead of full flex panic trigger pull to the back of the shaft.
---
Imo it should be hotfixed cause 3 completely gamebreaking repeatable glitches completely ruins ranked. But knowing ubi it will be until next season and for the rest of the season the game will be aids to play.
---
What about the issue with deplorable shields?
---

Yeah, I agree

I played ranked yesterday and some guy on our team was doing it, so we tk'd him every defense round. We lost, joined the other teams party and turns out that their team was boosting with the guy on our team. Big oof on my part
---
Honestly don‚Äôt give a shit that you died after. Doesn‚Äôt matter. That hammer kill was delectable.
---
I don't mean to be hyperbolic, this sort of shit doesn't happen in like EVERY match, but it's pretty much bi-daily that I experience at least SOME sort of frustrating toxicity. And voice-communication is rarely a thing, regardless of whether it's casual or ranked when you solo-queue. I only realized myself until most of my friends stopped playing Siege and jumped onto Fortnite, then CoD, then Apex and I was left pretty much playing Siege by myself (BR just isn't my thing).
---
I seconded nerf. Not buff.
---
Are you even reading? I'd second anything that DOESN'T say buff Ela.
---
Fun video

You really think crying on reddit will do anything? Ubisoft, understandably, never check reddit and people who abuse these exploits are only encouraged by people complaining about it.
---
 Cool! Plans for any other operators?

I never played pre-nerf Ela, I got her in my Christmas pack. Since then she has become my most played defender. I'm sure compared to her pre-nerf state she seems underwhelming, but she has her purpose. She's not a must-pick op anymore, I'm not sure I'd even call her a roamer.
---
I think she's more suited to an "off-site anchor" role. Use your Grzmots to give yourself information on where the enemies are coming from. Lock down a room of strategic importance near the objective - rooms above objectives and hallways to objectives are excellent places to hold. You're a 3-speed - you're quiet, you can reposition and retreat quickly. Hold close angles, force them to step into your Grzmots before fighting them. If you get droned out, reposition and hide until your Grzmot goes off. If your on-site defenders are being pressured, make your way back to site quietly, you might catch an attacker or two off guard. If you need to take a long-range fight, you're going to have to burst or tap fire. Try to break away and bait them into a Grzmot while holding a close angle.
---
I think you're playing Ela wrong, I think you're trying to play her as the laser-beam god she once was. Are you sure it's not just you?
---
Only happens in siege tho and it is updated
---
Hey where‚Äôs the replies-nice guy, theres a lot of nices in here and i havent seen him
---
I'm a real hater of hitscan shooting mechanics, therefore sorry, i cannot agree with you.
---
As for bullet drop - you could check bf4 (in its current state) - even in CQB it makes a difference, because due to the fact, that bullets are real objects, server has to work with them differently.
---
Ofc that doesnt mean, that changing of shooting mechanics should be prioritized over fixing issues with lag etc

I vote for Mozzie. P10 and MX4 have the same stats, but the recoil on P10 is pretty much non existent with the compensator. Mozzie's gadget is also better at gathering info comparing to Alabi's holograms. I often use hacked drones as Valk cams to throw a C4 through the floor.

I've hit some stupid aces, like on bank I triple collated with glaz 2 headshots and a body shot, pretty sure the 3rd had just been picked up, then pistols the last two that came down the stairs. I hit shit without even knowing sometimes ahaha

Diagonal if the door remains closed, sideways if a teammate is going to use it.

They usually launch atk/def/atk/def/atk....

So I go with Montagne or Buck.

They are the only attackers left for the CTUs that already has a Elite available.

I was playing casual yesterday, and my team was winning 2-0. Well, it became a 2-2 because the enemies decided to shield glitch, and one of them started walling us. The only reason we won was because my team stuck together (very rare, eh?)
---
clash need s class
---
Well then...ok
---
Mute i feel is a great pick but i feel like there are others who can do his job better bandit for walls and mozzie for drones
---
Buck i feel could be higher yes but again has many alternative operators like sledge and zofia
---
Thatcher while i feel his gadget is very strong is in that tier because he gun is a good gun but nothing special

And valks firepower lets her down, her mpx is a peashooter at the best of times however strong she is

thats not why alibi is good. Alibi holos make it so you cant see if you run through them you get pinged, if you drone through them you get pinged. her gun is insane, and if they spray and happen to hit it they get pinged

I hate people who tea bag, but if it's against a cheater with the Clash glitch or regular shield glitch (or a plain hacker), I'm fine with it. Hell, even I'll do it against one of those assholes
---
Only if she can be utilized correctly which most people cannot
---
No I got it a few months back.
---
Shield operators need to be completely reworked (changed to how Clash functions, so they have to put their shield away to kill people) or should just straight up be removed. 
---
With how broken and annoying they are at the moment they don‚Äôt belong in the game.

The Gamemode isn‚Äôt the problem, a large portion of the player base is

Are we then also allowed to board the helicopter?

Enemies cannot see lasers on kapkan traps, those are invisible, however claymores, which are attack utilities, have lasers that are highly visible to defenders

Nope, there are many people that want her buffed in a way or another.

Y‚Äôknow what, let‚Äôs just deconstruct this entire thread and see how other people would react to this image.

Just delete all the comments above and I‚Äôll remove mine

I agree that this community is toxic but in this case it‚Äôs just casual. I don‚Äôt think toxicity in casual should really count as toxicity, if that makes sense.

Maybe you should get better at gun fights and not just say, ‚Äúhey they have an ash, just throw because she too much of a god‚Äù

We are currently encountering a server degradation on RainbowSixSiege.

the ADS is really slow and I use laser because I can spray a bit better during the ADS time
---
Its why I‚Äôve stopped playing it again I‚Äôm tired of the continuous toxicity and bugs
---
I'm worse
---
Ubisoft made all base operators unlocked for everyone
---
I like how you say her win rate is high when it's below a 1.00%. Also you miss the fact that Ela can't engage at range like every other roamer can. You can say that she's just really good at close range but every other roamer can also be that with their shotguns. So no she really isn't a very good pick especially with how selfish her gadget is. And really her gadget doesnt even help her all that much. So really everything you just said is your own opinion and also wrong.
---
YOU WILL DIE IN
---
How does ‚Äústop spreading false information‚Äù sound rude? Do you want a ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to be added? Maybe a ‚Äúsir‚Äù or ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù as well?
---
Looks rad mate!
---
My way is to put it in the middle of the room and it somehow works
---
Why is everyone saying nice?
---
Yes. Those shield users are deplorable.
---
Noice!
---
Yeah i know her fo12 is amazing,  i main her with it actually and it's amazing. But people tend to leave that gun out of the equation. Its also that her scorpion should be her ranged weapon and it isn't, it's really only good at 2ft away from you which isn't good for someone who already has a close to mid range shotgun.
---
Not like it matters, they always run right into it no matter how you place it :P
---
Holy shit that was close on the timer there . . .
---
Naw he the new number six

Obviously its saying that glaze has died and he is no longer able to help his friends but only to watch them die

---
Press F for J√§ger's ACOG
---
25%
---
We definitely need the new SCOPE for every DMRs
---
Depends on time of day and skill lever you‚Äôre playing in. Servers may not be very populated. If I hit 5 mins I restart the queue. If I hit 5 minutes 2-3 times I just go play another game. 
---
If you‚Äôre stacked in a group games take no time to find, solo you may never find one.
---
Totally, Capitao‚Äôs lmg acog IMO should be the one available to every DMR and Glaz(with some modifications to Glaz to distinguish it ofc)
---
8 minutes... nope
---
fisting is 300$
---
No
---
Well ACOG is a medium to long range sight and DMR's are what fits to the term medium to long range. If we had a bolt action sniper rifle (which would be disgusting)  new sight would be useful

Sure thing, bud.

Click ranked for a full match.
---
I've still yet to do it, myself. I don't think I ever will.
---
How rude
---
that second one is going to get destroyed
---
i guess i am the only one who dies lmao only for the Eagle and the strong sound when shooting, and i dont know why
---
Pretty good clutch tho
---
That's not a valid excuse to kick someone, pretty sure everybody has had bad games. And even he's a bot I just suck it up because  not everybody can be a good.
---
I know, its annoying
---
Copy that!
---
The first one is actually a bad idea because most high level players will use an impact to open a door before a runout rather than tearing down a barricade. The impact would likely destroy a claymore right on the other side, but if you place it off to the side enough you may still be able to get the kill.

Ela's only there because as a main of her i know how shit she is against everyone else.

Yeah that‚Äôs how I learn new maps, like outback, the top flier of restaurant is called mezzanine, and when I make that fallout, my team is clueless unless it‚Äôs my brother, or my close friends

---
They should be i just kinda rushed this but cav needs to be reverted back to what she was pre-windbastion and clash is good if people know how to play her but i preferred her with the burst fire rather that auto on her machine pistol
---
smashed a team that was doing that yesterday, but maestro coming at you with that shield is terrifying
---
Most operators are 2 speeds
---
IQ is fine, no buff needed. 
---
Glaz after his rework will be in a good spot. 
---
Maestro is fine now after his recent nerf, he is still a top 5 defender easily. 
---
Ela may need a recoil buff, but other than that shes fine. 
---
Nomad is an extremely annoying and good operator, most likely needs a nerf to her gadget.  
---
Cav is fine where she is. 
---
I'm not even going to recognise that you think Blitz needs a buff. 
---
Fuze does need a change yes.
---
Could go either way however people see it.
---
Hey guys it's dbl online......
---
As a follow up on that, I wanna give you a few tips on HOW to counter spawnpeakers. 
---
1. Learn where the windows are on different maps and what spawns they have a view of. 
---
2. If you are approaching the building from a side that you suspect is being spawnpeaked, move slowly, and use outside cover to get a good angle on a spawnpeak, or at least a semi-safe angle so that you can just check to see if a certain window or two are actually being peaked. 
---
3. There are few really nasty spawnpeaks that Involve runouts. These are typically only going to be utilized by the sweatiest of sweats, but sometimes enemies will just do a normal run out because they really want a kill. It‚Äôs still sweaty, just not as sweaty. 
---
Hope this advice helps.
---
Wait that illegal
---
I love Sniper Elite.
---
I feel you. Especially when they have no kills or are at the bottom of the board and you are in top 2 WITH KILLS
---
You should play some siege with her
---
\&gt;blitz
---
\&gt;need buff
---
n o
---
Also, why is Pulse so high while Maestro, Vigil, and Lion so low? Vigil is A-tier minimum IMO, and maybe S-tier.
---
Un-accurate, he has an acog
---
It‚Äôs not that bad, use it on Mira sometimes in low plat, not bad. Maybe I‚Äôm just special and it‚Äôs a bad scope :P
---
Often people rip out open or jump vault. If not you lose the surprise and enemies will have time to react
---
haha dae lord tachunka xDDD
---
HAHAHAHAHA. Thats a good one.
---
You can also see him *instantly* flicking from left to right, along with jittery movement even when just running, things which don't happen with a stick.
---
This is a dumb list.
---
With a pistol no less
---
not on console please
---
Her big bones
---
3 speeds, then 2, then 1. No real point in being able to take body shots in a game where one bullet kills you anyways, might as well make it slightly harder to 1 tap you. In lower skill brackets then 2-3 speeds might actually be better because people are going for body shots most of the time, but pretty much Gold and up 3 speeds are just better.

See, i have issues with the reflex green in some lighting so I prefer the red dot.
---
Use a grenade or twitch drone
---
I love him and I need him.
---
What about a dual sight? Like a reflex stuck to the side of a Capitao LMG scope? And use the select fire feature to switch sights as DMR are all semi anyway
---
I am inevidable....
---
I actually ran into this last night, and my teammates actually were able to counter it.
---
Basically Zofia, Nomad, and Capitao, with a splash of either Ash or Twitch.
---
If it can fuck with her shield, or indirectly injure her, Its a counter until Ubi fixes it.
---
WELL HELLO THERE
---
Umm why is Recruit at the bottom?
---
:D I love my broken as shit AAA game!
---
Both. If I‚Äôm on chalet and I‚Äôm attacking above the main entrance, I‚Äôll claymore the door to the right that defenders don‚Äôt have to leave to shoot me.

Most others I leave it around the corner or outside a window

When the devs released the stats for Frost's mats it came out showing that the highest rate in which they triggered and downed someone was 10% of the time, and that was in Diamond rank. 
---
That is terrible, that means 90% of the time you are playing an operator with an okay gun and no gadget. 
---
Just because you do well with an operator does not mean they are good. As she stands she is an extremely weak pick and there a vastly better and more important picks than her.
---
I use the red dot instead of the reflex because to me, the housing to sight-space ratio is more manageable than the reflex

I think mira and jackal came out in velvet shell, and the way u three star the bomb situation is plant it behind the couch and hid in the corner next to the couch, so u can just nail the terrorists as they come around the couch to defuse.

I just don't understand how people say we don't need operation health 2 because we really do. I've stopped playing this year,  the one year i buy the season pass i quit. I'm just sick of all the bullshit sound glitches, hit reg problems, character placement issues, and just about zero feedback from the devs. And honestly i blame ubi for their lack of focus. All these pointless new cosmetics, and events like Rainbow is magic. The animation they did for invintationals was a pretty big waste of time. I mean at least they tried to make it look good,  still not as good as Frostbite 3 and 4 cutscenes in my opinion though. 
---
They even had 3 months to focus on glitches in operation health and yet it literally fixed nothing important. It's honestly sad that I think uno is ubi's more stable game. And just at the rate siege is going with these glitches i really don't see the game getting any more popular anytime soon. And you can see this in monthly player numbers that have been decreasing below csgo for the past threes months.

hahaha yes, its my wallpaper of that mode

This is probably the most accurate list that has been made so far.

I agree with most of this except i feel like blitz is good and bad his shield cooldown needs to be only 3 seconds but the area of his flash needs to be lowered just a couple of feet 
---
Maestro is not a top 5 guy for me he might be for others but i would always rather have an echo rather than a maestro
---
I see ACOG I upvote!

I got killed by someone doing the clash glitch in ranked he was running out and I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm gunna grenade this guy‚Äù And yeh i didn‚Äôt even get a chance to throw a grenade. I think its time to stop playing siege for a week.

No teacher could‚Äôve prepared me for this level of autism you‚Äôre spouting, Glaz
---
Or just use the test server. It has all the ops unlocked.
---
That‚Äôs a good one.
---
Not saying it‚Äôs mandatory but why not? It can be fun
---
It‚Äôs an exploit which is technically cheating
---
why do you have to be rude about it. I usually play casually. not try hard (probably you).
---
They intentionally did it. So its cheating
---
Pulse is a-s tier but lion is not as good as he was before and even tho his guns are still viable he is not great, vigil it is either you are good with him or you aren't his guns are god-like but his gadget needs to be longer and keep the cool-down the same
---
I diet really have issuer one way or another, so that's not much of a factor. For me sight picture and housing are the all important stats and the Red dot just acts as a middle grounds when there really shouldn't be.
---
If the door isn‚Äôt prepped then I rarely do. If I run through a claymore I die basically no matter what but I can still win an aim duel against an enemy who knows I‚Äôm coming. Not just that but the sound of a door getting ripped down is a lot more obvious than a door/window getting shot open.
---
Ela doesn‚Äôt need a buff. 
---
I keep telling people (and they keep ignoring this), that being a 3 speed doesn‚Äôt dictate that operator being a roamer. Sure, the better roamers are 3 speeds but it‚Äôs more down to the gadget than the speed itself (however speed is still an issue). 
---
When you think about it, Ela‚Äôs kit is so suited to playing on site. Close range, high RoF primary or an OP semi auto shotgun, which both excel at close range. Has a gadget that works best on site, and barbed wire which is best on site. She‚Äôs a 3 speed site player and that‚Äôs the best way to be effective with her for the average player. 
---
Sure you can roam and do well, but that‚Äôs down to the player not operator. The operator is completely suited to site now. 
---
People need to realise this and stop claiming she‚Äôs a bad roamer. They aren‚Äôt wrong but not because she is a dedicated roamer who is bad, but that she shouldn‚Äôt even be a roamer yet people play her like one. 
---
That‚Äôs like saying Frost is a poor roamer. She is because she‚Äôs so much better played on site and her kit really dictates this. If she were to roam, she‚Äôd generally do poor.
---
Blitz just needs a complete rework, as do all shield operators (excluding Clash). 
---
Maestro is one of the best picks you can have on defence, by far. Echo may be better, but it really depends on the map and site. 
---
Atm Echo and Maestro are pretty much must picks, if you don't have one you usually have the other as the info they give you is too much to pass on.
---
Recruit needs to be updated with the new gadgets and new guns and bring back the chimera recruit customizing.

The smokes and flashes thing will make him busted as shit though so I wouldn't expect it to make it to live...

People have been complaining about Glaz, but a defender that can see through smokes sounds far more deadly.

And cav on attack, give her an acog, 3 speed and watch everyone cry as mega-ash murders everyone.

No, i play on pc

I can see that, but the teaser is very similar to grim sky aswell

Warden: "you think so?"
---
Isn't that scope backwards?
---
How do you know?
---
Yea. Hopefully though they are able to keep the similar operations unique
---
Excuse me but I am plat 2 level 337. My clearance has nothing to do with the way the game matches us. Being punished for accomplishing diamond is a stupid idea, it is unfortunate that when they do play casual its full of sweat but that isn't something that should be player - punishable. It needs to be addressed server side rather than for the player.  Stupid idea 110% disagree.
---
Wait WHAT
---
Scorpion isn't bad, just got a buff to its recoil
---
Not really many tips you can receive but for attacking, if you‚Äôre ever uncertain if an enemy is around the corner always use your backup drone to check, always good to have a feel for where the enemy is. When defending, I typically try not to stay in the room with lightweight characters because I‚Äôd rather come to them than let them come to me. Overall make sure to use your operators special ability when needed.
---
I can tell you, but then I‚Äôd have to kill you
---
Yeah VFC has a high quality model that's been out for years. I think it was discontinued, but some websites still sell it. Expensive tho.
---
I trust they will
---
lol it's all over youtube, Me posting a link makes no difference as anybody with half a brain can go to youtube and search for rainbow6 siege glitches to easily find it and more. Besides the more it spreads the faster it gets patched!
---
I‚Äôm not sure, but the firerate would need to be pretty low to balance it out. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôd help much, as you can already spam it pretty quick if you have a good trigger finger. I think the firerate would likely be faster by just spamming than making it fully auto. I think Dokkaebi really just needs something added to her C75 and SMG-12 to help make close quarters easier for her when it‚Äôs needed.

Well you were bloddy lying https://mobile.twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1127967017523400706
---
Yes.
---
##I AM VISIBLY CONFUSED. ~ CONTINUES TO SHOUT ~
---
It should. 
---
If I was Ubisoft, I would announce this once they are ready too but let everyone know they are doing an extensive audio rework, if that‚Äôs what the plan is. They need to make this known because audio is an issue every season and it‚Äôs about time they improve their sound propagation and sound distortion. 
---
Sound needs a ground up rework of how it is emitted and how it travels. This needs to be their main focus
---
Still disagree. Ubi seemingly has no interest in fixing matchmaking and I'm tired of sweating in casual against people who outrank me. Besides, once you hit Diamond there's honestly no reason to go back to Casual unless you want to sweat in some poor soul just trying to have fun
---
Ubi gave her thg he kit and weapons of a roamer, even if you do believe she should be on site to be good which she one shouldn't have to and two shouldn't be in the first place. You miss the point that every one else not just roamers can fight at both long and close range. Ela only being effective at close and for her scorpion just feet away. Which leaves her at a disadvantage no matter what way you look at it.
---
You have made my life so much better
---
Take every shot you possibly can, and don't be afraid to rush. Never rely on one direct route, try to find a new way in every time. Don't choose your main just yet either, mess around with all that you possibly can so you can find your suited playstyle. And also, don't worry about dying, it's a perfectly natural part of the game so there's no reason to get hung up on it
---
That‚Äôs the season everyone wants!!
---
Unrealistic with the acog.....
---
It‚Äôs not hacking, yes but it‚Äôs a kind of cheating
---
It will forever be a mystery.
---
May be tey just will balance in casual by your rank in ranked, +- 1 rank(gold play just with gold, silver 1,2 and platinum 4,3)(and other such way). As they should do, as ubisoft told us in year 1,2. They told if we've got a rank in this season(played 10 matches in current season) you can play by this system, if not play with all players like now
---
What if they want to play with their friends in casual? Stupid to not let them.
---
I dont know, being able to actively see through smokes is extremely useful. Especially as an anchor on BOMB.
---
Stop using the vertical on that gun immediately!
---
Despite the fact, I personally love playing casual against diamonds, since there's a chance I can learn something from better players.
---
Highly doubt it. That‚Äôd be too similar to Jackal.
---
I think the colors are to help distinguish who‚Äôs the defender and who‚Äôs the attacker, since it‚Äôs blue and orange smoke on their wrists.
---
If you got the abandon you got the loss
---
It wasn‚Äôt leaked the ubisoft Twitter posted it
---
Only a small number of people know about this glitch and they are still at a disadvantage as I play on PS4 with Xim apex m&amp;k adapter :)
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i3prrvacGCo
---
none of Mozzie and Vigil's gear reveals their faces so she might be the first female operator who we can't see her face and actually looks like what her real life counterparts wear.
---
Which we need an operator looking like how they look irl.
---
I will ms.Thicc
---
I didn‚Äôt even know it was gone. I only got to play it for a couple months and then one day asked my buddy what happened to that one map you played during the first situation? 
---
He broke the news to me, havnt really been the same person since. I drinking has gotten outta control. I hit my wife last week for the first time. I havnt paid my car payment in 3 months. I‚Äôve taken fmla for 2 weeks straight from work because at this point my body has just given up....I can‚Äôt physically move my legs to get outta bed. All I can bring myself to do is log on a few times a day and team kill the top player in a ranked match and log out before anyone else can react....it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me going
---
Well oh fuckin' well, just drag their friend into ranked, at Diamond you should be able to carry them at least enough to not drop yourself
---
If you want to play ‚Äúeasier‚Äù opponents as a bronze or silver, then maybe YOU should play ranked. Casual is for everyone to play however they want. Whether i wanna try my ass off or practice ops i suck with, it doesnt matter. I also like to play when i dont know if ill have time for a full ranked match. Noone should be disallowed to play casual just because they are better than you.
---
This is no
---
Punishing players by locking them out of casual just for being good at the game is the fastest way to make your playerbase hate you...
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
And thats my problem with it.
---
So you ain‚Äôt gonna credit anthony pit for the idea?
---
I also find shields deplorable.
---
It looks like wer getting that really cool danish operator outfit like in real life photos. For those of you wondering just look up the danish special forces uniform on google, it‚Äôs really cool
---
Pretty hard to learn anything at all when you get spawnpeeked and teabagged in the first two seconds of the game starting
---
You don't need to know spray patterns really as much as csgo, just control recoil and try to get used to an operators gun.
---
Why not?
---
I don't think the defender will be broken. It'll just be something attackers will have to look out for before just spamming smokes and planting. We already have plenty of resources to stop them from peeking.
---
It's every time like this with Ubi and this game. Some new glitch appears with every update and they do not fix it straight away or as fast as possible, they always take ages to do so, pissing off legitimate players. Also I feel like reporting doesn't matter at all, at least in the past seasons (it's been a while since the last time I played). More than once 3 friends &amp; me were playing with a random teammate, he was glitching (I dont remember exactly if it was Doc's glitch, Jaeger or whatever), all of us reported him and the other team as well and nothing ever happened.
---
The list of glitches that had being going on and makes the game almost unplayable is quite long; the invisibility glitch, doc's infinite ammo on his gadget, deployable shield...
---
Or you simply want to chill and not bother tryharding in like in ranked? So we're not allowed to play casual because we're better than you?
---
If you truly want to play against people the same rank as you then you can also just play ranked.
---
Then you just learned a new common spawnpeek and now you can figure out how to avoid it.
---
I intend to make this the next Skywalker saga.
---
Fuze Vigil and Montaigne over Blackbeard and IQ is just wrong lol quit with these subjective lists
---
Its ok, no one can aim with a controller anyways.
---
Unlikely. Defender also has effect on gun.
---
"yOuRe JuSt BaD" Wow! How observant of you! I'm going to stop complaining now! *gets ass-raped by Diamonds*
---
That is a stupid fix if they arent a 5 stack, if one player is Diamond and his premade is legit Cooper is facing off Vs another diamond team it sucks for the 3 people that noe has a non premade Copper with them
---
What do I see? Another American operator for some fucking reason.
---
Plat 1 and diamond level matches I consider to be upper level. But it sounds like you guys are experiencing it at plat 2 which is only 400 elo lower; so I‚Äôm sorry that you guys are experiencing this. Whatever the rank exploits like this shouldn‚Äôt even be in the game in the first place
---
Am I the only one who likes the new hereford more than the old one? 
---
I mean the previous one was kind of okay but the basement floor was kind of hard to attack/easy to defend now it‚Äôs actually easy to attack but it can be easily defended if defended properly. On the new one Maverick is op since on secure area on most objectives it‚Äôs easy to make holes from upstairs so you can bamboozle defending team hiding on objective, but if you have a good roamer who will stop Maverick/fuze or even whole team then it‚Äôs easy to defend it
---
LEG mounted and loaded.
---
We ended up winning from using nomad to knock her down/ using capitao to burn her out/ finka and buck and sledge to made her/ blitz or Monty to keep her distracted or something
---
Oh, you are our precious George Lucas 2.0!
---
Are people supposed to not try or something why would they play to lose
---
Scopes don't always have to have a fatter front lens than the rear.
---
Oh i have only been playing for 3 weeks i didn't know..
---
Because it‚Äôs way easier to say he‚Äôs a two speed than to clarify that every single time. Especially because most people know what you mean already.
---
It's not just an inconvenience, it's completely game breaking and ruins the entire game. The obvious solution would be for Ubi to fix matchmaking, but they obviously don't care too much about that since I've been fighting Plats and Diamonds for about a month now
---
Who in the world wouldn't?
---
Because they spread it
---
The [wikipedia aritcle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_14_Enhanced_Battle_Rifle) on it says it can be set to full auto if I'm reading the info in the side bar correctly.
---
Yes and Gridlock looks like Logan Paul
---
It's not compression, the game's chat just gets a weird distortion at lower resolutions (like 1280x800)
---
Casual does actually have its own separate MMR system that you aren‚Äôt shown
---
The leaker who leaked Y4S1 correct. Leaked the Y4S2 and this is what he/she said about the Danish Attacker 
---
She is extremely cute and will be the next fan favorite operator.
---
It‚Äôs breaking the game? Cry me a river if you‚Äôre so butthurt then just leave the game and find a new one it‚Äôs not like your finding diamonds every match
---
This is gold
---
\&gt;angery but hyped
---
What i feel about GoT S8 right now

how long do you think it takes to fix glitches? obviously you have zero idea

***WHAT IS UP BRAHS***
---
Thank you sir, but I'm only a bronze 2
---
Yeah, I'm just a scope noob apparently.
---
People dont understand that you can play fast with any good operator
---
At least you've gotten an ace :(
---
My guess is the orange is for thermal vision and cool blue is for avoiding thermal vision
---
Flashbacks to when they first gave him the shield sprint and he felt faster than ash
---
Well that‚Äôs the thing, if this operator exists it makes smiles and flash plants redundant. So it can completely kill an offensive set up. If they bring a Glaz, ying, jackal, anyone with those tools he hard counters it. Basically meaning they have to abandon that idea and do something else or kill the defender.
---
What are we supposed to be looking at here?
---
it sounds cool
---
Community is toxic &amp; game is currently in a broken state ... Good luck
---
I think the latest leaks are the girl is Phantom and the guy is Rogue.
---
Deploy the drones!
---
Blue "smoke" on the supposed defender and orange "smoke" on the supposed attacker? Was that just an oversight or intentional misdirection?
---
Well smoke has his own variety of smoke. But who knows if they will allow the new op to see through that.
---
I hope it isn t like that cuz you re getting a Vigil On attack and a glaz like OP on defense...
---
Sounds like everyone for sure lol
---
Why the suppressor, should have gone with the spawn peaker extended barrel
---
You Italics the wrong thing? xD
---
1. Most op‚Äôs cant penetrate reinforcements, but most floors are wooden, so you can shoot gadgets through them.                                                   
---
2. I‚Äôd rather have my pistol out than be on a drone.                                                                              
---
3. Line of sight is easy to get when you can shoot through most walls, floors, barricades
---
4. Valk cams, echo drones, and mozzie drones can be the death of your team, so IQ can easily takes those out. 
---
5. IQ doesn‚Äôt have limited gadget uses like Twitch or Thatcher.
---
6. Twitch and Thatcher can‚Äôs see invisible gadgets.
---
7. IQ can kill pulse, vigil, people using cams (especially echo), and defenders breaking the defuser through walls and barricades.
---
Kinda looks like a G&amp;G CM16 Raider L 2.0E
---
Don't know about that ACOG tho.
---
It was leaked thats her ability makes her invsible to *cameras*. I don't believe for a second that Ubisoft would implement an actual invisibility gadget into the game. Then again, Lion was also a thing for almost a year.
---
I feel like your whole list need to be shifted for the most part s tier is meant for the strongest must picks in the game like vanilla lion finka people who made an impact just by existing ash should be allot lower all she really has of note is a good/ popular gun
---
I can't believe the game is broken AGAIN
---
It's pretty good

Nah she‚Äôs invisible to cameras for a short time most likely but I‚Äôm surprised that people aren‚Äôt talking about the defender more.

I remember the first game I played post patch when they gave him his speed back, hearing those feet thundering down the hall gave me more of a fright than anything that‚Äôs happened in 
---
Siege, before or since

Yes, I am. Almost every game is either 250+ unranked or a few Plats. Don't underestimate how shitty the matchmaking is

That's a good point. Maybe IQ can counter him from just holding a long angle

Can people stop reposting this please
---
currently plat 3 but the game is uninstalled until the glitch is gone. i threw away 200 elo bc of it yesterday
---
if ubi had any real sense on how to manage a competitive shooter, clash would be quarantined by now like they did with lion until a fix can be applied
---
Bandit a acog though
---
tachanka just walked up to you. no gun fire. no melee. just "here do me next" lol
---
maybe keep it uninstalled. one less kid like you on the game isn‚Äôt a bad idea
---
But. Ranked you should be against people who are as good as you. Even casual if you play casual enough. 
---
Like my casual matches are basically all plats+.
---
Where they have the shield up but they can shoot. It‚Äôs so annoying.
---
Sure is Zarbon in here...
---
Ah you mean like teammate of the clash destroys it. Then yes. I thought you meant the enemy destroying it.
---
no plans on that. not a kid either just callin it how i see it
---
The deployable shield glitch is very fun to encounter as well. 
---
Yet another game breaking glitch. Guess I'll play something else until they decide to get around to patching.
---
Edit: really? Downvoting because I mentioned a game breaking glitch?
---
This is cool and all, but is Ubi working on the shield glitch that's back?
---
IRL you could go to H&amp;K‚Äôs website and look at the 416 and options for it, or I assume some airsoft companies have models like it
---
Bruh the attacker can swim and the defender has legs.
---
then it would be worth using
---
You know you don‚Äôt get money for karma, right?
---
Also that account is only 4 days old. So everyday is a bit of a stretch.

No its a sequel. It takes place after the fact of the previous one

I‚Äôm saying that unless you‚Äôre also shit you wouldn‚Äôt be paired against such bad players that you could just melee them. Because that‚Äôs how matchmaking works. 
---
At high levels that just isn‚Äôt a viable strat. Handgun is much safer.

I don't think you can bring a gun to a convention center full of people. Well at least not without a police standoff.
---
Asking the questions that matter
---
Are you copper? being able to see through smoke is insanely stronge if he can shoot while doing it, especially in the capit√£o meta. He basically power creeps maestro out of the game since you could just shoot the planter anyway. It also is a major blow to ying and blitz and would make smoke ying planting impossible.
---
Well except of course if you're running surpressor and red dot at the same time...
---
What type of guns do siege players use for cosplay BB guns
---
I like that answer. üòÇ

Hello reese203, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bo7qfu/this_game_is_unplayable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
&gt;\&gt;Christmas in Russia
---
&gt;\&gt;"Operation Storm's Eye"
---
ohhh
---
Bonsoir
---
No this is Patrick
---
I mean it is a training base, it would make sense to be difficult to navigate to prepare operators for the hardest situations.
---
Best cosplay I've seen in a while good job my friend.
---
Internal parts such as the magazine and slides for pistols, for rifles such as these, they typically don‚Äôt use a lot of metal, so they are very light and typically have an electrical box to store a battery to fire BB‚Äôs. On top of that, most Air-soft manufacturers dye the plastics orange at the end.
---
Still waiting for someone to do my girl Ying.
---
Not really. Smoke/Ying plants are super common.
---
WhAT u StOoPiD¬ø ITs ObViouSly J√§GEr
---
I used to so relax
---
Did you clip these wall hacks? What console are you on?
---
The secret service looking guy looks dope as hell.
---
AD MORTEM
---
Thatcher has the Fnatic uniform.
---
"they had us in the first half not gonna lie"
---
had this happen to me two rank games in a row
---
What?
---
but lion's gun is a vector modified to shoot .308 and it's full auto so we know that isn't a problem for siege lol
---
You can see me like literally get confused and frustrated in the middle of the fight
---
Blitz is a skill based operator
---
I do see your point. It could get really bad too if the enemy team bans thermite and your team bans hibana.... your only hard breach is now maverick... that's gonna tilt a lot of matches in defenders favors.
---
the orange circular watch kinda thing reminds me of the Division's watch
---
Looks like they added back Blackbeard 2.0.
---
Oh right my bad all those gas masks look the same kappa
---
Why Jackel?
---
trust me, every one of my mates were pissed off during ranked, we emailed ubisoft the name of the person hoping to get him banned
---
CIA? Insert Ding Chavez
---
NA is great for memes 10/10 would recommend again
---
Honestly fuck ranked
---
Of course it‚Äôs gameplay. Siege is a video game.
---
Do you search by new or top?
---
Never seen a team so oblivious
---
Because he's great!
---
these Ash face posts are so funny AND original. they aren‚Äôt posted numerous times a day and violate the sub rules or anything
---
But only 3 bullets now, **because balancing reasons**
---
You better change noobmaster69 before Thor comes looking for you
---
I thought of a new horror movie:
---
Blitz: The slapping
---
A real life m14 has a fuckton of kick due to no buffer system and a relatively simple bolt system with no gas transfer or any recoil mitigating functions.
---
The v308, while super fake, would hopefully have the same system as the true vector and have that cool reciprocating bolt.
---
That was a nutty flick
---
Why did I need this in my life
---
Apologies I meant no offense
---
Vigil looking at the Bill's for all his tactical gear and wondering if it was all worth it....he whispers "yes"
---
no they do not. it‚Äôs not possible to hack on console buddy. you got outplayed.
---
The fact it takes 2-3 headshots to kill him, where everyone he‚Äôs against takes 1. He‚Äôs broken as hell at high levels/certain sites.
---
Right?  My first reaction to the title was "oh, you guys finally noticed?"
---
Ok no problem
---
Guns were already leaked apparently the secret service guy will have a P90SD and the shotgun that (possibly both) will have is the KSG 15 I can‚Äôt recall what the attacker had. I think a Galil but it  didn‚Äôt seem to make sense if an Israeli season is considered
---
actually that‚Äôs not true. you have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about buddy. the meme has been around almost as long as the game.
---
With today's world politics I definently thought this was a picture at some protest
---
Or it's Sans and Papyrus
---
He has video. Should have specified on who to report to. Sorry
---
Nah u right I only use it on Ash like I said it works insanely well for me and when I play her I‚Äôm able to integrate it into my strategy. I doesn‚Äôt make sense on paper but it does in practice for me
---
It‚Äôs an automatic shotgun and the recoil isn‚Äôt that bad just hold down the trigger
---
e x q u i s i t e
---
That's illegal
---
Yea and it doesn‚Äôt help that it‚Äôs really hard to report someone directly to PlayStation. You literally have to call them and set up a case lmao. I think. I tried reporting someone a week ago and had to go to live chat 3 times and ended up not even doing it. It‚Äôs all just dumb
---
Yeah, this glitch is incredibly easy. I can do it easily, I choose only to do it when ducking about with friends in Terro hunt or custom.
---
If they do this one round, is it fair game to return the favour?
---
Lesion is wearing cargo shorts lol
---
Ubi has done it though. A different team sure, but a smaller one. In For Honor, the menu screen shows one of your heros with all your customization with idle animations.
---
Oh, xbox has it on the support site, you just fill out a ticket with TOS violation as the reason.
---
Oh. On PS4 I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs impossible to fill out a ticket and get someone banned for an in game thing. That‚Äôs why the game itself needs to report it to PlayStation, but R6 doesn‚Äôt so there‚Äôs no punishments on PS4 or pc
---
I like your idea , but i am not going to play against you , i am a level 1 noob /s
---
I think I‚Äôve played my last match of rainbow six siege. I loved this game but it is broken beyond repair. The clash glitch is the final straw. 
---
Maybe next time you guys can take toxic play, cheating, and abandoning matches seriously. Start with a month long ban for any of this BS. 
---
Goodbye siege.
---
I got it for ash r4c , bandit shotgun, fuze ar, bandit mp7,
---
Idk UV lamp ?
---
Witch hunting, post is against the rules.
---
Why rude? If they want to post it let them post
---
I had the same reaction to his elite skin.
---
I see the future of siege, sci fi
---
oof
---
They call me N√∂kk. They never see me coming.
---
And if they do; it‚Äôs too late.
---
bro that's racist
---
another reason that clash never should have been in the game.
---
Just like the old Montagne glitch where you're fully shielding yourself, but can run and shoot.
---
Ok thanks
---
Is the grenade cook bug a thing you could use to get a kill?
---
So basically like she shed her skin? Lol
---
Wow. OK. Thanks
---
I'm sorry I didnt know I'll take it down
---
That is cool but it has been done to death on lobby screens I prefer the menu screen gifs of new ops
---
Look at me. I am the Twitch main now.
---
The season pass discount works on them but otherwise no
---
No it depends on you, try both see witch you like more. When I first got him and was absolutely shit, I used his marksman, bit as I got better, I used his c8-sfw and now my K/d is positive and it's always a blast to play him.
---
It‚Äôs crazy I‚Äôve been battling the shield glitches almost every round now. I have yet to encounter the IQ and hope I don‚Äôt
---
That gun looks pretty real. I have no idea about security at conventions (at least that‚Äôs where it looks like he‚Äôs at) but is it pretty risky to bring a life-like gun into a place like that considering the current climate?
---
I know he‚Äôll be one of hundreds with a fake weapon as part of their outfit but how do you police that? Don‚Äôt they require a mandatory orange barrel or something to clearly show its a toy/model gun.
---
They likely meant "remember."
---
Can we start /r/OverdoneThanks yet?
---
Yeah some are easier to peek than others, but they all give you a fighting chance
---
If im real I thought they could water bend
---
Do you need help uploading clips?
---
But how is it fun to play an invisible PoS who ruins 9 other players time.
---
I report everyone that does this !
---
I'd rather have the attachment menu fixed.
---
Wow, this one is way better than the clash and deployable shield glitches...
---
Very useful video. Thank you so much for sharing!
---
I haven't had the time to play for a few weeks but I can see this happening, it sounds awful
---
Great Idea
---
I do love this idea but wouldn‚Äôt it increase UI lag, and loading times?
---
Absolutely, if you are an experienced player you just have to take the extra precaution of peeking the spawnpeek location first and killing them before they kill you.
---
I think it would be a better buff for the 417 than the M14, but DMR's could probably use the scope buff as a whole group, feel like they aren't picked much on console.
---
yeah. I'm in the copper hole because of them. I can 7-0 against golds, but not against diamondfags in copper.
---
That would be a nice detail for the interphase of the game, hope the devs will add it in the next season.
---
According to him he didn't realize he was like so since when do cameras give 100 points
---
Had a game where it was 2v1 on bomb. All team had to do was plant and hold, they decide to yeet for the last kill and both each ran over a frost mat and we lost. Frost is still very relevant, ever her gun is very decent.
---
I kinda want to know how -_-
---
Imagine going into a room and all 5 defenders are on Tachanka turrets.
---
Maybe ubi shouldn‚Äôt put out ass
---
If anyone wonders how to do, I am making video. This glitch is really harmless, and provides no advantage at all. Placing the second one removes the first from the map.
---
If im real I think they could water bend.
---
What‚Äôs ironic is both my mains are maverick and bandit
---

---
I bet you're fun at parties.
---
I still wonder if √∂ is a mistake since Denmark dont use that letter but √ò instead
---
What do you use mostly? The SMG of super 90? I prefer to roll with the shoty
---
Oh yeah, been there. I mean I was the only gold-level player in games full of silvers, but yeah sometimes it just seems like no matter how many kills you get, or how many slow, pitches you throw your team they just strikeout every Fucking time. Like how hard is it to win a 4v2 every now and again? I can only carry so hard. 
---
(Don‚Äôt even get me started on the time I carried a team full of silvers into overtime against two diamonds, still not sure how they even fucking got in that game)
---
I wouldn't but my squad rarely comes online anymore. Non of my other mates play r6 so I just solo que. Also this was a rant. I didn't put any logic into what I was typing. I just typed it out because I'm pissed off. Doesn't help I'm incredibly stressed from college since I've got exams all of the next 2 weeks so I'm already on edge.
---
I'm aware I'm taking it a little too seriously. It's a game. It's just frustrating Y'know?
---
Best thing I've seen today!
---
Am making video on how to do, will let you know when is out.
---
Sweet
---
What are you talking about, now he is viable, this is game breaking
---
Imagine being so bad that you have to glitch in order to get any kills and "have fun"
---
sad
---
I think we could see that as a ACOG replacement on some new ops weapons, like how Nomad has the unique reflex and Mozzie has the holo.
---
At first glance I thought you said invisible Doc, and I was like dude that‚Äôs fkn hilarious
---
"It's  Mam!!"
---
The nameless king theme plays when you enter the room
---
Right? Cant imagine being you.
---
I see what you did there
---
Proud
---
Yes
---
How would this be done?
---
You already know what I‚Äôm sad about...
---
First Attack Montagne, Blitz and Capitao. We managed to single him out then burn him. Second attack Montange(tho he got picked off), Zofia Nomad and Capitao. We got his team first then when he tried camping site we basically threw every bit of explosives and fire we had at him. It was fantastic to see just how much that glitch made us work together.
---
Man I thought they were G2 for a sec
---
Oh Wow! A new teaser of Death Stranding! Oh wait...
---
God that pisses me off why can‚Äôt people not exploit glitches
---
Make sure u post that 420 bro
---
That‚Äôs a good way to stay ahead of exploits like that. What sucks now is that these glitches and hacks aren‚Äôt so easy to counter.
---
It's a glitch btw
---
I'm sorry for the confusion, I meant you need to rebuy it
---
Pure aids
---
They didn't really, it's the same 2.5x mag as the ACOG, just uses a new reticle  without the border.
---
Ay  a dark souls reference.
---
Why was this downvoted hes using p90 for christ sake..
---
And this is why I haven't played in 2 days and won't play till this is fixed
---
I genuinely don't understand how people can actually play still when these bugs are so widespread
---
Bruh
---
There is also an invisible, invincible IQ glitch
---
New Blitz buff incoming.
---
#W H Y I S M Y P P H A R D
---
He's not invincible, he immediately gets 75hp when he revives himself that's why he becomes a bullet sponge
---
Maybe you should realize it‚Äôs impossible to have a bug free game, and bug fixing is a difficult process. And using that to justify your degeneracy is just as retarded as you are.
---
I don‚Äôt actually like this idea, the OP you choose changes depending on wether you are playing Offense and Defense and what map you play.
---
Can't play casual as a Gold as I face Plats and Diamonds. Can't play ranked as a Gold because I face Plats and Diamonds. It's a cruel world.
---
BB's dad Shieldbeard
---
Apex it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a lot but it‚Äôs not supposed to be something you can earn in a couple games. You get a free renown booster on Ubisoft club so that is pretty helpful, but otherwise just play ranked and T-hunt. There are plenty of renown farming methods in YouTube you can find.
---
That's just the siege community for you.
---
Geezus they haven‚Äôt even been revealed yet and all I see is ‚ÄúBroken‚Äù and ‚ÄúOP‚Äù do people seriously want smoke planting to go without risk through this whole games lifespan??
---
that level tho
---
yea i cant ever just play to relax lol
---
I played about 10 games in the last 2 days on PS4, I saw someone doing this glitch or at least attempting it in almost every single game.
---
If they can't fix this within the next few days they should at the very least temporarily disable shields and clash from the game.
---
I feel you, I haven't even touched the game since word got out about this glitch, which sucks because I enjoy the hell out of this game.
---
I just hate Blitz. You make a good point.
---
They were also so quick to patch the ways to get on top of tarps on coastline but shit like this takes months to fix. At least with tarps you can still die. There was no need to patch that as a priority when shit like this exists
---
It‚Äôs the enemy team messing with it. Has happened to me twice. Fyi melees and explosives are the way to kill when that happens so you can still win
---
RemindMe! 10 years
---
It is airsoft. Civilian AR platforms have two pins. This one has a third, meaning it‚Äôs airsoft or an illegal AR.
---
Next time, shotgun the barricade and hammer the injured guy on the other side.
---
Cool idea
---
Apex Legends, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare (maybe other cod games, AW was the last one I played), Boarderlands games... It's definitely not an original idea.
---
Hehe 42 packs and 0 boosters, 420.
---
Honestly bro I feel you, he just makes you panic when you hear that chugga chugga of his sprint
---
Anyone else feel like the animated screens just hurt to look at? Way rather have a good piece of art than the poor texture animation.
---
And blitz. I went blitz against a clash glitcher and she was just freaking out. Still not going to play siege until this is fixed.
---
I‚Äôm the habona
---
no, he has to be lying.
---
Well, they werent able to disable breaching charges from shield operators when there was a glitch that needed them both. It means bad news for us my friend..
---
Also i am playing in pc plat, so people probably take this game more seriously in there than on console
---
So basically fortnite lobby
---
What if you pick the same ops?
---
It‚Äôs the idea of somebody designed to beat you up close with a kit that either feels underpowered or overpowered. As someone who NEVER plays shields I feel they are overpowered. This is magnified because I usually play solo.
---
I was thinking of using a select fire  button since DMR are semi auto anyway
---
This ja√´ger remembered his acog unlike in game ja√´ger.
---

Sick Bro!
---
I‚Äôm just tired of seeing the same thing over and over again
---
This would be awesome
---
ash shot you through the window
---
For me, I play on PS4 and never really had a problem with toxicity. Maybe I got lucky, but it seems like it's less of a problem than people think. (To me. Maybe it is that bad and I haven't seen it.)
---
They have a system like this in Rocket League. I think it would work well in siege!
---
To be fair you shouldn‚Äôt have played ranked knowing this glitch existed.
---
Not sure, I haven‚Äôt played pc in a while but it is rampant on Xbox
---
N.O. ACOG removal does not balance an operators pick rate. It does nothing. The whole purpose of ACOG is to stop defenders being op and holding tight and long angles the entire round which you can't see without an ACOG.
---
Yes finally able to show off my doc outfit, I‚Äôm not good enough to see in MVP lmao.
