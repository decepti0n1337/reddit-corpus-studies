That's intentional though

My aim was pretty bad, but I'm still proud of it

How does this not get removed? When I post memes on this sub it gets removed
---
I was all a tremor when I was left with 2 HP
---
I thought the same but theres some youtubers who advertise this, if it's really a scam I think that it shouldn't be allowed for them to advertise a scam site that is why i was with doubts.
---
For what purpose. The shield barely deflects anymore and it's not like his shield is up while he reloads.
---
I love that he gets vote kick intatied
---
That‚Äôs intended.
---
South roof for life

What about this is funny? It's been posted here since the conception of this subreddit and, if you look close enough, he blatantly stole it from 9gag. This is cringe and my guess is that he's 12-14 and plays on console. I'd love to be proven wrong.

Imagine being bad about that ^ü§°

About to say that
---
He forgot his ID
---
Still a shield. What if that one bullet your shield stops as you run outta ammo is what gives you enough time to move into cover. 
---
Its not worth changing it to auto.  None of the guns should auto reload imo
---
&gt; not like his shield is up while he reloads.
---
That‚Äôs the point. Reloading automatically would expose him.
---
So why doesn't blitz do that. His shield is even worse.
---
That is about as much enthusiasm as I put in to my job lol
---
Blame ubi
---
RFF changed. If they down you and THEY revive you then they don't get RFF
---
It should. There's not a hard counter that's why they nerfed TF out of his shield.
---
Evil eye firerate buff
---
The real crime here is that loadout boi
---
Yeah i know it, what i don't understand it's how  people people can advertise this on youtube channels if it's against their terms of services.
---
It wasnt an accident tho
---
I dont get it... why you show the original one ??
---
Princess blackbeard at your service
---
At least the trash bag isn't white.....
---
Lol congrats
---
well done  my friend
---
I really wanna know if they actually did. Probably not
---
Is this a banable offense or no
---
That‚Äôs great
---
What‚Äôs a bigger pain in the ass is attacking garage without a thermite, cctv without a thatcher or captiao, etc etc. 
---
Jackals annoying but not strong. There‚Äôs much better options but people in ranked don‚Äôt care about tactics.
---
I just joined this sub reddit not even an hour ago, and I took a screenshot of the movie part, but I guess I didn‚Äôt see this watermark. I‚Äôm sorry that I don‚Äôt waste my life looking at reddit memes to know it‚Äôs already been posted.
---
Didn't realize it was a repost, that was the first time I had seen it

now I will be very afraid to go down the stairs at home

Hey is this on console?
---
Sledge taking the day off.
---
yes, xbox.
---
VIRGIL WHAT'S UP BROTHER

I doubt this will ever happen considering Sony themselves sell an mnk emulator for console games called that hori tac pro on their playstation store. It's basically a xim the way it emulates a controller just with a pre set mnk
---
No

I wear the unicorn helm with the hazmat suit body and let me just tell you it is hard to be stealthy in that getup.

Whats the og video?

Definitely going to do this now. If you are the winning team can you still do it?
---
Groundbreaking stuff detective
---
Can someone explain to me how rubber banding happens? I've experienced it a couple times myself, and a guy in the comments described it pretty well, but just as an explanation...what causes it?
---
Thing is, this would force the dev team at ubi to design what ectoplasm would look like on new guns, this doesn't seem problematic at first, but when more and more universal weapon skins come out along with more and more guns, this would take up a lot of time. I'm not disagreeing and I love the event skins as much as the next guy, but ubi is a company. Meaning that they can't 100% cater to the fanbase's every request and that they have deadlines for when new seasons and such come out.
---
I see you're a man of OH YEAH as well
---
It's the same with the SMG12
---
Oh yes, like pulse now
---
If ur looking thru my comment history then you already lost ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
She has one of the highest win rates, she doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
Maybe they meant the April fools event where they had the octopus?
---
they've shown weakness and I smell it. It's very similar to my own smell of weakness.
---
But a low pick rate. It would make her more atttractive i imagine.
---
Oh. yeah!
---
South roof gang
---
Hahahaha you are so brain dead. Look at your shit face in your reddit profile picture. Mitch_Comer, you look like you are starving man. Stop with the cringey YT vids and maybe eat something and go to the gym so you can look like me, your owner.
---
Lol ok. Why do you think there‚Äôs a section on Ubisoft help page that says ‚Äúmy account got hacked‚Äù. It is still possible OP got hacked into or ACTUALLY didn‚Äôt know they were teamed up with a booster
---
Icronic.
---
Lol he mad that the teammate did something that wasn't normal. Always expect the unexpected
---
Yes
---
I get a warning for typing mong, I dont know if that is a split or not.
---
atttttttttttractive?
---
Yep
---
Umm no as I said 100horizontal and 50ads
---
Either way I feel like this would be a fun little game haha. Like instead of one octopus, 5 for each person
---
Yeah rest is somewhat logical. Not banning the mains of your teammates is good. Fucking shocking. 
---
But the logic of "we defend first, so fuck over attack operators" is false. You are on the same position when the sides swap. Yes, you would only need to win 1 to win the game if your defense goes well. So? Then you won more attack rounds than the enemy, bans don't change that. You deserved the win then. And what if the attackers win against your advantage? Then you need to win even more extra disadvantageous attacks. Both teams are in the same position.
---
This comment is unnecessary
---
If you knew who I was you'd know that I was starved growing up and locked in a room against my will for years .

Better music sync than half the people on their desktops around here, honestly.

Man i got a 120hz screen and i put it on full screen my fps got crazy more than 200

To quote Michael Jackson, "Just Beat it".

Both monitors would need to run at 144hz. Even then some games just won‚Äôt allow it in borderless.
---
I like it low key
---
Second world war
---
Nice
---
This makes Tachunky look mighty chunky
---
I play ranked in mid-high Platinum and honestly I don‚Äôt feel like Jackal is banned as often in higher Elo. Banning Jackal is comfort thing, and in higher ranks people will be more likely to do a tactical ban, such as thatcher, instead of a comfort ban, like Jackal, Cav, Blitz, etc...
---
Thasa very low level for a year of playing

Lol u weak ass karma boy

Oh shit it is!

It's a joke. Since people think high sense is mouse and key, get it?

She already has a high win rate as well so I don‚Äôt see a reason for this buff

üëå
---
I never ban them. I love Echo and Lion. I ban Monty, and Rook/Mira depending on the map.
---
Nobody should find this funny.  Its posted at least 15 times a week. Slightly different captions dont make it a good joke or funny meme.
---
Not bad
---
Bruh
---
For a beginner yes when you get more experienced then you can experiment a little more
---
You misspelled 'shitty'
---
Thermite breach charges don‚Äôt count as team kills for the system since it‚Äôs really hard to die to them unintentionall
---
I‚Äôve been using Nokk and Warden. Nokk is good for flanking make sure to spawn different than team and use suppressor
---
Depends what you‚Äôre looking for. The ARX is kind of like the Type 89 (Hibana‚Äôs gun) where you trade higher damage and Rate of Fire for 20 less bullets, but I prefer the AK due to the aforementioned higher magazine.
---
Yeah okay bud. It‚Äôs nearly 2200, I don‚Äôt have the energy to argue with you lol. I‚Äôd encourage you to re-read your post, especially the second paragraph as I‚Äôve already pointed out. Good luck tho ‚úåÔ∏è
---
you literally stole this it was posted 1m ago
---
If he didn't know your exact location every 5 seconds for 3 minutes it would be fine.
---
Did you check the BOSG itself? I didn't get any notifications that I had actually received the skin, it was just there.
---
He didn't need a buff, and he shouldn't be used as a breacher.
---
How do I do that shrugging emoji
---
Shields are OP! Nerf glaz!

If you wanna use Caviera you're gonna need map knowledge. Play through all maps a whole bunch on T-hunt. As for guides,YouTube is as always a gold mine along with this subreddit(sometimes) and the R6S official website

Why is the barrel on Thermites gun so short and also imma have to try that rook loadout lmao. Red dot, suppressor and vertical grip would definitely get me screamed at.

Fuze can‚Äôt be killed silly
---
I see, game has 20 maps will be challenging get to know them but i find her very fun to play soooo
---
Why? It takes less than a minute usually to re queue. Just queue for another game. Problem solved.
---
(insert long winded rant about how you stole this post)
---
Look like someone is a one trick pony
---
That‚Äôs literally the reason Ubisoft tells you to use two step verification. Literally for that exact reason. So yeah, his account deserves to be banned. If he cares about his account that much he should‚Äôve protected it

The real one (aside from having cosmetics and weapon attachments) will have an idle animation of rocking back and forth slightly, just like every operator. They also don‚Äôt ADS

I think that's probably the same thing that causes the window debris issues. The player transmits a message to all other players saying "I just fired a shotgun round from position A-B-C aimed at point X-Y-Z". The other players then calculate locally what kind of destruction that causes. That way, the server is spared from having to calculate the physics of the damage, and everyone is spared the bandwidth of what the resulting damage looks like. In theory, that's brilliantly efficient, but there is probably some degree of imprecision with the coordinates that allows for a slight de-sync. Or you can have packet loss issues from the person that does the damage.
---
Was 3 Teammates down the entire game, still pushed it to overtime, lost the last round when they went lion, jackal and dok. Got a message saying "u suk" I was 14 and 2. He was 0 and 8
---
Smash or pass
---
Who is they? Vote to kick isnt monitored by a person. It is just a simple voting system.
---
Make Warden's ability constantly on. But when flashed, his visor will emit a loud sound like Dokkaebi so attackers will know where he is.
---
which roles do you play?
---
Eh, I can see your point, but honestly they'd just start using someone else for the same idgaf attitude. He's my go to on certain maps where I'm no longer tryhardibg (losing hard, team are assholes, whatever) and want to just try something unexpected to catch them off guard.
---
Kitchen on Kafe is a fun one especially when you've avoided playing him all game. Just set up behind the window looking west at the last moment, you're almost guaranteed a kill at bakery door. If it's the carrier they stall out and you can often clean up if they're not careful.
---
It is. But even worse, some shitty instagram account put there own watermark on it after taking it.
---
?
---
I maimed Jackal all the way until this season and I've been plat 1 for the past year. I'll help in any way I can, and if you want we can take it to PMS.
---
1. Don't keep your visor activated all round: Not only does the purple-ish color mess with your vision, when you get shot it messes up your screen like you've been jammed by a mute scanner.
---
2. Drone, and I mean drone *a lot. * This may seem obvious but as Jackal your No. 1 priority is roam clearing. In other words, either kill all the roamers, or scare them back to the Objective. This will not only benefit your team, it mentally calms your mind knowing that you have a lower chance of getting flanked. #Get_Flanked.
---
3. Map out what you're going to do before the Prep phase begins. This of course takes practice and map knowledge, but as you learn the maps try to figure out stats. "hey there's usually a person here so if I put my drone here and attack from there I should be able to kill them." is generally a good place to start. This step is crucial at getting really good at Jackal.
---
4. Don't dissappear all round. One thing you'll learn over time is you have about a minute and a half of time to yourself *wink wink* which means a minute and a half to mess up the enemies plans as much as possible. Then, once the 1:00 mark hits, you should try and get back to your team and secure the Objective. Jackal has very useful smoke grenades and you should be using them as much as possible when pushing OBJ.
---
5. As mentioned in No. 3, use your drone. A thing I like to do is put my drone in a spot where I know there's a lot of traffic. Ex: Meeting Room on Oregon. I put my drone on top of the White board backstage because it views every door to the room, and it's a very common place for rotates into kitchen, or to get to the other side of the map. Periodically check this drone to gather info if any. It will help tremendously.
---
I can't think of many more tips rather than strategies right now, but I am willing to answer any questions. And willing to accept criticism as well, because Noone is perfect. Have a great night/day everyone.
---
I can see every map to being mad into to the sims besides the Airplane and Base
---
If they banned mozzie is because in the team there is a twitch main and doesnt want that a mozzie steal his drones
---
He didn't need a nerf either. He was pretty well balanced in the higher tiers of play going off of Ubisoft's winrate/pickrate deltas that they released.

isnt all his stuff visible on his bio though? while Nokk EVERYTHING just says [REDACTED] and the only info we get is the short simple details Harry (Six) gives us and all the information Dokkaebi gives us about the gadget (because she made it)

I remember the Ela meta, I think there was a season when she had something like a 90-95% pick rate.

Hey atleast you aren‚Äôt the type of person who brings there headset with to piss
---
Have you checked out the subreddit siegeacademy? It‚Äôs a great resource for beginners and advanced players alike.
---
Some quick tips for you:
---
‚Ä¢Use your drone on attack! Know what‚Äôs ahead of you. You can catch defenders sleeping. It also doesn‚Äôt usually hurt to prefire.
---
‚Ä¢On defense, hold hard angles and don‚Äôt expose yourself so much. Sometimes people know which direction an attacker is coming from but they‚Äôre either too exposed in holding their angle, or push an attacker that is already prepared. 
---
‚Ä¢Defense on bomb can almost be a waiting game. If it‚Äôs down to the wire, try to force attackers to plant instead of trying to get the kill(s). This again plays into holding hard angles, or even hiding and being ready to kill the planter (prefire or a nitro). This doesn‚Äôt work in every situation (like if the attack clearly has the advantage in planting and numbers).
---
When games get popular you get the halo/cod effect.. it's called dumb parents that buy their underaged toddlers shooter where they need to interact with adults from which a good chunk is even older than their parents.
---
Don‚Äôt you mean that reload animation?
---
I still don‚Äôt get the Echo ban. Well I do, but for the most part people ban him based off a thing he rarely gets to do in the first place, which is deny the plant which is kind of stupid considering you are banning off of a rare possibility. IMO Maestro is tougher to deal with because he has a better gun, his gadget requires more utility to take out, can see through smoke, and actually do damage to the player. C‚Äômon people, play more IQ. She counters literally almost every defense op and can be a fragger after being support. Let Echo live. I‚Äôm convinced Ubi buffed him a while back just so he could be comparable to Maestro instead of making Maestro pure Power Creep.

Man? Girl? Is this discrimination against gender ohmaga

I feel like Casual and the old ranked were very similar other than a less limited map pool. When you say ‚Äúmore like old ranked‚Äù do you mean to keep it how it is now or add a rank for casual?
---
I‚Äôd say the mirror is to small other wise good
---
Wdym all I see is a normal room
---
They're good but not great coz your playtime and rank is low....see if you can maintain that kd up to like level 200
---
It would be a pretty neat if the nitro cell/smoke canisters would blow up by his torch, then you could leave them as traps on the reinforced walls and hope he hits one.

Downside, teammates get splash damage (probably more damage than mav would take)

He already is. His hipfire is getting made worse and his melee is being made useless. While a very experienced Monty is hard to deal with, that‚Äôs how every operator works. A new glaz player may be ‚Äòez gut gud scrub‚Äô, but an experienced glaz is hard to deal with even after his rework.
---
For someone at your level, absolutely. Having a 1.2 K/D is very good, although it will likely go down over time due to the nature of how averages work with playtime. 
---
Either way, it‚Äôs very impressive
---
Tv in bathroom, problem solved.
---
till i bring the extended barrel
---
Thanks, the only problem is I don't play as often so my skills may slip.
---
This is on casual or rank? 
---
Both have different matchming points.
---
Keep it as is, but increase round count, add 3 round switch, and you select sites you defend. All that good stuff. Maybe just exclude the pick/ban. This way, it‚Äôs more laidback, but still staying fairly true to what Siege is, I feel.
---
No skill? Play Montagne for longer than half a round and you‚Äôll figure it takes more than just pressing w to win

Where is the supreser

They can't afford to do that, if someone is having a LAN party for example that would mean there is a possibility that only one of them could go online and play.

If so add me "opressedzombie" i can give you some tips

At level 82? That's some mad luck bruh
---
Hello EffTheRealLife, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/chk4h7/keep_playing_as_team_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
True, I guess there really is no counter to smurf accounts.
---
Mad or bad, that's the question. I have like 6 black ice on PC but console? Nah, screw me I guess, Ubisoft.
---
She doesn‚Äôt replace anyone in the team comp in general especially if the team is pushing for 2 Hard Breachers and 1 Soft Breacher. 
---
The other two tends to be filled by Thatcher, Zofia, Ashe, Monty and Twitch (and few others). 
---
Other Flanking operators are much more efficient overall. 
---
Don‚Äôt want Defenders to know your position? Twitch can send in drones to take out every cams within the area. IQ running around locating hidden cams before crouch walking into obj is far more threatening than Nokk will ever be. 
---
Other Attackers have damage and range advantage along with gadget that helps them to fight Defenders. Nokk only has her gadget and yet it‚Äôs not difficult to counter her.
---
Barricading a couple of entry points and a single barbed wire takes away most of her power. Lesion doesn‚Äôt even gets banned that often either. 
---
The moment Anchors hold angle against her, Nokk has nothing. She‚Äôs not fast enough to quickly change her position nor does she has damage/range for straightout gun fight. 
---
Ubi‚Äôs own data showing her to be the second worst Attacker (first being Glaz who‚Äôs getting buffed) just shows how underwhelming she is.
---
I love playing rook, purely because I place the plates, reinforce and then if I die I still helped my team. Also P90
---
*thotiana plays*
---
This looks more like pyramid head. Nice
---
Bust down
---
Amazing. Mission complete. That right there is why you're the best, boss.
---
Lol what is this from???
---
Your in the club and this dude slaps ur girls ass wyd
---
You said it was up to us
---
This is a glitch that's been around for a very long time
---
Because it is completely irrelevant. I like playing Favela, but it's probably the map most unsuited for ranked.
---
I poop usually once a day but today is different, it is my 4th today. What do you guys think? This one kinda looks like the hitreg in Siege.
---
Thanks for the offer, but on ps4. I'll have a go with those tips though
---
no one cares
---
Alright so just stare at the walls the whole game waiting for a maverick to blowtorch the wall because you sure as all can't hear that shit.
---
A lot of people do like the map (including me) but with all the windows that you can spawn peek through and how most of the objs are defender based just makes the map terrible, if they can fix those issues then it could be a decent map.
---
I'm assuming this is legit and not a whoosh.
---
Distributed Denial Of Service. Basically, the person gets a botnet to make a bunch of connetions to a server and hog up all the bandwidth so that legit connections can't get through and will be dropped.
---
remember when we had to buy attachments
---
Because they want to save there drone of course. I don't need to risk my drone to spot the objective when I know the map.
---
Being afk in prep as Twitch or just parking the drone in a spot is just a smart thing to do. Especially when the opponent has a Mozzie or other OPs that want to fuck with your drone.
---
So one reason I know people do this is so that the opposing team does not know there is a twitch operator.
---
Secondly, she only has two drones, if it is shot early, you're down one before the match even starts.
---
Now why don't they move it into position relatively close to their spawn or close to the objective is beyond me. 
---
I like to hold back about 2-3 rooms or a little outside objective without going in and if they have a Mira or bandit, etc. Something to really screw them up, I will go in early or wait until 20 seconds in when people are starting to really move in and not focus on their placed utilities. Very rarely will I use a twitch to attack a player unless I know their health or I know doc is not in the picture.
---
Ubi promised they will release the new deployable shields in THIS season
---
Cant wait to see, looking forward to your good news
---
2 Words, Shit bucket.
---
Or they save the drone for the action phase, because thats the smart thing to do..
---
Or they should use the drone to destroy traps after the objective has been located
---
Any public related profiles he is using can be used as a source of what he is using, with goo amount of back tracking in his profiles, he might have slipped up any information that will lead to his account like email address, username or friendlist. or if they are lazy, find their IP address then see any accounts logging in with that ip and remove that accounts access to the skin.
---
WTF
---
PRAISE BE
---
Thanks
---
Does that mean that enemies are also loaded into the game 3d space when the mvp screen is showing?
---
As of lately cheats have moved on from vaulting now they can just teleport around the map and fly without having to interact with vaulting. I don‚Äôt know how tf they figure this shit out.
---
tldr: overloading the server with a lot of connections at once
---
Echo is balanced but Jackal is real SHIT. He can track you for a grand total of 1m15s, almost half a round.

Not really. The opponent can place there gadgets later so you shouldn't  use all your zaps immediately. Especially when there is no IQ and no Thatcher.

You appear to be children. You must be the type of kids who I mute all the time for squeaking racist/homophobic or edges phrases into the mic.
---
Yeah the only guns that have black ice are the ones that belong to the original operators.
---
You mean how he sprints at you with it up? Its so he can rush in while still having some protection from bullets.  
---
You're still able to shoot his legs and it could be much worse as they could have made it so all the shield operators could run with it up, or I'm not 100% sure if this is true or not but I think there were plans while the game was still in development to make it so instead of droning during prep phase he would just rush in while the defenders were still placing everything down.
---
It's just not the same...
---
And you're making pc players look like dickheads. Nice job. Super impressive.
---
Fair enough, but it's certainly silly to hate a map for reasons that are your own fault entirely.
---
I fear no man . But that thing.....it scares me

Damn amazing cosplay!

ExplosiveBody12, I used to play with him - he might not remember me but I‚Äôve still got him added

This must be the work of an enemy Stand-user.

I dream of the day when i stop bouncing between the various copper ranks :D Good Job!
---
Clearly you were not playing this game back when packs were first introduced. Oh, and how weird, i also got black ice on fuze's lmg, almost like they knew no one plays fuze and even less with the lmg and just wanted to give you hope/tease you to buy more packs. My facts are the ACTUAL research that went into calculating drop rates based on youtube pack openings. The numbers speak for themselves, but i bet you didnt even know drop rate were calculated cause every na kid thinks he's smart on this website when he's pulling facts out of his asshole, typical na mentality.
---
You got a link to buy it?
---
Wait until you get -100+ for making a joke and not saying /s rookie
---
Say what you want about hacking during matches, but that shit's funny
---
I dread the day
---
Honestly, I don't know about the way you are roaming, but I usually prefer to play together with my teammates, playing off of each other's backs and helping each other out. This helped me to outplay Jackal and any other roamer hunter.
---
And as a solo roamer I "simply" out move them.
---
If you might be wondering, it is on platinum
---
I bet I can smash him like I smash soft walls and her ex Ying.
---
With the buffs, Glaz might get the higher pick/win rate than Nokk soon. 
---
Even Fuze and Blitz has higher win rates than Nokk currently according to Ubi's own data. 
---
Though I personally would rather have a good Nokk over Fuze in my team.
---
I believe if you purchase one of their headphones it comes with it, but I'm not exactly sure. I was just using one of their headphones and found it lying around one day.
---
That would just make people knock you over run up to you and then knock you over again and just keep knocking you over until you died and it would extremely annoying and make people hate them way more than they already do. They don‚Äôt need nerfs.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs ruff people on reddit have a dull sense of humor and apparently don‚Äôt know what sarcasm is. (I‚Äôve only been on here for around 2 months)
---
Alpha packs are an easy way to burn out your renown, thus making you impulsively buy credits to balance it out. It's literally a basic marketting technique.
---
Damn, I'm using HyperX
---
I expected redditors to be like 200 IQ when it came to obvious jokes, sad to see the ugly truth
---
Tbh it's great that this happens shows they're actively  involved in the community as such.
---
Cool, just making sure its not just me lol Last night was perfect, playing fine then its all gone down the drain today. Think thats what I need, just take a break from siege a while maybe. Can't help but feel shite sometimes
---
you're actually the type of guy to unironically say "chanka turret on main door?? copper strats bud, cringe"
---
Practice the hell out of it in Terrorist Hunts.
---
I have. Just because it takes time doesn't mean it can't be done. They are getting paid for it.
---
You look more like pyramid head from silent hill.
---
i got this too! too bad im perma banned for nothing.
---
He still gets banned a lot when you look at the pick rates of this season... He is the most picked operator taking into the band into account
---
Got any social media links? Like Instagram or something like that
---
It's completely factitious. If you're in a solo terrorist hunt and looking at nothing, the game runs at the highest resolution it can handle. As soon as literally anything on screen happens it reduces resolution dynamically. It never runs at anything higher than 1080p during real gameplay and from experience, goes even lower under heavy scenes to attempt to keep 60 fps (multiple smoke effects alone can do this)
---
Of course, Jackal is incredible. He has outstanding weapons, and a great ability. On larger maps like Bank, yeah he is always a must ban, but on smaller maps like Oregon I rarely see him banned
---
:O
---
I'm on PS4 EUS and I just found a game after 1 minute.
---
YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED TUBER SIMULATOR?!?
---
People tend to pick no vote because they don't know what's the best site or they just don't care which site you choose. If your playing solo then I would suggest that you'd play something your comfortable with. And of course you pick operators wich are best for the site so there is no harm  playing mira in only one site because it could help you win the round.
---
I think you're not paying attention. The first thing in the link is a chart that says Deluxe Edition gets the base ops and year 1 ops
---
Shes fine.
---
clear satisfaction
---
I don't think it was available for renown? I remember people spending money on it.
---
Yeah, pc has more recoil but can be controlled more easily.l, due to using a mouse which can make more rapid adjustments to vertical and horizontal recoil
---
It's recoil control. In Pro League it looks like they don't have recoil at all
---
Your opinion is wrong.
---
just for my knowledge, what operators can counter him? or arent there any
---
The Started Edition was the most purchased version on Steam.
---
I can confirm fuze is immune to bullets
---
Whats the name of this movie
---
Warden is from western....so i dont understand
---
For australians everything is upside down ofcourse, maybe their logic is twisted too....?

If you say nerf Glaz one more time some cheeks are gonna have to be claped
---
Why cosplay myself when others do it better
---
gj !
---
Really good! But lion needs to be more thicc imo
---
if i may ask, what is the problem here? something with those ranks?? (im not very skilled at the game dont know much ab it yet)
---
found the sweat
---
What was their ign?
---
Because you don‚Äôt care about the game as much. It‚Äôs the same for most others. When you first get it you don‚Äôt care if you win or lose because you‚Äôre new. After a break that long it‚Äôll be sorta the same feeling, as you won‚Äôt care as much about your rank. People in lower ELO tend to focus more on having fun in the longer games of ranked than in the short games of casual.
---
It‚Äôs psychological. Give it a bit longer when you really start getting serious again and all the fun will be lost to you trying to get better
---
You can use them when the team is forced to move. If you're planting defuser you can use your ability to allow the defuser to be planted. Plus it will stop roamers from moving if you're pushing into the obj.
---
Because bronze/silver players are not try harding all the time.
---
1719 hours.
---
Actually on pc if you have a mic and everyone in your game has a mic then your really not solo queueing anymore
---
Just like Moscow theater.
---
I don't think that I should have to worry about people ruining the game for me.  I'd prefer a better way of removing the people who try and ruin the game for others.
---
Not in proleague. There the buffs aren't very useful since they can perfectly control recoil, know when to ads, don't need to reload all the time, and health doesn't help when hitting headshots. And then there's the negative of hearing dampening. That is a huge minus in proleague.
---
What does ign mean?
---
&gt;jAcKaL iS oP1!11!1
---
lol look at the pro league charts, his ban rate is way lower than it usually is. people just like to complain about him because they wanna roam safely, but when they get killed by a roamer, they wish they had a Jackal
---
Yeah Arma is a great game it seems cool but for me I rather watch than play cause it seems complicated
---
In Soviet Russia you don't fail mission, mission fails you
---
their name
---
Get cheating ad on YouTube. Complain about said ad, WHILE advertising it then on Reddit. Genius
---
Toebli
---
Maybe Warden?
---
ign = ingame name
---
&gt; Toebli
---
No such player
---
but what is bad about this?
---
It's quite fun knowing that Tower is a Korean map and there are only two choices: south or north.
---
You may not see it, but Ubisoft does. And yeah, that's what everyone says until the pro's come up with some strategy and then everyone and their mom does it. 
---
However shield got delayed because it was returned by internal testing that the Mira like deployable shield was too strong. So they made it so you can see if someone is behind the shield now. What would be the counter to the previous incarnation of it? Toss a smoke grenade near it.
---
Also your trying to make it out as if Warden is suppose to be run every round. He is not. He's meant to be used when a team relies a full stack of smoke's and flash-bangs with possibly Ying. If your expecting a operator to fully overpower existing ones, then you don't get the design philosophy behind operators.
---
Lol, I don‚Äôt have such hight tech equipment to make such an edit. Good idea though!
---
New pricing system? Could you elaborate more? I couldn't play for about 6 months and I still can't for the next month.. I'm kinda delayed about the updates pls
---
Hearts were broken that day!

Well say you are holding a window and Blackbeard is peaking a small hole in it but he has the black headgear on is it still as easy to see as it would be in daylight.

no it would be harder, but how is that a bad thing?
---
Found a mistake ?
---
I added the Ban percentages and it is rounds up to 200% (2 attacker ban per game) 
---
But I also added the pick percentages and it is only 498% and it should be 500% (5 attacker pick per game) 
---
So is this wrong, or it means in every 50th mach there are 1 disconnected attacker ?
---
This, I don‚Äôt mind if it doesn‚Äôt add onto kills.
---
It gives just that player an advantage due to a random chance.
---
And thats y i stop ranked after grinding to plat this season and past few seasons.
---
F2
---
But smoke is more useful than fire in planting
---
Wow these are awesome! My favourites are the Scorpion and the G36C!
---
I get it now but 2 characters named the same thing even in different languages and both are defenders
---
What‚Äôs the issue my man?
---
The red represents the percentage of times that an operator is banned.
---
The gold represents the percentage of times that an operator is picked.
---
It‚Äôs shown in a highest percentage to lowest percentage slope.
---
Time for a conspiracy! Maybe he brought his headset with him and Ubi HQ was listening in. Kicked him for "inactivity" but in reality, they just didn't want him to bring his headset while he was 360 no-scoping the porcelain throne.
---
Warden cannot be picked in pro league yet :Warden left the chat:
---
Still looks better than my laptop

+ you can accidentally counter recoil too much not hitting the headshot
---
Poor devs. They need to get more sleep instead of working so hard :(
---

---
Can he get rappel kills while skydiving though
---
Gotta disrespect the only time they had a polished game
---
I‚Äôm saying this is more like a big fix imo than a nerf
---
You are forgiven for that
---
I think you should care tho. I'm bottom of gold rn and really new to the game so take what I say with a grain of salt but there are some operators which simply don't work on some sites. Look at Mira, you can end up making the game more difficult to your own team if the site isn't compatible with her and you put down bad mirrors. Some operators as far as I can tell don't work on some sites. If you wanna play an op really bad then vote for a site which works good with them. Take a look at my previous example, if I wanna play Mira, that means I don't vote for CEO. Don't vote for what others want you to, vote for what works for your op, but don't pick no vote because you can only make a situation worse with that imo
---
Yes we know, this bundle gets reposted at least 1 time per month
---
Nothing to hate about Lion. Nothing to downvote for.
---
How sad can you actually get, get a life lmao
---
Yeah. The fmg sucks ass. Feels bad man.
---
It's good imo that they gave her something weak to start with, so she wasn't broken on release. But she does need to be able to outgun the defenders. I'm actually fine that she lacks an acog, cos she doesn't really need to hold angles. But she should at least have something to be feared with. 
---
Cav is scary because even without the element of surprise her smg can *fucking shred*! That's scary.
---
But a Nokk without the element of surprise is *not* scary. A weapon that I would want Nokk to have out of preference would be Mira's vector. Now **that** would make Nokk scary. Either that or Bandits smg. 
---
I'm no expert on balance. But Nokk is imo one of the funniest operators to play. But for that to actually happen the stars need to aline. And you get in a situation where defence aren't just hard angle holding.
---
Idk, man. Idk.
---
That im sure no one misses.
---
Alright
---
I figure irons might be best on such a small screen to not get your vision completely obstructed by a scope housing

---
Simply amazing.
---
I‚Äôve never done it myself but I believe you just have to be in the vault action/animation when the mvp screen starts to pop up
---
You can do this with sledge without hacks, just jo out window when game ends and run to mvp area and kill them all.
---
Good luck. :)
---
I think it's just laser sight. If u mean the moment he goes throught the wall to next bombsite holding a pistol. And when he kills buck it's just red cross as kill confirmation. Otherwise I haven't noticed anything else.
---
I'm a sick Buck I like the quick Buck
---
That's happened to me a few times, I have to restart my PC to solve it.  No idea what does it, I'll randomly have really, really crappy FPS and lag.  I normally have no issues with Siege, and I'll start it up and get like 20 FPS.

It is still considered online

Mom's spaghetti? Idk, I tried.

Don‚Äôt forget finger mouse
---
Personal preference is the major key for sure. But when the majority of people hate the red dot, I was curious. I find that the holo actually takes up more of the enemy‚Äôs body than the red dot, so I was wondering if I was crazy or not haha.
---
I hate to say this but these are really good. You should try make custom skins.
---
You think it's me connection? My ping like 33 most games.
---
I agree, instead of nerfing it should have just giving defending operators the ability to destroy it.
---
I guess you are right but i havent played in awhile and last i played i remember alot of echo players playing rather aggressively and not really using their drones
---
Well if that‚Äôs toxic then you‚Äôre in for a treat trust
---
Shotguns in general aren't pick since SMG's are far more versatile. That said, almost every shotgun can be very effective if you play to its strengths properly. Pulse shotgun is very effective along with Ela shotgun. I don't think I can name a bad semi auto shotgun unless you plan on running Thermite shotgun. For pump shotguns, the GIGN, GSG9 and SAS shotguns are all the best and can 1 hit kill at surprising distances. I'd probably avoid the SuperNova and ITA12L.
---
I always get killed immediately as Blitz. ;(
---
When does it come out?
---
Yeah I thought the saw thing. I use the ARX and to me it feels like the obviously better gun (PC). The only advantage being capacity. Now that the AK is getting the birthday skin, its like Ubi is confirming the AK is the weaker choice.
---
Video?
---
Look at the top right...
---
Either keep saving till 1 mill or spend it on AP. You're looking at about 150 so far.
---
This used to be a feature in the game but people abused it and would have someone leave the game if they were losing so they didn‚Äôt lose as much elo
---
But if it is a 4v5 the whole game or if u have less then 5 people you will lose less just not as significant of an amount
---
I don't understand why actually good clips get so few upvotes but some shitty aces with shit aim but a ton of luck get into the 4 digits.

OI, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ! I'M IN A  WHEELCHAIR, COONT!
---
Again, the question is why is it considered offline. If there‚Äôs no other players then there no point to it being offline
---
Post it for a 3rd time in a row now
---
Why do it?  You don't know which site to choose or don't care.  It's a way of conveying, "It doesn't matter much to me which option we pick, so I'll leave the decision to those who do feel more strongly."  I'll do it occasionally if we are down to two bad sites and pick an op that works for both.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What I don't get is why does it bother you?  If people do it, it just becomes more likely you get the site you voted for.  You are now 1 of 4 votes used to determine the site (or maybe even the sole vote).
---
Blitz- His character seems like he's pretty funny.
---
Lesion- He's already prepared for the post-mission BBQ
---
Nomad-Likes to travel
---
Mozzie- Dude's badass

Hostage is actually a manequin used for testing Matryoshka's

That was what you said, as you seem to have forgotten. Terrorist hunt is not strictly multiplayer. That's all.

I don't remember exactly in I could hear him or not but having my friends shoot every which direction and troll each other on Team speak it was hard for conscious seran to know where he was while tactical seran took control.
---
I don‚Äôt know I didn‚Äôt make it an online game I was just saying it was.
---
Yep this is a daily occurrence for me too, on NEU servers üôÑ
---
500/1000/1500/2000 for each basic one per CTU.
---
You had some season pass, which is 10% off any item and remembered it wrong, too. 1500-150 (10%) = 1350 Thats what you paid for your third one per CTU
---
Ever heard of crediting the artist also ? And no don't say you found it on Instagram or you've posted it because you find it funny
---
Find new boys
---
Wtf that is very unfortunate
---
Like I was saying with latam, he is either the most or one of the most banned attackers in that region. You really see how strong he is in those situations.
---
As for mira, pros aren't super concerned with her. Shes easy enough to counter, but they would rather not give defenders that extra tool to work with. Every team has strats with and without her, they just practice without her more and feel more comfortable with those strats.
---
Cheers!
---
Not all hero‚Äôs wear capes
---
FOMO marketing.  Add loads of temporary items, People buy them because they dont want to miss out on them. Over time these items get rarer and rarer and people realize they dont want to miss out on future stuff so they buy it even if they arent going to use it.
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt mind a buff to her guns but I feel like they wouldn‚Äôt do it
---
Kanal rework leak?
---
They should allow us to put a reflex on her pistol

Where is the hostage ?

Or just not play ranked for the rest of the season

I did it too in para bellum or the one after that I think. I still remember doing an insane ninja defuse with smoke on kafe to secure that 5-4 win.

I played against a kid ranked 7 in the world while i was still in plat 3 is was 3-0 and the we got ddosed lmao
---
It sounds beautiful.

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
---
Kindle let's you catch up on your favorite books when your team is throwing the game.
---
Good for you dude, i was asking as i dont want to reinstall a game that borders on 100GB to play it for 2 hours to then uninstall it agaim.
---
That sucks but he wasn‚Äôt a real diamond. I played against the second ranked player he wasn‚Äôt real tho we got ddosed.
---
Isnt it a average of your season and not just the highest rank reached
---
Fair enough
---
She‚Äôd be too powerful if her guns were stronger. Her gadget is game breaking although it‚Äôs not crucial and she has a strong secondary. I think nomads in a good place, use the arx and it just comes down to landing shots
---
When glaz is never picked for pro league, so he never gets banned, and since nobody ever plays him nobody knows how to counter him
---
No it's the highest rank reached
---
Your ping is sky High and the mpx is like the worst gun in the game
---
This would just be abused though.
---
Yeah just the fact that i got matched against someone with that much elo was stupid
---
I know and the thing that triggered me is that I got that one from an Alpha pack and it's the only one that you can buy also my next black ice was a duplicate black Ice super90
---
Wait, that's not a normal thing?
---
It was, my best tho was last season diamond, we had extremely lucky matchmaking for 12 games in a row and I was able to hold it for two games after that xD then we it stomped until is was one game before plat 2.
---
Here is the download link

Yeah it makes no sense he was prolly 6,000 elo

Ok now this is epic

How to guys have your mains on your accounts ive been trying todo that
---
Arx is the better of the two and what I generally end up using. I just wish the ak was in a better place as ascetically I like it more. I‚Äôd like either a damage increase or reduced recoil. Even if that means dropping the mag size down to 30 from the 40 it has.
---
Yeet
---
I think the recoil is manageable with the reflex. Plus the 40 round mag is great.
---
The ARX is one of my favorite guns in the game. It‚Äôs a cannon.
---
 ICH BRAUCHE SANITATER
---
True say, I've got just over 3k hours logged on Twitch alone and I personally prefer to use the 417 over the F2. The F2 is still a great gun, don't get me wrong, but I think the power and utility of the 417 can often outweigh that of the F2. Plus sometimes I feel the F2 is to easy of a weapon, there's no challenge; the acog, high fire rate and decent mag capacity means it doesn't have any apparent downside apart from the fire rate which, after a while, becomes easy to overcome. However, whatever way you look at it, it's up to user preference - there is no '*right'* weapon to use.
---
Nope ! Swedish map coming with the two swedish operators i created
---
They are fine,  the only buff I could see would be slightly reducing the aks recoil. And I mean slightly.
---
o_O
---
Im almost crying this is so beautiful to see. Gamers like you make gamers like me so happy
---
This isn‚Äôt really a problem in plat, though. Not that the playing experience is all that much better, but for other reasons.
---
Top 5
---
Its an (terrorist) ammo factory sooo yeah XD
---
This is clearly fake because jackal is always banned
---
I've hadn't heard of him until this post.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd suggest.
---
Rip smooth lighting
---
Honestly, slap an extended barrel on it and ADS, you have a beast of a shotgun. I use it in ranked all the time and almost always get 2 kills a round with it. It kills at distances where i probably would have lost a fight with a SMG
---
It would be awesome if they used the factory from Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. Actually a lot of the maps from Raven Shield, Athena Sword and Iron Wrath would be awesome. I want Hacienda. That map is sweet.
---
Um. .98 inch lmao
---
Obs my friend, obs
---
Wow..
---
This is really good! Good job!
---
very cool creation! this is the kinda stuff we upvote, bois
---
He got nerfed so probably less now
---
down to 5 seconds
---
God knows if I could, I would fuck that man
---
Poor souls
---
I didnt even played these games XD
---
Yeah, not gonna lie we did get pretty lucky with matchmaking for at least 5 of the matches. The last match was fucking sweaty as hell though. The entire other team was high plat 3-high plat 2. They slapped us until we brought it back from 1-3. I think half of it is just learning the playstyle of the other team and adapting to them.
---
What if your parents call you for dinner?
---
This is attackers only...
---
Complete map tour very soon !
---
Cancerous
---
just aim at his feet /s
---
Thanks !  :D
---
While I think people leave and get almost nothing in punishment, my squad has lost connection problems fairly often some of which have happened on the final kill of the game not allowing time to reconnect
---
I mean, I do that when I panic so...
---
I guess it's plausible, but it's not enough evidence to be sure.
---
I have the same thing, also clans are annoying and tend to teamkill.
---
no the other team did . i guess they were joking around and everybody pressed it thinking they‚Äôll be the only ones who did it
---
Just a game man
---
I know, just this time I decided a different approach.
---
Always correcting them when they make that stupid mistake which makes no sense, the "of" just means nothing in that sentence.
---
hacker salt is the best salt
---
Thank you &lt;3 I appreciate your kindness :)
---
Plat 3 is basically Gold 0
---
Don‚Äôt solo queue
---
You do it after every single kill?
---
I am not saying Ubisoft should stop working everything and work on this. But I am asking other people who plays more casual than ranked about their opinion. Not everyone wants to play Ranked and current Casual has backfilling problem where I start a game, by the end of selection menu, I can be the only one in the menu and start the game like that(1vs5) or after first round losing a person which not being backfilled can result you fight 4vs5 or worst (3vs5) for the rest of the game. It is same frustration as loving a person in ranked. Intimidation is just for people who leaves constantly, for example people who leaves at the first 10 seconds of the round where he was killed by spawnpeeker. If he leaves 10 times during the day, He will lose 1000renown which is like 1-1.5 hour game play. This is just to make those people to be in the game more in casual but at the same time not hurting much that people who just waiting for their mates to finish a game.
---
I'm surprised at how little she's played. her gun is amazing still and her gadget is really useful. maybe pros just don't want to take the time to drive around destroying gadgets? or maybe they're just really good at spotting and destroying them instantly?
---
They do not consider past ranking I nthe current season
---
It‚Äôs so uneven why. Why do you make my head hurt
---
This would be exploited by having one person leave on a 5 stack to save everyone else‚Äôs rank.
---
Statistically if you play enough, you‚Äôll benefit from leavers just as often as you‚Äôre hurt by them.
---
What's your high score?
---
One above the other?
---
Pretty sure servers were getting ddosed
---
glad to help, also to add multiple and/or text, hit the emojis button next to the text box
---
The problem is that there is no solution siege needs a kick player option but it‚Äôs impossible to make a fair for everyone
---
I love that I'm at the point where I can just "delete" people who are boosting bc they're norm bad and don't deserve their rank
---
his weapon isn't great at all. the LMG has a great sight but DPS/TTK wise it and the Para are in the lower tier of attacker weapons
---
I have reddit.
---
Considering your location I thought you would have a pretty solid connection /s
---
No u :p
---
For the pick rate is it divided into two or even three catagories console and pc or is it all mashed together? Thats where the problem starts. Console and pc need to be seperated from each other to effectively nerf operators for console.
---
Mr. Homeless is the shit
---
if you cant stay in plat while solo queueing you dont deserve plat
---
Because technically I'm homeless!
---
yoyoyo what‚Äôs crackin what‚Äôs crackin. this is a doink chat

Thank you, grapple hook vs rappelling like this other guy said are a bit different. Was gonna say it has to be a grapple hook if true
---
What‚Äôre you looking to know?  I can help out a little!
---
They need to, badly because it just makes ranked a nightmare
---
Idk how to add another one
---
I'll look at it
---
Yep, 50 very 100 horizontal and 10 ads

Ok ive been playing on tv but ill try it

Basically yeah

Thank you very much

when u hit the flair u want and it goes in the text box, look at the right of the text box

or that is a copper queues with plats it will only queue plat players
---
I'm on a phone so I think it's different. I can only add one.
---
Turns out I did actually contribute. huzzah
---
He could just be easily startled, and particularly on that game is what I'm saying. If he does get consistent kills knowing the enemy position beforehand, then it's a consideration. But, I haven't seen the full game, so I don't really know, and this is just my opinion on the subject. :)
---
Yeah that stinks! Honestly if you‚Äôre down any players I think that shouldn‚Äôt count against your win/loss.
---
Wait. Is Mira window on reinforced wall or not üòï
---
looks like this game is still that buggy. haven't been playing this game for months.
---
It is. I was confused about it too
---
Coper yelling noob lol
---
Well It's also a point that the challenges have to be attainable in the first place. You can make all the challenges you want, but if they are unreachable... then what's the point of doing them?
---
Hacks
---
rude, i think? idk what youre trying to say  with this comment tbh, please explain me
---
trust me.. when someone can make an cheat for rainbow he also knows how to make an medium good aimbot.
---
cs is full with c&amp;p kiddies thats why you see clunky aimbots and some other weird shit but 99% not in rainbow well atleast not when they try to play legit like the guy in the video was doing (when he cheated).
---
i dont code cheats myself anymore but i also cant find many sources for rainbow six siege cheats.
---
my guess he is really tense in r6s and get a little release when he kills someone
---
If you look at blue team they should be matching with low plats but they got 2 diamonds, which just isn't the same skill level at all.
---
that‚Äôs different , they messing with the server and messing up the experience for the people playing , me saying ur a homo if u ddos is a joke
---
D:
---
If two people leave a ranked match it shouldn't count for the people who have leavers
---
Mozzie has more replay ability and versatility as a defender. Mozzies primaries are very fun and easy to use while is his secondary shotgun is super good if you want to bring an extra barbed instead of nitro. His gadget is amazing for roaming lurking and anchoring all the same. What more could you want?

Believe you me I know. Battlefield 4 was like 40 or 50 gigs when it came out and now it's up to something like 100 or more. Or maybe it was one of the other battlefields I'm not sure. Why are HDD's so expensive? Can you not even go to a supply and get a cheap school pc to strip?
---
To me this seems like a deliberate choice and not a bug or issue.  To be fair though, there are many other sound bugs so who knows.
---
Dude, Google "server authoritative game development".
---
If I get the same one again I'm quitting Siege on console and going back to my PC glory days.
---
This is how fucking sound works dude...
---
It travels in waves through the air...
---
Yeah. I guess in CoD your K/D does mean something, but it doesn‚Äôt mean much of shit in R6.

Enjoy it, it will be a good memory when your older and dont switch on the boys üëç

I'm debating leaving the clan but I don't want to join something that's not going to help me grow as a player. There's a reason all of our good players left awhile ago.
---
It‚Äôs designed to be like that. It‚Äôs not CoD or battlefield sound. It requires you to have a decent headset and to use your ears.

Hey Sam, I've been watching your channel on YouTube for a month or so now and I gotta say, you deserve more subs. Quick, helpful, unknown things aren't shown anywhere else.

Which is.

Tell him to cut off his dick and shove it up his ass for me

Kinda hard to enjoy the game normally with all the toxicity. This morning I was trying to get some quick matches in before work and this bandit shot my lesion mine and said ‚Äúoh I just shot lesions mine, he‚Äôs mad‚Äù then proceeds to down and kill me while calling everyone the n word in voice chat
---
Not what i expected
---
Made myself )
---
Been there, done that in Kanal, no flashes either because casuals
---
I don‚Äôt see a whole lot to hide behind. The general locations for people are very easy to pick up. There‚Äôs no where to go without triggering a random vantage point. If one wall gets opened it‚Äôs like opening an ant hill lol.
---
Actual good aim on console? Wtf
---
Its hard to argue file size reduction and new characters, new and reworked maps, and new gadgets/guns.  70gb is huge but we as a community would have to sacrifice a lot of new content to shrink the game size and keel it constant.
---
It‚Äôs only bomb because bomb is the most competitive mode, it should have been like this day one honestly probably the best design they made since removing acog from three speeds.
---
Oh oof, uuuuh Hereford then
---
Legit could possibly be a world record
---
Damnnnn nice

I almost expected it to say duplicate

Or if it‚Äôs gonna be a weapon skin, do a random epic or legendary for that operator
---
where else do people store their ladders?
---
Looks like the Cav just died up there
---
Jackal gets banned on maps that it makes since to ban him on like Bank and Villa. Banning Jackal on a map like Chalet makes zero sense.
---
Nah it shouldn't imo. Because the steps can be far from the Jackal
---
Oh flip, how did you do it, if you don‚Äôt mind?
---
I do I have astro A40 TRs the sound is not precise. It's literally a broken directional sound system. And you know it's not just you when you have pros such as shroud that has mentioned the sound being an issue.
---
Is it an unpopular opinion that I find this dudes gimmicky approach to getting views as highly annoying?
---
Mm yes very well written
---
Fair enough but it doesn‚Äôt,or at least shouldn‚Äôt, take 4 people to kill one Cav
---

Actually they announced that they were removing them gave everyone a month or two to purchase for "Fear of Missing out." Then released new ones that would come and go with each season, thus making more people want to buy them because they can't later and it's now a "limited edition collectable."
---
I've been away from the game for a bit, can someone explain the nerf/rework/what happened?

Hello CommunityEdit, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/chsw2o/my_1_issue_with_this_subreddit/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

To improve my aim I like to use aimbooster.com. it really helps with target switching and mouse accuracy, along with reaction time. As for getting to know the maps and when to prefire and such, that just takes time. You'll get there my friend

someone is stressing the server, and if he‚Äôs on defense it‚Äôs likely one of his team mates

Nice! But I wish there was map creating tool or SDK for Siege, like CS:GO has. I actually make maps for CS and I want to make them for Siege.

Hope not. The higher you go, the saltier and competetive people get. I'm quite comfortable just playing the game for fun and tbh I dont even mind being copper at all.

Yeah, Ubisoft removed a bunch of Digital Content packs from the store a while back, most of which were the crossover cosmetics:
---
* [*Assassin's Creed¬Æ* Set](https://youtu.be/2gWUpD6bBy0) for Kapkan.
---
* [*Watch_Dogs‚Ñ¢* Set](https://youtu.be/TbUfmACus6Y) for Ash.

* [*The Division‚Ñ¢* Set](https://youtu.be/RUtDQ7Aq8qQ) for Frost.

* [*Far Cry¬Æ 3: Blood Dragon* Set](https://youtu.be/IRPqU8qAKJc) for Castle.

* [*Ghost Recon¬Æ Future Soldier* Set](https://youtu.be/Ba-_P5iEw-E) for Fuze.

* [*Watch_Dogs¬Æ 2* Set](https://youtu.be/N3WPKijqULw) for Smoke.

* [*Ghost Recon¬Æ Wildlands* Set](https://youtu.be/lO_WBP9-QzA) for Buck.
---
* [*Splinter Cell¬Æ* Covert Set](https://youtu.be/yz21mIObsfM) for J√§ger.
---
Of this set, J√§ger was the only one to get a full pack (weapon skin, charm, headgear, uniform) since most Digital Content bundles back then didn't have uniforms.
---
Apparently it was done due to "[store rotation](https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1933935-Digital-content-got-removed-from-store?p=13691206&amp;amp%3Bviewfull=1#post13691206)" reasons, which is a shame since I had specifically held off on buying the *Wildlands* bundle before Buck's turtleneck was fixed.

Save up Lesion mines, try to stack the highest tower before the match is up.
---
Lesion is top tier, Valkyrie is a strong pick but really excels when you move offsite even just a little.   Caviera is strong at low level/ranked play but she falls of quickly against teams with even small amounts of coordination/teamwork.
---
You mean rappelling ?
---
Pullout game weak 10/10 though
---
No, the joke is I didn't mention a unit of measurement. It's just 6.
---
Its not good enough to replace other operators with better utility or the scorpion at least on PC.
---
I am sorry , What ?
---
still no, the c8 is too strong of a weapon to give an op who cant be seen on cams.
---
This post is against the subreddit rules btw
---
I see you also have the letter glitch xan you tell me what that is
---
Tell that to Vigil. That thing is borderline a rifle anyway.
---
I doubt it is, but it kinda looks like a Minecraft CS:GO map ngl
---
Gee man thanks, sure hope I don't run into one of those 2 on one of the probably 50,00+ Xbox servers
---
It‚Äôs either ash or blitz or both
---
That‚Äôs still related to the site; off-site means anti-roam, anti-flank, etc.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt call Thermite an off site operator because when he breaches he is on the outside wall; it‚Äôs still ‚Äúthe site‚Äù.
---
[Same thing happened to me a couple months back.](https://gfycat.com/uncomfortableaggravatingirishwaterspaniel) At least I got mine when the prep phase ended
---
When was the happy fun event
---
fine idc if thats what u want cool, giving her a c8 is not a good idea. pce
---
I think it would make her a more useful pick in higher ranks give a better fragging potential to a character that has not much else going for them but fragging potential.
---
I was in this game too. The whole lobby was in the thousands, and then our team disconnected.
---
Why? Because he's a useless operator, that's why. Just because some teenagers think it's funny doesn't make it a valid reason to keep it in the game. If they modified his ability to make him useful he could actually be fun to use like other operators instead of being a dead 5th player.
---
One of my pals got banned for it
---
Just seqrch up eternal atake full album the video is by yung woke vro 17
---
That actually would be a pretty interesting counter
---
Neat, now stand further back and try it
---
I‚Äôll try that more often, thx for advice üëçüèΩ
---
HOLY SH*T I GOT MY FIRST GOLD ! Thank you kind stranger QwQ
---
That opinion is unpopular for a reason.
---
Nope, whole team was frozen like this, final round we all got kicked so nah not really buddy
---
drop out of college. play more siege. play even more siege. get diamond. profit.
---
I think so
---
¬ø?
---
Yo thats my house
---
I mean, you could always reach out and have the 15 day ban removed in exchange for reverting your rank to before those games took place. But then again, Ubisoft 14-day banned me for a ranked game that I didn‚Äôt even get to participate in, so your chances are slim.
---
Boo yoo for no kill cam. Dishonor on your family
---
Rape doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs cursed
---
Kinda fucked if you ask me, it‚Äôs no different than a random hacking in your team.
---
I got the Commando in my first one when they came out, and IQ was the only attacker I used most of the time. Rip for you
---
Sweet dreams :')
---
This mans last card was the reverse card he won the entire game
---
The thing is they already did revert the rank, I got a huge mmr chunk and it was around the amount we won with him, 5 minutes after that I got ban.
---
Thank you, my guy.
---
Yes I get what you mean, but in my opinion, so what?
---
If you want a dedicated fragger you aren't taking a 2 speed, you're taking Ash, Iq, or Hibana.
---
On top of this Ash, Iq, and Hibana all have infinitely useful gadgets.
---
Nokk is just simply a wasted pick in higher ranks, I only play gold 1 to plat 3 at my highest, so I still love her and use the fuck out of her, but I see why all those YouTubers that play higher are calling for a buff.
---
Really nice clip, but it's not blood orchid boo it's chimera or after
---
Shh dont tell ubi they gonna nerf Blackbeard again this time he won't have shield oh and Ela - 5 damage
---
I love how it just says "Fuck" above her.
---
Are you saying them being old is a bad thing?
---
Kinda, i mean he was on the same team for around 8 games, and had the same "Chief" name as us so it makes sense but its still fucked.
---
If you are wondering it‚Äôs a foot relaxer for if you‚Äôre feeling anxious ( It‚Äôs not mine it‚Äôs my friends )
---
She has one of the highest win rates on defence, and have you tried the fo 12
---
Blue tunnel is no longer blue. The insanity!
---
And would this not be an adequate buff? Along with the activation of the HEL not making you not be able to hear anything for a second,
---
it was literally my first legendary the last 100 Packs :)
---
I'm in if I can fuze em from below
---
he arched his back because he was trying to hit me.
---
Little did you know but rainbow takes place in the past and is actually a sim for new recruits and you just founds rooks grave
---
Oh I meant I hate as in I want black ice for the gun. It is bad on it though. Just want it for the rarity.
---
Fuze is so much fun
---
Like I hate the guy that got it.
---
You're lucky he didn't hit that...
---
you do 2 sets on a corner so you can crouch through it, the last one you can either make one on the other side of the reinforced wall like a mira window or get a hatch
---
if it's being bandit tricked, you do 1 set only in between 2 reinforcements at the bottom so you can scare away the bandit
---
Diamond tier callout is also ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt peek...Glaz‚Äù
---
&gt;this post have nothing in common with this subreddit
---
Uhhhh he‚Äôs just doing a map idea, just like he (or whoever else) come up with operator ideas
---
I‚Äôm not new and I use the 417 but that‚Äôs because I usually prefer dmrs
---
Hey stop flexing with your 2+ plus black ice
---
That's actually pretty good. Even a 1.0 is above average, if you count TKs and falling.
---
Damn
---
Bruh, my bi-curious amigo and I were teamkilled the whole game and got messaged that we sucked, we were sucking that game but the whole team was and my bi-curious amigo and I single handed lee won the only round for us, the rest was them tking us and us tking them in revenge.  I can post a gamer tag of one who messaged me if you want to shame them.
---
He was all like ‚Äúyou guys ducking suck‚Äù
---
I say ‚Äúok gold 3‚Äù
---
He ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt even ranked‚Äù
---
I ‚Äúok‚Äù  ‚Äúenjoy being idiots‚Äù
---
He ‚Äúwe will‚Äù
---
area 51 boys üòé
---
thanks for stealing my meme
---
They look great, love the Jackal one. Little issue with word placement on Doc but they are all great :D
---
&gt;use \ before the &gt;, thank you programming class
---
when he goes to see it and says "oh i do have reddit!"
---
Seeing through smoke isn‚Äôt op just don‚Äôt stand in front of smoke
---
Usually I think the thought process is that it has higher damage
---
I wonder if this happens everytime you shoot it before the grenade should go off.
---
Smol man smol hitbox
---
Solid phone recording of screen with loud speaker in background. 10/10.
---
The f2 is one of the best guns but you do you
---
I think you hit him once before he defused, *if that*
---
Had headphones on, forgot about the music
---
*^(very weird)*
---
I was disappointed
---
Yes I have 1500 hours in game I know it‚Äôs a good gun, I‚Äôm saying I think the thought process is that new players see the gun has higher damage and assume it is better
---
Getting ready to fuck up Riven in the dreaming city.
---
Hey man, thanks for that. Headset just arrived today from
---
Newegg and it‚Äôs no joke best feeling headset I‚Äôve experienced yet.
---
She looks like a moped rider
---
I really like it
---
It‚Äôs even worse when people smurf in newcomer matches and scream/TK people who are still trying to learn the game.
---
Snapped right after he walked through the doorframe. Yep thats a poorly adjusted Aimhack
---
Account is lv 73 was never ranked. Only last season gold 2 and now plat 3.
---
The thing that he aimed so fast at the right spot without overshooting it or correcting the aim at all are clear signs of "letting the hack doing the work"
---
Just watch the video frame by frame. It took him like one frame for this.
---
HACKER
---
Opfor eliminated: mission successful
---
Your parents made a pretty big one
---
But I dont use him :(
---
Ubi cant control the people in your casual games being shitty.
---
good luck
---
well nice way to report urself like that. You have to be really dumb thinking you could act like this is legit
---
Aka dunce hat
---
I know, just the fact I keep getting shoved into ongoing matches at round 3 or 4
---
It‚Äôs okay, not super cool but I‚Äôd use it over her standard
---
Oh that‚Äôs where the seal charm was from
---
Why do people put lights in N√∏kk‚Äôs helmet slits? Is that in game? Haven‚Äôt noticed it outside of fan art/cosplay
---
You had fun taking advantage of new players so you can brag about your new kd?
---
I have had this happen to me  as well
---
Oh thank you! üòÖ I really appreciate it.
---
I wish everybody gets more Black Ice! :))
---
yeah your probably right
---
Oh wait there was more than one black ice. I commented w/o watching the whole thing.
---
^(but how do you spawn peek when you're the one spawning?)
---
Yea doubt they have a botnet or are using LOIC. That is what makes it so hard to control.
---
Why does Clapitao have such a high ban/pick rate?
---
I don‚Äôt really follow Pro League please help
---
He must go, his people need him
---
I feel like this would just take too long for it to feel worthwhile.
---
Nothing else against it, really, just imagine playing 3 full thunt games in a row without ever going to a lobby
