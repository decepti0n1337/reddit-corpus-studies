Damn. That's a sick burn. He needs some burn cream.
---
---
---
look he turn red any second now
---
Also my teammate looked up a guy on stat tracker who left and he had 59 abandons on record. I don’t know if he rage quits or something else but never the less he has ruined games for tons of people. I feel like that is worthy of a perma ban.
---
This a pretty good meme actually.
---
It happens ):
---
Thank you
---
Your "suggestion" won't work in any way shape or form. They can't manually review each kick. And without manual review it wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. And you are the one calling yourself a "young adult" as a 12 year old kid.
---
¿Que?
---
same premise applies to this post
---
I already did this
---
cav sweating\*
---
holy fuck yall are getting wooooshed so hard do none of you realize he's clearly joking
---

---
i have lost faith in the iq of the siege community
---
Wish i had a welcome mat too
---
is it bad i barely have over 100hours and i have 2 black ices
---
Exactly. They kick you or even kill you and once you report them, nobody votes to kick them out, but if you kill them (not saying you are supposed to), someone votes you out and your out of the game immediately.
---
Try to get in the habit of having your cross hair in the right spot at all times, so if an enemy rushes around the corner you're already set up for a good shot. Too often do I see people walking through a map and their cross hair is aimed at knee level.
---
Okay then. No comment.
---
She's just vibeing
---
I dont really have any mains. I have characters I'm better with than other ops but no mains. I made the decision a while back that if I wanna get better at the game I need to be super flexible in my op choices.
---
If you slip on the mat, I'ma tk you.
---
Me too
---
It's not hard to put them, it was pretty confusing to read though
---
How much you bet that your girlfriend wont know there is a mat until she steps on it.
---
Go to the official site and change your password. Also check who sent the email and confirm it’s an official Ubisoft email address.
---
Funniest thing is what inspired fuze 
---
Is a botched hostage situation
---
No. 900 rpm 23 damage a shot and virtually no recoil. If you hit your shots its godly.
---
Oh well am lazy and dont care
---
alright listen here. youre wrong &gt;:(
---
No u
---
There is no "best attacker", you have to find out who u like
---
The problem is that it IS the ufficial one. Literally the same email as every other they used
---
Dumb arse chanka best butt
---
MY WAIFU! yes!!
---
Where did she get it from?
---
Yep every time
---
I am an ash main but not THAT ash main
---
Thats good, but what would your favourite ops be?
---
Valve please fix
---
That’s pretty dope lol
---
You guys really don’t understand sarcasm, huh?
---
Yeah definitely would head over to their website and change your password. Also check that 2step and anything else is on. Might be a compromised password from a different site.
---
Warden: why ya bully me
---
Zofia and buck on attack; Jager and Lesion on defense
---
Ah yes, Favela, nothing wrong here
---
Nnnoooo
---
I’m that plat you go against in cas. Sorry. If it makes you feel better I run into a lot of champions and diamonds and get slaughtered. So I feel you.
---
you are doing the lords work
---
Bruh
---
Frost will take her revenge
---
Fortress is the worst map in the game. Like. Literally it's just 90 degree corridors everywhere. It's impossible to attack.
---
You just got vectored
---
I can't believe nøkk is fucking dead
---
Had no one fooled
---
I feel oppressed
---
This really upsets me when it happens. Lime if I’m playing with randoms I can forgive it. But if I’m in a squad and I’m in combat, fucking tell me you’re rotating to me and where you’re rotating from. I’m in an intense situation, I’m alert af and on edge, I’m not going to second guess every character model I see for you. PLEASE call your rotations.
---
You actually copy bikinibodhis youtube photo thing for karma?
---
Spooky. I like and I want this.
---
Cool
---
Ela u fucked up
---
Be glad you got that instead of the monty skin
---
Its cas. You could just leave? Or if that is bad, just play for fun.
---
 I get frustrated as hell with it too but Ubi isn't going to change it and I'm still going to get curb stomped into mush. So I just roll with it and go to the next one. Not worth the stress mate.
---
We are oppressed its not a feeling it's the truth
---
Is this PC or console/
---
I wish it was my gamertag. That’s my dead load out on the floor 😩
---
F in the chat for santa

---
Wanna add me @troutslayer80
---
I almost never play soloqoue. I have a lot of friends in siege and we talk on dc/ts
---
Insinuating that i didn't go to school or pass 3rd grade or whatever is the attempt at an insult. And i have provided many reasons why it is a bad idea. Also you haven't provided a way in which the idea would work and an idea that has no way of working is a bad idea.
---
Just retire it is all down hill from there.
---
Are you a buck and frost main?
---
Hell of an entrance there.
---
Why did i think the can was gonna hit him in the head
---
He probably just hit his arm... its only a 1 shot down in the chest area
---
I got Warden, not my day today
---
Can't you see the metal things uner hologram's feet?
---
How dare you
---
I try to do this now.
---
The glitch where she can shoot you while having her shield on came back a couple weeks ago so they disabled her in the meantime
---
Makes sense why I didn’t recognize the controls. I play on Xbox
---
She got it to him as a gift...
---
The shield will be one out of like 30 pack items.
---
Good luck buying the skin alone lol
---
that's fine pal. No harm done 
---
Yeah it makes sense but I mean I still see no excuse. With a restructure of devs higher up, this may become a reality again. Plus there are many prototype weapons, and older weapons from say the Vietnam Era, that could still work well in siege that gaining a licence for would be easier. 
---
For example, Why not have the MK G11; a funky looking assault rifle capable of full auto and burst option. Or maybe the GALIL for example.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Yeah but we dont look for those things to make it more fun and also we added putting kapkan traps and ela mines to make it harder
---
Damn, can't believe it would cure you against five people. Some bullshit right there. They don't stand a chance.
---
I like using the red dot only to skulk around like a demon with caveira or jager
---
Wait that's so weird cos I just got PC and did the exact thing in kitchen on Kafé
---
Because it adds strategy to ban based on the other teams ban.
---
Yeah man, looks great! Keep working hard. P.S. What's the song?
---
No blood was seen tho....
---
Limes - my sunshine
---
Thanks for the support!
---
Maybe get some friends to play with or uninstall, if you’re level 210 and you still soloqueue, you probably should just quit
---
Wtf was vigil doing
---
My fucking idiot teammates decided to kill themselves then leave
---
at least i am a person who knows how to use search function unlike those lazy bastards in this sub
---
Check if he needs to update his drivers
---
My name is Isaiah
---
WHY DO YOU HATE YOURSELF SO MUCH
---
You can't expect good teammates in bronze.
---
Insinuating means to suggest something meaning that you could take it different ways. How unfortunate that you took it the wrong way. I'm sorry. I have many reasons that justified my argument you just don't seem to understand, how unfortunate.
---
You see, the point is that this system should be included ***from day one.*** Its such a basic thing as rewarding player for grind, either by a funny 100 renown, or alphapack. Customization is a part of a game, part of experience people already pay for, and currently the game is stripped completely out of any customization as long as you either don't grind for half a decade for a new bundle (which believe it or not, some people aren't able to do) or to buy it with credit card. My point this whole time is, progression system like that should have been included from day one, as a basic feature, but in time, when we have dozens of monetization and pay wall customization, this is an absolute joke from the developers. Even in newest CoD, you have a battlepass, but you have A LOT of baseline progression, and the other thing you can spend money on is directly buying bundles in shop, AND in addition you don't have any other monetization, being it season pass, weapon gating or lootboxes. Yes, game is still very young, I will admit that, but for call of duty having it day one feels almost like a lie
---
What's she trying to do? Kill you?
---
Tell me she doesn't look like that Fran Stalinovskovichdavidovitchsky chick from dodgeball:true under dog story. (Chick on the Global Gym team)
---
why tf is your primary gadget bound to caps lock
---
terrible
---
No idea who that is. Nice flair by the way
---
Thats the thing If you can use it right
---
Damn, that's why I have given up on ranked. Me and my friend would play a game and then if we didn't win the first round, 1/3 times the randoms would either TK or leave.
---
The trail lasts for a while. He could have walked into it while shooting you. 
---
This means literally nothing, how about a video?
---
Down to the bottom of this thread I go.

Thanks, will do.

“Almost”
---
I really like hostage and wish they do a rework on it, but I mainly play bomb just for the heck of it.
---
Reddit analysts: "Well, that wasn't a headshot because..."
---
I tried queueing with others and it’s the same result. I now don’t understand the difference between looking for a group to play with strangers and playing a game with strangers. The only difference is that I don’t get throwers when I look for a group but I barely get them anyway.
---
In operation Health i would play ranked all the time until every round i was getting tk’d so i decided to give it another go and that happened
---
I mean after all it's your list so you do what you found.
---
I mean atleast we both agree that you haven't got many reasons that justify your argument. Your only argument is that people could review the footage which wouldn't work. If you give me another way it would work i will listen but at the moment that is the only solution you've put forward and it doesnt work.
---
they are the same i am very slow!!!!!!!!
---
Yep solo que is terrible. In my last game 3 of my teammates were level 31-35 and we lost without a chance. They barely got one kill. And no one ever picks an operator like Hibana, Thermite, thatcher. Everyone just picks who they like regardless what the team needs
---
Well we didn’t have a new map/rework during Y3S1 because of outbreak. We should have got one during S1 and the other during S2. 
---
Granted outbreak was huge it wasn’t the same kind of stuff as a PvP map and they probably asked other ubi teams for help.
---
Warden would have been cool if he was introduced in the beginning of this game before Jager and Wamai
---
GIVE. WARDEN. LITTLE. SMOKE. IMPACT. GRANADES.
---
Says with the nomad main flair :P
---
[deleted]
---
2 speed with the mpx and a nitro is solid even tho his ability is super situational and nokk is great at entry fragging because shes fast and silent, she can also be used later in the round for catching players while they rotate or scramble back to obj
---
I really don't get why no one likes Warden he's actually really fun to play as
---
Bad take
---
That's amazing
---
I wouldn't say that frost &amp; kapkan are too strong.
---
Ban warden, he can fly.
---
***REVERSE FRIENDLY FIRE ACTIVATED***
---
It makes me sad
---
If someone kills u, report them cuz they’re prolly cheating.
---
I don’t think the Deluxe edition comes with the defaults. Just all of the other ones. The default ones are cheaper now anyways so it won’t take long for him to be able to buy them
---
You sat there for an hour? Always cancel and queue up again after 2 minutes.
---
I thought you still get the pc buttons on the screen if you use one it’s just because of how he moves that made it look like he’s using a controller
---
he needs to buy them
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
Shroud is easily one of the better players in Siege. He's up there with the likes of KingGeorge and MacieJay. But Blitz? Blitz is trash at every level, every rank, every skill cap. You can be looking at a guy head on and he will see nothing but the side of your arm and plunge his knife deep into you and there is nothing you can do about it other than spray like a fucking garden hose with his retarded ass hipfire or flash him and miss your melee attack because you have to be more precise than Pengu playing fucking Kali to hit that shit. Same goes with Monty and Fuze, too. Broken as shit operators that Ubi just cant seem to figure out. For God's sake Clash is even fucking banned across the game right now! It's ridiculous.
---
Nu, some people just play like that. Not everyone is an ash main
---
His guns aren't the problem, he needs to be able to move and see and his timer needs to be like Vigil's
---
Why does she hate video games tho?
---
I literally have that link bookmarked
---
Twice lol. I don’t think I’ve ever done that.

---
Post locked y’all can’t behave

Holo sight for no recoil, close range encounters, and ACOG if you're damn good at Buck. Also use the CAMRS from time to time it's great fun.
---
Steps out onto it BRENDA I NEED A REVIVE
---
What are you playing on?
---
"She's posing for the end game screen, now's our chance."
---
Reminds me of the fucking ropes in Boondock Saints
---
That is so dope.
---
Looks great so far, nice work!!
---
So slow there was a week long response delay lol
---
Though the MPXs damage is low, you still can do alot with it.
---
why did my heart skip a beat when i saw this
---
I watched a video and the guy suggested taking out the button that changes the firing mode and when you press that button down you would click the stick that you would want to lean to and then when you aimed in and out you would still be leaned but the sticks would go back to melee and sprint so you would have to press down on the d-pad to start the pre lean again. 
---
However it would be easier just to aim in, lean, and have the lean stay that way once you exit the aim

Oh great catch there. Sounds like I just have to start over ;/  Steam or whoever is responsible for this can fuck off.
---
My name is verosry on ps4 add me if u wanna play btw.
---
https://youtu.be/T7ppXVMPpwc found it
---
welp i tested it, yes it works but it dosent give you a win automaticly
---
Vigil countering Lion is not really a passive or secondary ability, just an interaction between gadgets.
---
They need more money there will no doubt be big changes.
---
I could never make myself take a shower again
---
True
---
Oh I been meaning to do some Payday art for a while!

I can't tell if this is a joke or not

Or get knifed
---
Welcome to [Zombocom](http://www.zombo.com/)
---
Are you sure because it said it had a problem saying I own year 4 and the year 1 operators and the ptr
---
but there is a way to delete a game from your steam library permanently..
---
I would double check if I were you because I did the same thing and I dont rember about the other stuff but I got the ops (all I wanted). Now I just use the other as a secondary
---
But if look on the bright side of life, you made them happy for headshoting a blitz
---
This is a very bad glitch that happened to me too. It will last you your whole playtime unless you restart the game.
---
I hope you pretended to shoot it when u hopped out of the shower
---
Xbox
---
What’s this from???
---
I wanna see some video because that's literally impossible. like to the point where not even a hacker can do that
---
just use the scorpion lol and alot of people in my ranked game uses the shotgun and idk why
---
And attachments
---
stop
---
I went onto MW. I can’t get the video. It was a headshot. They didn’t know I was behind there, because a Valkyrie was infront of the Wall.
---
So this isn't a map?
---
*Sad Warden Noises*
---
The b**ch who stole Christmas
---
Yes but the cz is a phenomenal option up close, and her rifle is very easy to use. One shot down is ridiculous and needs better balance but her load out aside she has wayyyyyyy too much utility. She’s a thatcher alt, she can destroy shields castles etc. it’s too much in high level play
---
That’s exactly what I’m trying to say, thanks for simplifying it😂
---
Think she's trying to kill u bro
---
That looks AMAZING
---
Tower is still in ranked?! WTF
---
I mean there’s no meme there. He’s just bad. Just because an operator is bad doesn’t mean he’s a meme.
---
Probably a case of that glitch where the gadget gets "Cloned". Kinda like how some people managed to get 2 Tachanka turrets at once. 
---
That glitch probably happened to Thermite and he managed to get a third charge because of it.
---
I’m also on Xbox, can definitely show you the ropes in some quick matches or unranked play. My gt is :iain8or
---
i encountered my first use of smoke grenades as warden last night and noone was there when i peeked it
---
I dont know if you can tell the difference
---
How to lock your loved one in the shower
---
Well it doesn’t really matter anyway for me now at least because I’m way to high a level to play newcomer
---
Rank?
---
There was a workaround a while ago....
---
Sure I’m down
---
 That sounds good my profile is GreaterHen57984
---
Yessir
---
Why is everything about caveira so long?
---
It's an invalid game mode
---
I looked back and it wasn’t us. But I have done this with a four stack before. If anyone was wondering why it’s because we want to do meme strats. Sometimes a new player joins and just fucks up the whole match and it kinda sucks. So we usually do that when we wanna mess around without getting someone who just joined involved
---
Nice is it for ps4 or xbox
---
I support this idea with every fiber of my being.  Add Plane and Yacht to it as well.
---
Black ice ?
---
I’ve never heard him say that but I know exactly how he would say it
---
Why would anyone *hate* video games?
---
What’s your user
---
You have to break your leg every time you step on it or she will think you hate the gift dude.
---
I think pc will be included but probably with an option like in fortnite
---
...
---
As someone who just had a match where, in back-to-back rounds, the attacking team was unable to find the hostage? I wholeheartedly agree to FUCKING DELETE TOWER.
---
Yeah I literally waited like thirty seconds into the round and they hadn't pushed into the building
---
She is going to replace it with a real welcome mat one day while you are taking a shower. It's a trap!!!!
---
Amaru isn't the worst at all Kali is, People prefer Wamai over her and I rarely see a Kali on attack.
---
you can't post the names here
---
just record and report
---
Amaru is tired of the bullshit around her
---
[removed]
---
Idc if it gets removed im just pissed af right now
---
Yikes. Most maps are pretty fair with spawn peeks, but like old kanal, I wouldn't do that to them. 
---
Honestly tho I've been trying look outside maps less and less, you tend to be more impactful. But honestly, on casual it doesn't matter. Have fun (but not at the expense of others)
---
Facebook bad
---
r/perfectlycutpings
---
In the feels
---
I’ve never liked that elite tbh
---
Yeah give a character that's literally characterized around being a Sniper A Scorpion, literally from the most accurate you have to be to the most random  gun in the game with the most horrible recoil
---
What
---
Slightly ironic that the warden main played blitz
---
the flex
---
Sometimes I just get a black screen (I play on XBOX)
---
She looks like I just showed her my butthole
---
I know right?
---
:|
---
leaked new map
---
What does wamai have to do with any of this? At least kalis gadget is useful, even if youre better off bringing a Thatcher most of the time.
---
Damn that shit is mega gay
---
Just remember, these cats are risking jail.
---
If he got a better weapon Warden would be one of those ops who doesn’t have to stay humble and just runs around and frags everybody. His weaponry is fine as it is. We don’t need more Doc’s on defense for fucks sake
---
Warden is one stylish gentleman. Between reload animations and sprint, he is by far the classiest of the operators. You can sense his wholesomeness radiating from him, and getting killed by him rarely feels diminishing
---
r/subssifellfor
---
They can’t add more stuff cause of the engine limitations, this game is an older engine so it can’t handle that much coding.
---
Ok gotcha I’ll check it out more thanks.
---
Which is why I stopped playing for a few weeks. I don’t understand how hard it is to just accept it’s one round loss and we could still win. Now they’re making it harder to win because they have one less player. Do some people in this game have brains?
---
Be careful she won't replace it with the real thing secretly and then you will step into it at 2:37 am on Friday January 27th 2023
---
This would be the option to assume. But there would be some integration issues of accounts. Unless they turned somebody's console account into an alt.  I'm just cautious about how they are going to do this. And they would need to do input based matchmaking which would solve some problems.
---
Use droning and tilting to your advantage
---
It's frustrating when it's your kill and you were proud of it.
---
Zen
---
But his gadget needs a rework
---
Beautiful
---
&gt;“Don’t think she got them removed!
---
Honestly the guy you are arguing with has a point spawn peeking is gay and there is nothing wrong with playing Ela
---
If your gun is completely empty when you reload it only goes to 30, the 1 is like having one in the chamber if you didn't shoot all your bullets before you reload
---
A magazine only has a capacity of 30 rounds, when you load the mag into the gun it the puts one in the chamber, leaving 29 in the mag it self, then when you reload again it has 40 in the mag and 1 in the chamber
---
Clash might be a bit of a challenge to cosplay
---
Is this on PC ?
---
I can tell you are a bamboozler type. Respect coming your way :)
---
Warden still not the least used operator in pro leauge. 
---
He's really on basement on bank.
---
No, it was on Xbox, I was also confused on why he could t bag so fast
---
Coconut brahs YouTube page you’ll learn some good stuff bro
---
Also that they don't care much about getting to the hostage so long as they have visual for a headshot.
---
Ying is fun to play and can be pretty good with some coordination
---
What’s your playing style ?
---
Gridlock?
---
Well form my experience playing zofia, i usually let my team attrqct attention when I go flank either by myself or with someone. Play hard breach sometimes
---
Low-key...it's still weird😂
---
This would put her over the top imo.
---
Hehehe! *crotch grab*
---
Who would openly say they mnk on console
---
This post is fucking aids. Imagine paying money for a XIM because you’re bad at a fucking video game.
---
I wish I was that good
---
So sick
---
Calm bro, who cares
---
chanka ?  
---
clash ?   
---
are those important ?
---
You’re just trying to flex honestly, but 8 games is not representative of your skill set. You’re playing against terrible people too. Check in after at least a 100 games.
---
console seems to be much easier after playing a bit on pc
---
You should be having fun in casual. This map is not fun.
---
i’m not even good at MnK and think i’m better on controller, but i’ve always wanted to play pc, i just can’t afford it, only thing i can afford is a cheap used XIM, it feels nice hence i somewhat feel like i’m playing on pc, but a pc is just far away from my reach. but hey, i respect your opinion.
---
why wouldn’t i be honest.
---
why not :P
---
"Is this decent" is meant to be an innocent question. One of sincerity. Not meant to hurt my soul, I promise. 
---
Yeah, that's pretty good, man. Keep up the good work.
---
but can yours jump?
---
Bruh, it's free weekend, and that Thermite is clearly new; breaching an unreinforced wall with his brimstone.
---
Just stop it. As an ex console player it fucking sucked ass going up against that shit in plat 2. I’m also not amazing with keyboard and mouse as I’ve recently transitioned to PC and can tell you it’s a crazy huge advantage, and you don’t want to be doing that against people on controllers.

Wimp

Nomad. Great operator.

No one, literally no one.

Wow a gold pc player lasers bots.... how *impressive*

Chill on the sensitivity man.

The C75 isn’t even that good, the ability to hold long angles and consistently frag to

Communicate if you have a headset, and try and find people to play with that you know,  it'll help a lot. Otherwise, learn the maps and find someone you like on both sides instead of hopping around constantly to every operator until you feel confident in moving around the map. Operators like Mute on defense and Sledge on attack are your best bet, guns are good and gadgets are simple. If you come from other FPS games where you've been trained to aim for the chest, try and snap out of that. Aim at head height if you can, even if you fire your entire mag and only hit one bullet on their head, that's enough to kill any operator. And make sure ya have fun. The game can get way too serious at times, so it's nice to relax a bit and enjoy yourself with it, do something silly and have fun :)
---
Thermite only has 2 brimstones
---
Everyone’s gonna report u for “witch hunting” it’s gay and Reddit is full of retarded snowflakes
---
Last yr it was around 20 USD in our region(Philippines)
---
Glaring flaws is an over statment and a half. Sound is bugged because it is literally the most complex system in the game matched with the fact that it has to be dynamic and constant. Either way, sound is improved every season with new maps and tweaks to old ones. 
---
Client side debris is already being addressed and is supposed to be fixed Y5S1.
---
What reload bugs have you seen this season? Ever since Gobal Ordering came into Siege I've never struggled or seen anyone complain about it.
---
Operator balance is the best it's ever been. It works as intended with new changes coming every month and a half. What more do you want?
---
Something you fail to understand about Siege is that back when Operation Health was introduced there was only one team of devs working on the game. Which means if they wanted to focus on fundemental improvements it meant other things had to be put on hold. That isn't the case anymore. Now there are almost a dozen different dev teams for Siege ranging from operator blanance to art design to game direction. 
---
While Blackbeard is annoying to deal with he is also decently balanced and I don't think he really needs a rework. With the perspective change that came with Phantom Sight it makes it so you can break his sheild before he can see you meaning he has to be smart about when he peeks or peek fast and loose accuracy. 
---
Caviera is fine as she is. Using Cav effectively requires a good amount of skill but she is far from having "no real place"
---
Blitz is frustrating but not overpowered by any means. Sure it sucks going into a 1v1 against him but if you play smart and punish his aggression he can be killed. Complaining about Blitz and he ability to flash is like complaining about Thatcher being able to kill Bandit batteries. It's what he is designed to do. 
---
Fuze is fine. He has a great AR and LMG. In trade he is a 1 speed to stop him from being used as a fragger. His gadget is useful when you think about it as a utility clear rathger than a killing device. The only thing that rivals the EMP and it's ability to clear utility is a Cluster Charge. 
---
The Lord is a special case. Imagine being Ubisoft, he's the only vanilla operator that seems to not fit in but now you have a large subset of the player base that loves him even if he isn't good. You don't rework him, people complain about him being bad (you). You do rework him and he has the ability to lose the meme and community status he has. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The entire second paragraph is honestly so misinformed it's funny to me. What "blantent issue" are you talking about in the first sentence? 
---
Now we move onto the funniset part of this entire post. "I also think this would look really good for Ubisoft because it shows they recognize the issues the game has and they're willing to fix them in order to improve the game." First, Ubisoft has a released what is called the "Top Isuues and Concerns" blog and has updated it constantly to show that they are aware of issue snad they even explain what they are doing and when to expect the fix for it. Secondly, do you really think Ubisoft isn't willing to fix the game? Did you play or even watch gameplay from when this game came out. It was a nightmare of a mess and had so many bugs and glitches Ubisoft could have just cut the losses and let the game die. Instead, we are here about to enter the fifth year of post launch content and fixes to make this game healthier and better than ever. 
---
Next lets chat about "It can be very difficult to work on current content while developing new content for the next season at the same time". Siege has what they call "cells" which are basically groups of devs that work on one thing for the game. You have the operator creaction cell, the operator balacning cell, the sound design cell, the map design cell. The list goes on and on. Where you seem to be misinformed is that Ubisoft only has one team for new content and that team also works on the reworks and bug fixes. Ubisoft has one team for new content, operators, and maps. Aswell as an entirely different team that handles the reworks and balancing.

Yeah she is the strongest at holding long angles like you say as well with her ability being support she is an amazing pick but with her also being able to hold her own at close range is just the icing on the cake really.
---
I mean why are you playing hostage if you're not playing for memes
---
Warden is quite fun not gonna lie.
---
Where did you get that, also if it's possible make a censor under it so when you're on it, it would play the sound effect
---
Thought it would get a rework before theme park.
---
The maps aesthetic is clean. Just needs some room joins and alternative spawn locations for attack. Also be good if the reduced catwalk viability so you didnt have attack sat up there for 75% of the match.
---
Looking at it now I know that he's in sight, I thought it was lucky when doing it because I ain't too good at the game, the rest of my team weren't that good at the game, I'm a garbage tier player and I still ended up top of the board

Ooh my favorite is being vote kicked during a 1v1, Of which you killed 4 of them...

80K globally; It's also not a Global matchmaking system. Not even a continental matchmaking. It's Region; So if your nearest server is WUS (Western US), that is the only players you will be matched with (Except for the players to manually change their Datacenter to connect to WUS)

---
Thank you for taking it so lightly and not getting upset over my reply. I did assume a multitude of things and that is my fault. I was speaking about subjects in a way to inform the regualr player base. The people who don't put the time in to see all the work that goes into the game. I was in the wrong to bring up my opinions on the operators rather than sticking to facts. 
---
I am willing to forgive Ubisoft for client side debris because I know there is an end date. I know Pro players talk and raise concern about bugs and sound. The sound is so complex even with the hours I've put into watching videos, reading actriles, and testing things I don't fully understand how it works and I honestly think Ubisoft struggles with it as well. I wasn't saying that because I haven't heard it doesn't mean it isn't real. More just stating that I was uninformed about the issue. 
---
I play the high gold low plat normally but if I'm basing my statements of the win delta charts for Y4S3.3 patch ([https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-357729-16/y4s33-designers-notes-mid-season](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-357729-16/y4s33-designers-notes-mid-season)) It seems that a very select few operatos are used a lot more. I'm not sure that puts them into "Overpowered" per say. I would argue that those 7 operators are the most effective at the job they are desinged to do. When you get to the very high ranks it becomes more about using the Most Effective Tactic Available rather than trying something new. 
---
I have to say, Ubisoft has made more QOL imporvements to Siege than any other year before. Breaching charges are more effective, deployable sheilds are more useful, Mav's torch is louder, the RFF system was introduced, Limb Pen came into the game, Lion got his rework, Jackal got his rework, Glaz got his rework, Dokki and Ying both saw small changes that improved the game tenfold, the Evil Eyes are more easily countered, Lesion saw the tick damage nerf, Kaid saw the Claw radius increase, Mute and Thatcher saw buff/debuff icons implemented. With all of this to say, I think it is smart to keep a realistic expectaion of what the dev team can provide. given the limiations of the engine, the coding process, the testing process, and the time it takes for Sony and Microsfot to vet and push patches live. 
---
New content will always bring issues no matter the title or time in which it is tested. Ubisoft took a huge risk in increasing TTS time to 3 weeks and since it started patches have seen huge decreases in bugs and glitches. I think "hundreds of new bugs" is an overstatment in the least. Sure things mess up and don't work as planned but anything game breaking (Clash glitch, claymore glitch, hard breaching sound) has either been fixed or disabled before serious damage can be done. Maybe the game can use some time to catch up but that is why we have the TTS and in season patches. by the time the new season hits live servers the majoirty of issues are either fixed or addressed.
---
The drone one was reeeeaaaly good, the only tip i can give you is:
---
For the breaching charge transition you can use the frame(s) where your screen is completely (or mostly) white for the cut, it makes it more smooth.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
That is so sick
---
r/repostsluethbot
---
What about Kaids pistol?
---
Exactly.
---
House, Yacht, Tower, University, Plane and Favela are extremely flawed maps, but in a way... they are really fun to play on. They have a different feel to them as opposed to the other maps that have absolutely nothing special to them.
---
All the run-outs, rushes, super weird angles and other quirky strats that you'd otherwise never see usually happen on other maps. I feel like everyone just loosens their belt when playing these "shit" maps.
---
I think this Video might help with why Tower is actually a good map: [why Tower is not as bad as you think](https://youtu.be/2jNyeEXPuvQ)
---
The issue is that the C8 on Buck would render the sniper completely useless because it would be her primary of choice for 99% of players.
---
That’s why I went for the scorpion. High recoil, low damage and no ACOG. It’s an SMG, so she’ll have to decide what weapon she wants for what type of map she has
---
Ur in the ranked que so it will take even longer.
---
Nope, 5.56 style pmags, most likely an ICS HERA.
---
Yeah. Somebody clipped it and I thought it belonged here. Then I realized it was too long too late...

AIO isn’t any more “maintenance” than the rest of your case. Just blow out the radiators and fans when you clean your case.

Also they are highly unlikely to leak. They are generally completely sealed units in most cases.

The only real downside is that the fluid will evaporate after about 5 years and your temps just shoot through the roof but that’s nothing to freak out over. Just keep an eye on your system.

it's because once again ubisoft fucked the spectator mode. every game i join in spectator the barricared are up but people go through them, people going through walls and shit. Welcome to goobisoft games

Picture this: you're about to engage with an enemy from afar. He has a hunting enhanced sight and you have a red dot. Ideally who is supposed to have an advantage?
---
Top tier- maestro, mozzie,Goyo, (maybe wamai)

Good- alibi ,clash ,kaid

got that too
---
I had...too....Sorry?
---
Would only change clash to top tier and wamai to good
---
Him ofcourse but i would be in an even greater disadvantage if i had acog cause im shit with it..... Maybe im just bad i guess, could try to use it a couple of matches, used it only once and got killed every round..
---
The 417 is great, you should try it. I prefer it over the F2, (yes the F2 is OP and the best gun in the game), I just hate how much of the screen it takes up and I’ve never been great at controlling the recoil. It’s also fun to use on Lion.
---
Try to place that under a window
---
I think it could use a rework, its not my favorite map but i dont think it should be deleted. 
---
For example i like how you cant spawn peek on it
---
Oh god, i remember when valve tried to do that...
---
Add the top draggers from other team and duo

The same point as every other "everyone said I couldnt..." post. 
---
People take some phrase that either no one actually says or is popular (usually the former) and prove it wrong with their single example of the opposite, thereby proving nothing because no ones ever heard of the formula of experimentation. You need a larger sample group to prove something wrong, otherwise you're just one in a million for all you know.

University was retired because of the politics behind school shootings at the time. Having a school map in you're "siege" game doesn't make you look good during a time of distress towards that stuff.

I’m still have hope that someday I’ll check this subreddit and never seen any kind of comment/post related to this

My buddies hate this map but I'm pretty certain we have the best W/L on it. 
---
Like, were pretty much 50/50, 30/70 on most maps but we hit this one and complain but I'm pretty certain we haven't lost a game on it in the last 6 months.
---
A temporary alliance, for the termination of a common enemy.
---
It did happen a few times where a glitch made it look like the operator is walking through walls or barricades but fighting invisible enemies no

Same though it just happened one day, I was getting at LEAST 10k games now I can barely get more than 4 in good games

If I remember right, I think you can play it in T-hunt or a custom game.

Same, it's actually pretty hard to lose when attacking any of the sites. Roaming is pretty much impossible, given how the only place you can hide from the Attackers is in the Art Gallery, and if you're in Art Gallery, then you may as well be dead..

Alright man. I don't know what more to say. If TKing is a regular part of your siege experience then I don't really know how you can complain about being banned for it.
---
As someone that transferred over to PC from Xbox, I feel that. It took me two weeks to get fully used to m&amp;k. Once you do though, its soooo much better. Its just a matter of retraining your muscle memory. I remember my first few games on PC I'd stand in spawn for a bit and try to recall how to crouch, drop, lean, use my ability. Etc. Also for reference, 4 brings up your ability if you find that more convenient than clicking your scroll button.

---
At launch there were 16 operators--these are the base operators and are much cheaper to buy (each CTU has 4 ops, prices escalate as you buys ops within a CTU--500/1000/1500/2000).  Each year is divided into 4 3-month season with 2 new operators added per season.  The Y1 ops are the 8 operators added in Y1.  These cost 25000 renown to buy when they are introduced, but the cost goes down with each year they have been out.
---
All operators can be unlocked with renown (in-game currency you get after each match).  I started a smurf a couple seasons ago and found it pretty doable.  But you can also buy them, either using another currency that must be purchased with real money, by getting a yearly pass (gives you a renown boost and the ops that come out that year free and a week earlier than everyone else) or by getting a version that includes ops.

This would be nice if you didn’t spam all those #’s. Some even aren’t of this game... Go back to Instagram and try to get attention/clout there. This isn’t how it works here

*downvoted*
---
It never actually made you run silently, that was all client-side. So if you were doing this you couldn't hear the sprinting but the enemies could.
---
Every body falls for it although yeah how he didn't spot that he might be new
---
I wonder how Favela would play if defenders could go o to the roof without being spotted. It would make the attackers' approach much riskier, but they have fewer ACOGs and the attackers have two snipers now.
---
Every time i get in this map you can't even play it bc everyone is just leaving...for good reasons
---
What Mello said, but there's also:
---
• Too many entrances for attackers
---
• The sound design is way off. Someone can be below you but they sound like they're right behind you
---
• Too many angles
---
• It's heaven for roamers
---
That's my two cents :)
---
I mean it sounds like you want to play the type of game where all operators look exactly the same, everything is perfectly balanced, etc.  When in reality some non-balance things are what make this game fun for a lot of people.  I get that some sweaties in Pro League do everything they can to come up with an advantage, but they can Ubi can just block the skins from Pro League then.  Majority of this game is played by people playing casual and ranked with their buddies.  Not Pro League sweaties.
---
Hello Alphy23, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ehpa3d/ps4_controller_issue/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
There’s a new playlist called unranked. It’s same as ranked but there’s no ranking system. All I’ve been playing. No shit maps and no try yards.
---
Rdr2 and seige cross over game
---
Ah crap, well that sucks
---
I think I expressed myself wrong, here's what I meant;
---
On Xbox for example, You press B once to crouch, but if you hold the button B then you will go prone,  and to go to crouch or standing up from prone  you press B once to go from prone to crouch and and B again to stand up
---
That's the same thing I wan't on PC, I have only 2 buttons on the side of my mouse and they're taken by crouch and knife, and prone is mapped to C, but because prone and crouching are very similar actions and one is controlled by my right hand and the other by my left it will often confuse me
---
Me fighting my sleep paralysis demons
---
I wonder if they'll ever run out of ammo lmao
---
It’s not in ranked so who cares
---
The reason for this is because people leave the queue when they unknowingly already have a reserved slot in the server and the game is about to start. This has a simple fix of adding a ‘READY’ button which most games have that is really helpful.

Too bad it doesnt work
---
Lol I do the same tactic every single time on attack. Repel South, rush exiting server room.
---
Cause recruits are god’s reincarnate
---
Can you explain why it is toxic? I got that a lot when I started on my smurf. I mean you just get it in casual because people are worse than you but in ranked its kinda balanced.
---
yes that’s bad

Hello jacceteer, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ehq7ek/today_i_broke_my_headset_rainbow6/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

If he could activate his ability whenever he wanted, have a longer duration, be able to move without it not working, along with being two speed he'd be a good option.
---
This is the most impressive rambling post I’ve seen in awhile.
---
This,
---
And people forget some players may not have the luxury of time to play, the ability to focus on only Siege. or dependable internet connection.
---
"Quick Match" is still relevant, and I feel that almost every cas game ends up on Favela, Tower, or Yacht.
---
What platform?
---
Dumb robot.
---
I spent 20 grand on nomad and I regret it cuz her guns are garbo
---
It was part of an Assassin's Creed Kapkan set in digital content for $8 a long time ago, I'm not sure if it got purged with most of the digital content section of the store or not.
---
I don’t think it would go through them at all, just around
---
It’s fine. Over 100 is bad and below 40 is good. The cut off point for competitive play is 80 so being only slightly above that is fine
---
Yes, but some late fuzing.
---
Not as rushed, bc as deploying the camera as I envision It you would get a lot of attention. And the cluster charge would be likely expected and could be countered by wamai magnets which could attract the grenades to the camera and blow It up.
---
Or impact/nitro/floor banging.
---
If I am in the room under fuze and hear something over me, i shoot It and gtfo
---
The AUG is almost identical to the 416-C, it's even just a tiny bit worse.
---
I just wish there was more back and forth when the hostage is being captured, it would make the mode more tense and exciting. As it is as soon as the hostage is taken and you don't see them in the room anymore you might as well just wait it out till you lose. Like if in bomb the defenders just lost straight away if the defuser was planted.
---
They should categorize and allow you to filter between Golds, Purples, Blues etc and also allow you to filter things like chibis, pro league, tags, medals, limited time, etc.
---
I mostly just run my Rogue charm on every gun except for a few.
---
Imma just stick with recruit
---
Console player problems
---
I think you'll be glad to hear I just did a ranked played mira all 3 defenses. Got a 3k first round. Finished first place. Won 4-1
---
Electric jäger and some kind of ninja
---
The AUG does 40 damage with a ROF (rate of fire) of 770. The 416-C has a ROF of 700 and deals 41 damage. That seems a less identical.

---
I am proud of you. I present to you the figurative gold seal of approval
---
The point of using Mnk on console is to have that unfair advantage on you. Adding a place for them would just be enabling the issue.
---
No she's not annoying like that, she just tells me they're stupid cause she doesn't understand them haha =)
---
Yeah you’re right. I always get Blitz and Bandit’s names mixed up
---
So it should be fine?
---
Yes
---
I used to do that so much lol
---
Your comments says otherwise
---
why is this map not in quick match
---
Ranked.
---
Ok but like I’ve had 10 kills in a single round. Best that
---
Have been playing the game for about 2 years and still do it haha
---
Guess people got used to seeing USA feeding people guns n shit, mostly terrorist groups
---
The glitch is back where u can shoot thru her shield so they disabled her
---
She died lore wise so she is never avaible in Siege again until she rises up from the grave like jesus
---
He's on pc
---
Weird. You are probably playing with higher level teammates too. Really weird. I don’t remember silver V existing
---
Ubisoft currently disabled that operator from play due to game-breaking bugs that players where heavily exploiting.
---
Ok, thank you!
---
Or your just a plat 2 player in casual...
---
Nice!
---
Cheers
---
lmfao😭😭
---
It’s unranked, there is literally nothing at stake. Obviously you put your team at a disadvantage, but I’ll take that 4v5 if I’m not playing for elo.
---
Nah it’s the recruit
---
No problem
---
Yw
---
The game has a calibration thing in the settings that will auto-pick what it thinks is best, it did it for me and i even fiddled around and got it to work pretty well
---
They’re the same picture

Repost.
---
im joking sir

wait is this on xbox?
---
Heels on ground, comrade found.

Heels in sky, western spy!

Shhhh. Dont question that. Just focus on the other things. Like the smol thermite.

This is hard to watch but nice

you are

Chalet is really attacker sided. And mist people know this kobe so you should expect it.
---
So true!
---
xD
---
I'd say 140-150 is "high", but still playable and acceptable. 80-90 and below would be "normal"... People who are below 20 are likely in the same city. Most of the time, assuming players have not manually changed datacenters, getting in the 30-60 range on WUS.
---
Why do we do anything?
---
The lulz.
---
Lmao that look in her face
---
First warden ace ever
---
You know that’s not a bad idea. Especially if I just want to record like ten seconds of my 30 second clip. Is there anyway to change that countdown time from 3 seconds to like 5 or 10 seconds?
---
I think Ela is still viable. You mentioned the MP7 as a comparison. Bandit has a lot more to do apart from simple fragging, active Bandit, communication etc. Ela can just reinforce and go during the prep phase and then attack enemies from behind while Bandit is kinda tied down arrow the obj. Ela is more difficult to get kills with,yes. But her overall playstyle still allows her to take advantage of her strengths
---
It happens sometimes when you join a game late
---
Its a fragile topic right now so they don’t want to risk any backlash with its effect. But remember, even Greece is not in the game
---
Yes, and iirc mobile is the only way you can do it. Go to community options then flair, then top right click edit and you should be good.
---
The first few clips I think you were just hitting their neck area but that last few were complete bullshit you should’ve gotten the kills
---
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS MOTHAFUCKAAAAA
---
Yeah so annoying when this happens, can fill a book with such situations myself
---
I like to use certain operators more than others like IQ and Cav but I do like to use others too so I'm not just stuck with 2 characters at all times
---
I'm not familiar with the PC controls. What do you have to do now for prone? Are crouch and prone 2 separate buttons?
---
Watch you just get black ice for that gun after an day of play time
---
Zofias was in the center of her face, it was closer than hibanas, but I still think hibabas was a headshot. The only one I understand was lion, that his shot went off before mine did server side, but its still annoying to hear and see the shot go off and not get a trade at least.
---
Probably was
---
Nah, console players will lose their shit.
---
Someone listed a lot you need to know but I’ll mention this:  
---
Goyo is heavily dependent on the site and the rest of your team. He doesn’t work everywhere possible.  
---
In general, you don’t want to pick Goyo on sites that are extremely open or sites that use rotations deep within the site. You also don’t want to pick Goyo in cases where your defense might lose control of site for any period of time, because Goyo effectively guarantees that you will not retake it if the attackers use it to their advantage.
---
Yeah that happened idk when but people got all the base ops free if they owned the game
---
Yep, you can't have both mapped on the same button.
---
Oh yes, the classic fishy ash main that enters obj in less than 15s knowing exactly where everyone is without info.
---
The worst part is that most of them don't even try to hide it or are fucking trash at it. Lots of people trying to look like they are holding a legit angle to suddenly start flicking and shooting a random place completely outside the angle vision the moment you start approaching them so they can make the kill look legit.
---
He's a ghost buster
---
Sadly I don't think it's possible
---
I personally like tower
---
Yup. That’s what I was going to do. The Defukt keybinds make no sense lol
---
Oh really? Whats next? Operator voicing the speaker?
---
This is a loading glitch that comes with a high ping when backfilling
---
My boi had such a big brain i wonder how he could play without being able to get up from the weight
---
Yeah tbh I’ve done that too many tines where the shot looks like it went off but it didn’t go through cause of ping. But hibana was all neck shots, you can see from the blood spray but in my opinion neck shots should count as headshots cause if you get shot in the neck there’s no way you’d survive that
---
before that they cost renown. and now they changed it back to cost renown again. it was only for a short while that they were free
---
Which is why Ubi should take console player complaints with a heavy grain of salt.

You got an RTX which means you can download GeForce experience which will automatically help you with driver updates and it gives you the best settings for your setup.

I kinda like tower tho...
---
Well rip my karma
---
youre right, but we both know they dont wanna buff the recoil, so at least buff the dmg
---
She's a good girlfriend keep her and keep her dear to your ❤️

back in the 90s i was a very famous operator

gg ez

Can I be your girlfriend? (I promise the penis doesnt change much)

They could try the system CS:GO has where if you either report people too much or are reported too much you get a temp ban.

What is that?

One fuze tea a day keeps the hostage away!
---
My memory is all over the place lmao, plus i stopped playing after burnt horizon and missed the showdown
---
I just downloaded the game on this laptop today and I waited for about an hour for it to download. I don’t know if the drivers or up to date or not. My other computer was a Lenovo Flex 2 and the one I’m using now is a Microsoft Surface 3 “15”
---
Why didn’t you just shoot them idot
---
I saw a twitter post that said dOn'T yOu kNoW gLaZ iS fUcKiNg tRaSh
---
So did I, I feel your pain...
---
I mean I hit play, it shows that it’s playing because it says stop, and then it just stops and goes back to the play button
---
if you stopped after burnt horizon,how can you be a nøkk main when she came out after burnt horizon??
---
What rank are u?
---
Imagine shooting cameras. This post was made by the knife gang
---
Can your new computer handle the game?
---
Who drew this?
---
I’m not sure it’s a Microsoft surface 3 “15”
---
Someone tell me how to put those things next to your name
---
Goobi ain't looking through Reddit for patches.
---
Interesting
---
Wonder what it looks like from a spawn peekers perspective
---
I came back at the end of phantom sight, into ember rise
---
A surface laptop does not have a GPU, you cannot play siege on it
---
I was a frost main before i got nøkk

I love quick match

&gt;He's the only operator who can stop the plant from a safe space

Twitch, use 417 hella op. Pulse roam one above or below obj

yea i agree but he made me laugh

It isent fair we need communism

Most surface laptops are aimed at collage students for light web browsing and doing projects, if you want a gaming computer its gonna be quite a bit of an investment usually upwards of 6 to 7 hundred dollars

That's why i like em, i used to steal my twitch from my friend just to annoy him but now i like her myself

I keep trying to play Nokk and get shit done, same with Maverick. But I sit at about 0.8KD and keep fucking up basic Maverick holes :c

Who’s the one on the left
---
On psn i just report everyone. Works good
---
Well that sucks one of the main reasons I wanted it was to be able to play  siege on it and also use it for school

I dont like pulse, but i played twitch alot and i always used her 417
---
Sad times man
---
Then link the original poster ? Cause this subreddit forbids reposts without posting the original poster

haha :)))

Warden. He is literally the most useless operator there is.
---
Except you can’t hear anything but gun shots
---
It’s “person with a disability”, and yes.
---
How would that be worth taking over a Nomad or a Gridlock? I don't think it would be.
---
I came here for this comment.
---
Dunno I feel it could be underwhelming for this to be a new operators main ability, i could imagine it being a secondary gadget on multiple operators I think it would be more viable then.

You can’t just ask people that

Clash was my free Op for Christmas... so yeah, that was a nice "gift" from Ubi.

Yes, she was my go to support because my aim is bad.

Wouldn’t be surprised if you had to pay for it.

---
U forget tachanka?
---
Warden could be useful ins certain cases, tachanka is a recruit with 2 reinforcements
---
I still don't get how anyone can like the map but preferences, I guess.
---
I'd like the game much more if they let players choose which maps they want to queue for.
---
Don't solo que
---
It is! And it is such a maze to get around and it doesn't feel like Theme Park. I feel like this Operation overall is disappointing with Kali and Wamai, the removal of Casual and it being replaced by "Quick match" and almost all of the weapons except Kali's Bolt Action Rifle being recycled weapons and I am worried that Rainbow Six Siege is becoming stagnate overall and I am worried about that but I think if we wait we'll be fine :)

Lol okay it’s whatever

Jackal has entered the chat

...... I got warden so...
---
He is, for the most part useless and I have only used his gadget successfully once but for some weird reason I can get a lot of headshots and one taps with his pistol and I always run it suppressed but I do love his pistol I won't lie even though it is overpowered.
---
Your flairs checks out
---
Do you guys not have phones? - Blizzard 2018

Warden or Tachanka. Either way, getting rewarded for sitting still is THE worst possible mechanic to exist in the game, in front of global push button ops.

The only thing I like about him is the way he holds his guns when he runs.

Seriously??! How have I never known this??!

dont blame him blame the tf2 team
---
Because caveira always deserves it
---
I think they should remove terrorist hunt classic from terrorist hunt and make it it's own thing. They could remove their ability to shoot but they can still move, you can use all operators and all maps and will always spawn outside and attack the terrorists, and they should remove c4 and barbed altogether, not just mitigate it like in ember rise. I'm sick of being at the beginning of the season and spawning in lone wolf thunt classic only to be able to try the new attacker and either play the shittiest game mode in the game (protect hostage) or auto lock new op and get one tapped by a teammate on spawn.
---
Holy shit
---
Tachanka is lord you heretic
---
Lmao yeah. I sometimes like to joke about drone aces tho. Like if I'm playing with one of my friends and I bop three or four drones in prep, I'll shout "Don't shoot the last drone(s) I'm going for the ace" in an annoying voice
---
Either you have to grind countless Weeks to get them or pay fot the Season pass. One is okay but 4? Fucking Four? They all should be free not buyable and be unlocked in a reasonable time...
---
Tachanka is lord you heretic I will burn you
---
He means without actually firing.
---
The best part is that you killed Blackbeard who's a US operative
---
That's probably the best thing about him and also his outfit or outfits!
---
Recruit is the hardest operator to see in the dark, lion is fucking easy to see in all light levels, are you opposed to those two operators existing? Am I wrong for wearin a black outfit on lion to win?
---
goyo, common rff griefing, they put shield on other side, reinforcement breaks it, you get penalised.
---
Can we perhaps get a list of the major things wrong with the map?  It’s the kind of map I’d love to play again without doing it in T-hunt or Article 5.
---
i got goyo, gangang
---
Lol i do that too, but i had a buddy who used to legit flex about drone aces cause it'd get him points early on in the round, and then he'd flex about top of the leaderboard and everyone would just give a collective sigh of shame
---
Joined! Tysm!
---
Warden 
---
 Reasons:
---
•He’s a fat 3 armor without an acog
---
•Guns are better used in other ops
---
•His gadget is way too situational
---
•When the gadget works, with smoke you have to stand still and no one uses smokes and with flashes it works a bit but the other person is not flashed either so you still die most of the time because you’re to busy activating your gadget.
---
Tachanka is overpowered when spawn peeking using LMG
---
Hell no lmao
---
Wamai is actually one of my favourite operators, I've seen alot of hate towards him though as he is just a btec jager. Hopefully we get something fun come soon!
---
Wow man! Thank you so much, that’s very helpful and very much appreciated. I’m not so much very knowledgeable about PC’s but I’m learning and eager to learn more. Most of that did make sense to me but I will have to search I few stuff you said I must admit, again thank you dude you’ve helped me out tremendously.
---
Which means u are a static which can be killed easy, there is no argue about that, warden could be useful from time to time, but there is no chance, tachanka can be useful under any circumstances
---
I 100% dont understand why number 15 is a thing. Who at ubi thought "let's give 3 thunt modes to attackers and have the best one (classic) be attacker only. But wouldnt it be a sneaky if we gave literally the worst thing we could come up with to the defenders and that's the only time you'll use em in thunt"
---
