Why hoarding all that renown?

SAAAAAAAAAME my one friend never plays with me

Since it‚Äôs an Ubisoft game, it will come back anyways no matter what. 
---

---
It is inevitable to appear in an Ubisoft game.
---
Your welcome ü§†
---
The one on the right.
---
damn homie
---
i‚Äôm indifferent i would say gold cuz shiny but could give away location cuz shine
---
actually fire
---
Haha... Nice

(Phone battery percentage)
---
Also great information for new players
---
No
---
&gt; Why not buff the scorpion back up? 
---
Because her scorpion is fine. 
---
&gt; But, counterbalance with an even smaller magazine size, and possibly even increasing Ela's armor rating? 
---
So you acknowledge possible balancing issues yet you still propose these changes?
---
&gt; Right now, at least on console the Scorpion feels practically useless in most situations. 
---
Sorry, console alone shouldn't dictate operator balancing when that operator is completely fine on PC. The only exception was Kaid's shotgun that was literally bugged. Ela's recoil is bad on purpose.
---
&gt; The shotgun is main pick 
---
Then use her shotgun. People don't use Cav's SMG for similar reasons and primary her shotgun.
---
big sad :'(
---
You you're unable to connect your shots then maybe.
---
I didnt notice my phone was on 69 percent also yeah im just trying to help ü§†üòÅ

Ah, that makes sense

Alibi and Lesion have the best and easiest guns to control. Mira's gun and gadget specifically require practice. Ela is the most difficult of the 3 to master and she is very unforgiving.
---
I got u
---
Yep it‚Äôs nice seeing nontoxic post in the community
---
yep
---
Really?
---
Yah I would agree

---
Yeah, that's what I've been hearing. I'll probably get her and then Amaru and Goyo.
---
damn monte be -iq
---
It‚Äôs like the people from caravan palace‚Äôs ‚Äúrock it for me‚Äù music video
---
What! How??
---
Ela!
---
Yes. I‚Äôm a plat 2 and she is almost always a must pick for me in solo queue. I usually play nomad or gridlock just cause I don‚Äôt trust teammates
---
i love gooooold

I‚Äôm excited about the new ops

Hey! Dont be mean to other ok?

when it went in ur face
---
Unranked is Ranked without the Rank. Casual is still Casual.
---
Her gun has an above average DPS and TTK with little recoil and an extended barrel that can carry out her damage to further ranges, so yeah, its fair to assume you're aim is bad if you think her gun is terrible and I'm assuming you'll struggle with any gun with a low ROF.
---
between /u/Analtoast and I, you probably won't even have the weirdest name.

---
HAHAHAHAH
---
Am i suppose to so something else besides subscribe
---
Idk why you're emphasizing the loudness of her footsteps when her gadget has a silent step component
---
I also don't know why you'd consider the P10 to be such an upgrade. You said it yourself, an extra 16 dps (or 4%) is probably not gonna be the difference maker. Especially when you're giving up a more consistent 30 round magazine. Like you said simply buffing the FMG9 would probably be a better option for the same result
---
Her SMG does 412 dps, which is HARDLY above average.
---
Her gun also has an EXTREMELY low firerate which is a killer in this game.
---
Also I like how you're accusing me of being bad, I wonder what rank you are?

Yeah, the logo on her beret is also her invitational charm, its annoying, phantom sight infuriated me with lacklustre operators, and although ember rise has some re-used content I'm much happier with the 2 new operators, even if amaru seems like a gimmick.

im animation 3d student and i somewhat got an idea of whats happening here. When character is rigged there is something that indicates which rig part belongs to which skin part. You would paint "skin weight bound" manually to determine that. This allows skin to act like muscle and makes them all move smoothly. Sometimes professionals who are painting on the mesh accidentally could paint on some other part of the skin and the software thinks that skin part belongs to another skin part. In this case caviera's head mesh part painting might have other leg or chest painted as well which makes the vertex's conform in this weird way. Again im just a student
---
LMAO thats so funny
---
Not my worst fap
---
Ok, so I know it‚Äôs old and poorly edited, but I thought it was funny and wanted to share it
---
You mean Renown? It's usually just reserved for making up after a server outage or some other problematic event.
---

I have tked for that

---
I've seen other people on here complaining about this as well. I'm guessing the servers are having a bad day.

This is why I like Ying. In moments like these she can be useful.
---
No, it's an old repost
---
Rarities are just random from start. Before adding alpha pack they gave every item a rarity but its mostly random. Probably we will see a alpha pack rework, it should be like beta for it. All i can say is most of epics and all legenderies from alpha packs are alpha pack exclusive cosmetics.
---
As a dog hater I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the fact people can‚Äôt get what they want

Everyone's saying that it's bad because it is staged, but it made me smile a little. No, this particular time wasn't real. But we've all been killed by a Sledgehammer to the face when we're busy checking Valkyrie's webcam show before.
---
Damn I'm surprised with ubi they didnt give the skin to the revolver..
---
I don‚Äôt mind it actually, I feel if there‚Äôs too much destructability it can put people at a disadvantage, favela and theme park have way too many soft walls and it often leads to unfair wall bangs and general vulnerability. However I do prefer clubhouse over outback

I guess that‚Äôs true haha

Seeing this made my Le‚Äôroc fully extend.

Some players always check behind Deployable Shields no matter the location, so it was probably good you chose Barbed Wire

But Ash doesn't use... Nevermind.

It was Sledge then Blackbeard then Twitch or Rook i believe
---
Get a mouse with a few extra thumb buttons. I have both side leans bound to mine and you can lean around corners and starfe without moving extra fingers. In general you want your bindings to be no nonsense in a game like siege and you want to be able to do as much as possible without moving your fingers to diffrent keys.
---
"Oh yeah? Who's the PDF b*tch?? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT HER?!?"

Haha I‚Äôm just a 13 year old with a voice squeakier than a newborns screech 
---
Please fucking end me
---
I mean, it's a video. It comes with sound, lol.
---
What exactly happened to your character, is what I was asking. Almost got shot to death or did the game think you were jumping over the ledge or some shit?
---
how is it not? if you melee the shield then he can't even hip fire you lol. Not to mention you have terrain advantage because unlike a regular op you only have a pistol and any look in the wrong direction and you're super easy to take down. The only shield even mildly scary is montange. I can agree to that. But the other two and recruit are dog shit. saying otherwise after all these nerfs is pretty delusional.
---
Finka and Lion rlly good Ops good guns too Maverick good guns good op Blackbeard his shield is not that good anymore but it is a solid pick buck n frost is eh 
---
In my opinion

I think caveira is gonna need to borrow N√∏kk‚Äôs head net thingy for the duration of the test server XD

I mean you didnt get downed by the gridlock. It was probably just a visual glitch.
---
Too good before Grim Sky?
---
Dude, they were nerfed way before that. Many operations before that, the Bearing 9 could be used as the primary for those close quarters maps because the Type 89 keeps running out of ammo. Then the devs fiddled with Type 89's recoil to make it miss more often and since people were still picking Hibana almost every round, they nerfed all the SMGs and Bearing 9 to make the recoil terrible - yes you can control them on PC easily - on PS4, it is ridiculous.
---
Seems cool but we wouldn't get new weapons.there goal for the game is 100 ops so they stopped at 100 weapons
---

Welcome to Xbox I play and my accounts legit at least
---
Hey I can steal that code,right?
---
blasphemy
---
I know that they got nerfs along the way, but grim sky is when subgun secondaries got yeeted into the ground faster than human rights in China.
---
Left the green matches
---
Are you on PC? On console, the recoil became nigh uncontrollable way before Grim Sky.
---
TLDR: it was already terrible before Grim Sky on console.
---
Eagle is Warden...

Chop off that top part and then it‚Äôll be perfect.

Well as long as the codes reset every 4 years it should work fine for you!

This is cursed

I mean aim and movement yes, gamesense and the ability to pull kills, no
---
Spent R6 credits when I had season pass and the discount it gives you left me a weird amount
---
I didn‚Äôt know anyone actually ran the pistol on clash.Her SMG is a beast
---
Editing wasn‚Äôt that bad, just the music, and yea i was meaning the gameplay
---
Same, I was really disappointed :/
---
I was hoping it‚Äôd be a cute ass realistic lookin kitty or a Chibi kitty but no, it was a wooden ornament smh
---
WAKE UP FEELIN' SO HORNY
---
This abandon penalty that only applies to ranked and unranked. Casual will not have it since it is not a "ranked" mode.
---
Ok?
---
I'm on Xbox, and I never liked MPs even before grim sky (joined white noise), but they were *more* usable. I get the Bearing 9 being **less** controllable because of its lower RoF and bigger mag than the MAC-11, but that should be very accurate due to its tiny mag. Or even the SMG-12 being not "recoil, the gun." It being more of a skill cannon would be nice.
---
No because casual doesnt have abandon penalties in the first place. It will only affect unranked and rank games. Casual gameplay is the same except for the map changes.
---
Any melee will make the sculpture
---
Yeah Eagle just seems like another version of Warden. I do like the weapons though. I wish they added more AK variants.
---
I definitely will, even if it‚Äôs just for a personal display piece down the road, I checked and the disks are next to brand new because they were only used once before it was all handled through Uplay.
---
I am a Tachanka/Sledge main . Does this count ?
---
I would pay for this!
---
Nothing. That's jackal's specially.

If you're not going to reinforce walls, you best be fucking staying put in objective and killing everyone that comes through them. Not reinforcing and THEN roaming, forcing your team to clean up your mess is the worst thing.

Thats my face when three teammates get interrogated and I end up losing a Clash 1v1

THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING OF UNADULTERATED HARD BREACHING LOVE.

I'm not sure I made middle and far left and my friend made far right we decided to mix far right and middle so it kind of has a green tint.

If you're solo-queuing then yeah it can be daunting.

Find a squad/people to play with.

Also, try not to care about your rank. It doesn't matter when ranks are filled with smurfs, and boosters and M&amp;K and DDOS-ers [latter two if you're on console]

Not sure if you know this but they nerfed Nobushi and now she is unplayable

Well... i had a perfect impact on one that was hugging me that somehow hit the drone but not me...

Mini Thatcher is adorable.

Wish you could..
---
Well here‚Äôs me thinking I‚Äôll fall asleep at 3am
---
Have you played with an entire squad ?
---
There was no clank the second time
---
I definitely can‚Äôt Kashoot things good when I‚Äôm up against a shield,
---
I use the holo on the G36C and the Vector, but the rest are either reflex or ACOG.
---
ITS PAYDAY FELLAS
---
You were dead before you connected the second time... again use the AK12
---
i have holo on the R4C because i never use the G36C
---
I was waiting for the "Hey you, your finally awake"
---
How do you put ur main in ur name

Ikr. Waltz that matilda all day.

I‚Äôm in me mums car

I've harnessed the harness.

Why the fuck did ubi give a face covered character facial animations

Oldy but goldy, I know it‚Äôs a repost, but I don‚Äôt mind, take my orange arrow, traveller
---
I only have 3 other friends to play with
---
Nice.
---
False. Many attacks were bugged it was only her hidden stance that got nerfed, maybe her zone
---

Theyre better than charms though
---
Stop hating on shields bro, I‚Äôve gotten multiple aces with this setup.
---
Esports ready
---
Imagine this thing running at you 500MPH in the dead of night
---
Yeah
---
I‚Äôm glad those maps r poop. I‚Äôll admit when I was a new player those maps(house and plane) were my favorite and the most fun but as you continue playing you get frustrated playing on those maps since they realistically take no skill to play.

Everybody sayin eagle like warden, but the kicker is, they aint fucking garbage lol. Warden gey. Also dont use eagle in names if the person/thing being named is not from freedom town, change my mind. Thats right, I said it. The word eagle belongs to America. Cry if you want to.

Wheres Marv when you need 'em
---
Ash's elite animation is pretty boring imo, compared to other elites.
---
Exactly, which is why I see her when I search Mi Hee  Hwang instead... who was the person Dokkabe was modeled after
---
Thank you RussianBadger
---
Cool... use the AK12
---
Well she did lose a ton of her utility. She‚Äôs still decent in 4s, and still awful in duels. Just decent and awful in slightly different ways now.
---
Oh, I meant to say that I use the holo on the R4-C. I use the G36C occasionally, not just for the ACOG, but because it's a pretty solid gun.
---
Restart your game and if on pc restart uplay and steam(if you got it off steam). Sometimes it needs to manually sync the challenges.
---
AR-33 best gun saving up for that tron looking headgear for thatcher rn
---
Atleast it is not a plastic soldier charm I got earlier today
---
What? I never realized how many people didn‚Äôt have hard copies. Played Siege in beta and preordered the game. Been playing on the same OG disc since launch.
---
have you restarted uplay? if still then you have bigger problems and have to contact ubisoft support
---
BasicallyHomeless next video be like..
---
Aaaaw, she won the match, so why the long face?
---
yeah i basically only use it for the ACOG and because im so used to the R4C
---
Nope
---
Your PC just wants to say: "Hello World!"
---
Well she‚Äôs a hacker
---
You can do situations for what it's worth and those still have the old Hereford (with parts locked off as a part of the missions) for a little nostalgia
---
that‚Äôs halfthor lol

It's a 300-year old loli britman. He's totally legal.

Her way off getting back at me apparently

Just happened to me tonight, friend.

I use Nvidia Shadowplay. And yes it does help. Sending physical evidence to ubisoft means that they can act on it and hand out bans accordinglly. Cheaters get banned a lot quicker when sending in footage too. Reporting people in game is pointless too, I heard rumours that the in game report system is unmonitored. But sending in raw footage definitely helps with getting hackers banned quicker.

A spawnpeek they need fix. Too many times Ive sat in one of those spawns and before I even press any button after the action phase has started, Im dead

I play for honor. They buffed a ton of her kit, and nerfed her hidden stance as she was THE BEST character in every game mode that wasn't duel. She is now a bit better in duels and not as overpowered in other modes

Take that back. This is literally the best siege event ever

I got a pulse skin legendary yesterday, I just need 10k more to get the last seasonal skin and then I can go spending all my shit on packs.

new defender shares a gun with Kaid, so it's possibly not him

Amen. Fuck he‚Äôs annoying. And yeah why‚Äôre they totally invisible
---
Oh ok, haven't seen the new operators yet so didn't know.

God I've played with that EXACT jfkpeekedglaz guy like 8 quadrillion times

I don't think it's terrorist hunt because the only way to play old Hereford base is in the first mission of the situations.

That's why then you go behind the mirror and shot all the wall with the shotty!

On ps4 (pretty sure he's playing on either ps4 or xbox), you can record things after they happen. You just double tap the share button and it records the last 15 mins - 1 hour of gameplay.

Did they still not fix this shit
---
So you have chosen death

Aayyyy

Edited it

AHHHHHH AHHHHHH VERY LOUD

What fucking pisses me off is the new white backgrounds. They look like shit, the character lighting is made for a dark background, the clear visors of doc, rook, etc. show the old background behind them, and they have OUTLINES that look like a shitty photoshop using the auto-select tool. On top of that, the white backgrounds look shitty regardless. Who actually thought that was a good idea, a fuckin high school student taking a design class??
---
Ah, sadly I am on a different platform, thanks for the edit btw.
---
For Dokkabei, and maybe Echo and Lesion, it'd be fine. Anyone else- no.

No worries ü§†

I really like a lot of Get Flanked‚Äôs videos, a lot of them(and other people‚Äôs videos) might be a little much for you right now until you get a better feel for the game in general but a couple that would probably be helpful to you right now are the 5 things beginners do too much and the 5 things beginners don‚Äôt do enough.
---
A couple things I‚Äôd say more specific to you, Kapkan is probably a solid choice for a beginner defender. 3 armor so he‚Äôs good for anchoring and he has a gadget that has a good chance of being helpful when it gets late in a round whether you‚Äôre alive or not. On attack, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd really suggest Blitz for a beginner. It‚Äôs a good way to take advantage of the fact that most beginners don‚Äôt know how to deal with him, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really gonna make you better. The way you probably play Blitz as a beginner isn‚Äôt going to be very effective when you get better and try to do that against players in decent ranks.
---
I‚Äôd probably go with someone that you can be helpful to the team and get your job done early then go on playing in a way that‚Äôll get you better at gunfights and whatnot but if you die you‚Äôve done your job. Maybe a Thatcher or a Thermite but just be very careful not to get spawn peeked or take any unnecessary risk before you do your job because if you‚Äôre using one of those then your team very badly needs you to get your job done before you die.

map knowledge is so important. there's a compass at the bottom right that shows your current location and the direction. extremely useful, look at it often when you don't know the maps by heart yet
---
Yeah I would think they‚Äôd use an officially adopted version ya feel?
---
UBI is legally allowed to add more guns and get license for it.
---
Just their plan was to get 100 ops,10 years of support. It was obvious that sooner or later they would have to re-use guns if every single dlc operator gets at least 3+ guns,maybe more. Clash was like the only DLC operator with only one new gun.
---
Thanks! How do i write custom flairs tho ;-;

Oh it's ok then. This "effected" mistake is also made by native English speakers, which sucks...

Buddy, fucking smash is technically a pro league game. The best times you have in the game are ones where you have fun with your friends. Not all games that have a pro league need to be locked in on that. And let me humor you and say that the way pro matches are handled should be this whole subreddit. Look up the Russian badger and watch some of the pro league games he participated in. He wore a fucking tachanka Helmut irl while spawnpeeking with him. We has recruit rushed. He spawnpeeked with a pistol etc... Just a dude having fun. And the cosplayers on this sub do it here because it does pertain to the game. Dude just STFU and have some fun. There are PLENTY of ".0001 second ace with pistol and 1hp with a funny last kill" on this subreddit for you to watch.
---
‚úäüèæ‚úäüèæüòÇ
---
yeah then it's just op lol
---
I guess. Although I was only correcting him on the guns official name, not the army version. Cheers for the correction on the name of the service variant though
---
The main point is that Sony only let F2P games to not require PS Plus. Ubisoft cannot do anything about this , so I have no idea why you posted this thread on Rainbow 6.
---
That made me LOL way more than it should have.

Personally I think zofia is the better operator, he guns have a better rate of fire her LMG has a larger mag and her Ak has nice recoil. Her ability to self revive is cool as all hell and her gadget is real handy.
---
However capItao is an easier operator, his LMG is easy as all hell to control especially compared to zofias to the point that with acog that thing needs the extra 50 bullets. I also like caps arrows they are really handy at smoking out people holding angles behind a sheild.
---
Cap was my main when I started because I couldn't shoot for shit.

Someone else commented that I just checked it

In what regard?

Quick tip: Everyone will tell you to use the UMP but its trash unless on maps with long corridors, you gotta use the shotgun on Close Quarters maps, you need to BELIEVE in the m1014 or else it won't work.

BTW you need to get used to getting trash talked, someone called me a bald shithead for getting an ace

The kids used to storm Xbox. That's why Xbox was considered the toxic console a couple years back. Mainly due to Xbox being a bit cheaper than PlayStation

Get ready for what will happen in the next days :

1-Smurfing problems in newcomer that will drive the actual new players away

2-Reddit will be filled with "Oh look some newbie placed an ADS on a barricade"

Don‚Äôt you just love it when you‚Äôre voted out by your teammates who all have zero kills... yeah that sounds like PS4 players
---
oh thanks
---
I can guarantee the devs have thought about it already. It would require a lot of work for no real impact on the gameplay experience and probably not worth it in their eyes. I'd love to have it as well though.

Easy fix, don‚Äôt hold to slow bleeding or move outside obj

Because the game ends when the bomb is defused and not when the bomb is 3/4 defused...

Really, How come?

well I play console and the Smg 11 has so much recoil it's basically a death sentence to try and use it. So I run the FMG and pistol, it holds up well

I had the same thing yesterday at PC. A new guy was in my team + he had a slow pc. So one guy just starts spamming vote to kick and i pressed no eveytime. As soon as the round started he teamkilled the new guy... I just started playing again after a 1 year break and it feels like the Community in casuals are just a bunch of kids
---
Thank god those kids are DEFINITELY the ones here on Reddit and when you ask they're so open to listening.
---
Honestly these posts are just karma farms and get tiring when it's every day!

Why would they use a drone when they could just rush the objective on 20HP from the spawnpeeking doc that should have killed them

No votekicks and an abandon penalty for leavers. Although not specific to any game mode, Ubi are also implementing functionality to apply Reverse Friendly Fire on people who are queueing together.

Aw yeah ye sure showed him there kiddo

I agree with you on that. Hostage is very broken and I feel like the whole mode needs to be reworked

Probably the best Russian thing not done buy a Russian I've ever seen, all the characters are ok even the ones in Cyrillic, beautiful!

In what sense? If you mean cross platform play then no. If you mean cross platform support as in being able to use cosmetics across platforms then yes.

This is just reposted. You can see the original title

No. Stop it.

Modern problems require modern solutions

Not happening.
---
1. No one watched console PL before because PC PL is just leaps and bounds better.
---
2. All the players in the league would be cheating with MnK during online PL and then when it came to LAN time they'd all be shitters because they'd have to play with controller at LAN.
---
No point really, most console "pros" have moved to pc already
---
devs allow the behavior to continue and think "this is fine" , so it will continue to happen

people who can‚Äôt read the sub rules before posting should be banned

They should have different recoil models for console. Yes, it doesn't make sense for console to have the same recoil as a platform that can easily control recoil.
---
Unranked is going to become the new casual

Forever alone lmao

Wheres mira

Its because its one of Miras symbolic logos. Theres been a charm in the game for like a year for it. Why is it a big deal?

nice. i‚Äôm going to be harassed by someone not old enough to play the game. how mature of you

Same. I love the ranked rules but I don't particularly enjoy actually playing ranked. I have a feeling unranked will be my new favorite mode.

I have no one to play ranked with and am bronze. Add me and we will play. Mangoman317

No let me see it it‚Äôs probably better than mine

Sure buddy
---
There is no backfill, so there should 100% be an abandon penalty.

Yep

It‚Äôs creepy as fuck lol, great job
---
After 3 min, just requeue
---
I just had a thought. 
---
What if Ubisoft made the Scorpion integrally suppressed but left it at 26 Damage?
---
Feels like that would balance out the shit ass recoil it has.

I should have, guess I have a plan for invitationals... üíÄ

Can we all agree that Operation Blood Orchid arguably had the best season skins?

Ooohh ok. Nice. Thank you ;)

This was one of my ranked games
---
Just to make some things clear regarding South African servers here are some things you should consider:
---
* While Azure is out, it might not be fully functional here or fully featured for big companies to simply throw their stuff onto it and press launch. There is always more to it than that.
---
* Market research, again with companies of this size, you have to really get ready for localization of the game and integration with the community. It takes some time to do so.
---
* Playerbase, as in 2017 the game could have had way more South African players than currently, as we tend to go back to other titles.
---
* Similar to the above, we might not have enough players to keep the servers active. This means some players would play on EU anyway and the player base might end up splitting into two. 
---
* Worth of Investment because at the end of the day, they are a company. They can't really just burn money and hope that maybe we have let say 500 South Africans playing. Even places like Australia have a count of in the thousands.
---
Lastly, I just want to say that introducing a server region is an EXTREMELY hard decision to make. If you do it wrong you could kill a whole scene or upset a great number of people. Research has to be done, feasibility needs to be checked, advertising budgets, tournament organizers need to be spoken to, there is a long list of the process.
---
The blue one for me. The left is a little too much.
---
1. never had problems with it
---
2. why shouldn't rants be allowed
---
Great, thank you ;)
---
Everyone sucked when they started. If you quit games because you get new people on your team, have fun never enjoying online games.

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Good, cuz I totally was getting annoyed that I couldn't last night and didn't understand why.

Wtf

I know I'm sorry I always swap the e and I cause my one friend who cosplays Cav, calls her Cavi so I swap them ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶

Nobody can control the recoil, it's just absolutely bonkers. The only way you can use it is to burst from longer distances and spray only from very close. Don't even pretend that you can handle the recoil.
---
What?
---
This face is the only thing I see in my nightmares now. It started happening so often that I can't tell if it's part of the dream or real. Everytime I turn around I see a glimpse of this face and I realise that it will always be there, watching and waiting.

true he might not have the highest pick rate in ranked, but he is still often used in high ranks.

Hmm I guess I didn‚Äôt think about that

Castle I recommend not using as people tear his walls down to roam so if you want to play defense valk doc lesion are usually top picks for me as their weapons are good and abilities work very well in ranked
---
I think it's legit. Many player's first instinct is to look to that side, to which he did. Then he noticed you, so he adjusted his aim and fired. Based on speed it would be a smurf account.

That's removed by battleye

I only just asked my friends, never actually knew Insurgency didn't have a launch in SA :(.  I played it when it came out, but Siege to me won hands down.  It could have improved drastically by now though, I'm not sure.

No it's just a common spot to be in especially when in a 1v1
---
Spraying from very close is what the gun is meant for
---
Who would apply to be an internet janitor
---
Yeah it happens to me alot ... there was a trick to this problem earlier in which if you join a casual map and then search for Ranked you can then reconnect, but that trick is not working since 8 9 months and you can't do anything and you will get the abandon sanction. I've reported this problem to Ubisoft but they didn't do anything to fix it.
---
I know we're not supposed to say anything overtly sexual but...
---
The game modes primary use will be people warming up for ranked, just having people leaving and new players joining will ruin the whole point.
---
Damn fr
---
They most likely copied the face model to save on work time and data size, they assumed they won't need to ever reveal their faces.
---
1) Siege sound is fuckered. People who have experience in games like counter strike will totally struggle with the "directional" sounds. Its especially difficult to judge distance in siege early on.
---
2) Some people generally have slower reaction times and less general map awareness as they learn the maps and get accustomed to the game. Play ranked if you want people more on your level, if you cry that you're cooper or silver because of team mates...I hate to be the one to tell you, you're just bad also.
---
3) People play to have fun, especially in casual. Music playing over game sounds, or no sound because they are in a room with family is super common. Again, Ranked can be a better choice to eliminate some of those players.
---
I really like theme park except haunted. Apparently they‚Äôre doing something with train which I don‚Äôt think it needs. I‚Äôd personally just be happy with them fixing haunted

My suggestion in year 1 was to have the 3D model of each operator on a pedestal that shows off your weapon camos/attachments/costmetics. I know they have these models for post game but it would be cool to see them while you pick.

Solo queuing in ranked is such a massive pain in the ass. I use to always hover between high bronze-low silver. As soon as I get a consistent 5 stack, I pretty much hover in low gold. This change was pretty much immediate and it's not like I'm being carried by my team. I'm usually in 2nd/3rd place. Just having as guarantee that my teammates will actually properly reinforce, put down gadgets, not shoot me for lulz, etc. is such a massive improvement. Hopefully you can find your 5 stack one day.

If Blackbeard needs a buff then it's definitely only needed on console.  On PC at least, being able to take a bullet or two to the head is often enough to save him and let him put one in the defender's head.

He has neither. And I do have Twitch Prime
---
Personally, I'm going to use it to practice for a little while and try out some new strats in unranked. That way I can see exactly what works and what doesn't. My team and I find ourselves pushing the same way on the same sites every time. Gets old.

Dude you missed literally everything?!?

The only reason you hit him caused he moved and his leg went into your aim.. don‚Äôt spray like that if you can‚Äôt control the recoil brudda

Apparently Lion's previous state was quite strong, yeah. Never experienced it since I just started playing a month ago. I tried Dokkaebi and liked how she could pressure the defense to keep them occupied--I took an interest in Lion for similar reasons; helping to support my teammates seems like a good way to get into ranked.  Mozzie's been helping me learn the maps a bit, but I feel he'll be better once I know my way around them and can leverage more out of the vision he provides (especially by using callouts and not needing to scan).

Can I ask what makes Mira a bit more situational than the other operators you listed? Is she maybe just more site-specific in her application?

like you can play with mira or without mira, depends on the the team, like she was a must pick in pro league before the pick and ban, and after that she didn't got much used because of 90% banrate or something like that and people  adapted to play without her.
---
and lion was not quite strong, he was literally broken. he was a must pick back then.
---
If nomad gets in the objective, and starts to hold it, retaking becomes extremely difficult; nearly impossible if the enemy team doesn‚Äôt have any explosives. 
---
Her air jabs can be used in a variety of ways as well, from knocking anchors out into the open, stoping a roamed from flanking your team, and as I mentioned above keeping enemies out of the objective once you‚Äôve started to secure. 
---
She also has an amazing side arm in her .44 Mag semi-auto. The scope on it allows you to contest enemies at a range while giving you the freedom to put a 1x scope on your primary without worries about being outraged by a three armor with an acog. 
---
Both her rifles take some getting used to, but her ARX200 is honestly really good after you learn to use it. I remember not liking either of her guns when I started playing her, but the ARX has really grown in me. 
---
She also has breaching charges and flashbangs, and I usually end up running her with breaching charges, so soft destruction is always a plus.

Bro, Steam gives you the test server, it is recommended you always play the game through steam. And make sure when you download the test server you don‚Äôt do it through the Uplay cliejt otherwise it will not recognize the game on Steam.

Well played on both parts ... The ace clutch and the delayed tbag so they couldn't see it.

Wow you killed 2 people with the gun. At cqc ranges. Even there the fo-12 does lower damage per pellet than just about every other shotgun. Even doing less at long ranges.

The real secondary warden should have had
---
you can just use an extern replay system
---
September 9th is the guess since it would be three weeks after TS launch.
---
The MPX is sub-par, kind of a headshots or bust kind of gun.  I think if the map / objective calls for it, Valk shottie is the play
---
And her weapon should be faster out
---
Yea the test server unlocks everything for you, and I‚Äôm pretty sure you can play the test server. What are your laptop specs?

Tbh nah I don‚Äôt really have any pl skins or anything that you would be able to access just the new ones from this season and some elites but I don‚Äôt think the elites transfer

- Quicker operator

- Super strong loadout

- Can be deployed in a better spot

- 2 cams but are destructible
---
- Sees through Smoke 
---
- Shoots lasers
---
- slower operator 
---
- Have to be more active with the gadget 
---
I think they could both co-exist. Also things can change; maybe they get a 2nd camera or more sensors etc.
---
she isn't even out yet, we will see it after 1-2 months
---
Cav has an elite????
---
Must be quite a dry turd
---
I'm not one, but it's the better way to play.

---
do you solo queue?
---
Oh okay, thank you for your help
---
One day I will have aim this good
---
Europe has many countries with many different languages, most of the time players do not know the English callouts of rooms, operators etc.
---
# LOOK AT MY MAN HERE DOIN IT BIG !!!!
---
This is just to flex your black ice isn‚Äôt it &gt;:(
---
they decreased the elo so they can test out the new champions rank
---
I think it‚Äôs too early to say considering Amaru hasn‚Äôt officially come out yet and N√∏kk hasn‚Äôt had a chance to be in Pro League yet. They may think that stuff now, but remember when they said Gridlock wouldn‚Äôt be good? Half of the teams were playing her pretty consistently when she became available and has made her spot in the meta. Only time can really say if they will be good or not.
---
R6S, the S stands for ***Spooky***
---
These console clutches/aces hurt to watch. Well played on your part though.
---
yes :)
---
Thernite and hibana are tied for #3.
---
I mean, you pretty much *have* to main Chanka at this point. You'd be slapping the Rainbow gods in the face for giving you such a beautiful gift otherwise.
---
Because they lowered the elo requirement for champions rank to test it, so that means to get diamond you only needed to be in the gold elo range to get it. Read some patch note updates my friend.
---
I had this game where I was playing Glaz, my first mistake, and it was me and Cav left. I dont like his rifle, probably because I suck with it, but I love the PMM. So I whipped it out, and ran inside to find the spooky bitch. As soon as I entered to building and rounded the corner, she came around too. It was my PMM versus Cav‚Äôs OP, but understandably so, Gat. I practically shat myself. Screamed. And died. All on voice chat with my mates.
---
You got gridlock and mozzie then?
---
Thanks marv
---
Bruhh.
---
You're welcome :)
---
Teabagging because he tried to be sneaky and failed lol I find teabagging funny regardless of if I'm on the receiving or giving end of it because it's so silly.
---
Yeah just like Mavericks gun magazine, which btw should have more rounds per clip
---
Shit dude, how much to make one of Maestro? I fucking love this.
---
Yep but I think he has a great set up for an amazing pro league skin
---
Yeah, but the difference is that a zombie mode is known for what it is, you shot the zombies out, what could we do with an anime event? I could like the idea if it has something good in it.
---
Y u bully ;(
---
What server are you in?
---
I haven't seen it yet, could you share friend?
---
This was tested in pre alpha, apparently it was extremely obnoxious and confusing for everyone involved.
---
Imagine sledge shooting out the light and then tossing a nade at you, wtf do you do?
---
Or Glaz popping the lights and then wandering around while you have to sit in the corner and hide.
---
Or all the buggy spots where you could shoot the lights in order to make it impossible  to see you in the dark, so you can abuse Doc/rook and get free kills.
---
I'm not keen on reflex just because with the red dot being so small it helps me keep precise, and yeah, if you can get used to lions v305 though you'll probably do abit better attacking as that gun absolutely shreds with 50 rounds too.
---
I stopped playing for abit then got used one rifle at a time when I came back, it's easy if you play loads like, but maverick has the only dmr I can bring myself to use
---
I mean, I know that. I don't really need you to remind me :(
---
I believe Clash stands at a good spot right now. she doesn‚Äôt need a nerf, nor a nerf.
---
What have you created?
---
Iirc the main changes are a rework or complete removal of the train yard and a rework of the haunted area and everything else is fine for the most part. Atleast that's what they said back when they revealed theme park would get a rework.
---
"almost" "flick"
---
Bud you were already turning at him before he started shooting/was in the room.
---
It actually looks better with the google eyes
---
His ability cannot be replicated by any other. His ADS can stop any projectile. Pretty much every other OP has someone who can replace them n do the same job. There‚Äôs no one to replace him atm.
---
Mmmmm, i feel the sudden urge to blast the sh** out of someone
---
First off what the fuck?! Learn how to form a proper sentence... 
---
Secondly, you really think picking up a knife just automatically makes you an expert at interrogation? Cave has had years of experience! This isn't fucking avengers where the random dude gets to pick up Thors hammers and shoot fucking lightning bolts!
---
Nope it's the Blademaster TE from Drevo
---
Because I said that he got killed after I took the screenshot
---
Ahh i just realised what you meant, as in he has no effect on any of the ones you listed
---
Hello ISMACKMEAT, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cwajjd/check_out_my_new_siege_clips_channel/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
SAS easily.
---
I wouldn't bother including DLC CTU's since there's only two op's a piece.
---
Does unranked affect your KD ?
---
Show me gameplay of you controlling it.
---
Ok, but you only said afterwards. If we wouldn‚Äôt have asked you, there would be no way for us to know that.
---
If done right that could work. Maybe 2-3 bullets go through but if it was straight up it would be mad unbalanced
---
Looks great! If i had tried, I would just be a dude with a green bike helmet on walking around with a nerf gun
---
They are 100% not related. The Pick and Ban feature is to PICK AN OPERATOR TO BAN. Ubisoft removed Recruit from Ranked, they didn't remove him from the Pick and Ban because he was never there... UBISOFT DID NOT PICK AND BAN RECRUIT OUT OF THE GAME. They Removed him that's it its not the pick and ban like wtf
---
I mean, Mute is one of the strongest ops on defense, why make him stronger?
---
You play siege you should know why he would smash his controller dumbass
---
Even Thanos can't stop him now!!
---
Nope. You‚Äôre wrong. Sorry :)
---
Well I had some situations like that and I know one way to deal with toxic players. If they say something that won‚Äôt be useful don‚Äôt care about them and/or mute them
---
If you play siege you would know
---
Nope. Wrong :)
---
I think dumbasses play her like Ash and expect her to not be killed through a window when entering. She should be played as an anti defuse above the site, no one plays her like that though.
---
Y[e]
---
Antarctica Obviously
---
Oh my god 5 days later its on sale for the same amount on Steam... I already bought it 5 days ago and I can't refund from Ubisoft I think damn it.
---
This is warden when someone uses a flash bang and he forgets his ability.
---
And plus if they Added Recruit back into Ranked he would still not be PICKABLE AND BANNABLE. he would be in the Operator Selection screen.. Where they removed him..
---
How much further can she go? Shes already touching the ground
---
Restart queue
---
Is this in the gym in Clubhouse, I've honestly never noticed it.
---
ah, i see. a man of cultured
---
Honestly all the pro league skins look like shit compared to most of the other outfits and stuff you can buy with in game currency. My rook looks way better with the legendary outfit and gun skin....
---
Brazilian drugs
---
Okay, that is just straight up bullshit. You clearly shot her like 20x in the body.
---
I have a different though process to others though, and ask for changes that many people don‚Äôt want to see ‚Äî&gt;
---
Ash
---
- R4C ammo reduced to 25 (from 30)
---
- G36C reload speed changes sped up by 10%
---
Goyo
---
- ACOG removed of TCSG12 shotgun (I know it‚Äôs not possible as far as we know, but it‚Äôs still a request)
---
- Allow Twitch drones to trigger his Volcan Shield 
---
Amaru
---
- Gains Breaches (swaps from Claymore)
---
Nokk 
---
- Gains Smoke Grenades (Swap with Claymore)
---
Doc, Rook, Echo (and Mute)
---
- Loses ACOG, but MP5 variants get damage buff to 33 
---
Twitch 
---
- F2 damage reduced to 34 (from 37)
---
Jackal
---
- C7E damage reduced to 40 (from 46)
---
Blackbeard 
---
- ADS time for weapons normalised I‚Äôd face shield is unequipped; once equipped it will be much slower again
---
And many many more. You won‚Äôt like them and that‚Äôs fine
---
I just watched it get to 99:99 and switch back to 0:01 as if its still going..
---
I'm actually on the Moon
---
its cause europe has so many different nationalities, many of which dont like each other, some are stubborn, itll never be like NA where the majority speak the same language etc
---
Sadly, this happens all the time. I'm interested to see if any of this happens in unranked when it releases.
---
Actually, yes. Buck was the unlucky sod who got tackled by an angry Brazilian in that trailer, so it‚Äôs a running joke in the community.
---
no its prob just people who dont like siege selling accounts
---
You little dickhead
---
Whats a door?
---
alpha test?
---
I‚Äôm confused you just shot two people? What‚Äôs so good about it
---
ok. Thank you for informing me of this. I would take away their *Friendly Neighborhood Doc* privileges, but you seem to have blocked out their names. I now deeply resent you.
---
Use the search bar ffs
---
Ik what happened... this has happened to everyone before...it wasn‚Äôt worth a post
---
I'm surprised you didn't shoot the hostage.
---
Cause they have no skill lol.
---
I solo Q and play about 50/50
---
Same thing with my friend and I last night
---
OH 343 OH [REDACTED]
---
This is why I don't understand recruits. They have their own language.
---
FOOKING LASER SIGHTS
---
Thanks, again
---
Boost people, get a high rank. Basic stuff.
---
He glitch *is*the elite
---
That‚Äôs the point lol
---
It‚Äôs the other way around
---
No problem.
---
Toggle Q for spring, E for vault. Just switched them and kept them on respective sides. If you‚Äôre inside most gunfights don‚Äôt require running/vaulting, and your 5 fingers will naturally be on move and lean keys at all times.
---
5 squad m870 recruits be like
---
I dont think any operator gets stronger than Mira bc her kit literally changes the game via the way you push sites / the pressure it applies for the window just existing.  I definitly am an anchor player so Maestro, Mira, Alibi and Rook are my go-to.  Alibi I sometimes roam with but otherwise Ill only sometimes choose Cav or Vigil to change it up.
---
That was not 0 seconds o.O
---
I just hope it means the tryhards in casual go disappear off to unranked so I can play casual without facing 4/5-man squads every other round. Then I'll probably enjoy bomb more than hostage
---
Bro I made this my home screen so whenever I check my phone I see that
---
What the FUCK does that mean
---
If it was a dia and the rest where plats i would be like aw rip thats unlucky, but the fact that there is a bronze and a silver in there.
---
The elephant is squishing the ants
---
What's that skin you have for the M762?
---
Snedger tweeter that cavs elite was released, and me, a cav main was very excited, it was that bullshit.
---
Were you able to get this fixed? We're going thru the same thing right now and have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling.
---
Honestly wait for the new season man. As other have said ranked is really different from casual. But if you wait for the new season you can try out the unranked playlist where you can learn how ranked is played without worrying about your rank. Another reason is that your rank is going to be used to set your starting point next season because of the new soft mmr reset system. So if you get stuck in a rank itll be hard to get out of it
---
Story is they were trying to catch lion while thatcher was chasing him but thatcher got blasted instead
---
Love the detail especially on kapkan
---
why don‚Äôt you try and reread your original post and see if you can‚Äôt figure it out yourself smh
---
PESCI
---
Lol you could just download a "to be continued arrow" greenscreen or png and slap it over a clip. Would not take any money or learning.
---
Spoken by a true casual player.
---
You were gonna blow up house now I'm gonna blow up your prostate
---
I slowed it down to .25x speed, looks normal to me.
---
Absolutely ‚úî
---
Frickin mammoni
---
I like lesion for roaming as you can place gu's around site and then you can just head towards whichever goes off and the t5 is amazing, and I like mira because it just makes holding site so much more fun, and obviously her mirrors are incredibly strong, my kd with her is 1.25 which I don't think is bad considering my kd for the season is .99, I've found great use out of her though, especially on kafe !

Ohhh I would have loved to. But the post would have been removed.
---
Memes aside that is a really good cosplay
---
This makes me feel better about finally reaching plat on XB next season haha
---
White mask's gas grenades are same as smoke's ones at article 5 cutscenes, but also smoke has a headgear that similiar to cutscene's rainbow team. So its possible to smoke picked up some canisters from ground while beign part of operation article 5, than researched and used it against his enemies. Thats just my theory.
---
That's not comparable to toy soldiers. Anime-themed event is too niche, not 100% of Siege players would enjoy that. They'd never do it. Toy soldiers is understandable, it's nostalgic, lots of people had them as kids, and even those who didn't still love them.
---
Maybe see cure area and hostage should be added to unranked and not to ranked.
---
That's a body stuck in the top of the window.
---
And her arm dangling down from the top of the window.
---
I dont believe guns change the dynamic of gameplay so much as gadgets but maybe that's just a me thing
---
No, it was an April Fools event. Wasn't it?
---
And you keep showing me that you need to learn to counter it like a good caveira is hard to deal with and a good blitz or Monty is hard to deal with when you counter them they stop it most of the time
---
Blitz
---
Would smash
---
I have the blitz elite in my list! Just finished the lord
---
Step 1 : go to School
---
Step 2 : learn to read
---
The post with your friends Cav is literally right above this post in my feed. 
---
Both look really good and like you guys put a lot of effort into it.
---
I was on 5-10 minutes ago i dont think so
---
None of those operators are hard to deal with except blitz. And he requires a team so he doesnt just get clapped. You keep coming up with stupid rebuttals and ill keep slapping them down.
---
Thank you random persona fan :]
---
It's all good nice ace
---
And I‚Äôm talking from the console point of view pc is probably different
---
Xbox one.
---
Same
---
It's just been bad for me due to getting paired against diamonds every single time
---
He says it "wArDeN"
---
The sad thing is they fixed it in the most recent patch they put out today. Ngl I liked it when cav had the glitched face it was scarier
---
Ok thanks!
---
You can, just dont enable the ban phase.
---
You challenge Tachanka?
---
Lesion on defense for sure.
---
I cannot tell which others you do not have
---
Yes if your close (high silver low gold) but if your gain / loss  diffrence is high then yes
---
nah, he lagged out and joined back right before the round started.
---
Yeah that's the problem I'm facing rn. The grind is just too much. I've been playing for a couple weeks and have only unlocked 3 ops.
---
But the memes
---
Buy Alibi this season and wait till next season when Mavericks price drops to 20k
---
Yeah I see that, are you new? If so try the newcomers playlist, there will be smurfs but there always will be, just hopefully there are less than in casual.
---
Casual is wildly unfun and repetitive. The rounds are far too long and nothing about it is interesting.
---
&gt; I dont believe guns change the dynamic of gameplay s**o much as gadgets**
---
That I'll absolutely agree with but take extreme's like the F2 or the R4C when it had the ACOG and those two alone made many people play their respective operators by themselves, after those we've seen newer weapons that have pretty much no recoil like Mav's M4 which can really draw people in.
---
It's not that I think "guns &gt; gadgets" but that I don't agree that guns have no effect on how the game is played and that even with gadgets mattering more than guns doesn't mean we can't have more guns.
---
He provides 0 utility and it was ridiculous that u not picking an op in time was defaulted to recruit.  He has a huge arsenal of weapons but that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all. He provides 0 help to an actual team. Sure it‚Äôs fun to handicap yourself sometimes tbh but not in a ranked game at all.
---
Welcome to Siege.
---
I wake up feeling so horny
---
Because one or a even a few players having "fun" while playing recruit interfere with fun of the other teammates that are trying to win the match. 
---
Against a good team playing recruit is a loss of utility for that team.
---
Lesion, maverick and zofia
---
I get it, you‚Äôre not good-_-
---
I saw somthing that it was free
---
&gt; Casual is wildly unfun and repetitive. The rounds are far too long and nothing about it is interesting.
---
with a booster you can get 1-2 ops per day easy
---
Come up with a theme of your channel. From there, keep making videos related to said theme. 
---
Keep working at it as the market is heavily saturated.
---
He has utility equipment and offensive equipment. The gamemode is always TDM + bomb/hostage/secure area. The best way to help? Kills
---
Literally did almost the exact same thing a few years ago
---
Maverick, lesion and goyo when ember rise releases
---
but why is it wrong? More money for ubi should theoretically mean more investments in the game and what's wrong with that? we've seen increases in prize pools for official competitions as well as more assets used to market the game. 
---
Personally for me, the battlepass seems no different to buying skins. The only difference you paying once to get a handful of cosmetics. The only thing that would annoy me would be if they priced it slightly on the high side or more.
---
I‚Äôm going through the same thing rn I just made an instagram for all my game clips and I‚Äôm starting a YouTube channel and I‚Äôm trying to get growing too.
