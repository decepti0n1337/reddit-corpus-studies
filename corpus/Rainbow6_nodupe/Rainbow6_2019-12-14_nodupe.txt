Not trying to steal your thunder (wasn’t really skill anyways) but my first ace was with none other than Tachanka. 
---

---
It was one of my first rounds and I had no idea what I was doing. Just happened to set up in the right spot and wiped out a whole squad from behind as they rushed in to fast.
---
Who gives a fuck, quit being a baby it's a video game
---
The ideas are interesting but kali already serves a identical purpose to scorch while your defender is really just an Inferior version of lesion of you look into it. Lesion has almost no restrictions on where he can place his gadget, it's invisible, Slows the enemy to a crawl, makes them vulnerable in order to deal with it, hurts them, Insta kills downed opponents, it makes a loud trigger noise and lesion knows the location of each one in addition to being able to deploy several more then the trip wires

On another account I was making a lot of clips about Starcraft 2 esport plays from twitch, is it fine to post some good moments from r6 esport plays on this subreddit?( I really love this game) or it can be posted only on /r/R6ProLeague? thanks
---
I feel your pain
---
Probably a hit on Blitz’s ear muffs
---
Lol this post actually made me laugh
---
This is the way
---
I’ve heard she’s pretty good though.
---
To give a bit more overview of the trick; Each board on a single door barricade consists of three equal sized sections. As long as you hit a board at the point where two of those sections meet, and don't hit the board too high or too low, you'll knock out six sections in one go. This is the amount of boards needed knocked out to vault through a single door barricade.

That last kill really got me going. Bosco truly is Bosgoat.

Completely disagree on the 3 armor thing. That’s a sure fire way to make an attacker terrible. Ever wonder why fuze is so bad even though he has one of the best primaries in the game?

Nice

Hey hey. I take it your like to team up? Haha

Nani desu ka

I like the gadget idea but I feel he hasn’t too much utility. I feel like it should only be on of those to keep him more on the balanced side. Idk if you ever played the Medal of Honor games ( I believe it was MoH that had these, someone correct me if I’m wrong) but there was a cluster grenade called the v40 mini cluster. Basically 3 mini grenades you would throw at once. If it was something like that it would be a little more balanced imo. Either smokes or frags. But I love the gun ideas
---
She used to be but at the moment she's not great to be honest.
---
The recoil on her SMG makes it basically unusuable and they just nerfed the hell out of her shotgun.
---
Nice job
---
Now down to our new Lord, double plates rook.
---
The first to notice it today
---
man i remember having the same kind of triple kill wth the m590. it was on on bank secure area and we were defending lockers. at 2v3 i was sitting at the service stairs watching docks. i got to the conclusion garage was clear and turned back towards vault and what do you know, all three guys were right there in vault lobby facing lockers. i remember shooting lion first as he was closest to me, i cant recall the second one but finally there was dokk behind the table. took three shots as fast as the gun fired. i giggled to myself in proud confusion the entire next round. too bad i never captured it.
---
Honestly, i'm averaging 130
---
It's painful
---
Yes
---
idk not fucking die like maybe take a little damage instead? literally i could survive this in real life let alone a trained military professional lmao it also doesn't make sense from a game's perspective like seriously as a defender i can't jump in front of a window where i know someone is coming in from and take them by surprise?? stupid
---
I don’t know did you?
---
I want that too, but making universals isnt that easy, you gotta Put it in every gun and Format it correctly. If its seasonal one for next season it would be nice

I mean yeah being slower and louder hurts, but his gadget is in my opinion what hurts him the most. To use you need to be on the site (unless you're using elsewhere for some reason) and if it's a window, sure getting shot. If it's the wall or 2nd floor and you didnt properly kill roamers then you're dead. Yeah being loud will already the roamers but at that point being 2 or 3 armor isn't why they hear you

It Takes time to do it and this one is free. They do it every season bc its a SEASON, Theres more Attention at this time so more Players seeing it. So its Like an extra reason to Play the game. For a free skin Like this its a small Action, Not that many people are going to See it so it wouldnt be Worth it.

mmmm fireskin

That helps a lot actually lol. I haven't played in a while so I didn't know what got changed or renamed. Thanks! =)

Shotgun. The SMG is impossible to control on console and the Shotty is nuts.

Yep, I'm an idiot. I searched Quick match and found it XD. Apologies to the thread for this question lol.

No worries

no ur supposed to aim for a headshot not spray like a copper dog stfu

Constructive criticism here

I think elas leg looks weird anatomically speaking

If you wanna fix that simply looking at Muay Thai kick compilation and pausing to look at the anatomy should do the trick

But great art nonetheless

Fookin lazuh soits

i thought i was going to see a ace
---
and i just got to see a retard destroy 5 drones
---
Kaid for sure. Great gadget, good guns, and useful on just about every site, but especially sites that are hatch dependent i.e. the basement on Bank. His AUG has been buffed quite a lot so it’s not a total piece of shit now and the TCSG is still great. The .44 is pretty bad but if you can hit headshots it’s great. 
---
Ela is good too, but her SMG is difficult to control. However, you can run the shotgun, it’s still very good, and the pistol is decent. The gadget is good as well, but overall I’d go with Kaid. You get a shotgun that fires slugs and has an acog, a zero recoil SMG, and a pistol with a high zoom scope.
---
he looks like he just stole jagers acog and is now running away from him
---
ELA IS THE EVERCHOSEN! Blood for the blood God, skulls for the skull throne.
---
Ok thank you
---
So true. I use the shotgun on a few OBJs, but mostly the SMG. Too good.
---
Aheago Trap Videos
---
Shit is that why I can’t do the Mute hatch trick on Club House basement? I feel like that was one site where mute really shined.
---
That sucks
---
I took 10 seconds just now to check it out and I’m never looking at that shit ever again.
---
That’s part of it
---
It's one of the best animations, it's original and far from lazy. Mute, Twitch, Rook, Bandit, Mira and Jager's animations are lazy.
---
And it's synced properly in game. This issue is only on the shop
---
She's saying don't carry any throwables like grenades or flashes. Her gadget isn't affected, so she'll keep an eye on the magnet.
---
JoJo noises
---
That really sucks. Is it still possible to do it or is it completely gone?
---
I don’t fully know but I would guess so
---
To add to this.. the high ranked players you are worried about, are also facing other high ranking players with weapons that don't need to rack another round to get a refrag or repeek and angle. Good players are going to put her in the position of having to come inside the building and take less than favorable trades. She will have her moments, but at best she is a budget thatcher when he is banned. 
---
She will be dust in the wind for the most part, where as wamai is setting up to have a nice impact on the meta. Kali won't be any scarier than glaz when it's all said and done. She just trades ROF for damage. Which, frankly, isn't a good trade. I'm not opposed to a three armor with rook armor not getting downed in one shot though.
---
Scorch?
---
*flame core online*
---
Hell yea brother

Cuz it's probably easier for them to do tweaks to an already decent map to make it pl worthy then to completely overhaul a map like chalet

Spawn peeking is for unskilled players especially in ranked.
---
Yikes
---
A lot of the time the spawnpeeker is at a disadvantage so they have to be more skilled than the one who gets killed.
---
Fuck out of here with that nonsense. Prepping to run out at the spawn and killing people who just spawn is pussy af
---
You are just unlucky
---
it's a no way mirror
---
I play against mnk ever match just use update on controller settings makes your movements faster.  Quick and easy to spin round to engage multiple people.  Just dont do it if your aim is average to below average.
---
For Ela
---
Can we PLEASE bring back this type of formatting during the Operator Selection. This was amazing, and I loved it.
---
How about you drone. Or spawn at a place that can't be easily spawn peeked. Or just don't sprint headlessly out of spawn.

It's for Ela

You can pre aim and pre shot the common spots though. Also spawn peeking from afar requires a good aim that not everyone has.

I agree, in most traditional martial arts, the grounded foot's heel will end up pointing toward the target
---
as far as the music goes, you have the ability to turn off the music entirely.

Don't laser's increase your hip-fire accuracy?

I heard its great for shotguns and certain machine guns like the p-90/pdw9.

I can't snipe you if you don't come to the window

HO HO! Then change position as much as you'd like!

Honestly This looks way cooler than the one we have now

I guess, but they just buffed him and Kaid’s always been preferred for covering hatches over mute except for this and a couple other sites.
---
U got some KANKLES
---
is...is her leg broken?
---
stop.
---
Looks like Hot Rod or something like that for Thermites 556xi

Yah, it’s a shame it is just for ela and not universal. I would pay to have that on every gun.

Clutch or kick
---
I think that actually might be it, weird angle though
---
They ganna fuck?
---
Did you use a pattern? And if so... can you send it my way? I've always wanted to make this outfit but I'm a beginner sewer 🥺
---
You do realize that to do that they would have to either make operator art for each and every single possible cosmetic combination or if they were to use in gane models it would drastically increase loading times especially with people that play on lower end PCs?
---
That....could work, yes. They should add that restriction
---
we're apart of the community to and I don't see how a one shot character is fair.  But seeing as she is new, I'll see how I feel post season
---
Wow it looks amazing !
---
ela barefoot skin confirmed 😳😳😳
---
Thank you!! That's what I was thinking but wasn't fully sure since that is a really flexible kick
---
What's with the Apache, though?

Talk to Ubi support or PlayStation Store. I would go for Ubi first.
---
Fmg-9

Desert Eagle
---
I didn’t know you could skip alpha packs
---
Ok that’s what I though thx
---
I kinda figured he'd bused used like smoke for last second slows and his shield used (carfully) as shields are strong right now.
---
Because every character is a one shot character if you can aim. And if you cant then stop peeking the op with a sniper and force her inside buildings where her 5x scope will fuck her over.
---
Original video please
---
Np dude
---
It won Best game with impact. It deals with mental health issues and overcoming grief
---
Late reply, but yep, I got it.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
that's my issue: headshots take skill, body shots take significantly less skill.  Her sniper should just be a two shot like glaz.  She'd still be a good op
---
*A wild door appeared*
---
Happened to me with mp5 and i was like, is it a glitch lol??????
---
I use suppressor too but it the FMG then does 25 damage per bullet and it’s fire rate isn’t very high, wouldn’t recommend it but go for what you like
---
#SNAPS ELA's LEG IN HALF
---
Is this from the elite skin?
---
Smoke is mobile, that's one of the biggest factors. While his gadget can hurt his team, it's impossible for the enemy to use it against the defenders, and in the case it does damage Smoke's own defenders, it's only for like 20 damage. 
---
I get where you're coming from and it works in ranked and non-pro games, but pro attackers could flip a Goyo
---
Id imagine itd be pretty easy to implement. Just add another column to the scoreboard and then mark everyone in the same squad with the letter A and then if theres 2 squads have the second one marked with B. Solos wouldnt have a letter in the column. Easy fix.
---
Shed be useless with such a slow firerate.
---
Depends on the situation.
---
I just want the m870 black ice
---
I'm in the same boat, but the times when I do have a squad, it's always a good set of matches.
---
As long as it doesn't have crazy hiding spots and is big enough with enough soft destruction, it'll be good.
---
You can only claim it through the 15th
---
Fuck
---
I use the SMG with silencer. It just feels better than the comp or muzzle. Half the time I iron sight it too.

I just like the sound of the gun with the silencer tbh.

They keep on pushing new operators but on the other hand game keeps crashing,3 years back that was a non-issue 
---
Now I can’t even play the game without it crashing on me randomly,can’t play ranked with that thing going on
---
honestly IQ elite shouldve been long hair. this is better than in game

It’s a shame her new legendary looks so much better.

An ace is where you wipe the enemy team on your own, so sure.

Might wanna see what’s up with your game,  not me or a single person in my squad has crashed, unless it’s due to connection in the past couple months

Again, some people for some reason experience more issues than others so just a friendly reminder to keep drivers updated, and to verify game files if crashing
---
I am now at 41%. Lol
---
Hold that L champ

Excactly. was gonna say this.

Additionally such a trained fighter like Ela would probably hold her guard and not have her arms flailing.

How do you play on 60 FPS? My siege dropped to 80 while I was encoding a video and I almost threw up

It's a barricade that you don't have to break to walk through.

Done all of that..now I’m just gonna download the files again,which is massive and hope it works like before
---
She’s a beaut, Clark.
---
He must visit often given all of the EDDs you've been posting.
---
This. Since smoke lost impacts, it's even more relevant to take the shotgun over the FMG. It's not that the FMG is strictly bad (it's pretty comparable to the mp5k honestly), but now since mute even has the SMG 11 the utility the shotgun brings is too good to pass up in a lot of ways. That being said, you shouldn't be *afraid* to play SMG primary if you do well with it and it suits you. 
---
Most teams, even with randoms, someone can open the rotate regardless and although the utility can help, unless you're high up there in rank chances are those strats aren't going to make or break your ranked experience.
---
The SMG 11's rate of fire can shred people up close and from a range and can be controllable by burst firing. The shotgun is great for going up close combat, and making rotate holes. A If the roamers need their impacts and no anchors have impacts the shotgun will do for making site rotation holes.

Only if it were universal

Wait thats illigal

Ela lives in a society.

Suppressors reduce recoil allowing for easier headshots

I love how you mematic users never use any sort of crop function on your phone... that could’ve been easily cropped out of the picture lol

I'd love to see a fast cycle true burst weapon in this game like an M16.

Lol hells yeah

Yeah no.

R6 seems a million miles away from the themes of Gris.

Stop playing with those toxic people, that‘s not good for ur mental health. Forget them, look for new people or just solo que, it works fine as well.

What is a shadow buff???
---
Does this MF have a trench coat lol
---
Maybe console crossplay with the new generation, but nothing confirmed.
---
Don't use reddit.

Which do you prefer ?

There was no shadow buff. It was just a visual recoil improvement to the gun model.

A buff not in the Patch notes

Hells yeah baby!!! Lol

It gives me a tactical advantage. You know why? Because my sensitivity and dpi works a lot better with this aspect ratio, resulting in me having to do a whole lot less to get comfortable with my recoil control, flicks and aiming overall.
---
Sometimes it's not about the amount you see, or what is in your vision. It works with my mouse:screen ratio (:
---
Yeah but that made her in my onion better
---
Can confirm.

Console players do NOT want to vs PC players. The aim assist isn't strong enough like Halo or CoD.

'#globalranks , IIRC overwolf shows you the mrr of the region where they are ranked highest. Every region you have a separate rank, he likely isnt plat on your region
---
I mean what’s the MMR difference if it’s more then 1,000 then you’ve got a solid case... but overall it’s just a game so live and let live
---
Lmfao no, ubi does everything to make us happy and still we cry about what we get. “It’s not enough” it’s way more than enough. Ya’ll are like the people from those popular clips a while back when they used to cry about getting a lamborghini because “it’s the wrong color”. Give ubi a break, please...
---
I get what you mean, but I think with a few changes it could look better than the current.
---
Hipfireing like apex
---
The issue is that making something a universal skin takes some time, there are (to my knowledge) just under 100 guns, including secondaries, in Siege.
---
But it would look fire tho.
---
In hammer and scalpel not a single weapon is fired as well IIRC. It could very well be a tactical training. 
---
And I mean, this all in VR is not that far fetched? We got games today that have very similar play in VR, wouldn't you think that the most funded military company in the entire *world* would have a little bit higher tech?

it can take up to 24 hours to receive them. Restart the game and see if they are there. If not, and they aren't there within 24 hours, just message support. You'll be aight.
---
Wouldn’t you just be able to get the gun model and apply a gradient to it then manually place the logo?
---
You can add me as well. ArrowSlit
---
I have tried restarting the game, uplay, steam, my pc. Nothing helped. I have already contaced support and have yet to get a reply. And its been almost 24 hours
---
2/10 IQ’s gadget is on the wrong hand. Jk good job. It is nice!
---
Well wait for support then? Not much else you can do about it.
---
Did anybody of you recognized that it is Oregon? Its a rework of it, so it is definetly coming to the game next year

Hello rainbowconcepts, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eainxg/rainbow_six_siege_operator_concept/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So you’re saying you wanted the clash glitch be return?
---
i only like a few elite like from twitch valk and blackbeard BUT  
---
my personal fav skins are from GLAZ and ELA   
---
ela was an instant buy
---
Im waiting, just thought id ask the community for any advice and help they might have
---
Italian man gets hammered hard  against the wall by large Scottish man on local outback. Public
---
Im happy he made that tutorial so ubi is able to disable her before players start abusing it in ranked.
---
What ADS sens is 1:1? 100?
---
Making it universal is not just a press of a button. It takes effort to re-design it for more than 90 guns therefore it won't be universal
---
yester day i got 666 renow very nice
---
A DOOR !? O.O
---
Rook is doing a party, he NEEDS to have a lot of plates y'know?

---
I took reference from movie undisputed 2 with Scott Adkins. He kickes just like that so I used that
---
What door?
---
You mean garage door?
---
That is a weird looking garage door
---
No, try it in a custom game. Put a claymore and don't move then just move your mouse a little bit
---
SLOW THE FUCK DOWN !
---
Alibi’s mx4 storm is a headshot machine but you have to switch your Holo placements a lot during a match.
---
Kaid has his sniper shotty with high damage and a shit ton of recoil also his gadget just got buffed now being able to shock three walls.
---
Choose whichever fits your play style
---
Oh my brother, Testify!  
---
In all seriousness, I'm with you, please help Blitz Ubi.
---
Mate, that's because your legs changes position when you turn????
---
The laser wasn't touching his legs, it was inbetween his legs, when he turnt his leg was in the laser and THEN it triggers.
---
If you like to use shotguns and trapping people from windows, I suggest you get Frost. But, Valk's SMG is pretty good in my opinion, and she also got deagle. The cameras help too. So, I suggest you get valk first and then frost
---
I'd get 50 common duplicates.
---
i played ela from day one to these days still my main defender 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; I'm not sure if on PC it's usable 
---
it is some sort of usable i was plat 2 and got many frags with ela every round still u can feel the nerf's sometimes
---
&gt;  good utility (a camera or impacts) 
---
yeah at the moment in this state ela need impacts i mean her weapons are to weak if u don't go on HS so if you have impact u can  drawback  or try to outplay the enemie it would give her a nice little advantage
---
&gt; right now she is the weakest romaer by far 
---
yeah but every peron is different some one like me loves to play her because she  adapts my play style and for other persons its like impssible to paly with her example i play very good with ela but i am shitty with maverick and buck -\_-
---
&gt; is there any specific reason to not buff Ela? 
---
i think the devs fear that if they buff her she will be like in teh beginning
---
This pose is redrawn from scott adkins fighting in undisputed 2 lol so you're telling that scott adkins dont know how to fight hahah ;)
---
At least there isn't a glitch for my main in attack, thank god

Pretty sure it's tower
---
Tachanka probably felt the air passing next to him

Bro, trust me if you stood still and didn't move after putting a claymore then I am 100% sure it's not going to blow up. I would want to try it to prove it to you but I'm currently not in home

---
Favela does too, and some other maps.
---
But bartlett had actual doors you could walk up to by the surrounding buildings.
---
implying it's not ubi fault

Let’s ask for bikinibodhi to ask Ubisoft to buff the scorpion for PC players

Someone hasn't seen Twitch's elite.

I’m one of those plats😂

#emp incomin
---
oh god new weapon pls ubi, im good at any concept that you make
---
I like how this sub is 95% cosplay, home made cartoons, skins and other shit that's doesn't have anything to do with the gameplay.
---
The juveline skin obsession especially plays right into the hand of Ubisoft's mtx.
---
Just got killed by one
---
what about mobile turret?
---
Almost 2+ years of playing seige and i didnt even realise doors do not exist in this game
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
I don't like the idea, just because the use of the turret is to have a lot of concentrated firepower and know exactly where you are shooting because it doesn't move. Having it be mobile would ruin that, and not having to take it down to move it would be overpowered
---
but mobile turret
---
Sorry to break it to you, medium mode bots are as aware as a lump of meat
---
I was messing around with my settings
---
Okay but how the fuck is a single new texture somehow news or something that has to be announced? 
---
Are we impulsive children who can't help but spend the tendies mommy gave us on new colorful textures?
---
Its a nice skin and all but this sub is 95% focused on cosplay, childish cartoons and skins as opposed to the actual gameplay. 
---
Is it perhaps an age thing? Are most people here literally children perhaps? 
---
Its really strange.
---
They removed it for balancing
---
All weapons released before/during operation black ice has it
---
buying software from rolynoly that player has a chance to get banned.

So am I, that's why I have it on that difficulty

I don't think anyone cares...

I love how they're fighting on top of what looks to me like the turret of a (German btw) Leopard 2

Is it possible to learn this power?
---
"The legends were true"
---
So confused theirs like two camps rn about this skin. 
---
The one camp are straight up in love with this elite wishing she was real an shit so they could marry her on god.
---
Then you got these other dudes talkin trash about her animation and that seems to be their main reasoning for hating her is that the MVP animation is shit.
---
Just enjoy your holiday, dude. Its just a skin (a seriously fucking awesome skin!!!)
---
Plat bud, a rank you've never seen ;)

Indeed. Ideal supermodel woman body to legs ratio is 1.4. This is 2.1

---
Which was the pic? Point is that considered her feet stance either that was a front high kick, so you need to fix the upper leg and foot, or it was a high roundhouse kick (not sure about English translation, check High mawashi Geri) so you need to rotate her hips and maybe torso a lil bit, hips for sure, torso it’s a matter of perspective but that’s a kick that usually requires hips and torso rotations

Like siege isn't all about camping and holding angles.
---
I wish the problem was that simple
---
yes im fucking salty but i remember back in the fucking day when you didnt have to take shit like this so take your shitty comments somewhere else
---
Nope if you think about Nokk and her ability, it is a bit different then the Chameleon Device, it cloaks him, and wards of Thermal and Cardiac detection. He can be seen by normal cams but you'll only see is cloaked body. He doesn't have silent step like Nokk and he can't use his primary weapon either only secondary like Cav.
---
Since when have you had problems? I haven't had any on pc?
---
It reminds me of that fade camo from CSGO
---
All glaz mains: Am I a joke to you?
---
I mean nothing is going to happen with a rant like this, only you will most likely be banned from the subreddit. So yeah...
---
The multiplayer of Siege is meant to be like a vr training operation for the ops where as t hunt is the only thing in the game that is real life
---
Gridlock has to be number one
---
since today me and a friend was gonna que and he gets into the game himself while i get an error and then i cant join a game at all after that even if i restarted
---
He sprayed a horizontal line lol

A what?

yes but i am so fucking mad i have to rant to someone

Technically they do playtest all updates, infact, we do it on the TTS, but did you try simply updating your graphics?

the post is already downvoted for asking a simple question

Completely unrelated but what attachments do you use in your scorpion?
---
Its ping abuse mah siege frnd
---
I'd rather it have Cross save
---
No surprise.
---
Dude same crap happens to us. Ranked is fun until you hit about Gold II. Then the matchmaking completely breaks. I personally hate the way the placements matches work. They seriously need to think about a redesign for ranked matchmaking because it doesnt work half the time.
---
It told me on the notification for getting the stuff. Did you get the notification in game?
---
Virgil drop shot
---
Yeah, people praise seige, but it's completely different from all the other Rainbow games.

Ela mine her

CoD is a speedshooter.
---
Siege is a tactical shooter.
---
Camping in siege is normal.
---
Last CoD is good, the rest of them to BO2 are shit and there's a reason the producer brought back old playstyle.
---
It sucks but regarless it's not a alphapack you paid for if they did it with the paid ones I could see where you are coming from, but here its just eh that kinda blows

I saw the notification about the free skin and charm but didn't see which gun the skin was for day of

Laser tripped claymores are banned by Geneva convention, you can still use the old cable detonated or remote manual detonation via physical cable so I doubt that you'd be able to verify that statement of yours
---
That's very true. I just needed to rant gayer last night haha.
---
Gotta help Goku make the spirit bomb
---
If you're a hard flanker a suppressor can be amazing. It's harder to pinpoint exact locations, especially if you constantly rotate.
---
It's definitely on a gun by gun basis though. Like jackals pdw suppressed is an underrated weapon. Same with the FMG-9.
---
More like shifting face
---
They should have doors at the start of the game, then it should break like a barricade,(with a melee) but fracture like a wooden door instead of the blinds patterns.
---
He looks very polite :)
---
Camping in every game is normal. It's a tactic people use to stay safe. Complaining about camping is idiotic and childish. If you die to a camper then you died to your own inability to be aware of your surroundings. 
---
Speaking of jokes, making up new terms like speedshooter to justify a disdain for the tactic of camping is a joke. I'm done.
---
Rank doesn’t mean shit. Trust me. If you want to improve you’ll improve as much as you wish and like. No teammates and a bad setup will hold you back of course but at that point you can have the confidence that that’s the only thing holding you back.

It's a good source of free renown if you played long enough and own a ton of cosmetics. I usually got my drop at around 20-30% and I was very happy about getting a duplicate of any kind because it meant I had to farm less for next (seasonal) cosmetic bundles, rest was a bonus.
---
It would be nice if they disabled legendary duplicates at some point in the future with the ever-growing pool of items but at the same time, there isn't really a point in doing that, legendaries in this game don't really mean anything besides just being named legendary since there is no consistency quality wise with them.
---
Recruit doesn't need to be touched. His concept is pretty basic, but that's because you're not supposed to choose him, ever (especially since he's not in ranked)
---
The MMR rank climbing process is no different from opening a lootbox.

This song is so on point😂😂

Coastline is one of the best maps in Siege

maybe 2 speed mp7

I just spent 20 mins trying to find this thinking it was a universal :(

What on? PC, Xbox, or PS4? Cause I want to download that and make sims live there (If I get the game)

damn there almost identical

only black ice is important

Moderators review the complete history of eligible applicants. Previous bans would come up in this and it's absolutely something we'd look at.

thats kinna pointless... wouldnt you rather just move on and everyone would have the most health they can? its a good system but its kinna just silly
---
Love this comment
---
What if you need to reinforce the hatch above lobby in consulate on attack? That would be a good time to pick him.
---
Respectable
---
Thermite main you should be happy, now you get to open the hatch. benefits all.
---
Jeez what rank are you in that almost half of the enemy team was oblivious to you
---
Why not
---
But what about Fuze 👀
---
Any source?
---
It was
---
Her primary gadget is the lusion and silent step not interrogations and so what if it was her primary ability. Primary abilities should still get nerfed if they are overpowered. While i agree cav and blitz don't need a nerf. All they said was they have high ban rates and they "are discussing how we want to approach the topic of balancing them."
---
Only 30 minutes
---
Cringe
---
They were constantly moving, baricading etc. (u could see that on the drone before this clip :p ) But whoever was standing would die thanks to the head level
---
Ok thank you. I’ve only been banned once for a week but if I were to become a moderator I of course would approach conversation from a more professional standpoint and set an appropriate example.
---
OMG OMG ONG OMG IM BUYING THAT RN
---
beeeeaaand him, mate.
---
We don't take the game very seriously at all. We're pretty toxic to each other, (not in terms of trash talk, but like... fucking with each other) but it's all fun for us.
---
You died to that frost mat didn’t you
---
I compared the recoil from both seasons and you can see she has less visual recoil....
---
But why an attacker would want to reinforce the hatch
---
This is your teammate though, so it's not really that sad like a random tk'd you.
---
I take it you’re relatively new to the game? You used to be able to throw back grenades but it was removed

Yeah I don't understand why killing your teammate in game would fix this? I usually track them down and Murder their whole family while they watch. Then I electrocute them with batteries. After that I go back and report them for friendly fire.
---
no it wouldnt, because you dont reinforce on attack

Oh wow. I’m just 3 weeks young but I wish I joined it earlier.
---
The BLeaguers podcasts w/ Flynn and Stoax made a point why 2 universals come out per season and the uniforms suck ass. Uhh just has too much shit to put them all on.
---
Ive got an old clip where it was the exact same way but with barbed wire and a frost mat on it
---
That wasn't a buff, nor a shadow buff or change. That was a major thing that happened to all smgs. The visual recoil has been lessened. But...The actual recoil is still the same. Visually it seems like there's less. In reality there is not. It is the only gun in siege without a recoil diamond. It's still random.
---
Thank you. Very cool!
---
Played ranked for the first time yesterday and my team mate told me to stop being shit and called me a retard, called him insecure or something like that, tked as soon as the round starts.

There's no minimum age requirement to apply.

Ahahhhahhahahaha

Macie jay is pretty good

i feel like having it be universal like the matt color skins would take away from the "uniqueness" i  guess, but if it was a skin like black ice that is really rare i'd probably say yes 100%
---
Nobody is safe from Fuze
---
He used the force
---
Who are you to decide that it was never designed to be a tool for balancing. For all you know that is one of the reasons they implemented it.
---
Sigh...
---
*unzips*
---
 Shouldn’t leave them
---
Yes but it’s more fun if you can actually access your weapon after you break something so you don’t die instantly
---
Um, was there just another dead body there?
---
Some kind of bandage, I love it
---
Yeah the daddy issues skin looks good
---
Same, I need the operator card/artwork in high res
---
Never mind, that was a bad analogy from my part.
---
Also who tf bans blitz?..
---
This is the biggest big dick move I’ve ever seen. *I’m* terrified and I’m not even playing
---
It looks great. Hit me up if you find it.

So I should sit in a 5 minute queue?

That’s a megabuster

Console players I guess

I mean, you are Cav after all......

Indeed.

If you dont play ranked then your going to get tm8's that kill you. Also if you dont play ranked your probably not going to get much better at the game.
---
Are you planning on sharing this? I’d love to make Jackal and Mira Sims, then maybe make them live here.
---
I'll be honest, I binded crouch to spacebar when crouch spamming was a thing. yes, i know, i am scum. Regardless, once that got patched, I realised that binding crouch to spacebar was really beneficial in the long run.
---
Where? how is it free?

EDIT: nevermind. Just checked. I got it. Why do I have it?

Just... tell me it's not ranked

Fair point thanks

Mate this is it I'm actually DONE, the only thing you've said on your side of the discussion is that Ubisoft reporting system is faster than mzn just uploading a video. It isn't as soon as mzn uploads a video you have about 2 days sometimes less and a temp fix in in the game. That's your whole argument I've given you several other points of rebuttal and you still cant see the other side. Take it easy I'm muting this post now.

---
I don't think people ban operators because they need balancing changes, but rather, they ban them because they're annoying to play against.  It's not that hard to bring an IQ to deal with Echo's drones, but if you have the option to ban him and not have to deal with it, why wouldn't you just do that instead?  Same thing with Cav.  Don't want to have to be bothered with droning out every little corner of the map?  Ban her.  You might still die, but at least it won't endanger your whole team.  Blitz isn't particularly overpowered anymore, he's just annoying.
---
TL:DR-the most banned ops aren't overpowered, they're annoying.  They don't need nerfs, someone's always going to be on top of the "I just really really don't want to deal with that" list.

Believe it or not.. I was confused which one is R6S in the second row. I know it was obvious by the UI but I DID NOT noticed it at first and was trying to read the sign on the right thinking it’s from Sims4. 
---
I’m using my phone it pic isn’t that big to notice the UI.
---
Good job buddy! This looks cool

But why does the nail gun say “Scruffy” on the side?
---
Clever af, wouldn't even be mad
---
nICE
---
That’s a no from me dawg 😂
---
If not the fact that they are better, it’s that five stacks are annoying to play against in ranked because a decent five stack will win against a team with solo queues and no communication. Five stacks should fight other five stacks and they currently don’t and that’s the problem
---
Okay u.u
---
Looks like the type of gal who hangs around a seedy bar.  The kind that will give you bumps.
---
Ela certainly doesn't have a fat batty, unlike Twitch - who does.
---
No the game gives you a replay, so he knows it.
---
Yes I get that he wont see this but I never said it would be faster its but would be less damaging
---
Still better than Ela..
---
Just use the report button instead of being a tattle tale cry baby on the internet.
---
dont neck shots count as headshots?
---
So report it, dummy.
---
Seeing as I thought at first the left images were from siege, I think you did a good job :)
---
like really I don't want to say this to any person but now I just have it, you are stupid, how can I guy really think the old herford is better than the new one for competetiv, everyone say it is better but still far away from being good enough.
---
Like already the argue with old herford is better because it was in pro league gave me headache
---

💙💙💙 thank you
---
I will never reveal friendly positions because of a thot.
---
Not because I put his team first, but I'm afraid they will hate me.
---
Pls retreat to your safe space to calm your nerves
---
Oh! That's actually really cool, didn't know that.
---
I don’t get why they didn’t just make it so the skill based matchmaking scales to the player with the highest MMR in the squad.  That way you could still pay with your friends but also prevent boosting.  I’m tired of not being able to play with my friends on ranked when it’s so much more enjoyable than casual/quick play
---
yes but i thought the devs sometime in sieges lifespan changed it so neckshots will count as a headshot in the game to "remove confusion."
---
8 3
---
honestly, i find it to be a bit flashy and not great in a tactical game like siege. the mvp animation is dope tho.
---
They don't hate it because they are bad, they get caught out by it because they are bad. They get angry at it because they came to play a game not sit and watch their equally shit teammates play a game for 3 minutes. 
---
It's pretty frustrating to spend most of a game watching other people play just because you made a daft mistake.

You say it is a team game but have you ever solo queued? Third of the time no one talks and when they do its just complaining how they die. The game is basically just fragging each other
---
No. Cav is fine as is and shouldn’t be reworked because lower ranks don’t want to put on a headset and communicate with their team.
---
I think you’re right. I guess it was because the hibana was moving to the left he must have shot her left (his right) shoulder
---
accept for the fact it is in my case
---
In a sense. Clash's covers a very similar area, with the difference of her's being that it can be melee'd away like any other shield op. So technically Montagne has the one up that his can't be melee'd aside when it's fully extended, where's Clash's is fully transparent allowing much better visibility, with the downside of not being able to hipfire her sidearm at all when it's deployed at all. Though she does get her zap attack.
---
I support this fully.
---
Worda take the fun out of games? You most be weak.  Ignore it, it's not hard.
---
This was supposed to be heart warming not make me cry
---
*sad glaz noise*
---
they were definite smurfs. three of them had gamerscore below ~500
---
Another update hit gold 3
---
You cant buy alpha packs or renown with money
---
okay but...
---
does her shield have any weak-points?
---
montagne is completely immune to bullets from the front
---
this was a gold game, and three people were smurfing, definite high ranks
---
I would watch that .
---
I think it would create balancing issues
---
1) I never said it was better
---
2) you still can’t spell competitive so until then your argument has ZERO traction
---
New meta lol
---
Neat, now make a good map
---
this is awesome, best cav makeup i've seen
---
That seems like a great nerf, it is now impossible to defend the garage in chalet if they have a capitao and anything to blow up the kaid/bandits. but with an ads you have an extra step where your team has to expend some utility to clear it.

Hello NoCopyrightCity, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eaqe8v/does_this_new_season_have_many_graphic_glitches/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I like how you didnt forgive his team kill

Link to the leak?

Here you can see a wild Hibana and a dominating Doc fighting each other .

Well, i recommend you to return the monitor and ask for another because of this defective. Who knows what gonna be next
---
Or clubhouse Cash wall

Unless practical is fun and unpractical is not, like for many people
---
Anywho rogue 9 has a video about this. Exact specifics are hidden to keep people from gaming the algorithm,  but the short version is you get points based on a few things
---
How the game thinks you play (factors in tons of stuff)
---
Win/lose
---
Win/loss rate
---
Rank
---
1 is a positive number so I’d say yeah if your KD is one it’s positive. However if you really wanted to see if your KD is above or below 1 go to r6tracker and manually divide your kills by deaths and you’ll get a more precise number. Either use overall kills/deaths or just ranked kills/deaths
---
They need to make it known what decides the mmr gain/loss cause it doesn't seem to be based of of anything but if you lose you lose a rank and you have to win 2 in a row if you want to gain a rank
---
just look it up on Youtube. I don't know what the rules are about sharing leaks on this subreddit.
---
Ty
---
Think we can have a link to it?
---
Originally hatched didnt exist. Game was basically unplayable as attack always won. They exist now and without it the game doesn't work
---
Hello NotLucas21! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**

Not really just sorta fun and a sense of accomplishment

I pre aim spawn and end up getting shot before I can even see them 🤷
---
Que shouldnt be 10 minutes in the US think you have some issue bmy guy
---
Last time I played Capitaõ didn’t have such great guns.
---
There's differnece between "proper hipfire" and "bullet goes 45 degrees down from the fucking muzzle"
---
You just made 3 people go for their report buttons
---
I addressed this already. Shield hipfire used to be decent, but it was unbalanced. They nerfed it for a reason.
---
Nah dawg he died
---
can confirmed, died.
---
No. It's a team game. Learn how to find and play with a team.
---
Im not talking shit. Gridlock is, acording to WHO calculators, obese. As in not overweight, obese. There are tall girls, like 189 cm Amaru, 175 cm IQ, that weight less and look more... operational. Most of operators, including women, are higher than average.
---
If it were a simulation how would destruction work? If a bomb can blow up a wall surely it could kill someone
---
Easy dint olay on 4:3 that's not any good reason to
---
It's dependent on time of day, but lately my queue has just been long. Even on weekends. I highly doubt it's on my end.
---
It's all over Youtube. Just look for it.

Don't want to run out of ammo in your next shot... Of one shot
---
I don't think there are any rules against leaks.
---
I just had a look, the map and skins look pretty cool but as far as I can see it's just the regular Bomb gamemode?
---
A zero recoil M249 LMG with 81 bullets 🤔🤔🤔
---
Why do people wanna fix what ain't broke? 
---
Just git gud
---
Maybe try and set steam language to English or maybe even the language on your pc? Usually it's not a problem with the game itself, so I'm not sure if there's an option ingame.
---
Are you the spawnpeeker or the attacker?
