especially disappointing

---
---
No, Doc is fine where he is.
---
yeah thats why i get 6mmr if i bet silvers even if i do 15/3.. its who you're facing
---
I've been playing him with the shotgun almost every site regardless. It has a better close-range kill potential for the corner-creeping his slow speed and up-close gadget demands, especially when encountering Blitz or rushing enemies.
---

or they could nerd the K1A and buff the SMG12

i saw a jager one, both r great üòÄ

Rank checks out
---
Classic Ubisoft right here folks
---
Flash already isn't a guaranteed effect, you are risking a lot when you rush into a flash'ed room with no intel, Warden or no
---
ubi has been slapping me in the face with commons until last night theyre just like "sure lets give the man a legendary on 2% chance"
---
He was joking mate
---
Would be cooler though if he hadn't blatantly stolen someone else's work. At least credit the man if you're going to blatantly copy him.

Is that looked down upon?

I often see them setup like this
---
You're not gonna get any charms for staying on an offline Twitch channel. Dunno about your second question, but I would assume you do.
---
Thanks
---
Right now, overtime match point is the deciding factor between evenly matched teams winning or losing at 4-4. Instead of that deciding factor being only one round, I wish it would be winning 2 rounds rather than one. This is used in pro league already. Hope this clear that up.
---
When he reveals your location for 25 seconds, has arguably the best weapons of the game, and the there is absolutely fuck all you can do about it, besides Maverick, Jackal has no hard counter. The fact that that he literally presses a button and your screwed for 25 seconds is a bit much, he doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
Doc is a balanced operator. I mean ya you can say he‚Äôs the only op in the game that can heal except finka which isn‚Äôt a heal but more a short health buff but that is what he is meant to do and he does it well. Stop hating on a balanced op just because you die from him or can‚Äôt finish your kills
---
Chef Skinner has really changed career path since Gusteau‚Äôs got closed down huh?
---
Me and a friend played ranked and it was great for our 10 placements matches, but then every game after we got put into a 2v5. It was obnoxious. We didn‚Äôt even play poorly.
---
Feels for recruit and am I just blind but is glad not in this pic?
---
Slight correction, this is a workaround.
---
It would be nice if ubi could fix this bug that has been in the game for at least 2 years.
---
+1 respect
---
Thats epic. Good play on words
---
If it takes longer than 5 minutes, then I don't bother staying. I don't vote people out though.
---
As mentioned in your other comment, most times it is just a couple of minutes, however, I have been stuck in some that going on for longer than 5 minutes. I always tell myself the round will start in a moment, but it never does.
---
But the point you're trying to make could be used for everything too. The person that was TKed could win it for you. The person who is yelling through the Mic could win it for you. The twitch on your team who does nothing but zap their teammates with her drone could win it for you. The person people vote kicked for not having a Mic could win it for you. 
---
Hopefully people stop with that shit, but at the same time I know they won't.
---
Good job
---
I would‚Äôve just walked away from my computer if that happened to me
---
Try out muzzle brake, it helps with the 1st shot recoil, which looks like what fucked you up.
---
when you destroy drones and stuff (which is what i did in the clip) the hitmarker is white. still super confused.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Moving the mouse counts against the timer, which is absolutely stupid
---
ela is not controlable on pc either.
---
How
---
That was him saying:
---
"Are you *SURE* you want to do that...?"
---
OP stole the idea from someone else, so not his permission to give lol.
---
Doc is perfectly fine, he got nerfed slightly a while ago.
---
Have you tried shooting them
---
its not low... but i get your point
---
Is this a joke?
---
Then I have literally no idea xd
---
Hmmmm I‚Äôve been using it on smoke for a while and it‚Äôs not the worst.
---
What if they made it so if your ranks vary by more than 3-4 then mmr is disabled for your team. Like if a plat 3 is with a gold 3 or 4 then they can't earn or lose mmr but maybe the enemy team can win like half mmr if they win.
---
How do intel ops ruin the game? They all have such easy counters dokk=turn your phone off lion=don‚Äôt move jackal=keep moving
---
Ikr it has like none
---
Excuse me what the fuck?
---
Yo thanks for linking my post.
---
Oh okay, how rare is it to get black ice tho?  :)
---
It's not a gaurenteed effect because if someone isn't flashed it's because they were looking away from the angle. That's what flashed off an angle means. It allows you to take that angle. It isn't just a thing in Rainbow six seige. Look at competitive cs or any other game it's a core mechanic. Being able to counter that entirely is op because it counters a huge portion of operators.
---
Pretty sure super rare. Lol I'm lvl 100 and gotten two
---
Wow
---
Low recoil low damage
---
excuse you bitch it's my first time using it and it had recoil
---
Lion must be happy for barely getting banned
---
When you hear a barricade open behind you and you turn around
---
Well see I have but I just never seem to be in that beautiful 0.5 meter range required to kill them with it
---
Honestly , love getting dupes .
---
Renown boost to help me get OPs or seasonal skins .
---
Drones are always white, but destroying gadgets like air jabs (which you did if you look at the points you earned for the c4), fuse charges, breaches, those will get you red hit markers, it‚Äôs been like that for quite a long time
---
Plus the ten seconds for each of the 4 ban phases. I'm not opposed, I'm just saying the more they would add to the beginning of the actual game, the less people want to fool with it. If my match wait time is a minute, post round is a minute, pre-match voting is a minute, and so on... I'm going to eventually be spending more time not playing the game than actually playing.
---
When I used it I could tell it kicked
---
No he got mindfucked and clipped it
---
I dont play him as an anchor. I like him much better as a roamer.
---
‚ÄúGotta pee BRB‚Äù
---
You said he‚Äôs one of the worst attackers
---
then I think they'd just play casual tbh..
---
go to sng.one (mot plugging them) they literally sell ddos 
---
Ddos is a big problem on ps4 higher ranks please fix ubi
---
i didnt get a senior quote or even a hat at all
---
Happened to me on PC as well. Had to restart to fix it.
---
Dude they can't stop smurfing. Ranked kdr means nothing to the casual algorithm, it's an elo system, same as ranked. Casual elo is hidden. You can't say that u/YEETDABDABXDDD's alt account should be banned because it shouldn't. 
---
If they're on pc, Smurf accounts kinda help Ubisoft by giving them more money. On console, it's just a hassle. I have 2 alt accounts. After only a few matches I get bored; I have no operators. Sure I'd have year 3 and 4 because of my passes, but that gets boring. 
---
Ubi cannot ban smurf accounts, because there is no way to distinguish what is a smurf and what is not. People get beginner's luck all the time, people have friends who try to help them play, so they play for them and let them learn from a more experienced playstyle. If they start banning what they think are smurfs, they undoubtedly would ban some main accounts, which is bad for business. 
---
If you don't want smurfs getting the best of you, then get better at the game like the rest of us did. Beat the Smurf until his blue blood drips down your shirt and covers your hands and you stand victorious over him. All you have to do to stop smurfs is get better. You won't encounter them anymore once you get better. Many games have places where they beat you down. Be it "bad time" in undertale, or any point in the dark souls games, you get utterly destroyed. From there, you get good. You get better and better until you're that first dark souls boss, and nothing can defeat you. You find those smurfs on their mains and you year them limb from limb until only you stand at the top. Become that person, and your problem with smurfs will disappear.
---
If you want an Italian operator, play Maestro or Alibi.
---
Damn, now that's a good comment
---

We are few and far between amig@
---
If a dead op on the opposing team or his was killed (unless it was an explosion) he can search the body for any remaints of the ability.U can set how long it takes for him to search.
---
He cant do it moving for a reason because it nullifies too many strategies and would him op. They realized that and made it so he couldn't do it. He already is a perfect counter for blitz and pretty good for holding down a site. It really is fine how it is.
---
Just hopped on for some fun enemies were so bad I thought I'd help but they denied it
---
See this man right here has a rational answer
---
Yes. Your starting MMR will be the average of your previous season MMR and 2500 but no lower/higher than 1500/3500
---
That just me or does that fov look weird?
---
I play maverick with the m4 red dot
---
O O F
---
Ubi should just delete hostage mode altogether  
---
I mean I disabled it in the matchmaking preference for a year now and I never miss it
---
Any suggestions for the icon?
---
Might help if the game didnt take 2 min to load them in
---
Cause the new system places you closer to where you were last season so they give you less points to make up for the change
---
The main thing I hate about it is the dishonesty. It‚Äôs fucking infuriating to play against a level 23 with a 2.9 KD only because he‚Äôs playing on a new account. I want to get better, and I certainly have, but being ducked down repeatedly by dishonest people doesn‚Äôt increase anyone‚Äôs skill.
---
Explains why I placed in plat 2. Thank you
---
No i want you to have as much freedom with this as you can and if it gets hate it was my idea
---
Alright, soon as I post it you'll get the credit. I'll do my best to make em look good.

Literally everyone, the 1x sight just causes you to play a little more aggressive because you can't sit back and hold angles
---
I'mma 144 hz player, but I'll give you high-fps-pass for the lulz
---
He‚Äôs saying it forces people to play at their actual ranks. Bomb is a difficult game mode because it forces the attackers and the defenders to come in close combat. If you can‚Äôt take the heat get out of the kitchen.
---
It's the skin tight pants. Happens in every game ever.
---
wait what
---
Considering the way products for real people turn out, this isn't that bad
---
Wins if it was based off kills ranked would be a mess
---
Afaik Mira is the "lead gadget maker" or whatever you want to call it. I read it somewhere (perhaps bio?). But 100% I read it in official lore.
---
Yeah its only here on Xbox and PS4 that smurfing is bad, but we can't do a thing about it. On PC it helps ubi and gets them more revenue, so
---
I got gold2 going five for five ending last season with mid gold1.

Just five stack lol
---
Its the new season release. All the pro league wannabes showed up. Dont worry, they will be gone in like a month or two and casual will go back to... well... casual.
---
Maybe the one where you blow someone up with a breach charge
---
Pause - Options - Matchmaking - Go down to maps and turn Bartlett off. Make sure you accept the changes.
---
"Oh look at me, i play a mode that pro league plays too and i press 7 seconds a button to plant as monty so my teammates can hold an angle to the obj. My skill is frightening"
---
I also like how you avoided all my other arguments and pretty much just told me that i was pissy.
---
Im sure that someone who only plays bomb is happy with the new changes.
---
And i once read that over 50% of the console playerbase play on secure area so idk where you got that from with the majority.
---
I just want Old Hereford back for casual. It's some of the most fun I've had in a game, even if it was as unbalanced as a drunk minor taking her first steps out of a club.
---
I have that one.

N√∏kk‚Äôs makes her look like she‚Äôs hailing a cab... or a certain significant German figure from the past

Ah -- word. It's one of the few I've seen that looks ill. Have a good one, homie.

This is the thing I don't understand when I see people play Blitz. Why in god's name did he ADS after seeing that it's Warden?
---
I stand by this as well. ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°üí£üî´üó°
---
Thanks, I'm definitely going to join that. I had no idea that was a thing
---
That was frustrating on so many levels. Mostly first floor though.
---
Any news on this? Have a friend who ahs the same thing, he reinstalled the whole game and we managed to play one game before it  started again. And no response from ubi support at all.
---
Thanks buddy I‚Äôll try it out! Appreciate that you took the time out to help
---
pocket edition huh...
---
I enjoy that painting
---
No sorry. We also contacted Ubisoft and battleeye support but no response yet.
---
He did cocaine, smoked weed, he drinks all the time, that's why he looks like that lol. I assume that's why bandit looks like that.
---
What... The fuck.... Is that üò≤
---
Same
---
You‚Äôre good b
---
Down someone then place it down and kaboom
---
Yes, what do you want?
---
You need an adapter to do this that Ubi can do nothing about only Microsoft and Sony can block it off. Also if your on Xbox add me to play ranked and msg me on Reddit and Xbox at SavageSniper116 ignore my ign pls lul
---
And that is what is so frustrating about it. Ubisoft will go to lengths to not piss of the PC side of the game. Their "Report toxic behavior" does something, albeit very little. They ban hackers and return MMR to those whose games were affected by the hackers. Why isn't there an equivalent on console? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It seems like they just don't care about console, although console makes up most of their player base.
---
He's seen some shit..

Sadly we'd have to see the whole picture. Pings, lag indicators etc. There are way too many factors to just immediately blame hitreg.
---
Ok i‚Äôll check on ~The Interwebs~
---
How?
---
I'm someone who plays 95% ranked bomb but I think these changes are stupid. Defending the new 3 rounds in a row because people might forget what site was played 2 rounds before is ruining variety and imbalancing the game for the sake of people who aren't paying attention. People getting "fake" ranks in hostage doesn't affect me at all. On the rare chance that I find myself playing one of the other 2 modes I just enjoy the variety and having to play in a different way. Most mid ranked soloQ players don't second think the defuser and play tdm anyway.
---
Honestly I can't believe the decision to use anvil every even got signed off on the first place. It's such an obviously horrible idea no idea what they were thinking
---
This happened to me a while ago, as in operation Grim Sky while ago, but I haven't seen it since. I have heard about it from friends though
---
Assuming Ubi made the real percentages round numbers, we can assume this:
---
Common: 40%
---
Uncommon: 25%
---
Rare: 20%
---
Epic: 10%
---
Legendary: 5%
---
Just play ranked and custom games against better people to improve skill and learn game sense, and do terrorist hunts for aim.
---
You can bait people into running in front of one. That's how I get easy kills lmao
---
Don't worry my 2nd game ever I dropped a ace
---
Ubisoft is clearly doing what they are suppose to do
---
Aye where the 75hz boys at
---
You may be right. But at the end of the day there is a higher caliber of player in bomb. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt think you can argue that the skill levels across the different game modes are equal. Plats In secure or hostage are golds or silver in bomb. Period. Making one game mode in ranked will put everyone where they are supposed to be.
---
Nope its back just like it use to be and people are already back to using it.
---
Robbery?

you can slowwalk a bit stuttering and it basically won't deplete while moving a bit, enough to peek. going in with an empty bar and waiting for the recharge isn't smart.

They should really just give warden smokes or flashes. This will make him unique and buff him to an acceptable level
---
I can see his mustache
---
Thank god cavs a permaban. I‚Äôd hate to watch her step on claymores since they are back
---
I know him in real life just haven't met him he's a shit talking half black guy who's cool for the most part but has an ego problem with bioplar to top it off I mainly threw him under the bus in this after we had lost that ranked because I was pissed as fuck he didn't put in any work because he was letting his ego play the game
---
**[CRUMBLY WHACK]**
---
**[BOTH CHUCKLES]**
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense, if a map is defender sided like you said and you are on attack and lose all three rounds now it‚Äôs your turn to defend. Now you can win the 3 defense rounds and go into OT, then it‚Äôs a one round rotation. If you get 4-0 you just don‚Äôt have good team coordination.
---
Glitches aren't "illegal" they're consequences of the way the game is coded. The hacks aren't illegal, just like how programs like gameshark and action replay aren't. Once again, I dont support hacking but I do promote free speech.
---
The type of glasses is wrong too
---
Lol he's a cool person just has a big ego and bipolar disorder
---
Sounds like someone cant hit headshots
---
Commissioner Warden nooooooooo
---
wait, what‚Äôs wrong here i don‚Äôt see it
---
I love this, please make more.
---
"Learn anything" i mean he is a former pro &amp; world champion too, respect
---
Same was 3-1 and we're winning the last round like 5v1 yet all of us disconnected and lost elo and couldn't reconnect back despite trying for ages. Had an abandon put on my record cause of that rubbish
---
Where does the arrow hit?
---
Dokkaebi has been getting banned a little but less than she was during the pick and ban event, probably because of her nerf
---
toenail?
---
Thank you!
---
So that's what fucking happened to me
---
But cheating is "doing anything that make you have an UNFAIR advantage"
---
As long as it is unfair, it is cheating.
---
How has that been going for you? I think Warden is a very cool character thematically but God damn as a casual pleb he might as well not have a gadget and is 1 speed.
---
F For Clash
---
i got hte same thing dude....
---
Speaking of which his favorite op is frost and I'm not sure if her low rate of fire is a disadvantage or not
---
That's why I was suggesting they at least they make it two round rotation, I just feel like anything is better than 3 round rotation.
---
*The whole thing is wrong*
---
I have 60k renown and I want the new ops and those two skins are 10k or below

Lucky you. Their team just laughed at us and rushed us. If we put up a fight they resorted to drop shooting teabagging us

For a moment I thought I saw Diamond 3 only to remember Plat is diamond

King is right though, the fact these guys can do this without punishment is pissing me off

I can do callouts but I'm horrible at remembering the room names despite being 170 and silver 1
---
interro was joking... fooled yourself
---
I would hope so
---
So I was able to do it in a solo custom match, but when I tried again later with buddies I couldn't get either way to work. That doesn't make sense to me though, so I'll keep trying, but  wanted to let you know.

Yes, cheating In-game is bannable but videos on hacks and cheats aren't illegal.

People out here legitimately downvoting this

They're taking in cash and Activision blizz is dying
---
That sounds like an interesting Season name, ngl
---
Vigil, Jager, valk, Ella are some of my favorite just for the shear roaming ability and speed I can traverse the map, they are also ops that you don‚Äôt hold their abilities till end round, you use them at the start and if you go down later no harm no foul.

FIXSIEGEY4S2
---
i can relate, i play on console &amp; was ddosed yesterday when we were about to reverse sweep our opponents.
---
Cause ubi don‚Äôt want it same with jackal lol.
---
This is so sad can we get 20,000 renown
---
I looked at this then looked at my screen and I saw the exact same thing
---
Wouldn't it be promoting cheats? Or Ubi can just a a rule to the EULA that says cheating also includes distributing cheats.
---
I really don't care how people play when their casual to be honest since it don't fuck with me to much only thing I care about is when I get cluster bomb kills with fuze and when I accidently yet cluster bomb aces with fuze oh my :)
---
I mean if the biggest problems in the game are with art styles, or lack thereof, then I think we‚Äôre at a good place in the game. But yeah, chunk don‚Äôt reflect in warden lol
---
I can‚Äôt use her vector but that looks like a good place to put a good tachanka too
---
*sweats in my cheap but trusty g300s*
---
yeah, it seems to start like the game is fine and everyone's ping is normal, but you'll be stationary or running in place, unable to even look around while the game goes on.
---
You should‚Äôve approached him and just said ‚ÄúM870 Rush?‚Äù.
---
Cool is there an option to turn Clash back on?
---
He has nba I played it with him and almost blocked him I cannot play sports games for my fucking life lol
---
In the building.
---
Yeah I was playing and was barely able to make it to the building
---
They are exploiting a glitch so that they win every game due to Forfiet Victory.
---
I was wondering why every other game reinforcements &amp; equipment deployment started taking a second longer to actually do. This shit is rampant now
---
Doc, aka tree trunk arms
---
Yeah it‚Äôs stupid to tk over that but honestly you were being a toxic kid so you deserved some retaliation
---
That logic doesn't make sense. If it is easier for you to win 3 defense, it is easier for them, too. Then you just end up in overtime. Bans only change the meta. So you might as well remove the parts of the meta that are stale, frustrating, or otherwise just not fun. Like being jackal tracked.
---
He was talking about server DDoS. Some players DDoS servers to not lose elo or to prevent others gaining elo I guess
---
Is it cheap then
---
What's been done about DDOSers?
---
That happened to me all you have to do is restart your game
---
Ddos? I don‚Äôt know siege slang, even though I‚Äôm lvl 187
---
Personally, I play with Controller on Console, but I don't think M&amp;K should be bannable. If I'm not mistaken, its compatable so anyone can do it if they choose to.
---
It won‚Äôt change anything even if you unite and kill all glitchers you still aren‚Äôt fixing the problem there are multiple rounds most of the time exploiters don‚Äôt play alone so your going to end up ruining the game by making it into a firefight at spawn. It‚Äôs not the players responsibility to combat glitchers not can the community do anything about it just stop being trying to be hero‚Äôs it just makes it worse for everyone
---
Because terrorist phones don‚Äôt ring when Dokkaebi calls them
---
Nah we know Thermite be slappin
---
Well these are also the guys that stopped making cool armor and headgear options they just occasionally do an elite skin where you have to equip the whole thing
---
I had the same problem, just play a match and it comes back
---
That‚Äôs not the nest line in the song... way to ruin a good thread. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs not always about hiding skill level. A while ago I reached diamond on two of my smurfs (it‚Äôs Xbox) and he only had 300 something gamerscore. 
---
Pretty good indicator it‚Äôs a smurf.

Why destroy their drone though? I get it that it's casual, and I get that it's just a drone, I'm not defending the TK, but there's no reason to do that. Doing shit like that just provokes people to TK, and having it happen more and more just seems to encourage others to do it too.
---
I'm not justifying the TK, but if you're just going to do little shit like that to your teammates, casual or not, just to fuck with them, perhaps you shouldn't be on the team.

I nearly had a heart attack, I‚Äôm only 16 goddamnit.

You haven‚Äôt explained how it makes it worse for everyone, in fact, you‚Äôve already agreed with me it makes it better for 50% of the people on the lobby. And that‚Äôs just a minimum. 
---
And it‚Äôs not a firefight at the spawn.. you only kill the glitcher once they have done the glitch.
---
It looks nothing like him but ok
---
Hi about a 5.3, I'm dad.
---
I don‚Äôt know about intentional glitch exploitation. I don‚Äôt do it, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs the player doing anything wrong, just making use of something in the game. It‚Äôs Ubisoft‚Äôs fault for not fixing their damn game. Operation Health 2 please.
---
He messed up by not getting the metal part on the corners. You make a ‚ÄúL‚Äù but you have to get every bit of those lines on the edge.

It looks likw it wants to kill me
---
If you look closely, you can see his Hitler-Stach on the chibi. Just don‚Äôt get too close, else you might n√∏kk him.
---
Yup this.  Back when I‚Äôd play 1000 games a season, I‚Äôd run into the same damn team that whenever we were winning the game would suddenly lag everybody out without losing elo.  His never happened when we were losing to them however.

That will be a slippery slope of arguments going down into hax being ok coz people can all buy them.. It is much easier just to stop where Ubi or other devs draw the lines with their TOS/EULA

Nah. Its screwed in to the wall. Cant you tell? üòÅ
---
A C O G
---
&gt;MAYBE your teammates would like the ‚Äúnoble deed.‚Äù That‚Äôs there‚Äôs a chance
---
It's more likely that they won't like the Noble deed.
---
&gt;sounds like someone arguing for them, which in return could mean that you are one.
---
So many things wrong with this statement. 
---
&gt;Teamkilling the glichter is the only way to punish them.
---
One of the ways . FTFY
---
&gt;if we can unite and team kill all glitchers, then there‚Äôs a chance we can stop them.
---
This is a bad example, but. That's like Hitler having Germany unite to exterminate all Jews. But Hitler was popular within his political party. You're a nobody. 
---
&gt;Letting them happen does nothing, it‚Äôs showing the person they can get away with it. Which in return is part of the problem.
---
Going from your previous comments, let's assume you don't have a prebuilt team. That would mean, you would be the only person teamkilling the glitcher. Which would only be for one round for best of 5 or best of 6.
---
I mean, I was ADS‚Äôd and like 7m away at most, I don‚Äôt think its too unrealistic
---
I‚Äôm a dad

Who didn't ask for glaz to be nerfed? Have you ever played a single game in plat? 
---
Glaz was not fun to play against all on maps like Oregon, or Chalet. 
---
This change doesn't stop him from being annoying on the maps he's good at, if you're good with glaz, this won't stop you from ez wins. 
---
Otherwise, tough shit.
---
That just sound like second accounts to me. Smurfs are more for playing against people at a much lower skill level. That isn‚Äôt happening if you hit Plat/Diamond on these alternate accounts. 
---
What I consider a smurf is someone at a Diamond skill level that plays on a smurf account against level 30-50s trying to still learn the game.
---

Right now it's most likely the servers.

It was mainly just a joke, but if you could, that would be fantastic.

Correct
---
Not all, Valve games can't get Ddos ed anymore . They found a solution.

Sometimes lion instead of jackal

That's half the attack meta in bomb, it's not situational when it has that many broad applications.

There was a comment saying it was too long so https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c16670/n%C3%B6kk_ace/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
 I dealt with this,I was getting  dos in a game not to long a go and it was only me. How I can tell I was the only one running into issues getting kicked and shit and it kept happening at random moments or when I would kill multiple people on the enemy team and I hated it and really wish console would get more support.
---
for half a second i thought that was Leorio from Hunter x Hunter
---
&gt;everyone
---
Everyone means all 10 people. It is statistically impossible for all 10 people to have a worse experience when you teamkill a glitcher on your team
---
Imma make a vigil one
---
Ahaha thank you
---
Oh boy
---
So first of all, her guns aren‚Äôt that bad. I too play on console, and I can run the FMG with a suppressor and still control its recoil easily. The new holo is also pretty precise. Her gadgets is best not when randomly using it, but when sneaking past certain obstacles, like a maestro cam. You just gotta learn when to use it
---
I already explained why it makes it worse your comprehension skills are lacking 
---
 
---
I‚Äôll put it simple 
---
Killing the glitcher doesn‚Äôt make it better in your team statistically 
---
You teamkill a glitcher
---
You make the game a 4v5 (already made the problem worse for your teammates) 
---
Next round teamkiller either does the glitch again or kills you 
---
If he teamkill you (4v5 for another round AND glitcher is alive to ruin it for enemy team)
---
If he does glitch again ( you cannot teamkill him again and he will use glitch on enemy team)
---
Therefor you made the problem worse for 1 or more round
---
Downvoting so it stays a secret
---
Love it how Lesion is just sticking a gu mine in Ying's arm
---
Were they playing a support character on attack like monty?
---
Hehe they will never know
---
Man I genuinely thought this was a good idea for a bit until I remembered you could just put the camera on the other side of the wall to watch the door
---
I just hate Warden
---
WhO‚Äôs AsKiNg??!1!
---
We‚Äôre the Jews doing something in life that wasn‚Äôt intended for life &lt;-Weird thing to say, otherwise that is the most ridiculous analogy I‚Äôve ever seen. 
---
Again, it‚Äôs doing something about it instead of letting it happen. The point is try and make a difference. Try to talk the person out of it, team kill them once they have done it. 
---
Anyways, you can team kill three rounds in this game currently. 
---
What is another way to something about the glitcher? People on console don‚Äôt get banned. Not that easily anyways.
---
no one bans monty even though he is twice as effective than blitz in bomb
---
N√∏kk
---
Well you just like men
---
Oh. Oh yeah. I forgot about that. Uhh
---
Epic gamer moment

Thank you for agreeing with me.

This looks like a white Lucio chibi

Agreed
---
Gone, reduced to atoms.
---
If you can use mouse and keyboard on console, why the fuck is everyone not doing it instead of whining about it?
---
your head was behind the wall, but your body could have still been exposed to the blast. This needs to be tested with another observing player before being labelled as a glitch.
---
This Mr Rodgers guy sounds interesting
---
Ok, but you did start it first. I've done shit like that before as well to my friends expecting a full on retaliation. So I don't empathize with you on that end because you shouldn't have done that in the first place.

What about 4 stacking teammates who surrender intentionally giving the poor 5th feller a loss, I‚Äôm poor feller. Literally happens to me all the time

---
This thread was a story and a half
---
You can teamkill three times in this game currently before you are kicked, fyi.
---
And if you do nothing 5 other people on the other team have the worst experience. They lose because a player is exploiting a glitch. When this happens, it makes people not want to play. So regardless of the outcome of the game, it gives hope to people that get glitched against. 
---
I think you‚Äôre the one lacking in comprehension skills.

Macie and russian badger are on opposite ends of the siege community. Badger plays exclusively casual for memes and Macie is of course known for high IQ plays against the highest rank of players.

That's one of his main role... plant denial. Also you can only play bomb on ranked from now on.

Time to loose 3 in a row howdy
---
Whoever bans cave is not a team player.
---
Electrified barbed wire destroys ash and zofia charges it comes in contact with. As for not doing a lot of damage, If they break two of them then they will be put at a range where they can be 1 shot by kaid's shotgun with a bodyshot. Chip damage can be very helpful in siege. It also denies drones as the claw cant be shot out by a twitch drone or bullets when placed properly. But even if its not optimal, I would much rather them give kaid his own playstyle that no other op can do, rather than have him be yet another op with nitro cell.
---
tbh, that will mean a good roam with so much time and utiliies wasted to track you down 3 times....
---
You know.... This wouldn't be a bad thing for some people...

I have naturally very slanted angry eyebrows &gt;:)

They aren‚Äôt being sold by ubisoft, if ubisoft doesn‚Äôt allow it then it isn‚Äôt allowed no matter who fucking sells it.

Thank you !!

Honestly, I might get downvoted for saying this but a lot of the chubis that have been coming out these past couple of seasons have been totally wrong and look wonky af and I just hate a lot of them. The og ones look a lot better.
---
The best ones are still Maestro and Kaid.

The one issue I have with coconutbrah is by the nature of needing to pump out YouTube videos, there‚Äôs a lot of filler ‚Äútips‚Äù in his videos.

I‚Äôve been taught trigger discipline and I don‚Äôt think a finger actually ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the trigger is good in a live combat situation. Either way to me it just looks like Ubisoft‚Äôs animators made a mistake
---
These are the same people who talk mad trash, sound 5 yrs old, and scream curse words for absolutely no reason other than to be toxic. I feel for you man.
---
Idk if it‚Äôs a difference of platform but I see so many people ban Blitz in ranked on X1(Gold 1 right now if that matters) and I just can‚Äôt figure out why. Never see him all that much and no one in my group uses him. Lesion though, fuck him, I vote to ban him in any round. I can deal with Cav but fuck lesion and his poison legos. When it comes to attack ban my group just flips a coin, we‚Äôve been doing thatch/twitch recently and that really fucks with some groups while not affecting us.
---
at the end of your name there's :Hibana: :Thatcher:
---
Win loss is only ranked
---
So I won‚Äôt have vanilla ops until I unlock them all? Are there versions with all vanilla ops? If ubi really wants people to get involved with the game, they need to include at least some of the game. Since when did they take a page from EA‚Äôs playbook:(
---
Ubisoft actively disabled mouse and keyboard support on console for siege. It doesn't matter if they are official and supported by the console. They are not supported by the game and the developers that's what matters any attempt to get around this by players using "official" adapters is cheating and should result in bans.
---
Of course we're gonna have the same problems, the difference is we made them go through it first, and opened up a bigger possibility of starting the opposite side with a much larger win advantage.
---
Just restart the game and it'll appear
---
I didn‚Äôt know ranked is only bomb now. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that man. And I know that‚Äôs his purpose but people find it annoying
---
Too bad finka was.dead good luck
---
Trash game because Ubisoft is ass
---
I honestly ban her just to avoid these situations. R6S is a horror game
---
on the higher ranks diffrent ops get banned like mira or someone that usefull
---
They are sold by the manufacturer of the very device you play the game one. Ubisoft is also aware of that and does nothing against it.
---
I get it: You play with a controller and hoped that will stay. But technology moves on. Crossplay becomes more important and mouse and keyboard support of any USB mouse and keyboard is a thing nowadays. And other solutions using an adapter are sold officially. No matter what you hoped would be the case, M+KB on consoles will not go away. Quite the contrary.
---
I would say it is, i dont have one but i bet its easier to aim and control the recoil, and also flicking and leaning without ads.
---
Not sure
---
Do whatever you're heart desires. Unless you play him in ranked. In which case. I will find you
---
I've been hearing this from a lot of people
---
Many tears were shed as well. :'(
---
Wtf is this video
---
I appreciate it. I really don't care about losing, in the end of the day it's just a game. I only care about losing when I lose to people that are taking the game too seriously--to the point where they decide that they need to cheat to win.
---
If you think they need to nerf Fuze, the operator isn‚Äôt the problem.
---
Amazing comment

So many commons

Does this only work if the game is running via steam?

Your teammates even tried to kick you out of the game lol
---
I'm gonna say something fucking weird. 
---
Pulse. He can be an anchor if you use his scanner like you would a Lesion's mines. The only difference is they don't do damage and the enemy isn't alerted when they've been compromised. Works surprisingly well. Only really drawback is that Pulse has shitty guns
---
Happy cake day
---
I received 12 new black ice + 5 black ice duplicates. 8 Legendaries, about 40 Epics, and the rest Rare, Uncommon and Common. The opening was brutal and not as exciting as expected sadly. Over a year of saving, only to be disappointed by RNG. :/
---
How do you think I feel
---
The Nail Gun got replaced by the Scattergun before release of the game. God you're ignorant
---
edit: if anyone gets that I'll love you forever
---
George has gotten many people kicked or banned for stream sniping or "cheating." The amount of bullshit he calls notwithstanding, I had to stop watching because I got sick of how many times somebody got lucky with a wallbang and he said "Okay chat, everybody report this guy for hacking!" I like him when I like him, but his knee-jerk toxicity is too much to be okay with.
---
Nokk is roamer in the attack. She has no good weapons, except deagle, but her ability is really strong. She is all about stealth.
---
Warden is more about defending object from plant through smoking room. He's very useful when attackers uses this strategy. But useless in other situation, except rushing Blitz.
---
Man I'm lvl150ish, with over 800 hours, and still no Black Ice.
---
Gig-in
---
Probably photoshop
---
This is why half of the plats/diamonds are even worthy of being that rank. Plus Mouse and Keyboard is a whole mother issue on com-sole
---
Upgrades that give you an unfair advantage is cheating. You might as well buy a m&amp;k if you‚Äôre gonna trick out your controller for an advantage over others.
---
I hate that you're right
---
It is THunt extract hostage for infinit ammo refill. What equipment? What do you mean by that? Finka is because SASG-12 is one of the best shotguns to destroy walls it has 10 shell mag, while M1014 has 7
---
Who?
---
F for you angry woman main
---
I got kicked because I joined a 4 stack and they all voted to kick me as soon as the game started. Wtf is this game
---
I'm silver as well but I feel like I could be gold if I wasn't stuck solo queuing. There are so many games that I get people who either throw or leave that it's very hard to win
---
Maybe if you don't feel any mechanical problems then it could be linked to your state of mind. Your focus and confidence directly affect your play. You focus on your errors and get frustrated? Then you are bound to continue and keep getting worse.
---
Be much more relaxed and focused. Try doing some breathing exercises and don't beat yourself up too harshly on your mistakes.
---
Like breaches I guess. That's very cool, interesting to see
---
Maestro‚Äôs was goofy and that‚Äôs ok. Warden‚Äôs is just bad
---
That happens to me too, but it‚Äôs an ongoing match, and as soon as I join I get kick. I love this game, but seriously wtf
---
üòîüòî

I'm disabled, I can't play with a regular controller. I'm probably still at an average level even with a SCUF. Am I still cheating?

I think we're just very bad at spelling

Well, since the normal matches are not p2p as far I know it probably means they ddos'ed the whole server.
---
I wonder how much cash your account is worth
---
Server?
---
EU
---
Nvm then
---
Ok
---
I actually enjoy the FMG-9 on Nokk. No joke every one misunderstood her role she is an Entry frag/anti roam. She should he pushing flanks and rotating not staying in prolonged engagements. I've caught teams in the back when I had just hit their front less then ten seconds before. Her speciality is maneuvering around the obj rooms and hitting different angles to take potshots and apply pressure
---
My guess it's the knive
---
Valkyrie is similar
---
The ying chibi is more white than warden chibi. The chibi looks like lucio.
---
Warden is very situational, (in my opinion) 9 times out of 10 Warden's ability probably won't be used/useful. N√∏kk, on the other hand, has an ability that is useful on every map that has a camera (that is a joke, don't give hate. I know every map has a camera) and is one of, if not the only counter-intel gadget on attack.
---
Echo is often banned in ranked
---
Rules are made up and the points dont matter
---
Thanks man
---
that asthma attack at the end though
---
?
---
I'm not gonna say the ToS doesn't matter, it does and I too am not sure why they haven't changed to accord with their view on mouse and keyboard. But it seems even if they do, it won't matter too much because people will find a way to defend it. If the majority of the player base uses bananas as controllers because they are the default and the game devs have also said that using anything but bananas is cheating because it is literally their game, then it's cheating and it is idiotic to say that using it is not an advantage over controllers. It's like if someone playing soccer decides to pick up the ball and score with their hands. They are using their hands, and everyone else is using their feet. Then defending it by saying 'It's a superior way of playing, I'm not cheating, everyone else should just adapt to this'
---
NOW, after the deagle got **tight**, I'd use shotgun on her whenever I play her as an anchor.
---
most with team but sometimes solo

Usually in the middle of the season, I'd say in 1 month

I think they event this season is the cowboys vs robbers skins that were leaked earlier. so no summer packs

yeah last season i finished off plat 1 but i‚Äôm not sure that i even want to touch the new ranked. I definitely agree that the skill level rises as your rank does, and that‚Äôs why i loved pre update ranked, but i don‚Äôt know about this new ranked. I‚Äôve seen other people saying the same thing but i think i‚Äôm part of the minority
---
Can we at least appreciate how fast the reply from ubi was ?
---
GG mate, but I noticed a lot of hesitation in your attempts to push. Why so?
---
Hahaha nice
---
No, it means the hitbox with Glaz's thermal is broken. The yellow makes the other operator bigger than what they actually are.
---
He puts holes in reinforced walls. That's a hard breacher, son.
---
That's what I call real tryharding it but you and the doc have my respect. I've killed many bandits in the same spot with Capitao but am curios to be challenged this way and see how I will burn out of it.
---
It's cause they can adapt and learn.
---
Unfortunately all this community can do is complain about good things.
---
Uhm... I'm voicing your team.

Actually it's reply from their live chat support.

I tried contacting from creating ticket they didn't respond for like 3-4 days

Cosplays have been looking good these days. Thermite from what I‚Äôve seen is still a joke though

It‚Äôs scrutiny, and I have the hours to back it up. But he is a console player so I felt bad for him after realising that. But it wasn‚Äôt meant to downplay his post. I still commend him for the ace.
---
Eat a Snickers
---
Yikes
---
I agree, It's a very healthy operator to play, not relay on ACOGs, actually need to push and not just hold angels as an attacker, take risks and find alternative routes to the objective.
---
How hard is it to replicate the glitch? If it requires people to do something extremely specific, can't they just ban anyone who uses it?
---
You're just ass at attacking. It's okay man. Just get better.
---
hmmm, well, how come you didn‚Äôt make this post before the change? sounds like you‚Äôre salty about not being able to play glaz lmao

This is why I like Monty. No one expects you whip out the strap

Get better, either adapt or quit. It‚Äôs that simple. It‚Äôs not the other team‚Äôs fault u suck at attacking and defending.
---
I forgot they changed the plat color and I straight up was like "how is this man Diamond 3?"
---
1:03, this wall in the kitchen is destructible too.
---
GJ anyway
---
I did make this post before the change. My point was if the devs were working on Glaz again you'd think they'd realize his gun was broken. Apparently they didn't.
---
Not sure why this is hard for you to understand.
---
His utility for breaching is breach charges/ flash bangs/ smoke grenades. He can also blow up walls with drag grenades.  Also keep in mind ‚Äúprimary gadgets‚Äù while do have a part in the game secondary gadgets are also a part of the game.with reinforcements you have to spend most of the prep phase putting Dow your gadgets anyway. Having no attachments is a price you have to pay for having most guns in the game at your disposal. And while attachments are good it doesn‚Äôt stop a gun from being good without. And dude chill out
---
Average copper filming technique
---
because he‚Äôs not broken? you honestly sound like some whiny kid who doesn‚Äôt know how to use an operator, just leave it here and that‚Äôs it, simple

I think this because we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen in Pro League next and it‚Äôll be good if the upcoming pros are able to play on more than six or so maps because that means you could see teams picking the maps they‚Äôre from (eg. I‚Äôm Australian and as such if I joined a PL team I‚Äôd want to play on Outback) plus a lot of people may come from casual and it‚Äôs better if they have more time to integrate themselves into tryhard mode. A possible solution I just thought of is maybe Platinum and diamond players play in PL conditions while we bots and not as good players (gold and down) play in a more lax version of ranked.
---
But you can though.

Noo

what are you on about they said it in the patch notes upside down rappelling is a problem in some situations and it was fixed, this shows it clearly it wasnt

And IQ is a Pulse hunter, you can see pulse through walls and kill him, you see him when hes using his scanner. IQ is great operator

As a Valk main, I can happily say that she does need a buff. However, she has one of the most useful defender gadgets imo. Not only are the Valk cams far easier to hide and deploy than both Yokais and Maestro cams, they‚Äôre easier to come up with unexpected spots. 
---
Example: I played some of my first games of the new season last night on Kafe, Oregon and Bank. After these three games, I also played one game of ranked. I finished last season in Gold 3 but had gotten up to Gold 1, although this is irrelevant. 
---
On my casual Kafe game, all I did was think about one side which has solid angles that people attack from and I threw out my cam. Kept tagging people all round and no one found it. Same went with kitchen. I threw a cam above the broken walls where the bar and kitchen share a wall. No one found it. I did the same things on Oregon and Bank. Find a common Valk cam spot but throw the cam somewhere far enough that it‚Äôll leave attackers looking for it but not far enough that you lose the line of sight/room that it watches. Yes, Valk cams are primarily for intel but you‚Äôre also forgetting that unless the attackers destroy it, they‚Äôre screwed if it‚Äôs holding a popular location to push from. The way I think of it, Valk cams are also time wasting tools. If it‚Äôs the last 30 seconds, just keep pinging the enemy. They have to make a decision: look for the cam and destroy it or push the enemy although they know exactly where I am? It‚Äôs a win/win either way for the defenders.
---
In my ranked game, I went 8-0. My fourth game after not touching the game for a couple weeks since I‚Äôve been grinding Destiny. I played Valk on defence and Jackal/Maverick on attack. We 4-0‚Äôd our game. Why? Intel. Intel wins games. If you know where the opponents are before you, you should win the gunfight. You can‚Äôt blame your weapon. You knew where they were. You should‚Äôve placed your reticle at head level and instakilled them. 
---
Example: Ranked match on Kafe, I placed a Valk cam on the white building next to Kafe. It was outside the window on the new platform above main stairs. N√∏kk pushes through the window but I‚Äôd already set my gun at head level. She peeked and died. Yes, we have all died because her gun is weak as fuck, agreed. In a one on one gunfight with either player not knowing the enemies location, us Valk players will die 75% of the time. 
---
However, we shouldn‚Äôt let the weaknesses of her weapon get us down. If they don‚Äôt buff her damage, they should buff her rof slightly. However, we also need to look at the pros: her gun is one of the worst defender guns but not the worst. Her weapon has very low recoil so controlling it is simple. The range isn‚Äôt too bad either. 
---
Apologies for such a long response but I think Valk is fine as she is. However, giving her a small buff by either increasing damage by 4 or rof by 60 wouldn‚Äôt hurt either.
---
eSports ready
---
Actually played a game today where I convinced my team to ban J√§ger... not for his gun to prevent ADS‚Äôs we then proceeded to grenade the absolute fuck out of the enemy team cus they banned warden as well.

i wasn't aware that you could shoot from your forehead in this game

Nicely executed

That gun dosnt have one ya bish

Gordon Ramsay style
---
A really long time ago. Year 1/2. Before any Ui Change
---
Did you get some Ops when to stared playing the game?
---
well, I haven't messed with any settings in about 2 weeks. but I will try playing more relaxed
---
but think about it, if you lose 3times in a row it would be match point. sure its your turn to defend but theres that constant pressure that if you cant win 3times in a row..you lose. So it fucks with your state of mind and you can't play up to standard because of this fact like pressuring you and breathing down on your neck that you can't afford to lose just 1 round
---
Seems like a user created issue
---
well I can
---
This is surprisingly accurate
---
nice one

Thank you for bringing this into existence!

TBF the same thing occurs on other maps. The only reason Outback was noticed was because the outlets are more apparent to Australians.

On this topic, I remember her Candela differently. I haven't played her in a long time, but the way I remembered it was that 1 light went off as soon as it hit the ground while 3 lights was the long fuse. When I played her yesterday, it was opposite. Did I miss that in an update, or do I just have bad memory?
---
I wouldn't call you an asshole. It's what you're meant to do.
---
Your flair is concerning
---
That‚Äôs why you activate your gadget just before you step in. Then shoot the cam or look for the blue light that tells you if the defenders are using the cam. If they‚Äôre using it, keep your gadget activated and if they‚Äôre not using it, deactivate your gadget or decide whether you can make it to the end while it‚Äôs still in use.
---
I have regard for civilian life.
---
Yes you missed an update. They changed it so that it handles similar to regular grenades now, so cocking it will shorten the time it takes to detonate instead of increasing it.
---
Look. How was the dep. Shields good in earlier versions and now broken? I srsly don't know.
---
Could someone explain?
---
Yep, was using a macro for WoW, forgot to disable before launching R6S, Nek minute, $200aud down the dunny. Not counting new copy and micro transactions on that account.
---
Good boi
---
You didn‚Äôt get banned for that
---
That also occured to me a couple of times, in a few days you should get your charm
---
Okay.
---
Doesn't prove anything
---
Nope bought the game three times 2 times for myself 1 for Xbox 1 for PlayStation and for a friend people that troll noobs are fags
---
Yeah, I built a Ryzen 2600 build for around $800. Case and all. It was 100% worth it. Two of my diamond friends went from Xbox to PC at the same time, because of MnK. We play late, usually 11PM-3AM EST, but if you're on at that time, we'd play with ya.
---
Did you try to permanently remove the starter from your account via steam support?

I tried but i could only find Phone cases.

That‚Äôs the same as selling your account, you can already do that by giving the other guy your username and password

Hey, possibly the voice server location switched, but at first i'd look up if your campus Internet blocks certain services. If you are unsure how, just ask your Campus IT department if anything is blocked.
---
If that doesn't return anything useful, try contacting support.ubi.com, they should be able to help you troubleshoot.
---
Its from the bug that didnt give you packs when you landed on them so your getting them now
---
That's what he said...

Same obviously they knew our schools were full of idiots

Because pro league doesn't ban him alot, and most ranked players act like they are pro leauge

When Maverick get a headshot through a hole he just made

And the face is horrifying

Maybe same scope as the .44 magnum

Sometimes combatting isn't cutting it, and you need a second job

Already reported to ubi for abuse...

I used background eraser, Pixomatic, and Picsart.
---
As someone who plays Jackal a lot and rarely sees other people play Jackal...I'm so confused by the sudden hate at him. His gadget is fine, but nothing amazing. Honestly its just his guns are awesome. And a shotty secondary? Heck yeah. His gadget is mainly good for making people panic. If you're on site it doesn't really do anything.
---
N√∏kk has definetely surpassed Caveria
---
They don't have that in Russia. Doesn't have poutine name in it
---
I think that would be too overpowered if it got a scope like the .44 magnum. I was think like the sight Clash uses for her secondaries.
---
!thesaurizethis

Oh that's pretty blatant mouse yeah. If I was spectating him then I'd be able to tell. I guess I'd only notice people I'm spectating and I tend to be in a 5 stack.
---
The blitz moved aside while you were getting shot
---
Had the same bug. Restart the game and it should show up.
---
You‚Äôre crazy
---
The blitz moved, wrong place wrong time

This is why n√∏kk and cav should be banned

Killing people irl

Hasn't happened to me yet! Must just be unlucky this time around lol. Thanks for the reply :)

Macros against WoW tos? It has a built in macro maker
---
You're right about text chat, definitely worse than the teabag or the occasionnal salty inbox on console. Being able to communicate instantly with the enemy team, it can be a wide open door to toxicity imo.
---
I‚Äôm 88 days late but they are now editable!
---
Spanish. Depends if you want attack or defense
---
Better recoil, higher damage, higher fire rate, better hipfire accuracy and quicker reload time.
---
If you play more ranked Mira because jackal gets banned a lot but jackal is better in my opinion
---
Deluxe or Ultimate are soooo worth it at that price no matter what your R6 skill is.
---
Great YouTubers to watch are Get_Flanked and VarsityGaming (Siege School is quite good) to help round the edges early on.
---
My friend is a Blitz main and I am an Echo main. We play them as much as we can, but it rarely happens. I just hate that the bans are "annoying" operators. Just get gud and play IQ or call out where Blitz is to take him out with a teammate, or run away. Watch your flanks and Cav is useless. When you get tracked by Jackal, you waste a lot of the attacker's time. That's why he has THE LOWEST WIN RATE OF ALL THE ATTACKERS. And he still gets banned! Smh
---
It has a slow reload time and has very small mag size

Um.. jackal and mira are Spanish
---
Spanish** and depends on which play style you prefer, as jackal is more of an intel-providing and support attacker while Mira is meant for recon and playing aggressively on the defensive side, so up to you.
---
Probably gold3-2
---
No it has a quicker reload time nd if youre good at the game the mag size isnt a problem
---
Depends on what rank you were last season as well
---
oh yea
---
Yes I know. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to title.
---
Get better at attacking
---
They are Spanish operators not Italian btw :)
---
As for who to choose. They are both excellent ops but it really depends on your playstyle. Jackal has excellent guns and has a lot of soft breach utility and he is a perfect op to hunt down roamers and to clear areas out. 
---
Mira has a cool gun fast firerate but if on console be ready for recoil pc you can ignore that lol. You also have to remember with Mira you are usually a good op to deny plant and to relay information. 
---
It's tough to say because they both do different things. You need to go based on who you would have fun playing with and who is your playstyle more like.
---
i got gold 4 (was gold 1 last season)
---
Those were available during the Outbreak event last year, not available anymore.
---
Well... yeah...
---
I was planning on buying it, but then by the time I realized it I already had enough renown to buy all but 3 of the ops, i just have clash to go now
---
How long did this took
---
I did not say it was balanced. But you could at least attack and defend it. The new one is heavily defender sided.
---
I heard battle eye on ps4 is a joke...

Just buy it 4head

It doesn‚Äôt work like that

Dpi?

This is true

I cba buying to be honest as I used to have it on PS4 but moved console
---
Yeah you definitely can you just have to be extremely efficient about it I have done it before
---
Be polite
---
What u mean
---
Unless you‚Äôre a weeb

It makes the game more balanced and rewards strategies and good team play.

you can buy the ultimate edition that comes with all season passes

I briefly mentioned it in my last post. It was brief because I don't know much more about it. But cheats exist on PS4 and those same cheats mask whatever data they're editing. Making both the PS4 and whatever anti cheat Sony uses think it is only using the correct code. That article you linked is a poorly written excuse for why whatever "HackerBot" is doesn't have the cheats.

I'm not gonna go find it for you, if that's what you're asking.

I saw a clip of someone doing this on coastline a while back, and as I started practicing my aim on custom games, I realised that you could vault and walk onto the fence thing. So I decided to give it a shot.
---
Could someone explain the 6th pick concept to me? I don‚Äôt do casual at all?
---
That's why ranked in this game is so much of a farce.
---
Just intentionally lost all my placement matches and let me tell you getting outsmurfed is a punishment sent straight from hell.
---
The MnK issue is exaggerated. People who die to somebody with insane aim will instantly just jump to that assumption. Some people are just talented with a controller. I almost get accused on a daily basis to the point where I have to get said players social media just to prove I play with controller.
---
I don‚Äôt get it someone help?

Just like me!

There are more pictures on my Twitter if you want to see them twitter.com/agentcivi and more are coming soon when more gear I've just ordered come :)

Ubisoft want to emphasise the fact that he's an anchor
---
I got hacked recently. They changed my username, password, email, everything. I contacted support and got my account back within 20 minutes.
---
My account was recently hacked, they couldn't do anything besides chaning my password to my game and to my email. I own the game on Steam and it automatically logs you into your Ubi account when you start the game there so I had proof the account was mine.
---
Contacted support, took about 30 minutes to regain full access.
---
I had conacted them before as well. 
---
I had a bug where I couldn't change my ingame name and the whole thing took 10-15 minutes.
---
Oh yeah its definitely underrated. The gear one or whatever it is is for sure the worst
---
In the game? No but we got lesion and ying from an Asian country and we also got Hibana and echo from japan
---
I think he meant he canceled the queue.
---
Right....that makes sense
---
Who cares? I am aware that people do not want to listen to the truth. And nothing more is what I am saying.
---
I Stil don't get for what the 3rd thing is we in Germany only have two
---
NOOOOIII NEVER
---
You make good points but I would say the fear factor of his gadget can still potentially help quite a bit, I got an ace yesterday because the enemy team couldn‚Äôt use their utility to get an advantage on me and they couldn‚Äôt smoke plant, However even this advantage has issues. If warden dies midway through a round and the attackers still have more players left alive the utility they saved can kinda have a snowballing effect that makes things hell for the defenders.
---
Im a fan of favela and bartlett and kinda pissed that barlett isnt in casual.
---
Because bartlett sucks thays why its not in the game. I will say they should remake it though.
---
Irl
---
Define... *a few*
---
Yeah it's just his utility is very rarely useful. Plus, with the Glaz nerf if any Glaz player pops a smoke, that Glaz is already going to have put himself in a good position, and if Warden comes out to try to contest the Glaz, it's over.
---
Why is there a map pool just throw them all in. New players aren't coming let's keep all the maps.
---
Hit Diamond on an account for the first time in Y2S2 and my account got hacked a few months after. Submitted a support ticket and gave all the info asked. Support pretty much was useless and I ended up losing the account. Was so frustrating as I grinded out ops and spent so much time just trying to get to Diamond on it.
---
Actually, Common:95% Uncommon:2% Calico Jack: 2% Rare/Epic/Legendary: 1% with a 99% chance of duplicate
---
Its really bad right now. I‚Äôd say 1/3 of the games I play in get dossed. One was super creative last night and only dossed us when we were on attack so we went down 3-0. Then when their attack began magically everyone could move again. We went on to win all three of our defenses and then the server crashed. This shit is wild rn
---
Who cares if they agree? I don't even bring my own opinion into this. I am simply telling people what is. They don't want to hear it. They don't want to hear that Sony sells mouse and keyboards officially. They don't want to hear that M+KB is not forbidden by Ubisofts ToS. But that is the reality of things. That's why they get upset. They only want their witch hunt to continue. Being told that they are right. But the point here simply is: They are not.

I really does suck, but it gets so much better once you get past that. Try to find someone willing to play with you and help you learn. My friend complains that she feels stupid half the time cause she has no idea what's going on, but watching and helping her improve and learn is easily the most fun I'm having in it. Friends can make anything bearable lol
---
No it's from in the game
---
I mean she's basically Caveira but cooler so I 100% expect her to be ridiculously popular
---
Hi
---
Nobody is modifing software here. You are trying to bend the rule so it fits what you want because you cannot accept that it simply is not forbidden. Because if you wanted to forbid M+KB in the game what would you write? Would you go such an extreme roundabout way of forbidding software... or just say "Use of M+KB on console is forbidden"?
---
I was also thinking that it'd be perfect for "Lion sleeps tonight" meme too
---
Lmao
---
Not entirely. You aren't entirely wrong, but what it allows players to do is ban ops that they find annoying or frustrating, or that they know is broken.
---
Like, an IQ main banning lesion is purely from frustration,  since she can clearly counter him but also finds it frustrating, and it is a useful ban nonetheless.
---
Yes
---
I disagree I find it fun but also When I have a full squad we‚Äôre good players pick and ban can effect how we play
---
So true
---
not true.

---
25 shots of pellets that are specifically made to open walls...
---
That is no evidence, that is just Ubisofts social media team saying what the community wants to hear to appease them. As long as it is not written in the ToS, it is worthless. They cannot ban you on the base of social media posts. Only on the base of what is written in the ToS and the code of conduct.
---
Fuck jackal
---
Thst looks very uncomfortable.
---
That‚Äôs helpful
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what i said it‚Äôs only good for full squads. The vast majority of the player base doesn‚Äôt have a full squad
---
No, I was proving a point. You have to revamp the os. Unless you can show me otherwise, I have no reason to believe you. I also am disgusted by cheaters, and have no desire to cheat
---
DDoS means Directed Denial of Service. There are different types but the most common one is where you overload a server with requests using bots so that it shuts down or grinds to a halt trying to resolve thousands of requests. 
---
The problem with DDoS is you can‚Äôt really protect yourself since it most likely targets corporate servers rather than the individual user, denying service. From a server level they are very difficult to protect against as well. You can try using targeted firewalls and other authenticators but it‚Äôs usually not enough. At that point you just need dedicated IT who can respond to an attack immediately and begin mitigating the attack and restoring service.
---
I've never found it to be too hard to figure out what trap.  Definitely annoying with they are rushing and you don't know what point the downed guy is, but with only three it's not too hard to tell.  
---
Not saying I wouldn't like a marker, but I don't find it to be too bad without one.

after teammates die for failing a spawnpeek
---
Imma tell you this real quick chief. That b some hackaroonies
---
Jesus. I'm so glad I get to at least play.
---
Username checks out
---
It could be better but also lead to being killed instantly and no way to get out of the traps. With lesions it does not down you and personally I feel this may actually be a bit too op because you could just get shot through walls and floors. How it is now you get one bulletproof camera to show you if one of your traps has gone off. Also if they did this people would want the same thing for kapkan traps.
---
No I‚Äôd carry my team and leave right before we won or stay till we lost.
---
Welcome to life

is ubisoft even aware of this? same here tho
---
Give it to n√∏kk

I understand what you're saying, but when, for example, you spread them out on the map, it would be nice to know which one was activated . Especially when you are first getting into the game.

Next season IIRC.

boring - it gets boring when you have to attack the same site 3 times in a row then win once on defense. it takes away some of the varied gameplay of siege.
---
unfair - most maps are defender sided, i find that the team that starts on defense has a mental advantage since you are more likely to 3-0 on defense than in previous systems.
---
Why would anyone bother hacking in casual

Did that to a downed mate but pulled out my real pistol and killed him lmao totally a n accident

Yes, you play against another team don‚Äôt you. 5 v 5. Two teams, therefore 50% chance you get one the attacking team
---
Without a doubt, phantom sight as been the most bug ridden, toxic, unplayable season I‚Äôve ever been apart of. Really sad to see the game in this state.
---
Oh yeah, I know that feeling. The feeling of a rising heartrate, a dropping life expectancy and a falling controller.

[Pretty much this.](https://youtu.be/BvO_hyt3aXI)

And casual. I stopped playing it altogether because backfill is so bad.

Hello rozlack, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1c6rp/russia_day_charm_bugged/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
the hotkeys do nothing ingame, so probably not.
---
If you think that the software in the adapters that's used to mask your input isn't considered as hacking and using of a third party software then I'll say it again you don't know what you're talking about .
---
In summary , WHY do I need a software to MASK my input to TRICK the SET SYSTEM into thinking the input is coming from a controller , WHY can't some unofficial MnK support come in action ??
---
Because in the console little buddy are things that fight these things presented from Sony to developers within the development kits when they're sent to developers and it's up to the owners of the games to decide the rest .
---
But now for some reason Sony licenced hori out of nowhere , but you're still missing a very very important point , Sony has a policy , Sony is a different company so is Ubisoft , and Ubisoft is who legally made rainbow six siege .
---
Done, there , if you can't understand the legality in this then I don't need to confirm that you're straight up stupid and for real I'm done for good with you
---
I'm screaming the same answers for multiple times already and you can't seem to fucking get it , If can't do anything to get you to understand I'll just leave you be to your fantasy thoughts neither do I care to convince someone like you and especially you personally to understand that it's wrong .
---
At the end of the day , it's considered cheating , forbidden by the devs and is punishable , so stop wiggling your dick around for some bullshit excuse to pull out .

In the news tab when you go to open the game

no he needed to push the thing forward (don‚Äôt know gun terms)

---
Personally I‚Äôd get Mira but you need to learn how to play her before ranked
---
You will probably make fun of me but that wasnt ranked, that was soke casual idiots.
---
Yeah... he isn't banned for the same reasons, but maybe he counters a lot of strats. I just don't have a hard time playing against Echo.
---
But it has much more utility

I personally would rather ban Blackbeard then blitz but yah
---
They can bombard the game server and shut it down but they can also do a softer attack that effectively stalls the game while it's happening. Usually they'll do it when you're defending during the drone phase so you can't reinforce and then again during the entire attack phase so you can't plant the defuser. Sometimes it will kick a few people who's connection to the game server gets bad enough. Those people will get an abandon sanction if they don't rejoin.
---
Also, if someone gets another persons IP (usually though party chat), they can boot individual people. That's why you never join a random party.
---
To be honest they need to fix games where people tk, because this season i have been tk‚Äôd more often then Usual. I mean somehow more the operation chimera. And another thing, you can do nothing and get kicked cause you are pared up with a four stack...i feel like you can only be able to kick a person if they had tk‚Äôd or done something kick worthy

Ya we started banning him on consulate etc
---
Yea I feel pretty bullied whenever they nerf a operator. Hurt the most when they took away Ela's impacts.
---
For real though, I played Uncharted 4 before I played 1-3 so the part with those creatures was unexpexted as hell. I had forgotten about it though, thanks for reminding me of the horror. Might play through them again!

#Have you purchased Siege more than once?

so is it worse than csgo? because I remember that game had a huge smurf problem, probably worse now that it's free to play

I‚Äôve seen this title more times then I‚Äôd like to say

Yep. Because I wanted to get it on PS4 for the better graphics when I was running it on a potato PC
---
If you abandon any match no matter then outcome it will count as a loss for you.
---
Does this mean they‚Äôll use Mozzie and Grid?
---
Had it happen to me on a 3-0 us winning first game of ranked this season.
---
oh okay
---
They certainly have the option to pick them.
---
The 417?
---
That's one of the few guns I'm actual positive with, dmrs are god
---
he counters too many strats. he is too strong a fail safe

That's not really the main problem. People are ddosing the game servers themselves.

Because of spawn peaking you have to now always check before you even start to head regards the obj

They barely ever ban, even if you use macros to your advantage

When will they actually fix those shields?

BattleEye please go easy on me

The studio can't even fix a shield glitch. I don't know how are they going to handle 100 operators and multiple maps

As in the two coppers are smurfs, they go low ranks while one of them (the plat) goes a high rank, so the team average mmr is lower, so they face lower ranks than they are. This allows the plat to get higher ranks such as diamond very easily

Yes but getting 7 attacks in a row isn't very likely.

What do you honestly think the risk is? Ubisoft has hardly even acknowledged that it's an issue. Who's going to prosecute these script kiddies?
---
Extremely silly.
---
This got posted last week and was one of the top posts on the sub
---
Echo is more disruptive, because the Yokai's blast can make Monty drop his shield, as well as any action that requires you to hold the button for a few seconds, such as planting. Throw in the invisibility and the fact that now everyone can at least use the drones for callouts instead of just him, and you get a very annoying Defender to go against that fits a lot of setups. He's harder to counter normally due to either needing to be actively looking for his Yokai's, or needing a Thatcher with an idea of where the drone is, or just an IQ.
---
Maestro's able to help counter smoke pushes and be disruptive of the plant with his Evil Eyes, but not to the same extent as Echo. The Eye doesn't *stop* the plant, just injures the planter, which means they can potentially get it off. You typically know where the Eye is, and as long as you have someone watching it at the very least, you can pop it if it tries anything.
---
i actually think they should make operation health 2. This time just don't make 100 new glitches and bugs
---
If you shot him it would help.
---
That‚Äôs partly why it would be such a good buff.
---
What?
---
Meh. That‚Äôs not a satisfying answer :/
---
 I agree
---
That is a rather petty reason to kick someone, especially in casual. I use my mic when needed, assuming the team isn‚Äôt acting like children, but not everyone wants to get on a mic to talk to strangers.
---
I was expecting something to not reveal teammates like people been suggesting with N√∏kk. Idk about a free kill just cause you got downed and being questioned.
---
should implement it on PIP (Picture-in-picture) so you‚Äôd actually have to look on a small screen on your screen, not something like ADS.
---
This is not a bad idea I would play them
---
*Back to the Future theme starts playing*
---
In my experience CSGO was the quickest way to get good at aiming with keyboard and mouse. No perma-death with certain modes so you can get back into the action with minimal delays and get a larger amount of practice in. The quick pace and large skilled player base also helps. Just my 2 cents.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you expect
---
‚ÄúAmong Zofia‚Äôs most notable exploits was a rescue operation in Guatemala, codenamed Red Agatha. A disastrous tropical storm formed a sinkhole in the middle of the city, swallowing an entire neighbourhood. Zofia was deployed to protect a team of engineers examining the perimeter.
---
During a sudden landfall, she hitched a child over her back and ran as the ground disappeared from under her feet.
---
The kid clung to her back and she gripped the edge with her bare hands for the next half hour as she hung over the abyss. To reward her special ability to withstand hardships, Zofia received a medal and was promoted to Second Lieutenant.‚Äù
---
Then how about you use yours and explain what you mean?  Because your shitty post makes it sound like someone telling their teammate to plant is a bad thing
---
Just mute them. Don‚Äôt make a post bitching about it
---
They don‚Äôt do anything to the game so I don‚Äôt think the game can detect it

I would main the fuck outta him

when you crouch peek you aim it at chest level so if someone is standing or crouching its a flick to the head

Yeah I have a bad habit of not doing that

Hmm, those are some good points. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs because of my level on PC or people not wanting to play with strangers.

This is an awesome concept 10/10

Will the game still run the same
---
And iam not using new weapons because its confirmed that there will be no more new weapons in the game :(
---
Might experience ping issues too. I do not recommend, all that will work well is thunt solo
---
People like you that complain about things that aren‚Äôt a problem are why this community is so bad. Actually play against a lion or ask a pros opinion on lion before making a Whack statement like that.
---
Mate looks like you got walls on.
---
Can‚Äôt I just be wrong without drugs
---
I have had this game since closed alpha and the collectors edition. They will never cater to solo players. It's a shame but it's true. They will only cater to the pro league players. Some of us dont want to play with other people, just solo queue. Its ignorant to think that every single person playing this game has 3 to 5 people to play with on a consistent basis.
---
Will there be any difference between uplay and steam
---
That sucks
---
&gt;headphone color is wrong
---
That's his alt skin headphone color.  When you give him a yellow tie he gets yellow earmuffs too.  They combined both his skins.
---
&gt;lack of mustache
---
You can see it right there on his lip...
---
&gt;hairline is wrong
---
It's reversed but if you look at it his hair does part like that.  You can even kinda see it in his profile pic
---
&gt;glasses color is wrong
---
They're brown because of the light.  If you look at the arms on his frames they're black.  The same lighting makes his earmuff arms look brown even though they're black.
---
None
---
Rook and Ash are great choices. Check out [our New Players Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/guide) for some useful tips.

I have, hes still op as balls and still as frustrating to play against.

Yeah, but how would he know when to peak and flick like that? Seems really fishy.

‚ÄúDOC, you‚Äôre telling me, you built a super fun game, out of a dangerous training simulator?‚Äù

youre early in the season i assume. when you play more games itll be 50 elo gain to 60 elo loss, and itll keep lowering. 4v5s are common if you dont have a 5 stack.
---
I think they have something like that with League of Legends, but with quitting in a middle of a match.
---
You absolutely can. I have a habit of being too dramatic with my comments for the sake of amusing myself. Apologies, friend
---
It once had the worst one tho.
---
Wait was he bullet proof there?

Same, except I transferred from Xbox to PC. Newcomer is unbearable due to all the smurfs. Me and friends just hopped straight into casual.

If I have bomb down good look retaking when I can deny your movement or know where you are on demand.

Fucks sake its like you didn't even read the damn post.

Ballsy if you to hold an angle at an open window with 5 bullets in a mag
---
It‚Äôs one second of intel that‚Äôs it like getting spotted by a drone twice

No

A second that can easily get you killed.
---
You can‚Äôt play him in ranked because Ubisoft didn‚Äôt want people to meme in ranked and play stupidly. Only idiot here is you.
---
Lol
---
I'd say make it apply to windows so we have an Ashe counter.
---
Use whoever you do good with and who you have fun using. I, personally like to use Twitch and J√§ger, and I‚Äôm a level 120~ Plat 2 player. I think both these operators, even at your level could be fun and good to use. 
---
Hopes this helps!
---
&gt; Echo is extremely simple to counter
---
Yes that is why he is a near auto-ban for the best players in the world
---
Well when you're bad you gotta ban Echo because he prevents you from doing a monty rush, your team typically isn't stacked enough to avoid having one idiot off on his own getting murdered by cav, no one's good enough to shoot blitz in his knees or his big hulk arm, and it's fifty fifty on which tracker they ban, Jackal or Lion :P
---
Sledge, thatcher, jackal, doc, rook, mute, kapkan. Get good as these ops then move to high recoil ops like twitch, buck, Blackbeard, and bandit. Once you learn the basics from the first set of ops move up to high recoil so you get really good with recoil. Now that you have map knowledge and good recoil control you can essentially play anyone you want
---
breathtaking!
---
If you could specify the areas you struggle in, I‚Äôd be happy to give some advice!
---
‚ÄûYes, Marty, I actually did it. But be informed, it‚Äòs quite unfinished yet...‚Äú
---
So if I come to Aus as an American, how am I supposed to like charge my phone or whatever?
---
Learn the maps like the back of your hand
---
I am not using steam, i'm on uplay
---
Welcome! 
---
Just some basics!
---
-Always put your armor down with rook as soon as the round starts. It gives time for your teammates to setup the site efficiently. 
---
-With ash, a good tip would be to use her breaching rounds not only on walls but on floors with barbed wire on them. The barbed wire usually contain Lesion mines or other kinds of traps to the explosion from the rounds will likely take them out. 
---
-The game revolves heavily around leaning, get comfortable with it and it will boost your place in the learning curve quickly. 
---
-Use your drones! If you are unsure about a room, drone it out! If you don‚Äôt have one, well take it slow and watch your corners!
---
-The last thing main thing is map knowledge. Such an important part of the game because you need to learn angles of attack and places people can kill you from. You‚Äôll learn it over time and it will be frustrating at first. A good tip would be to watch Siege Youtubers or Streamers to get a good idea of what to do. My personal favorites are MacieJay, Matimio, Pengu, Kixstar, Intero. There are many other fantastic players in the community but those are just a few to name. Go watch them as they are pretty neat to watch and learn new things from! 
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah ur a cunt and no one wants u on tHieR team so have fun in copper 11

Reasons like this are why I hate Solo Q‚Äôing. Great ace I don‚Äôt want to take anything away from you but with a squad of at least 3 that doesn‚Äôt happen
---
Not toggling hacks got you down?

"Felt cute. Might annoy the entire Defending team later."
---

---
Maestro is pretty good currently. And if his shots cancelled plant animation it would be op as shit.
---
Imma stick to my boy lesion and thatcher
---
i find it more interesting. it's an opinion, it can't be wrong.
---
theyre not making a new siege, and if anything, they‚Äôll probably do a full overhaul and make rainbow a live service only type of game to improve the quality
---
I dont know who did that but moving the Ammunition count to 0 is the stupidest thing I have seen in the history of this game. 
---
Just disable the fucking item. You dont want to tell me that it took you over half a year to develop a way to disable certain ops/gadgets and its setammo=0
---
In my opinion you‚Äôre wrong.

Cuz when I started there was no newcomers playlist so you had to make up your own to enjoy the game, best of luck to you.. it does get better!!

Level 15 lol stay away from ranked till level 70 coming from a level 197

True, like I said they do have their uses, but they are fundamentally a niche gadget. They aren't like impacts or barbed wire, who are useful basically wherever and whenever. They're use needs to be forced in some way, some synergy or specific goal needs to be accomplished, rather than just being good. 
---
They aren't as meta warping as losing barbed wire or calymores.

The only problem I can think of is that it would make reinforcing hatches not as much of a priority. Instead of running upstairs you just use your normal reinforcements around or outside site and just set the webs underneath the hatches since being able to see through hatches isn‚Äôt that big of a deal. And being able to tell if someone is breaching an open hatch would be easy so you could C4 them. 
---
Would the game also be capable of letting you place a thermite charge on the web without you falling into the hatch? The distance between the top and bottom of the hatch looks kinda thick. While the distance wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal for Maverick, it would leave Thermite incredibly vulnerable that it probably wouldn‚Äôt be worth it if he couldn‚Äôt do it without falling in. We‚Äôre also talking about the first operator capable of somewhat reinforcing roof hatches without you having to run a sprint outside. That would make a Hibana ban on a map like Club House even more painful. 
---
I think a fair trade would be that any explosive gadget not capable hard breaching (this includes defense gadgets) should take two to destroy the webs. So two breaching charges or two grenades for example. That‚Äôs a huge waste of utility, and possibly time, for attack. 
---
Would this also be defense‚Äôs solution to plugging the holes that attack makes so that you can cut off those entryways? That could be an interesting use for it. I do really like this gadget idea though. I‚Äôm normally not a fan of concept operator posts.
---
Flash hider is better on some guns
---
You dont need to go through the whole loadout during op selection. At most you probably need to change your scope or barrel and theres more than enough time to do that. 
---
If by loading screens you mean the transistion time when you select an attachment during the op selection phase, you can click and select them even if the icons havent appeared yet.
---
And like one other person said in this thread, I cant imagine a situation when I'm not playing the game and thinking "Hey, I need to change my compensator for a flash hider on Thermite"
---
Also skins dont affect your game play, so I dont see it as a problem if you play with a skin you dont like for one game.
---
Once was too much
---
Old Hereford, Favela, and Yacht are definitely my favorites...

Least favorites have to be new Hereford (im still salty), Tower (whole map doesn't feel right) and Theme Park (I'm colorblind. It sucks.)

Well, that is something every player needs to learn along the way. Once or twice you destroy a friendly drone should be enough for a player to understand that a huge higlighted overlay around a drone implies that it is friendly

I mean, Fuze is a *pretty* hard barrier to beat in terms of 'objectively terrible', but Blitz is definitely close.

"stealthy entrance", my ass! you detonated an explosive right next to them!
---
But were comparing Rocket League (known for its toxcity anyway) and Overwatch and Siege.
---
Ive literally just pointed out that its a system present in Overwatch and has worked for numerous years.
---
Saying about going into a game with a certain mindset isnt an excuse in my opinion as its exactly the same in Siege. If you go into a game and your against a group of people who are blatantly 5 stacking, mentally your already going to thinking that tactics wise, they are going to be superior than your un stacked team, literally just a fact.
---
Someone i used to play with used to make a habit of checking the stats of the opposite team on Rainbow Six Tracker to see there Rank and previous seasons ranks and if they were ranked higher than her she would instantly be in a negative vibe because the assumption would be they were better in every situation, the same principle applies. 
---
Negativity is a killer in this game. Ever been in a game on Siege were its like 2-1 or 3-1 down and someone initiates the Surrender? Same principle again.
---
I suggest using many "looking for team" channels that you can find on various discord servers like ESL and CCS rather than posting on this subreddit. Or start a team with friends or group of people you often play with
---
I main ela as well. I really don't agree with this. 
---
First off scorpion, the recoil is random only horizontally though. It's fine vertically but when horizontal is random in a game that calls itself competitive that's a bunch of shit. Two the fall off range is very low at only 18m to where the damage drops to 15. Not to also say that her maximum damage is only 23 which is very very pitiful.
---
Her shotgun is pretty good but mid and long range fights are just stupid to engage at.
---
Her pistol is under average. It's actually the lowest damaging in game to be fact. Its fall of range is also very piss poor as well as her scorpion. Just because it has a sight doesn't mean it's any better than the others since it's really just a niche.
---
Her secondary gadgets are useless, for her especially since she's a roamer after all. And barbed and a shield really don't help her in much of any way. They're more useful for objective so in any case the only way Ela is going to do anything with them is if you have a good Frost on your team. Ela gathers intel and neither of those help her in doing so. Impacts would be nice but a camera and that censor gadget that's been in game files forever would likely be very good choices for her.
---
Her mines are only lackluster at best. I say this because one they don't have markers above them, unlike every single other defender gadget I can think of. You may say just remember where they are and be close to them but Ela's a roamer. Sometimes that's impossible to always be near them so when one goes off and you have no clue which one did you're kinda fucked. Unlike Lesion who has markers above them giving him a way better job at giving intel. They're also not plentiful, lethal, or hard to see. They're large, effects just wear out, and only 3 of them. Unlike Lesion who's mines require you to waste time in finding cover and remove them to stop them from damaging you, are very small, and very plentiful. Unlike Ela.
---
Out of every single roamer Ela is the worst by far. Her guns are very meh. Her shotguns great and can out range the scorpion any day. And out gun it no matter what range you do fight at. While the scorpion can take up to 7 shots to kill past 15m, that's if you hit the target which you likely won't at that range. The shotgun can take about 4 shots to kill at 15m. And it's a shotgun. Compared to every other roamer, she's bad at giving intel, compared to every other roamer she's bad at roaming, compared to every other roamer, she's bad at doing just about everything. Compared to every other operator on defense asides from Clash. She's outgunned in every single fight.
---
Works the same way my man. Just popped into a T-Hunt to show how it‚Äôs done
---
he's just standing there... MENACINGLY
---
I've had occasions where the chat is more toxic than Pripyat, but on the whole I've found as long as you don't antagonize the dude who has beef (like saying lol after calling him toxic) they'll chill and you can have good moments that you genuinely enjoy. You just have to not Stoke the fire
---
Last time I got favela in daytime was like a year ago on T hunt
---
3 Roamer hunters and a blitz just thought it was odd lol
---
Cool spot, I can't wait to completely forget about it the next time I defend that objective.
---
You forgot ‚Äúis it too late to use the bathroom?‚Äù But it looks great dude üëå
---
Are u sure this is a cosplay i think ur actually about to do a raid on a building
---
Favorite is Border, Villa, and Bank. The only map I hate is Favela. Seriously, remove Favela.
---
Take that back!
---
Favela is bae
---
I really want to see a Mira elite
---
You say rocket league is known for toxicity like siege isn't 100 times worse lmao. Not to mention a solo playlist would split up Queue times which already aren't amazing. It's a team game and there's nothing wrong with the devs expecting people that solo queue to be willing to work as a team
---
It‚Äôs unfair for the plats
---
They said it was designed for tanks, They were wrong.
---
Another guy I know caught boosting with low rank smurfsüòÇ thank you for this I've played with Osprey a couple days ago and he's toxic this will be funny. Keep exposing these sad kidsüëè
---
Posting it on reddit will do nothing
---
See the red network icon on the top right? You are lagging really badly.
---
When was this?
---
Witch hunting isn't allowed here, better delete your post
---
After it deploys it can't be destroyed (but that could also be interesting).
---
Really? Wow I hadn‚Äôt noticed üòÇ
---
Same its just good art
---
There is no aim assist in multiplayer.
---
I swear the map is cursed.
---
He's a much worse Valkyrie, he's not even close to a game changer to be ever worth banning.
---
I have seen it get worse and worse over the years and lately it hit a new low. You are most likely getting team killed by a squad queued all together. It seems like killing teammates is their definition of having fun.
---
I really think Ubisoft needs to apply this teamkill offense penalty to the entire squads instead of individual players, otherwise abusers will keep doing this shit without any penalty.
---
I know it‚Äôs frustrating really, but sometimes you find good teammates who play this game right and if you do, ask them to squad up.
---
Lmao you little trash what a burn
---
Luckily nitro cells are a thing to counter him
---
I keep seeing people make this and similar arguments and it makes no sense. the structure of rounds changes nothing. You are still playing the same amount of rounds on attack and the same amount of rounds on defense. 
---
If you go 3-0 on defense under the new system then you would have gone 3-0 under the old system too The only difference is now you switch to attack *after* going 3-0 as opposed to mixing in two attack rounds while you go 3-0 on defense.
---
That‚Äôs kinda the goal of shield operators? It forces you to improvise and potentially make mistakes.
---
What the actual fuck was that
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs tracing them between the piano and his aim is very precise.
---
Lmao I know that dude
---
Love the idea!
---
okay vigil t8mw for nerf
---
I know it's better on pc, everything involving guns is better on pc. But for console it really shouldn't be as bad as it is. Because with the low damage and fall off range her scorpion is just pitiful. And yeah i always find a nifty spot for my mines, just when they go off they really don't do anything when the guy who got effected has a buddy watching his back until the small 5 seconds runs out.
---
I'm new to pc gaming it the higher ping good for you or bad?
---
Sounds like it'll be a Bank reskin, a lot like Plane for the April Fools' event. HYPE!!!
---
Me on crack cocaine
---
MERICA
---
Dude are you fucking kidding how bout you go in extract hostage try doing it with buck then see how many times your going back for ammo
---
Its always frustrating for me to watch people spam flashes or concussion nades and wait till the effects wear off to actually push the room
---
Yeah and it was match point and we lost because of him
---
This is on console but the less the ping/internet connection the better
---
Oh... hell... yeah.
---
Secure the area with the sheriff looking operators defending and the gang looking operators attacking. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting from this.
---
Bad, the lower the ping the better the connection
---
When most people may say to always use acogs when you have it available, I‚Äôd probably say it depends on the play style you‚Äôd like to take. 
---
For attack if you‚Äôre very aggressive and mostly on site in close quarters combat I‚Äôd recommend either the reflex or the holo for easy quick maneuvering, but for long range engagements and holding angles I‚Äôd recommend an acog. 
---
On defense I‚Äôd recommend the same thing, but for most that have an acog, they‚Äôre pretty much anchors anyway.
---
this is y u shouldn‚Äôt play on console
---
I dont run Fuze with smokes. I take him to a room above OBJ and tear that floor up with breaching charges
---
And its all a wardens simulation
---
Great idea. But then it wouldn't be a team kill.
---
This map is made out of cardboard I swear.
---
I love the idea, but what CTU is he from?
---
the fuck is a rff

Hello 13Kadow13, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c1fl40/what_a_time_to_crash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
im obviously meaning without the bug
---
I would've never thought to use capitao for that.
---
wooooow
---
If I see a Twitch ban: Mira
---
If I see an IQ ban: Echo
---
It really depends on which side I start:
---
Attack: me and my friends never ban Jackal, we only ban Blitz/Monty because we don‚Äôt play shields. An Echo ban as our banned defender
---
Defense: we never ban the must ban defenders.
---
It really depends on which side we start
---
With his invisible drones he can just wait until the time gets close for the round and deny the plant so you win the round. He‚Äôs mostly for plant denial, but his invisible drones are great for relaying information.
---
Bad
---
Too bad he got favela
---
Couldn‚Äôt you have just taken barbed wire specifically from clash? The barbed wire is required for the bug (I think at least, I didn‚Äôt really watch the videos) so that would be an easy fix. 
---
Just a clash main trying to play their operator.
---
He has more willpower than most
---
No bots, every thing not player controlled is bad
---
it's also been a hell for me like i literally have more losses than wins but there will be good teams and when there are good teams make contact with your team and build your own ultimate team, you're better off playing with a friend or two together than alone.
---
COME ON you had for like 5 times already, I haven't even gotten it twice!
---
AI teammates do not belong in Siege. It requires teamwork and synergy to win a game which you just don‚Äôt have with AI. That‚Äôs why they aren‚Äôt available in other online competitive games such as Overwatch‚Äôs ranked. Sometimes those bots can be a detriment to your team as well depending on what they do, and definitely won‚Äôt be a match to actual live players.
---
Maybe not twice but 1 time
---
No. Way.
---
NO WAY
---
COME ON you had for like five times, I haven't even gotten it twice!
---
There is no advantage to banning Cav, that‚Äôs a waste of a ban.
---
Drone and communicate
---
Nope.
---
how the tables have turned, move over cav, we got a new spooky bitch
---
Nice idea, but normally people shot main door and don‚Äôt knife it
---
I am happy that you expressed your opinions in a civil manner. you bring up valid points however my opinion still stands as where im ranked (Gold IV) she is a non problem given that people know how to play and she is really a issue when its lower ranks. 
---
what you said about echo is a good point, one i did not think of, I still think he is an easy target similar to a maestro who is a giant meatball with an acog. while echo is just a lazy japanese guy with an acog
---
From the Rainbow Six Wikia
---
I know you're new, but you have to drone them out, people who spawn-peek/runout are easy kills.
---
I still die to them and I've been playing since 2016, but it's because I was too lazy to drone.
---
I know, such civility from a reddit sub, whats that.
---
The thatcher or sledge did, apparently, whoever had that final kill cam

---
is that a tk i see
---
So this new operator was a fucking pornstar before she joined Siege... oh wait, I have an idea, which will also get me a shit ton of money!
---
Shield ops are my favorite to play. I just like the way they change up my playstyle. I‚Äôm normally kind of unpredictable, trying to hunt roamers and bait people to follow me. But with shields it‚Äôs a lot more methodical, and I don‚Äôt have to worry so much about people lurking corners. My main goal as a shield op is this: I‚Äôm the juiciest distraction. I like to make a lot of noise, create a diversion, anything to get the attention of as many defenders as possible. It‚Äôs fun because they‚Äôre too paranoid to turn their backs (and for good reason, I‚Äôm watching for it. Had a Jager try to teabag cuz he thought I was just gonna sit there. He was dead before he got back up from the first crouch) but know they have to watch out because every second I have their attention is one second my team can move further up uncontested.
---
I tries angled grip first time today and I loved it
---
Is that haru?
---
The second you hear monty's shield go up?  His shield is really noisy when he retracts it, and no one pulls a Monty shield up without going for the ADS ASAP
---
I could be wrong here but I believe the reason there are no official Spetsnaz and S.A.S ops is because at the time there weren't women in those branches. However if you peruse the lore you'll find that Finka is part of the Spetsnaz.
---
Because it awards both teams 1 point, and since you were on matchpoint, they won because of it, I assume you were playing ranked?
---
indeed
---
For attacking my first main was IQ because I wanted to use the aug and my first defender was J√§ger because I liked his gun and he seemed easy to use. Atm I use Maverick for attack and Frost for defending.
---
Thermite to Jackal and Rook to Mira. But now that jackal has been banned almost every time I am going more Maverick and when Mira is banned more Maestro.
---
nah, csgo found a really intuitive way to imement 3d mapped textures. However, there solution was an engine integration I'm fairly certain, and everyone knows the engine rainbow six is built on is pretty ass by comparison
---
This is the only the second time I  have had a serious lag moment since I've moved here, the other time is also posted here but it's during the pick op phase so no trouble, my Wi-Fi is also nearly 150 down and up. So unless my provider had a hiccup right then there was no way it was my internet. My friend was also having trouble at different points in the same game, instances where after shooting his gun wouldn't reload, or some times where his bullets also did seemingly no damage. Therefore I shifted the blame on the server, or the host of the server, because honestly what are the chances both his and my internet had hiccups during the same siege game?

Angle Grip on therms gun? It doesn't kick a lot without the grip?

Soory im kinda stupid what "indeed" means

yes
---
Thank you for the advice. I actually ended up requesting a refund on steam so I could just purchase it through Uplay instead. It was 8 dollars cheaper on Uplay for the deluxe edition anyway so I saved some money PogChamp
---
Used to main mira and glaz. Now I main buck on attack because of his utility, and Jager because of roaming
---
Roamers hate him, attackers love him.
---
*Get nae-nae‚Äòd!*
---
You just need to adapt to it and it‚Äôs a headshot machine
---
More frustrating that it was a 3v1 and nobody thought to plant the fucking bomb knowing where the last guy was. Good job on OP though for outplaying them.
---
Yo that kinda like a 1000000IQ reapons

Yup

people still unironically say "dead game"?

Sorry for responding late, I was with my dad because, for me anyway, so it's father's day.

I basically just die really early, and my accuracy is very bad.

Obviously its not a perfect system but its definately a good idea.

My stats themselves aren‚Äôt great cause I played ranked when I was BAD. Now I‚Äôve been hitting Plat consistently so you could be right.

TIL!

they took out draws and now whoever the rules decide is the winner gets the point

I'll have to give it a try.

Go play cod then lol

Don't u mean brazilian? ;) huehuehue
---
I just realized it said loss..... my bad.... in the past it has been a draw and both teams received a point
---
Haven't played the game in a bit. Is that crackling sound part of the menu sound these days, or just a weird recording? Sounds like I'm wearing my wireless headset next to the microwave.
---
Something unique enough that people who pay attention, or even just anyone, would be able to tell that it's the net, in case they would prefer to just open up a line of site (or that's their only option)
---
I wonder if I'm wrong, but when I play console I use a higher sens in order to change directions a lot faster than most players, but doesnt a lower Sens mean better precision?

3 ranked games the last 3 days I lost because of this. Some real human filth out there
---
This is punishment for being a BB player
---
Cool, I actually have most of those. Just not thermite, doc, and J√§ger. But I will work to unlock those as soon as possible.
---
Oh I agree it's a good idea but gotta find a way around that first cuz I can't tell you the number of times I've solo queued with toxic 4 stacks

If you used to find yourself winning a lot of casuals that‚Äôs likely the reason it‚Äôs more challenging now, and Yh if you‚Äôre a consistent plat player I would consider you good

"Pretty good. At work. Hey, where are you right now? Like... where exactly?"

What? MuTadre is just a stupid name my friends and I use because it is like tu madre which is ‚Äúyour mom‚Äù in Spanish
---
Also, that was the first round we won as a team, we were losing 0-2
---
I can't tell it sounds like it's happening in a rhythm
---
I‚Äôm torn on house. I love how simple it is, but if I‚Äôm off my game then I just get destroyed on it because there‚Äôs an angle on you no matter where you are pretty much
---
Maverick, guns-good, ability-fucking awesome if you‚Äôre using it, annoying as hell if not.
---
Well, as I wrote earlier, I die a lot and I'm not very accurate. But I also don't know the maps at all really, and I don't know any audio cues. (I'm really new to the game.)
---
I fully agree with you on that. Perhaps some sort of system that can detect if players reporting around the same time were grouped together. It would stil require manual review but it might be a bit harder to game as it were.

I think he's a bit too disruptive. He has three scans each one pinging someone five times. I think it they dropped each scan to pinging three times it would be less oppressive.
---
Maybe just a buff for castle??
---
Go to manage game and add ons than go to ready to install try that
---
Cause he's fucking amazing on Bomb. He's one of the most played defenders in Pro League for example
---
really?
---
I guess it‚Äôs because if anyone dies first on the first or second round they just quit and search for a new game I‚Äôve seen it so many times already and since phantom sight it became worse I believe especially in the discovery playlist I also nearly exclusively join ongoing matches and started to think its better to just abandon them and look for new games
