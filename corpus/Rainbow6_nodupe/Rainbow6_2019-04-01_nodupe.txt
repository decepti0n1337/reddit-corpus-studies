ADSing with an ACOG at same sens as 1x is the same as using Kaid &amp; Nomads secondary, awful IMHO. IIRC there is a way to do it via the ini file but I do not remember how.
---
---
---
Me too bro
---
Put it this way, it ain't happening. Get used to it
---
I always thought it was the difference between Ubisoft accounts and Xbox accounts or maybe something similar.

Wellcome to rainbow six ping abuse and ash rushing, we hope you enjoy your stay

Nice drawing

Cav mains, am I right?

I like making fun of people who crowd the subreddit with "boo hoo i lost my rank feel bad for me" its great, even if I lose karma i got tons to spare

I just tried this and couldnt get it to work. What am i doing wrong?
---
Cyberpunk 2077
---
Lol it's called a bot sliver smurf some one who stays in sliver ranks to boost my guy . He most likely plat plus skill level. 
---
But I think everybody who plays rainbow has a uplay account, I don’t see why this could not be used to play on different platforms, unless the way they have specifically stored player data and progress prevents this
---
Wow that’s broken 
---
My RL folks know Burnt Sienna when we see it. 
---
But your feet smell so good :( 
---
He should get them too
---
I’m not sure. Is a uplay account the same as an Ubisoft club account? Or am I just stupid?
---
I believe they are synonymous with one another but I could be wrong 
---
oh i know its just funny to me
---
This community is as bad as how cod multiplayer was during the mw2 days.

Shoot when I was putting in work one session on my main I was stuck in sliver carrying plats and beating a few diamonds here and there solo ones at least . But the point is there are slivers who are plats on other accounts. Like not fake under 100 plats just unlucky smurfs who deranked for who knows what reason.  Very rarely are there true slivers who can carry that weight other then playing to much rank that season making there elo move like 5 points a win .
---
The highest rank, sever doesn’t matter. 
---
Just unsub
---
He just abandoned every game when he was about to lose 
---
Not a bug, there are a fee people like him
---
Oh you're totally right! It's actually more of a Burnt Sienna (googled it) I was mixing up GSGN and SAS.
---
Top Far Right, and the one next to it
---
NUT.
---
Its actually not, ran into him in casual tried to invite too, he didn't even try to hide it.
---
Skyscraper does need a few improvements but it’s a pretty good map if you know how to play it, every site is fairly balanced and can be won on either side
---
Good job, now do it in ranked 
---
nice witch hunt you have here 
---
With other elite skins appealing to combat style, I think the second right on top could be developed to be more coherent with the game. Also really wish to see Hibana’s knife being changed to a short samurai dagger🤔
---
This eye is truly evil 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
---
gridlock the 225 lbs legend vs the 127 lbs mozzie 
---
Put these on doorways as stoppers? Possible strat? 
---
Fake. He's standing still.
---
Id imagine future operators may have more than one, assuming 100 is still the goal
---
12th? On the 18th shit gets real wild!
---
O.o
---
This is cursed
---
It has a little bit of silver in there 
---
You pass right through them
---
Lol your a smurf r/quityourbullshit
---
yea was in obj. when i looked at the ground and held down x it kept dropping the bomb
---
I cant tell if this is serious. Jagers ads destroys projectiles and they can be destroyed by shooting them.
---
Bro exactly. Kaid makes no sense.
---
Used as a DMR or AR. Maybe integrate the underbarrel grenade launcher into a gadget?
---
If you have raw input on, turn that off. You could also try running the game as administrator.
---
Good portal reference.
---
of course the russians have the most red 
---
Damn. Is this repeatable?  Not that you would want to but I just wondering. My real question being if there was server side lag having your model still exposed to the blast. If we toss onto the sill and and detonate after a stand still behind and being stationary behind the vending machine, will we get tagged? Please don't see this a an excuse of why this happened, I'm just an inquiring mind
---
Wait doesn't this mean they'd already TK'd once lmao
---
Bronze? Good lord 
---
Lesion 
---
There needs to be 2x 2nd floor access without repealing. Or be able to spawn on roof. 
---
Just want a Glock as a secondary, unless there already is one? Mozzie i think has one but it’s in a roni kit.
---
Valk and lesion on defense, Jackal and ash on attack
---
Absolute unit
---
No one because i'm not plat 3 and below. 
---
Forreal. Mods are non existent on this sub
---
Mad lads tbh, it's awful
---
They only play in thunt, but each op has a few lines.
---

R4-C with an acog
---
What about attacking 
---
In your last post your silver, oh nvm that’s for boosting your friends 
---
Anyone know when the Y3 operator bundle coming out? Got the money just waiting for now.
---
April fools joke is you get a charm from the pack.
---
Sorry girl the bad pic I took it in a rush while queuing 
---
Kaid and Nomad’s 44 Auto Mag pistol. It’s just a really fun pistol to use on top of having a good ACOG attached.
---
Runner up is Alibi and Maestro’s Baliff 410 pistol. It’s a fucking shotgun pistol bro!!! A shotgun pistol.
---
I agree even though I may enjoy executing them a bit much
---
Cloud9 hahaha
---
&gt; Side Question for OP
---
Do the sens' change?
---
Does the vertical sens change to controlling the horizontal or does it stay the same where vertical is still describing up and down motions?
---
For attacking I don’t really have a main, but if the other team is really good I’m trash so Monty or blitz, then usually someone like jackal, twitch, buck, lion. I tend to pick jackal and then twitch if I feel like I want a smg or a marksman. Sometimes I pick Blackbeard on kanal for the windows. Sledge sometimes too. 
---
Fuze is bad
---
Actually they can. Game devs have the option of allowing m and k on console. That's how fortnite can tell if you play with controller or MnK
---
Siege is great because every game is the same yet every game is different. Same ops and same maps but what you decide to do with them is truly unique. It's like playing 4d chess but you can't see important parts of the board. 
---
Yeah
---
Didn’t know I needed to know this but thanks 
---
Because CS is for super tryhard pc nerds. Most of the Siege playerbase is on console, where people want more content. Remove even more maps and this game will go from stale and boring to struggling. 
---
Jäger’s ads can only take out 2 grenades. If you wanna get rid of them you either have to shoot them, shock them with a twitch drone, or EMP it with Thatcher through the wall.
---
I was going to say Capitao but Kaid looks like he’d whoop your ass up &amp; down the retirement home lol
---
Nope a total derank on accident with zero operators . It was suppose to be my practice one but I felt bad about all the smurfs bullying my dear slivers so I stayed sliver 😎 got to protect where i came from . Lmao 
---
I’m not even ranked and I main twitch and mabey meistro
---
Elites should have their flags incorporated into thier icons. 
---
My name isn't OP jackass it's Rake
---
Unranked is below copper. 
---
Well then it's whispering *It's free real estate*.
---
I was under the impression they did! I’ve seen a few in a few EBGAMES stores in Sydney. Not carbon-copy but it’s still pretty cool. I don’t have a picture at the moment but I’ll probably add one later.
---
this. The game is literally 5 stack or get out simulator.
---
Bet you could block a door this way
---
You can take videos off of the xbox and upload them to reddit...
---
What if the operators actually reflected their height in game? If they could implement it I honestly think it would add an extra, interesting mechanic to the game. Having Ying and Mozzie duck under everyone’s rounds. While Kaid and Sledge can hardly find good cover.
---
Ubisoft doesnt give two shits about the solo experience though, and its only made worse by literally everyone here being all "find a squad bruh".
---
Your wife with the pro plays. Wish my friends played as good as her.
---
???? Hibana and Echo are reddish colored, how the hell is black/white accent a reverse of that?

I think fortress's problem is its areas not being visually distinct personally

i like the larger maps because there's a lot of potential to rotate and flank. it makes callouts and observation on both sides more important. 
---
Pretty cool!

How is this threatening? He can report her all he wants nothing will come of it lmao. If people talk shit on mic I mute them and carry on with my day

Or sometime this week, depending on when your seeing this.

Man this sucks cause you could totally be lying to all of us and this is actually you pulling an April fools.

I agree

I must have missed read I thought you was saying I'm the one getting boosted lmao 
---
Hibana/Jäger-maestro-bandit
---
I like sweaters. They make me remember time I was bigger and slower 
---
that game is far superior to siege in every aspect one can imagine. Minus graphically of course. More customization, an actual story, more modes, more maps (though it may have surpassed it by now), making your level actually mean something, subjectively speaking better balance, and the list goes on. 
---
r/iamverysmart 
---
imo the only change theme park needs is that trains needs to be split into three perpendicular hallways instead of one long hallway. maybe give sites like drug storage a buffer hallway between them and outside.
---
Let me in. LET ME IIIINNNNN!!!
---
Yeah was waiting for my friend too get back and I ended up changing my user and avatar lmao 
---
Pengu was having the same issue on stream today. No idea if it’s been resolved and I haven’t been on yet today. 
---
paint3d on w10 is free. i could recreate this there if i had time or motivation. that's too much work for what is, imo, nothing.
---
I know! I went 15-7 because they couldn't counter spawnpeeks
---
wouldn't have even guessed this was a non default skin, let alone a bloody legendary. Man Epic tier steamrolls any and all legendary skin. 
---
So THIS is the forbidden fruit I've been hearing so much about.

Me neither :(

They got mad when I was "silver". This was in a gold plat game

Camera Perspective
---
FRIKANDEL
---
Has anyone tried using her in t-hunt?
---
It’s completely hilarious. On Bartlett I just had a Gridlock get 24 kills. She shot maybe 8.
---
they need more light blue ops
---
Then ya it’s probably the new bug like the other dude was saying. 
---
Thank you for the sweaters! 
---
As a roamer I appreciate them
---
Yah I got Mac daddy during the alpha pack event

 It's  not always hit reg but comes down to A. You missed, B. A super quick connection interruption or C. You hit a non hitboxed area.

Ah. Twice today. Downed a Kap and shot him where I predicted where he was, he left, then shot a Vigil in the chest a few times then wallbanged him too. This has been happening for about a week or two. Guess I'm analyzing pretty well this week.
---
The 55 gb one is essentially a redownload of the whole game. This update reduced the size of the game from 80 gigs to 50. Future updates will be smaller because of this
---
Probably April 1st. Just a wild guess
---
Are you implying Alibi's so thicc her hologram actually materialized itself as solid?
---
It's actually bronze. I'm not very good at this game.
---
Ok
---
Not really. Glaz has always been good but with his rework and the leaked S.S. operator he isn't what he was. Fuze is situational but still Ok. He has an amazing AR but hes also a 1 speed. Hes only good if theres a castle window or you want to waste Jägers grenades
---
You need an object to loop around, she always loses 1v1’s this man was just trash.

---
Operation Ubercharge?
---
While I don't disagree with you, a large part of improving in this game is to reduce those inconsistencies, whether it'll be better communication with the team, overall better plays and situational analysis, etc. While there will still be inherent inconsistencies because of the nature of the game, it is your prerogative as a player to improve upon your own inconsistencies.
---
We can clearly see examples of this especially in G2's performance in recent Pro League and Invitationals, it's just not possible to play at your optimal level at all times, but as long as you win when it matters, it's all good.
---
Throw 
---
It even has the compass symbol :P
---
Ah thank you
---
Is that how that works?
---
Are you smurf or a bot cuz I dont incourge boosting for rank you should seek to just play with higher ranks for the experience the rank comes later as you improve. 
---
I only boost to combat plat and diamond bullying and deranking golds silvers and plats with there let's get a smurf or copper so I can either play trash players to boost my ego or they try to get an upper hand by hiding there smurf in a low rank which I do because they do . 
---
But if your older then 14 just add my account I'll see how you play if you drop donuts or dont play site that's a fast way to get booted . But I would honestly say try searching in group post first and see where that gets you.

It is not excuse to not credit the artist. Not so hard to put a link by yourself and no need to wait for people that do it instead of you.

---
I recently got blood n rust for the bailiff and I'd honestly rather have this than that. 
---
I get like month long slumps, then month long streaks... sometimes I'm SUPER POTATOE, sometimes im the igl. start with t-hunt, play casual a little bit more than usual, pick operators you dont normally use, practice strats that are "unusual"... if your normally a roamer, try anchoring, vice-versa... stop playing for rank, and start playing for fun. When you get comfortable, and have your confidence built back up, return to ranked, I typically solo que, if you wanna catch a game, hmu "RebelOnTheRiver" (as long as you have a mic). 
---
As much as I’d like that as well I think the devs said somewhere that they aren’t gonna mess with house and just keep it a non-competitive casual map. :(
---
Nomad would be really cool. He could have some of the Búchon weapons in his loadout.

Silver ranked is still 10 times better than 90% of casual games IMO. That's why I don't get playing casual, other than for a few warm-ups or when waiting for friends to join etc.
---
Pog u 
---
It’s so easy to counter you don’t spawn with out cover and can do pixel peeks.
---
hey guys lost a 1v1 in round 9 cause of a claymore I was upset I’m sorry :(
---
Everyone : Hitreg sucks   
---
Ubi : your ping was high and packet losing when you saw the opponent 
---
Shhhhhh, don't make them fix it! It's perfect! 
---
Before these new patches, the game was more difficult because you had to control a harder recoil and use two buttons to lean fast.
---
Yeah but it’s still annoying 
---
Everyone is losing there shit in the comments, doubt most actually watched the clip
---
Just did it today. Gotta look down and hunt the pixel
---
Look at the base of the alibi and hunt the pixel

How do you play like this
---
What did you expect? Full fledged expansions every half season? With new maps, gamemodes and changes to the gameplay?
---
If you can't grasp the fact that you aren't in any way, shape or form obligated to buy any cosmetic items in this game you maybe should stop talking, uh?
---
Rook and Doc are roamers
---
I am 
---
I usually put "casual" in the title but I forgot to this time and to be honest the first guy should have got me, but it's also console so the aim isn't the best
---
I hope we get Navy blue with Year 4: Season 2 or Salmon or light greeen.
---
cheaters anonymous 
---
Indeed
---
Anchoring is something you do in defense. If you are on attack and you hold the door you are just holding an angle, sometimes on attack you are better off watching a door then moving or droning. 
---
Everyone needs it
---
Ohhh shiit
---
Its called GIF optimizing
---
I forgot to put casual in the title and its console, so of course the aim wouldn't be the greatest
---
just mute them
---
Agreed
---
Oh no  I can't talk about the way the game locks skins behind pay walls while devs hype the events during the largest irl event for the game.
---
What ever will I do?
---
Maybe add ela as a roamer?
---
Also maybe "Intel deniers" like mute, vigil etc
---
Just run trap comp too easy

---
"Oh no  i can't have a discussion on reddit because i have no valid points and now i have to use sarcasm to feel smart"

Have you tried unmuting it

You haven't got a choice with the matchmaking system. I've had times where I get placed into ongoing matches 5-6 times In a row. So no, this isn't fair. 
---
casual or ranked? casual would explain everything.
---
Sweetie I did state all my valid points but the argument _don't buy skins if you can't afford them_ is the most idiotic I've seen from this sub.
---
No wonder people dislike this place, it literally can't read any points people make for criticism because muh Ubi perfect
---
This sub uses "too op" way too much.
---
"hey, I have an Operator idea"

"Hold it right there, it's too op"

This sub in a nut shell.

You trolled yourself playing into the clash, she wanted you to keep backing up just rush her goofy ass and melee her shoot her legs
---
Change ammo types? 
---
Standard: explosives
---
Optional: (these would be selected in the menu )
---
Buckshot (shoots 6 shots in rapid succession 1.5 seconds or so)
---
Smoke
---
Emp (think thatchers emp only shoots one)
---
Drone? Pops a Valkyrie esq cam through the wall. Can be shot.
---
*RUST*
---
Me too
---
This is beyond science. 
---
I FUCKING SAW THAT AS IT CAME UP, now I’m mad for not screenshotting it
---
but i mean, imagine fuze like this, you’d never need a thatcher or even a maverick again. it would just reign supreme over the other operators gadgets as it also has killing capabilities.
---
He’s right though. 
---
Because most peoples operator ideas are OP power fantasy’s 
---
OP's idea is good but when placed on a electric reinforced wall, it should damage Fuze and in the end after placing the gadget, the gadget should get destroyed. 
---
NotBattleEye™️ has been banned by BattleEye™️

Sweetie if you can't understand that *don't buy skins if you think they are just overpriced* isn't *don't buy skins if you can't afford it* maybe the problem isn't this sub.
---
The recoil change was good for the game. If you’re losing to people who aren’t droning then you are likely not as good as you’d like to believe. 
---
No
---
No u
---
Do you think it would be a good buff if Maestro's Evil eye can see and shoot through walls, as well have infinite range? This would make it so there are no more places attackers can hide, and could be a very good OBJ rush, hard breaching counter. 
---
Using OP's logic 
---
The F2000, KSG-12, TM-9 SMG, Uzi, AAC Honey Badger, and the XM8 variants.
---
Just give her a 30 round mag/recoil buff, maybe even a slight damage buff and call it a day.  Her first few shots are accurate and then it becomes a potato cannon now.
---
Any minute now people will be arguing with you about that 
---
Siege 100

That's always me but I ws just lucky

I literally took a 30min break between games and still got placed against the same group I couldn't escape them. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I just spent 2 1/2hrs in que and gave up and started playing casual just so I could get a fucking match in tonight.
---
Yep, agreed.
---
The only maps I enjoy playing (not saying they're necessarily good) are Coastline, Bank, Consulate (sometimes) and Border
---
The rest is okay (apart from Skyscraper and Chalet) but usually not that fun
---
Yep. Mundane, and imbalanced.
---
I would have add a "Face flattener" category for Montagne :)
---
Git gud.
---
It's coming!
---
So guessing leaks of the April fools playlist might be true. This is going to be fun way to mess around in siege.
---
Damn, disrespecting our copper v brethren

unranked were 100% not diamond. maybe diamond BEFORE, but it's statistically impossible for them to be diamond level elo and unranked.

So your complaining about blitz, and a operator combo, that is rarely used effectively. But when you started playing when ela was released, everything was perfect and the best time to play siege, as opposed to now? I get it, global abilities are annoying, some aspects can be annoying, but when ubisoft takes advice from the community it turns into a bigger fire than it was already (granted on some things like ela it was more obvious). It's just hard to please the community, after this lion nerf, a lot of people are gonna say he's been nerfed too hard, or vigil was buffed too hard.

careful now,

In terms of operator identification the pink leopard skins are even worse

Honestly this is why we could really use an option to disable cosmetics clientside

R/SiegeAcademy helps a lot with new players for tips and stuff, as a new player myself it’s nice.
---
&gt; But most importantly, unfortunately XIM "killed" the game for good for me, I stopped playing ranked after Red Crow when XIM users were starting to be more and more common on Diamond ranked - then the amount of people using it grew up along with the player population.
---
This is an issue on basically every console shooter
---
Yesterday, I was playing as ying, and I killed a frost in the corner, saw my teammate crouching towards me, turn the corner and see a mira fucking sprinting towards what would be my teammate knifing him, instead of knifing him she knifes me in the chest, but I guess it didnt register? I hip fired her in the head and won.
---
Don't buy a laptop for gaming. It's a huge waste of money 
---
But it should t be like that. It should be like overwatch, if you’re too high, you can’t play with low ranks, go play casual.
---
I miss Pyroland 
---
or a pink barbie one 
---
They'd need to fix more maps to work in competitive (e.g. spawn peaking in Bank).
---
I think some sort of map banning system would be nice - give us the ability to say "not this map" for up to three maps.
---
Its the new melee operator 
---
And going by my luck, the free pack(s) I get will probably be charms

APRIL FOOLS, BITCHES!

Use TAA than you can set what ever you want.

If they will really release these pink skins we'll be one step closer to R6: 5v5 Fortnite

Not at all. I'm sick of people calling every. Single. Thing. Toxic.

Like yeah he's saying to lose the round, but he's not ruining the game for you. The mute option is there.

If he were explicitly ruining the game out of your control, then yeah. A ban is necessary.

Just shit talking? Fuck no.

This is gonna make me sound retarded but I literally just now realized Mozzie’s emblem was a helmet...
---
Nomad is pretty broken, but you need a more skill than lion to play her effectively. Like with lion you can literally be braindead. All you have to do is press one button and you have influence over the round. With Nomad at least you have to get in the building, place nomads effectively, and aim a little bit.
---
Imagine this IS just a April fools prank and they are fooling everyone.
---
Yes but do you drone the other side of the map?
---
30 damage no recoil change. Trade off for high rate of fire and ammo, I forgot the gun takes 5 shots to kill a mouse(mozzie).
---
Yes
---
It says I currently hold because of making bad decisions how can you not read that 
---
Bro u gotta throw that shit in water it's all dried up
---
Is the event out right now?
---
“Later, nerd”
---
An entire team of Caviera. That would be scary. You never know when she is coming for you. It will be scary as shit. 
---
Also an entire team of nomads. I can just imagine everyone flying everyone. Hahhhahah 
---
Yeah I understand you... for now you're the only one who   commentated in a constructive way.
---
im gonna do it...
---
As much as i hate leavers since in my last 20 games in 13 of them someone has left, this would give solo smurfs a huge advantage. Solo Smurfs would have really easy time if this was a thing
---
Am I supposed to drone that?!

I had Jesus Christ leave my game in ranked and guess what we lost

RPK LMG, Galil AR, KelTec KSG, Glock-20, M9 Beretta, and a drum mag Saiga 12 or 12SZ
---
It has to be real because I remember a bunch of the skin leaks from a month ago and they had a Chonk with a unicorn helmet. This is definitely real.
---
Hibana’s recoil have been increased in my notice, plus if you open barricade by using your primary than melee then don’t buy Hibana. Her primary and smg shoots really fast, so if you are wasting bullet most the time, probably you have to constantly reloading in game.
---
strong language, just not in chat. 
---
I usually melee 3 times to open a barricade... and I don't really find myself reloading too many times.
---
Basically me 70 hours ago when i was level 1 and just started playing siege
---
it better be, because i really want to take a break from playing casual for plane, as it only comes up a fraction of the time there. 
---
Tiny ying  rushing would be aids and kaid and sledge would be absurdly easy to kill
---
Give the doc mains some credit here
---
Kratos really let himself go. 
---
From what I remember when seeing a video about the different audio options, is that night mode makes loud sounds quieter, while every other sound stays the same. So it really affects stuff like gunshots.
---
Muzzle flash. They just see what the game tells them and think the supressor is shit.
---
Nope, it happens to us all. I got ranked copper cause I was messing around with friends, first copper game with a team of coppers we were against GOLDS!
---
Yeah, again, makes no sense. Essentially Thatcher with no where near as much utility. Killing the lights does next to nothing.

Yay new cosmetic items which u cannot just buy but must to play in gambling shit*

---
Oh yeah, forgot about that. It's been almost 1,5 years since they removed his Acog
---
Nomad, as she can be played with a team or when you solo queue. Finka is good but I think you need a good team to communicate. So overall Nomad.
---
Hilariously enough, the flash hider doesn't do shit to the flash
---
You don't have to gamble. If you don't want to, just don't buy into it
---
Oof will have to look up a comparison video. The main reason I use it is for the recoil dampening.
---
Rogue-9 has a great video on the supressor vs the other attachments, I recommend that one.
---

Mute!
---
So if you are telling me that if your defending and the lights go dark and things start blowing up your not going to be at all fazed. 
---
Ok that's fucking crazy, I literally started it thirty seconds ago before checking your reply lmao
---
They forgot one thing: The map isn’t upside down!
---
I mean, he's really the only person with a video like that. Not really a surprise
---
good point
---

---
^ real goals right ,ere
---
I know some things I did wrong (I didn’t know where the Camera was, should’ve droned a bit more, leaning angles were sometimes wrong angle, which could’ve gotten me in trouble), but if anyone has any other advice that’d be great
---
There were a couple
---
Done a glitch, and didn’t want to get banned so u lied saying you got stuck... 
---
operation  V  A  P  O  R  W  A  V  E  ?
---
The thatcher just turns around like wait a minute...
---
this will do nothing to increase pickrate or fix his irrelevancy 
---
I think they spawn on defense too
---
APRIL FOOLS!
---
No, because THATCHER DOES THE EXACT SAME THING. We have, since the literal release of the game, always had a character that can turn off the lights. I'm sorry mate, but it just isn't a good operator. 
---
Fabianerro looks like interro
---
So this is what one sees in hell
---
you have to go through steps to do this glitch. quit lying and acting like it was an accident 
---
Nooooooo why would i dooooo that
---
Just put your crosshairs more at head level when not aiming, and when looking through windows sweep your sight across all angles instead of just giving a quick glance.
---
Ping abuse is still an issue, peeker advantage is still existing. Sure: not as big as previously, but still existent. 
---
Honestly we all take pleasure in those moments that a kid calls us a hacker. 
---
Is that odd job 
---
Okay well all I'm saying is imagine that it's like Thatcher but amped up to kill all the lights in any room 
---
Still, that would make half the objectives unplayable, and bandit/kaid a must have. Still way too unbalanced and not fun at all.
---
It is April 1st
---
A full team of rooks, imagine everyone with 5 plates of armour.
---
Also 5 fuzes, fuzing 5 rooms including objectives oof. 
---
It wasn't even me doing the glitch (as you can see im dead and spectating) and my friend was rapelling and rubberbanded into it
---
"Six said it was my turn on the drone"
---
Awesome! I’ll add you. We aren’t too great either, but we just enjoy playing with some goodhearted friends
---
Pls be patient it has autism.
---
Or if ash could breach bandit’d reinforced walls and had aimbot!
---
It's not about paying for the shit, it's about making you pay to have a fucking chance of getting something. 
---
Gosh, this whole thing of no one makes you buy is super retarded and detrimental to the whole gaming industry. 
---
Next operator gay
---
r/woosh
---
Go into a room on Siege, throw an EMP grenade anywhere, watch the lights go off, and observe for yourself how little effect this has on the game 
---
Oh dude, you better watermark it or something because there are vultures out there will steal that shit and pump out cheap T-shirts faster than a noob gets TK'd on free weekend. 
---
its like the leaked tachanka and smoke skins
---
Oh yeah
---
Ah the Rainbow 5, the way it was meant to be played..
---
Thanks, just got a Monty head gear 
---
Pulling out a metal reinforcement from our asses seem realistic to me

you didn’t make this

It makes footsteps louder and loud sounds like gunshots and explosions quieter so it is much easier to pinpoint where enemies are.

---
Where's the event challenge?
---
I will spend money to have tachanka with a unicorn horn
---
&gt;the pink uniforms are real
---
Why
---
I'd love to play this mode but unfortunately the map is plane, and plane is garbage.
---
I'd take bloody house over plane, nice doll house? yeah that would work.
---
But plane? Plane is damn bad. I can't even have fun on this map casually.
---
haha yeah, people will complain about everything I know, I just hate plane. 
---
Also I never said it was a good method. The fact remains that if you do not want to support it, you should not buy into it.
---
£30
---
Yea, I'm hiding out on old reddit to avoid the theme and also because I hate new reddit.
---
How is this a social experiment?
---
Yup. It worked. I got the tachanka unicorn helmet 😂 thanks for the help

Yes, one of the many types.

Are that skins available to purchase??

7 days so this time next week.  
---
I found it on google drive mages in some website, been on photos for ages 
---
The message on the screen said seven days
---
That’s kinda messed up, unless you were in a 5 stack.
---
You ran in front of the site door without a lot of checking, Bandit almost killed you, he should have, in fact.
---
Wow, now my mom will finally let me play this game.
---

They say that but I cone a April fool joke and be  less but most likely a week

Implying he actually cared about Siege

Like it or not, events like this are good for the game

in the german one they already announced the event [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/de-DE/home/index.aspx](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/de-DE/home/index.aspx)
---
You must be new here. 
---
I'd buy smoke's mask... but why can't let us do this?
---
Only packs...
---
They won't get my money this way
---
Ow yes
---
The french are up to something
---
Dude these are really **really** awesome, great job!
---
Do you by any chance have others or plan on making others?

He couldn't have, it came out after he died.

Hey buddy!

FUCK YOU

Where was that small cutscene from?

I believe what he means is: if you prefer fooling around and having fun, a game where that is the default might be better.
---
However, as u/LibogAmputa has pointed out, a game typically played seriously does double the fun when some more casual fooling around happens, which I personally enjoy as well.

Idk but a guy in t hunt  had head gear of one

I made it in Source Filmmaker.

Who knows what thoughts lie behind that mask?

What thoughts if chronic, sustained cruelty

What is this? An event or something?

I wasn't expecting it

Please tell me this isn't real... I'm colorblind enough as it is...

---
PROTECT MR BEAR!
---
the legendary “please headshot me” headgear
---
Well, some people like the more tactical and military feel of games. It´s not like Siege was ever a hyper realistic Mil Sim but it never got into COD absurd terretory. I would have been fine with the items only be available for the event, for a longer time, like 4 weeks. But after that the overall feel of certain cosmetics were always in the believable terretory and they are clearly crossing a line with the astetic here. 
---
It´s also the 3rd or 4th time (not sure here) that they giving you the chance to buy RNG packs with real money, noone cares for the RNG in the normal packs because they are always obtained with ingame currency. Noone would call them out for just releasing the items for a certain amount of R6 Credits, so you can buy what you want. But they have to stuck them behind an paid RNG wall wich is not okay imo. 
---
That's nuts
---
Because it’s M A G I C A L
---
Hold on... that’s plane.... in kids room.
---
I won’t be able to play the event ;-;
---
I want them :)
---
Thank you for not drawing *The Donald* ....
---
The ultimmate way to reinforce kids bedroom
---
And both these pink and those yellow skins give them disadvantage so its not really a problem
---
What a day to find out that my video card is dead and l am unable to play Siege for a while... 
---
Great argument.
---
April 1st, ill believe it tomorrow. 
---
could of improved ranked but ok
---
Is it out now
---
You’re not forced to do anything. We are spoiled with operators and maps in this game, the cosmetics are just something extra on top if you want it
---
.
---
&gt; Don't shoot me!
---
I'm totally playing this on acid now.
---
Man, I wish I get this one! Wish me luck you guys!
---
I agree!
---
Then why are you complaining in a Ubisoft subreddit? I'm not okay with lootboxes by other companies, but the R6 model is very good. I can get always get what I want without spending infinite amount of money.
---
1st april
---
Why would a humpback whale hold a trout?
---
It is and it’s amazing
---
Ranked updates are coming in June.. what has including a fun limited time event got to do with the teams that focus on ranked content. Look at the bigger picture....
---
Is it fuzeable?
---
We are spoiled with Overpriced operators and unbalanced maps? Definitely 
---
I wanted people to take the first 2 panels seriously.
---
It's perfect. Now you really wonder whats in the gas.
---
Oh boohoo, Ubisoft tried to do something fun and goofy for April Fools. Theres always gonna be one person who whines
---
Wait how

##Big oooff
---
I have no idea 
---
How do u get tag for main?
---
Why? Where do you live?
---
Hello There
---
The problem with it is that they MAKE you have to spend money to gain something out of it. It’s a stupid system, you should just be able to directly buy whatever it is you want to have. You shouldn’t have to buy the ENTIRE collection just to earn what you want.
---
You've missed the point, and we are not spoiled with operators and maps, we get maps for free, but have to grind for the operators, but fortunately we can just open our wallets and buy them, and the cosmetics are something on top, but I shouldn't have to gamble for them, this isn't fucking Las Vegas.
---
Is it a universal skin?
---
I got it too
---
Reinforced kids???? \*TKs intensify\*
---
but I want the entire collection though.
---
Should've just been for April Fools only, games a realistic tactical team shooter not some fucking children's game
---
oh boy, two packs out of how many? again, I understand they're optional, still doesn't change that it's shit.
---
you can spend your money how you please. I don't feel "lucky" because some random dude pays for this kind of stuff at all. again, your money, you can spend it how you see fit.
---
Cause people keep buying this shit.
---
Woah...Did you make this?! This is freakin awesome! Man, I wish this was in the actual game
---
Can we buy the outfits for use after the event ends??
---
makes you feel like recruit 
---
##ITS APRIL FOOLS SHITDICK
---
That’s great, then buy the whole thing. Maybe that’s why you don’t see a problem with it.
---
Same happening for me
---
I see a new shield skin....
---
Oh yes
---
Loving it 
---
Fabian, it says it right there
---
How many challenges will there be? Their tweet is plural, yet people are saying only one?

I want tranny Blackbeard

Is the event challange a win in the new game mod?
---
You may also want to start with a black filliment and switch as soon as it stops doing the back round and starts on the design
---
Oh no, some secret spies has located teddy
---
If you are not connected to the server it will appear as the base burnt horizon splash screen/UI. Restart your game fully. 
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the info.
---
Is this a April fools joke?
---
Yea he's the new guy in the team. Glad they picked him up tho, he seems to be a pretty good support player. Used to play at Fabienta back when they won the six invitational 2018
---
Good for you, then buy the whole thing. Unfortunately, the problem isn’t solved simply because your fine with it, it’s because your blind to it. Your looking away from the issue.
---
I'll take the pink thanks. Those outbreak uniforms are a scourge. Doc looks like Lion ffs. That's game-breaking. Rainbow unicorn Tachanka helmet and bright pink Blackbeard are just brighter targets.
---
 [u/Its\_Epi](https://www.reddit.com/u/Its_Epi) told me some information
---
I used to use 85 lmao, higher is possible without being insane 
---
Oh for fucking sure
---
i bet he doesn't even play the game 
---
*good*
---
blyatiful
---
The event challange is to win in the new game mod?
---
Yeah, done in Source Filmmaker.
---
Yeah standard dualshock
---

---
I wish the kids room was reinforced, just for that extra spice
---
yee yee time for a new phone background.
---
This is casual. Look up his stats or something
---
When the event ends they just leave the large version of house and turn it in a 100 man Battle Royale 
---
5 nights at the Freddy

#aprilfool
---
No reinforcing 
---
Funny and fun. 
---
Lots of dicks playing atm though. Might get through a full game by tomorrow evening 🙄
---
Look, I suppose you missed the point.
---
There is nothing wrong with monetizing new content. That is not what this post is about. 
---
The problem is, that to get 1 specific skin you might want to have you must either literally gamble until you get it which may cost you  one lootbox (5€) or it may cost you 16 lootboxes (80€). 
---
The alternative is to pay 40€ and straight away unlock them all.
---
This is literally gambling mechanics, with same triggers as casino games for gambling addicts. 
---
This is what is extremely predatory. All they had to do was to make specific skins directly purchasable for 2-4€ a piece. Then it would be a decent model.
---
Are you kidding ME??? This is clearly harassment. Listen to the tone in this dudes voice. It's not playful or light, it's aggressive and hostile. No reasonable person would use that tone in a "joke" with a total stranger. 
---
I agree that you can just mute people, but that doesn't excuse shitty behavior. I also don't think this is worth banning someone over either.
---
FUCK YESSSS
---
Nice, that one is what I was thinking of. $24 season pass, here I come!
---
why do people always use iron sights on bandits mp7 i see it all the time, am i missing something?
---
For a full 7 days
---
So I guess Doc does stimulants and Smoke does hallucinogens. What does Bandit do? 
---
I made a post about this like a month ago, and people haaaated the idea. Now that they see it in action, lots of people are thinking it’s cool. 
---
Yeah, I was scared I was gonna die, but Mozzie was bad.
---
His eyes behind the mask shows us the lord is dead inside.

Its 4250 creds, so like $35

I/gasthejews88
---
I saw the fear you had
---
Pal wroty
---
Honest question. Would you rather not have the event or have loot packs that cost real money?
---
As much as it sucks. Everything in this game (operators and maps) cost nothing so this is how they can fund a team to continue the support of a game on its fourth year.
---
Just checked. It is
---
Cue 200 more “Here’s my depiction of the April fools playlist!”
---
they dont need it, ubi is doing fine they just really want as much money as possible
---
That's adorable.
---
There were 4 event packs in Y3 as well. Chimera, Sunsplash, Halloween, Road to S.I.
---
Lmao, like you even know what its like to be on LSD. Sit down child
---
This is seriously cool
---
Is this a April Fools joke or is it real?
---
damn didn't know trump is transracial 
---
No way you did this on a control  
---
Imagine if they actually did doors in certain places instead of just the barricade. Maybe even just at least the front doors lol. 
---
What if you wanted to find the objective but the game doesnt recognise that you're starring at it
---
Drugs is plural. Fuckin all of em

I want an event where attackers are replaced by xenomorphs and drones are face huggers.
---
Thing is even if you do happen to buy skins they are not required whatsoever to help you become better at the game.They are cosmetics only and if you want to gamble for some go for it, but why get triggered if someone wishes to spend their own money on it?
---
This is the best event ever 
---
for real not even uplay responding its tells me im level 0 with 0 ubi points

Is it Obama? If it's Obama I love it. Fuck Trump
---
I had that happen a while ago, the files were still there so when I hit download, it found the files and just verified them.
---
Woah what the fuck I thought this was some dude prone on the floor of kids room, and they just added some decorations in there lmao
---
„My main goal is to blow up..“
---
If you only want one skin, it's literally paying to gamble and losing until you get the one thing you want. And yes, its possible to be much worse. But i'd like to think we can expect a bit more for ourselves than "at least its not literally the worst cancer"
---
I second this :)
---
Very True but there is fix...…………...  
---
Switch drones very quickly
---
You stay away from Mr.Bear
---
Please
---
Hey I'm willing to admit I'm not creative if you're willing to admit you have no friends and are incredibly dull.
---
So exactly how much coke have the developers been doing?
---
This is so scary!!!!!!!! If you hate any player in game or you want rank up,you only need to make many crank call and message to him and force him  surrender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
One meanie left!
---
I dont think hes serious about the drone thing btw
---
Dude, that animation is lit as fuck.
---
In that roll film, we can see a German tank crew angle the frontal armor to bounce every enemy shot and shoting back
---
Do you get multiple free packs? How?
---
We liked the last guy better ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Umm actually, there is a skull in the backgeound.
---
Thanks. 
---
I also had faith... That my EMP would stop a c4 traveling at 590 m/s
---
Good job

I wanted to feed the bear some pogo sticks. It's chocolate flavored!

This was kinda funny at first but 2 hours later and I'm kinda over it. Plane is a shitty map and hostage is a shitty game mode.
---
I feel like way too much effort was put into this gimmick.
---
That needs to be a universal weapon skin!
---
Just go play the game! Honestly, it's too good, like eating a jar of frosting and vomiting too good!
---
There better be a strip club in there. That’s the Soul Plane.
---
Lol you don't need to buy it, just grind

Shit they always make these so hard to get

You dont need elites, if you dont want to pay for it, almost everything else in siege you can buy with renown

no, it's a pg 7 gamemode lol..you will love it when you get in

Play apex then. One shot headshot shall stay as it is
---
And that changes the fact that this game is monetized like a Free-to-Play game and doesn't need any more predatory gambling and micro-transactions? 
---
Challenges generate them as well
---
Wouldn't know because the game crashes every time it tries to load this bullshit. Happy April Fools! You can't even play today! GG! What a great joke! You got me!

That happens, people who do it are cucks

You’ll get yelled at for picking a useless operator then. Just play whoever you feel like playing, don’t let others bully you into certain ops. 
---
With the new rainbow is magic event my game seems to crash at loading screen or right before I can even do anything. Is anyone else experiencing game crashes on Xbox?
---
This is the greatest thing in existence. Ubi please don't ever remove this. 
---
I got this too. It’s gonna be funny in ranked when you get killed and see this in the death cam. 
---
This is an amazing event
---
"He's not here is he? How do you get this damn thing off!"
---
*Knocks over camera*
---
False
---
Same... just started crashing now
---
4th crash in a row
---
Does anyone else's game crash constantly since the event started? I'm on Xbox btw.
---
Its Counter Strike for kids!
---
I'm more thinking for well known players such as "ranked stars", especially at the start of the season when everyone is at the same MMR. 
---
Go against someone you know is a diamond during your placements? Just have one member of your squad leave so the rest of you don't take the hit. 
---
It has it's perks don't get me wrong. 
---
Queue dodging was possible before with siege before they introduced the new matchmaking system in Operation Health. It seemed to have been a big enough issue for Ubisoft to remove it once before.
---
This reminds me of playing TTT on Garry's Mod like 6 years ago.

Year 3 op bundle out?

Its not monitized like a f2p when most of the cosmetics are available to purchase with renown. If you want to buy the packs go ahead but you dont have to, im definitely going to because i want to support the devs and keep this game free, 
---
And ya never paid for weed! Not once...

I got into one game fine and then it crashed on me like 7 times. Oof.

My game keeps crashing, and challenges wont show up when I go into uplay menu. My game has never crashed like this before or this many times.

was kind of hoping ubi would reinforce the walls in kids for the meme lol

Honestly this sounds like a Net Neutrality issue being repelled. Don't you happen to have the same ISP maybe?

Don't you mean paint???

&gt; thinking a rotation of 6 ops for atk and def on a different map each week
---
?
---
Oh I see thanks for the clarification.
---
I just wish we could buy packs with renown. Is it that hard for Ubisoft to stop money-whoring
---
I played 3 matches on the new play mode then it crashed. Now every time i start the game it immediately crashes.

That was so cool!

---
Why are you playing hostage in the first place
---
Lmao gold 3 pleb
---
same here on PC. guessing its all platforms
---
But im the one whos actually provided any facts though. But okay go snd act like a typical liberal which you sound likenone anyways so i guess it makes sense. Also no one agrees with you who actually plays Ela. Get off your shitty little hover drone and get off your ass.
---
How naive of us
---
So i assume it’s the degradation across all servers. Great. 
---
Same on PC
---
No,it's a map background. I think doors in this game would be too huge of a change.
---
I loved them too. Especially with gravity turned down to half. 
---
This sub is made of hypocrites, last year everyone was bitching about the outbreak packs, now everyone wants to buy them. The community really went downhill.
---
And the only thing you can grind for is operators (which takes way to long for a new player who doesn't want to spend any additional money)
---
And some of the regular skins which are usually recolours with some camo pattern
---
Game keeps crashing on me every time I try go to ubisoft challenges.
---
You actually clicked on an April fools game mode and you’re still posting this? Wtf? This is like ordering a hamburger and posting “real chicken”

Weird flex but ok

Umm question...I'm on PS4 and it keeps crashing before I get to the loading screen, anyone else have this problem?

No need to flex fam

Hell no

It was, you're not acting like an adult (or at least not a very mature one). For someone accusing another of being a child you sure are one childish adult. What kind of person would you be if you went around insulting children? Doesn't seem very mature to me.

---
I agree. It would be a better system to buy what you want. But paying for a random item shouldn’t be considered gambling in my opinion. You’ve negated the risk of losing your money by still getting an item.

If you don’t mind me asking, how would you solve the problem of loot boxes being in so many games? Should they be outlawed?

Ranked needs a rework, but the reason the elo is based off of team effort and not personal effort is because it’s a team game, support players would get like no elo

There already is a chainmail headgear for Twitch
---
SO MUCH FURRY HATERS
---
Only problem with that is people will just go for kills that's it, in higher ranks the guy who plays support, makes call outs and denies plants (echo) is just as useful as the guy getting 3 kills a round. I believe you don't lose as many points if you go well though but I could be wrong.

Nope. Just for a week; you'll be fine.

I think it should consider both I could but all them could be steals 
---
That is true, I still feel there needs to be something for individual performance. Could rework it like how it used to be with points, more points for teamwork such as assists, use of gadgets etc but still some for individual performance.

Not that many, mainly just new textures

Yes. Why would you own something if no one else can know about it? Stop with this stupidity

-16 karma for an opinion on cosmetics

If they do that, it’ll leave way too much room for toxicity. Think about it;

You teamkill in 3 games intentionally, get voted out, and boom, you’re safe from being kicked in further games by teammates due to your toxicity.
---
I understand where you come from, but it’d be a flawed implementation.

Doubt 100 im mid to high plat sooooo none of that its a rank calm yourself. Provide yourself with 2 minutes and spray 2 mags into a wall. You will notice it will kick in the same direction at any time. If you control the basic direction in which its going the spread of the bullets isn't random it has a specific area (not big enough for it to affect your muscle memory of where the bullets generally land). You know those charts for the bullets in the gun menu? Yeah they show you exactly where the bullets will be hitting if you look close enough.
---
Yava! by Babymetal plays in the background

what cutscene is this? Self made or from old rainbow games?

Respect our little friend. 
---
I play on console and since this update the hit reg has been horrible, back to a spray fest. You get kills when your lucky. 
---
I saw the title, and thought “Oh no” but I do agree with this list. It makes sense, and it’s not a rant, that being said, does Ubi care? Probably not.
---
It's always fun as Maestro when you see someone who can destroy your turret but then you realize they don't know that. Sometimes it feels like seal clubbing, but it's still funny.

On Reddit's 1st-party app? iOS or Android?

Sure! I' am working on download links as well

iOS
---
I've had the exact same thing. Or people just being toxic in game chat. Got teamkilled the other day for 'stealing his kill', he was then trying to get his friend to team kill me the next round. Some people you cant work with but if there were better rewards for support roles maybe more people would work together.

Welcome to r/rainbow6. Your only 2 options here are Tachanka memes or public execution.

Surprised we didn’t see this come with the packs it definitely would have made more people buy some!

is this done form of new sideways hatch?

Mh, they are showing up for me. Try force closing the app, it usually only pulls new assets on a restart.

Ive just been waiting 7 minutes for a match right after getting montagne headgear listening to the new music

---
Heck you
---
I lowkey thought this was fortnite and was really confused
---
Yeah the pink elite operators i was talking about.
---
Are any of the weapon skins universal?
---
No i see it to i'm not really sure what it is but it looks fine with the raw screenshot
---
I agree to an extent. It would be better to have the option we have a comic book Valkyrie and a blitz with a fat ass gold tooth etc... just would be cool and would be able to be used on viable ops. The magic skins are cool but really the only two ops I personally use and a lot of people might agree are smoke and montagne, but I do respect your opinion as it’s a great one

Ask for a refund
---
If I'm insulting the children who willingly waste their money so that bullshit loot boxes can dominate the industry, then yeah... Fuck off, children.
---
After playing the event and getting back into normal siege, I accidentally kill a pulse who ran in front of me who proceeds to vote kick which barely fails and the next round he lets his buddy pick blitz and then blinds me so I can't fight back and kills me and then leaves the game with him. Why
---
Feels good when the ELITE pink operators I expected come true🥺😍.
---
Can you upload the video to Youtube, I would love to use it!
---
I thought I was looking at fortnite 
---
Honestly shut the fuck up 
---
I wasn't clear in what I meant. I really like the idea and they already have one made so there's no reason they couldn't do more. My bad.
---
I don't think Montagne is broken; individually he's very one dimensional
---
The lord outfit is still my favorite, but this one is pretty sweet. 
---
Still nothing. Weird. 
---
did you get that from Family Guy?
---
Yup
---
No... definitely not making the exact same joke they did  
---
Same. 
---
But you dont rematch people...
---
Mute is definitely one of the more powerful operators in the game, in my opinion. Fantastic gadget, access to nitro cell, shotgun/smg-11 combo, and a hard counter to most opposing operators. 
---
start a petition lol
---
One those charts dont, they show where bullets will land in a general area not specifically. It is random and wanna know why literslly just played a dreadful round with that shittu gun and guess what all bullets on the two durfaces I shot at were all in different places, and slso the recoil pattern was deffinently popping left or right at different points so no youre deffinently wrong. It is random you can literally ask anyone who has a higher iq thsn you which is suprisngly most if the siege community niw that I look at it. So stop pulling facts out your ass alright mate? Also yeah im pretty sure im a plat mate. Can kinda see it with my eyes.
---
Why is the president black?
---
Exactly
---
That would be awesome. Im always up for shooting a dog
---
When you unlock plasma pink
---
It depends on your game style, but I'll suggest you vigil.
---
Well I guess I can do that and hope that it gives me a pack when I complete it
---
Yeah that's what I've been thinking
---
I didn’t say that... you just put words in a quote and said that I said them.

And if you don’t like them, don’t buy them. Don’t support games that use them. Vote with your dollar and don’t support these practices. If someone is dumb enough to spend $100 on cosmetic packs in a game I find it hard to have sympathy for them. But at least they got something for their money. 
---
But getting government involved in this is a slippery slope, and I disagree that countries should be banning them. Are we gonna ban the Pokémon TCG next? How about Kinder Surprise Eggs? You’re getting a random prize in those examples too?

r/overwatch exists m8
---
Any gallery of the event items?
---
Don't worry, this map will come back for Halloween fully reinforced. Truly frightening 
---
As a lesion main, i agree. It's my fav op on defence and my most hated on attack. Even Caveira and Clash are less annoying.

Hello TechWiz717, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b89gh4/psa_the_event_challenge_is_to_kill_40_drones_in/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

/r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow PSAs because of repetitive abuses.

Choose a different title and re-submit your post. Thank you.
---
It would’ve been great
---
To be honest I just wanna see outbreak return permanently because if you think about it, uni made several maps, a whole ton of new gameplay mechanics and enemies and a ton of more which thus far hasn't been re used and so far all we've heard is that it might come back in the future. It would be a shame to waste all that amazing existing content
---
Played it twice today 
---
i miss those days where favela was playable :)
---
What's up with that color scheme? 
---
Nowhere near lol
---
oof
---
Good ace 👉🤠👉 
---
The club is back up and the challenge should be there now

Yes educate me on manners after you took time out of your day to ridicule me on something I contributed to a community in hopes of bringing a laugh or a little bit of awe. And the fact that you called me Mr. Penis breath makes me think that your a 10 year old who’s had a bad day
---
If you were an Xbox player where would this show up?
---
They are never gonna rework house. That's the special map
---
i take it you guys weren't into TF2 back in the day...
---
[Meet the Pyro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I)
---
those are some nice bobonga wonkas
---
No shot. Seeing a lot of the community doesn’t like this. Maybe custom games would be a good option. Like pick the Halloween map or the April Fools plane. That would be fun.
---
This isn't g2, it's fabian esports
---
INIMICUS
---
Don’t give up hope yet, my friend. Who’s to say he won’t get wind of this?
---
Lol why are you so upset by my remark. I didn't even mean to offend you when I asked what you were drinking. It was a joke, chill out man 
---
There is 5 attackers and in season 2 5 defenders (remember the s2 defender is American) so add them as well and that’s a pretty cool idea 
---
How many times must we hear this joke?
---
The developers must really love Smoke. I barely see him get played and he still gets all these damn headgears, most of which would work equally well with mute, who has just garbage...
---
Obama’s still POTUS👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
---
Come^Back^Barack
---
I injured him by accident and received a ban also, no prior damage inflicted to him or team mates. Odd 
---
Tried to post this myself a couple minutes ago but didn’t know the sub doesn’t allow PSA in the title haha. 
---
Ah yes I’m sure that’s what you meant, and your first remark is definitely supposed to be critical
---
Ok I'm not going to respond to this thread anymore, you're clearly not in the best mood. Have a good day. 
---
Rainbow magic
---
HOLY JESUS!!!
---
i can't belive it
---
I feel so lucky, the one free pack they gave me and I got the Lords Headgear too. Less than a 6% chance for it and I got it. Now I don't have to spend any money on the packs.
---
Yeah well your the one who brought this about
---
I’m actually jealous of Pulse too to be honest.
---
Im a unicorn main and Im proud
---
They applied most of the game mechanics to new operators, most notably Nomads gadget.
---
Like Ratts stated though, it's a marketing strategy to bring new people to the game and also make a large amount of money through packs on short hand.  Money from the packs and game sales go back into further development of the game for DLC down the road. 
---
Is it possible to earn everything in this for free?
---
r/unexpectedoffice
---
I think there should be a PSA added into the flair pool considering the different type of posts now such as, News, esports, PSA, FYI, FAO, fan art, cosplay. 
---
Fuck no
---
Its a limitered time april fools mode
---
I means that’s exactly what you said. You don’t think it’s gambling despite the fact that you can spend money and get stuff you don’t want and has no value to you.
---
I don’t plan to buy them. I also don’t think something you don’t want is “something for your money”.
---
And countries are already banning them. Your examples aren’t the same either. Trading cards have value. Card you don’t want? Sell it or trade it (almost like it’s in the name).
---
Kinder Eggs? You don’t buy the eggs for the prize. And again you could trade it.
---
You really don’t seem to grasp what gambling is and that all gambling isn’t evil.
---
r/ihavesex
---
Be honest who would not bust a **FAT ONE** to this doki
---
Attack: Ash,Thermite,Maverick,Blackbeard
---
Defend: Pulse,Castle,Valkyrie,new def.
---
Who are the other 2 besides recruits?
---
What rule
---
I genuinely don’t understand what is happening 
---
I mean they're making a Rainbow Six movie with Michael Jordan, based on the book though
---
\*He's not here, is she?  
---
It's easy to miss that subtle joke about pyro's gender.
---
no, not even the boat bed
---
“It’s cute”
---
So black player skins are fine? K
---
Id love to play this but for some reason the game now freezes when loading a map :( 
---
I refer to him as “Kaid the Cat”
---
Tbh it was funny for me after wards because sometimes people say stuff like wow the random cost us that round single handedly. And in this case i did lose it for us by myself😂
---
Bartlett, Tower, Favela.
---
Yes please
---
Nope
---
I can imagine Mozzie going into a hard dive, convulsing a bit and Finka hits the nanos. Then Mozzie just puts a thumbs up into the air.
---
Favela, Chalet, Coastline
---
The only other place where I've seen this mysterious rectangle was on the forbidden land of Barlett.
---
They should do more set scenarios, like 1 different one a week or something.  With set ops, certain stipulations and different numbers of ops etc.
---
*I just got used to her recoil on acog*
---
Yep! Limited time tho, you gotta use mobile app i believe
---
I just grabbed my freebie pack and got the uniform for this.
---
I get it. I just buy them because I support Ubi.
---
where on the mobile app?
---
What do you mean ? This is a plane in kid’s room 
---
found it nevermind :p thanks

Idk about that since i haven't played much but my eyes are burning from all the colors 
---
New Zealand special forces 
---
Is it based on the Half Life intro?
---
i got into my first game as tachanka, looked at the hostage, put dont my turret and executed that furry degenerate.
---
then got banned for tk
---
Which is why it was actually good, since it wasn't predictable 
---
This reminds me of MW2 in the best ways.
---
Were you the guy who made the Withstand thing the other day?
---
Is that the inside of his mouth and his tongue or his mustache and mouth
---
Physiological warefare 
---
Well that caught me off guard
---
Ubi should let you download the gamemodes so other people dont have to download them. For example my friend and I could download this plane map and play together until we uninstall the map. Just a suggestion
---
Is this on the Technical Test Tserver?
---
How do I get a second one
---
Imagine shooting someone's head and then dying only to see a pink blackboard staring right at you
---
New hereford, fortress, villa
---
No..? It’s just kids room but smaller
---
NEIN
---
*OwO*
---
It’s so gay but I love it, I’m confused. 
---
Then why post it?
---
No we don't. Guarantee this subreddit is flooded with people crying about not being able to tell where the head is

For one I thought you were on prone

Sick wallpaper! Is it from trespasser?

For all maps: Favela, Tower and Themepark

For ranked maps: Themepark,Kafe and Fortress
