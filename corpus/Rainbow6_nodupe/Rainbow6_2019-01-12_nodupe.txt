I did that the other night on accident. Had been playing FO4 prior, and tried to crouch
---
Use illustrator instead. This is a waste of CAD. 
---
I've had this happen too many times
---
Idk about that one chief 
---
Same here I simple don't enjoy the game anymore and nothing feels rewarding. Its disappointing to see what Ubi is doing to the game. Every death feels like I had no control over and was unfair. Every kill feels like I out cheesed the enemy and he didn't deserve to die. Just the other night we lost because my game lost because my game broke and I was termite in consulate while the team was holding basement and didn't know how to bandit trick. I think you get the picture.
---

---
All in all I feel like I'm fight the game more then the enemy players. I no longer hold angles cause I get punished due to peekers advantage. I no longer roam because ubi has added ops like doki and nomand that allow players to counter roamers with no effort or skill. If they don't speak up or improve real soon this is will be last time I'm giving this game a chance. Lifes short and as much as I admire people that stick through thick and thin I would tell them it's just not worth it. You can be passionate for a game but don't give your life to it if it doesn't deserve your passion.

cons outweigh pros in this matter

What?  You shoulda bought it.

Hey im unbanned

One thousand times yes. And with that they can add Operation "speaking more with the community"

So you’re saying Ash is invincible than since she can’t lose any gun fights lol

This post is bum.  Why not have the lion scan go off while everyone is opening renown packs
---
I wish it was that simple, it works in all games, apps and everything else other than siege, I'm even on a fresh install on a new ssd and it still doesn't work, I don't think it's on my end.

Happy birthday mate
---
No, Im saying based on stats alone she will win gunfights, theres other things other than gunstats that matter, like hp and headshots and getting the jump, but her gun, in a fair 1v1, will always win
---
I don’t understand your question, it’s all one game is it not ? I’ve had it since Y1 and don’t even know what you mean

Thank you!

I didn't know that about laser sights... I've been playing the game for a few months now. That could explain a few odd moments of "how did he know i was there" 
---
Lesion
---
no, i was refering to the old one, check the link I added
---
Hands are too shaky my guy, it runs in the family 
---
Depends on what your playstyle is man, trap Operator you can’t go wrong with Frost/Lesion. If you prefer to roam around Lesion is still decent as he has impact grenades but I’d say Vigil is the superior roamer these days. Echo/ Mira typically stay anchored. Those are my top picks though if that helps at all lol 
---
You should give her infinite doc syringes that auto shoot her every 5 seconds
---
Yeah, sometimes I gain otherworldly skills when playing as recruit as a joke. Especially when I can get the whole team to do it. Skills never last more than a round though.
---
Thats how i thought it was when i first learned about lion
---
That's good like
---
Laser Sights are only useful when running handguns, Maestro's Alda 556 and shotguns.
---
 me thinks you might be the one that got wooshed here but then again...
---
Fbi gets the five seven and that things mag is ridiculously big and no recoil. Combine that with a 2 speed shield and its pretty competitive.
---
idk, i feel cheated. i could've gotten the dlc ops first and waited another few months before getting the rest for free.
---
They're going to rework him and hopefully BB is next
---
I know I know, its been the same with every Christmas skins apart from the blue one
---
Just let me add you dont see flashes in killcams, so she probably was blinded and landed a lucky shot on you while your shield was desynced.
---
“Ouch, I’m stupid”
---
Or it just makes sound
---
They better not change anything with his damage for his weapons. I will never touch lion if they fuck him up like they did Ela
---
Good idea but i feel it would also make it under powered as you don't know how many are in a room so maybe make like three throwables but they are 2.5 seconds and start on contact and the field of view is smaller
---
2x R6S World Champion lol

and flash immunity!
---
Why does his mouthpiece look like he's doing a weeb face?
---
What key would it be bound to? Also there are no more inputs available on console controllers.
---
So you're trying to tell me that 2 years ago consoles had the capability to save high quality clips and yet we still see people uploading cellphone clips of their TV?

Yup.
---
You mean thermite mains with a season pass
---
These seem like good changes. I like Nomad a lot but these would be good QoL changes for both sides. She doesn’t need a nerf per say but her airjab could use a bit more consistency 
---
Lol yeap
---
I've seen them do that before
---
Shoot bad people
---
This Israeli controversy is dumb, Israeli operators would be perfect for this game, politics has not play in r6 so Ubisoft shouldn’t worry about it
---
Preparation phase: Coastline. You know if you know.
---
I am having such a glitchy season.  This has been one of the least pleasurable seasons in general.   Crouch spamming, jiggle peeking, cancer meta in full bloom at plat 1 and above.  Then we come to actual glitches.  Spawn in not as my character but as a drone with a greyed out screen.  I can move in game but only see that one still shot of usually a location outside with my hud overlayed (has happened on defense and offense).  The audio reverse glitch where I do something on my drone and for some reason my audio is reversed all of a sudden front is back, left is right and vice versa.  For this I need to reboot the game entirely, sometimes even the pc/Xbox. Audio is crap in general even without glitches.  Getting snuck up on by a monty because there is no audio from behind you is terrible.  Hit reg is only getting worse.  
---
And worst of alllllllll.  They don't communicate to us at all that they care about any of this.  I would be fine if I got some communication.  Because either way it would inform me of what to expect.  But they say nothing, and more often than not, do absolutely fucking nothing. 
---
In the end.  We need the big people in the community to step up.  We need pro league teams to speak out about the decline of the game.  We need youtubers to stop making click bait for a second and switch to another game for a few weeks. The same goes for streamers.  Because Ubi doesn't care about you or me, but they care about the players that make them money. Everyone has to suffer a bit to get them to notice that this is no longer acceptable. 
---
Totally agree with you
---
Except it doesn't. They can just stand still for 5 seconds, and they are given a warning to get to a good spot.
---
Bullshit, I used to play with 130 ping until I fixed my router and it was a nightmare. If someone with 9 ping starts shooting at the same time as a 130 ping player, the lower ping will win always.

Yeah, but hitting Blitz's arm in console is a lot harder 
---
Why do you want to document it?
---
You can blame u/Torbajorno for that.
---
Some docs cant aim shoot where they are going to be bro it's not that hard 
---
Red Crow was one of the buggiest DLC releases in the game, people are just looking backwards with nostalgia tinted glasses. 
---
Operation Para Bellum was the latest good DLC release, good map, well balanced operators and a fairly stable game bug wise.
---
Wow dude thanks a lot. 
---
But it really isn't, they can still peak and get you without a significant disadvantage. They will have shot you by the time you see the red outline appear.
---
Hell, they don't even have to move if they're already watching a corner.
---
You will get banned for like 15 days but will have the credits

more earlier is the TTS though

Thanks for giving me a new hiding spot 
---
Oh wow look two ranks ill never see
---
Ubi, ubi clearly states that any credits purchase not through them is illegal in their eyes. Since you are getting a “premium “ content without paying them anything
---
It's actually great idea :) 
---
Reinstall it. 
---
nvm lol
---
Lmao
---
That’s the thing I’m wondering, on kill cam person saw only my backpack and even they were wondering how I died
---
Super simple solution.  Give us one or two seasons of operation health 2.0.  While also giving ranked rules to casual and pro league rules to ranked.  Done.  You are welcome. 
---
I should clarify; on Rainbow, if my in-game ping is 20 (which is where I average), and go up to 40-60, I don't notice a massive difference.
---
In Overwatch, I average around 40, but if I go up to even 50, then the lagg is immediately noticeable and I can feel myself teleporting all over the place in-game.
---
In both cases, I'm referring to where I have a quick (or sometimes, not so quick) spike in my own connection - which I monitor using TeamSpeak. Just an observation though.
---
Actually the Thermite charge detonating created a shockwave that changed the direction of the bullet, curving it around the truck. Weren't you watching?

Tats why u thinks he isn't game breaking. During dying seconds of the round or if they have cleared out all roamers and are closing in on site he is very powerful and the defenders can't do much

I agree with you man. Sometimes I wonder why do people hack and why do people like to tk?

You just need to practice.

Best would be picking blitz and Monty, or picking DMRs and playing them a lot. The more you rush, the more likely are you to *spam that finger*, and end up improving.

Guns are a bit f a factor. 50 round drum mag for Lion (51 with 1 in the chamber) in his V308. I know Jackal's PDW9 has a 50 round drum but the damage is different and the recoil is different.  
---
The feet sniffer
---
That's not an okay thing to post, let alone type. 
---
I can smell the bronze rank from here
---
Welcome to the most toxic community in the world bud. All I can say is, if you really want to play, watch youtube videos first. Play a lot of terrorist hunt. And venture into casual after you have some map knowledge and core gun mechanics down. Basically anyone with a bit of know how is going to spectate you and immiedietely know if you have any clue what you're doing. That's why you get vote kicked. 
---
Yet im diamond, you?
---
Jackal gets a sidearm shotgun though, which has great utility. 
---
Could this be due to the recent windows update? 
---
I have Stereo headphones, that weird virtualisation forstereo headphones option in Audio Settings on Windows was turned off by the update for some reason, meaning I can’t hear shit directly behind me.

Yeah thats fair, like i said different games handle it in different ways. Destiny 1 when it first came out was horrible for that shit. Your internet just stutter?

That twitch was probably like "OMG OMG GUYS YOU WONT BELIEVE THIS
---
In bomb and higher levels of play he is unbearably op. With a 5 stack he’s game breaking. In upper golds and maybe even plats (never got to plat so I can’t say for sure, but NA gold I can comment about), when we run a lion on attack with smokes, we always get the plant down. Only other 5 stack enemy teams that often have better gun skills can take us on, and that just shows how lion was designed for the either solo, or lower ranked player base. I don’t deserve to belong in upper gold territory. I’ve had the game for only 3 seasons total, and siege is my first competitive game. The fact that me and my squad can get that high up by doing the same thing over and over and loosing only to people who are actually more skilled is a sign of how unbalanced and broken he is. 
---
Hahahahahahah sick reference man
---
Please find out for us.

MacieJay, Beaulo, VarsityGaming, and any Pro player/Diamond player.

Don't watch Get_Flanked, he may seem good, but there's a reason he's not a Diamond. 
---
Only watch the top people. 
---
Idk, Rocket League is pretty toxic..
---
Either way, OP, just keep trying. When you start playing more, you'll learn the maps better and be able to coordinate things. I would also find an operator you enjoy playing and sticking with them for a bit so you can get good with that op and learn from there. Once you feel comfortable, start experimenting with other ops!
---
Was ur flair made before they removed the ability to type custom flairs?
---
You don't get it buddy
---
in what regards?
---
No she's not. The recoil is aids and I want my impacts back. If took can have them. Ela can have them
---
I don't know what ops you're taking about.
---
You get rushed if u plan right. Most of the time when they use lilns ability, they are some what far from u
---
They just play like coppers, like ive never had a frnch player in my game that actually takes responsibility or communicates, and if you join a french persons party they always kick you for speaking English the most common language, just seems like french people are just generally not good at games.
---
get mira, huge gamechanger
---
Copper.
---
What the fuck did I just witness 
---
I mis worded that. I meant if u don't want to get rushed than hold a peek, 5 secs is just enough time.
---
Its more of a feel thing for me than stats and attachments for me personally, unless the gun is wildly regarded as very good such as the R4-C. For example I think one of the best guns in the game for me is the MP7, not necessarily based on stats or firerate, but off feel and how i can use it, ergo theres alot of bandit hours. Also acogs arent everything, about 40% to half the time i use an acog im always in a situation where a holo or reflex wouldve done me better, with sight and recoil.
---
Lmao. I have another clip where my party was just fucking with our solo teammate so we just killed him and started tbagging. He didn’t get mad though and just laughed it off. Pretty fun shit happened during early Rainbow. 
---
Oh come on we have nanomachines son I think we could do the 🐝 
---
Copper. That should answer most of them.
---
Forget the bees, I’ve always wanted an op that can release venomous snakes through drone holes
---
it’s fun in moderation
---
This is not what I expected clicking the title.
---
He doesn't need to take any risks, and by the press of a button gives every single attacker a huge advantage anywhere on the map.
---
In a site push or when clearing roamers with any sort of coordination Lion and his teammates will kill you most of the time.
---
Fun story: The captain of G2, the best team in r6 right now, once had his monitor stop working in the middle of a prac. His team was in a 4v5 and he was playing Lion. Even with no monitor he was able to help his team get 3 kills and easily win the round. How much skill does that take?
---
they are extremely strong in close quarters and thats how they should be

This. I didn't know I needed this.
---
But like how 
---
If you can't play with that recoil play the shotgun, its insanely good. Otherwise learn how to use her smg, tap fire at long range and spray at close range. She is meant to be a close range fragger and is very good at that.
---
I've never ever had a problem with lion. Im not even a main. I've used him only to create a How 2 Lion montage, and my videos are trash. The point is, lion isn't unbalanced. 
---
This made me want to throw something by watching it. Good job tho I guess... but f blitz 😂
---
Defender gadget: cans on strings
---
How about snakes with wings and stingers that inject nanomachines son
---
i mean in the traditionally in siege, the french have represented about a third to half of the pro scene, you can't really say they are bad at games.
---
That said though it is true their english usually sucks so it is hard to communicate, but from what I've heard the french community is one of the most competitive in r6 and is the second biggest playerbase by country
---
Sounds about right. 
---
Silver isn’t to great either but it’s not toxic, but you wont have a good time. 
---
Lider's icon is basically Mira's icon flipped on the side... Ubisoft would be more creative.
---
I totally forgot that those existed. I wish it had stayed that way
---
That was because he was doing a gold three spawnpeek they saw (insert youtuber) doing 100 months ago.  Nice shot though.
---
For everyone who misunderstands, he means kick people from the menu party, not in game team. Its worded wrong but yeah. 
---
Again, a larger percentage of French players leads to larger percentage of potential toxicity. 
---
yeah i am

you can just post in the LFG pc and ask for a 10 man

I love seeing shit like this. The enemie sees you but without you aiming or acting aggressive and not firing a single shot it felt natural for you to be there as if you were a teammate. Im sure if you shot one the rest would have probably mowed you down.

Nah that is too restrictive. What happens when a few of the squad get plat while the others are a game or two off it? They just stop playing together? 
---
siege is literally unplayable
---
Ahhh the good old days.

That would be insanely difficult for attackers

I think it's mostly because you havent yet put in the time in this game. The more you play it and start to love the game, the more you'll notice bullshit things that really push your buttons. You may also have been really lucky because it's insane how you havent gotten toxic teammates since you solo queue. Guess the stars aligned for you my guy. Enjoy it while you do

blitz is a 2 speed operator with a penalty to his speed from his shield (its a double penalty compared to other shield ops, 20% compared to 10%) so hes 1.8x speed, not 2.5x

But then we get posts every day saying how bad operation health 2 is. We know it's a good thing, but the masses might not and heck even we might lose interest even if we backed it up.
---
This happened to us as well.  One person left after getting aced and then everyone spiked to 5000+ ping and it crashed.  No points changed but it was annoying because they were getting cold clapped. 
---
I did this to ela the other day on kanal she fell 3 floors I loved it 
---
I’d smash

Fair enough.

ubi is just trying to get a few early sales then they know the second the first leaks by dr.dumper that has a phd in dumping game clients release the sales are gonna get better
---
Not quite sure what I’m supposed to be seeing 
---
It's hard to imagine a real operation health, considering the last one they did had no real effect...  I'd be okay with it in theory of course but the execution is just way off.  They still owe us a Polish map instead of another rework or update to an older one.
---
If they do indeed do another operation health they need to give us another renown care package (that actually works day 1) or a ton of alpha packs to make up for the lack of.... anything.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We need to bring back the ninja defuse
---
How reliable??
---
A hostage-style mode, where instead of a living human, it is something similar, but unkillable. The big problem with hostage is that the target can be killed, which makes it extremely annoying on both teams. That being said, it does allow for 'post plant' for the other team without the annoyingly short rush or awkward 'contested' that secure area does. At this point, many spawning locations and such would probably need to be adjusted slightly to prevent suicidal drops out of windows right beside the objective room (since the target is no longer killable), however I think it'd be quite the interesting adaptation due to the attackers requiring a greater distance to push into an objective to secure the target compared to the current meta of pixel planting on the edge of an obj.
---
The fact you have no sight on vigils gun disgusts me

---
Gridlocks icon should be just like jäger but RED. His device looks just like that if im not wrong
---
Because people still did pay for the op and those that did that love him will bust a god damn tip. And this isn’t exactly about catering to pro players its was to making the game more interesting because pretty much game had lion banned. Dude had a 200% ban ranked. 
---
I don't want them to be easier for the sake of montages, just cause the hitbox of it is wonky so I rarely attempt, but I definitely see what you're saying in that it is more rewarding when you collect the few times you actually do pull it off!
---
lol console bad reeee
---
I feel that TK/FF is actually an important aspect in this game. From the tactical point of view.
---
Not a great effort at a joke.
---
Maestro is better. 
---
Ela's gun is just too much randomness at this moment and I don't believe anything will be done unless it shows sign of low pick rate, people still play her due to her 3 speed.
---
I thought the party leader could do that. Pretty sure I used it a few times when someone's "only getting a drink"
---
Personally I would get both, SSD have higher read/write speeds than hard drives, meaning you can install windows on it and it will make your system feel even faster.
---
Did this for ps4 worked fine, no ban nothing. 
---
Smoke grenades would be nice
---
I agree with the above guy. I have a g502 which has 11 buttons or something like that but I only use the two side buttons for leaning. And I understand the default keyboard layout being a bit of a pain but don’t forget you can remap the keys. 
---
Its literally in-game footage, what more do you need?
---
Heavens forbid ubisoft make any money from this game!
---
The sights are meant to be balanced in a particular way. Reflex has less housing but is less accurate due to being a triangle where you aim with the point. Holographic has more housing but has a smaller centre dot to be more precise. The red dot is a bit odd because it is a larger dot so it is less accurate than the holographic but has more housing, so I assume ubi believes it to be more accurate. The acog has 2x zoom but huge housing and you have to aim with the arrow tip. If you could swap stuff around, you could just use a holographic reticle with a reflex housing, making it both precise and clear to see. 
---
Nope no idea that existed until it was too late because they advertise the game instead of the starters addition 
---
They should have a command thing similar to what they have in CSGO and TF2. Helps when people don’t have mics.
---
Don’t forget being able to ping things while droning, don’t even get me started lol
---
it's awesome, bro.
---
That goddamn spooky bitch
---
I’m going to upload other leaks Tomorrow.
---
Unfortunately no elite was found, 
---
I KNEW it wasn't me being really stupid or something when I'd hear footsteps what sounded like a floor above me and it turns out the guys making his way through a door or hallway next too me and I just get popped in the head LMAO
---
For a game that relies so much on hearing footsteps and gadgets it sure is fucked that you get misled because the direction and source of sounds is just wrong for most things.
---
Explanation? Reasons? No?
---
Hell yes, I'd give up 3 seasons if they fixed their bloody game.

I'm not a copper player but I imagine copper players don't know hiding spots let alone know how to move so smoothly throughout the game. Dont play dumb, this person either deranked to copper to get this clip, or they happened to do it in a match outside of ranked copper and just put that as the title.
---
There you go
---
It simply does not compare to drop shotting. The difference is huge. Its the difference between dipping their head and putting it all the way on the floor. Also your targets shape changes massively when you lie down. Crouching simply does not have this major of an effect. You've asserted that its unfair and somehow takes strategy out of the game but you've given no explanation as to how.
---
vreddit doesnt buffer or take 2 seconds to load
---
Thanks, will look into it!
---
They have more important limited time alpha packs to work on.
---
No
---
Almost every single attacker gun is better than defender guns. Although Ash's gun is very good, there is nothing "unfair" about it. 
---
Why is jackal's gun not unfair? it has better stats and less recoil? What about the F2?
---
I don't know
---
I think the system could be fixed by creating a vote only for the tk'd one who will say either "yes" or "no"and after two yes you get kicked. I pkay without the model outline and just yesterday almost got killed because an enemy in the next room had the caveira interrogation class overhaul (literally like the teammates) and I hesitated to shoot.
---
You are terrible at this game and I'm gonna stop this conversation, cuz the best way to get a stupid person to shut up is to agree with them.
---
Your two posts are on top of each other in my feed and I got REAL confused

Discord light mode. Down voted.

Reminds me of ninja defusing when i played cod4 and mw2

He's only overpowered if you have no coordination and your sound is off.

Just shoot him from far away, or have two team mates in the same room at slightly different angles, or use barbed wire or c4.

Had a warmup t-hunt round and sound was literally inverted , I was so confused

But how should other people be allowed to vote to say whether a tk was malicious or not? They might not have seen it and they certainly didn’t see the kill cam 
---
Strange. I have an i5 and 1060 and I can get mine to 144 hz just fine.
---
Putting it extremely simply, you are using features of the game in ways they were not intended to be used to make yourself harder to hit.
---
In a game where positioning, prediction and timing is everything, if you walk around ducking and weaving at the speed of light, it removes all of that. 
---
Crouch spamming has no place in a game like siege. 
---
You my friend , have true friends cherish them . 
---
By adding a flair. It'll be on the right if you're on pc and it'll be the 3 dots on the sub Reddit page if you're on mobile.
---
Not playing dumb. This video tells us nothing really. My friend knows all the hot spots but is absolutely garbage cause he cant shoot for shit. I've made it to Plat each season but been as low as Silver when Solo Que, so I could see a decent player hitting Copper.
---
Also again... this likely isnt actually Copper either. Its just a tease at awful awareness.
---
But sadly, the community is toxic. So the only thing Ubisoft can do is actually take action, because the way I see it the community isn't getting any less toxic, unfortunately.
---
record, report. https://support.ubi.com/en-US
---
also you can try to switch to a region that's not so popular
---
I find it rather bizzare that the main sub of the game doesn't allow so many things posted. Strats ? go to /r/siegeacademy or /r/rainbowsixstrategies anoying bugs that don't get fixed for extended periods of times? /r/rainbowsixtts memes? /r/rainbowsixmemes . Exciting pro league matches ? /r/R6ProLeague . What the hell can you even post in this sub after that ? Art and shitty clips combined with some meme montages are all thats left. And people complain even for those. 
---
I can agree on that she is a great place it’s just the fact that droning basically makes her gadget obsolete. Too many games have I drones and spotted all three holograms and been able to pick out the real one
---
Rank means nothing in this game anymore my dude.
---
As long as you’re learning, improving and enjoying yourself, that’s all that matters. 
---
it's from the paris major I believe, but not the twitch "diamond" or whatever people are saying. it's either the one they gave out to the people that went to the event, or the pro league players that played in it
---
They have an operator that's literally only to possible to play if you are rushing... Ubi pls
---
RUN OUT BAD
---
The ‘alibi trick’ is the exception, not the rule.
---
If people used alibi for more creative reasons than to simply be a hologram themselves, they’d learn that she’s extremely viable.
---
Here’s a tip from an alibi main, keep a hologram on you. So that if you’re in a firefight and need to run back, you can place a hologram and run.
---
Saves you a bit of time. 
---
Watch the video and you'll understand. There are two different vaults you need to do
---
 
---
most people I know and most pro league players have 400 or 800 dpi
---
1k DPI, high sensitivity
---
The only legendary I got from the alpha pack was the troublemaker charm
---
Well you crouch spammed so there’s not much credibility there. 
---
You have a straight line maker
---
I spend way too much time in ms paint
---
most pros in a lot of games i play, play at low DPI. I was more wondering what your personally played at?
---
really depends if you think you are good to be in that rank, because rank can sometimes for the most part mean absolutely nothing. just know the majority of people are high silver/low gold
---
This is definitely a problem.  The matchmaking makes no sense sometimes.  I had 3 plat 3s and 2 gold 1s on my team today.  The other team had 3 diamonds and 2 plats.  They all had 150+ ping too, but werec playing flawlessly.  Makes absolutely no sense to be matched up against this team. Not only that but they were blatantly cheating as well.
---
It’s a part of the game, ask ubi to remove it. Instead of hating onto the crouch spammers. If there are certain things available in siege, then obvio people will use it for their advantage. ❤️
---
Console aiming is always fun
---
I play on Xbox (don't @ me okay, I get enough crap for owning one), and because I am gaming impaired, went into the scary world of Copper. It's a bottomless pit of toxicity, and stupid plays like this happen often.
---
 At one point I gave up ranked for a bit until it was reset time, so I could go back to gold where everyone is still retarded and toxic, just less so.
---
No diamond is the only rank that is good for first season
---
SEE THIS IS WHY WE NEED OP HEALTH 2.0 ^^^/s

If Maestro's cams become easily destructible they are pointless. At least Yokai drones can run away and they hide on ceilings. I get that pros often ban him because his cams are a pain to deal with but allowing even more ops to break them would slip him into irrelevance. There's a fine line between being a REALLY good operator and a crappy one. Ex. If Mira's window was a two-way window. Or if all she did was make a killhole window.
---
Alibi pings last for like 1.5 seconds. It essentially does just reveal your position.
---
I get what you're trying to do but you can do that for EVERY op. 
---
- Is it not enough that Doc's pistol heals? Why does it have to be 40!
---
- Is it not enough that Zofia's lifeline makes a hole? Why does it have to be big enough to vault through?
---
- Why does Jager get to stop up to 6 throwables? Is it not enough to stop just 1 per ADS?
---
But why? 
---
NeW oPeRaToR lEaK
---
Can confirm, Raytoro is the man when it comes to leaks!
---
 playing in copper 4 be like XD
---
Only way that comes to mind is if they switch his hammer so maybe if you hold it out for a second he keeps it out like other OP's gadgets instead of swinging it and putting it away once you release, at which point you could sprint with it out and swing it with the melee and/or fire button.
---
No lol possible on Pc aswell.
---
shields &lt; 
---
Unfortunately not, I've been playing other non Shooter games really such as dead cells, rocket league, rimworld and did a whole half life story play through, nothing quite feels like siege and gets the blood pumping. If you find something then let me know. 
---
That should be an outfit
---
You sure about that? i see this sometimes on pc casual and tons of clips aswell on PS. It’s 2019. Stop crying about console’s already
---
The idea is cool but a bit to complexe to set up just made it a kill some one and loot him 
---
Honestly did not know that Jaeger's ADS has a limit to the number of grenades it will shoot down.
---
Also people die very, very quickly in this game. If Doc's pistol healed for like 25, no one would ever pick Doc.

I love your art style! Would you consider drawing other ops? (If you haven't already?)
---
I’m not going to bother reading your essay because you clearly have the temperament of a child. Besides, your so-called arguments are full of contradictions and inconsistencies.
---
The one on nuuvem says it's unavailable?

Capitao is basically already the "Molotov" op
---
Thanks! I'm thinking of doing a few other ops in this style. Not sure exactly who I'm gonna do next, though.
---
Idk you are talking for what? Maybe 0.0001% of the community where the elo of friends is dia and the other real copper. Im coming from the boosting community and like every second high elo player gor a copper 4 account and boosts people. I would even say 30-40% of the dia players are boosted. But go downvote me and the problem will never be solved. 
---
Hey guys, i'm new to reddit and I was wondering how you post a clip like this on here? I got a clip that I posted but all it shows is the link instead of a video like this. 
---
Yes but it would give u more choices and especially when covering ur back u have to fight rommers wich are 3 speed and with the one shot potential it would be better and when the operator also gets an good gadget to have something else it would be okay 
---
Started edition was never free what do you mean? If it was I would have heard of it cus I loved the game and wasn't able to afford a year ago
---
Great job on the leaks! Do you know if they are like elite uniforms and can't mix n match the outfit or are they like regular uniforms? 
---
U definitely don't have to worry 
---
Yw
---
Being a squeaker this feels so real rn.
---
I like angled tho smh
---
That doesn't make sense at all
---
Well I got the standard edition free a year ago, maybe it was on a second party site where they sometime give away games
---
Ubisoft never gave this game for free so it's anywhere else but ubisoft
---
Yeppp the sounds are horrid now. I keep getting the same problem every 4 or so games where the sounds cut out and seem distant or non existent, only able to hear background ambient noises..really annoying and makes ranked impossible
---
I think I was in that game.
---
oh no don't get me wrong I would never recommend my dpi as it was pain and suffering to get used to the fact that if you breath too hard or cough you are now looking behind you. but after the last year its now comfortable. the only reason my one friend plays at 4k dpi as well is because he felt bad that I had to get used to it so he decided to struggle with me as good friends do. but the reason I made this post is to see where everyone falls in not just high preforming players. also sorry if I sounded rude in my post I don't mean to so I apologize.
---
you said, 'well are not you are a dick head'
---
Two evils battling it out
---
I've a classmate right? We always like to joke around in the game and do meme strats. I'm sick of needing to play the game seriously and do my best all the time, ranked makes me hate doing that. I use casual as a way to chill after ranked because some people really like to take everything in this game seriously it just infuriates me.
---
Just contact ubi, give them the recite, and let them deal with it.
---
Let's play a game called "spot the copper"
---
Actually I said "dick wad" but i felt dick head was better
---
You chose to wait this long 
---
i heard tarkov is a prettty good substitute, nothing is quite like siege though.
---
Calm hand, not like me gosh
---
What if you're a 2-man plat and copper? The other three teammates will be at a major disadvantage at a 4v5 which isn't really fair on them, which really isn't fair for them. If you want to play with lower ranked friends, do it in casual.
---
Nope. He doesn't need a buff. He's a very potent defender already.
---
How many times will this be posted?
---
Didn’t TK anyone
---
She could approach you from any side. Some even do it to fake the killcam.
---
I don’t think Vigil needs a buff. His ability can waste a few precious second when used correctly, and his SMG can reach a 34 damage breakpoint, which is rare among defender weapons. 
---
The t hunt thing is mainly just to learn the maps as OP is worried about being kicked every game now. Cant play casual if you're just getting kicked all the time mate ;)
---
I would focus on the sensor which is the most important thing in a mouse not the brand.

---
It's broken when you use controller.
---
Man. Good old times, when she was the goddess of Siege. I loved and hated it :D 
---
Honestly, sound is absolute crap in siege. So 7.1 isnt really helping in reality. Sound always comes from the nearest door or cracked window or open area around you. 
---
Glaz was preparing for the shot before you teleported. Yeah these were definitely cheaters. There's no way that's coincidence
---
I believe Luison down automatically rotates you to the right direction 
---
Another counter, if you're flashed or not and hes literally infront of you, knife his shield to open his shield, and spray.  
---
It's kind of like parrying his shield to open his body
---
Valkyrie
---
So is tha profile deleted or banned forever? Or is it temporary?
---
People were reluctant for him to have a buff before because he basically had 2 primary weapons (smg-12) and it had no recoil, he was almost op, however now it’s just his K1A which is good but it’s just one good and the ability to kind of hide (static bars) I feel now that he only has his primary and heavily nerfed smg-12 he should be able to hide from lion.

Somebody already drank the fourth can, they were thirsty.
---
For the other team IG
---
Not really, this isn't COD or Battlefield. Not to knock those games but the one shot headshot mechanic means you pretty much have to always be ready for a gunfight.
---
Anytime you actually think there maybe someone in a room or around a corner you should ADS the second you think that and push ADSing and aiming where you think they will be.
---
Angled can potentially help when caught be surprise which can happen but the idea is to not allow that to happen and the better you get the less it should happen so the angled grip becomes less and less useful the more you learn.

Frost is pretty good on most objectives and there is a few tricks to learn to make her traps more effective. Capitao is harder to master and more situational, he is very useful when you attack a site that directly leads to the outside his goal is to support by coverwith smokes, suppressing fire and entry denial

---
Shields op on consol but not on pc, u cant do something like that at all, u would die directly while u breaching the wall
---
yeah, after all the nerfs ubi thought "hey lets make her a defender so she can use her weapons on defends, this should buff her again"
---
Its the rapture.

Thank you for your input

ill play ranked when Ubisoft gives my all the skins and r6 credits im owed from all the season passes. but im not that beat up as in casual people don't get upset if you don't follow their commands to the letter. so its a more enjoyable experience for me
---
R4-C is still prevalent because you only need 38 damage to destroy 70% of existing defenders with 3 shots. R4-C is stong not necessarily because it’s firerate is high, but rather because it’s damage is *not low enough.*

Thanks

"If lion activates his ability, just stand still" some roamers just dont care, rook mains are too sensitive anyway
---
I would use it on defenders for my roamers, and just guns that are easy to control on attackers. If you often get caught off guard, angled helps quickly align those headshots if your position is somewhat safe
---
Sure man! FeelsGudYeah.

K1A but Elas FO-12 has the coolest reload.

I play I need help
---
On Xbox
---
This Bag old as dinosaur shit
---
I personally prefer the Scar because if it's fire rate being faster than I can click, and I also click pretty fast. If you are good at hitting headshots it really just depends on what you like.
---
Am just here waiting for link as well 
---
It would be pretty hard to dung well with something covering your mouth d:
---
Maybe I have the Safari bundle so probably
---
one reason : ***D A T A     L I M I T S***
---
Breaken downed
---
Wtf? That Tachanka bundle looks good! 
---
I just get lucky headshots
---
Depends on how long u play fpses for
---
God damn Ubi pls bring back old rank icon's pls
---
Sadly, you're only gonna be in for more of that. Ranked just tends to be a fucking mess like that. Also, sometimes people are gonna get *too* competitive, so be wary of that too
---
ANOTHER post like this?!?! Dude how many times are people going to mindlessly upvote the same fuckin post over and over again?? 
---
of course the lord is the Thiccest of them all 
---
posted already , too late my friend
---
RIP cool shotgun pose :'(   
---
I am going to try with an updated geforce version now and also without the virus protection to see if it works.
---
Skins are skins... 
---
I'm all for being a "Veteran player" 
---
I've had the game since Feb 2016
---
But I think Ubi should give players a chance to get old skins.
---
Just make it fun and a bit of a challenge. 
---
Should add strings of challenges that a player has to complete to then be able to select a skin or something. 
---
Let players earn the skin.
---
Yea Blackbeard is pretty solid too, that shield is insane. Twitch was always a favorite of mine too. And I can’t lie, bandit, Frost, and mute are my favorite defenders. I actually like the classic characters. Vigil is fun to use also. 
---
It’s in beta cause the experience keeps on changing. As they release new operators it affects the whole game. Meta is constantly changing. 
---
Jackal with angled is hilarious
---
No its the other way around for me and then when i dont sweat my nuts off in casual i get called carried because im dianond.
---
No they didnt... many special force are modeled on the SAS. 
---
If you get the gold edition I believe you get the good skin automatically.
---
I'd prefer full auto and bigger mag on the bosg instead
---
What does not kill us makes us stronger
---
That would be op.  When it first came out it kept the same amount of damage at all ranges and it was completely broken and had to be nerfed.
---
Jäger over there crying and remembering the good old ACOG times
---
Uh....
---
Centering time is the time it takes for your barrel to return to the center of the screen after firing a burst
---
Diamond is how tight the grouping of each bullet is (ie vertical and horizontal variance of each shot)
---
How did they not see/hit you? They must be really bad at counter spawnpeaks
---
Same lmao
---
The in game description isn't accurate in telling you all the benefits of each option
---
Anyone have the link to the other version of this? I believe it was a Japanese one with a Mute vigorously lean spamming while crouched?
---
not really, because the adapters they use emulate a controller. the console recognizes it as a wired controller, and changing the software could eliminate the use of wired controllers all together. it's a shitty situation
---
Because that’s impractical, extended barrels in real life reduce the falloff of effectiveness in long distance combat, and ubi prides itself in the “realism” they try to stay true to. It’s also certainly a useful attachment. If you don’t have issues with recoil on the guns it’s on I recommend using it as it’s great for some defenders 
---
Thunt + villa + spawn always in fountain . and rush as fast as you can with a friend
---
Pretty good. I was Bronze when I started and was amazed when I reached silver 4. Find some friends and the game will be more enjoyable. 
---
This is literally my favorite seasonal skin, same with all the other blood orchid seasonals except the arcade one, but unfortunately i bought diamond camo that season instead of any seasonal skins.  Im extremely disappointed.
---
And?
---
I see Ash is the best cosplay there. Solely for the fact they found an appropriately sized gun to match her ingame hit box.
---
What's the lil fellas name?
---
Haha, luckily I only need about 4 hours' sleep per night to function.
---
I have a really slow sens; same as Kix but my ADS is 83.
---
Stan
---
Understandable. Have a nice day.
---
Just melee him man
---
Probably just some piece of shit diamonds using golds to get into lower ranks. Fuck guys like that.
---
I'm too old for that now! 
---
Cav is holding the pistol &amp; knife like Big Boss. So proud of her
---
The matchmaking in this game needs serious work but instead of working on it they just hide ranks so you can't see you're team is at an obvious disadvantage.
---
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. 
---
Sometimes I go literally 12-0 in casual, but the other half the time in casual I lose with 0 kills and to 1-3. And I personally get absolutely stomped in ranked, no matter the rank. Recently had a huge loss streak that brought be from high silver to low bronze. Haven't played ranked since then because I'm fuckin cursed.
---
Git gud
---
Did stan find your secret stash? Because stan looks fucking high 
---
Honestly whats the point of hiding your teammates rank.. Have to go on fucking r6s tracker and find there rank.. and majority of the time its Copper or Bronze.
---
They are on console, its a lot harder
---
Oh I totally agree, I don’t actually use impacts at all but getting taken down to 40hp from a single one is just something I think is unnecessary. Could be just because I play blitz often and that seems to be something I run into a lot but I just don’t think they need to do that much 
---
You’d think so, but that’s just Stan.
---
Never change Stan...never change~
---
I'm sorry you're too jaded to believe that theres a few people out there who   aren't too full of themselves that they're too high and mighty to help new players. You're probably what's wrong with the community and you're probably among the most toxic. 
---
Someone hasn't been in copper before.
---
My buddy ranked there last season and I tried to help him get out (and hopefully pick easy wins since I was gold at the time). Anyways, it turns out a lot of people in copper aren't just bad players, they keep a lot of the teamkilling griefers, and teammates that havent heard of headsets down there. It's hard to escape without a good team, and if you have that team you usually dont place there.

Operators themselfes dont have hard counters, their abilities do.
---
Blitz's ability is his shield flash which has 2 counters:
---
* Mute disables it
---
* Has a small/medium range
---
Wow really? Im toxic because i think people should stay in their rank catogory?
---
That would be perfectly legal if it wasn't for it glitching to see into the elevator. Exploit for sure. 
---
Similar spot works to same effect to see all of the CEO sites
---
Overall I agree with you. I had the fortune to start with a full group of already experienced (lv 100+) friends, but some people can be really toxic. The penalties for toxicity should be much harsher than they are now. Just one pet peeve - it is paid not payed ([https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paid-payed/](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paid-payed/)) :P
---
Rip your ace
---
I’ll use it 
---
That's because as a shield, you're playing a defensive operator which is much more vulnerable to explosives. Imagine trying to impact nade an Ash or Twitch who has a full auto. 
---
I don't get it
---
Jesus Christ this community is awful
---
From what I've learned report toxic behavior only concerns text/voice chat.
---
Baffling how much this game lacks.
---
Damn, this game's monetization is ridiculous. I have the starter edition and it's taken me almost 200 hours of play to unlock six or so dlc ops, five of which were on sale. I feel for you man, this part of the game sucks ass. 
---
Haha, I do okay.  TBH, I think skill mostly plateaus after about 1,000 hours - or sooner if you have extensive FPS experience.
---
Hmmm that is very much true, except for Maverick and ubis poor excuse for bullets being a counter haha
---
Nice, hope you like them as much as I do.
---
Cav dressed by a guy
---
Good lord, that's too bad that you're that unlucky. I play for a few hours each night with a friend or two and I get 1 or 2 alpha packs a night. More or less sometimes with luck.
---
not a solution
---
I just look for feet under the door. He doesn't need a buff at all. 
---
In that case you just need to wait until Ubi replies.
---
Got shot yesterday in Villa basement, Glaz had meleed the outside door, all I could see was his torso, but on his screen he was looking at me though the board above the one that was broken for me.  So I hit his chest, he hit my head.
---
Client-sided debris is bad enough, but adding bad debris physics on top of it is rage-inducing.

That’s a huge deal

My only issue is that the shoulders seem a little to short for her head.

Oh this exploit happens when multiple people spray a soft wall there an easy fix just change the shadows in the settings and it should be fixed but you have to do it every time it happens

actually, now that I look closer, I think they appear this way in small video windows. odd

Yes, yes it is

I expected more of a Q and E lean spam ;(

What I assumed his bottom diagram meant was that castle barricades should have 2 layers of destruction, one being hard breach only

No one said 2FA would stop hacking. It just makes it harder for hackers to steal accounts from people. Hackers continue to hack because they can buy stolen accounts for cents.
---
Really cool man
---
&gt;rank means nothing
---
lmao, this only applies to a certain extent, and is mostly used either as an excuse for why people are in bronze instead of plat or why people play casual instead of ranked
---
copper is hard to get out of because of smurfs and derankers, but if you do badly enough to get there in the first place that's your own problem, and you're sure as hell not good enough to be anywhere above silver
---
Def
---
Yes, I know, it's a shame that happens to people :(
---
Some next level shit right here.

Why report Jäger? He's trying to pick you up, but he accidentally reloaded.

Aah the cringe

That’d be nice
---
i was looking for this comment, weebs rise up

This is the time to scroll through reddit my friend

I am beyond confused at what this means, can somebody explain, I get the top half but the bottom half I have no idea what he’s trying to say
---
That's a pretty toxic team right there
---
You have more leaks to share? Or is it all leaked skins for this season? Btw Thanks for sharing the leaks
---
Are you going to pay?
---
I know I need to clean the change off
---
Ella ain’t committed 
---
Just curious cuz it’s usually the dudes with snappy aim that are beating me. I wasn’t talking shit or anything man. Was just wondering. 
---
Do i have to?!
---
Everyone acting like glaz is a cheater even though kill cams are glitch af
---
But is Hibana thicc?
---
Technically a 1v4 
---
Look, it was through tactical Ingenuity that I forced that team kill
---
I've found that whenever my team is down 2 or so I make screaming faces in the walls
---
Does Stan have a plan?
---
Depends thumbnails take time and skill of not that turns you into a r/choosingbeggar
---
“Ooh a piece of candy” BOOOOOOOM
---
Jk i dont care
---
The thing is they are on a different continents server. That’s the problem. They ping abuse on the wrong servers cause they don’t have to worry about their rank. That’s the only problem
---
I shall refer him here 
---
Wut
---
Not a bad idea
---
Either way, that would be exploiting a glitch. Both ways are cheating.
---
That's impressive, but I think this should also be saved as an example why 99% of people shouldn't get the starter edition. 
---
definitely hacks
---
Yeah but majority of my friends who I played with don't play anymore.. 
---
So now its just me and one other buddy.. We both are usually either #1 or #2 and go off of each-other, but if we die then the team dies pretty much.. 
---
This guy maths 
---
When you join an ongoing match it doesn’t let you choose an operator most of the time
---
Thanks 
---
Sadly no. He barley knows how to breathe.
---
Oof that aim
---
You can only vote to kick in casual, as far as a know you could only every vote to kick in casual and I’ve been playing since Op Health

my dude believe it or not , some people dont have their own servers, its really not their choice you know?
---
and i say this cuz i recognize those names and im not just hating on u or anything 
---
I know what he’s saying but you’re right in that sense since the handle to sledges sledge is more than likely fiberglass and wouldn’t conduct electricity well, if at all. 
---
Looks like the 2018 invitational vip skin for ash.
---
If you cant shoot his shoulders shoot his feet lol...
---
Console players can't aim. I'm in the top 2% in accuracy on PS4
---
u/eddyk9 has made one 
---
It should also reach all the way to the floor 
---
It was still a great time to play. I started playing Summer 2016. 
---
From his R6 stat page it looks like he doesn’t play ranked at all.
---
&gt; sees blackbeard main
---
Oh no... 
---
F
---
They should definitely bring it to competitive it would prevent a lot of toxic matches.
---
To answer your other questions, there are trolls out there and you will play games with them. If it’s happening to you try get a squad of people together or play ranked another time to avoid ending up in the game as the player constantly. It is more frequent in low ranks and the majority of the time might be people on alternate accounts throwing for fun.
---
I understand that with some people but these guys are holding angles and aggressively peeking everything knowing they can take the rounds. 
---
Smoke or bandit pls 
---
Fuze has joined the server
---
Can’t you just buy one?
---
that too. the gunnar glasses were just my first thought since they were on my desk
---
The deagle or the Alda 5.56
---
Non biased comment
---
ofcourse his concept is broken but any other operator is 20 times better than him. he has nothing useful for the team. woow he is SLIGHTLY better in gunfights. i'd rather have a thermite in my team who uses a knife as his primary than a bb
---
I'm already Patrick.
---
Came here to day this
---
thats ps4 silly
---
The new portal gun operator may need to be nerfed
---
you can thank Reddit for that
---
It is still a game. The announcer says opfor that's a American word in military for hostile forces during training and the game is based at the book operation rainbow where Herford is the main base of the team. And spec forces are training with real bullets but that's just a side fact. 
---
Tachanka's LMG
---
Spas12
---
So like how halo’s multiplayer is?
---
Not at all :) 
---
Rook’s a pretty easy to use, extremely useful operator. Just put your plates down at the start
---
Eh it’s ok. I only went in there when I was looking for a 5 stack of boosters or when I didn’t have any friends on in my own discord and wanted someone to play with but I just solo queue casual now and it tends to be entertaining enough
---
You don’t need to stay away but just beware of the awful way it’s modded
---
Im getting this error now, did you find any fix for this?
---
So like a vr kind of situation but no one actually dies?
---
oh wow i actually thought i put that in my post but i think i cut that away together with something else. my bad
---
Can’t say I was laughing much after the third one lol. I promptly got off after that match and just chalked it up as not my night to play Siege haha. 
---
Aug A2 since counter strike source. I just love the design and look of it.

Surrounding yourself with gu mines can give you a lot of insight as to the direction people are coming at you though.

We enjoy playing other games as well and we're not the competitive type although we do enjoy the occasional ranked game. I'm fine with paying £40 for a years worth of gold to play online and the additional £10-£80 for any other games that come out.
---
I also can't find any justification to pay a minimum of £1000 to buy a good PC for a years worth of games before having to upgrade every couple of years, buy the games i got again and also find new friends to play with when i already have issues making them. Not worth it imo
---
Hacker has ligma
---
That sounds boring. It will be better if it were a civil war 
---
I had 3 people on my enemy team leave in ranked today, gotta love r6
---
If you don't mind me asking, what is HWID
---
My group of friends isnt always available To play. You are right in that I will continue to enjoy the game with friends, however the extent to which I enjoy a Competitive multiplayer, is limited to how Much I can grind out the PVP to gain muscle memory and game Sense. 
---
Get overwatch for example my friends and I got into it not that long ago but my ability to improve myself and enjoy the game solo, allowed me to practice on my own time as well as getting to play with friends. The effort that I invest in getting good at Siege will be lessened by my inability to play the multiplayer solo To practice.
---
The purpose of this post isn’t to Whine But To draw attention to an issue that I believe is important. Of course putting a post on Reddit doesn’t exactly promote great change, But a few people commenting constructive discussion was something I was interested in.
---
lmao caviera got the 80 bullet magazine 
---
Yes pls
---
rip lesion ;(
---
What camo was glaz using? I've never seen it before.
---
you know what thats a good idea btw. this game has turned into trash anyway since year 3 came out. they kept nerfing operators that didnt need to be buffed and nerfed operators that didnt need a nerf. yet they keep adding bullshit which breaks the game. (finka, lion, maverick) and do nothing about it. so yes thats a good idea. 
---
Neither, the system we have is not great but it’s better than both of those that you suggest. Also I know people will abuse it but a lot less would if the whole diamond or trash mindset did not exist.
---
Nice! That's what, 9/10 on placements, right?
---
They were 4 together and tking one guy in their team the whole game. And im a dia but was quing  with some old plat , gold friends so they were at least p2 most of em. And considering their ping they were na or asia. Am from eu. Can send a ss when i get home if you want.
---
Have you tried tweaking the graphics settings? I imagine you a lready have. If i were you i would check my chipset drivers and graphics drivers and if the problem persists maybe a reinstall will help
---
Lmao that Doc😂❤️
---
Hey I'm level 150 and I got bronze 1 after the placement matches... so yeah I'd say silver is good. Especially if solo queuing 
---
Delet blitz.

tts lasts 2 weeks. the release date lands on march 5th

They stopped counting after a while because it doesn’t matter we use bullets for everything

Oh?
---
I feel you man
---
Spam Ubisoft till they accept I guess
---
Yea after red crow or something 
---
Tried it with trusty ash on hereford. Used the rappel method and banked 3800 with 44 kills but took at least 8 minutes. 
---
You a lucky mf
---
Yes it’s against the rules
---
That’s because it’s not Blackbeard 
---
Console has far more players and no hackers. You notice the spawn teleporting hack, the polygon glitch exploit, the invisible hammer cheat. Console doesnt have that. Granted their are mnk but is a small minority plus while mnk offers a slight advantage it does not negate poor play which is why people use it in the first place. (Once you have 1k+ hours on controller positioning and game sense trumps run n gun)Also  i dont want to pressed up against a computer desk when i can be laid back on my couch on the big screen. Lastly I use my computer for serious study and work it helps compartmentalize my mind. Its like going to a party at your work place, you wont work as hard the next day.  
---
I always get them backwards
---
&gt; because then you also buff Pulse.

Yeeeeah or maybe try just not being an awful person?  Play the game, type gg at the end.
---
They should make it level 1000 or something no one has attained yet. Some level where you had to sacrifice some serious social life time and given up other hobbies to pursue virtual interest. It should be like a pocket protector charm or something. So that when you see it you know your in the presence of misanthropy.
---
Nah it’s a useless stat just like mobility 
---
Exploiting glitches don't get anyone banned, and the main reason is that some glitches can be done through accident or coincidence, which is why we can't say for sure who's cheating and who's not unless it's blatantly obvious.
---
Due to pro league choices, maestro is one of the 4 op that being banned frequently(other three are Mira smoke echo), so  you should have maestro. 
---
Other ops are all super fun to play, and all of them offers a different play style. Lion is now reworking, and we don’t know he will be good or sucks so I don’t recommend you buy him. And also I feel nomad’s air jab will be balanced in the future so you can wait one month and see the patches.
---
However, did you collect all Y1Y2 operators?

I’d just like to know how accurate I am with my shots
