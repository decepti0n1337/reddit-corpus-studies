It looks amazing! Now, going into your profile has shown me that this isn't the first time you are posting on reddit, specially cosplays. What's the deal then?

It might do that even if you‚Äôre holding corners and even fast peeking
---
Ahh yes, the 21st Bulletproof camera.
---
Bullets hitting if I aim at a thing? what kind of black magic is that?
---
What did you get
---
*sees first kill* 
---
"But that's not a one tap..."
---
*does not see the second kill, but sees the kill feed* 
---
"Wait... what the fuck just happened."
---
I don‚Äôt like how he‚Äôs pulled up like this in Kids Room
---
Wow, suck unlucky moments, probably because you're using a PlayStation controller
---
If the camera was actually in the eyes instead the neck I probably could've had her.
---
Chemical board for the ump
---
It‚Äôs super annoying when you expect it to be there when you‚Äôre playing ranked, then it‚Äôs all gone and you‚Äôre a basic bitch for a round
---
I'm using a ps4 controller on a ps4...

It‚Äôs the M590

How does your score get so low? How? It always starts you at least at 2%

---
Someone notify ubisoft to make this a legendary skin now
---
Blitz.
---
Mine was that low because I had gotten a pack from a  showdown match prior
---
That, and it‚Äôs really just subjective too. I know plenty of people who like Secret Star. I‚Äôm not a big fan, myself, but I really like the Tarot Card skins despite the fact they‚Äôre common
---
Seems like forced diversity but idk
---
11/10
---
Yes really.
---
I agree. I would only add favela to your list. All those maps are ass
---
Sounds suspish as fuck, I'll pass.
---
Acog *Jager wants to know your location
---
Yeah I totally get that. The only problem is that all those games you mentioned are only on pc. It seems that it can be hard to find a truly tactical game with a large playerbase on console.
---
my prefered tactic involves getting on site, planting, and knowing I can suppress the general area infront of me for the next minute or so without blinking (or reloading)
---
not sure about the first guy but I was joking
---
I just meant like one that isnt toxic but doesnt get mad if someone says Nigeria
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. Glad to see you representing the toxic side of Siege
---
Like some sort of "if we all walk to areas 51 they can't stop all of us" kind of thing? Wow
---
Lmao understood. How do you pick more than one flair?
---
no sadly pc appreciate it though
---
Favela is 50/50 for me. I like the map since it's good for trap ops, but the objectives are so terrible.
---
It‚Äôs so common on console that I‚Äôve stopped playing this game that I love so much.
---
That is what is known as a "***typo***"
---
Fuckin' hell, there was me thinking *I* was fucked in the head.
---
How do you main blitz when he‚Äôs banned every match

The community is not reaching the goal because cowboy mode is lukewarm at best.

Yes

That would be such a cool weapon skin
---
Nope your stuff does not transfer

Idk what you‚Äôre playing with, but PS4 gives you a warning when the battery is low so

No, they still reset but your past ranks have influence over where you get placed.
---
PLEASE

Area 51 guards poop themselves until ela shows up
---
Hahaha occasional bug
---
I suffer from a seafood allergy
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about game programming or anti cheat, but there has to be a way for ubi to implement something that detects that someone  gets a kill before the end of drone phase, they need to be removed from the match
---
Thank you OP, very cool!
---
Ahh yes Zofia chains are needed
---
That is so good!!! Great work on the accessories!
---
Ok thanks :(   ( oral it had black ice for smoke's shotgun
---
Is this walking when you press the button to walk or just normal walking such as walking with gun drawn
---
Mr stork
---
bruh i have found my calling
---
So basically like Overwatch. When a new season starts, after all of your placement matches, you will be placed in a similar rank from last season, correct?
---
Unfortunately you cant edit titles

Yeah but who they got on defense?

That was oddly satisfying

Both... really it‚Äôs just as long as you aren‚Äôt sprinting.

If you‚Äôre not sure, there will be yellow lines that will pop out from both sides of your screen in game when you make identifiable noise, so just keep an eye out for that.
---
play on hereford
---
I don‚Äôt care about j√§ger acog, the claim that it was op? Ok cool you can have that, but not on bandit
---
Kapkan with the sasg12 it‚Äôs absolutely epic and fun

Ye

Ok thanks

5 kills is 5 kills

I had a friend say if its on the same ubi account you ask ubisopport to move it around for you but no promises.

So instead of buffing his almost useless gadget lets buff his weapon first?

I hear you, but they‚Äôll just wait until 1 second after prep phase is over. Humans need to have a role in detecting cheats. It‚Äôs unavoidable.

All 55 and a elite controller

I guess you have a point there

Well this is getting downvoted for some reason.... :(

Did you see her back that thing up though? I think she wanted it just as much as I did.

Bandit is perfect the way he is , and if anybody says he's too powerful I'm coming for them
---
We do it when we lose games too. We'll lose 4-1 and say "ggez." It's just funny to us. When you win easily and say it, that's when it annoys me. But when it clearly wasn't easy and the other team says it, I think it's funny and I laugh.

Well shit my bad. I had the misconception that is was a converted glock. My apologies.
---
I'ma do it. 416 with an acog. Ubi can't stop me.
---
Because we get 5-0‚Äôd every round because its unfair teams. I dont leave but i always put up a surrender if we have like 3 kills in 2 rounds
---
Cobalts also good
---
Yeah the P10 made by CZ, not Glock. Clash has a P10C as well.
---
Happens to me too. Lvl 122. PS4
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs just one after the other then others it‚Äôs smooth sailing 
---
I almost left siege because of it tbh
---
Aw little bitch boy is chocking on his juul it would be great if someone was to help you
---
Thanks!
---
If your put into close range against Ela's shotgun , say your prayers. It's over. Anything beyond that, well...
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
Ohhh. Ok yeah you right. But if you yourself are not in dim/plat you might as well just play casual though, am I right? I mean what‚Äôs the point in playing ranked if you‚Äôre so-so?
---
Other Ubisoft games have glocks So I‚Äôm surprised siege doesn‚Äôt
---
I dont paint my guns. I'm constantly reusing the bricks.
---
My dude, what you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt line up with what happened

Yes.

I can't wait!

Yup, just sounds like someone who can‚Äôt deal with shields, they need to git good

How can one have ONLY recruit? Are you ok?

Didnt see that but was gonna day either end could be lagging

Switch off your cam then go back to it, then it'll work

nvidia lets you put green screens into the game so i just put one behind her and stuck her into the scene. then i had to do a bunch of masking for when thermite walks in front of her
---
Because i like to be competitive with people of the same rank. Not playing someone who‚Äôs 2 ranks above me, same as I wouldnt enjoy slapping silvers around.
---
CHHCHCHCHCHCHC
---
What do you mean? Did they disable certain operators? Or do you mean how Jackal doesn't track terrorist's footsteps?
---
Mozzie. Batman is maverick and Gordon is warden

I main finka and shes near useless in higher ranks- but still fun as hell
---
Pulls slider on glock at least you were the longest one
---
Blitz did give no mercy to you
---
Excuse me what?
---
3 plats and 2 gold ones vs 3 plates a diamond and an unranked.  Yeah I would say that‚Äôs actually pretty balanced
---
I can verify that this is not a Rick roll
---
Fuckin idiot this 2 different people
---
They giving out some pro league sets for free idk why but yay free
---
Bet
---
Thats... really dumb by ubi. Casual is meant to be casual..? In that case, I understand why you‚Äôd smurf, but Imagine in your ranked games you start playing bronzes, and they get slapped differently. It wouldn‚Äôt be enjoyable for them at all. I see your POV but I personally still don‚Äôt agree with smurfs, ubi should revert casual back to what it was 100% though.
---
Oh well fuck both of you then. garbage posts from both of you.
---
Why isn't the Gridlock silhouette wider?
---
Um what are you trying to say. If you're complaining about debris on the window shoot off the area on the soft wall where your going to put the mira before reinforceing and placing the window
---
''Blitz did give no mercy to you''  
---
Had to read that sentence three times before I knew what you ment.

I'm just curious... why does Reddit users hate IFunny so much? I find both platforms equally as toxic

I‚Äôm not I just need more recommendations for games to use MnK on
---
This saddens me deeply. What can i do to help?
---
God, you're lucky as hell in my opinion.
---
Me and the boys I play with have to attack 80% of the time which is really a pain in the a** on some maps.
---
I hope Ubi fixes this soon
---
But can you bonk a spawnpeeking doc
---
at first glance at the thumbnail I thought it was a real gun painted like military ribbons. still cool tho
---
Issa meme
---
You should make Instructions for it lmao. I would love that
---
Ah I see thank u!
---
Don‚Äôt come to school tomorrow 
---
/s
---
I mean have you played cav and vigil? It's basically the same thing. I prefer her fmg because I don't mess with shotguns and I like the Holo sight. But honestly just use her ability when you're near cams and if you want to silently get someone from a distance I would put a suppressor on the deagle but not the fmg since it already does low damage in my opinion. But really that's about it, try not to Sprint as much either since it gives away your position on cams like a distorted blur effect.
---
paint it or keep asking ubi to make a lego camo for the gun
---
Then go for PC my dude
---
Alright thanks!
---
Yeah but the 10% discount and renown boost is super nice though
---
no sorry lmao it isn't sarcasm. it actually worker and im genuinely thankful, this saves a lot of frustration
---
But I thought they release them at the start of the season and in the middle of the season
---
Even the quality is blocky how did you do it?
---
Ok, where are the Recruits attacking from!?
---
No problem man.
---
this would already be done if they were offering another pack, and not a skin for a gimmicky gun that is only used by two characters.
---
They sound similar, but are different people
---
I miss that headshot machine. It was a laser.
---
Is that 2 Nokk's?
---
I completely misread this.

"Question about *titties* on people"
---
"Think this is the wrong place to ask that bud.."
---
HE (I)  HAS THE POOWWWWWERRRRRR
---
This is true. Definitely more pros than cons. I'm glad they have a one time purchase and then your good each season sort of model for the main operator etc as opposed to buying each opp for 9.99 or something and then having to buy the map rework for 4.99 etc haha
---
Why does Sledge have a French shotty
---
Yea, I checked on IMDB, different voice actors. It would‚Äôve been pretty neat if they were the same voice actor though. Kinda like how Maestro and Mr. Krabs are played by the same voice actor.

r/bane posting

This dude really raided area 51 early with out us and stole that. Bruh
---
Maestro and Mr. Krabs have the same voice !? How awesome didn't know that
---
Not mentioning any names *cough* EA *cough*
---
Just a reminder (here comes hate)  
---
Playing mouse and keyboard is not against the rules. I don‚Äôt play it but I know this.
---
I love you and your helpful T-shirts, Rook Main :)
---
I feel they should mess up the game for them like purposely crash on them before the last round starts.
---
and i thot i was good at legos
---
It's might be that you are the only solo in that team, you can't really tell tho
---
I once played with a guy admitting confidently on mic that he was using m&amp;k. Instead of thinking he was just a toxic cheater I felt bad for him. Even with that superior technology he still was the worst player on the team.
---
I honestly have no idea if someone is using m&amp;k or not. Sometimes I can have insane clutches and flick on guys where even I‚Äôm surprised. I‚Äôm sure someone incorrectly believed I was playing with m&amp;k (if they watched me play long enough they‚Äôd know I wasn‚Äôt). I just kinda assume the other guy was better than me during that particular fight. 
---
That‚Äôs one issue I haven‚Äôt really noticed myself on console. However, if I actually invested time into ranked I‚Äôd probably end up low platinum, so maybe my experience isn‚Äôt the standard.
---
what the freak man
---
That would be great or like thake away there ammo or somthing
---
lol nice but ye i can agree
---
And I thought my 360 kills with Glaz was impressive
---
Was in a game today and everyones ping shot past 5k. It normalized but we had 1 minute to plant
---
I mean he's kinda useless right now.
---
But it is back though.
---
It‚Äôs repost time!

Not only does she ping phones she pings heads who knew

What is so insane about this?

so ugly
---
the problem isn‚Äôt dealing with hackers, it‚Äôs actually being able to detect someone using them. i mean i don‚Äôt know why battle eye can‚Äôt recognize someone flying across the map going a million mph and perma ban them, or the killing someone with a gun before prep phase ends hack. how does this shit get by?
---
"I expect you to perform like a well-tuned engine!"

Thats what i said! I also said they should have a toxicity ranking and match you with similarly toxic players.

Even on a lego gun there is ACOG -_-
---
J√ÑGER... Pity him(((
---
You just said every wrong thing possible
---
I don‚Äôt know if they know.
---
If you just close the game and open it again everything goes back to normal
---
Please do J√§ger‚Äôs rifle with the ACOG I need a little bit of hope for my main
---
well honestly what do they expect, we have no reason to keep playing the game mode and those that do arn't going for headshots when they can dump 2 shotgun shells and a 6 revolver rounds faster than ubisoft can make a new assassins creed.
---
I was holding an angle earlier and doc kept standing right in front of me, he got pissed when he stood between me and an enemy and I ended up killing him. Not my fault you cant find another spot.
---
They probably don't know.
---
Thought this was VR
---
The whole comment section of this post is r/tworedditorsonecup
---
The reason the gun is shit is because it only has 2 shots and ironically, is terrible in close quarters. Its a pure gimmick/fun gun and should stay as is. Being able to snipe people on defense with it is fun every time.
---
Solid rush my dude, but you had plenty of time to finish off the last guy before anything exploded, and you weren't the one who downed him either.
---
I'd say its close, but no cigar, srry.
---
Excuse me
---
Man that sucks, sorry to hear you‚Äôve experience such blatant and disgusting racism. I‚Äôve been kicked unfairly before but at least it was never for anything as unsavoury as the colour of skin or my heritage.
---
Ubisoft absolutely should be putting resources towards managing this element of the community (whether it is common or not, it should be non-existent) or you‚Äôre right big sections of the player base will move away. No one wants to suffer that type of abuse.
---
Just rest assured that these people lead empty and unfulfilled lives which is why they have so much hate to try and spew all over the rest of us. In the main I think the community is great but the bad element wants cutting ASAP
---
For me toxic players are few and far between. Also a have a lot of people to play with
---
Should post this on the pixelguns sub
---
This is an error right? if he dumped that much into the game and only gets this that's just fucking shit. Should he make a support ticket?
---
I would have calmly set my controller down and scream into a pillow
---
yeah it barely takes up any space on the screen. you only really lose the space where the hud is
---
It's really just not fun to play anymore unless you have m&amp;k

Hardline (on PC at least) is kinda close-to-death - 2 servers active at a time last time I played it.

 They changed it back so you no longer get the 20 base operators i also bought the deluxe edition and with it you only get the year 1 operators.
---
Why RB6 instead of R6S or just R6 if you're talking about the franchise?
---
Nevermind, this was essentially the culmination of the game's perfect hitboxes and 300IQ moves right there. Something we should all learn to do when trying to deny the enemy Kapkan from getting a free kill.

Always been interested in Siege cinematics, guess I'll have to give it a try. Thanks!

I think watching this whole situation from his perspective is much better than getting a kill.

Some already exist. They were acquired through challenges.

Looks like Twitch has been working overtime for Bastille Day. Maybe the bigger one is her Shock Drone Mk.2?

Yeah. For a solo operator who's supposed to enter obj by herself and take out Anchors, she feels underwhelming at best. Every other flanking ops just seem better than her in every cases.

Yeh definitely a missed opportunity however still great art work

Source?
---
But it is cheating. There's no excuse for using mkb on Console, it gives an unfair advantage.
---
Consoles have reduced recoil to compensate for thumbsticks, so mkb on consoles offer better recoil control since it is treated as a controller still.
---
Of course you will get a brick thrown at you, because it sounds stupid. If he has no money for PC, then he knows he is playing against other controller users, why then would you feel obligated to get that unfair advantage? You literally buy an adapter that makes your device be treated as a controller, so you know you are doing something wrong.
---
If mkb was natively supported and you were paired against other mkb, nobody would have a problem.

When did saying Fuck you become a joke?
---
Rainbow Six Quarantine : 
---
#Am i a joke to you ?
---
Either ‚Äòdisabling‚Äô  or calling that ‚Äòthey‚Äôre on the defuser‚Äô is what i‚Äôd tend to say.
---
Its not a witchhunt at all. Its a warning for others. Im not pulling any rank card, I wanted to see if he really was sayi g the truth because im sure you know others can and likely will lie. I havent played ranked, but its 6 AM as im typing this so I cant exactly check my level.
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt know you could until this happened
---
I don't want to be mean, but it doesn't seem like you or your friend are good at reading what you are purchasing before you buy it.

How I see the whole thing going over. One trigger happy guard will start shooting. Oops. Government response: they had it coming.
---
Yeah he's not very bright so it's on him.
---
I had no idea about that thank you for this information.
---
Props to the copper guy for getting a kill
---
Its a magazine
---
You have to earn them now base operators cost from 500 to 2000 renown.
---
Ew drop shot
---
Should someone with metal legs be aloud to run a race because it makes him light?

Praise him!

Yeah..
---
My friend has one legendary skin... he got duplicate legendary.
---
I feel bad for laughing on teamspeak but I couldnt help myself :D
---
1. Post is a joke
---
2. J√§ger 
---
3. Not all ops have nades
---
You lasered that fuze damn
---
okay, i have no idea how to explain that one...
---
Thanks
---
Why did you panic so much lol. You could have tried shooting the trap again then running in if someone was following youüòÇ
---
I had 3299 - Plat 3 was so close then I lost 2 games in a row.
---
But I got Plat anyway so thats nice.
---
But you got black ice
---
omg...did u just read my mind on how i play!
---
im just amazed really
---
But not all countries.
---
It‚Äôs Peru
---
Wait so it isnt a bike helmet? Really?
---
I'm horribly annoyed at how the lesion just snatches the killcam by a milisecond when you get such a kill hnnnnnnngggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh
---
Which one are you referencing? I don't know any of the flags for season 3 and 4
---
Season 3
---
Outback, Kafe and I think Hereford  don't have bombers, or c4/barb wire rooms.
---
I cant believe this is the 13th time I've seen this post
---
Damn ephebophile
---
I‚Äôve used these before, the stick just keeps it from rolling over ao the camera can look straight
---
its pc tho
---
I believe the proper term is ‚Äúkaboomy mat‚Äù
---
Ah. Well the way ops have been going they should be interesting
---
Yeah, on console it's almost always the people with ego stroking names that are the worst players
---
Nice
---
 They might reuse weapons like now
---
I‚Äôve used these once lol, they‚Äôre a lot slower than in the game and they have a little fish tail behind them to prevent them from rolling over and looking at the sky/floor
---
Ugh true. We'd all love an exciting new weapon
---
Xbox players be like:
---
Identities of the Foreign Legion are also kept secret. Actually, their old identities are erased and they‚Äôre only allowed to use fake ones. But nonetheless they‚Äôre always in parades so idk about the standards
---
Kaid is pretty much Bandit but better
---
Mozzie just takes attacker‚Äôs drones
---
Mozzie has a cool reload animation though... That‚Äôs really it
---
yeah, there are some devices, few phones and laptop. Maybe disabling Wi-fi on my phone and  few devices will help a little bit. Also i'm thinking about Powerline adapters. Any experiance? Is it worth?
---
You just can‚Äôt handle the S T A C H E

Yeah I suppose you're right. The gaming world just isn't what it used to be anymore. Coding was both a gift and a plague to the human race.

I think there should be a little more arch in the dog's back but it's rlly nice

Now thats a pro gamer move.

No I think he meant ‚ÄúBreach charge‚Äù but said ‚ÄúMat‚Äù for some reason.
---
Yep, ranked has a ban phase now where the teams take turns banning an operator from each phase.
---
I think of a potato bag idk boutchu
---
Uh oh.  Only 29/30 bullets in my mag.  Better put in a freshie.
---
I tried to tell people  in the game but nobody listened

imagine how popular you'd be if you brought this to your middle school classroom

Welp looks like I got my next project! Thanks for the idea

Captain is dead.

He got hit by a car.

Good job dude! Your ping always high like this? :D

Nope I just wanted to make a p90 for my collection one day and did it

I do yes

Nah, furries draw the weird ass wolves that are like half human half dog. This is just a straight up wolf in a costume.

Oh, and also, you went from 1-3, then back to 2 and straight to 5 xD

Yes the m870 gang some will be on the hatches.
---
Jaeger is the English spelling of j√§ger

That too

I think that pulse mains should think of finding new ops.

nah it just spikes really high sometimes
---
Why they both peeking the same spot tho
---
Several people are talking about it every week
---
Its even funnier the third time its posted
---
I know on ps4 you press R1 to pull out the launcher, R2 to fire and then you can press R1 immediately after to detonate. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a similar way to do it on pc
---
When somebody is balanced, the question of pros and cons don't arise since you aren't ever going to make changes.
---
Vector acog would be the biggest game breaker :L
---
It's looks handheld though... Do you just have a friend film your game?
---
team killing us rough to address. For me accidental killing happens more than others as I shoot at stuff that suprise. so yeah I think the way it is now is good
---
Wrong
---
Everyone does for some reason, but I personally love it
---
I think 4, I haven't played too much recently and I don't like how you can customize the weapons
---
Buy a better mouse, if you can‚Äôt afford it, you shouldn‚Äôt be wasting your time on games. Macros are against the rules in EVERY Multiplayer Competitive game.
---
Cav is only good when the attacking team doesn't coordinate. If no one drones and they play like it's Call of Duty, then Cav will get some tasty interrogations that'll truly turn the tides.

Thanks for the I. Depth reply I‚Äôll be sure to try out Mira and maestro !

TF is more associated with Team Fortress. If you said TF2 I'd think of Team Fortress 2.
---
Idk to me it looked like he didnt realize valkyrie was there and you would rather risk your teammates life for a kill. I'd put that one on you.
---
Similar to when people try firing over you when you're downrange without giving warning, then seemed incensed when they teamkill you by shooting you in the back.
---

Pretty dumb feature for the game to reset ur weapons after a game of showdown don‚Äôt ya think

Been playing for 4 years on and off, still get wrecked daily, it's part and parcel, every death I try to learn something new

None of this makes any sense because blood came out of his skull

You mean on console

So, there‚Äôs this thing called France...

Well yeah but actually no

ok i'll try that, i hope it will work.I really would like to play Siege without any lag and dbeing disconnected

5 I think? I know I've donated 6-7 headshots to others.

I mean you could defend on hostage with, say, Ash. Or play bomb as Warden. You can play any character on any terrorist hunt game mode.

Oh yeah I am trash. But seeing how I die I will normally start to switch off ops and try it in a different game. I used to main as Kapkan and just sit on site but now I‚Äôve been playing Jager and roaming more.
---
Ayyyyyyyyyy lmao
---
Shouldn't he have gotten at least one of the base game ops, I remember having a few when I got the standard edition for pc in 2016
---
Did you crontrol it by using a smartphone?
---
they work just like in the game, sideways driving and all (except for the jumping).
---
Oh wow, I love this so much. As an Alibi main, it‚Äôs great to see her getting some love. Excellent job!
---
Not anymore
---
Yes, but TF2 is also used for Titanfall 2.
---
It would be extremely painful!
---
True
---
I mean the idea behind it is helps the push, giving bonus health, reducing recoil, reducing the effects of stuns, and making you move faster through barbed wire.

Nice idea

Hello Realitae, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cd4631/when_will_you_finally_fix_leavers_in_ranked/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

I've done it with a silly office mouse, so you shouldn't have a problem with what you have.

And macros are banned EVERYWHERE. A Pro got banned for 2 years (or 3) for using macros in PL, so you know that people don't like it.
---
Yeah but I have Nokk.
---
Delet this

Sorry I meant any op that was attacking or defending depending on what we were doing.
---
Can we get this as a skin lol
---
Russian Badger.
---
I'd recognise this anywhere.
---
**P E S C I**
---
Yeah. I'm just offering a counter to why we need it. I definitely think it needs to be kept for the situations I mentioned above, but I really wish they could prevent users from abusing it, but I don't see how they could without making it useless at times.
---
But I'm really sorry to hear that, dude. I get kicked all the time for dumb shit or for just being unwanted. The dumbest reason I was kicked was because my username was all in caps, and a teammates just didn't like it, so he had the whole team kick me out. I don't get it, I really don't. 
---
Ultimately it's like you said with people kicking you and not letting you play. Its completely annoying when you get kicked for dumb reasons, when you bought this game to play the game, but half the time you can't because people TK you or Kick you out. Its absurd. Its just a helpful function abused into a dick move.
---
Lmao
---
That's pretty good!
---
Wow!
---
Laughs in already inside objective

Whatever happened to those operator cats?

This title made me feel like I'm having a stroke

Inaccurate, you never get to shoot the bosg twice.

Jokes aside amazing work.

Yeah it's funny how the people who vote to kick and trash talk are bottom of the scoreboard lol.

Get Valkyrie  because I got Blackbeard and I regret wasting 10000 renown on him. He‚Äôs to slow and his shield deflect only a few bullets.

Looks great. 10/10 good boy right there ngl. (Should of gone for drawing Jackal as a Jackal)

Yes, on PC.

You only hit one pellet. It‚Äôs unlikely but shotguns are random

The power of friendship has prevailed this day

Anything goes in overtime.
---
What being nerfed 800x does to someone
---
With controller? That‚Äôs the hardest part, going against mnk
---
I‚Äôd personally go for Mira because her guns are good, she‚Äôs a fun op to play with, her mirrors are very useful (unless your teammates are idiots), and she‚Äôs a 3 armor so she can take hits.
---
PESCI NOOO
---
The dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever done on siege was panic and impact grenade hibana pellets on an un-reinforced wall making a much larger hole than what the pellets would‚Äôve made.
---
&lt;snort&gt;
---
Yeah probably, if they started out prone and stood up when the connectivity problem happened it would've been in reverse
---
I'd leave theme park in, except for that you're correct
---
Never heard of her.
---
Agreed. And im sorry that you got booted for your username. Thats just absurd
---
I don't have all the answers, but judging purely off what we can see then maybe that could work. I wouldn't recommend trying to exploit poor connection though
---
Laughs in RFF
---
Don't care about rank, prefer to just play the game, I don't tryhard ranked anyway. Secondly, Blackbeard is a two way op. You either have great Blackbeards or terrible Blackbeards, there is almost never an in between. He's barely picked, barely won with. 80 health shield against the average of 800 rpm, 30 damage smgs makes it break in less than two seconds. Plus, you can see his shield poking out of windows and doorways and can shoot it and break it. He runs slower with it out. His ads time is slower. You have to anchor with him as an attacker and most of the time, that isn't helping the team at all. As I said, can't frag, his ads and speed are too slow. Can't try and sneak up cause he's louder with the shield and you can see it around corners. There is nothing you can do to Blackbeard at this point. He's already a bad op objectively
---
That's adorable
---
On Xbox we are at 1,742,559

Time well spent.
---
I was just wondering bc I'm switching soon
---
It's not like I'd want to actually play with people who do this anyway. 
---
If anything they're doing me a favor.
---
Started mid white noise and honestly love how the game has changed
---
Fun at launch but dumb as shit
---
So, how many times you've seen this tactic in tournaments?
---
I like it! Too bad it wont copy on the holograms
---
I'd love to do this but there's almost no way to tell if you hit them or not with the stim
---
If you press the gadget button again after shooting, it will first activate the kairos and then reload
---
We not gonna talk about twitches drone on steroids..?
---
Well no I cannot unsee it.
---
Yeah, no worries, your post just sounds a bit like you were saying that Roni P10 is basically a Glock like FMG-9. Thanks for the clarification in this case.
---

I think it happens when you play show down. Just close the game and reopen it. That works for me

My nick on Uplay has Wolf in it and I like playing Jackal.

I've been telling people before and I will continue this story: Because this isn't about you or me or the rest of this god-forsaken vessel called Rainbow Six Siege. It's all about the eSports and the league. They ensure that the game works there, the rest is left for dead.
---
My buddy was play on console now mid to high silver on pc
---
Man bb is a soloq bestfriend
---
Nice way to promote yourself
---
All you need is a few bullets.
---
I don't get how people use that gun, it's like my mouse is having a stroke when I shoot it
---
aparently there is a some kind of craze on the net right now with people signing up to invade area 51 , a joke , but with more than half a million people already signed up.
---
Thx now I know I need to try a little more on PC lol
---
I've started to play on PC last October, I haven't played against a single hacker (1000 ranked matches in gold)
---
Even devs have stated they don‚Äôt like spawn peaking and are trying to remove it from the game slowly. So. Like. Your bad
---
1 i just want a free skin. The mode was fun for the first 3 days but it gets stale real fast
---
Not too many. no. no
---
That is a massive bath
---
Saw
---
PC is sweatier and more toxic. Also more fun
---
So by your logic, a harder to use gun means I'm not confident in my aim. I CAN use mp5 I choose p90 over mp5 because the mp5 is is slow and boring. Using the p90 is always a challenge.
---
Furry detected wee woo wee woo
---
Used to be the best gun in the game
---
If we had a headshot for everytime someone has asked this question we'd have the showdown bosg skin by now
---
I figured it would more toxic since there's test servers on PC only
---
I play in aus and I have this problem too. Apparently Ubisoft has this problem for years now and it's never fixed. At least they could've added an alternative payment method.
---
How are impacts use for hatch denial? Im fairly new.
---
What do you mean nobody uses the AUG?
---
Alibi can say it all she likes ;)
---
I feel like you're no understanding.
---
Rocket league ranks based on the highest person in the party so if you have a gold one and 3 coppers you would get out into a game against all golds because your highest player is a gold one. Rocket league completely ignores the lower ranks in the party.
---
This method would completely end the bringing lower levels in order to rank up easier.
---
So trolls will walk in while you shooting enemies/throw c4/frags/smoke's gas/capitao's fire arrow?
---
And you can text chat with everyone
---
I pick Jager expressly for his gadget. If I don‚Äôt, my friend does. He‚Äôs far too useful not to pick. His gun being good is just a bonus
---
That too lol

Aug is a decent gun and j√§ger doesnt need nerfing so i dont know why the fuck you want this to happen

damn you just beat me i was about to say of all that maps you can pick, still cool though at least its not some shit like hereford base or Fortress
---
You're pretty lucky then. It really doesn't help that I already hate my accent. I fucking cringe hearing myself in a video, and people making fun of me as soon as I speak just makes it worse. My accent is like a northerner has been living in the south for 30 years and started to talk like a southerner. But I was born here in the south.

Alibi seems like a op you could use on any map and in a lot od different ways. Not a fan of miras window

yes, its so annoying

Because I don't play ranked on that account without a 5 stack. That's how fam.

The only medicine I hope is involved is you getting a lasting, bitter taste of your own.

The reason J√§ger has a high pickrate is because he's the only one who can completely counter projectiles and throwables. Which incase you haven't noticed, nearly every Attacker has something to throw. There's no alternative to J√§ger, and they're still trying to make one. The reason Warden exist is because they were trying to find an alternative to J√§ger. But Warden is so situational that he's pretty much almost useless. J√§ger isn't op or anything, he doesn't need a nerf. He needs an alternative. As for no one using the AUG, changing a gun won't really make a difference. The main reason the AUG isn't used in a lot of cases I've noticed is because it takes up so much room on your screen. It's a really good gun when you look past the fact that its so large on screen. Slightly lower damage but a higher rate of fire than the commando makes them about equal in my eyes. Commando has the edge because it's small and you can put an angled grip on it, making it more appealing to some players.

It would be fire

u/onehundopercentyours u gonna buy that Ela Bathwater?

No, I don‚Äôt wanna wait 5 minutes for you to load just move on to another match

I may have this wrong but the reason it looks like eyeholes is to throw off the enemy into thinking they can see their facial features.

Hello Ragingbow, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cd70da/audio_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That bath is huge
---
The audio bugs that have plagued the game since Op Health of all operations.
---
/r/
---
So glad I didn‚Äôt die like that tho
---
Is it wrong that I um... never mind
---
Bandit and j√§ger have launched their first attack to find the sacred acogs
---
Yes comrade, water from Lord Tachanka 5 dollars
---
No critique necessary. This is perfect
---
It‚Äôs not a bike helmet lol it‚Äôs a snake head she is a lizard person
---
The worst thing is that they do it for reactions like this. Trolls want the rage. It feeds them.
---
Lower ranks it doesnt matter
---
This is some artistic shit
---
Them shooting but not killing you blowing open hatch‚Äôs you want reinforced and them basically not killing enemies because they would rather fuck you over
---
Do thatcher please
---
Like a year ago when I was playing on xbox we were both downed in the secure room and the last one to bleed out won
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care for this because:
---
1. It‚Äôs almost always best that the injured enemy gets killed in some so as to not risk a revive (Exceptions include baiting the enemy, last guy left and you‚Äôre trying to get the breach charge kill achievement, hitting them with smoke grenades until they die, weekly challenges in casual, etc.)
---
2. If two people are simultaneously shooting an enemy (typically with automatic weapons), I‚Äôm not going to expect the other person to know who injures them, when to stop shooting and who should get the final blow.
---
Now if I tell you not to kill them, and you see they‚Äôre downed, and I‚Äôm running up to them to stab them to get that last equipment kill challenge and then you shoot them, we might have a problem.
---
Your main already is a harborer of pure nightmare
---
This is a great meme but it reminds me of Belle Delphine and it makes me depressed about the state of men, as well as sort of glad that the bar is set so low in regards of being better than the average guy.
---
Damn more furries. But good art

I wish you could toggle the laser on and off honestly. You can in insurgency, why not here?
---
He got banned? Now I‚Äôm actually sad
---
That‚Äôs a fact
---
If you‚Äôre on console restart your app
---
ye I thought something like that
---
Thanks! This is nice to know. Thankfully, I already had the best one on my girl Ying, but I've been using the Comp on Maestro's Alda.

I can't give a shit anymore. That's what I hate about them. Those fuckwits will do everything to tilt and destroy everything you have, and then laugh you off when you are obviously mad about it. Because of shitheads like that, I can't even check out in game a cool new skin I got to clash, because people do everything just to make a living hell out of your life, just by exploiting the shit out of this game. If you are one of those cunts, and are reading this comment, go to hell. There you can cheat all you want

Get down Mr. President!

Toxic that‚Äôs all

I can't find a team ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

BITCH... Buddy it do not matter

Intro?
---
Looks more like Ela than Ubi's shitty cgi render of her in the trailers for quarantine.
---
What I'm saying is I can't find a team I can coordinate with
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
They did, use to be challenges to unlock them early seasons
---
What platform
---
Soz I don‚Äôt know why I do it

Ok

---
I'm not saying she's underpowered, don't get me wrong I do like where she's at, just that flashes or nades would be a good change as I don't see many people use claymore on her.
---
the worst maps in ranked are theme park, Hereford base, the new map and the morrocan map
---
There's a bathtub next to the shower.
---
Bullets do still count after you die. Think about it, you can trade kills therefore bullets still count after death.
---
That is completely false.
---
Yeah the first thing you see when you boot up siege, like csgo has -nointro command
---
:(
---
It literally makes no difference which you have first.
---
There is, but it can't be that low to where I constantly play these kind of matches.
---
Those are his bullets you can tell by the hole in them that they were facing away from him. And in siege if both people shoot at the same time then they both die if it‚Äôs a headshot
---
Yes I had it after the showdown was just released it reset after I closed and relaunched the game

But then there‚Äôs the whole issue of Alt + F4, turning off your network, turning off your PC / console, etc.

Then you get to play three rounds while defending. So now you have the advantage.

I don‚Äôt know if I just outlined him down to the pixel or something but I think at least one of those shots should have hit.
---
I won't. He's our lord and saviour. 
---
Who Tachanka??
---
Nope lol 4K
---
He literally the most over powered character in the game because he has the most weapons
---
It's ok. I do it all the time too. It's like my brain cant process literally what I just looked at and have to click it another 5 times.
---
I would say so because she's an intel character so you can find out where enemies are plus she has a pretty decent load out as well
---
Not unless you just want to sit and hold angles

Yea I still haven‚Äôt found a good way to get ps4 clips onto reddit but it‚Äôs easier to see the headshot with better quality
---
If you look closely 1 bullet did connect (you can tell because of the blood) but you were also aiming at his shoulder so rip.
---
No but tbh it doesnt really change her effectivness at all. Theyre best as door or window alarms.  If someones gonna shoot its gonna be a quick reaction and they wont think about what skin you had on. Or theyre going to shoot it through a window or he forced to crawl through it and get pinged.  Or theyll shoot it and you can see it disappeared. I feel like any alibi trying to pass herself off as a hologram is using her wrong.
---
what about a 2nd m870
---
no

I‚Äôm fine with this

I feel like this is a monthly occurrence at this point. Like One person does it, then like 10 others in a week

You appear to have grazed the eyelid of the opponent

That's what they want you to think. ;)

That's sieges way on tell you you're good at the game. Or that dude is bad
---
What‚Äôs that?
---
Wow
---
I'm wondering is it more of no scopes for headshots or the fact that everything is semi auto
---
The challenge is to hard and not many people want to play the game mode
---
I have never seen anyone with their keyboard at that angle. Why have it facing that way? Looks painful
---
What a reaction time! Couldn‚Äôt pull that one off myself...
---
Fucking finally
---
Fix your connection or get a better connection before playing ranked.
---
True point
---
I'll hopefully get to that point this season lol. I've been trying.
---
What's a commonly sense?
---
About 10 yards and any rifle
---
Unfortunate they blocked that window. Should of removed that ladder or made it only one window instead of two
---
This is what cas on ps4 feels like.
---
Discriminatory/harassing/toxic behavior of any kind (saying anything that is toxic toward the other player), kicking a person who has waited through a round as backfill is just rude (but really nothing extra), and definitely queueing as a squad in order to kick random players (this is extremely toxic and honestly they should just lose seasonal squadding rights, which is a new penalty I just invented). 
---
The worst offense of all is what I will call ‚Äúqueue dumping‚Äù. This is when a 4 stack squad (or 2 in temporary game mode) maliciously kicks every player who joins them, essentially dumping them back into the queue, since they‚Äôll have to immediately queue back up. This essentially harms both the players who have spent a minute and a half in queue (I know, not too much) by making them have to wait again and Ubisoft, since their matchmaking and queue times are probably affected by these dumbass vacuums. 
---
Overall, it‚Äôs not a major priority, but I‚Äôd say that it is *very easy* to tell what is toxic and what isn‚Äôt when getting vote kicked. 
---
Note: if someone lies about you being a teamkiller, that is toxic to some degree, but it‚Äôs impossible to prove they didn‚Äôt believe it. So that scenario is one where it probably would have to be excused.

I have a friend that plays with wing on the rare occasion and he says its not fun to play with him at all. Wings doesn't allow any joking or talking that doesnt involve callouts.
---
Seems pretty racial to me

I clicked on the screen when it started shooting and I thought that it was interactive I was like bruh.
---
By the looks of his eyes I'd say you actually drew Bandit cosplaying as Blitz. You can't fool me.

But needs 7 million

Ya missing clash xd

Oh shit my first negative karma comment. I think I can call myself a veteran Redditor now.
---
I mean I'm in college so you arent wrong, but if friends and I want to tk each other even though it's not funny to you we should be able to
---
You can place a claymore on the helipad in the last round and it‚Äôll blow up an enemy if placed correctly
---
So that's what's in the cansiter

Haha you didn‚Äôt need to take the official art

I love this video. Maybe create an alternate ending where Maverick kills him and Warden gets kicked

Idk does Warden push his mustache up to do his? I'm joking, because his player model looks like he does

You can't. Not in multiplayer. They disabled that a long time ago.

Well recruit isn't even available in ranked

There are only voicelines in multiplayer terrorist hunt afaik.

Honestly imagine if during the April fools event this is what the guns looked like and you get them from the packs
---
How is a low silver supposed to play with their high gold friends then without getting slammed 8:1 by the enemy team then?
---
In burnt horizon? In the wiki, it shows that mozzie has spawn voice lines
---
Doesn't the game already track that? When you get downed by Cav you spin towards her no matter what angle you were facing so the game definitely accounts for her downing you.
---
I believe the Russian badger said it‚Äôs like getting punched in the face every time u shoot
---
alright, then maybe ban-for-age isn t the right choice. how about an option to report toxic behaviour? a friend of mine used to play a MOBA - until he was reported (he really deserved it!) too many times for beeing too toxic, resulting in a ban from chats and at least ban from the game for 30 days.. how about that?
---
Lorde Blitz
---
You don't...that evil will always be around unfortunately.
---
As if you even had any in the first place
---
Might as well subtract
---
Flash bangs are just broken.   Ying Flash landed right next to me and did fuck all.  The poor soul rushed in and should have had a free kill but just got shotgunned to the chest.
---
Sounds about right knowing how toxic casual gets
---
do i need to show receipts? üòÇ
---
Yuuuup.
---
Blows my mind how Ubi will work on new content over fixing the many issues with their game. By making this new content, they bring in more bugs that just add onto the pile.
---
Please Ubi, fix your game!
---
I mean she probably doesn't weigh that much
---
Pretty much the same except we have to reach 6 million
---
That'd be nice but you know what else would be ? Getting something for leveling your clearance level up.
---
I'lL take your whole stock
---
Do i have to repeat myself agian?
---
how long of a streak we talking?
---
its the video game equivalent to checking the fridge multiple times
---
Not sure if they work on console, but for PC I‚Äôd always recommend AudioTechnica. The best imo
---
think the more games you play less elo you get. correct me if i‚Äôm wrong

As you play more games the amount of ELO you gain decreases

I‚Äôm my lord Jesus what kind of aim not you using

Yea the smg12 has a crazy amount of vertical and horizontal recoil. Its basically impossible to control. Like you have to be rougly 1-2 meters away from someone to kill them.

Uhhh, say again?

I was gonna get it anyway cause I love watchdogs 2

Im on my fifth game rn. If i win ill send you a damn screenshot this is bothering the fuck out of me. My friends on my team are getting 30-40. Also in silver. We're getting the same amount of games in

If the hatch has breakable floors at least at one edge you can open the floor with eg a shotgun etc after that you can use an impact to destroy exo charges and x kairos because their damage spreads in a ball like shape

I got 20 in one night and realized there were only a little over 950k with only 4+ days to go, didn't see it gaining anymore traction, my suspicions were right... they should've added a showdown pack for more incentive

There is sorta a solution to that problem. Once you press the leave game option in ranked put in a requirement to remain still for like 10 seconds before allowing you to leave.
---
Hmmm...  ._.

Holographic might be the best one though. Used Red dot and Reflex but Holographic is solid. Trust me, I have an easier time killing drones when my aim is a bit shaky. Try it out.
---
So this is how mista feels when he uses sex pistols
---
I'm not saying boosting and smurfing is ok. its not. But if you are playing with freinds in a stack and cant coordinate enough to avoid being destroyed by ONE guy, then the problem is kind of on you as well.
---
18 kills in 4 rounds means he got damn near an ace **every round**. I dont care what rank he is, that should not be possible against even a semi coordinated team.
---
&gt; You're mad as hell over getting chat spammed,
---
?. Could you be any more mad?
---
That's what I assumed they meant.
---
I actually dont see anything wrong with this even if it is a bug.... just implement the same thing like Nomad but more delay on seconds of changing from ability usage to primary weapon.
---
Double negative, so I guess you are sexist
---
Seems like you got most of it. I play on console and the Anticheat doesn‚Äôt work. Friend of mine went a legit 107-2 cause he was in a bomber the entire time and no one shot him down and he got banned for it and I played with him for a bit and he was good but he got lucky in that plane. And the game did feel rushed. I was pulling kills with my tommy and sten that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. Like 8 people in 30 seconds. The game had balancing issues. Personally I‚Äôm all against issues that cause micro transactions but at least with them they made it possible to play to win things and earn them. Though they should‚Äôve focused on polishing the game before they added a BR (which if you ask me is a horrid idea and was the idea of the guy wanting money and rip people off)
