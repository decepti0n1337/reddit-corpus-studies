Getting killed by jackal
---
copper IV is legitimately the hardest rank before you get up to the top end of gold because of derankers.
---
Good for you, but please think about the other players, just because something is easy for you doesn't mean it is easy for everyone. People that do these weekly challenges are people who bought starter/standard/advanced edition, they do these for renown not for the sake of giving themselves challenges.
---

---
People solo queue a lot, which increases their lose rate. Most of the weekly challenges require you to actually win the game. And the one with Win 8 rounds with GIGN/Spetsnaz is certainly not an easy one.
---
I can already tell what kinda guy this is judging by the vape and the screen
---
Wait How do you get out whit the hostage?
---
youre not the only one that wants a fucking suicider üòÇ I wanna run in there and scream ALLAHU AKBAAAARRRRR through my microphone so bad man. 
---
How?
---
I've been playing since blood rain so I know your pain üòÇ
---
r/shittyrainbow6 
---
Twitch should be the thicc drone
---
No, its SUPERDRONE
---
No... IT'S ECHO MAIN!
---
Woo, I sure love having the excitement of gold light from the pack turned into a common, its the best feeling in the world
---
I know I'm gonna get downvoted, but I've been playing since Red Crow (PC) and I'm level 216 -- I don't think they should've given him thermals. People just wanted Ubi to fix the hitreg on his rifle. The fact that a single bullet hole in a wall can give you away because there's yellow showing through is bs. Being able to see through smoke is enough of a special ability. 
---
Good play overall on your part.
---
How? Blitz should get an ak-47 because he is also special, you can just make his shield his gadget also.
---
You realize you hit the railing, right? 
---
Imaging shooting all of those drones.... so many points ü§§
---
That was my first thought.
---
I placed high gold ever year and deranked it unintentionally due to terrible team mates. BUT with that being said 85% I think is a good number to say of silver and lower I can pretty much trash to get back to gold only to que bad teammates again and repeat cycle it's really about your skill level my guy and a little luck to land some one half decent on your team . SO WITH THAT ALL SAID IF YOU DRANK alllllllllll the way to copper and cant get out your skill level needs to improve period. 
---
like most game devs, ubisoft doesnt have a focus on improving the existing game or features.  they focus mainly on whats next not what is, because thats what draws in more new players and sales. its just the meta, a shame. not saying they dont work on the existing content, they definitely do but lets be real operation health only came once and thats when sales dropped and the game almost died out
---
I actually don't know how to speak German just used a Google translator and butchered it but you get the gist lmao
---
Should try R6STeams not here.
---
What, The Iron Knight? That's the only volvo truck I can think of.
---
Well no matter who you queue with there will be times where you are useless and your teammates are useless, no matter what there is something you can learn from it
---
Got a feeling its photoshopped, everything looks weird. Oh and in 1 pic hes level 12
---
Yes.  The question is, why can you got shot through three walls and not a tiny shelf support?
---
nice
---
This is possibly the best thing that I've ever seen on this sub, maybe even the website. You're the first person I've ever wanted to give gold to, but I'm a broke bastard and far too cheap to follow through.

I hope that they put that in. If they don‚Äôt rework Lion, at least give him a direct counter other that Mute

Got one of my first aces like this except I killed a chanka roamer first and then killed the last 4 on obj with a single charge. It wasnt a great moment, I just empty inside afterwards lol
---
Seems like you and your wife have super  bad luck. I occasionally get a string of matches with tkers and vote kickers but its on a really rare occasion. And I play on Xbox which I think is the more toxic of the two consoles.
---
It wouldn't be utilized enough to warrant the effort of putting it in, I promise you.
---
ive never seen a blitz that didnt flash every engagement they got into
---
Cause you‚Äôre toxic 
---
Because some people hate fun
---
wow..time goes by *very* quick...i fell old
---
that would be pretty neat  Id have to say . I do love me the mira soft wall peak 
---
Because it is useless having 90% of the community being toxic. Devs put that option because even they know the community is toxic
---
Honestly, you have no clue how it works. In terms of file size, it goes "Movies&gt;Textures&gt;Models&gt;Audio" and everything else is negligible at like a tenth the size of the models alone.
---
I could program a realistic physics simulator down to the molecular level, and it'd be a smaller file size. It'd just take up an absurd amount of processing power.
---
Like pengu said, he should still be able to see the yellow just not the surroundings like peeking through smoke he wouldnt see the couch in front of him. Only the yellow. That would balnce him out pretty fairly in my opinion.
---
You don't have the answers sway!!
---
I know but at least give us some option to report for cheating or something rather than just toxic behaviour.
---
That's why I said thank you, I genuinely appreciate it. I was just letting you know that I knew I made a mistake, that's all
---
Once you get all the ops you stop caring about renown.

This is what mental health issues look like
---
I'm a simple man. I see maestro, I upvote 
---
Yea I know. Whenever I play custom games my friends ban blitz so I don't give them PTSD or some shit like that. That's when I pull out my Trump card (Glaz).
---
That‚Äôs the thing. When shooting lvl 2 armors (by far the most common attacker type) you do 90% of your base damage. For a P90 with extended barrel that base will always be 22, but 90% of 22 is 19.8. So it should round up to 20 and thus a 5 shot kill, but I have no one to test that in game. 
---
Impact 'Nade intesifies
---
I literally did my entire Spanish packet a few minutes ago using the same strategy you did. It works 
---
Agreed on separate forms of reporting being needed - ‚ÄúToxic Behaviour‚Äù is too broad, and while it‚Äôs useful for combatting general misdemeanours, I doubt it brings Ubi‚Äôs attention to issues such as M&amp;K.
---
yea lol i was jk im not trying to offend ur nephew lol
---
Yooo same! My 2 most played attackers ar blitz and glaz! There's a large margin between them though, glaz is alot more hours played 
---
Almost like that‚Äôs me.
---
This looks a lot like Mr Homeless hax.
---
Oh for sure, I've watched a couple Youtube videos about it now and it seems that the only way to get anything really done is to send video proof to Ubisoft. That shouldn't have to happen.
---
Sadly I don't think this will be the case. As tired as I am of seeing an operator spam crouch and lean across a corner, it won't be fixed before Invitationals. Definitely after though.
---
I just think of last year and how Ela wasn't nerfed throughout the entirety of the Invitational and such because "it would interfere too much with the meta."
---
What do you play on?
---
I think in outbreak he had frags as well
---
What map?
---
How he do that
---
Glad he died hate tree house campers

No what platform

To get even more you could just place mute jammers and then pick them up and place and continue etc if someone said this and I missed it sorry

That's fair. Is spawn peeking as much of a problem on your side of the fence? 
---
Revenge of the drones
---
Whattt. It‚Äôs just an ordinary Dok OH MY GOODNESS
---
I mean I have some deep hatred for this game too but how the fuck is it like battlefield. 
---
How is this game battlefield? 
---
This is not the best post that it could be
---
there u go again using the pro league as argument no game should only get changed do to pro play.
---
and about ur examples the example that u used for kapkan is too situational and if u wanna talk so much about pro's, a pro could still look at the door when he has little time and ur forgetting there are so many counters to kapkan. and about glaz it is unfair the fact that he can see u through a smoke while u cant see him and that the only thing u can do is either shoot randomly and  get lucky or through a nitro which not all ops have.
---
You can hate it but we don‚Äôt have to. How is it a copy of Battlefield at all?
---
People still do spawn peak, my aim is pretty decent so I can do it. The only true difference I see with PC is some guns suck ass cheeks because of their recoil, like Ela,Hibana, and buck ( I can use his AR but some can‚Äôt)
---
It's similar but the problem of R6 is their glitches, user moderation, BUGISOFT, etc.
---
Just like me, trying to help thatcher with beaching charges on a reinforced wall like a dumbass. It took around 5 matches to realize, what thermite is meant for...
---
Or give Kap, Frost, and Ela the same icon ability.
---
I was gonna make a Buck joke but I couldn't really land my shot
---
nice.

Thanks also I only started playing a lot in grim sky I bought the game in Chimera

Really that works?? I thought it didn't give you point for picking it up and putting it back. Neat-o

Sexual Harassment is normal in this fucking game, and Ubisoft did nothing about it.

I actually feel bad for you

its ok they have the cootie pass
---
I always thought a "prop hunt" or "infected" mode would be fun in RB6. One person and 8+ drones, the drones can only stay still for 10 seconds and if they die they turn into a human and continue the hunt
---
The post is as shitty as fucking Rainbow6
---
Wow alright man, no need to be toxic. There is no reason to bring the pistol, the reason they are making the smg full auto is so she is more viable when she is the last alive. 
---
Her being able to bring both her guns and the shield would be like the black ops 2 perk. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair. Just cause she is a shield doesn‚Äôt mean she is ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù So if she gets both guns and the shield then the other shields should get the same treatment. 
---
Give MONT and BLITZ an AK.
---
Hey, it's just a fucking copy, hang BUGISOFT, HAIL HITHER!
---
The game is very well made and I‚Äôm also a huge Battlefield fan. The two are definitely not alike whatsoever. R6 is full of jackasses but the game itself is amazing and full of content.
---
Lucky bastard

To kick players

that escalated quickly

Also you can obly affect a drone 4 times before getting zero points

I agree but Bugisoft should increase it's content moderators because A LOT OF ILLEGAL CONTENT IS PLAYED ON THAT GAME.

I'm scared

lol mad cuz bad

It's a fps but other than that I don't see how it's similar to bf at all.

Yes because BOGISOFT = SHITTTTTTY SHIT. HAIL HITHER! HITHER DID NOTHING WRONG.
---
I went back to the original post, and I say kudos to you for actually keeping your word. :)

Not illegal but there is a lot of bull crap that should be dealt with soon.

Nice username OP! I can already hear the Montreal accented clip of ‚Äúoperation health‚Äù

how to fly as demonstration man

What happened to get you so mad? 
---
I like hostage because it brings something new to the table (i.e. don't just shoot at everything, extracting can be hard, etc.)
---
But tower brings nothing. Even now that I know the layout, it's just a nonsensical maze of indestructible walls and similar-looking rooms.
---
Spinning fan? The bird feeder with the squirrel is much better 
---
Then you need to find a OP who does you well and you‚Äôre consistent with, don‚Äôt play a wide variety sick to 2 on attack and 2 on defense ( 2 so you have a backup if one is picked ) 
---
Depends on what operators your teammates pick really. If there's no hard breacher just pick Maverick. If there's too many roamers, pick an anchor. Etc.

Please never stop posting these vids, they're so good lol

"CANCEL AND RESTART QUEUE"

im the problem right, not the game? already spent over an hour trying that, which is why i restart the game entirely now and verify integrity of files. nothing works. fresh install too
---
Yes but Bugisoft is terribad.
---
Dude I'm sorry but this is not a normal adult reaction to whatever has gone on, if you or your gf is being abused in game, go through the proper channels and report it, don't forget there's probably hundreds of reports every minute, they'll get to yours in due time

At least I'm not a FUCKING SEXUAL RAPER LIKE YOU! FUCKER. SON OF A BITCH.

Just a normal day in rb6 siege. nothing special tbh

yeah you could be right, as there‚Äôs no proof of it being virtual reality

Good drawing but ya kinda posted it sideways
---
That system would be meaningless. First of all, accidently teamkilled for 2 times or more in one single match is pretty rare. Secondly, if u kill a hostile or finish the round just after that teamkill , system at present would automatically regard it as an accident. And the most important thing, what if that guy choose "no" ? Should system name u as toxic and kick u out immediately just in order to prevent further harm to ur teammates ?

I saw the reference was found but nevertheless..

The operator idea itself is beyond retarded and even worse than Lion.
---
Durrr he tanks a ludicrous amount of damage and two headshots oh and he blows himself up!!
---
This is a tatical shooter, an operator that blows himself up is something Call of Duty would add- not siege.

Sledge finka and buck

How? o.o
---
&gt;The operator idea itself is beyond retarded
---
Relax. It's not an even an operator and not going to be.
---
I think thatcher is pretty useful with all the electronics now in the game. Useless I'd say maybe ash or cav/vigil? They are good at their job and people play them a lot but they lack a lot of utility that other ops could bring. 
---
Assuming you win all 20, that‚Äôs incredibly unlikely for some be to get 0 kills every game and still win all 20. This is probably a common argument you eat but: put a level 180 copper four versus a level 180 diamond against each other and I almost bet my life that the diamond will win.

If you meant Bartlett... I loved barlett... got my first ace there...

That‚Äôs a race truck, they make all sorts of semi trucks, if you‚Äôre on an interstate and don‚Äôt see a Volvo truck you‚Äôre lying.
---
I have no idea if this could be a real solution or if anyone has mentioned it before, but what if after someone gets teamkilled the player who just died gets a little pop up on the corner of their screen (like vote to kick) where you can either report the teamkill or not and if that player gets reported for teamkilling more than once they get a ban

Seriously though it fucking scared me , that shit has a mind of its own sometimes it's stuck in the floor and it blows you up and the last thing you see are two explosions from silence to big bang , sometimes you fuze somewhere and it goes across the plane .
---
I am never fuzing plane ever again .
---
The fact that anyone can get the highest achievable rank in the game after a few hours of playing is bad, proves that you just need to get lucky enough to win 20 ima row and you‚Äôre either mid plat1 or diamond
---
No game should be like that ever
---
Why would you bet your life on that? The copper could‚Äôve dropped since no level 180 is legit copper 
---
3, master, kids, "construction" room which is obviously a bedroom under remodel. Workout could easily be converted into a 4th if so desired.
---
I do like to keep a reinforcement on certain maps, like Oregon. You can use it to reinforce a cycle route late it the match. 
---
It feels like call of duty because you‚Äôre playing like call of duty, you‚Äôre choosing to not play a certain way
---
You would be surprised... I have seen a level 220 copper who played like a copper in casual. I could tell he was playing like a copper becuase his movements were just so slow and he seemed clueless about he sounds around him
---
AH SHOOT. SHE EVEN MENTIONED IT IN HER OPERATOR VIDEO.
---
I am currently going through and purchasing all Y1 ops with renown and I am down to Buck and Echo. I will be buying Buck first because I am in a pattern of buying one from defenders and then one from attackers and I just got Cav. Cav might be my favorite purchase so far but all are great. 
---
But when I play skyscraper like Oregon or bank... I always die and we lose because the map rewards highly aggressive gameplay. And Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt like aggressive gameplay. Also I want to mention that roaming on that map is nearly useless
---
Hmmm
---
In Oregon it skyscraper
---
r/UnexpectedFlash
---
But the reason I hate skyscraper so much is becuase it doesn‚Äôt play like the other maps, it is only rewarding to one play style while other maps reward all play styles
---
It looks like it‚Äôs from Snapchat

I actually use [Plays.tv](https://Plays.tv) and I have it set to record the last 3 minutes when I hit a keybind. I tried to use shadowplay, or whatever it's called now but I would occasionally have issues with the sound not recording. Started using Plays and it works pretty well
---
Same thing still happened to me. Can't hear drone jumping then everything will almost reverse. So I need to throw 1 round on ranked just to restart the client then teammates will blame me lol.  
---
Where was fuze
---
I thought that this was the predator for a sec... then I thought that would be an awesome skin, so you get a win win either way 
---
Who even gave you such misinformation?
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm just leaning it towards the fact that Rook‚Äôs Armor has a 100% success rate. I use Echo from time to time and I already learned all ins and outs of him, but since my squad usually runs a roamer-heavy setup (that‚Äôs also often the case with randoms), extra survivability is simply more beneficial for us.

I mean with a bandit Is powerful

It‚Äôs almost like it just started lol if you‚Äôre scared to lose you don‚Äôt need to join

I love this. is he a defender or an attacker?

Its not a realism argument its a game rule argument. The game rules about destruction is that softwalls like dry walls and wood can be shot through while metal will stop your bullet.

He's dedicated support. We don't want thatchers fragging out instead of helping Thermite and Hibana open the walls.

Same lol
---
Baited
---
I got black ice for the m1014 on my second ever alpha pack, problem is I hate that gun
---
Same problem here.   
---
Basically the sound you hear will come to the opposite side of your ear. Then you could hear things so far.

---
Well he's French,  so I thought it was Lee-on too??
---
Thanks, it was an idea I played around with for a while and he is an attacker. I honestly can't believe I left that part out.
---
Ubisoft is going to tik tok now to leak stuff.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 5 legendaries in my two years of playing and 3 of them were the angel trinket
---
I guess you could say you got baited?
---
turn down framerate, there's a bunch of stuff, spend some time looking into it, it isn't that hard
---
streamlabs for OBS works great, too
---
And Jackie chan

Only when Vigil‚Äôs cloak is active. Remember, Vigil‚Äôs ERC-7 can‚Äôt stop the echolocation, but it potentially can prevent EE-1-D from telling Lion where **Vigil** is exactly.
---
*in stunning 240p*
---
Thermite most useful, (trigger warning) maverick most useless
---
Dont advertise some thing as a way to make thousands of dollars if it just started.
---
That‚Äôs like a 1 in 3,80,005 chance 
---
they tried to reinforce the door and then it fell
---
ahahaha I read it over and over just to make sure I wasn't retarded xd.
---
I read some of the feedback others had given and honestly, even as an ash doc main, I can totally see myself playing this op. last bit is how his gun handles. any ideas on dmg and firerate so far?
---
I call him Alex
---
Because Lion Alex
---
That ain‚Äôt it Chief
---
Thats so great.
---
I think that's what the title is referencing haha
---
That‚Äôs how advertising works, you really don‚Äôt need to join if you don‚Äôt want. Just keep going on your way 
---
:(
---
I was about to hit 't' to type "lmao" jeez
---
The best part was that I (Sledge) was trying to bait my friend (Blitz who took the screenshot) into falling over the edge of the building. I fazed through him after he made it up and then I slipped over the side. Ash was just coming to help and made the same mistake as I did lol
---
I heard my teammate call him fat otaku

Now impact them

Hibana or Buck are my favorites.

or you could read the sub rules before you post something dumb. quit looking for handouts. you didn‚Äôt play during the time of release so you shouldn‚Äôt get it. get lost 
---
GIGN
---
U done?
---
This is how bad starter edition is. 800 hours and still do not own all ops
---
Smoke has the best op video hands down
---
Oops my bad. Sadly I don‚Äôt see her played that often so I tend to forget about her.
---
You are SO lucky you survived the flash of the devil himself. I swear everytime i see a blitz charging at me at close range it feels like a horror game getting chased by a metahuman with a blinding device awaiting your inevitable death. It's scary... *flashbacks*
---
Do u even play siege??? Jager acog?
---
I got a red fucking duck as my first legendary.....
---
Yeah okay basically no need too self promote 
---
how did you get so many lmao
---
Or "An unmanned aerial vehicle which uses four fans that converts rotational motion into thrust and can be attached to the upper interface of a room."?
---
This would be a great and fun idea if everyone was a nice and honest person. 1.There would be too many hackers in this game and 2. Ubi doesnt make money from it. 
---
r/ihadastroke but not quite. You had me right up until that last part where my brain went ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù But it‚Äôs intelligible for the most part so I‚Äôll slide you a pass on this.
---
oh again one of those posts! so cool! --.-.-. not!
---
1. Always

2.when i bought him i played the ussr anthem and shot aimlessly and that was the most fun i had in the game ever
---
Epic gamer

Castle is shit
---
The nerf isn‚Äôt a nerf, it‚Äôs a buff, can 2 shot down from longer distances now
---
discord.gg/rainbow6
---
Gonna have to go with:
---
1. Smoke
---
2. Sledge
---
3. Mute
---
4. Thatcher
---
This doesnt mean mute and thatcher are bad, its just that if i had to rank them, id put them like this.
---
Ok chill asshole
---
In the now? Or all time?
---
All Time? Smoke, no questions.
---
Now? Mute.
---
Get to know it better then youll enjoy it. The top floor needs some work but the rest is good. 
---
Kaid
---
Nothing. MnK is the new meta in console R6S. 
---
I'd say Mute and Thatcher for their gadget denying capabilities. But in general they're all good operators.
---
Top floor is a funnel of death honestly. The other floors are like a maze which is good.
---
Tbf it‚Äôs just a getout clause for when they fuck up in Ranked.
---
I've mained as every operator at one point or another. I do good for a bit, but my skills die off after about a week. Ever since this was implemented, it's kept me on my toes. That said, I am bad at the game in general.
---
Noice.
---
Massive respect.
---
He *is* The Toxic Babe
---
a lotta power
---
Homie it's year 3 right now. Year 4 is yet to start.
---
Thats that unique .44 pistol in Fallout 4 which I forgot the name lol
---
Yup. Sucks that you can‚Äôt change it either :(
---
Don't ever place CoD and R6S so close again
---
It‚Äôs not cheating. If a pro rainbow player, playing on PC had a better mouse or computer than others it‚Äôs not cheating, it‚Äôs choosing the best input method.

I mean you did ask for it. I know you‚Äôre going to expect these comments but if you knew the stakes, why did you keep going, what made you want to be toxic?

Ohh right. Well i dont mind i still like the way i do it. Adds replayablity

He's right at this time.

They say it to get this exact reaction out of you. Just stop letting people on a video game tilt you that badly. 
---
Yes give me the toxicity! I must consume. 
---
Can relate to that's , it's better keeping it like that , than never delivering a promise you couldn't make.

Looooooooool

Lmao I definitely think we've played before :3 essssketit

GG EZ

Lul i didst see that, I'm retarded

RUSSIAN BADGER!
---
Ok
---
Thanks
---
A fast firing shotgun to catch enemies off guard or a gun with literally no recoil. Not to mention the choice of the USG or the Meusoc. I think they‚Äôre pretty nice guns.
---
What
---
I posted this a while ago on the sub, it‚Äôs a new artwork design
---
This is meant to be a joke dw it takes more than that to tilt me
---
i7 and i5 are both quad cores (before 8th Gen), but i7 has 8 threads which isn't equal to 8 cores.
---
Basically he can reach 100% easily there aswell.
---
Your CPU should never be 100% on siege, since that will cause you a lot of problems, like mouse delay , stutter and more.
---
It's a lottery to be fair, some can play with uncapped fps and have moderate CPU usage, but some get the 100% CPU , even with the same hardware and are forced to cap their fps.
---

Fuck. I thought this was a post in the battlefield V reddit lmao.... ignore what I said

Woah everyone‚Äôs name has their main next to it, how do I do that?

See? Now you have a good reason to stick to it.

GG EZ
---
If they rework it this room needs to stay. 
---
Happy cake day 
---
you just gotta lose some weight my guy
---
For R6 credits ubi might do it
---
In my experience, whoever got POTG gets all of the commendations, and not the healer who was keeping the whole team alive
---
Im 130 and have maybe received one legendary and a few epics, nothing more.
---
It's heavily based on map knowledge and intel.
---
The thing you see here was mostly a combination of luck and the enemy team's incompetence, but couldn't have done it without knowing where in the room you are below.
---
For fck sake..my baby bandit needs a blackice
---
Or it actually was, maybe it was beaulo in disguise, ready to carry the game if he needed to. But in the end just didn't need to do anything to win.
---
Unlike OP I‚Äôm not saying a super tank suicide bomber should be added, I‚Äôm just saying that it would be interesting to see characters from ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù groups used. But as somebody previously said this would never happen is siege so the whole debate is pretty pointless anyway
---
Kaid can get 3 adjacent walls with a single Wand of Lightning Bolt.
---
Bandit can get the remaining walls and stairs with his portable charger.
---
It‚Äôs like you know me! 
---
Yes, this is with a lot of things I noticed. I am on pubg exactly where you are now in RB6, and it is the reason I got this game actually.  
---
I used to be 3.0 kd for seasons in a row then last season I am on a 1.5 tops. 
---
Same goes for instruments, I play guitar and you will reach a "ceiling". The trick (with instruments at least) is grinding through it and "breaking" your skill ceiling.
---
Like others suggested maybe take a break for the game or break through it by just grinding, is what works for me at least.
---
Dude I didn't even have to see it I died laughing just reading this. I need to get Nomad just for that. 
---
Why tf am i always so unlucky with this kind of crap?
---
Why is echo the only character with a good backstory? Seriously he graduated with a degree in robotics and is super lazy so he built yokai to scout the map for him
---
Still would like the shield tho. ü§£
---
, –¥—Ä—É–≥ 
---
Congratulations you played yourself 
---
3? I was under the impression he could get 2 at most
---
lesion.
---
So im just unlucky af..
---
"Try hard" and intentionally doing stuff thats screwing with the team's chances to win are two very different things.
---
Playing the game just to enjoy it is also the reason why its called Casual and if you go around shooting teammates for childish reasons like this, thats screwing with the enjoyment part.
---
Not to mention you issuing teamkills also making it not-fun for the opposition as they won't have a full team to provide a challenge.
---
Also not everyone wants to play ranked, or wants to play ranked for the very reasons of wanting to play for enjoyment or not wanting to "try hard". (In my case I even can't play Ranked due ubisoft support is shitting on my ticket about 2-step verification not working.)
---
BTW on the matter of bans I've been talking about something more than soft-bans for you if that really is the mentality you present in the game, that means you are one of the reasons why every day we see posts about toxic players and trolls.
---
The drones are there to use them, they've got tactical purpose and you go around shooting teammates because you are dumb enough to not see that purpose and understand players who take advantage of the things provided by the game. Somehow I've got the feeling you're one of those guys who take advantage of the exploiting of the network code and use prefiring and desync to get through Mont's shield. If so thats making you a hypocrite besides being a douche for teamkills, because you judge others based on that they use proper gameplay mechanics while you use allowed exploits.
---
phat boi
---
Where do you get the ‚Äòexternal hardware could be‚Äô from? All he says is that it‚Äôs not supported yet.
---
I just bought paddle attachments for my controller and put crouch on it 
---
Yeah, like it took them nearly 3 years to add basic text and voice mute buttons. Something that should have been in the game before release.
---
GG EZ SKILLS
---
OBESITY
---
I mix up fuze and pulse all the time for some reason 
---
Is this actual pvp hours or steam hours?
---
Steam logs afk in menu as hours aswell.
---
It depends where you put it, you have to be on the side of it to shoot it out so put it down a long corridor where people will be, it‚Äôll probably get shot out quickly yes but it‚Äôll give you that extra information. 
---
It mentions a playlist. So not a gamemode, but just a map playlist.
---
If defending boats I often smash a few Windows on all floors of control room and rotate between Windows/loading dock if attackers are pushing the North entrance. When someone is sitting back watching the windows from Dock Stairs and i can't get a shot I'll usually run out of machine hallway and get a free shot because they're watching Windows/loading dock.
---
I'd guess it's mostly Sony, Microsoft doesn't have any incentive to not allow it as they virtually have complete control over the PC side of things as well.
---
I love how all the Montys start throwing their smokes as soon as they are locked in lol
---
I don't really have the money to be spending on a better controller just to compete with people who are cheating.
---
Not if he's trying to improve in-game. With people not having an unfair advantage.
---
 Sure it's "only a game" but isn't everything "only *insert hobby*"?
---
D
---
Bring in Mute and mute the fuck out them
---
Right. Like maybe view some cases that are already completed and you need to be tested on whether you can submit an accurate verdict. Maybe 10 faux reports or something on old cases from the previous season/operation and your verdict/conviction ratio will determine whether you can participate at first.
---
How i deal with people being toxic i tell them jokes or i just say weird shit and tell them to vent their anger on the enemies and win us the round usally that stops them 
---
All 17 comments said Lesion...
---
Forgot to switch accounts?
---
Uh so where did all that time go lmao
---
Well, yeah but that is mostly because Kaid‚Äôs loadout is garbage, especially on console. However I do agree that it speaks of how the community thinks of these two ops as a whole. 
---
Damn I thought I answered the first comment ... Embarrassing ..
---
Get Gu'd
---
I guess it‚Äôs queue times, in between round times,, loading times it really adds up. 
---
That‚Äôs the point. 
---
So is fortnite
---
It says more of Kaid‚Äôs need for a buff, but Lesion is still very very good.
---
What does he call drones? Long black sticks...
---
Reeeeeee
---
Enter the gungeon
---
Legend has it that Montagne is still trapped in there to this day.
---
The drones go marching one by one hoorah...hoorah..
---
Ah okay. Does that work only with the smaller walls, or full-size as well?
---
I used to confuse Glaz and Fuze 
---
I‚Äôve been saying this since I joined.  I sucked when I first played, and now my K/D is stuck at 0.8, when it really should be around 1.3 for this season.
---
So many people forget that those reinforcements don''t actually exist until the animation finishes. You can shoot "through" them while they're still going up.
---
Technically he's not wrong cause it's been used in the pro leagues with Mira (or ops with c4) on certain maps.
---
Damascus Steel or SPQR
---
Had something likes this happen to me a while ago. A teammate reinforced the wall and somehow he flipped like 90 degrees through the ground and after he was done, the reinforced wall just flipped over from the ground to the position where it should have been.
---
But no heal manüòî
---
The only time terrorists' flinches are nice is when you're out of ammo, which means you can take cover as they don't shoot back at you since they've been flinched by your shot. (in case you missed your last bullet or something)
---
Big con there is that it absolutely doesn't reflect multiplayer, if you fail, the opponent would most likely punish you for that. (unless he fails too xd)
---
I would never play it 
---
It is not a unrelated and/or unreal post. It was just a question from a new player :) But thank you for your answer \^\^
---
Read it where :o ?
---
I got the Fucking unicorn 
---
It's time for operation health 2.0!
---
This is "The Stance"!! ( -_-)__/ _/
---
Gg ez
---
Maybe one of them will get down a vent without glitching back up it.
---
Guessing March 5th, thats when the pre-order skin becomes unobtainable and the next day they release the new operation. Same thing happened last year.
---
Invisible man? You mean drax the destroyer right
---
&gt;and use it occasionally
---
lol

I see people saying this unironically on reddit
---
Me and recruit trying to find a way into the garage wall after thermite entered through the outside of the map and got rape by cav
---
His shotgun is autistcly good on PC, there's like no recoil and 2 shots in the chest, for that alone I'd take him over Lesion lmao
---
Thanks, I want to make a season-style post (operation name, map, etc) with Hunter being the attacker and the defending operator being this one I made a while ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9u6xxo/haze\_new\_operator\_idea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9u6xxo/haze_new_operator_idea/)
---
Around March 5th, that's 2 weeks after the Invitational. 
---
Lesion/Echo/Maestro on defence.
---
Hibana on attack.
---
Ah cheers guys
---
1. Maybe so, but so is playing the game itself, technically.
---
2. Melodramatic.
---
3. Shaming people for "underperforming" due to them being on the bottom of a leaderboard is, if nothing else, gatekeeping of the highest order. You're basically saying that if someone bottom-frags, they should be ashamed of themselves, which is laughably untrue. When I end up at the bottom of the leaderboard, you know what I feel? Apathy. I don't care, because it's just a game, and instead of feeling bad when I don't do well, I enjoy feeling satisfaction when I do well.
---
Oh, and P.S. it's four fuckin letters. Considering how people get around the word filters, I think you've got more things to worry about than GG EZ.

Comment

UPDATE:  
---
It's gone, the prooduct has been removed and I will never receive my credits. I got a full refund but this... this is bulshit. I spent a lot of time and was struggling and couldnt play the game for a good while and I don't get shit.

Well, fuck.

Too slow, no nades
---
Meh I'm more for Vape Lord
---
To a point I agree, but where's the line drawn? People will just come up with new shit to piss people off, getting more and more strict with a word filter that doesn't actually affect the gameplay itself (since it comes at the end of it all) is kind of dumb.
---
Eh, seems like you‚Äôre just wooshing people cause you read the word wrong and don‚Äôt wanna look dumb. 
---
Le
---
Inanely OP*
---
Consoles have a different meta , usually they won't use acogs because they get in the way in CQB, and the majority of the players will hard a hard time aiming because it's an analog stick.
---
Reddot isn't my first choice when using 1x scope, but it's way better than it was before, and at the current state it's a fine choice.
---
L
---
The thing is i do grind on casual but i still dont get them
---
My broda's brodas's broda :(
---
By abnormally huge I meant all 16GB of your RAM... 2GB is normal
---
cuz ACOG gud
---
&gt;Im going in  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
---
&gt;**GOOOOO**
---
The second they pull out the pistol to destroy the gu, they are dead, since they will just use it as a bait.
---
Buck for a new player isnt that good tho
---
*Thatcher
---
Guess your aim needs some more training
---
You have never heard of GPA? I'm English but I hear Americans refer to it all the time.
---
As much as I'd be irritated that I couldnt see my performance and be happy with that, it would probably take a weight off my shoulder knowing I dont have something to maintain every night.
---
Guess so
---
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  BLYAT"
---
or he could have just used the drone
---
Silvers talking dont mind em
---
Also I flubbed the title :( Thanks for the updoots guys!
---
Maybe later down the line, I don't think it's necessary right now.
---
had a lot of matches where people after every round and sometimes after every kill wrote "ez". It's just pathetic. Yeah, i turned off text chat, but thats not the solution for the problem, it's just a workaround imho.
---
Now im waiting for a liveleak video of an arabian man trying to science, only to explode and credit card through a window
---
Because they don't need to keep lying. Reporting for toxic behaviour already doesn't do anything.
---
Para bellum had a few good ones, and the gingerbread one was good but yeah the rest were trash. 
---
Now this is epic.
---
I don't know why they didn't just revamp Bartlett to be more pvp friendly. Moving a few windows, adding another door on the alley side, adding more clutter cover, etc. It's so much better than Favela. 
---
Actually his weapon got nerfed thr last update but he is such a great defender all around u can do everything with him roam or play anchor 
---
He's always been one of the best defenders. Easily one of the best intel gadgets. Only one or two direct counters
---
no
---
Nope
---
He's a bloody battering ram thats what he is!
---
A floor reinforcement utility  would be kind of cool for a future operator to have in the game. Obviously you'd only have 2 and you'd have to be highly selective when placing them as they wouldn't cover a large area.
---
Yes, glaz is broken.  You probably just haven't seen him at a decent level of play.
---
As far as they said the auto pick is random so u just getting unlucky men
---
Honey Badger AR 
---
It always happens for me, a headshot being blocked by a limb or hand. And, how would a collat ve unreal and dumb?
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about playing Lesion every round..... 
---
Sucks
---
Sucks, hope they do more in the future 
---
Is should be like this:
---
* women with cam
---
* man with poison grenade
---
* man with cloak for drones
---
* man with Wall-hack
---
Well i font get why myluck has been bad for like 94% off thise games
---
I just wish they'd calm down with these huge, hard to learn maps and fix hitreg.
---
Finka and Kapkan. He gave finka her scar on her face. 
---
Attack: FBI ops (Ash if you're aggressive, Thermite if you're more reserved and methodical)
---
Defense: Rook (anchor) and Jager (roamer)
---
yeah it was all Moroccan.. boring wood and yellow orange colors. i wish we got some variety every season 
---
I can't be the only one missing lesion from release, when his smg actually had some pretty good kick first 4-5 bullets you needed to handle. Since the recoil changes the fun is literally a laser over huge distances, also the loading of the gus being reduced... Meh 
---
God I hate cav, she just goes through shields like they weren‚Äôt there at all.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you mean lore or in game so I‚Äôm going with Thermite and Thatcher because their gadgets have so much synergy. 
---
Okay Blitz is broken on bith side of the spectrum if he works he is disgusting  hood at what he does. But most times he isn't because the shild hit box does nothing to stop melee from FRONT of the sheild.
---
Now monty at his best can't handle the abuse and with the broken sheild Right now i would avoid using him till a later fix. 
---
Can you assign binds in this game? A "Hold (X) for coward's way out" could be fun
---
This is 10 Armor operator 
---
He actually has Lumbago, it's serious you know.
---
Montagne is in a pretty good place as a whole, blitz needs a bit of tweaking, nothing too crazy and fuze's sheild needs to be adjusted for size just a bit
---
Smoke or any character with C4 or impact nades are counters for shields.
---
Also, I'm not saying he shouldn't exist, but some changes are necessary to a healthy game. For example: making traps more visible, removing indicator, increasing aditional damage timer... 
---
I'm fine with both dude, but I see what you mean. Those two are explosive together.
---
Oh yeah, I love reading about those two. The unspoken respect they have is great.
---
Hello Combateagle1! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
It‚Äôs not that Kaid is bad, it‚Äôs jut that Lesion is REALLY good
---
Either way I dont think that's relevant. If lesion is your first line of information then your team comp is lacking. Lesion mines are not completely invisble either so its possible to clear them with the help of a drone.
---
I haven't noticed any changes, he's always been picked often because he's simply too good. Nerfing his SMG by 2 dmg was pointless and achieved nothing, plus the nerf to Smoke makes him even more desirable. 
---
dude stop are you wanting them to nerf him???
---
He is overpowered. He has too much utility.  Ubisoft could probably remove the impact nades as a first step. 
---

If a bullet from an SMG passes through a hand with gloves and bone, it is extremely unlikely for it to still have enough velocity to pass through a skull. And it would be way too much work to adjust all of the guns' penetration, so keep all guns equal and have zero body penetration. Plus I feel you may be exaggerating, hands are rarely ever even by the head in this game.

Modern problems require modern solutions

Cav wasn't nerfed. The pick rates are a comparison, not a absolute rate.

That‚Äôs the name of a player that died

He died of cancer, so they put him in the game since he was a huge seige fan.

I don‚Äôt know the story so it‚Äôs best to just look it up

Same. Happening since the start of Y3.

Looks nice and matches well with others in the game!

I agree that it's a waste of time, but banning simple letters instead of focusing on the actually offensive and toxic stuff is even more of a waste of time. It's reactions like this that motivate these people, it's easy to ignore these things. 
---
As someone who struggles with anger issues IRL, I get that someone bragging for doing nothing or bragging for  a close game can get annoying, but it just needs to be ignored. 
---
Not an offensive Easter egg ^^^

Lesion is pretty good

echo is pretty fun, or vigil if you like roaming like cav

Not really appealing if you're only handing out some samples of your work to those who dm you. Why not link your page where your work is showcased?

---

---
Flash grenades, and leaning against a wall will make your operaror raise their hand up to their head. Plus, not all SMGs fire the same kind of bullet. There are types of ammunition designed with penetration in mind. I don't think you understand how much force is behind even a smaller pistol round like 9mm. A glove would hardly interfere with the velocity of a live round, and the bones in your hands are small, and scattered more or less. It's not a solid plate of bone.
---
I think it would be a good chance to do that. It's a very slight nerf which doesn't affect how he is played. 
---
Change the gun to the right one
---
"Lesion is good"
---
-Lesion main, 2019
---
Lightning overhaul made it all worth it. Check out gameplay pre operation health. 
---
It's basically a different game. 
---
Do you have all ops? Likely just a small sample size and confirmation bias.
---
Twitter or?
---
yes
---
Not a subtle glitch then... Classic ubisoft
---
He shouldn't really roam, he's a much more solid anchor. His Gadget is only useful if he stays alive long enough to use it. Roamers usually die much earlier so that's basically wasting a great operator.
---
Idk but I love the username
---
Seems kinda useless
---
Do you see the difference between ash and cav‚Äôs win rate though?
---
Would be nice to have 10 slots to favorite 5 attackers and 5 defenders, and if you don't pick anyone, you will get assigned a random one (that isn't taken yet) of the ones you've favorited.
---
If you favorite less than 5 operators for one side, and all your favorited operators are already picked, then you will just be assigned a random op (like it works now) so there is no harm in it.
---
For what? The playerbases on each platform are big enough and PC players would stomp console players (at least those who don't play mnk).
---
Donald Trump dropping nukes

Thanks!

Unless there a maverick almost all renforcements 
---
Yeah the recoil is bugged on console right now lol
---
I‚Äôm 100% with macie, they‚Äôre meant to be a support role, protecting the team from bullets and all that, but currently they‚Äôre widely used as offensive roles, ADS time should increase and slow down the melee. It‚Äôs a rough nerf, but it‚Äôll place shields where they‚Äôre supposed to be, and much more ‚Äútactical‚Äù
---
Also, the hitboxes needs fixing, and vaulting animations 
---
 Bring back the acog

No its the Orange tint

Don't want to talk too much about him just yet but It's a Attacker that works like Fuze + Smoke
---
It was a nerf, though it doesn‚Äôt change much about how you play Caveira. This nerf is still a good thing nonetheless. 99 damage is way too much, even if there‚Äôs drop-off to consider.
---
If you're attempting to make an argument for why we should not have adjusted Caveira, we do not make balancing changes based on data that is 5 months old.
---
We have also explained the situation with Ash multiple times during AMA's with our designers.

I've been saying this for ages, myself. Just because he isn't flashy doesn't mean he can't be massively overpowered. In his current state, he's just far too good.

It's not. Both ingame stats are lifetime stats.

What's it a slur for?
---
They're everywhere!!
---
Damn right. You got downed, and now you face the consequences.
---
While you try to spot it probably you got a headshot.
---
Hehehe
---
I do understand how powerful a handgun is. And the skull is the thickest bone in the body. If the bullets direction didn't change after collision with multiple bones in the hand, then *maybe* it could penetrate the skull. But that being said, what's stopping the Billie from passing through the hand and going into the body/shoulder? That would be two body shots from one bullet. This would cause huge inconsistencies that would be much more prevalent than not getting a headshot through the hand. Rainbow uses hitscan, so this would be extremely hard and pointless to implement into the game.
---
He deleted his account apparently 
---
Echo is good if you want to try anchoring. Ela is alright for roaming. Frost is really good if you can get used to her fire rate (or use her shotty).

Yes, give me alpha packs for completing matches!!

It‚Äôs pretty early and I read lesion as lesbian
---
This could have easily been you clipping a better teammate 
---
might be on mobile where they like fuckin hide the damn side bar
---
It's because he's simply the best defensive operator in the game. The only operator who beats out what Lesion brings to a team is Caveira..and that's only if you manage to get off an interrogation with her. It helps that his guns and gadget are very easy to use.
---
They all look so happy.
---
It is. Win ratio is seasonal. 
---
I'm only disconnect if people are trolling.
---
‚ÄúThat hurt‚Äù
---
They aren't all bad, but now we aren't getting more than 1 good skin a season, and we aren't getting any fantastic skins like Chupinazo or Onami anymore.
---
1/3 skins are good vs take a look at the ones in the picture where pretty much every one was fantastic, creative, and explosive with design instead of a simple pattern wherever that pattern looks good or not.
---
Lmao wow I‚Äôve never seen anything like that in siege 
---
*Every Caveira main cries out in anger*
---
Nah. It‚Äôs not considered as an interaction.
---
The actual nerf is the recoil and mag size. The damage drop off model actually improves the mid range shots-to-down count and the closest ranges remain unchanged still requiring 2 shots to down. The longest ranges 30m+ will require more shots, but being in that situation with her is rare in my experience. From what see, the recoil increase is really the only noticeable nerf.  
---
Thanks! Clears everything up.
---
It's ironic that it says discussion at the top and then the entire post is about how only a select group of people can have an opinion on something. I think what you are looking for is an echo chamber OP, not a discussion.
---
Cuz that's how you get prefired
---
What if there is two of people like you on a team?
---
Hahah okay. Cheers for the discussion
---

Great comment
---
Thanks for your comment but for example compensator reduces the recoil most but I am not good enough to spray through the long distances,generally I try to burst fire,but compensator makes it harder.
---
You deserve an opinion becuase you have been able to hit a high level of play on a console. The only reason PC players look better is becuase an MK plat looks better than a controller plat. You deserve and opinion in my eyes. Thank you for your response and enjoy the rest of your day

I will :D

Why thanks
---
I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt my sure what to flair it, thank you for your response and enjoy the rest of your day
---
You're right. But I think It would be good as a first step to remove them just to see if it makes a difference, then if not they can nerf his GUs. Remember when he was first introduced he was not picked often. 
---
They buffed the GUs with reduced cool-down which changed his pickrate significantly. 
---
I'm confused by this question. Are you saying that Cavs pistol should do more damage at very long ranges?
---
She got a range buff to a 2 shot at 20m or less

So it looks like PC Bronze? I don't get your point. 
---
All stuff aside I am surprised I got downvoted, people on Reddit don't understand how downvoted work(not blaming you).
---
To the point, Ubi did come far with the game, they had a 2nd chance and revived it, yet lately they did a lot of mistakes and almost blew the game away , the decision with the china censorship would have happened if we our thoughts didn't go viral.
---
They are way behind a lot of other games and focus on the side stuff and not main aspects, they continue pushing overpriced loot boxes that are locked behind limited availability and cost a lot. They still classify ranked as BETA and we're in year 4 already.
---
Patches introduce a lot of old bugs and new bugs, and most of the client sided stuff go out of hand, this season client side debris is way off, you see doors closed left and right yet people go through them.
---
Ubi has a gem in their hands, if not for siege,I would have forgot what kind of company is Ubisoft, since their games lost their old magic to me , siege still remains, yet they don't know how to proceed, everything they so is pretty slow.
---
Alright! Thanks for that raw data. Is it ok to use the red dot though? I only use it on TWO weapons, though: Lesion's SMG and the M12 (and even then not often do I use the M12 as opposed to the shotgun). Also, do the sights have, like, stats? ADS time or bullet hitbox or anything?
---
*Pull!*
---
Hitboxes are fine, connections issues are more likely. Make some videos maybe
---
Also gold 1s tend to be good players some of the time so I can tolerate gold 1s

Hello BleedingRevenge, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aj1tbu/i_fixed_my_100_cpu_usage_bug_heres_how/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So they were better when they were easier to notice?
---
Check for airsoft gun, they make a spaz.
---
I don't think it is appropriate to compare Kaid to Lesion at this point as Kaid is still in his early release phase, he's bound to get buffed in some way in the near future. Same thing for Lesion, he's definitely better than average and the only adjustment happened to him was merely a -2 damage which is irrelevant as his gun wasn't even the root problem to begin with.
---
People keep saying you can see and find these gu mines, ya it's true to some degree, but can you find them all in you way? You can't, you will always miss out a several due to time limitation and drone vulnerability. And you were probably playing against people who throw Gu right at door step making them so easy to spot. Also, don't be like "Oh then just bring an IQ, problem solved." A specialized solution is never a solution to a problem because this creates pick rate stalemate, if people pick Lesion a lot, then people pick IQ a lot, and if people don't pick Lesion a lot, then people pick IQ relatively less. This is never a good thing happened to a game that requires balance, everything should be independently balanced not mutually dependent balanced. In other words, things are called balanced such that if they can be countered properly by everyone with effort but countered efficiently as a QOL improvement which is IQ.
---
Whether you think Gu is visible enough or not, it does not matter, it's all about if the majority sees them as a threat or not, also known as his pick rate, I do not have statistics to back this up, you probably can find out through pro league pick rate summary, but I do believe he was picked more frequently than the others significantly, he was picked totally for his gadget, not his gun, not his 2 armor 2 speed, not his cargo shorts, not his impact nades, and therefore we can draw conclusion that his pick rate is highly associated with his gadget alone. IMO his gadget visibility currently is way too low, you can only see them if you are within 10m, they can only be droned out personally, that info is just way too hard to relay onto someone else as you don't have the exact location, looking down in R6 Siege is extremely dangerous and this is why the Jackal buff was so significant.
---
But I've suggested how things should be adjusted a long time ago, and couldn't get enough attention because there are just too many Lesion main out there to defend this. And I'll leave this on here once again. If you don't wanna read, here is a tl;dr version.
---
**tl;dr - the cloak feature should be changed to ATM monitor style with visibility based on view angle, such that if you drone or prone, you should be able to see it in opaque mode, and if you stand up, it should be cloaked like what it is currently.** 
---

---
Operation health but they actually do something this time
---
Rouge-9 does a great in depth video about each muzzle attachment. It's on his channel, a couple months old. If you're burst firing more than just throwing bullets down range, give flash hider a try.
---
Its still a 2-shot down to the chest at 20m or less. That's insane
---
I‚Äôm sorry but saying any group of people don‚Äôt deserve an opinion is one of the most disgusting things you can say, no matter the context.
---
They're all as high as a fucking kite.
---
Could anyone queue me in on what they say for Ash? I legit never heard what they have said before. Please and thank you. 
---
Its a video game dude... I‚Äôm saying how people shouldn‚Äôt be able to judge game mechanics and map design if they don‚Äôt understand it.
---
IQ doesn't need nades. 
---
But I thank you for your response and I made this post knowing I would get hate back I‚Äôm sorry about what I did and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day
---
Yeah, your luck. I haven‚Äôt found a lobby with more than one mic, &amp; that‚Äôs usually someone screeching on the other end.
---
Lesion is the biggest pain in the ass and is the literal incarnation of toxicity in rainbow. He is my mortal enemy. I can go 10-0 in games w no lesion but if hes there, on my team or opposing, im going 0-(however many rounds it lasts). He's the archnemesis now that cav once was when we were newbies.
---
Ill never purchase him but i understand the appeal. That operator can sell salt like a fuckin morton rep.
---
Its  buck  but his good with frags
---
If you put like that, then I guess. 
---
His SMG is the worst gun in the game, it has the lowest DPS out of any gun. It is very poor. 
---
It has the worst stats of any full auto gun in the game. The only redeeming factor is non existant recoil, but the vast majority of defender SMGs also have very low recoil. It‚Äôs objectively bad with a shitty TTK, and low fire rate, which means it‚Äôs more difficult to go for headshots.
---
Essentially, the range that Cav does good damage in has been increased. She's now strong in mid range. 
---
However, she has also had the maximum falloff distance increased.
---
Whilst the falloff starts later, her pistol now keeps dropping off with distance down to 13 at very long distances.
---
No other pistol has a dropoff curve like that, not even Cav's old pistol which used to stop at 20 at a shorter range. They usually stop dropping off earlier, which is odd when the change was meant to standardise it.
---
Wich one is mute and Wich one is Thatcher?
---
So **that‚Äôs** why he has a helmet on that can‚Äôt stop bullets.
---
##*He is the bullet.**
---
Some people like the way casual is so I left it with a slight change.
---
I agree that ranked should be like pro league and casual like ranked, but due to my previous point, that's why I left it like that.
---
I would still really love to trade.
---
It's more of a I'm using the bathroom my team started it oh no type thing, it doesn't happen often but it happens.
---
The way ELO works is the more games you play the less you win and lose from games, so after about 25 games (including placement) your rank isn't going to change more than a couple places.
---
It's a great option for new players to learn the operators, it's for some good casual fun the game isn't purely competitive.
---
Recruit has to stay in the game because of the Starter Edition on PC, if it wasn't for that I would have liked it removed, but I felt it shouldn't be completely useless for those forced to use him.
---
If you play 6 ranked games you would get about 25,000 score.
---
Dont force a burnout. Youre hurting your mind by doing so, take a break, play something else for now.
---
Tag but my hand is a hot lead travelling at subsonic speed
---
It should absolutely reset after each season.  There are people playing this since launch and your K/D shouldn't be low because you were awful when you started
---
I really like how smug they all are
---
Why can I see vigil?
---
Why lesion is an all round better pick, kiad changes some sites completly but that's just a handful 
---
That not right chief
---
I feel like I can‚Äôt find the perfect sensitivity, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking some advice. I land shots and my kills total is decent, still I feel that I‚Äôm not effective enough with the bullets I shoot. 
---
No, it's just really difficult to use reliably. But after a couple of lucky rounds with it, it's hard for me to go back to the MP5
---
Lmfao you're a cliche. Nothing more. Your rank says nothing about you as a player. It stands for your team and for nothing else. And the fact that you havent even realised that, makes you one of the worst players in that community. Way beyond every copper that likes to dream big and trys to get better. 
---
The guns have the stats not the sights, so choosing 1 sight over another won't effect ADS time or any if that. Everything is a 1x sight except ACOG which is a 2.5x sight which is why the ACOG is the best! The Red Dot Sight has the largest casing with the smallest screen so you can miss an enemies head or a trap with it being equipped. Not something you would directly notice but it's best to ditch the sight. Perfectly ok to use but indirectly makes you weaker.
---
Change your hard drive
---
Well considering its suppressed and she is completely intended for close range I believe it makes sense.
---
Shes still a crazy good op. It's aiming that's most people's problem.
---
If anything Lesion needs a nerf and should have his icons removed and have to rely on audio only.
---
Ok, true that.
---
You think the mag size is a bigger nerf that hipfire spread? I didn't think 3 rounds/mag was that big of a deal. 
---
I agree, I think she'll be much more viable at the mid range with the shotgun/pistol combo vs the SMG (which frankly I don't think is that great at mid range anyway)
---
Smoke as his gas mask going down the middle well thatcher has his off to the left

He is good, but Mira, Maestro, and Echo are easily the 3 strongest defenders in the game right now. There is a reason Lesion is practically never banned in Pro League.

Alright... I wont be able to play until Friday though, I have exams this week
---
Your teammates are a liability, kill them first
---
Yeah 100% sure. Couldn't printscreen the conversation wherein they said that they paid for the game and they can do whatever they want. We encountered them 3x and we couldn't even win a round vs them.
---
Attackers can't plant the defuser until they remove the gu mine, which is invisible. How did Ubisoft think he wouldn't be OP?
---
And the lack of communication or the delayed responses is hurting this relationship.

No, they don't.  We had a game chat bug for about a full year that was never really acknowledged by anyone from Ubisoft.

Exactly, as long as he's not risking his life and usefulness by flanking, he's a fantastic lockdown operator.

Yes

Showing k/d has always been a problem but on my old ps4 account I used r6tab to check my seasonal stat which was 1.2 but my seasonal was .7 from playing since I was horrible in my opinion it should just be removed.

Remember when Twitch was that close to Ash? And Twitch got nerfed for being too popular.

This is a siege sub reddit, siege does not natively support it, it‚Äôs not platform wide 
---
Thank you!
---
I fully disagree.
---
Lesion is a good operator and useful whatever maps you're on.
---
Kaid has weapons that are hard to master but if you do, they are very powerful. His gadget utility is more situational and depends of your team strategy (no it's not only to electrify hatches) 
---
If you actually are silver... I wouldn't even be able to queue with you because of Ranked Lock but I would add you if you could
---
Why are players still paying to be boosted.
---
Please explain how they would detect m+k in the first place? It's not like they're just plugging them in, they're using a piece of hardware to spoof a controller signal. 
---
It's not Ubisoft's problem, it's Microsoft's.
---
Basically your bullets come out of your sight not the gun barrel. What this means is that if you can see through it, you can shoot through it, no matter how small the gap.

Wow guys he put beaulo in his name, that means he's really good.

Id love to see same thing happening to TK fuckers

Haha nah it's cool. I get it. I'm like gold 3. I just usually cant battle well and float from high silver to gold. My best so far is gold 3 ever. So I'm already content. Could always be better though.

To be fair her shield is more intricate than the basic non skin‚Äôd shields, but yeah her model is boring as hell, I wish she had some tattoos or something 
---
Social acceptance and external validation 
---
The ear muffs dont have a hitbox
---
There was more... but I forgot to take pictures of all of them before I sent them off. And some of these are before I even went back over to tweak so üòÖ I wasnt sure what to do with the mute icon.. I sorta forgot his was all ya know, crazy and this was the best I decided on. Any future ideas? 
---
Thanks for looking. And thanks so much to all the support I got on my first post and the encouragement I got. And to the people who bought some. Y'all are awesome. Thanks for proving that this community isn't as toxic as it seems ;p
---
Rip in peace
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox as well and it seems like the later you play the more 5 stacks you run into especially after 7 so I would say any time before that is best just from my experience 
---
If epic cant do it with 2 billion dollars then nobody can. 
---
I was just informing people that it might be allowed in the future on siege on Xbox and I did say the publisher has to allow it
---
I agree. M&amp;K is highly annoying on console. And like you said, it‚Äôs cheating. Simple as that.
---
I killed the first 4 so hard that I killed the 5th on the inside so he rage quit
---
I an the same way, less experienced players are so sporadic and random it becomes quite the challange to go against them. 
---
I know, I need to get better at meta conditioning and reading the situations better. Realistically one of my worst mistakes is over peaking and rechallenging when I need to play more patiently and with more reserve. The people I play with have learned to call out not to over peak and it helps me not get so antsy. Doesn't help when I'm solo queuing though lol 
---
Hey that was a really good play! I feel you, less experianced players more often get tunnel vision and cant read the map as well and possible shooting angels. The more experianced player would know he can get flanked and has to rotate his attention to keep himself covered. 
---
How did you come about being a Zofia main?
---
After 50 hours I have only managed to ever get two of them (other than elephant) and they are the two different shades of yellow. So.... yeah
---
What buff? 
---
I can get behind this.
---
No, not at all
---
Running to the house to kill the boy ? 
---
Finally someone says it. 
---
Don't like m'n'k on Console but you can't Change it. 
---
If a Player is being toxic report them for toxic behavior and mute them. From the looks of it you asked nicely but regardless most players don't want help unless they ask for it. In future situations I would suggest saying "Hey, looks like your getting spawn peeked a lot may I suggest something?" If he says no leave it at that. 
---
Everyone enjoys the game differentially and telling him to stop playing the game was uncalled for. If he felt you guys were backseat gaming he could have muted you and not wanted to deal with that. I would suggest running the looking for group post on the Rainbow6 discord or your respecting consoles system if you don't want to deal with non communicative teammates. 
---
TL;DR Don't give advice to anyone who doesn't ask for it, don't be surprised if teammates don't communicate in a SoloQ.
---
Clearly some pests being exterminated
---
Mornings. People are in school or at work so the chances for you to play against teams are lower.
---
D pad right is a good shout actually, does pings and it does drone throwing so i could throw drones precisely without having to stop moving
---
mannnn i really want a castle buff since i start to play in 2016. 
---
Does anyone know if there  is u get the charms of the twitch drops 
---
No. Epic has 2 billion and couldn‚Äôt r6 with it‚Äôs measly 440 million cant. Come to pc. 
---
My thoughts exactly, it's so much better than it used to be. It's tempting... I love my reflex though.
---
Yes, it's *definitely* more likely that people don't understand what entertainment is rather than that they simply dont get enjoyment from watching someone rage, "overdone" or otherwise

I only play a couple games a day, but I had similar runins with Pok√©mon when I played competitively. I'm also Autistic and playing very tense or demanding competitive games can run my spoons pretty low which might also contribute.
---
Thank you so much for this though! It's really nice. 
---
Damn he WHIPPED that made
---
Everyone has their opinions friend. I can appreciate his TCSG12, but the Aug and pistol (post nerf) are weaker compared to other operator's guns. MP7, 416, MP5, T-5, Alda... I mean, maybe "trash" is going a bit too far, but I wouldn't consider them good. The TCSG12 is situational, like most DMR's honestly. 
---
Recruit and all the original ops

I did

NA. No special settings, all default. i might have bomb only enabled

I agree that they are the strongest, but I think you should include Lesion on that level. He is also way more versatile than any of those.

the community likes to play good operators. Did you see tatchanka pickrate?

Play fuse or anyone with an lmg and when you enter any room just hold down the trigger so you don‚Äôt need to worry about aim or reaction time if you‚Äôre spraying already
---
Crazy good job!
---
üòè
---
seemed kinda scummy to me
---
Well, if you play Rook, all you need to worry about is putting your armor down at the beginning of the round 
---
Possibly all time high for him and he's so toxic he demoted
---
I saw it too
---
Everything seems about right here
---
Lol
---
The trick is to aim the dot perfectly between the edges so that you only have to worry about the distance and height 
---
I actually honestly can't remember the last time I bought a seasonal skin, I'm never a fan, apart from Black ice, the effect ok black ice is really cool.
---
Otherwise I mainly just use the striped orange tiger, love that skin.
---
I got into Main (now called challenger). Its a great way to play with and against people who know what they are doing ( including streamers and pros). Unfortunately theres no one on anymore except for a few people at night.
---
Maverick is more fun to run
---
Take this question to r/R6ProLeague
---
Probably it refers that most of PL teams don't wanna use their "strat" before the Invitationals which is where they are holding these "strat" for, so they can use these strats as trump card and win because enemy didnt know about their strat. simple right?  
---
I personally like BB and Hibana. But that's probably because I'm not lurky enough for Mav.
---
1. Nomad was too strong with flashes
---
2. Spawnpeeking can easily be countered
---
3. Ash was too strong with smokes
---
4. Finka already has ok guns, frags, the ability to pick up downed enemies, deny interrogations etc 
---
I suggest Maverick or Hibana. Blackbeard is fun and all, but he's neefed to hell and virtually useless.
---
Nah he can burn
---
\[But we already have ***BOMBER\](***[***https://imgur.com/a/5xOADhU***](https://imgur.com/a/5xOADhU)***)***
---
Meh I‚Äôd argue there are plenty of ops just as strong or stronger. Smoke, Valk, and Pulse are 3 that immediately come to mind. 
---
I don't get why people want cross play with consoles. 1 you can't add friends or send messages to them since siege on consoles doesn't use a friend's list or message system from uplay. 2 The Microsoft OS on Xbox and the Sony OS on ps4 does not mix. The best you'd get is be able to play with them but what then? You can't join as a party, you can't send them a message, their voices wouldn't come in on your game because again, it's not a universal launcher. Cross play between Consoles would cost too much for ubi to do, for no profit gained. 
---
Yes I did
---
Okay but look at her win loss. It‚Äôs only .7. She isn‚Äôt that good. Plus tell me how you are going to nerf Ash? They already changed her recoil a bunch and if you need the R4-C, keep in mind they already have, than players are going to use the g36c. Reduce her speed? Why not just play Zofia who already has way more equipment. Remove breaching round? Zofia. Remove flash ants, than play Zofia. Remove breaching charge? Play Zofia. You literally can‚Äôt nerf Ash because then the community will simply just switch to Zofia. Who has also has been considerably needed these past few updates. You wanna fix her hitbox? It‚Äôs already been fixed, your aim may just be poor or go and get an Ethernet cable. There is no possible way to nerf Ash without completely removing her pickrate.
---
I always want to say it but fearing the potential hate and downvotes coming in my way.
---
The thing that you mentioned is "Peeker advantage", it is a term involving delay from ping/special relativity/server lag, R6 Siege does not have any movement mechanics to compensate this, since you are allowed to have pinpoint accuracy while moving scoped in, to me this is just pure COD'ish.
---
I always wish this game has some sort of scope in mobility, the mobility stat in game right now does not indicate anything, and I think it should be that. Pistols/Shotguns should have the highest, SMGs should be 2nd highest, Rifles/DMRs medium, LMGs/Shields lowest.
---
While this does not solve the peeker advantage completely, but this will certainly help a lot. Other FPS that I've played like CS:GO, A.V.A even have scope in instability and inaccuracy. And games like PUBG, has movement momentum, you aren't allowed to ADADAD easily. But in R6 Siege, you are freely to do anything while scoped in.
---
Mav or hibana
---
i guess the tech just isnt there yet and attachment color is hardcoded in the game. hopefully it will change at some point. alternatively, they could also make attachments take on the gun skin. that way, making a gun fully black also turns the holo into black
---
\[but we already have ***BOMBER***\]([https://imgur.com/a/5xOADhU](https://imgur.com/a/5xOADhU))
---
I never got the point of being boosted. Even if you don't get banned, when players fight you in your ELO range then they'll  shit on you because you don't have the abilities to match your rank, so people will just mock you for being a "shit diamond"  
---
Her pistol was garbage anyway. And now it‚Äôs getting worse
---
It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt care, but you guys seem to lack the most basic of knowledge. Campaign all you want, I‚Äôm all for that. I don‚Äôt want to see MnK either on console. 
---
But if you state that MnK is cheating, when, by all measurements in the code of conduct, it isn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre just being stupid. Until it‚Äôs regarded as cheating in the code of conduct, it isn‚Äôt cheating. 
---
Try using a shield op like montangue to learn the common spots people use on certain sites, and get used to aiming for headshots, rather than spraying randomly at the body
---
If every operator was able to pick there ideal situation based on there ability they would be fine. Say glaz would rather be a mile away. Echo would rather u be echoed. Use your strengths as Cav and attempt to avoid range not always possible but still that‚Äôs part of the game 
---
You obivously are newer to the game
---
1. Nomad was not to strong with flashes and if anything shes stronger with a claymore.
---
2. Spawnpeaking is not my main problem my main problem is the p90 is useless when compared to the mp5
---
3. This also goes to nomad I dont care what th ed y get so long as it's not breaches we dont need them with breaches
---
4. My point on finka has nothing to do with her gadget it's her usefulness to rush 
---
‚Äúhey look! there‚Äôs a guy wearing a similar hat! that MUST be Glaz‚Äôs twin!!!!!‚Äù 
---
What rank is this
---
Really starting to be incoherent.
---
No I'm not they are general suggestions as to what to do about this not actual answers
---
OI THATS RACIST YOU CAN'T SAY THE P WORD
---
I think that they should just not be allowed to rejoin. If you get disconnected from ping then maybe allow them to rejoin, but if you click quit or close your game then you shouldn't be allowed to join back
---
I will try it out! Love a sneaky Valk cam. Seen bad players (myself in the past too) waste a good 20-30 secs trying to find and destroy it 
---
I joined during Operation Chimera, and since then, only seasonal weapon skin I've gotten was Sovereign for my SAS ops. While I do like the look of Wind Bastion's skins, they're ultimately not what I'm looking to equip on many of my operators, Year 3 didn't do much to convince me I needed seasonal weapon skins. I do wish I had the chance to get older skins, a lot of them have great colors and details compared to the Year 3 stuff I've been around for, IMO.
---
It‚Äôs just a quick search for Cheat Engine lmao 
---
The third one was talent.
---
I don't think that's right, peakers advantage is when they see you before you see them, but in this case OP didn't see the enemy at all while the enemy saw OP 
---
in the mind of a copper 
---
that was harsh, I remember that I got 1 star.
---
I am aware. I was a royal marine for many years. Thanks for letting me know. 
---
Just a tip, screensavers do what they say. They save your screen from burning images by having something animated so that the screen doesn't have the same color everywhere for long periods of time. If you use an image you have higher chances of getting a screen with an image burnt in.
---
It looks like they all have the mumps
---
I already have a favorite tab  
---
^(It‚Äôs the Thatcher button)
---
IQ?
---
1. Yes she was, she could flash out a room &amp; throw an airjab down without you even seeing.
---
2. You don‚Äôt nerf other guns to make their counterpart more viable.
---
3. Probably should‚Äôve said something like ‚Äúgive Castle a deployable Shield‚Äù then
---
4. Finka is fine as she is. She‚Äôs a global, but she isn‚Äôt the priority right now.
---
I hate that your a lion main but press the 3 dots at the top right of the sub reddit then press flair

Ive had the same problem also. I have to change back to eus after every t-hunt to even find a match.

AHH THATS HOT

Favela and Yacht were originally removed from matchmaking because they were very unoptimized after Operation Health. Once they improved the performance on the maps, they were returned to casual without consideration of their balance state.
---
  
---
Bartlett is just bad to play on, although, personally, I dislike Favela just as much.
---
Need more white haired ops!
---
*when a touch of color is out of place*

I can barely understand half of the things he says ‚Äúthese hunters think they‚Äôre training will keep them alive.  They break down doors and come threw windows, weapons drawn. They check the corners, watch each other‚Äôs backs, and give the all clear. But it‚Äôs too late... BFJJDHIUSDLPHDVKYRGHDETJHFFOJU...‚Äù

This is not r/Complain About Every Thing in Rainbow. Ppl are dumb just don‚Äôt engage

---
top ten reasons to not play hostage
---
1: teammates üëèüëè
---
Even if it‚Äôs pernounced differently, it still works as a joke
---
I zoomed all the way in and I still cant see who you shot lmao 
---
Question: does my iPhone‚Äôs refresh rate make all these clips look super smooth? 
---
I don't need one for him, but for the 4v5 we had to play :&lt;
---
Uh oh guys we have a gold 4 telling us what should happen to the game...
---
Prolly stupid question, but i haven‚Äôt been on the sub in a little while. How do you get the magma skin, alpha packs?
---
you must be a low rank to believe Ash needs smokes and the MP5 needs the acog taken away. what‚Äôs the point of that. 
---
And a missing eye
---
Okay the point is not for these to be priorities just generally brought up for the community because it all effects the game.
---
Also yes you can flash a room and plant the charges its no different then planting in smoke. Ultimately though I think smokes may be better for nomad as she can still plant her things but unless its directly in the smoke you'll still see it as a defender
---
And castle with a shield would be a little meh and I'm  not completely suggesting nerfing the mp5 because I dont want it to receive any kind of damage or recoil nerf but I'd rather see the p90 actually be viable in some way over the mp5
---
Dokkaebi shot you in the back
---
I dont see any dates? When are the stream times?
---
Maybe a life long goal or something, who knows 
---
Because the rules don‚Äôt specifically spell out it‚Äôs cheating doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not cheating. Fine way it‚Äôs not cheating. It‚Äôs like crouch spamming. Not cheating but ‚Äústill in the game‚Äù it‚Äôs just a piece of shit exploit that *should not* be in the game. 
---
what‚Äôs the point of this. complaining about it won‚Äôt fix anything. try reading the sub rules before posting. 
---
It means that since invitational is soon teams are saving they‚Äôre best strats because if they use them then teams can figure out how to counter them. That‚Äôs what G2 is doing right now so they are losing a lot.

Thatcher : what‚Äôs in my brother‚Äôs canisters ? 
---
Recruit : drugs ?
---
Again general things and suggestions. The point of taking away the mp5 acog is to make the p90 actually a viable Choice on rook and dock or to just remove it off them to give to another op. And ash may not need smokes but in general she doesn't need breach charges 
---
Wish they would bring this UI back to the game 
---
"timeline" is a alpha feature and got removed in beta
---
Currently not necessary to have it as a separate list, but it'd be a good idea to have them highlighted or give the icon an extreme bevel so that you have an easy visual cue of where to slam your mouse. It'd just be a QOL thing for now, and it's not to difficult to just add an extra flag to the "base" operator so they all have this "favorited" thing to use later on when there's too many ops for 1 screen.
---
Spot on lmao
---
I agree with some of these points, the P90 is obsolete yes, but I disagree on the Nomad part. She can be self-sustaining, but we don‚Äôt want her to be a 1 woman army like Ash already is.
---
Cant even do this even if i want to.
---
Seige take ages to load menus and games
---
Why did you close your xp and kill confirm thingy?
---
How do you know when you injure someone
---
No it's called the ***Holy ban wave***
---
There are 44 of them? I guess it‚Äôs hard to believe when I only use 5 of them. 
---
The reason lesion has an indicator is because the gu mines are invisible so once you throw them you have a hard time finding and picking them back up 
---
yeah this has been becoming a huge issue on PS4. xbox not so much as it doesn't allow easy MnK support, but i've heard stories. honestly, this is more of an issue on playstation's part, not Ubi's. 
---
*Holy Moly*
---
Who cares if you're being tracked if you're already in the obj? As someone else said, sprint out and work your way back setting up.
---
High gold/Low Plat, 5 Stack on Xbox.
---
Just because you dont like the idea of removing acog off the mp5 doesn't mean it wont lead to the p90 actually being a viable choice for rook and doc. Me personally I'd rather it just removed off them and placed on a new op but I didn't make the suggestion for the community I made it for ubisoft to consider and do testing with
---
*suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure*
---
it looks like you just coped the ela icon faggot
---
Was there any reasoning for the removal of such a feature?
---
Except it's on the second floor so he has to time his nades perfectly or they just fall to the ground
---
Jw because those kids were not good 
---
The screen recording of a screen recording ‚Äì that's funny!
---
Cavi Main Checks out xD
---
just guessing, i'd imagine this is due to the significantly different formatting associated with Arabic compared to, say, english or chinese. just a thought. 
---
How‚Äôs about console uplay friends ? 
---
It‚Äôs the same for PS4 and Xbox 
---
It did look easier to understand at the first glance, but Its not to bad of a trade off for a overall better looking UI
---
Shit they making him do all the intern jobs
---
Ikr
---
both of those suggestions are dumb. why would you nerf one gun into the ground so the other gun becomes more viable. people i know use the P90 over the MP5 for certain situations. and saying ‚Äúyeah ash doesn‚Äôt NEED breach charges so let‚Äôs make her more powerful by giving her the second best secondary gadget‚Äù is dumb. seriously. the suggestions you gave have no positive effect on the game. only negative 
---
You‚Äôre clearly hacking. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre admitting it here instead of waiting for BattleEye to ban you 
---
It‚Äôs the fact that the J√§ger left not the blowtorch 
---
Well ash is because she has no hitbox and decided weapons on top of being able to secure hostage 3.5 seconds into the round.
---
Nomad at most with smokes may be able to sorta hide were her charges go. Maybe frags may work better over all though as it may combo a better way then the claymore but I dont see it being as broken as the flashes
---
I'm somewhat new and I'm still trying to learn the maps lol. What role would be good to play togain map knowledge?
---
I love the muscle memory rage quit. How many times do you have to be a little bitch and quit to be that fast? 
---
really? i've been playing on xbox, both ranked and casual, since blood orchid and i've only ever seen one remotely suspicious player, and even then i'm not sure. i'd say i was lucky except i'm not lmao, and my buddies don't experience much of a problem with this either. granted, it's a small subject group, but still. i'd expect at least one of us to have seen anything. 
---
5 minutes? Exaggeration over, casual is 4 min timers so if this is happening youre dying the second the drone phase is over. Ranked is 3.
---
If 4 out of 5 have died in less than a minute, you are not droning enough and are not using your utility enough. If you died in less than a minute, you deserve to watch a long 1v1.
---
In all seriousness though. In a 1v1 situation, you should be going slowly. There can be any number of things you have to deal with, like kapkan or lesion traps, rotation holes, cameras etc. In a 1v1 you should be using your drone to find the defender and figuring out different approaches to kill them or lure them out. If you are dead in this situation, it's your job to give as much info as possible.
---
Not to shit on your or anything, but 1v1s are Def not 5 minutes and I just wanted to cut off any responses that mirror your first sentence. 
---
The main point I had was that It would create an influx in player base, allowing match making to become faster. Though what you are saying is correct I would take new players that I cant message over no players at all
---
Fair enough 
---
Actually now when you leave as long as cavi as started the animation, it makes the interrogation finish instantly, so it helps cavi out immensely in my opinion 
---
What ahaha?
---
It doesn't work. Ubisoft would need to create it's own unique launcher similar to how mmos do on consoles, but that's time and money they would need to invest, and they wouldn't get anything out of it.

They should at least have one day in the year when all of the past seasonal skins become available for purchase.

well, i'd say it was the season ending, but i'm pretty sure wind bastion is still going strong. sorry about that though.

I was going to suggest a shield op also. You don‚Äôt have to be good at aiming if you just run up and shield bash people. 
---
Lmao my team has scrimmed against their .YET clan gonna hop into their discord today and see how they reacted 
---
Oh F

Morning for sure. But early afternoon can be tricky as you advance in rank. I'm seeing a lot more stream sniping as east coast starts getting off work/school and fires up the ol twitchy-roo and you get popped because your teammate didn't set a delay.
---
Get an SSD
---
oh god oh fuck oh no please no ban no no no
---
So what you're saying Is because I suggest removing the acog from the mp5 it kills the gun? That says how you use it. I'm not saying that losing it wont hurt the mp5 but it will atleast lower the power of the arguably best spawnpeaking SMG in the game. Its basically gonna be like removing it off jager and bandit. It wont kill how strong the weapon is but you cant look out any window or run outside and get 2 headshots and a down 
---
Now this... this is art

Alright, thanks. I guess this confirms it. It's just that I have a CPU load of 85% most of time weirdly.

i think it would make for a great buff if frost, kapkan, smoke, ela, (alibi) had icons, and/or for j√§ger a temporary icon when his gadget gets triggered, i think it would be somewhat justfied because of the bigmap trend.

It‚Äôs like the only legendary I have and it‚Äôs from the packs I got from getting golden edition 
---
We'll just disagree then.
---
Not necessarily an influx of players (although there may be more variety at times yes) even games with cross platform options, ps4 players are more likely going to be paired up with other ps4 players than with Xbox players just due to the infrastructure of the programs.
---
By this I mean if you are a 5 stack of ps4 players, the opposite team may have 1 or 2 Xbox players but the more likely scenario is another 5 stack of ps4 players
---
The real issue comes with the actual voice chat. Since ps4 and Xbox 1 chat functions wouldn't work properly together, you wouldn't hear someone on another platform unless ubisoft created their own launcher that uses its own coding for stuff like that. As interesting as it would be, ubisoft wouldn't invest the time and money doing that because they'd not see any profit from it.
---
It is nice to imagine though. 
---
I do it when i get nervous tbh and ots only really spammy for the first kill
---
What would here abilities be?

Can‚Äôt argue with that logic, go fuck yourself, and have a nice day

i think the germans made something like this back in world war two. it was like a really bendy barrel that they'd screw onto the end of their rifles
---
Righto understood
---
Nice I just got it and a buck,glaz and a few weapons skins when operation chimera came out, they are some of my favorite skins in the game very unique.
---
i didnt play alpha or beta, but i think it's useless
---
I mean look at nibbanite , they got a system ingame called epic friends . So why not ‚ÄúUbisoft friends‚Äù ingame in siege ?
---
Maybe i wanted to roam? Maybe they track me and someone happens to be by a window or wall and can now wall bang me? Its a good counter i just hate it. Not op though. Jackal isnt i mean.

Wait no pls dont do it.... no no no nooooo

Dude do you think think this is a balanced game??

We don't do that here

Nice. I got some other contamination stuff as well but it‚Äôs mostly for ops I don‚Äôt play RIP

Yeah, I dont think anything can transfer over since it would potentially undercut sony or microsoft's cut from the microtransactions.

Her pistol is crazy tf u talking about? You can down people with 3 shots.

So are clash mains

Damn almost nutted
---
maybe j√§ger and smoke, with j√§ger some kind of louder noise or smth.
---
Looks amazing, Great job!
---
It won't work tho since you can't realiably identify the emulated mkb adapters which is why we have the whole problem anyway.
---
Fair point didn't really consider that
---
That's because it was designed from the ground up as it's own launcher, siege was not. Fortnite works like that because it was specifically designed that way, whereas seige is not. The money was spent on fortnite to create a launcher before the game was released. Siege would have to rework everything (as well as make a way of transferring save data from your console to your ubisoft account) just to make it work. Like I said, too much money for 0 profit, so it won't happen. 
---

Nah, I play Mute on defense more than anyone else. 
---
Yeah I feel you all the ops I ‚Äúmain‚Äù I have the elite skins for like mute,twitch,doc.kapkan,and thatcher. So it kinda like meh when I get anything now a days lol.
---
mutes should be reworked to see the exact range
---
This is pretty cool 
---
Not at all, you still hear the gu mines and they are damn loud. It's just that you can't pinpoint it 100% and have to remember where you put them/which one was activated.

But I‚Äôm replying to the person with a Caviera Main flair and not you?

I remember Ubi saying they wanted to buff Kap and Frost at some point cause they're underpicked right now. I think that might've been a couple seasons ago, but they haven't received any buffs since that I know of.

Eh it‚Äôs side money I have like a full time job and since I play siege a lot a little bit of money to support the game I like isn‚Äôt that bad for me at least it‚Äôs one of my most played games right now played since launch lol.

Console?

exactly, he was even an after thought because of his counter to lion, so technically Nomad is a counter for Cav (*insert roamer here*) right? and Mute is a counter for Lion sooooo shouldnt he get an indicator so he can see, just like Nomad can, the range at which the gadget is performing? 
---
makes no sense
---
It‚Äôs 10k jeez, yeah I‚Äôm gonna stick with the ops.
---
Yea
---
Both are very fun so you cant go wrong either way ;D
---
There isn't an explosion if they shoot the trap tho. Maybe the buff could be that it makes a loud noise when destroyed.
---
I see how it would be useful on Console but on pc not really needed
---
Fucking beautiful, though it kinda remind s me off mydog somehow. Anyway blood first try man hope to see more on the future.
---
Well said , And this is Ubisoft who never listen to any feedback 
---
I'm not sure what to say about that 
---
Not sure what that has to do with my post. Both Xbox and PS4 natively support mnk. If console user wants to use one then you can throw them in their own queue together. Of course you‚Äôll still have issues with emulators, but it suddenly becomes a nonissue for a bunch of people willing to switch.

Yea. What's your psn

Ella cuz booty fine af and its fun to roam with her

My best advice is to take your time. Learn the maps as best as you can. Whether you're good or not callouts are everyone's best friend. Hell man I'd play with ya. Always looking for people to join in on the meme days and serious days. Find the ops your best with and most comfortable with. I get made fun of because of who I play on a regular basis but when you get good, doesn't matter who you play (minus the lord because he's just hard to use properly). Watch out for the plats in casual because they will tk and whine when you try to take your time. Use your voice, communicate with your team even if they say nothing. You can at least say you tried. So on so fourth. Only so much I can say over a simple post. Most of everything you learn will be playing. My first like 100 or so hours I was awful. Now over 1050 hours I feel like I'm at a decent spot myself. You probably won't take as long but I learned every map new or not. I play every op and can play efficiently, and finally I was friendly and made friends with people who were better than me and I learned from them and my own mistakes. You'll do the same and you'll be awesome too :)
---
Sorry for the late reply, didn't see I had a comment.
---
I've heard that both are fun but I'm looking for someone that will be good for winning defense rounds, thanks for your input though
---
I sometimes think about siege when I see security cams... It happens lol
---
Maybe give reward as suggested in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/ainfis/if\_ubisoft\_rewarded\_players\_that\_play\_on\_tts\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/ainfis/if_ubisoft_rewarded_players_that_play_on_tts_the/)
---
Mira is good but isn‚Äôt very useful on every defense room , so you kind of have to plan out choosing her for the right defense rooms to get maximum effectiveness . Ela is a decent roamed but her gun has a lot of recoil 
---
Darth__waderr 
---
That bronze 4 tho
---
Perfect. Then you can use the bi/tripod off of placed shields and raised surfaces so you can shoot while standing. Suggestion: we can have four available bipods hanging off of Tachanka's original turret so that Tachanka can still be the same as before but now provides buffs to the other players.
---
I sent a party invite

Your outrage says otherwise. What a bitch boy.

Mira is harder to learn but she can be perfect

Frost is probably cumming in her grave

I feel your pain, I once got 4 of the same exact legendary skin back to back, it is indeed extremely painful.
---
Shitty teamates shitty rank, I lost like 6 games in a row because I met some fucks in casual and brought me down... I'm not happy
---
I suggest Mira, in ranked she is useful in almost every site
---
I'd still want something a biiiiit more concrete (like another PvE event where it's stated that operators should put their VR training to use) The only thing I found that was remotely VR related for fortress was the "written agreement" to train in the fortress, where it refers to "you" then player, nothing really VR related. If there's something I missed feel free to link it, but until then I'm going to stay skeptical.
---
Plat 3 at the moment plat 2 last season. I play support and when I don't I usually top frag. My k/d is stuck at 0.9 from being copper in Blood Orchid. Just stop displaying the stat it doesn't mean anything in Siege. Today I played Monty and planted 3 rounds and ended with 3 kills. I was top of the team but I ended with more deaths than kills because my goal was to plant. It's such a shit stat in a team game like this. 
---
WE SHOULD NOT GET DUPLICATES
---
Both are very useful! Maybe mira makes thr biggest impact tho
---
I saw a clip earlier and a J√§ger left so he wouldn‚Äôt get burnt by Mav‚Äôs torch.
---
Good idea. At first I thought this would have been kinda useless since how often do you change stuff in the loadouts anyways. But with that it would be extra fucking nice.
---
It's two under scores if u didn't catch that
---
Oh my god I feel like i wouldn‚Äôt be able to touch the game if that happened to me
---
I did. I sent a party invite 
---
It already does make a unique noise. You just have to be close enough to hear it being shot anyway
---
Mira is situational but has some really nice utility when needed. She's more of a team player. Ela is decent but she's better on het own.

---
Yep he was, I used to main kapkan when he first came out.
---
He immediately punished rushers such as Ash or Blitz.  On the proper doorway you could get 1 to 2 kills.
---
With the new change you‚Äôre lucky to even get one, since every operator can just walk through one, then just check ever other doorway.

where's "quadrocopter man main" flair?

yeah that was on here recently
---
Well I mostly just want them to take the breach charges off a few ops. I mean I counted and including recruits and the breachers like sledge thermite hibana maverick and buck we have over 15 people with some way of quickly breaching into rooms
---
Now I see how its useful for attackers to have but I dont think over half the attackers need some way to breach. And looking at the dlc ops theres only 1 each yeah that doesn't do some sort of breaching.
---
So personally I dont think we need to many more ops with breach charges so ether thet need to remove it off a few people and only add in 2 new breach charge using ops a year itd improve things.
---
The ops I think dont need breach charges are 
---
1. Iq (she needs her frags back)
---
2. Blackbeard (may just be the fact I am a blackbeard but I personally would like to see if he can combo better with ether a claymore or frag grenades
---
3. Nomad
---
4. Ash and zofia (they can soft breach without it they dont have it on buck and sledge)
---
5. Finka (she probably doesn't need to be able to rush in quickly on her own considering her gadget and primary weapons)
---
Lastly I think if they can at least remove it off of one op and give it to thermite instead thatd be great
---
Party inv sent

Im not on right now which servers?

You mean an "insta-lock" tab?

macros in general are illegal in r6s, the thing is, they are harder to detect than normal aimbot and shit, also depends for what you use them for.
---
Na
---
They need to pickup with these solutions that a will make things better this game is tactical and by the second it's becoming more "arcadey" , they need to do something or they'll lose some part of the player base 
---
Aside from the color and teeth don't think It looks anything like Ela's Icon

It‚Äôs a roll on all items and it‚Äôs a free reward so I think it‚Äôs fine.

Yes I bought blackbeard for my first OP and regretted it I think you should get hibbana and frost

Proud of it. Enjoy being ruled by England ya daft cunt, bloody bastard child

I‚Äôm not sure how this would work on PC with alt+F4 but if you click ‚Äúleave match‚Äù to deny anything or click leave match for any reason, in ranked, you should get a 5-10 minute lock on the main screen. No casual, no reentering your ranked match. I feel terrible for Cavi mains who have people leave. This nerd is just going to make it worse. Something needs to be done with those who purposefully ‚Äúleave match‚Äù. 5 minutes would at least give the other team an advantage for one if not two rounds. 
---
Someone get this as the r/siegeacademy banner
---
You missed my point of I could never stop playing on Xbox and transfer to PC because I would miss my cosmetics too much.
---
i thaught macros in general were illegal ? bcz i have seen way to many people with recoil macros. and i have tested them in Terror-Hunt with my own logitech and they are scary af.
---
spawn peeks are so easy to counter. it‚Äôs not the games fault you can‚Äôt. it makes the gun much less useful but it also makes Rook and Doc much less useful. it‚Äôs already getting nerfed so why nerf it even more. you‚Äôre comparing this to J√§ger and Bandit but don‚Äôt see how different those two scenarios are. 
---
I start far out and work my way back and than reinforce what's left to be done.  It works for the most part.  I don't do much serious roaming though.
---
Yeah I only do this shit in casual 
---
I like that buck one but my favorite is the blood orchid for bandit. So basic yet so clean
---
I had a buddy with a similar issue. Ended up being a graphics card issue. Don't know any more than that but maybe it'll help. That sucks though! 
---
It‚Äôs just another reminder that casual is almost as sweaty as ranked.

Hello IzPCRM, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aj45qj/error_404_flair_not_found/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I know it's casual and everyone likes to say "rank doesn't matter in casual, casual has a hidden elo system, bla bla bla".... Yeah I call bullshit. The idea that diamonds and high plats magically lose their high skill level just because it's casual and should be put against bronze is absurd. Plats/Diamonds should never be in the same game as Bronzes under any circumstance. 
---
Also, we only won 2 rounds because they were TK'ing early in the game.
---
Nr, I get really good grades. I just came back from breezing through my first exam 
---
Seems pretty unnecessary. With only 3 traps its not really all that hard to keep track of where they are and figure out which trap they stepped in based on sound and basic situational awareness.
---
As someone with around 80 hours as Frost I cant say I have ever really struggled with this particular problem.
---
Glad I could help! 
---
Well that actually helps, I keep getting messages saying that I need to update the gpu but I already have the latest drivers.

Of the acog was taken away then no one would use gign
---
The operator could have a grenade launcher than fires incendiary grenades that light a small fire and frag grenades, kinda like Zofia.
---
Not really, even in full rounds u get the time to pick ops, load in, prep phase, in between matches 
---
Well Smoke, Castle, Tachanka, Montagne, Bandit are the only five vanilla OPs don‚Äôt have Elites yet. And since SEALs and Frost got their Elite, I‚Äôll add Buck as well, so six of them should be the priority atm, and I personally hope Smoke finally gets his sick ass Elite and let the good‚Äôol SAS be the first vanilla CTU to have a full Elite squad at my disposal. Then we should have Lord‚Äôs Elite with his rework come out together, to give him the redemption and rebirth we‚Äôve being longing for so long. The rest can be released with any order they like, and then after DLC1,2 and vanilla CTUs are all in the Elite roaster, they can start work on new OPs, should start with Cav.

My dude I'm suggesting it as another way around the nerf they are already doing. Plus I can counter spawn peaks just fine I'm a blackbeard main with glaz as one of my secondary picks I have no trouble.
---
 When suggesting these though I wanted to think of this as everyone in the community and I also left everything open to how it can be done hence why I gave just a reasonable replacement to ash and zofias breaches. It was more of a suggestion for zofia but I wanted to in general hear what the community has to say about everything hearing what everyone from copper 4 to diamond has to say on everything

How about an operator who IS a dog. It would be an information gatherer that needs team support to be effective. It can move quietly and Sprint through holes other ops would have to crouch walk through. It can also prone, getting it's head low enough to look through drone holes or under barricades. Has a camera mounted to it's back that the team can access on their phones, making him a highly mobile drone. You could probably have some kind of tracking abilities with sense of smell. I think 2 melee hits to down an opponent and a third to kill. He would be High utility, low lethality.
---
lol you're a bad player get over it.
---
As me having 200 hours with frost it‚Äôs become very time consuming to me when I play timing is very important to me and having the trap mark turn red or something when someone is in a trap helps me know where they are stuck at, also it would allow you to see if they get picked up so you know they are up and with one of their teammates you can get an easy 2 kills, I don‚Äôt think this would cause problems for the other team either they just gotta be more careful when they know frost is around or they could just use their teammate as bait :)
---
&gt; Essentially they said that Ash is just a staple of the game and provides a comfortable play style for generally newer players. This tends to also mean players that don't fully learn the mechanics of the game, ie leaning, Intel, teamwork, or possibly lack a solid team to help them or communicate with, gravitate towards her straightforward gameplay. They acknowledged that in higher ranks she tends to get picked for her load out and speed (tied into the mechanics of the game and general computer issues) leads towards a community feeling she is broken. However, contrary to sometimes popular belief, many balancing changes done by Ubi is geared towards the average player, not saying all but I do believe most. Nerfing ash too much many discourage new players, and if her high pick rate is anything close to lower ranks, it means that like her or not, there are lots of people playing her regularly. This means a lot of complaining of they change her too much, so they are forced to keep that in mind when making changes. 
---
Thank you sir you're a gentleman and a true scholar. They pretty much said she's a flagship operator for Ubisoft. 
---
Pretty good song üòÇ
---
Doesnt matter if its casual or not. Balance should be present on whatever mode you choose
---
Theyd still have the acog just not on the mp5. Plus it was more of a suggestion to both allow for the p90 to a state of usefulness and to suggest something other then the current nerf it has coming to it
---
Make it thiccer

this is how ubisoft works

Put a mark on them that says something like "throwback." This way people know which ones are original and which ones were purchased at a later date. 
---
IQ was too strong with frags, BB should not be buffed in any way shape or form, Nomads fine, giving ash or zofia any other type of secondary gadget would most likely either change nothing because people always use the other gadget or they will only use the new one. Finka is good with breaches not just for actual breaching but for distractions, too &amp; noise cover.
---
A lot of ops have breaches because it‚Äôs either an ok secondary gadget for them or it‚Äôs a no-go. There aren‚Äôt many Attacker secondary gadgets so when giving ops the choice they don‚Äôt want to give them 2 strong choices, like monty has, flashes or smokes.

It's still better than just allowing them to rejoin instantly. It takes longer to re connect if you unplug, they may not get back in time for the next round hindering your team. I do think that the bodies staying after disconnect is a better option, but I don't know if the game engine or code would allow that to work. All I know for sure is something needs to be done about the disconnecting and rejoining 
---
Who's in the bottom right with the shit eating grin lmao

Mira is strong ashell if played correctly but ella is thicc AF. Dificult choice
---
I love my Leon Furioso skin so much, it's easily my second favorite behind black ice.
---
Thanks for the clarification. I was about to say there's little chance this is 2-2 if your opponent was trying lol. Agreed casual could be better but consider this: maybe you'll pick up on some strats and such playing vs them. Be sure to watch kill cams. If you always played with your own ranks you wouldn't have much opportunity to learn from those who are better.

---
Ela- Roamer with a High recoil gun with low damage arguably decent, 3 proximity mines that stick anywhere and concuss enemies. Barbed Wire is a great utility.
---
Mira- Anchor with a great close range SMG good for about 1 kill before you need to reload. Great at holding down objectives especially bomb. Takes time to get better with but between a shotgun secondary and a nitro cell she overall has fantastic utility. Watch out for twitch or your giving the enemy an advantage, don't pop the Mirror no matter what!
---
TL;DR Ela is easier to use and a great info/roaming operator. Mira is extremely good but takes skill and teamwork, and if played wrong will screw over your team.
---
Ela has better gadget.
---
Mira has better weapons.
---
2 shots, yep, but lets not forget of leg shots, gonna need 3 of those.

Makes sense

Is it the white and green one? 
---
Are there any circumstances where you can be shot as you spawn though? All of the peeks I can think of are only dangerous if you run without looking anywhere. 
---
not well, if i remember correctly 
---
A lot of people think I have tachanka main for memes but I actually play him a lot
---
yeah the scoring, i shut it off to be more aware of my surroundings. if they die the body ragdolls and slowly falls over and whatnot but if it‚Äôs an injure they drop straight down immediately plus the character model themselves scream a little bit 
---
Nah, do it to iq
---
I would use him but I prefer kapkan, the traps and the sausage is a deadly combo
---
the community also asked for the maps to be added back to casual
---
Well yes I can agree with they dont need to be something strong but those are just my opinions. And iq was "to strong" with her frags because she could take out huge numbers of gadgets in one go. It's no different then pulse and his nitro aside from the fact that pulse kills the entire enemy team not just their gadgets.
---
You have to remember aside from seeing an ops phone is on her gadget doesn't detect people. The frags just made her job easier and ubisoft doesn't believe an ops job should be easy. Hence why blackbeard continues to be nerfed even though 50 damage destroyed his shield in 2 hits from almost every gun cav is getting a nerf and frost lost both a nitro cell and her shield. They basically dont want good ops to be able to do a good job

Can‚Äôt lie, maverick looks pretty stoned

This is a technique used by people that memorize entire decks too.

I remember reading about it, it's quite fascinating. Memory with association.

This functions because you create connections in your memories. I.e creating a bigger net to catch new knowledge. It's actually really cool.
---
Discord servers can make money off of users through ads and bots.
---
If they just cut out the half with the picture/op photos it would all fit very nicely for a long time, even with a favourites bar
---
People say tachanka is terrible, in my opinion they need to get gud. I have two ways of tachanka play
---
1: hard anchor with sausage
---
2: semi Roma with 9x19vsn
---
Also kapkan is great
---
Mira is my personal favorite on defense when not roaming.

Did they TK you in that game? I wouldn‚Äôt consider such messages toxic but rather unsportsmanlike venting of frustrations. Also, why should we specify if a TK was malicious or not? If it‚Äôs not malicious, why would you even report it?
---
I could use chanky but I like to play with all of my hud off, the cross hairs throw me off lol
---
Try with rook or doc on defense at the start, mp5 is a perfect weapon. On attack perhaps try fuze
---
Cull the herd! 
---
You have gotten serious
---
Another idea would be all defenders can see the red laser, but attackers don't. Same concept as artificial 'intel' with icons floating on your screen, but more based in the physical game space, limited to line of vision, and realistic to the gadget's properties. 
---
Sounds good, I have a friend that makes about $25 a month off of his Discord Server, thanks for the clarification.
---
I don't agree.
---
This is an issue that's demonstrative of Ubisofts flaws in game design philosophy.  Competitive video games, more than other types of video games, need to be intuitive.  Making the marker exist for Lesion but not for Kapkan, Ela and Frost is confusing to anyone that is not familiar with the game.  This marker should not be used for balancing, it should be a flat rule across all trap operators.  
---
If you want to streamline the process of new players learning a video game, you need to be consistent with your rules.  To the layman, its completely arbitrary whether Lesion's traps have the indicator vs every other operator.  When I introduce this game to new players, explaining that Lesion can see his traps but other operators cant makes literally no sense to them and it adds another barrier, of which there are already many in this game, to them learning what the "rules" of the game are.
---
I will say, I think the way forward is actually to remove the indicator from Lesion in Ranked and I think they need to make the rules more flat across Ranked and Pro League so players can more easily learn and understand the rules.  There's way too big of a gulf between the rules in Ranked and Pro League and its an unreasonable ask for players to have to get 10 players together and join a custom game or use a third-party application like FaceIt just to play the settings that the game seems to have been intended to be played.  Spectators and players should be able to learn and understand the rules of pro league without having literally read a rulebook because they don't have easy access to playing the game in that fashion.  I know there are a lot of people that feel like the settings in pro league are too brutal but they really aren't.  They are just different.  The reason you would think they are brutal is because you're used to the rules in Ranked but had you started playing the game with nothing but the Pro League settings, you would recognize them as the way the game was intended to be played.
---
This is how CS:GO works and its great.  Valve, for the most part, keeps the rules between match making and what the pro's play synonymous.  There are *some* changes, mostly to avoid trolls from harassing players(no knife round and no overtime because trolls can use these to make a game go indefinitely and Valve would be punishing the victims if they were forced to leave the game and get banned for it) but besides that, the rules are the same.  They even imposed round time and bomb timer changes to match-making and the pro settings to make them consistent between each other.
---
**tl;dr:** You should be able to see the traps for Lesion, Kapkan, Ela, Frost and any other trap operators but either make this the case in Pro League settings as well, to be consistent, or remove it from Ranked.  The settings are too varied between all these modes, especially because Ranked *should* ideally be used for players that want to play more seriously and as a stepping stone towards Pro League.  The UI element should not be so inconsistent or used for balancing and it should be seen as a "rule" that's flat across all operators.

&gt; you‚Äôre bringing up ancient classic 1 liners , fortnite has mnk lobbies on xbox
---
I don‚Äôt know about Xbox, I don‚Äôt play Fortnite.  My roomate has a PS4 with Fortnite and that was ps4‚Äôs situation.  I should‚Äôve clarified that better, but it‚Äôs still not Ubisoft‚Äôs (or Epi‚Äôs) fault if Xbox and PS4 natively support M&amp;K.  That point doesn‚Äôt help your already poorly founded argument that‚Äôs it‚Äôs Ubisoft‚Äôs fault.
---

---
no thanks, this isnt COD
---
Lol,
---
I wasn‚Äôt tk‚Äô but after I asked one to go away and asked one why are they being mean, they continued to message me.
---
I‚Äôm saying, after the tk, you are taken directly to a report screen, and you are given two options, malicious team-kill or non malicious. If you pick non malicious, you return to your game instantly, if you pick malicious you are taken to a menu to talk more in detail about the tk

Why don't you people use screen shots? I don't get it. It's so easy on all 3 platforms.

Hell yeah
---
I just noticed that last night in a clip I saved, it threw me off.
---
I also play Lord a lot,he's very good especially when enemy is rushing.
---
Okay 
---
My only problem with this is that people who buy undetectable-adapters to use M&amp;K on console aren‚Äôt (for the most part) going to chose to play with people that use M&amp;K natively because then they no longer have the advantage they paid for.  I still think your suggestion should be implemented.  I *personally* think M&amp;k on console should be standardized and sold by Sony and Microsoft so that they can build and sell detectable units, so companies can chose to lobby those players differently.  That‚Äôs the only constructive solution I‚Äôve heard presented.
---
Now organize them by height, name, or organization.
---
i give it a bronze medal out of diamond
---
So the Lord should be standing above or in front of all of them. But otherwise it looks awesome
---
Lord is seriously underrated, I used to think he was bad, the began to play him a lot, now with him I average 5-6 kills defense. People often think I am throwing, but then they see I am good they back off.

Also don‚Äôt judge me but I play on Xbox

Hello teddytr876, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aj4ggp/litrally_unplayable_favela/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I do understand the reasoning for not wanting to nerf Ash, but ever since that statement came out, there was no attenpt to improve the "comfort" of any of the lesser picked Operators compared to her, and as it stands, the best players in this game preffer Ash over everyone else by a large marging, there is no reason at such high level the most basic character is the most played, it makes sense for gold and below, but diamond?
---
Hello Lemon_donkey! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

You have a pic? You could just PM it to me. 
---
The reason for Lesion to have indicators for the gu mines is because they are invisible. How many times did you close a barricade to destroy a gu mine of your lesion friend? It is frustrating. Even more frustrated for Lesion would be to lose tracks of where he deployed the traps. Something that doesn't happen with Kapkan because:
---
1- Traps are not invisible
---
2- Traps are set in doorways, therefore the position is fixed and you know where to expect it
---
3- They fucking explode.
---
Not on me no, I don't usually play doc and buck is probably literally the only op I have a pic of, he's one of my favorites lol
---
Happy Cake day!
---
Looking almost like mine, exept the MP5. No P90, so only 8/10

SiegeGG is a good resource too! They have a website and a twitter account. The twitter account posts stats after the matches if you are into that aspect.
---
Recruit's eyes make smiley faces and that just makes me so happy
---
I like to have points on, because then I get to see when I have an injure and I‚Äôm not sure. 
---
If I had Royal for the P90 I‚Äôd definitely use it cause holy shit is it beautiful. 
---
That's the thing tho, bronze isn't my own ranks either. I was plat last season and got 1 game from it this season before a bad streak that put me at gold3. I don't care if I play vs plats and diamonds, I just want it to be balanced. Not go against plats and diamonds but have bronze on my team.. That's just wack. 
---
I fear no man. But that *thing*... it scares me.

Why cant people just enjoy shit on this sub.  Every time someone has a nice play, everyone drags them down for it.  It's really annoying.

There are M+K on Xbox. But it puts them in games against controller people. Making it unfair. I think the separate servers would be good. If you want to play against M+K then you can. If you don't you shouldn't have that risk.

ADS movement speed is fine. Ubi needs to work around nerfing leaning and crouching. people who rebind their lean buttons and learn to play that way for 10/20 hours are suddenly gods compared to normal players
---
I like Buck a lot too. I have the goalie headgear, lumberjack uniform and Mech C8 skin. 
---
He's literally the only op I've spent the most money on
---
Kapkan traps only explode when activated, not when destroyed. The indicator is always shown as long as the trap is active, even through walls. Its not about what the design thought was behind the indicator, its how strong it actualy is and how it can be used.
---
*Actual glaz voiceline*
---
The issue is her pistol is far too good. It has always been and its about time it was brought inline.  You get an insane ability and an insane information potential whilst also having arguably one of the best weapons in the game.   
---
Yes she has counters.  So does Ash, her whole premise is speed and she gets ruined by trap based operators or proper reinforcement. 
---
? Levels of salt are so big that I want to take a break but I wait until she interrogates me and then leave
---
But there isnt support for it, you have to have an adapter unless you have an xbox one x
---
Yeah that's fair
---
Leaving while being interrogated doesn't stop the interrogation. All that happens is that you leave the match and the interrogation finishes 
---
They also asked for Bartlett and we know how that worked out.
---
Now that‚Äôs how you play
---
And that's important why?

She didn't have her scope on you and that's mainly why you died, long story short she hipfire headshotted you. It happens to the best of us.
---

---
I don‚Äôt wanna talk about how much I‚Äôve spent on ops. 
---
They do though. The issue isn't that they don't listen to feedback, it's that people expect them to actively respond to everything that is said. It's impossible. If they did that, nothing would get done.
---
Example: Kaids shotgun is bugged on console. You know it, I know it, ubisoft knows it. They never addressed it. Why? Because it was being worked on. Every single day there is at least 10 posts about how it's broken on console and why doesn't ubisoft ever respond and blah blah blah. If they responded everytime it was mentioned, it would never be fixed. Instead, they saw the issue, started work on it, and announced that it has been fixed on the tts and will roll out soon.
---
On top of that, a lot of feedback is either bad for the health of the game, incredibly repetitive or already being done or will not actively improve it. People want acogs back on bandit and Jager. But that would not be a good fix, and will never happen, so why even acknowledge it. People want castle changed in x number of ways. But they are already working on a rework, so why would they acknowledge it. People want lion changed, but it's been in the works for a long time, why respond to every post about it? People say X developer doesn't listen to feedback, but they do. They don't need to respond to every post or every gripe of the community though. They have other priorities that take precedent. 
---
It really isn't fine in comparison to other actually tactical games .
---
This hurts the tactical concept in the game 
---
They'll fix the current spam meta but the movement speed is not something they should leave alone 
---
Nice wallbang, bad joke

I almost threw up and upon closer inspection, turns out I had 1 hp left and not only that, the obj was a pixel away from being caught

---
Yikes 
---
Ash is picked because she has a good gun and long-distance breach charges. She's a fragger role and people love playing fraggers. That's why she has a high pickrate.
---
If anything, having more samples (players) in a data set makes the statistic more accurate. She has an almost perfectly balanced win rate.

Well said. I really agree with ranked should have "pro settings". Also the current ranked should be how casual is, besides the map pool and the number of rounds.

It isn't fortnite and the skins aren't for sale on a community hub like in cs go

That's it! If the skin gives you a tactical advantage, that's even better!

If said operators could breach exactly like current ones it would make said current ones gadgets less useful with the power curve.

I like how you wrote ‚Äúxbox‚Äù in lower case letters :D
---
I don't think there is a video game in history that has accurately represented what a suppressor actually does to a gun. It's some conspiracy between game developers that suppressors mean slower bullets mean less damage. The opposite is true. Suppressors can actually increase muzzle velocity and accuracy while reducing recoil and hiding muzzle flash.
---
If suppressors behaved in a realistic manner, there would be no reason to use any other barrel attachment.
---
Some have pointed out the use of subsonic ammo as the reasoning for reduced velocity and damage. You can fire full power loads through a suppressor just fine, it just won't be as quiet. Honestly though, suppressors are not nearly as quiet as movies and video games would have you believe. They are still loud, and with the engagement distances Siege has, would be heard just fine.
---
All of that being said, the guns in Siege make no sense anyway. Many of the attackers guns are chambered in .308 which makes no sense at all, given the close quarters and likelihood of hostages or explosives. The reload animations are often incorrect, and many of the guns do not actually exist in real life.
---
Its casual, who cares. Take your L like a man and move on.

unpopular opinion alert: i'd much rather they removed the indicators from lesion. he is one of the most played defenders simply because of his traps as a damage dealer AND intel provider. coupled with his great smg and balanced speed/armor he is very strong and popular, and i think there is no need for it. nerfing his smg didnt do much to change that, so i guess we now need to get back to his traps again

How new is your friend to the game?
---
Oh that's awesome! I usually stick up for younger or newer players because I hate when people are toxic towards new players who are just learning the ropes and getting the game down. Only difference is I usually don't end up queuing with them :/ 
---
Well at the risk of sounding like the weird overly forward guy if you are even interested in chilling and queuing together, let me know. That would be cool. I enjoy meeting others from the community and getting to know people and making new friends. If not, no hard feelings. I know it's a bit strange lol 
---
Me too, and then when people contact Ubisoft they say how the majority of people never team kill and how it‚Äôs so toxic and what not. Some times this game makes me mad
---
I think elo loss would be gamebreaking. But just a heavier punishment for ranked-game-quitting would be an option. 
---
This would be really useful for seeing the impact of certain players in response to others. Was it really a "Refrag" or was he just killing another player on the other side of the map. It could show who and when the bomb was planted, if a player denied the planter, if someone spotted on cams and the player spotted was eliminated relatively soon, etc. Makes for some good competitive analysis, and nothing says that this has to add to wait time. It could be an optional screen, as well as a post game report which for whatever reason Siege doesn't actually have at all, in contrast to other competitive and non-competitive shooters that have replay systems.
---
The siege gods chose Monty for me once and I've only played him twice before, I got a 4k and the siege gods also gave me glaz, gave him to me twice, got an ace both times

What's the point of playing on the TTS and reporting bugs in detail when Ubisoft doesn't give two shits about fixing them?

PEOPLE, THIS is how we had the reload glitch in Para Bellum. It was discovered on like Day 3 of the PB TTS yet still made it to Live AND caused the proleague to be delayed until they could fix it.

It would be nice to know which trap actually caught somebody, though.

Xbox caps at around 60-65, for most people at least

well i mean yeah but people will still quit nonetheless.

i feel like it should not be penalized if you lose in a situation where it would be near impossible to win - like a 4v5/3v5 all game, where each operator matters so much in siege that having 1 less is a huge disadvantage 
---
The thing is the game checks who you were queued with during ranked matches and how often it happened. If the game determined you joined the cheater before several matches took place, then you'll get screwed. If the game figures you just so happen to run into them, they'll leave you alone.

But with no elo loss you can just play two rounds, and if you see that the opponent is better than your team, you tell one of your teammates to leave so you do not lose elo. Any mechanics like that probably are going to be abused.
---
You mean **THE Holy Ban Wave**?
---
Oof
---
I couldn't imagine myself doing this, great job
---
Flashes, nades and then smokes all at once
---
Yes, but majority of the player base is on console and they don‚Äôt get to experience that
---
If you are unhappy you should call Ubisoft and ask them to send you the frame you‚Äôre missing out on.

Doesn‚Äôt the real KS have a ‚ÄúO‚Äù instead of a ‚Äú0‚Äù

Great job!

Spot on.

Played against him in a **casual** and hopped into his stream to say hey. Dude immediately goes off bitching about "fanboys that feel the need to harass [him] when they play against [him]". Kid needs a reality check

Pretty much. Hopefully I get a good one out of the 50 packs.

i'd like the opposite, remove Lesion's ability to see his traps.

I FUCKING LOVE IT!!!

I mean, it‚Äôs called **Technical Test** Server for a reason. It was designed mostly for checking if the stuff they implement even works rather than experimentation. 
---
Because it's the internet, it's illegal to just take it at face value.

The glass windows should have a durability like chanka turret shield. Clashes plexi shield should be countered by glaz. 2 impact nades should down any shield.

Thank you

Yea its pretty old from a few montha ago i just felt like posting something

If they actually implemented this concept with recruits, world peace would become a reality

Lol just realised that sorry

Glad that you think so \^\^

i play Kapkan just because because he has a good weapon option and a nitrocell..

the EDD is just some sort of  bonus..

We need acogs for our drones.

how do I delete someone else's comment

Come on

Haha it would honestly make the game unplayable but definitely worth a laugh. 
---
That sucks man. But it was probably a good play
---
Yeah every once in a m while my internet spikes to 300 and i need to restart it but it doesn‚Äôt show unless I go into a game
---
How did OP miss that 
---
You‚Äôre just mad he had this idea first

This is some high quality ms paint content

I didn‚Äôt ducking know that!!!

Isn‚Äôt Clash a well known rage monster?
---
Then the game scoreboard isn‚Äôt wrong, because I‚Äôm pretty sure it gets updated more often 
---
Ya it seems that way. Quite sad considering their biggest playerbase is apparently PS4.

There are sad people out there that tie up waaaaaaaaaaay too much of their self worth into a video game so they hire cheaters to boost them to ranks they wouldn‚Äôt achieve otherwise

Dude everybody in here is telling you that the spawn peeks are fine the way they are, and that you just need to improve at the counter play. But you are still insistent that everyone else is wrong, and that you know better. Pros don‚Äôt have a problem with spawn peeks, diamonds, plats, and Gold‚Äôs don‚Äôt have problems either. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs very easy to see where a spawn peek is coming from, and the attacker weapons are MUCH better at long range than defender guns. The problem here isn‚Äôt the spawn peeks, it‚Äôs that YOU don‚Äôt know how to counter play them. They only work against players who aren‚Äôt paying attention.
---
Upvoted immediately 
---
For starters if you think blackbeard should have a 0 hp shield then you clearly miss the point of blackbeard. Hes meant to peak and hold angles the initial problem with him though is his shield could take 10 bullets and not break. He also had incredibly strong guns too. But now hes a near dead op who's shield cant take but 1 bullet from frost SMG jagers assault rifle and maestros alda. Basically theres 3 fully automatic guns that 1 shot his shield and basically immediately headshot him. He was fully fair when his shield had 50 health that stopped a single bullet from each auto gun in the game then a second broke it. Almost every handgun in the game also broke it instantly at that time. Basically it allowed him to peak like hes supposed to then back off and change positions and shields.
---
People dont like him because he cant be headshot for an easy kill. Shields cant be headshot in the same way. Are you gonna tell me clash and monty are broken because they cant just be shot in the legs? Basically people dont like bb because he counters something they tend to rely on. My opinion of you cabt beat someone without a headshot then you dont need to be playing shooters.
---
My opinion and why I'm a blackbeard main is because currently hes one of the hardest ops to play and probably the hardest attacker to play. I'm actually good with him because I take the time to learn my peaks and my maps. I took my time to learn how to play him and how and were to peak with him. 
---
People find him inherently broken well guess what most of the ops in the game are broken on paper. Rook on paper makes you stronger to take more bullets but we all know hes not that broken he barely helps at all. Jackle sees your footprints then tells his entire team were you are. Alibi sets up holograms that tell were attackers are when shot. Basically my point is just cause an op sounds like they are very strong doesn't mean they are and I feel if more people actually took the time to play bb theyd see just how bad hes been nerfed because to actually be good with him you have to know and do stuff most people dont

Hopefully I don't get banned haven't played in weeks but I was gold 1 and 1 of my friends was plat 3 and this friend I have IRL is so attached to me that whenever I'm online he wanted to play with me no matter the game, he did placements with us and will get gold but in reality he wasn't even silver if he played by himself and did placements, well, last season he did placements alone and got copper 2, then played with us, a bunch of golds and plats...
---
Thank u
---
Did you add hit boxes to your drawing?

Her head is actually hittable this time, yes
---
Thanks, I worked so hard on it

So the Siege Youtuber Get_Flanked did a video about a week ago about what the Rainbow Six Siege SoloQ (AKA: the way the majority of the players have to play otherwise the system wouldn't be able to make matches) is really like. It's something I've considered doing something similar myself more than a few times, but I'm a nobody who is kind of a boring, ugly mess.
---
But this basically perfectly exemplifies a typical SoloQ match in Siege and why it's such a frustrating experience, and why it's so frustrating Ubisoft does nothing to help.
---
Because you take every problem you see in this video as basically your typical SoloQ match, and then add onto that the regular encounters of Smurfs, trolling/toxic teammates AND the fact that the system can't seem to understand that Premades vs. SoloQ = bad and does it all the time and you begin to understand why we want to put our KBMs and controllers through the screen.
---
Where does the friendly fire come from? Is this actually a bug and the grenade damaged himself while being on the other side of the wall?!
---
Yea I dunno about how I got friendly fired 
---
Good, but that means I don't like this drawing as much cos it's not realistic. Still good job mate!
---
As a shield recruit main; the shield sync is pure doodie and getting clapped by a blind Valkyrie trough the front of the shield is making me the big angy

I love it. The first time I saw it, I knew it had to be on my fridge.

just don‚Äôt be a headless chicken and shoot the guy

Eventually.... Yep..
---
Thank you! I feel like it isn't getting appreciated for its effort but instead being bashed for what it is, which is ok lmao
---
Usually have a 3 man squad and when we run into people like this we just take turns using them as additional target practice

---
You miss the point. Blackbeard should not exist. In a game where you are TRAINED to get headshots every single time there shouldn‚Äôt be an op to deny that.
---
Here‚Äôs the problem:
---
He shouldn‚Äôt be able to shoot at you while you can‚Äôt shoot at him. This is why Clash &amp; monty are balanced. They can‚Äôt shoot back at you.
---
Fuze, Ela.. Favela? Really like it though
---
r/hmmm
---
Try some other operators.
---
It Do *B* like that MOST of the time 
---
Mira is super useful and I really like her cause she‚Äôs a 3 armor but I also love Ela. Ela is just harder to use but when you ge fused to her gun she‚Äôs really good
---
I've drawn twitch in the past
---
When was the latest ban wave
---
The answer is that the bottom left ping counter is not refreshed until a round has started. The scoreboard ping counter is always accurate
---
ya i was hesitant to through him in there but unlike zofia or ash his gadget is less predictable, why i thought it mattered to include him:
---
when nomad shoots off a charge it sticks and cannot be taken back if the shot was bad, right? BUT this is an advantage to her since she can know for a fact that the device deployment is not going to be success and she should rotate to ensure safety, this is intel she is getting as a side effect
---
cap could use this realime intel after deploying, it may tell him "looks like although you thought that was a good shot, it was actually out of range, and hes by how much" .  you feel me? all of the nomad players get this intel up front, but not cap players so you do not get the learning curve on good places to deploy, make sense? 
---
Since you are buck main try drawing him
---
Funny thing was, I was actually going to but saw this instead
---
As glaz says ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù

I would like to see it when it's done

How much for this art piece?
