Developing a good single player costs massive amounts of resources while only providing a small number of enjoyable hours to the player. A good multiplayer mode on the other hand can keep players active everyday for years...

Thats quite an easy decision if you are Ubisoft.

Martydom: Drops a live grenade when killed

r/brandnewinsults
---
Yeah in the beginning everyone could hear every voiceline but that was not good for the game as it gave away your position at random times so they removed this feature
---
i always thought they took it out since it‚Äôs a school. figured it was too touchy of a subject now a days so they just took it out
---
Straight up executed
---
Holy shit
---
acog jokes aren't funny anymore
---
Can confirm. Delicious.
---
So headshots aren't actually a one hit kill. They do approx. 14x damage. So firing a shot through a wall sometimes causes enough damage dropoff to cause an injure upon a headshot instead of instant death. (I find this happens most oftenly with ela's gunning at a 3 armour through walls since her smg does such low damage per shot.)
---
That‚Äôs your opinion if you don‚Äôt like acog jokes

NEW HEREFORD BAD

OLD HEREFORD GOOD

It absolutely does, and you're frankly an idiot if you think this hasn't been a net positive. Now you can TK once tops then you're killing yourself, whereas before you could down an entire team and get off scott free.

This game steam edition only supports buying credits through steam, which is usually a good thing (because you can use your steam wallet balance instead of handling it to a glorified DRM app), but this system is buggy as hell, and can just lock you off from buying credits again. But if you really dont care handing more money to ubisoft, steam will do just fine.
---
How tf did you throw it up there, did they increase valk throwing arm this time?
---
I‚Äôd try Sledge and Rook as your first 2. i assume you‚Äôre talking about Dokkaebi and she‚Äôs not a bad operator, but has a team oriented gadget and weak guns. Sledge and Rook are good for beginners. 
---
if you already have all base operators then I‚Äôd probably try Maverick or Buck. they have good guns and good gadgets that don‚Äôt have a steep learning curve
---
Nope
---
how many times are you going to post this?

dibs on posting this tomorrow since it‚Äôs pretty much posted here every day

Rook, Doc, Sledge, Ash are the best 4 for starting out
---
But at Bronze / Copper, where you basically need to hold your own flank, he's a terrifying foe.
---
Didn't know that just joined, still wanna shoot it tho
---
Maybe cause I almost clutched a a 1v5 but like I lit up some dude with 10 shots and he still didn‚Äôt die
---
It's practice my man, I had the same issue when I started playing exspecially in 1vX situations, just teach yourself to breathe correctly, in through your nose out through your mouth, steady deep breaths, it sounds so stupid but forcing myself to breathe correctly improved my game, as it helped me keep my cool, and stop getting panicky in pretty much all situations. 
---
Also has made me feel more healthy overall aswell, since making myself get into the habit of breathe correctly when playing games just made it so I breathe correctly in normal life
---
But I already paid $20 for the standard edition. Would I have to pay the full price for the deluxe edition?

I think even with the people saying it was bad it should be playable (other than that mission in situations) . It is one of the original maps and should be playable to everyone at least in custom/terrorist hunt. This is a bit off topic but I think there should be a season where we dont get new ops and just get maps. Having ubi strictly work on a map gives them a better chance to balance it out
---
Big thanks, ill move towards saving to get them both.

Steam usually has a longer launch / patch request time, but rarely does that actually reflect on anything.

Only suggestion, like some other games, is that if you buy the game on Steam, make sure to buy the season passes also on Steam. (Or buy the game on Uplay, and buy season passes on Uplay)

If you mix/match purchases from the platforms, there is not guarantee the account will register them appropriatly

Never played it, is it as bad as that favela map? Everyone backs out when I get into that map.

I‚Äôve just recently came back to the game after taking a long hiatus from it, I had no idea Bartlett was removed from the rotation though, what were the main problems with that map that made them do that?
---
Silencer, it fits his role as a silent breacher / maker of holes
---
AND ash main
---
R6 is another game where you get better when not playing x) nice clutch tho!
---
How long on average would it take for the first interaction of the teams on any given map?   30-45 seconds or thereabouts?
---
Would turning off friendly damage in that time reduce TKing?
---
acog muzzle vertical grip, those things make it have 0 recoil

Standard meta is suppressor and angled but I mainly use muzzle and vertical

why even comment this

I really struggled to get out of copper this season. Not because I'm terrible or anything, but because there was no one to ever rely on and it was almost always me v.s. 3-5 people.

Take Hereford out of ranked
---
No,  i know this as i only check patch notes for Ela so I'd know if anything happens to het. And still so far she's gotten 0 buffs and still her 6 nerfs and counting. Likely more nerfs as ubi likes to hide shit. And Ela is still the worst roamer by the way and one of the worst defenders so don't think she's gotten any better. And yes I do main her and also she got a play time for me 12x more than my second most played defender.

Attackers: Sledge, Thatcher, Ash, Buck, Blackbeard.
---
Defenders: Doc, Rook, Castle, Kapkan, Mozzie.
---
They are easy to control weapons, with straightforward 'Gadgets' that are also easy to learn and place.
---
Attackers: Dokkaebi, Lion, Ying, Thermite, Montange, Blitz somewhat are designed around communicative groups that tend to at least coordinate between each other.
---
Defenders: Caveira, Echo, Pulse, Smoke, Mira, Maestro, Clash have similar reasons to above.
---
That doesn't mean that you can't play them and have fun, and do well, just how they are traditionally used.
---
hmm maybe the muzzle brake will be less
---
The only thing I like about new Hereford is the barrel room
---
But what does he actually say? Or is it just grammatically incorrect?
---
This frost mat will self destruct in five four three two one

old hereford was *fun*

Do people actually pay attention to operators genders? Is that an actual thing people care about?

idk I was just excited lol you don't have to be

What does that have to do with what he said?
---
Bad map.

That is most definitely NOT the standard meta.
---
Muzzle or Flash Hider is the standard.
---
Sadly, im not twitchy as fuck (lol) My reflexes are only sometimes on point, so I rely on positioning a lot. Thanks for the help!

On PC, at that point you would get shot through your shield
---
Than Favela or Yacht? Mama no.
---
I use a compensator on all the automatic guns, muzzle brake on dmrs and sometimes I put a suppressor on my pistol in case I mead to silently take out a camera. It all depends on the weapon really.
---
Yesss saitama!
---
nah favela is worse. It's just really easy to get spawnpeeked on bartlett

Disgusting.

For those who work around military and police departments I suppose it stands out a lot.

&gt;saying yikes unironically
---
I mean? Why not have a game thats based on realism, not have realistic ratios. I'm sorry that you got rejected by something but stomping on equality doesn't suit you
---
Looks like someone ran into the hall monitor, don't he bitches at everyone.
---
Hey no worries, you‚Äôre allowed to have an opinion. Just trying to make sure I understand you right. Maybe they had issues at launch with this, but who‚Äôs to say that the R6S team at Ubi hasn‚Äôt learned how to satisfy both. I mean if there were ever a game that could be ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù it‚Äôd be Siege, where they can pull inspiration from all over the world. So in that way they can be authentic and satisfy culture. And I think they‚Äôve done a good job of threading that needle so far, Siege feels like a game that the devs care about and love. Minus some glitches and needed patches.
---
As a Solo Queue Plat 3, I adore playing 5 stacks of Diamonds who are competitive players.

&amp;#x200B;

Completely agree, this sort of thing really needs to be looked at.

What's worse is when your team is entirely below level 20, and the enemy team is 2 silvers and 1 diamond. I had ten or so kills at the end and we still lost.

No shit? I mean.. what are you even talking about here? What are you even trying to say? I am honestly having a rough time figuring out what you found that makes you think I feel like R6S should be a boys' game? Nonsense. 
---
&gt;stomping on equality 
---
In case for you equality means that in a game there must be an equal representation of female and male ops I suggest you, my dear little snowflake, to step out and fight for real equality where it actually needs help. Again, this is just extremely nonsense and it feels like I am having a debate with primary school students who have no idea what they are talking about just wanna look smart.

You should

Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Claymores, deployable shields, the two I can remember

new hereford is a better map as far as balance and design go, but we all know old hereford is more fun to play on.
---
Huh, well that's good to know. Never heard about this tho, how long has it been like this?
---
Anybody reminded of that scene from the movie Friday. Where they both go ‚ÄúDAAAMMNNN‚Äù
---
If you aren‚Äôt twitchy try rook. He‚Äôs a 1 speed, 3 armor and has the ability to drop ballistic vests for your teammates. It gives you about 1 extra shot before being put into a down but not out state, and wil always put you in a down bit not out state, as long as you don‚Äôt get killed by a headshot. Also if you get killed, you already helped the team by contributing. But he so has the ability to put an acog on his weapons, which means you can sit on site and hold an angle instead of going off site aka roam.
---
You're the only one here writing long ass paragraphs. Lets get one thing right. Siege is a boys game to some people in the community. I'm not a snowflake. Don't call me dear thats creepy for one. And yes, equal representation in games is necessary if you want a successful game in todays society. Either that or face incredible backlash. I'm all for gender quality. But I'm not gonna fight over something as rediculous as this. ***its a fucking game***

All ubi has to do is make it so that you get a charm for the rank you finish instead of the highest rank you achieved. Then people are gonna hit diamond and play casual for the rest of the season? Nah. Have a system where you gradually lose elo for not playing ranked. Problem solved.

December 25th. Merry Christmas.
---
Yes, but there are more smurfs in the newcomers playlist than newcomers and it's ridiculous, that playlist is not an environment for people to learn the game. Casual is much better than the newcomers playlist, that's my whole point as to why ubisoft shouldn't add a whole new concept to casual so that newcomers can learn the game.

Shhhhh... you'll anger the spawnpeeking level 300 doc mains

Fair enough haha. Thanks

---
You seen the rabbits in the Aussie map?
---
No hes more of a ned flanders
---
Seriously I play this game quite a lot and I cant imagine not having an operator :(
---
Take into consideration the ops in Year 3, its ultimately up to you.
---
Remember the good ops like Maverick, Kaid, Maestro and Nomad.
---
Your officially a whole year late
---
I tried the red dot actually. Not that bad. I just dont like holo cause it feels too big for me.
---
1) i completely agree. Everyone has those two or three maps that you just can‚Äôt play on for some reason, yet Ubisoft refuses to add the ability to pick which map you play in casual or ranked. If I didn‚Äôt have to play tower, fortress, or Hereford my rank would be much higher. 
---
2) team balancing is a thing Ubisoft has been working on for a while. Only tips I can give is to play with a squad of friends around your skill set. Gamer link is an app I used for a while to find some people to play with.
---
Sony: "Yeah it's up to the developer."

Developer: "Yeah nothing else we can do."

Although those maps are shit in my opinion, don‚Äôt think u deserve the downvotes. Also however cliche it may be consulate, bank and chalet are my favorite simply because I believe they‚Äôre well balanced and have lots of spots to play every style
---
Your right
---
That's still less than 2 kills per round.
---
I saw that block like 30 times and didn‚Äôt think twice of it. I usually don‚Äôt break the environment
---
Nice work
---
I went 16 and 7 against golds while unranked this is nothinfg including you had to have thrown to get to that point so good on you
---
silly, Im part of the problem!
---
Rage kwiteed
---
Yeah so I dunno how they work exactlyyyyy, but it‚Äôs got to do with 1 of you possibly having slightly high ping. Essentially high ping player peaks, sees you, shoots you, but you don‚Äôt see them since there ping is slightly high.
---
Ok that was epic
---
honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind if they just renamed it ‚Äújapan‚Äù or something
---
Bro my school is littered with the cameras that look like that... as in there is three in the same hall

I don‚Äôt think that would go over well with the internet, all things considered. But yeah, we definitely need a change.

Yes, thats why I said you should actually fucking quit. Because if you're dying to random spray 99% (no shit its an exaggeration, it leads me to believe you still blame all of your deaths on something else though) of the time with 4000+ hours, you're obviously not going to improve.

I understand your opinion but don't worry, when I say that we need a renown sanction, it's only for player who is injured.

Didn't even know Instagram had game footage, just thought it was bad Photoshops and plastic booties.

I'd be ok with this actually. Would give people more reasons to pick her over the increasingly popular Hibana.

You guys are genius

Fun to play against too. Hearing that thunk thunk thunk thunk sound makes my immersion go through the roof.

I got that skin too its so good

Maybe there needs to be a new statistic, Like KD and win ratio there would be a TK ratio? If they had a high ‚ÄúTKR‚Äù you could kick them before it gets crazy. I mean hell! they earned it!
---
I used Wikipedia, actually N0kk was harder to pick weapons for, the Secret Service‚Äôs firearm weapons are quite boring and they almost appear in any modern FPS title :/
---
Are you on Eu or US?
---
Ubi have never gave any DLC operator a new loadout, Nokk can't have anything without it making her broken like Lion and Ela.
---
They can't add new guns anymore much because of data limits and engine limitations, Nokk should have gotten the MP5K also btw if you  remove the ACOG from the PDW9 Jackal has to suffer from it.
---
Probably a DXracer gaming chair right?

Initiation is much more viable than any site on this map rn the only one that is competibg would be droms Day care this Change would make things harder as it would be harder to hold both sites and harder to rotate and help If someone needs it for the other one the good thing about the current Initiation is that you can hold both sites from one site with help of a bandit tricker some impacts or a shotgun and some acogs making it very hard to attack
---
At first it looked like someone bashing their screen but when the block broke I was so confused, then I realised it was all on screen.  
---
What's with people on here not knowing how to screencap/record something.
---
The PDW-9 Jackal has is an ARP-9 and I‚Äôm just referring to the Honey Badger, so no nerfs to Jackal (he seriously needs a buff).

Yeah and the same for the AR.15.

She would be so much better if she was a 2  2 in my opinion

i like the position she is in rn, the only thing i would change maybe is the HP on the spikes. its to easy to kill them i feel.

Yeah i did the same i went from 1900 dpi with 8 = 8 sens to 800 dpi with 11 = 11 and it feels so much better and consistant
---
Is there a rank under wood 4?
---
If i play fuze my gadget works like emerald splash.
---
And this was a game of ranked
---
The PDW-9 Jackal has is an ARP-9 and I‚Äôm just referring to the Honey Badger, an entirely separate PDW, no nerfs to Jackal (he seriously needs a buff). Also I agree N0kk should‚Äôve been given an MP5k instead of an FMG-9, but at the moment I‚Äôm trying to find new weapons for this list.
---
I want all maps in casual from shit maps to balanced that‚Äôs what casual should be. Ranked is where ubi focuses balancing at and that‚Äôs what should be balanced and as fair as possible. Casual again who cares if you want to be sweaty that‚Äôs what ranked is for otherwise you deal with casual.

I couldn't disagree more.
---
Primarily because IMO your definition of Siege as  headshot/firepower centric game is off.
---
The entire game is about synergy and tactics.
---
Shields - in my experience are not even remotely OP -  even against a well coordinated team.
---
From cutting angles to trap meta, Shields are a well balanced too now.
---
And Blackbeard...mate, the game isn't about headshots. The game's about angles and intel. Dude needa buff if nothing else because he supposed to own peek angles and murder holes.
---
You do something cool no one sees, you do something dumb everyone sees

Siege hacks are 1. Widely availabe freely and 2. Super easy to make.

I don‚Äôt think that would work, match making times would be killer later on in the season with less and less people being ranked

Pay attention in class

So u can‚Äôt go recruit in the new rank? And what happens if u don‚Äôt have any ops unlocked

Well technically, he plays with subs. And subs aren't always the same rank as he is. So there are times he gets matched against low rank players.

Reverse friendly fire was added on patch 4.1.3 https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-347924-16/y4s13-patch-notes
---
"has always been slow, tactical gameplay" hahahah
---
I'm sorry, why does Ubisoft need to give a compensating factor to an operator they're nerfing for being too frequently picked?
---
Gg
---
If your not that good go more tactical operators instead of frags
---
Really? Only with subs?
---
You bought it previously on steam or Uplay?
---
Repost, sell your Reddit account you piano brain.
---
Your suggestion for unranked placements is happening in about two days. As well as ranked being taken out of beta.
---
However, they cannot deal with Smurf accounts, at least on console. They cannot access hardware ID on consoles to force people to matchmake at the highest rank on the console or prevent second accounts from playing.
---
uplay
---
Shit, are you me? Working life never gets easier
---
Oh then I'm not sure what the procedure is, I'm sorry.
---
I thought you meant against subs. Even if he plays with them, 3 people with plat on a team would definitely match against diamonds or plats. Even if two in your team are copper.
---
‚Ä¢ Fuze will get shot while placing his charge and has underwhelming fragging capabilities due to his armor.
---
‚Ä¢ Kapkan traps will just get shot at a certain level, Valkyrie would be the better intel operator. Weapons aren't that great either.
---
‚Ä¢ Frost has the same problems just as Kapkan.
---
‚Ä¢ You'll need to be really good with that MP5 to justify picking a Doc over Echos/Maestros utility.
---
‚Ä¢ Without proper map knowledge and recoil control, Buck can be quite frustrating.
---
That‚Äôs a real man‚Äôs ace
---
Not really, no. That's the flaw in the system. With 2 coppers on your team, you gets matched against bronzes.
---
I have to be honest, I'd much prefer to play against an obvious cheater like the one shown in the OP's video. They're just trying to get a reaction and usually get banned quickly. However, there are plenty of posers (i.e. the supposed next big thing in eSports) who subtly cheat and act like it's all talent. Companies like Ubisoft who make a tonne of money through multiplayer-only games need to be held more accountable. Licensing turnkey anti-cheat solutions, which are mostly ineffective, isn't actually addressing the issue and is merely a bullet-point on a marketing pamphlet.
---
Aw man, that was a nice headshot you got on me
---
How do you know?
---
The original AR-15 was an assault rifle. Without full auto mode, civilian AR-15 pattern rifles are not 'assault rifles', they're just rifles. You may be confusing the term 'assault rifle' with 'assault weapon' which is a pretty common mix-up in the US. The AR in AR-15 stands for Armalite Rifle.
---
**W O O P S**
---
Friendly fire is vital to how Siege plays today.  Do you know how hard it would be to hold many sites if attackers could chuck explosives and spray LMGs wildly while their teammates rush in?  Yes, many times (perhaps even most times) it's used to troll random teammates, but for games not plagued by trolls it's a crucial addition to tactical decision making and execution that would completely warp the nature of the game were it not in place.
---
What kind of low quality sh*tposting is this?

another bruh moment, we're lucky hehe

also my first alpha pack that game gifted was black ice for aug :p

I'm a smoke main I mastered that SMG, plus the FMG = Non-existent recoil = good + Low damage &amp; a below average rate of fire = bad. I'll give it a try again with the new hollow.

Wow you‚Äôre really good at blitz

Yeah
---
it has me wonder why she didn't get the Honey badger it would have fit her stealthy playsyle tbh or even the MP5K mute has, it's way too late for them to give Nokk another gun but I wish they would, Nokk will become mediocre and likely never used agaibn with her current weapons but it's kinda unfair Warden has the SMG-12 and she doesn't.
---
A bomb diamond would not even bother playing in secure due to the mode being an unbalanced piece of crap. And thats why people that play on secure get to diamond faster than when playing bomb. Speaking from personal experience...

If you think your internet can handle it haha

I've kinda been having a similar problem but with my Smurf, I cannot start solo t-hunt matches and I cannot join games. It is really quite frustrating. I left my account alone for a little bit and then I could play t-hunt solo but I don't know about online matches.
---
Xbox controllers are even more uncomfortable it feels like you're holding some deformed piece of garbage imo
---
Ok, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me

 I think the servers are down at the moment because a lot of people are having the same problem now, including me. And i've been told that for honor is having the same issue
---
Yes the servers are down..
---
Do you think everyone is experiencing this?
---
Me too bruh
---
Yup
---
So you are muting everyone from the start and still wonder why people are still trying to vote kick you? Just go into the match with a friend to completely negate the vote kick feature. Why should Ubisoft remove the vote kick system?
---
The system is there so we have a fighting chance to get people that don't want to be apart of the team in a team base game out of our matches.
---
Shite

It's ok.

Sorry i just tought it was funny

Yer personally the best is the plane in mid map. Use mute and one hides behind the bed and other in the small room next to it and they can only go through the door in front of the bed
---
I don't need to be abused online I play for fun 
---
I play as a team I even main doc to help others but recently I get too much abuse and it's not because I'm not playing as a team it's because I'm not great at aiming
---
They never did, they kept shooting me the next round and the following round. Even if I don't kill them
---
Yeah you should look at your self and your feed is full of gay shit üòÇüòÇleave rn
---
you should get the pass and the year 1 operators
---
Okay thank you, I appreciate it
---
Whenever that happens, they shoot me twice each round, i wont be able to take the hit fir one round if they keep shooting.
---
God damn Neckbeards even here! #AD MORTEM INIMICUS
---
Did to ask them why?
---
But why? That's a Nerf.
---
None of the editions come with the legacy ops i believe

its moment like this when i feel that i dont blame them for reporting me.
---
Repost fuck you
---
$5 says this guy just died to a good Maverick player and now thinks that Maverick is OP
---
I think trying something new is always good. If Rainbow was always a realistic tactical shooter and Ubi didn't take a single risk the series would become stale. Maybe Quarantine is the wrong risk, we'll just have to see.
---
You have a yellow plug up in the corner which means your connection is lagging
---
Wow I haven‚Äôt seen anything but common for 3 weeks
---
Hmm I guess we'll how about two burst?
---
I dont think there is. You might just have to buy the year passes for the other operators till probably be cheaper then buying ultimate edition after you just got deluxe.
---
Exactly. We have all the resources we need. This is a game based on gadget as much it is based on guns, and we have enough guns.
---
 People just want a reason to complain, like how the complained about Dok, lion (both justified), blitz (also kinda justified), an with those 3 more-or-less regulated, they turned to jackal.
---
Yea my friend who isnt that bright to begin with

---
I agree that it can be abused at times. I've been in many gamed where I've been kicked before I even load the operator menu, just because I'm below lvl 100. I agree it needs work, but shouldn't be removed entirely, I feel your pain

Yeah, most people get killed by blackbeard because they are being to aggressive. If a blackbeard is peeking a window and you peek that window than that is your fault. Kinda like maverick, if he makes a hole in a wall and you decide to peek that and get killed, then that's your fault.
---
Reposting scum

Maverick himself is perfectly fine rn, they should only rework his gadget so it works like a real blowtorch, or you know, just make it more audible or add some more light to the flame
---
My friend bought the deluxe edition and he started with all legacy ops and the year 1 ops though
---
Well, don‚Äôt tell me :D

wait why are the team names the opposite color if they are all attacking operators?

a hundred and fiddy percent

Because I paid for the best possible version of a game, expecting to get content that was released *4 fuckin years ago*

or nerf his weapons...

Why is everyone just saying this as if it's confirmed fact? It isn't confirmed at all. Everyone said BH would be Tuesday the 5th and it was Wednesday the 6th.

No but you can buy a whole season of operators in a bundle. So I guess in a way it‚Äôs a pass but not really.

Buck is great, when you can handle his gun.

Well, actually if you play as a team (at least in ranked) you shouldn‚Äôt care, I usually just tell the others where it is downed if I‚Äôm not near them... so they know where the enemies come from, or are about to come
---
I have tried IQ and she was a my main for a while but I really just wanna help the team like Thatcher or Finka.
---
Tbf in this post you just talk about rebuying the game in hopes of getting the ops
---
It's not just Siege on that front, sadly.
---
I am on XBOX. I first found it so hard to aim and sometimes it can still be but bear in mind I have been playing for a very long time(literally the only game I play) and have practiced a lot in t-hunt and casual and even taught my friends so just give it a while. DON'T give up! You will get there,siege just takes a while to master and that's fine it's not like COD...the next R6 game won't come out next year but probably around the late 2020s! A lot of time to practice!!
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt know that, I only came across it once
---
The only argument I'm making is that 11th isn't a confirmed release date. I'm right on that.
---
IF you think that's weird, try having to buy atachments (sights, grips, barrels) for each op.  That's how it was when I started
---
To defend the way it is, having the price go up every time you buy an op from that CTU encourages you to spread the love and buy (and try) ops from multiple CTUs.  And the price is pretty low.  The 150k+ renown I get a season seems pretty average (and makes paying 25k per new DLC op not a big deal).
---
That‚Äôs a good friend.
---
As a Tachanka main, dokkaebi and jackal are the worst possible ops to come against. One thing that makes tachanka semi-viable is to set up in unexpected locations. Sure drones can still ruin your day, but people need to actively seek out your position then. With jackal, all he has to do is sniff your footprints from half the round ago and skadoosh, you've just been wallbanged, or you need to abandon your turret. Dokkaebi isn't as bad since they just know your general location so you still have a chance at fighting back, but jackal is the worst against tachanka, more so than lion because lion only works if you move.
---
My friend I play with is a hard Jackal main, so if I get the chance I‚Äôll give him a try!

He‚Äôs depressed because he can‚Äôt kill the hostage.
---
Hell yeah
---
Well done man!
---
I‚Äôve always wondered where that audio was
---
Yes. I do work.
---
Yeah I love people like that who forget the objective over getting kills
---
Had this happen once, except I was fuzing obj from the room above. One of the hockey pucks bounced back up, got caught in the floor, and killed me
---
Edit: autocorrect messing with me
---
Just google the minimum and recommended specs. Probably will set you back 600-700 for a low or mid tier with used parts PC.
---
Nomad is a great aid to Jackal, and the team in general, although her gadget requires some practice. Her weapons are decent, I think.

I can never find a game of ranked so :L

Welll yes, but actually no

I'm on PlayStation, and IDK if it's on it, and if it is, I'll need to get for real cheap, as I don't spend 60$ a year on games

Lol play ranked bro

A diffuser is something that diffuses(spread out/distribute/scatter). A defuser is something that deactivates something or could also mean reduce/lessen, like in ‚Äúdefuse the situation‚Äù.

They literally just got the game a couple of days ago.

Unless this offers something different, everyone's going to use the official Discord as usual

Am I the only one bothered that we can see blitz‚Äôs smile through his balaclava?

I'd give gold if I wasn't a poor bastard

So fuck all those who don‚Äôt have a five stack. Also it‚Äôs down to seven maps now
---
Only somewhere from 8 to 15 seconds. Seems fine to me
---
Veri nice.
---
bucks recoil is very manageable. A lot of people can make it a laser beam though this is on pc. You might be talking about on console
---
first shot of the second burst was on his shoulder again yes, the one after that was on his head though. you can clearly see it man
---
Always remember that when you crouch walk it‚Äôs the same speed wether you‚Äôre aiming down sites or not. So if you have a good handle on where the heads are on standing enemies it‚Äôs pretty easy.

Oh I miss the old fuze pucks that would bounce through 3 floors and kill you lol

I had that problem. I just waited for 15-20 minutes and it loaded.

Ive had this problem since white noise except it doesnt just do it after a t hunt

It should actually be easier on console (Xbox at least).  You don't need hardware ID.  It's pretty clear from gamer score (which is visible to anyone) that an account is smurf.  If you scraped that and segregated those with a low gamer score into a separate lobby, it would greatly reduce the incentive to smurf.  You would catch a vast majority of smurfs (although not long-term or multi-game smurfs) and relatively few non-smurfs.
---
And it is rampant on Xbox right now (between 50 and 75% of my matches have at least one smurf).

No, because you dont have the brain power required to understand that trying to kill people with your shock drone is detrimental to the team. But youll live the rest of your life in ignorance. And its not my worry to get you out of it.

I mean they made 2 separate skins (glacier and black ice)

"Where is the enemy?"

"aisle 12"

"..."

"He's in Hardware"

It was the enemy team hitting the server. They do that durin
---
You mean that that server went to another planet?
---
Probably not. If the map broke and they couldn‚Äôt fix it. They would never live it down ohhhhhh!
---
To do that with iron sights and elephant skin camo is just even more disrespectful to this team. gg.
---
did he finally invent something to shrink his head to a normal size?

Damn they all had proleage skins so they were actually a team.

Aww thank you! I really enjoy painting the gun skins from Siege for Cosplays, but it is very time consuming. As much as I'd love to open a shop and do commissions, I'm just too busy. :(

That what we have in middle east üò≠

would you rather they leave some out?

I will call support. It tells me to purchase more coins. Thank you for quick insightful response

i played already 14 hours...

Thank you! &amp; oh I know, I absolutely regretted the chungus picture in there, but the enemy's name was "chungus" so like, I could not, not put it in LMAO.
---
When you finally kill that plat recruit who is wrecking you in casual.
---
Probably people struggle on countering clash?

I looked up alot of paint making tutorials online and followed those. c:

It‚Äôs just a large amount of Ops for 5v5

Because it would be too powerful

Oh sorry that you saying something else read it wrong. My bad lol
---
ITS DEFUSER!!!!!!!!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up making a new game mode with more players on each side. It would be kinda nice having such a large pool of ops to chose from, but I also definitely feel like it's slightly overkill
---
Congrats! I get to Gold II and then get shoved down the stairs to Silver.
---
Clash without boys on the defence shield gang :(
---
Surprise motherland facker
---
I promise you the only people that complain about spawn peeks are shitters. I don't complain about them because 99% of the time I don't die to them. The dude holding the angle on Helipad and still dying?? Shitter. The buck running down the steps? Shitter. The dude complaining in the comments because he some how died while getting WH? Shitter.
---
Why was there no warning that he jumped out?
---
Never happened to me. Maybe a connection problem?
---
Thank you good sir. If you want a custom background for yourself, just hmu. I have currently nothing to do, so why not make someone happy :)
---
3d printed with led light? Did you use brass piping for the motors?
---
Most probably an unpopular opinion, but I think if the leaning mechanic was to be removed from the game it would make gunplay a whole lot more interesting, no more pixel angles that strongly favour only 1 player. If you want to hold an angle a good part of your face and body will be visible now.
---
loads of shitters\*\*\*
---
Every map
---
Nice spot
---
Neato

So dokebi is a great operator to assist with other teammates she‚Äôs not really a lone wolf play style I think people overlook that. She really shines getting you and teammates in the facility or calling up late round straggling defense. Depending on your proficiency with shotgun or in bigger maps I actually use her rifle suppressed (but that‚Äôs just me) shadow other players, assist them getting inside facility or clearing rooms and work the obj don‚Äôt lone wolf for now.
---
Yep, and aww com on I know she has a lower win rate than tachanka but still she's really useful,  she's like and annoying little mosquito
---
I don't see how anything changed
---
No u
---
Wont lie I get pissed when I die to it lol, noone likes dieing within the first 30 seconds in casual to then watch your teammate(s) "try" to clutch for the last 3:30.
---
Then my face switches over to Fuze there
---
Why?
---

---
The Fire weapon skin did for me.

I'm an echo main and after playing multiple times of reborn ranked, I found that **ECHO IS ALWAYS IN THE BAN LIST**
---
The matchmaking preferences are got T hunt only.
---
Echo main here. Echo is always in the ban list. Echo, damn.
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about
---
Yeah that's why. I had too many last minute plays ruined by her annoying ass
---
Half day
---
Half her kit is just jager
---
would be a very nice idea aswell, but it would drastically increase a game time just for getting a map, but i do i agree with that idea
---
Where can i find it?
---
I absolutely hate when teams do that. Everyone starts screaming at once and there‚Äôs always 1) the idiot trying to get you to go headhunt the last guy. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs over there! No what are you doing? Go get him!‚Äù Why would I do that? He has to come to me to win, I don‚Äôt have to go get him. 2) The person with the bad call outs. I have legitimately lost so many games because it‚Äôs the last 25 seconds and I couldn‚Äôt hear anything while people were screaming callouts. Had they not been shouting ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not in obj, he‚Äôs roaming! Go in!‚Äù I would‚Äôve been able to hear him crouchwalk back in and lean. Let me just play the freaking game. 3) The person who votes to kick you out when you don‚Äôt follow the advice of the other two people. Usually the first person to die every round and has gone 1-1-3 so far.
---
Wonderful! Had about 3000 stockpiled, lol..
---
Then again any gun is good is you land headshots. Besides alibis shottie pistol that thing cant even 1 shot headshot
---
I know lmao,
---
I'm a shitter sadly and this happened to me yesterday, but I'm not sitting here talking shit about anyone that does it, it was my fault!
---
You mean the defuser? Please negatively react to my comment pointing this out.
---
could be playing in school without headphones. I've done it before
---
also a pre-RIP for secure area people :(
---
smiling blitz is fucking cursed
---
Yea i knew of that. It is not new though, so that's why i didin't include it.
---
I‚Äôve won like this before and it‚Äôs awesome haha
---
The original Hereford base, bottom floor secure the area is probably my second favourite scenario but this new one I haven‚Äôt got used too
---
Play casual
---
So find different people
---
Yeah well obviously. Thing is, Spawn peeking and run outs are pretty cut and dry at this point. I play in plat every season, and I'll do dumb spawn peeks and run outs in casual sometimes when I'm fucking around, but I rarely do them in ranked. Because plats know most the spawn peeks, they keep drones alive for sound info on broken windows and walls, and they can punish players who get greedy. Most high level players in this game know that, if you're running out, or spawn peeking, 99% of the time you're at an obvious disadvantage. Your only advantage is the element of surprise. I see low rank players waste drones, run blindly out of spawn, and not be cognizant run outs. As much as run outs are unfortunate. I'd prefer they be a thing, than giving an attacking BB the advantage by allowing him to sit on a window all round, with no way to fight him besides walking right in front of his paper mache shield
---
It's hard to see look at his old smiley face and turn it to the side. His nose is pointed and straight. But on the new headgears his nose is curved cause during chimera they had a model change and made his skin color and nose different. He used to be white as shown in his popup card when you hover your mouse over him.
---
Fuze is just way too much fun. Always get a good chuckle off a Fuze kill.
---
Damn gg
---
Go to flairs, then click on EDIT up in the top right corner, then add whatever OPs you want there through :Fuze: :Kapka: and etc
---
Yep, and sadly no. It's not gyroscopic.
---
I don't think it would dramatically increase the game. 15 seconds each for both teams to choose one map to ban and the game randomly chooses from the remainder.
---
Nice
---
Well I mean as what are supposed to be the motors opposed to having to rig a whole system for that lol
---
Thats just sadüòÇ
---
with the boys\*
---
good job
---
Yo thank you so much for releasing this. :)
---
All we have to go by is the ramblings of a rage quitter, how do we know which team the cheaters were on?
---
may as well play like that every game for me. copper 3 player here like a boss
---
tbh I like secure area more than bombs
---
This nigga put a red dot in his beans
---
Or just rekove acogs from all guns except dmrs and add some actually good 1x scopes
---
Its amazing how much scopes quality and variety suck in siege with it being a fps designed around cqb
---
Yeah I just wish that the multiplayer ones worked.
---
I main cav, echo,and jackel
---
I‚Äôll have to try it, those sights are nice
---
It's a really weird culture. I see a lot of cheaters where they say they're doing it for "fun" and they don't take it seriously, but then I've seen videos where cheaters Hacks fail to lock onto a head because a board of wood or something confused the program and then they die... then they rage!!! It's not about taking the piss out of people, it's about wanting to win so bad that you'll do anything. They're genuinely angry that they can't win and need the W sooooooooo badly that they cheat. They like to kill people and call them "retarded" or "stupid" even though they didn't even legitimately get the kill themselves. It's an incredible look into the human mind.
---
Damn against golds as well. Honestly impressive! Thought this would have been copper or something.
---
That shit was *spicy*
---
?
---
This could easily be just a thing for 1x sights. Haven't tested it but he only did red dot vs an acog. And also angle holding is a big a part of the game but even if the person who can't see the angle holder the likelihood of them dying even if they can see is almost 100% since they already have an angle on them
---
the last we need are more reasons to pick caveira...
---
Lion isn't wholesome though.
---
Looks good! If any new players or free weekenders are reading, definitely take the advice on recommended starting ops and in that same vein, DON‚ÄôT pick Caveira and Glaz unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
This is what happens when you don‚Äôt ban an attacker
---
What happened?
---
It doesnt for me
---
He tried to kill me with Bucks Nades. Simply said, hes not very good. We did however lose, because he went Echo and constantly zapped me and he tried to get defuser on attack and run into the corner of the map and/or flash me with Blitz
---
-173849
---
You always need a Demoman... Because if not then he wouldn't be discussing about it, now WOULD HE?
---
not everyone is a pro league player. Not everyone cares about winning or losing. Not everyone knows how to counter certain ops. A lot of players just want to have fun. Having a blitz round the corner and instantly flash and melee them is not fun. Lower ranked players have a hard time dealing with shields so it would make sense that they would ban them. Understand that everyone is not like you. A lot of people, especially lower ranked players, are playing the game for an entirely different reason than you. This is just the discovery playlist. When the new season comes out you can go backed to ranked and play at your platinum level and ban the ops you plat players want to ban and leave the lower ranked players alone.
---
This is because of the distance to the wall is different.
---
-173850
---
I can‚Äôt think of a scenario where Thatcher is useless. Probably the best main in the game.

Thanks a bunch!
---
I agree he should
---
If the game mode had some bad balancing issues i would have turned off secure area by a long time.
---
Ofc its not perfect but i rather not have to end up every game seeing the enemy team plant the bomb near a door or window and then pixel peek it. Meanwhile me with my controller am fucked.
---
Did the last guy get tkd or dc
---
I've played many hundreds of hours of this game and for a vast majority of it I've had no problems
---
Love it! Where did you find this OP?

Congrats to you too! Placement matches can be a plain...

I‚Äôm on PS4, what are you playing on?

The audio is fucked that's a common problem not just yours

Yeah learning the maps will definitely be a priority for me. Thanks for your response!

Do you use voice comms at all? I‚Äôve seen people get TK‚Äôd and kicked specifically because they refused to talk.

Noted. Thanks for the advice
---
Yes but they aren‚Äôt in game chat, they are all in a party together
---
Terrorist hunt as practice and warm up, pick maybe 2 or 3 ops per side and really learn their ways. Once you get a feel of how the game works for a couple ops you'll pick up new ones much faser. 
---
Id say t-hunt and try all headshots in easy mode, hard mode with no damage is a decent goal. 
---
Make sure to turn off aim assist though, as it is only active in t-hunt anyway, so you could be one tapping everyone there and struggle to hit someone looking away from you in casual
---
Lol I just paid $60 for one from a different seller. Artisan caps are expensive!

Unfortunately I play on PS4 otherwise I'd be happy to play, I'm 37 but an adult? not so sure ;]

What platform are you using for this

Console or PC?
---
Casual or ranked?
---
Low elo or high elo?
---
Casual
---
every enemy I encounter has eye of the eagle and moves of a snake D:
---
Nice one! That one tap pistol on the first kill was brutal! Good job keeping your cool on the last kill! It had to be Vigil as last lol!
---
Umm I'm gold 2. The difference in mmr between a gold 2 and plat 2 is AT LEAST 600mmr. Seeing as im at 3000 It's at least 700mmr. But noooo. They can just queue with a copper and get golds to play against. I'm not playing against anyone near my skill level. Does that make sense?
---
Console and both casual and ranked
---
1. Clash is disabled rn
---
2. Clash is a defender
---
Ah, I‚Äôm sure someone who see this will have a ps4
---
Hostage game mode, kill them all first
---
No prob. Hopefully you find good use for her, I don‚Äôt play her too often but she can be a ton of fun
---
Thanks for the advice! I'll turn off Aim Assist and Aim for the head.
---
Thank you
---
Well apparently PS4 casual is very toxic, ranked is completely fine
---
Secure are is the most solo friendly game mode. Not everyone should have to find a team. Especially if you like playing solo.
---
Upgrade the pc bro, thas about all you got. If you shift-tab in game, look at steam guides for increase fps, theres one with a few boot settings to set that may help
---
Anyone else feels like it should have said "when you set a deactivate with the boys"?
---
Are you console or pc?
---
If you liked it the campus novels move much faster.
---
Just curious, do you only find out if you get the charm or not until the entire event is over?
---
Echo is sleep
---
Its really bad now. no matter where u play people are just absolute cunts on it. the bigger the game gets the more scum it attracts and now it really is at boiling point. not a single game goes past now where someone isn't an asshole for no reason, sweats like a fucker in casual, throws games in ranked just because their ash rush or spawn peek didn't work on the first round, and god forbid u even talk because immediately its just team kill or shit talking. the game was better when it was smaller. on all platforms and game modes.
---
Do you know if you can get it while the event is still going on or do you get it after it‚Äôs all over ?
---
That‚Äôd actually be really cool. But is there a plant site down there though?
---
These damn PR people, so slick
---
just saying, the connection icon is showing so it means either you have bad connection or someone else does, slowing down the server so its not the games fault
---
Not yet... he has to pass the hostage challenge

It‚Äôs a meme, dummy.

Secure is being removed? From ranked only or casual too?
