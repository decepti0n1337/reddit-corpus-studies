Not with Kaid from what I understand
---
---
---
Happy new year to gsg9 operators
---
Does baby need a bottle?
---
*Sensei*
---
As a Hamburg Citizen I sure love to see Kanal being bombed and shit.
---
If you have Dokkaebi on your team the enemies will drop their phones on death which she can hack. That point penalty is from shooting the phone.
---
Now isn't this true?!
---
I'm 90% sure this used to be a thing, but it got removed? On PC at least. I remember downing people as cav and when they left they got auto-interrogated. What happened to that feature?
---
I..... hmmm. Dont have kaid yet, but shouldnt that give you extra points too? Or does kaid not get points for destroying gadgets?
---
Sledge = has like 30 hits with his hammer that's 30 walls right there
---

---
Zofia = has 2 puny impact grenade things for 2 walls.
---
Sledge is good for vertical play
---
Zofia is good for replacing ash not sledge 
---
Only I can say is get better GPU. Sorry, I'm not English speaker enough, but I've seen some forums about that type of videocards and there was a case when people buy the same card but with different specs. For ex. GIGABYTE 1030 uses GDDR5 and Palit 1030 uses DDR4, so as a result GDDR5 runs better than DDR4.
---
Rip my man sledge. 
---
But also If you’re making this argument you didnt have to wait for zofia. Ash’s charges are better in every way except for being louder. 
---
Bruh, I'm Plat II and I still blindly run into claymores sometimes. 
---
How TF do you like kanal? It's an awful map, not even close to competitive ready. Yikes
---
How am I being a baby when the matchmaking is obviously broken? Quit trying to start arguments with strangers on the internet. Get a life, retard

Literally Fortnite Save the World smh

It’s just you 
---
Gnades, the L85 is a solid rifle, full auto secondary. Sledge is far frok obselete and is a great op for both new and experienced players. Espically for vertical maps.
---
Every op has their uses. People don't choose operators for their abilities alone. Plus it's just all down to personal preference.
---
I know the whole sub was.... whoosh?

His hammer is very good for vertical gameplay. It’s somewhat quieter than Buck. I don’t think his hammer needs a buff because frankly I think it’s good if some ops are situational. 
---
Fuze Buff*
---
Sledge is quieter and has way more hits
---
Hell nah he's good as he is rn
---
What gun is this for? 
---
The GPU I have is definitely GDDR5
---
Finger banged him.
---
And this is why I sleep in 
---
i’m confused on what you did? sorry i haven’t played r6 since last season
---
Here is my proof (https://reddit.app.link/55jT6rzO6S) 
---
Platinum at level 77 tho
---
Well yes, but this is a kill not a destroyed gadget. He does get the "Barb wire bonus" 
---
What an epic gamer adventure!
---
Its an all class skin
---
Download the skin. All "digital content" has to be manually downloaded to use. Gold is also a universal skin. Have fun.
---
I was just testing this and yes it does boy is defense in for a rude awakening 
---
I addressed that stuff, read the post. And running around sledging dozens of floors isn't an argument for vertical play or him being a good character. It's just a lame strat that'll get you killed against anyone decent. Vertical play is only an advantage because you can see better, and you have cover from the ground to your upper body. You get none of that in this game when breaking floors.
---
Wawawawa, it’s a game it’s shit obviously broke you don’t need to bitch on reddit cause something goes wrong every one in 100 games 
---
what's 1right 1 down
---

"again", never went away mate, never will.
---

---
It’s so confusing at first glance, smiley or frowny?!
---
Hard Xd
---
Thank you
---
Its not a hack, its a glitch and its quite easy to do sadly. You can "fix" the polygon mess by turning down your shadow quality.
---
Try restarting 
---
I feel like this will go straight through the fort when it gets stepped in, and will probably work like a damaging, unsmackable, even slower razor wire
---
I don't have Zofia, I don't have any of the season passes. But offensive teams always seem to use her and I never see sledge much except in casual.
---
Idk about you but when i rejoin a match it takes awhile for me to load in
---
My friend had this happen too on ps4
---
Not really. 
---
Filthy smurf.
---
Well its not that nobody can get into your account, its just a lot harder. They no longer have to just brute force your password, but guess a constantly changing and random one ontop of that. Which is hard. 
---
Or they could do the big 1337 haxors and just haxors into ubi's servers like a 1337 haxor man. We all really should be scared for our accounts if thats the case. Ya know how no security is 100%.
---
But eh, most likely was just a lying OP. Or he had a 'friend' borrow his account.
---
I'm not even gonna try to defend myself because you just made your self sound dumb as fuck
---
Well he just said house is his other favourite map. I doubt he i a very competitive player and that’s obviously fine. I’d say he just likes maps for the feel and not so much how they play 
---
You smacked him in the head
---
Just ranked brah. 
---
I was testing if the Black Eye would do enough damage to destroy the armor (sorry i'm a toxic) but then I accidentally trapped a Rook in my Pokéball (he disconnected).
---
Funny how the second that gun fires, it's going to jam. The slide doesn't have enough space to chamber a new round. Gonna bend a round and ruin the spring.
---
Was the hostage killed in this incident?
---
[removed]
---
This would make it op since you would need someone like sledge to break it because breach charges won’t work and every time you hit the castle barricade you will get shocked and doing it will make you lose 60 hp just trying to break one barricade. What if it’s a 1v1, you are on 20 hp as twitch with claymore and obj has been castled and fully reinforced, can’t use your drone because that will get destroyed as soon as it goes under the barricade 
---
For a buff I suggest maybe giving castle 1 more barricade and se where he goes from there?

Same reason why she is black.

His shield is V E R Y shaky and doesnt protect at all. I was killing blitz T H R O G H the shield so ...
---
Well I remembered that it said "electrified barbed wire bonus". At least maybe on just at bandit
---
Something should be done
---
Casual matchmaking is not affected by rank at all what are you complaining about?
---
Why ?
---
A theater mode would be awesome to be honest
---
Nope
---
That's *litteraly* kanal lmao. Not a single curved wall. Albeit 2 staircases, I think it's a boring, attacker favored map. 
---
I used to play the Fortnite STW but then I quit it
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Its a pretty old clip but one of my proudest moments
---
Im a madlad
---
oh, i thought that you threw the black eye while he was grabbing it, so he became stuck because his hands were stuck in that animation. still pretty funny lol
---
There actually probably not right now as there off for the holidays 
---
Sledging dozens of floors isn't an argument for vertical play or him being a good character. It's just a lame strat that'll get you killed against anyone decent. Vertical play is only an advantage because you can see better, and you have cover from the ground to your upper body. You get none of that in this game when breaking floors except in very specific spots which there are very few making Zofia equally viable for that. More hits and slightly quieter is a mute point for any efficient player or playing a well organized team. I agree with people saying his weapons are great and he has frags. But from a strategic stand point, he is vastly inferior. In a 1 on 1 gun fight he's fine and not necessarily better.
---
Don't get me started on the MGL because the M203 is obstructing the barrel and will likely cause an issue with the 40MM.

Never mind your right I was thinking that because of invitationals was mid February 
---
Happy New Year mate!!
---
My heart is whole 
---
The point is that's not supposed to happen, so it shouldn't.
---
0/10 not a bomber kill
---
It's 2 rectangles with a connector that makes roaming high risk/reward. Very unique map that will be made boring. 
---
Yeah but ash is more picked than zofia
---
Thank you. Same to you!
---
That was like the first thing I did in this game
---
If it just randomly started happening try updating your drivers 
---
If you think that, then you're just a bad player that's all.
---
Game is stale af. New maps will be the same as new Hereford and the Italian map, ops will be copy/paste. 
---
it should be lol, like i wouldnt want to get smashed every casual if i want to have fun lol
---
I thought it might jut be on default ops but maybe not 
---
I mean Ash has always existed 🤔
---
Boi, I bow down to your mastery
---
I thought it shows first as in most recently visited. 
---
Oh wow. 
---
Is nice to see this skin in different lights. 
---
I agree with this, but keeping the OG operators in good balance with the rest is important.
---
Ok thanks, I’m going to try him out

---
But people use vertical play in pro league 
---
Uniqueness doesn't mean fun, yeah it's subjective to opinion, but I think kanal is the most boring map and is entirely attacker favored unless running anchor trap meta. 
---
I know it baby.
---
Ok
---
Im not going to edit it unless I think that I need too. But her is a disclaimer before commenting.
---
The reworks are my opinions and I do not believe that one of them should be up into the game without testing.
---
These are my opinions on her current state.
---
I thought of making this because of my ranked match making experience 12/31/18 where I saw ash being picked and argued about 9/10 times.
---
Well shit man idk, it could be anything 
---
Only 20 hours?  
---
Mine's 19 days.  
---
It was still a great ace. But the most known one is Kisxtar's one with Ash on plane. 9 secondes I think. 
---
O no
---
It's on attack
---
Or roughly 50.5 of 52 weeks in a year of full time work. (40hrs/week)
---
Hop on pc let's find out
---
Looks ridiculous.  Maybe attackers can’t destroy it, though? Or once they step in it they can’t remove it?
---
Every map is favored one way or the other, this game is a million miles away from being balanced. Fun and variety &gt; pretending to be in pro league.
---
I mean Ash has always been in the game what are you taking about 
---
The op that is most similar to Sledge is Buck not Zofia 
---
you too brother! 
---
But did he/she vaulted or not?
---
I’m plat at level 40
---

---
complaining and saying cry babies what a better combination
---
Made me cry. Some things are just too perfect.
---
Just keep playing and try to find your own way of playing;don't listen to what everybody else says and this game has a very steep learning curve
---
I play on console, but I run a 2.7kd ranked and solo queued to diamond multiple seasons. Even with a controller, I'd stomp you, and I obviously have a far better understanding of the game than you. So get lost scrub.
---
What. And kaid doesnt? Or in response to.mute?
---
Sledge is far from bad. Imo, he’s the most rounded op. Main gun, good. Secondary, good. Gadget, good. Secondary gadget, good. Nothing really bad about his.
---
Zofia, if not for her concussion grenades, only had one thing over sledge, and that’s her main gun. Her main rifle is amazing imo. One of the reasons I pick her. However, without her concussions, I’d pick someone else over her. Sledge is just somewhat obsolete because there’s other choices that could help the team instead more.
---
There are a lot of balanced maps though. Border, Theme park, Clubhouse, Coastline; basically all the OG ranked maps.
---
Looks so much better and slow paced...
---
It was a lot more tactical than the thing we have today...
---
4:3 ratio, gives a stretched out feeling that can help when aiming. Personal preference really 
---
Than. Sorry.
---
Actually I think they have at some point, well at least for Mute. It use to say he was born in 1991 same year I was born so that would make him 27 and it currently says he's 25 so does that mean they left it the way it was in the beginning?
---
Diamond on console is like gold 3 on PC 
---
Happy new year
---
Mr.ubi i don't feel so good
---
I got 8...and ive played for a whole 4 days...
---
They really shouldn't allow people to use M&amp;K on console. 
---
r/Shush!
---
&gt;would improve his pick rate
---
Demographic: Mostly 11 year olds are playing castle
---
Me: hmmmmmmm
---
Yes, but people do a lot of stuff in pro league. Extremely situational stuff, to counter act very specific plays. That doesn't mean much for sledge as a general character especially when you can use buck/zofia or others to do the same thing.
---
Airsoft no doubt its got an apparent third pin for the sear in a select fire trigger group and real semi automatic guns aren't legally allowed to have even a placeholder for the third pin unless it is a registered machine gun. Nobody's going to paint up a real registered machine gun.
---
Pdp loser leaps to his defence *shockedPikachu.jpg*
---
Ash is fine as is. she has a high pickrate but the only thing she’s good for is fragging. Ubisoft said they don’t want to change her and she shouldn’t be changed because she’s no particularly strong 
---
That’s a meme
---
Speed and Weapon differences for that. Sledge is the same speed, and his weapons aren't particularly better.
---
In a really old version of siege, barbed wire did damage to an attackers. This was never removed from t-hunt
---
...okay?
---
I like how it looks got a fucking problem?
---
No u.
---
Vertical gameplay is essential in the higher levels and is seen in nearly all proleague matches. Sledge is one of my most played operators and the number of times I've killed someone from above far exceeds the amount of times I've died. Not to mentioned, simply opening the floor above someone can force them to move. This seriously sounds like either you aren't very good at this game or you are very new. 
---
I jsut got the game on pc and it gives me the "graphics card not supported error" It's a brand new laptop. Driver is updated not sure what to do. I lowered the graphics to low but have been playing smoothly. 
---
I must be the only one that likes the new Hereford base
---
You realize that Uni wants to support this game for ten years and they plan to have 100 ops by the end of the ten years;of course some are going to by similar

Sledge is like buck. Pick him on certain sites, and it could be an easy win. Sure anyone decent can kill you when you’re sledging the floor, but it’s also easy to kill them too. 
---
When pushing sites when I’m queueing with a friend. I open he floor in certain spots, never smacking one hole and starring down it. Smack one, move to the next, and so on. Then after, go peaking down them, throwing names into common spots people sit, to avoid the vertical play. Chalet is a perfect example of this. Most people will sit somewhere in trashy, or in dining.  Even if you don’t get a pick, the added pressure of those holes up top, does more than a good job on how aggressive the defenders play.
---
F
---
terrible map a lot of people dislike it because of how it is.
---
Really? I didn’t and got one on ps4
---
Lmao, you haven't seen many good console players obviously. And this is about game knowledge and how well you can play the game within the same parameters as other players, not twitch firing with a mouse. Controllers are massively harder to use and learn and the fact that you can't just 180 people in an instant means you need better position and tactical play. What are your stats? Lets hear it, you wana talk smack and act good. Bring up your numbers or shut up.
---
The point still stands that it’s not about number of walls it’s about surface area, bc it also means that mute is better
---
*dabs in ash*
---
you mean last season? I can't wait to see the Australian camos.
---
Never got this issue until Wind Bastion so I think its the game not NAT type issues. Have seen other reports of this too. 
---
Isn‘t her fragging potential is what makes her strong and unfun to play against? 
---
so you don’t have Zofia unlocked but you’re a 2.7kd diamond? yeah right 
---
It’s supposed to make some noise too
---
Was beaten to death
---
this post is doing better then i thought it would so far any way
---
Man, this guy already forgot about the division
---
I mean it’s still other reasons to pick sledge good guns, nades, and to counter evil eyes
---
Restart r6
---
I feel like they could make it where as soon as they join, it would spot the whole team at that moment. That would prevent disconnects and stuff
---
Oh didn’t know that. 
---
No normal most are 1.2-1.0 his is high bc of boosting 
---
This is outbreak tho.
---
And that's why my hype is low. Map reworks will also be as bad as new Hereford. They want to support it for 10 years, but won't get that far if they continue the way they're going. 
---
That’s probably because Creepers aren’t toting around a *fucking lmg*
---
I hear the shooting a lot on café when you're in the kitchen it sounds like someone is upstairs trying to fire a million rounds. 
---
Lmao, and no, favela is shit. Albeit I love them park and apparently not a lot of people like it.
---
is there anything wrong?
---
no because other than her ability to kill she’s not very good. her gadget is very underwhelming and her secondary gadget options aren’t spectacular either. her gun’s DPS is also sub par. 
---
The argument is Zofia is superior to sledge, not similar. Buck is also superior since you can just shotgun people in the face and there's far less switch time when breaking walls to get back to your weapon. You can blow out a wall and immediately shoot with buck, that is an enormous advantage over sledge. What are YOU talking about? Ash has higher speed and a massively superior weapon. No one is arguing she isn't on part with other ops.
---
Yes we can clearly see the tears on his face.
---
Oooohhhh my bad. This is way way cool

If you didn't get the packs, I would assume that you can't get the exclusive cosmetics.
---
This made me laugh and I'm disappointed in myself 
---
I was not here to comment on other games. ,I've played the division and watched the trailers but it's still recognisable from the E3 preview. This game on the other hand the only recognisable part is that it's on the house map. That's it! 
---
quit your whining. if this game is “ass” then uninstall and leave this sub. nobody wants to see you cry like a little baby 
---
As it should be, my friend. 
---
I had my own random teammates do this. I don't know exactly what they did but it involved a lot of shooting at a destructible wall. I couldn't see anything either but my teammates obviously did. We won the game but I felt crappy about it.
---
In my opinion, only two things should even be considered for change.
---
1. 2-2.
---
2. Underbarrel M320.
---
Almost every SF are based on the SAS
---
I know but if you log in right now can you still get the packs
---
As someone who plays on ps4 and now on pc. PS4 is way more toxic. I haven't had a toxic match on pc yet. I'm sure it can happen  on pc but I can't get on console and NOT have a toxic match. Only been on pc for two days and not a toxic match yet so we'll see. 
---
With Kaid you get the Electroclaw logo, i've seen it before
---
I just imagine him garroting the terrorist with a barbed wire. Ouch.
---
community is pretty toxic, play with 4 friends lol
---
You’re truly a blessing my friend. Hope you have a very fulfilling new year. 
---
Didn't buy any of the seasons passes. Each character is 25K. I made the choice not to get her, so what. Just because I'm good at the game doesn't mean I waste money and spend half the game's original cost for 1/10th the original content which btw is the same quality as the rest of the game which is years old now and doesn't even cost the same as a season pass now. It's a bullshit money grab and it's obvious as hell. Do what you want with your money, I'll do what I want with mine.
---
Mind your own fucking business. No one wants to hear you whining about my "whining". The game is broken and that's all there is to it. All of you coming in this post need to get a life 
---
#WHERE’S MY SUPER SUIT?
---
I disagree Ash is fine she has no important utility and just has a good gun plus speed. Ubi should focus on buffing or nerfing other ops first.
---
you can do what you want with your money but lying about your skill is just sad 
---
If you reset your game and it’s still not there contact support 
---
I’m complaining about the fact that I want to relax and play casual with my friend and I get pair against a diamond squad rushing the obj with a lion, jackal, finka, ash, and a dokkaebi. 
---
She has two breach rounds 
---
Sledge has basically unlimited breaching 
---
I had this SAME EXACT thing happen to me when I came back home today. I'd do the same thing and take a screenshot but I already got to play 2 more hours so it's ruined. R.I.P Sweet sweet reddit karma.
---
Additionally if you're diamond and somehow become copper the next season, there is something seriously wrong there. Side note: You get a charm based on the highest rank you achieve in a season, if you touch platinum for 1 game but drop to silver by end season, you still get your platinum charm.
---
Hmm yes I would like to spawn peek someone and then have walls. 
---
It your account has been connected since the pack release then I believe so.
---
you’re the one who needs to get a life. if the game is so broken and is ass then just quit playing. nobody is begging you to stay. quit crying on reddit. it’s pathetic. you made it public business when you started whining on reddit by the way 
---
Send me a PM. Want to game in the future? Offense bros!
---
*ghost noises*
---
yea i know i probably i go to gold :c
---
I don't know about you, but I don't know if I've ever needed to breach more than 2 walls with sledge in a round. I don't know about you but saying it's unlimited doesn't help your case unless you literally spend every second of the round sledging walls instead of playing. No one uses unlimited sledge. No one uses even like 1/5th of his sledge bar. And people who do usually just get shot while doing it.
---
ah thanks, i was really curious and could not find an answer 
---
Spider man confirmed
---
The game is brutal at first. Fuck it's always brutal. I've got well over 1000 hours and the game is still unforgiving. You just gotta stick at it, keep playing and you will improve quickly. That's all it comes down to. Just try to give callouts of where enemies are as best you can, and try to pick up angles and tactics from teammates and those you die from. Siege is just a game about learning. The more you play the more you learn.
---
Was this on 3ds? Jesus
---
You're the one that needs to get a life because you obviously scroll through Reddit looking for people to start shit with. No one told you to comment on my post, so once again, mind your own business.
---
Yeah -- he was 25 at the time of release (in 2015). They removed the birth years in-game so they could remain a certain age, but you can still find them on their wiki pages.

I heavily disagree buffing other operators, She is one of the most picked operator in the game. And has a playstyle that doesn't attract playing with a team. But your point good stand against certain operators.
---
I get TK a lot for no reason and its not always the person getting killed that did something to blame. Some of my experiences.
---
\-Joined a game late...team killed
---
\-Joined a game late....team killed (I try to vote to kick them....I get kicked out)
---
\-Playing t-hunt (I hop on drone)....guy lowers my health to 60 to get my attention
---
All of this happened within the last week and a half all unprovoked.
---
:(
---
this season i start at silver 2, just tryhard at that rank is easy to spawnkill, outgun, tight angle 
---
It can only be abused if the team is 4 people. It should be a thing. 
---
Don't even bother this guy is literally retarded
---
So this is what the chinese version looks like.
---
In my opinion the buff is the friendly behind her. But nobody wants to be the person behind clash, even though that is what she was designed for. Nobody is complaining how Montagne needs a buff, so why does she when she is the exact same thing but better?
---
What leaks are these?
---
Yeah I know, cause it happens to me a little to much XD
---
I believe if she has a underbarrel, that she will be like Buck to much as a 2 speed. Nice suggestion tho
---
Medrik Anzekial one of my accs on Xbox, check my stats if you want. I don't need to lie about my stats, but people who suck balls shouldn't come in here acting like they know everything. Like you, acting like you know whether or not I'm a good player. You're just some bozo who doesn't know jack.
---
Isn't her whole point to stall people and clog up windows and hallways.
---
Buy a new account  to preserve it so you can still buy stuff. 
---
What’s Lumbago?
---
I would say GOLDIES
---
I rarely run into hackers, but there are A LOT of team killing and griefing cunts around. Even when I'm partied up with my friends, we STILL run into them. If you have a Steam profile or plan on fully converting to PC gaming, get it off Steam. If you don't, you can just get it off Uplay. Correct me if I'm wrong, but both are the same just purchased from different platforms.

No, coastline needs more of a rework
---
Definitely not. It would be awesome, but far too strong.
---
Yes.....yes it should. 
---
Yes. That would be awesome. I play on Xbox 
---
yeah and nobody wants to hear you complain about a game on that game’s subreddit. when things don’t go your way you just cry about it like you’re 10 years old. if you don’t want comments pointing out how ridiculous you’re being then don’t make a stupid post. it’s common sense. and reminder that this game is 18+ and it seems you’re not old or mature enough to play 
---
What are you using to stream? Intel's "streaming solution" is notoriously bad across the board.

I had that idea, but was trying to figure out how that would work without being overpowered
---
Ok but who has nades?

---
i know 
---
I hit plat at like 50 or 60. I just switched from xbox to pc though lol
---
I'm having the same issue, except I can chat.

Hatches 
---
Pray
---
Same. I was diamond on Xbox but then I switched to pc and got plat my first season. 
---
Red stairs will never be safe again
---
That is how it should be theoretically however i think that would be broken
---
Honestly bro I had this problem and it just fixed itself, I've tried everything online and it doesn't work it just randomly came back one day but it might be your headphone drivers and etc who knowwwws
---
666? Harass your teamates so they kill you and get banned.
---
I disagree that her ability to kill is not very good. She has a amazing weapon, Flashbangs and a tiny body. Making her harder to hit and a amazing gun with easy to control recoil firing back at you.
---
*get died*
---
Check your NAT type, check Google on how to do it (it's on your router).
---
Also this has been a thing for a long time. Ubi is just shit
---
Well they can't fucking work Favleas they've said it would be difficult, And theme park is the same I'd say they're never changing either map.
---
Lmao just what Satan wants. I agree.
---
Try watching some YouTube videos on how to improve. You could also watch pro league matches and pick up some of the strata that they use.
---
P.s. a good way to get good at gunfights is by practicing your aim on terrorist hunt.
---
This is so toxic 😂😂
---
you said it yourself, you ca do it from longer range, and you can decide how big you want the hole to be. as you said it is loud however it can be used as a distraction as defenders tend to focus on the new sight line meaning rushing in with someone like a ying is a much more viable option 
---
There is actually a drone hole 15m before on the left side of the street 
---
Just a better view point more or less
---
I'm actually 19 but okay. I'm not to first person to "whine" on here so how about you go fucking bother them instead? Ranked is supposed to have a full lobby from the start and I have a fight to complain. Quit going around being negative for no damn reason. Seriously, get a life you fucking loser. It really doesn't matter because I won the game anyway.
---
As the other guy said, hatches. She has 3 charges, meaning 3 reinforced hatches can be opened whereas thermite can only do 2. Great for objectives such as lockers on bank.
---
Also, technically speaking she can make 3 entry holes in walls, but they're dangerous as you would have to crawl.
---
Hi,
---
I can’t really comment on the hacker issue for I have only seen 1 in playing this game but for the uplay and steam. This game runs through Uplay. So when you buy it in steam you need to link it to your Uplay account to actually play it. There is no separation between Uplay and Steam on PC. Your friends list is also Uplay only.
---
Elaborate 
---
the aesthetic in old siege was so fucking cool
---
• How is the hacker issuse?
---
Not very bad, I have personally nearly not encountered any hackers.
---
• Uplay or Steam?
---
Doesn't matter, whatever you prefer. Uplay and Steam versions runs on the same servers, so the thing with Steam and rivals isn't a problem for you. 
---
By the way, buy the Standard Edition, and NOT the Starter Edition.
---
As in Double U -&gt; W -&gt; Win.
---
They just want the win. But for some reason, Dub is easier to say than Win? idk, kids are weird.
---
shes way better in my opinion because she can get 3 hatches, or she can open a crouch hole and a murder hole on a garage door
---
ok
---
nice answer... needed more memes but not bad
---
I would agree with this, but If you do that and one or both don't get C4'd immediately, you're playing some dumbass people, just saying. I never use strats where people can blow me up through walls/floors, the risk isn't worth it to me. I'd much rather be in a straight shootout with several players. The sound of breaking the ground and shooting/getting shot at from below also tends to cover the noise or activity of flanks. But if it works for you, go for it
---
What if they genuinly DC you idiot?
---
I PUT IT AWAY
---
KD is literally next to useless in this game. A Fragger that gets 3 kills spawn peeking and then dies is as useful as an anchoring doc healing roamers when they get back to spawn.
---
I can have a kd of 0.7 and be high plat.
---
I can have a kd of 1.5 and be copper.
---
The only annoying thing about them leaving the game is cav's Interrogaçãos. Kills are useless.
---
This subreddit has rules. This violates rule 7.
---
Hes not even close to useless. In fact statistics show he is nearly perfectly balanced. Zofia is good but sledge will out do her in some situations 
---
It's caused by the enemy team. So technically not hacking but they are exploiting a bug.

New year new ash mains, great.
---
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
---
And then begun the long losing streak into plat 2.
---
You also don't need to necessarily have to walk through the walls. I personally only use two charges to make an entrance and I save the third for a line of sight through a reinforced wall or a hatch.
---
too bad brady couldn't do that in his 5 biggest games vs someone with the last name of Manning.
---
3 Hatches, Mira windows, can do it safely without exposing oneself. As you can tell I still prefer Thermite, but there are places/situations where Hibana is better.
---
That one is a great spot for basement vault
---
You're the one acting like a child right now.
---
It would be the same as a hatch or a wall blow. No biggie. 
---
then why are you complaining lolllll if you won then get over it. you’re the one who started the negativity kid. coming to this games reddit and saying how “ass”it is is pathetic. you’re pathetic. you’re telling me to get a life and call me a loser when you’re the one who came here to complain for attention. there’s no way you’re 19 because you act like you’re 10. quit your whining. nobody cares

Then I have no clue why it's in ranked... 
---
If anything you're the one starting arguments by making a very opinionated post that might make other people mad, thus starting arguments

More like Diamonds knowing common spots where you can get shot from, angles which hold windows, etc. so you care more about them, compared to some trap

---
From another mute main, nice, and happy years!
---
They have hatches where they want them to be. Being able to open a hole above any site where ever you want would be broken
---
It would make many sights impossible to defend and would throw the balance of every map off. If you could access the sight through any soft floor.
---
I honestly forgot Kanal existed

If someone gets mad because i said your favorite game is ass then they're a little bitch.

The incident with the Montange is client side destruction not wall hacks. On his game the barricade was open but the on yours or your friends it was not.
---
Its an exploit used by the enemy or your team. Can be "fixed" by adjusting your AA.
---
The argument is in the post? You're seriously retarded 
---
Same lol but people have done this to me. They legit join immediately after and are ready for next round 
---
Nah you would be able to jump through. Thermite’s breach is the same size as a hatch. 
---
LSD: The Update 
---
What everyone else has said, plus she’s a 3-speed with a solid primary and full auto secondary
---
Addictions.
---
She can open 3 reinforced hatches, or 2 and a mira/wall. Thermite has 1 less. Most times you bring one or the other, but if you bring both, you can make fewer areas the defenders can hide behind. Because hibana shoots her pellets, meaning they are instantly placed, if the enemy is bandit tricking the wall, you can use a thermite to bait him to one wall, and break another. That requires both thermite and hibana, but having both isn’t bad, hibana’s guns are pretty strong. More importantly, she’s a 3 speed, so she can cover the map faster than thermite. In conclusion, for general use, her and thermite are interchangeable. Most thermite plays don’t need to make 2 big wall holes anyways, usually a hatch and one wall, so hibana isn’t worse there. But if you use her a lot, she’s a very flexible character that has high synergy.
---
You must be joking or extremely new to this game, if you can’t think of a scenario where this isn’t broken then your wrong 
---
I deal with these issues normally it's common 
---
So it's gonna be all the same but different controls if I understand you correctly
---
;)
---
Happy new year from Germany my friend! Even though I'm two hours late...
---
She makes peek holes into objective and halls many hatcges distractions she is an amazing op
---
Great that's relieving !
---
I have  seen maybe two hackers in the past months ive been playing and for me at least team killing is rarely an issue. 
---
You can connect your uplay and steam accounts i believe so whichever one u buy it on doesnt make a difference
---
Yeah... maybe it was possible at some point?
---
I'm level 156 and still in gold.
---
Yeah, I did it last season. A cav came out to try to kill me and we couldn't shoot each other but I managed to knife her. Couldn't get back out from it.
---
The only one being a little bitch is you, you do realize you're taking your anger out on the wrong people, we have nothing to do with the matchmaking issues and tbh, we don't like it either, you're just starting arguments for no reason 
---
This generally happens to me when my internets a bit bad, it fixes itself so no worries
---
Where are the rules, all I see is Dos and Don'ts

Does it have the LED’s ?

It fixes itself, play a few games and should be fine 
---
the blade in the icon is the same blade he has on his hip. people in the arab world during ww1 had a blade like that one and people carry them around today. it was a certain muslim sect iirc in the middle east that carries those blades and diamonds are mined in morocco so maybe the diamond is a hint at that

no u

Nvm there's no leak, the sink is fine. Just a few bullet holes.
---
Oh yeah, I feel that way all the time. One time, I was trying to get this young kid to pick up the defuser and plant it, but he just went for kills and died, costing us the round. When I told him what he did was stupid, he just team killed me and called me sweaty.
---
Well yeah me too with 1.3 k/d
---
Also what do you think about killing terrorists with barbed wire?
---
Thanks, I’ll play a few more 
---
Got the game today!
---
That could be true but I didn't understood why it was shown like that. 
---
You are most definitely a little bitch if you come on this post mad at me because I said this game is ass. If y'all don't like the matchmaking issues either then why not just agree with it and go on with your life
---
Relax bro/sis/dragon, you in the right. 
---
Seriously, who doesn't reinforce garage? Even if it's terrorist hunt, you reinforce it.
---
Is that boris from life of boris on the right?
---
yea my internet is complete ass. so thats prolly the issue thanks.
---
I love letting the game pick for me. It makes it more interesting. If you have a whole team doing it, you have a couple seconds before the round starts to try to come up with a plan/setup. Makes it pretty interesting and different every time. 
---
Tickets?
---
Thank you , this really helped !

---
Okay, still you're taking your anger to the wrong place, we can't do jack shit about the matchmaking, and the game has so much more to offer and it's just one game, suck it up, it you don't want to play, don't play
---
The only time to say "it's just casual" is if someone flips or tries to be a big hoss. I wholeheartedly agree.
---
And don't come here complaining

Wonderfull

Hey, that's pretty good

Im more tired of those who randomly grief, we lost the first round and this dipshit decides "oh why dont i tk the whole team" said asshole does and then says "WhAt ItS JuSt cAsUaL" i hate these kinds of animals

Now, the next and final step... kill the bomber with barbed wire...
---
Lol stop being a bitch on here. You can just uninstall the game. 
---
Oh... interesting
---
Yeah there's a big difference between the two measures, I always leave it open in the background out of laziness while doing other things. My in-game time is about a third of what Steam says.
---
Yea, I haven't had someone say that on Siege but I have in other games and its frustrating when you want to win and they could care less but stay in the match to troll or take up space. I'm more so fed up with TK'ing.

I'm gonna post whatever I want to if it has to do with this game. And when people come on MY post with some bullshit, I'm gonna say whatever I want to them. That's that.

Yeah, my uPlay stats show *far* less 'play time' than steam does, as I believe it actually only counts time in a game while steam counts the time the game is running.  There's quite a significant disparity in a game like R6:S, as you spend time queuing for a game, and time in the game itself between rounds.

I know, but many people leave as soon as they get downed even if there's no Caveira against them.  I don't know if it's still possible, but people used macros to quit in a split second. Pathetic as hell, but they do it and have no consequences.
---
H
---
This doesn't mean she's used a lot at high levels. It means that \*when\* she is used, high-level players are better at getting downs with the traps. 
---
I disagree with all but Possibly Frost, 
---
Castle is a amazing operator for pro league and in higher ranks. As he can deny doorways and fast pushes with the enemy needing to make noise to get through.
---
Fuze is a operator who can deny a lot of area in the right situation. Such as window or above the site.
---
Frost could use a buff to her traps as it instantly kills you if you have less then 50 hp.
---
But I can see where you are coming from.
---
Which is broken by design 
---
I wasn't being an asshole if the post wasn't directed to anyone. You can like a game and say it's ass. The game is actually fun until you run into the many, many problems that the game has. The gameplay can be fun but the game is ass. 
---

You are missing the fucking point, I don’t give a shit about this being free renown. Lion was broken for 9 months, the shield glitch was there for a whole season, ubi cant fix this SIMPLE bug, what the fuck are they doing!? You are right though, it seems they are ALWAYS on vacation.
---
Daaaamn. Whats your rank/kd?
---
Whats your gamer tag?
---
can we stop with this fucking "ash is broken" shit already?
---
To me, first 2/3 hundreds hours are the hardest. You're trying to learn maps, operators, how the weapons works, their feelings, how to use drones, then gadgets effectively etc etc...
---
It takes time, much time. Keep going, your knowledge of the game will come with failure (yet soletimes victories !). Play with friends as much as possible, game os funnier, and doing stratd together is easier.
---
Happy new year :)

How would you get it?

I don't want to get died

My point still stands. If they can't think of any ideas and just fill R6 with trap ops, it is going to get repetitive. But who knows this might be something good
---
Just making an angry post and swearing instead of making a post that actualy gives quality feedback is being an asshole

What do you mean? The packs or what?

Haha yeah we know

This was a thing for the 1 year anniversary of alpha packs, you had a chance to get an epic and a legendary 
---
New pro league strat: A Mira window that doesn’t work.
---
Castle is fine, he just has too many counters.
---
Frost is just a meh operator overall (which to me is okay).
---
Fuze could benefit from a rework rather than a buff. His gun is really the only upside to picking him (in my opinion)
---
My happy and funny moments are when all the ash mains call me a fag for stealing their 3ks. Don't know why because it's just a 3k. Lol
---
Yes with special pack, but at this event you can get it with every pack

Damn, that kid savage af. lol    yeah, people should be using casual to play the game properly just not super tactically or sweaty. But it's not a reason to just make intentionally terrible calls all the time and screw over your team. If your whole team is down with doing something crazy then ya go for it, but otherwise it's just dumb.

Play A LOT of T-Hunt 
---
I been playing the game for a year and I never realized you could choose to just play one game mode in ranked.
---
Update: Ubi not being complete cucks and gave me my mmr back. Not a win amount though, but im not going to complain cuz it coulda been much worse
---
Or you know, you just like the character design, not everything has to be about the "meta" 
---
Nah fam you don’t reinforce garage but reinforce and mira laundry and gym facing garage. 
---
No, unfortunately. I mainly had to figure it out on my own, or slowly add to my knowledge by watching pro league and seeing what they do.
---
Not to mention that many of these places were nerfed when they took away the ability to stand on the shields. Off the top of my head, the only one I can think of is the generator in workshop on House.
---
Nice username

You can refill ammo on hostage

it’s all you had to say and you can’t even say it right

The first step to fixing this is to make it if you hit leave lobbie through the menus then its an auto abandon penalty. There is not a single reason to be able to leave mid ranked match.
---
Disable the option or penalize those who do it.
---
:)
---
Maybe grenades then I think you can refill that
---
Thanks!
---
Since you seem to be very new to Siege I would play the game more and you will begin understand why Hibana is an excellent operator. Watch videos on her and take what they are doing into account. She is instrumental in vertical attacks. 
---
I think I made some valid points on why Ash is a problem for R6.   
---
Can you tell me why you believe ash isn't broken?
---
Best solution is to remove cav
---
Your name is hilarious. Medrik Anzekial is one of mine. I won't give you my main. I get enough spam on there as is from people asking me to carry. Haven't use Medrik in a while, but I did play some ranked on there so feel free to check it.
---
Nice
---
they said they’re releasing it next season. this has been asked hundreds of times 
---
GG
---
I enjoy playing alibi similarly to lesion, place the traps in small high traffic areas where they have no choice but to get exposed or to shoot it out to reveal their location.  If you shallow roam and listen for when they get shot out you should have no problem picking up kills with her.  It depends on play style though for which one of those ops I would recommend. 
---
Outstanding Move
---
True. I'll never forget you, spicysiberian! I will find you in the rainbow6 threads! 
---
How long did you wait to make that joke
---
Mira is very common in higher elos, range IS important sometimes, and she's the best hatch opener, extremely useful on attacking basement Oregon
---
"Ive got 1500 hours and made Diamond 3 times" exactly whomst the fuck cares? After your dickhead title i dont think anyone is valuing your playtime 
---
What am I missing here 
---
He joined late into the pick phase and didn't confirm that he won't kill the enemy team, then he didn't pick recruit and was storming over to the attackers. We did what had to be done....
---
I dont get it to be honest
---
And bad recoil if you dont control it
---
You’re defo a troll 
---
So control it lol
---
Of course its annoying but its part of the game and I'm not asking op floor openings half or hard breaches if that. 
---
necessary precautions 
---
Can leakers only take photos on cameras used in 2006 snuff films?

He just hoping for the best
---
You could literally block all entrances to a room how do you not find that overpowered
---
Were did they said the packs would only last until January 1st? All I saw was that you could only OBTAIN them until Jan 1st. You should be able to keep this pack like every other pack already does.
---
Gj on crediting 
---
Totally agree. As said before, they are running out of ideas for operators. I’m tired of ops who can scan you through walls with the click of a button, or silently blow through a reinforced wall with no counter. All of the maps need a rework to accommodate all of the operators that are out now. For them to want to hit 100 operators, they’re going to have to keep doing map reworks. The game is just literal shxt too. You’d think after 3 years, the same issues wouldn’t occur. They fix one thing with an update, and there’s another issue in the same exact update. Then it takes literally an eternity to roll out another update. They’re quick to drop elite skins though...so that tells you a lot.
---
Haha, thank you but I see no point in getting upset at someone having something come up so long as you're polite about it and inform me. I mean, you went out of your way to tell me and apologize, what do I have to be mad about?
---
seems like it, my response where his statement still seemed vague to everyone.
---
but now it makes sense after a while, play with a hacker and get the same punishment.
---
I’d suggest a plastic one over metal, easier to just rush with.
---
Also maestro has an acog
---
Just put a "disconnected" icon with the "bleed-out timer" in red or yellow (maybe flashing?) when they are downed to avoid confusion.
---
we know. it’s been known for a while 
---
Yes but the problem is we can’t obtain them. If we can’t open them to get the renown then they might go away before. 
---
Frozone is black, and his super power is ice
---
Oh...well
---
Buck is my most played attacker. It's an assault rifle with high damage and high ROF. but the fact you can't but put a vert. grip on it means you can't negate the vertical recoil much.   
---
His gun is definitely controllable, especially since the recoil rework. However it is still one of the highest vertical recoils in game.  
---
And open up kids. I beg you.
---
I don’t want to play anyone from Britain’s jail. 
---
Goodbye
---
fantastic... thx tho
---
You already obtained them. You already have the pack. 
---
They said 100 to 200, that 100 was mentioned specifically and the 200 was mentioned by a dev in a different interview.
---
Yeah but we aren’t taking about the weapons. Or are you talking about the op overall
---
Thanks. If I ever decide to do a rebuild. 
---
Your such an fantastic person (No homo). If you want to talk just hit me up.  but its 03.05 here so imma catch some sleep happy New year (plz dont do New year New me)

But have you gotten a kill on the top of the steps threw the long window from construction on house?

Yay lost me at the title maybe try again without coming off like an asshole when you want someone to do something for you

Shes running at such a high speed the wind pushes her lips away. 4speed buff leak

For me her SMG is a headshot magnet and her shotgun is just so damn good.

I don’t feel she needs a buff.

Ela has 3 speed
---
Naw man it’s just passion for the game. But garage is always a wall you have to reinforce. I completely understand why it gets you irritated. I always try to help in casual but people don’t wanna hear it sometimes.

If you're on PC then that one that has every pass is on sale for like $20. I'd grab that if you have the option.

If you replaced ‘“busy” life’  with ‘time,’ you wouldn’t rub as many people the wrong way... Also, putting quotations around “busy” is especially douchey, since you’re basically assuming none of us are busy and therefore none have better to do than read your disorganized rant. Throw some line breaks in there to separate each of your points and it would read a lot better, just my $0.02.

Well, it's not far from reality.

I'm currently stuck gold 2 but regularly get out against high plats and its making the game extremely frustrating
---
Third pin shouldn't be considered legal even with a binary trigger because it's the ATF that regards just having a third as consitituting a machine gun it's why IWI voluntarily recall the Galil ACE pistols when they had just started selling them in the US because they accidentally forgot to eliminate the third pin in the receivers so they recalled every one of them because they realized the ATF would consider them a machine gun.
---
Nice title
---
My bad, thought you were saying his 5 biggest were all against the mannings. I misread.
---
Side note: He wasn’t 0-3 against Peyton, he was 1-3. Brady won against Peyton for an AFC Championship title in 2004 (and then won the SB the game after).

Well I really know nothing about law. I have logged 2k hours on Siege and it’s a community I’m proud to be a part of. I think that making a spin-off game of it will A. create a huge target audience, B. come with characters that that audience has already fell in love with, and C. already give me all the characters and maps I need. I’m fine with dealing with all the legal problems, and I don’t think Ubisoft will have a problem with this. They’re a much more laid back company when it comes to copyrights compared to companies like Disney or EA. I’m happy to credit them in each and every way. They’re the ones who inspired and allowed me to do this in the first place.

not necessarily, just think it's childish of a professional player to talk shit against people who are straight up just outplaying them. i don't think i've seen any other pro players get mad in a casual/ranked match besides the time Gotcha from EG raged at the renton guy, &amp; the time Fabian rage quit out of a casual match. C9 has potential but to me, EG vs C9 a couple weeks ago seemed similar to Shaquille O'Neal on a kindergarten basketball team.
---
ranked is far from unplayable. teamkilling smurfing and hacking are issues blown way out of proportion on this sub. teamkilling can be avoided easily by playing with friends. smurfing is an issue that can’t and won’t be fixed. hacking does not happen nearly as often as people think. 
---
That would be cool! If you have the design down then developing it for IOS would be pretty simple. I’ve done computer science projects but for IOS it’s pretty much like developing a slide show rather than coding

Ubisoft said they’re delaying the fix one hour for every repost like this asking the same question on the sub. 
---
Probably not, because uh, its not Christmas anymore 
---
it can be. if i remember correctly, Pengu used to be quite the complainer as well.
---
nobody wants to watch your stream. read the sub rules. 
---
Let me tell you something about a special thing called.. Brain.🌈
---
You should use it.
---
Ela was buffed in the form of Vigil. Former Ela mains mostly migrated over there.
---
Besides most players are now able to frag you consistently when the Ela mine goes off as they have all learnt to compensate for it.
---
Lol i picked up 5 for the whole squad! 
---
A rule is a rule. Even though Reddit would be better served as a place to talk about problems, it's just cosplayers and comics that get attention.
---
They removed it since SK no longer has an R6 team, people who bought the skin before get to keep it so its going to be a super rare skin to see from now on.
---
Some small part of me does wish that this isn't what they look like since it kinda feels like their taking the piss out of Australia.
---
Proof?

R/wooooooooooooooooooooooooooossssh

Are we just going to ignore the fact that lion was getting drugs from bandit

Hatches, mira windows, and ranged (like if your on the roof getting a distant wall)

Plus hibana is 3speed and has a (imo) better loadout

Awesome job!  If I did that it would look like somebody scribbling.

Are you playing while updating/downloading siege? If so, that’s why!
---
Probably can't shoot it at all like barbed wire
---
You just don’t understand art. Smh
---
I successfully beat the disease of being a bb main, I now only pull him out of the other team breaks gents
---
In a world where people have less and less friends you're forced to play with friends to enjoy the game. It's BS. 1. My friend never want to play Siege when I want. 2. If I don't have any friend to play with I'm not allowed to enjoy this game? 
---
So you obviously have to pull him out every game cos everyone brings lion doki bb ying blitz EVERY GOD DAMN GAME 
---
This is art. Pure art
---
AUG is low recoil, low damage, low fire rate. Shotgun is high damage but insane recoil. I play on console and cannot control the recoil on the shotgun at all. It may be easier on PC and I think if you land your shots the shotgun has a quicker time to kill. I believe Rogue-9 on YouTube has a video dedicated to this if you're interested in the data, but if you just want a quick answer AUG on console, idk on PC, and you should really try both out for yourself and see which you personally prefer.
---
What map is this?
---
We just like to bring life to the party :/
---
I completely agree that this game has so many things that must be fixed. Operation Health is not how to do it. It was the most stale and boring 6 month meta.
---
I like the shotgun slap a holographic on it 
---
Lost? It's a post about Siege?
---
This is fake. It promises in the year 4 pass preorder 4 new operators. 
---
Kinda funny, but not very realistic.
---
Choked HARD
---
“He is” lmao
---
To me personally, year 3 best season was operation para bellum. Although there were so many hacker at the time, the game was still fun at its core and the new operators was surprisingly balance. 
---
From operation para bellum, meastro and alibi only get nerf once during operation grim sky and it was a slight nerf to meastro hip fire accuracy and alibi recoil which most player did not even notice as the change were so small.
---
Yeah, I guess it is. It shouldn't be though. I was just highlighting that even my post complaining about bug-related posts being removed was removed by the bug-post detecting bot.
---
The peace sign that lion is making really sketches me out but other wise I really like it
---
O
---
its because of the gpu, a 930m is like a much worse 750 ti, plus the vram on it is just regular ddr3 so its pretty slow. 
---
I've literally never even thought of this once. Who cares?
---
Ubisoft fixes game breaking bugs quick. alpha pack bugs are not game breaking. and if you don’t like it then you’re more than welcome to not play until those things are fixed or another game entirely. i’ll say it again. complaining doesn’t make patches come any quicker. 
---
why windowed mode

---
Why wont this load I have a gig connection for gods sake.

lol whatever you say. you’re more than welcome to go play another game. complaining doesn’t solve anything. 
---
Thats not how rainbow works though. The operators are on loan from their respective CTU's. Therefore they keep their insignia and patches. Read the book.
---
Custom game, some kind of bug.
---
Yes

So i can alt tab easier

Oh, can you hear anyone else?

I've been getting this bug along with my friends for about a week now.

That’s the issue with they’re most recent bugs. The alpha pack glitch that happened a couple weeks ago forced me to play another game because there was no point in grinding casual because the alpha packs didn’t work. Plus I didn’t get to see how much renown I got so. What will it come to? I feel like nobody will say anything about ubi’s procrastination with bugs until it breaks the game so bad that we get an operation health 2. That’s what it’s coming to.

What in the fuck.
---
if youre gonna report a bug, then theyd rather have you report it to where youre supposed to report it than report it so everyone can see it. they are specifically browsing r6fix for bugs, while they arent on rainbow6. if you really wanted it fixed post it on the bugfix place
---
These are terrible and haven't been thought out at all.
---
But sadly common
---
They would fit the game very well. They are a general purpose outfit too for the most part. They could use any type of gadget UBI could come up with. Maybe one of them could have some type of investigation tool that could look at the footprints, or fingerprints to determine what type of operators are nearby.

Oh wow I almost forgot Lion and Finka are Y3 ops
---
They really shouldn't even consider taking it away until the Holiday pack is fixed, that is a lot of renown that would allow a lot of people to pick it up.
---
Even if they fix it a few days before it goes away, people should be given a couple weeks to get it as not everyone will instantly know it's been fixed.
---
No there is nothing you can do about it once you casual mmr goes up everything will go back to normal.

I guess so
---
When was the last time you heard “vigil” or “maverick” said in a normal conversation, or on the news in ANY country. 
---
That's like two or three matches away? 
---
Fair points. I can now see why you would get tired of that same old excuse but unfortunately I don't think it's going to change any time soon with the current attitude of the community.   
---
Have you had a look at R6TM and other community cups? I reckon you should give it a go, from my experience the community in those events are a lot less toxic, they communicate and they don't normally freak out if you misplay or screw up since the matches are only played for fun/practice, if you're in a populated region finding games shouldn't be an issue I would imagine.

They didn't do it round two because we called it on them the first round and we destroyed them. After that they kept doing it until we were able to surrender.
---
But can you start the trial and refund it multiple times? (Like, the free trial)
---
That's the joke
---
The biggest problem is the mouse and keyboard exploit
---
It happens occasionally. Forgive/forget with a kick based on team damage dealt and team gadgets destroyed would be better. Plus with the system you are suggesting, people could just walk in front of your shots to get you killed.

Smoke could do this with Toxic Babes, but then they fixed it, now they have to fix it for the prisma.

How many drugs it takes to made this?

Huehueh
---
Thank you I'll look for it.
---
1/10 Clash ain’t bald and Nomad has her fingertips.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Likely because ranked is something of a shit show and has been for a while, for anyone not of the "ranked or nothing" mentality it seems like people either get their rank then get out or simply don't care at all for ranked anymore.
---
We have Fairfight, BattlEye and now Two Factor Authentication but the hackers seem just as prevalent, this isn't helped by them boosting players and regularly going up againsts pros/streamers who signal boost the knowledge of them. This is not to blame the pros/streamers just that it happens naturally from them playing against the hackers so often.
---
You list that Titan's walls are unbreachable "by anyone", but then go on to say Saw could cut through it anyway... Slight break in idea, but I do like the idea of Titan
---
For all wondering, Thunt never gets the same balancing as Multiplayer. The only things balanced the same way are the operators and their loadout. Barbed wire used to deal damage to attackers and this wasn't changed in THunt.
---
Ubi and licencing is a shaky bridge to cross, maybe make it not siege related and/or don't monitize it for that much. 5 to 10 dollars for a fan game seems kinda high...
---
Ps4 - Agree with Bruised and Zombie. Though I mainly play all the SaS ops on attack and defense i'd definitely recommend Lesion just a great gadget and Echo if you really like droning as well as an extra acog. Though Kaid can have some great utility so he'd be my 3rd pick.

She said hi!

Unlike others, I respect you as a fellow 9 yo.

Well my friends, me, my friend Terrariadude and a northerner of whom we met online yesterday did in fact have the very last recruit rush with two randomers. We went in with recruit shield (french) on fortress. V proud if we actually did get the last one, or at least the coolest of all at the end 
---
I won't but out of curiosity how much are you paying? 
---
That's a big if, brother.
---
Apt name.
---
it's a simulation for training
---
I have quite few friends that can't handle using KBM, something in their brain just can't make their hands perform entirely separate tasks despite it coordinating together in front of them.
---
Those people mostly play THunt or just do their best in casual. A few of them are actually really good for utility, despite being trash ar gunfights. Just don't let them roam.
---
was in prep phase by the way too
---
It depends on how much they want for it. I wouldn't be opposed to spending like 15-20$ on the codes but would be reluctant do go any higher.
---
No BloodViper pistol skin? try again
---
im glad r6 is as toxic as ever and remains to be as slow as ever for updated features. like random not autoing recruit for like what 2 yrs for it to be fixed. fkin lul. community and ubisoft retarded as fuck it seems 
---
Probably not, the eu were on still. I’m sure out of the thousands they must’ve done it 
---
Apart from that it’s diffcult to tell?

Prediction that the op’s name is going to be redback (like the spider)
---
Is that legal, my lord?
---
I think the secondary gear is balanced right now, both sides have 5 options Ops could potentially have, I think Shields could be more effective but I'm not going to pretend to know what they need, other than that they should focus mainly on server issues for the time being.
---
It is the exact same on playstation, and that is also why i stopped playing
---
Did it take a long time to get used to it ? Do you just keep practicing in Casual and T-hunt before going ranked ?
---
Airsoft. A few ways to tell, easiest being a trash optic on it.

There are a lot of casual players who just prefer a controller.

You'll see the same thing happen with Overwatch, also.

I get where you're coming from, but if you really want to have people do strategy and call out, play ranked or get yourself a 5s team to play with you.  I'm always trying to win no matter what, but I'm definitely not going to go the extra mile in a casual game when I'm playing against people below my skill level.  It's there for me as a warmup against real people or to practice my aim against real people or set certain conditions on myself.  It's called casual for a reason.
---
?
---
How much are they?
---
None of my party were, I guess he got tunnel vision seeing the other two in the hallway 
---
I don't understand why you don't play ranked if you want people to do strategy.

I have about the same laptop if not a little better graphics card and I run lowest settings and a pretty low resolution and get like 30fps, not worth it just stick to console.

Reinforce penetrating bullets doesn't sound too game-breaking actually.

A random team mate in casual he got the first ace of 2019 he played glaz on the first round and got the ace I accidentally downed him because I somehow panicked and shot him to a DBNO state but I then resettled him because his health was like 3 hp so it’s a good thing

The problem is though, you will. A few seconds could be all it takes for the enemy to know where you are and potentially target you or have an angle on you, essentially putting yourself in a pinch

Hello ShenTchami, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/abin2c/error_30x0001000b_server_connection_error/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It does not matter
---
No
---
Ubisoft has always been slow in dishing out fixes. Just bear with it.
---
It would be something like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtA0JS1lBaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtA0JS1lBaY)

Okay 
---
Lesion or bandit 
---
Lesion has a great gun and has very good traps that provide Intel
---
Bandit has a great gun and is almost always a must pick
---
I thought you got this from “make it real”
---
Yeah but in terms of balancing trade-offs this would be balanced it sight and a chance of being spotted or no sight
---
Yes, and it's mainly heard during cinematics or between rounds. [https://open.spotify.com/album/2gTINDe6o2alMOdH98IQc5](https://open.spotify.com/album/2gTINDe6o2alMOdH98IQc5)

Idk, i know what you mean, one of the hardest in thunt tho X) Havent played that in a while so i think it is gone
---
But where?? The only terrace with window access I can think of us the one towards the back, which has a doorway and potted plants, so surely the ground isn't just tarred and there wouldn't be a ventilation exhaust?
---
It is Article 5. I am not a new player, [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/a7WfzP1.jpg), so stop trying to say that to people as an insult. 
---
I don’t get the problem with hackers picking up the snipers, they already can see thru walls making it almost impossible to win. 
---
Besides that, it stops people from camping.. what if the bullet is not a one shot one kill and the reload takes time. 
---
It is a great idea and I think tweaking will help alot and make it balanced.
---
Isn't that the situations? The gas and all the effects only show on that one situation
---
I just think that it would be better to have a G17 and not a g18, having a powerful sniper rifle AND a full auto secondary would make fornheart extremely deadly at any range. 
---
I don’t know what’d make me shite myself faster

Cav pistol always downs you facing you towards her original shot so you must have gotten downed by Cav
---
Me too. KBM is actually much more comfortable to use compared to controllers for FPSes, RPGs and strategy games.
---
Controllers are better for fighting games like King of Fighters and Street Fighter.
---
Wheels are better for racing game.

Each type of device is best for a particular type of game.

Nothing has ever been fixed in a day. It is usually something that gets abused for several weeks to a couple of months. Then you come to this subreddit and you see post after post after post of people bitching and moaning about it. I would much rather only a few people know about a game breaking bug than an entire community. 
---
And if you toggle wallhacking, that'd make it even easier to shoot the hackers!
---
Oh true! Missed that detail. Thanks for pointing it out.
---
I'm mid gold player mostly solo or duo queue. If you want to get kills and win rounds in solo queue you have to rely only on yourself, and play safely. Dont rush, wait for opponent to make a mistake. Drone and plan your next move. Patience and information are keys to victory. Ofc good aim help a lot but always try to outsmart your enemy. 
---
You are looking at one sentence within one post several comments deep. Trolling alone is not the reason I don't want to see auto-interrogations incorporated. There is a solution that would eliminate the ability for players to avoid being interrogated without adding the collateral damage auto-interrogation brings, which is what I'm advocating Ubisoft do. I'm in no way saying they should keep things status quo, especially because of the potential for trolling.

Idk if I’m alone in thinking this but I wouldn’t want to see 100 operators in practice. There’s no way to make 100 fairly unique operators while balancing them and maps around them. I mean as an example look at how many ops have frag nades. They try to not allow a team to have 10 frag nades (2 per op x 5 ops) but does that mean 3/100 operators will use frag nades? That’s nuts... 40-50 operators could work with there always being a shifting meta and decent map reworks. I do love the game though and if they can do it well it’s a eat my hat scenario
---
I’ve had very little problem versus a blitz for a while since I’ve figured out how to counter them. First of all if it’s an aggressive blitz, run to a nearby corner and hide at the side, when he rushes, Melee him and immediately start spamming your weapon(you’ll most likely be flashed but that doesn’t matter just spray) works 80% of the time for me . If it’s a more defensive one, pretend to run away and maybe had a second later, then turn around quickly and spray at the head area as he’ll most likely ADS and try to kill u as u run away. But tbh most of the time all those brainless blitz rush past where I’m hiding and I get a easy kill 
---
In 2K hours I have seen around 3 laser sights, and even then those weren't exactly "huge advantages". I can't reliably say I have had someone see my laser and actually profit from it, but I can reliably say I have killed a few hundred people with hipfire thanks to a laser.

“ The game has more bugs than working content” have you played fallout 76? Thats a very buggy game, r6 on the other hand is pretty optimized possibly only second to fortnite.

Please don't tell me you posted this to your personal instagram....

Thank you thats something worth trying

You get used to it.

Yesterday I was in a similar situation.

In a casual game it was a 2v5 on Plane and the enemy team ran Blitz, Ying and Ash (forgot the rest).

They all rushed and I aced them, while my teammate made callouts.

If you can get a 240GB SSD for what I assume is $30 bucks USD then either that's one hell of a sale or you're buying something crap. What the fuck is this elitist idea ignorant idea that HDD is for a budget or poor people? Standard PC protocol is SSD for shit you want to load fast and then just slap a big HDD in for storage. SSD is not for budget in anyway, if you're on a budget you're better off just getting a big HDD. SSD's are still not worth it per GB. The dollar cost at least in my own country per GB is atrocious compared to a HDD and from what I've seen that holds pretty true world-wide outside anomalies. 
---
M.2 is eh, it's better no doubt but no pressing need for it. Too many people view dollars = quality which just isn't true. RTX2080TI for example. Yeah it's the most powerful card in the world but you can still run any game comfortably on a fuckin 1060 or just SLI some 980TI's for example. 
---
With four seasons next year and 4 remaining operators of the original ones maybe next year
---
This is the kind of stuff that ruins the game for everyone 
---
40 mins well spent gj!

Tell me not. It’d be the counter we need. Perhaps they could even unban Lion
---
Irish operation except you defuse car bombs in Derry
---
If its behind a car or something
---
It happened to me too but in ranked and they only had 1 player. 
---
Seen tons of this in Ranked, made me quit for a while.
---
Honestly why would a sniper have frags? Smokes would make a lot more sense even without a thermal scope.
---
Special ability: pipe bomb
---
I actually hit him
---
I just wish we had pro league settings. Except keep the amount of rounds the same.
---
Still don't think it would be useful.
---
A bolt action AP rifle as been in my mind for a while. 
---
It’d be cool to get a rifle that can penetrate walls, but to balance it you have to stand still or be prone to fire the rifle and you only get 5-10 rounds. 
---
Making you rely off your pistol rather than your godly rifle to kill Opfor. 
---
Looks like a hotel
---
Usually blitz players will ads when you’re at a distance or in objective and you try to run away if you’re roaming he will probably rush so use my first advice

According to the guy above, macros are against ToS

I'd just be happy to get some Irish rep

Tachanka is really the only obsolete op in the game. The rest all have their certain places.

Hm okay, and yes I am dutch :p.

You get used to the abuse from other players and Ubisoft with time. 
---
Quite recently I got dropped into a match where everyone was trying to kick someone. I had zero clue what was going on and the second the round started I was killed by a teammate. That teammate ended up killing the entire team afterwards. 
---
Another time someone went AFK for part of a match to find their mic so they could scream at us for being so bad. I thought it was a bit ironic that he was dead and we were all still alive.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Echo if you have a squad to communicate with. Lession if you play more solo.

---
Wtf
---
I really hate that people keep mentioning hackers as criticism
---
Video games are not balanced with hackers in mind.
---
Forneart's Rifle should have damage penalty based on the amount walls penetrated (major penalty on reinforced walls) and can penetrate a maximum of two soft walls (1 if the soft walls are a long distance away from each other)
---
Also not a fan of him having an auto-pistol. I think a revolver or something with a low firing rate would be better
---
Cameleon seems interesting, i would increase its weakness to include Thatcher Emp Grenade and i would switch his Nitro Cell for a shield
---
That's if Ubisoft manage to implement something this complex
---
While they aren't playing smart you still shouldn't report them for spawnpeeking and or rushing as they are allowed to play how they want. Reporting should be used if they tk you or say mean stuff in chat or have cheats. It is not however for people being bad at the game, or not playing how you want them to.
---
Honestly no. Most people can tell a gun from the sound of the gunshots, and your teammate should be communicating where he died and who killed him.
---
At least it's better than your teammates pinning enemies on your cameras to get then destroyed...
---
Ah, it's for the best. Ban the cheater then.
---
Same. 
---
Yeah, it’s happened to me before just try tomorrow it should fix
---
I love how nomad is elbowing maverick and kaid in the chest
---
This is really good! Since it says the white masks are using the asylum as a hideout would we get a new situation?
---
Until^thatcher
---
Ok another useless idea: make everyone blindfold when someone gets killed so you have no idea what happens at all.
---
haha gold 
---
Right now the store says they are out of stock,. This mean that I miss the opportunity to buy one? (Valkyrie chibi). Sorry for my english*
---
I'm prettt sure its still there. It was there when Nomad and Kaid came out at least. Because I tried out Nomad there. 
---
It's a new hack that has been around for 2 weeks i guess. If you check his in game chat you'll notice that he wasn't the only one experiencing it.
---
That was a pretty damn cool scene to be fair 
---
Mid-game and cba
---
I was diamond last season, so not trying this season haha
---
Lol nice
---
It's a hack. Countless people are doing this. Even typing it in chat saying "good luck with those textures". It doesn't happen spontaneously. It has to be triggered.
---
I noticed that also haha, can't really get mad at him he just doesn't know any better.
---
I play Casual mainly, but I won't mind getting better at Ranked. My trophy for getting a rank is bugged, so I'm looking for motivation/team to get me on, but I'm not really looking for try hard wins. Just looking for good fun and online relationships where the wins come naturally as a side effect of having fun. 
---
A mistake. A very large mistake. Other than him all operators have a reason to be picked the perfect example is ash vs zophia. Zoe packs more utility but ash has better weapons and is the Incarnation of light speed.
---
Looking to buy the year 4 pass tho.
---
I like it. 
---
it's actually a brilliantly designed sound engine, built around the idea that purely directional sound would be far too easy and effective in a one shot headshot game with so many soft walls. instead sound travels through openings and takes the shortest path from the source of sound, to the person hearing it. there are some other quirks that you will have to learn but the sound engine itself is phenomenal. the problem is it's crazy buggy, esp on new maps, and when new content is added. if your a new player your likely not gonna be able to tell when sound is not right vs when you might've just misinterpreted sound so your likely frustrated what seems to be crap sound but just a sound engine that operates unlike most games. check out some YouTube videos on the sound in seige. 
---
Theatre mode suggests a replay system, like recording your match and rewatching it from anyone's perspective.
---
The sniper guy has some issues, but chameleon seems like a really cool idea (although to me it sounds a tab bit similar to mira?)
---
What graphics card are you using?
---
Is there not an icon in your bottom right tray for your gfx card?
---
okay and it’s a glitch. when the invisibility GLITCH was in the game it wasn’t called a hack. this is something exploited in game. not a hack 
---
It's a hack. *Change your shading and shadow quality and it should be back to normal.* This has been asked multiple times on this sub and good people have experimented and found a solution. 
---
Forneart seems kinda op but I'm into camelions mission impossible gadget.  
---
A GTX 1060 3gb
---
\*G2 wants to know your location*
---
it’s a glitch. it’s something exploited in game that needs patched. not a hack

I kinda wanna expect it’ll start early match like last year, but that’s just an assumption.

&gt;the fuck? i know everyone is saying this, but give me one reason he’s racist. all of the “racist” things he said are easily passed off as jokes (meaning that he doesn’t mean them). the only non-joke time i can think of is when he was playing pubg that one time. and even so, everyone does stupid shit. i can’t stress enough that i do not watch him and i’m not subscribed to him, but it doesn’t take a fan of his to point out your bullshit
---
Hahahaha you didn't just take the bait, you took the lure and the rod as well!

The fact you can't admit to being a fan says a hell of a lot, that and you *still* being mad of course.

Yes it has been happening for the past few years and is really hard to fix because the game is so complicated 
---
From shrouds streams I'd say he only knows a few maps and he even admitted that he doesn't know shit about siege still and that it's the hardest game for him cuz their is way too many good players in his rank lol I'm sure you could find a vod of that or something but yeah honestly knows anymore they haven't played against each other yet

Just play the game like a regular person 
---
one of these days replace it with a real bear trap.
---
You want to try and set up his cameras at choke points near sight or on sight then wait on sight anchoring or playing a shallow room (1 or 2 rooms away from sight). You need to try and not die early as like smoke your utility is mostly lost
---
I guess it just depends on the map
---
Or when a shape is not where it is supposed to be...
---
Okay good, that sounds more manageable or else then that's pretty op
---
I cant think of any site that does not have one spawn where you can approach the building entirely in cover.   
---
Being killed by a peek in spawn sucks, but if you didnt use the tools available to negate the risk, then that is on you.

In other words - If you died from a spawnpeek, play better.

Yeah.. Waiting if i would get response from microwavegaming. Maybe going to ask it on stream.

Indeed and game mode 
---
get off your high horse and just admit that you’re being an asshole. no matter what i say to you you’re gonna keep arguing with this “haha u mad” mindset and it’s stupid. i’m not gonna reply to anything else you respond with because of how stupid it is to argue with someone that can’t think of anything else other than “haha ur pewdiepie fan i bet haha u got angry xD” 
---
Ok thanks I’ve been to aggressive with the cameras and they keep getting destroyed.
---
We also don’t need more snipers
---
I think priest would do better on hostage and shroud would be better at the other two 
---
All those smurfs
---
r/woosh 
---
My new favorite is the leaving before you get interrogated and then joining back. That’s fun.
---
Perhaps these bullets can be stopped by bandit boxes or electroclaws? I'm not sure how it would specifically work but it would at least make Mira more viable in conjunction with one of the two electrifying ops.
---
Ez dub
---
Yeah I have the same thing have no idea how to fix it
---
ha
---
Any Armalites and motorbombs on these ops?
---
I will never understand why be people try to turn R6 into a fucking anime.
---
It should be able to be picked up tho
---
Yeah probably though priest does have way more experience than shroud so it's not a 100% lose for him 
---
Really love what you did! It’s hella cool!
---
4000 new players over an entire year on steam.. Its all smurf accounts.

You don’t need a clip that happens like 3 games out of 400

I got kill with prisma, black eye , and electro claw already 
---
They are like that to have balance between twitch and thatcher otherwise thatcher would be way too powerful 
---
My eyes hurt.
---
Well, if you play on pc, I’ll do whatever mode you want and we can play together, usually it’s people who run in squads that tk.
---
While running Siege, alt tab and access the steam overlay. Click on steam store and see if you are connected. If not, they will ask  you to manually reconnect via the click of a button. After that, it should work. 
---
I think if you added room names to battleplanner they would need to toggle on and off otherwise it could get pretty cluttered. I find them helpful on r6 maps when I'm having trouble remembering a callout for a room.
---
It actually do be like that, as a matter of fact.
---
Where do I can get this
---
Yeet
---
Do people really go “Aww shit I was gonna bring Thatcher but... you know, I need to be ready to shoot Yokai or Alibi holo clones!” though?
---
You’ll just be getting bomb on Bartlett, what you’re looking for is Article 5. 
---
An actually good spawnpeak there is looking under the barricade and popping them. That way you're not exposed like you are here.
---
I'm an asshole, but I don't need to be on a high horse to say that Pewdiepie is a racist cunt and a trash person and I don't need to be on a high horse to say his fan base are toxic, whinging, babies - especially since you've demonstrated it so well. Enjoy not responding buddy. 
---
I wish ubi would make a R6 game like the old ones, I miss being able to actually plan out missions and use stealth instead of the garbage planning phase we have in Siege.

Best Camo in the game 
---
Okay thank you 
---
Asap.
---
Cool ideas! If I had any input it would be for Fornear to only have a few special shots (3-5 maybe?) to prevent people from spamming too much. Also no sniper scope, just normal sights &amp; acog. Potentially also have his bullets be destroyed by jager.
---
There is an option to disable scroll-wheel weapon switch.
---
Ubisoft said they’re delaying the fix 1 hour for every repost like this asking the same question. 
---
The kaid jumpscared me at the end there lmao.
---
I'm not sure what you mean but yes if you bring thatcher you would need to know you shoot them 
---
Yeah lol.
---
Ah yes, the hypocrisy of wanting ubi to fix the game vs saying "I WILL NOT STAND BY AS UBI DOES NOT ADD  TURKISH OPERATORS". Yup. Same thing.
---
Console based off of buttons at the bottom and it’s casual
---
No problem man, when you put his cams down you just want to create as many lines of sight as possible, for example with the master bedroom cam in villa I mentioned earlier the higher up you place it, the more out of the way it is and less likely to be destroyed and in regard to the bathroom jump in you'll be able to light them up and then they make the mistake of jumping out again
---
It's always the thermite.

* Mira doesn't get along with Ash
---
* Kapkan gave Finka the scar on her face and she drinks and flirts with Tachanka. (who is nearly 20 years her senior)
---
* Ying doesn't like Fuze and she and Echo dated for a few years.
---
That's all I can remember off the top of my head.
---
Did you have to name the attacker “Fornication”? Lots of Irish words you could have used that sound good.
---
Very cool but Forneart is a Maverick on steroids.
---
I'm thinking if he only gets a single clip of those bullets, and it's forcibly loaded first... it'd force him to use his secondary until he's ready to wallbang. While still REALLY strong, he'd be difficult to play if the other team has any roamers.
---
Because people love their stupid fanfic OC's.
---
Fornheart + Lion/Jackal sounds like a god damn nightmare and I love it
---
Way too obvious
---
I changed a good bit of controls
---
Hundreds of hours in and I’m still working on mine. Well done sir! This is a particularly badass ace to boot.
---
How do you think defenders would use the Chameleon gadget? 
---
Also, I feel like the only use of the gadget would be to track because map knowledge easily erases the tricky aspect of the projector.

What is the point in stealthily going through the barricade if you’re just gonna shoot the bottom bit anyway?
---
Putain Claire, Ils sont mes enfants aussi!!!
---
Well, I know what operators the enemy team have by the sound of their guns and gadgets. Valk is the easiest of them all, because the sound of her Deagle is so unique, also her pain screams is so cute, hilarious and unique. Twitch pain screams also are recognible. Mira's pocket shotgun too.
---
Thanks, I was not use to his guns recoil but I’ve gotten used to it and it’s awesome! Quick question, what sight should I use. I’m currently using holographic.

I assume there are a lot of people moving over to Siege on PC from console during any given period. I'm sure some of them would use controllers at first. 
---
Though someone on the Xbox One sub tried to say this list means a majority of players on PC use controller lol. 
---
It's just some photoshop...happy new year btw
---
Thatcher punched lion in the face, and dokkaebi is echos side chick, which is why he cant be rung by her
---
ACOG. The recoil will take a bit to get use to but it’s overall better
---
Isnt stollen german for gingerbread? So I guess you could say He "Got that bread"
---
For Forn, I would just give him like 7 high piercing rounds you switch with rb, and make him keep the scope
---
The issue only exists because there is no cap on the speed at which you can crouch. By saying 'remove' or 'delete' it sounds like you're suggesting that crouching as a whole just be taken away. The ability to macro this and cheat the system isn't something ubisoft could just 'delete'.
---
What that might need to happen is a delay on the amount of times you can crouch and lean before it becoming slower to do.

Same thing? Exactly bro. Only one of us here is overreacting and hypocritical. Lets guess which one of us it is:
---
1-) The dude who makes a comment knowing that there will be new ops this year, also knowing that the original post is just a meme, or 
---
2-) The dude who starts making unrelated genocide and political jokes and taking the time to tell someone that their own desire is entitled and theirs is much better, as if Ubi needs a whole year worth of bug fixes.

If you guess correctly, you will get some internet points in the form of one upvote from me, bud.

they are not categorized in dota 2 atleast, even though you can report for 3 different reasons the end result is that a system counts reports and then an employee reviews that match etc. thats how the report system works in dota 2 but reports are limited and and more impactfull there because of it

---
U r too kind sir, many thanks 
---
Blitz is kinda a different story. He shares the same problem as Clash and Blackbeard, is that in order to neutralize his gadget, you need to counter the operator himself. Such operators need a plausible countering strategy that can be used by any operator, while making it just a tad bit easier for those who have gadget-countermeasures. 
---
what’s your point? you have no proof that’s actually him and all you’re doing is witch hunting. it’s against the sub rules. send it to microsoft because none of us care

Yeah go wild with it

And yeah credit would be cool if you don’t mind. But u/Atinobu played a huge part too so don’t forget him

Kk

Me too same bug
---
??? His gun has easy to control recoil. Being 3 armor is his only bad trait same with Mira. If they were 2 speed they'd be busted. 
---
Hmm
---
ez AP percentage
---
Or when you’re spawn peeking and the other team domes like 2 of their teammates
---
Yaaaah yet skrrrtt gang skrrt

That defeats the purpose of having high fire rate. Might as well make it burst only instead of full auto.

Nah it ain’t fuck u homie

I have the same bug and i can’t use in game voice chat because of it :/

I wouldn’t mind seeing this as the screen when you boot up the game instead of what it is now.

1. The attacker would be frustrating as there's no way to fight back, that would be unfair

Provide your specs, temperatures in game. Have you recently updated drivers or the game?

You're right. I recently disabled it about 2 weeks ago on the main build.

if is just copper things why does kixtar made r6tms so no glaz no shields no unbalanced ops so kixstar made a copperr6tms why is this community so bad under ubisoft balls if i say something that is true everyone goes on defend mode the community needs to talk about the unbalanced things not just be shield on defend oh thats fine 10 trapers on defence thats awesome also the streamers like macie jay do not talk about things kaids op shotgun thats good thats why he was getting diamond in 3 days now it took him 2 weeks im not hating on macie jay

Echo was literally the trash bag of the game 3 patches ago before they buffed his SMG and gave him 2 drones. His pick rate rivals that of the IQ of the average fortnite player so honestly I dont think he needs a nerf at all.

No no you don't sound like an asshole at all. I get your point.

You're building up your ascetic and making your room/house pleasing to your eyes.

Genius; I have wanted a bolt action gun in Rainbow for awhile now.
---
Year 1 and 2 is better, change my mind

I highly agree.  I am a silver 3 currently and constantly get paired with new players against diamonds and plays.  The system is wack
---
i dont want to play iq or thatcher 
---
The mission impossible idea is a little crazy but hey. Don't we like crazy?
---
Fuze also has 10 marks on the shield for a 10 man ace.  5 defenders + 4 teammates + 1 hostage.
---
Because they are on a witchhunt against Ubi. And yeah all fanmade OPs are so godly strong.

No don’t actually double shotgun, just make sure to have one shotgun

I restarted my pc reinstalled uplay still the symbol is there :/

w0t the fook

Good luck with that I suppose.
---
actually might not be an macro, the killcams dont show the crouchanimation anymore and having crouch on hold instead of toggle is so insanely fast... you can even still silentdrop with hold-crouch...
---
Whoa whoa whoa
---
They're on to us!
---
Slap a muzzle brake and an ACOG on his ALDA LMG and rake in those kills using the camera to be annoying sometimes and to have a camera in chokepoints. 
---
I also started to get this problem, restarting pc worked lol not sure exactly what causes it
---
I thought your name said hotdogwater :|
---
from art perspective, you nailed it. it looks official enough. i also love the name darkest hour, even its like from the movie. (r6 operation names are marvelous imo, i dont know why but names like para bellum, white noise, grim sky, chimera is such a cool names for their operations)
---
Agree. Being unable to adjust trap deployments mid round without significant risk seriously limits kap and frost. You either have to be lucky or nail your placements with 200iq plays. Meanwhile with Ela, Alibi and Lesion you can create a shifting perimeter of gadgets around you at all times. Even a slight buff would make redeploying mats and edds mid round more viable. 
---
Deploy speed on kapkan would change the entire game 
---
Many people who can't read social cues aren't autistic, we're just socially inept. 
---
Generally, I find that if you're roaming, he's pretty easy to get away from, you just don't challenge anything that sounds like a shield. The issues come with being an anchor on site.
---
He rushes straight on site, to operators that generally don't have C4, Doc/Rook/Echo etc. He'll then push site and flash said anchors and most likely kill them. Now the arguement is use Kapkan, who is probably the most effective counter. But then Blitz pushes with a team, which can arguably make him even harder to kill.
---
Just making him slower, or at the very least reducing the time of being flashed would help so much.
---
I winced

Recruit is too OP

Dude iv been saying for a long time they should a bolt action that has round that can shoot through reinforcements 
---
This is more of a joke than a statement to be honest

Thought it was being fixed Wednesday...
---
The recovery of the shield is too quick, same with how the flash period is too long.

I would assume it's just the scroll wheel

Yeah but the community has lots of decent ideas *sometimes*
---
you're right but droning takes too much time i have to focus on defenders instead of traps when you have teammates is easier but i play solo or duo  twitch was better when she had 14 tasers but the kids where tasing players instead of gadgets now with 5 tasers is not so easy and people were crying when they nerfed twitch but now they still tasing players instead of gadgets, i want to hear your opinion on the game are so many traps in defence also clash ok i saw a leak that the attacker in s1y4 will have a trap kapkan frost is fine but lesion ela clash are not sorry if i wrote something wrong english is not my first language

The T H I C C n e s s protects, that's why they protected it too

---
That sounds great
---
they were on vacation with their family for the holidays. quit complaining. it’ll get fixed. they didn’t have to give you anything. 
---
The thing is that for competitive play, consistency is a priority. The idea of switching the defuse animation came with that in mind, so throwing a curve ball like this in there wouldn't be beneficial to anyone. In fact it would probably bring more issues.
---
I'd rather the ability not be ridiculously one sided in a gun fight.
---
But I was joking, doing this is a fucking bitch move and i think Ubi should fix it by keeping the operator in game soooo
---
You don't understand, that garage door wasn't to keep you out...it was to keep him in.
---
Usually just play Ranked.
---
I expect to be TK'd in Casual, so anytime I do get toxic teammates I'll just leave. 
---
I know at the lower ranks you can't escape it though, so my advice, get to at least Plat and you'll be fairly good. 
---
SAS shotgun OP confirmed 
---
True
---
packs?There are some headgear that is credit only that you can get, or some sick skins.
---
I don't mean exactly like Coast Line, change maps and make them Unique but base the level of space and "Aestheticness" from Coast Line. You kind of get what I'm saying? If not I'll try to explain better lol

Can confirm the initial charge that launches the explosives in the room can kill if you’re standing right over it. Took one to the face once while climbing a wall.

It sounds like your headphones are on the way out. Also, do you use the headphone adapter or do you plug straight into the controller? If you use an adapter, it could instead be that.

When there are hacks out there where they literally teleport you right next to them and instantly headshot you, I don't think reinforcing walls matters at all.

I agree somewhat. But he'd just need some tweaks. No iron sights, a slower scope time than BB, and no frags and limit the g18 to burst and I think he'd be ok in that situation. 
---
and?
---
You’re everywhere. 
---
Big deal...
---
calm down. if you used the search function and looked at the 3000 posts about this you’d see that you’ll get the renown for it. you’d rather just whine and complain though. you’ll get your renown. also why does it matter. if you have all the ops then renown isn’t as important as it is for those without all the ops. quit acting entitled. they didn’t have to give anything 
---
I remember that. Wasn’t China’s restrictions the reason they were removing those?
---
It's pretty cool.

I like the ideas, but I feel the sniper that can pierce reinforced walls will be a wallhacker's vest friend.

In terms of gameplay obviously. I’m not in the “Rainbow 6 is realistic” camp at all; we had alien zombies ffs.

#Duzend
---
I’m on Xbox dude.   
---
The first 10-15 shots are easily controllable once you get a general idea of the pattter.  After that the gun jumps all over.  So you just burst fire another 10-15 shots if necessary.
---
How about they just don’t say it ?

You’re one of those people that drop to copper instead of playing against the same skill level. Just to show off that you beat new/ inexperienced players. That’s sad

I only said that because he said lion is a must pick in pro league. He can’t be a must pick if he’s banned. I’m not complaining that he’s banned.

It looks 4:3 with lower resolution. I may be wrong, but the stretching is explained by 4:3 monitors.

Well Pericote thinks it is, as I’ve talked to them on Instagram about their art being reposted on here, they say as long as theirs credit they don’t mind too much but if there isn’t she doesn’t want it

Speed up their deployment speed and make them see their traps through the walls like Lesion does now. Or go for opposite - keep deployment speed the same or even slower it but make their traps harder to see.
---
I swear to god buck has the sexiest rifle in the game
