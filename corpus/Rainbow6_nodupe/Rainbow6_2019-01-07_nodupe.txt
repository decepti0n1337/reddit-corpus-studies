&gt;complains about "cunt" being a restricted word since it can be used as an insult,a personal attack
---

---
&gt;uses "fag" as insult in complaint
---
Ok.
---
---
---
So I think they're giving the base OP ctus 3 elites then doing a dlc character. They've given all the base op ctus 3 with Blitz and Glaz filling them out. I don't think we'll get Bandit or Smoke for awhile. I think they'll do the dlc ops first. 
---
Wait nah, my bad, Sledge is the heaviest, I just checked.  Cav is the heaviest *female* op.  Sledge is built like a fucking fridge lmao, he's 6'3 and 209 pounds.
---
Rook is just barely heavier than Ela, he's only got 9 pounds on her lmao.
---
So if I turned on Bartlett u and turned off everything else apart from bomb would it count as me completing article 5 and would I get the skin for the aug
---
You never heard of Inferno?
---
No she doesn‚Äôt. 
---
They‚Äôll be on pc in diamond games and they‚Äôre not that common 
---
All the operators are realistic, especially someone who can wall hack- scan footprints to figure out the pinpoint location of someone 
---
Sadly lol. I just really want a Bandit elite to go with my main, Jager

Hi thanks for the Tips I have all Dlc so i don't care üòÇ

and right before the australian operators come out...it's a shame really

Zofia duh üôÑ

More often than not, though, you‚Äôre joining a losing or desperately unbalanced match, so the alpha pack isn‚Äôt so easy.

When climbing, you use 4 limbs

When rappelling, you only use 2

Make sense, right?

It is one hundred percent real , I was in ranked , a cav downed three of my teammates and got removed for team killing as soon as she downed the third I had to go and revive all of them and she couldn‚Äôt join back

Whatever you want to call it, saying ‚Äúbig mad‚Äù over and over again really doesn‚Äôt help your case when I really have no stake in the matter, I don‚Äôt really give a fuck, I‚Äôm just bored on a Sunday night, and I‚Äôve found some troll on reddit to fuck with lmao.

I would recommend finka(Ik her gun recoil is terrible unless you use the lmg which sucks, but it Lazers when using adrenal surge. My other recommendation would be dokkebai if you would prefer single shot

Hiiiiiiiiii

Pulse‚Äôs blindfold skin? Shit I have no clue

Yeah but 22 just feels like a bit too young still. 25 is still really young but idk 
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
yeah but think about it, do you seriously sanic your way up a ladder in real life?
---
the answer is no, because it takes time to move your legs from one step to another, same with arms.
---
Thanks? I play on Xbox one X so not sure how well they are compared to PC 
---
Nah lol you are tilted trying to reverse the roles I'm actually the one trolling you being "big mad" over nothing
---
Personally I use 4 man ace since it is not a technical "ace". (Forgot to put this in the original comment) no problem 
---
You can't even equip it shut up
---
It seems to me that the appropriate penalty is a 15 minute ban from casual matchmaking.  If they‚Äôve genuinely got to leave to do something, they lose nothing at all; if they‚Äôve ragequit, they have time to chill out; if they‚Äôre looking for an easier match, they have a mild punishment for screwing over their team.
---
&gt;not that hard if you play claw
---
Ok so a weird ass hand position that 90% of gamers id wager dont use just happens to always be used by the type of people on these videos
---
I'd say the best thing to do to get better is learn the ops and play often. Ranked is good to play to when you start, it is hard at first but I think it's the best way to get better.
---
loved the video but i wished there where more ops shown you used only 3 ops for the who time maybe switch it up a bit
---
Lol no ranked (especislly below gold) has serious toxicity issues.
---
Are you aiming or using hip fire? It actually makes a huge difference.
---
I really hope we do get some Aus ops and they better be good cause I've been waiting a long time 
---
Of course it's sarine gas.
---
I‚Äôve been playing the game since release. Nice troll.
---
You're very right, but a full team of trusted friends is best.
---
Recruit isn‚Äôt suppose to be viable, Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt want him to have any reason to be picked over an actual operator 
---
Gotta go for the legacy ones though

Electrifying!

I guess so. Even when I first started and sucked ass I didn't really here a lot of this.

For real. I use an Elite controller with 4 paddles. Never tried crouch spamming in a gun fight, but I tried it while holding an angle and it is extremely difficult even with an elite controller. This is 100% mnk.

This is an old pic my guy.

Why don't you define hate speech and tell me how you'd go about prosecuting those who offend you? There's no such thing as hate speech.

500gb nvme drive with about 220 free space /shrug.  some times I load into the game in a second...once in a while (very rare) I have the little hour glass.
---
Yeah wait a minute that doesn‚Äôt sound right
---
Bruh my dumbass read it as I Am for their heads
---
But the thing is, the adapters that people are using trick the game into thinking they are using controllers
---
Custom game
---
Its teak, nice and strong :)
---
In casual, people (myself included) really don‚Äôt try that hard or take it as seriously as ranked. In casual I normally run around with no direction while listening to music. It feels like I‚Äôm playing against silvers.
---
Yes, but if you cheat and you are caught by the anticheat systems, that phone number won't work anymore, for any account. If you are not cheating and you have a secondary account to play against lower ranks (smurfing), you will eventually be accommodated in the spot you deserve. And buying extra accounts to play against "bad players" won't work. At least not for ever. You will eventually ran out of mobile phones/numbers
---
The anti crouch spam in CSGO can be applied to lean spam in Siege too
---
That is truly horrific

That's a gnarly shot

/r/boneappletea

Ahh ok

Unless you can accurately define hate speech, then I don't want to hear it. Hate speech can mean whatever somebody wants it to mean.
---
I call him CyberSmurf it‚Äôs a code name i made for the BC user
---
Didnt fortnite rescind that rule because it was flagging a lot of elite controllers?
---
The decay system is meant for those who like to achieve a high just to leave ranked and show off in casual, you have to keep playing ranked to keep your rank.
---
 Locking the queue is not stupid, it stops the players who Queue with coppers and silver to boost their rank
---
&gt;  
---
 so a diamond and a gold will play plats, but a diamond and 4 coppers will play diamonds. 
---
thats my point. 
---
Well I mean I doubt many people actually get ‚Äúoffended‚Äù but toxic shut fest lobby‚Äôs aren‚Äôt fun 
---
That's just a visual bug that sometimes happens when you just load into a game, they were on the other team and couldn't actually spectate anyting.
---
&gt; that movement speed buff is no joke. 
---
Except that Finka's ability does not boost the general movement speed. Only the speed for moving through barbed wire is boosted, and by 40%. The general movement speed is not affected at all. Finka's ability is mainly useful for boosting everyone's health, for giving everyone way less recoil when aiming down sights, and for reviving downed teammates.
---
Here's a complete overview of what Finka's ability does. 
---
**Three times per round Finka can activate an Adrenal Surge, with a duration of 10 seconds. Once the Adrenal Surge has ended, the ability goes on cooldown for 20 seconds. The Adrenal Surge grants the following benefits to everyone on the team:**
---
* **A temporary 20 health increase (all temporary health left vanishes when the Adrenal Surge's ability duration is over, however this cannot take the attacker's health below what they had initially)**
---
* **Recoil while Aiming Down Sights is reduced by about 45%.**
---
* **Time to Aim Down Sights is increased by 25%.**
---
* **Reload time for guns and gadgets such as Ash's Breach Launcher is decreased by about 15%.**
---
* **Movement Speed through Barbed Wire is increased by \~40%.**
---
* **The effects of gadgets like Stun Grenades and Ying's Candelas are reduced by 50%.**
---
* **The effects of concussion gadgets like Ela's Grzmot Mines and Zofia's Concussion Grenades are reduced by 70%, as well as overridden if activated after being concussed.** 
---
**Adrenal Surge can also be used on downed allies, reviving them with 5 health, alongside the temporary 20 health boost. The revival process takes the same duration as the revival by Doc's Stim Pistol, which is 2.75 seconds.** 
---
**In the hostage game mode, Adrenal Surge does not affect the hostage.**
---
**Adrenal Surge cannot be used for a self-revive.**  
---
This mans goin full sicko mode now
---
What software?
---
Then you need to play a different game if it's something that gets under your skin. Nobody cares about your personal experience.
---
Someone got there name banned 
---
......yup.
---
Idk why people were insulting the drawings they weren‚Äôt bad. People took the fact that he was begging for upvotes and we see the same post on the sub too much out on his drawing skills 
---
Not sure if they reverted it but a little while ago they changed it so that you do. The first offense is 30 minutes.
---
Mute looks a bit low def in comparison, otherwise great!
---
Am i the only one who hasn‚Äôt noticed?
---
Yeah from something like 2 and a half months ago
---
Nah, I don‚Äôt give a fuck and it‚Äôs hard to upset me with words but people shit talking in the mic and keyboard warrior-ing isn‚Äôt fun because there‚Äôs negativity in your team so no teamwork. 
---
Why aren‚Äôt none of them consumers of alcohol like all Irish men 
---
Aim for their leader!

i‚Äôm not sure because i play playstation but when i use kbm it puts me in kbm lobbies

---
Jayzis. Shannon born in 1963 and 198cm ? Wtf
---
It's still just as relevant 
---
How do you go from Gold 2 to Copper? Bro you are your own downfall not some booster from one game
---
Whats wrong with your crouch?
---
Leave the match and find a new team.
---
There's tons and tons of false info in this post. Please base your opinion on true info. Finka's ability does not give a movement speed boost. Only the speed of movement through barbed wire is boosted, and by about 40%.
---
Here's a complete overview of what Finka's ability does, as there still appears to be a lot of confusion about that.
---
* **The effects of concussion gadgets like Ela's Grzmot Mines and Zofia's Concussion Grenades are reduced by 70%, as well as overridden if activated after being concussed.**
---
**Adrenal Surge can also be used on downed allies, reviving them with 5 health, alongside the temporary 20 health boost. The revival process takes the same duration as the revival by Doc's Stim Pistol, which is 2.75  seconds.**
---
**Adrenal Surge cannot be used for a self-revive.**
---
pretty neat 
---
right but in those cases you aren‚Äôt able to lean without aiming or do other things exclusive to pc gaming, so if you did it legitimately you‚Äôd get those benefits which would be nice for people who can‚Äôt afford a whole rig but can afford a keyboard and a mouse
---
Ok, MnK user.
---
Speech that negatively targets someone on the basis of religion, race, disability, etc.
---
You can insult people or whatever, but there‚Äôs a line that separates trash talk from toxic hate for no reason
---
[removed]
---
This is wrong. The toxic gas coming from the Z8 grenades is sulfur, which was revealed by Ghost Recon Wildlands when they dropped their new operator for Ghost War called Toxic, who also uses the Z8 grenades Smoke has.

I'm not a fan of implementing the first suggestion. Castle's specialty is blocking line of sight and forcing attackers to waste resources to get past his barricades, NOT drone denial. Drone denial is Mute's specialty, and I don't want the two to become blurred in terms of functionality. 
---
My thought process is that is toxicity...toxicity should get you banned both in game and on the sub

Like a true blitz main

PC elitism incoming

Hello lukepatrick07, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/adc3mc/rainbow_6_sound_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Maybe just having a high trust factor and ignoring rank gives Overwatch access. I think having it be skewed towards high ranks would be biased toward the Plats and Diamonds, who can be just as toxic as Coppers and Bronzes, albeit over different things. 
---
That's a great idea. Kinda like Overwatch? 
---
Gold 2? I'm not ranked this season bud.
---
No, your opinion was not neutral, it was shitty with an air of entitlement about it.
---
And thats what you are, sir. Entitled. You belive because your shit at a game and cant counter someone with a shield by using teamwork.
---
Youd much prefer to have siege turned into cod 2.0 and take on the world on your own.. well, lesson for you sonny jim, it dont work that way
---
People drank so his team could've been plat He is already plat 2
---
notice me, twitch senpai
---
I know communication is key but at least on xbox you can turn off other players voice audio, sorry it‚Äôs been so toxic for you
---
Nope. You can have as many 2FA codes running as you want on the same phone. 
---
It's been average after the deployment of the lastest season. Although I had to decrease one setting. But it's been average for now. 
---
He was only mucking about, relax.
---
I was so confused for a second and then I read some other comments lol.

He has been diamond every season since Operation health, and finished Operation Chimera with over 500 abandons in NA with 515 and 4 losses.
---
Salutations, my fair colleagues and may I bid thee welcome to this noble and rare occurrence- ensnared by modern capture equipment- in which we overview and meditate the assassination of a spawn assassinator. Utilizing DETAILS themself, exploitation of the pixel loophole, and bloody black magic!

My question is can rainbow 6 (or Ubi in general) do this without getting in some legal trouble?

What are going to do about Thought Police? Prosecute them in a court of law because they hurt your feelings? If you can't stand the heat perhaps remove yourself from the kitchen ‚úå
---
Dude, shut the fuck up.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not even the crouch spam/lean spam that bothers me but as you mention the perfect aim during it part. Like I get moving randomly makes you harder to hit, but show me one person who can wiggle their body like an idiot and also keep their rifle level and aimed straight and maybe then I‚Äôll accept it. 
---
It should be people with both, as low ranks are likely to call prefires and wallbangs hacks. You can be high ranked and still have a low trust factor and not get overwatch
---
If you send to UBI they should be able to ban the guy mouse and keyboard on console is a bannable offense. 
---
*Pistol Time* 
---
Reported for toxic behavior.
---
Who needs to be removed from the game
---
I just made a post on how to fix ranked, and **regional** lock is one of my suggestions 
---
You can have as many 2FA instances on your phone as you want. There is difference. It doesn't prevent cheating or multiple accounts. It prevents people to login into your account without access to your phone. It's a security measure only. 
---
Hmm I also started playing during holiday season and I didn't have the experience OP did. Actually I had mostly the opposite experience, I ran into maybe a handful of people who killed their teammates, I got kicked from like 2 games by a group for no reason. But I didn't run into many people who were just straight flaming people in chat. Maybe once.
---
u rite

Definitely going to be making a second one soon to make it bigger and make some changes. Any ideas/suggestions to make it better would be appreciated 
---
Do bandit traps not? I was under the impression if you shot an airjab at a electrified wall panel, it would be destroyed. 
---
I will make it legal
---
thats planned and boring
---
Forgot about them. Sorry ubi go back to your business 
---
Alright bro, here we go:
---
First off, I‚Äôm plat 1 and I‚Äôve been diamond, so you can trust my advice. I hope I can convince you to joining this incredible community for this incredible and unique game. 
---
Next, YOURE GOING TO DIE. A LOT. Don‚Äôt get mad, because it happened to all of us. R6 is unlike any game, and has a VIOLENT learning curve. Instead of getting upset, learn how you died, and try to avoid that next time. 
---
Got sniped from a window right off the bat? Start checking windows when you spawn. Found a sneaky spot you got shot from? Try it out next round. 
---
Everything in this game is about learning.
---
More literal advice: start with situations. You don‚Äôt have to ace them, but complete every single one. Watch all the videos at the beginning, it‚Äôs very useful. 
---
Then, play a few games with every operator you have. Try to find one that fits your style. A big mistake is thinking ‚Äúin other games, I like playing ___, so I‚Äôll be ___.‚Äù It may sound like a good idea, but it usually won‚Äôt work. Try to find the one that YOU LIKE. 
---
I came from CSGO thinking ‚ÄúI was an AWPer there, so I should be a sniping operator,‚Äù and I forced myself to play Glaz for MONTHS, but I sucked with him. It turns out, in R6, I like to play aggressively and fast, so I‚Äôm a Buck main.
---
Now, you have an operator you enjoy, you‚Äôre learning how to aim, move, react, etc, but you‚Äôre still dying. THATS NORMAL. Now, the best things you can do to improve are these two things:
---
A. Play the game: just play it. Don‚Äôt give up, put in the time. That‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll develop the two most important skills in this game: map knowledge (knowing your way around the maps and all the call outs), and game sense (knowing where players might be, what to look for, where to move and hide). 
---
B. Watching people better than you: I recommend watching Coconut Brah to find little tips for each operator, and watching pro league just to find strategies and maneuvers that will help. 
---
Watching people like BikiniBodhi or AnthonyPit1 won‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm not against them because I genuinely love them, but if you want to improve, don‚Äôt watch the comedic ones. However, watching them is still a good idea because it will help you get into the community more, and bond with players. 
---
Finally: moving forward. The final thing you need to do as you keep playing is choose the perfect operators to unlock, and what order to unlock them in. Be careful: you have limited renown and every decision makes or breaks your future. 
---
Here‚Äôs a genius little hint to help you decide: bitch, it DOESN‚ÄôT  M A T T E R. Pick a random operator, because it doesn‚Äôt matter the order you get them in. Just make sure you switch between unlocking offense and defense to get some variety. Other then that, close your eyes and throw your mouse across the room. Pick it up, and press M1. That‚Äôs the op you‚Äôre buying next. 
---
That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs Siege. Have fun, and don‚Äôt give up. Good luck dude,
---
Game on,
---
Fury.FSHG
---
Yep used to r6db the other team in each game and 90% of the time you‚Äôd find someone copper who had been gold or above in the same season
---
What scope is that
---
No some are left open like that one and even if you only shoot the top off there is none (and just a joke)
---
haha sounds like standard voice chat
---
I stopped GO4s after realising that there are teams that purposely go on an account that's gold ranked, I think it's an easy win and I get stomped on by a bunch of MNK losers. I appealed but esl were like sorry inconclusive evidence even though his sens was off the roof.it is common place but I don't think anyone is bothered appealing which is weird because esl premiership for xbox had everyone use controllers so I'm really baffled - lan not allowed but online?  
---
Oh I know I'm kidding too
---
M12 easily
---
Ok that looks better
---
Just be prepared. Learn common spawn peeks/run outs and call out to your team before the round starts to be aware of spawn peeks. If the other players simply have better aim than you then you just have to keep playing to get better.
---
Just anticipate the runout and position drones where you know you could get spawn peaked from.
---
Pretty sure it just favors the defense
---
Yeah you‚Äôre correct 
---
**BANGBANGBANG**
---
SAS!! OPEN UP!!!!
---
Yes XD im not that up to date with this 
---
Alright you guys have fun
---
I‚Äôll just sit here and bleed out

But there is no way goobisoft can counter this. It‚Äôs sad really. 
---
Wait what
---
Epic 
---
I see what you did there...
---
Renton
---
I don‚Äôt see any problems here 
---
I never said that it affects the hostage, and I never said you could self-revive.  I said you could revive, like, revive other teammates
---
Wait, really?
---
So this would go well with a Maverick, Lion, and Fuze type combo? Especially maverick with reinforced walls. Does Mute, Bandit and Kaid counter it?
---
Shield wall my clansmen
---
I‚Äôm not really saying that they outgunned me, what I‚Äôm saying is that I had literally just loaded in after the prep phase, they were already out the door shooting. There was nothing I could do with three people shooting at me and my teammates with no cover
---
I‚Äôve always called this map ‚ÄúK-Anal‚Äù. I also call Hereford, ‚ÄúHere-for-D‚Äù.

Maybe msg Ubisoft

Oh. Is it the ‚Äúbrand new gaming chair‚Äù op?

It's considered good?

That 'gay player' and xQc had a friendly rivalry. xQc said himself that after that had occurred he messaged him and he didn't think anything of it. The community (specifically /r/Overwatch) blew it way out of proportion before xQc could clear it up and he accepted the consequences.
---
Spawn peeking isn‚Äôt sweaty 
---
Yeah all three would counter it, I thought a potential buff would be that it could scan defenders gadgets, what do you think about that?
---
There is no real reason for you to comment on this thread besides flexing your rank (which hasn't even been proven, the Ying main polluted is still waiting for you to reply).  If you feel the need to look down on people and feel superior to them over a video game, then it might be time to take a break from this game for a while.

Use the one time codes you get if you can‚Äôt use 2fa

Uhhh ok weird metaphor but sure

i would if i could... i can't login to create a ticket.

You should have received 6 bypass codes when you got Authenticator (and you should have wrote them down) one of these code will get you in.

Damn, and I thought Sledge was tall lol.  6‚Äô4 is really tall lol
---
That mousepad is pretty small, dude. Otherwise a good looking setup
---
Well I guess but it would be a hell of a lot easier to get elite skins or get new ops instead of having to grind for days to get 25k renown just for one op
---
Also, stop blaming ubi for this, they didn't design the consoles, and mouse and keyboard inputs are due the the console and the software can't do that much about it.
---
It‚Äôll be a total shit show

can't  use the codes, doesn't even give the option to use 2FA or anything, as soon as i put my password in and click enter it tells me i'm suspended

I have been playing since release.  I'm talking about the noobs I'm trying to help learn the game but can't since usually they can't make out of spawn or get rushed by Blitz, Monty, Lion and Dokka the first 30sec. 
---
We once faced a full diamond squad in casual. You rarely even see that in Ranked. lmao
---
They do.
---
This. So much this. I can't upvote it as much as i would like. Balancing around the highest level of play is the most healthiest thing for the game.
---
Let‚Äôs try to keep this game somewhat realistic 
---
Fortnite as a game addressed this very early on, if you attach a keyboard and mouse to your iPhone you‚Äôll get put into PC servers....
---
first thing i would do is buy glacier
---
I don't think you guys are understanding... it's not even letting me get to that point this is all it says after i enter my password: [https://i.imgur.com/h0MZAZS.png](https://i.imgur.com/h0MZAZS.png) I even followed the directions and reset my password, doesn't do anything. still the same message.
---
I've never posted a round like this but there is a fine line between intentional Smurfs and people who have a bad season a lose a lot of ranks. For example, and I forgot to turn on OBS for this anyways but I had a 1v4 I was really proud of for various reasons within it but I probably wouldnta gotten it had I not happened to derank twice before that from bad games. Definitely not a Smurf but where is the line?
---
What did you just say
---
I know people will comment on here about "muh exclusivity" but I could honestly care less. I have extremely old skins from year one and imo they were some of the best. Black ice was implemented just fine, even though it was only for vanilla and 2 doc ops 
---
Guys...maybe he meant he used to call someone to use their eyes instead. Gotchu homie. 
---
Walter
---
thanks bro. yeah he used to hit you up askin for extra eyes
---
How about the op gets three speakers, one plays footsteps, one plays a nitro cell sound, and the last one plays gunshots, he/she sets them up in the prep phase and can control when he/she wants the speakers to go off.
---
But the thing is most mnk adapters for consoles translate the movements into controller inputs so that it tricks the game into thinking you‚Äôre using a controller
---
Consoles can connect to pc servers? Honestly did not know
---
Fortnite does this if it detects a mouse and keyboard. 
---
That doesn't work anymore, uplay removed the audio options menu.
---
No that would just be annoying
---
eh why stop there. Instead of just flashing his opponents he launches flak at them. 
---
But the whole point of elite skins is for the devs/ubisoft to earn money, thats one of the few things in the game thats locked behind a paywall/credit only. 
---
While its a bit hard for brand new players to get all the ops without getting a bundle, you can easily grind 50k per season if you play like an hour a day + challenges. 
---
Could you do one for mute?
---
it be like that. 
---
Probably something that deserved to have a -999 trust factor.
---
Mmm . . . Seems like a cheap way to just to get kills or do damage without putting yourself at risk. I'd rather have evironmental based gadgets, so what if that drones intended use would instead be to make large breaching holes instead with its explosion. That could be a possibility 
---
"But I only used an aimbot once!" - Guy who's been permanently VAC banned

Good riddance
---
Holding angles is more crucial, make sure your specs match your settings to get decent FPS and game performance, map knowledge helps, just focus on aim 
---
I got kicked for not choosing recruit with shotgun
---
I think you should use a controller to play on PC if u are good on Xbox.
---
thanks for your reply ! will look into this guys ! still would like to know if quick peaking is still a thing or not :D i enjoy learing this stuff, and in most game stuff like quick peaking is better to learn as a beginner then after you have mussle memory for something else :D
---
You'll be fine bro. Just make sure you get the key binds that are more comfortable for you. And also your mouse sensitivity. You'll be fine. 
---
At level 150 he should have decent map knowledge
---
Oh well then that's different 
---
Yeah but that is clearly not the case here. His fucking name is bullying coppers. He has 29 abandons.
---
Hi fellow ying main! 
---
No don‚Äôt use a controller, he‚Äôll get smashed by the accuracy of the mouse players
---
You wish. They just went back on the old maps but I guarantee you future content will be cut for everybody. You will just have nothing to compare it to.
---
Sounds an awful lot like my sex life. Anyways, because of how her transition works, I beg to differ. A better way of "nerfing" her gadget would be to lengthen the transition time between gadget and weapon. Not too much. Just enough to give the attackers the edge if they're fast enough.
---
They are new either to the game or fps. Let them play the game at their level. The clip would be funny but the spirit of it ruins it for me
---
Lmao then how pls help ?
---
I have all the maps memorized bro 
---
Activate Windows is my favourite team member.
---
wtf
---
They‚Äôre all good honestly. The weakest is perhaps Capit√£o but even he has his uses and isn‚Äôt bad by any means. Some of the best are Buck, Hibana, Jackal, Zofia, and Maverick. Lion is good too but I‚Äôd stay away from him because he‚Äôs eventually getting a rework and is generally considered to be pure cancer throughout the community 
---

---
I see office and I like right away :) 
---
Dude I‚Äôm a plat player but I have also smurfed. They are above lvl 50 up to 150. They are not all new. They don‚Äôt understand Siege and they don‚Äôt know how to play. They have no game sense or gun skill. They simply play and pray to do something that doesn‚Äôt kill them. 
---
Literally go to options, then video. It‚Äôs right there
---
keybinds + slowly increasing sensitivity 
---
Good just focus on aim then, thats what i did when i moved over, also try and get a squad to play with
---
Peace and tranquility
---
It‚Äôs such bs what happens to him 
---
lol ok
---
Back in chimera (Year 3 Season 1) they gave a free Ash elite set to anyone that played in a certain window of time. And there was a slightly different one in the outbreak packs you paid for (unless you were lucky and get her in the few free ones).
---
Tf is that bandit jeeze
---
5 Caveiras vs 5 Fuzes lol

the real MVP was the Buck 
---
PC is a hell of a lot harder. I used to play on PlayStation then switched to PC and it has a steep learning curve. Your reactions and angles need to be so much quicker. If you want someone to play with, hit me up.

These people can always come up with any half-assed excuse ever for these things, though. "I've just been playing really bad and haven't gotten up that much in rank as normally I would" "I am playing with friends who are lower rank." etc. I have a solo account and it doesn't happen to be in the same rank as my main. People get upset when they look me up and see that I am lower leveled player with the skillset, meaning that I am most likely "smurfing". 
---
Other thing is playing casual. You literally get harassed if you're plat 2 to diamond. "Go back to ranked". It's like we are not allowed to do normal things in casual and have to play stupid. Otherwise you're getting harassed EVEN IN CASUAL. Now those are the things that come to my mind when we start talking about the fact that I am not allowed to play on a level which is not my peak
---
In the end, these things really are quit. hard to solve, because you can't really prove them to be deranking for footage. Anyone can always say that they're just having a good game and so on, which ultimately doesn't lead to anything, because you have nothing that you can do about it.
---
I'm question the fact that you actually won that since you needed to extract the hostage still or did the video just get cut for me?
---
Anyway you do what make you happy mate i left it because of all the bugs i get so I‚Äôll pass until Y4S1 ops come out
---
i see you are a man of culture
---
I don't understand how this is an excuse to ruin their games.
---
As I csgo player coming to siege knowing that I could spam crouch. I abused the fuck of it XD
---
Meh eventually the gaming gods will get em remember we xbox never wanted to crossplay now we do
---
A Hat in Time is a gift from God
---
Thats the more common Finka choice nowadays actually. The gun is insane.
---
How did he ruin his game? Bb had a lot of time to see him and react. He was lukng on the floor next to him. I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs rooks fault that bb was completely unaware of everything. 
---
Rainbow Six.....is a love story
---
No problem. f you have any other question, let me know.
---
Yes 
---
Those are some great ambitions for someone your age. But be real with me here, do you really think you could become a professional player?
---
Like not just become good, become so good you could make money if it I mean.
---
Map rotations and operator balancing are not under Operation Health jurisdiction. We already get 20+ bugfixes every update. And crouch-lean fix can be implemented within one of the seasons.
---
OH was much more than just fixing glitches and bugs. People throw the phrase around thinking otherwise, but it goes much deeper than that.
---
Props for DBL online for recording it  
---
What loadout should I run for fuze?:D
---
I love how this post is genuine, but when OP checks this post in half a year, it starts to change it's meaning and becomes quite comedic, since the gun isn't in the best of the best from the selection. Either way, congratz. :P
---
as long as you're not potted, its fine.
---
Sure, in casual I presume? But I know for myself I have seen in ranked she downed three ppl at the start of the round and got kicked for team killing 
---
My first alpha pack was a black ice
---
yes, indeed
---
Delete your account they can't find you then

Same thing with XQC some dude said he should just put his stream on a delay and he got super paused and just started blowing into the microphone and saying he fucked his mom.

 I main blitz so I get that shields are op a lot, but they aren't.
---
Shields do have a learning curve to counter and use them, as with blitz, fuze or recruit they have three places you can hit them in their left shoulder, their right shoulder or their legs (when there not crouched) take for instance if any of them showed up far away from you, you should have enough aim to kill them easily. If you see a blitz right next to you that's when you are basically helpless the only thing you can do is hipfire and hope you tag him. Now I don't suggest you use shield on fuze cuz his ak12 is a much better gun.
---
As for montange I don't find him very annoying to play against but if it's a 1v1 and he has defuse you can't beat him montange will normally sit in the site giving away your location to the teammates but once everyone is dead it is pretty easy to get him.
---
Clash is pretty annoying but not to a point where the game becomes unfun.
---
I like the shield operators and don't think they need a rework but clash could be balanced differently
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
It deffenetly need a fix! Because right now it's a cheat pretty much! So easy to spot your enemies! Just not fair! 
---
I'm looking it at R6Fix, haven't seen any Ubi response on it
---
Then he genuenily doesn't understand why Reddit dislikes him.
---
What do you mean? It's a known fact that you get better at any shooter by playing on Xbox.

Also let us be able to turn off maps in ranked.

Shit like this makes me wanna quit r6 but then I end up saying "one last game"

On defence I would definitely recommend using lesion

However if you are a roamer get cav

On attack either get lion or zofia 
---
Same man, add me for some games? Kez.T

when the season ends, which should be about March 5th.
---
they'll let you know when it'll be the last time you can buy them
---
That‚Äôs üíØ % macros

I feel they should add the thing csgo has the more u spam crouch the slower it gets, so we don‚Äôt have BS like this
---
Sure thing, it'll be from Ulldu, probably back end of the week though due to work. 
---
Dang March 5th, I got a lot of time then. Do you know if you can get the seasonal stuff out of alpha packs?
---
Yeah I stopped watching his streams after it became obvious he didn't really care about having fun or helping others, and he always expects to win, but gets pissed off when he doesn't.
---
no idea about alpha packs i wouldn't think so
---
Maverick he's a priority
---
Alright tanks
---
Dang, guess I'll start saving my renown then

When you meant to throw your C4 but you throw a brick instead

This happens too often lol

while also him rushing out haha

Which I would agree with, if he was like sugar, that he was a non-sentient object. He is not. He is a narcissistic cunt who abuses other people, making their nights objectively worse than they would have been otherwise. Sugar is incapable of consciously making immoral choices (ie; abusing others), KG is, therefore he shouldn't have an audience, he ruins the game experience for other players, which is his entire brand. Sugar just ruins the body of the person consuming it.
---
tl;dr, RK is a cunt who abuses others, he shouldn't get a pass just because he broadcasts it and people that watch him contribute to the problem.
---
Last time ubisoft listened to the casual community we got the blitz buff so not thanks
---
I never said the game was perfect and as I stated earlier I think the game is in a shit state and that my only problem with this post is the "take ranked out of beta" when it's not in a "real" beta and I'm pretty sure (could be wrong) ubi said a while back that ranked isn't in actual beta testing but rather they think it isn't perfect (oh boy it's far from it) but when everyone sees beta the Instantly think unfinished and besides even if they remove ranked from beta what will change just from that nothing people will complain about the same shit it's just they can't use "ranked beta reeeee"
---
what are you aiming at man? learn recoil control and stop aiming at their nutsacks mate
---
Check my reply to PickleREKT
---
No it‚Äôs not, and I‚Äôve already called the police

Because the dropshot exploit was adjusted.

Holy shit that pistol was faster than a minigun
---
I at first tryed the tutorial and when I got the hang of the mechanics i started playing casual multiplayer.

Around 3:18 is the line

Ok, happy I have been helpful

I know the shadow stuff, but this glitch is just way too dumb and game breaking

Gotta disagree dumbass

Ohhh fuck off, ive watched 3 grandparents die and my half brother and I didnt treat people like assholes, stop sucking his ass
---
Just watched a rage compilation and wow... this dude needs to grow up. Just because you are hitting the wall above them does not mean you should be getting a headshot. Some of his rages are literally because he just misses or "WHY ARE YOU PEAKING"
---
Alright whatever dude. Sorry for defending someone I like. Don‚Äôt have to tell me to fuck off. 
---
I have a curious question: 
---
How is it possible to stay in Copper ? 
---
I mean if you just play the intro situations you get a good sense of the game. Then playing casual till LVL 20. Even with bad aim and not much mal knowledge should it be possible to rank up. Just with paying attention to your surroundings, using a bit of your brain and learn from mistakes ?! 
---
Ps: it hurts to watch some people playing, so I am totally ok with banning this kind of content, wich is only serve to make fun of others. 
---
Outstanding move
---
I hit copper IV last season, and I swear it was not intentional. I got the most kills in most of the matches, and only abandoned a match two because the game crashed. It was simply my teammates were doing their ‚Äúbest job‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt fight against the enemy all by myself.
---
Can you not read not being rude but the bronze one says it's 1999 and he's apprently he's in bronze two at 1999

How do you manage this

Im not the OP but isnt a "rapid fire button" a hardware solution which you can build into your mouse (DIY or buy a mouse that has it built-in) ? 
---
Ash is fine, her hitbox is nothing special.
---
This. 
---
His shotgun is good for killing but it‚Äôs real use is for wall and floor breeches. 
---
It's true. An ace is when you  kill the whole enemy team. If you think otherwise you are wrong
---
ubi doesn't care the game is broken as fuck, MK players in every match, high pinger, crouch spammer and teamkiller. 
---
Smoke
---
Ela. Play her on stairs or tight 90¬∞ corners
---
Yeah I‚Äôm really bad at matchmaking I‚Äôll need to get some practice on that, any tips on how to beat client side destruction?

Nothing beats ash with an acog with crouch and lean spamming.

Yeah, a never ending circle. Asians -&gt; US -&gt; EU and Iran -&gt; EU -&gt; America... I never went to another Server as I don't know how to and even if, I would have a different rank there, what makes it even more unattractive to me
---
Rook, J√§ger, Bandit, and Smoke. They all have great shotguns, secondaries, and gadgets, especially smoke. Out of all I suggest Smoke, because the M59OA1 hits like a truck, the SMG-11 is terrifying, and his smoke canisters will kill you before you even know they‚Äôre there. 
---
100% agreed those are the good things about csgo
---
This season has been insanely rough on my solo que account. I made it to Plat the last 2 seasons and am fighting to get out of Silver right now. Like I have 15k games that we somehow lose all the time. I‚Äôve been tempted to switch to secure area because at least because it‚Äôs easier to just frag out and go for a win. 
---
Smoke, mute, ela, jager, 
---
Thing is casual should prepare you to rank and having 4 minutes and can't choose your spawn location make the approach way different. casual should follow the same rules as ranked with abandon penalty if the player leaves, rejoin match if he left... people are complaining about joining ongoing match, may be ubi should just prevent people from leaving.
---
Since season 1 people are mistaking casual with call of duty deathmatch toxic 12yo yelling a each other.
---
Casual should be ranked without elo win/loss you can have fun but it shouldn't be a shit show as it is rn
---
At this point solo queue in casual is not even fun you just get kicked or tk for no reasons.
---
Anyway I ain't playing this trash game until they fix crouch spamming and other game breaking stuff you guys should just do the same, and maybe when they'll lose a few players they'll start to fix important points not shitty holiday pack for 25k renonw when renown is useless 
---
It is normal to get a small amount of elo after you played a dozen of matches and dont forget that if you win against higher ranks you will get a lot more elo than if you played against smaller rank players
---
What exactly is great about her? Spear is meh-tier weapon, even LMG is better. Shotgun is good but still some meme tier strat weapon. Ability now does literally nothing, the higher skill cap is (gold 1 and above) more pointless her ability becomes &gt;!teammates die to headshots w/o getting injured, ur recoil can be screwed if u are already used to patterns, boost sound &amp; heartbeat prevents your hearing!&lt;
---
Even nades didn't change anything really, you still want Sledge/Buck for their guns, nades AND breaching abilities.
---
Maybe if Finka gets reworked to become more like Doc for attack, scrapping her global ability, that would be a thing.
---
Maybe, but the people matched against you should be just as bad too. I‚Äôm not judging you or anything, but if you‚Äôre not out of copper the best you would belong at is probably low silver I would guess
---
he said between PS4 and Xbox only....
---
Read before you write
---
This is 1000 MMR less than Copper 3. It be basically impossible to get here without tanking on purpose. You‚Äôd run in to just as many tanking assholes to be gifted enough wins to avoid this.
---
Meanwhile, ks_chan definitely did not like how he died.
---
The copper hell was last season(Grim Sky) and I‚Äôm now high silver, low gold, struggling to win a solo queue
---
Playing Ela on blue stairs on Bank is amazing 
---
Ohh hell yeah. 
---
Yeah this video obviously wants to learn people how to play the game better.. For real though, if  a lot of people would be doing this I can see a lot of new players stop playing because it's not fun for them. This video also shows how this dude ( and others doing this ) can probably get pretty toxic in games which is also not okay against new players. This is hurting them more than it is helping them and thats an issue imo
---
Stuck in Silver because of smurfs, I'm lvl 110 on PS4 and I know that there is a lot of smurfs but for someone who is just getting into ranked and are getting destroyed is demoralising.
---
It just doesn‚Äôt feel as satisfying as killing 5, maybe that‚Äôs just me but for me the only time I feel like I truly aced is when there‚Äôs 5
---
Right now I think the sweet spot is in between ge and g3, I've had the best games on my alt there.
---
Cool, I‚Äôm not launching this game now 
---
I'd say just print the shaft with some divots. Get some blue tack or something similar to add around it. 
---
Because they want to force you to play it like it'd be COD, probably because they're confident of their own reflexes, but reflexes can only help you out only so far in a team based game.
---
It really is the same as when someone is bragging about the kill/death ratio or tells you to shut up because you had 0 kills in the match. It just doesn't compute to them that if someone is playing for the win of the team and picks mostly support role operators of course their K/D ratio gonna be low and/or won't get a single kill, because its not the job of the supporter to score kills. The supporter is the guy who gets others into the position where they can score kills.
---
Recently some guy pissed me off with that kind of brainless mentality so after the first round out of spite, I used Echo and Twitch respectively to get zero kills and still be MVP in the end to prove my point.
---
I bet that guy still fails to understand how that happened, because he thinks K/D is the number that determines how good of a player someone is.
---
Thank you! You're also perfect üòè
---
I believe its from the orginial games, its basically a plumber snake, but with a camera (IIRC, havent played an old R6 game in a while)
---
I once got an ace and felt wicked cool it was a casual and I'm a terrible player I felt like such a badass sorry if this is unrelated but I just wanted to boost my ego 
---
Do you ever get frustrated by someone smurfing down to your level in ranked and completely ruining your experience of the game? That is exactly what this guy is doing.
---

I mean, if this happens in the prep phase, it is "fine". but if this happens in a fire fight and you suddenly stand in front of the enemy unprepared, it sucks. I am glad that in 30 hrs of game time, this only happened 4 or 5 times. 
---
Is that vr chat??  Lol
---
Yeah, but I want them to have another angle to approach, if we take one window and change big one. Not too many drastic changes at one moment

When i try to open the nvidia controll panel via my desktop, it says my monitor isnt connected to a device with a nvidia graphics card in it. Does this mean it isnt plugged in correctly or what?
---
Doesn't even need to be a macro, just change crouch to hold instead of toggle. Terrible thing to do and needs to be fixed but it's not necessarily a macro so not bannable 
---
No unfortunately it‚Äôs a nitro cell
---
Matchmaking isn't a game mechanic you moron. Client side destruction is a valid point, but if you think the game is broken because a tiny bit of wood obstructed your view, you're delusional.
---
But why does it now detect someone flying through the whole map? I know that EAC (EasyAntiCheat) scans your whole PC for software that looks like a hackclient to them but I heard that steam / uplay can't do such things because of legal reasons and many people wouldn't want that. Does battleye only check your gamefiles? Because there's clearly nothing checking during the actual game for any weird stuff such a teleports, invincibility or killing the entire team during the prepphase. 
---
Not to mention especially on their most competitive game mode (bomb) hes hella op
---
that clears it up thanks
---
Um pretty sure it‚Äôs est-ce-que c‚Äôait un C4, idk maybe Canadian French is different?
---
mind  
---
*blown*
---
And that is why I never paid for anything in Siege since I bought the starter pack.
---
The blatant attempt from Ubi to reach into my pockets made sure I won't be paying a dime for playing Siege.
---
On console, I think there was a bug where she could fire her fucking guns before she even pulled them out.
---
I only know french french ):
---
Please tell me where I mentioned game mechanics? Matchmaking is a part of rainbow six siege and currently the matchmaking system is completely ass, moron. 
---
As I said, your monitor has to be directly plugged to your GPU and not to your motherboard. Just switch it and everything would be fine ! 
---
Plus, it isnt even up to Sony, Ubi has to want it.. which they dont
---
"Est-ce" works! And it'd be "est-ce que c'est" but that's tedious haha 
---
Battleeye scans your files for cheats, it doesn‚Äôt detect them in game. One of the best thing about battleeye is that once it detects a hack it remembers it, and will detect the same hacks much easier when other people try to use them.  Siege also uses fairfight which attempts to detect people using hacks in game, this isn‚Äôt nearly as effective though. 
---
Nope. He‚Äôs still correct. There is alot of MnK on PS4. Not sure about Xbox
---
No for real, it was an accident lol
---
Montagne is definitely going places
---
Not very often unless they think it's a sure kill or are trying to catch them by surprise because most of the time it would be countered with them dying they might trade 1-1 though
---
I'll say this; it would be an interesting mechanic, and actually make sense, but it would ultimately have little impact. Most of the time no defender is on their phone when Thatcher's in position to throw a grenade for it to actually have an effect, and honestly knocking one off is not a great idea as it means you've alerted them to your presence nearby. There's certainly times it can help, like dealing with Evil Eyes, but in those times the same effect can be achieved by just EMPing the relevant gadget, and with the added benefit of forcing the Defender off cameras if they want to do any thing about it.

Again, Thatcher doesn't really need the buff, he needs to be made less binary with most of the stuff he interacts with. I'd also take a Thatcher over a Maverick, especially with Kaid entering play and Lesion being a typically picked defender. Kaid can deploy his claws on a portion of reinforcement that Maverick can't damage. He can still create LOS to the claw, but he needs to know where it is in the first place, Thatcher doesn't need to care. And Thatcher's the best choice for clearing out the minefields Lesion can create. 
---
But i only have one hdmi port?
---
Well I think you could argue that siege and its community has changed since year one, it made that huge turnaround. I'll give you the potatoe-ness of console players compared to PC players; but after practicing the controls, fine tuning settings, and having game knowledge, I'm fairly certain the console pro league wouldn't look as potato.
---
Nice work! They'll keep coming and the rush will never get old, lol
---
When you look at something you can interact with and it displays the name of that action and your keybind.
---
Did you read what I wrote? It's not an advantage. By your logic, changing the FOV is also an advantage. 
---
&gt; But not many people know about a thing called ‚Äúcronus‚Äù. Its basically a device that you (I think) plug into your controller or console and if you set it right you have for example zero recoil, so if you meet guy that is shooting with smg-12 like with r4c‚Äôs recoil, its nothing special on console.
---
Aight if you do that I'm sorry but you're automatically a douche.  Ubi should permaban them.
---
It would go beyond not as often. It would literally be never, and despite what we as players think, map variety is good for us and it keeps us from getting bored and disrupts gameplay loops that make us bored of games
---
*i'm hunted down*
---
I mean, you will be matchmade in WEU, which for a large part includes Great Britain, The Netherlands and Germany, all of which are quite capable of communicating in English I suppose. 
---
But you can get matched up with people from the middle east as well. I don't think there is a feature that matches you with people with the same language. 
---
Yeah could be a sale/lower price on Uplay on Steam, that happens. 
---
just make debree despawn, no boards flying around. Just make it vanish as soon as its broken.
---
Honestly, I agree with everything you said.   This game is turning into Call of Duty.

According to my past contact to the support, they will respond in about 1 - 2 days.

PayDay 2 alesso heist =]

YES THATS WHERE I REMEMBERED IT FROM. No wonder I didn't realize it I fucking hate that heist. Funny thing is I have almost 250 hours in payday and I didn't recognize it

Oh god, I forgot Finka...
---
*Valk.exe has stopped working*
---
People do it cus they THINK it gives them an advantage. End of story.
---
No one would willingly make their game look that ugly for no reason other than preference, it doesn't make sense.
---
My point is people will do literally anything if they THINK it gives them an advantage over others, it's ridiculous. 
---
Different game, IMO tactics are still very much the more important factor. But yeah, Siege is more of an arcade shooter than a realistic shooter but that doesn't remove the tactical aspect. 
---
What's the best way to use her launcher? To breach reinforced walls? Not enough people play thermite imo, so I could see how this is a valuable resource. Also as a sledge main I'm always a fan of busting through places that the other team doesn't want me in

Looks like J√§ger lost his mind again...

My group we usually say if you kill the whole team but they aren't 5 its a technical ace, not a true ace.

There is no way for Ubisoft to know. Keyboard emulators on console are spoofing controllers. If Microsoft and Sony see those "keyboards" as controllers, then there is nothing for Ubisoft to block.

Microsoft and Sony will have to push out a controller firmware update, as mandatory, that will be able to flag non-standard devices.

I am a Platinum 2 player for 4 entire seasons now and what helped me the most was just playing 4 to 5 terrorist hunts on normal on the maps i dont know well enough, before going into ranked. I left the maps active in the thunt matchmaking until ich knew where the rooms were. All the other stuff like callouts or spots just came to me while playing it in ranked.
---
I know how it is solo in a game as a beginner, but just mute these guys who think they are the best players in the world (even I was yelled at when I brought my smurf account to lvl 20 although they were "only" golds or low plats)
---
The best way to deal with that is just by finding some nice guys (if possible with similar skill) to play with

A good Blitz on console can get minimum 2-3 kills regardless if the opponents facing blitz are better than pro-leagues or not.

He just waltzes in, flashes, kills, moves on. He's picked every single match and this meta is just getting a bit stale is all.

It's neither bug nor features. It's just a problem with client-side debris. What you see is not the same as others see.
---
It's not rewarding hacking, it's rewarding you for reporting them.  Eventually, all the hackers will be banned, and you can trade your remaining hacker credits for rewards.
---
Naturally
---
The reason it hasn't been fixed is because it's Ubisoft.
---
also just making the wood behave in a earth like manner would also help

TF?
---
As for any machine learning or moderator making a determination of how toxic someone is, first there would be a need for a clearly worded list of things to define what counts as toxic behavior.
---
So definition first, evaluation method after. 
---
My friends and I call that a "Technical Ace" because you technically did kill everyone by yourself but it's not as satisfying as killing all 5. We also call scanning everyone a "Camera Ace" but you don't get the "Camera Ace" unless you have also found hostage, both bombs, or the bio-hazard container on attack. That doesn't apply to defending, of course.
---
Put banning in ranked so i dont have to play against lion bb dok ying and blitz every round
---
This makes me happy

If u want a analog stick u need to find a Logitech g13 that‚Äôs what I use and it‚Äôs insane to help with the transition.

I've been screwing around in custom matches as well trying to learn what rooms connect to what. Thankfully I've met 3 or 4 really cool people I usually play with, I just worked late the other night and nobody was on. Not like the insults bother me, they just don't make me a better player. That's why I appreciate players like yourself that are constructive. My friend and I were playing the second or third day we had the game and met this platinum guy that died early and was telling us where they're likely to breach and where to anchor once they start coming in, and helped us with our rotations. That improved my game so much.
---
I find taking out a blitz to be not as hard as it used to be a few seasons back.

Peeker‚Äôs advantage bud. It‚Äôs the way the computer processes information and writes data in a way where still objects register first, therefore, a peeler will see you before you see him. It isn‚Äôt on purpose but does counter campers.

I think he should have a few turrets, but only have one ammo cylinder so he has to take it as he moves to a second or third turret. This way he's buffed but effectively still has only one turret to use at a time

1) That means you have to make noise with your gun or (2) you re-expose yourself to get killed.  It's easier for it to work the way it should.

Fuck no.

i'd rather see ubi work on an actual playable map compared to favela.

Why not 
---
I would like to see a target practice shooting range, ranked out of beta, lots of quality of life fixes to the menus, server side degree/bodies, and some operator reworks.
---
flair this as as anything besides leak

Everyone would pick Favela just for the memes

The third barbed wire  forced the defensive team's hand to play bandit. As a defensive team, you pretty much had to bring Bandit on certain locations...
---
You: &gt;It was removed because he had a high pick rate what are you talking about? 
---
Your playing on console, it's not gonna happen pc is made with connection to ubisoft, console on the other hand is like a wasteland, just 5 man.
---
I dont mean to sound like a dick at all, but it's time to start saving for a pc if this is the case and you want to take the game a bit more seriously. That's just from personal experience cause I was on the same boat as you. The game isnt very demanding on pc and you dont need a crazy build to run it at good framerates. Just a suggestion becuase its impossible to find consistent, competent, and mature people on console. And the skill ceiling is much lower than PC (no offense). Much love bro 
---
That's the lord stopping you from comitting spawnpeek crimes
---
I kinda like the changes to Hereford because the theming and the overall different weather compared to other maps. Though I‚Äôd like to see both available in either queue for casual/ranked, or as an option in custom games
---
What‚Äôs Jackal doing on the other side?!
---
What possible reason is there to do that? Why do you think it's a good idea? Most of the people who play are godawful at the game.
---
You got burst fire it if anything, but it‚Äôs still serviceable.
---
It is a concept - but 80% it will look like this!
---
Isn‚Äôt that what the end of season survey does?
---
No reason consoles should be treated any differently. If they don't care about their games on consoles, why should i?
---
This has nothing to do with peekers advantage tho. He can see me perfectly on his screen while I cant see anything of him on my screen. As you can see in the clip his shots are not even hitting me on my screen but he headshots me on his screen.
---
It‚Äôs an original artwork. Just because it was created to resemble the meme doesn‚Äôt make it one.
---
Also, could you link your meme that was removed?
---
yep, that‚Äôs probably why so many people leave the second they lose, or even win if they had a shit game and got carried 
---
of course, it's braindead because you don't want to see yourself reflected on it, but whatever, smurf are good and ruining other people  free time is good and no one cares.
---
Next time correct your grammar and how was that one killed , if he was killed by the enemy team it doesn‚Äôt count as an ace for the other guy 
---
It directly removes the tactical aspect actually.
---
Elas shotgun is crazy but both are pretty nice ops when u like low recoil alibi and when impacts are important alibi too 
---
Yeah youre right.
---
Same problem here. I have almost 1900 hours and it's disgusting with the difference of ranked level vs gameplay. From what I've found it seems to be higher gold to low plat players who truly play tactically and where the game isnt who has the higher ping or who's the more lucky person. And there is a lot less of the stupid "rush and cross your fingers they dont have a brick wall for defense".
---
Speaking of Maestro, I almost 1v5 clutched with him before I ran out of LMG ammo and tried to kill with the Bailiff on the LAST GUY
---
I personally like Ela‚Äôs kit more(her mines and her guns) as she also has a powerful semi-auto shotgun. However I‚Äôd say it depends on how confident you are at recoil control. If you‚Äôre not, then go alibi
---
But this is an accurate sight picture of a pistol..
---
I've heard some really good things about that too. That and Rising Storm. 
---
There really not though  Villa sucks because it's just generally awfully despite being 'the most competitive map' and being removed if not first then pretty quickly in pro league 
---
I think it isnt that important but could balnaceing out when having some disadvantages too

No because prophets usually bring messages of deliverance.  Xim users just bring depression

Hello therealdeadpan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/adjjui/xbox_sound_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
When you play against a team who doesn't communicate with each other at all
---
After doing some research on client-side debris I would say that it's not just me that is salty over this issue.  Like I said, if this is supposed to be the holy grail of tactical game-play then the tactics should work and work for both sides.  The fact that I can punch a hole in a barricade that the opponent can see out, but I can't see in is what sounds unfair to me.  I am really trying to enjoy this game, but the little things are starting to add up to the point that I am on the fence about whether I will drop another $40 on this game for season 4.  I'd like to know what this community thinks about some issues and see how UbiSoft is still supporting their release.
---
Bad news the season 4 pass says 8 ops. So they would have to go back on their word on that. not likely to happen. I do agree that OP Health 2.0 should happen.
---
Here is a hour video about it https://youtu.be/ObhK8lUfIlc
---
When I switched from PS4 to PC I was diamond before level 50 (Received many smurfs accusations). It's all about finding your aim. Biggest shock for me was that everyone was able to shoot back whilst on console many people struggle with basic aiming. 
---
Maybe that coule be a buff of the suit and you get -1speed, +1 armor if you use it. ü§î /s
---
Your always adjusting tactics. Getting better so you don't have to use a crutch or bug to even the playing field for your incompetence
---
Why does he look like Jager though?
---
I literally have such low level casual acting teammates every game and it‚Äôs so damn annoying and I lose most games more than I ever have.
---
IMO Alibi, her primary is decent and paired with the shotgun pistol you can create nice rotation holes
---
I've always found Ela's mine to be more of a hindrance than a help as they with effect other defenders, however I have watched defenders shoot the prisma when rushing back to the point
---
Alibi has a fast fire-rate like Ela with a 30 round mag and L85 type recoil, which is easy to control.
---
Ela's recoil, which you seem to know, is completely unpredictable, but I've seen people make it work since the first 10 or so shots are somewhat controllable then the rest is the recoil you probably know and hate. Or just choose the shotgun that people also can make work due to it's weird one shot range and spam-ability, although I can't seem to since I'm not used to them.
---
I'll just assume you know the gadgets and how they work. I find Ela's more useful, and although I have her, I still play Alibi more.
---
Plus, Alibi has a secondary choice of either a revolver or a shotgun pistol.
---
Hope I helped in some way by commenting.
---
Lol I had this happen to me. I accidentally headshotted one of my teammates instead of a camera and then I got a call from a friend and kind of went afk. By the time I got back it was a 1v5 and I had to ace it. It‚Äôs what I call a six kill ace.
---
Me too 
---
How zid you change ze language?
---
That‚Äôs already how it works now, you just clip and report them lmao. Don‚Äôt need a whole credit system.
---
I mean if you can't win normally and have to cheat it sounds like your not very good at the game. Perhaps another one will be more your speed.
---
i can give 70 million for that
---
I am pathetic. My first ever ace was with Jager.
---
I‚Äôve been a siege player since day 1. People have the right to complain when it comes to hackers and big issues in the game being completely ignored. 
---
it has helped me a lot but has only directly got me a kill once. 
---
Yeah, I know. They are pretty cool and they were in the game already so I thought they could be very cool. But it's only an idea.

The ACOG only zooms in by 2.4x I believe, not 4x.

---
It‚Äôs really just a meme that people believe most likely from where there was a pro console league which is naturally going to be different as far as movement and aim goes. But people act like the game is night and day from console to pc like all the maps and strats and shit changed. 
---
you play hostage? mad man
---
Ah.  A credit system would be dope tho.  Give people more incentive to hunt them down, you know?
---
Also I can never get a knife kill because Ubisoft hasn‚Äôt fixed their game.
---
So based on your "feel" you want the direction of the game to do a complete 180, when anyone could see that the "gimmick" part was present since the beginning?
---
Yeah no. You're still complaining that the game is not what it's not.
---
I enjoy ArmA. I enjoy CoD. I enjoyed the original insurgency ( haven't played the new one), but this whole thread feels disingenuous. 
---
When its 5v4 and I kill all 4 I still say ace, fight me, if I killed the entire enemy team by myself it's an ace
---
&gt; There really not though Villa sucks because it's just generally awfully despite being 'the most competitive map'
---
Any actual reasoning?
---
&gt;and being removed if not first then pretty quickly in pro league
---
Where are you getting that from?
---
bandit share pls

Fair I didn't account for c4 throws
---
Ah you're right man let me edit that quickly lol
---
thats why i wont play ranked until i get 5 man team
---
Don't argue, it was just a post about a post haha. It would be cool if they add something like it because I love the concept of gasmask and operators with their faces covered tacti-cool like, that's why I posted it. 
---
I face good 5 stack enemies and have crap solo queue teammates 9/10 games....it‚Äôs so dumb

I'm kind of on edge about that, since I know a 4x would be kinda broken, but I would know my only other choice are irons.

Punch it chewie

Looks like the mole hill came to Terrence after all
---
They give you dirt 5

Uff... he was defending and an other defender killed an attacker. Then he threw his c4 and killed 4 attackers and one mate and it was declared as an ace. Got it now?

Crouch/lean spam in its finest form

I care. A car is not a motorcycle. Why do people on reddit always have to be such asshats about someone correcting them but then still upvote the useless spelling bot. 
---
What does that matter? The simple fix I linked to would have helped you here, also. The issue is that debris just falls straight down with no force applied to it now, when it used to fly back with force when struct so that no boards could get stuck.
---
Ubi fudged it up awhile back and now it's a huge issue.
---
So you chose to endure an entire game of toxicity to make a point? Also, did you inform the musician you were muting him?

Yeah.  The Hacker Credits and the Hardware ban thing was my idea, but yeah, the rest are ones I find around on this sub, but most are scattered, so I wanted to organize everything onto a single post.  Lol

The MOBA thing is kinda what I suggested with the leaving solutions.

I said that if you get downed by Cav, the leave button should be greyed out and unable to be used, but having that like that permanently would be awesome.

Or, how about you let people put whatever charms they want on whatever gun they want, they worked hard for that plat and just because you can't reach it doesnt mean you should bring them down to your level, js 
---
K/D ratio never has, and never will matter in any game ever. It is just a number to make you feel good about yourself. Sure, it shows the relation between how many kills you get and how many deaths you get, but it doesn't accurately determine skill. If you want to determine skill based on a number, look at a player's elo, which is calculated to display their skill level semi-accurately. If a player is in diamond but has a 0.6 K/D, then it shows they have a team that communicates well, and the player most likely plays support characters like Echo. If the team still wins enough to get into diamond with a player that play s support characters, maybe the support player is actually very beneficial to the team.

Play lots of T Hunt mode, good practice for aim and getting your sensitivities where your comfortable and helps you gain map knowledge

Yes, that would be preferable. If they couldn't fit it all into one patch though, they should focus on native bugs and not external hardware abuse.

Yeah, will do from now on. It's a rare chance for debris to stuck inside but better be sure.
---
Same. I‚Äôve had grenades go off in my face and I walk away with 15~ health. Not sure if armor rating/rook plates have something to do with that though.
---
Tried to shoot it from both sides, didn't help.
---
Well guys, you heard it here, from the legend himself, u/longdongbigbong, I'm just a null and void human who mains a useful operator.
---
Please do, I'm finding it hard to enjoy a silent match or team killers every other match :/
---
Ash mains be like
---
Im really looking forward to sandstorm....looks great 
---
I love being on console bc this shit never happens
---
I understand and I agree it's becoming less fun to play. However, tactics are included in realism, but tactics don't have to be realistic. Just look at MOBAs, RTS games, and even some shooters like EFT or CS:GO.
---
I prefer slow, methodical gameplay as well. That's what drew me to Siege in the first place. But you have to understand that just because people are using tactics that you find in CoD or Battlefield doesn't mean it's not tactical. It's just a different set of tactics for a different playstyle. Ubi should add in some fixes if they want their game to retain the tactical shooter feel it used to have. The anit crouch spamming in CS:GO would be an idea. I would also be fine with same for the lean spamming.
---
He is the Lord.
---
After reading the title I was thinking of Insurgency: Sandstorm, then you go on to mention it. I picked it up a few days ago and have been thoroughly enjoying it, the hardcore tactical nature of it really brings me back to Siege on release. 
---
I just don't enjoy Siege anymore, I used to be able to play it for 8+ hours a day, now whenever I hop on I'm lucky if I can play more than 3 games before I just get bored and be like "Oh yeah, this is why I stopped playing". And it's not due to over-playing it either, I've tried taking breaks for extended periods of time.
---
If I want tactical gameplay, I play Insurgency. If I want an arcade shooter, I'll play Black Ops 4 (Am I allowed to mention that here?). Sadly, Siege just doesn't fill the niche it used to for me, which is a shame since the core of the game is still great. Hopefully Y4 will see big improvements. 
---
If people don‚Äôt want hackers they should actively seek them out. We don‚Äôt need a reward system. **not having hackers should be a reward enough**
---
I 100% agree with everything in this post. My biggest hate in Siege is just how big peekers advantage is. My rank is gold 1/plat 3 and I have 1400 hours now and the game is just getting boring. Not because of my playtime but because of the way Ubi is taking it and how it's now played. The amount of times I've gotten killed by somebody peeking before they even appear on my screen is too high. It goes both ways as well. I'll peek people with Ash and stare at them for half a second and they don't shoot me. I used to think they were just bad but I realized I probably haven't even appeared on their screen yet. Once you get to high gold or above the game is just prefire peeking and it's just boring. 
---
yea thats cool and all but have you seen the statue on favela?
---
And what? Crouch spamming would be a problem still.
---
There's no greater relief than eliminating 4 attackers and someone spotting Glaz as the 5th, miles off site. Let him have his fancy scope.
---
"Realistic." Why don't you try doing [this](https://youtu.be/FoLXUs46uWY?t=126) in real life and tell us that it's realistic.
---
did you ever play old hereford? much better vertical play on the new version. 
---
   ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Sure whats your gt? Add me up on my smurf (banned on main) LegoLegend97! Ill play sometime soon! :)
---
Ik, but most people I've played with don't really care, or just don't report.  This would encourage those kinds of people to go after hackers, and we'd effectively have the entire player base doing it, hell, hackers would be reporting other hackers, which is something that isn't currently happening.
---
That's pretty interesting. Im trying to refrain from sending any more messages for fear of getting banned even if it's very unlikely
---
What most people fail to understand is that a P12 is essentially, for the pros who know the ins and outs of every gun, a block of cheese. So yes, you are.
---
I‚Äôve been patient for years now, and it‚Äôs starting to wear off. There are blaring problems that the community has been talking about and they haven‚Äôt even peeped.

prolly pretty simple tbh.

Thats what I was thinking... I‚Äôm play on high sens and that fidgeting with the crosshair isn‚Äôt normal.

I mean...

That‚Äôs you being an idiot in that case. 
---
`laser sights`
---
They did do this with a couple ops , I got valks cams , hibanas launcher , sledge's hammer 
---
From what I've seen from Operation Health 1, I think they need 2 - 3 more Operation Health in order to get this game back on track.
---
Then, sorry for the console players, only update pc (bi)weekly. Use it as test/debug platform.
---
Updates on PC shouldn't cost anything.
---
Nah man it‚Äôs not like people made this same joke when Lion first came out

You get it.

Yeah I know, I'm just talking about having those challenges permanent so new users could get them.

I am not into guns that much and wont even try to get into guns its not something i am interested in but thanks nonetheless

mate the sad thing is your a fellow rook main;C but maybe  yea i am. still bad consumer feedback
---
Frost kinda can, lesion can
---
Remove crouching...
---
I like playing on 4:3 because it does zoom you in so it is a lot easier to hit shots that involve holos and also that its for comfort. Its funny most pros play on 4:3 for Rainbow and CS:GO so their must be a reason people do use it. 
---
Add me Yeubae
---
All 4 matches was me alone
---
This. Rainbow six isnt a game that benefits from cinematic resolution and refresh rates. Unless you REALLY want a 4k gaming machine, then go for it. Otherwise go 1440p 144hz
---
Looks great. I recommend making it a bit higher resolution.
---
big fingers idk what to tell you
---
This helped a lot thank you 
---
Forgot, thanks!
---
Crouch fatigue. 
---
You‚Äôre insane because you can spawn peek. 
---
32 by 32 is pretty simplistic, what do you mean higher resolution? Or is this sarcasm?

Then you unlock the gold one

Thanks for the reminder.

That‚Äôs pretty cool

Oh okay

Have fun and Goodluck in your learning curve into a great game (:

Nice to see snake making an appearance in siege
---
Are you sure you don't mean 'hard cow water'?
---
This is why I can never reach plat 2... elo hell
---
Go you are complaining about how Siege is unrealistic with crouch spamming and whatever else, but not about how in Insurgency you can just jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and hide behind a corner and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump 
---
Im surprised the last one didnt drop shot you
---
But he spelled LOVC. 
---
Shot ash's charge into a reinforced wall, but once i got good, on two occasions i had an ash shoot both her charges into my electrified bandit wall
---
I was silver 2 at the beginning of the day, I‚Äôve been getting on average 8/10 kills every match and now I‚Äôm down to bronze 2 it‚Äôs just a pisstake
---
One thing at a time, crouch spamming is more obvious and anyone can do it. Lean spamming is a little more complex if you can't get the rhythm of it (me cri /s)
---
This format is garbage and makes me want to claw my eyes out.
---
Beautiful 
---
I think his smokes should also block evil eyes and bulletproof cams. Since they can see through the other smokes it would be a good buff for him.
---
What‚Äôs the problem?
---
It's casual though
---
Got better "powerups" too.
---
All of plane
---
That's because the op puts there forearm on the barrel and make a üëå with their hand creating a handmade choke. ^totallywouldntblowtheirhandoff
---
Used to be a huge, unfair, advantage, since you could literally shoot people before you even appeared on their screen, then one year ago there was an update (can't remember which season brought it) which added internet icons and changed the "rules" for people with high ping, the biggest change being that the server rejects most of the shots of a player with high ping, so it's possible to unload a mag into someone without killing him.
---
Now as soon as the yellow ping icon comes out, the game becomes almost unplayable. Which is a great thing from my perspective, since most people stopped playing on the "wrong" server to exploit high ping. The only issue I can think about is that people who lives far from all Ubi's servers are screwed, but I did not see many people complaining about it, so I guess is no big deal

Yeah, shit happens all the time, I usually just end up closing it out despite losing a rank. 
---
Umm smg 12 is vigil's but i get your point... But try to see it like this... For close range you have a pistol that does 99 damage(2shot at max) thats just as spammable than any other in the game... But for long range the same pistol has the worst drop off(drops down to like 30ish damage) and to kill someone beyond 15-20m.. You need to hit 4-5 body shots(with iron sights) and another shot to finish the downed person cause it doesn't kill.... It sucks big time in long range so thats why I go with cavs smg over her shotty anyway. 
---
[This is the original.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0RmRJsgP28)
---
Engine change means that the game will have to be redone from scratch. 
---
What is your issue with Anvil? 
---
Oh I didn't see the first pic's red area 
---
I don't see the point in people trying to "ping abuse" anymore.
---
Id play the snake game mode tbh. Crazy one-off game modes that are around for a limited time are awesome.
---
Very cool, Kanye.
---
*places
---
Uh sandstorm is arcady as fuck. It has low time to kill sure, but most games play out in a very arcade run and gun style. Hell it's even less tactical than the original insurgency which I have about 150 hours in just running around with a shotgun fucking around. 
---
A good 30% of your deaths alone are from people spamming explosives  tubes in your general direction if you play the objective. It takes no real skill or tactics it's just part of the game. 
---
The maps are less linear than the older game which means positioning is ironically enough less important because there's almost always a place where they can get behind you. 
---
Honestly the new game holds over a lot of call of duty style gameplay than siege ever has had. 
---
Blitz, Lion, and BB are the only ones you mentioned that need much changes. Blitz needs to lose his melee, but let him reload from behind his shield. Lion (and I guess Finka) need a 15ish radius of effect instead of being global. BB needs a complete rework as his gadget breaks a fundamental game mechanic.
---
I guess if you wanted to nerf the others, Dokkabi‚Äôs phone should auto turn off after like 8 seconds. Cav and Jackal are balanced, Cav could lower her pistol clip count to ten instead of 15-16. Mav could use VERY MINOR sound increase, too loud and he‚Äôd be useless. Glaz is balanced, and I can‚Äôt think of any minor nerfs that wouldn‚Äôt make him useless.
---
That's exactly the point, it was/is a good fix
---
That's not a glitch that's the enemy doing that. Tgere is a thing tget can do to make all of your team see that.
---
Can I get an invite to the discord server I‚Äôm extremely active on R6
---
yes check
---
Make it so when you press crouch three times in a row you go prone. Solved that problem.
---
Make it so that when you lean back and forth too many times in a row you get knocked down (dizzy) and have to pick yourself up again. Solved that problem.
---
Make it so that if you run you make loud footsteps and use up stamina. Solved that problem.
---
Those aren't long-term solves. Those are interim solutions that could be fairly easily implemented to solve these toxic exploits.

smg 12 smg 11 bearing 9 all good recoil 
---
I mean in the form of weapons. Most operators have weapons that have advantages and disadvantages that you use in different situations. Now, most of the time the alternative is a shotgun and those suck for the most part so the choice is obvious, but her guns have virtually no recoil. Hence the problem.
---
One is still a meatball, the other is a fuckin noodle
---
those drones actually exist in real life and look quite similar ofc don't move like in game and the drones that could jump have a "tail" that launches them quite high. https://www.reconrobotics.com/ 
---
I forgot to mention you I also care what you gals have to say
---
Remember when decision needed to be made quickly and you have to play quietly with tactics, now its just ash main rush, spamming crouch and leaning while dropshotting and flash grenade spamming doming everyone effortlessly   
---
LoOOOool da lord XDDdDDDdDDDDddddddd
---
The g36 is actually really good, better than a lot of other ops primary weapons, just overshadowed by the r4c.
---
She has a quick-breaching gadget and a weapon that allows her to blast her way through a map and a gun that has ridiculously low recoil. 
---
I cant stand the recoil on r4. Long ranges dont even get me started
---
The fact that his gadget negates one of the core mechanic of the game (headshot = one shot kill), he has been balanced but by concept, this ability is broken, it's like having a tankette fighting soldiers, it can be stopped with bullets, but it will generally not be stopped by one normal bullet
---
(and obviously, his ability is pretty much frag oriented, which promote the arcade-style gameplay of 'going for kills' instead of 'playing the objective')
---
DrUgZ
---
I'm already Lion
---
You aren't wrong but if you can play him right he is good you can tachanka Mira and I can get 1-3 kills per ranked round
---
I disagree. Games are far more predictable at lower levels in my experience. Golds try the same strats over and over, plats switch it up to fuck with each other. Diamonds are a whole nother level though, I don't really know too much about diamond level games since we don't really have many over here.

that is a macro isn't it ?
---
i blame rogue-9 for doing a video about this last week.
---
I'll be Maverick
---
Whatever this is, it is interesting and I like it.
---
It is becoming a bit crazy with all the gadgets.  Little benefit to reinforcing outside walls anymore as all you do is bring a maverick and make a bunch of peek holes. Anyone inside objective turns into sitting ducks.
---
The game overall is still fun and interesting but lost its original soul of tactical play, bringing a sledgehammer to open walls.   
---
Also agreed you shouldnt be able to vault over a shield or in a window and immediately ADS and spin move your way to victory.  
---
Hit reg is fine... when you play on LAN or Solo T-hunt, where everything is perfectly synced up, as anyone that has watched pro-league play can attest for. Otherwise it's sub-par at best even when there's only a 10ms difference but that's more whatever ISP you pay fault than it is Ubi's, though there have been patches that had better connection stability, for example I have 400Mb internet from Spectrum and on the patch Para Bellum (avg 70-80ms)  vs Grim Sky (avg 10-30ms) vs Wind Bastion (avg 30-50ms) so there is certainly something in Ubisoft's code that alters this to a degree. Also server side destruction could've been released as opposed the the "updated" textures on destruction, but that's just my opinion considering that's been a known issue as opposed to wasting resources on something that literally no one in the player base even ever complained about.
---
Yes, this is an op i have been thinking about for years.
---
Crouch Spamming does have an impact, just not to the hitboxes lol
---
This has been going on a while, why do people still plan defusers directly on the line of obj rooms?
---
That is a really shitty song
---
Before posting I looked back through new posts to see if anyone already posted this but didn't see any posts, sorry if I missed them.
---
For loadout to work.
---
And dropped them.
---
Maybe it could have something like clash‚Äôs sights
---
Haven't played since they introduced holograms. Like really? Wtf Ubisoft. 
---
i think it's important to find a comfortable niche between shooting and strategy. if you go too far, you either end up with a game that's more about your reflexes, or a game where every round has people running off to the same religiously used corners and spots like in CSGO.
---
That button does nothing, it‚Äôs just there to keep us happy
---
The song is actually good.. tiktok actually killed it 
---
Well there is not really a way to know if you are shooting it on purpose 
---
Yeah, after Lion got autobanned in pro league Ubi had to realize his strength. He had a 87% ban rate at LAN.
---
Btw I made the thatcher one, your doc one looks really good, I had an animation for the thatcher icon so I‚Äôm upset gifs don‚Äôt upload correctly for some odd reason 
---
Just when i thought the world had enough cancer..
---
Why the hell does T-hunt require an internet connection and isn‚Äôt splitscreen is what I want to know.
---
This is true.. BUT I c4'd a month yesterday. He must've been low or the c4 hit him good
---
I'm with ubi on this - you need to aim better. IF you insist you're hitting the carrier and not the hostage, proof will be required 
---
I agree with every point that was made. Unfortunately, I doubt Ubisoft will stop the development of new operators or maps in favor of reworking the game due to the fact that people have bought the season pass and expect a return on that investment. 
---
ok but youre on page 80 I'm page 3, dont say things that dont apply
---
Lol yeah, I could just see what you meant, but I think that the winning team deserves the satisfaction of flexing gear...
---
Isn‚Äôt that just personal preference/situational?
---
It's Casual, nobody cares, stop spamming trash gameplay.
---
Yes they are bannable under external programs. Also related are the use of scripts, mods, and hacks.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs is a C4, one friendly remaining.
---
In fact I‚Äôm making another rn
---
I believe There is a setting called Vertical Sync, the original setting is maximum 30fps, after you turn that off/on it will change to 60fps
---
Really I didnt see it?
---
There is no Elo difference in this game exept diamond 
---
I saw Insane players in copper 4 
---
I saw bad players in platinum
---
I myself am umrankend because it doesn‚Äôt matter you will get a charm yea but not based on skill rather based on the skill of your whole team and the skill of the players you faced 
---
I bet you in copper to silver  are players way better than me and you and I also bet you that even on diamond are some booted noobs
---
Jus go whatch this  video about it  featureing Kickstar ( who is currently on platinum I believe but still playing better than many active pros ) https://youtu.be/mv3GK2R0dUo

Take my money

That button is a placebo

You‚Äôre like 6 hours late. It‚Äôs possible you could miss them. 
---
I love these videos. So catchy and so true
---
At 5 seconds in
---
Even in fairly high level play (plat) if you have peeker‚Äôs advantage and you have good aim and flicks you will win every gunfight. The sole exceptions are Mira strats, BB, and Glaz on small openings or very far away.
---
But I got friends who‚Äôve been using macros to crouch and lean spam for a while now and they haven‚Äôt gotten banned :/
---
Stop these shitty tik tok vids
---
I mean they could make it so it doesn't count as a team kill if the enemy team is escorting it or something. At least griefers would still get kicked for killing in prep phase and such.
---
This way nobody can complain about ‚Äúruining casual‚Äù and whoever wants to just have fun can and whoever wants to take it seriously still can as well it‚Äôs a simple fix to the toxicity and Ubisoft needs to hire me
---
Anything on bank 
---
No need to get heated. Jeez this post was suppose to be fun...
---
I agree with what you say. But I do think some of the issues the OP mentioned should still be addressed
---
Uh that is clearly legos
---
LKF: Thatcher was a closer for the Yankees prior to joining S.A.S.  He won a couple rings in the ‚Äò90s with them 
---
1. someone has to win if the hostage dies
---
2. if you would win for killing the hostage AT ANY MOMENT, it could be abused
---
3. if you wouldn't get kicked (and banned) for killing the hostage, it could be abused to throw games without repercussion
---
Yeah that's what I mean but I forgot about the sporting but even though mav CiA and Irene :)) (an operator for the future) delta force 
---
It‚Äôs always fun to run shotgun with Ying

Or I‚Äôll say whatever I want and you‚Äôll just ignore it next time instead of being a cuck

---
What about other 89% of my message?
---
This is r/gaming material.
---
Also it's a meme, going against posting guidelines.
---
Does that work with the normal PS4? At the moment I do not own a PS4 pro if that makes any difference. 
---
So accidents don't happen? You know what it looks like when the guy runs with it right? The hostage just warps all over the place following a player. Even if you wanted to shoot it on purpose you could end up killing the guy escorting it instead by accident. I won't appeal a 30 ban but still, this is too unforgiving.
---
That one probably makes something happen lol
---
I‚Äôve been asking for that since day 1. I really don‚Äôt get why they can‚Äôt make that work
---
I can't even crouch and walk properly, let alone shoot and being accurate
---
Also placebo. I used mnk and tk‚Äôd daily on Xbox and was untouchable. They don‚Äôt care 
---
I came to think it's just absolutely random.. I see no link whatsoever with my skills and result and the people I'm matched against, 95% of the time it's against people that are way above my own threshold. 
---
Not arguing with that
---
Who else sees nothing wrong with this picture but the drone?

The music itself sounds good but what its about makes it cringe and i hate it

Full team of Recruits sounds OP. wait...

I would very much like to meet your friend.

Does she look like a T?

Tachanka **is** the link between *mere* mortals and gods.
---
Well. Why do you think Siege is so popular? Itvbegan as a tactic shooter once... now it's arcadey and you have all these flashy comical skins around which are fitting for Overwatch, but not Siege.
---
You don't trash talk The Living Tombstone...
---
Also a direct ban without warning on the first team kill of a game which can happen anytime is ridiculous
---
This is fucking atrocious.
---
"Test it" 
---
I remember you could destroy a thermite charge while shooting from the other side of a reinforced wall. They took like 3 months to fix it
---
I mean that‚Äôs sorta what they look like IRL, it‚Äôs a combat handgun you aren‚Äôt supposed to be able to snipe with it just put the sights on a man sized target and fill that target with bullets.
---
Nerf LMG *WAT?!*
---
I like that it is a bit arcadey because i came from cs, but i agree on this one, no place for crouchspamming, even valve, the worst developer didnt let that into csgo. 
---
I thought this sub had a "no memes" rule? Are the mods here retarded?
---
Hackers used to use thunt offline to test hacks before implemented in online matches as offline hacks cannot be detected. There was also a problem of people hacking to get renown.
