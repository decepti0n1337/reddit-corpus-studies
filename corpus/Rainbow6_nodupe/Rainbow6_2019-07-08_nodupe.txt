Cav main here. It couldn‚Äôt have been caveira‚Äôs pistol because by only downing someone you get 75 points (50 for injure + 25 for Luison bonus). Also, if it were a headshot, 20 extra points would be added, making it 75 points. Anyway, i know this has already been cleared up by OP but i felt like y‚Äôall should know this. (:
---
Awesome
---
yeah they were
---
Finka would also be good.
---
Unfortunately no, it's based on an average of your squad, hence why you typically see 1 or 2 coppers with a plat/diamond.
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive to be fair, a lot of the guys cosplaying at con can do one of the easier ops for under ¬£100
---
Woah
---
She is in pro league. She just doesn't get picked because she completely lacks mobility and/or kill potential which are the biggest factors in an operator for pro league.
---
Ok. Are you the one who isn‚Äôt understanding now? You tell them not to. And if they start to. Damage them, kill them, yell at them, it‚Äôs up to you.

I'm just starting on PC but am level 78 on Xbox. Would you want to play next Saturday?

This streamers is know as teogames also know as teo on YouTube he has played rainbow six in the past and is now currently play a variety of different games now and days just putting this out there for anyone who doesn't know whi he is
---
*Vert*

Same but probably because I'm rushing 25fps max normally 15 fps
---
Never touched Ranked (nor do I plan to) so what's the problem?

He needs to be more THICCCC

Doc is 3 armor, and that doesnt matter when he was killing dokkaebi

Fr. All I get are fucking Arthur Morgan‚Äôs and John martsons who cap me as soon as they see me.
---
Teo!
---
‚Äúprobably wont face that same team ever again‚Äù
---
Yes, you are going to face the same team again. Maybe not sequentially, but you will most likelt encounter them again.
---
And even if you dont encounter them again, you will encounter another team like them, or another team that has been unintentionally boosted into your bracket. 
---
As long as people continue to create teams consisting of different ranks, wether they intend to boost or not, the boosting problem will remain.
---
im redneck45acp on uplay
---
Yeah I have said it was bosg but that was a mistake I made it was actually the mk14 so sorry for the miscommunication
---
Oh it's only start problem , we dig deeper , we got ourselves a leaver or 2 leavers , it is not a fair match , but u still get the lose as it was 5 of u . I mean since 1st season Overwatch has very good thing , when you got yourselves a leaver it gives him time to go back into match , and then if you want to play it - you play it 5v6 but if you lose you don't get lose to your MMR
---
That‚Äôs why they WILL DO IT WHEN YOU EXIT, LEAVE, DONT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THAT ROOM. AND THEY GO UP TO THE WALL.
---
I agree with you, I'll see level 45 copper II's while I constantly get ranked High gold low plat every season, even in casual I‚Äôll put my bare minimum effort and strategizing and I still shit on the enemy team, it‚Äôs not necessarily the players fault though, because the game has had such a long lifespan, and a consistently growing player-base, that even players that have played since launch are encountering new players nearly every game that don‚Äôt have a chance, it‚Äôs like a paradox the game has created in itself. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt really think much can be done, we saw the newcomer playlist introduced but it just gets filled with smurfs.
---
I do but that's because my headphones don't work in my crappy laptop.
---
Gaming pc busted with viruses from my brother
---
Red cams look weird nowüò´
---
Do you have the names of them because that just happened to me too
---
I would not expect this to happen every time , don‚Äôt worry u just got matched with a toxic team .
---
Imagine thinking that‚Äôs a valid reason to ban for saying a character dies in a movie that was released April 26 and was shown in the latest movie Spider-Man: Far From Home, was in the trailer for such movie. You all are pathetic at best.
---
I guess I‚Äôm lucky enough to play with people who accept the advice then.
---
It doesnt matter if the ops are original or not
---
I agree
---
Nah I like him
---
Seeing as he‚Äôs banned every ranked game, idk if that‚Äôs a good move just yet. Thinking higher priced op now would save me in the long run.
---
This is why castle is a good op
---
It‚Äôs amazing how many times I could say the same thing for the person to understand the word ‚Äúleave‚Äù
---
You've answered your own question. Vigil. Spawn peek, do it, join the darkside
---
I didn‚Äôt understand it either.
---
until I got scanned once while roaming, went back to OBJ, dodged a claymore, got hit by a ying and then trackal‚Äôd again
---
They can‚Äôt aim high to hit their dreams
---
Amazing
---
hol up thats mine
---
It puts them into a position they dont belong, and over the span of a couple games they could very easily get 200 mmr.
---
Because they're cunts.
---
Rule #1 in ranked, never play with 2 or less squad members, unless your in high gold or above
---
No I understood. I just didn‚Äôt realize you were playing with people who were that stupid.
---
Just say no homo
---
Spam and fish for headshots with the hi cap? Think thats what he means with shit aim.
---
N√∏kk if u normally get headshots, don't get her if u normally kill by bodyshots. Dokkaebi is fun, her kit is somewhat different to other opperaters, featuring
---
- A dmr that's stupidly OP if u can aim
---
- A shotgun that for some reason has the range of a sniper
---
- An uncontrollable smg
---
- And finally making ur enemies moms or girlfriends (or both if ur into that :|)call at awkward times
---
Yeah I figured this out the hard way lol
---
Yup I noticed when half enemy team entered no noise since they shot the glass
---
No I don‚Äôt but that‚Äôs what I would do to annoy you and not be able to tk for the rest of the game.
---
He should have a shotgun primary and a shotgun secondary
---
I see 0 problem
---
No one:
---
u/oklahomen: Let's spend the next three hours of my life breaking windows
---
He...he shot around your shield with a shotgun. Shotguns can hit the shield AND you at the same time since they shoot more than one projectile at a time.
---
Could the smoke technically be used as a projectile since I threw it to kill him or no
---
Frost the goat
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
This shit happens on every gaming subreddit.    
---
I lose track of how many times I've posted the exact same comment answering the exact same question over the coarse of a few days after a game gets an update.
---
Ive never had that happen that sounds kind of cool haba
---
Only problem with that is, if you aren't above a 1.0kd and at least gold, when you go back into casuals you'll get kicked before you even see the screen.
---
Happened twice to me, and always in objective while my other teammate just watches us
---
Great name and I‚Äôve tried that, didn‚Äôt work for me either
---
Except when he shot the round it didn't have time to spread, you can see all of the rounds hitting the shield... along with the thud
---
yeet
---
Bright side, them learning in ranked will make it so we get better mmr
---
The taser lasts longer if you tap fire instead of holding
---
Yeah, R6 community can be pretty friggin harsh.
---
Damn , you beat me to it
---
He believes in an honorable battle
---
Yeah, the R6 community can be pretty friggin harsh if they detect even the slightest hint of noob.
---
thanks man
---
Hereford is my fave map
---
Siege is broken.
---
In other news, water is wet
---
Thats not how the placement system works, you always have a mmr rating. Even brand new players are considered 2500mmr which is gold4 silver1.
---
If you win a few of your placement matches (especially if you were high rank last season) you can easily be a plat 3 while being unranked.
---
It‚Äôs a visual glitch she really has her shield up but it looks like she is holding her barbwire...No advantage
---
Srsly tho, this needs more upvotes!
---
Why?
---
No_Aim
---
I‚Äôm kind of struggling like this too. I‚Äôve had the game since December 2015 but my highest ever rank was Plat 3. I switched to PC about a month ago, and I am silver. My name is ConnT117 if you want to play together.

This makes me want throwing knives, at least for showdown

In most games they're not considered projectiles since they're usually hit scan

Filthy atheist

That would be soooooo sick
---
Close app and restart it, its worked for me
---
To me, this is boosting. I know that's harsh and you arent doing it with bad or malicious intentions. You are lowering the average MMR of the group by having such a low ranked player in the stack and if that then ranks you with, say, mid golds the plat players are going to walk all over them.
---
You leave Mozzie out of this, he's basically the only new op that makes any sense. I mean yeah, spider robots that hack drones are a bit silly but hacking drones for the defenders to use is amazing and should have been added to the game earlier
---
Just restart your game. That worked for me
---
I play at odd times so solo is my main queue unfortunately but I'll keep trying. Thanks.
---
I remember playing this match

Though probs bad for my teammates bc that would be all I would be using, throwing knives

Its a known issue. Any kind of mass text slows the servers down at the moment, it‚Äôs unfortunate.

I turned off text chat in this game. Videos like this reaffirm that decision for me.

We weren't against copper, we were gains plats as they p ok aced plat becsuse they play 2 games, get salty, and stop.
---
And I have been, I was gold 1 for two seasons before deranking as I don't put that much into ranking as I don't really care, but my friends like to play it more than casual, so I end up playing like a casual game, but I usually rank in Gold solo queuing.

Bronze 3 either needs to get better or you all play casual together.  Simple.

You would think

Sledge is Rook on attack

And now everyone is such a try hard

Yes by being as garbage a player as possible

Funny thing is at first I thought it was a god shot by someone with inhuman aim

nice bait
---
The attackers have a lot more operators with acogs and better guns to counter spawn peeking. Also they have drones to find spawnpeekers even before spawning in.
---
&gt;When I use it zooms in way too much yet uses it looks perfect and has great recoil
---
It doesnt affect recoil and also blocks a lot of your view which is bad for close contact firefights. There are cons and pros for using an acog.
---
not a dumb question. Yes I have the paypal purchase on my history, Charged with nothing to show for it!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
tbh i think they should give it to me and full refund me its a bit ridiculous ....
---
Lol
---
What rank are you?
---
Well we don‚Äôt necessarily play ranked with the bronze 3, not gonna lie we have before but it‚Äôs not often. He‚Äôs a newer player and doesn‚Äôt like the new ranked system but honestly I didn‚Äôt expect to get so many reply‚Äôs
---
Lucky
---
I don‚Äôt have any Black Ice on PC but I have plenty on PS4, but I left PS4 a long time ago
---
That's when I'm using it but it looks like it's perfect to other players

Damage drop off over range and through surfaces along with the armor of the op and rook armor all have to be factored in

That‚Äôs ok, I wanted Ela but I got an Alibi legendary weapon skin and bought Alibi instead.

Ive always maintained that every op should have their own situation.

---
i was kidding dont worry
---
It just pulled me in the wall like "get in here"
---
Step one do you have a ps4
---
Yeah its the exact same
---
i get it, maybe nerf it a bit
---
Yes
---
Well shit, I'm floating Gold 1 and Plat 3, but I'm matched with Diamonds and Pro League players from my local region.
---
Sure. Mute,report and block.
---
It's easily the best gun in the game. Don't think people would want to deal with 2 of them.
---
Step 2 do you have a xeperia or iphone
---
Goddamnit.
---
Step two download an app called ps4 remote play
---
It‚Äôs been abused in pro league, and in the game for quite some time, it‚Äôs just not really abused a lot so they don‚Äôt care.
---
ok in that case i‚Äôd agree with a nerf
---
For me, they took a map that needed some minor tweaks (mostly to reduce spawn peeking or maybe add another route between floors) and turned it into yet another set of stacked mazes.
---
It feels larger, poorly lit, more difficult to navigate, and, like most of the new maps, lacks unique sites or gameplay. 
---
tl:dr; old Hereford had an identity. The new one doesn't.
---
With that said, I'm a filthy casual, not a pro, so maybe they like the new one better.
---
There can be only one lord
---
I was doing my placements last night and ran into the same 5 stack 3 times that were being carried by a diamond. Kinda ruined my motivation for ranked.
---
Definitely saw this posted about a day ago...  day old account...? Hmmm...
---
Nah
---
Yeah I can definitely assume the guy was being boosted. That being said I have been down to copper nearing the end of a season and my friends in diamond have played a match or two with me because we worked together. Not because of boosting.... So there's a realistic side and a cheating/exploiting side of what could be going on
---
That was my post that i accidentally deleted on my phone
---
Genetic defect?
---
Those are two separate problems, no?  
---
Make it so that when matchmaking the system uses the highest ranked player as the overall measure for the whole team. But perhaps when calculating how much one wins/loses we keep the old system. Why not?
---
That kind of skill is not to be praised but instead to be feared.
---
Casual is pretty broken in that regard. But hey, it could prove you're already better than a level 350
---
How is it made by
---
\&gt;casual  
---
No thank you
---
I‚Äôm so confused within your question... there‚Äôs no pic?
---
Yeah I noticed that
---
this would honestly help players get good waaaaaay faster than shooting at bots
---
damn thats some great recoil control!
---
im assuming so, the website said youll get the bossg skin after completing the ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù
---
Yikes.
---
It doesnt even take that long, how about you have some patience instead of crying an entire river. I bet you always vote kick because you dont want someone to "waste your time." Oh boo hoo you cant spare less than a minute to get another teammate to help you and your team out. Delete your post

I always want to have a high damage on the first 2 bullets on my pistol. I personally don't see myself hitting any bullets after the first 3, which is why I want to make sure that I can kill the person within those bullets.
---
Yeah. They didn't play well.
---
What the how
---
That's cool. I think that's mainly what's keeping me from hitting higher ranks. I only play and communicate with my cousin and we get paired up with randoms all the time so it's hard to get in a groove.
---
Xbox?
---
Yeah it happened because of the new game mode. You can either switch them all back now, or Ubi will probably revert the changes soon enough. Restarting/Resetting the game didn't work for any of my friends that got the bug.
---
You fucking killed him dude!
---
At the very least sponsor a pro player or fan favorite to make video tutorials on different aspects of the game. This would simply be a link within the game that connects to the video via YouTube.
---
that‚Äôs what i was thinking, lemme add that

---
Bruh you were probably playing with me
---
You haven't seen my brother then. He is a phenom, and doesn't have Reddit, and an actual life.

Yeah, it's always hard to queue with randos. Especially when they forget that Teamwork makes the Dream work.
---
I guess I need time to get used to it then!
---
I completely agree and I really wish there was something that we could do to end it.
---
Where can you see this at?
---
Yes, I feel your pain. A couple weeks ago, I was in a ranked game, it kicked me out as soon as the game started (It was not my fault, the game showed some error code or some shit), and I couldn't join back. I restarted multiple times and It didn't give me any option to join the game back. So I queue'd up, hoping it would put me in. Then I joined a completely new game. I recieved a message that I was banned in the MIDDLE of my new game. I was banned for 20 mins and I had a renown penalty. This is while I'm IN my new game. I finished the game, didn't lose any elo for the game I left, however, the new game that I joined (and won), I received 3mmr.
---
It's just a glitch/bug in the game and you can't do anything about it. If it gives you an error code, search it up on google and if you can't fix it, re-install your game.
---
To bad i only got like 40 upvotes lol for 3 hours
---
That fixed it thanks
---
You deserve more, I can't believe you actually did this
---
Gotta agree. It seems like ZOP is the one who's actually taking it too seriously haha
---
If you play t hunt on it there's no bombers, c4 rooms, or barbed wire

No helicopter. 0/10

---
I KNEW IT
---
This is why I just play Maestro/Valk so I can scream RIGHT THERE with *some* validity.
---
I‚Äôd get bored to death if there were only 7 maps in Ranked, but I‚Äôm all for dropping Skyscraper.
---
I'm in Low plat and I play with some friends that are high silver/low gold. Although most of the time I find myself playing with other plats in the game, there are always games where I'm the only plat and dominate. I receive VERY little for winning and lose a LOT for losing however, usually it's a very easy stomp. I don't want to stop playing with my friends because if it was implemented, I would have to de-rank on purpose which is throwing. (not allowed).

It's not bad map. Just because you get ran out on alot doesnt mean it should be removed. Sure it might be annoying, but you can always do it yourself to even the odds

We need only PL maps, and at least 4 rounds on both attack and defense. There is a reason they dont play certain maps. And 4 rounds would force the defending team to use all sites on the defender sided maps.

I suggest watching some youtube videos. If you came from console, you should already have a decent amount of map knowledge, but PC requires a lot more on callouts and you need to know maps just as much as you need to practice mechanical skill (A LOT).

How did you deny ela mine?

I let the buttons disapear and then just screen record and boom directly to my phone

says the person who wrote an essay in response lmao

seems like you both take it too seriously. instead of typing an essay, just say ‚Äúk‚Äù. makes him 10x more upset
---
Dude I have the app I‚Äôm clearly playing it
---
That's what the wall said
---
Damn, put him in a Coffin
---
Not really, hes just the only legitimate counter to roamers, and since roaming is really popular in ranked it ends up that jackals kit comes in very handy. As the win delta shows, he‚Äôs technically the worst op in the game in ranked.
---
I have no idea how you are alive. You got good aim for a controller.

bruh

You load up and go "Hey J√§ger, can you reinforce hatch upstairs?"

J√§ger just stares at you before running off to spawn peek only to get domed. Then you hear,

How did you guys lose a 5 v 3

That's okay

Oh, you‚Äôre one of those I killed? My bad man

Just finished watching it! Very high quality and I think you deserve more subs!
---
The same thing happened to me but it was two diamonds and three coppers
---
Even though I‚Äôm not a new player, I‚Äôd still do them for fun! Never hurts to go back to basics every once in awhile.
---
Better call corporate, LOSER! McD's don't give a damn bout you or yo mommy!

The irony in this

And thats how you distroy one map in 5s

That was just me

If you have 1000s in extra money laying around... Sure why not

Casual has a separate, hidden MMR. You're basically in Casual Copper, where all the toxic people are.
---
After ages only playing Casual, I pretty much only get nice teammates. Not amazing at the game, but nice and respectful

Lol, what system do you play on?

‚ÄúJesus, you fucking killed him dude‚Äù.            Reference spotted

Max of 9... Not 4

I just hit the mute button right on my headset if im done talking usually (arctis 3 hesdset $70)
---
I'm more upset they even let Clash back in the game it was way more fun without her in the game Maverick was the only good thing about Grimsky (cause re-worked Hereford is straight booty cheeks)
---
None of these are wise options though.

Its a poorly designed map. It almost always forces players to repel to acsess key locations on the map. This is a problem because the repeling and mantling systems are so clunky and usually lead to your death.
---
one of the best parts of this game is trolling people with echo drone.
---
"bE gRaTeFuL tHaT tHeYrE sTiLl UpDaTiNg ThE gAmE" -Shill

I had a guy tk my for not letting him castle a will while a lion scan was going off. Also the lion and someone else where in a room adjacent to us. This was on pc and the guy was lvl 65. He raged so much on a casual game.

All the thicc actually cimes from the armour rook and doc (the thiccbois) are actually the lightest characters in the game
---
That ain't gunna fit on his hip
---
Theres zero counter. Apart from never roaming
---
I know, like mira shouldn't be able to see her
---
Never going to happen.
---
Blitz, Clash, and Monty fears are at least completely rational though. Global abilities as well.
---
Reminds me of the Paris Hilton ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch‚Äù video.
---
PS4. I see you play on XBOX ONE. This makes me sad. ;_;
---
according to rogue-9, doc &amp; rook are among the lightest operators in regards to weight, making this meme inaccurate. downvote
---
The map is fine. Maybe you shouldn't stay outside since you cant win gunfights. Spawn kills and run outs are so easy to counter. Just because you get smacked doesn't mean the map should be removed
---
Its 12pm...

Literally just happened

That works great for full parties, but think about what happens when you queue without a full five-man. If you, a plat 2, and three copper friends queue together, you get matched with a random plat 2 who now has to play a 2v5 because of you.
---
The simplest solution to this is preventing players from queuing with each other (outside of a five-man) if they exceed a given MMR gap. Five-mans could follow Apex's rule, since you aren't at the risk of ruining someone else's game.
---
That would single-handedly stop what is effectively smurfing on primary accounts.
---
Prolly not

Yeah, OP took it way too seriously. I just ignore people like that.
---
M8 you forgot about toxic teammates and how to deal with them
---
I recently started playing Alibi. She‚Äôs a lot better than I had originally thought, and I got my favorite clip of all time playing as her. Even better than the aces, ninja defuses, and wallbangs, my favorite is a nutty cross hallway 1v3 spraydown for the victory. It felt amazing. 
---
I do play a lot more Alibi now, but Lesion will always be my go-to
---
Completely agreed about the engine thing. It was already creaking under the load of Year 1 mechanics never mind what we have now in Year 4. 
---
It was never made secret that the sudden and runaway success of Siege so long after release really caught the dev team off guard. Siege was meant to be a year or 18-month long throwaway project that would fade into obscurity and suddenly they were faced with an influx of millions of players and a lack of infrastructure to deal with it. Operation Health was a tacit admission they were struggling engine wise, and needed time to put sticking plasters on the parts of the game they had to hastily throw together and release in a rush to satisfy the ‚Äúgames a service‚Äù model Siege had suddenly grown into.
---
I know they‚Äôll never outright come out and say it even if it were the case, but my gut feeling given how much of a state the game is in this season is that the whole pooch is screwed, the game is finally completely broken and they haven‚Äôt the first clue how to even begin fixing it never mind coming up with a long term plan for keeping things in check.
---
I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but then again I also hope Siege 2 on a modern, fit for purpose DX12/Vulkan engine with the supporting capable infrastructure to back it up is on the way sooner rather than later.
---
You cant hide from your fears
---
Right I just played siege because of the subreddit
---
I hate it because I get up to high gold get 2 games off plat and the have mnk they win and I go back down plus they spent ¬£120-¬£140. People also say it's not bad when I play that's either they aren't high ranked or they aren't part of the European servers where it's worse especially on xbox
---
No problem, good luck üòò

---
Play smart, don‚Äôt go for frags every game or you‚Äôll start losing rounds when you could‚Äôve planted and stuff.
---
Win games, dont lose games.
---
I‚Äôm getting a little heated at my game, mb
---
Ok thx no frags then
---
Boy do I wish they would. Nah they want the money by making it a limited time event, so you feel like you have to get it now or never.
---
Obviously
---
Damn it nokk
---
Would you recommend playing Vsync on console?
---
Star Commands favourite 3 armour Space Ranger.
---
Yeah especially because a lot of people think that being MVP is more important then getting a plant down but I‚Äôve seen lots of people go for a kill instead of an easy plant and then we lose. Also just stick to one strat with a team, don‚Äôt always think you can win faster by going all the way around and flanking because a lot of times, ESPECIALLY WITH DEFUSER!
---
but the problem then comes from playing with lower ranked friends since they'll just have a miserable experience getting tossed around by higher ranks. part of the issue in this particular game is the fact that every gun is a one shot headshot, so your skill curve changes dramatically and it affects your lower ranked friends you want to play with. everyone's giving ubi a lot of shit for not implementing it this way but I don't think it's as simple as people make it out to be
---
It really depends. If you are playing ranks, you are not likely to get Echo due to him getting banned. 
---
It's hard to go wrong with Nomad and Buck for Attacker and Mira for defense (Echo too if you don't play rank). Mira need some map knowledge but  her mirror placement is something you learn pretty quickly especially just by watching some ppl playing her. 
---
Dokkaebi isn't bad especially if you struggle against the roamers and want to support your team without directly involving in fights. She really helped my learning curve by being able to move more freely without needing to drone every single room in fear of roamers thanks to her phone call. 
---
Nokk in my opinion is overestimated. She's very reliant on Anchors making a mistake rather than how good the player is. As long as the anchors are pressuring the entry points, her stealth is greatly diminished as she doesn't really have a way to compete against Anchors who have more armor and range (some with higher damage). She's like Cav in that you are not likely to see her the higher rank you are.
---
The best part about these clips is that the match before they got an alpha pack as well.
---
Clash with a p10c, man of culture i see.
---
I have no idea about console but if you have the option and it is called "Vsync", it probably works exactly like Vsync on PC. It ads about 16.67 seconds of input lag.
---
So, I'm pretty sure NO, do not use it.
---

Noooooooooooooo.........

Some games (fortnite) capping your fps adds input lag. I'm not sure about r6 though
---
Someone needs a good butt clenching
---
Is there even a Beretta 92 in game?
---
I do not normally have a potato pc
---
I think you just should play ranked instead of casual. If i get TK'd its always in Casual, and even that is quiet rare (on purpose TK's only). U are doing something wrong, if you get tk'd in ranked on purpose. Because the team wants to win and rank up. In Casual you are not playing for anything.  It's as simple as that.

If you read my comment again i said they think it takes too much time to learn on their own. They would prefer the learn the game by playing it not by watching youtube and twitch, which in my opinion is reasonable.
---
The ranked player base has been split 3 ways for the past 3 years, bomb, secure and hostage players, and even then queue times were not bad. They have just unified the players base so that everyone is now playing bomb. So even if they were to add a solo queue ranked playlist, the playerbase would still only be split 2 ways.
---
What?

Looks awesome! At least you have the right gear...I don't even have a helmet lmao
---
Dark souls
---
When your team is made up from a bunch of quitters
---
How else could we need nerf people like ash or Jaeger instead of taking away their ACOG
---
Also make Ela's smg recoil so hard that the secondary is better for long range
---
No trust me, im not that good. Its just the famas with reflex is a laser and probably best attack weapon
---
Uh no, you can‚Äôt get better if you don‚Äôt play ranked, simple logic
---
You just have to not get stunned to be able to shoot it and know where it is
---
I‚Äôve just played so much to know that more than 90% of alpha packs that I‚Äôve opened are commons/uncommons and I figure it‚Äôs the same for most people.
---
Im actually shit at the game and no one got pissed at me yet
---
Making the gun less good, lower fire rate, damage, recoil stuff like that.
---
The only reasons to pick the G36C was the angled grip, and now the ACOG.
---
At every other point the R4-C was way better
---
But why even use an acog on ash? She is an Entry Fragger who rushes in, you don‚Äôt need to hold deep angled with her.
---
Tip use glaz will using vigil but only allow your self to one tap people. If you dont want to practice vigils smg is amazing but i would recommend using the bosg on dokki long range maps and as long as you feel you can hit your shot. As for showdown the revolver is your bread and butter for spamming but use the bosg in really long range fights or to one tap in the obj.
---
Recoil patterns and damage are the only real ways to do it.
---
Dang, wish that was me. I got a common skin from it.
---
Yeah, but by meme age standards it's from the meme antiquity, probably not helped by the fact that memes nowadays have a life-span of about a week or two.
---
I don't mind the gadgets and stuff but I hate the gun balance and recoil. Like why does a .308 and full auto shotgun have less recoil than a 9mm smg.
---
I choose all three!
---
Lol it was on my smurf so im not really happy
---
"They hated him because he told them the truth"
---
A lot. If you want ash with an ACOG use the G36C. It‚Äôs not a bad gun. The r4 is just better. Also, J√§ger doesn‚Äôt need an ACOG. We already get spawnpeekers enough with 1 speeds. How would you like a 3 speed one.
---
I‚Äôll take no_aim thank you very much

Anytime somebody posts this, I check their history and I notice that they have never posted or barely posted, indicating that they are either a troll or just new. Such is the case with you as well.

You play montagne enough yet you don't know his gloves are fingerless? hmm

---
Sick purple drop mate!
---
And I was so good at it that got me a promotion on the grip
---
Could be advanced videos but not situations. It would be hard to make aI that advanced
---
Map knowledge is key. Learn cam spots routs to objectives etc.
---
When customizing weapons find attachments that suit you, don't use an ACOG if you don't like zoomed sights.
---
And finally be aware that enemies can see your Lazer and you can see theirs so be on the look out.
---
Lol some gamers really do take this game seriously and thats both of you.

stop talking about matchmaking in casual in terms of where they are in ranked
---
For gods sake R6, just do the only logical thing and make the HIGHEST MMR THE LOBBY MMR.
---
Apex can do it and you can do it too.
---
Try running the game alt tabbed when you do whatever you do on R6FIX (I've never submitted anything), I'd assume even though you're not actively playing that your laptop would still be using the better GPU.
---
The "wallpaper" like you said is entirely created in photoshop
---
Worst Thatcher ever... :)
---
There is a lot of stuff still missing in R6. I'm sill waiting for a system where people need to accept a found match so nobody is afk at the start of the round or a check that the game only starts when all 10 people are connected.

Time to get rid and move on.   
---
If people cant understand that you playing games with your friends is a way you interact or just cool off or just forget about everything else for that short time then they aint worth dealing with.   
---
"So you want to stay in tonight instead of coming out and seeing me you want to stay in on your own"  
---
Err firstly its a thursday, work tomorrow. Secondly its a couple of hours for me to hang out with friends who all live spread out around the country. Friday night and saturday nights are perfect for going out. I see you during the week as well.  
---
"oh so you want to stay in and play games with your friends instead of me?".  
---
You cant win with them so just leave them. Especially when they are like that.
---
Yes i do sir. Just the fact that R6 community never gives a chance to the Small Youtubers that have a wonderful potential is ridiculous.
---
Frankly, you typing up an english paper just to "win" the argument while simultaneously bring up stats makes it seems like you both need to chill. This comes off pretty desperate.
---
If u call not having a round to relax the "time of your life" having to play against plat or at least 2/3 gold one" then ok. Then what you suggest, that I stop playing with friends who just bought the game and then we stop playing the game since we like to play together? What is your suggestion?
---

---
Some rich varmint huntin mofos!!
---
The irony here is phenomenal.
---
In that one situation where you play as Smoke to defend a hostage, you're still in the old Hereford Base. Great for nostalgia, but it'll throw newcomers in a bit of a loop when they find a different Hereford in matches.
---
The only way it can change is by having a team mmr and a personal mmr.
---
It went from beta to early access
---
As much as you don't want to hear this; suck it up. 
---
"A few of them have a wonderful potential.." Yes, absolutely, but simultaneously plenty of them just want to try to make money, and thus will post (for the most part) the same content as everyone else but lower quality. Why should people take the gamble of "hm, will this &lt;insert subcount here&gt; waste my time for 25 minutes or not?" when they could just as easily watch someone they know holds quality? 
---
The fact of the matter is that right now, no matter the game, is one of the hardest periods so far to grow a stream or a YouTube. Everyone and their grandma is doing it, thus even IF they wanted to find a low-subcount YouTuber - what are the odds of them finding you over the rest of them? It's a grind, eventually you might blow up - or you won't. There is no guarentee in this market.
---
A good position and a good sliver of an angle is what you need
---
The way I see it Alibi is a pure fragging operator. Her gun is amazing, she is also a 3 speed and has impacts AND a pocket shotgun. 
---
Her gadget is rather meh tbh, it would be a lot better with some tweaks like changing stances or faster deployment.  As discussed before them having the appropriate uniforms and headgears is according to Ubisoft not possible.
---
Currently, actively using them right before an enemy pushes is risky and if they have someone droning they are rather useless. The only time I found a good use for them was using them a visual cover but that requires keeping a vigilant eye for drones and trusting the enemy doesn't blindly fire into the projections.

---
Grave Plots are expensive you know
---
I would say it's both but I just don't care for 1v1s it's kinda one of those things only damn annoying little kids and grown men with no lives do on COD so I kinda agree with you because almost all FPS require the skills and know how to move around the map strategically and quickly during many different situations and rainbow is a great game in this because it raises the skill roof by presenting you with a harder possible situation then most FPS can present without cheesing you. Does that make sense, I'm sorry sometimes I have trouble explaining my thoughts
---
Should put ads down for big PP
---
How can they rank up when in silver matchmaking you play 4v5 all the time (at best)
---
Only with projectiles though, because I'm the fastest in the west.
---
Worst thing that comes from a TK is that hell down you or kill you for 1 round then reverse damage is on.
---
Alright good to know
---
ok, I'll add you and just PM me or send an Xbox message if you wanna play
---
You dont. 
---
I climbed myself from bronze to gold this season.  Some matches were fucked but majority are generally okay.
---
Perfectly cut
---
That is definitely not for new players. I am still new to this game and by far the biggest problem is map knowledge. Especialy when using drones, I have no idea where I am or where should I go.
---
Without map knowledge I wouldn‚Äôt be able to use knowledge from many of those proposed tutorials. And when I get to the point I get an idea how maps look and start to be ready for those tutorials, I definitely won‚Äôt be new player anymore.

It is. It's also one of the many reasons I cannot get a girlfriend.

---
I think only having one map a year is better. Let‚Äôs you put more time into learning it.

I think what you mean is that aim matters in fps games but siege has way more than just aim to prove, right?
---
That‚Äôs a really hard d you got there
---
Denial of service.  Ddos is distributed denial of service.  It's called that because it usually takes many systems to collaboratively send an overload of messages to the server whereby the server cannot accept any more requests, and the clients are frozen in time.  Ppl plant the bomb, sit on it and Ddos the server, when the server is able to respond, it sees the time is up and bomb is still planted so they win.

That‚Äôs fucking terrible cop out, if you don‚Äôt like a map disable it. Ubisoft is running out of ideas.

Gabe Newell from Vavle/steam has a good article on this.  More or less, there are so many new hacks all the time it's difficult to keep up with.  The hacks you're seeing won't be there for long though, but at least you know the old hacks get put to rest.  That's one of the reasons there are waves of hackers.  P.s. hackers are almost always just cheaters.  Most of them buy hacks, they don't make them.  I refuse to call them hackers as that implies they know how to hack the game and are at least clever.

But not that fast, he turned around and she was there

Buy a lottery ticket now..

Was already nerfed to shit

Welcome to reddit
---
watching this clip hurts because it happened to my teammates before.
---
I couldn't have said it any better
---
just got TK from a recruit because he didn't like my weapon skin, after that i got killed every round from the other teammates, to prevent me from killing him they said...
---
maybe it's anti-consumer but the content matters so little that I find it silly someone would be disgusted over it. you don't need these cosmetics to keep up in the game, they make 0 difference in actual gameplay. you already got a free pack, if you don't like the way they make you pay for more then just ignore it and move on
---
Or cartoony stars twirling around their heads.
---
I‚Äôve always thought it more logical to ban Monty...but apparently logic doesn‚Äôt apply in Siege. :D Or...my logical, thus yours, is flawed.
---
Little tip: 40 seconds of walking as intro isn't interesting for the viewer
---
It has like no HP how are they supposed to need it without removing it?
---
Amazing idea favela or theme park would be good maps for soft breaching
---
And at this moment he knew, HE FUCKED UP.
---
Yep. Dogshit game.
---
That's good idea
---
in the video he knifes 3 people, first the recruit, then the guy he looks at at 3 seconds, and then the cav. he knifed the guy after looking away from that far away, I pointed it out and he tried to play it off as an 'accident'
---
Or sexist, what happened to female terrorists?
---
Outback or Villa would be better
---
They're ranked map and you can destroy pretty much everything good to learn vertical play as well

Hello Joshuacwhong, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cajzwc/clash_bug_is_back_bois_happened_on_ps4_like/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Lions Vector
---
oh shit wait I'm wrong
---
Killcam already has a delay. Extending this delay just a would make physically impossible for other attackers to capitalise on that info.
---
Oh heck
---
I think he was trying to be your friend because he basically sees you bagging with the sledge out. It's the way people usually communicate/greet in games lol
---
Outstanding moves
---
I think I am gonna main castle just for that
---
Last time that happened to me, my team was intentionally deranking, was not a good experience.  
---
R6 in a nutshell.
---
Yeah iknow, but i wanted to use the chorus of the music to be all the kills of the clips. If you look closely, everything that isnt the chorus eventually leads up to a kill. Some clips are just spread out a bit because the song didnt start with the chorus :). But it was a bit of an experiment anyways but thanks noneoftheless!!
---
Why tf does this keep happening. What are a few people able to do even on a console to do this despite ubi (a massive game company) no doubt putting entire teams on this situation
---
Thank you
---
Please tell me you yelled Kobe
---
A frag grenade isn't a counter... It can't be used against anyone so we're gonna call that a tool more than anything.
---
Capitao doesn't delete anyone. He's good at pissing off miras and flushing people out of sneaky spots, but he's not better against clash than he is lesion. 
---
That shock slows you down for too long and the cool down is way too fast. If she gets you on your own chances are she's gonna keep shocking you until either the round ends or one of her team mates comes and picks you off. Thatcher is the only one that can have any kind of peace of mind against clash. 
---
I can take her out, but that's more because I've been playing siege a while so I know how the meta goes and I can put her in situations where she makes a mistake (sometimes). 
---
Zofia deletes everyone lol. But she's still not that effective against a good clash player. 
---
That electricity needs a nerf. She's just gonna get banned in ranked all the time until she gets something removed. Maybe the electricity only does damage and doesn't slow you down? Or the other way around. I just don't get why does both
---
Down someone and place a breach charge next to them
---
Kapikan
---
Spawn peek once, shame on you. Spawn peek twice, shame on me. Spawn peek ace, the enemy team is pretty brain dead.
---
Please stop hacking siege. We all know that is not possible.
---
True
---
yeah
---
No tears will be shed over this, dont worry.
---
There were deaths and there were 3 nukes and a 10 killstreak or more. i said that r6's 3v3 showdown was more like LMS from GTA.
---
Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I consider my current voltage stable, already did tons of benchmarks with no problems at all, everything in my system runs smoothly, I don't feel any kind of stutters anywhere and just to be sure I already tested R6 at completely stock settings. Even borrowed 2 sticks of 3000Mhz RAM from a friend but I concluded that Skylake don't benefit much from faster RAM.
---
Also my temps are all normal, both the GPU and CPU don't go above 70C¬∫ so I'm not getting any kind of thermal throttle. Also if you are curious, I wasn't very lucky on silicon lottery with my CPU so my current OC settings are 1.320V on my CPU at 4.4Ghz, RAM is stock 2133Mhz at 1.200V and my GPU is also stock.
---
Having said this, I'm blaming Ubisoft, they should really investigate further what is happening with R6's engine.
---
They could have asked or be mates though
---
What was the enemy team looking like?
---
 What makes no sense to me is why the deluxe doesn‚Äôt come with the vanilla operators. 
---
That‚Äôs the first thing you should do Is grind out those original operators like Pulse, Bandit, Jager, Mute, Rook on defense.
---
Sledge, Twitch , Thermite, Thatcher, IQ on attack.
---
Same here.   I always intent to tap fire, but usually unload and hope for a headshot.
---
Terrohunt at its finest
---
Maybe WALLBANG too.
---
How do you mean?
---
They would need to add an "Ela shotgun" situation for VarsityGaming then. The situation is only deep roaming and waiting for the enemy to push from there with, of course, Ela Shotgun
---
On top of "flashed" and other things.
---
Pretty much I mean I might of done something wrong but very minor
---
You should have kept playing ranked.
---
No because you should choose the sensitivity that you‚Äôre comfortable to &amp; if that default sensitivity is OK for you then you do not have to change it at all
---
Oh i get you, yea that would be cool
---
Shut up warden, stop flexing on us
---
If it works for you it should be fine but if you want to raise I'd just do it a a little at time so over time you build up to a higher sensitivity. I play on a pretty low one myself and it doesn't really bother me.
---
He went silent after I completely destroyed him lol
---
But some games ask if they can use your data in advertisements, they don‚Äôt care what they use asking as it makes the game look interesting
---
Shotguns with any further range would be straight aids for gameplay.
---
I know it is but you‚Äôd still be mad
---
Correct, but I chose trilogy because they were fighting together and each one of them tells a story. The variety of R6S players.
---
garage wars? nah thats where book club is held. window wars is where its at
---
Console be like
---
Console or PC?
---
I want team pings and player tag markers so when I wall bang I don't get accused of cheating.
---
Ok but right now they might as well not even be in the game, everything else is semi realistic, the shotguns should be too.
---
Yeah. Normally happens when you drop shot or rush with Ash.
---
That would be awesome lol
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how often this fails actually, I play clash a lot and people who rush me never bait a knife and never lay down to shoot my feet so doing a 180 switch then 180 shoot em dead is pretty easy doesn‚Äôt take a lot of skill to do honestly.
---
i see thx
---
I also hate DMRs, I‚Äôd rather use the M4 on single shot
---
Smurfing is not really a problem, people are the problem. There are countless people who smurf because they don‚Äôt want to soloQ in their high elo and lose ranks because of stupid teammates or to save their mates to get rekt every game.
---
Ranking up a smurf to 30 and then rank with it is perfectly fine imo, these 30 starting games can be 5 stacked with mains to kill the casual elo gap quickly.
---
I have a smurf in gold elo, so when I play with friends they don‚Äôt have to go through plat elo, the difference in skill between the lower gold elo (silver 1 to gold 3) and the higher gold elo (gold 2 to plat3) is so high that they get rekt every time we 5 stack ranked with my plat 1-2 main account.
---
Level 30 is ok, level 50 MIGHT be a compromise, but letting people play casual only until lvl75 is plain cruel.
---
What
---
Shotguns with real life range are too powerful for how the games designed
---
I personally use V:50 H:60 ADS:25 deadzone:10
---
Cool idea but should stay in casual obviously
---
That Zofia bending over after the video ends is just üëå
---
Its where real gamers play
---
No, you'll just have a rank according to your teams performance
---
Using that word will piss off the retards
---
No aim, I over and under correct too damn much
---
Nice
---
What do you mean by shake? Like tremor shake after playing or your aim is wobbly?
---
Yeah. Its fucking smurf city. They should just dump that mode
---
Yeah it would be nice, at least some defense against them
---
If I were a mod I would‚Äôve Bandit already
---
lOrD tAchUNkA eCKs deEE11!!!!!!! lawl :3
---
Mybe some devs r getting mrried
---
Seriously, why have they not added this yet?
---
That's unfortunate
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got a pro league player... 
---
Only time I played ranked was during skull rain and I got plat if I remember correctly. Never played ranked after that cuz I switched to pc and all my friends have ps4, also it was terrible because of all tryhards ruining the experience for everyone except themselves. I play to have fun, not deal with tryhards, same comps every game and cheaters
---
Hey no problem, if you update your drivers check this setting sometimes it like to default back
---
Stop telling random internet people and go see a doctor. We can't help you.
---
The best is when you see blood coming from them on the killcam but it still shows no damage.
---
If you cheat you can get banned even in casual but if you don't cheat in casual there shouldn't be any trouble.
---
Just don't cheat
---

*thicc*
---
It looks like a replay glitch.
---
Lol but really cool cosplay good job!
---
yes you can, Ubi bans by guilt by association. You played with a friend who is a hacker, if you didn't report him/kick him then you look guilty. Your account will be in a tossup under "boosted by a cheater". I'm not saying you'll get banned 100%, your friend will and there is a chance you will as well because of association.
---
PC
---
That's what I mean though, they've never done anything on Console
---
The purpose of the kill cam isn't for call outs...
---
Ah my halo brethren!
---
Your puny deagle cannot harm a god
---
If you mean it breaks the hit box it doesn‚Äôt. Rouge 9 has done the testing on it before they even implemented a fix for crouch spam.
---
I know what a ddos attack is. I did not know that people had developed the habit of intentionally misspelling it as "dossing".
---
I think OP misspelled Nerf
---
Running at someone and hipfire blasting until either they die or you die is not luck, that does not require skill, if they had better range they could be used with skill. 
---
Also I‚Äôve already literally stated word for word that being able to one shot people further away isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm talking about, they straight up don‚Äôt even seem to do any damage beyond 5 feet, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Really just play like normal. It is more competitive but it's not a whole lot different. If you take it to seriously you'll hate it and it won't be fun.
---
Great Pre-Fire.
---
I only meant those people who always ask at the end of the round, like it would change anything or Ubisoft would give them back 10 SR because the Lesion or Frost had just 5hp left, when they lost the Match.
---
I'd love to play on whatever server you are playing on.
---
Buck because his gadget is really useful.
---
When did Ubisoft confirmed this?
---
In my opinion rank difference does not impact matchmaking as match as someone who deliberately derank to boost other player since matchmaking should find a team with similar skill to your team. It may makes matchmaking less accurate, yes, but not easier. It's not that easy of a win when playing like this. In my experience makes it harder on my team than the other team. But that's my experience.
---
Why my pp smoll
---
There is only written Arabic but there isn‚Äôt an option for Arabic dialogue
---
thaaaaaaats not how the game works
---
You only hit 2 shots with suppressed deagle somehow cuz game broke
---
You could do it with flash grenades on yourself too

---
Now if we don't get a character named "Cookie" I'll be upset. Thanks.
---
Thought they fixed that
---
I disagree. I feel like you‚Äôre putting to much pressure on the roamers. There will be lots of rounds where they can‚Äôt get the kill but the wasted time was detrimental to the round. Just my opinion tho.
---
What is that red rank?
---
Use for now Valkyrie and Frost on defense, and Buck and Blackbeard on attack; and as you gain renown buy the standard SAS, FBI SWAT, GIGN, GSG9 and Spetsnaz operators, among whom I recommend Kapkan and Doc on defense, and Fuze (careful with team and hostage killing) and Sledge on attack.
---
Yes I‚Äôve heard about those but I wanted to do it with no resources and just basic knowledge of my head
---
Okay I think I added you
---
Can you see her phone from down stairs?
---
How do people's percents get this high haha. I have never had mine go higher than 20 percent before getting a drop.
---
Personally I think all of these changes lead towards players being more focused on their own frags and gameplay. I already find it silly that salty people ask how much HP the other has left after failing to kill them. 
---
I'd rather have siege move towards being the tactical, teamplay based game that it advertised itself as, as opposed to move closer to COD or CSGO with changes like this.
---
That's my 2 cents only tho :)
---
My friend played with this guy for 6 of his placement matches, got placed in gold 1, and then got off for the day. He logged in the next day and got this message, but he got demoted from gold 1 to gold 4 because the random he found had been cheating. Absolutely hysterical to me, not so much to him.
---
You missed a lot of those shots.
---
If you don‚Äôt pay attention then don‚Äôt say Ela is the thiccest
---
Well you used a pencil and crayons so you had some resources.
---
These are horrible!.
---
Hey, sorry I haven‚Äôt played that much in the last few days. 
---
In a rut at the moment and just want to like- ughhhh!!
---
This happens to me all the time. Unfortunately the only way I know how to fix it is to play more. To more you play, the more confident you will be, the more confident you are, the less nervous you get, and I think it‚Äôs the nerves. At least that‚Äôs what it is for me.
---
Yeah. Me and my friend were having a *blast* and me and the boiz found these white mask. It was until some wierdos with fancy ass hazmat suits came though.
---
Account name kriegstuffel.
---
Ubi please do what this guy says, we all need to see him play again, it‚Äôs imperative! /s
---
I use whatever fits best for the situation Im in. You are crying over an Acog buddy
---
Look, are Smurfs annoying. Sure, they can be but they are not the reason you are copper 3. It's easier to blame outside factors, I get that but you are copper 3 because you deserve to be that rank after the games you have played. Simple as that.
---
I had markers and a pencil I didn‚Äôt use no rulers because i wanted to test my drawing skills without rulers or anything else
---
Also I changed it to Portato.
---
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
Have fps drops happened on other games that are on the hdd or is it just siege?
---
Thats plat boi
---
He shot your hand
---
Zofia is good, dokk is god.

---
This is the sad part about the MMR readjustment. It is fair, but it isn't always satisfying.
---
*saved*
---
If you dont mind playing ranked as well. Im not saying playing a bunch of casual but about an even amount, ive got a couple friends that would be down. PSN is Crazy4242. Shoot me a request of your interested.
---
My only advice is just to play more, not even kidding...  
---
I picked up siege as my first PC shooter and it took me a LONG time to even get aim down, 3 years and 1.5k hours later I'm plat and have, what I'd call, above average aim and reaction times, granted only slightly above average, I'm no Beaulo.  
---
Other than that, a LOT of terrorist hunt and just try to go through faster each time you go through it, eventually it'll just be muscle memory to go "AAAHHHH" and still get a flick headshot somehow...
---
Yes I do agree siege needs km support. They are always tons of people with adapters on console so it‚Äôs sieges fault for not dealing with it similar to Fortnite
---
I have found it that people (myself included) will tend to only ask about HP because we want to check weather it is our own error, or a server side error, for example, shooting someone with a BOSG shotgun from point blank and seeing a blood spray, i will ask HP to check and makesure that a hit acctually registered. Happens all too much.
---
HOLD UP ONE FUCKING MINUTE
---
YES! Also for the kill cam, don‚Äôt show me can fucking interrogating me. Like yeah I think I know what happened there, show her downing me or something
---
it comes with the new ash pro league set
---
He shot your hand so its legit
---
Can you explain why?
---
Great job!  I got my first ace this weekend on Xbox and it felt great.  (didn't get great video of it unfortunately).  Even got my first hate message calling me a smurf!  
---
As a Lesion main, good job not pushing that position after you got stuck.  You'd be amazed how many people would just keep coming.  That Lesion was probably sitting there waiting for you, but you pushed a different direction.
---
Yea but mods would probably remove it if they could say it was "fucked" in the title.
---
Actually no, black ice was first an universal decal, then it became purchasable till the end of year 2. Now only it's in the packs. (since year 3)
---
It's not about time, because in time they will find another way to emulate the controller again, or use a controller as a bypass. It's really a more complex issue, because the changes they make to lock down how controllers behave will change the way 3rd party controllers work. It could even brake existing  first and third party hardware. There is more at play then just change the code to make these devices stop working.  *Building a better mouse trap merely makes smarter mice.* 
---
Really the solution is to just give all players access to keyboard and mouse. If everyone is cheating with K+M then no one is cheating with K+M. It would be the easiest way to deal with this crap, and allow companies to make some wicked peripherals to sell.  Give players choice on their preferred input method.  Hell ya could even make separate lobbies for K+M or Controller only.  With any K+M working and good alternatives by the big companies, very few would spend the money, or effort to get a controller emulating K+M to work. Especially when the real thing works better.
---
Hes not saying to fix it. Its a meme

Have you considered real life instead of video games?
---
Fooking laser sights to be exact
---
I wish i could switch to pc. Ive watched vids it looks so good and you can lean without aimimg
---
I watched that game and I don't think he was saying you were all boosting rather he was saying the Plat Two and the Gold Two were, plus he has no way of knowing how y'all queued, if it makes you feel any better he just lost a game
---
Grounded is a better word.
---
I‚Äôm a level 224 and shields are not trash, there is a reason why they‚Äôre always banned
---
Username and platform? I‚Äôd love to look up your god like stats
---
Yea but even with solid strats you can't do well if you can't aim worth a damn. If my aim was better I'd be confident that I'd be in high gold at least, but as it is I'm not sure where I stand (my friends don't want to play ranked). I have decent enough strats and game sense and a semi-reliable intuition, but my aim ranges from getting a one tap across the map through a flick to managing to outline the enemy's body even when they're standing still.
---
Use a friends account
---
others: good idea!
---
me an intellectual: free 6k renown
---
yeah i just watched and idk if you heard him say ‚Äòjasper‚Äô but that was me in chat saying that i wanted to talk to him about the game but he just responded saying he didn‚Äôt wanna talk about it so
---
he's not saying anything negative about it, he's just pointing it out
---
The thing is, this is actually pretty balanced matchmaking if that copper is a true copper. Since he is obviously a smurf this is bullshit.
---
r/im14andthisiswoooosh
---
That's smart
---
What happened to it
---
I wish it was easier to identify an enemy. Like how overwatch has red outlines around the bad guys or how your crosshairs used to be red over an enemy
---
Why u gotta be racist lol? You don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs under that helmet ;)
---
They fixed the jump to get onto the shark.
---
No because they accommodate vaulting and reloading respectively. It would be awkward if you wanted to vault but couldn‚Äôt lean a certain way as your vaulting leaving you vulnerable, and reload is self explanatory.
---
Where did you get the vest?
---
You are thermite.... and alone in a custom game....
---
Lol fair enough
---
You should be mad at Ubisoft for terrible matchmaking. The fact that Diamond's and Gold 2's can be in the same ranked game under any circumstance whether they're queued together or not is completely broken.
---
Well he eat way to learn is just to play and adapt to how you get killed and/or how you get kills, but outside of gameplay perhaps watch some YouTube videos on Siege recently.
---
To be fair he is a big streamer he can't really just sit down and talk with everyone who feels the need to talk to him
---
Ubisoft could of thought you were boosting so thats good for them
---
What map
---
It‚Äôs very generous
---
LMMMAAAOOOO
---
What I have said for dokk
---
I personally don't think so I picked more support as she can use enemy cams to help team and do make enemy's make noise give away there location on site or roaming
---
yeah i am definitely mad about that, my first message was something like ‚Äòclassic ubi matchmaking‚Äô but the most annoying part was how he didn‚Äôt blame anyone and said that was how it was meant to be
---
yep, I'm saying take Y4S1 stats and put that into your list. some of the ops you have listed as most useful are actually the least useful in terms of winning, and same goes for the bottom of your list where the "least" useful actual win the most.
---
The pistol design looks... interesting
---
What I said for nokk
---
Honestly i have not played much Nokk as i only played her in ts a bit the reason i put her in gadget counter is as you cannot see her on valk cams bulletproof cams or normal cams causing her to counter those gadgets fairly well.
---
Do non season pass holders still not have access ? Hot damn... That‚Äôs savage. I‚Äôve already gotten bored of N√∏kk, and Warden is poopoo doodoo.
---
yeah and i said ‚Äòfair enough‚Äô because i don‚Äôt blame him for not wanting to start maybe an argument also
---
This would be nice
---
So u can‚Äôt go on it anymore
---
I know. I cant really draw too well, so I put a base design and made it more T H I C C or more thin depending on how much room I need for the weapon skin
---
no
---
Play terrorist hunt. That‚Äôs how I learned maps.
---
The MVP kill cam for each round should display the health bar for the operator being replayed to see the damage dealt too
---
I solo queue
---
I see what you mean I could and my list is based of my experience from gold games
---
I don't think you're correct with those calculations, but in the linked comment I did my own (with a base damage of 12) and I accept that it is theoretically possible, but you need such a specific set of circumstances that to achieve it you'd have to sit there for an hour in a custom game trying to get it. What I'm disputing is the comment at the top of the chain that appears to be saying that it is a common occurrence
---
Not even remotely
---
Seems worst now than ever. I‚Äôve got quite the library full of clips of me dumping 10-15 rounds into someone‚Äôs head/chest and they still somehow can turn around and one shot me.
---
Yeah that seems likely. Any predictions?
---

Just play patiently, especially in gold. Hold angles and learn the maps. Since you‚Äôre new, work on these things and then once you get past that start working on more complicated things. There are also a ton of YouTube videos for players at your level.

8/10 maybe 8.5

ah heck, forgot that i cant post the first 24 hrs of making an account

I want it.

That was not your hand; it was the hand of god

I think the matchmaking should also use k/d and previous ranks also can't Ubi knows hows doing this and kept them with diamond/plat.
---
Try to find a squad so you can learn and grow together. It's difficult to mesh when everyone wants to do their own thing. You play with someone and you like them, add them and try to make a squad that can play.
---
Sure thing. But there are always support players who don‚Äôt make many kills. Even though he got kicked out for it I‚Äòd like to take joonas as an example on how you don‚Äôt need to aim really good to win a prize in PL (last season)
---
Why should I feel bad for an accidental TK? Clearly accidental and unlucky timing. If I didn't do it on purpose and I can't go back and change it, my conscience is clear.
---
Got so much funny kills on that shark boi
---
I'm not new to the game lol... I just can't deal with that many enemies combined with me being actual shit with pistols
---
Yeah, the soon to be changed deployable shield is back to
---
I have video proof I was in a match with cheaters and my MMR still hasn‚Äôt been adjusted :(
---
I also haven‚Äôt gotten my charms from last season now that I think about it...

Ya, unfortunately he was running with claymore. Actually killed a bomb boi with it.

Oh shit, try to post tomorrow i guess

I like it very cool and detailed imo only thing im wondering is why is the grzmot purple?
---
I just wish they tighten the spreads on pumps , very slightly tighten it on semi auto , tube fed shotguns but keep it the same on mag ones .
---
Shotguns honestly are amazing , however even if they're designed to be high risk high reward , they're really not very rewarding , if you hit but not kill on pumps , you're fucked immediately , if they were to tighten spreads , then I feel like they'll be very viable .
---
TBA
---
Only if the shield is in contact with the ground
---
Castle+kaid=forever
---
I have tweaked the settings a bit but nothign changed, additionally considering it worked fine before this shouldn't even be an issue
---
I thought it would have something to do with MadMax because his name is Max Goose but idk
---
?
---
he was trying to make a meme
---
She is occasionally useful for taking out a maestro or valk who is completely dependent on cams or is spawnpeeking with cams (like the valk spot in geisha on skyscraper)
---
Phew thank god haha
---
Relax buddy , was checking as I'm trying to help you .
---
So , are you on console or PC .
---
Sure, it's better to have kills. But to think you're better than someone else just because you have better stats is ridiculous. If you're making good calls and contributing to the team, you're doing well. I'd rather be that person than that type of guy in this post.
---
Was this copper ranked lmao
---
Great , so you can aim easier bad fire faster st least .
---
What exactly is your problem with pistols if it's possible to know .
---
Thanks for the heads up i may now ready my credit card
---
golds too
---
Ok thanks
---
GT? Like I mentioned I'm not the best but have a mic
---
Weird, tbh. Plus unnecessary.

That's pretty harsh. even if you get past the monty, the Trax will still give away your position. Easy spray.
---
Ah yes, the weekly server degradation thing. Right on time.
---
Offsetbuffalo30, I'm decent. Not terrible, not amazing. Just looking for more people to play with
---
Ubi wrote on start of the siege "Use of M&amp;K on console's is considred as cheating " and they will do something about that,than controlers with M1&amp;M2 come and its imposible for them to find out if he/she is using "Pro controller" or M&amp;K
---
they made operators like lion and finka, anything is possible with ubisoft
---
What's you GT as well
---
NA or EU?
---
Then whydafaq are csgo people screaming about this? They for exactly what they were playing earlier, but with more variety.
---
Silly kids.
---
When a copper four plays a custom game
---
I dont understand why dont we give him an lmg like maestro
---
I agree 100%
---
NA
---
Console?
---
Yeah, it's not that simple.
---
The adapter people buy will disguise the M&amp;K as a controller, there is NOTHING they can do to fix it.
---
This problem is hardware related because Ubisoft doesn't allow legitimate use of a M&amp;K on console.
---
Does blocking them work like that?
---
Because csgo is the most toxic community known to mankind

Any way to prevent this?
---
This is conflicting for me. Bc my group can and does get beat pretty badly some games in Casual, other times we play really well. 
---
Likewise I solo-queued Ranked for a few matches this weekend, and consistently scored high on my team. I‚Äôm unranked so that may have something to do with it.
---
And here I am , not getting an alpha pack with 70%. Feels bad man
---
Hear hear!
---
Hahha i wish that was me.
---
This is toxic
---
Not that I saw, I reported to R6Fix. Hopefully a patch soon.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since wind bastion this season I got gold 1, sadly no plat yet.
---
The lowest I‚Äôve gotten is 12 or 14 percent I think, so yeah, I‚Äôm not very lucky, haha.
---
Your gaming chair just isn't good enough

No they're not your only putting emphasis on a conversation they had in Ghost Recon wildlands which was about two friends going and having drinks. Get that OverWatch rainbow flag Community bullshit out of here.

Let's hope goobysoft fix it quickly
---
Don't solo queue in ranked unless you don't want to have fun. You'll be tk'd and the randoms will throw. Especially in low ranks.
---
They are shy :)
---
It would be nice but you can just play ranked.
---
Looks good, is there one without the R6 logo?

The game would come 16 seconds late for him :D

I call this problem the ‚ÄúUbisoft makes great IDEAS for video games but is shit at actually making them and should probably just sell the ideas to better developer studios‚Äù
---
I see, nupid.stigger is his name. Idk why he would choose that kind of name but meh, the moderators should still be professional at all times
---
Actually, a vocal is: of, relating to, or uttered with the voice. The word you were looking for is a vowel. But your statement is not correct and it is in fact an ‚Äúa‚Äù that should go before ‚Äú1v1‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt matter what letter that the word ‚Äúone‚Äù starts with but, according to writingexplained.org (and common sense), it is the sound that the word starts with; which in this case is a ‚Äúwuh‚Äù sound so, in this case, it is indeed *not* ‚Äúan 1v1‚Äù.
---
Yeah seem like a good Idea
---
Update Nvidia drivers through geforce experience. Sorted it for me
---
Dont rush, peak your corners, learn your maps, utilize your gear.
---
Yeah would have been plat if Ubi didn't fuck me before that
---
 Nah
---
I was disappointed the new operators didn't have new loadouts.
---
Bastards, thanks bud
---
Its not Ubisoft though. Its getting votekicked, tk'd, and trash talked for no reason
---
Happens pretty much every other game as well!
---
Horse must be hilarius with Black Eyes :D
---
Well, unless someone gives you a stroke of luck and actually gives you a code, a mod will most likely take this down at some point or tell you the same as I have, so keep it up if you want, but it‚Äôs unlikely someone will give you anything or will tell you the same thing I‚Äôve said.
---
All competitive online games are toxic. Just report, ignore  and move on.
---
If you can't do that play a single player game.
---
Assault rifles according to MWdictionary have the option of fully automatic or semi automatic fire which no rifle being legally sold in the US has. That being said the term is at best greatly misused.
---
Also run through your situations to better your aiming and reaction timing.
---
People should go straight into ranked. Casual is a shitshow.
---
The mods were. In this screen shot the mod was saying that his name meant something else and you have to be expressly specific with that stuff

Damn i never noticed well i haven‚Äôt play in a while now probably gonna play again ü•≥
---
Siege has told Xbox and PlayStation that they don‚Äôt want it to be keyboard compatible and there‚Äôs no way for them to tell if someone is playing on keyboard and mouse if they are using an adapter in smite it‚Äôs keyboard compatible and it separates those people into a different queue
---
Do yourself a favor bud, search up one tap vids and you'll see some are how you explain and some are like how mine went in the same person's vid since they do montages.
---
Just dont worry about your rank play cas untill your winning most rounds then move to ranked play, play, and play untill you start winning most of those games and in the next season youll have a much easier time ranking up. Wait 2-4 weeks to start playing ranked so that all the plats and diamonds are where they should be
---
I mean, this is my personal opinion, if you have other ideas please tell me c:
---
Would be awesome, but all of those numbers are WAY too high.
---
Is there perhaps a sub for that kinda stuff? For research purposes, of course
---
On mobile top right of screen the three dots, then select user flair.
---
Would be cool, but unfortunately would greatly promote boosting which is already a big problem.
---
UwU
---
It finally gives you an incentive to rank up
---
Lol copper top fragging
---
Oo la la, now I do like this idea.
---
Needs some refinement, but this isn‚Äôt unreasonably.
---
But to your point it isn‚Äôt even consistent. I play with a four-five stack team. And we only play together. But 3/5 of us got a rank adjustment. For playing against or with a hacker. And we can‚Äôt figure out why some of us got the adjustment and others didn‚Äôt. And we can‚Äôt figure out what game it was.
---
Lol 14 year old confirmed, grow up. You must be stupid as fuck to not think this would eventually happen.
---
I do like the idea of damage done, but we don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúthey have been flashed, it‚Äôs cool they killed you legit‚Äù 
---
If you really wanted it, a small icon showing a status effect would be sufficient and clean.
---
I must show all of you my sincerest gratitude for baby raging and giving me great content for a youtube video. The video will be edited and posted here soon so please check it out  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

Nah everybody sweats in ether mode

Ok I‚Äôll try that thanks man!
---
&gt; win in a 1v1..
---
its clutch
---
I see what you mean, Ye your right, the moderators we‚Äôre stating what his name really meant, and wasn‚Äôt calling him that.
---
You won wtf they‚Äôre all boosted 100%
---
And I‚Äôm stuck in silver and I‚Äôve played sine the beginning of operation health
---
one word: boosting
---
That is very frustrating on its own. I‚Äôve gone through it as well. It‚Äôs not enjoyable when going to rank and every game there‚Äôs a crash, Ddos, and glitching. It‚Äôs frustrating and not enjoyable to play at all. Casual it‚Äôs the constant rage quitting it‚Äôs terrible. And Ubisoft just come with the same old‚Äù we are sorry for the inconvenience and we‚Äôre working on it‚Äù they could t and still can‚Äôt even fix the IQ or Clash glitch. But they made over A BILLION dollars off this game and the community and we get garbage. This is the worst it‚Äôs ever been and people are seeing hay and now beginning to boycott it like myself and my entire squad of 8.
---
If everyone is sweating then you might as well play for a rank and get a full game.
---

Hello Booqifes, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/capx5w/is_this_a_new_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Thats not even the logic i used lmao did i say spray? Nah, if you shoot once or twice through something you can't see and get a kill on the first couple thats gonna be a one tap. Look up one tap montages and you'll see how some are just off the first bullet and some are the 3rd but its always being fired in a semi auto style.
---
CLUTCHING AND ACE IN A 1V1
---
I uses to play a hell of a lot of t-hunt. Also, if you play on console like I do, you should change your shoot button to R1 (RB) instead of the triggers for a better reaction time. (Also change the ads button respectively.) I felt that this way I had better recoil control for some reason, and that season I got to plat.
---
And im out here being high gold every season, currently have a 1.6 kd. Congrats brother, now aim for plat 2.
---
Perhaps
---
A soul for a soul
---
Yeah fuck! Just type some characters and fix the entire game since it‚Äôs so easy! Jeez man, why didn‚Äôt ubi think of that???????
---
This.. I am running in Silver this season, and I am rarely killed by Blitz. People don't realize how short his flash range is, and there are so many places he can easily be shot (upper right shoulder, legs, etc.).
---
I run Blitz a fair amount and it is almost solely for the intimidation factor. Anyone who stands their ground has around even odds of killing me.
---
Compare that to Monty. An aggressive player can wait until you switch focus to team mates and go for kill. At worst with competent team mates it is a trade, at best a free kill. A passive player can give all the info in the world, then smoke plant, then guard it. 
---
Monty is so much scarier, Blitz is just a psych-out from the era when he was crazy OP.
---
I can't see R6 credits and I could see maybe 1 or two alpha packs per rank but other then that I don't see a problem maybe lower the amount of renown you get per rank and we would have a viable option to bring to ubi
---
Ok What do you think select fire means?
---
Also, I know that weapons that are considered assault rifles aren‚Äôt sold legally in US (with some exceptions). I never said otherwise
---
This is on PC you fuckwit
---
Cringe
---
This system can‚Äôt be fair.
---
They need to pay more for best cheer of BattlEye
---
Or do anything else about 2-factor system or just IP ban even if they used VPN to avoid for. Like do something
---
You deserve all the awards
---
üëç
---
Thanks!
---
You may be self proclaimed, but you walk in the footsteps of many many many other players that have done this before you.
---
No, the points being removed means he won against or with a cheater, when ubisoft bans a cheater they essentially delete all the matches that cheater played and reset the change in mmr those matches caused
---
What about when I as say a Diamond just play along side you in a bronze account and your bronze account to plat or diamond?

It's  Yeet Yeet now you ignorant old timer. Lol

Alpha pack glitch, restart your game and it will be available
---
How sweet
---
Except people don't give a shit about rank. Even in top of gold and low platinum people still quitting and team killing all day
---
holo is best 1x boi. too big for shotties but it‚Äôs a wonder on the T-5
---
I agree, it could be exploited but given how the bans will increase to the point where accounts will be getting banned for a week after four offences, I can't see many people having so many accounts that they're willing to nuke it for a week just to save their MMR.
---
&gt;Ranked isn't so important that they should be handing out big bans just for leaving/disconnecting.
---
It's literally the biggest attraction to the game. To play for rank. Playing in casual offers nothing because no one takes it seriously.
---
Been playing since beta. Never got bored and never will.
---
You should do a strip of some R6 characters in the Cyanide and Happiness style.

Just an example to show people, nothing serious
---
gridlock still THICCC tho
---
I've been having this issue for some time now as well. Just wait for the timer to autoleave runs out and it forces you back to the lobby. That should fix it.
---
if they nerf the shotgun, i will need compensation
---
Ahh, Tuesdays.
---
Who isn't an ex-cod player?
---
It's Villa, walk-in closet. You can get into that spot there by proning only though
---
I started in the beta 
---
The launch etc of the game was a nightmare. I remember the struggle to get even a game some evenings. 
---
I left rainbow for 2 years and have recently come back. The game is in the best state gameplay wise since launch and is actually fantastic
---
The only thing I found is siege has created one of the worst communities online that I've seen.
---
Boosters can use smurf accounts to get around boosting rules.
---
Use 2nd account, get past the rule set you used to "stop" boosters.
---
&gt; Abandonment already comes with a matchmaking penalty.
---
It does and it's not harsh enough. People willingly take the bans because they're so soft.
---
&gt; If leaving a game saves your team half the MMR lost, people will having a fall guy leave ranked games as soon as they're about to lose to save their ranks. It would be exploited to death. 
---
I tried it yesterday, so mad they took it away.
---
That has nothing to do with the gun, I know the suction cups make noise.
---
He buys a bronze smurf to play with his bronze friend
---
and then boosts them both to diamond
---
Ok thx. Nice maestro camp then. Have to try it out
---
its a cheapo mouse but i have had zero problems with it and i don't have any software for it should i download some?
---
Aim for the shins.
---
Numbers are too high. Lower them, personally the R6 credits. ;)
---
I think he‚Äôs basically just talking about smurfing. Which is an entirely separate issue that wouldn‚Äôt really play into boosting. Boosting is free, you have to buy another copy of the game on another account to smurf.
---
Take initiative, if you hate them, create a R6Highlights subreddit.
---
Thank you guys !
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this is just because I play on East Coast, but I‚Äôve noticed soooo many cheaters this season. Is it the same on the West coast and in Central?
---
Divide the numbers by 20 and it will be considerable
---
Cool
---
In gold elo and went against a diamond and 4 coppers last night. One of his teammates disconnected and we managed to clutch a victory out. There's a reason they don't play with other diamonds.
---
Yes then
---
I think this would be better if this was in hours played per season rather than the rank.

That would actually be a perfect idea, except... the operator would still be overpowered. Not Everyone in ranked uses a mic, which would make it basically sudden death. Typing in chat would take too long as you would have to stand completely still. Also, for people in solo queue, it would be a nightmare. However, with some balancing, this operator could be pretty good.
---
NOOO STOP NERFING EVERYTHING THAT'S FUN IN THIS GAME &gt;:(
---
I'd lower the renown a tad bit. But that's just me
---
That makes some sense but it also stops people at different skill levels from playing with their friends. I have a few friends who are much lower rank then i am that i play with in rank occasionally just to play the game with them and avoid casual which kinda sucks you can't just say you can't play with you buddy because he sucks and you don't.
---
Free smurfs are the reason r6 is at 40 million players. A squad of 5 could easily have 25 accounts between them by now, if not they're very easy to set up. Yes it's hard to always get a 5 stack, but leavers can't be that common when you're not with your friends?
---
Through friends. They just told me I should get it , and glad I was that I did. I bought it about right when it came out, just a few days after. It was the best. Unfortunately though, none of my friends play it anymore, but I do still enjoy the game.
---
I admit that I smurf too. I dont want to sweat every game in plat1 so I have an second gold2 smurf which I use to play ranked relaxed. But the range solution does make it harder for boosting to diamond with coppers.
---
Rook*
---
I like that idea and I upvoted it but at the cost it is no longer 69
---
r/PCE?
---
Fact: this will only further encourage cheating and boosting.
---
You're pretty much screwed in there against any person who drones you. You simply can't get out without having to prone :)
---
I never had teammates. &amp; Gold 4
---
You can‚Äôt attack vertically
---
You can‚Äôt spawn peek
---
The speakers have to be shot every round to make them quiet
---
Everything‚Äôs metal so everyone can be heard
---
Lmk if you think that movement speed is fair while also being shot with ash not being is view.
---
Ok, thz
---
i hate boosters like everyone but this is a bad idea. preventing people to play with their friends. a much better coise would be to make the highest rank in party determine the party rank, dont equalize.
---
clash is the most underrated operator in the game
---
Well that is what ubi has to decide. To stop 95% of the boosting or letting that 5% way out of bound players play together.
---
Got stoned and bought it on a whim. April 2018, now 450 hours later
---
High gold and Low-Plat is the hardest part of Siege. The reason is because you could have the skill to be Diamond, but the people you play with and go up against can be REALLY bad or REALLY good. It's all a gamble. I have friends that have over 1000sr difference and I guess I'd just have to play casual with them.
---
That‚Äôs no long nice can we get an F
---
All male operators are overweight?
---
Have you forgotten about Gridlock? Her BMI says she‚Äôs obese and it sure isn‚Äôt muscle like Valk
---
He's probably just friends with one of them
---
Nice job! This is the season where I got to plat for the first time as well! But now I‚Äôm fucking gold 2 so I‚Äôm gonna go derank to copper
---
I will never understand reddit lol I posted a very similar thing and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs sitting at 0 upvotes. Beside that though I really feel if there is a cheater that everyone on the team should not be affected like this. It‚Äôs happened to me 3 times in the last month and really fucking aggravating cuz I can‚Äôt even tell when someone is cheating due to no one saying anything about it.
---
How was the nokk that stupid to walk into electrified barbed wire, what level was she
---
that is why siege need to stop determine MMR entirely on win/loss. personal skill should be concidered.
---
I think that makes it a tad too easy... There's a steep learning curve to this game, but that's part of the reason it's so rewarding.
---
B default if I'm not mistaken, same as Zofia's launcher

ROOK is the thiccest
---
I've seen over 20 posts about this in the past week. All I can say is they need to add a minimum mmr range within a squad. (100 for lower ranks and 500 once you reach platinum).
---
could you care telling us what the mouse is.
---
Thank you!
---
Those ecg pads are placed weirdly but yeah, I joined in Velvet shell, one of the best season
---
This is bullshit honestly, you won against a cheater, good, now we take your MMR
---
Instead of destroying exotermic charges or x kairos pellets he destroys this man whole carreer
---
Well thats also an solution. But if im playing on my main plat1 with say my silver mates they go against high plats/diamonds abd thats also something you dont want

My thoughts exactly üò™

u keep downvoting but dont explain. wasnt this play a big tryhard? did i misspelled something? aaaa tryhard is something offensive? in brazil people say it when someone its just trying to win real bad
---
Yes, very good
---
I'd still smash gridlock though
---
That's not good
---
How about insteadof renown, you get a moderate amount of r6 credits so at a certain rank you can buy a character or cool skin.
---
Pretty fucken good photoshopping there m8
---
Just play casual. What makes casual suck?
---
Good idea but I don‚Äôt think most platinum and diamonds would need renown. Same as some other people have said Ubisoft wants you to buy R6 not earn it free
---
Smurfs on console are free. I already know people with multiple Smurfs they don't use for lack of  incentive. Just remove R6 credits from the rewards. TBH not even arguing about Ubisoft would never give us the option to play and earn paid currency
---
that's so bad.... what type of plant were you smoking?
---
Oh, its perfect thank you so much!
---
Did you saw the Delorian from Back to the Future? In new game mode. In tunnels.
---
So make it only available to people who purchased the full game?  I don't see how this would be that difficult to implement.
---
That's fine as long as you admit and accept that you're a cheater lol
---
1. They can play with other South Africans all on euw eun with equally shit ping. I don't want to play with those outside of UK, I said before I don't mind bad wait times and will happily queue the extra 2-3 mins to find other UK players with UK only filters. Will also aid communication.... eg I don't need 3 french players in my team, we can't communicate. 
---
2. I played before and I've played after that patch, it was 2017.. I've read the link before and I've read it again. Still problems in the game with ping. The south Africans apologised in both games for having bad ping and stated "it's not my fault I can't just queue with south Africans."
---
3. That's my option to make surely? Let me tick boxes. I'd happily queue with Ireland Scotland etc. Still reasonable connections. 
---
4. That's fine. Cater to your audience, if you have 100k south Africans filling out a petition for African servers, if it's profitable deploy servers there, otherwise don't cause a detriment to your current playerbase by providing tickboxes. 
---
Also, how come a very large amount of US players play on EU servers? Surely their high ping would be a disadvantage to them if the article is true? Instead it seems the opposite. 
---
The solutions I'm mentioning are available in MANY games and are not alien. The only teams we get absolutely pub stomped by are teams with high ping. High ping and pubstomping goes hand in hand. Seems iffy.
---
Smurfs on console are free... Like... Herro?
---
Am I the only person bothered by how the bandit looks everywhere except the only spot his teammate could have been killed from
---
Lets not forget the DDOSing on all platforms! Easily avoided by just introducing basic DDoS protection on the servers
---
Blitz is a free kill most of the times with his inconsistent flashing and as seen here his hit boxes in other words git gud
---
I have like 70 hours in jager and I just do this for fun
---
On any map where it is THAT defender sided, you should be able to just as easily hold it for the next 3 after you switch.
---
An Alpha pack each time you reach a new rank for the first time would be cool. Ngl.
---
So thatcher with a  shield as a defender
---
Disagree completely.  Yes, there will always be bugs and glitches.  But the recent state of Siege is unacceptable.
---
This feels like 3 problems all coming together to cause trouble at once--two of which are of Ubi's own making.  First, Siege is a complex game with a lot of code.  There is no getting around that and more code means more chances for things to interact unexpectedly.  That's not really Ubi's fault, just a result of having a game with so much going on.  However, it feels like Ubi is cheaping out on QoL.  Better QC/testing would catch more bugs.  More people devoted to fixing bugs would shorten the time it takes to fix them and allow more to be fixed.  A different engine might (likely imo) have allowed the code to be written more simply and achieve the same effects.  Running their own servers would allow Ubi to respond to problems rather than having to apply pressure on a third-party to deliver.  But all that takes money.  I think Siege is very profitable, but most of the budget seems to allocated to new content and relative little to QoL.  That's understandable since the link between new content and profits is much more obvious than the one between QoL and profits, but this is exactly what should be expected to happen if a company isn't spending enough on QoL.  Third, I suspect the underlying code in Siege is particularly kludgy.  There are many ways to get something to happen, some better than others.  It feels like Siege has a lot of these less ideal, more complex ways of getting things to happen (perhaps in part because it uses an engine that isn't really optimized for this).  That in turn means the program is larger and there are more ways for things to interact unexpectedly.
---
I will never leave a ranked match no matter how bad my team.
---
Let the execs figure it out and save yourself the time.
---
Maybe turn down the rewards because 10k for being in the lowest category is a bit to much and change the r6 coins also. The alpha packs are in a good spot though
---
I just noticed that the pistol Doc locks in the op video is a P12 (Or USP Tactical for gun nerds)
---
She has a new broken glitch so she should just be completely removed no revamp
---
Make it available to only people with the purchased game.  Win-win.  R6 credits aside, the argument that we shouldn't reward higher ranks because that will make people abuse the system is a terrible one... that just means they need to fix their system.
---
She hit a frost may and died the the electrified barbed wire, quick thinking on bandits parts dumb move by N√∏kks part
---
FALSE, while I will admit that on console the siege community is disgusting and most of those players are the scum of the earth, however games like overwatch, LoL, and CS:GO are WAY WORSE. I've heard death threats on cs:go, or players using racial slurs on LoL, honestly as bad as the siege community is there could be worse.
---
Is this what Japanese people see whenever they boot up the game?
---
People cheat in games to increase their digital number (rank). Imagine how many people will cheat if they win actual money by doing so. 
---
If Ubisoft does something similar to that just with lower numbers you pretty much get money for free. That‚Äôs a big reason for even more people to cheat or get boosted.
---
I know Overwatch gives you competitive points to unlock gold weapons. CS:GO gives you nothing. Siege gives you a rank charm. Apex Legends gives you nothing. I don't think PUBG gives you anything. So maybe I'm missing the games that do...I'm curious to know which ones you know of that have a large player base, that reward you for ranking up.
---
4 years and still waiting. TBH this isn't worth arguing about Ubisofts cheap ass would never allow you to earn paid currency in game anyways üòÇ
---
Don‚Äôt care what u call me imma keep winning u keep complaining for a fix that will never happen
---
Yeah sometimes I know I clipped someone‚Äôs  head and game wouldn‚Äôt register
---
I agree that this would encourage account shenanigans, but I disagree with your first issue. Offering a reward for skill is perfectly reasonable and would encourage better play among everyone - trolling in ranked will negatively impact win/loss so this would encourage people to behave themselves.
---
Ahh, those were the days , I started 12/26/15, you?
---
The alpha pack part could work, but the other two should be less. Just seems pretty high for such low ranks.
---
when did Capitao get maverick's blowtorch?
---
At a minimum give us a pack each time we level up!
---
I agree. 5k renown is pretty much worthless to buy any good skin in the game. 10k at diamond is nice and then lower each by a thousand. Maybe even give like 250 more per sub rank like gold one gets more than people in gold 4. 5k for diamond isnt at all a selling point to get more people playing and trying to reach that high rank. Include those alpha packs and bam. Sounds like a cool reward system that rewards you for reaching the rank you wanted
---
not saying she's op, I just think there might be a better way to utilize her as an operator.
---
Wish this happened for ddos too

Hello Cyclone_96, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/caryqa/another_day_another_game_breaking_glitch_they_did/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Okay, obviously I don't play console so you being vague obviously isn't making your point any easier to understand.  Are all accounts free?  Can you just make one for free without buying the game?  Are there multiple accounts attached to your account?  However the fuck it works, make it so you have to A) Purchase the game or if you are allowed multiple accounts on one account then let the rewards only go to one of your accounts.
---
However it works, it sounds like console has a terrible system going on in the first place that needs looked into more than what we are talking about right now.
---
There‚Äôs a Rogue 9 video all about this stuff: https://youtu.be/UWK41w9VpOA
---
Console coppers are the scourge of society
---
For me it happens before i play Showdown mode.
---
https://youtu.be/UWK41w9VpOA
---
I think the alpha packs would be great, but not everything else.
---
I disagree with r6 credits, just give a flat 100 across the board. Otherwise toxicity will rise. Even if the ranking is individual, these incentives will make people blame their team.
---
Coastline has some very good spots with soft breachable walls.
---
&gt; You need to realize that giving players a shit ton of renown is litterally going to have players boost to dimond
---
You act like boosting to diamond is some incredibly easy thing that people aren't going to do with or without that 25k renown.
---
The goal here is to have people move from casual to ranked because of the rewards, yeah?
---
Let's say we use your method- people are going to play until they place, then stop. Because 1k extra renown is absolutely *not* worth bothering to rank up. It's probably not even worth fucking placing considering you're going to be either silver or gold. So that's 2-3k renown. That'll get almost zero new people playing ranked, and it'll retain even fewer.
---
this is god tier
---
Ubi can penalize us for accidentally playing with a cheater but they can't figure out chat lag and don't care about smurfs, fuck you Ubi.
---
i can never sit in that spot cuz everytime i do my character does the ledge fall thing and is constantly making noise
---
What was the thing they removed? Were you used to be able to jump on it?
---
Welp,for all the alpha packs that I opened are always common....it sucks
---
t-bagging is considered bad luck, just like what happened to that poor schmuck in the clip.
---
Yes, me and my friend were talking about this today since my one on my friends just got the game
---
For memes Russian badger tuxbird Ap1 yumi smi77ty
---
I could agree with 10k too 15k that's reasonable, honestly from a business aspect Ubisoft would be shooting themselves in the foot if they gave players enough for an op in one go.
---
Try fallencurse_x haha thats my ubisoft name

Just do it how Rocket League does it with like a 10 games in that rank and it‚Äôs locked in. But this is still a terrible idea, it‚Äôs just a skill approximation in the first place it shouldn‚Äôt even give out rewards for your rank in the first place.
---
There is a discord community. Check games you play on the discord app, it might show you the link.
---
That would just make hacking/exploiting and boosting way more tempting than it already is.
---
Right our holding an angle and lay on the trigger and like half of your hundred round mag is gone and some idiot runs in front of you trying to take the kill.
---
Hanging on to dear life.
---
You are on a completely different track from what the OP is proposing because we already get rank charms that are "unique and actually make a limited appearance and shows prestige more than you getting currency to buy skins\[charms\] a copper 4 can get." 
---
You do realize the rank reward system (Siege, Rocket League, LoL) you are talking about exists literally counter to your argument regarding "\[y\]ou can‚Äôt discourage rewards because it ‚Äòpromotes‚Äô boosting. There's a reason why every game only gives you seasonal rank cosmetics! You are arguing with yourself lol
---
You‚Äôre right there lol, people usually just call her a fatass and be done with it. Not that it really matters though, given that it‚Äôs a video game and whatnot
---
pc
---
It's like you think just because of YouTuber said it's a one tap that means the one tap you do realize idiots can post videos on YouTube as well right? Using online videos isn't a valid argument
---
thats the point, i don't play with usually. That game is fun because I dn't really need friends to play with in casual.
---
Someone did this in a g4 game. I shot a door at an angle where there could be no ads on a wall and well.... I destroyed an ads
---
whoops
---
No I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm arguing with you but it‚Äôs clearly over your head.
---
 i game I chatted i really wanted an ace when there was one opponent so they said sure so I proceeded to shoot every single one of them then clutch the round
---
Needs an acoq.

Was about to ask if this was console lol

Right now, its just,

Because I‚Äôm hateful. Also, as part of the community I didn‚Äôt ask for this back.
---
Lol got to plat one by abusing the shitty system, I matchmade 5 stack but 2 of my friends were bronze and 2 of them were gold/silver, *ez clap 10 win streak*
---
At that point just play ranked, also I agree with your idea
---
Nothing would change.
---
For a second i thought this is real
---
I want this! RIGHT NOW!
---
Xbox LFG already riidled with people looking for bronze placement players, this would make it way worse with that high value renknown.
---
Unlimited timer would be nice too. Maybe only for local games so we can‚Äôt stress ubi‚Äôs servers infinitely
---
people hate him cause he is strong against anyone who's alone, usually roamers, unless you get the jump on a blitz you have little chance by yourself
---
So once you get to diamond, there are no more rewards? If you place in gold, you instantly get all rewards for previous levels?
---
No ragrets.

welcome to r/rainbow6, where fan art has to be lewd to get upvotes

That is some real bronze game play lol
---
Go plug your controller into a computer a find out my real rank.
---
Ranked isn't intended to  be a reward system.   
---
MATCH MAKER RATING.....meant for players to be matched against people of the same skill level for more fair games. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
The friendly fire system has helped me once or twice, in casual. It discourages the continuous TK. Of course, if you are in the same team with 3 trolls, you might end dying every round. Mitigation doesn't mean trolling behaviors being erradicated. Personally, I think it was a step in the good direction. I play with friends and obviously I forgive them when mistakes are made, and TKs are going to still be done on the game and that's fair and realistic. So in that point I beg to differ. HOWEVER, the censoring of words is something that I agree with you 110%. Specially because you can still use VOIP and call them nig...s and whatever you want! Most of the hate and toxic behaviors happen against team mates and not enemies! 
---
Give them the option to mute either voice, chat, or both. That's all you need. Someone is being toxic? Mute them.
---
Someone says NI##A? Ok, censor the word! Make it appear as \*\*\*\*\* and that's all! Really, there's no need to ban people because like you say, mistakes could be made and being banned due to saying "paki" or words in other language that you have no idea what they mean is extremely infuriating...
---
haha DAE female operator? LOL, NUT!!!!
---
Season pass and diamond skin would lose all their value. Plus they would make much less money off cosmetics in general. Doubt they will do this.
---
I sent them the video though. I suppose it wasn‚Äôt convincing enough.
---
Why not?
---
Updoot this post for visibility
---
This is a good solution. Upon placement you get alpha packs equal to the number of medals you are in the ranking. For instance, if you place gold you'll get 3 right out of the gate then an additional one for each medal up.
---
Concept is great but maybe half the renown and 1-6 alpha packs sounds more realistic
---
What account??? On the one I'm currently using I got no more than 5 minutes of bb
---
I never said anything about ‚Äúnot‚Äù.
---
You're so hurt that theres not more people agreeing with you, to the point that you're keeping track of where this goes. You realize i only mention it because many youtubers who have a lot of attention from playing this game post the same thing. I get this is the only interaction you probably get so i wont judge you too harshly for being so upset over a video game buddy.
---
It is extremely hard to detect though, the adapter translates mnk inputs to controller so it's tricked into thinking it's a controller. Also I notice that many people just instantly call mnk when someone hits a good shot(I get a mnk message like every week and I play on 23 27 sens), I play on both and think I've only seen 2 mnk users that I can confidently identify, yes it's definitely a problem but I think people use it as a crutch excuse as to why they're losing gun fights. (Plat 1 on PC, plat 2 on Xbox)
---
That would be fair.
---
You read what I wrote right? There's a reason games don't give you 50k renown for reaching Gold, or 20 Apex Legend Packs for being an Apex Predator, or 10 Overwatch Loot Boxes for hitting Platinum. You're missing both the proposal and the context of the discussion. Because: boosting.
---
It is a good idea, it makes it as though you never played with the cheater
---

Ur on crack if u think I Ubi are giving free r6 credits

Ubi wouldn't do that, would mean a lot more people farming them and a lot less buying the whole set at every event.

Looks good to me
