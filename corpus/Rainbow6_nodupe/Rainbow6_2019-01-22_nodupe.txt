Me and a couple of friends were playing bomb with a random mont. He was in a door when he stepped on a lesion. He backed out because of it and the guy planting got rekt. We lost, it was a sad day.

Imagine crying to reddit that you got banned for cheating

You can mute players in the scoreboard

He needs to stop cheating too then.

Although a huge part of me wants to make fun of you for thinking you’re so relevant for being G1+, I have to agree that skyscraper needs to go. Not a fun experience for competitive play at all. 
---
No it looks exactly like border. It has the car and...that’s it 
---
If they know the map they would know commanders office is east.  All situational and depends on who you are talking to.
---
Just try to avoid “Over there”
---
They shouldn't.  They say it in an attempt to take ownership of it and turn it into something it's not.  But, as you are not of the race it was used to demean, you should never say it.  And, from your other statements, you would be one to use it for it's original racist meaning.  White nationalists and nazi's think their time has come again because of republicans.  It has not.

I believe it and it's happen to me before as well. Not exactly like this but it isn't hard to believe that people are toxic in siege. Were you around when people were getting banned for toxicity and the devs were pulling out the chat logs?

But he had impacts for that reason, why waste a primary slot for what could be done in gadget spot, and might I add, done faster than the shotgun?

this is too funny and the flick tho dayum
---
But mute is usually a anchor operator due to his gadget and how efficient he is at denying info in one area, which makes it easier to hold there. His shotgun, like all others are quite bad after a certain range, thus making it a bad weapon to hold with unless you're hiding around a corner. In that case, they deserve to die at that point. Plus his MP5K is one of the better of the defending weapons. (Excluding the ones with ACOGs because the ACOG makes the any gun straight up better)
---
You are a funny person.
---
What's even more bullshit about it, is the progress bar. It's a blatant lie as it takes another full second to finish once the bar is done.

Credit where credits due. Reposters get brownie points by ripping someone else’s content. The problem here is fairly obvious.
---
Also
---
 Many reposts are by accounts farming karma so that they can sell them to people willing to buy “trustworthy” and “influential” accounts to do whatever with, usually advertising or politics.
---
Either way, it often does more harm than good. Reposts in some bigger subreddits often have [xpost] or [repost] and link to source for such posts to counteract this, which is what calling out a repost also does.

But the problem is I have you just haven’t been reading because idk your pea sized brain can’t handle being proven wrong but here let me explain it again. A BUG is something wrong with the code rubber banding itself IS not a bug and to believe it is that’s pure ignorance.

Drag shot/flick, either way nice shot!

Ironic that you’re calling me “pea-brained” when the entire point of me saying anything at all went over your head. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a bug or not. The point of me doing that was to show you how fucking annoying it is to have someone say the same thing to you over and over without providing a reason. If you can’t think of an actual explanation as to why the action in the video is *not* a case of rubber banding, despite all the evidence to the contrary, then maybe you’re wrong. 
---
How so?
---
Wow, haven't thought about sketchup in years lol. I could only make basic skateparks lol. I could never do this, good job so far 👍.

can j just say, what an awful layout for a house

I wasn't saying for the lowest of fucking levels dumbass so there's one. Two no shit you fix exploits you do that for everyone smart ass. Also you're the one getting pissy with me so fuck off. If you were actually fucking smart you'd stop fucking talking bullshit on a shitty fucking site. So go fuck yourself would you and your shitty examples that make no damn sense. Also last thing if they use operators properly ain't that a good thing?
---
Or when you hear the fuze
---
R6 map??
---
Well that would let hackers make more accounts yeah they can't play on ranked but still
---
Gives my screen background a nice artisan and rustic feel to it.
---
I figured out the fix yesterday, I had to disable my integrated graphics because for some fucking reason siege would always try to start with it.
---
The game has been out for over 3 years, saying you have 400 hours means nothing. The game needs a operation health 2 but knowing Ubisoft they still wouldn't fix anything.
---
Who doesn’t watch the flank?

I guess I'm OOTL but why is everyone so hyped on black ice?
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t the spqr skin (parabellum) The first universal skin allowed okay shields?

I’m probably against having the universal colors available for shields (like hot pink) but the actual season skins would probably look really cool!!!!

Ear muffs got fixed a while back 
---
People that hack are scum. People that hack in casual are the scum on the scum’s shoes. 
---
My thoughts is that you didnt hit shit and your complaining
---
I like it
---
I remember when earmuffs would be headshots some times so I’m glad that’s fixed. One tip though from this, aim at the a shield ops head if they’re staring at you. Usually you can shoot them before they shoot you. 
---
Nvm, I cropped it
---
It was allowed in pro league on several occasions, so I guess it’s legal.

Killfeed shows you dying first.

The polar opposite of when you stim someone and they get confident then run out and get immediately headshotted.

Tachanka doesn't need a rework he's just misunderstood 
---
Had some dumbass pick Monty and do this same shit on plane and he got me and another teammate killed and then he acted like we were the ones that didnt know what we were doing. An absolute retard he was. 
---
Love me some tachanka aces I’ve gotten like 3 just in the objective 
---
If they rework him I’m not playing no more 
---
“No u” gotem
---
Both are really good options. They both support the team in their own ways. Maverick can help get through reinforced walls while Nomad is good for watching flanks with her airjabs. It all comes down to which you would rather do. Nomad is probably the most unique option in that she is the only attacker that can place down traps other than a claymore.
---
Ah thanks. initially when I saw it, it looked like it had chain links dangling down the sides. Watching it again, it does look like the urban recon legendary.
---
Yes I do

I would actually like if someone made these blanks with the background for each season

Ffs people stop blaming it on the ping all the time! The netcode being broken as fuck is the problem, not our connection. Furthermore, most people in Siege I know have connection issues ONLY with Siege, no other game ever lags. So even with the icon, its still their freaking fault!

Makes sense, especially with the game being as old as it is now and most players are seasoned veterans.  I'll definitely give it a try. Probably the best advice I've gotten on the matter across any platform. 👍

Drone, drone and drone. Always drone and have someone cover you when you do. Me and my stack of two others always travel together or run strategies. A good one is to pick Fuze on Hereford, always, and have someone come with you to fuze the floor above Obj as only one obj is unfuzable from above. EZ kills even in high gold games. Thank me later 👍

Тут понимаешь в чем дело, этот режим даже новичкам не подойдёт. Вот представь, ты новый игрок, ещё ничего про игру не знаешь, играешь казуал, потому что в рейт нельзя, ибо уровень ещё не набрал(а я считаю, что рейт нужно пускать хотя бы уровня с 50, лучше 60, ибо на 20 ты все такой же пентюх, ничего не понимвющий, но в рейт уже можешь ходить и руинить катки нормальным игрокам(не один раз с этим сталкивался)) Так вот, заходишь ты в обыску, первые 5 уровней ты просто как овощ, с такими же как ты там варишься, а потом как по щелчку пальца, подбор меняется и к тебе начинает каки-то неадекватов кидать, и пошло поехало рекрут-раш, тимкилы, лютая токсичность и в итоге часов через 30 такого шлака у тебя складывается впечатление об игре - какая-то дичь и ты просто забрасываешь эту игру, либо ты становишься таким же отбитым. Мне вот повезло, я играю с релиза и раньше казуал был по сути, тем же ранкедом, просто с меньшем кол-во раундом и большим таймером

3 teammates, 5 attacking rounds, they all got interrogated every single round except the last one because we tk'd 2 of them right at spawn. So 13 interrogations altogether over the entire round. I bet you can understand that we kinda got frustrated after that especially after we clutched all the defender rounds. The enemy team wasn't even good. I think it's safe to say they either didn't know the game at all or they fed themselves to cav.
---
Press the Mic button next to their name on the leaderboard rather than their name! 
---
what skin?
---
« Stuck into gold and plat because of this » Lmao.
---
Completely understand the frustration but I still wouldn't say it justifies the team kill. You asked them to follow you but why did you not follow them to try prevent the interrogations if they were bothering you?
---
The whole point I am trying to make is there is so many other ways to deal with the problem rather than add to it.
---
I have sse situational awareness like that on gold pc, and on gold console
---
don't get it, there is nothing blocking. nade hit the bar, cam went to wall... what blocking?
---
It's more like putting a player on a bench because he's not delivering and causing the team to lose.
---
Because "high quality video" still looks like shit compared to a real time render and it would actually take even more space since you're just using ingame models now and plop them on screen.
---
Should we replace all the models in the operator menu with videos too? Or maybe we should just use static images?

No not putting on bench, you are not replacing him with another player. You are straight up removing him without a better player to fill in that blank you are dropping your men power from 0 to - 1
---
Thank
---
Does this qualify for r/ihadastroke?
---
I love this game. I hate Ubisoft, I hate the games monetization. But the assymetrical gameplay is done right.
---
And now I cant play it because my new pc was acting up since day 1 and I don't know why. I had micro stutters, freezes, weird picture problems but all tests and benchmarks didn't show any problem.
---
I think it is the PCI-E port as I was not able to reproduce the problems when.using.my graphics card in the other port. And now I have to wait a week or two until I get it back and have to hope the retailers actually valued what I told them and is now actually changing the hardware instead of just reinstalling windows.
---
That's the saddest part that this round was the only one we got close to a win when we were -2 players. The third one got interrogated before we could plant tho.

He directly copied the style and even the name. Try creating a comic with the name "Spider-dude" and he looks exactly like Spiderman. That is plagiarism.

You can blame it on the servers all day, it won't change the facts that it's not the netcode.

The answer was easy, I've seen this before and being downed in a Frost mat decreases down time.
---
Happened to me, lost all HUD until restart the game
---
Exactly 
---
Ive been trying to get this, but my internet is too good 
---
Well my setup is also weird...three screens of different sizes and resolutions. (65" 4k, 27" 2k, 22" FHD) And my desk is so messy I cant find anything. BUT there is room enough for gaming, gotta set priorities xD
---
That‘s what i thought too lol

Hi everyone, I'm aware of challenges being posted incorrectly (Vigil Birthday Challenge). This issue will be resolved in version 2 of the bot, coming in the next few weeks. For now, this post will show the correct challenges in ±45 minutes.
---
I cant be shocked by weird setups
---
Like, the usage of the SSD. 50%, 99%?
---
Such a useless thing i just cant understand why ppl care about stuff like that
---
Do you mean 200 Twitch? 😎
---
You've never seen me play then
---
I’m just saying that rank doesn’t determine your overall skill set of the game, (how good you are / play style / etc.).
---
deadass got killed the other day because i was sitting right next to a wall and i died to a thermite charge because i didnt hear it at all. sitting. right. next. to. the. wall. 
---
It's still good, you just gotta control the recoil! 
---
Thank you for your work, sir.
---
If it’s gotten really bad maybe try finding a different game to play when siege doesn’t go so well sometimes. You don’t have to completely stop playing but it’s nice to have something to fall back on.

Latency icon: The latency icon will appear when your ping is high. A yellow latency icon means your ping is high enough for additional validation steps to be triggered by the server (around 100-140 ms of ping). These additional validation steps come into play when treating your shots, and determining whether or not they are a hit. You might notice some of your hits are not registering. Having a high ping also means you could encounter unpleasant situations such as dying behind cover. A red icon means your ping is bad (around 400-500 ms of ping). Being in that state for a long time could result in player being kicked from the game server. When the latency red icon is visible, almost all of your hits will be rejected by the server. This is intended.

This is pretty much known by everyone and is a default strat, good for new players to see tho
---
I'm in.
---
You could even replace Maestro with Echo (very similar playstyle imo) and that would still work right? Always good to throw a Lesion in the mix for some fun with Gu.
---
Yea. I was about to say that
---
fuck off.
---
lvl 145, bronze 1...
---
ok
---
Meh, here for a good time. I could push further if I wanted too but ranked triggers me lmao. I'm happy with my level of play and how I play.
---
If everyone else is wrong, it might be worth to look at the possibility that's not them but you instead.
---
You usually can say whatever you want, as long as you do it in a respectful way. "Fuck you!" doesn't exactly meet this requirement.
---

&gt; Becuase of you not good at the game you shouldn’t have an opinion on something that has to do with ranked gameplay becuase any rank below gold 1 is just casual but slightly sweatier

Yeah, but people should respect his opinions...

I would like to change my data center from WEU to NEU. I haven't play with anyone on WEU who spoke English, and due to the fact that R6 is a communication game I would love to change to NEU and speak to other players, not to take advantage of ping.

You might be interested in knowing that the bombs actually emits yellow smoke when the defending team win. Implying that the bombs are biochemical and not Michael Bay bombs.

A manchild with probably 40 million fake accounts vs a Government founded show. both suck. i dont get the hype about either of the two.
---
Hmmm... siege made my aim... (even if i'm low gold here)... so i had played cs:go for about 250 hrs and after struggling to get oug of silver 1 i just deleted it and came to r6. After 1600+ hrs on r6 i decided to try cs:go again, because mu friends were playing it, and first rank i got was master guardian 1... before that they thought i was still a silver scrun. Well all i gotta say, r6 is accually harder. Congragulations on ranks i cannot posess

Do you really not understand why you are getting downvoted? In the last 72 hours you've made several threads where you're expression a controversial opinion. In all of these threads you have made a really poor effort at making a convincing arguement as to why your opinion is correct, and predictably you are getting downvoted because other users are not convinced. It doesn't help that you respond to every single person in every thread, often with poorly thought out replies which often ends with you getting angry and insulting other users, as shown in the comments above.

It is frankly an unfair advantage. You pay 100$ to a company for uncertified hardware (microsoft even tried to ban them via dashboard update, 1 day later, firmware update, works again...see the point?) that gives you a hugely noticable advantage, over people who are not ready to pay for that shit. Lets start paying for wallhacks next and tell people not to complain, but do it too, wallhacks don't change your aim, better aim wins if everybody has wallhacks. Why stop there. Pump the olympics with steroids so there is more records to be made....yay.

Is this why the Zofia challenge is in there twice? Placeholder for this?
---
youre mad
---
You're invisible except for the white 'tendrils' upon the camera's screen. The larger they are the closer the cam/drone is to the 'invisible Vigil'
---
Hell no, pick the operator you want and stop wasting everyones time
---
You can move. As long as your gadget is active your invisible to drones/ hacked cameras 
---
If you have his gadget activated you will be invisible to the enemy team no matter if you are standing still or running around. But if he's talking about without the gadget activated I don't think that's a thing
---
Kapkan mains be like
---
My traps are FUCKIN useless now Ubisoft
---
Too classic !
---
Accurate 😭
---
Dude, I have a 500 GB SSD and 1TB hard drive with a 2TB external drive. That doesn't make this game any less absurdly massive.
---
Also, this game was, at one point, barely above 10GB. They've been adding around 5GB per operation, which is frankly ludicrous. That doesn't even always come with a new map. Sure, they use many unique assets. But that doesn't explain all of this. The only games that even compare to this in size are hyper-realistic games like COD, and this game frankly doesn't look half as good as COD, despite me liking this game far more.
---
it is both, to be fair
---
Plus with doc you go down instead of die with anything but a headshot, with rook everyone goes down instead of dying
---
&gt; Ok let me guess, bronze? Silver at best?
---
Gold 1.
---
&gt; Mate I’m a fucking Blitz main! I know what works!!
---
Ok, good for you.
---
&gt; And I’m on console as well lol. With frost you need to place your traps right. In the center of the doorway doesn’t fucking work.
---
Seen all that done, but smart players know these tricks. I'm not talking about dumbass Blitz players because they all fall for the stupidest things. I'm talking about the smart guys who play Blitz. They are the real killers.
---
It was a long time ago
---
Lol, well done
---
I feel you 1 month ago I just kept dying non-stop and I was like "how am I suposed to have fun with thia game?"
---
But after watching tons of videos for the funs of it and finding my right operators, reading their abilities, and learning them maps I was finally able to even clutch.
---
What I'd recommend is watching like Serenity to learn the roam side of the game and some videos about spawnpeeking and map whereabouts cuz the worst thing as a player is wanting to go upstairs or downstairs and searching for some stairs and stuff.
---
I love that on the second viewing, you see the puck land next to you through your scope. RIP.
---
The same thing happened to me in the same spot! wtf

Not sure about that but so be it

Perfectly fine, his ump could use a little buff though
---
No

Why are there 2 Zofia challenges?
---
Its obviously Kanal, that's the boat garage
---
Okay this is epic
---
Yes... You’re fully invisible while moving as well. That’s literally his gadget 
---
I... I think Ubisoft just got roasted.
---
T series be like “we can snipe a coin”

Pewdiepie be like

“We can make a diss track”
---
Literally just dont stand still if you know theres a pulse 
---
It’s a happy medium. A happy medium that works, might I add. 
---
So a sniper rifle on defense? 
---
C7E and secondary shotgun 
---
Then explain Lion
---
Where my RPK?
---
This still happens if you try to fuze from the top
---
Yes x1000.
---
Maybe for every 10 commendations you receive, you receive 500 Renown. Or something along the lines of that. 
---
This was ranked...
---
Its useless now that i got feedback. Apologies
---
Wait what is this? 
---
I've explained this multiple times.  Yet, I still have not heard an answer to the question of why.  At this point, you are just circling to not answer.  It seems like you are questioning you reasoning.  Doesn't matter where you are from or what racist word it is, don't say them.
---
-No Clip Enabled
---
Ubi probably haven't even tried this idea, However attackers have drones so it's pointless
---
You're good lol.
---
Just wanted to point out the operators literally meant for tasks like you proposed.
---
I really do not see the correlation between what point I was making here. 
---
No it doesn’t Pulse shouldn’t have a good gun when he has wall hacks 
---
Looks like it, I was so hyped for this but got jebaited
---
Damn, well good luck sir
---
Fps : fuze person shooter
---
No, of course not
---
r/woooosh 
---
They change yearly. The charms and challenges. Once every operator has had their birthday challenge, they update. Yes I hate the challenges this past year but the charms are way better than plain gold medallions
---
Happy medium of strong gadget weak gun. Lion has both. Strong gun and strong gadget. 
---
This was far to enjoyable to watch. That Hockey Puck wanted to shoot it's shot with sharp shooter.
---
So I keep all of them? Like Finka, Maverick?
---
I think that’s the point, it’s like a small reward just for playing the game each week. 
---
This is a fairly old clip.  So its only the third different post about it.

Hello Cav main, another Cav main here.

Fuck no. As a legitimate user of Tachanka, no. No, no, no. After the disaster that is the Lord Bundle, I don't trust Ubisoft with my Tachanka.

I understand, I just want to mix it up a bit. I am not saying to make it anything complicated, just some variety. 
---
Wow, childish

...
---
"Will I lose all my ops"
---
"No"
---
Watch pros like pengu and such they teach you alot just from watching them play. Also work on your maneuvering first, aim will get better over time and try not to be predictable 
---
There was literally no reason to do that. That’s just money you have to spend for a new monitor.. just a lack of self control led to this and after you calmed down you probably regretted what you did

---
I agree and love getting the charms. I just want some variety is all. I don't have to try to get these charms, I destroy drones and gadgets whether I am getting a charm or not. I just want a challenge where I actually have to think about completing it. 
---
Funny guy taking a picture of a piece of paper..

The US Racer pack is still available in the Shop tab under Digital Content, looks like the other variations were removed.

They do NOW. They changed their deploy behavior around Operation Health I think.
---
Yes
---
Vega 11? There we go. 
---
I’m not referring to Lion?? 
---
And if you weren’t aware already he’s been quarantined from Pro Play because he’s too strong, and Ubi have publicly stated that they’re exploring possible ways to subdue his effectiveness.

Bad, really bad. Got 14-0 by SSG

Will i lose my ops.

no. 
---
so i keep them?
---
Ok that's what I thought, thanks for clearing it up.
---
I think they should have that because I have been killed countless times by defenders who have not been marked yet 
---
It's 22 and it isn't fixed yet ?!!

wow dude assuming genders? hmmm...  also i think its funny how you say "I'ma fuck off with your bullshit like a actual man cause I actually have a pair" like your gender actually matters lol.  You literally haven't said a logical thing for the past few replies, youre literally getting pissed off and spouting ignorant illiterate things, which is hilarious btw keep it up.  Also I dont consider myself Ubi's pet they do give good dick though... on a serious note Ubi does a lot of things i dont agree with but, balancing off the highest level is not one of those things and frankly if you think it should be the other way around you're an idiot.  Name a single competitive multiplayer game that balances off the lower level of play... come on, I'm waiting Mr. "I know how video games work".  You call my facts "bullshit" but you offer no counter argument other than "I'm a casual pleb and I want the game to be just how I want it no matter how it affects other people and any comments that explain why this won't work are bullshit" get your head out of your ass.
---
Then leave.  Siege would not be Siege without spawn peeking and runnouts.
---
Nothing cropped it. I am watching the full, one minute clip straight out of GeForce Experience. The connection meter is all the way to the right. I don’t know what you want me to tell you.
---
Ash is Jewish for anyone that doesn't get it...
---
You should see PL around Red Crow. So many rounds/matches were redone because of Hibana's X-pellets.
---
Best sound in the game? In what sense though? The sound consistently fucks up when verticality is added into the mix.
---
Picture of a drawing*
---
So the Lion main wants wall hacks, and out in the open hacks?  
---
I know it's frustrating, but if you learn the run-out and peeker spots you can usually counter fairly easy.
---
Tactical Tachanka?
---
But I guess as droning get better you can also get better at hiding! Skill level says allot in this game and I feel even the "worst" op in the right hands is dangerous
---
I miss the days of pure fear whenever a cluster charge went off for both teamates and the enemy. Ever since they reduced the random spread it just isn't the same. 
---
Imagine he gets perma-banned for it
---
Have you played other games on PC?

Especially when you already know it's there but get distracted.

IF your CPU isn't that good and hitting 100% at most of the time you will see some mouse lags and the way to fix that is to turn it off. if you have a good CPU then have it on.
---
I think roof hatch should be moved rather be removed.
---
drone and learn high traffic area
---
headphones forsure. work on your aim and prefire
---
Damn, you found all the drones I drove into the pit on tower.
---
Be honest. This game wouldn't be half as fun as it is if Fuze didn't exist.
---
Call of Duty MW1 &amp; Black Ops 1, I'm talking 2011... I didn't even had a mouse at the time. I used my laptop's touchpad. It'd take me some time to get used to mnk again. 
---
The report tosic behaviour doesn't do anything. Why add more useless functions.
---
Yup that's exactly why I wanted to learn two ops on both atk and def really well. For me I hate playing ela on fortress but I'm hearing valk is good. So I learn these two as I improve in the game. I also like vigil but it's mostly because his guns so good haha not a fan of his gadget
---
no actually i do what everyone else can and will do as well. I mean why would i put myself in a disadvantage?
---
Also ash is not that op. Her weapon is really Good but her ability is not as useful.
---
She is really Good but not op
---
Friend i still working on this, maybe the delay tomorrow.

free speach to drones
---
Yes people get the ban all time boosting
---
Far too lazy don't they bring out free content every 3 months? 
---
Maybe yeah. It was just getting confusing when rearranging things so I just removed it. But yes, it would likely be better off just being moved. Maybe at the end of the windy hallway on the top floor, by the new office doorway. That would be cool. 
---
On the other hand, it might also make that side more appealing without a hatch there increasing play on them sites. Just a theory though. This would never be done so it’s really hard to tell. 
---
Thanks for the feedback though👍
---
5 hostages.
---
No, he's just making up features he wants.
---
All of you fools realize that Chunkys real purpose is to open hatches with his turret ... /s
---
What the fuck was that 😂
---
Yeah valk is a good op to learn with bc you can improve your intel and callout game with your cams and improve your gunplay with her SMG bc its damage isnt the best
---
His out break and pro league set skins were fantastic however not a lot of great permeant sets.
---
"A" on the downstairs defense has a hatch
---
Hmm and damn thats platinum in that same spot sure doesnt look like it in that light. That's crazy. 
---
oh..my..god *rage quit
---
No problem bro! Nerds unite 👊! 😂😂😂 
---
There is a hatch on Hereford if you defend downstairs on bomb
---
YESSSSS 👊
---
Ok. Thanks for your time.

Hello hypebeasty, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aipq2p/fun_on_plane/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Not sure how to do it but I can add the Standard Edition gives you the original 20 Operators for free.
---
Can you please take a screenshot of your camera panel? 
---
I guess your copy of the game didn't come with claymores
---
*Kurwa intensifies*
---
Oh yeah poor fucking ubisoft and their million of dollars.
---
Breaking a monitor which costs real money over fake video game points... probably best if you play a less competitive game.
---
Start with Year 1 operators as they are cheaper, stick to the essentials like Hibana, Valkyrie, and Echo. If your looking to be more of a Fragger than an extremely useful gadget than go to Buck/Blackbeard.
---
Hi!
---
Yep if you solo its blackbeard because you will be taking the intiative to support others you make alot of noise as Buck and you will need someone covering you playing vertically which you cant rely on when solo queing.
---
Probably Zofia. Better weapons and more utility. 
---
Imagine being that pathetic lol.
---
Where is the part where you blow them up?
---
That's exactly why he was made. That's why all the operators are the way they are. It changes the element of the game. They aren't going to remove and op because of how he changes the element. 
---
Both are pretty good. If solo queue, then Zofia, if not, Doki Doki girl. The choice is up to you though, as the bullet hose called the smg-12 is quite fun.

Thanks mate, happy to hear

The C7E is stupid overpowered having a body shot time to kill well below human reaction time.  It's a must pick on par with the FAMAS.

How your limited 2 drones per round
---
Its technically correct

FOKIN CHIRSTMAS SIGHTS

One of the most accurate cosplay I've seen in a while

I don't know for sure, but I think he went into terrorist hunt and kept using the ammo refill box. No idea if it gives you drones, but that's my best guess.
---
Did anyone realize that maverick is actually scout from tf2
---
I’ve always thought that too, it would explain fighting in Hereford and Fortress
---
It is
---
sick video, love it.

I completely agree with a forgive option. I had a situation where 2 people walked in front of me while I was trying to shoot at a spawn peek. Both said it was obviously an accident yet I still got kicked. I understand ubi has to bring down the hammer SOMETIMES, but imo most of the toxicity ban changes were an over reaction. I'm not entirely sure why ubi chose an automated filter system for chat. It nevers works as advertised. But I feel like a "forgive tk" option should have been something from the start of this "elimination" of toxicity. Accidents happen ubi.
---
If its anything like Overwatchs system for endorsement, that just means opening your mouth to even coordinate with your team is toxic/try hard and worthy of a report. 
---
That's the dumbest advice. Don't do that next time, too stupid.
---
I main Thermite or Jackal on attack and on defense I go for Echo or Lesion
---
Touché

Not like how would the attackers win?

will this map ever come back or no?

---
hmm
---
At least someone can have fun in this game nowadays
---
No because there have been ranked games I’ve seen with scores going 13-13 and beyond with people legitimately getting above 10,000 score
---
But yet again when does this ever happen
---
You aren't a true pulse main until you identify his actor in person of interedt
---
Yea man I usually throw 2 out in case I die that way I can still help the team, and I keep one for myself
---
Yes, we all can quote Get_Flanked words, but here is my take on the situation:
---
- **Weapons:** MP5SD only has advantage at close range, since it will take 1 less bullet to kill Medium Armor than regular MP5. On longer ranges, the damage profile become identical, while regular MP5 has better recoil control due to muzzle attachments. MP5SD, on the other hand, will blind your vision with muzzle smoke due to integrated suppressor. 
---
So I doubt you can call SD a flat-out **better gun**.
---
- **Utility:** Different gadgets cater to different situations. Yokai’s can easily be dispatched of by Twitch, IQ, neutralized by Thatcher or simply shot if you pay close attention. Armor Pack helps your team in firefights, as you completely neutralize attackers’ firepower advantage, turning most AR’s into overpriced SMG’s, while also ensuring that your teammates always get downed, enabling for them to be brought into fight later. 
---
Again, the question of better utility is also debatable.
---
I cant decide which I truly main on Attack, mostly Thermite and Thatcher. Lesion on Defense.
---
One hostage per room, cluster charges pre-deployed in every window. 
---
^you are fuze.^
---
When you start, you can instantly press 4.
---
We got em'
---
Not sure cause I use mine on Xbox lol
---
I too wish we had communication still. I think the lack of it is a big reason for the state of this game. They never listen to what the player base wants. So many people have had so many good solutions that Ubi will refuse to hear.
---
It does suck, and after buying the Year 4 pass first day, I'm a little nervous it won't be as we hope.
---
That’s a one in million fuse kill
---
Yea there are bugs. But still has better sound location stuff then most games lol
---
What happens if you aren't forgiven? Is there a punish option? (ala counterstrike?)
---
Go play a custom game and pick a gamemode.Take time in customs to learn each site. Doing that when a brand new map releases always helps me learn it quicker. I understand that each map is large but its up to you to learn them. 
---
I can’t wait for them to say “buff who” cause we gonna hit em with that PHAT “TACHANKA”
---
is this considered as something special for console players? what's the point?
---
Yeah, I know. I didn't think about it though, so he would get a max of 20 points each time since only 5 people can control drones at a time.
---
It is. Solo queue is a nightmare. They game is basically only enjoyable in group play, and if you don't have that then you are SOL.
---
Then it just goes like normal
---
Then it just goes and counts as a regular tk 
---
You shot a bot lol
---
It was just kill each other. Kind of boring
---
This is why Monty is my main on plane.
---
I don't expect it to change anything. This was more of a way to vent my frustrations.
---
I think he purposely kept his username and shit out of the picture because he went offline to hack it, like how basicallyhomless did with jager ads and claymores
---
Shoot or die
---
I wish Ubi would let us have mods in custom games, I mean imagine an Automatic X-Kairos with unlimited ammo.
---
Dust_2
---
Mira is almost, if not always a good defense pick
---
Finka on Attack. Lesson on defense. 
---
how the turn tables
---
Being a vigil main though, i would love to see a vigil buff like this.

Microliter drone lol

Theres a counter to this tho. Shoot the charge thru the floor when he activates it there

Should of just shot him instead of being selfish. Hopefully your team still won the round

I did a bit of boundary breaking with it back in the day on watch dogs 2, pretty much the same process.

WD2 has EAC, you can disable that too?

That only works if youre near by

On Attack: Finka and Thermite

On Defense: Echo

I’m a sign not a cop

I just started switching from Xbox to pc and have yet to buy rainbow because I really don’t want to have to look for people to play with and start unlocking every operator again. 
---
But when I switched to overwatch pc I had pretty much the same problem you’re having. I’d always forget what button does what and do stupid stuff like accidentally use my ult when I’m just trying to walk. However, I think the best thing you can do is just tough it out. 
---
If you play with a controller you’re still going to be in a disadvantage since playing with mouse and key is a lot better. I would say tough it out now that you’re friends just started playing the game as well you all can get used to it together.

Yes, I tried with a controller for a few games and realized how much it sucked. I mean, it felt natural for me, but I couldn't aim or hit people any faster than they obliterated me. 
---
Dirt 4
---
I gave it to you anyway. ;) 
---
Thank you, though. I will go through and look at my bindings again. Some of them seem very unnatural to me. 
---
Yea fair enough good point
---
Ah come on guys... are you just arguing for the sake of arguing.. 
---
I'm extremely upset that you didn't fire and entire magazine in to the pile.
---
Thank you. Maybe I'll go on a two week run of playing R6 every night to see if I can feel more comfortable with it. 
---
There are some obvious issues that come with a commendation reward system (See COD WWII), but overall, it's a good system. 
---
It would be also cool if your "commendation level" impacted who you matched up with. For example, if your commendation level is low, meaning the people you play with weren't fans of you, you play people just as 'low' as you. Since a low commendation level would be pretty indicative of toxic gameplay or undesirable gameplay, you would be stuck with people just like that until you "change your ways". 
---
This is where the renown reward system would come into play (I've come up with a different approach). The higher your commendation level, the more renown you receive for each commendation. Say you have 10 tiers, with 10 being the highest. This means for every commendation at tier 10, you receive 100 renown. That would mean if you are at tier 9, you only get 90, tier 8 you get 80 etc. I think a daily limit of how much commendation renown you receive would combat majority of the abuse you would otherwise see. This, ideally, would promote less toxic behavior, otherwise, you get matched with others who play just like you, and suffer the same crap while the higher commendation players receive more renown and an overall better gameplay experience. Lastly, you would only receive commendations from your teammates and not the enemy team. Otherwise you have poor sportsmanship and everyone who loses would just tank the winning team's commendation level.
---
Just an idea with I'm sure plenty of holes to poke. It's fun to dream though.
---
How?
---
Yeah it’s kind of upsetting I just want to plug in a controller and play the game right but that really doesn’t work
---
I mean youre acting like theres no counters to it... :/
---
Yeah you just put in the launch options of the game “-eaclauncher” I think. You can’t go online with it, but it disables the anti cheat.
---
It’s been the same way with walls forever, example being Oregon 2F Closet. I doubt it’s an oversight after all this time.
---
? 
---
My mans actually just ran out on a entire team with a shotty...what a legend
---
Sry but this is just basic shit here.
---
Best loss I've seen in a while.
---
Play through all Situations (skip Article 5). 
---
Play classic T Hunt before matches to warm up. 
---
Just use normal difficulty. No timer, dumb AI gives you all the freedom to practice.
---
Wo cao! China Numba 1!
---
Practice makes perfect dude. Just give it some time.
---
Not much to think about 
---
I never said that... i just think ubi made a sinple oversight on it. They didnt want thermite to have that kind of ability without support. Thats why they took his frags
---
i took hibanas type 89 and modified the ammo size to 1000 the recoil was shit af but i managed to destroy every drone
---
"Planning out what to do instead of going to objective in the last 15 seconds of the match"
---
😂😂😂not a legend man just your friendly neighborhood bot
---
killing millions of hostages worldwide
---
If you know and can counter it why are you crying about it. Get the fuck off reddit and cry some more. Maybe this game isn’t meant for you and you should go play Fortnite. 
---
I'm guessing 241 drones causes your computer to implode.

It's about the Outbreak operation, he wanted to nuke the town, it was so American of him it took me a whole week to get over it 
---
Jesus christ are you actually a real person or a troll. I cant tell at this point. Who hurt you man?
---
Its not blitz whos broken its shields in genral
---
Hey, fuck you. Nothing against you but I’m incredibly salty that you got 2 black ices at level 17 because I’m level 100+ and been playing for 1.5 years and still don’t have one. I even saved up 180k renown and bought 50 packs and didn’t get one 
---
I get salty too but I probably wouldn't break things.. too expensive to replace lol
---
This happened a every day. Press f for respect
---
You can't have your cake and eat it too. So either put up with them or mute them its such a simple fix my dude. Its one game you lack communication with one person.  After the game just leave.
---
Glaz is slav squat style peeing from skylight. 
---
Lmfao Jesus can tell you’re a whiny little bitch. It’s people like you who ruin this game crying about the smallest of things that don’t even matter because they hardly happen or get countered too easily. Go play Fortnite you fucking loser. 
---
So I've got intel that there's enemy behind the bar table. Exactly under that vent hole, easy prey for a Finka with nades - my thoughts exactly.  
---
But who knew that Hibana will quickly jump over to get that melee kill? 
---
RIP.  
---
Actually me at level 15

Wait one minute, your flair says otherwise

---
I really just want the r4c skin
---
r/trashy 
---
It should but how would they make their money?
---
What I hate is that old cosmetics don’t transfer. I mean, we can’t buy sunsplash and halloween packs or old pro league sets anymore, so it’s not like they can make more money by not letting those cosmetics transfer.
---
Don’t play ranked without at least 3 friends is my rule.
---
Playing ranked solo or as a duo is just going to end badly.
---
You will get lucky sometimes, but between bad players, people that are not team players, and trolls you are more then likely going to not have a good experience.
---
Playing blitz is either getting 3 melee kills and securing the objective or getting shot through your shield 30 seconds into the match
---
How am i supposed to know the difference if they look the same
---
I’d say bring everything thing over but rank

Great idea, smite has a similar system. You can recommend for Teamwork, Guide and Friendly. Plus the give rewards for certain amount of recommendations!

What the fucks your problem?? And can you stop telling me to go play fortnite like thats the ultimate insult. You say im whiny but have you read your messages? Like you come across like a complete dick head. If you dont like my opinion on the thermite thing thats cool. But theres no need to be a total cunt about it.

---
copper IV is legitimately the hardest rank before you get up to the top end of gold because of derankers.
---
Good for you, but please think about the other players, just because something is easy for you doesn't mean it is easy for everyone. People that do these weekly challenges are people who bought starter/standard/advanced edition, they do these for renown not for the sake of giving themselves challenges.
---
People solo queue a lot, which increases their lose rate. Most of the weekly challenges require you to actually win the game. And the one with Win 8 rounds with GIGN/Spetsnaz is certainly not an easy one.
---
I can already tell what kinda guy this is judging by the vape and the screen

Wait How do you get out whit the hostage?

Woo, I sure love having the excitement of gold light from the pack turned into a common, its the best feeling in the world
---
I know I'm gonna get downvoted, but I've been playing since Red Crow (PC) and I'm level 216 -- I don't think they should've given him thermals. People just wanted Ubi to fix the hitreg on his rifle. The fact that a single bullet hole in a wall can give you away because there's yellow showing through is bs. Being able to see through smoke is enough of a special ability. 
---
Good play overall on your part.
---
How? Blitz should get an ak-47 because he is also special, you can just make his shield his gadget also.
---
You realize you hit the railing, right? 
---
Imaging shooting all of those drones.... so many points 🤤
---
That was my first thought.
---
I placed high gold ever year and deranked it unintentionally due to terrible team mates. BUT with that being said 85% I think is a good number to say of silver and lower I can pretty much trash to get back to gold only to que bad teammates again and repeat cycle it's really about your skill level my guy and a little luck to land some one half decent on your team . SO WITH THAT ALL SAID IF YOU DRANK alllllllllll the way to copper and cant get out your skill level needs to improve period. 
---
like most game devs, ubisoft doesnt have a focus on improving the existing game or features.  they focus mainly on whats next not what is, because thats what draws in more new players and sales. its just the meta, a shame. not saying they dont work on the existing content, they definitely do but lets be real operation health only came once and thats when sales dropped and the game almost died out
---
I actually don't know how to speak German just used a Google translator and butchered it but you get the gist lmao
---
Should try R6STeams not here.
---
What, The Iron Knight? That's the only volvo truck I can think of.
---
Well no matter who you queue with there will be times where you are useless and your teammates are useless, no matter what there is something you can learn from it
---
Got a feeling its photoshopped, everything looks weird. Oh and in 1 pic hes level 12
---
Yes.  The question is, why can you got shot through three walls and not a tiny shelf support?
---
nice
---
This is possibly the best thing that I've ever seen on this sub, maybe even the website. You're the first person I've ever wanted to give gold to, but I'm a broke bastard and far too cheap to follow through.
