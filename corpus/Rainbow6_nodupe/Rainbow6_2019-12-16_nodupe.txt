Here‚Äôs something I just thought of, I think it would be interesting to see how much team killing would go up if Ubi just silently changed one of the game modes, be it Ranked, Unranked, or casual, to tactical realism for a week.

I‚Äôm a pc player and have tried mnk on Xbox and it was nothing alike, you have different fov‚Äôs, different sens options, you even have a speed limiter on Xbox so aim will be very different and your keybinds will be completely different. Don‚Äôt do it man
---
Normally I would say it‚Äôs not all about getting kills. But in this case, it‚Äôs pretty much kill or die lmao
---
Obviously videogame characters don't care what they wear and could walk backwards through a minefield without triping. But clearly Ubi thought they shouldn't break the immersion too much, because out of the designs they had they ended up with the one that doesn't look like it could be straight out of a fashion parade. No heels, no overly loose/complex clothing, etc.
---
No it‚Äôs all good dude you clearly both played well gj
---
Unironically 90%+ of jojo characters are straight.  I don't think a gay character even shows up until part 4 aside from Dio being subtly implied to be bi.

The gun was shit outside of 5ms pre nerf. Cav was a glass cannon if she had to fight anyone thats not within licking distance. Thats why the gun rework added in lower dmg dropoff for her and also why her smg got buffed.

As i'm sure you are aware, there is no official alpha pack loot table. What I do have is evidence gathered from the community since alpha packs came out. Not a single video has someone receiving an old seasonal skin. If your claim were true, there would be proof on YouTube, since someone else would have received one and made a video about it.

Doesn't suit Lesion IMO, but the others look fuckin cool. Jager... Ohh man

Exactly, and I prefer the bottom. Neither is "wrong".

Ive played tower so much, ive gotten used to how to neutralize it. Kanal will just forever be poo

Didn't know I needed this in my life

If you don't think he's busted, you're quite possibly brain damaged. Half the time, his gadget won't be used as smokes. It'll be used as a replacement for Mira, or to burn utility.

they dont care cause its not against ToS on r6s.

They do it to get better. It‚Äôs a very easy way to get to high plat or diamond and if you do reach diamond with controller. If you want to take the next step you have to be MnK.

Oh, then idk, maybe I‚Äôm remembering something that never existed?

I hate tower too. Fuck that place.

What is Macie about that? That's literally one of the biggest points of taking IQ - Seeing Pulse, Vigil, and defenders on cameras.

XIM doesn‚Äôt operate as smoothly as MnK does on a PC, I would advise just practicing once you get your PC

In the patch 5.0 ( a bit after the video I sent) they buff her damage a bit up to 10m.

Adding onto the other comment, can also see Pulse when he has his scanner out. That leads to some fun encounters of staring at one another and tracking each other through walls.

This has happened to me as well, it's a server issue

Looks like Someone scared the Ubisoft servers again

what the fuck did I just read
---
My problem is that the match had not even begun, is not that complicated. One team is incomplete the match does not start. If a teammate leaves during the match that is just bad luck. I can see no exploits there. I think that many things could be brought from cs, they have been at this for longer. For instance, being able to ask for overtime between rounds (a few seconds).

I hate this Billie Eilish skin they brought in.

Ah yes the miscalculation of who shot me and if they deserve to die

The joke is that he failed English class every year and still doesn't understand the difference between "no" and "know".

Did you get him to say he loves you back?

Ahh yes a classic

I only ever played FPS games on PC. I had buddies bugging me to get on PS4, but I refused because I hate using controllers for FPS. When I found out that I could use m&amp;kb, I bought a PS4. Now I game with console and PC pals.

there‚Äôs no point in getting rid of your primary to only use a pistol. you just handicap yourself even if you get a big buff to your gadget.

Also, to balance it out would be an issue and take up too much time. What would you do for tachanka, blackbeard, and some of the other operators?

Lastly you say you got good glaz players, but after they nerfed him he doesn‚Äôt get much play, and there are good players for every op.

the seals do allow women to join, just none have passed the training.

1. Who really cares what division they are from? This is also not the first time they have created CTUs for the game.

2. Women are allowed into the Navy Seals, the reason Valkyrie was created was to acknowledge that fact as the year she came out was the first year to allow women in that branch.

Pretty sure thats Rook

Same, I'm not great but I clutched on new Hereford with Dokkaibi too. 1v5 ace in the last round . Good kills btw, a greedy team is a doomed team.

Year 5 is confirmed, port to next gen as well

you will not be disappointed, the part 1 and part 2 are kinda lame (in my taste), but part 3 is where all the meme start. However, you still need to watch part 1 and 2 to truely understand the story.

Ok √ßa pourrait √™tre cool mais Ubisoft s'y risquerait pas, ils auraient peur de se faire taxer de militantisme, c'est pour √ßa qu'on a pas d'op√©rateur ou d'op√©ratrice de l'arm√©e isra√©lienne, Ash est isra√©lienne mais elle est au FBI, √ßa ferait trop pol√©mique autrement

Yeah they are limited now, outback and Kafe are also in rotation. Iirc it has something to do with storage and servers. I'm not really the kind of person who would know. All maps are available for T-hunt though, if that helps at all.
---
I have a team, but since a lot of people moans about soloq, this I think could improve the experience
---
How can i know what's current map pool? In patch notes? And why reduce it for casual?
---
Not sure. You probably have to but it again
---
Honestly that‚Äôs their problem, I don‚Äôt think the game should cater to that and change it for everyone else
---
Reall talk i let people finish off my down people ever match idc as long as there dead . But i have on multiple occasions been shot the following round for finishing off people's kills because where in a heavy gun fight and i dont want them to be given a second chance its kinda selfish to react and assume people do it on purpose.  Like bro we trying to eliminate the opposing team.
---
I think that Ubisoft could implement a system, that if someone using a camera is not moving it, it will get back to not controlled
---
Serves no purpose if my aim is shit like putting a trojan magnum on my dick, it would just make the situation more depressing.
---
They really need to remove barbed wire on clash smh
---
I used to have a cat named Cali, she hated me tho
---
Im assuming you didn't mean to post, I wanted an alternative to dokkaebi pretty much solely with this Operator. Markus is meant to be a *Safer, But Slower* Version of Dokkaebi's Hack. As Dokkaebi is Fast but Unsafe, Seeing as she risks her Life to get Valuable Intel, Markus is the Opposite as he can remain Safe but requires to individually Hack every Camera(He can also hack during the Prep-Phase). I also agree that the Movement Mechanic should get a Touch-Up as they are Complex.

When you get to play high ELO on PC, you‚Äôll see Spoit isn‚Äôt hacking. Everything a diamond player does, Spoit does 5x better. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs the #1 player.

The claims against him that he‚Äôs cheating are baseless, dumb and frankly spoiling potential sponsorship opportunities, all because you‚Äôre smallminded? Get it together. Also, OP, this comment wasn‚Äôt directed at you, but to the retards thinking that he‚Äôs cheating because they have never been out of silver 3

The amounts of times I tried to accomplish this is too damn high right now. Either I'm IQ and there's no site with a destructible floor so that I could shoot the guy that's destroying the defuser or I get killed post plant before I can go to a floor below.

Everything is grindable. If you don‚Äôt want to pay real dollars you can get it by playing the game. The event packs are expensive but the cost to produce an event that‚Äôs the same calibre as the last Halloween one is insane. Think about this, you have an art team that needs to draw and create a uniform, headgear and special weapon skin for each operator. Of which there is six (Frost, Lesion, Ela, Smoke, Kapkan and Sledge), you need to design 3 new sledge hammer skins, create and test the third person running animation, rework the operator pick screen so you can have multiple of the same pick, you need to basically Reston an entire map including adding new props and decorations, you need to code in the ‚Äúnightstride‚Äù so that‚Äôs both first and third person UI elements as well at stat altering effects with a cool down and activation timer. 
---
TL:DR The everyday cosmetics are grindable, the mid seasons are expensive because you have to think about the cost to develop the event to be as fun/ creative and different as it is.
---
OH
---
Well I was making a joke about anime in general being percieved as pretty gay......but well at least I know that now

You can't really complain, you got all this at your own wish. High sensitivity, constantly on secondary, plays on Favela, and spiced up with red dot. You wanted to be slick with that hack through a wall and you played yourself. Deserved. Anyway, upvoted, thanks for good giggle.

Ubisoft has stated it has a 10 year 100 operator plan. Y5 content is already being worked on. In recent years a few of the Devs and community managers have said it might go farther than 100 ops

Exactly, spawn peeking has been here the whole time and there‚Äôs multiple routes towards the building with less of a chance to get killed. 
---
Insane that people would let the enemy team walk towards the building uncontested on a red carpet
---
Is that possible? I play on pc and i didn't know about that..
---
what? F2 and j√§gers should have had the proleague skin
---
1. barely anyone has those skin
---
2. the first year proleague skins look completely different to black and white ones
---
Yeah, they‚Äôre grindable. The mid seasons you‚Äôve got no defence for, the costume sets cost three to four times as much as the game. There‚Äôs no justification for ¬£80 for four costumes.
---
It worth 0 dollars to not write it but you did

1) This was flaired automatically.

2) No, I am not joking. Most of the time the outside cameras will be destroyed by attackers. Unless they were destoyed, they can be useful later in a round to monitor enemies. But the cameras do not survive longer than half a minute into a round. As a type of player who heavily relies on intel and gadgets, I, honestly, have tried to use them to full potential. I tried to predict attacker's direction of attack and spawn positions. But it rarely works. It is worse of there is, for example, Twitch who shoots the cameras with her drone. And even then it feels like a waste. Shock drone has five shots. Three of which she wastes on cameras just on the outside. Those shots could be used to destroy operator gadgets during prep fase. In the perfect conditions Shock drone could: deal in sum max 50 damage to defenders, kill two Evil Eyes, three Black Eyes, three Pests, three ADS etc. But if the Shock drone would take time to shoot outside cameras, much later, because Shock drone is slower than usual drone, it would deal much less damage to defenders and destroy less gadgets. I know from experience that outside cameras are unusable and even if they are active, they are unreliable most of the time. An argument could be made that you could track attacker's spawn positions by which cameras were destroyed. That also doesn't always work. Some cameras could be shot from across the map from a different or from a roof. That could be missleading. For example: on Fortress all three cameras can be shot from one spawn point, southern garden. Or by Amaru from the roof in the first ten seconds. That's my opinion from experience.

I think about it a lot since I play both games. The system overwatch has is quite rare and it works a bit differently. Siege players are rewarded with new ops when they support the game a certain amount which I think works pretty well.
---
Cluck like a duck?
---
Looks great, love the style too. Make it unique
---
yes please
---
At least you aren‚Äôt zoomed in... I once had the same bug when scoping and the gave me a glimpse of Master Chief‚Äôs visor in 1080p.
---
A duck cluck, what the fuck that‚Äôd suck
---
Can u get banned or anything for using this overlay or it just allowed?
---
Not from a jedi
---
annoying as ***REMOVE BARRICADE***?
---
i dont think you know how rhyming works
---
You have soiled the drones good name. 
---
Soiled it
---
Good idea!

Uhm, I said _optional_

I *think* Mute was theorizing that the shooter was getting low on bullets and would stop.
---
it was originally designed for Instagram is it bad? should I change it?
---
Not really - there are a several versions of the glitch that has been known for longer, but some teams sit on it to win ranked at crucial moments and them bring out a few glitches when it is needed. I knew a guy that was part of a team that did shit like that, happy to not be a friend of his anymore.
---
But fun is relative to each player, some player have fun on house and plane some people even have fun on tower. Those maps are flawed in so many way that it makes them "fun".
---
But then the defenders would just shoot the cams as soon as the action phase starts if they don't want to be seen on them
---
Nope.  You can earn them all for free and all of the ops (except ash) are all really well rounded characters that are not op, or bad.
---
Exactly, they don't advertise it. A video like this goes out. The glitch ruins a few games of people that both watched it and were willing to do it. Then it gets taken out and fixed. Better than 1 report or so from teams that can use this as a "get out of jail free card" for months
---
Y E E T
---
Yeah we didnt know how to name it either üòÖ it just came unexpected
---
THIS JUST IN: *dis dude is fuckin ded.*
---
1) The difference in the amount of intel is enourmous. Counting just cameras defenders can have in one round: default cams, 2 Yokai, 3 Black Eyes, 2 Evil Eyes, 3 captured drones (three drones less for attackers) and one perator with bulletproof camera. Eleven "pairs of eyes" plus default cameras depending on a map. That's too much.
---
2) The attackers never forget to shoot default cameras. I know that as a player who spends most of the time in a round on cameras.
---
3) The attackers barely ever use their drones to counter spawnpeeks. That's a fairy tale level of strategy.
---
4) The default outside cameras can already be on an elevated position, which drones can never reach.
---
5) I never said that Valk throwing her Black Eyes outside is bad. It is a good strat. Just the default outside cameras are useless for the defenders.
---
Not going to lie. Was really hoping to see Thatcher try to rush in and get hit the EDD, and clamped on the frost mat.  Like in the real world. lol
---
Lol

It's the bosg man. No matter how hard I try, I still can't beat a vigil with a bosg and half a brain.
---
That just sounds like microtransactions but with extra steps
---
u should bully him
---
So many emojis. It hurts
---
You may miss the entire video if you blink.
---
You realise you can equip a camo to ALL guns that allow it at once... with one button... right?
---
Looks great man!
---
That last sentence represents perfectly why these days games are full of them sadly :\
---
Hammer agog
---
Drop AVP man
---
Still better than in the current state. Or we can compromise: remove default outside cameras entirely. This would save space for data for R6S client, save time and ammo for attackers and just sprint towards an objective.
---
I have no idea who that is, so I am just going to pretend you took a picture with your s/o and you two are in a wonderful, caring relationship. 
---
I‚Äôm happy for you both :)

Glaz better

I want chimera and phantom sight and le casa de papel music. Thats it.

He had a rough childhood with his entire family deceased

Was it a gang of no-lifes or friendlies?
---
Six said it's my turn to be an attacker.
---
Ubi and all game developers need to tell us how mmr works.
---
Damn... Their catching on to me.
---
Almost happened to me but they joined right before first round started and we got smacked that game
---
It determines your amount of Eli you‚Äôll gain or lose before the match starts so even if there are no enemies you‚Äôll still gain
---
Seems that you only got exhausted of playing them, never do that.
---
Happened to me back when I ublocked Lesion, played him a lot non-stop and grew up tired of him and I don't remember last time I played him tbh.
---
I recommend info ops like Maestro, Echo or Mozzie if you want to be more like Valk.
---
as a caveria main ican say this is the truth
---
Srry too much fun
---
Didn‚Äôt see your post.
---
Ash main who runs 100 sens, takes defuser and think they're pro
---
I use extended barrel, angled grip, and whatever sight u want I prefer holo
---
I don't think she is too annoying, but I am a casual player, and I use her gadget against castle barricades.
---
The part that gets me is that it sounds like a sneeze
---
Lmao something like that
---
just google rainbow 6 stats. top one [r6.tracker.network](https://r6.tracker.network). put in your username
---
I use extended barrel, reflex sight and angle grip on pulse
---
The game would not start we waited for like 15 minutes
---
Lmao you just suck
---
Congratulations! You've won a free trip to the [SOVIET GULAG] for free!
---
Im not sure who is op and who is the other guy.
---
Alternatively if you actually want out of silver and want a team r/r6steams
---
Feed it scans
---
I thought it was a little distracting but it was interesting.
---
Personally I would say that IQ's elite is the worst in the game. There is absolutely nothing about it that I like, both the hair and outfit look horrible to me.
---
They should add a mode where defense and attack operators swap
---
I think that‚Äôs actually really interesting. 
---
It‚Äôs probably one of the most overlooked strategies that newer players should consider working on.
---
And then there is a thread complaining about an invincible ash and both the ash and the player have 9ms. Its almost like people blame whatever they want to blame depending on the situation.
---
Ok that‚Äôs what i use
---
The defuser ain't the only thing that dropped
---
Why for the shotgun nobody uses it, it should be on her LMG?
---
Looks like an eye
---
The first clip eas wierd but the other 2 was you just being poopee
---
It takes into account the average of your team against the average of the enemy team so there‚Äôs no way to calculate the mmr you will win/lose
---
I was in a ranked match and someone lest as soon as the ban phase started then a new player joined this on xbox
---
This hasn't happened to me on PC yet
---
That‚Äôs an oof
---
A lot of old men
---
Lol kali is shit. I promise.
---
I have now changed my mind, my new favourite operator (that I have) is buck, because his skeleton key is insane at destroying walls and it's pretty good at close range situations, and his guns are high damage. (I started playing 3 weeks ago so I obviously don't have a lot of operators)
---
maverick goes into kitchen 
---
brazilian whispering 
---
maverick shit
---
You should already know who he is if you play this game.
---
Nice ace
---
The third clip literally froze the game client and registered my aim upwards. I have a fast PC and I never suffer frame rate drops on Overwatch only in Siege or BO4.
---
It's a phenomenal gun for long range peeks, you just have to be accurate. The thing is probably the best headshot weapon in the game because of the scope, but you only get one or two chances max to get that headshot.
---
I play a lot of Kaid on 3F Bar defense in Kafe so I can peek the skylight, thing is an absolute monster because usually all you can see is the head of someone looking through it.
---
Hey,
---
Jonas here, Community Manager at Tobii Gaming.
---
Just like USN18 we're back but this time tracked not only the captains but the whole team. This time we both combined it with some weatherman segments as well as used it during more live segments.
---
Eye tracking is another layer of insight, provided to the viewers to let you see what's going through the mind of the player. Normally you only see how a player reacts. With eye tracking you can see the decision making based on what the player sees and therefor better understand why the decision is made.
---
We've just wrapped up in Las Vegas and are really curious to hear what you guys think about the eye tracking provided throughout the weekend?
---
Did you understand that the eye trackers are something anyone can get for home use, with multiple use cases and not only during esports events like this?
---
oh of course
---
I love it!
---
Dang. Macie Jay got a picture with the one-and-only Jesus.
---
Some people have fun while playing those maps and doing meme stuff that‚Äôs fine.
---
Some people have fun by playing a more balanced game/maps that‚Äôs fine as well.
---
That‚Äôs why i say they are "fun" because fun is relative to the player.
---
Been away with no way to boot up my siege that sucks
---
ngl this looks wack
---
I'm with my bad kd from 3 years ago.  After the first season I had a w/l of 1.0 but a k/d of 0.3. Mostly because of 0.5 mbps download and 0.1 mbps upload.  It only took me 2.5 years to get it up to 0.8. I have roughly a 1.0 k/d now every season but I still get called a noob even though I'm level 327.
---
Pulse isn‚Äôt bad lol
---
*Spawn-rushers
---
It means dokebi
---
Great. Another ash player
---
2016 or 2017 skin?
---
He‚Äôs not good as well. I don‚Äôt even remember the last time I played against a pulse. I remember even less the last time a pulse killed me.
---
Oh yep, them too
---
Incorrect, I don‚Äôt use her. That‚Äôs more in likely why I got all the black ice for her.
---
I HAVE SPOKEN
---
I wish it changed her hair color. We haven‚Äôt had a seasonal BDU that changes her hair since Chimera I think.
---
This is David attenborough and today we will be examining the worst map to exist, outback.
---
You're welcome my friend! :)
---
The mother and her cubs are safe...for now
---
can i just get a renown refund for clash?
---
i did once and got stuck there for the rest of the match
---
Oh well I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm aware of everything that is going on around the game my apologies his name is macie jay he is a YouTubed/ streamer and he‚Äôs one of the biggest people around  r6 kinda like ninja on fortnight
---
Pure black would be OP in this game NGL
---
I saw this earlier but without sound so now I'm happy I turned it on, it's even funnier!
---
Try Mira! I know she‚Äôs banned a lot but she‚Äôs great. I‚Äôve also been messing around with Goyo because I love the vector so much but he requires a lot of teamwork I‚Äôve realized and randos almost never use his shields to help them. I‚Äôve gotten some nice anchor clutches with him though because you can shut off so much entry with him in the last bit of time.
---
They‚Äôre just getting lazy and it makes me sad :(
---
Yea we played a team yesterday "gold 2" that just sprinted into the building and killed everyone every round with no prior intel. They knew exactly where we weren't looking every single round. Game losing round I got wall banged and that really sealed the deal and confirmed my suspicions. We will probably get that elo back so it's not worth staying upset about. I just cant understand how people have fun and do this knowing full well they will be banned.
---
slaps roof
---
Right... passive aggression was kinda unnecessary, but you would have saved a lot of confusion by just saying that to begin with. Nothing against you mate, just saying
---
I don‚Äôt play Ela too often, but her skins are nice. I feel like the hair color changing is a really unique part of her cosmetics and am sad Ubi ditched that idea.
---
I'll Try That and report back
---
How‚Äôs my ranked season? I‚Äôm going between bronze and silver 4 constantly. It‚Äôs an unbearable loop
---
You should hit almost 20 people everyshot
---
You can't achieve that even in a school
---
pulse isnt always there to kill you, but he is always providing info, while having a nitro cell to back you up. 
---
People may not play him as much for the sad reason of him not having a god-tier primary, which everyone wants and wont play anything else because theyre sad and ruin the game
---
Microwave?
---
Haven't tried that either so I'll see if it helps
---
This is one of the few great elite concepts, I would buy this.
---
Ever since the most recent Xbox update, it's been doing it.
---
Nice, and the little flick to hit the drone was nice too
---
Wamai the aug is fun, redirecting nades is cool too
---
I prefer Enamored to heart attack but both are great.
---
##FIVESHOTBOSGACOG
---
Nah
---
Oh god... that‚Äôs too far
---
Might be the PTFE feet and the lesser weight
---
The year 5 road map will probably get announced at invitational so I'd expect an announcement for the season pass around then too.
---
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN AND HOW CAN I GET IT TO HAPPEN
---
Aight thanks for the help, just saw WarOwl's video on adapting to new mice and I feel more relieved
---
This is actually not recruit, but one of the Halloween event attacker operators, which is listed as 3:17. I have a 9.0 KD with him, but the high KDs are due to most people not knowing how to play the defender side of the Halloween event, leaving you with mostly free kills
---
The red one with the yellow that is all shinny from year 2 is the best.
---
im level 161 with over 800 hours playtime and still only have black ice for the UMP (i dont play fbi defenders...) and one other gun that i cant remember now. :(
---
I feel you bro, I had a 0.6 k/d up until I was like level 140, now I‚Äôm level 190 I think and have finally managed to get it to 1.0, I thought it would never happen
---
the same thing happened to me, it happened during placements as well.
---
Don‚Äôt know.. what‚Äôs good?
---
Eh you‚Äôre better than most teammates, the usual ‚Äúhow‚Äôs that not a headshot‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs over there‚Äù, ‚Äúover there‚Äù
---
My drug dealer got bodied
---
Another case of it‚Äôs FUCKING BOMB NOT TDM.
---
Yeah :(
---
I tried to but I accidentally used the wrong video
---
Lucky ass I have been playing for almost two years and got nothing
---
underrated post
---
Pulse is able to provide intel in a much more versatile way though, the main downside being thats its all lost if he is killed.
---
I enjoy how frost just sticks her head on the welcome mat at the end
---
LMAO or my favorite,  "they're on window", WHICH GOT DAMN WINDOW my guy??
---
What were you doing digging in the trash?
---
Console players with the potato aim. 
---
Good clip either way.
---
Yeah
---
Yea, my v-sync R E F U S E S to work
---
First differentiate, camping objective from holding objective. What I mean by camping is staying inside no matter what, like the outside is lava or something. While holding objective means you are close, maybe even inside, but deffinitely not scared to leave it, yet not roaming.
---
Thats being said, the problem with that is, people who does this in they early stages of Siege experience, hurt themselves by not interacting with game mechanics. You don't fight, you don't die so much, which seems nice, but in reality it stripes you from experience. As a result they don't know how to lean properly, don't know how to aim, don't feel when to reload and when to switch weapon. They don't feel sound propagation regardless of how fucked it can be sometimes. They don't know map, don't know spawn peeks, don't know how to counter them. They lack any habits and knowledge you would normally get by being an active roamer, who run everywhere, fight his bests and dies for hundreds times, to finally become a good and experienced player.

Ghostbusters

Sounds like casual but fun
---
It was an old thread here in reddit, one dude uploaded a video saying that he killed frost in Yacht only to be attacked by Frost "AGAIN" few seconds later, blaming Ubi for servers being shit and so on. In the video however you can see that he in fact  teamkilled Buck, thinking it was Frost. This gave birth to the Frost=Buck meme
---
So if I post this up in three months time can I whore a shit ton of karma too? This has been posted about a thousand times and about as old news as it can get...
---
It was
---
Operators, no doubt. More gameplay opens up when you buy ops
---
Masterpiece
---
I might do that but I‚Äôll just put it on as I pick the operator. If I can.
---
Thanks, any in mind?
---
I like them on guns that don't have a lot of recoil to begin with, like Bandit's MP7 and Frost's C1.  I also use them on some attackers, because I like to randomly spray walls whenever I hear a noise, and since the silencer removes the bullet tracers, I don't have to worry about getting pinpointed because of my spray through the wall.
---
Ah yes, the "Kid Ela" spin-off we all begged Ubisoft for.
---
Not a complaint but more of a question, why are the edges of the barricade red
---
Great desk btw
---
He was trying to do the yellow drop that I can never get to work in actual games, I get it in customs all the time.
---
Yea it happens to me too. It's just because it hasn't loaded in for them.
---
Always operators, alpha packs only give you cosmetics items.
---
If you have 0 idea: lesion maestro Mira  nomad gridlock are all good operator
---
Oh yea I was confused about that
---
Shit plays straight fire though, the YEEEEEEEHAAAAWWWWW hits every time
---
I'd recommend Lesion, Zofia, Ela, Finka, Gridlock or Mozzie. They're some of my favourite
---
Slap a laser sight to it and drop shot with it
---
Vigil, doki, mav, maestro, lesion, ying, jackle, mira. All really good ops
---
Doc with red dot tell me it ain't Ranked
---
There was a 3 shot Bosg glitch, you just emptied your 2 rounds and then threw a drone with advanced deployment on then let it auto reload
---
It then would reload 3 the rest of the round
---
Bronze and PS4
---
What about the kind tea bagging given? That's the best part
---
Terrible
---
Bruh is right
---
The skill based elite animations are the best: Glaz, Kapkan, Sledge, IQ. The elites where people dont do anything of interest (mute, ela, smoke, thatcher, hibana, etc) are kinda wack
---
Tomorrow
---
There are many times when i thought about buying the eye tracker. It works in an incredible way with some games and has some cool stuff, but for the price it is too unusable for an everyday use.
---
In pro league, tho, is very cool to see what players are looking at. I think you should have it always enable, as an extra information about what the player is doing!
---
*smug energy*
---
while i disagree with the best girls part this is indeed a fantastic drawing, good- no, excellent job
---
I just experienced my first ace and clutch the other day and I was shaking the entire time and after lol. It‚Äôs one of the most intense rushes of adrenaline and fear. Congrats on that sick clip
---
Agree. This is like a window into Pro-Gamers mind
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
At the end I also don‚Äôt care much, I get the points and it gives me points. Kd isn‚Äôt as important as w/l in this game because as you said, its team based. Only Shoutout to the FUCKING LESION that STOLE MY ACE by KILLING A downed opponent when I he didn‚Äôt even shoot him once and killed him 2s AFTER I downded him. STILL MAD today &gt;:(
---
Anyone who ships Cav and Doc is an enemy of mine. Cav is my waifu
---
Excellent for getting that sweet ace
---
Imagine
---
How do they manage to keep fucking up themepark. Just throw away the whole map at this point.
---
Controlling an adrenaline rush is the key to getting to a higher level of gameplay. Instead of relying on luck (because that won‚Äôt be with you everytime) you can rely on your own skills. This would probably be useful in real life aswell incase you‚Äôre in a dangerous or stressfull situation and adrenaline starts kicking in. Just keep breathing normally and don‚Äôt let the adrenaline get to you too much. 
---
And having your heart rate sky rocket everytime you play siege won‚Äôt be healthy in the long run.
---
Hope this helps, merry Siegemass!
---
I think his head should be resistant to headshots. I mean he got a "maska-1sh" helmet which can stop bullets so
---
I find games everyday
---
Good evening BOB.
---
That futuristic look mmm, who is the leaker? I want to see if there is more cosmetic stuff.
---
Gimme the Alibi skin plz
---
I hope it never comes out
---
Literally the force-a-nature in TF2
---
Wth
---
Hmm Jackal has 2 versions, interesting...
---
Wait, they do actually work?
---
I‚Äôd give this gold if I wasn‚Äôt broke
---
*stay clear of the blast*
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm not a broke college student yet tho
---
I hadn't thought of using the eye tracker for events like this and how useful it could be. Needless to say, I want more as that really helps to figure out what the most elite Siege or competitive players in general are looking at to make a decision.
---
As if the acog wasn't enough
---
It feels a lot more consistent after the rework, but eh something still feels a little off

Imagine the K1A acog and all the amazing low recoil guns with acog.
---
Yo wait from the Battlepass trailer was a charm for Fuze which is actually called Blacksmith. That should probably mean some are from the Battlepass
---
Prime is doing Tom Clancy stuff, it makes sense if they wanna go in on that market like Netflix tried with Marvel.
---
How accurate are those stats though? When Kali first came out, I checked her stats and got ~1.3 KD despite the fact I never played her.
---
No idea mate.
---
Same with me. I have her but I don't play her and it says I have some kills with her. I'm the only one that has access to my account too.
---
Vigil. Those drones can't see shit and I can roam freely.
---
Obviously it does:

Yeah but it‚Äôs not that big of an ability, you don‚Äôt do much soft destruction or hard destruction, you don‚Äôt deal with gadgets
---
You dont have to explain that you have a Girlfriends,we're allready sad enough Virginia anyway
---
I wasn‚Äôt even in a panic... just not paying enough attention.
---
Yea it's Fuze
---
Maverick, I can make little holes and get an ace sometimes
---
It‚Äôs not dead, you just need to restart the queue after 2-3 minutes
---
The same model different colours
---
yikes
---
First one is based on the DDoSing issue which ubi reaches out to have actual accounts on PlayStation and Xbox banned, and the second one was a reddit reply, find me a picture of an actual ban issued. Xbox doesn‚Äôt even have an anti cheat, it has a toxicity system. This started as a joke and then you felt the need to downvote my comment and be an ass
---
I am (:
---
I think he should get like a full body shield with his turret but nerf the actual mg
---
Nothing really big, there‚Äôs usually one skin. Last year they gave a free dlc operator
---
frost, because of her welcome mats
---
get out of 'ere you filthy doc main.
---
Depends on which server you play on and also peak hours and off hours and whatnot. Gamers are so spoiled nowadays that they expect to be able to find a game immediately at any time of day regardless if it's in the middle of the night or early in the morning.
---
It really doesn‚Äôt. Maybe if you are in America or something but i have reported blatant hackers and nothing has happened, but its like that on every game i play
---
Hmmm actually it could be battle pass. Do mission to collect all collection.
---
Nice, thanks
---
Thatcher, he gets rid of all those gadgets.
---
I dont think so, Last year it was released in december and invitational is in February
---
Oh no I can find a game immediately.
---
But I'm not a fan of feeling like a complete failure because I'm not very good at this and ruining everyone's competetive experience
---
"Play Unranked" you say, well that doesn't stop the salt messages from flooding in.
---
Frost because I love putting traps in the weirdest places and get so many kills
---
I'm on xbox and I feel that playing against mnk is manageable, tbh most mnk players aren't that good and I always said you only need to use it if you're bad, its playing against cronos players that breaks the game
---
As someone who plays lesion, and against lesion quite often, he's fine.  His gadget is fine.... But I'm surprised his spg has never been nerfed. That things a laser ahah
---
No your good. Just wanted to clear up the confusion
---
https://youtu.be/jyII7tL59X0
---
This is an example of why frost mains make funny memes
---
Damn I also misspelled Montagne
---
If this was my match I'd be kicked as soon as it got to 1v4
---
It is Tuesday so maybe more people are going to work now? Idk
---
Ah I gotcha lol
---
I have some of the clip from it only like a 10 min segment I think we lost the game though
---
But then again there are other skins (for example the Buck uniform that was leaked and other cosmetics shown in the trailer) so maybe there is a chance they are not from the Battlepass, but no one knows except Ubi.
---
You're a real gamer if you played the whole match like that.
---
Ela, because people can‚Äôt understand how I can control her Scorpion recoil on PS4
---
Everyone got this email....
---
They mess the sound up with every new patch tbh it‚Äôll be mostly fixed soon
---
Damn it u beat me to it
---
Should be fixed by the next patch which is really soon.
---
What gamemode is that?
---
It truly made me laugh hysterically. What an infant ‚ÄúI guess you don‚Äôt care about Ela‚Äù 
---
You crack me up, say more stupid things that are funny please.
---
If everyone dies at the end the defnders win because you failed to diffuse the bomb
---
God damn your game looks clear and bright. All my corners are so dark and hard to see.
---
Wish I had enough renown :c
---
We're interro and kix? :(
---
That's a good list, thanks!
---
See you tomorrow OP
---
I play on PS4. Home of weekend warriors and children. Lol. I do need to find a team though. Time to network, like I'm looking for a new job!
---
again saying people don't play someone right even though they're just stating the characters humongous amount of flaws. That's just a sad excuse to say you're losing an argument. I don't want Ela to be different. How the Hell does wanting a recoil diamond on the one gun that doesn't have one make her not a info gathering roamer which she is? How is wanting her shotgun back to the way it was when it was balanced change what she is? How is wanting secondary gadgets that actually play into what she is a bad thing? Giving her impacts or an explosive plays into her roaming ability, a camera would play into her info gathering side. That doesn't change who the Hell she is it gives a reason to be played for what she is. Her mines again I said were lackluster. Meaning they're good on occasion, but compared to all the other traps they're really nothing in terms of useful. Kapkan mines do damage and are giant alarms as they create a lot of sound. Lesion mines are great alarms because you can see which one went off. Frost mats cause a giant bang when they go off and instantly down someone. Not to mention lesion mines also slow people and do damage. Ela mines concuss you for 5 seconds and create an alarms. That's not very effective when in terms of all the other gadgets. They're lackluster not useless, but still on the lower end of the gadget spectrum.

It was Rainbow is Magic which was a special event in April.

No because looking past an operator many many flaws and just turning a blind eye is saying they don't care. What makes me laugh is how ignorant you are being.
---
Oh my god he actually said something else. 
---
Do it again, do it again, make me laugh ElaBoy, your tears of rage make amazing lube.
---
Splitscreen baby.
---

---
This is ping not hit reg
---
nah i think its death note sorry to dissapoint
---
I like how you're breaking the subreddit rules. But go ahead please only gives me more things to report.
---
It already exists as a plug-in in twitch, I can't remember which Streamer had it but I've definitely seen it before.
---
still doesnt justify me not getting the kill just coz the other guy had 60ms ping
---
They should flash impressive bulges on the screen and show where the eye tracker goes.

There was a bit of hype over this a while ago, I definitely remember seeing some big streamers using this live on twitch. You should be able to find some vids of Shroud using it on YouTube easily enough. As people mentioned above whilst it is definitely a hugely interesting insight, it is ultimately quite distracting. To use it in replays would be ideal. Your idea of being able to turn it off at the user's end would also be great. There's some pretty funny stuff on YouTube of streamers being caught out taking sneaky glances at certain things when using eye tracking too...

Especially when we have whole subreddits for R6 porn?

Let thee who is hasn't committed sin, cast the first stone.

The entire Venetian gondola bundle has Easter eggs like this, but pasta caliber is the best

Say something else.
---

---
More lootboxes.
---
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
---
do you play with friends? 
---
If not you can even talk to the people in the game chat or text chat, the game is a lot more fun with some people and a lot easier.
---
 Try not playing seroisly, play some quick match games and try out some OP's you don't usually play, get some variation in there. Try some random stuff, hide in a corner, try to knife the enemies, meme on them with BOSG Acog. Just play how you're not supposed to.
