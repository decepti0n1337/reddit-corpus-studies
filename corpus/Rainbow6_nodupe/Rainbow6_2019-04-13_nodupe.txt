i didn't make that post because i can't play against her or smth. I ve done this post because of atrocious results she has in Winrate/Pickrate of this season. This is a damn DLC operator, which is so horribly bad i don't even understand why to buy....
---
what‚Äôs happening? are his cameras gonna be destroyed with one EMP now? are they not bulletproof?
---
are there patch notes?
---
A great author and a decent man. In the first few days after 9-11 Mr Clancy was being interviewed (probably because of the plot line of one of his books) and he was the first voice of reason asking that people remember that extremists do not represent all Muslim people. A true class act.
---
You play smoke a lot u/i-shoud-be-recalled
---
F2
---
Kanal and tower are two of the worst maps in the game. I‚Äôm sure you could find someone who could write an essay for each map
---
Parabellum on xbox and PC for about the last month. It's just one of those things that's taken for granted in general that I don't have the answer for.
---
Idk what you mean by that haha
---
The person you play is literally the biggest middle finger to shields. And if you play correctly unless they have a buddy you can easily out maneuver them or overwhelm them with a friend.
---
Does anyone know where the ghost Recon Franchise comes from?
---
It does sound bad when you say it like that, but at the end of the day the end goal is to reach diamond, and you're not gonna get diamond if you can't beat diamonds 
---

---
but I do think full diamonds Vs full P2 is abit to much, maybe if you had a play 1 and they had at least 1 plat 2 it would be fair
---
What's "legit gold"? I thought all ranks were legitimate...
---
Well he'd still be a badass either way so it could be worse. But still lame
---
Nice thanks
---
Tagged my friend because he plays smoke or at least used to
---
No lol; but the top guy on the other team
---
Boosting was using keyboard and was super toxic because I killed him every time and it just made my day.
---
That would make sense I guess. So Kanal would favour attackers and Tower defenders maybe?
---
Thx bro
---
Used a controller not MnK
---
rip tho
---
It's my birthday too, but that's not important.
---
Frost. 
---
I dont have her but ela
---
Zofia(also dont have)
---
Maverick
---
Finka
---
Maestro
---
Idk. Whatever you think is cool. Go capitao if you want. Have fun m8
---
He is just standing there...menacingly!
---
Yeah, but *why* are they two of the worst maps? Don't need an essay, just a quick explanation.
---
Idk what to say other than look and listen closer
---
What makes him the best? Sure he‚Äôs good but he isn‚Äôt amazing. His traps are countered by looking and punish rushers. And Monty can run right through, countering Kaplan
---
It took us 4 years to find this...
---
tru and my main changes pretty frequently, I don't really have one
---
Pretty sure that everyone in that lobby thought you were hacking
---
Zofia because of the withstand and her weapons + the ability to flash
---
People are telling me to make it into a cosmonaut instead of an astronaut which makes total sense and will as more soviet stuff. I might make one in the future
---
El chapo's house
---
But still play correctly and shields aren't a problem.
---
They will tho. With next season pick&amp;ban will be introduced into ranked. Also they'll redivide the ranks ( https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousAlluringLEDRiPepperonis )
---
Yep üòù
---
I‚Äôve been kicked for holding an angle AS AN ANCHOR as in one of the key things anchors do
---
Probably because I've been getting run out on every single game and Nomad is getting REALLY boring. I shouldn't have to pick the same op every round t deal with fucking run-outs.
---
Nice! thanks.
---
lol
---
I just wish monty had one...
---
It not always accurate
---
Nah. Run-outs just aren't fun. Anybody can jump out a window and get a free kill.
---
With the damage though he became a long term power defender.  Longer the round went on with a anchored lesion the harder it got for attackers.
---
That‚Äôs not a Kobe that‚Äôs a yeet
---
Again. Claymores do all the work for you
---
I think the see through smoke is cool and all but it should have limits so it isnt too op
---
Ah, damnit... I get mixed up with my youthful terminologies these days.
---
Also the frustrating part is being unable to see or react
---
It's pretty easy to counter this. Especially if you have a headset. Get_flanked also makes a really good video on it.
---
Plague doctor seems to be the go too
---
You're getting shit on but I wholeheartedly agree with you
---
Yep, some people think he's fundamentally broken.
---
Happened to me twice in a row. Once because the 3 others on my team (one left at the start of the round before we even chose Ops) ran in and got killed within 30 seconds, then votekicked me because I was breaching from the opposite side.
---
The other was when I was loading into the next match, 5 seconds after it said I was joining an ongoing game. I had just enough time to see I was being votekicked, then I was removed. Didn't even load. I am fucking l i v i d.
---
This is the first I'm hearing of this, but you have my attention. What's the new system?
---
That's literally what just happened with this stupid april event. They added a glitter skin...
---
I've been playing Nomad pretty much exclusively. I shouldn't have to pick the same op every single round to deal with one cheap tactic
---
Tbh i feel this was kinda needed. Felt impossible to get a plant down unless you had a Thatcher, Thermite, and Ash/Zofia all at the wall ready to deal with the utility.
---
Id also give Echo a slight nerf. Maybe make it so whilst recharging, the drones visible - and maybe jumping to the ceiling takes up a charge. 
---
Issue when you get really good Echos is they play jumping jacks behind cover and it takes half an hour to find it on the roof. At least this way it avoids the spam.
---
Would be nice if people actually communicated.
---
Hah. Gaaayyyyy. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Kill it with fire.
---
Is the video tucked up at the end for anyone else? I‚Äôve tried to watch it a couple of times and it‚Äôs not showing the kill.
---
What I wouldn't give for nods to the original Team Rainbow from the og book. Maybe Clark or Chavez's kid as an operator in the future(or maybe the old bastard John himself)
---
I've been asking that same thing
---
Yeet for precision, kobe for distance.
---
Because knowing your lingo I half the nade!
---
no probs, gotta look out for you :D
---
That's a given. It'd suck to lose your money and time over something dumb.
---
Maybe SS elite skin.....
---
Getting run out on almost every single round gets really tiring
---
Rainbow Six was way too long and is overly descriptive like the Goblet of Fire. I wouldn't recommend it. Many more books worth spending time on.
---
Platform doesn't matter, get whoever you're better with
---
I don't think it was. Maybe once or twice, but that's it.
---
The skins are just stupid. Like, I get people find stupid things funny, but in a competitive game that seems to take itself seriously, adding shit like that doesn't work. 
---
Not EVERY game needs to be a complete "whatever it's a game they're supposed to be stupid" mentality. Sometimes it's nice to be able to sit down and not have a unicorn shooting at you, like in CoD, Fortnite, etc...
---
P√∂lse
---
elite skin maybe? some other ops also have ww1 and ww2 themed ones. but plague doctor would be cooler
---
[removed]
---
I 1000% agree with the mag size change to her LM- er, SMG. I personally haven't run into any issues against the FO-12, however I do understand what you're saying. That fire rate is kinda high.
---
I tend to have a lot more success with roaming as I have great map knowledge. When I'm not spawnpeeking I'm roaming unless we need an anchor.
---
Probably his issue only as on my machine it's working perfectly fine, attacching screenshot below

I'm getting disconnected problems on casual and went on Reddit to see if anyone else is having the problem

didnt think about that lol

Yeah me too, just happened, me and a buddy got dc‚Äôed in a ranked and cas game

I did that too never even came close to it again

Fuck this game rn
---
Why did you post a comment then?
---
It's really simple once you overlay the new map over the original map in your mind. If you focus on the main stairwell, the only things that are new are the walkway/balcony behind the stairwell and the new staircase on the other side. On the second floor, the bedroom is still where is was, you just need to now go around a corner to breach it, this prevents the old tactic of camping in that site and making it almost impossible for attackers to come or down the old staircase. You can still come in from external stairs on the second level except there is no longer a washing machine room, instead there is a dining room I think, and the bedroom is now connected through a bathroom connector room. I'd recommend jumping into a game of protect hostage or a ranked match on the new maps and taking screenshots of the top-down OBJ views for later viewing, always comparing what you see to what used to be there and even having a second screen or mobile device with the map open as your roaming around, trying to identify features and flank routes.
---
I've had that happen before
---
Bad bot, person.... Thingy
---
Ok, didn't know that
---
Have an upvote you bastard.
---
Tom Clancy is now more of a company now written by different writers
---
Happy birthday. To celebrate one of your books has been adapted to the point a furry can gas people who are trying to save another furry on a Barbie Glam Vacation Jet Plane.
---
I know it's a meme, but the idea that they would have a "breaking news" segment about video game toxicity is funny- 5 suited/well dressed people in their 50s breaking down which game has the most people using slurs and feeding/trolling
---
Set terrorist hunt to classic, set it to house only, play on normal difficulty, and only click on the heads of terrorists.
---
I just looked and I did I had like 2-3 deaths. I still have the screen shot i'll look tomorrow.
---
This is why I tend to stick to casual. That and I‚Äôm pretty trash at siege.
---
Earlier I had a teammate that as soon as we loaded in he immediately tk'd the the team and got banned. So yeah, similar experiences
---
Can I get one with 6 rainbows photoshopped in?
---
"Oh my God you killed the other 4 why couldn't you kill Blitz? Get out of here ****** you suck."
---
Vote to kick initiated.
---
To add on to this point, maverick has to make himself completely vunerable to destroy the cam as well
---
Yeah the second one happens to me a lot. A LOT. Like votekick for dumpling join a match
---
It was a good idea on paper but there is only one exterior doorway in the entire map and it's the front door that has a plethora of crossfire angles to watch out for. In the end, it was a death trap for attackers and unless you were going against a significantly less skilled team, the defenders would win on every site every time.
---
For $1,100 I sure hope I earned it
---
This pisses me off to no end. Ive been last alive and top of the board and people vote to kick. Its just a dick move

No he wasn't

Not as ridiculous as the idea that any person at Fox News could properly name 3 video games.

---
At this point I just play casual. I got to plat last season hated playing plat a fuckton of DDOSing and tking for me. So I gave up with that and played casual
---
It actually takes off damage from you for 0-26m, only gives you damage bonus beyond that according Rogue-9.

Your comment just now made me realize how much I fucking hate ubi.
---
"How to bait an idiot"
---
My close friend also plays on PS4, and it seems like that‚Äôs where all the casual/friendly people are
---
I have quite a bit of time in, but I started to bring other friends into the game. Most recent one was a couple of days ago. 
---
It is pretty much the same cycle - get rekt, keep learning, and eventually they love the game. I just explain at first it will be somewhat frustrating.
---
i actually died
---
The older games were better.
---
Personally I can‚Äôt stand bank, specifically the managers office upstairs. I hate defending that room.
---
You do realise that that was exactly what I was before, then then changed it to spawn first because you **pick you operators based on the site, not picking site based on ops**, which is a much more logical method. If new players are making a mistake, it is our duty to teach them. The whole game can't be redesigned around new players. They need to learn and catch up quickly or be taught that, like how we were when we were new.
---
in case any1 is curious I don't think they put in the link for download (yet) unless it's a special embed not on mobile
---
It‚Äôs a better system on defense because certain ops do better for certain objectives
---
Not if you like military jargon
---
No, not your server, I meant, your in-game server, the data centre you play on.
---
Crop the image next time bro.

Nice

Sorry, I respect your experience, but this is a game with fictional fidget spinners, polymeric non-production guns, 150 round airsoft guns. Doesn't matter if it doesn't work. It is, after all, a game.
---
I‚Äôve been having weird slow down and frame rate issues with Ubisoft games this entire week (specifically Siege, WD2 and division 2). I don‚Äôt know why, just this week they‚Äôre all having freeze fest and frame rate issues. It‚Äôs not an internet issue, it happens whether I‚Äôm playing online or solo and it doesn‚Äôt happen with any other games. I don‚Äôt get it
---
September 2017 lmao
---
You're so toxic for that team kill!!!!111 /s
---
I read it a couple years back, from what I remember it was an easy read, nothing too memorable. The occasional action scene, and a rather unnecessary sex scene.
---
My old system was a 2200g 1050ti and 8gb ram, I averaged 90fps on med settings 1080p
---
Yep sure is. You play pc?
---
In game, main menu, click "escape" and see what it says there along with your ping.
---
Seas, weu, east coast, na, and stuff like that. The region of the world you play from is your server.
---
Damn.
---
I was gonna leave the match before caveira interrogated me but I realized I wasn‚Äôt a pussy and let her interrogate me
---
So you can spend 1100 on a scope but you're still playing on console smh my head head
---
I love playing with friends, but I only have 2 or 3 friends that play it almost as much as me. My other friends are too lazy/unwilling to learn how this game in played with patients and strategy

Wus??

Nooo, it‚Äôs almost like it wasn‚Äôt a meme

That explains why I didn‚Äôt understand. Sorry I‚Äôve only been using Reddit for less than a year so while I understand some stuff (like OP) I didn‚Äôt know anything about that.

But I hated your smoke ace. /s
---
As a beginner, I would play a chunk of terrorist hunt just to get some general map knowledge. I swear it's like 80% that and the other 20% using your operator and gun well.

or maybe have a drone in detention and use the info to your advantage mü§®

i'd like to see that post

Mine is that the hit registration doesn‚Äôt work, I claimed I hit 10+ headshots and the rest body‚Äôs, my friends said I missed them all, Little did they know I had video proof üòè, I did in fact hit well more than 15 headshots
---
I have a companion app on my phone with nice map layouts. Also start a private game as slegde and knock down all the walls, it's a great way to learn. In all honesty I've been playing for over a year and I'm only just learning it all, there a lot to remember. Map knowledge beats aim in this game
---
"Palha√ßo" is a Portuguese word tho, it means "clown"

Listen for the short Australians.

There are counters for all of those ops.

I hadn‚Äôt played the game in like a year other than a couple turn on/turn off and I recently got back into it and I feel like it‚Äôs really top notch. I know I‚Äôm going to get fucking slammed for saying that but oh well.

Good luck

You got this.

People really need to learn to stop bitching about blitz and learn to counter him.
---
If you're close enough to a bomb that your gun (or parts of) get destroyed you've probably got other problems.
---
I'm not, friend. No part of me is upset about OPs gaming choices.
---
ok thanks ill give that a go and what is the app called?
---
$1000 is basicly midrange for quality optics.

Back when the game launched it was so small that everyone knew each other- you'd run into the same people on PC every couple games, and everyone got to know each other. The game has absolutely exploded since then and it's only getting bigger- it's easy to be a jerk when you don't run into anyone again.
---
That being said I still run into a ton of really chill people, or people you can just joke around with. They may be outnumbered by super sweaty/angry people these days, but the kind community is still out there

Server or client ping issue probably. You know feels like there's more and more posts like this on subreddit, but i guess developers dont see this problem *sigh*.

Well it‚Äôs the shockwave that can fuck things up and when an IED goes off close to you you can survive. My bud was in a truck when they got hit buy an IED. One guy was sent flying the other guys lost some fingers but all of them were able to return fire because there guns and scopes still worked.
---
If your scope is not blast rated it can throw off the sights which will make you miss your target.
---
Watch the movie Blackhawk down or watch some clips on live leak of combat footage. Explosions go off close to soldiers and they can crash in a helicopter and still survive and still have working weapons.

Can say same thing for Ash. We need another top frager. #GIVEUSACOGBACK

Ah this HAHAHA i tested the theory with a glaz scope to see which part of the wall it hits

That‚Äôs not really a good excuse. Bipods have more moving parts and those are also attached to guns. You can buy a good one for $40.

Scopes are expensive because quality glass, precision machining, and tiny pure materials that make them are expensive.

He meant in the sense of the game and as the meme. Realistically it's not illegal in anyway.

Hold my 3d printer

lol no, you suggest in stead of 1 op to have 2 ops

you need to make underplayed ones better, not multiply op/musthaveinteamorban bsht

she's not even mexican ya fuckin cucumber.

I agree, I don‚Äôt know why but I just react faster on a console, maybe playing on a sofa with a large tv and a controller in my hands just clicks better with me, although I will say that there are games that just works better on a pc.

That just simply does not make sense tho. Plus in game can you imagine if walls just blew up silently

Clarity in low light situations.

That plus the tritium sight for low light and fiber optic for brighter day time shooting.

I had a ranked game lag out entirely, enemy team &amp; my team at the same time, &amp; we didn‚Äôt get penalized or lose/gain elo, it‚Äôs like the game never happened. It was tied 2-2 &amp; me &amp; my friends were completely confused, so we just started up another ranked game.

Hello First_Ash_Main, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bcobhr/cries_in_acog/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
PLEASE DONT USE REALISM AS AN ARGUMENT. Every pro player and streamer states it‚Äôs ridiculous to use realism to counter arguments for operators in this game. They need to think outside of the box to something a bit unusual otherwise they will run out of ideas for operators.
---
Gold old days...
---
Just a rework. Thats all it needs. A little edit. I would also settle for a new Calypso Casino from the old games.
---
I didn‚Äôt say anything was going to save you when you‚Äôre stationary. Where are you getting this from?
---
On the move, during a fight, it‚Äôs not uncommon for weapons to be damaged by gunfire. You need it to be able to survive more than a couple bullets.
---
It would be unbelievably op and would just feel wrong and wouldn‚Äôt work with the game mechanics and the way sound works
---
OK?
---
WhY ArEnT yOu UsInG A ScReEn ReCoRdEr?
---
This is weird, dude. Do you read the things you type like at all and understand how they fit into context?
---
I mean everyone should play what he prefers to play on. And yes you maybe will be better than someone on a pc with a k and m but they are probably bad. Still everyone should play what he prefers.
---
Can you also explain where I get my two GIANT metal walls from? OR explain how the downing mechanic works, those are far more unbelievable than a gadget that makes explosions quieter.
---
For map knowledge I had to force myself to get out of my comfort zone and manly roamed for almost an entire season. I learned a lot from my many mistakes
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
Not really but ok
---
Lol then you have no argument
---
But M+K are objectively better, along with higher resolution, mods, individual replaceable parts, higher frames, etc...
---
It doesn‚Äôt work with the game mechanics and would be very op
---
\_Ubisof  wants to know your location\_
---
Move to asia its less toxic here lol
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not op, the idea itself would need a lot of tweaking to be inline with the game, I only have a problem with dismissing it because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù
---
Mvp goes to IQ's coochie
---
I do live in Asia but since it takes longer for me to find a match, I play in wus, holy shit the toxicity man.
---
Notice the /s pls c: I was sarcastic lol
---
It will become an endless chain, s i guess i don't care that you don't care that he doesn't care.
---
(Its also a great way to practice tenses)
---
You‚Äôre lagging. I can see the number when you flash the board...
---
Hearing about the state of the community was one of the main reasons I steered clear of League in its heyday.
---
You can get cheap trijicon knock offs at Wal Mart for like $300-400
---
Thats the anti crouch spam fix if im correct, and you got rekt by it
---
Do people actually believe he was playing while looking through the actual scope? Lmao.
---
Most of the R6 community are braindead kids, sadly. 
---
Best solution would be to find some people at your skill to play with. It's not that hard: r/r6steams, official Discord server, adding Randoms you liked playing with.
---
Agreed
---
You don‚Äôt have to take it but my suggestion would be to practice aim/recoil control/flicks/aiming head level as much as possible on your own in t-hunt everyday. Then in games work on your game sense like when to flank or when to push or when to be aggressive/passive. But if your aim is above subpar then you‚Äôre already on your way to becoming at least plat 3.
---
Not sure if long range would really be viable on most maps but that definitely is an interesting idea!

Maestro isn‚Äôt balanced, why would gridlock and mozzie need a nerf, gridlocks already getting nerfed.
---
Maybe don‚Äôt tk
---
No it's all sound based, there's no marker, every player can hear the phone go off
---
She makes people's phones ring.
---
Maybe someone here knows, I personally can't remember, what a scope my father has. It looks like an acog with the fiber optic but the power can be switched from 1x to 4x with a lever on the side. It was the only one I've seen and I believe he said it's worth 2-3k if that helps.
---
k
---
Oh, I see. 
---
Thanks.
---
standard Minecraft uhc : all your team has iron armour and their team has 3 iron armours and 2 diamond armours
---
this is like an easteregg for new players who have never played old Hereford.
---
Like if you remove his gadget people won't play him.  its the gun and 3 speed combo.
---
Yeah, shitty map
---
No memes
---
For shitposts, go to r/shittyrainbow6
---
I feel like the high pick rate is due to the gadget, as there's no other op that can do anything similar.

doc took him out

I‚Äôm gonna miss Lion lighting up 22 terrorists at once when he gets the nerf

read the sub rules

Actually this one is from Grim Sky, sorry.

Upvoted just because of the blow torch kill, didn‚Äôt even need to watch the rest of video
---
Boosting
---
What an alpha!!
---
Someone got shit on in casual lol
---
Try me lad
---
Did you buy that? It costs like a 1000 bucks
---
You kind of need to play R6 to understand.
---
Wow ACOG‚Äôs are expensive, have my upvote
---
I just wish they would give us the win delta sheets for others ranks for a comparison.
---
He was nerfed because he was not being used as a plant denial operator exclusively. As the evil eyes are/were bulletproof people used to put them in crowed attacked-sided areas so he gave you the information a Valk could. Also he could do things Echo couldn't like destroying thermite charges, drones etc... So they nerfed him to put him in the same spot Echo is right now, this means we are not getting another plant denial operator this year.
---
Yea but those are garbage, buy once cry once. A real trijicon will last you a lifetime (except the tritium) that can get replaced though.
---
They don't call him the butt bandit for nutting.
---
Wait... all of you get ACOGs? My whole company (Army) only has enough for every other squad leader to have one. The rest of us use CCOs or irons.
---
It's coz of windows update. Roll it back if you can.
---
I unironicaly love this map, when I first started playing it was in my rotation all the time, I learned so much on this map
---
Haha, I‚Äôve already developed this stand since birth, I call it, _‚ÄòZA ACOG!‚Äô_
---
It used to. Was removed for exactly that reason.

---
Yes this would explain his MASSIVE pick and ban rate at pro level. Oh wait, that doesn't happen at all you fucking spanner
---
I thought that too
---
Most times if I‚Äôm votekicking from the grave, it‚Äôs not my goal to actually get the person kicked. I‚Äôm always solo queuing and I don‚Äôt talk since my mic doesn‚Äôt have a mute button other than removing the mic piece and I don‚Äôt want people to hear me breathing or talking to people around me or any of that stuff that annoys the shit out of me when I‚Äôm playing. So I have minimal ways to communicate and I‚Äôll hit someone with a vote kick if I think they‚Äôre doing something incredibly stupid and I want them to reconsider their decisions.
---
So you mean that the old map data still exist in the game, which means they can easily bring it back without worrying about "data limits" because it's already taking some space( i usually thought hereford in situations is half map, the rest is not completed for the matter of space, but no)
---
I am going to be honest, if you need a scope to use your rifle for "self defense", it likely isn't self defense.
---
Because fighting toxicity with toxicity is a good idea
---
Some ACOG variants are for ‚Ç¨1570
---
How is he not forming an opinion for himself there??
---
Even though this is technically shitpost, I‚Äôm going to answer your question anyways.
---
The answer is no. No, as long as you aren‚Äôt claiming to be the person in your profile picture (Assuming it‚Äôs a real person.)
---
Truly balanced...
---
Based on MTOE
---
Just because one guy is trying to vote kick doesn't mean you have to use the word "community".
---
Count the amount of times this situation happens versus people NOT voting to kick the last player alive.
---
all of them are correct, skyscraper, themepark, chalet and kafe also shouldn't be in ranked
---
I got you three ways.
---
1. See if the char interest you. If so, buy them. If not try the 2nd or 3rd way.
---
2. Figure which class you enjoy the most. Personally i like to be soft breacher or entry fragger which means i would go for buck, ying, zofia, and etc before every other char like maestro or capitao.
---
3. This is what i normally do. Go down the list, buying the atker then defender.
---
I already have frost and Hibana but I quite like playing with cameras.
---
Reported.
---
I feel like only one armored operators should have access to the ACOG scope for both attackers and defenders.  The only exception would be finkas or capitaos LMG cause Fuze and Gridlock also have that.
---
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology?
---
It was all just a big bait to get Nomaded
---
Put your phone down
---
it just evens out all the sounds, night mode makes all the high sounds such as gunshots, or explosions a lot quieter, sometimes to where you can't hear attackers breaching and such whilst hi-fi makes the high sounds louder, theres a video by rogue-9 explaining which one you should use 
---
but imo its all based on personal preference/your headphones
---
Wouldn't it make three armoured operators much less useful than those.
---
Okay, who the fuck thought that Maestro was "OP" and that he needed a nerf ?
---
Like, his cameras can be destroyed by nades, breaching charges, thermite charges, Ash charges, grenades, Sledge, Zofia grenade, Maverick, with almost 100% guarantee to have at least 1 of those operators around. If you have trouble with an Evil Eye while breaching or planting, just watch it. And being jammed by Thatcher and Twitch for a good amount of time (around 10 seconds or so). I've never thought that Maestro was OP while playing as him and against him and i've never seen a person say: "Fucking Maestro, he's so OP!!!!"
---
If you want an operator that really breaks the game, go for Echo, his stuns instantly deny plants, they're invisible, highly mobile, they regenerate their stun indefinitely and the stun duration is ridiculous even when you retreat back to cover and stay still until it fades.
---
Sure, Maestro can deny plants, but you actually have a chance to plant successfully if you shoot the camera or just have enough HP to survive the shots and even then, the Evil Eye needs a direct sightline on the planter. With Echo, you just get on your drone and even if you don't see the planter, you can just move and deny the plant with 1 click, even if you get on your drone late.
---
I‚Äôve been plat 3 before. But fell into silver playing solo with idiots. And I go like 16 to 3 and they accuse me of deranking :(
---
fuck i meant 3 armored 1 speed ops ahould have acog my bad
---
I think it had something to do with it not being balanced. I loved it though.
---
Just another day of people not knowing screenshoting is a thing.
---
Omfg, this is the way we can have ash acog back!
---
They said I could not throw it and make it more useful.
---
Ping should be 20 or less at least to not have lag issues like that.
---
this game is hella weird when it comes to fps ive experienced several issues but the best fix i can give u is uncapping the fps in the gamesettings.ini file
---
The crazy guy said it like there was some sort of balancing irl
---
#Jinkies!
---
Aerowolf showed up massively the first day.
---
damn, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. it‚Äôs honestly really heartwarming to see someone go to such lengths to make someone happy like that though. üôèüôè
---
Modern problems require a 1200 dollar solution.
---
Ubi chill
---
Is this real
---
I'm too high of a level to know for a fact, but I would think that the newcomer playlist is full of smurfs who enjoy stomping on new players to make themselves feel good. You might have a better experience in casual.
---
ikrrrr
---
Because people enjoy guns and find guns interesting, if you‚Äôre gonna have a self defense tool then enjoying it would be good. Plus a lot of the stuff talked about in this thread isn‚Äôt complicated or hard to find, so he could‚Äôve just looked it up or he could be an actual soldier or special police that has used these things.
---
I'm getting a lot of "Papers Please" vibes from this
---
Who even looks at profile pics in this game?
---
Fake or real, shit is funny
---
Looks really cool. Is it functional
---
This doesnt relate to siege at all
---
What guys? The drug dealers?
---
Da heck
---
Yeah to works in water and land water as boat
---
Yeah by Bluetooth and is an amphibious drone

Daaaamn how long has it taken to build it

Not intentionally I would imagine. It really is broken right now, so use it while you can I guess.
---
Real ones remember when yacht before it got re put in the game
---
Broski, this breaks the community rule of "no ragdolls"
---
It is made from styrofoam and with and works by ardouino I have video of it in action
---
Mozzie is going crawl up her ass to destroy her.
---
Ew ifunny
---
I mean you do get a pop up explaining what‚Äôs going on this month with this event.
---
nobody ever says that he's overpicked, however you can't say looking at your wrist for a second and making the whole enemy team stand still or they get a live red outline shown for 3 seconds isn't frustrating or not overpowered
---
I think it‚Äôs an Oregon trail Easter egg
---
Your mom should have aborted you
---
Literally just you out of millions of players.
---
Where‚Äôd you go? I know you see alla these you weirdo
---
Retardedddddd you‚Äôre so retarded *sings in Beyonc√© voice*
---
Tmw you match with the only guy playing siege on the international space station.
---
That‚Äôs when you put a hole in his back
---
What area of the country are you from? I‚Äôm from Iowa and have terrible queue times. I have friends in Cali and Maryland and if we have them be the squad leader we usually find games in under a minute. Presumably because they‚Äôre closer to larger portions of the playerbase
---
Yes he was. His mechanics were changed once and now they are being changed again
---
You dont even know. Gun hobby is expensive.
---
Yeah it takes no skill to make this
---
90% of the time, 'vote to kick' is used, in my opinion, improperly. New/Unskilled players have a hard time playing the game, because as soon as they try to they get kicked out because they're a low level or because they're not 'good enough'. Too much negativity in casual matches, that's why I avoid them.
---
You hate to see it
---
Yes, this is frustrating and overpowered but the way he got nerf is too much. And by looking the graph, he's actually the 4th worst op in attack
---
Garbage even other people think so üòÇ
---
Bros didn‚Äôt even use photoshop cause he‚Äôs too broke lmao
---
Broke
---
Annoying/fun. It was a ridiculous map but i loved to play on that map, it had so much personality &amp; different ways to play.
---
Have the Siege Invitational back instead of the Newcomers playlist
---
He‚Äôs lying to you, cause it‚Äôs trash
---
I 100% agree, this content is shit ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
---
That‚Äôs a very good question.
---
This man got 21.3 upvotes for every dollar he spent on that $1.1k ACOG.
---
It took you 30 minutes to make this piece of shit ? I could do better in 2üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;Tachanka Main
---
Obviously you‚Äôre trash
---
Yes this is before the nerf but look at the graph he's the 4th worst operator
---
Exactly you‚Äôre trash fuck your day
---
i second this
---
Do you understand how an acog works lol?
---
That guy is a dog shit player. He queues with low ranks to boost to diamond and then drops to copper on EU to boost his stats.
---
Simply  not true. It's not the gadget  it's the gun. If you put the 416 in any 3 speed def operator it will get a similar pick rate.
---
Sorry just asking because all of the other diamonds i talk to must think its weird because they are Beta MnK users
---
Guess taking away acogs will become the new norm for Ubisoft. Just because an operator has a high pick rate/ win delta doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre overpowered. (Jager for example). And to most of the community the operator chart mean nothing. It would help if Ubisoft monitored the pick rate and win delta of operators in PL, not ranked period, they‚Äôre too many off putting factors in ranked compared to PL, but I digress. There‚Äôs nothing we can do but bear witness to Ubisoft endlessly nerf every good quality of an operator into oblivion.
---
I‚Äôm tentatively coming back after almost a year long hiatus, a major contributing factor of which was the toxic kiddos
---
I thought you wanted all the smoke??? Where‚Äôd you go?
---
What happened to this map
---
Exactly
---
This guy is almost certainly using something to slow the CPU and make the game take forever to load and try and get the other team to leave.
---
My guess is for the more legitimate cases of people having older/slower hardware the game doesn't kick anyone at all during the loading phase and only does when the match is actually being played which end up allowing these kind of exploits.
---
Still went positive though
---
MnK ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Are u better at controlling high recoil for single shot guns or are you better at consistency with recoil.

It‚Äôs sad that this took you any effort, I could do this in my sleep

I was gonna say you probably have Down syndrome but that would be an insult to people with Down syndrome

This is a wholesome post, no doubt.

But I have to know, how bad was the response time on that screen?
---
Its rainbow six siege. Your welcome
---
Welcome to Seige. If you want to prepare yourself better, I'd recommended going to Chernobyl üëç
---
In all seriousness, I agree. The game is in a sorry state, I'm also on console - PS4 and have been playing from pretty much day one. From what I know PC is only worse
---
100/10 would have tkd him
---
If not for it being a dick move
---
Den for The ammo wasted (not that much already on that one)
---
Your teammate didnt have to push. No chance of re fragging because of it. But good flank none the less.
---
Alright I‚Äôm done commenting on your shitty posts lmao, let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôre weak ass reply is next week üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
How to restore your faith in humanity
---
People dint pick him often as a gentleman‚Äôs gesture. If one team picks him then so will the other and then he‚Äôs played every round.
---
Same with a surrender in ranked. 3 out of 4 wanted to give up since i was last ans hadnt been doing very well. Ended up getting an ace and winning the game. Always give people a chance
---
Yeah it doesnt really get better. The longest I've gone without getting tk'd for no reason was like 2 days on xbox. And that was amazing.
---
Oof. This is the two sides of it for me. I wanna be the first one. But usually I‚Äôm the second...
---
Removing acogs isn't a nerf IMO, I run reflex on the F2 anyway
---
But ma fresh tritium..!
---
Sell your console and play on PC. 
---
Console is dead because of the toxic community.
---
Yes and when they pick Lion, they instant win the round (look at the graph).
---
If what you said was true Lion would be a Overpowered Underpicked operator
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much of a need either. But it has worked with ash and since this recent twitch buff they‚Äôre going to need to nerf her some way.
---
Shhhsshhhhhh don't tell the Devs
---
I hate ash so much
---
There's a new version of premiere which is free and looks really easy to use. Or if you want something similar to the paid premiere but without the price tag you can try davinci resolve. They have a free version and it's supposedly similar to premiere. Or you could just torrent premiere and hope you don't get a virus like me
---
Nope
---
Are you like a silver/gold lion main or something? His nerf is needed for pro league and it's need at the very highest level.  He is overpowered and on console I bet he is also overpicked.  Also consider that PS4 is the largest community of Siege players.
---
I personally have been trying to decide but I am more efficient with the acog
---
Hey even tho it's meant for the son, these kinds of nights are important for a parent too, it probably means a lot to be able to keep his mind off his issues for a bit.
---
That tells me nothing. Try explaining it.
---
You legally blind
---
Max sneak: holo, angled and suppressor
---
Long distance sneak: ACOG, vertigrip, flash hider

Guaranteed no headshot: ACOG, angled, suppressor

No sneak: ACOG, vertigrip, comp or flash hider

Just try a bunch of combos and see what works

Yeah naw

My best runout (when tryharding in solo casual) was on Bank. I did the Alley runout and actually managed to ace it. My teammates were very happy about that and decided to congratulate me with a kick. Sadly I don't have it cliped :(
---
Thanks! I'll do ;)
---
oh wow if he shot it would take around 18 hour to reach the server, must‚Äôve been a long game
---
That is so cool. I didn't know that. Thanks for the tip.
---
You can destroy a Twitch drone with an evil eye a lot easier than you can destroy an evil eye with a drone.
---
He has only been nerfed one time and ppl still complain about him
---
It is. I've tried it. It's really fucking hard. It was a cool experience, but I'd never do it again
---
The bitching and complaining i hear on the daily. Absolutely amazing.
---
Your aim was shit
---
Yep. That sounds like siege alright.
---
That's why I quit. Too many kids and people who can't handle life. Plus CoD and BF are losing their player bases.
---
Yea I think it‚Äôs new though
---
Well then idk what that could've be
---
Aiming is so much easier when you use your whole arm instead of a stick. Recoil is much easier to control with a mouse. It‚Äôs also much easier to crouch/lean spam during gunfights
---
Then you would be able to plant with a needle in you, which would get rid of one of the gu's functions. To stop plants.
---
Will you fuck off already? You did a good thing, good for you. Are you that desperate for attention that you have to post this sob story that sounds like it came straight out of r/Gamingcirclejerk on two different subs?
---
I play claw, my heart was racing lol
---
What map is this?
---
You are slowly showing us your house
---
Shit, I've got about 50 saved up, I'll keep count on them as I open them and maybe post it.
---
You‚Äôre deluded, no one gives you attention so you seek it through pretending to be good at a game by cheating
---
He then disconnected at 100ping
---
I always figured that on PC, because you can talk to the other team, there'd be more toxicity for BS kills or being dumb
---
No you don‚Äôt get it
---
What is ISIL?
---
Sometimes you can just tell when someone is genuinely kind. Have a good day, stranger!
---
I never got a black ice until this one, except frosts because I had her elite skin
---
I moved to PC to get away from it. Atleast on PC, cheaters actually get banned.
---
My friend thought of an idea where you could cut the line and just fall. Any fall damage you take would be the repercussion.
---
That's probably because all of you guys care. Sadly it seems here in Silver/Gold (thanks for the ego destruction) that's less common, in my experience at least
---
Fake image no doors in rainbow
---
At least a hey smoke stop dont do that would have been good and then he could explain why not to block that hole. Easy enough
---
At which rank do u play tho
---
No, capi, clash, castle
---
Oh, I could already see the input lag.
---
Cheating in the devs opinion too
---
Fuck yourself
---
they're probably all in palestine anyway
---
It‚Äôs inherently faster than a controller and easier to handle which betters your accuracy by a mile
---
Yeah I play console too. I personally would recommend lowering your sensitivity a bit. For example the first shots on Buck you keep strafing back and forth over him but can't actually stop on him and land the shots, that's a pretty good sign you're sensitivity is too high for you. I'd lower and try to slowly work your way back up and make sure you can actually control it. Not trying to be man or anything just trying to help.
---
Nonetheless a sweet clutch.
---
Hmm.. I guess contact Ubisoft if you can login your Uplay account and ask them to update it. (.com)
---
So 3 ?
---
They're operators my dude
---
Let me get your parents.

Her drones sound like Helicoptors, and are so shit now. She will never get 2 unless players are so oblivious and play with no sound

Ah good. Someone gets it.

Or for, you know, gaining an unfair advantage over other players by circumventing the rules.

I think she doesn't because operation Black Ice launched before operation Velvet Shell did

With a couple posts you could probably fill that place with people cheering him. The Internet is sometimes good.

So why are you using an inferior product?

Great job

We need more people like you in this world.

Snitch nigga

Operators frost and buck and all before have black ice. Weapon skins released before a new season will be available for the current season and past seasons.
---
How often this is posted I doubt that anyone could forget
---
Only original operators and Buck &amp; Frost have black ice.
---
Very nice
---
I don't even know what to say to that.
---
When are they going to release the lion rework
---
Ah good times
---
I might aswell use the 50. Its below average but still. I know i want the muzzle vert and acog on that, for close range just whip out the pistol
---
Only the original operators, Frost and Buck have those skins.
---
Black Ice was the seasonal skin for Operation Black Ice and was only brought back because of it's popularity and to boost the promotion of the Alpha Packs.
---
ok thanks, ive hardly even played house so i didnt know kids room was so limited to maneuverability.

Pretty good, well ordered words though.

---
I‚Äôd throw in a few bucks to make it happen
---
A weapon that even satan is scared of.
---
You are a **Legend**
---
Looks like someone's triggered. Why should he leave the country for simply disagreeing with the political views of an author? Using your ridiculous logic, people like Martin Luther King should have left the USA instead of complaining about how Black people are treated in America.
---
I expected to see skyrim
---
Nope you won‚Äôt be able to buy past year passes but past year ops can be unlocked by yearly bundle like the year 1 op bundle and year 2 bundle and so on
---
‚òπÔ∏è this guy does

Heyy rainbow is pretty toxic, lets make it even more toxic by pulling the racist card and say that there are just 3 black operators
---
The best words
---
Bear.
---
Sick drawing wheres the own Wilson nose tho
---
depends how you define black.
---
Hey guy, I checked and didn‚Äôt see it posted so I figured I would karma farm, welcome to reddit.
---
If true sounds like a great birthday party idea or just to enjoy a movie or two with some friends (I'm sure a private viewing of a movie still in theaters would cost a lot more since they probably have licensing fees to pay as well)
---
Toxic siege community  (about 98% of the total community) wants to know your location xd
---
Thanks
---
Alibi also. Lol why does this matter?
---
Woah calm down there I was just wondering no need to be angry
---
This game plays best with a squad of usually 3 people tbh
---
It does not I was just wondering
---
That almost drove me off
---
Ight thanks
---
Thanks for the info
---
by yearly bundle do you mean they release the bundles yearly? I checked the store and can‚Äôt find it
---
Lmao didnt know this was a thing? That's brutal.

Sounds like something might be interrupting the switch inside the mouse.... Are you hard on your equipment, or is your desk dirty?
---
If he doesn‚Äôt need a nerf then why mention him above? And he absolutely does. Doks ability going off at the right time just forces you to become better at gun fights.
---
Bruh really? I‚Äôm just saving up for Maestro and now they‚Äôre about to nerf him? They keep nerfing this to in the name of balance, then pretty soon you‚Äôll only be able to kill with melee (an exaggeration but still)
---
Think you mean r/wholesomereddit
---
and if i put it from another perspective this is a house in Oregon, there are fanatics in this house, its a building filled with fanatics in rural america which kind of fanatics do you think most people will assume live there.
---
What resolution is your monitor
---
making a mistake while trying to train for **the special forces** is far to easy so lets say that finka wasnt on some mission and kapi turned against her.
---
I get why people do it and all dat don‚Äôt get me wrong I often did it myself earlier in year 1 but for me I hate to see it becoming a main tactic because for me it destroys the meta of the game. I mean ofc everybody can play how they want to and I ain‚Äôt wanna upset anybody it‚Äôs just comments on Reddit
---
Again, the place is based on Waco, but the terrorist organization. Actually now that I think of it, there are no racist or hateful symbols on Oregon. So I‚Äôm still confused how you came to that conclusion.
---
Also, saying that just because someone is religious = racist seems a whole lot less tolerant that any liberal thinking you have?
---
He‚Äôs already banned in pro league
---
You have issues bud
---
It‚Äôs funny how you post this then your profile is full of toxic ass run outs hahaha you are just salty you lose gunfights. It‚Äôs a video game it‚Äôll be fine.
---
You're right. But I'm not going to be truly happy with ranked until they can separate your rank from your team.
---
Gg
---
Just like the good ole days
---
This is beyond science
---
It was legitimately the best gun in the game.
---
A laser accurate, 1200RPM good DMG pocket sniper with ACOG.
---
I don‚Äôt hate theme park per se, it‚Äôs just getting really stale and I don‚Äôt like the colour palette of it and Hereford
---
With specs like those you can run the game at any setting at 1080p, but if you want the highest frame rate, I recommend that you follow this guide-  [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567777265](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567777265)
---
Her gun jumps horizontally pretty wildly. 1250RPM and only a 25 end mag your crazy lol
---
Does anyone else think that rainbow should be even more popular than it is
---
I miss Oregon I haven‚Äôt gotten it since last season
---
They do fix bugs all the fucking time if you read the patch notes.  People act like Ubisoft do nothing at all it‚Äôs so fucking stupid.
---
I wish that kid the best hope he keeps on fighting, cancer always affects the best of us.
---
Me trying that out grenate bounces back and kills me .
---
Then again, it‚Äôs also really toxic. I‚Äôve run into at least 3 groups of discord buddies just trying to ruin other people‚Äôs days. It‚Äôs pretty pathetic honestly.
---
 Yey
---
kind soul. we had bostonbearjew being honored to this day and now someone that also is unfortunately also dying. thumbs up!
---
I keep getting tower kafe and consulate
---
And online on console too. I can't stand it.
---
It‚Äôs a D-day museum so
---
I recently moved to PC and I regret not making the move earlier. The game is so much more enjoyable.
---
Lucky
---
Monstrocity is the wrong word for these bad boy
---
Lol no those maps are booboo with the exception of tower
---
LEAK: Ubi brings back acog
---
community increase by 100%
---
r/nothowdrugswork
---
oooo okay. looks similar. 
---
...although i haven‚Äôt played in months.
---
He isn't giving up. He's fighting this, he's beating it... for sure!
---
Normally I say fuck tk'ing but this, this was alright.
---
GODS weapon
---
They won‚Äôt be stopping anytime soon, the plan on going to something like year ten right.
---
Technically we have maveric and his tiny blowtorch
---
No idea.Contact ubisoft support
---
short story bandit is undercover cop that joined biker gang now?
---
This is how it happened for me and i thought i just had a slow reaction time but i went and checked back the recording and he never popped up on my screen but i still died
---
You're on PC, why not ask him to stop?
---
Happened in couple of matches just that didn't record them.
---
Ummm... i think you mean jager
---
Has he tried unplugging his season pass then plugging it back in?
---
Ho2 do i know that Hells angels are Bikers? But i see yur point
---
To me it‚Äôs because your teammates are trying to get you removed from the game because of your play style. It‚Äôs only toxic when your getting kicked for a dumb reason, like playing an anchor, not rushing, or picking an operator you want to play.
---
good al' memory!
---
Just post "Doc/Rook's ACOG is op" or "Caveira is op" and see yourself getting downvoted into all eternity.
---
I mean most of the time when I complain about hit reg it's because my aim is trash, but this is like next-level "What the fuck is happening?"
---
Dude. April Fools
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a legit problem.
---
I miss old herebord and Bartlett U
---
I legit started playing nothing but casual so I can leave when I get those maps. You could cut those three in half and make a good size map, why are they so big?
---
Peeking in the window above front door of House with this baby.
---
He‚Äôs contacting support right now, but if that comes to no success, i‚Äôll tell him to try that. Thanks.
---
Thank you

If we can get some nice opinions and discussions in the comments that would be nice. :)
---
Why did the sledge aim like a terrorist in the kill cam
---
what are you trying to say with this?
---
Best thing is probably to do a complete restart of the xbox
---
o7 good luck to your homie.
---
wow so funny.
---
Not on games that dont allow it. Like R6. No, its too easy aiming with mouses lol.
---
it‚Äôs a free cosmetic. quit complaining about it
---
Hello Umbrawolf9, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bcur84/blitzmensch_joins_team_rainbow/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The only reason why Theme Park (and Villa for that matter) is a good map is that half of it goes unused. 
---
If the bomb is on drug side, nobody goes haunted side, and if bomb goes on haunted side, nobody goes on drug side. If you do go on the other side of the map, you either have to go through 2 small doors or train, meaning you can't just easily late flank every round. 
---
Meanwhile, Hereford and Fortress are just a super big and tangled mess of dozens of small rooms and a million hiding spots for roamers.
---
Wait that's illegal
---
The amount of times you could just peek and beat a Glaz with a secondary was hilarious
---
Why did you put down a barbed wire directly on top of another barbed wire?
---
Sir, u speaking whit copper 4
---
The dude deleted the post. That's all the proof I needed.
---
I just got killed through the door
---
f
---
Agree
---
you can't tell? make sure your PC monitor is actually running at 144hz lol, a lot of people just plug in a 144hz monitor and think they have the 144hz by default
---
i use the reflex because the recoil is less severe effect with it
---
What‚Äôs to explain? It‚Äôs a simply 3000 IQ setup.
---
Yes, but its extremely difficult and Mira literally can act as 2 operators, maybe even 3.
---
Fun isn't something you'd consider while playing seige
---
Mira taking skill is one of the funniest things ive heard, her gun is insanely easy and placement is obvious.
---
I tested it on CSGO lol, it‚Äôs a hell of a difference. In siege also, but when I put it in 60hz sounds exactly the same, I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm running it in 120hz or something like that
---
I don‚Äôt think people should complain about chat toxicity. Otherwise pc is better. I‚Äôve never been killed by anybody for no reason in 600+ hours
---
Niiiiice
---
Hey, well would you look at that, I'm also a davinci user. I would highly recommend it as the features that come with it for free are incredible.
---
BUT
---
It is a very intensive program and won't run well at all on PCs which just have integrated graphics. (If you play siege on pc then I guess that wouldn't be a problem)
---
üëç
---
Potato mode engaged
---
I think there is a bug in the refresh rate in seige after the latest patch.
---
just put your in-game settings to 144hz then and it should be stay as that as long as you don't change it. even if you put it in like borderless after and it says its locked at 60hz, still moves like 144, I can tell the difference personally
---
I believe that's a burst blood vessel, and that does happen to people and it can stay forever or gradually go away
---
what‚Äôs the point of posting this
---
That's not quite bloodshot
---
And the old recoil for every gun
---
This map and theme park are instant leave games for me. I can't stand either of them.
---
Day one players, how good was this on the smg? Stupid good? Never used it haha
---
Or maybe your internet is garbage? Or maybe your mommy and daddy was watching Netflix.
---
Casual
---
You played Ash. So you dont deserve Plat 3.
---
I‚Äôm more of a soft roamed, playing valk and lesion, but I am focusing on learning every op, so that I can play a variety of roles. Recently I have been playing Vigil and having a blast.
---
You have my blessing young one
---
Hahaha yup.
---
Siege on Mac lol
---
Very cool kanye
---
That's even worse
---
You didn‚Äôt give us any information, how are we supposed to know?
---
Which shitty games? All Tom Clancy games are good and very successful.
---
Season pass?
---
Literally all you have to do to stop a rush is hold an angle on the entrance to site.
---
What did you use to print
---
Why would you choose any other location though? it would spawn you the closest and you could never get spawn peaked
---
What are they doing exactly? Popularizing his name with successful games? I'm pretty sure he'd love to see it.
---
But think about how op that would be to just instantly drop on a hatch on some maps and just start spraying
---
Its ABS plastic
---
How did you get the jager main tag?
---
*best Hereford
---
Removed completely because people didn‚Äôt like it
---
Maverick. And technically, Buck does too, but his has an XM26 on it.
---
Why do the coppers always do this?
---
I miss Acog SMG11. My friend who only played Smoke stopped playing about a month before the Acog got removed. For that month I fell in love with the pocket sniper.
---
I only know how to do it on mobile 
---
Go to the main page of the Rainbow Six subreddit, tap the three dots in the top right corner and 'change user flair'
---
Really? Don't your clothes give of a thermal signal if they are touching you the whole time?
---
A really big fu*king boobies coming right up
---
Looks like mold
---
PC
---
No i already get some from that,  at the end when it totals up my renown, there is a part that says Bonus Event. When I win I get around 140-150 extra from it.
---
I don't know if they patched it yet, but if you play the "No Intel" situation (Thermite @ Kafe), he still has grenades.
---
I mean I would have during obviously
---
But u saw him go trough the hole as the guy was still creating said hole, den look at the guy and den reinforce that specific wallpart first. It's obv trolling
---
I have nearly the same setup as you, same issue. I don't understand why it would out of nowhere just start stuttering.
---
Sorry to disappoint man, i got busy with my last semester project (mini-thesis? Not sure how to call it in english lol) so yeah...hehe
---
This almost makes me want to play Blitz again
---
This almost makes me want to play play Blitz

Sweet
---
If you don't rush the building and actually use your drone like intended rumours become easy kills for attackers.

On a trackpad?
---
You don't lose as much mmr if the enemy average is much higher than yours. You also get a shit ton of mmr if the enemy is significantly higher. Like 60 instead of 30
---
I ducking died when I saw it

should've been at least 1080p, not sure why it's so trashy
---
Maverick.
---
Before he put his helmet on I asked if he missed his ACOG
---
He just gave me sad eyes
---
This is really good, do you make these with a program or something?
---
When me and my freinds play, we turn our brightness down to around 5 for those hiding and 10 for the seaker. This makes it more fun bc everyone has trouble seeing and jump scares are around every corner. If you want to you one farther you can invert colors and burn your eyes.
---
oh shit you're right. Lemme just put my drone on every window and door on the map and I can make sure I won't get killed from run outs at the start of each round. How silly of me
---
That would mess up the game they would be better adding a healing attacker
---
