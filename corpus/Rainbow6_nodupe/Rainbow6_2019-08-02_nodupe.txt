Epic gamer moment

This is probably gonna sound rude from my part, but I have the least intention of being rude.

---
But neither of that is a solution to the issue, that just pauses symptoms. We don't ignore serial killers or pedophiles, we arrest and prosecute them.

Yeah on the bomb. Didn‚Äôt choose snackbeard btw... auto pick üòÖ

Cool. :)
---
Unranked bc I got a new job and can't play much anymore :(
---
(4-1 in my ranked placements and at 3500mmr accounrding to r6stats though)
---
Ranked doesn't have night time in the map pool anymore, and for whatever reason the mist is there at night but not in the day.
---
DID YOU JUST *DISRESPECT* THE DP-28
---
Why don‚Äôt bully her brother again.
---
Why Frost looking like some grandma
---
Bitch that my Pringle
---
Oh shoot, I didn‚Äôt realize it was DansomeWoja at first
---
He shot through the shield, I was at 100 health
---
*instant pistol shoot when someone tries to knife you*
---
Yep I think so
---
I was doing this trick in WoW 10 years ago.  And in warcraft 3 15 years ago.

Blitz is good to ban
---
Get you get a $10 chibi or a $20 chibi?
---
Yes I know so
---
Fix what that‚Äôs honestly pretty balanced
---
Blessed, thank you
---
That's what I call missed opportunity.
---
A skin like that should be used by Hibanana.
---
They are
---
It‚Äôs actually sad. I lost like 200 mmr just because of this.
---
F
---
Blitz' shield is not impenetrable. Assuming you hit the shield in the right spot, the shield will not protect you. But per the video, your head was visible and that is where he shot you. The bullet tracers even show the position where the bullets came from. Again, completely legit kill.

Yikes

 Seems useless compared to Jagger, but with our opinions and suggestions we can define improvements  
---
\-the damage reduction was not said, but what if the grenade damage was only 20 when inside the capsule?  
---
 
---
\-What if he could intercept more grenades than Jagger's device?  
---
\-maybe bulletproof capsules?
---
even thinking about the loadout  we can imagine some balancing

You should try staying ads when pretending to be an alibi, Cus your alibis are aiming down by default

Just cause cod has something doesn't mean siege should too. We aren't a direct competitor to COD, and even if we were, the format is very different.

Yeah, I know what you mean. Maybe when we get them, if they're a lady they can be named Zofia. Or maybe Nomad if she's a trapster

Yeah, fictional guns is one way they can get around the whole "licensing" fiasco for new weapons. still would be nice to see a galil variant of some kind in this game though
---
That would completely break their functions to begin with....and the community would fight It so hard, exactly as you said they arent picked often, but they are easily countered as well, finka boosted, headshot em  dokabe calls, mute jammer lion scan, dont move.......easily countered I see no problems.......
---
What's the update from Ubisoft, let's see them juicy screenshots.
---
NSFW tag this
---
the tachanka meme actually does serve a purpose. it shows who the people who aren‚Äôt old enough to play the game are
---
They denied it just read the email like a few hours ago so I went to battleye and appealed to them.
---
Nope. If RFF is active you can only kill yourself with a C4 and can't anyone else
---
Thanks for this, wonder what that device is on the female ops leg. (maybe the grappling gun for the attacker? or it could be the device to activate the fire canister on the shield for defense)
---
The game is 5000 times more enjoyable with these operators banned.
---
Ye say what ye want but mine lord is living
---
Not as OP as lion from pre-nerf
---
Your post history says otherwise, gold ii
---
No, your teammates are still affected by explosives
---
It's called an interrogation for a reason.
---
Well you are in a casual so i don‚Äôt see why it matters
---
So did Star Trek, but the concept still existed.
---
No it's not? Lol wtf? I scan people all the time from the floor below it... I use the shotgun to open up floors beneath them, scan their footsteps and unload the shotgun on ping... I get 2-3 easy kills like that without fail... THIS IS HOW YOU PLAY JACKAL...
---
why is this getting upvotes? And people here are always talking about how horrible toxicity is I mean look at username it's literally bullyingcoppers so he's ruining other people's experience and you guys are fine with that
---
Ah nice
---
Dope shit man. I'm still missing most of year 2 and all of year 4.
---
Maybe as side project but I kinda wanna do the operators first
---
We surrendered
---
Instead of complaining I just make shit of like I ended up throwing cuz I was bored but really I just watched YouTube and  qued so I played with very little care and then lost
---
Doc?
---
They have to stop drop and roll within 10 seconds or they die

There are different circlejerks with circlejerks about the circlejerks. Doesnt mean one sub will collectively circlejerk about one topic unless its a really small sub.
---
Exactly what I was saying to him. He called me a mouse and keyboard and I hate false accusations for a real problem. Yes I admit I got a bit fired up but as a pretty decent controller player, that has put so many hours into the game, it slightly offends me that there‚Äôs a good console player and they‚Äôre suddenly ‚Äúmouse and key.‚Äù Just because the aim was on point...
---
This post isn't flaired as creative. Besides, you posed it as a question, not as a suggestion. Chill out.

You sir are an intellectual

Thats basically cap on defense. Nothing too hard to balance.
---
?? You can piss off.
---
Yeah fair enough.
---
Thanks, that'd be great. I've always found t-hunt more fun with others than alone. I'm going to take a break from it this weekend and next week but I'll go back on next weekend.
---
I'll pm you regarding gamertag :)
---
so... smoke would be useless. this idea is also super broken
---
Heh, imagine? I wouldn't constantly be on a downhill slope from gold to bronze
---
It's a thermite charge though. The whole idea of it is that the thermite melts an outline through a reinforcement and then the main charge knocks a hole in it. 
---
It's not just an extra powerful explosion or something.
---
Yep, I get them now and then.  
---
Sometimes I get tons of purple/golden (epic and legendary?) skins in a single day--then spend a month getting repeat commons. I know it's random, but the timing doesn't help my superstition.
---
How my mom look after I went back to sleep when she called me to wake up twice
---
Legit just a smoke buff..
---
Jager?
---
You now you can be banned if you do this.
---
Well, you're a lot better than I am. And alright cool. I'll pm you regarding gamertag.
---
I'm going to take a break from it this weekend and the next, and then I'll go back on next weekend.
---
What about the knife acog
---
Yes let‚Äôs give her a congratulations
---
Nice one
---
And here we see the wild Drone, in its natural habitat.

That‚Äôs so insulting to the other team

Don‚Äôt forget about the acog acog

There isn't an OP attacker in the game currently. Each serves a purpose, none of them are broken. Some are annoying to deal with but there is no easy way to succeed at R6S
---
Acogs are for wimps
---
It's just better
---
I would say jackal but he gets banned all the time in ranked. Maverick or Hibana is a good choice for hard breach. Lion and Dokkaebi for sweaty toxic play. Maybe Nokk? Those are just some examples
---
I meant op as in operator
---
Yeah, I realized that an just edited my reply. My bad mate.
---
Well now my hand size is over 7 so I discard down anyways.  We playing MTG now.

Turn audio on for a better notion of how many shots he misses.

Sure! Taking breaks from the game is a good strategy. Just let me know when you'd like to play!

I meant op as in operator, sorry for the confusion

Only on certain surfaces. You can't do it reliably on all sites.

Your only true purpose in life is to take a bullet through your skull when I decide to fuck up the game for everyone.

well, if you mash b hard enough anythings possible

What your account
---
I‚Äôm talking about if you think you knifed somebody but it didn‚Äôt register.
---
My internet has been slow lately so i put it on the second to lowest graphics settings
---
Yeah, it's beyond me how Ubi and Sony let people commit crimes on their platform/game with no reprecussions. Sucks.
---
Surely it's avoidable, they're literally ddosing the server, not the players, I've literally never seen it happen on any other games, it seems like the servers are just not up to scratch
---
How
---
Go back to call of duty.
---
yeah and that's not the knifes problem lol, changing the animation isn't gonna fix it
---
Pass
---
I HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS SKIN FOR MONTHS 
---
But still happy for you ;)

E
---
Yeah? Got them twice in a row, we got defence firat 3 rounds first game and smashed them 3-0 until they crashed servers, 2nd game is this one. Honestly it's way too common nowadays.
---
:EchoChibi: Time
---
Echo time
---
My brain hurts trying to understand this one
---
Good job
---
Yeah high gold/all plat is this way and are you 5 stacking
---
Yea and he was just tryna let his gun hug me. He is actually very nice.
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been playing since release (level 270) and still don‚Äôt have Black Ice for any of the characters I main ( Jager, Bandit, Mute/Smoke, Rook/Doc). The joys of Alpha Packs...
---
out of all the guns in r6, the sten is most satisfying to hear

Samual L Jackson

His name should just be Indy

Wasnt she the side chick and he got sick of her he dated ying
---
We can completely halt pushes by ourselves. Stop banning us!
---
something something drugs
---
Great job!
---
Nah, was queuing with my mate only.
---
No one ever gets arrested for it, DDOS people literally boast about it with their actual identity on show, nothing happens, over the past couple of years I'm seeing more people DDOS in general,
---
Whats your psn i dont have mic but i play okay
---
Jack Ryan spent time in the field. And I‚Äôm going for a generational type thing not exactly his current age. But even then an older dude can still hold his own if he needs to. Sam Fischer is 62, 47 is getting up there he‚Äôs like 55.
---
She was a side chick
---
 you know you can have fun in the game without ruining it for someone else.
---
Cool, my PSN is Grufikz
---
Level 104 wins no black ice
---
Level 104 and no black ice
---
Yall can woooosh my stupid ass over this but im not getting the joke. Is it referring to the old hostage glitch?
---
i get thats big gay but u asked for it by not using your damn gun.
---
Ohhhhh i know you, you can go fuck yourself but this was actually funny
---
K once again my mic is pretty bad and im 15 (dont scream im 2 years too young) so i dont talk much
---
I have 3 jager black ice
---
Yeah, that's the problem since the gov't doesn't give a crap except when it affects them. Which is reasonable because after all the attackers are just kids in their mothers' basements cheating in a game.
---
Roll for perception.
---
Haha no worries boss, I'll send ya a message later today and we'll que up
---
Ubi will start releasing news about the upcoming season when it starts to get closer...they usually drop after a tournament...usually (eitherway youll know when its coming)
---
Well its the only fun I have problems with, other than that I am pretty consistent when shooting
---
Smurfing has its place, I personally have one purely for solo queue. Whereas I have a main for when I play with friends. The issue is when people abandon 60 games a season to purposefully stay in a rank far lower than they should to ruin the experience for newer players or players who aren't as good at the game.
---
Repost
---
They do. each season goes on for 3 months. 
---
Officially they do online videos/posts regarding the new operators, maps, changes give or take a 3-4 weeks before the new season. 
---
Also the Technical Test Server will get the new operators and maps for testing 2 weeks before the release of the new season. 
---
Then if they dont find any major bugs on the TTS(Test Server) they'll finish the release date for the new season and release it.
---
History shows that live action movie based on video game is mostly bad idea. It involves different parties of people, who are not connected to original project and due to different limitations usually always goes to gutter.
---
Yup! Happened to me enough times on ps4 playing siege. Its like 98% of the people who play siege are fucking retarded
---
Op being an asshole is incredibly subjective. He has like 2 videoa where he actually teamkills someone / gets someone teamkilled. The rest of the videos are funny.
---
Hey me too  one of my smurfs i dropped from plat 2 is enjoying gold 2 right now with my double digit kills per match losing then winning then losing.  Im carrying like a madman on crack.10 plus kills per match . 9 lost 9 won . Im just hopping some of these plat 3s in ever one of my games can at least drop more than one kill. There needs to be a plat 4 rank to even the plat skill gap out more evenly. 
---
NOTE- i lost my plat to stressing servers while we attack to run clock out . Impossible to counter.
---
I mostly meant that you should games that seriously, as in, learn to take jokes. Don't get mad about everything in game.
---
Cool guy zone
---
sometimes they squad up i had a game where there were 4 afks or sometimes peaple dont relize
---
I meant surrender
---
Give her jagers carbine
---
Probably the one where it shouldn't lol.
---
MeatyMarly approves
---
Tachunky LMG acog
---
I‚Äôm new to siege, what did he do? Is it a chat exploit or something?
---
TBH, did you ever try to jump with 10 kilometers of internal wiring?
---
Plat and i believe there was one diamond. Hard to remember
---
I dont think making her a 3 speed is going to do much. She needs a weapon change and/or a major ability rework. 
---
Cause she was made to counter the intel meta on defense (echo, valk, Maestro, BFcams) but the issue is that not gettting detected is not really a counter. 
---
You can try to sneak in all you want but any high rank team will also keep their eyes open rather than just being on cams so you'll have to get into a gunfight with a sub par gun even using defender gun standards. 
---
Also she doesn't bring any team based utility like other attack operators does. She is a Pure frag operator with a subpar gun atm.
---
Dang
---
No u
---
Sometimes people kick people because they dont want to wait for the loading or and when your the last alive and holding a angle you get kicked you have to make them think you know what your doing lol so toxic
---
Aw
---
Ssh, I'm aware my MMR is super low, I've accepted this and plan on improving it in the next season as I have better hardware now.
---
I understand that part, but this guy was playing like he was trying to get into some sort of pro league team ... in casual.... on secure area, like most of his games according to the stat tracker shows he was average except a couple of games where he goes like 10/5, 6/1, 10/0
---
Honestly, anything to do with terrorist hunt, Ubisoft won‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs a mode for you to practice and that‚Äôs it, if they are there afking then leave the game and they won‚Äôt be able to gain renown Cus the game won‚Äôt end unless they are playing timed game modes, but even then it just means more enemies for you to practice on, you should be able to play terrorist hunt or secure the hostage solo on normal difficulty with ease, if it‚Äôs defend the hostage then join another game or play solo
---
To stack or not to stack.
---
Hell naw, it feels good lol
---
Pure skills no luck
---
Probably trying to rank up as quickly as possible to get into ranked
---
Not gonna lie, I checked to make sure it wasn't my gamertag. 
---
I've made mistakes. I've been hurt by them and have hurt others.
---
Can‚Äôt be that disastrous, you won
---
I hope that some changes will happen in the beginning of S3. I am tired of waiting for mid-seasons till obvious balancing decisions are done....
---
Same boat but I only got 76 mmr back. Since I‚Äôve definitely played with some questionable people.
---
Thank you
---
You know that de rank probably happened to some other people on the other team and they had to sit through that game to ultimately lose? But yea the elo you earned because of a hacker is far more important.
---
I don‚Äôt know this game. 
---
Can someone please explain what I‚Äôd happening in the video?
---
I'm slowly making progress myself. Currently I have 170 hours on the game and I have 17 attackers and 15 defenders. It takes long to unlock everyone by just playing, but no way am I paying money to get them.
---
Get DDOSed , 3 day ban. 
---
Game crashed and you tried to rejoin but get put in another rank game ? 3 Day Ban. 
---
Game Crash on match point? 3 Day ban. 
---
Great idea mate, nothing could go wrong with that.
---
i felt your fear lmao.
---
It‚Äôs vintage, you uneducated barbarian...
---
You put game crashed twice.
---
But nothing is wrong with that.
---
2 different issues. 
---
Game crashing at the near end of the game will result in you not being able to rejoin in time and getting a ban.
---
Theres another bug that just puts you in another game if you try to rejoin.
---
Soon this meme could be made with doc and rook.
---
The description of Lesion's smg it's open bolt, meaning it can't have the +1 when you reload with ammo still in the magazine because it wouldn't have picked up a cartridge
---
Holy fucking shit i gotta try that
---
Makes sense
---
Diamond
---
So both do the exact same you cant join thank you for admitting it
---
Is that a JoJo reference?
---
God damnit you said it first
---
Good point
---
Peaple
---
And the first
---
outstanding move
---
You don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a non-issue
---
They‚Äôre saying that two different things happen when you‚Äôre kicked, the three day ban would be bullshit if you get kicked last minute of a match
---
Well, Mira is there too but she has the vision advantage from her gadget.
---
He is lying.
---
Ye, what with the MP5SD having the ACOG. Plus, damage/fire rate is the same as FMG-9, so stat-wise it's completely fine, AND, AND, you get a grip attachment.
---
I got that and my friend is a mute main and I have less than an hour on him

Yes he was
---
M870 if you don't trust yourself to kill the enemy on the first shot, SASG if you do. I generally run SASG too.
---
Somehow managed to get it into double ot then they crashed the server
---
Big fucking F
---
I think his panels are fine as is, his gun just needs a buff.
---
Castle, Mute, Pulse. I am unable to play because their guns have no hit rego/damage. Wouldn't mind a fire rate increase on the UMP and MP5K.
---
I guess he turned over a new leaf other then playing on an alt account. No way anybody could be Plat at that low of a level.
---
Don't worry, I personally am using pistol over that SMG. Now this...this is blasphemy.
---
Yes, it's a possibility. Though I don't want to accuse him. I just think it's weird what his gf posted in her stories. With weird I don't mean that he faked something, just that there is missing some info.
---
As an Asian, I would to ensure you that Solo Q in Asian servers are not that hard.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The hard part is the language barrier one.
---
Yes, Japan and Korean players probably do not need to learn English since WJA and EAS(?) are located near them which becomes hotspot for them. The one you should be worried about is SEAS which connect multiple countries in SEA which has different spoken languages. Because of that, those type of players thought that their teammates also speak the same language as theirs for example, Indian and Thai which is really spotted.
---
I had one time teamming up with 4 Indian players (They use the VC to talk to each other in their language). One of them was like giving callout to me but in Indian, I have no idea what the heck is and ended got myself killed. And then, he finally use English to scold at me like WTF man.
---
ye ik you see it my luck with randos are trash so i have to get a 5 stack
---
ACOG: Echo, Maestro, Doc, Rook
---
No: Tachanka, Warden, and Mira (who at least have wide vision advantage).
---
Actually, I placed plat as soon I was allowed in ranked games. But I also wasn't queuing with copper level players to get there. This guy got there by exploiting the game.
---
No it's not it's a flash bang.
---
Unless they added a new map which was completely dark it would be pretty useless.. Seems extremely situational for very specific spots on certain maps. Very rarely have a problem with not being able to see people anyway though.
---
First  of all  that window is not random as the player should know you are lingering in that area (read my first comment carefully why the player should know).
---
Second, you can hear if someone is approaching a window and putting up charges.
---
Thrid, when you notice someone puts something explosive against the window, you shoot the window and not kiss it. If you are the type of people who likes  to get fuze charges shoved down your throat, we'll good for you I guess...
---
F lol
---
do you know what a fucking joke is
---
Well it wasn't this ridicilous in the past.
---
The thing I usually do is just breach and spray an entire room with the saw and don‚Äôt stop and get around 4 kills a round if I catch the enemy team off guard
---
Wow, that‚Äôs impressive. When I played ranked for the first time in Para Bellum I got Bronze 3. Twos seasons later I got to Gold and have been there ever since. I got real close to getting Plat this season but I got unlucky and lost a bunch of games. Getting Diamond probably seems like a cruise for you then huh?
---
there's a big difference between bronze and gold 1 - if you're 1 game away from platinum when the season ends you can basically say you are a platinum level player despite not hitting platinum that season
---
I have never missed that once? If I want to play a 3 Speed with shotgun I play Hibana.
---
I think Echo just needs 1 drone with only a few charges. I mean, he isn't game breaking but just kind of annoying to play against. My team usually bans him anyway, but I don't really remember any recent games lost because of Echo.
---
Still needs a nerf to his drones I think though. Is just a pain and boring to vs -.-
---
I would like to see a different gun for n√∏kk, it won‚Äôt happen but I can dream. The fmg-9 just feels like a air-soft gun when I have the suppresser on, and I just don‚Äôt think it does that great at medium range engagements.
---
Yeah, but her gun is a bit too underwhelming, tbh. Just look at the top post in this sub. (The "poor Nokk" one)
---
Making peek holes in reinforcements quieter than making punch holes in soft walls will always have a place on the team.
---
He's a rusher, hard breacher and hard breacher support.
---
No, it's the middle one
---
That‚Äôs the base look for one of their ops.
---
Yeah, at least give us a gun that can actually be used with a suppressor. I understand no ACOG, just need more damage.
---
Nah it‚Äôs a CZ P-09 in Roni configuration
---
Yes. I believe after 10 posts everyone knows now that COD rips off Nokk a bit.
---
Exactly, I just feel like I have to get too close to the enemy for it to be effective.
---
Thanks :)
---
Aqw
---
In the op vid she has a shotgun... did she leave it in the basement?
---
Im confused, I wouldn't want to peek in ranked, casual would be the only time to practice it...
---
If that was meant to clear something up it wasn‚Äôt a good job

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
You always want a hardbreach. So he is a hardbreach.
---
Open hatches and walls. He also gets a good gun, flashbangs and makes murder holes.
---
He is close to a top 5 attacking operator.
---
Basically your team should be playing some form of combo of Thatcher/IQ/Hibana/Maverick/Thermite you can then reduce/add operators as part of strategy developed between your team‚Äôs strategy on specific maps as well as likely defense locations.

It‚Äôs pretty simple yet beautiful.

Lol, they stand like 4m Infront of you and don't aim for the head y it's basically impossible to miss a headshot at that distances that was some seriously bad aim there, how long have they played FPS games? For 30mins? Lol

Must be nice... I‚Äôm level 180 got my first black ice skin two weeks ago... ashes 2nd pistol... not even the good one. üôÑ
---
RIP what? Check your privilege.
---
He can be. Depends on if the guy playing him knows what he's doing. I play in mid and upper plat and he can still be annoying. Monty is more annoying imo tho
---
Lol being a Nokk main since release only made me realized every achievement I‚Äôve done could have been done by other Attackers more efficiently in general. 
---
Ubi‚Äôs own data shows her to be the second worst Attacker in the game. With Glaz buff and upcoming new Attacker, she will easily hit the first spot if left in her current state. 
---
Pro player like Kanto called her a troll pick and that she will never be picked. Another pro said that she won‚Äôt replace anyone in the team comp. 
---
Regardless of me being a Nokk player, it‚Äôs hard to deny that she needs some adjustments.

5,000 hours of CS:GO and 1,000 hours of R6. I'll be honest with you here CS is the better game but R6 is fun. Try not to get addicted like i did at first and quite CS because you'll never recover in a decent time. :'D
---
I kind of wish they never added N√∏kk or Warden. They‚Äôre garbage and I wish they‚Äôd just wait and add new characters instead of these recycled ones.
---
Honestly though of all the issues, boosting is kinda the lowest issue one. Ddosing and cheating are way more frustrating and out of your hands. At least you can best boosters if you play well
---
ioi
---
Just make casual like ranked without the mmr and the more competitive map pool it will just make it more fun imo as well as give new players an idea of what ranked is like so they are prepared for the ranked experience
---
Fakk u Fakku
---
Pretty sure Warden has an m4 mag pouch as well
---
Wtf
---
So why does Bank have stacks of foreign money despite being in the US? In the vault, it has foreign stacked money on tables and shelves and some scattered US money piled on the ground. The design of the map clearly is supposed to be part of a chain of other banks in the US, so I'd expect them to have stacks of US money for their customers. Before you go like, "Ubisoft is just reusing old models of money stacks," you can find stacks of US money in Theme Park stored on a shelf.
---
But I want to play shitty maps in casual. The time is 3:30 for a casual which is a challenge for newer players already.
---
Maybe you should take the game less serious. Some people are satisfied just playing casual and don't nee ''the ranked experience''
---
Whaaaaaat
---
Well getting used to a low sensitivity and flicking to walls and door frames helped me build muscle memory, also alot of thunt and just generally playing
---
I will say this once, I will say it again: If you turn off the text chat, this game is 100x more enjoyable.
---
you do have a point
---
I didnt mean it was all luck, and I'm all for discussions when they matter, but it's a 30 second clip I thought was funny so I posted. If you dont like it ignore it
---
rood
---
1-people will play the same site over and over making the game boring
---
2-Why you want to make casual competitive ?
---
these downvotes are real
---
It's all preference although breaching that window was a little weird
---
it's a great skin but the R4C also has way too many skins, maybe put it on a different gun
---
That's pretty dope.
---
we'd all love to, but most console players have a PS4/Xbox because they don't have the money, space, or time to set up a PC build. sure would be nice if I had a PC tho
---
Or just call in Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf.
---
Ooh, a crossover!
---
tf was maverick doing?
---
really? let it be please
---
it's just a gun template. i didn't say it was exclusively for the r4c. i've no idea what weapons the Peruvian operator will use. but point taken i'll use a different weapon next time
---
The standard has been set very low for them in this subreddit.
---
oh ok good advice thanks... i never really try to flick to door ways and walls
---
thank, glad you like it

That happens a lot, reep for your friend!

Every game is repetitive. Facts! It all depends on how much you enjoy a game where it feels fresh over and over again. I know r6 has many flaws but i enjoy it after a 1000hrs. Never played any game even half that much.
---
i think both mira and jackal drastically changed how the game was played and would agree, warden is painfully under powered and too situational.
---
i only play classic thunt
---
I don't like battle passes, the paid element is crap
---
*cries in weeb*
---
Yes because it's the only competetive somewhat realistic shooter on console. We don't have CS.
---
I stood there for a solid 1:30 minutes and they didn't seem to run out of ammo. Actually an interesting experiment though
---
bold of you to assume 24 people can coordinate and not just reinforce base site and leave rooms around it with windows available for breaching
---
I mean a free one with exclusive stuff for season pass owners
---
Probably 20th August on tts and in 10th September on public. Cuz mid season patch was yesterday.
---
Do you have the feeling that anything is op? Besides Ela's shotgun.
---
This is kafe. Room next to train. The softwall between the two rooms where the fireplace cutout is
---
It‚Äôs because of the rarity
---
do you think it will be a faster repeal or normal speed?
---
Yeah, maybe with the new Game. The only thing close to a story is theArticle 5 thingy which actually is intriguing until you realize it's only a glorified bomb scenario...
---
They are not the best season ops for sure but not that bad,However they started to struggle about creating new ops.Cuz its hard to think new features after 40 ops
---
Where the attackers were getting killed is the balcony they stand off of all the time peeking that window.
---
Nah m8 c4 teamkill ftw
---
R6 could be saved if it did these wacky things every now and then. 
---
Random monthly events each 2 weeks off of a mode like this or maybe "Attackers defend, Defenders attack" stuff. It wouldn't take much effort I'm sure, and its entertaining.
---
go prone on my face
---
Good question.
---
Normally when/if I can play Blitz I always drop 2-4 kills a round
---
i didn't receive this update
---
Trueeee. Thats why i said super easy. Thunt isnt hard but it makes it even idiot proof if you use those three. The terrorists literally cant do anything. And if they get caught on electrical walls they just sit there and die.
---
The pick and ban has been hard I had 42 hours on echo
---
I think they do have their place in siege, especially montagne (but I‚Äôd agree some of the others are... questionable)
---
As tachanka and Monty main I would say YES and No at the same time
---
You know, I think I am gonna save all these types of posts, and every fking time someone posts another one of these I can post a chain of like 20 different posts all about the same thing in the span of a month
---
People just reinforce everything they see without thinking usually, in such amount you'll have entire map reinforced even by roamers that just ran away during setup... also people learn very quickly to cheese shit when they observe it to be effective and requiring little effort.
---
House ACOG
---
In the end it will fuck you up and you will take a break for months because these fuckers start writing all the time. Even when I headshotted one guy and 2 of his friend from the same window. And still I was the noob. At first you don't care but after a while it get's you.
---
I really have so much more fun since I just blocked strangers from writing me.
---
ummm i think black beard with a face shield in a game that is revolved around headshots is pretty dumb
---
Hell ya. Jackal changed it nicely for roamers but his can be a little op at times and is annoying to deal with. Im also not great at the game. Ive seen people use themselves getting pinged as an advantage but i always get annoyed when im tracked. Hahaha.
---
it will be faster than a rapel hook line Nokk's concept showed it saying "fast and quick", I assume she'll be able to zip up a window pretty quickly too as well as a hatch
---
That and it's likely she has new positions not just upside down and turning another direction
---
They give you alternative to going in prefiring everything, so why not?
---
Shit you're right. I might use that now.
---
On Normal difficulty, 20 are meant to spawn in at the beginning, and either 2 more spawn outside on hostage or 20 more do per wave on defuse bomb.
---
On maps including and newer than the Hereford rework, T-hunt maps have been broken so that bombers never spawn inside the building (but can spawn in reinforcements) and a seemingly random amounts of regular ones don't spawn in. On new Dostoyevsky, the one that don't spawn in specifically glitch the enemies remaining counter in t-hunt classic so that the match ends with up to "4 enemies remaining" still being shown
---
Perfect. This means Favela can finally be balanced.
---
I usually do too. Just when im with friends and we go for ubisoft challenges or something that may require using a defender on thunt
---
Probably doing one of those challenges wherlp you have to use a wiimote or something
---
**Chuckles in Maverick**
---
Please do!
---
I see the toxicity is siege extends to reddit as well!
---
Your flair is pretty cool dude!
---
ignorant downvoting faggots slit your throats
---
j√§ger‚Äôs obviously...
---
I didnt know there was a push to mute, thanks
---
Nothing wrong to see here /s
---
totally, their lack of counters is what i think really puts them in a place of borderline op.
---
This guy triggered me so hard I just needed to give a lil respect bump to you.
---
SHALL I PLAY THIS GAME THAT LOOKS BORING BUT I WATCH AND I'M ON THE SUB TO ASK IF I SHOULD BUY IT.
---
Hmm no most people here hate R6, we're just here to make sure it get's the hate it deserves.... /S/S/S/S/S
---
I hear this kind of sentiment a lot and have often thought there could be a lobby for dudes like you and I. I feel what you are saying so much. Your time is precious and when you finally load into a game the group of 4 shitbirds that are in a squad on your team start blasting your gadgets and TK you. How many times have you been the only one that didn't vote to kick the last man alive on your team just because your team mates don't want to wait? There should be a lobby where you have to be level 50+ or so to avoid smurf accounts where people with super low rates of vote to kick and TK only can get in. Sort of an alternative lobby you know.
---
I was waiting for a Bomber to run in and blow them all up
---
Yep or having the controller set down in a way the trigger is pushed and the second you spawn in you are unloading a clip into your teammate.
---
#Good mornin' Logang what's poppin'
---
But they do have counters on most maps, it's more of a map design problem when there is no good angle to sidestep shield (especially relevant to locations that are on edge of compound).
---
You (a non-intellectual)
---
"Never played it, watched enough to think it's repetitive. Will come to the subreddit for it where all the fans of the franchise are and in theory would be very pro the game but ask them for an unbiased opinion to revert my somewhat negative opinion that I already hold and if anyone asks me why I think the game is repetitve I will argue and say it's because I've seen about 2 hours of the game but I still won't make the mind up for myself and ask for fans of the game  on the internet to tell me yes.
---
Me (a midly more intellectual person)
---
'Facepalm'.
---
My answer
---
No, don't get this game cos you'll be one of the toxic people! Have a nice day!
---
Next patch they will nerf her even more and take away her knife too.
---
He saw [redacted]
---
i need that black ice
---
Not going to lie to you or myself: it was 100% luck.
---
on ***most*** maps.. it shouldnt be like that in a competitive game.
---
That was more than unfortunate
---
What I meant is your first comment had nothing to do with the post
---
Jesus
---
how the fuck did you get footage of me?
---
I can agree with top floor, the staircase are the worst part about the top objective. 
---
Any other site is a no from me though, you can play vertically on every site except dining and there are plenty of places to breach with Thermite. Basement is actually a pretty basic site in all honesty. 
---
Top floor is the only rough site but that isn‚Äôt enough to warrant it being removed, other maps with advantageous top floors, Bank,Theme park, Consulate, even new Kafe does.
---
I assigned my mouse buttons as those weird keys in the Logitech software so the game didnt know that those weird keys I assigned were my mouse buttons. The problem before was that when I just clicked my mouse button to assign it nothing happened so I came up with the key idea. Idk if I explained it that well lol.
---
That was all pretty dang smooth.
---
Most of these arguments could be made for New Hereford.
---
&gt;runouts for days
---
The balcony is is a runout magnet, the staircase, the north side runout... I could go on.
---
&gt;defender sided basement
---
I will give that the basement of New Hereford is a bit easier to attack that Old, but overall New Hereford is more defender biased, especially the top floor that you admit to being shite. 
---
&gt;destructor walls that could be destroyed which gave attack easy opportunities to plant
---
There are significantly less impactful soft walls, but basement, first, and top floors are still a soft wall nightmare if the attackers get their act together.
---
One time I had to delete and reinstall skyrim for it to work, I would suggest that but I'm honestly not sure
---
Funny? yes. but soft pp? yes
---
Usually you cant tell an accent from normal text but this is an exception
---
If there was a cheater in the game, on either team, and you one, you lose mmr
---
Why is this on reddit?
---
If I‚Äôm rushing I use finka or buck, sweating I‚Äôm taking maverick or blackbeard.
---
3 max
---
Honestly I'd prefer Fortress to get taken out hate that damn map
---
We hella lost against a waller
---
Does a 4K count as an ace if there is only 4 people on the enemy team throughout the whole round?
---
I straight up complained for the first time for 3 days straight and then said on the final day "watch me get one today after days of complaining..."
---
LMAO
---
Not as epic as your name
---
Unless you‚Äôve got a group to play with I think copper is genuinely hard to get out of since there are so many trolls, smurfs, and people that leave after they die once
---
I played against cheaters, won, and lost MMR in my case.  
---
It was a bunch of games in a row of the chat glitches
---
Finka is really underrated
---
I think that was his point.. S I L L Y
---
This thing looks nuts! Is it worth the price? Bit strange that the keys are all just numbers. Do all games recognise it ok? Im newish to PC gaming but I like the idea of a joystick for leaning. I often fat finger when trying to lean and end up reloading or opening up cameras.
---
Yes
---
When i say runout I mean spawn peaking. I don‚Äôt have a problem with runouts since so many ops make it harder for them these days (Nomad, Gridlock and you know a claymore.).
---
I don‚Äôt really understand your last statement there I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just retarded or reading it wrong.
---
One site does not make a map overall defender sided. Basement is fine (seek my other replies to see why.)
---
Swear this meme gets posted at least 2-3 times  a month.
---
It‚Äôs pretty damn balanced.  It‚Äôs unfair for you to keep the elo you gained while playing with a cheater, just as you would think it‚Äôs unfair that those playing with a cheater keep their elo.
---
Well, maybe one of these days it'll work. What do you know...
---
I‚Äôm on and off about it. Sometimes I like how many angles you have to hold but sometimes it can be a shitshow.
---
A game you play with a cheater, doesn't matter which team, is always going to be completely nullified. The game will take any mmr no matter if you lost or won.
---
That second knife tho... Commando perk I see...
---
The amazing strat of not barricading the room shown in full effectiveness
---
You obviously haven't seen me play
---
K I‚Äòll give you 3 hours to DM me a clip of you getting a knife ace whether it is ranked or casual :)
---
I also used to misspell this word. What started helping me with this one in particular is to remember that the root word is ridicule. Something that is ridiculous is worthy of ridicule.
---
I think map voting would actually be pretty cool.. They could introduce it on TS and if most people like it or want that option, something could be worked out. I think it'd be pretty nice.
---
Not going to happen.   I'm not sure if the team is tiny, or they just don't care..... But uni has proven they don't and won't give the game the attention it needs, which is sad seeing as it makes them so much money.
---
The games basicsly on "do the bare minimum to keep people happy enough to spend money" mode.
---
Why would they take away elo if I lost?
---
I got muted irl
---
If you lost it should give it back
---
2 knife hits to down bit not out
---
I play mid-high plat and I did mean to put IQ B tier.  Capitao still has shown no impact in my experience however
---
my worst map is skyscraper but I honestly just hate fortress nothing wrong with liking it though
---
Oregon is presented like base for terrorists , with all painting outside and how it is surrounded by vehicles.  Plane looks expensive, with conference rooms, so its pretty famous hostage scenario. Theme park has drug lab. There are maps without explanations too ofc.
---
Yeah no tho, especially not through dry wall, the sledge would go in and stick.
---
You need to buy a second copy i think
---
The first shot hit mira‚Äôs visor or whatever it‚Äôs called, not sure about the rest
---
I think they do actually
---
Thought they did but know to avoid it at ~~all~~ most costs cuz I'm pretty sure bombers can tk and I've made a few tk with bullets
---
It depends on how you hit it.
---
thanks!

Ok thanks I will do that

Dead? You hear someone in obj 15 seconds in to a round do you think it‚Äôs attackers? And I know I did. I also killed 5 people in 10 seconds. That‚Äôs pretty dope.
---
Woah kid should I put soap in your mouth clear that shit out. I am open to reason but not when a person can't read the description i'mma change it right now for you
---
The first hole you make with maverick is quieter than any other hole you make, so use that to your advantage, your job is to flank in secret, drone out obj if you can, figure out where someone is anchoring, maybe a maestro or echo on their drone behind a shield in front of a reinforced wall, easy kill for you. 
---
With smoke, your mostly an entry denial character/time waster. Someone planting? Chuck a canister to deny the plant. Monty pushing? Chuck a canister. Are you stuck in a bad spot? Chuck a canister and use it as a smoke grenade, not as effective but might just be enough for you to move positions.
---
But smoke was different back then

A huge chunk of the community wants R6 to be solely a twitch shooter where OP abilities or equipment have little to no impact on the game which is a shame since R6 is pretty unique in that regard. Shield ops in plat are usually not even that useful except for Monty
---
Wired flex but ok

i just got rainbow the other week so don‚Äôt make fun of me but how do you get black ice on a gun is it from getting kills with a gun or is it something you buy in the store or is it from an alpha pack
---
[removed]
---
Amen
---
If you did this to me, I wouldn't even be mad xD
---
THATS A THING?
---
(no flex intended)
---
*proceeds to mlg destroy the other team*
---
Are you in copper iv? What was the other team even doing smh
---
Their awareness tho, where are these players when I play
---
Block them on Steam, just find their username
---
You didn‚Äôt even use the damn gun
---
Trivago.
---
I meant statistics based.
---
Kapkan can work in 2 ways, 1) you place near obj, and if you stall long enough if the enemy team needs to push quickly they won‚Äôt have time to check for traps, But you need to have good defence and roamers that waste time.
---
2) put them in really common doorways a bit away from obj, attackers wont expect them, after getting hit with the first kapkan traps they will slow down their push to not hit another one.
---
You always get the garbage comments at the bottom.
---
I purge my comments. I don‚Äôt like having records stored online
---
Oh I dont know then
---
For smoke, run shotgun smg-11, also don‚Äôt use your smokes early on, save them for the last 45 seconds
---
PC plebs
---
I'm level 134 and I still haven't gotten a black ice yet.
---
It's kk dude don't worry, ubisoft got you, they always do, they are the big brother
---
Why? Just don‚Äôt say dumbshit or do say dumbshit, doubt the nsa will care.
---
That's exactly what he wants us to think. Dont fall for the trickery comrade.

If it's not there, then try verifying the games integrity. If that doesn't do it then I'd try creating a GameSettings.ini file and see if it is filled out after starting the game and changing settings. If that doesn't work, then I'd probably just uninstall, purge every related folder and redownload.

---
I‚Äôm not actually hacking btw this is Xbox 1
---
Simply amazing
---
I'd uninstall the game if I were put against that. :P but anyways. Awesome! You're so lucky for getting black ice for that gun. I've got it for 3 Guns i think. Or maybe 2, but the ones I can think of that I have are twitch's famas, and smokes fmg.
---
I've only started playing r6s recently, is the black ice thing lootbox related or is it an earned thing?
---
I‚Äôve been starting to use holo on a lot of acog ops since it breaks bad habits and makes you play smarter and not peek as often I find since I‚Äôm really trying to push to get better this season.
---
I‚Äôm plat 3-2 and looking for team right now but feel like holo makes me a better player I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but when I play acog I peek stupid shit

Hello x
---
Didn't even think of that, epic!
---
Thank you! I wish I got into this game sooner I‚Äôm so addicted!
---
I've seen it and I want it Soo badddx
---
King George is also way up there with the live viewer numbers. Honestly I have 10 R6 streamers followed on my Twitch, and get suggestions for others with sometimes &lt; 100  live viewers - I haven‚Äôt seen this guy pop up a single time.
---
I don‚Äôt see it
---
Twitch drone damage buff : 10 to 300
---
Sledge playstyle - Loud as fuck , doesnt give a shit , brash
---
Nokk playstyle - sneaky sneaky attack cav
---
I like these really old clips just to see how people played back then. (I didn‚Äôt start playing till White Noise)
---
The White Fangs... Errr I mean Black Tusk
---
lol every drone hole is a nade spot
---
Why is the audio is jacked up? Sounds like 7.1 surround sound on steroids, I wish I could hear sounds like this
---
Who‚Äôs ahead of MJ?
---
r/R6STeams can help you get a squad together. I can relate with you, this game is agonizing when you play by yourself, but thankfully I have friends I can play with every now and then. They make the whole experience 10 times better.
---
Agreed
---
So I‚Äôm also decently new to the game (I‚Äôm level 51 atm), so I guess take what I have to say with a grain of salt. 
---
I‚Äôve played both newcomer and casual with no mic, and have no real problems. However, I‚Äôm also a fast typer, so I‚Äôve been able to communicate relatively easily that way. I have not played ranked yet, but I would say (from experience playing ranked in other games) a mic would be almost necessary there. 
---
As for microtransactions (I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what you meant), I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge problem? I‚Äôve been able to grind out the renown to get most of the ops I‚Äôve wanted, just by playing the game normally. If you want certain ops faster you can buy them with money of course, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any exploitation. The alpha packs are another matter, but that‚Äôs all cosmetics so there‚Äôs no effect on gameplay. 
---
As for operators to use: for attack I personally like Hibana, Buck, and Fuze, whereas defense I mostly use Kapkan and if I feel like switching it up I‚Äôll go Frost, Mute, or J√§ger. I‚Äôm very much a ‚Äúwait for them to come to you/slow and steady‚Äù style of player though, so if that‚Äôs not your thing you might want a different set to try.
---
I‚Äôve seen him like 5 times in casual.
---
Got one kill on him, it was a rush

Hello Fake-Kixstar1903, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cl8898/i_found_this_on_my_phone_gallery_time_flews_fast/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
*gets black ice* *is too precious to use*
---
It is because of how popular the game is now. Especially if you are above average player. I typically deep roam or take my time when i have it and naturally my team is compromised of COD babies who rush and die instantly and instead of seeing what i do vote to kick because i did not rush like a headless chicken with them or they don't want to wait 2 minutes for me to make a move. Granted i have had the game for less than a year and am still kinda new but i have my moments. 
---
I also wouldn't say i help the problem at all cause if i do clutch i get to team chat and tell them i hope they lose or something like that then leave.

Its a force of habit, ive watched the killcams when i die and most of the time when i lean or crouch they miss. Mostly just a bad stick clicking habit tho

yea

Black ice for the knife unlocked

The should give him a Steyr TMP as a secondary, maybe buff the FBI shotguns destruction on walls. Then he could have a second play style similar but different to Smoke; as a area denial or choke point lurker.
---
I‚Äôve always thought the community was toxic. I didn‚Äôt actually play the game until this year but most of the gameplay was just retards pretending to be real special ops.

Thankyou!! Im currently working on a certain sneaky attacker üëÄ

I wanna bet he will get a rework next season, but maybe that‚Äôs my personal hope. As for his elite I‚Äôm not quite sure what to give him. Maybe it could follow the trend of the latest elites and follow the backstory of the character themself. Maybe give him the uniform he was in when he came up with the gadget design? Little hard to come up with one.

Can‚Äôt wait :)

Doesn‚Äôt use the gun at all.

Didn't even use the r4-c XD

As far as I know, on His Screen (The kill cam is not his screen), your head was clearly visible, or he DID hit a portion of your head. It's what comes with ping difference.

Again, that doesnt justify the shitty actions though. In real life if someone starts yelling obscenities, racial slurs and threats at you a potential solution is to ignore them, but that doesnt somehow make what theyre doing a socially acceptable thing.

I think the legion trap bounced off my shield. Don‚Äôt worry, they eventually got me. At least it took them a good minute to figure out how to kill me

Hahaha thank you

No offense, cause this is a great clip. I just think it‚Äôs funny that you got black ice then didn‚Äôt shoot a bullet in the entire round.üòÇüòÇ
---
I use reflex on most of my operators like Zofia, Twitch, Ash, and my main, Mute. It actually helps with recoil control in my opinion  because your zoomed in with an acog and is somewhat more accurate without all the mess in the acog sight itself
---
this new season could be an excuse to use the gun originally planned for nokk
---
Wow what an ace. Way to go brother
---
My run-ins with Maverick have been about the same. His torch is definitely more audible now, but that doesn't make him any less of a threat.
---
That is hilarious and also complete bullshit.
---
Blitz has a pretty low skill level imo. He‚Äôs super easy to counter if you know what you‚Äôre doing *plus* with the addition of Warden he‚Äôs basically useless. I know Warden gets played like once every a million ranked games or so but it really doesn‚Äôt take a genius to be able to beat a Blitz. Monty on the other hand, can be a nightmare in the right hands.

Translation:

OHK, or One Hit Kill is a move that a player can use to knock out a target(s) that will cause a instant kill to the target(s). This can be a damage value higher than the target‚Äôs HP, or Hit Points (a value that is given to all killable players, NPCs, or enemies that determines the quantal state of them either being alive or dead when the value is greater than zero or less than zero), like Diva‚Äôs Self-Destruct Ultimate in the video game, Overwatch, but this can lead to some counter plays to avoid. Similarly, another form of the OHK can be hard coded into the game, like the Knife in Counter-Strike Global Offensive where a backstab, when a player succeeds in his or her attempt to attack with their melee weapon, and the player receives an instant kill, or Pok√©mon moves like Guillotine or Fissure, where the move knocks out their target with a One Hit Knock Out move (OHKO), a synonym, or a related term to the OHK abbreviation but is just the same in that game.
---
A Knock Down, or in this comment thread, a Down But Not Out, is an attack where the mechanics of the game leads to the attack that would usually kill the opponent in other games, to knock down the player to temporarily give them a set time to recover from the blow instead. This usually leads to the mechanic where a teammate has to come rescue the downed person in order to able to play again normally. In some games, some give you the option to defend yourself like in the first Call of Duty: Black Ops game where after the player has taken enough damage, the player can use a pistol to defend themselves. If they have the the highest perk rank for second chance, a teammate can revive him or her when he or she is downed so they can resume the game normally. This gives the player a defensive option so they aren‚Äôt strictly pulled out of the game. Another form of this is the immobilized down, where after receiving damage to knock down the player, he or she cannot attack back. Some games allow for movement in the cost of the time alive when you‚Äôre downed, like in the game, The Last Of Us multiplayer. It can also make the player stationary and have the player wait for a teammate to revive them, like in Naughty Dog‚Äôs previous console game, Uncharted 3‚Äôs Co-op mode. These forms of Knock Downs require a teammate cooperation in order to win but can usually be countered by repeat damage to the player or the opponent to get the kill.

Me :)

Really? I thought it was epicüòÇüòÇ

Its a new addition.

I'm assuming everyone at the grocery store clapped shortly afterward

I think you meant I got one kill, woo.

I have a friend who plays on a stretched resolution because he has a smaller monitor, it does help him see better.

Hello,
---
Firstly, I wouldn't touch Ranked without a Microphone. It is just an etiquette thing at the least and mostly required in general. In casual, do whatever you want though. Doesn't matter :). I personally don't mind if people use Mics or not even at Platinum 1 rank. But that's just me. People will get angry if you don't use a mic in the ranked mode.
---
But you most certaintly can get away with playing Solo, I would recommend adding people that are nice or that you get along with in the games you play as well. But keep your mouse or ... analog stick (?) hovered over that mute button for people, you will likely use it a lot.
---
A very good and easy way to fast track your learning in Siege would be to watch YouTube tip videos ! There is hundreds of them. When I first played Siege. I played rank once I reached about level 60 and was platinum 3 at level 67 solo queuing. Watching Tip videos definitely helped, and lots of FPS experience!
---
Not entirely sure what MTX is, Microtransactions perhaps ? If thats the case, only cosmetics. Though Operators do take time to unlock unless you buy the full game, the more basic versions of Siege might net you a couple of the Operators but not all of them. Look into it, you'll see. 
---
TL;DR
---
* Buy a Mic ASAP
---
* Find friends to play with ASAP as well
---
* Watch YouTube Tip Videos to fast track learning. 
---
Happy gaming!
---
That doesn‚Äôt count you didn‚Äôt shoot a singe one. Now if you got the black ice for the knife (make is happen ubi)
---
I encountered him last season alongside Dom in casual (enemy team)
---
Meaty ended up clutching the game and one-tapping with the last bullet my friend hahaha
---
I used to be an operator like you until I took a knife to knee
---
that is such a good play
---
Sledge had to have been scoped in and focused on the doorway......right?
---
If you can't find it anywhere then it hasn't been officially announced.
---
Simple stuff.
---
someone tried to do this to me. :(
---
Best skin don't @ me
---
Why did you upload such a fucking lock video?
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get into it. Didn‚Äôt really work out at first but I could go back to it. Thanks for the tip!
---
You're right. I actually meant clash. For some reason she has an m4 mag on her rig
---
Agreed lol. Idk what he was thinking
---
Well I got the recap email so I thought it was almost over no need to be a dick
---
What the [tactical word] was Kapkan looking at??
---
Not only is IQ extremely popular, this idea wouild be retardly fucking broken and make her the best operator in the game by an insane order of magnitude. 
---
She would completely replace thatcher since she can literally wallhack gadgets through walls with perfect intel, and still be a 3 speed hyper fragger.
---
But in terms of that operation (v shell) was horrible. For the first few weeks you could melee a mira open from the other side
---
The p9, chinese pistol, GSH and five-seven are all far better.
---
Yeah it's an audio bug
---
I have no idea what you mean but on ranked I never saw bronze and on casuals I don‚Äôt care about ranks
---
Based on this dude's stats I wouldn't say he's a God either. PL players and macie are better
---
Put a silencer on the handle
---
Yea I stink it up last season , I‚Äôm hoping for gold but all my current matches have gone down to the wire- game is not easy
---
there's a picture idk why it not show

I main Ela, and I'll tell you this. Even on consoles Ela's shotgun is not op in any way shape or form. But everything else I do agree with you.
---
and a boombox
---
I'd like to request for an elaboration on how a simple answer such as that feels "dick-ish" to you.
---
I made no insults, no sarcastic remarks, just stated the obvious.
---
Dude, its Black Ice
---
Same here : I say 3-4 matches went into overtime . Stiff competition
---
Depends on which one is more comfortable for you
---
So cool you got black ice just to not use the gun at all
---
press f for house in ranked
---
Buy us dinner first.
---
I know it looks like youre shooting his head but i think the bullet got a friend with the stairwell... Happend alot to me
---
Kills don't matter.
---
But yeah, if you were fragging out that hard your team should have been focusing on planting and nothing else.
---
Im proid my child
---
She got too many gifts from Ubisoft club challenges
---
This....is true. I remember that (now). But nothing compared to ela op, clash broken shield, or hibanas non registering charges.
---
Cool.
---
Thanks to you all!
---
Thing is I was playing support and anchoring too. Solo queuing is like handing out free ELO.

Right? Am I just fucking deaf or is this shit almost supernatural?

Thanks! :)

Pretty great
---
She can be annoying, players may feel cheated if they die to someone duoing with clash, where they may feel they could‚Äôve won the gunfight if clash wasn‚Äôt there
---
Because she has a sheild and she slows u down? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just seemed hostile with your ‚Äúsimple stuff‚Äù comment. Just cause I couldn‚Äôt find it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm stupid lol
---
If you are playing solo prepare to be teamkilled and kicked a lot.
---
It is kinda rare that you verse a good Clash, or verse a team that knows how to play around Clash. Even at higher ranks, you are correct. She generally isn't too much of a hassle to deal with..
---
But when you verse someone who is good on clash or a team who uses her well... you start to see why. She can be extremely difficult. Especially if people aren't in a 5 stack.
---
That wasn‚Äôt even broken or glitched, that‚Äôs how blitz works
---
I mean, clearly you did something wrong if I can see him
---
You're missing a lot of these shots, you could probably save a few seconds off if you praticed your aim.
---
1.2KD, must be a god poggers
---
No such intentions, mate. Like I said, I only stated the easiest piece of information that is known, that is, no information.
---
You didn‚Äôt even use the gun huh
---
Lucky as usual
---
im joking man chill out.
---
Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt have to affect you? Nobody is saying it‚Äôs acceptable, and that‚Äôs where choices can be made to deal with said unacceptable behavior. If mostly everyone is in agreement that said person is being offensive, then steps should be taken to remove them from the game or the premise, but we can‚Äôt control or police peoples actions, especially in such an unregulated environment. Nobody is trying to justify their toxicity, and the only thing that drives these people more is a reaction. It just goes back to the age old adage: ‚Äústicks and Stones May break my bones but words will never hurt me‚Äù
---
Are you going to pass then?
---
that was extra lmao
---
What you're asking or ranting is nigh impossible to fix in the game's life cycle. I recommend playing with a group, the wins or losses will feel rewarding when you play with a group.
---
 Gets black ice for rc 
---
Doesn‚Äôt even use the rc
---
Better yet, be more willing to ban people for tking.
---
But the game supposed to be tactical so why not?
---
ik lmao i felt like having a bit of fun for the last kill
---
Nope, it‚Äôs my B I G work on this cosplay üåù
---
And after that I can safely say - I hate cosplay üåö
---
U can't do this in future patch. They addressed this. In upcoming patches, a copper can't queue with a diamond, to avoid team boosting. They are locking on the ranks they can queue with.
---
No flex, just holographic
---
Red dot, long barrel, not leaning,... Yes
---
Hmm, you seem to be bitter about something, I wonder what it is? Being wrong? Siege is founded on the fact that it‚Äôs as realistic as the programmers can manage, and that realistic ness is the main reason why people play the game. if they add realistic reloading then the game would be amaaaazing.
---
Yeah my friend was screaming  **"WAS THAT AN ACE?!"**   then me depressingly say "No... one was team killed"
---
My friend: ##"MAN IT REALLY BE LIKE THAT"##
---
Pretty much. This was quite frustrating, as you can imagine

U just run in there and there like oh theres an enemy lol gg

That was his pro league skin. They are only available for 1 season then leave the store
---
It‚Äôs his pro league set. Not available anymore
---
Got the R4-C black ice
---
*Gets a knife ace*
---
It‚Äôs a pro league set, they‚Äôre one time only purchases for a limited time.
---
I bought Nomad‚Äôs before it went away.
---
Let me guess . You saw someone with a Proleague skin for Vigil ?
---
Didnt even use the fucking gun
---
Her ability is practically useless
---
She has to show herself to shoot an electronic, and that often gets her killed. Thatcher just has to throw an EMP and potentially reveal himself, but he's able to affect electronics through walls. Twitch could be on the other side of the map and still disable things
---
U are human garbage lmao
---
He‚Äôs so creative, too. That‚Äôs the best part. Not *meme* creative, but tactically creative. He‚Äôs a great shot, but it‚Äôs his game sense that makes him fun to watch. The way he predicts how people will play, the angles he finds, the way he pre-places C4‚Äôs... It‚Äôs all so interesting to watch. I don‚Äôt think his commentary is all that interesting, but it‚Äôs useful in understanding his thought process. The gameplay really speaks for itself.
---
Man just made evil genises look like bitches
---
I'mma call you our right now and say this - turn ur haxs off plz. ur better than me and my ego can't stand it
---
Shields injure people now
---
I guess that‚Äôs what it was!! I don‚Äôt know?? I didn‚Äôt have my phone to grab a screen shot or his GT!! Are there pictures released of this anywhere?
---
She detects 20+ defender gadgets, enough Intel to inform the team of what's where. And she is the only reliable hard counter to valk and echo regardless of range.
---
If she really was useless, plat and diamond pick rates wouldn't be above normal and win Deltas wouldn't be balanced.
---
Me too. It's pretty good for body shots, but getting people when behind cover and moving sucks so bad
---
Then use it and stop knifing Kappa
---
I'm talking about eliminating any kind of reward for partying up with people with higher or lower ranks.
---
It should be a significant downside if you lose too the copper and the Diamonds should worry about losing more elo since they are partied together
---
Next blackice for knife
---
Thank Tachanka. What update changed it? I don‚Äôt remember hearing about it
---
She already is a counter to literally every operator, so adding something that antiquates thatcher sorta ruins the point of him. I admit this would be cool, but it would change the game way too much. Also i used to be an IQ main so I can say that her gadget isn‚Äôt weak at all, you see everyone on cams, pulse, vigil, every electronic gadget imaginable, etc. she‚Äôs fine in my opinion.
---
That's not at all why people play the game lmao. Yes. Holograms of people that mark people that mess with it, realistic. Defenders carry 200 pound reinforcements in their pockets, realistic. A car battery, places a foot away from metal electrocutes it? Realistic. See the pattern?
---
I got a kill on Macie Jay in a casual match when the Moroccan season started, haven't been lucky enough to see any other big players since though.
---
yeah see they are always hitting u with every shot they must be good !
---
It was the recent one on Tuesday I think
---
His proleague skin isn't available anymore . Read the other comments below my post
---
Won't they get addressed automatically if they can't party with a copper  or vice versa ?
---
For there to be an ever-growing list of operators, some need to be role players.
---
I'd like to see Glaz lean hard into the sniper role only, and have that role better supported by new maps and map reworks.
---
I like the sniper scope only + better pistol idea, that's how a sniper character ought to operate.
---
Elite skins usually change more than just a recolour to the original skin
---
Laughs in solo q to plat
---
She's able to see, but not destroy.
---
Only in Casual? I'm pretty sure I saw that in ranked too
---
I have never tried to knife a frost trap 
---
Now I know not to thank you
---
Wh OMEGALUL ?
---
Or you could switch to the PC master race and never worry about bad internet or low frame rate
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs so cool! I was so curious why it‚Äôs not anywhere or that I‚Äôve never seen them
---
before. Do ALL Ops have a Pro League set?
---
But a Thatcher can just throw an EMP and disable them without even knowing where they could be at
---
Cries in perpetual gold 1 solo queuer who can't get into plat
---
monkaS does twitch have a shotgun drone now
---
Some kind of weird obscure playstyle that other unplayed games like to use. Kinda like what siege has except people respawn when they die. Isnt that crazy?
---
I‚Äôll give you props for sticking it out until success or failure.
---
I'm not talking about what they are doing I'm talking about what they could do
---
Gets black ice. Doesnt use gun
---
So you don‚Äôt know where they are so you can easily miss. Especially echo drones and valk cams
---
Yes . All of them but some of them doesn't have full set . Like Thatcher for example
---
Sick dude looks like a mute logo
---
FeelsBadMan
---
They banned multiple uniforms a while back because they blended into the background so well
---
Nomad, smoke, twitch, and doc
---
Please it‚Äôs not even that bad
---
It would be cool but you cant ask for more if you dont want 30 minute queues
---
#A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A CUT A TAD BIT TOO SHORT
---
 I'm like a bronze 2
---
Wow
---
Also I only wrote this post because I got black ice for it and I have to make it work
---
Who plays warden tho
---
Damn dude don‚Äôt be a bitch
---
Yeah definitely an AR.
---
This works on pc as well. If people aren't expecting it or aren't set up you absolutely can catch them off guard and take site.
---
I would offer to help but I'm at Plat 2 rn 1 game from Plat 1 and I wouldnt see it as fair. Being in Silver sucks from what I have heard either you have bad teammates or people just trolling the whole game. Best of luck man!
---
You need to learn how to aim my god
---
Playing with friends helps the experience, and a good youtuber to watch would be TheRussianBadger
---
I like the 3 armor defenders and for some reason the mpx is pretty good
---
Aww so cute
---
Even if it is your friend
---
Tht is level 263
---
If you can‚Äôt afford #### cool whatever I‚Äôll give your best starter mains which is :
---
Defense operators
---
Smoke, he throws yellow colored ‚Äúmeth‚Äù gas
---
Mute, jams drones and plus breach charges and any operator that involves electronic stuff not rocket launchers or physical tho
---
Pulse, wall hacks achieved jk he senses enemy through their heartbeat
---
Doc, good medic
---
Rook, passing them plates(armor) to your team
---
Kapkan, door traps
---
And finally in defense yo lord tachunka who has an lmg
---
Woukd be cool and i would get elite ash on pc
---
Understandable.
---
Temptation Sensation by Heinz Kiessling. It's from a stock music library. I was just looking up the music of IASIP today, weird that I see it mentioned again
---
Preference honestly lol I play my J√§ger with a holo and my buddy plays with a reflex. Which sight works best for you.
---
You had us in the first half I‚Äôm not gonna lie
---
I dont know how i got it on ps4 in first place but indid
---
F2 is the Chad rifle instead of the virgin dmr
---
Now that's a lot of damage
---
I also aced my first round after getting black ice for the r4c. I guess it‚Äôs a common thing.
---
I took my own username because I forgot my old accounts login info hahaha
---
It‚Äôs not that bad, there‚Äôs just a better weapon in her kit
---
Ik the f2 and the shotgun are better
---
Absolutely love hunting down and knifing the last operator
---
But how come nobody is shitting on bucks dmr
---
It's not *bad* but automatic weapons are better.
---
Omg I remember the God of Light in R6 this clip is ancient where did u manage to dig it up from!?!?!?
---
I don‚Äôt fucking understand this shit how the fuck are you guys so fucking good dude i‚Äôve been playing since BEFORE HEALTH AND IM STILL ASS AT THIS FUCKING GAME
---
F2 is the best gun in the entire game, no reason to ever use the DMR
---
Btw I have black ice for the DMR as well, I know it's tough
---
No, then you'll just have two diamonds shitting on the coppers and battling each other.
---
Is this a normal thing fellow Zofia mains notice? or do i just get unlucky
---
The rifle looks like the Spcae Trooper M4 from Escape From Tarkov but with the UH-1 holo sight
---
And their voices sound like helium.
---
I never knew of whom he reminded me but FINALLY I HAVE FOUND IT
---
I don't think he's meant to be the same person but they look so much alike
---
Literally no idea who that guy is. If it was the ninja of r6 I would've heard about him.
---
Make sure youre actually using the 1050, siege sometimes will use the motherboard built in graphics
---
How did he not headshot you? Only your head was poking out.
---
I had that with a constant 2v5 with my single premate just the other day
---
YAS
---
*First round with R4-C black ice*
---
*Proceeds to get 5 knife kills*
---
Who‚Äôs gonna cheat in copper/bronze? How about a Copper/Bronze player who doesn‚Äôt want to be a copper/bronze player? lol
---
&gt; Am I the only one who thinks warden is a weak op? 
---
Literally the entire community thinks he's weak.
---
Attacker operators
---
Ash, RoCkEt LaUnChEr
---
Sledge, the hammer bro
---
Thermite, breach charge that destroys reinforced wall and says ‚Äú a really big ####ing hole coming right up
---
Fuze, hostig killer with cluster charges that gifts the enemy a couple of drags in a room( good for everything but don‚Äôt use on hostage mode or you‚Äôll have a happy little accident)
---
Blitz, Thomas the tank engine
---
Montagne, a wall just a wall
---
And finally recruit which is best on attacker just equip a shotgun a Gernade and breach charges and rush
---
That's about when I log off for the day.
---
I dont believe the title but damn the casual players in this one lol lookin at u doc
---
put everything on low except for shadow
---
make sure your nvidia thing is set to performance over quality, and maybe mess with more settings in "program settings" within "manage 3d settings" in the nvidia control panel
---
Probably because he wasn‚Äôt expecting me to be there but to be fair my flick to the right might have saved my ass
---
