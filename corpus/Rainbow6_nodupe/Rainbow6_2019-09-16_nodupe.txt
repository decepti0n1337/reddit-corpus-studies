Do you have to verify who you are if you want to play Real Sports yes or no
---
I mean it said you would kill em
---
Edit nvm I just watched it like 10 times and I noticed it didn‚Äôt even say it til after
---
***KOREGA REQUIEM DA***
---
Wow you are officially a moron. Please go back to school. Or an insane asylum haha.
---
This isnt a fucking real sport now is it
---
i was fucking around with the enemy team once on fortress. accidentally knocked myself and one other off the satellite tower, but one of them hit the corner post and didn't fly off.
---
Yeah but they just took away a bunch of impacts and then shields would be god tier and close range
---
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The red and black uniform with the tan Stetson hat and he rides in on a damn black horse looking all majestic af.

Do NOT disrespect my religion.

Wasn‚Äôt there a post recently that had an excerpt about how Ying once got pretty violent with Fuze because she believed his methods were too haphazard, and that Ash had to step in to calm her down?
---
My man, do you need help? Someone who is rude to others with literally no reason at all does not have everything together somewhere dude
---
Well aren‚Äôt we both disrespecting it by using technology and electricity??
---
Still waiting
---
I was speaking the truth. Maybe you need a nice 500 milligram dose of the back of my hand to your cheek.
---
Sounds bent.

He will he available next week for non season pass holders

THERE HE GOES AGAIN.....GODDAMN MAE....I SALUTE YOU

That's not his point, and furthermore that's not true at all.
---
Plenty of ppl use controller in plats. My whole team uses controller in plat. Scums use mnk
---
cmon now, did the guy mean harm to you? he was just making a fucking joke bro chill out
---
Yeah no problem dude, you can watch mine to compare, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hFqUHsHgXcY. Yours is just much more aligned and well made. Don‚Äôt stop creating these man
---
Enjoy your common duplicate!
---
You know what you‚Äôre right I feel stupid
---
Euh no.
---
I assume by this wednesday, is his gadget useful? What I noticed was that he had a Vector with 2 speed, sounds insane if there wasn't a nerf to that gun yet.
---
You don‚Äôt
---
You either don‚Äôt know much about the white masks or you have no imagination
---
a week after they are released, so this wednesday
---
Okay address the other points then
---
They won't bring back last years halloween packs.
---
Do you know how many packs last event had? 22. This years halloween event will also have up to 30 packs as up to 30 halloween cosmetics have been leaked. We would be at the same amount of packs like Operation Chimera had,even slightly more. Which means also slightly more expensive. No one would want this and Ubi already had a lot of hate with the outbreak/chimera packs being so many and so expensive.
---
Most players will also hate it as they want the newer,better looking skins but will have a high chance of getting the old pack skins and ending up disappointed.
---
Plus,they said they want the packs to be limited time only cosmetics. Meaning if you didn't get the Ash Black Viper elite in Chimera or during Year 3(Digital downloads gave you 10 free packs),then you never had the chance to get Black Viper Elite. 
---
It's the same with SunSplash and last years Crimsonveil Packs. Rainbow is Magic,Showdown. Limited time only cosmetics,if you didn't get the stuff back then,then you wouldn't get them ever again.
---

---
The leaked halloween cosmetics for this year are already up to 50-60 bucks of Rainbow6 credits. Up to 60 bucks to get all ~30 items.
---
Add the old packs and players who want to get the stuff they want have to gamble up to ~100 bucks.
---
Nah man 100% straight
---
I know. But you make it sound like everyone has that or a similar opinion.
---
i mean it‚Äôs your first post so i‚Äôll ignore the flaws, have an upvote, also how did you post this since you play xbox. i‚Äôm curious because i want to start posting things in decent quality
---
sounds like that's your problem 100%
---
she likes it, and jackal can probably smell it
---
[removed]
---
Yeah of course
---
Ohhhh that explains a lot, yeah I don‚Äôt play a lot of t hunt. I only play it before ranked to adjust my sensivity
---
i nutted
---
What?
---
I mean yeah but I wouldn't purposefully leave my team
---
lol
---
Do I really have to write out that it‚Äôs implied in a figurative way.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not the good but last night the game was running smoothly for me and my friends then like the third match my whole team started lagging but the other team wasn‚Äôt. We definitely got lag spiked. We still won though bc they thought they had a chance and stopped it
---
This was posted a few weeks ago. At least credit the artist, ya dingus.
---
How did none of you notice that? It's so blatant. Maybe I just got a bunch of them and couldn't unsee it.
---
watch youtube videos honestly
---
On what specifically?
---
I feel that. I‚Äôm a Gold 2 but it‚Äôs been like 24 weeks since I last played a casual match where I wasn‚Äôt facing at least 2 or more Plats or Diamonds who just *really* don‚Äôt wanna lose
---
Buck off
---
Step 1 pick blitz 
---
Step 2 rush into sight 
---
Step 3 middle mouse than v
---
Step 4 profit
---
Step 5 buy elite for extra skill
---
Watch coconut brah he has some great tips and tricks
---
Thicklock was without a doubt my best op last  season and the main reason i hit plat. She helps cut off rotations and can be useful covering the bomb.
---
Amaru is fun in any game mode if you know how to use her O_o
---
I like blitz but damn the face you see in the art looks nothing like the character model.
---
So cute! And looks way better than the chibi from Ubisoft
---
Blitz = best op
---
unique as in most games dont have that feature. i knew some games out there like cod had it but in general i dont see it very often in most fps games
---
i myself really dislike castle and would advise you to not pick him. a shiload of operator outright ignore you like if you did pick recruit. even after the tty much ruin the ennemy vision instead of greeding and sacrifing your drone for a gu. if you still feel unsafe  to do that because of the roamer, take you drone to your spawn point to take it back and throw him again later in game. but anyway, fuck you, the m2 is op, go delete twitch.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
for buck i would say 2 thing. *destroy, the, fucking ceiling!!!!!!!*  otherwise don't forget that, even if his shotgun have the bigest spray in game, it's still a shotgun, so don't feel asham to inspect small room with it instead of your dmr/ar
---
not much to say with iq,  don't forget that you can play with verticality to destroy gadget safely. also, 3 speed is op, so again, go delete iq.
---
on smoke, im trying to bring myself into more playing him. you should alway go for the shotgun+smg set up. it give you a great deal of utility and fighting capacity. your canister isn't loud like a c4, so you can throw it above a door in prevision and when you see/hear ennemy going in, you pop it.
---
i myself really dislike castle and would advise you to not pick him. a shiload of operator outright ignore you like if you did pick recruit. even after the glaz nerf, you can still end up helping the ennemy team. i only saw people puting decent castle in proleague/high plat or diams.  the problem with this character is that even if you know how to kinda work with him, you often end up upseting your teamat. with a 5 stack, with who you already repeated the strat maybe. but in solo don't pick him.
---
vigil is a pretty standard roamer, even so i would advice picking jaeger who give to your team much more utility and being 3 speed. people often overlook how insanly op 3 speed are, that's why i would often recommend them and their superior stealth/mobility above a bit more health (that doesn't mean jackshit against a headshot anyway.)
---
pulse if fun, don't forget to play  with verticality, you are made for it. also do some rush out that you prepare by punching 2 a windown from th part that is not visible. like that you can directly jump out without having that long animation to oppen it
---
This is requiem
---
Very. Sad people need an advantage to move ranks.
---
Agreed some of my friends uninstalled the game already, I'm still playing it but not with the same amount of enthusiasm as before.
---
womens
---
am i weird that i like it when you can read small in game textures
---
It's been used against me, and it's disgusting.
---
As the water mark states it‚Äôs made by lux their quite nice just to expensive for my taste
---
If it's a situation like this (1v5 aggressive), I always say to my friends "clutch and I'll get you a elite" then this happens.
---
Oh I know, I do my best at it. I'm just trying to have fun and escape the world man, I wish more would do the same
---
Or at least lore based situations. All we know about the white masks is that they're evil vegans with murder boner. The ops hardly have personalitys. A campaign that explored these aspects whould be awesome.
---
One of my friends kept making the thIQ joke so my friend group got one of these for him for his birthday.
---
100%. Most of the new characters are edge lords
---
It‚Äôs funny, I recently started on Xbox after playing on PS4 for a long time and so I just had the basic edition. I never played Buck at all on my first account but had no choice when I only had 8 ops. I was like ‚Äúfine I guess I‚Äôll play Buck until I can invest in some *good* ops.‚Äù 
---
Like 2 rounds in I was like ‚Äúhol up... I think Buck might actually kinda smack.‚Äù 
---
And he definitely does. But his recoil makes me sad
---
I appreciate you üôè
---
I‚Äôm normally in neu but mine somehow when‚Äôs to sbr  ( south Brazil )

I know just the jitteriness of it is sus

Why are there two Blackbeards?

Are you Beaulo?

Your kd, score or anything you do in game doesn't matter. It's only the win loss thst matters
---
What's was your last seasons ending rank mmr?
---
Images you can hear

Why is maverick even there in the first place?
---
They didn‚Äôt expect this game to do good so they built it shittily
---
Right next to recruit‚Äôs elite
---
\&gt;French
---
\&gt;weeb
---
Math checks out.
---
Yeah it looked pretty damn good from what I recall
---
That is factual
---
You know I'm really getting tired of posts like these putting bomb on a pedestal.
---
1. The game was shipped with three game modes. All three are the "true" rainbow experience.
---
2. The game was balanced around all modes. Thermite and Hibana are most useful in secure area. Frost, Bandit, and razor wires were all most useful in hostage.
---
3. How does bomb have greater depth and flexibility of tactics? That's such a subjective statement. The other two modes are very competitive. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean there aren't experienced players that use their own metas, skills, and insight in order to win at them.
---
I'm beginning to think Ubi has all of you stockholm'd with the "bOmB iS MoRe CoMpEtItIvE" garbage. They clearly only want the game to revolve around pro league and the only way to disguise removing content and modifying content that doesn't need fixing as a good thing is to get the reddit shills to repeat the "COMPETITIVE BOMB" garbage over and over again to gaslight other players into believing past Ubi's obvious agenda.
---
Every time. Every legitimate complaint on this sub is deflected to "BOMB COMPETITIVE". If I didn't know any better I'd think all of you were paid shills.
---
Hoes mad.
---
Jk man that sucks hope they patch this.
---
If you don‚Äôt want serious, why do you care? Casual is for screwing around, unranked is for serious but doesn‚Äôt count, ranked is for serious matches that do count.
---
Yall are down voting when you know it‚Äôs true. Acting as if Ubisoft is 100% at their job
---
Exactly
---
So basically "every game needs one except for games that don't need one". What are you even trying to say here
---
Nice
---
How so? I want proper citations, 12 Times New Roman font, double spaced, 4 pages NOT including title page or bibliography
---
Either they fucked over Tasmania or that's New Zealand right there
---
Not much, but those two fuckers have proven to be very good at cherrypicking in the past, so they will find a way.
---
The very first match i played i got ddosed. But they stressed too hard and made everyone disconnect.
---
Are you using that rapid fire mod or I don't know what ???
---
House got removed but will be rotated in with other maps, plane has also been removed. RIP
---
Brain hurty tiem
---
I never payed much attention to it tbh, always think it was a leaves pattern
---
I thought that was a CQC training accident? Are they not buddy buddy? I know Finka and Tachanka are drinking buddies tho

Pretty sure NZ is supposed to be the one SE of Aus.

Well then support keyboard use on consoles and instead of matching based on console you get matched based on input device.
---
Tap on your name and choose "add flair"
---
Situations and events don't count as a fucking campaign, actually fry's my head to the bone when people say that garbage. A campaign that would make this game worthwhile would be something on par with literally any previous Rainbow Six title and Ubi are quite clearly more than capable of doing that, but they're more interested in money

‚ÄúI am in Rainbow 6. One of the deadliest counter terrorism units ever to exist.

Seriously though, why the fuck is the bolt charging animation soooo slow

Nice. I wish I was actually artistic and talented lmao, I‚Äôd love to make or buy(if cheap) some cool little things of my favorite operators and put on my desk but I can‚Äôt really find much of the ones I‚Äôd want besides enamel pins.
---
Word of advice console players: DO NOT join a party from anybody on the enemy team. They are getting IPs once you join and knock you offline. Just happened to me on siege during my last placement. Woohoo, fun times. Going to enjoy the 30 minute ban
---
I had no clue a character could be thrown *through* a soft wall by one of those! Ive never seen that happen
---
Blackbeard and Frost.
---
Cav is clearly the hottest character
---
I was a blitz main before I knew it was cringy. 
---
This, while some of it is obvious, helped me.
---
Flash range is about 10ft. Don‚Äôt be trying to flash someone across the room.
---
Only ADS if they aren‚Äôt looking at you. 
---
If you have the option between shooting and shield bashing, go with the bash. 
---
Blitz is a high risk high reward player. On Bank 2nd floor I‚Äôve rushed from conference room to exc. lounge. Flashed and got three kills. If there was someone in the south west corner I would have been lucky to get one.
---
Your right shoulder is exposed, shield up or down.
---
Tachanka, oh wait
---
Mine is Mira when it comes out
---
Ty
---
Got bim... bambiz... *you got fooled!*
---
I mostly just ban what is super annoying to go against. Monty/Maverick, Echo/Maestro. Depending on the map I might opt to ban other operators like buck on chalet or kaid on clubhouse.
---
doc and jager
---
Thanks
---
That should a real cereal
---
Yo ass better have hot sauce

Lmao that'll be weird to see then if it ever happens

Twitch is ma favorite

Rook, he‚Äôs soooo hottt

THIS IS WHERE YOU STOP

This made me laugh harder than it should have
---
I love this game but that ddossing shit is gonna make me throw my PS4 outside.
---
People who say you‚Äôre camping are CoD/Battlefield players that are new to the game. You either roam, roam anchor, or anchor
---
They probably let it happen cuz it might cause a bug or just screw amaru over if she just drops to the ground
---
Frost‚Äôs is pretty cool
---
Yeah that's what I thought Warden would be op
---
It‚Äôs how you get punished for leaving early I think
---
Ooooof
---
On Xbox, there's a bunch of audio issues. For example, I can never hear Fuze deploying his gadget or detonating it until it's too late. It's like very faint.
---
The one that doesn't cost me almost as much as the game itself.... Oh wait.
---
Goyo more like boyo bouto dieo
---
So is a joke about smoking cannabis the exact thing this bot wants to try moderating out of all the things to moderate, not a Hibana Japanese school girl outfit pedophile joke?

what i do is download them through the xbox app it‚Äôs fairly simple just just go to captures hit share and hit download

and yet, cant take a punch without stumble like an idiot....

Mine locks up and goes to black screen that I can't get out of. Requires PC restart. &gt;:(

Completely agree. These past few seasons have been awful shades of green that honesty all look the same

Reaction time. He had already set the input to turn in his mind, but by the time his brain processed that someone came around the corner, his brain couldn't correct for the mistake quick enough
---
defuser\*
---
Wait. I feel like you're talking to OP so never mind lol
---
I normally ban jackal and mira depending on the map
---
Yes i hate new kanal
---
Have a ranked match just a few minute ago, last round match point, 2 of our teammates got booted from the game at the same time and they got the penalty
---
DDOSing is a federal offense so let‚Äôs just start arresting these assholes and the little kids who are doing it will get scared and stop
---
Okay but what about when two or more leave and it is a 3 v 5? Should the three lose rank because of two very inconsiderate people?
---
I have the same loadout and black ice but i dont use suppressor
---
I'm pretty sure I've caught my phone like that a couple times after dropping it
---
I like it
---
Gonna ask you because I feel like you might know, if I want multiple ops in my flair, do all of their codenames need to be inside of one set of colons or how do you format that
---
Yes reaction time. Pull the trigger.

I've never had case where the entire desk disappeared :\[

Time to retire

Bitch, here i cant get one at 54 percent
---
Nezuko + Tajion = ascending to the next realm
---
This wednesday? I think?
---
Obviously
---
Which is why people say it's a console hardware problem not a game problem. All the game gets is controller inout signals.
---
The only people that can permanently fix this is sony and Microsoft, but Sony already supports 3rd party k&amp;m that emulates controller signals.
---
He deserved it for being pulse
---
Oh ok
---
If you leave when getting interrogated by cav you are just being a good teammate and people that think its wrong are just being inconsiderate of their team

Nice ace

It‚Äôs gamebreaking when you get punished for getting out of those matches
---
Bro I love the tree house episode
---
Didn‚Äôt know this exsisted because I haven‚Äôt played in a while but sound like it needs to be addressed, good luck on getting this out there.

Probably bc he tk the vigil
---
What if someone who is let's say, heavier, like gridlock attempted this
---
If i dont have it, i wont let anyone else have it

*Pulse elite wants to know your location*

I haven't had much of a chance to play r6 recently, but from what I've seen, I think i like OG kanal better.

Guessing he's the one that tked Vigil. I do that if I'm in someone teams someone I'm stacked with.
---
I personally like Fuze the best mostly because the skin is definitely noticeable but not too flashy. The gun skins aren‚Äôt bad (the lmg reloading easter egg is always fun to see). and the shield skin is great. his elite animation is, in my opinion, the best. With the camera effect, the music, along with the fact that he fires and racks back his pistol, makes it great.
---
&gt;"just headshot him 4head lmao"
---
yeah shut up

I like this idea, good thinking.

Username has GTA. Makes sense.

&gt;.&lt;
---
Yeah we haven‚Äôt seen this, and you don‚Äôt sound like a very reasonable person so I‚Äôm not sure why we‚Äôd be obliged to believe you
---
I think they should have like a short 30 minute campaign about each operators back story, that‚Äôll add more character and plus something new
---
Im pretty sure bandit shoot it himself?
---
A question with a demand. Interesting.
---
Imagine if Amaru just blast Clash away similar to Nomad airjab.
---
Doc
---
I had to overcome this at one point. Whenever I felt the urge to look away the first time, maybe two, I just kept holding. Patience is a virtue in this game, and I'm not saying you don't have it but knowing when to apply it is hard too.
---
Completely dependent on your own personal play style...
---
Because everyone starts around the 2500mmr mark
---
Beaulo when he plays doc
---
it be ya own holes

I really hate casual and I hate unranked even more because it's casual but more tryhardy, but damn Ranked sucks right now.

‚ÄúI shot at his backpack when I did it, too. Weird.‚Äù

Doki üëåüèº She can call, hack, and now has nades which are basically homing missiles at this point. Her gun is pretty good too in my opinion.

doc
---
Tactical Shooter/Simulation, friendly fire exists in real life so it exists in the game. Sucks, I know.
---
Yes I am aware that like 50% of the game is fantasy and doesn't exist in real life, makes even less sense.
---
The more I play and the more toxic people are the more I realise the only way to guarantee good teammates is to find four friends to stack with. You'll still get the occasional hacker or text chat douche on the enemy team but woop.
---
Are there any more weird patterns?
---
I think teamkilling ( if determined purposefully ) should subtract renown or something in casuals.
---
Deadass debated drawing this meme, figured someone else would
---
I hate when people say obvious things and not actual callouts
---
You forgot the *-450 points friendly fire*
---
Actually I never do. I'm just trying to play the game and I get shot up by my teammate right when I spawn.
---
Have to try, can't do it without trying, right?
---
Some of those are just 100% your fault. Like the one in theme park, what kind of angle is that. You‚Äôre just asking to get peaked
---
If Warden had MP5 or P90, he could have filled Doc/Rook's position as a solid Anchor with focus on countering instead of providing defensive stats (armor &amp; healing). There would have been very little complaint other than adjusting his gadget to have less penalty for moving (which we got recently at least). 
---
3 Armor with ACOG along with being able to counter certain gadget would put him on the similar if not higher level than Doc especially if the enemy team is using lots of smoke and flashes. I think the best option really is giving him P90 or MP5 type of weapon. 
---
Even Nokk is in the similar position. A solo operator who feel like should be faster but she's 2 Speed. Once the cams are taken out, 3 Speed Attackers can all achieve as much quietness as Nokk while still having better guns, faster rotation, and their own utility. Nokk simply is not efficient enough to replace someone like IQ.
---
And then the last one should be ‚Äúpeople who ban the same 4 ops because they cant handle them.‚Äù
---
Get it on console it'll work every time
---
My kind of woman
---
Thats actually kinda cool how this scenario was accounted for
---
You would have to get the moderators behind this the youtubers and the majority of the player base the R6 sub doesn‚Äôt even have a million people last i checked and theres millions of people playing the game daily so you would need to advertise this over other social media so you would need to get a viral tweet or something but it‚Äôs definitely worth a try
---
As far as I have seen it being high Plat on Xbox, most MnK players (ones I played with and against) are good with a controller but couldn't compete vs MnK so they didn't die a hero, they became the villain.
---
Really good controller players can and will compete tho, as console MnK has the same limitations as a controller has, being mainly the hard coded controller turnspeed cap. You can't go around that.
---
I have seen so many MnK players being shat on by good controller players, there is a decent number of high Plat to diamond controller only teams in Xbox esl and other leagues.
---
I get your point, but when playing competetively there is a point where MnK and controller on console are the same. That point is just harder to reach with a controller.
---
Op what is your point? You‚Äôre getting mad over someone being better than you? First of all you didn‚Äôt provide any evidence that he has mnk, second of all you‚Äôre getting angry about losing to plays in unranked game modes?  How about you go play ranked and play people who are somewhat in your skill level?
---
He would have to stop turning, look back at his opponent, and pull the trigger. His reaction time obviously wasn‚Äôt fast enough, seeing as he wasn‚Äôt able to stop himself from turning.
---
AmarUuuuuuUUU
---
World of warships had a system where teamkillers would be marked pink and if your name was pink, it would activate reverse friendly fire. To get rid of the pink status, you had to play a couple games without doing any team damage.

So.. A less effective version of a claymore, that isn't quite as visible. Where as you can place a lethal claymore at an angle to the door and it be basically invisible if done right

If ubi adds a shooting range I think it would be cool if it were like a destiny hub and you can see other people and there skins and take part in a shooting contest or like a find player thing. I've been playing to much d2 lately

They have said themselves that it isn't up to them. They also have never said it isn't allowed, just that they don't support m&amp;kb (true) and they can't do anything about it (true). It isn't up to them.
---
True. But also soul for a soul. Maybe they could switch the company who is running their servers. I would take some adjustments but maybe for the betterment of the community.

You know what‚Äôs funny when we defended again I did the same thing but got a 3K instead

Thanks homie üòÇ

Better than Hibana (and to a degree Thermite)
---
Problem is that if Ubi switched companys for their servers, the game could be pay to win very quickly. The only reason why Ubisoft had trouble fixing siege, is that they have tons of other games that need fixing. And with their main company usually fixing bugs in other games. Best they could would be switching it over to a less experienced site 'B' like fallout 76

Lesion

lesion if u like being an aggresive defender

Is lesion a roamer?

I don't think its that hard to recognize which is which, and English isn't even my native language.

Wildlands actually has a campaign where you have to find Cav and you work with Twitch and Valkyrie. Voice acting and all.

If the enemy team bans one of the new ops but not the other, I'll make it my mission to see the other one banned. You don't get to play with your new favorite toy if you aren't gonna let other people do the same.

Most of these aren't holding angles at all my man, most of it is you peeking or pushing and getting shot. You gotta stop shoving your face in those tiny window breaks, everyone else can see you way better than you see them. The theme park scene you were in fact holding an angle, but from a tiny barricade break, looking straight at a vending machine in the middle of a hallway. 
---
But solid content, did enjoy, wish you the best.

Both very good, lesion is better if you tend to take it slow and survive the whole round, Hibana is good if you want to hard breach but move fast with a great gun.

Hey boss, I‚Äôm a plat 2 on PC :). No needy to be calling me a goldy :). I can even see from all these other comments how sensitive you were when someone gave you a low rating and you got so triggers lmfaooo. Just chill out.

Not want to be rude - but you are 999 999 person that asked the same question - what happen with the game, what is the actual state of the game and etc. And every of these posts have also your "i stopped to play the game *insert exact time*. So don't be surprised that they respond you with videos, because nobody wants to repeat themselves over and over. And if you don't want to watch a video - one simple search here in reddit about you exact same question will do the trick. Because like i said - you are 999 999 person that asked this question. Have a nice day.
---
Nice to see such low pings all round. No wonder you got so many kills.
---
Damn. I went 12 once and thought that was rough. Fuck man, unlucky
---
Yeah, im constantly recording everything when I play. I've used Xbox which I deemed to be too unreliable for capturing epic moments, and had better luck with Nvidias software. But ultimately I decided that it is still eating up a good chunk of processing power even keeping three minutes of footage accessible to save
---
so i figured id just record nonstop and started re-watching entire gaming sessions to see where I made  mistakes with my round which is an extra bonus lol
---
I‚Äôve been crashing a bit since ember rise came out so it might not be always intentional
---
Very well explained my friend, yeah what annoys me most is when people call you a 'tryhard' for droning. -_- Like Casual is more laid back than ranked I get that but it doesn't mean to not use the tools you have in your arsenal to get intel, plan a strategy and get better at the game. Might as well not even use operator abilities at this point, someone might go ahead and call you tryhard for that too. People are funny these days... But thanks for soending time on this reddit post, have a good one üòá

The French shotgun punishes you by being a pump action so it deserves to be slightly better but elas is semi auto with a high rof which makes it objectively better so it‚Äôs stats should be worse but they‚Äôre not. In my opinion it‚Äôs very powerful and borderline broken for a shotgun.
---
Try AA12 then.
---
You compared Controller with MnK...
---
Its like sayin ‚ÄûAh you don‚Äôt have arms and legs and you needed 10 sec for 50m that‚Äôs bad I got it in 7sec with arms and legs‚Äú
---
Its dumb to compare Mnk and Controller a Plat should know that even when he plays on PC

So true!

They kinda broke the game

I don't get tk'd alot but everyone here seems to really like the "Vote to kick" system lmao.

Well, then it should be problem of your internet.
---
The game isn‚Äôt meant to be played offline, only solo TH works offline.
---
Haha it was all lucky spraying to be honest, I usually am terrible at holding rooms like open area üôÉ
---
Alabis shotgun? That‚Äôs full auto and awful. It breaches well but it needs a buff. That‚Äôs under tuned whereas elas is over tuned.

there aren't any game breaking bugs currently.

&gt;If ubi did care as much as you say they did and weren‚Äôt in this for money, why are there so many bugs in this game?

uh.....have you ever played any game before ever? anything that is constantly adding new content is going to constantly add new bugs. that's just how coding works. if you can't understand that, you're probably a child.

TDM is meant to be nothing more then a first game of the day warm up. An alternative to t-hunt.

I hate how people missed the reference
---
Frost, Hibana and Glaz for me
---
unpopular opinion: anyone who wants to play like that in casual, thats completely fine! But since it doesnt get you anywhere in the game, nor does it improve skill or anything else i think its fair that you play casual and just play the game as intended. I'd rather play the game than waste my time like that imo. Don't hate, i'm just trying to get a different pov on this thing.

Its polish

I wish we could do regular 5v5 game modes against AI.

This is my last game until Platinum and this starts happening ;,((((
---
Bandit for me. Looks sufficiently different to make it ‚Äòelite‚Äô but isn‚Äôt just some nonsense completely unrelated to the character
---
so you only want them placed there after the discovery playlist not at the same time? you dont have to play ranked at zero hour take a few days and play the playlist
---
&gt; Your elo was reset, so your net is neither a gain nor loss. 
---
Incorrect. Because those two matches that were refunded are matches that counted towards my counter, which means I can never earn that MMR back. Every match you play reduces the total amount of MMR you CAN earn in a single match. So people who have their MMR revoked are inversely impacted compared to those who regained their MMR. It isn't balanced. Simple math will tell you that. It is weighted in favor of those who were refunded.
---
If I earned 80 MMR in a 5 stack beating cheaters. Then two weeks later it is taken away because the cheaters were banned. My next match is only going to earn me 50 MMR if I win.
---
The only possible way it could be balanced is if those who had their MMR taken from the cheat match had all subsequent matches played after the cheat event MMR adjusted based on having played 1 less match.
---
I dont think thats how you should hold an agle but its a feelsfuckingbadman
---
Lesion for sure
---
Good job  brew!
---
You'll get an MMR adjustment, but you won't be banned.
---
FYI it's peek not peak, that's what you do during sex or on drugs
---
Thank
---
Until 5 guys c4 and t-bag you
---
honestly looked and didnt see it my bad
---
The only way it would be balanced and fair currently is if my next match after getting my MMR removed I was granted the MMR earn potential of the match that was revoked. Otherwise the system results in an imbalance as it is currently implemented. So currently there is an MMR imbalance on the opposite direction that you are worried about.
---
I'd say they're no exploits in the game currently, but the amount of crashes I'm seeing from people daily is at pre-operation health levels right now and it's pretty much a coin toss whether or not we'll be playing a 4v5 or playing a 5v4.

---
I was never intentionally teamkilled and I remember being kicked from a server like maybe four times in CoD in siege you can get teamkilled kicked on the reg
---
I used to play with a bunch of plats a few seasons ago and we wouldnt drop peaks unless one of us dies or couldnt hold our shit.
---
And if you're going to drop a peaked move the hell into cover and away from a death funnel like a door or hallway.
---
I don‚Äôt see what the problem with it is, you don‚Äôt have to buy and if you don‚Äôt you still get free shit for just playing the game
---
Dont let them back in.
---
My friend, I think the rest of the community and I can pretty much all agree, "It be like that sometimes."
---
You have wayyy to much of a high ego for yourself, you need to calm down. I hit plat 2 at level 50 for my first time playing on Pc, I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs bad at all. You say I don‚Äôt even know how to peek, wtf did you see my peek on Mira? hahahah. I also did a fast peek around the kitchen door to fake the rook, i‚Äôm pretty sure that was a good play because it fuckin worked bud lmao. You‚Äôre literally a console player trying to chat up a Pc plat. Stop trying to think you‚Äôre the man, like fuck. As I‚Äôve said before, I saw how triggered you got to everyone who gave you a bad rating. You‚Äôre so butthurt that you have to try and give a reason for why you think you are not bad. Chill the fuck out, seriously. I also haven‚Äôt hinted to you that I used to play console. So if you think I have a bad playstyle, you are dead set wrong. I‚Äôve played on Ps4 at the start of operation Chimera and that season I hit plat, first season ever playing. From there on Is worked myself up to plat 2 and stopped playing in Burnt Horizon, which is when I moved to Pc. If you think you should seriously consider your own game sense if you think my peaks are bad. I was well known in the Ps community for how smart I played my peaks, which is made me a dependent too fragger on console, as well as on PC now. I know how to play the game. You want that 1v1? Let‚Äôs do it then. I‚Äôm in OCE, and if you are somewhere different i‚Äôll happily let you host to gain the best advantage over me. The moment you get your PC, hmu and we will play. If you think you‚Äôre that much top shit then I want to see for myself and your respect will be given if you show me you are as cocky as you say you are.
---
What's the problem with it exactly? It's something you CAN buy if you want to, but don't have to, you also get free content too in the default battle pass. And it doesn't give you new weapons or anything that would affect gameplay. I won't buy it but I don't feel like having it is a problem.
---
 I don't think I made it clear enough. If an operator is down via frost trap, you get the adrenaline boost and you can return fire whilst being immobilised for the duration of her ability.
---
Recruit compromises operator bans. If you're banning J√§ger because you don't want any 3 speed running around with an AR on defense smacking everyones butt but then the enemies all pick recruit with 416C, that ban was useless.
---
yeah my exact thought when saw this happen
---
Ubisoft don't like fun.
---
&gt;See their unwillingness to ask sony/binyotsoft to stop Ddossing
---
true, I know it just the start of the new season but boi is it so frustrating to get placed with people who just autolock ash and rush every round
---
after the acog moves, he‚Äôs not there
---
Damn atleast use an ash tray
---
Gets me every time
---
echo is still invisible after acog moves
---
Nah I just asked I wanna put a team together with people who has good aim
---
What makes you so certain they didn't ask?
---
Thanks for posting this, I'll have a look through those subreddits to see what I can find. Thanks for helping
---
That's why smoke has canisters, to cOnTaIn
---
I love how people get blown through walls. Might be my favo thing to do in this game.
---
But you cannot shoot while in a trap nor while just dbno. Finka's ability should just revive from Frost trap as well :D ...
---
Omg I could smell the room...
---
Can't wait for the cluster fuck to bounce back through the hole
---
Im glad im not the only one who has that fricking time luck
---
Yeah I thought that Finka should just revive them, but it be nice to be not completely useless whilst in a frost trap.
---
Nomad is good, but I wouldn't recommend her over say Maestro, Mira, Echo, Maverick, Hibana, and a few others. You have to know the common flanking spots well to properly utilise her, and because she's quite unique she's not as easy to learn. If you think she'd suit you playstyle, go for her, but I personally think ops like Hibana and Zofia are better overall investments.
---
I'm sure there is negative feedback there will always be negative feedback to everything but your making it out to be like no one wants a battle pass im pretty hyped for it as it gives players something more to do and yea it may cost money but that will let them continue to develop the tame more and more
---
&gt; Maverick 
---
Completely forgot his name, that is how rarely i see anyone playing him...
---
This happened to me recently. Around 3-4 hour loading marathon until we won.
---
I'd feel bad for you but you're so obviously using m&amp;k on console so you can get fucked.
---
Just reload the damn F2, that pissed me lol
---
Wanna talk about it chief
---
Ye I am, my friends are too
---
They'd've told us by now, after the community repeatedly told them to fix the issue
---
Yes
---
Is it just me or do you get negative points when reinforcing here?
---
why did that mute try to defuse in the gas?
---
I‚Äôm so confused as to why neither of yous rotates round but just constantly shot at the shield which was not going to let yous in
---
&gt;there aren't any game breaking bugs currently.
---
There is currently a bug, where 2 speed characters don't make any sound while moving.
---
This is completely out of context but i also like buck. Just thought i should mention it.
---
 I am a pretty new player and not good at all.
---
If you correct someone, at least write your own stuff correct. It's "too often", and not "to often".
---
Overtime is randomized tho
---
Being patient since over one year of ddosing now... How long are we supposed to be patient? I literally can't play my favorite game because they are not able to find any solution.
---
And yes if one is diamond after 2 days wothout one bullet shot at all, and has a w/l of 35.0 only a retarded idiot thinks this is legit.
---
So let's say ubi cant defend ddos. But they fucking can start banning people!!
---
Bow chicka wow wow
---
Shouldn't this be reported or something like that?
---
a series of unfortunate events
---
boooo spawnpeeking on outback
---
What the fuck Travis never ddosed and he only plays for honor now
---
yes pls i am glad there is someone else who agrees
---
I got a spy and had to go the process to get them removed &gt;:(
---
No its not
---
Dontbuse tgat method
---
Yes.
---
Multiple friends on a discord I was in were complaining that it happened, when in doubt take the loss and keep account is my opinion but am ‚Äúa console tard and don‚Äôt know shit‚Äù so you do you
---
Nope, the devs just don't know how to handle toggle aiming.
---
Before it used to allow you to sprint from ADS then it would make you ADS again when you stopped like when reloading but now they won't let you sprint while ADS using toggle, so they can't seem to make up their mind about what it should be.
---
They really need to fix that in the next patch lol
---
I think he meant a Rainbow Six campaign, not a generic zombie shooter with Siege's operators.
---
How many do you got?
---
this guy gets it
---
The game was released in 2015...
---
How about they'd just die?
---
How do you know it's just a generic shooter isn't not even out yet.
---
How can you judge if it has a lack of story or boring gameplay mechanics if no one has seen footage of it.
---
The teeth... The eyes... Oh GOD
---
fuze can't use his gadget unless the stick thing is planted in a wall lmao
---
I use her with holo angled muzzle and lazer for max rush with a dmr and am torn betweeen secondaries
---
Not just you. I having the same problem too. Just pissed me the fuck off.
---
I meant that when you get frost trapped, you can return fire whilst being immobile, possibly hip fire? maybe its because i keep getting frost trapped with the new attack operator though, frost traps have been the bane of my existence recently.
---
Huh?
---
Slightly disappointed, there wes no hysterical laughter as the poor bastard burned =D

Would have loved to hear what went through that players head when he realized that he's done...

Whats happening more recently is people targeting the server IP, which is much easier to get. There are a lot of different ways they do this. Some stress the server so everybody's ping goes to 3000 ish, meaning attackers can't move but won't get kicked. They freeze you for 3 attacking rounds, when they attack they try to plant and then turn on the lag. 
---
Other times they just stress the servers so everbody's ping goes beyond that, everybody gets kicked and usually the match doesn't count, so they don't lose any point. 
---
ps. not saying people werent server stressing already for a while, it's just insanely more common now
---
To be fair I don't think cheaters care about having fun, they care about winning. If anything you are just letting them cheat in another match even quicker.
---
Happens to me all the time. Hold an angle for a minute, as soon as i check another angle someone peeks. Amazing.
---
He wouldn‚Äôt have had enough time to get on the other side.
---
Ik she is good. But for most players she isn't a good fit. I like running around and fragging out so she isn't a good fit for me. She has a very passive aggressive play style that doesn't fit most players. I'm not saying that she isn't good cause clash mains are the scariest thing ever.
---
Thats just wrong.
---
The datacenter should provide a DDoS protection because the servers are on their network, shouldn't it.
---
I like fragging to. I dont like just canping in the corner like the other clash mains and the clash still wins
---
Ah, the elusive double claymore. Previous recorded sightings of this fenomenon suggest a connection to even less common quad-mat. However, there is still too little data to confirm that.

I want to vomit looking at all these comments praising outback

Buddy, you‚Äôve got a long way ahead, dm for doubts

Honestly the only reason is all my friends play siege on PS4. I wouldn't play nearly as much without them, I hate solo queue
---
But what is it? The thing is, everything looks normal(eg the drone cam, selection menu, etc) except when I'm playing
---
maverick counters: clash can stand infront of the hole, anyone can shoot through the hole, and any type of aoe can kill him
---
You act like attackers having ARs and nades gives them some sort of substantial advantage. In a game of one shot headshots majority close quarters engagements, defender SMGs and more than sufficient. 
---
Maps like bank, club house, chalet, border. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the defenders have the advantage of the environment, it feels balanced, and can go any way. Having the map favor the defense side doesn‚Äôt balance things, it just makes it defense sided
---
I mean, a lot of players of the community (including pro players/ youtubers/ streamers) liked the map. Attackers have a lot of routes to attack different sites. The map is big but balanced and it has a nice aesthetic. 
---
Maybe you should get better at attacking instead of insulting people because of their ranks.
---
*Many of us* would love to
---
Not accusing its a statement and I just think ur a dickhead. Imagine being so desperate for validation that you post other people‚Äôs content and hard work for internet points. Your lack of admitting to wrongdoing shows how desperate you are.

Couldn't a roamer just shut down Jackal by baiting him into a frost trap or literally any trap ops ability?? I feel like he could get countered pretty easily in some cases but idk
---
this shit is rat barbushka im getting dogged on by the ddosers.
---
Just from personal experience all my games we 3-0 when we defend first and when attacking go 1-2 or 0-3 than push OT on defense. Maybe the META on that map changes on PC, but on console diamond it‚Äôs defender sided as hell.
---
They all died like idiots and now it will be Fuze's fault if they don't win!

uwu

I like outback :(

Start the game in offline, try the guns in custom match and then decide. All operators are unlocked in offline mode
---
I got ying from mine

i would full extend more often
---
Ok Thank You

Yeah... but house and oregon
---

We only want long face cav let‚Äôs be honest

Start the game in offline mode to try out all op's in custom match. Roamer=vigil. No questions asked
---
Alibi or mira
---
Well [they share the same MMR](https://mobile.twitter.com/rainbow6game/status/1169965985090199552).
---
Not 100% sure if playing unranked affects your casual/unranked MMR, or if just casual, as have heard conflicting statements.
---
If you're matching with plats/dias in casual it doesn't necessarily mean you have high MMR, they might just have low MMR or have not played any that season.
---
Oregon isn‚Äôt gone tho I played it yesterday on casual
---
Thanks for the advice. After some self evaluation I‚Äôve realized you‚Äôre right, I have been doing my own separate thing instead of utilizing my team mates
---
Lol yeah, I‚Äôm in low gold high silver so that‚Äôs probably why I don‚Äôt experience it because people don‚Äôt take it that seriously in silver 1
---
I'll answer questions too, wait till he finds out about Echos LITERALLY unlisted ability of never being played in comped due to being lynched for being a weeb at the ban phase.

Just give me the space and money

Oregon is on map rotation too, bit its in for a couple more weeks or so.

Have a Zofia or Ash (or any one with grenades) pop that shield open.
---
You can only slow down competent teams.
---
*Zofia pops out* "HELLO THERE"
---
every elite op has a different name for their gadgets. like ashs is slither
---
Vigil
---
Nope. MMR adjustments need to balance out. Either ban the guy and take MMR from everyone involved, as if the match never happened, or ban him and leave everyone's MMR alone, allowing people who gained from having a cheater in their team to essentially have their rank boosted for free. I know which I would prefer. Sure, a match can take a good 30-50 minutes to play and it sucks to have MMR taken from you, but it's a game and I'd rather it was fair.
---
Fair enough. How old are you guys? If you're old enough you guys could get part time jobs and all buy PCs. Or ask for one for christmas lol

Agreed on all except Hereford. Its a great map if you remove the garbage cluster fuck that is tractor storage. Fortress is a flanking nightmare, theme park is unbalanced and heavily favoured for defenders, and outback is just a piece of shit in every way.

Blitz is understandable but Echo instead of Ela?

How do you know you would have won the last game?

I would stop making posts and start playing more ranked

5-3 wouldn‚Äôt have been a great rank to start anyway

If you want high gold/plat you got to go basically 10/0

My team went 9/1 and got gold 1

Some got gold 2

I haven‚Äôt gotten ddosed on pc and I have a couple hundred hours

Yes. Legendary duplicates should absolutely not be a thing.
---
Although this is good if someone hasn't paid attention or played the game for a while but the more important thing we needed to hear was DDoSing problem on console.              
---
The game is literally unplayable at higher ranks and it keeps forcing people to either quit playing or start DDoSing because currently there is no other option on ranked mode.

Unpopular opinion: i like these maps way more than Border and Bank.

Except for Skyscraper. Skyscraper it's pretty bad.

Inspired by battle field?

I will ban the shit out of the plane map anyday
---
Although this is good if someone hasn't paid attention or played the game lately but the more important thing we needed to hear was addressing DDoSing problem on console with a solution.              
---
Outback is a great map.
---
Looks like the server is being ddos
---
inb4 someone with 420
---
Is this still a thing? I‚Äôve heard about it but thought it was patched. Now I‚Äôm gonna have to try it
---
Unfortunately if you want an elite skin you gotta open that wallet up.
---
I'm not 100% but I'm certain that there would have to be so diamonds aren't stomping coppers. It's probably like ranked where it starts you off in gold 4 or whatever so there is a base MMR and depending on how you play it will raise/lower. It just won't have any impact on rank or it might even place you with people in your actual rank in ranked.
---
What is the criteria for the difficulty rating? And can you please tell us, what even is gun mobility?
---
Yeah, kinda fell off Siege as of last season. Got hit 5 times by DDOS, 1 resulting in abandon penalties which I lost that secured MMR (we were up 3-0 and up 5v2 in the round) and had a ban for 30 mins.
---
My teammate told me they won.
---
Nah outback is fine. Fuck seaside tho
---
Does it also connect you to chat with your last teammates but doesn't load anything else?
---
 So you can chat with people in the main menu
---
You can get the skins from alpha packs (very low chance though) but I don‚Äôt think you can get the entire set.
---
Lol as if anyone on console cares about their rank anymore. Lost 6/8 of my placements so far due to ddos. Time to try hard in gold.
---
Ngl outback goes kinda hard I don't even know why all my friends hate it
---
It takes time to learn the game, it did for me as a matter of fact I‚Äôm still learning. It‚Äôs all worth it in the end
---
Okay first WHAT

second THE FUCK

Doesn't seem like they thought about placements of equipment.
---
Can someone enlighten me as to why everyone hates skyscraper
---
A.

---
Wow really? I've never seen that happen on youtube. Shouldn't you be rewarded with credits at the end of a season according to your rank?
---
Ive had that trouble for a long time now. One week ill get an average of 6 kills per game...the next....only two.
---
Someone plz make shooting stars with this cav
---
Been having the same problem .
---
I got Capitao :(
---
No map it's actually favoured for defenders, it's just that you don't know the map well enough. Except for House, but House it's just a bad map.
---
I go through periods like this where I'm just getting slapped.  I'd suggest take a break from the game for a few days or a week.  Generally, the start of the season is the most populated/sweaty so while ranks and such are being balanced during placements, you may be facing some better players.  
---
But if you play this game a lot, especially every day, try taking a break.  That's what I do when I start getting frustrated, and I usually do much better after a few days off.
---
Most of the people that I play with have used him to block choke points and almost everytime it has ended up blocking a defender out of the room because no one could set it off at the right time. I have yet to see him used successfully for the defense. I know it happens, just not im my games

Except the vast majority of this sub has opinions on defender-friendly maps so it‚Äôs obviously nothing to do with map knowledge, but nice try
---
Give that boi the good ol sledge slap
---
Border, Favela, Outback
---
Border--Only PL map I actively dislike playing.  A bit played out and just not fun (imo).
---
Favela--complete garbage.  Don't understand why this map was brought back (and better maps weren't).
---
Outback--decent enough ranked map, but not close to PL quality.
---
Its best to understand that this is completely human, you don't play the same  people every week so the same things won't  work against them.
---
Shotguns dont work like that. I really dont think shotguns are bad in siege.
---
I'm out here gettin 0 kills till round 3, and then getting a triple with bandit
---
I like the sledge one, but I also like the Fuze elite skin.
---
Yeah just take a few days off and play some other games, or just take a break from gaming.  Its football season, lots of new games are coming out..you have options!!!
---
Nope. Read below. I only play ranked in 5 stacks specifically to avoid playing with a cheater. And all 5 of us were able to play after all 5 of us got this same message.
---
cameras
---
As much as I appreciate these insights, can you give us some statement(s) about DDOS on console and the increased amount of game instability overall?
---
r6fix is flooded with reports of the game crashing with seemingly random causes, and it's very annoying.
---
I'd ban Border and Bank, and probably Skyscraper. Clubhouse it's pretty nice provided that your teammates are cooperative.

one of the pellets already lands on the crosshair.

His operator card looks strange now because the faces aren't similar at all.
---
I understand there are closet cheaters. And yeah I guess there are more cheaters than I thought. I still don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ton and I still agree with how ubi is handling it right now, which is what this post is about. If they were to make it so that match‚Äôs points weren‚Äôt null, it would very much so make the whole ranking system imbalanced.
---
People run out and pre-shoot all the time and it sucks
---
it's console, relax
---
I feel like that would make them less skill based.  Especially if one pellet can be a enough to kill.  Then you just have to be in the general area of their head.
---
outback is infinitely better than skyscraper and chalet
---
this is cool in all, but please do ***ANYTHING*** about the DDoS problem
---
It's amazing how this community can even think of Ubisoft "ignoring" the DDoS problem.
---
What do you want guys? Uh?
---
"We are aware of the issues but no et√† on the solution" ?
---
So you can start the circlejerking again?
---
I guess neither they did
---
Regardless we got super lucky with that guy's dc.
---
You can set up replay buffer with OBS. Does the same thing as Shadowplay except you can better finetune and control the quality you want it at. OBS does buffer it on RAM though so you will need available RAM to do it - especially if you're planning on randomly clipping entire matches.
---
Ech....oh
---
My friend and I just kept giving each other high fives after each small accomplishment. Salem was awesome.
---
Just put down a jammer
---
Just give us a fucking map pool option like in CS for fucks sake. It will probably take a day or two to code and now no one has to play shitty maps ever again and we can bring back maps like House and Plane back to cas or even comp if you want. OPs post is a retarded fix to an issue that should have been fixed years ago.
---
First i think about glasses in window, but then i realize this window don't have.
---
Outback is a different map yes but with many strategical similarities to skyscraper.
---
*tie stabs intensifie*
---
hamistasty must be a real asshole to purposefully get you banned
---
DDoS'ing has been happening for over a year now on console and they haven't done a thing. When you report it, they say send us all the players in the game and what not (as if they care). But there hasn't been a single ban yet.
---
Map banning should be mixed in with op banning, like there's 5 maps and each team picks a map and an op to ban. Time would have to be added or have it as a seperate screen right after op banning
---
Are you still a glaz main ???
---
He looks just like bbno$
---
I can't even find players like this on newcomer. What is your secret???
---
Very cool. Love the background! Cool location
---
The game should end in a draw when pings sit higher than 500 for example.  There needs to be a threshold that identifies when a game is being dossed and just automatically end it with no elo given or taken.
---
Completely neutralize these kid‚Äôs cheating.
---
Did we all somehow forget Favella?

How do you get screenshots like this?

Never hipfired in my life with anything but shotguns.

All filler, no update on the progress into the "High Priority" (your own words form the previous Dev blog) DDOS problem. Also no acknowledgement of either the rampant cheating on PC (once you hit Plat or above), or the full system crashes on PC that require full restarts to fix.

I haven‚Äôt liked any of the new maps. Honestly, I‚Äôve started to dislike this game. God dammit. One of the few things I love.

you're a silver aren't you?

I would rather play tower than skyscraper

Dang unlucky

I wish. It‚Äôd probably be too goofy for ubi to put in the game though.

Check your transaction history on PayPal and Steam/Uplay. If you're 100% sure no money was taken out I'd advise you to contact Ubisoft Support. You can have a live chat with one of the Support Members. You can also open a support case (but that could take up to 12-24 hours).
---
It is a war crime it violates annex six of the Geneva convention.
---
It doesnt always works thou, for some reason attackers sometimes without the difuser planted.
---
Unless you know how to fix it dont complain. I'm sure they are trying
---
Skyscraper, The New kanal
---
Maybe less of a trooper (lose the massive armor that he has) and some sort of officer outfit instead? I think that would be cool.

What sub is this again?

Not if you shoot next to it.

I mean you could, what platform you on? I‚Äôm always down to play

I‚Äôm crying because I‚Äôm either valk or I did a derp runout in casual but the other team went dok...

i like outback and theme park but other than that yeah

When I first started playing games on pc I had to use a controller. I would only play BF3 with a ps3 controller and thought I was doing good. One day I got comfy with the m&amp;k and it's been such a huge difference. Every time I pick up a controller now i feel like a drunk retard when trying to aim at anything
---
Yes, unless you shoot it on the floor in front of the shield
---
just a bug, restart and it should be fixed
---
skyscraper ? chalet ?
---
Are you willing to wait 30+ minutes?
---
Ah yes a flash hider, a man of culture I see.
---
I would swap outback and memepark with skyscraper and chalet.
---
You went afk during a ranked match, for one you shouldn‚Äôt join a ranked game and fuck your team over by being afk making them have to 4/5 an entire game, secondly being afk got you kicked for not playing, and there‚Äôs no way to end the ban, next time if you think your going afk, play a causal
---
Yea I agree that it‚Äôs not really timing, however, I sympathize with using a controller for siege. Sometimes pressing certain actions feels clunky and I know on pc I miss click a lot of things so I can‚Äôt imagine how bad it must be on console lol.
---
Seems legit
---
I tried but it says i cant open a support case yet i really dont want to be banned for this as i heard them say they will ban people before and this would probably be a permanent ban
---
Fortress is horrible, I like every other map though
---
Solid play. Lets see if it pays off.
---
:)
---
Ubisoft did take measures to extend their reporting system (from what I can see) this season. Prior to Ember Rise, their reporting system was seemingly pointless, but it seems they‚Äôre taking it a bit more seriously and they extended their options for when it comes to stuff like hacking/griefing.
---
I understand your frustration on the entire matter, but look at it from the dev perspective;
---
They‚Äôve got work to do on the game that ranges from balancing changes, concepts for the *next* season, and yes‚Äîmaking aesthetic options for players. Overall I‚Äôd say their efforts in taking care of their player base and attracting new players has been pretty good.
---
Besides, I know you‚Äôre pissed about the DDos attacks‚Äîmost of us have been there‚Äî but you can always get back diamond.

I would LOVE a yellow uniform for doc
---
it's their top priority stop crying lil fackers
---
When you press ctrl + w to close a window instead of clicking the [X]
---
I love theme park and Hereford
---
Wait til people really learn the map again. A lot has changed besides just a new hallway. New maps tend to be defender sided until they are learned.
---
She‚Äôs so ridiculously situational I feel it‚Äôs not worth playing her when there‚Äôs other ops whose gadgets are more useful more often. The only reason I play her is because I like her guns and it‚Äôs fun I rush with
---
where the fuck is tower
---
Oh thx, sorry about that. It was different for me
---
that's some r/hitboxporn content we have here
---
No but how do you get it, I need a good body skin for her
---
Good thing i don t usually put cams on site i just put them in the entrances bc that s where i roam only in secure area i put one on site so it will be easier to gain site back fast
---
Are you on pc or console?
---
So many Ela cosplays recently, whats going on?
---
To the back, very right corner, that‚Äôs IQ

I very much hate Outback

Or tower
---
I like Outback.

Ok boomer
---
it was reported in-game and through live shat just thought people may want to see the skin
---
That's fair! Just personal preference. What do you hate about Skyscraper?
---
That's exactly what I expected, too! Kinda disappointed that isn't what happened, tbh.
---
Guys I have a new wallpaper!
---
I think you don't know how to play, if you think that this is not the problem. I think you rang is from bronze to silver
---
he was bad if monty wasn't banned he would have definitely been killable.

Do you play on pc or console?

&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, we also wanted to focus more on creating a better Ranked experience for our highly dedicated competitive players. We wanted to provide an experience that more closely mirrored Pro League, improve Ranked competitive balance in all aspects, and develop long-term engagement with players and Ranked. It was time the Beta tag came off ranked.
---
&gt; Further changes coming to Ranked in Y4S3 bring the focus on improving competitive health, balance, and integrity. The Rank restriction will prevent players with greater than a 1000+ MMR gap from playing with each other as a means to prevent boosting, and the new Ranked map pool will be reduced from 14 to 12. We will be looking at feedback on these changes with the new season to see what tweaks and further improvements can be made.
---
I don't know man, how about you look harder into fixing these problems called DDOS-ing on console, and M&amp;K if you can do something.
---
And how about some communication on how that is going, eh? 
---
Probably a lot to ask for, I don't know.
---
Why not report and then surrender? You wouldn't waste 50 minutes and would be able to immediately play another match.
---
Having few good attacker entry points is the same as being extremely defense heavy...
---
It's actually 3 cause tower is always first
---
I'm glad you love it!
---
sorry wanted to clip the whole thing for a report should have made a shortened version.
---
When is it coming out
---
That part of the map is useless
---
you right
---
Why do people not like theme park it is my second favorite map
---
See I always punch the bottom window 2 in armory, and the one in garage, I place lesions in there and up stairs with me, then I blow out the floor above door way to garage (on the garage side) and I blow out the floor in bedroom above hatch to laundry.  This allows me to watch upstairs/ row Tate to counter any pushes the attackers try
---
Also it‚Äôs a lot of fun to hop out of armory into garage and shoot people in the back
---
Ela is one of the worst and weakest ops in game currently
---
Honestly this is better than the black ice wallpaper I had been using
---
Yeah but why would Ash do that? Unless she's new.
---
Ddos is getting more and more rampant with every operation!
---
I know it‚Äôs not the same as ranked but there‚Äôs unranked now, same rules and everything
---
I mean it's not even out yet so I assume it isn't finished but it's already pretty nice looking.
---
Marley is that you?
---
Wow that's funny since I use black ice too
---
The way you memed it made a sad thing actually funny.
---
An actual quality Ela cosplay,great job on it
---
As a kapkan main who knows how kapkan mains work, that‚Äôd result in a shot frost trap 9/10 times
---
It‚Äôs terrible, you get stuck playing only two maps cause every other map has a long queue.
---
Thank you c:
---
The lord wills it.
---
Thank you :))
---
it‚Äôs just siege bro, it really sucks but it‚Äôs one of the reasons i will only play with a 4 or 5 stack
---
Theme park is decent. Tower is the damn worst and skyscraper second worst tied with Hereford and fortress then outback
---
You forgot the gu mines and frost mat
---
A man of culture I see.
---
It requires like 5 seconds of thinking to figure out that even ubisoft isnt that fucking stupid to put an op in the game that can go completely invisible.
---
Funny how CoreRoss showed this like 2 weeks ago and people are finding this extremely interesting, _now_
---
Zofia has finally found a purpose.
---
I used to have wallpaper that moved like that as a phone wallpaper. 
---
Also, Jesus Christ ?
---
Its plexiglass
---
Nah, only r6
---
I noticed this too when I was playing last season, my friend was even a higher rank than me I was gold 1 he was plat 3. Maybe it just looked like they were better when i was solo.
---
Recently? You‚Äôve been blessed. This has been going on for years
---
So? Rainbow six the way it is already has longer queues than csgo anyways lol
---
And rainbow players has more acceptance towards newer maps than csgos
---
The newcomer playlist is totally useless when you not getting told constantly what to do and you just 10 new accounts against each other.
---
Its not like the thought didn't count but the execution is done purely its wasted time. I just watched a decent streamer just mindlessly running arround with his other 4 teammates vs 4 other chickens and 1 smurf for 20 mins. If you have one or two jokesters in on the other team that like to smurf with their new accounts they are ruining the experience for the rest of 8 players while these 8 players don't gain anything valueable other then using wasd and M1.  
---
So if you like to get new ppl to understand your game better do it like the Bartley scenario. Shuffle 5 players into a game and give them audio and visual guidence system with extended buildup time and basic explanation as to why razor wire and other utility might be helpful spending before the round starts.
---
It's like personal training. Do this drill like 3 times with different levels of introductions to defender utility, defender vs attack utility and monitoring and drone disposal. Every round you making the setup time closer to the unranked prep phase. 
---
Switching sides.
---
Introducing the spawn votes and deploying system. Propper droning by pointing out vents and providing a minigame as if the drone was to collect some VR coins by going to higher up or hidden places. Elaborate on ping vs a callout.
---
**He He Ye boi**
---
Did this the other day, I‚Äôm a bad person
---
Outback is a good map. I've never had overwhelming defence/offense success on Outback, and it flows well.
---
I think it is..
---
I mean a person being thrown through the air would probably break it or at least break every bone in there legs cause she kinda fades through the shield
---
oh wow thats nicer that i thought.

In the heat of the moment, I didn't give it thought, which is why it's funny that they let me literally walk into the objective and plant. Laugh or don't, but grow up, kid. Being a dick won't get you far in life.

---
You are probably a low rank aren‚Äôt you?

Cuz it bad

I hate that they reworked Herford... Ffs that was so dumb

Yes, but you can stop worrying about grenades now.

You probably get 1 tapped withing the first minute if not spawn killed on skyscraper dont you bot?

You are about to destroy ASH. Proceed? Y/N

Outback is good

No, they shouldn't. Whatever they say, some smartass with zero knowledge on the topic Will cherry pick informations to craft some bogus claim that the rest of the user will believe without even think about It

It's mindboggling how the community is so entitled they think they can decide if someone is competent.
---
Seems to me like they were on your team
---
Yikes
---
Siege definitely does not have longer queues.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a long time but if you didn‚Äôt want to play dust 2 or mirage, you‚Äôd have to wait over 5 mins to find a match.
---
Or maybe because when you que with a friend you play a little more aggressive/sloppy cuz you have someone to communicate with where as in solo, you play more conservative and slow... at least that‚Äôs my case lol

---
The biggest problem right now is not mentioned. Ranked abandon timer is way too severe for the amount of things out of our control. While I agree the timer should progressively increase every time. Until you fix your glaring server problems, the issue where you cannot reconnect to the same match, as well as the ddos issue, revert the abandon timer back to the way it was. u/ubinoty u/lordkeren
---
IKR my luck is as shit as yours
---
That's why it has to be behavioral.  Find patterns that MnK users have that controller players don't (instantaneous change of direction, always follow the same rotation curve--stuff like that getting more complex each iteration).  Machine learning and/or pattern recognition has become very good at solving problems like this.  It's expensive, but my guess is that you don't need top of the line to deal with this problem.
---
But nobody is even trying.  The one attempt (by Fortnite) was shockingly basic, quite effective until patched, and quickly patched.
---
for real. communicate in text or voice chat instead of destroying a gadget. forsts mat is more easily spotted than kaps trap so his trap is better at doorways and hers are better at windows.

It‚Äôs only op if u wanna hug the person holding the shotgun, otherwise it takes 3+ shots at medium range, and that‚Äôs just for pump action ones, stay far away, flash em, use a grenade, flank them
---
Not cool to kill traps, but they honestly shpuldnt even be near each other. Frosts teaps work best in high traffic areas, tight corridors amd especially exterior windows. Kapkan traps should never be on exterior openings, on doors with boards, or on Windows in generally. They also needto be on rooms adjacent to the objective, not on he objective, whereas Frost has some flexibility there.
---
Bruh I tried to comment but it wouldn‚Äôt send so I kept trying. Fuck that
---
One word...thatcher 
---
Or twitch but the drone has to find another way in first
---
If you're stupid enough to directly activate a Goyo trap around the hostage though, you kinda deserve the kick. Kapkan traps and other indirect sources of death should count as Goyo for the hostage.
---
Yes we are.

I'm on console and it doesn't always work lol

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been spotted‚Äù
---
Like how on Villa everyone runs the same two sites, but the others are also pretty viable (we've found a lot of success in kitchen for our group)
---
Yeah they give you away too badly.  It would be nice if you could switch them off and on like in BF3 and 4.  I'd also like to see take downs like that game had as well.  This you died immediately because someone sliced you across your Kevlar vest nonsense is some ridiculous late 90's era fps garbage.
---
In case of casual i have to agree, toxicity is a problem.

Ranked though? Havent had a single major incident.(im mostly duo queuing)

What's the point of having the EDD and the battery there?

J√§ger would complete this

Agreed, the amount of times this has been posted is concerning

Lesion trap and smoke trap fuck it even befriend a nomad and have her set a jab near it
---
Also it spot on their leg
---
You can't spend money on an alpha pack, and the ones where you have to don't have duplicates.
---
I‚Äôm running 40 vertical 80 horizontal and 40ads i believe
---
I‚Äôm kind of a noob but what is the point of the jager shock wire here?
---
Yeah but they wanted him to have more of a anchor role I'm pretty sure. But Barb did make sense but maybe the balance team thought it was "over powered"
---
I don't think that's an option when your game is on their console platform and online service.
---
Gotta put an ADS by it so they can‚Äôt set it off with a grenade

In another match, this happened. [https://i.imgur.com/BZ5I4OA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BZ5I4OA.jpg) Placed a mira and the wall just stayed there.

You should just by season pass for the operators at this point and you'll get a slight Renown boost for the year you have SP and a .30% increase in alpha pack rolls
---
True. But with no continuing game lobby the game can‚Äôt distinguish which maps players just played in the previous game so it could lead to players still playing the same map over again. Where as games like CoD, everyone is in the same lobby for next game, so it‚Äôs easier to choose a different map. But in Siege everyone gets booted out after the match
---
So should this potato quality
---
lesion elite on the shotgun
---
The girl makes enchiladas for everyone one time and suddenly she expected to be mom. SMH
---
I‚Äôve got to agree that console isn‚Äôt very good
---
Twitch doc and rook don‚Äôt play a big role eh? Tell that to the win delta where games with rook won quite often, twitch taking out bandit charges or Mira windows, kapkan traps. Only real run and gun character is ash, every other character plays a pretty important roles. Fragging ops are the only ones that don‚Äôt offer anything to the team, at least ash‚Äôs charge blows open a permanent hole, vigil, warden, glaz, and possibly a few more only help themselves get kills, nothing more
---
Now this is an avengers level threat

Its also on ps4 but im pretty sure they dont use sony servers so I dont get what you mean?

Clash is able to stop people from rappelling, so if anything, Amaru should probably just fall to her death
---
Do you know what causes it?

---
Big lack of Ela booty :(
---
She also makes the operator gadgets
---
Looks pretty good. Is the material nice? Could be nicer if you maybe had every operator icon printed on the shirt. Just a thought , but otherwise it looks great.
---
Ik it probably reminds most of Villa, but this pic reminds me more of Inferno in csgo with the right alleyways.
---
Hit the X refresh button on the top while it reloads. It fixed the problem for me
---
Twice for effect
---
I didn‚Äôt look. I don‚Äôt get on too much
---
Reddit's opinions on siege are something else, man.
---
The point is that there are an upside and a downside I think it's good how it is because if it was what you propose than there would be no point not running red dot. Also takedowns wouldn't work because that would basically be a nerf to knife, which in my opinion is not needed and would only pull this game further from what I think the majority of the player base likes about it which is the tactical/deeper gameplay. This addition even if realistic would take that away and introduce even more bm which frankly I've had enough of.
---
Yeah in a another comment i replied with she should just break her legs
---
*incessant clicking intensifies*
---
Other comment is correct
---
On PlayStation tons of people keep getting blue screened and have to reset the game, chalk it up to new season bugs like usual üôÅ
---
Denial of service attacks, basically the "hacker" floods the server using a bot net and causes it to be unplayable freezing or disconnecting players. The "hacker" can use these floods to their advantage like in bomb they can make impossible for the defenders to disable a defuser by freezing everyone in place after a plant.

Usually when someone stops giving effort and starts attacking the other person, they've admitted to the world they don't have a serious argument and are too lazy to give one.

Critical thinking would lead you to understanding why what you've said is dumb. I have neither the time nor inclination to continue an argument with someone who would blatantly refuse what is essentially a fact.

That's why it's a short response, because you're dumb
---
My plan is to wait until the second month of the season before playing again. The DDOSing is going to be at its worst right now. Last season it only happened to me a couple times per week after I waited a while.
---
shhhh im riding the tilt wave of getting attacking first 7 times in a row and losing 8 games in placements
---
You can't just "whoooosh" to cover up either the fact that you didn't think about it or your poor attempt at a joke.
---
Yeah i should but what‚Äôs the point this far into the year, we got one more season I would only be getting those ops early and they would have to buy next years season pass
---
I‚Äôve never played lesion. How many gu mines does he have?
---
This is actually a great idea onjah
---
Waste of a bandit charge
---
Excactly. Doc can clearly hear N√∏kk running around and still ruined everything

it‚Äôs a Hobo Johnson song

Frankly it needs a frost trap.

You do have to worry about kaid because he can throw 1 claw and get the wall/hatch if he isnt bad
---
Hey that reminds me of a story.
---
"Back when Army of Two first came out, me and my college roommates, suitemates, were all way too into Halo 3 to really care. I didn't even think Army of Two was on my radar in 2008.
---
My college suitemates would sneak into my room while I wasn't there and play Halo 3 without my permission, on my Xbox, but more importantly, they would look at my DVD collection. I had like 215 DVDs in alphabetical order and they would play a cruel joke where they would move two random titles in different places and see how long it would take me to notice. Yeah, I know that says a lot more about me then it does about them, but I could tell every time that was the joke.
---
I would just scan briefly over my DVDs everyday and see if they had taken one was usually the issue wasn't-I wasn't checking to see if they put them out of order, I was checking because they would turn up MISSING. And then I would track them down and find someone across the hallway who borrowed one without asking and what do you know! The DVD is missing from inside of its jewel case!
---
Where did it go? No one knows. Oh I found it, it's in two pieces now. No, I'm not still angry about that."

Someone at level 200 probably has 1k hours in the game, why shouldnt they have every skin, especially if it's just cosmetic then who cares
---
I agree with everything except ‚Äústart ddosing‚Äù. I will never stoop down that low.
---
 The pros said she doesn't bring anything to the table unlike a thermite or a Nomad, she'll be a troll pick in pro league 
---
the mid season graph proves she's a terrible attacker and so many threads want her gun changed.
---
I‚Äôve had a couple those odd experiences but overall I think everything is going fine except for the constant ddoss problem
---
I was playing yesterday and came across a kapkan+doorshield, and vaulting over the shield didn't trigger the kapkan. Is that normal?
---
You are quite right.
---
Uhhhh
---
7 I believe. And they all take about idk a minute or so to deploy.

Thing is, if someone did get 25 kills they most likely wouldve won.

This is a virtual version of one of those cork boards with all the newspaper clippings and strings connecting seemingly random things.

---
Dont forget the gu on or near the frost trap to confirm the kill

yeahh, but they might not care about it.

The strategy is to wait until late season because you can still have a no rank play or diamond boosting with a copper UNTIL they get ranked

I‚Äôve seen 66000 on PC
---
Ah, ok thanks
---
Was it on PC? Cuz lately we've been crashing for no reason and it's annoying. Ubi should have at least some sort of compensation for this.
---
No it was on Xbox
---
Cool just zoom it in so we can‚Äôt see your shitty connection to the server in the top right of the screen.
---
Zofia feels viable again /s
---
That's what I'm saying. From my experience, the casual MMR (in whatever form it is) doesn't feel like it works properly for players with significant play time. All it does is shelter newer players (which is what newcomer should be for, if they fixed the smurfing).
---
I didn't mention this in my original post, but when casual had random matchmaking, I **never** saw any complaints regarding it, but then when it worked by rank and then had its own MMR introduced, I only see complaints about it. I didn't want to mention this originally since I knew someone would come along and go "Akshually, random is terrible", so here we are haha. For the record though, in my opinion, having skill based matchmaking in casual lobbies is terrible.
---
Now we just need a load of legion mines on there and we‚Äôre set
---
Umm when and what is this?
---
I'm just curious why Favela, the giant paper bag, isn't on the ban list
---
Put a pest there and some barbed wire and a nitro cell lol
---
I quit the challemge after about 7 hours of gameplay, and 1 kill I forgot to record.
---
Ubi I beg buff sledge :(
---
What's the floor plan? Carpet, Tile, Hardwood? How many bedrooms? Bathrooms? Square feet? Please, if you call Chaos home, then I'll have to know if it qualifies.
---
Put an Ela mine on the side lesion in front of the shield and then you good
---
I also don‚Äôt want to ask for anything because them it seems like I‚Äôm lying and just trying to get stuff for free. I just want them to fix issues like this like make it so that if it lag out on the last round you shouldn‚Äôt get banned at all
---
LMAO
---
How easy they go down. Even web stressers knock them off.
---
Bro same I just have up, one of my friends said that opening up and cleaning your ps4 helps but I think that‚Äôs just for general well being of the ps4
---
Oh. That's sucks but that makes literally no sense. Idk how u left the game but it's stupid that you couldn't reconnect. I mean I get that Ubi wants to crack down on the prob but it's ass.
---
How would this enhance gameplay?
---
Report Goyo for griefing
---
Better to have vote you out then then later in the game, saves you time.  I dont understand the thought process (but I know thats already going too far).  I dont get why its more appealing to go 4 vs. 5.  More than likely a group of 6th grade kids screaming into the mic anyway.
---
I'm Type sol bitch
---
The game ended like 20 seconds after I disconnected
---
One frag later
---
Goyo about to be banned like Clash and IQ just you wait.
---
Mute!! Have you been fooking around with me canisters?!
---
As far as ranked maps go, I really only hate Skyscraper tbh. Since they removed hereford and fortress
---
Neither is Theme Park...
---
Fortress, villa, favela
---
Sebastiano?? That‚Äôd be perfect haha
---

Hello RobotMan24, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d58odv/game_keeps_crashing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So many Ela cosplayers recently... All of them better looking than her elite, too.
---
Pretty sure even the pump actions can shoot faster than that.
---
Thanks for the advice. I plan on working on it for sure this was just something really rough put together. Never really didn't anything like this but was super addicting to do so we will see where it goes.
---
If 1 match affects your KD your way too early into the game to care so much about KD. 
---
a .8 change is like just got into ranked levels of change off one match.
---
wow that's some intense stuff right there
---
It's literally nothing but a giant fucking paper bag
---
We all do bruh
---
Had to getaway from his porn sub.
---
He still aint banned...

I agree w some of your points but I would counter and say she did evolve and her play style did change because the players have to in order to do well w her, for reasons previously stated. And I was sharing tips on how I play because obviously we have two different play styles w her, and I‚Äôm the one doing fine where she is. you‚Äôre more so focused on stats but she‚Äôs still got a pretty decent win delta (Another reason ubi won‚Äôt nerf her) and most people would say she‚Äôs fine where she is. what do you suggest she goes back to her pre nerf state? They literally have no way to make her better without being op aside from maybe one buff which would be impacts, anything else on top of that and she would be too strong again. And you agreed with me in saying they extended her learning curve which is basically what I told you yet you said you didn‚Äôt agree lol and don‚Äôt say I have long essays when you give me something like this response. That‚Äôs being hypocritical. and duh she‚Äôs going to get outgunned THATS WHY THEY NERFED HER. You‚Äôre not supposed to win direct gunfights at an ar‚Äôs range or a dmr‚Äôs range anymore. They made it to where you have to be smart how you play her not just running around the map engaging everyone you see, make them come to you, that‚Äôs why I believe she‚Äôs a great shallow roamer, that‚Äôs why the barbed wire is a nice combo w her grzmots, they have to play your game. You‚Äôre wasting their time and until they kill you they can‚Äôt be safe planting the defuser. And you‚Äôre using her mines wrong idc if you call me a cunt. Who puts them in the middle of the floor and who throws them so high that they don‚Äôt work? That sounds more like a you problem then an ela problem, again you gotta be creative w them, I‚Äôve never had anyone in all my 100+ hours w ela spot my mines. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the best ela main ever bc obviously I‚Äôm not but geeze dude you‚Äôre making it sound like she has to 1v5 clutch every round or else she‚Äôs useless.

The warcrime is the duck charm
