Nice

So with me giving a solution to a problem - Which is open for discussion! - is me complaining about it? The community is beging Ubisoft to do something but Ubisoft simply can‚Äôt, it is impossible to recognise. Matimio is making vids about it monthly, other youtuber are discussing it. It doens‚Äôt give Siege on console a Good look which it defenitely deserves. And i‚Äôm not gonna switch because All my RL friends are on ps4.
---
Ok? Do you know the other symbolism of embers tho? It‚Äôs not JUST dark souls. 
---

---
Your just too into it.
---
Rook
---
I recently made the switch and it was a lot smoother than I had thought it was gonna be. It definitely takes some getting used to and using someone else's recommended settings could not work for you. What I found was best was just running through games and in downtime adjust your settings till you get something comfortable.
---
As far as working a keyboard, it just takes getting used to. Read through the control settings, most of them are good by default but depending on your playstyle having some keys being closer might be better for you. Its all up to opinion and practice though.
---
Good luck friend üòÅüòÅ
---
2 - 3 hooks should be enough
---
They nerfed him because they thought he would be to strong compared to warden, now neither of them are as good as Ubi intended
---
I agree with ur bandit main
---
He is definitely not useless, you just can‚Äôt use him as an op entry fragger anymore. You can still use him to deny spraying through smoke and for holding angles with an advantage of having a bright yellow target instead of bland colours.
---
Yeah, I forgot a word in there. Point stands, these are all CoC offenses, so tough luck mate.
---
What are the devs goal when they make/rework a map, which turns out to be unbalanced???
---
You know that at a bare minimum, a PC costs about $1,200?  That‚Äôs not current-gen items.  The specs for the new console series are going to compete with some PCs out there are will be just as fine to play on.  PC elitism isn‚Äôt cool, my guy.
---
Drugs
---
This community sucks. I know the first thing that happened to my friend when he tried it during a free weekend was he got votekicked instantly. It sucks that there are groups of people who 4 stack with the explicit intention of just making the game hell for the 1 random.
---
Jail
---
Do you keep losing or do you just have horrible luck?
---
I fell like you are attacking me for no reason,i just asked jezz,no need to downvote comments and go all into it.
---
All i said is there is a bonefire and its called ember rise,its fitting a ds player whuld assume its a small easter egg.
---
Undercover
---
Beat me to it üòÇüòÇ
---
HAHAHA YOU ARE SO FUNNY I AM CRYING HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA TEACH HOW TO BE AS FUNNY AS YOU HAHAHAHA
---
Ok I don‚Äôt really care at this point, I get it you are a PC elitest that can‚Äôt understand the fact that some people prefer console to PC .
---
I don‚Äôt think the extra deagle shots were necessary, especially after the aim
---
https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-scarlett
---
Btw you are here so you can explain me:
---
"Suggesting someone has mental health issues when being harassed/bullied by other people =/= "a different opinion""
---
That's opinion without a doubt, however you called it != to different opinion therefore - it's also your opinion?
---
Now you will feel the full power of the tk
---
K
---
oh ok... guess I'll only ever play competitive maps with a 5 stack -.-'
---
you are trolling right? you can get a better pc for 500$ you dont have to spend 1200 where tf did you even get that number from as a bare minimum wtf ??????
---
Brilliant idea and balancing but I‚Äôd let Alibi keep her impacts.
---
HA YA SACK
---
*YEAR 4* Season 3
---
 Which is kind of ridiculous when you think about it. 5 years to get matchmaking decent
---
1) restrict defense team to objective so they can lockdown/prep the objective
---
2) no more droning in the beginning of matches!
---
He‚Äôs agreeing with you bud
---
Echo is easy
---
Well i mean you just attacked me for asking a opinion,im pretty sure you have a small bit of toxicity in you as well.
---
Get rook
---
It still annoys me that Smoke's icon has 2 filters but his mask has 1
---
I never downvoted at all, but ok. And I‚Äôm not attacking you, I‚Äôm just saying your probably just making comparisons that don‚Äôt have anything to with each other.
---
Tk
---
Why did I hear the death noise
---
I definitely hear you there. The 3 you mentioned should for sure be gone though in my (and most people‚Äôs) opinion. 
---
I agree with the skill level comment you made.
---
That's really stupid. If I'm buying a console game, that game better fucking work with console hardware. 
---
And my console is set up in the living room, not somewhere I can comfortably use a mouse and keyboard.
---
Surely if you're going to "remove input" you'd remove the keyboard and mouse input.
---
In not even going to touch on the "shooter which is best to play with MnK" because I will be a dick about it
---
Why are you going through my profile damn. I‚Äôm sorry
---
Ooooo
---
Ah there it is. So I‚Äôm not allowed to play ranked just because me and my friends can‚Äôt play together 24/7?
---
No, rook is the only operator you'll ever need
---
can you not just limit to friends that can invite you in privacy settings or something?
---
Between those 3, lesion
---
Ok and thank you for your opinon,just lash out like that,thats how people get mad and into a fight,and i dont want that.
---
Honestly both but its mostly luck
---
You have a amazing kd
---
US? I never really have issues on EU, there'll be the rare TK'er but it's very rare.
---
At least it doesn't have a mind of its own
---
Conceal don‚Äôt feel don‚Äôt let them knoooowwww
---
Well now they knoooowwww
---
Oh  lol now I feel like a dick... I didn‚Äôt even read what he put ü§£
---
I'm at the point where I believe if you using M&amp;K and on console then you are a copper player and need to feel good about yourself by giving yourself a 1000x advantage on console kids.
---
Edit: copper on PC* not console
---
He said he isn't good at controlling recoil though
---
I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm going to bother responding to this pretty obvious bait but here we go.
---
A current retail console is about $299.  A PC that would be able to run Siege would run about $500, that‚Äôs true.  However, a PC at $500 can‚Äôt run Siege WELL, which would be the entire point of switching to a PC.  For graphics cards and other necessary hardware, a PC would run someone between $1,000 and $1,300 at a minimum.  If they‚Äôre going for real quality, they can spend upwards of $2,000, probably more if they wanted current-gen equipment.
---
Don‚Äôt talk about what you don‚Äôt know, my guy.  It‚Äôs embarrassing.
---
Gotta love Xbox. Kinda the reason I haven‚Äôt played the game in a while. That and I just got Overwatch
---
Quick! Delete this before MeatyMarley sees this!
---
Do you and your team have a map that you believe is the "model" of how a Siege map should look, feel, and function? Do you yourself have a personal favorite? Or perhaps a map (besides Kanal) that you worked on that you are the most proud of?
---
What is a setting for a new map that you would really like to see put into the game?
---
Is there another game (any genre) where the level design particularly inspires some of your work in Siege? Is there somewhere else you go for inspiration?
---
Sigh, please tell me this is a shit post of some sort
---
Kaid is actually Harold
---
üíó
---
Imagine dying to someone named Goyo
---
No, sadly there‚Äôs no map this season - or next. We‚Äôre just getting a Kanal re-work.
---
wat time was that cuz i had a full lobby lag spike at like 1:00 maybe
---
Yes there is. You‚Äôre pushing lower ranks down for your own entertainment when you should be playing at your own level.
---
Wouldn't they break when they take Down the barricade? Or am I not ascended enough to get the start?
---
Stick together when you enter the build. Helps to prevent ambushes.
---
Practice setting up cross fires with teammates. The overlapping fields help to get kills or trades. This helps with defending and flushing enemies out of positions.
---
Communicate with your teammates. 5 to 7 words Ask for clarification and double check. If you dont want calls or want less, let people know.
---
Learn the maps. Learn where common transition holes are and which floors and ceilings lead where. Vertical play is very strong in this game.
---
K/D mean nothing if prioritize kills over objective play.
---
Isn‚Äôt Kanal getting reworked in either season 3 or 4 of year 4? Perhaps this is the one?
---
No dude all good,i always do that with any reply as im bored af,tho i just wanna point out as i did in my post dont lash out that much,be more polite in answers and opinions,the dev thing as well i didnt see that but i whuld not be suprised if people where trolling you cause you where screaming at them.
---
Not saying you did but you know what i mean.
---
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong
---
Sadly not. We only get one map this year, which was Outback in the first season. The rest are just map re-works.
---
*While we were busy studying the meta, they were busy studying the abstract...*
---
And people didn't know what his loadout was gonna be, I wasted 50k renown on those 2 ops and would really love to get it back
---
Well I don‚Äôt have clash or lesion, but my friends do and I would go lesion
---
i teamkill people who shoot my mozzie drones
---
A weapon to surpass Metal Gear?!?!
---
You know they can't do anything about it so what's the point in complaining about it
---
Glad the lube made the photo
---
"Ashen one..."
---
I don't think all ops should have a grapple.. the grapple should be an optional item instead of a grenade or claymore.
---
When you play thunt turn off vsync in the settings, itll let the frame rate be higher
---
They keep doing this ip to the point where I alt f4 every match in progress
---
I like that you can be spawn peeked. The fact that you are in a hostile environment from the get go makes all of siege a heart pounding moment. 
---
That being said, spawnpeeking like any other aspect of the game, needs to be balanced. Back in the old days of siege, there were a few angles to where attackers could be killed literally immediately. That was unacceptable. Now though, spawnpeeking requires at least some skill.
---
Not to say "git gud" but you can learn to avoid and or fight spawn peekers. Find which spawns are garbage and advoid them. Peek windows that you know there are possible spawn peekers and prepare for someone to be there or even better, leave a drone on your entrance point and know for certain. Or you could even kill ten seconds in spawn to deter people who are holding angles.
---
It's super frustrating to get killed in spawn before firing a single bullet, but it's super satisfying to slap kids who think that they are about to get an easy pick
---
I wonder what glitches thi... I mean entertainment this op will bring
---
Meanwhile..... Its been 6 months since the R6 credits store has been locked for certain regions.
---
I also said Valkyrie is a good alternative. Her guns have no recoil whatsoever
---
I don't have him either and don't really like his playstyle, but I would still go lesion
---
Literally spicy Clash.
---
Look up some vids on drone spots,and what i usually do is if im with a pre made team(usually am)just take a flor and stick to it,let your team know if its clear and wiggle your mouse oround and jump if you get shot at.
---
Bulshit meter maxed out
---
...you do realize that it even though it was a prototype it was a real gun right? The Six12 and Six12SD are also prototypes that were never used. Not going into mass production doesn‚Äôt make a design fake. And to be exact Zofias LMG is partially based off a Krytac but also a Valkyrie Armament Beltfed M4 (to which the Krytac is also based off). Considering that in the game world team rainbow is a joint **world wide** counter terrorist operation with an unlimited budget, so in that infinity I‚Äôm sure they could make a custom gun such as the V308.
---
I don't believe so. I've change all my setting like that I think. I'll double check.
---
No it was just now. They only lagged when we attacked and if they got plant down it would lag
---
Yo im solo q plat 3 just restarted to play rank this season dm me if your interested. Im from Canada and im chill to.
---
No, it's not about what i like and dont like. Ranked can have as many maps as it wants as long as they are balanced and competitive maps, but you shouldn't be able to pick the maps on it. Casual wouldn't matter if you pick the maps and it can have all maps for all i care
---
Yeah, I just looked it up and I can‚Äôt find a single written piece of information that promised new weapons but then again based on the previous Season Passes it was kind of expected.
---
It‚Äôs a big problem actually. You don‚Äôt need to be bad to lose to smurfs, you could be gold, but diamonds smurfs can outclass you and your team heavily. I like how you‚Äôre bitching about matchmaking on your fucking smurf. It‚Äôs quite pathetic.
---
DDOS'ing is so stupid.
---
That attacker sounds amazing!
---
Should've used the shotgun for some real skeet shooting.
---
Use her shotgun...
---
we rushed them on attack and killed them before they could. OT now
---
Blur gamertags. Witchhunting is against reddit rules
---
Doc, I got shot, I need healing.  
---
No, you don't need healing. Just don't get shot again.
---
We don‚Äôt need new weapons
---
That's a great idea but also an unfair waste of time. Puts the attackers at a real disadvantage.
---
The visuals are great, and there are some heist aspects of it that are cool, but overall, it's nothing particuarly memorable. I'd give it a solid 5/10. Very average.
---
I'm pretty sure the subreddit makes up a tiny fraction of the player base. I say "pretty sure" because I don't have all the figures in front of me and can't do the math accurately. With reddit being reddit, popular opinions like "toxicity bad" are bound to receive more attention than shit like "lol isn't it funny to bully newcomer playlist."
---
Sledge is largely popular at least, but then there‚Äôs always no hard breacher possible to use which is ridiculous
---
If you get shutdown by Cav the problem isn't who you're banning. It's you.
---
Same reason as jackel. She‚Äôs annoying
---
I'm more wondering how many people even know who the artist of this piece is. Though he said he's cool with ppl using it for meme template.
---
U good?
---
Just wait until the reveal how the gameplay looks.
---
What‚Äôs ddosing
---
I said their push
---
So refund the people or give them another free op or give them the next operation for free. They can‚Äôt just leave it in the game when it‚Äôs desperately overpowered
---
The defender is gonna make J√§ger sad
---
The tire is A N G E R Y
---
hair too long
---
Shes so easy to counter and nobody plays her seriously
---
I play on PS4 and my username is Epickiller8787.
---
Source?
---
The invisibility of the spider drone combined with the thermal scan seems OP. Wouldn‚Äôt be mad if it had one but not both, ya know?
---
I feel like issue is easier to deal with. Nerf attack and perhaps all attackers a bit.
---
The whole idea of dying before getting a chance to meaningfully participate in a round turns a lot of people away from the game. It's just a bad mechanic that doesn't have a good counterplay.
---
That‚Äôs an OOF
---
Oh my god it does or a slayer album cover
---
Thank you
---
you gave me chills
---
He‚Äôs clearly a pro player. Be grateful he showed you a 200 IQ move.
---
intentionally lagging the server so no one can move or ending the game entirely
---
At least the 3rd time this has been posted. You're the first to take a literal photo instead of print screen. A function build into your computer to take photos of your screen. 
---
Low effort is low.
---
Late response but it's funny now that you mentioned it. 
---
The artist who drew this started to use bigger and more noticeable watermark to show clearly that it is his work and bunch of ppl came forward saying how he's ruining his artworks and being an insecure.
---
I understand your point about it being cooler when a new player gets it, but you said you were tired of seeing aces by vets. If someone makes a good play I‚Äôd like to see it regardless of rank or experience. That‚Äôs was my point
---
True. But he takes my down
---
I saw this on youtube and thought it was the announcement for Burnt Horizon but was translated so it said Ember Rise
---
Somewhat new here: why does echo get banned in ranked? I don‚Äôt feel like the drone is that OP
---
There's one in the hallway next to the shark room on outback
---
that's still the solution for the vast majority, no idea what happened on your part
---
See thats the problem soft breachers like sledge get punished by lesion or doc its the late game stuff bc no intel means a lot ur plan will differ if theres a cav or maestro
---
Hmm. I don't usually get angry but when I do it's not like toxic levels. If anything I'll just be like "what are these guys doing??" Also I may not improve quickly quick but I do generally try to improve. But you know what, if u wanna lmk what ur discord is and hmu there.
---
Shut
---
Lost but twitch and iq
---
I don‚Äôt want to be refunded in R6 credits, since I bought the season pass for the ops. Free ops isn‚Äôt useful for season pass holders or people who have all ops already.
---
To add to that, the only time Clash was overpowered, was when she was bugged. But it seems they‚Äôve fixed that
---
Situations and tutorial videos will give you a good renown bump, somewhere around 7k with 3 stars. Can get a bunch of ops.
---
Theme park is kinda likr a drug bust
---
You could get a vpn. A good one that you have to pay for. I recommend NordVPN
---
Anyone don‚Äôt like this skin? Her face looks weird
---
how would the clash prevent you from slapping her shield?
---
ü§°
---
There are 2 types of people in this world.
---
I will dude, thanks
---
How about Ela with a bikini on
---
Wait is this real or fan made
---
I slighty see the Grunt from Halo.
---
Indeed
---
Watch the tutorials in the main menu. You can skip them once they start. 200 renown each. 
---
Also make sure to 3-Star the situations for around 700 each. Should get you like half of the original operators.
---
Just how it's always been haha. Where/when I grew we got the Monday and the Wednesday.
---
Oh shit yeah I saw a dick but now that image is in my head forever
---
Reset it. It‚Äôs not that hard
---
Alt+Enter
---
Doesnt affect the newer/common thing where they just attack the server. 
---
VPNs will help the older invite to party and attack individual players method tho.
---
Well at the point where you used the renown you already knew his loadout and how strong he was for 3 weeks...
---
Had some dumbasses testing it out on casual matches, i dont think its limited to higher ranks.
---
Agreed. As a csgo vet i feel siege community is a mess. I mean most of my csgo game is full of verbal toxicity, mostly racist and banter, but siege take it the whole level. Fail clutch? Get trashtalk and vote kicked. 2 round behind? Let's surrender. Oh you pick my Jaeger? Whoops there's goes you head. I don't know why i keep coming back to siege, maybe I'm a masochist.
---
The gadgets seem very well thought out and aren‚Äôt too overpowered(maybe tone down the heatwaves a bit). The balances, eh. I think IQ is fine as is but Alibi‚Äôs buff would be welcome.
---
Overall, great job! I‚Äôd definitely like to see these in game(especially the spyders).
---
Maybe get a 5 stack then? There are multiple ways of finding people to play with.
---
I mean it is on ps4, so doesn‚Äôt count
---
I don‚Äôt understand why during 1v5s the team with majority (if they are defending) doesn‚Äôt play time.
---
*shits pants*
---
Haha
---
I had an hour long queue time once and it just gave an error report and requeued
---
No thanks
---
I always thought it was a phosphorus round
---
For Honor become No Honor now but that's understandable since the Fighting game community would be like that. I play Tekken online and it's just like For Honor, full of fish's IQ human being. Stop playing since the Chinese faction update, never been so happy.
---
found the idiot
---
‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù
---
Will it be the pattern we have been seeing lately where the maps have been biger then they need to be?
---
Castle is hard to play but he is actually good, or well, average and useable for a defender. problem is that he also appeals to bad players. it's a volatile mix.
---
While I have my complaints, that is absolutly not true. The game runs vastly better than pre op health and it is much less of a shitshow. I have my complaints, but it is better.
---
Just because you don't enjoy something doesn't mean other people shouldn't.
---
I figure we aren‚Äôt getting payed, we‚Äòre competing for meaningless charms. There‚Äòs no point in getting upset about anything. I mean, maybe if one of us had a shot at Pro league or something it might be more justifiable, but we were playing high gold and low plat.
---
It's because he's low level lol, rookies don't get respect, you gotta earn it, that's some real shit
---
He has two invisible drones that can ping and denies plants.
---
that rappel spot
---
#again
---
why theme park?
---
the only defender gun that can destroy the shield in 1 shot is tachankas lmg
---
First time?
---
I was playing with this guy he was complaining the entire game about stupid shit and the looking for group system on xbox is pretty bad
---
The problem is the community doesnt give them the chance to earn it. Below level 30? Insta kick. Lose a 1v5 clutch because the 4 stack all spawnpeeked and died? Insta kick. You pick rook? Rook mine, tk. Everyone gets respect until they lose it, siege community is on some child shit.
---
Reminds me of Turok
---
it literally just hit it's all time high active playerbase this month, it's everything but dead.
---
til there's thunt only players in this game
---
Directed by Christopher Nolan.
---
Use r/R6STeams then or the official discord.
---
i‚Äôll gladly pay you tuesday for all of those today
---
It was never going to be anyone other than ash.
---
Csgo toxicity mostly verbal banter though, also their banned is ridiculous. My Smurf got banned for 1,5 years in 2017 from MMR and 3 weeks communication ban because my 5 stack just goofing around and asking enemy team to report us. Siege toxicity is in another level. Pick their main ops, wrong reinforced, gadget placement, early round TK, etc.
---
Much. Not not at all.
---
If they actually made good maps no one flips their shit
---
You realize Thatcher exists and can take those out?
---
Bandit can bandit trick CCTV wall and Kaid tosses one on the garage wall down low, and then uses his other for either Construction wall or helping Bandit stop the breach.
---
Not an original idea also this is literal power creep. Why take thermite when you could take this operator.
---
PL finals are not a major. But I did not know that the group stages don't count towards the charms
---
Doesnt remove outback. Lol
---
map has a bad design.

I was playing on the tower map and the other team put a bullet prof camera in the middle of a reinforced window

Don‚Äôt you dare take away Alibi‚Äôs impacts Ubi

I'm pretty sure I was in the same game as you, I think I was doc.

---
Everything you do will have advantages and disadvantages from anyway you look at it.
---
I had not said that having high latency to a server was an outright advantage, but more that it has its advantages. Which means that it also has disadvantages as well.
---
You also seem to not look at the clip that the OP showed, clearly showing the blatant advantage that the person with the high ping had on the montagne *in that scenario*
---
Please next time read what people say, instead of reading what you want to read so you can prove a point.
---
I‚Äôd be more concerned for Alibi than my grandma
---

I guess you can say you, smoked them out?

Awwwwwww yeeaaaaaaaaa

L2P
---
I love how you went and replied to his automatically removed post after this haha
---
u can learn to play trash stuff, doesnt mean they arent trash.
---
Watched this and I still think mpx should be replaced with the p90. This clip doesn‚Äôt make me think the mpx is a good weapon if that‚Äôs what you were trying to accomplish.
---
Mpx is a good weapon if you can land shots
---
I was born there
---
You don‚Äôt. The game just acts as though the game with the hacker never happened. OP won the game with a hacker so they reverted all MMR for everyone involved, which in this case meant taking it away
---
Just like any other weapon with that logic.
---
Didn‚Äôt they make it to the finals?
---
Grappling hook is confirmed
---
Super tactical, way to go ubi. üëç this isn‚Äôt fortnite for frig sake
---
It‚Äôs like a car chase scene every time I take my drone in at the beginning of a round.
---
Yes. It is a bold and dangerous strat but when done correctly grants an easy kill
---
at least it was ela
---
We live in a society
---
Man I remember the days where having a soft wall beside ur mira was such a pro gamer move.
---
Most points are viable. People just dont want to learn them, so they just pick the most common. All sites on Sky Scraper dont really have a variety of windows.  I believe they all have one window, like most maps do.  
---
Chalet is fine, i dont agree with what that person said. IMO, its a pretty balanced maps. Every point is good for bomb except one but I forgot which one it was because nobody goes there.
---
Are those trees talking?
---
I did it already, now my karma is just 8.
---
+10 points
---
The easiest way to do it it to have someone out of sight (preferably cav) and wait for them to see the mirror and then attack
---
My tip is just dont sweat it, grab that recruit, and show the no-attachment gun up their orifices,
---
We had that problem for quite a while too, but it seems to have sorted itself out
---
I can agree with that
---
it would've taken 1 second to let him back in, getting a early kill isn't stupid.
---
I call them armor plates.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the reveal omg
---
Yall got orange soda?
---
Welcome to the Jungle, we got shit on sticks.
---
You will see(:
---
i can only get as far back as skull rain, you know of somewhere i can get stuff for dust line and black ice
---
Maybe the CIGS in the Amazon (Jungle War Instruction Center), though there's already a map for the Brazilians.
---
Did you have the Twitch Elite on?   Would've made it even more glorious having a Nazi domed by a French Resistance themed skin.
---
I mean... you could just get universal red skin. Or is there detail I cant see from this picture?
---
Upvoting because giving credit in Title. 
---
When people don‚Äôt give credit in title but instead save it for a comment, it is still bullshit and karmawhoring bc many people don‚Äôt read the comments. Just scroll, upvote, move on.
---
Wish there was a rule that credit must be in title
---
Lmao no I did not, but now I wish i did
---
Damn straight man.
---
I‚Äôve been restarting it after 1 and a half minutes, then decided to see how long it would take before I got in. I posted this when it hit 30 minutes, then restarted again.
---
CONFIRMED: MIRA IS BEING REWORKED INTO A TRAP OPERATOR. 
---
Hide yo kids, hide yo wives, and hide yo husbands...
---
*bump*
---
he's not even playing, he's spectating.
---
Dude thats sic
---
What makes it‚Äôs better is when your carrying your whole team and they send something like this or TK you
---
Dafuq
---
That would refer to the or their just being toxic, I'm level 100 and it still happens to me so I cant say its cause low level. Not really sure why people have to be toxic
---
his gun seems a lil op, and his drone is a moving valk cam that also stuns...
---
Do you really not play with soft walls by Mira?
---
Oh I see it now
---
yeah bro i was 11 and 2 this guy was on other team
---
summer aint over yet Kev
---
I love step 2 as well lol, out of all steps I feel like it would greatly imporve warden.
---
Nope, the flame shield gadget thing is the Defender OP.

I never said they were coppers I‚Äôm just saying smudging in general is something that you shouldn‚Äôt do. Insulting people doesn‚Äôt make urself look smarter.
---
Mira's cant be placed on the soft side of the wall though... only the metallic reinforcement side.
---
Chalet and house are 2 of my favourite maps lol. Those are the 2 maps where it‚Äôs the least snowbally in my experience, both teams have a good chance of winning each round
---
You can just bring IQ or Thatcher to disable the drone for a few seconds so you can plant
---
Sad that in Argentina you can't buy them :(. But glad for you :)

Last match I was playing enemy team banned thermite and tachanka

I got the game and played for the first time at the end of April this year. Currently over level 100 and still playing everyday. You had your toxic people here and there but I honestly didn‚Äôt think it was that bad, I was able to go from a complete noob to pretty confident. Definitely not bad enough to ever make me think about quitting the game. The team killing and stuff like that is the worst part but not too big of a problem especially in ranked. The occasional toxic chat I sometimes get a rise out of watching and listening to as it brings me back to my glory days of modern warfare 1, 2, and black ops.
---
For me it‚Äôs actually different things most games
---
They would never say it to someone's face. They're just toxic, sad people. Don't respond. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I had a 4 stack rotate TK'ing me in ranked every round. They invited me to their party so they could talk shit. The whole time they were calling me "beaner", "wetback" etc. I hadn't said a single word to them. I still didn't say a word to them. I just stayed in their party not saying a word even after the game was over until they were like "this isn't even fun." and kicked me. I got a slight victory out of how disappointed the little shit was. They just wanted a response and i never gave it to them.
---
Won't it just get destory when he put his Fuze on the window
---
I feel the ones needing to be ban more are Ela, Thatcher, Jackal, and Lession because jackal counters cav and other roamers and and you can just use IQ or Thatcher to destroy/disable the Echo drone
---
I agree! But unfortunately that was a bit to tricky for me. For now anyway
---
She might be too strong with that. Buff the FMG more like
---
Yes. Any competent devs would have done that from the start or at least set a restriction for what people can matchmake together but this is Ubisoft we are talking about
---
Oh no! Alibi isn‚Äôt holding the gun from her loadout? That‚Äôs so stupid! If the gun isn‚Äôt in her loadout that means she canonical has never fired or used that weapon, and therefore her holding it in her picture is breaking the lore! Also, it‚Äôs not like this has ever been pointed out before a million times!
---
Big ol /s right there
---
Bro I swear I have 600 hours in this game and I‚Äôve probably seen toxicity like less then 50 times, might just be the region or something. But when it does happen just try to forgot about it and more importantly don‚Äôt say anything to them because that‚Äôs what they want.

---
oh wow! you‚Äôre the FIRST person to notice this. mind you it‚Äôs been a year since she‚Äôs been released. LITERALLY the FIRST one to notice and post about it.
---
I believe that it's remote activated. I'm not sure if there is a remote detonator though but seems like anyone can detonate it by shooting.
---
Yeah but Ubi and many ppl who played her during PTR caught on and managed to bring her down to much more fair state. Right after her release, she was no where as oppressive as Ela or Lion, who were absolutely monster on their own. 
---
Nothing about Nokk or Warden was changed other than Nokk later receiving that 2 extra second for her gadget. 
---
If anything, there were more ppl defending Nokk saying how OP she will be for countering cams but turns out it really doesn't matter and that her role can easily be filled by 3 Speed operators with more efficiency overall.
---
Montagne allows for some bullshitty strats, I vouch for my team to ban him every time I play ranked. &gt;_&gt;
---
Git gud
---
If you use him correctly he's one of the most powerful operators in the game by a long shot. The intelligence and objective denial that he can provide is completely uncontestable. it's been a few months since I was particularly into the tournament scene, but at the time I believed he was the most banned operator in the pro leagues
---
That shit happens in silver. In fact lower levels tend to either ban all shields or jackal and a shield
---
no. Smoke doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
Hostage is the only time I will pick fuse.... for the meme
---
The bars on the side were added at the start of this season as part of his rework. If you stand still you will be able to fully see through smoke, but as you move or strafe left and right the bars will go down indicating that you will start to lose your ability to see through smoke
---
You almost have to play rainbow with someone, new people aren‚Äôt given a chance to play which is a shame.
---
The attacker seems kinda worthless
---
You really a copper 4?
---
Happy cakeday!
---
Sadly no one likes to pick Thatcher and want to just Ash all 3 attacker rounds.
---
Haha, when people overuse the "bruh, F, oof" and other Reddit comments and call others normie for using emojis. 
---
I despised emojis until the pretentious redditors tried downvoting and harassing emoji users, saying that they are superior to emoji users. You guys are pathetic
---
It increases the thermal visibility the more still you stand. If you stand still the bars increase and the scope changes.
---
Last three games, no lie, in ranked i've had one teammate disconnect each game immediately. 4V5 3 games in a row.
---
Their*
---
look, it's been a rough season
---
Ah i‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs my mistake, for some reason i thought you had said something about PC. I play on ps4 as well and haven‚Äôt run into this issue. If the reinstall didn‚Äôt work then i have no clue. Restore licenses possibly?
---
It‚Äôs absolute aids but there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it lol. I started playing in Grim Sky and the casuals in that season where around my rank like bronze/silver even copper players. And then the next season our squad won a ton of games at the start of the season in causal, making us play against high plats/diamonds on pc. Just gotta try to learn from them, after two seasons of absolute hell in casual I‚Äôve made it to plat 3 his season consistently and I can actually compete with the high plat players now. But not diamond players, they are way too good at this game
---
From my understanding the new rank reset starts you half way between the highest ELO you reached in the season and 2500mmr.
---
While new weapons are nice, I do appreciate the effort made by Ubisoft to get guns that aren‚Äôt used as often more use. Granted, they did an awful job of it, but I‚Äôd like to see some more variety in loadouts just from what we already have. 
---
Like IQ has 3 guns, but really only 1 is used with the other 2 being off meta. Why not give an attacker the G8? Giving another operator the FMG wasn‚Äôt a bad idea, practically no one uses it, why waste time trying to balance another weapon where there‚Äôs already one that‚Äôs perfectly fine because it‚Äôs not atrocious by any means, it‚Äôs an entirely average SMG. So why not give it to a new op to prevent a potential launch Ela.!
---
I feel you. Ranked this season had been an absolute shitfest
---
Asking the real questions
---
That‚Äôs why some people play with a full team so they each have a specific role but if you don‚Äôt have a full team then it‚Äôs difficult
---
On the bright side, and given the fact they're esports players, this isn't as cringey as it would have been to see them try to hash out a poorly executed, uncoordinated, awkward handshake
---
The extra one is for Cav's a$$
---
&gt;I believe they all have one window, like most maps do.
---
Office has 3 windows with lines of sight towards the objective rooms, Kitchen has 2 (3 if you count stairs windows), Tea has 2 windows and a 3rd on geisha since that a key room, Master as 2 windows and a 3rd cutting one of the rotations. 
---
Chalet has a balcony that can cut off most of the rotations with a BB. Almost all the topfloor sights have more windows with lines of sight than wall. the only 2 main viable rooms are kitchen and showmobile but thats fucked if you have a mav with half a brain.
---
So when Hank slapped Connor for not pulling him up the side of the building during that android chase?  Gotcha.  Brutal.
---
In all seriousness, it does legitimately sound like a good and slightly funny idea.  It probably won‚Äôt happen but it would be a fun gimmick.
---
I'm going to be playing a bit of both, hopefully I can do that
---
the 18th? what happens on the 18th?
---
That is such a niche scenario, completely and utterly useless.
---
Turn up your left stick deadzone. Controller probably has stick drift.
---
Nice m8
---
Probably just a controller issue, I had to up the dead zone on one of my joysticks because it would randomly drift up.
---
Assuming that this redesign cuts down on spawn peeking, what is the design team‚Äôs mentality with respect to spawn peeks? Are there some that you want to be available or are you trying to completely eliminate them? Why has the team‚Äôs mentality evolved since originally designing maps (like Kanal) that were replete with spawn peeks?
---
Can you do Ying or Mute?
---
The reveal of the next season. It‚Äôs happening live on that day before the Grand Final for the Raleigh Major.

---
I can try both üôÇ if you want you can message me on discord and I‚Äôll update you on them. (Lykos#7456)
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone bans these operators, just because they pose a nuisance if a good person plays them. I always try to ban an op that has some sort of strategical advantage on a map, particularly Mira or thatcher.
---
They won lol the bronze is the enemy team
---
You‚Äôre a shitskull OP, your team are good people
---
It has a lighting issue and the only sightly badly design areas are hunting and train which is getting a rework this year. 
---
Outside of that it as 3 good sites to defend with multiple rotations and vertical gameplay. the attackers also have multiple access routes to the objective rooms.
---
It is a great cosmetic, just not to you
---
Lesions kinda hot tho
---
That sub is so fucking terrible. 
---
It‚Äôs just a huge circle jerk, text posts that are 90% of the time ‚ÄúI asked a girl out‚Äù ‚Äúshe said no‚Äù, some stupid fucking ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù about some extension of a rule. ‚ÄúWe want shit posts‚Äù almost every post in hot is fucking awful lol.
---
[removed]
---
Yep. Those op emblems were gone by the full release.
---
Got anything to back that up outside of your opinion? 
---
Majority of the newer maps start off defender sided cause its a new map, nothing to do with design. If you learn to play the map, its a really well designed map that is easy to make callouts, multiple good objectives to play on with vertical gameplay and rotations.
---
Pc is easier in terms of mechanics than it is on console. Aiming is easier as recoil is easier to control, more reliable button presses and so on
---
My gf loves this game and ever since she got placed in copper this season she is almost always kicked for no reason, even just from casual matches.
---
rainbow six siege is a completely fair and balance game with absolutely no game breaking bugs or matchmaking issues and of course there are absolutely no hacker issues or massive console issues that make the game unplayable on console.

Console versions of the game doesnt have any methods to change FOV settings in game due to performance requirements.
---
Increasing it can reduce fps which on the original xbox one and ps4 can go below the target 60fps.
---
yeah i told my friends to buy ash, jager, thermite, doc and to aim for the head. within a month they placed like gold 4 but that was during break where we didn‚Äôt have school and could play until we got bored/tilted. if giving new players 20 base ops is fine but i just get annoyed when people think new players need crutches when i had to learn by myself and didn‚Äôt have any help
---
Probably. I‚Äôm pretty sure they just don‚Äôt want uninteresting guns that could‚Äôve just been replaced with an existing one. Hopefully the new stuff we do see is cool af
---
Oh I see thank you!
---
Tbh for me it‚Äôs Warden because he‚Äôs just my AP English teacher doing what he‚Äôs always wanted to do.
---
If there were less operators I'd agree but I think we've gotten to the point where having the original 20 shouldn't be a big deal. We have 60 at this point right? The originals help teach the fundamentals of siege.
---
Yes
---
Ummmm it might just be the servers or a problem with ubi or steam cuz this happened with Xbox where the service for purchases went down so I waited about 24 hours until they fixed it so maybe go to steam support
---
Thought this was el dorado at first glance
---
I miss old launch siege. From what I remember it felt a lot more tactical and realistic.
---
Idk the new siege look just isnt the same. Hands down tho we have better servers, net code, and SOOO many less bugs

And ask for a refund?

When i just started the game i get kicked too every game and i quit the game after that and then the newcomer playlist came out and i played till i was level 50 and played casual normally. My best recommendation is newcomer playlist i guess

so you‚Äôre not even old enough to play the game lol
---
I played csgo for 2000 hours and r6 is definitely more toxic while i only play 200h of r6
---
You‚Äôre saving $25 in exchange for ops that are basically necessary to play the game. This is such a familiar scheme that EA played with Battlefront. The problem is, they‚Äôll get away with it because the people who have the game, have the game. We‚Äôre so far in that there aren‚Äôt a ton of people joining the game.
---
I think it‚Äôs a shitty practice to bleed an extra 25$ from people who are just starting out. The learning curve on a game like this is already extremely high, and the fact that okay i buy ash. Now I‚Äôve used all my credits, first game in, someone picks ash before i can, now I‚Äôm stuck with recruit, which usually involves getting TKed, or vote kicked, not to mention the fact that as a new player you‚Äôre trying to learn a game so reliant on abilities and attachments, and you get neither on recruit.
---
1k 1.5k each and I can tell you csgo is more tosic as least that was my experience.

Since I have installed the Overwolf extension for showing stats about matches I see that the matchmaking factors K/D way more than actual ranks. It's very rare to see a match where the K/D is not balanced. 
---
PS: Coming from a match where we just beat players with 2rank above us. so I think it's a way better factor.
---
Awaited a Bikini or sexy swimming suit for my girl... Now Im disappointed.
---
Recoil control did not exist at the time of this video
---
I mean that was happening from the get go when the base ops weren‚Äôt free on the standard edition. And if they aren‚Äôt free anymore then it‚Äôs still a issue really. Lower players get treated like shit by toxic people especially in this game with the ever rising popularity.

Were you drunk while writing the Operator "balancing", no contacts for alibi is completly dumb it would be like ela as her contacts got taken away, then the angled grip for jager is a horrible idea, if you would do this you could give ash also an angled grip for her r4c and that would end in hell. And at last contacts for frost? Why would they do this they would probably give her a shield back but contacts?
---
I‚Äôd leave fucking instantly, I‚Äôm not a smart man but I recognize the sheer fucking mind games this man is playing
---
If the hook is as quiet as the maverick gadget it's already OP tbh
---
Maps like Coast and Skyscraper where defenders already breach the hatches themselves depending on site, the attacker can silently grapple is strong as f.

Pretty sure it worked for Epstein.

I think neraly every PC can run R6. I also take small steps into PC and I think Im decent... Coming from nearly 600 hours of PS4 gameplay no starting with PC and I have to admit it is really fun there, but Im only level 20 or so, so game knowledge is there but the mouse is not yet under control :-)

i was wondering on how you predicted that! ;)

There is software than can differentiate movements between MnK and controller. MnK can only move forward, backward, left, or right.. it can‚Äôt mimic the 360 and diagonal movements of a controller. Ubi is just too cheap to implement

LMAO don't make me sick Id never play rainbow with a controller, it's great how widely available these adapters are, you keep using your feet ;)

Oh I see, I‚Äôm sure they can work out something for Xbox too if Ubi would concentrate on their console player base a bit more.

---
I don't know, I've got authenticator
---
I imagine going with that method is just not possible.
---
Not only does it varies very much with the map and the site, but defense will always be easier due to the fact, that it doesnt require so much teamwork with "randoms" like attacking does.
---
I think there are way too much variables to use this approach with balancing. Besides i dont think its needs that much balance atm, either you have enough skill to outgun the enemy team alone, or your able to work as a team and communicate. Otherwise you deserve to loose the attack :D
---
So you admit I'm good, well at least you know your place I suppose, beneath me.

You fool, you utter fool. His way of thinking is too complex for the human mind to understand.

This is why I mainly stopped voicing my opinion on subs for a certain game. Keep sucking ubi's dick while playing a flawed game while believing that trickle down balance is what happens when you listen to the community. 
---
But hey, my bad for voicing the experiences me and tons of others have had in 2K hours of playtime. This is why you only see circlejerking hive-minded people. Because someone whose arguments conflict the main opinion get bombarded with the same 3 facts that boil down to "stop crying they want money", and "it's normal".

Also, the core playerbase would get lost? Then why is 60-70% of the former player base gone right now?

The first couple DLCs were very lackluster, Forsaken basically was a Taken King type DLC were they tried to launch the game in shambles and patch it through payed dlc. The annual/season pass they said was optional is completely pay to win. Pretty soon we‚Äôll have a promising looking expansion that got delayed another month, but even if its good I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs saving destiny for me. Playing Destiny 1 from launch gave me trauma.

It's called [Whack-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole)

**Whac-A-Mole**
---
Whac-A-Mole is a popular arcade redemption game invented in 1976 by Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc.
---
In Japan, „É¢„Ç∞„É©ÈÄÄÊ≤ª (mogura taiji, "Mole Buster") is a popular arcade game invented in 1975 by Kazuo Yamada of TOGO, based on ten of the designer's pencil sketches from 1974, licensed to Bandai in 1977. It can also be commonly found at Japanese festivals.
---
A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a large, waist-level cabinet with five holes in its top and a large, soft, black mallet.

Someone suggested (with a different post) (so not exactly my idea though I tweaked it slightly to fit what I‚Äôd want to see) an Operator that works kinda like Smoke with deploying gas grenades but these ones are flammable if they get shot or have explosions interact with them- they blow up for a fairly big explosion that‚Äôs a mix between Capitaos fire bolts and a C4 blast.
---
Is this real?

This is exactly what I thought when I saw his video on that lol. Nice work!

the poster of the video, LiberDBell, started arguing with me that it was okay to smurf because other people do it.. and I guess I just completely broke down his whole psyche because he deleted every single comment he posted in our thread lmao
---
TL;DR He deranks on a smurf account to play against copper/bronzes (as seen in the video) when he's really a (gold) to make him feel like he's actually decent at the game
---
Already tried changing the mapping for the voip, again nothing

Thanks everyone; I've concluded I'm trash at this game - not playing it, I'm not having fun being beaten even though I have relatively decent gameplay, maybe silver levelü§îü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or who knows maybe I'm actually genuinely a shitty copper player stuck in Bronze

You can hardly see the upper part of alibi's face due to the mask.
---
What?
---
So we are getting the grappling hook I assume on attack and defence the vulcan shield. Vulcan is the got of fire so I'm guessing some form of fire shield. Maybe like capitao on defence?
---
I Think it was unintentional as it was shortly removed after I windowed my game.
---
Minecraft Steve confirmed operator.
---
You guys do know that the MP5K and the FMG are the same guns stat-wise, right?
---
That would be pretty cool to have a Capitao like defence op, would provide a lot of plant denial.

&gt; I assume you as I where raised in the USA they literally teached is to speak both Spanish and French both of them
---
I just had a stroke reading that.
---
Tinfoil indeed, the new face might not fit but the old face was ugly and also not Japanese.
---
Again, lived in Japan for a while. What features are you specifically looking for? Crazy pointed eyes? That differed on person to person. I knew japanese people who didn't have slanted eyes and I knew people who did. It's not like this inherent trait they all share.
---
FMG and MP5K are the same guns
---
You can get in there normally with an impact, it‚Äôs on the basement site of plane. My friends and I reinforced ourselves in with a Mira and somehow won.
---
Yeah the link doesnt work only sends you to the main ubisoft page, big mess up on their part lol
---
First instance 
---
You didnt mention shooting default cam nor any intel ops. Seeing you or getting a callout or even a ping when on cams. 
---
Second time
---
Drones can still give callouts and you said you peaked-- which makes noise. 
---
I remember I have gotten defuser kills outside theough obscure window angles with single bullets just by luck. I wall bang or prefire random areas they may be since its hard to fully run out of ammo in R6. You miss 100% of the shots you dont take. If Jager doesnt guess youre there and start shooting, then you have the advantage. Sounded like him and thatcher had a purpose and pushed at the right moment. 
---
Just get it on video next time. Every platform for R6 has recording software available.

people who can‚Äôt figure out how to screen record shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to post here

Blackbeard was hella OP

just don't play the game at all lol 4head

Basically smoke with fire
---
I agree with this post but I think Operation Health is a black sheep too considering most people and their fucking mother didn't appreciate the fixes that came with it. We could use an Operation Health 2 though. There's stuff that does need fixing, like the shite matchmaking, etc. But I could see people getting pissed off because they could just do the fixes in a mid season patch or whatever. Tbh I wouldn't mind not getting new ops for a season again if we were to get lots of fixes and quality of life improvements.
---
Still awesome!
---
No, I went in-game and saw nothing like this. It is definitely legit though, as url leads you to a 404 rather than the index page as it would if the page did not exist.

Exactly, doesn't excuse my terrible shooting though lol

Great art, have you done the other operators?

Has the original ever been ported to any of the other newer R6's?

Found one, out of 500 packs he got a mix of black ice and legendary items totalling 35....so if I bought 25 packs, it would be considered lucky to get 1....lol
---
When people advised TH, they meant lone wolf.  That's the only way most people play it (and what they use to warm up/work on aim).  That should take care of the queue time problem with TH.
---
As for multiplayer, I would recommend just going into casual instead of newcomer.  The matchmaking times are much lower, you'll find fewer smurfs, and people play better (not as good as ranked, but smarter than newcomer).  The only real negatives are that you will be facing more experienced players, playing on a much larger map pool (i.e. more to learn), and you will likely face some toxicity (due to being low level and playing like it).
---
Have you watched varsity‚Äôs copper to diamond? Gold is hell in matchmaking. And the silvers we‚Äôre low. 4 and 2 3‚Äôs. So f off asshole.
---
Blitz, jakal, echo and cav or often cavs substitute is lesion or Mira.
---
A bow operator would be cool. Maybe an insta kill if hit anywhere in the body or something like that
---
No
---
Legend has it, she is still flanking with it
---
What you can do that helps me when I want to try a new sens or warm up is you go to setting turn all the maps off for thunt except house turn aim assist off and play a lone wolf so you can just go into a quick thunt alone and practice aim or recoil of guns

I bet you're fun at parties.

Oof

It good be cool if it was synced with the action and the beat but it's all kinda messy and make it more subtle its a bit too much and too prolonged

Lol üòÇüòÇ i didnt mean it like that

So if every gun is basically the same thing and the differences are so small that they‚Äôre not even worth addressing...then why would Ubi take the time to program new guns with different RoF, Dam, and Recoil to begin with? And for that matter if aesthetics are a shallow reason, why not just make 1 SMG, 1 AR, 1

DMR etc. for the entire game?  Not to mention varying weapon attachments for each weapon.

Nice.

Good lord that‚Äôs a long bow

Well said. I had a similar thought and the only conclusion I came up with is that people have being playing this game for too long. 3 and a half years and they've gone full Colonel Kurtz. Except instead of committing war crimes they've just become intolerable cunts. Colonel Kuntz if you will

Does this mean the hook operator can also be used for windows? I thought she was only allowed to use it for hatches. Because if you can also use it for windows, that would be sick af.

Generally speaking, yes they have. But this year so far has been the opposite.

Get a desk lol.
---
Pretty sure this is Finka, right?
---
Maybe you should play some casual, because casual has random matchmaking and you can befriend someone with a higher rank such as Gold for example. If you want to rank up, you have to learn the maps, know the call outs, you have to have semi-good gun skills (aim), you have to learn some strats, learn the META (Most effective tactic available), you have to drone more often and face-check less often, etc. Generally, if you want to rank up, you have to put in time and effort. As I saw in your other comment, you've put in 700 hours into this game, but you don't know the maps? How's that possible? Do you only play on site? You can use custom game to go around the maps, learning them without anyone killing you, you can use terrorist hunt for that too and to practice your aim. You can watch YouTube videos on how to get better. This is what I mean by putting in time and effort.
---
One if my friends randomly got 2000 credits one time and bought like 4 characters. We still dont know why he got them.
---
Not my video, credit goes to The Rainbow Channel on YT
---
Now we are gonna have tactical nukes strapped to shields. Nice
---
I believe the original leak said you can use it on matches and windows.
---
But it would also destroy soft walls
---
Every OP should already be able to grapple up. They can outside on overhangs where they are resting on air so why not inside?   
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be OP as grappling is slow and loud. Yo I‚Äôd be able to hear it happening

I'm only level 123, I'm so excited!

Dear sir thank you for that long comment but most of the time I make the plays like C4s underneath floors, I guess I don't ever have enough intel about the enemy team. Perhaps I should play more intel ops or something. I truthfully know the maps inside out? Okay maybe most of the common spots. META yeap I know it but some for example on defense needs a team to cooperate - say play around a mira you need a bandit to usually keep that wall unbreachable etc etc. I think it's fair to say I know my stuff but either I lack intel or I lack the clutch factor too. So many things that are wrong with me I agree but I'm truthfully sad that usually team mates don't cooperate and it's making me quit this game.

i mean most people trying to playing siege probably have a 144hz too so you probably dont have a massive boost over them

Oh my... never thought of that. That would change the whole aspect of that hold. Interesting.

I mean they could make it so that you cant grapple outside, at any point of time.

Just a heads up, random means random. You can't learn random.

Seasonal skins  are a much better deal.

Thanks for the new game mode Ubisoft, but "guess how many times people will repost this" is kind of half assed...

besides windows. possible can go 3f kafe from 2f directly.

Was that in the trailer?

It shouldn't just be shield ops. It should operate like a tazer, stick it to anyone and it shocks them like they leaned up against a bandit wall until they die. It would be very great strat overall, but situational, just like melee's.

So it‚Äôs still fake correct? Gadget was just revealed officially. You still want to say it‚Äôs fake until it‚Äôs release or?

Yikes I just noticed I‚Äôm a retard

Right, lol. I'll live.

Oh, I completely understand you. I am from Europe and I play on EU servers, we can have 10 different people speaking 10 different languages.  A lot of the times I play with Germans, French, British, Italians, Spanish, sometimes Polish, Czech and Hungarians and I myself am Bulgarian, we usually speak English to each other, but a lot of the times there are Russians, Turks, Arabs and Persians, who don't speak English or don't want to speak English and they just babble in their native languages with no one understanding them. One way to avoid the language barrier is to find people speaking your language and playing with them, but this can be difficult.
---
I really don't know how. I don't know the answer.
---
there's a video of them on the rainbow 6 instagram
---
It will make Frost more viable for that window though
---
I have it. I love it!
---
Also many operators (in this case Mira) aren‚Äôt native english speaker so it could be on purpose
---
Do you want to delete your comment now or later? Gadget was just officially revealed, operator icon will be by the end of the week. All as I said. Who‚Äôs the idiot?
---
I‚Äôm gonna make a random guess and say that the grappling hook op will not have an AR. If she can propel through windows that are barricaded, that sounds horrific
---
Visor is a little to similar to Alibi. Also Port, what‚Äôs going stop teamates from using all 3 stims for themselves? Let‚Äôs say Port places the station somewhere near spawn, if I‚Äôm inside, I‚Äôll need to go all the way outside to get a stim?
---
Random kapkan traps is how I roll.. love that shit. I'll even board up a door way and smash it twice so someone runs up to it and doesn't check for traps, they just jump through. Works every time. Great on windows.
---
Also, using c4 under a wood floor is fun too. Just place it near a cam so you can see when someone is passing by. Works especially well when there are two or more together.
---
So my fake leak which was the official reveal just today came out. Still fake or?
---
Blessed killcam timing.
---
How would you get it off yourself during 1v1?
---
I did a test and made a new account, first game i got a message to go to the kitchen

It does, but sadly it comes with the territory. I just try to stay level and not bark back at em. Hoping to cultivate a better environment for myself. But it's so cool to see people be aware of this and so nice about it. Gives me hope

It honestly sucks because it makes people leave the game, anyone that does this need to learn some respect for people, it such a small thing but made into such a problem
---
Agreed, oh, they‚Äôre defending Drug Lab? Let‚Äôs take Kafe and break the floor, then have a few people enter from near bathroom. It just plays the same every single time.
---
Im going to do that now
---
This is for Dustin
---
I'm all for it. Sick of playing defense on offense.
---
Yup exactly. Rocket league is the best. You climb SO FAST when you're outperforming the opponent. Sure, there's some boosting, but because of the streak multiplier, the system is able to get you to your actual rank faster. It's at that point that the fun begins, because now you know you need to actively improve the little things about your game if you want to keep climbing. I shot right into gold, but spent then next 2 seasons getting good enough that I was able to reach high plat. Same exact experience with Overwatch. So it can definitely be done with Siege IMO.
---
God damn she got those deltoids from Pulling Bowstrings?
---
It does not,  and every patch with weapon changes I test about the same time. Every patch may I remind you. I don't go for long range engagements,  the scorpion does no damage at those ranges anyways. And I've actually provided evidence,  you've provided nothing to your own claims. It does not have a diamond, at least one that is balanced. Saying the vector has a large diamond is wrong. It has a very nice small one and is extremely easily controllable and doesnt require you to hinder yourself with burst fire.
---
Saying they're all designed for close range is true, but tell me how you're supposed to engage ar's that can fire 30 meters and have no damage penalty as well as an acog, and recoil diamonds. Something the scorpion doesn't have. Flanking isn't that good of an option as you'll still likely get outgunned, even at close range.
---
Ela in her current state is one of the worst defenders and that's a fact. Her kit asides her shotgun is pathetic more than anything else in the game,  combined with the fact that she has a random stat she's borderline useless.
---
Next provide actual evidence and proper claims to your arguments. I'm sick of proving you wrong.
---
Ah yes the best ranked operator
---
I don't know if she cant be that good if her teamates couldn't. She would turn into a super greedy fragger essentially.
---
Play recruit for atleast 50 ranked matches without getting kicked or tkd (and win)
---
i feel like that going to be used for more spawnpeek opportunities
---
You can get recruit if all of the ops you have are picked
---
I keep gender neutral gamertag for a reason. Although my profile pic is of a mandala Wolf so I think some people still peg me for that. If/when I talk on the mic people sometimes assume that I'm a squeaker üòÇ
---
have you tied it yourself?
---
from what I heard it's pretty difficult to really see what someone behind it is doing if you're not close to it. like you can tell someone is there but you can't really see who it is or track their movements or anything
---
Mira also made BB‚Äôs shield the absolute juggernaut that it was
---
*one grenade later*
---
#ONE FRIENDLY OPERATOR REMAINING
---
I‚Äôve got more batteries for the drill... repelling hostilities are in for a surprise.
---
This was already a thing but its still nice looking back when a nitro wouldnt destroy bbs shield
---
I don't play unless I have friends to play with anymore. None of my friends play siege, so it sucks. I usually do a few rounds of t-hunt, but I've lost so much of the feel of the game it's like starting over. Still my fave game of all time tho
---
Agreed
---
Saying that, for me, there are much more important factors that the siege team need to look at such as DDOSing
---
Whatever your opinion the point isn‚Äôt to nerf the shit out of shield ops, but to make it easier during 1v1‚Äôs. That was the point. Plus it would just be a cool feature
---
Ah, the in universe explanation for lag and bad hitreg
---
true I'm just afraid it's going to be too strong and there's going to be 3+ shields every match to get peeked from
---
we'll see
---
Both of these operators seem like they‚Äôll shake up the meta quite a bit. 
---
I do hope the Jerry can shield thing can‚Äôt just be shot to activate it. Seems like something that will be abused to hell by troll-y teammates and/or a nightmare of accidental teams waiting to happen.
---
bro, just bodyshot smh my head, its that easy
---
When are next ops on test server?
---
Im curious if the rappel line will send you through the window and through a close doorway. House window to doorway and Canal 2nd window to room under hatch are the two I am thinking of now. 
---
If that's the case, Kapkan might be able to get a DBNO.
---
I try not to either, but the one time I did the guy "accieentally" killed both of us with a nitro cell ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è idk why I play this fucking game sometimes
---
but then they wont make all that money a 2nd time... next you'll suggest having a tighter anti-cheat instead of waiting for the hackers to get 100 hours or so in before the ban to keep them coming back with new accts
---
Well I know how RussianBadger's next video will be titled :D
---
Meo tooo
---
He‚Äôs still good in detecting roamers and rushing
---
If only if he had breach charges
---
Ah, thank you kind stranger
---
Then both of her primary's? Yeah right.

thank you itouchedagirlonetime

Never said it wasn't
---
I like mutes animation as well, though my fav elite is probably frost.
---
I think he had a mild stroke...
---
Don't act like you're talking about artistic integrity or anything even close to it. You are talking about having hot female operators, nothing more, nothing less. You're mad that Gridlock wasn't hot, and you're worried the next female op won't be hot.
---
Crisp
---
Well I like Frost's backpack other than that, the animation is ok but eh
---
You should check this sub before you post. Normally, the ‚ÄúUbi banned me for nothing‚Äù really doesn‚Äôt fly here
---
Maestro, Kaid, Warden in that order for usefulness
---
Approved
---
That bow is longer than my achievements in life
---
I hope the Flame thing isn't only for shields... that would probably suck honestly
---
that's a guaranteed dome in the head though. Theres usually like two or more people watching that at the start of the round
---
What? I'm not upset at all lol. I'm just saying I dont think an attacker that has a gadget that provides literally nothing to her team is "greedy" and might not be very good.
---
Dont worry, you still got your renown and such. As soon as you see the notification on the right with  +700 +100 and such, you're good. It's like that on PS4 anyway. I'm sure it's like that on other platforms and PC.
---
How would they get the claw off?
---
Lmao I guess
---
This is beautiful I just got the hibana elite yesterday and I love it
---
I mean I did get some blocked comments in the text channels, but it was never consistent and I don't think they would constitute a perma ban.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
You just you don't think an op with that gadget would be greedy. I can't tell if your grammar got messed up or if you're actually mixing up your point.
---
I wish Cav had let Monty beat Jager to death for his incompetance
---
I doubt even that. It's probably designated rapple spots just like we already have (besides the addition of rappelling hatches)
---
doc is the better roamer
---
[siegestast.com](https://siegestast.com) taken :(
---
Depends on the gun and for the smg-11 I would say yes.
---
Unacceptable. This should be fixed asap.
---
I always get picks from that window that goes to the balcony that connects to master bathroom. I usually hit all the windows upstairs in office, and library just to throw people off so they can‚Äôt predict exactly where I‚Äôll be
---
Dude, your gonna get IQ quarantined again
---
Not really, I feel I win rounds much more often when I use well thought out strats and communicate it with my team than just simply going in and trying to cause chaos. Even when people go in run and gun, I find that they at least go after objective most of the time.
---
[http://siegestats.com](http://siegestats.com) taken :(
---
whats the background
---
You said yourself in other comments, you intentionally pushed the limit to see what Ubi would let you get away with. 
---
If you were to just play the game and avoid using words that could be taken so negatively, you wouldn‚Äôt be banned right now. I‚Äôm not sure how you can sit there and not see this is on you.
---
Your a bit late on this, it‚Äôs already been talked about like months ago
---
That Monty knew he wasnt of any danger to him
---
I'm going to take a guess and say its deployed the same way mira windows are, a little canister you shoot. It deploys fire, this was confirmed with the last leaks of them
---
I dont know
---
that got leaked 3 months ago already
---
Kaid needs a 3rd claw if they decide to do this.
---
Maybe he just needs a 3rd claw in general?
---
Its fire, not C4
---
lol. Sorry partner; Ubi is bad at banning
---
We where 3 all the game versus a team, there is boost and there was a mouse and keyboard (on ps4)  
---
Please Ubisoft, make ranked fairplay
---
then read the sub rules
---
Plat 1 is weird man, you get all these people that could probably get diamond but play too aggressively and will feed every round.
---
That‚Äôs honestly not even bad. You have a Gold I
---
I wonder what happens if you broke the canister
---
Meh, won't find a case of agreement out of me there. I'm partial to the fmg9. Just don't care for her gadget. It's pretty useless compared to anyone else's shit. AFAIK pros weighed in and said that a rifle was too much for her. I'm with SMGs. I'd prefer it to be the mp7 though. For the luls.
---
Most players are silver and gold.
---
Wait really how do I do that?
---
No u
---
that‚Äôs the joke
---
Yeah I feel yeah , but don‚Äôt let anger make you jump to conclusions. It happens on pc and even to the best (penny and pros). Stuff like this hopefully one day will be fixed
---
yes but the previous game i played, there was a diamond and a copper 2
---
What‚Äôs your ingame sens
---
Ever ocur to you maybe she wears he lab helmet in combat... HUH!!!
---
 Now that‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs bad
---
Also lighting is reflected differently making it very obvious
---
You got 2 kills.
---
Yea
---
yup she's lead in R&amp;D for team Rainbow
---
F
---
no
---
The operator‚Äôs Peruvian so he‚Äôll play a character from his country
---
I‚Äôm plat 2 on console playing 4 diamonds that are crouch spamming probably on MnK so yes I did get 2 kills you retard
---
Lawn mower mounted and mowing!
---
r/missedopportunities
---
Bonk!
---
Why would you roam with him? He‚Äôs a 1 speed
---
fat no from me chief
---
Ela had impacts
---
open task manages, close siege and reopen it

---
I‚Äôm in a weird limbo phase right now forsure. Though the fact that I don‚Äôt always beat overly aggressive players is definitely a fault of my own, I should be able to react quick enough every single time to shut down random wide peaks and run outs
---
Muhahaha
---
Didn‚Äôt bikinibodhi suggest this? I swear I watched a video back in grim sky where they mentioned what they thought his ability might do
---
I believe this is because the plats are plat in Europe and so the r6 tracker shows their highest rank overall. But when I comes to American servers where I assume you are playing on, their rank is lower (closer to the other teams).
---
Right in the..chead.
---
Shoot them. This post is basically saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of playing against people that kill me!!!!! ‚òπÔ∏è‚Äù also it‚Äôs pretty easy to tell when someone is about to run out
---
Hello UnicornMeat2, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cqgz4u/general_question_what_is_n√∏kks_headgear_called/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That's beautiful
---
Beautiful
---
Copper is the lowest
---
I'm well aware of the power of peekers advantage. And I'm also used to new weapons/gadgets coming out that people claim will be broken overpowered, but instead end up being pretty balanced. The new shield is way better than the current one for sure, it's a definite buff for those ops with that gadget. And with some practice I'm sure there are some dirty angles and plays you could pull off. However there will be plenty of times where the shield gets droned, that info is communicated, and one of the many many ops that can deal with deployable shields do so with no problem, and it's then useless. As with any effective defensive tool, it can be countered with information and correct gadget usage. We have had pixel angles and mira windows to deal with for a long time, I'm sure people will get accustomed to this new shield and learn to play around it or disable it.
---
We'll see in the reveal
---
Some maps I don‚Äôt even know how to attack so I have no strat for them. Outback is my worst map by far
---
Just don‚Äôt put any muzzle stuff on it and pop heads, I mean dude it‚Äôs a 9mm get used to it
---
Windows 10 has the snipping tool that you can use to take a rectangular snip screenshot of your game and r6 tracker.
---
Thats upside down, but it appears to be one of the new icons based on the full picture
---
This works btw, I was gonna suggest the same
---
Call ubi
---
Your oblivious if you don‚Äôt think there will bugs when the new operation releases. Seriously? Every single new operation has had bugs. So gtfo and quit being a douche to people who know this.
---
Lmg from fuze
---
Nah my bad i think that might actually be warden upside down
---
True except that a 9mm also does the 4th highest damage in the game
---
There's three golds versus 2 diamonds and others
---
Sure...
---
Outback is super defense sided, attacking it is just confusing and nonsensical tbh.
---
This has been promised but the most recent season has helped by adding the placement matching based on previous season, the concept of under lvl 50 ranked didn't really help as it just funnelled smurfs but that does have the advantage of keeping them out of other areas of the game
---
I never said there wouldn‚Äôt be any bugs, and I‚Äôm not being a douche either, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs better to not think about the negative shit before we even have a chance to see it.
---
Yeah that's def Warden upside down
---
Sometimes, you just have to keep words to yourself.
---
Super police LoL
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more man, nothing better than a good game with a solid community to back it up
---
Like toy story toys when no ones looking
---
How I look when my mom yells at me in the middle of a game
---
The more games you play in a season, the less points you get/lose per gane
---
The old throwing mechanics...
---
There are 2 things, first the game take time to get good at alot of the time when someone buys the gsme they don't lile how slow the game is which drives them to not play it. So if you are looking to play make sure you even like that play style, next is that there are tons of people who smurf in low levels so that will most likely be a problem in playing but after a while they will fade away
---
Ubi yyyyyy?
---
Catherine Zeta Jones, she dips beneath the lazers
---
Don't try it
---
This is literally the best thing
---
What do you mean exactly by slow?
---
when the hostage realizes he can just leave whenever
---
If you‚Äôre on Defense, DDoSing until the round is over means you win that round.
---
Here‚Äôs a comment I made explaining it 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cpfeja/elo_per_match/ewpfxs3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I second, also, happy cake day
---
there are copies of ac, the devision, r6, rayman and
---
Splitercell on the default site next to what looked like a Nintendo 64
---
I just realized, the ability is nearly useless on tower
---
We already have poor Nokk whose gadget is not only selfish but also pretty underwhelming.
---
However, I feel like if the new Attacker can really flank hard with her gadget, it might be enough to make her viable.
---
good joke
---
yeah so basically you‚Äôre taking about Cav
---
Use your drone 
---
The game will take time to get good at, people can only tell you so much. But a lot of getting better at this game comes from learning the maps, how they play, and common player tendencies and spots.
---
Thx didn‚Äôt even notice
---
 Unplayable
---
it‚Äôs not. read the sub rules before posting
---
I'm sorry. I just dont see. Your op and the new seem different to me. You cant claim that becuase they both have exploding tanks that they are the same. An explosive tank is a unique idea. Propane vs gas can. Being placed on a shield vs a wall. To me atleast, they look different and their names are nowhere near similar. I just don't see it.
---
Cant wait to see what new (or old) glitches will come with the new season.
---
I seen all Austin powers but borderlands was first thing that came to mind
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs my first one.
---
I don't get it, someone explain me please.(maybe i Don't understand because I'm from Argentina, so, please)
---
Man are you missing out. You need to go watch Austin powers ASAP
---
Then I would say it‚Äôs a little bad
---
Hager?
---
I have a question do you guys think the volcan is the whole shield or just the red explosive that can be attached to any ops deployable shield. Because the shield looks like the reworked deployable we were supposed to get a while ago
---
Probably copper 4 on your server and diamond on the other server
---
For example diamond in EU is the rank that would show up on r6tracker. But if he‚Äôs copper in US and playing US servers with you that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see in game
---
Changing a name and ctu doesnt change the fact that they are mechanically the same thing (excluding the location of placement)
