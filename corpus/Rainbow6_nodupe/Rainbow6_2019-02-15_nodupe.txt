That was like a week ago.

---
---
Fair enough 
---
Stingray obviously :P
---
PCMR has you covered with the wiki entry on builds: 
---

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds
---
Anyone else think "Pest" is gonna end up like a decoy grenade from CS:GO?
---
Her gun is top 5. Not the best. Pros use her because of her slither utility, stuns and the fact she's a 3 speed.
---
well, here's your proof ubi of why never to listen to any balance change feedback from this subreddit.
---
I actually would like ACOGs removed, I think they're a poor addition to the entire game since they're near mandatory.
---
Ash isn't overpowered like Lion or Old Blackbeard, but anyone, even pros, will tell you she's too easy of a pick.  
---
They literally said *in their fucking notes* that they are using this to test and see how drastically it affects pickrates and winrates, which is why they're not changing anyone else yet.  She's the most obvious and blatant choice for such an experiment.
---
The "omg 99%" does mean something because **the gun is literally picked 99 times out of 100,** and is an assault rifle over an assault rifle.  All the other operators you listed have primaries that serve different purposes.
---
Twitch's second primary is a DMR, the P90 has more bullets for spraying, the AR33/L85 is not actually a matter of best choice, since different people use different ones.  IQ also has an LMG that sees use, not just rifles.
---
Make his flash be like old timey camera flashes, where he has to remove and replace the bulb after each use.
---
No I think the guy is Gridlock
---
Buff the G36C pls?
---
Not really a fan of the pink, maybe it will look better in game
---
I wonder what curses they will spit out? 
---
Oof, you're wrong. 
---
You could also just shoot the guy to be sure
---
Time to go seal clubbing 
---
How does it feel to be wrong?
---
It’s not like Bandit got his acog taken first, then jager. It was simultaneously done. And there were legit so many people who mained jager/bandit and ash. So it’s not really unfortunate for one single person 
---
Yuppp. She will require slightly more skill but I feel just like dropshotting and crouch lean spam more bad than good will come from it 
---
On defense, it’s easily Frost. With a RPM of 575 and a max damage of 45, opponents can LITERALLY weave in-and-out between bullet fire. Add the fact that the C1 fires marshmallows, it’s pretty bad.
---
On offense, it’s statistically Blackbeard’s Mk17 CQB believe it or not. With only a max damage of 49 (it was recently buffed and only did 42!) and a RPM of 585, this gun was so bad that it was universally agreed upon in pro-league and in high-level play for a while that the DMR, SR-25, was the superior weapon! If it wasn’t for the face shield (totally broken gameplay mechanic), people would quickly realize how bad it really is.
---
Some are decent. Others not so much
---
Or just remove the icon above it so you have to remember where you threw it. 
---
Emp out 
---
Glad to see someone else doesn’t like this nerf. 
---
Did you just ... hold on a minute and let me get this straight. YOU JUST RUBBER-BANDED INTO YOUR OWN EXPLODING BREACH CHARGE.....that’s got to be a first right ?????  
---
Yeah i see ur point, its just that i dont think that this will happen and so i move on.. siege is no fun anymore
---
(-)7 glad we're here for you
---
Rook
---
So Gridlock is another trap operator...but I can’t wait to find out more about Mozzie!
---
F
---
I didn't even use the ACOG on the R4-C. Always holo sight.
---
the icons give me kind of a Motorstorm vibe.
---
When you have no head logic don’t apply 
---
ahh yes the edit 2 makes sense, thx for pointing that out.
---
dont think itll do much to her, but the walking into a jammer to turn it off is a god-bless
---
Well I'm silver and wb is my first season, I accept defeat.
---
They should make it so when Fuze downs the hostage, it takes away 666 points and says something. Lol.
---
You mean man transitioning to a chick lmao
---
Well Aussie was confirmed... I hope they add MX for real
---
I mean not to knock you but capitao is a joke, iq guns are good but not god teir, although i love the aug. Hibanas gun is good but its tiny magazine size and slower fire rate make it worse then it could be. All the three speeda guns have problems, except for ashs r4c. The changes you suggested were eithef a change to ash, or just a direct buff to the g36
---
yup basically
---
YET THERE ARE NO MIDDLE EAST SERVERS
---
YoU DiDnT gIvE CReDiT
---
No wonder I get matchmaking errors...
---
i thought gridlock was the dude with aviators and a helmet
---
Yeah the damage over time isn't really what makes Lesion good. And it's not like it's gone, you still have to worry about it, just not as much. 
---
I think they need to make it so you can't run into a mine with low health and just instantly get downed. It's really frustrating since their is little you can do about it. They could remove the initial damage of the mine, or take a play out of minecrafts book and make it so the poison damage cannot completely kill/down you. Both of these changes would barely effect him, since his the damage aspect of his traps is probably his least powerful asset, but just make him slightly less frustrating. 
---
Ok that is true but the pick rate doesnt make it the ONLY available gun lmao. 
---
 I don’t know really annoyed me and a buddy he and a friend of his team killed one of us per round if it was coming to the end of a round and ee were looking to win they would not go to site and hide or run outside and let them kill him, just annoys me that people don’t think of others 
---
Nah, new trailer confirms it’s the opposite.
---
Let me guess, you're not a fan because of the Acog, correct?
---
Mozzie is gonna be my main after the team killing from the new season dies down
---
*Trans woman
---
Nope. You'd probably see it a lot more over the 556 or just as much imo. 
---
#THATCHER HEAVY BREATHING
---
im assuming you all are sending through uplay and not steam, right?
---
No. They posted the video. Mozzie is the guy.
---
If they were smart, they would play rounds and then cast the replays, with the replay action cut such that all the highlights of the round are seen, and then the commentators watch that replay and commentate it as if it's live.
---
5 minutes of tape delay for a significantly better spectator experience.
---
I've been mentioning a greater AoE buff for the longest time.
---
(Along with the M249 receiving the same destructive capabilities as it has in THunt)
---
Quality scale, not a ruler... not anything with a consistent length.  NO A BANANA 
---
Yeah, we always do it through uplay
---
Lord
---
I think they main that Dokkabie can not send out the call when on a Mute jammer.
---
I'm also having this issue. Came to see if I was alone. 
---
My teammate manages to do that to our team at least once a day. 
---
Yeah, but banana.
---
Yes but that's going to change her also kaid is better 
---
gridlock's the one with the helmet
---
Is it just me or is Capitao still really dangerous and his fire bolts still really strong
---
But they ARE Ubisoft. RedLynx is their team name.
---
I've been playing on PS4 since launch and the worst thing I've ever seen is some team kills for no reason, not to mention people like my self use a high sensitivity on console and idiots think that high sensitivity and a good reaction time=M&amp;K
---
Nice.
---
No man, Gridlock is the female attacker and Mozzie is the male defender. I made the same mistake. So did 90% of this sub lol turns out the roles are swapped 
---
Would be nice
---
Nah, you're right. Just look at the invitational, Capitao is picked quite often for exactly what you said - killing or driving out operators behind cover and shields, plus smoke planting.
---
There are very little if no hackers on console
---
Oh for sureee! People somehow prefer the P90 and I hate all of those people lol
---
Y
---
Welcome to Six Siege enjoy your stay :)
---
Are you a new player? 
---
Good for firing two shots and breaking your back because of the recoil
---
Abandon don't count as a "loss" although he still loses MMR, it doesn't show on his W.L. ratio
---
It makes sense that buff op operators in the past because no used them (finka) so it would work here to but everyone’s whose not a beta(like your self) needs to be on board
---
thank you, someone understands. More versatility, can take more shots, and a beast of an AR. Zofia is an absolute unit, she Pop the barricade into OBJ, pop some concussions, and absolutely destroy anyone inside.
---
Debris is client side, all of it. There is no sync.
---
r/unexpecteddespicableme
---
Yes that was my first game
---
I play casual and face this 
---
What a warm welcome
---
Have you played console my guy?
---
Yep
---
Because people would get mad at the advertizing.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aqmnif/ubisoft_please_listen/?st=JS5DA4NN&amp;sh=38e54824) you go
---
Was in a game with a four member clan. All they did was tk me. I then killed them and got 30 min ban. It was justified imo
---
Instantly checked. None for me sadly
---
The recoil doesn't really match the RPM at all. 860 rounds per minute. Ela's gun is 220 RPM higher and it bounces like a beach ball in a tunnel. If the difference is that small, the recoil should be somewhat similar.
---
I know they can't be exactly the same due to how the weapons were designed and all that. Just gonna drop that there before I get roasted by a gun enthusiast. 
---
Same thing happened to me but I guess cause I was coming 1st when I was only level 4 must of triggered them
---
By effort you mean praying to the Rng Gods
---
Played since release on ps4, there are no hackers
---
Everyone laughed at me when I said Mozzie was the male defender.
---
[Some one pick up that phone because i called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aqfysf/australian_ends_the_whos_who_debate_with_the_new/)
---
Yeah fair enough 
---
Maybe change it later on and see how far people notice 
---
Break my back out lol she’s a keeper 
---
Yea. Normally I do a satanic ritual.
---
No and no. 
---
And angled grip for faster ADS
---
People only prefer it due to its fire rate, it can be a headshot beast. However, in my expierence, the MP5 is a more consistent gun, with a low TTK, and a very good recoil, it’s the perfect gun for headshots and body shots.
---
Little is accurate I bet
---
Did you just call the scar and para worse than the G36? 
---
Welcome to siege. Expect a lot of harassment considering this is a free weekend and when people see low levels you may get messed with, team killed, or kicked.  
---
Yeah I hope they do
---
This is cool but it looks like its really hard to see where the edge of the fire is.
---
You just need better gaming socks. 
---
Ah. Like this?
---
\[–]/  \[T]/
---
And I’m not sure what the tachanka turret one is. The 7 is a bent arm saluting. 
---
How about no
---
Yeah, imagine capturing a drone in prep phase and having it the entire round? That would be fucking insane. They can be destroyed by attackers obviously but man that would be so powerful. 
---
Another interesting dynamic to consider: would destroying the pest that hacked the drone “un-hack” the drone? Would it destroy it? Or would it just make it so it can’t hack any more drones? Can multiple drones be hacked at once? There are so many possible wrinkles to this gadget. I can’t wait to see the details 
---
i clapped my hands at the loud memes
---
I've literally seen people track me through walls and a guy even messaged me bragging about his hacks. His account got deleted though.
---
Yeah I’d say I have about the same kind of experience with my the MP5. Someone told me to use the shotgun I immediately left the game.
---
Wtf
---
I think attackers should keep their acogs because the defenders have a natural advantage in that the attackers have to come to them.  I think the R4c is just an isolated incident because of ash.
---
Twitch
---
How about you give me the money and I'll buy it for you ;D it will be a huge surprise
---
It will be a day of gaiety and rejoicing across the lands bröther
---
Not really until this point 
---
They need to hire Twitch...she would've managed those cables pretty well
---
[removed]
---
So...when's the wedding?
---
No, you're simply wrong it's just way to much effort to hack ps4, it rarely happens at all period.
---
And what level are you?
---
I mean the shotgun’s great, if you’re playing recruit. Other than that, you can utterly massacre a team with the MP5, the thing is an absolute unit. Running Doc and roaming with it can utterly ruin a. Team’s day. Spawnpeek, get a couple frags, set yourself up for a rotation, and boom, easy 3k-5k
---
Mozzie guy, think of him as an annoying buzzy mosquito. Gridlock is the attacker (woman) she so thicc she make a gridlock/blockade
---
This reminds me of cs:go coctel molotov some how. Btw, what happened to kap's BLUE smokes? Huh?
---
You’re asking how good the operators that we’ve only seen promotional content for are going to be?   
---
We haven’t even seen substantial gameplay yet.
---
Thatcher. The best elite ever
---
Mhm this is exactly why I love doc to death. He’s great, useful ability no matter the circumstances, and great guns
---
hmmmmmmmmmm  sending you my credit card number now what could go wrong
---
Sorry what
---
They just edit the fire ones
---
Ash Jager mains won’t be too happy about this one...
---
I really wanted to spare him but in the end I’ll take what I can get
---
No and no. Final answers, been tested all over youtube
---
It's really not that hard nowadays. And I think that you are underestimating just how desperate people can be in order to get an advantage. And as for my level, I don't think it really matters, but I've been playing at high gold-low plat for the last season.
---
Been asking for ash to lose her acog for a while now.   She’s keeping her G36 acog, which is great, but her “run and gun rush” mentality needed a slap (nerf) imo.
---
Since Jäger is hunter in German, I’ll say Jäger just became a female.
---
so how is mozzie not just worse echo?
---
I am a gun enthusiast and while realism may affect some people’s perception, I believe balance should always take precedence over realism in game play. Elas gun was insanely OP on launch, and it’s still a really solid choice. The reason it’s recoil is so bouncy is because of the combination of firerate and ammo capacity. Those 2 alone make a weapon a very strong option in a one shot headshot game. It’s the same with the P90. Nobody screams for a nerf on it because it has solid recoil, but in reality it’s a very strong option. Ash’s R4C is strong, but not necessarily OP. I completely agree that in the right hands it absolutely shreds but it’s not an RNG machine and thus I feel that it doesn’t lower the skill gap. 
---
I hate how people complain so much about Blitz. Bringing Blitz is kind of like bringing a shotgun; is really useful and effective in some situations, while it kind of useless in others. The fact is, people are going to whine about Blitz unless he gets nerfed so hard that he is unusable. 
---
Also, a lot of the "shoot through" occurrences are this bug when you turn a certain way, but to other people you turn the opposite way and they can see and shoot you in the side. It fixes itself whenever you move, so move around a little while making big turns with a sheild. 
---
Idk, I've literally never seen anyone hack any ps4 game period.
---
As for me asking rank, I just wanted to make sure you weren't a copper who didn't know lion was a thing.
---
I know. But i have been waiting for his blue smokes to come back since op health when they changed it and said would bring it back. I just want my blue smokes back :(
---
Face reveal pretty wack.
---
Every one down voted me when I called this. but I was right!
---
I just wanna play Kahoot. I don't want riddles from old man Kaid. Leave Blitz alone for once...
---
probably just downloading
---
But typically you don't put a shield in the middle of the room. It's next to or has its back against a wall, meaning you can hit the wall to get at the person.
---
SUFFER
---
That's not gonna burn down.
---
When did thermite have frags? And why would you bring frags instead of a claymore?
---
Its the jebait that keeps on jebaiting
---
Patience is vital in this game, remember that and you will improve.
---
i think that is supposedto help sheild since sometimes you can't pick it out in the middle of a room and end loosing half of your life
---
This is a part of the Stickied post on the front page of the sub, No need to repost it for the 1000th time.
---
God damnit not the *C O G*
---
Thats your problem
---
That’s very little hp for it, as blitz is made to tank a lot more
---
i already suffer in copper 4
---
I literally just finished making a post about this as well. I just finished waiting 45 minuets for a ranked match. WHY???? 
---
That's a thing?
---
OHHHHHH took me a while to see it
---
i think shotgun has been patched in 4.3.2, they fixed the fact that recoil was worse on console than pc
---
still going
---
\*1:37 wait time
---
since the position on the balancing graph i think twitch g2 will be the next to be nerfed probably
---
Yea I've been grinding casual to learn the maps I'm barely at 100 hours in PvP I have definitely seen improvement in my playing versus when I first started. It's an addicting game. I used to play Rocket league. I've got 4k hours in that game. 
---
It's a website that's used in schools, basically it's a timed quiz thing where all the students log into the game on their phones or laptops with a code the teachers give them. The teachers version of the quiz is shown on the smart board or a projector, and it asks a question and the students have to answer it as fast as possible. If you get it right, you get points, and the faster you answer the more points you get. If you get it wrong, you don't get any points. A leaderboard is shown after every question and it's basically a fun competition between students.
---
I’m a Mira main but I pick her
---
She’s speedy, has a fantastic gun, and acog is a great sight. They can’t really slow her down, or nerf her gun TOO hard, so they took away acog. 
---
Of course, but we need to seriously think about copying Abortnite as this child friendly game is hugely popular, and could make UBI not bad.
---
The zoom makes longer range engagements easier. She isn't even completely losing the Acog, She will still have it for the G36, but the R4-C has a 99% pick rate over the G36. This move was to make the nerf the R4-C slightly while making the G36 more viable. Plus Ash already has by far the highest pickrate of any op in the game, So something needs to be done to balance it.
---
Get that toxicity to a lower level lets go boys
---
Play CSGO for a bit. You won't be using Q or E very much so that might help tone downtown he tendency a bit. I used to do this a lot as well.
---
Lol you don't understand anything
---
those names dont seem right not gonna lie
---
John Wick needs your help!
---
repost number 7384
---
change your region
---
Thank you for posting shit from literally launch day of the game.
---
Can't get anxious in ranked. If you don't play ranked. 
---
*Taps forehead* 
---
Had to repurchase ultimate, good luck on defending this practice, its not sustainable and will earn ubi the reputation of ea as its becoming more common. 
---
If people trash talk trash them back who cares its ranks. Repeat this until you get confident enough works for me
---
Why not just make it so shields cant ads? Its already an auto death unless the enemy isnt paying attention or theyre flashed. Fucking el oh el. Ubisoft cant even make shields work properly, and now theyre nerfing them even more...
---
Yeah I know, they could buff the g36 also so there was actually a reason to use it instead of making an attackers gun have significantly reduced effective range
---
Ah rainbow my old friend 
---
siege-nite Battle royale? Holy shit call up fucking trump i think we are on to something. We also need to copy abortnite in the sense that the game is fun until the game gets stale and is eventually milked for 5 seasons too long and then made into a meme
---
That might work thanks
---
As a former av tech I'm just gonna leave a big resounding sigh right here
---
Its just in the r4c
---
What rank?
---
The real problem is the rank dood
---
Nice save
---
That me lmao
---
what is mozzie gonna do
---
then perish
---
It would only take my internet an hour or 2, but what I'm getting at is lagging makes the game 0 fun no matter which way you try to spin it. You need a really strong internet connection.
---
Thanks.
---
Ya he mentions them a bunch, and I believe did an in-depth video on the riots
---
The reality of Siege is that its very punishing to beginners, there's so many operators and gadgets and different things to think about. But just persevere. Once you get better, and start consistently going positive with your kills and deaths you will feel so proud of how far you've come. 
---
I've been playing for 6-7 months now and I'm actually proud of how I've improved. I was never into fps games like COD. I just didn't get on with them. I've gobbled up siege and played like mad. Just put some time in and enjoy it. Don't worry about your rank. Most platinums I've been paired with have sucked. I'm in gold 4 just now. 
---
no the reason is that ash is over picked and has a positive win rate, that is the first reason of the nerf, they probably will nerf echo if his pick rate was higher 
---
I do believe they took it down because they had the attacker and defender mixed up if I’m not wrong
---
So fuck literally every other game mode besides bomb? Got it.
---
I get its the esports mode, but not everybody fucking likes bomb.
---
Cause bfv is trash and unfinished
---
Wdym its pikachu in the middle off set to the right. Look at it in game for it to be more clear. U can see his outline and tail easy
---
echo was trying to save you
---
 no the reason is that ash is over picked and has a positive win rate and the see the fault in the r4c be to strong
---
She doesn't just have the insane pickrate, she also has a way above average winrate too. She's not just a swiss army knife, she is a really damn good swiss army knife that can handle a lot of situations.
---
IM A NETWORK ENGINEER AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.

But he says he knows he needs to kill people to heal people... Hmm... Maybe he got hit on the head too hard when that impact grenade went off.
---
Yeh exactly, I play plat, I've seen obvious legit mouse and keyboard less then ten times in my 800 hours,
---
Not as THICC as Doc's forearms. That shit D U M M Y   T H I C C
---
the fuck did i just read
---
May I ask how many times he gets good fire arrow plays in pro league because I know from ranked his gadget efficacy is piss poor from what I’ve experienced 
---
Honestly though that's still not off the table. I think making him a thicc boi could be a solid choice depending on how his gadget is altered. If they go for a "lion roaring" effect emanating from his body, 3 armor would be the first thing I would try.
---
Alright, you've convinced me
---
What's this from?
---
On attack it’s gotta be Nomad’s AK. The DPS is trash and it has pretty rough recoil. The only redeeming factor is the 40 round mag. On defense it’s Kaid’s AUG A3. So essentially the two newest ops have the two worst automatic primaries in the game haha 
---
Finka boosts can have negative effects. 
---
More damage from gas is done because you breathe faster. 
---
Pulse can see your heartbeat from further away while boosted too 
---
Didn't we already see how terrible Ela can be?
---
Lol get fucked ash
---
Decrease the speed in which his dime can be shot thus making him have to hold angles
---
Very true my guy, locals usually know the venue in and out and that knowledge is paramount to get good speaker placement, angles for cameras, and lighting. Also they step up when you need them to do other stuff like once I had a local guy carry a boom mic behind me while I was camera cuz our sound guy fell on some ice and dislocated his shoulder. We were filming to beef up our guys promo video (cuz his first one was shit) so we wanted good shots from the crowd with audio of the crowd too to really get that feeling but we tried this the night before and our mic guy and I kept getting separated because the crowd would just suck to move through and if they were moving around a lot had a habit of moving in waves so I’d catch a break and move but he’d get closed off. So this local’s idea was to literally get a dusty rope from the back and tie us together with like the rope around our waists and like only a foot of slack between us and as ridiculous as it sounds it worked perfectly. I will forever be grateful to that man because we got great footage and sound that night and he got a good tip and I got a promotion.
---
Just click on their head. 4Head
---
\&gt;:(
---
When it gets over 4 mins I back out and try again it always works. I think sometimes the servers lose your request for a game so it’s not actually searching for it. This is purely a guess btw for I have no idea how this stuff works
---
now that i know this, im now expecting mozzie in trials XD
---
In the invitational he'll generally flush a defender out of the standard holds or get a kill if they don't move in time unless he's killed beforehand. And if the hold was empty you know it, even if you can't drone it efficiently (like Oregon T3 tower).
---
Shout out to the Frost main. Thank you for being my valentin💕
---
If you mention ash in any way shape or form you get downvoted into oblivion 
---

Boi I'm shook, I used to be able to get up there but took a break from siege and forgot. I feel like a dumbass for not attempting to get up from the side and not the front. 
---
You can hear the twitch mains crying already. Mira approves
---
I always take breach charges on Multiplayer and always get pissed off with how slow the animation is, By the time it's deployed with how slow it currently is you're usually dead if they hear you and shoot through a barricade or wall even on terrorist hunt and you can't stop setting the breach charge up, I can't wait for the faster animation it will be less problems for me.
---
Ahhhhhh ok. My bad dude, good luck with your karma
---
Haha 
---
haha
---
M249 is eugh.. god awful, Para on the other hand is not an amazing Assault Rifle (I like to call it the UMP 45 of Attack), but it feels pretty good to fire, just feels like a cannon on your shoulders (it is a full auto FN FAL after all), but I love Capitao, ok guns but amazing utility.
---
Interesting so his prop play is more promising 
---
I'm plat as well and have maybe seen it 2 times.
---
I'm a cloud 9 fan but since they didn't make it I'm going for E.G. but I just enjoy the gameplay
---
How do you see an overview like that?
---
888888888888888888888888
---
Why wouldn't you make the guy that rides in on a motorcycle an attacker? It would be so cool, like how you can see lion's drone outside if you play him if you would play mozzie you would see his motorcycle parked outside 
---
Now I can say I learned something today.
---
Rigging giving you guys a wave from the beams. 
---
eh I guess seems super easy to just call out though since presumably its ganna happen before round even starts most of the time

Is this happening?

Yes

Doesn't need one.

She was so underpowered recently, which is why she for a buff. She's fine now.
---
Countering her is a piece of cake. She can barely do anything when shielded. Just stand there, and not even remotely menacingly.

That sounds better lol

What about hibana elite

How about forgetting about the soda can you left in the freezer,and then having it go off at 3 in the morning?lol
---
Doesn't it have bad fire rate and low damage?  
---
Still potato server
---
We can fix this, just give Ash the ability to use the FBI shotgun.
---
/s
---
Now that I think about it, each charge would have to last way shorter. 20 seconds max. I feel like dokkaebi would still be solid though because with her you can actually see the cameras. With this idea you wouldn’t. Of course there would have to be some downsides to it. Maybe 2 active at max. If any are shot after they won’t work period.
---
If someone fell through the map, it could be that.
---
Not interested in elites. Can't see them, won't use then.
---
to be fair there are explosives out there that are designed to do more damage one way. they are usually used in demolition jobs. idk how it works but it works.

While on the topic why are their so many women in this game? I understand it's a videogame, demographic, PC, and all that. It seems pretty obvious that there's very few women in these units, and even fewer at the top of them. 
---
This might come across as sexist, but it's just something that's generally interested me.

I wanna say FNATIC.

Oh ok makes sense.

Ah a man that has more brain cells than me.

Well...

Yea i get you

u/maplesyrup223 Jake lost all his mains lmao
---
Yeah ik, and thus shouldn't be an issue for me since I'm already trying to use sights other than the ACOG, since they're easier in CQB

2 weeks after the invitational which is on the 17th so it should be out by March 3rd i believe

Wtf man, do you just hate fun?

Alright just making sure u know

Oh god. Looks like im not getting any sleep tonight with that thought

Goddamnit, they know my secret...
---

Facts😂
---
They should make his flip sight red like before with an inner circle like ti is now, so he can still see through smoke but has to know where to look more, and a damage curve change with a bit more at range.
---
Also the true detention of potato spelling lol
---
Looks like a Serbu Super-Shorty. They're typically built off Remington 870s, Mossberg 500s and Maverick 88s.
---
I prefer gun skins and charms. Gun skins make the gun looks stupidly crazy and charms are nice and cute (especially chibis and that new doc's humanity charm), and have some meaning, and I can see all of them. Uniforms? The best i can see is doc's blue gloves and bench pressing fore arms, but that's it.
---
Jäger's elite is cool, though. As someone who loves Jäger, if i ever am interested in making my boi look good, I might consider it. But not anytime soon.
---
No hitbox? You don't get an acog. Simple as that
---
This was posted by the US too
---
Fuck i just realised all the mistakes i amde with frammar im removing, fixing and reuploading it thx forbpointing it out
---
Jezus i cant even comment correctly
---
Absolute waste lol
---
God. Yes.
---
OP missed his spray. 
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because OP was already dead.
---
Them doc for arms are huge man
---
i had to start using the looking for group post on xbox for this same reason
---
I think u forgot the /s 
---
Then you don’t know how to play competitively. Having a main is everything. For examples you’ll see pros play different ops but in comp when it matters they’ll play their main operators that they are best with on certain maps.
---
I can play everybody. I’m good with anybody. But in ranked when grinding for that diamond I play thermite on attack and alternate between jager, mira, bandit, lesion, and Valkyrie cuz I excel with those ops on different maps and objective sites.
---
So no I disagree with you opinion of having a main isn’t a good thing. 
---
Give our lord and savior a acog removes ash’s 
---
Too bloody right mate, you bring it out on a tray of ice at chrissie lunch.  And there is always one or two hanging about by the time the ice melts, stinking up the place and driving the dogs mad.
---
Tough love
---
Yeah I’ll be disappointed if they don’t say cunt
---
Looks like Mira took ash’s no headshot hit box gimmick.
---
That trailer was clearly showing him denying area. Specifically, the area right underneath Tachanka. Duh.
---
Yeah, but now that Ash is losing her ACOG, we can slow things down.
---
I mean if you are defending that site and they have enough time to get up there to hammer it then you might have bigger problems...
---
IQ but i think Gridlock might beat her 
---
But which one sounds more fun?
---
You can but they still have these in the store. Also if you do it from the app, it only shows it to ur friends, but if you buy them, people in game can see it.
---
im guessin youve never been ddossed or tk'ed twice a day everyday. tbh if you don't really care about it you hardly notice it

I love how he just disapears after.

Im sorry that the nerf will end quick ads kills

Kaid without a doubtthe .44 mag kicks ass (regardleaa of nerf or not) pluss his Shotgun makes Vigil's BOSG look like a water gun it's extremely useful against tiny targets like Ash, Ela, and IQ i've been maining him since Lion got nerfed

Her guns hella good tho but viable with holo

Yeah no I don't know what it's called on border but it's that small was room

Nice thx

The fact they're recycling makes them even funnier imo.

I see fucking memes all the time here on the front reddit so im confused. 
---
Prefiring a Mira window in the process of it falling has this weird bug where the prefire will maintain the existence of the window even if it visually dropped. I notice that if you pause the prefire for a moment it will then allow you to shoot through it. 
---
&gt; So will that be used more now?
---
Well it's usage is currently 1% so it's safe to speculate it will likely see increased use.
---
Yea but shes more under the radar
---
There is an unpredicted side effect of the ACOG removal for Ash.
---
One of the good thing of an ACOG is that it has a broad scoped in view, but with ACOG being removed for Ash, she's gonna have to use the other narrowed sight along with the muzzle flesh. I believe compensator is the most widely used muzzle attachment for R4C, but the muzzle flesh is so strong on the R4C if you use non ACOG.
---
Smoke is one of the strongest ops in the game when used correctly...
---
Wait really?
---
It would be fun if you dropped a piece of metal in the center of the coil
---
I didn't, until you pointed ouyt out!  Thanks bro. Now I only see a shrimp. 🍤
---
KAREN TOOK THE FUCKING ACOG (it’s funny how one of the devs is called Karen or Karan I think)
---
I spent some time in the ADF, and met a few SASR guys, and they all just seemed operator as fuck. These two just feel like a joke, but again maybe that's how the other operators come across to their nations
---
Ahhh didnt know console could do that but i mean cmon... Just a skin.. It doesnt affect the game very much. 
---
Not really.  When I started Kanal was my favorite map and I always wanted to defend Maps room.  Then I learned how much better boats and servers were and I was like, why did I ever think that.
---
You must be new here
---
also coach from scary movie 
---
Back when it was only the original OG operators and you had to unlock them and all the attachments with renown 
---
No enjoy it while you can
---
It's just on R4C... If u want acog, u can use her G36C
---
THAT IS A CRIME! WE NEED OUR BASE OPS ELITE FIRST ;(
---
I think the majority of what they did is for the better specially placing them faster.
---
The only change that I don't agree with is reducing the lethal range on the defenders side as it was a small area anyway.
---
Now these changes not being "needed" is true but this entire gadget isn't "needed" either as it's generally better to take any other gadget at pretty much any level.
---
These changes are purely to make the gadget slightly more viable and even then it will only really have any effect on lower level/effort teams.
---
These changes won't convince anyone to take it that wasn't even considering it before. 
---
They were removing deployable shields right? 
---
Unless the cav somehow misses every single shot
---
Beginning of white noise 
---
Good? His gadget otherwise would blow if it can't actually flush someone out. 
---
Minor suggestion: Mirror second panel so it looks more like running 'towards' the lower half, rather than away. 
---
Does it relate to me too? :(
---
We... we don't talk about that. Alright? You don't mention that, i wont mention the hostages. 
---
Sometimes you get excited... aaand mistakes are made. 
---
it may look like a mess, but if the crew is up to snuff, all those are clearly labeled and laid down in a specific order for easy of teardown

Flash bangs are already janky enough

What hostages? I think you meant

#ACCEPTABLE CASUALTIES 
---
The title says it all
---
Tbh i think the issue is that the map pool in siege varies from super close range to medium range and long range,  the operators and the loadouts are static but the environment can be so different. Theres such a range that an operator may be balanced on one map but disgusting on another.
---
If siege had a intended engagement distance i dont know if it would be boring or beneficial to the game as one side it would be harder to keep fresh but also easier to balance and know you have a fair fight.
---
I think one drastic change that might happen is for a 1.5x sight for assult rifles, acog gone for dmrs only.
---
Oooo a piston
---
Ubi:
---
We have no plans to add anymore shields to the game...adds Clash.
---
We are working on a major rework of Mute....gives SMG11
---
We will never nerf Ash since she is perfect for new players.....removes Acog

I downvoted at the Lord part because Lord Tachanka is fucking stupid

I thought Gridlock was the guy?  This seems kinda fake at first glance, not gonna lie. Sorry if I sound like an ass but that's just my opinion.

Yeah probably

i started about 4 months ago. i was busy with school and some other games so i only got about 200 hours up my count.

i hope youre joking

What a happy little chonk 
---
Everyone that wasn't silver.
---
That’s about it. And even then, it’s not hard to hear a breaching charge being placed
---
Are you saying you aren't supposed to buy any new operator that you don't know because it's not good for the team if you play it on casual? Are new players supposed to start because the mean might not win a casual match? 
---

You have to be crazy or psychic to predict an attacker losing their ACOG.
---
Thats dumb to say
---
Shouldn't his shield get knocked down?
---
Yup.
---
I mean, that season was pretty clearly season 0.
---
crew 2 copied ww2 games because it has planes and boats
---
But u did it with ash.
---
It only impacts me cause my poor eye sight and my brain cannot process little things especially from far xD
---
But i am up to nerfing Ash but not in this way. Ash mains that play her for the gun, like the gun cause its strong, not cause it has an ACOG. Removing the ACOG wont do shit. Giving it more recoil so it wont be effective as it is rn from longer range would do the job, or at least for now and maybe later ubi can add more things if it's not enough. A gun like this shouldn't be soooo good at range, and if it will have the recoil nerfed then the ACOG wont be a problem too sense a lot of people will probably play less ACOG

---
fartnite
---
Not an ash main whatsoever. Usually pick Hibana or Twitch, but ever time I used ash, she was fire. Even the sound of the R4 is great. 
---
The attackers would probably have to go through or in the area of Mozzie’s gadget. Not every attacker will fall for this and countermeasures may be found very quickly. Also, Mozzie will receive a limited number these and they will probably be placed around the OBJ due to Mozzie probably being a 3 armour 1 speed.
---
Therefore, Vigil will still be viable as a roamer.
---
He's hiding his third bomb

This will only in courage rushing

eventually his gadget will need to recharge. as the OP said, Vigil is underpicked. it cant be because of his guns because they are good. so buff his gadget.

look @ ubi's twitter

You get that high from rushing obj and getting a 4k. Nothin like it
---
nooooo glaz 
---
That might be it
---
I'd say there's a higher chance as you're probably on a watchlist. I got my account locked for 7 days after buying and haven't tried buying any new r6 credits ever since (I had all ops anyway and getting renown is super easy for me so it isn't a big problem getting new ops). I'd recommend not buying after first account lock/ban though

Some dude in the linked sub reddit said He knows someone at ubi and He said a Hot fix is on the way.. But idk how reliable This Information is. 
---
ikr cant even lean😂😂 what a joke of a game
---
i'm just gonna use the G36... honestly it's a decent gun and i value accuracy (and ACOG's) way higher than pure DPS. I rarely play ash anyways. I don't have a main but Twitch would be a first canidate and droning a path to the OBJ, clearing all traps etc., and then rushing in and let the Famas do the rest, works better for me than just running inside with my head cut off. I'm not a bad player (Plat 2) but i can't ash rush. My playstyle doesn't support it.
---
I agree with ubi. Bye ash acog
---
They just copied siegeg
---
He says why in his pinned comment which he made 14 hours ago
---
Started playing around Start of Black ice till mid dust line skipped skull rain and been playing ever since with around 100+ hours on my favorite operator (Not Ela)
---
Don't really have a main, but i love you too
---
Another transgender operator
---
Why was this removed? The accounts that had it loose their base ops?
---
yeah but it's still very very good for 110 packs
---
Unrealistic
---
It's iffy it's slow rate of fire along with damage output makes it the slowest time to kill so all for headshots
---
What is a SO?
---
Tiggy is real shit
---
&gt;Why was this removed?
---
Maybe because they thought the new system is better than just having a Starter Edition, not sure.

---
You shouldn't lose any unlocks, no.

*Peeks out in mute*

Go away this is my house

Making them super visible to everyone running around defeats their purpose and screws up where they fit on the scale of traps...
---
Lesion - Invisible, weak.  
---
Kapkan - Small but still visible, decent damage.  
---
Frost - Large and very visible, incapacitates.
---
Also, just use your drones to spot them. Counter with a Twitch to take them out. Thatcher to zap em, grenades or Fuze to blow them up. There are options for dealing with them.

The reason this is $9.99 is cuz is not the original chibi statue from Ubisoft, these chibi statues are licensed by Ubisoft but made by a company called “extreme vinyl”, almost these chibi are way smaller than the ones from Ubisoft, these chibis are about “4 tall while the original Ubisoft chibis are about 6~7” tall.....I have personally brought a couple but the quality is not the same....I rather continue to get the Ubisoft brand....

Well, it’s a BROmance, so it doesn’t get in the way of Thermite x Hibana. 
---
But siege never did promise realism.
---
As long as you have health bars and random stuff pulled out of your rear and hitscan, you'll never have realism, and adding any realism will only make it contradictory and comical.
---
Just don't board it
---
what I meant was that this nerf will do nothing with the annoying part of doka only will make her less usefull. Which means that this nerf is not the solution. It will only make doka be picked less but wont solve the problem of her being an unfun operator to play against.
---
I hope I said it better this time am not really the best at speakin my mind...

i guess i would main mute now

not possible , last tts they were an update every 2 days , and most of the time the tts new season are not optized completly for console yet , so thats a no 
---
Mute is the clear choice here, because he can use all of his gadgets at the start of the round and not worry about setting them up later, his gadget is passive in a way, where you only have to use it once and it does it’s job. As well as having many upsides such as stopping drones, any breaches, and plenty of other gadgets. 
---
But you also recommended the SMG-11 as a sidearm and that thing’s recoil will have them shooting the ceiling lol, otherwise great guide!

*do not contradict the hive*

All I can say, is that I feel it would be better if you made it seem a bit more like a person made it, and to edit changes where it's not 100% clear what it actually talks about. Example is the Capitão one. It's never explicitly stated that it's about his bolts.

People posting like "woow I could've gotten so much karma" and "people don't know this??"

Mate there are new people in the fanbase EVERYDAY.

I myself joined 2 months ago and I didn't know.

Ohh yes

They are completely different operators. One is plant denial and the other is (weak) hard breach + drone denial.

Dokkaebi not calling you when in range of mute jammer is nothing new though. That has been a thing since.. well.. ever.

If you managed to get shocked by twitch 5 times in prep phase, I reserve the right to withhold care for someone who will actually use it later.
---
You killed the sledge by shooting through lions backpack but because you are playing with 180 ping the delay of the kill notification makes it seems as though you killed lion because that’s who you were aiming at when the red X popped up. You hit lion a few times but non in the head. 
---
Respect 
---
Hahah thanks for the support!! :)) Yes I'd love to! Non-default skins are my favourite ♡
---
But Mute can take the shotgun too
---
Why are all the cool operators defenders, why moxie why? ;-; *hugs jäger*
---
I can. Australia isn't actually a nuclear wasteland contrary to popular belief
---
They used same icon for operator and gadget in controls bar when you play. In White Noise ops new ops finally got unique icons for gadget so op's icon can be more personal. Later every older ops got their new unique gadget icons too. I personally like it. 
---
I need no sympathy
---
Literal proof that the hitreg is bad but you can still find retards like you who pretend like it didn't happen. You're the one who is circle jerking.
---
I remember when I started it was about 3 weeks before all attachments and base game ops were free and honestly is sucked as a new player. But then they made that shit free ( even though they didn't refund me my damn renown) it was way better. But no, Ubi has to change things for the worse. 
---
You’re late, bro
---
What about that corner case of you only ever reporting one person? 
---
Most people think that red dot is the worst sight. But hey whatever works for you
---
May I ask which season you started playing Siege? 
---
Kantoraketti, Fabian, Pengu, Goga, Joonas, Canadian, Necrox, Yung, nvK, Geoo, Eclipse, Nesk, Psycho, Virtue, Shatte and BC.
---
Those are the ones that come straight to mind. There's more for sure.
---
If they're making it out of the groups stage of the Invitational they're pretty fucking good.
---
If only we had them...
---
For all we know the amish dont exist

No twitch just said that cav was a psychopath. Nothing more to it.

So many people are downvoting this. Holy shit

IMO they all suck except for Blackbeard’s, and anybody that plays Blackbeard is a loser anyways. Maybe Thatcher if you can put up with looking at his stupidly rounded head.

I’d say wait till the reveal and see what they produce.

Me too. 
---
beaulo is insane, I can't tell if he's that good or he is hacking

I truly am just basing my judgement on his gadget being lame
---
At the end of the day, there’s nothing illegal over showing an in-game name or knowing who was banned regardless. Ubisoft just has that policy for whatever reason. 
---
take ahes acog away i dont care, i always use here with reflex sights

Lol I used the G36C on Ashe anyway.

Mockit denied Liquid a gentlemen's agreement, which they are totally within their rights to do. Gohan essentially publicly called them out for it and announced it, which pissed a lot of Liquid fans off. 
---
During the match, Liquid fans were sending Mockit death threats. And Gohan was being toxic in-game saying things like "Nice cav plays" and things along those lines (For context, Caveira has a bug currently where she can see opponents but they can't see her head. The gents agreement was to not use Cav). So he was obviously tilted and this obviously encouraged the fans accidentally.
---
It's a total clusterfuck but it seems like it's cooled off now. 
---
I think that's a fairly accurate summary of it.
---
Tbh I think they should add a flash effect to it. Not as serious as a flash bang, maybe something more like Ela’s mine. Currently there’s almost no reason to choose breaches precisely because flashes are almost always better.

I consider them believable for the most part, and I don't mind because it's not hammered over our head.

Nobody ever said it was illegal. Something not being illegal doesn't stop someone potentially putting a lawsuit out on you, which will cost money even before it gets thrown out of court

But in all seriousness, I really hope they lower his RoF, his ADS speed, and increase his scope’s magnification. It’s mad that he’s just become an entry fragger.

The issue with casual is that there are no stakes to make you wanna win or lose and there are no punishments for leaving. If you implement a middle ground, there has to be one of the two or its just gonna be treated the same as casual. If you implement the punishment, only trolls would stay in casual and then they would leave because there is no one to troll, then people would complain about the new casual having a leaving penalty. If you implement stakes(Eli gain/loss), you might as well play ranked. At that point, why even have a 3rd mode since it would either be anotger ranked or end up replacing casual.

Because reports dont do anything
---
Get the same poopoo everytime i play :(
---
No..... I have over 1k hours and never, ever seen a blatant hacker.
---
Exactly and the reason for that is that her gun has low recoil, high rate of fire and decent damage. She makes the best fragger in the game and an acog missing isn't going to change that.
---
I think you forgot "no hitbox" in the second part

The GIS are actually based on designs from the Italian military just not the GIS. Same with the GSG9 of who are based on a different rapid response unit 
---
Ubisoft really doesn't look too far into the CTUs and just uses google images however as a reference point if they can find an interesting enough picture otherwise we'd just have 50 guys in black balaclavas. Sometimes they don't even do that and get more focused on making characters than representing a country. 
---
Looks like u havent seen any game lol
---
I also have reported people, but every time (it at least felt like) straight up copy paste response
---
But the other day playing insurgency, I felt like I need to report offensive player name (it super offensive, not some dumb joke) and the reporting only took few clicks
---
Next day I got message thanking me for the report telling that appropriate action was taken (more likely forced name change)
---
Small message that gave me the feeling how my report wasn't just "waste of a time"
---
Unlike in siege where reporting a griefer or other verbal abuse with a video can take 20 to 30 minutes and takes days to weeks for simple acknowledgement of your report...

Yknow I genuinely don’t mind hackers that just try to twist the game around and do weird shit to keep things interesting and different. It’s fun. Call of Duty games, particularly Blops 1 and 2 had some genuinely fun hackers. I myself even have a hacked account just to do fun game types with or ask people if they wanna join private lobbies and fuck around. Good shit like that. I genuinely take problems with the dickheads who just have to break the game to ruin everyone else’s time rather than enhance it.

I got a challenge. It wants me to do "Placeholder description". But the community one is online and its headshots, so i guess 30 headshots?
---
Ash has one extra Stun Grenade, and the option of a high-damage but low capacity pistol, and that's not much.
---
However, the R4-C loosing the ACOG is not much if not irrelevant, if using the ACOG is what determines you winning a gunfight then there is either a problem with you, or a problem with the game.
---
If you consider target demographics then id wager R6 has a much older viewing group, meaning less time to dedicate to watching others play.
---
When you consider Fortnite demographic it becomes obvious younger kids have more time to spend on Twitch.
---
Thats before getting into the nature of the games, Fortnite is "non stop" since you can back out and requeue way more often than in R6, where in its more prominent mode Ranked is minimum 4 rounds....
---
Comparing the two is plain ignorant, as ignorant as using Twitch views as a metric to success.

There's nothing wrong with the accuracy, but a counter terrorist operator in an urban environment wearing jungle camouflage and carrying a shovel on their back? If it were realistic they'd be wearing black uniforms like half the other CTU's do in real life. But that would be boring for a video game so it's a good compromise from both a gameplay and design standpoint.
---
print(“gottem”)
---
&gt; Interesting that they chose 18 seconds. My friends and I were discussing this, and we settled on 20 seconds being an appropriate time. This will be interesting to see, although I think it's a good change.
---
18 seconds is 10% of the match time. 
---
Oh cmon fortnite isn’t that bad of a game. Sure it has its ups and down but it can still be fun.

Ok thanks

Ahahah what?! The hostage can move on their own?

Cheater turned invisible and spawned during prep. Was probably a toxic Ash main moving at mach 5.

Don't forget they can also individually kick players and kill other people while making it display SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME so it looks like you're the one hacking and not them.

But the way he phrased it implies that a very large amount of games are plagued with teleport hacks. That simply isn't true.

---
I’d like to see Lions gun go from 50 to 30 and his fire rate go up to 800, like most assault rifles. His ability to keep laying down fire like an LMG paired with hard hitting rounds means it takes no skill to have dominance over the defenders.
---
Blitz: I am in 100% agreement and I think the change to 2 speed was horrible and poorly thought out.   
---
Deplorable shields:  the light explosive change might be too much, or maybe just keep zofia as a counter.  Also I didn’t think sledge could destroy deplorable shields?
---
Maverick:  the 3 Armor 1 speed is actually a really interesting idea.  He’s need some kind of buff to go with it, but I think that would be a great change given how maneuverability plays really well with his gadget.
---
Crouch spam: Ubi is actually working on a fix right now!  It’s just like CSGO’s system.   
---
Alibi: Cosmetics changing with her is too much to render/ keep updated from what I remember.   
---
Nomad: awesome idea about the light!!
---
Lion: I agree 50 rounds is too much for his V308.
---
Vigil: Vigil should counter lion Justy like Echo does to Dokkabei.
---
I think I underestimated how lucky I got
---
Ackal
---
What would be nice if they included in an update, a type of monitoring system to where if a cheat were to be activated, or some type of lag switching or ddosing, the monitoring system would detect it or detect something that is not part of the game code/software and insta-ban that individual.  It would save support the trouble of having to view clips of hackers/cheaters if they even do.
---
Hopefully 😅

I felt the disappointment after hearing the gun click.

Do you have gsync on? I am wondering since my video doesn't capture the screen freeze it's an issue with gsync and my monitor.

Most people should be using the holo or reflex on the R4C. They always just rush anyways the acog has the opposite effect.
---
This. For clarification.
---
Gridlock is dope she’s way more realistic than dokkaebi or ela

Same thing happened to me today in OW, it's a bit of comfortion after your gaming experience being ruined by a bastard cheater.

I love rook-star 
---
What are those hands 🤢🤮🤣
---
Oh I get ya. I have my own reasons for why sometimes playing games might not be something I can firmly commit time to as well. 
---
A part of that though regardless of _why_ a player leaves, they still left. They are still negatively affecting the remaining people. If the amount of time you are able to commit is that flimsy then it should be the responsibility of the player to not put themselves into the system. Instead of expecting the system to give them lenience.
---
  It's a deterrent not just against rage quitters, but also people with overly variable schedules as well. Even if you and I might personally find that bothersome there is value to having that system there.

No worries man, I've used it for years, have to wear glasses when at my computer, and play alot on a night, used to get head aches and eye strain all the time, did some research found f.lux and have never looked back works like a charm, the options are quite flexible too for a small free program to get it set up just how you like

What the heck is this? This is the worst error I’ve ever seen. I mean seriously, playing hostage?!

I meant people are gonna Instant swap to that and complain 
---
Well that's just pure depression 
---
Wait, is this real actual news?
---
Edit: also suggest trying out a different scope like the reflex. It may not be you cup of tea for most things but some sights compliment some weapons very well
---
Haha, no you can’t tell by movement and aim. You need to just realize you are wrong and are probably just bad. I’m not trying to be mean, but you are talking complete bullshit right now. 
---
I’m taking a wild guess here by the way you are talking that you are a low level, probably bronze or silver. I’m willing to bet you’ve never even encountered a M&amp;KB player yet.

A Skorpion with 25 bullets just doesnt seem right, Her gun should have a slight recoil change though as it's pretty terrible. Grzmots are fine imo

Thank you!! Ive been trying to explain that to so many people that twitch veiws dont count. My freinds and brothers have been constantly telling me that twitch views count. For example insurgency sandstorm, it is not streamed much but it has a more mature audience and a stable player count.
---
They most likely nerfed lesion because as an Intel operator his gadgets were way too punishing late game if the last attacker was already low health and with 7 mines that did 8 damage a tick could take over half your health if you got hit by all of them at least once 
---
Any info regarding individual prices and not the whole bundle?

I know hacking is the worst thing ever. But you gotta thank them for this hilarious video

If you added swear words into some parts I think it would rhyme better

(For example: “he was looking kinda high with his MP5 aiming straight at my fucking forehead”.
---
The GIGN almost seem out of place with how accurate they are when no other CTU really is 
---
I'd be happy if they just gave it a consistent recoil pattern, so it could atleast be predicted.
---
Yeah, tachanka's pick rate was like way lower than clash but clash has -13% lower win delta than fucking tachanka. Are you gonna sit here and tell me Ash is good because she has a high pickrate? High pickrate is bad, but it doesnt make them good, it makes them fun to play.
---
Because the report system here is a placebo. 
---
wait ash is legit losing acog?
---
The GIGN have employed female spec ops 
---
I used it thank you defenetly useful  maybe the best format for this meme so far

Hello ExtremeBruhMoment, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aqysst/just_lost_7_headshots_because_of_the_challenge/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I don't think it'll make it to the live servers, if it does you can bet Twitch will lose her ACOG too.  
---
Watching Pro League atm, you see more Holo R4-C then ACOG R4-C.  
---
My guess is they revert the ACOG change and instead massively decrease the R4-C's damage (to 30) and slightly increase recoil.
---
I’d certainly like to think so, but this is also REEEEddit and a surprising number of people on here can’t seem to take a joke. Figures I’d be clear from the get go. 
---
Not really but can't doubt it doesn't annoy me sometimes, I just want an explanation.
---
All I know about that game is that it's free, you build stuff and shoot people battle royale style. The whole building element just didn't attract me so I never touched it. I don't hate it, I just really don't give a damn about it. Apex pretty cool, its the first BR game I tried. Mainly because it's free. 
---
Siege is still great and very unique. I honestly hope ubi isn't going to follow the BR hype and forget about siege in the future like other companies ditched projects in favour of the BR hypetrain.
---
I think the GIGN are arguably more accurate but idk 
---
Okay so ash had a 75% pick rate, the vast majority of the attacking aide has around a 28% pick rate
---
Still not seeing anything to actually support your claim.
---
I agree but I also post like this when I'm mad after losing a few games so just asking really
---
That’s legit then, but for example the seals and spetsnaz haven’t

The main point is that it still sells mousesports’ kit despite the org left?
---
Yes. Fortnite has that stupid color coded weapon level system, but Apex has any gun (except the mozambique lol) can theoretically do just as good as any weapon. Sure, there's the golden weapons like the kraber and the mastiff but it's so much more achievable to win in Apex than in a fortnite lobby where 1 pro squad dominates everyone.
---
It ain't gonna kill for it, but it's sure gonna put one helluva dent in it for a while
---
How long has this been in the game?
---
Is there a comment from Ubisoft on this?
---
You should put the hug in a video ;)
---
 Not going to lie as a woman I kinda wish they’d kept it lower simply because it makes the existing women feel more special, when you make it 50/50
---
It kinda feels like it almost defeats the point of the inclusion 
---
You are right.  I was confusing that with the fact that there wouldn’t be a John Clark in the Jack Ryan Series, not the Rainbow film.
---
Some people dont realize that kids have the luxury to watch all day non stop.
---
Thx m8
---
I'm not seeing any evidence against it
---
I wish more people thought like this, if you're not interested in the game leave it, nobody is forcing you to play it, siege is great because it's unique, it doesn't need a battle royale mode because that's not the type of game this is 
---
Headshots.

But wouldn't it be more satisfying to just get the kills and clutch the game? You see one initiate a kick and then you leave, like there are three more people who wanna see you play it out man

Microsoft refuses to open Server in mid east because its just not worth for them.
---
Sorry man but i gotta say nah
---
Doc on defense and ash on attack but it'll prob change to buck or twitch now
---
frost or caveria
---
Nice photoshop skills mate 
---
Idk about defense, but Buck on attack
---
Ubi pls

Hello me89xx, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.
---
ash and alibi are just so good alibi is such a underrated operator and a really good roamer
---
Thankyou
---
"Well shit."
---
Mozzie
---
What's in the canister ?
---
honestly the ash nerf is not that bad reflex is still pretty good.
---
I dont think so
---
Yeah but you don't bust other peoples shit when they accidentally use it, so that makes the hypocrisy okay.
---
BOPE and JTF both have realistic operators and gear for the map they were released with
---
S.I. will be over by the time the Six Invitationals are over
---

---
Pretty asinine comment for a game that doesn't even really sell DLC.
---
The railing at the beginning gave me PTSD
---
Hello insurgency:sandstorm.
---
After reviewing the footage, there’s blood on the wall but I think it’s knee cap blood rather than pp blood so it’s good.
---
Maybe spell loses correctly
---
When you get spawnpeeked by the same guy for the 3rd time in your ranked match  and think about uninstalling 
---
Well it's obvious . But still I am happy cause any anything that drags this game (Fortnite) into the dust , I am happy with it . 
---
Your opinion is invalid. Straight up 
---
[Rocket League does the same.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8yog5v/ubi_heres_a_leaf_you_could_take_out_of_rocket/) Ubi, plz.

Blessed thee

"Ok, so that guy either melts me in 0.2 seconds with a machine gun or in 0.2 seconds with a sub machine gun... I like my odds"

Why are these always not available for worldwide delivery DAMNIT 
---
Well his face was revealed already ages ago in the outbreak cutscenes 
---
Would be cool
---
Plus PUBG still has many bugs and problems. After being out for this long.

I have adobe photoshop and I’m doing my best to figure it out but I have literally zero experience in this area. I’m looking more to make the operator logo because I’m not even close to advanced enough to make an actual operator. It makes sense that you have a background in this stuff.l because I’m extremely lost lol
---
steam just opens up uplay. also if you already have it on uplay, and get it on steam, you're going to have to re-download it again
---
*slightly below average 
---
“Fuck”
---
Yeah but it makes ash a bit more situational as she can't take on a doc or tight angles as easily 
---
I dont really understand why they would remove it. Who complains about getting killed by ash because she has an acog... 
---
I like having customization in games, and it seems rb6 is jist removing that.
---
I stopped playing a while back so I dont really care either way. But for some reason it still puts me off coming back
---
Western Europe 
---
It's quite a normal price for collectible figures
---
Ash mains having panic attacks atm
---
so uhm do you have youtube link or smth ?
---
Then I’ve gotten really lucky. I’ve gotten the universal skin, a legendary outfit Dokkaebi, the headgear for pulse, and the charm for him. I’m gonna have really bad luck with last one.
---
Hey there. My regular account is having password issues but I am a bit of a lurker here and I want to extend an offer to help anyone out that’s picking the game up or trying it out this weekend. I am a decent plat player and definitely remember the crazy learning curve right when I started playing. Feel free to message me with any questions at all or we can jump into a custom game on Xbox and work through some stuff. Siege is an incredibly dynamic game, so no question is stupid. :)
---
the reflex is just as good on ash so im not to mad that she her acog is wont make her lose the ability to be in obj in the first 7 seconds of when the round starts
---
What is S.I. skin?
---
I do what about it
---
Didn't you see the flying Doc? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acc3gc/i_didnt_know_doc_have_a_jetpack/
---
its the white skin you get from the packs
---
In end game 1v1 I’ll take smoke any day, provides cover, distraction, and forces movement, it’s perfect for a stalemate, but In literally any other situation mute is better 
---
Yea its not an automised response at least you see who responds but the messages you get are pretty close to copy paste, doesnt satisfy me.
---
Well only for ash only and really I think its a wise choice 
---
Not the first time ubi mixed up uniforms. For example the GSG9 is wearing the getup of an other police force (dont remember the name) instead of their own.
---
He be straight boolin on these bois
---
Anorexic? She’s got a pretty normal body shape. I don’t think all poles are overweight 
---
Yeah I rewatched the cutscenes and saw that, I thought people were saying he appears in the cutscenes without a mask 
---
yea them too
---
Isn't there 2 chibi series' now? We could be mixing them up
---
Ohh okay, got it thanks.
---
It doesn't?
---
I mean how hard is it to make elas gun the same as it was when she came out? Align with that and reduce magazine size. Nerfing her recoil, damage and taking away impacts...IMO was just two much. 
---
If there are no recoil or damage buffs, why not at least give back the impacts to make her somewhat better pick? I rarely ever pick Ela since they originally nerfed her. Maybe use her with shotgun depending on map/site, but other than that...she dying.
---
Uploading a vid to ubisoft support was too complicated for me. Took me like an half hour im not doing it again cuz i dont feel like its worth it.
---
Hostage is suicidal
---
I was wondering why her shoulders were blushing 
---
Seriously %100
---
Jeez play a new character 
---
dude im a blitz main now
---
Better than skyscraper 
---
Do you mean SEK? If so, then yes. Ubisoft modeled the GSG-9 operators off of the SEK regional counter-terrorist operators.
---
They deffenitely know, they just (say) they cant share if the player gets banned or not.
---
Then get back in your hypocrite pit and report your failings to your fuher (I don't speak German so I probably butchered that)
---
Well if they did, everyone would look like the gign and be 3 armour 1 speeds.
---
"Oh... OH GOD THE GUNS GOT NO AMMO-" *Dead* - Soviet
---
So 8 in total, no basic operators + 8 more?
---
Seems deceptive to advertize it as such on the Steam page.
---
Yeah
---
I’m looking for literally the same thing but on PC, I have more fun doing crazy plays and chatting with my teammates then I do actually winning
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Usually the Icons have something to do with the power. Maybe its just me but I don't see a drone hacker here.
---
So X basic operators + 8 extra ones? Or 8 total?
---
Yes, you get no basic operators from the start.
---
No edition does now.
---
I freaking love skyscraper lol
---
Latin american lol
---
&gt; I've never seen a game with anything like this being possible.
---
I think you dropped an /s?
---
I dont think they necessarily need to lower the recoil but like he said above, change it so its a consistent recoil pattern. One bursts recoil patter goes to left, the next burst goes up and to the right lol. 
---
8 total. Other operators can be unlocked through Renown which is earned from completing matches, challenges etc.
---
But twitch is 2 speed
---
Or the guy who said he snapped his disc over it lmao
---
Considering not all of the GIGN is 3 armor I disagree, especially because France has a distinct uniform style for urban GIGN units, no other country would look like them
---
You're a mad man, I hate that shit lol 
---
I think they should make the rank pool the same as pro league, those are the very best maps in the game 
---
I meant American as in he crossed the border into the U.S. lmao
---
It’s because I was in silent step it’s a non lethal melee
---
No, this is Patrick
---
The Lord 
---
Looks even better with the six invitational headgear and fnatic uniform 
---
save it
---
You haven’t played enough games.
---
I played the game 2 tomes by myself. I played the game for around 120 hours the first time. I still play it and it is a lot of fun.
---
Oh I fw this. That intro transition was crisp. Just wish it was longer though.
---
This is why PC is hilarious 
---
Even still I’m pretty sure they can have incomplete animations where all you have to do is charge the gun. 
---
Dose this affect console aswell
---
Can't wait to get killed after finally snagging one of them. Who knows though. Maybe I'll get a round or two in.
---
My only guess is that it's to counter the fact that it's very easy to waste a lot of your bullets with the smg12 given the recoil
---
or.....ORRRR.... G36C....
---
Now that would be something I’d pay to see. WaW never really had anti cheat so I’m guessing after all this time it’s gotten to the point where people are implementing their own code to override player models too 😂. 
---
[Oh, you mean this YouTube link?](https://youtu.be/pM_pIJL5BFQ) 
---
Find game's .exe 
---
then right click on it,
---
then properties
---
then find the drop down menu that lets you choose the GPU the program uses
---
As a fellow Turkish player can confirm this. They are probably translating those lines from paper. They don't even know the how context works sooo yeaah. If they did a community translate like Ark&amp;Atlas does it would be so much better. I'm worked as a translator on Atlas and we did a good job because we also play the game and know the contexts. 
---
It depends on the gun, Siege is very inconsistent, idk why some guns work like that and others don’t 
---
Or maybe like the Outbreak ones 
---
I mean look at the collection and see what you dont have...if all that is remaining is the charms, ask yourself is it worth spending money on a charm lol?
---
Rainbow six on one of the most popular days vs fortnite on a normal day 
---
CSGo Major, not everyone into esports, etc.
---
I just wanna make sure I have this 100% correct before I spend money. I bought the starter edition a while ago and I wanna upgrade to the Deluxe Edition. I know that I can't directly upgrade to it, but can I just buy the Deluxe Edition on the same Uplay account and launch that? If so, will I keep my progress so far or will I have to restart?
---
Ashal pronounced Asshole
---
Lesion is useful anywhere so I'd say him for defence 
---
Even though she's not my favourite I'd have to say zofia on attack, she can do basically anything except hard breach 
---
Maybe
---
Definitely. Idk why it's not already that way. Dont they want ranked to be a premium experience?
---
Bandit where are you putting thoes jumper cables?
---
Bandit? BANDIT?!
---
Is just network delay, the server sees that you’ve been killed or downed but your client hasn’t received that information yet so it allows you to fire on your screen, when that information gets sent to the server it will reject your shot because it sees that you are either down or dead and therefore cannot shoot.
---
I'm actually really stupid
---
Don't expect it, that's just asking for a jinx.
---
Just save.
---
Also I'd think if you join a game in progress you should get like a 1.25x renown boost to encourage you to stay in the server.
---
Most ctu have the same equipment. but its more of having a overweight women in the australian SAS (wich are one of the most pristine and serious special forces in the world). Its very disrespectful
---
If only they put Mjolnir instead.
---
I never encountered a cheater in R6
---
TIL easy loop hole for developers to bypass update restrictions on console platforms.  
---
but seriously? is it really that easy to bypass the systems put in place by sony and microsoft. like, just keep your game in beta and push updated whenever you like?  
---
is there any downside to keeping your game in beta than to make a full release?  
---
why do Sony and Microsoft has these restrictions in the first place? like you aren't allowed to do frequent updates of your game isn't beta?  
---
can you explain more? just trying to quench my curiosity.
---
I need to update it. I play as maverick and valk now
---
Small amount always watch esports. Especially being it’s played rn and most are working or like myself in school 
---
After so many years of the hostage just sitting down and being a hostage it was kind of freaky to see it run so fast
---
Best duo ever
---
Your english is really good indeed. Give this man a chance! 
---
looks like he's about to drop that rap song Interro was talking about
---
More like jackass, just imagine gettin chase by ash, and she knows where you have been and will be 
---
Yes to all of the above. I have been wanting to play defenders on t hunt classic for so long, but I’ve never seen Ubisoft make an official statement on their plans for it. Such a minor change can do so much for replayability
---
Helmets don't work in universe anyway
---
Pointless. You have more than enough.
---
What the fuck!! I loved it!!
---
Totally worth it. Guaranteed to be supported for another year due to the Year 4 pass being sold. They plan to have 100 ops which means they plan to support the game for quite a few years beyond Year 4.
---
I have the high ground! 
---
Unless fortnite is also having an event lol
---
Also it's the middle of the schoolday in the U.S.
---
Also fortnite is not doing so well now that Apex is out
---
But why was she so fast?
---
You can expect at least 5 years more worth of content, that will keep the core player base busy for a long time.
---
Can someone Photoshop Matt Andrews hanging from the ledge, waiting to strike
---
Only in russia...
---
 i am on pc 
---
Fortnite would show up less as the other game being popular would show up more
---
Actually this aint gonna get printed. We live in 2019 rgb is pure light and the screens are getting only better. You can easily read his letters on the white background. 
---
Favorites are arguably G2 who dominated last year's competition and are also current world champions. I'd put Evil Geniuses second.
---
That being said, all teams are super strong and have what it takes to win.
---
Depends on your mindset. If you like to learn and never stop learning, YES!  
---
I have a lot of friends who don't want to invest a big amount of time and so they prefer Overwatch and other little more "lighter" and easier to get into games.
---
Back in Casual I used to teabag with my friends
---
But UBI is planing to make new operators anyway...
---
And I can see that point and understand why many like him. Just not my cup of tea.
---
In-ear for the actual sound, headset for the mic but the ear pads for removing sound leaks. 
---
More than enough ammo O_o
---
I use holo anyway
---
Just search the game you want to watch. 
---
Fortnite being in the top left of twitch doesn’t make it harder to watch other games 
---
I see why are other players don't use in-ear? 
---
Ha I see what you did there. I saw the picture though multiple different times.
---
My point is that complaining about uniform realism is dumb
---
Tachanka wears a blast shield, Ela wears yoga pants, Jager wears a literal pilot's helmet, Jackal has a VR headset, you get the picture.
---
So u have never run out of ammo? Cus i have..
---
Yeah I’m sorry I assumed. Maybe you just have to wait a bit or go to the ubistore or whatever. I’m not that familiar with pc.
---
What do you mean by other players?
---
Omg...Justin is the inspiration for our beloved Maestro!!!
---
Of course I have. When I've spammed way too much
---
Siege has a huge community but not a lot of viewers, I'm guessing most ppl like playing, but not watching.
---
Mid health 
---
&gt;What is the keyboard, mouse, headset and monitor they are using?
---
The monitor is supplied (not sure which model though), the rest is brought in by the players.
---
&gt;I also want to know why other players is using in-ear earphones plus headset?
---
They use in-ears for the actual game sound while the over-ears are for noise canceling purposes.
---
Gotta go with Lesion on defense, and Buck on offense( may or may not be biased)
---
Montagne is mountain in French 
---
I got you fam
---
Most of them is for the better tbh
---
We have too many people playing our game to be on top when there isn't an event. 
---
please don't do this. You can just share (on mobile its next to the up/downvote button
---
Blitz is op if you don't know how to counter him. And his counters are
---
Mute
---
Ela
---
Clash 
---
Smoke ect
---
yeah no worries
---
Carried by an invisible Ash.  Probably.
---
"I dont play ranked but I think its good as it is" Thats basically what you said. Maybe you need to try to play more than 10 games every 3 months and only after that create posts about changes with ranked?
---
How does one add a main title
---
Watch the tutorials, play a few Situations, and buy operators with the earned Renown.
---
Yeah I bought the advanced edition for a friend and was surprised to see he didn't have anyone unlocked. I guess read before buy...
---
No
---
Hi sweetie 
---
&gt;It doesn't address what was asked.
---
 It is relative to the question asked therefore it is the answer you receive.
---
&gt;So you don't want shit ideas called shit ideas?
---
As I said,  in a proper manner, yes.
---
&gt;So much irony. Your opinion isn't automatically worthy of respect. 
---
Neither is anyone's opinion, nor did I say that my opinion was.
---
&gt;Doesn't even mean anything...
---
If you can read, then you'd realise it does.
---
Oh hello 
---
Zero armor would be naked, and this is a family game.
---
No, this is 5 speed -1 armor.
---
Its action phase and you havnt but down your yokai?
---
I already have frost
---
I just think that it could be a good idea for a operator for Y4. But it is nice to see peoples opinion..
---
Well, there are a VR theory.
---
though not the doot
---
Where is the mute one?!
---
Thanks for enjoying my story
---
Perfectly balanced
---
#StopBlitzAbuse
---
&gt; Do you get Renown only from competetive games or also casual games (whatever they are called)?
---
You get Renown for basically any activity.
---
&gt;And does the game have vs AI mode for when I just want to try new operators without pissing any team mates off for playing poorly?
---
Yep, that's called Terrorist Hunt. Can be played alone, online with friends or online with matchmaking.
---
Just so  i am aware was thermite's one of the lighter ones or the heavier ones
---
I got all 3 enabled 
---
If anything, it's actually stuck in the *past*. Operators have official ages now, but their bios used to show year of birth as well. If you calculate the date based on their original birth years, time has stopped passing around ~2017.
---
Haven't done the proper calculations yet, but Thatcher is 56 and was born in June 1961, IQ is 38 and was born in August 1979, while Ying is 33 and was born in May 1983.
---
As for *Operation Archangel*, the events of *Wildlands* takes place in [July 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/a9nmye/story_what_is_canon/eckyncq/). Since Bowman wants Caveira's brother for intel on El Sueño, it's safe to assume the mission takes place during basegame and before *Narco Road* or *Fallen Ghosts*.
---
Artistic liberties are a very good thing. 
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
Not sure, they all seem to have about the same weight.
---
Glaz, anchoring with him would be insane with the smokes and his scope
---
I swear to let the anger out that builds throughout the day. I am a little ticked off by this. See there you go not a swear word but I swear just to swear.
---
Plot twist, I’m actually Anthony Pits little brother.
---
[Here’s the link, thank you for showing interest.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PZeZOAgMzCwTyyhE-oziw) 
---
This game is barely 3 going on 4 years old, where as counter strike is like 65 yrs old or close to it 😂 (and cs moves around like a 65 yr old man 😂 ) 
---
Aight thx
---
Yeah Doc would be pretty OP, Rook would be good too
---
Better than vox 
---
Dokka has a weak ability already, What justifies the nerf?
---
Aah you mean that woman on the left and the man on the right. Yeah i don't really like them and the Batman who was introducing the teams really annoyed me with his voice
---
Ah, I see now. Well then the new player thing is probably the reason 
---
Hello SuperUltimate23, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.
---
Do you honestly think Tachanka, THE WORST OPERATOR IN THE GAME, is in a good place? His turret is his weak point since it makes him an easy target. The way you play him isn't very smart since if you need to retreat or sneak up on someone you can't. His hitbox is also pretty big which makes him not a good choice for roaming.
---
Wait, are these real?
---
This is one continuous support case, they're all referring to the same breach.
---
Umm I'm not sure how to calculate the weight because we don't know how vigils chibi will look and what will be it's dimensions
---
You've been here for a while yet you make so naive points. It doesn't matter whether someone likes particular operators or not. It shouldn't be the reasoning behind the whole P&amp;B system. Bans should be made according to strats and map peculiarities. That brings us to another point, where the majority of the playerbase doesn't know or doesn't want to bother following this and would just ban who they don't like or someone who is a pain to play against. 
---
I'm here since day one and it's crystal clear to me that while Siege was intended to be a tactical shooter where decision making and teamplay along with communication is the key to victory, with it becoming more and more popular the playerbase is becoming more casual and dumb ensuring the pro league style of play and its rules won't work with regular players. 
---
The pro league is a controlled environment completely separate from the rest of the game and the average player. Its sole purpose (in Siege at least) is to advertise the game and bring more players (customers for Ubi) into it. Therefore it should not steer the wheel and determine the course we're taking. If players enjoy the pro league rules, fine, let them have a separate mode to have fun at, but you can't bring a contained environment with trained pro players who play Siege for a living intro a completely chaotic ranked with random players.
---
Oh I forgot to say im playing on console
---
Pretty sure there is an option on steam, when refunding, where it says “it’s cheaper now”
---
You american or EU ?  
---
For an european the timing is decent (quite late matches sometimes) but as far as i'm aware some matches are directly in the working hours of most people and that's an obvius dive in viewership.   
---
Then comes it's not weekend yet, for some it's holiday season bla bla bla.   
---
Without knowing the numbers i'm guessing CS:GO maors have the same percentage of viewers compared to full playerbase. 
---
nothing transfers
---
I know but still the G36C is a pile of wank still. I love the gun and I think it's a pretty iconic one and if for once Ubi's stats are correct and that only 1% of people use the thing I think maybe a little more change would be nice. Also I've given up on Zofia even though I love her to death she just feels very un exciting as it just gets boring be a more shoot your four grenades off than your done. But yet again she's a piece of shit to her sister which is my favorite character so maybe it's that.
---
Twitch and Doc.
---
Twitch - Shock drone for destroying traps and black mirrors to give a deadly sightline. Also the weapons used by her, the deadly F2 and the great 417. F2 for a more close quarters map and bombsight, 417 for ranged combat. The P9 is also a really good pistol and the revolver needs no description. 
---
Doc - Most obvious reason, the stim pistol. Whether you want to be toxic and spawn peak or be useful and use for teammate resets so they get that extra 25 hp, its amazing and viable for any sight and map. The P90 is fun and good with its acog allowing for long range engagements with 51 bullets for spray and pray in close quarters. The SG-CQB is really fun and meme worthy as well and also viable at some times. The MP5 doesn't need an introduction either because we all know it's good. 
---
Blow them away with the all new blitz
---
Your first 800 Renown is earned by watching 3 tutorial videos.
---
You get 700-800 Renown for every Situation if you complete it with 3 stars regardless of difficulty. 
---
Casual match gives you 150-200 Renown plus 150-250 for every daily/weekly challenge completed. 
---
Ideally, you’ll have all 20 “base” operators in just 2-3 evenings of playing. Their cost varies from 500 to 2000.
---
DLC Operators cost much more - 25.000 Renown, soon to be changed - but with enough dedication you should be getting a new operator every 2-3 weeks.
---
“YO ADRIAN”
---
Montagne as defender. It's all we wanted from Clash and more.
---
Sweet. 
---
Well this is a buy for me then. Thank you so much for taking the time to inform me!
---
Thx :'(
---
You better not be talkin trash about siege's best shoutcaster my guy
---
All they said was 10 cm 
---
He's an ash main so this looks about right.
---
I spent 30 seconds trying to figure out how to get into the wrong house, Rainbow Six:dabs is a really fun game 
---
uwu that's amazin, sweet littel boi
---
This nerf isn’t gonna do anything, the main problems with the R4 are its manageable recoil, high RoF and higher damage. Ash was already a rusher, removing ACOG was not the right nerf lol.
---
Nyooooooom
---
Is that rogue 9 in the top right
---
But they did it with the Year One operators, GSG 9, GIGN etc... And they don't look the same. You can see the difference between Rook and Jäger, but they are realistic. So.. Okay, we need some unique looks but this is too much. At least give them a Helmet and a blacklava mask.
---
Sucks when this happens but at least you added to the 45 million. Hope your friend enjoys the game.
---
So they are the same height? They still all have different widths though
---

[Just look at her in high res. This is the PROMO pic too. Imagine how much worse the final product might be.](https://store.ubi.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-masterCatalog/default/dw67a03f15/images/large/5c61e3a64e016544e45cf6d8-collectible-1_Six-Collection-ela-chibi.jpg)

Better get used to it, because this happens with everything you'll ever purchase in life. 
---
just keep in mind this was a $60 game
---
15 Headshots for this challenge. Saw an earlier post in english. (I was wondering too) I guess it's just a bug for the German Ubi Club
---
Nomav

Funny thing is, they said like 99% of people picked her R4C. I guess her other gun is trash. I've never used it myself as the R4C was good for me. 😂
---
Fartnite bad
---
Team killing simulator good

Will this discord allow Blitz mains that play on Xbox
---
*Yer mother
---
The thing is it did, all of the players were shown and then just a few frames before the camera cut back to the commentators only his icon changed back to the operator
---
Look guys another upset ash main. Ahahahahah
---
I never said is was an ace. Neither did anyone in the thread. Learn to read. 
---
Thanks! :)
---
Headshots
---
I just a bust a nut...
---
Ok
---
You mean the Australian ones? New operators will come out with their exclusive weapons which can't be equiped on any other operator but maybe both Aussie ops will have shared weapons
---
Zofia is very viable and is good, a lot of people use her especially in higher ranks I believe. Good utility, good gun, 2 speed conpared to Ash but I don't think that matters too much you can still entry frag or what not. Oh she can also revive herself.

Look at the very first comment in the thread...
---
"Looks like an ace to me"
---
The real issue is that they try to shoehorn a political agenda into the game that nobody needs. 
---
Can confirm, we are true heroes
---
What wait wtf what??!

CHINESE CENSORSHIP 
---
Is the DPI adjustable in the in-game settings or is that on my general PC settings
---
I’m more interested in Kaid and his cat
---
I'm a fucking everything player. Wanna try a better insult? Nice to see you have to dig through my history to try to make a comeback because you cant form a logical argument.
---
Exactly. The base game (the one with legacy op progression) does not exist on console now. The deluxe edition is what exists now. The one with all the base game ops and Y1 ops.
---
Not me. Lol I played it once and said, wow, horrible and went back to siege, although I have the same reactions to siege sometimes, but still a far better concept than fortnite, in my opinion. 
---
Practice, and remember to change the controls for convinence if need be, as for me I did not like the original controls. 
---
Never said they were competing just said that’s what I’m gonna play now, also you talk about how ubi is taking all these steps forward and moving towards balance, why is the ranked still in beta then bud?
---
Yea but most players already know the locations and shoot them out fasts. Drones are mobile and small so they are much harder to shoot and see, and provide much better angles to scan from
---
Is there a link between this and the fact ranked on siege is still in beta?
---
Pulse is easy, he looks like a guy cosplaying as a special forces soldier. 
---
How does this look for you now btw?
---
They are on console chief
---
I looked for 2 seconds and saw you ride b04s cock so cry me a river and then down in it pussy 
---
Tbh the designs I dislike the most are the Moroccan ones, they don't look bad per se, but it's like they're just recolored Maestro and Valkyrie
---
I have no idea why it's in beta. I'm not an ubi dev bud.
---
Can you provide me with a new link? 
---
Exactly, its two entirely different demographics anyway. There's nothing to compare and nothing to be gained from having more viewers than them
---
Truly a model for what the most civilized discourse on the internet looks like.
---
Ultimate t-pose
---
Lol. EzPz.
---
I think it says: "Send Bitcoin"
---
So you can set your DPI with your mouse software. In the game itself you can adjust the sensitivity. DPI will be global for your pc while in game will just be for in that specific game. I have used 800 for a long time and the majority of my friends also play on 800 and just turn up in game sensitivity to their liking Bc every game is different. I started on 400 and worked my way up to 800 and haven’t felt the need to go any higher. But your mileage may vary. 
---
The search goes on
---
To be fair, Fornite is a game aimed at the younger generation who are known to be somewhat fickle and less picky in their gaming choices. Older people (or to be specific more mature people) tend to be attracted by solid games, and they'll stick to them for a lot of years before moving on. 
---
You can stop worrying about toxicity now 
---
Send bbq bb 
---
For Multiplayer, training situations is the case, however in Terrorist Hunt...
---
I'm the only one that see something else? lol
---
Because they have their regions set to EU. The game has absolutely no idea they’re in the Middle East. And Ubi has already announced that they’re trying their best to get servers set up in those areas.
---
No, but I see everything 
---
What a lame way to look at it. Yeah, aces generally require the opponent to make a mistake or two, but it’s still quite the accomplishment to kill the entire enemy team yourself in one round. It’s extremely rare so it’s really exciting when it does happen 
---
F in chat anyone?
---
You are right, the building aspect of Fortnite actually keeps a lot of players out. 
---
Can't say I remember that.
---
What mouse do you have? If it’s razor download razer synapse
---
what was the music you used towards the end? great edit btw! this style is very overdone, but you made it fresh once more.
---
Well on console how would you bind this?
---
I was at work watching Kix play on Twitch a couple months ago and two of my coworkers looked into my cube and asked who that girl was. 
---
I havent bought gaming peripherals yet, so I'm just using my normal logitech m+k
---
And that's fine at least you played it before you formed an opinion, besides I'm sure you'd rather play siege than complain about/discuss fortnite 
---
wow no zofia, fuck this
---
Goddammit you beat me to it
---
I would recommend lots of terrorist hunt
---
Go for a razer basilisk, it’s what I use and it’s amazing. Also if you want a run-down/ someone to help with adjustment you can add me (Mr._JB.)
---
Do you have a yt
---
Go into the sub, hit the three dots then choose add flair
---
Yeah, if you lie down in a certain spot then you fall into a weird cave under the map

---
Thanks!
---
Correct. Weaponry was also kept simple and reliable. Sub machine guns and flashbangs. Funny enough, it was one operator's habit of smoking cigars that blew their cover. 
---
Probably not, i don't think Rainbow Six gets that many updates really.  
---
I think they just know that the game "health" wise is not up to standard that they are looking for in ranked with things like servers, hit boxes, cheats, bugs etc.  
---
Also on PC it's using their own platform so wouldn't make a difference.
---
Sidebar, next to your name is an "edit" button. If on mobile it is in the sub settings in the app somewhere.
---
Hm i have same cpu it high usage but it not 100%, do you play on highest settings?
---
Fair enough
---
Oh for sure. And I don't mind the concept of fortnite either, ive always preferred PUBG but apex is pretty good too. Its a blend of the two in a way. 
---
Works for me. I'll take it.

Hello log347, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ar24bh/help/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Is that on discord? I assume that's how most people communicate
---
It honestly bplays way closer to overwatch than pubg Imo. It's based off Titanfall, but I have never played that.
---
How is removing the giant teeth scarier???
---
My discord is JB#9075
---
The top one might be like the outbreak symbol for someone who has that operator’s outbreak set currently equipped. Dokkebi has an invitational skin so thats my guess.
---
There will be SI packs, the challenge is to get 15 headshots and reach the community threshold for 3000 renown
---
These guys are honestly my favorite casters from any of the esports I watch.  They do an incredibly good job of explaining what's going on in a match for a game that has some really nuanced strategy that's not at all apparent from simply knowing the basic rules and mechanics of the game.

Peeker's advantage exists, and its exactly equal to the ping of the person you are peeking. So if you peek someone with 30ms ping, you get 30 milliseconds of reaction advantage over them. It also means that if you have 300 ping and someone peeks you, they have 300 milliseconds of reaction advantage over you, which is a fight you cannot win. If you have high ping, you have to play aggressively otherwise you will lose almost ever engagement.
---
Because we can only have two stickies at a time and there's more important stuff to pin. I wouldn't mind having 10 pins right now actually.
---
Caveira dominatss at low ranks since most people there don't use their drones. At higher ranks, people WILL use their drones because they know it's power. Vigil basically counters this, because you may know where he is, but you don't know exactly. 
---
why is the /s there?

Can you not buy them individually?

Yup, i think it's 600 if I remember 
---
sorry what does VTK mean? 
---
Yeah I kinda like the simplicity of it sometimes it just goes overboard with all the traps and counters it could be a good change of pace
---
I think the characters look just fine. I like Mozzie's helmet. I hope he's a 3 speed so I can play as him 
---
45 mil registered not active.  Still good sales for a 3+ year old game. Im proud how far we've come, it has to be an anomaly in software development.

Apex Legends tho.
---
Thanks for correcting me
---
&gt;roc and dook
---
Nice

Vote to kick

The 21:9 version is cropped from the 16:9 version. In the 16:9 version the top of Kaid's hat is visible. It is cropping the top and bottom of the image to fit your 21:6 display.
---
Yeah. Its a great concept but with too many ppl
---
nah its good, ever since Apex came out i've won a LOT of games and i even got to plat (solo queued)
---
I know its great but its too many ppl for me
---
They can't complain there never even been a female Navy seal yet we have valk

Knowing roughly where is enough for some Ops like Fuze, Lion will dig him out and so will Dokkaebi, it’s not enough imo to give Vigil viability but I do see what you mean at higher level play, perhaps he needs a buff not a rework
---
Happy microphone day!
---
A clan of 15/16 year olds were giving me shit the entire ranked match. I'd been doing pretty well, despite their best efforts to fuck me off. 
---
Match Point, all but one of them dies. I pull out an Ace and they start showing me some goddam respect.
---
Me and the last of the little fucks went to the defuser, he started defusing while I cooked a frag. I calmly say never to fuck with a random again. 
---
We blow up and I laugh.
---
Of course it's Buck
---
From what I've heard, the accents are fucking atrocious as well
---
Kix is the true lord
---
Probably the Tuesday after invitationals
---
This needs to be its own Siege map!
---
Guess a pink spiderweb wouldve been too similar to jager eh
---
I just searched what it meant, and it seems to be the case.
---
You don’t want the same effective sens tho
---
*apex legends lol
---
lets add zombies next
---
I prefer the M249 due to its recoil pattern, in my experience it's usually better at long-mid range. Mostly just personal preference though.
---
Fuze and Lion are only 2 ops out of the 22. There is a higher probablity of the tram consisting of other ops than Fuze, Lion and other sets. Yes, you can find him with Dokkaebi, but only if you sound whore the fuck out of the room. 
---
Michael KiXSTAr Stockley. 
---
What the fuck did we do to deserve such a God?

He’s just asking if it’s because he missed a season or if it’s because he plays with randoms.

should be tuesday, then 2 weeks after that should be on the main game

Jackal too

this pic is when the event started early friday morning, and the tickets are for passes for the whole weekend.  The VIP tickets, which seem somewhat empty there, most of those guys aren't there yet, and will be there for the weekend.  Also the content creators that'll be there watching, aren't doing their bits until the weekend as well.
---
I do not know comrade, but what I do know is that he is our destined saviour 
---
Happen to know off hand if it can be done on the Reddit is fun app?
---
Only if you shoot out the drywall
---
Hmmm not enough shit game design, bugs, glitches and exploits. 
---
Could this be the fabled real life?
---
Grakata? 
---
If you have an Ethernet core try that. I am in no means an expert but I think your download upload speed is slow which leads to packet loss which makes you rubber band so I would suggest going on a Speedtest and telling me what your upload and download is. 
---
what editing software do you use? This looks amazing.
---
Fortnite still beats apex imo. Siege still my fav game tho
---
Are there FHD resolutions of them? I need these for my desktop wallpaper!
---
probably lol but they are actually hand warmers
---
Is that, ACOG ON ASH???
---
now that right there is some serious heresy 
---
Katowice is seeing a peak of 600+K viewers. This is kinda sad
---
For a second I thought it was a dude about to kiss his gf
---
RIP to that lost candy (and to the guy who has to sweep the venue after.)

Oh no, you have to scroll a bit more, the travesty!
---
Exactly. I didn't even bother contacting support because I knew they was gonna inform me with bs. I just want to help everybody that have the same problem as me

I love this editing style so much.

What's the awesome game you're talking about?
