that green arrow is initial crosshair location, everywhere the colours are is a potential for the follow up shot to be placed
---
---
---
Makes sense why I couldn’t play lol
---
Would you rather waste a few min and keep MMR or waste a whole game with a great chance for a loss?
---
Who gets to site faster? Amaru or Ash. The ultimate question about this season.
---
[removed]
---
Oh yes, it drops tomorrow.
---
echo and montagne are way too low
---
Sometime in order to save a life you have to take a life
---
Why’d Ela better then echo??

So how this reads is that the shots will be heavy on the right since the "colored lines" go further and further over the center line that the green arrow is on?
---
Probably not, considering you had to pay for the packs and be lucky
---
It's messed up how Comcast is always on the enemy team.
---
you’re flair and it’s presence of jackal. what i learn from dying and losing to jackal is just to ban him every time
---
May I ask why you put echo where he is I thought he was one of the best especially on bomb.
---
They scrapped that entirely
---
Gridlock is op and she can crush your head with her thighs win win imo
---
Why do they keep taking naps out of casual??
---
Just remember, your enemies probably hate being there as much as you do.  If you murder someone in the same room more than once, call them out and declare it "Your Room".  If you kill them there again they'll tilt, if they call you out on it back congrats you're still in their head.
---
You can get some pretty funny rivalries/stories going in the chat to help pass the map.
---
thanks you surpassed my expecTations
---
That happened to me
---
Yea mines is down
---
That's all I needed to know, gridlock it is.
---
I like Nøkk over Girdlock
---
I respect this brother. Thank you!
---
Yeet
---
DDOSing definitely does happen quite a bit on console, it's very obvious when it's a ddos, everythings fine during the prep phase, if you're attacking they'll stress the server when you spawn so you can't move and run out of time, on defence they only stress it right before/after they enter site and get a plant off then you can't defuse so you lose.
---
I've had it happen to me 4 times in the last 2 weeks and I'm only high gold/low plat, I've heard it's a lot worse at high ranks.
---
Anytime soldier
---
Still happens way more than any reasonable person should expect from a £60 game made by a triple A developer with millions
---
correct, to help with that you can put on the flash hider, or if you want a mix of both helping vertical and horizontal recoil use the compensater
---
He's not a fucking hacker, he has a twitch channel and everything.
---
Huh? I’m not making a point there I’m just saying I don’t like acog and I wish they didn’t have to be in siege but they do
---
Breh have you seen the goyo and kapkan combo
---
They didn’t give a time. Just checked the website and saw it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2glvz/opinion_of_a_console_player_nook_and_warden_d/ezuplbd/
---
Yep.
---
I imagine it has something to do with Ela being a trademarked Ubisoft property.
---
&gt; Attackers can be straight up spawn killed at all 3 spawns
---
Ya I don't get how they haven't fixed this yet. Literally moving some of the cars around would fix this issue, plus maybe a staircase instead of a ladder at one of them. At least at the back alley spawn it should be a freebie for the attackers if a defender tries a spawn kill there because they need more time to peak the corner but alas so many people still die there.
---
And your other points are also pretty valid as well. I guess I was thinking moreso of how the map plays in pro league which none of those points play a factor for.
---
&gt; encourage stale attacker behaviour
---
This is one of the most painful things in the game. It's why I hate Glaz on Plane. Idc that he can shoot through the glass, that's easy to avoid, I care that he just sits out there for 3 minutes doing nothing most times because everyone knows now to avoid the windows.
---
And then attacker-only catwalks/balconies, skylights, etc. all cause this all the time. It's why I like that Kafe skylight is way less useful now.
---
For a game claiming openness it’s very ambiguous
---

So if it's a bold fuzzy green line going over the line it means it could go either right or left right? And when it's a fuzzy bold line or thin line what's that mean?
---
Someone is not very good
---
Don't worry, they'll be there next week.
---
Ty
---
Theres a difference between a developer working on a singular game and a developer working on many games and a difference between how long you think it takes to fix a bug compared to all of the time to even find what line of code is causing the bug or finding a solution to the bug
---
Or just baiting for the shitstorm
---
i think youd be shocked at how good she actually is
---
the more solid it is the higher chance the shot gets placed there, you'll see the DMRs have a thinner wider area
---
Lol no way
---
No I haven’t I will try, thanks.
---
When they know you have a mic because you're actively giving verbal call outs it's a bit harder to keep your mouth shut especially when they already started having some banter with you the round before the request for me to TK the dude. I knew talking trash to the guy who already has RFF on would be my safest bet keeping in mind the possibility and hope that the last dude with RFF not on in their stack wasn't too good with explosives to take out me and the downed guy out at the same time for my "treason." He seemed a bit insecure around his buddies with his extremely self deprecating sense of humor and empty laughs after each joke so I simply attacked that side of him to make him have to sit out the 3rd round and then the cherry on top with him having to watch the dude they hated so much for no legitimate reason ace the last round
---
 (I may've, just possibly, intentionally only injured and left the last two on the secure area site after I saw the 3 stack died and the other guy had 3 kills just to give him the ace)
---
Conveniently left out the part where you can practically melee him through his shield
---
... Are you sure?
---
Because spectating and killcams isn’t always accurate
---
Lol
---
Wasn't ping I had 24 ping
---
GOOD JOB...though it looks like you're 3 1/2 years late
---
Newcomer is limited to 3 maps in order to teach the player the basic gameplay. 
---
Casual is where new players learn the maps. 
---
Unranked will be to learn strats and get used to the competitive gameplay changes plus play with higher ranked friends to learn the game. 
---
Rank is simply competitive.
---
WHAT ABOUT DDOS. GG EZ EMBER RISE
---
Yup
---
Why you gotta do me like that man?
---
I love it when the other team gets greedy for that last kill. How hard is it to just play the objective
---
Bad timing in terms of release date in my opinion.
---
But why not just play recruit on your own account??
---
*captain america sits down on backwards chair*

---
So, you want to main Maverick...
---
yeah an attachment doesn’t make one gun better than another. R4 is statistically better

---
If you hadn’t already heard. They officially stated today, that it’s coming out the 11th.
---
There was a siege twitch rivals even today aswell that could’ve been part aswell
---
You're reading way too much into this
---
Can maverick shoot thru a reinforced wall side to side like I did? No, that's my answer
---
console maintenance
---
Is it really the best time to release this.
---
@Ubisoft  Use your fucking brains...
---
 Nice. Do you know if it works on console too or just PC?
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Embers rise on September 11th in the morning huh...
---
I’m just trying to determine the meta.
---
and i OOP-
---
Different fan sorry about that it's hot as hell in my room and no ac
---
I’m at 90-95
---
What’s your ADS?
---
If it was a common/serious enough crash there’s a good chance that’s it. Close to the planned release date (today) the crash was still present, they found out what was causing it and fixed it, and pushed the fix to TTS — but that took a bit too long to get it all out today. Rather than patch again tomorrow to apply the fix and have patch day one have the crash too, they just delayed everything until they could confirm on TTS the fix was working.
---
'We were this close to greatness'
---
Serious question, why do devs always stager release times between platforms?
---
Then people will just pull their Ethernet cable out instead of backing out.
---
Dude ik your pain I have two fans in my room and it’s still hot
---
Find what works best for you
---
Time to raid it
---
It isnt actually that hard to get uo there... Just watch Coconut Brah
---
well if they do all that then that’s extra as shit, but people who get booted by ddosers should have no penalty, nor people who get booted by their internet or maybe a power outage
---
My sensitivity is
---
Vertical 50
---
Horizontal 100
---
Both deadzone 5%
---
ADS: 50
---
lmao
---
If only that knife didnt work like it normally does...
---
What the hell is wrong with the charging handle on that?
---
ok u/IAmNot_ARussianBot
---
I personally play 75/75 with a 11/11 stick deadzone (also on Xbox one), I find it to be very good but not too much sens, but just run with the sens for a while before making the desition, even if you seem like a bot at times, it just takes getting used to, also change in small amounts, dont go from 30 to 80, try 30 to 35 to 45 to 50 etc.
---
Right? I was surprised the headshots worked to be honest lol
---
Fuck Clash.
---
I USED TO DEAL DRUGS
---
Who can?
---
this reads like a bad knock knock joke. Ela? Dokk Dokk? Whos there? Doc.
---
Bro they're getting banned constantly. I lost two games yesterday to cheaters- and upon logging in today I got all my elo back from both games.
---
It’s not that extra, people used to turn their consoles off, pull their Ethernet cable, etc. all the time to avoid losses and shit. That’s why no game ever differentiates anymore and hasn’t for a really long time. 
---
But yeah, this is why I’m always a little hesitant to get on board with wanting harsher abandon penalties. I’ve had stretches where Comcast fucks me over frequently and sure it’s easy to say “don’t play ranked if you have such bad internet problems!!!111!!” but when you’re the one having problems it’s already frustrating enough without going and abandoning a game you like because of it. It’s tough to get strict on abandoning without catching others in the crossfire who are already having enough issues as is.
---
Wait till the rest of your team leaves site, forcing you to stay on site
---
Retarded opinion*
---
Is this a console thing, or am I lucky? Because I haven't experienced any ddosing on pc
---
Wish I took advantage of that event. I wasn’t that interested in the game at the time.
---
Task failed successfully
---
Lemme guess. Tk?

Nice, one day I got 111111 ahhh satisfied
---
I know the spot I'll make a video ....

You ever look at these kind of cameras and just have such a strong urge to shoot it

It’s an iOS problem, I believe. It’s happening to me on multiple different websites. Not just Ubi’s.

Yo are you playing r6 in german

The only 2 things that amaru needs are grapple to balconys and railings and when she grapples to a window, the window breaks when she reaches it not before she starts moving

I love Fortress and hate to see it go. Hereford, however, is abysmally bad.
---
no it's not capped at 60fps....
---
D a m n .
---
That's some quality strafe console aim right there.
---
Thatcher missed the whole clip. Guy said something about it in the clip if u listen. Didn’t even realize it till after.
---
"Listen to the player ubisoft" - Says the player that cant spend 5s reading the patch notes before they start complaining about things that arnt even in the game. 
---
House isnt getting removed from the game. They are adding a map rotation into the casual map pool where each month they'll remove 1 map and add another. 
---
The Data limits are in regards to the game engine not the servers. So please stop repeating this jUsT BuY mOrE sErVers statements.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
That's exactly what I was thinking. I figured having the detonation responsibility being contextual would be the way to go. But with this explanation it would make Goyo responsible for Attackers detonating his shield to kill the hostage.
---
IKR! I never play ranked coz of people who don’t try dropping me to silver. Then I get ton of hate for being a high level I’m casual
---
Maybe something like tower is on fire. Also, operators can’t repel, they have to just jump.
---
find someone on cams and place a claymore behind em
---
The hatch is a sacred rabbit hole to the outside world
---
He’s with us all we just don’t know
---
Remember when this is a video game where bullets are shot from the top of your head.
---
Perspective issues are a real thing in r6s, especially when repelling upside down on windows. His original video was about the changes done to the POV after the Q/E spam fix.
---
I fucking love minimalist art. Thank you.
---
Why you should throw smoke around the defuser instead of directly over it
---
Why do people use angle grip when they cant control the recoil
---
Just because it doesn't have cargo shorts? I love his elite.
---
I'm just saying that most people that just start playing will be bellow average, therefore should be placed in a lower rank rather than gold.
---
I really appreciate the offer but, I've never played that game and dont own it..
---
And I’m out here, level 166, getting duplicates for calico jack and shock rock
---
That mode is single-handedly saving my team, my friends play this game but not competitively yet cause they are not comfortable with the maps, unranked is giving us a chance to work on map knowledge and practice strats
---
Casual level 200's just drop in skill after level 170  
---
That or he's just having a bad time.  
---
Oh and I wish I could get started on the platform.
---
Asking the real questions. Curious since it's streamed.
---
We let him live this time, but he knows to never make the mistake again lol
---
I would never plagiarize.
---
congratulations!
---
Nah
---
Far from OP.
---
The game is better without them. Casual included.
---
May I ask what is your rank
---
No, you may not.
---
Well there it is man. You use racial slurs, you don’t deserve an account, period. Hope you can be better with your next account.
---
and also you dont want to be destroyed by plats and diamonds trying to get their ranks back
---
You are a disgrace to us doc mains
---
Not surprised people like you are here
---
Battle pass is just cosmetic, there’s nothing bold about it
---
Finally a iPhone with built-in EMP!
---
Agree
---
I’m not disagreeing, I’ve just been using it myself and have been surprised, it’s not great but definitely got some blood on it
---
You realize Ubisoft isn't an American company, right? And the game has players who aren't American? Why the fuck should we cross out an entire day because something happened in one city 18 years ago?
---
Laughs in Australian.
---
In which country do you live ?
---
Yeah I totally agree, it's definitely surprising at times.
---
Holy shit this drops on my B-Day
---
ahh youre friends with that thicc thanos guy
---
They haven't done that until recently, and once I found out I mostly stopped, however ubisoft support said I have been flagged for past seasons as well. Still, even with those reviews, I still feel like a perma ban is too much. Especially when you get suspensions for tking, or abandoning, or throwing, those are much worse than simply calling someone a bi\*\*h,  or even a ni\*\*er, that actually ruins other player's gameplay experience. I have seen so many people in ranked matches botting, tking, destroying gadgets, etc. in lower ranks that I have been dragged into, either by smurfs bots, or throwers.
---
Tomorrows ur Birthday too? AYYYY

Lol I'm sorry for your pain

Just report for harassment and move on

Jackal on offense and Eco on defense

It looks like aimbot, the enemy must have been furious. 😉
---
Ever since I started playing PC they've given me warning. So I wouldn't say recently.
---
ok sorry but like smg-12 doesnt count for challenges because its not an smg and yeah its literally in the name “**smg**-*12*” but its TECHNICALLY a “*machine pistol*”

Depends if you play for wins or play for memes. Maverick can be insanely strong. Creates amazing angles enemies won’t expect. Words of advice for him. Careful torching a wall directly into obj, the description says it’s nearly inaudible, but this is not the case. That thing is very loud to someone in that room and will get you killed. Another tip is you can create holes big enough in the bottom of walls to crawl through. Memes can be fun too, you can try and torch someone to death which is very difficult. Nomad is also very strong. I’d say more memeable though. Very good at covering your ass for obvious reasons. Guns are good, and I usually run breaches with her. But her secondary. Hoo boy. Meme machine. The best sniper in the game. By far. In the end I’d say if you have a lot of experience go for nomad. If you are newer go maverick.

The slow crawl up the stairs with rook, shooting Ash's kneecaps then the impact to the crotch at the end killed me.

I was think about what if they made a default pool where all the ESL maps are in and then they give us the option to add in any other map we want

Not exactly. You have to play until House comes out randomly, then keep replaying that map

---
ok, but still    
---
lvl200 had a longer time playing siege, so he knows the maps, a lvl 50 may know one or two maps good, but not all, especially not all the angles you can hold, Siege isn't just a skill based game, map knowledge and operator knowledge factor into it aswell IMO
---
I just put the sensitivity way higher than i normally play it. Very confusing but obviously it helps me a lot! Even if my movements look very bad.
---
yeah i got a legendary charm that was just an alpha pack
---
As I twitch main, I understand. It still surprises me from time to time.
---
Then slap up some extra recoil on the aug and give it an acog.
---
I don't see what the engine has to do with matchmaking, if they have to write a couple hundred lines of code, then they should, they are getting paid for that and the game already has alot of code, or else it wouldn't be what it is now
---
Loool
---
Says the clash main lol
---
"smells like broke in here"
---
Ever since the server maintenance today I SWEAR the headshot reg has gone to shit. I was playing a few matches earlier today and it seemed fine, as it had been this season, and then after that server reset i swear it's off.
---
Out of those too definatly mira imo. She is such a solid op and her elite is sick (and i gotta agree cute too lol)
---
And my.. well I've got nothing to give but good luck anyways
---
I just dug up this clip from a few seasons ago, but this type of stuff happens a lot. Not this extreme usually
---
Either way it's easy pickings, Maverick should almost never be breaching a primary wall. It's way too risky unless the defenders are idiots and just not paying attention.
---
I play like a f*ing noob in the first 1.5 Minutes....
---
*fucking flesh lights*
---
The 20m was a random number, im not sure of the meters squared of the maps but making those 3 abilities AOE will remove a lot of the negative outlooks on these operators. You also need to consider the other play styles and players (coppers all the way to PL), not a single person in PL uses a lion off the start of a round or for no reason, so with that into account your comment is invalid. Also, if your within 20m of a lion theres not a 90% chance of you seeing him, or being killed. 20m radius is small yes, but you have to think, theres walls separating you, theres cover, theres shields, there are so many things to aid the defenders. If you are 20m away from me theres no guarantee that your going to see me or even hear me if im crouch walking. Im not sure how many hours you have in this game, but based on your comments it doesnt sound like a whole lot. But thank you for the feedback, ill get back to the drawing board with this one!
---
Just dont go playing newcomer and ruining the fun for everyone else
---
I did like 10 times
---
Cab wanted to die in your embrace.
---
I'd did like 10 times

Could've picked Ash and use the free one.
---
Who is anti suppressor?
---
Fooking androids
---
I believe alot of things, but not that you never encountered anybody higher leveled than you, I don't want to exaggerate, but it really is that way, maybe I should start taking screenshots then...
---
I see posts on this sub every now and then of people asking for a skin transfer system like in GTA, I play on console but want to move to PC but I don't want to lose all my stuff... Either that system comes or I'm not moving lol
---
What? Why kapkan?
---
Yeah :/ it's stupid af honestly.

now watch out for that drone hole.

I never said that I’ve never met higher leveled players. 
---
However, you’re talking about a 70 level difference. This clearly shows that you’re exaggerating way too much.
---
nice, next milestone is plat
---
I agree with you 100% on Jackal, that idea would be very balanced and make the person playing him decide on that. I think I misunderstood the Lion point at first, but i do see him quite a bit in plat 3/plat 2. And yes i also agree with the dokk would be a nerf to echo but wouldnt that be nice, maybe i could play him in ranked once in a while
---
Copper rank is too fun: Yet the score is 4-4 and you’re tryharding.

IMO the best way to learn the maps is to get in custom, max the round timer and pick Sledge with shotgun. Pick set spawning location, get into a room on 1st floor and start opening doors and walls noting where does the exit lead. Once you can tell every adjacency of that room you move to the next one. Once you know the entire floor from memory you move to the next one, noting adjacent room and what's above/bellow you on the floors you already know. Once you know your way around the map you run around destroying every default camera and hatch. When you've done all of that you should be familiar enough with each room you should be able to react to basic callouts, they're usually just notable items in a room.
---
And Goyo's gadget explodes.
---
And both Plane and Tower are in the first rotations.
---
It’s almost the same as the map banning. They will just ban the likes of Hereford (i know it’s removed in E.R. But if per team bana 2 or 1 map each. It will almost be most likely the same.

The devs even say themselves that they leave in some spawn peaks just so you could learn the map, learn from your mistakes, and just to make you a better player. 
---
I used to fucking rage at getting spawn peaked but honestly, with time you learn to just prefire those windows you get killed from. It's so rewarding just taking like 5 seconds, then prefiring the window and you end up getting a headshot/lighting someone up. 
---
Just take an alternate route, or five it a second or two. Prefire your windows and that'll make them back off.
---
Server side vs client side bro. It can suck!
---
if you lose a round on defence you're just defending the site poorly (if its a good sight) and so yeah, you should try again and correct your mistakes. no point picking an indefensible site tbh

Hello vWaffles, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2mw2g/was_gonna_post_this_on_rlayer_but_had_an_error/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I'm confused here. Did you just post a screenshot because the post's upvotes had the number 69 in it?

Fookin’ laser sights
---
Just by playing
---
Indy, is that you?
---
No I don't, so my dream about having giant hula hoop earrings will never come to pass :(
---
yeah give it some more recoil, and remove the acog from the handgun, the whole point is to have different kits for the same ops if that what UBI wants, otherwise nothing will make the aug competitive
---
Theyre all ugly and a waste of money. Your cousin is a hero
---
They are more useful than skins thats all I can say.
---
Doesn’t need to fry Samsung’s because they already do that
---
Ive been diamond 2 every season get on my lvl noob
---
Can we pre-load the patch before this ? Unfortunately 1am for Aus ppl on pc
---
Ping abuse isn't a thing in siege, having a higher ping puts you at a disadvantage, especially when you get peeked. Go look at Rouge 9's video on it if you don't believe me.
---
Does this sub have a finite amount of space? You cant waste something that is unlimited. And you say I didnt provide context, providing context would have meant I wanted you to take something out of the post. Which I didnt. If I had wanted you to take away that I sat here talking to a 5 stack about having fun. I could have said it. If I wanted to complain about a bug. I could have. And you're right. You're not feeling victimized, you're victimizing others. And you can agree to disagree to that. But it is what it is.
---
I mean since it says ur a thatcher main, what do you use.
---
Imagine you are bad on border, why wouldn’t you ban it every time? And if you do it, how would you learn how to play it? You will end up playing the same 3 maps over and over again. I think it very boring, every ranked (almost) map is great and should be playable imo.

It's not the peeks that disturbs it, it's those easy easy easssssy 1v1's that you know you'll just easily win that you end up losing cause these guys are stuttering on your screen
---
I stopped reading at “he’s scared to play ranked because he gets matched up against level &gt;120 ranked gold or plat in casual!”
---
Casual matchmaking is completely different from ranked matchmaking and will put you in with a wide range of players. Ranked will put you with people very close to you for the most part, of course there are smurfs and boosters but yeah...
---
One other note, the initial MMR is 2500 which is gold 4 so if your friend is new and someone who belongs in bronze or something then he’s probably gonna be in for a rough start. It’ll sort itself out fairly quickly, you gain and lose a lot of MMR at a time early in the season. The more ranked matches you play, the less you gain/lose each match.
---
This comment wasn’t about flexing or anything, i’ve been plat 2 the last 2 seasons and didn’t even mention it.
---
Only with LMG tho, no matter if all your team shoots all it’s at mags on it it won’t destroy the bars
---
NO

No

It's not that hard actually. I'm not very good player and my record is

- (started playing) Wind Bastion Gold IV
---
- Burnt Horizon Gold IV
---
- Phantom Sight Gold III
---
Hey man, it happens... a lot to be honest. Don't let it get to you. Whenever you play try to stay calm as possible.   
---
The best thing is to find mates to play. If you happen to play on SEAS or EAS, we got a nice little discord server from Mauritius for that.  
---
If not, well try online or convince a friend to play with you.   
---
Siege is cool alone, but perfect with some friends and beer :D  
---
Cheers &amp; have fun
---
Im 4099 of 4099 to plat 1 :(
---
He’s in creative mode
---
I feel you men I feel u
---
Very good point.
---
Naw fam it will be cheaper to buy the ultimate version of the game I have looked into it
---
He/she will get everything which was included in the beggining as well as all Y4 ops. The only thing not avaiable is the weapon skin which is shit anyway.
---
Wait so if I buy the year passes do I automatically get the operators FOR EVER and won’t have to buy them again?
---
Wait , the candela can go through a soft barrier? This is new information to me lmao
---
Honestly if it gets me out of playing shit maps like fortress, house, plane, yacht, favela, etc then I’m down.
---
Yes
---
Hey man, whatever it takes to save the ace
---
My dads nintendo
---
Suicide is badass!
---
Does less damage per pellet than pretty much every shotgun. Has a high recoil pattern. In comparison to the scorpion which doesn't even have a pattern it's amazing though. It also does one of the lowest damage numbers for shotguns at both cqc and long ranges even whilst equipped with the extended barrel.. its not the best gun in game,  it's a very good one but not the best. Especially since Ela is one of the worst operators in her current state.
---
He's too advanced
---
I have my focus on the renown and alpha pack boosts. For the OPS, he doesn’t get them does he? He can play them the first week and buy them for a discounted price.
---
Even if he already has the game?
---
The 2 second delay between him throwing the c4 and detonating it absolutely killed me XD
---
He will get the y4 ops
---
Yeah on android but its beta only but I just took an apk of some dodgy website to get it.
---
Ok thanks, as I said I’m new to this and I am what you would consider a MASSIVE NOOB
---
Very impressive!
---
When have they become free for PASS owners?
---
For those time, is that when maintenance begins or when the update will be available for download?
---
Buying the ultimate edition as said will be cheaper and yes you will have the ops forever with that
---
 platform are you on?
---
Do you have to pay for it?
---
Also, is it like a download on the computer? Because my school’s computer have downloads blocked
---
But there are a lot more ops and if you want to get good you need the master most of them. If you ban maps you could just play on 3 and never have to worry about the others
---
If you're using ACOG and trying to fight up close, it just will be more difficult. Try different sights and / or sensitivities?
---
Because it makes it more fun ;)
---
You mean my comment got ripped off...
---
If you don't have all the vanilla operators, play and buy them with renown
---
I get the same when i don't play it for a while. I find that after a while i just get used to it again and it stops. How long have you been playing PC siege for. It might just be the case that haven't got used to it yet.
---
Test it
---
Noice
---
Wait i forgot to mention that I got the version that came with the all year 1 operators
---
So you tell me that they get the s4 ops for free?
---
So you want to vote to kick? The vote to kick system?

honestly i just did it so if i didnt get the last kill i still got a 5k
---
Yes. https://imgur.com/a/bxJ3lnU
---
The main reason is because I’m a lazy f***
---
It can also be to help with bandit tricking. Makes it a lot easier to hear a thermite putting a charge down if you make a hole in the wall before reinforcing.
---
Oh ok
---
Didn’t know that, might consider buying it. Renown alpha pck boost until 31 january. Plus the new ops, worth it also for 600 credits included.
---
you are not playing... it's just the menu
---
Nice charm what is it’s name
---
You know it's coming out in an hour or so
---
I have all past operators ^_^
---
I don't suggest to hipfire unless at extremely close range where yoou can also knife, what is more effective
---
really bad because of how important yours and others sounds are
---
this my friend was a joke, meant for casual matches.
---
yup, 50% increase of ADS from .400ms to .600ms
---
yup 5-stack is the ranked meta
---
“My secret weapon to kill him is finally ready!” *Dies

I run a suppressed spas-15 with that same reasoning

---
Ok, then it doesn't matter what you do bu i think knife kill are more satisfying
---
Wouldn't it feel good though?
---
I gonna try
---
After playing a lot of ranked, going to casual is so much fun. People there are, not the best and it reminds me that I’m actually not as bad as ranked makes me feel sometimes.
---
Plat 2, first season hitting it
---
I don’t stink a heavy metal object is gonna feel good
---
I thought that all the Base operators and attachments are automatically unlocked from start now?
---
Hello Kubaja123, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2ovz8/blackbeard_wonderful_shield_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Nice, that was actually pretty good
---
I mean other than a non original op the black ice isn’t really that cool looking. It’s just a slightly more detailed version of ice.
---
Ive used it for like the last two seasons. Its really helpful if you have a strong enemy gunner in the bathroom. But you should only use it once a match or you'll get prefired easiely.
---
Just wait till he releases his power upon you mortals
---
See i am toxic but fair. Ash is just toxic lol
---
I too enjoy Fortress for ranked. However, the new ranked format doesn't do it justice. 3 attack/3 defend isn't a bad idea but not for first to 4. Should be first to 5. Or just go back to switching every other.
---
I think she would benefit more if she doesn't break the window the moment she fires her grappling hook. 
---
Making it not break the window and maybe reducing the noise by little would make her able to use it bit more safely in general I feel like.
---
Thank you. Im happy you like it.
---
Why do people on this sub like black ice so much? It looks retarded.
---
No, i don't think that you will
---
I figured the lesion wouldve seen the claymore at least
---
I’m sick of the stress with playing competitive, I’ve been playing casual on Secure Area only for the past little while and it’s a lot of fun messing around with strats that usually wouldn’t work in a more competitive environment, plus the rare games of recruit vs recruit and knives only or whatever.
---
Eh,I guess
---
Damn why is everyone hating its just a joke bois
---
What changes?
---
Silver 3, probably shouldn't be proud of it but I am.
---
Compensator only helps with horizontal recoil and reducing the overall diamond of the recoil after 5 shots. It doesn't affect vertical recoil.
---
I mean go look at ice and then black ice. It’s the same thing but with with a black fade instead of the blue/white
---
One on the right made me think of Dale Gribble from King of the Hill.
---
how much longer is the season?
---
I agree with you, the level cap for ranked should be at least 50
---
Bro, I know that it had some benefits but nobody is using it correctly nowadays, yes it’s useful against cheaters and toxic ply but the majority of R6 players are using in a wrong way
---
Nah, it just kinda looks smaller. Been watching king george a lot and his reticle looks smaller as well
---
This is promotional material from years ago back during "black ice" for the pro league skins. It's official art by Ubisoft and predated the introduction of the angled grip which happened 2 seasons later.
---
New season begins today 11.00 edt time
---
i need answers and some irrelevant faggot downvotes
---
Gold 2, maybe get to plat next season
---
My pleasure.
---
Eh, kinda weird dude.
---
Most of the time Finka doesn’t react fast enough to save people. Also don’t go for the knife just shoot to kill
---
That's why Unranked exists. I'll chill in there for a little bit and let the mob of sweats battle it out.
---
Same. Should be out
---
Vaulting over it wont trigger it however if you try to walk on it.. boom!
---
"I am a tactical genius"
---
\*explosion goes off\*

"Oh no!"

Maybe add tinted glass in the eye peeks

they don't have collision with the player now so rip forever

https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1171772764702806021?s=09
---
Not actually downloadable for an hour.
---
no, but if a defender shoots it whilst the attacker is mid-vault, the attacker is pretty much dead
---
Either keep offline or make the party invite only and ignore his requests to play honestly, tell your other friends your tired of playing with him because of how he acts. He’s a high rank because of you carrying but he shows no interests in getting better.
---
Ok i see. Thx mates
---
No. The trial pass launches during season three.
---
Please give me back all the maps Ubi.
---
I never even played a multiplayer match on Old Hereford or Barrelet.
---
Holy!!
---
I'm pretty sure that's the stock picture they used to promote the gemstone skins, but the shotgun was photoshopped in where the AR33 would usually be. You can even see the right hand looks like it's around a pistol grip which the m590 doesn't have.
---
But they’re so big!!
---
There is a meme (from a porn) where there are 4 big African Americans surrounding this one teeny white chick. In his flair, he has four castles (who are black) and an IQ (who is white and small). I’m pretty sure you’ve seen it before
---
play unranked 😉
---
Honestly one of the first ifeas ive seen on here in a while that would help with gameplay. But then fuze could become unusable on certain maps
---
&gt; it will be good for anyone playing casual to not have to learn irrelevant maps.
---
If you're like me and don't give a shit about Ranked and only play Casual, then none of the map are irrelevant.
---
Not for an hour yet
---
Wait till he uses 5% brain power
---
Tysm👍🏻
---
Why they said that hour if they now that wouldn't be before maintenance has completed ? Ubisoft sucks.
---
No comment...
---
Im on ps4
---
Not with 4 bomb sites available to be played, adapting is not just switching site, its trying a different way and different things to defend a specific site you like or prefer
---
What may the chances be?
---
About time
---
Np I'm happy to help.👍
---
Not yet
---
I bought some tinted
---
i mean its the same stuff as ranked but you wont be worrying about losing elo just yet
---
No. I know for certain. I was there when they released this...
---
I do agree with the amount of unranked games that must be played before going into ranked. I think there should be like 10 or 20 games required in unranked before you are ever allowed to hop into ranked. And I also think that should reset every season, so that the beginning of the season isnt a cesspool of people all trying to get their ranks all at once.
---
21:30 IST for pc.
---
Definitely Goyo. Amaru's grappling hook is way too loud,slow, and obvious. Just camp the window she's at and *pop*
---
play unranked with him whenever he's on
---
Approximately 46 minutes
---
God this would be such a great change and would make the game more fun when you have more than 5 friends online
---
Yeah, me too. 2 (UK) is just when maintenance starts. That takes about an hour. Then the update is actually able to download after. They tweeted it.
---
Whatever you do, do not make up some story why you cant play with him. That's gonna hurt the friendship eventually.
---
Honesty should always be the answer i guess. If he is a good dude he will understand. My friends ditched me last year because im just a low gold player and they were plats trying to make it to diamond. It was not fun when they said they wanted someone else on their team, but I understood I wasn't on their level. We are still great friends outside gaming (maybe even better because i know they are honest).
---
This shouldn't be the solution of this gamebraking problem... Looking away to not see the shit... This is wrong imo.
---
New season begins 11.00 edt time so about 2 hours from now
---
Seriously, does the OP really feel like that run in the beginning provided any useful context?
---
On console too lmao insane
---
Ok. Its 4 where i live.
---
Yes,but it depends on. If you fall on top of a deployable shield,they break meaning the vulcan shield would also break and cause the explosion and fire. 
---
Regular vaulting over the shield at the front or backside won't destroy the shield tho.
---
Ah yes that one. I get it now.
---
oh, oh no.
---
Well guess Hookah is becoming an even better bombsite now, hopefully my teammates will stop going penthouse now. ^(no? okay.)
---
Didn't help much in higher elos either. I'm consistently high plat 2 to mid plat 1, but I always struggle to get diamond. I've gotten it twice now, but the boosters make it so difficult. That one low rank player in their squad makes my elo gain much lower than it should be on a win and much more drastic on a loss. Thank God ubi finally did something about it.
---
But it technically throws them sideways so fuze would have to have a giant anal cavity for fitting around 5 hockeypucks AND the expanding drill bit inside him... Just saying.
---
Ill do you one better; how are the chances
---
What is the probability for said chance to be?
---
Guys we need to wait for maintenance to finish around 10 before we download. Idk why they didn't say it starts at 10 to begin with.
---
i know i know man, I was diamond this season and i guarantee every 2/5 games were ddosed. It fucking sucks but i still like playing the game so sticking to unranked till everything settles is the best bet
---
Fair. Basically the update isn't actually downloadable until an hour after they said. Pretty annoying that they didn't account for maintenance in the announcement.
---
Like brand spanking new unranked I'm not sure. I think the 1,000elo difference kicks in once you're ranked, not prior dont quote me tho
---
I don’t have a reason to play ranked yet. Ima just troll in cas w Amaru.
---
Common knowledge but ok
---
Is the update out for anyone
---
my friend literally does the same exact thing. i always tell him that he should practice on his own but he refuses. the learning curve for this game is REALLY steep, but it’s so fun once you get good at it
---
Maybe that’s what I’ll do. Just be honest with him. Thing is though I have had moments when playing with him that have been really fun and like playing with him. Just want him to practise more.
---
I know ok im just hyped
---
I love this game either and I was diamond every season I played untill this ddos shit haunted the game...
---
I hate that so much. I tried killing a doc once with a revolver and the low ammo/long reload screws you over if any hit the I-frames
---
Only good thing was the soundtrack
---
not a word about ddos on console, I wish I didn't like this game so much so I could just quit...
---
Personally not a fan of using showgun on Attacker. I have better chance going for headshots in mid ranges while Deagle work pretty well in close distance fights. 
---
If Nokk can actually sneak up on someone better than she does now (please make her 3 Speed), maybe I'd consider it more.
---
She shines when she needs a quick entrance where they arent, but can get to if they hear it. Basically gets inside faster then they can get there. That and hatches. Other then that, doesnt do much
---
yes sir !
---
RussianBadger
---
Ok.
---
If he's your best friend you should be able to just speak to him and explain your frustration 
---
I have a friend who frustrates me sometimes, I explain to him the problems I have. He spends too much time setting up during the prep phase, even with someone who should have a quick set up time, he needs to branch out more instead of constantly playing as comfort picks like lesion, he needs to give better call outs and shouldn't panic when he gets in a gunfight 
---
I've explained all of this to him and he understands and agrees, he's improved over time. Whenever we're done playing siege and the game is off we're still friends and the game hasn't negatively effected our friendship at all, like I say if he's your best friend you should be able to explain your frustrations to him without causing any conflicts, as long as neither of you take it personally and realise it's just a game
---
That's the objective my guy
---
yeah man and when you're winning they also crash the server, its fucked
---
If you looking for creative gameplay Macie Jay for sure. If you looking for just insane aim go for Beulo or Godly.
---
Is the shitty vc bug fixed? I can see my mic in the top right but no one can hear me.
---
i´ll tell you a little secret: servers are already down on ps4 but pls dont tell anyone else ok?
---
TheRussianBadger
---
There is a new type of game coming, it sits between casual and ranked. Maybe try that with him?
---
Did you ignore the pinned post and social media announcements yesterday?
---
Get Flanked... He really dives into the game from a lot of aspects... Not just about crazy kills or funny stuff etc...
---
SAS Operator Dale Gribble looks great!
---
Easier to not understand
---
There are nøkk mains...
---
THE SUPER RELAX BOYS
---
Try the store tab inside of the game itself. It should be in the digital content section.
---
i honestly thought he was on pc
---
Clips or it didnt happen
---
Nah, I'm not going commit a crime due to win a match in an online game.
---
I hope so as well
---
It will be released when Ubisoft feels like it.
---
I mean they fired a single bullet, so yes
---
It'll be activated on a later date or time for sure. Just gotta be patient :)
---
No worries map came out of rotation today
---
I agree, the editing is way too much. Would be better if it was just plain ole gameplay.
---
I know right lol, i thought he was a teamate and i was like.....who the hell is peeking my angle, and there he was lol
---
"No, you may not."= below gold
---
Operation grim sky recoil overhaul was pretty major I guess
---
Not to brag but I have the SMG-11😏
---
Varsity and Get Flanked if you’re trying to learn how to get better. 
---
Beaulo and King George if you just wanna see highlights
---
It shouldnt be for as long as you want, something like mavericks charges for it. Has a time limit/usage limit and if you use it up that is the charge (-1 charge)
---
The pilot program skins? You can find them under "Bundles".
---
Nice
---
The pistol speed buff has nothing to do with the mobility stat
---
I can see the old ones (mozzie ash....)but not the new ones
---
Yeah, basically I started to play at the last season of Skull Rain
---
Kinda
---
Good ridden
---
Is the new season out yet?
---
Otherwise, the 4 pro league gold sets should be out in a week, IIRC.
---
You have to stay near her holograms, wait for the enemy to shoot them and get spotted and immediately and aggressively push them as they are being spotted. 
---
Basically you have to player like a reverse Jackal.
---
Hold onto at least one Prisma for AFTER you have been droned. It will totally throw off an enemy who drones you out, thinks he knows where you are but instead you throw down a Prisma and change your location.
---
this was a Gold game, the thing that gets me, he just meleed the barbed wire before the frost mat o.O
---
Think so
---
I do that sometimes, for me it depends on map
---
yeah that's reasonable but i think it needs a good 15 second duration at least.
---
Thanks mate, I spent a lot of effort and time (and renowns) forthese camos
---
To bad thermite aint there to help, he knows everything about big holes coming up.
---
&gt;This game is ultimately competitive at its core (team vs team),
---
you can say the same with CSGO as well and yet people just play what they want because they can they can play hostage, gun game, wing man, heck even BR, and at least custom games modes on the most uncompetitive maps in the game an
---
. Valve lets them because there players even a minority want to play different maps
---
Frost loses her barbed wire??!?!?!?!? Whyyyyyy
---
The best way to get better with an operator really is just playing him often, there is a thing I would really recommend you to do with Alibi:
---
Volumetric displays always show a default skin Alibi with an unmodified Mx4 Storm SMG in standing position. So, if you want to trick enemies a bit better:
---
* Take the default skin for Alibi.
---
* Take the Mx4 for Alibi.
---
Blackbeard just shit himself.
---
Can you check?
---
ah right, but she cant electrify surfaces tho can she.
---
Usually two weeks after season release.
---
What rank are u
---
I'm not home rn
---
Bartlet is a terrible map that wasn't made for regular play in the first place. It's not "Sweats" that don't like it, it's anyone who can see how awful it is.
---
[this](https://i.redd.it/gaw56hlqzdaz.png)
---
Honestly mate I'm still in awe!
---
Well that is the most effective way I found of playing her.
---
Ah, i couldn’t remember, thanks much for the correction
---
Lol this actually a terrible idea. Especially for the people that paid money for black ice skin in Y1S1. Keep it the OG ops only.
---
Credit to original artist: u/menaria
---
Y r u so unfunny
---
Mature, seriously tho, the hardcore players are leaving
---
Remove her eyes, nose and ears for balance reasons though.
---
Is it really not in the update lol
---
7
---
You mad talented, a Mute/Blackbeard one is buy for sure
---
I usually run Mx4 (Reflex, vertical, compensator) cus its harder to notice at long range which is usually prisma engagement distance, and the Keratos
---
Assume as you please.
---
Every time I play plane I always think that the reinforcements are unnecessarily small
---
R/punpolice Freeze
---
Tachanka is the most oppressed operator smh 😔
---
thanks! i will have to try this
---
Saying things that you don't like about the game is completely different from it being UNPLAYABLE. My man I got ddossed in casual when I couldn't be bothered playing fucking ranked. So yeah, the game is absolutely shit. I have a clip of that if you don't believe me
---
Wtf
---
And Kafe rework, which was quite good actually
---
Fruit salad yumi yumi
---
One operator should not be doing the job of 3, something like this will never be in the game for that reason. Having Tazer makes the other mentioned operators almost obsolete
---
Nah that's too weak. We lacking in some goooos here.
---
Anybody who even sees blitz gets Gu'd.
---
Jager, Twitch, and Maestro needs a nerf to their weapons   People pick these operators because of their strong weapons and I don't think that's fair to other operators.
---
I am playing on Console/Xbox and have refreshed it multiple times and it still says there are no updates and when I load the game the servers are down, which makes sense since I don’t have the update
---
They don't advertise Warden and Nokk my Friend, They advertise the Ember Rise operators as you can clearly see because of the timer.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The default Operator showcase is the latest operators from previous season it seems.
---
Care to explain what's wrong? unless I am missing something here, everything seems fine, they said extra bullets, aka the reserve ammo, not the one in the mag.
---
Ayy monty main, i used to be one
---
It has a hidden mmr so its probably like casual
---
Any time i hear "Well hello there" i think of the foppish voice from mordhau
---
^this
---
Literally all of 3rd floor is called Attic except for objectives
---
I saw this on youtube, this is the base image for all shadows in the main menu

If you go to jager and look at the reflection in his helmet, you can see the garage

---
Can someone tell me if the UNranked playlist affects you k/d and w/l thank you
---
Same here
---
Hey now, I didn't say it was a lot. 1% is still more than most other game subs have.
---
I feel both these comments
---
aaaaah. I'm an idiot. Completely missunderstood
---
Lmao
---
Eh. Amaru isn’t that strong from my TTS experience. But Goyo is going to be a staple this season and in future.
---
Idk but they got smacked. I was plat 2 at the time
---
What happens if an attacker throws the hostage into fire purposefully though. That's so broken
---
If you dont have year 4 pass, you will get The operators in 1 week
---
Attic is just an easy win for defenders unless attackers push with brute force overwhelming defenders

---
Do you have the season pass?
---
Ah, thanks for clarifying so quickly
---
Leave me alone on Reddit U already talk so much shit on PS4
---
Oi but why is that paper so reflective?
---
Lmao I’ll do you one better how about only Hereford and Tower+theme park 
---
Make them really regret those team kills
---
Did you changed muliplier before?
---
Well boys we did it team killing is no more
---
What's the other 5% though
---
well they did ruin thermite... he looks like clay
---
I guess I wrong then. But still I'm done with this until they fix it and I am almost positive I'm not the only one.
---
Ah ok. Man was looking forward to that. Thank you guys for informing me
---
No.

Yeah, im dumb. To be fair with how it's worded it could mean 100 to mag, since 50 is also a low ammo count for LMG's compared to LMG-E or the SAW
---
Oh yeah, I remember that, I got my xbox for christmas that year, and my dad couldn't make my profile, so he troubleshooted while watching the news because he was on rescue at time, when he found out that Microsoft and Sony servers got fucked, im glad those assholes got jail time
---
not even cheating like smurfs and boosters I hit gold three-time grim sky chimera and white noise but phantom sight I was stuck in silver  because of clans or alts like I get Ubisoft can't do anything but it is frustrating to be with silver teammates going against Dimond or plat players and now I am being carried outta sliver by my plat friends and i don't like that

Worst season i ever played (joined with Velvet Shell).

Good riddance!

No one has banned them in my first 2 games

Ik, i just WANTED TO MAKE MY PROFILE ON XBOX

As a Mira main, I approve this message.

Hes never dead. He ascended the realm of memes. And hes not shit you just gotta know how to play him.
---
yeah you're right. I misunderstood.
---
Yeah, I worded that kinda poorly. I like the changes made to the theme for Ember Rise, rather. Velvet shell was awesome! Definitely a stand out
---
I'm on console with Ethernet and ipv4. I tried to use DMZ.
---
What do you mean people on console dont know how to play against her, she can rush really quickly and ok weapons
---
This is not new. I’ve had this for like 2 months lol
---
Like I say, there may not even be a fix.
---
I know what they do. I never said I didn’t
---
Why do you think I said compensator wasn’t always the best choice?
---
Imo the operator showcase isn't that good. It looks like a low quality greenscreen
---
Console has massively reduced recoil as controlling pc recoil with a joystick would be impossible.
---
They didn't dare ban tachanka
---
I was going off of what I’ve seen I didn’t get to play the tts good to know though

Thank goodness I'm not the only one.

Are the operators coming out later? Did I miss something?

It's because you got on the edge of the roof. When you do the half fall thing on roof edges it slide you down the edge then throws you at the ground insanely fast

I think Buck would be my second pick after Monty
---
I mean. It’s not bad for late round rotations. Or for a crazy rush, if your team is already putting pressure on the def. but she’s too vulnerable once she’s in, since her guns aren’t out. So if you get heard or seen on entry, it’s guaranteed death.
---
ddos ruins everything ffs
---
I just like having a high rank icon next to my pfp as a symbol that im not as shit as I am
---
-Wayne Gretzky
---
but it made much more sense to actually show the new ops when advertising for season pass.
---
Also in my Optinnion the new OPs should be accessible by anyone but only pickable by season pass owners. as of right now when I look at the Oprtators it is too easy to forget that there are new ones.
---
I don't think it's got anything to do with being a better player or not. Night time and dark maps are one of the biggest dev targets. All of the maps being reworked and being brightened because darkness negatively affects the gameplay... like that's not my opinion alone. IT IS what they're doing. Taking some maps out. You have 14 to learn. I've been playing for ages and still played Tower like once or twice in my life. It's pure RNG anyways. So what does it matter if there's a few less maps that won't come up. FOR 1 MONTH at a time.
---
The one and only thing that makes Tachanka even *slightly* usable over another operator is the 9x19 VSN. Even then, Kapkan has it so there is absolutely no point in picking Tachanka ever. The whole "tachanka is a lord" meme was funny for like the first few times... back in 2015. Now it's just the lamest shit I've ever seen on a subreddit ever and I am completely dumbfounded as to how people think it's still funny, because it's not.
---
Yeah you dumbass can ddos

 No I wasn’t was I?

You punched a man in the balls.

Then I guess this game has lost me forever. Rip Tachanka 1 speed.
---
Year 4 pass is THIS seasons season pass. Next season or year 5 is gonna get a new one. If i know ubi right
---
I mained him for like 4 months and i have over 100 hours with him, i stopped because he is really easy to counter in lower ranks, i mainly play him in casual to bully some lower ranks and then get harassed by some copper 4’s telling me to play an actual operator
---
I thought for sure one of your teammates was going to run in your fire and die.
---
*tongue clicks* Nice
---
"Closing reddit for the day"
---
Isn't Maestro pretty powerful? Removing his shield is probably just a balance decision.
---
Oh, in that case you need to u\[date it - if your on PC , go to steam and manually update it , if your on xbox just try to launch it (restart if already open) and then let it update , same with PS4
---
Game is freezing for me after 10 - 30 mins of playing. Can't even access Task Manager, so i have to restart my PC everytime.
---
With ranked being competitive, I kinda get it. People aren’t used to them yet so banning them is easier than potentially dealing with them (especially people that can’t even own them yet)/having teammates pick them and play poorly because they don’t understand the op yet. For at least the first week your best bet would be casual to play them.
---
Yep - they need a hot fix quick
---
Yeah no.
---
My leaning seems delayed I thought it was my controller but its not
---
Even that snipe at the beginning was amazing, I hope I don't have to play against you any time soon
---
Ah you’re talking about the black n white ones I thought u meant the faze ones etc
---
Fuze over there trying his best to recreate the cerebral bore from Turok 2.
---
Wait, people still play Hostage ? :O
---
I think it’s glitched. I believe the system is supposed to allow you to select any operator to showcase, or allow you to choose a random operator.
---
I never said it was?
---
I wouldnt have it that damn bright but the 2nd source of light while minor Is a distraction for sure

Reported for toxic behavior

Got uplay+ but unable to see the new operators? Anyone else facing the same issue.

Also I can’t seem to find the new season pass nor pro league skins only old ones
---
I’m on the fence 😂
---
Theyre locked for a week unless you have the season pass.
---
It’s only on the casual playlist.
---
But damn breaching walls with the TCSG12 is so CLEAN now

Casual exists

The moment you stop playing games for fun is the moment you forgot the point of games. I’m not playing to make other people feel good about themselves. I’m playing games for my own enjoyment. If smudging brings me or others enjoyment, there’s nothing stopping you. Do it. You bought the game. You can do as you please on the game so long as it isn’t cheating.

Just bring people who destroy shields. Maybe 3 is excessive, but he definitely shouldn't go below 2. He would be a waste to only have 1 and it would just be only play him for the guns

No deployable shield would be his secondary gadget that he’d pretty much have to have (like glaz + smoke) he’d still have 3 charges.

Could hop in unranked although I haven’t played it yet and I’m guessing people are banning the shit out of Goyo and Amaru.
---
So.....Blackbeard got tk’d right?
---
Remember, no spanish

That would defeat the purpose of the ban system.

Pick something that regularly gets banned to punish them for stupid choices.

because tachanka is hot and you can't deny that

Pretty much the worst season in the game so far. Useless operators, no new weapons, only a slight map rework, launched with game breaking bugs...
---
A server issue then. It sucks but it happens in lots of games. Sometimes the coin flips your way sometimes the other.
---
You obviously dont get the fucking joke
---
Dude the quality
---
That makes no sense do you realize that? get your money worth in casuals
---
I’d stay away unless your in a try hardy 5 stack. Because today all the diamonds and plats are going to be in your lobby’s until they either go up or you go down.
---
Restart your entire console (hard restart it) and then try to force update it.If it continues email support
---
Good luck :)
---
This being with a controller was pretty crazy. Well played my guy
---
Don't remember having this in phantom sight.
---
i have been banned too and the best thing that im playing on the server with thousands of peeps and i just dont know who play with me sooo much which let ubi to ban me for 15 days for boosting
---
Understandable. Have a good day.
---
When did this start? I've never seen it before.
---
I want the entire stock.
---
ITS A DEMON
---
Probably so people don’t accidentally rip a game with no attachments after getting the new ops. I’ve done that plenty in the past
---
You do not own the season pass?
---
&gt; What you the player can do about it: Bring it to Ubisoft's Attention, cause a ruckus. 
---
This is against the sub's rules, btw, but I don't give a fuck, I agree with you. This community needs to do what Battlefield's community did and they brought EA to the table by going on blackouts, mass forum protests and straight up pressuring the developers to talk.
---
This community needs to push developers to talk by way of making several threads about this, raising it in every single interaction with them, making videos, etc. Posting stupid shit like fanart and cosplays ain't going to make this game better in any way shape or form.
---
It's time this community grew some guts and took a stand.
---
It's just you not owning the season pass
---
If You Can’t Counter a spawn peek u probably play to much casual sorry bud

I don't find it hard to hold the click in though. For me and I know it's probably because I'm used to it but I couldn't imagine having to click twice to cancel my lean if autolocks me in. Prefer to hold it.

holy crap. This is epic

Yeah, that’s the reason I’m not on unranked. Every round players are just banning both GOYO and Amaru because they can’t play without the season pass... It’s a nightmare.

Hopefully you don't get a toxic Goyo that places his shield in front of your wall while you're trying to reinforce it. Learned the hard way.
---
This was my most played season since Operation White Noise. Thanks to Ubi's surprise event Showdown (I miss it so fookin much!), it got me back into the game like the old days - playing regularly and having a blast.
---
I don’t have an exact number, but it happens frequently enough to be a problem. Instead of realizing that Volcan has an obvious problem that needs fixing, you keep acting like none of it matters anyway so what’s the point of fixing it, even though it is such an easy and obvious fix.
---
I ain't the one posting clips on reddit
---
They might as well take hostage out of the game. When I play casual I have it so it only puts me in bomb anyway.
---
To everyone
---
I dont really play alibi anymore, but idk iron scope is actually better ur right
---
Ok i'm gonna ask the real question, WHAT CHANCE DO YOU WORK FOR ?
---
Needs a pin
---
Assume they are gonna showcase the new ops for a bit
---
there is an unranked playlist now with the same rules as ranked but you don’t gain or lose mmr
---
Bingo
---
Happened to me as well.
---
Unfortunately there isn’t.
---
However,it shouldn’t be a problem for y’all.If you 5-stack together,you should all get around the same rank,so the 1000 MMR gap shouldn’t be around.
---
Cause the barb wire just made it obvious there was a mat there.  No you can at least put a shield in a hallway with a mat on the other side.  I mean they’ll still jump over it and look down and shoot it just like jumping through a window, but it’s there i guess
---
wow
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Really miss the old map. It wasn't really balanced but it sure as hell was fun as fuck.

I'm curious now too. I wonder if he shifted movement keys down to SZXC?

I heard the opposite in another post. Sigh

Same goes for the super blatant hackers in casual.....it’s actually REALLY pathetic you’re so bad you gotta use cheats to get ahead.

Taking a wild guess that he means the mini battle pass and not season pass since the season pass has been out for ages now.
---
If you got them from spins then they should come back if you restart the game
---
They took Fortress, Hereford Base, and Theme Park out of ranked map rotation. Theme Park will get reworked this season and come out in Y4S4.
---
lol yes, i would be TKed in a heartbeat :P. thank you though i will try that :)

That is true for most of the players but not 100% of people in gold have no game sense or think the game is about kills some of them simply dont have good enough aim to get higher but understand how to get there

I don’t play on pc but I imagine those ban messages are satisfying asf, nice ace btw
---
Those are the skins you get for owning the season pass, so Im guessing youll have to wait until you have access to the operators to buy the outfits
---
Guess I got l lucky/ unlucky. At least from a certain point of view
---
Lol :')
---
ok lmao that's not a big nerf at all
---
So do we have legal course of action against Ubisoft if it continues? Not being able to play a paid product because of unreasonable conditions has to have grounds for litigation no?
---
uh ok?
---
Didn’t they say pros test the ops before release now? I’d imagine we won’t get another lion if that’s the case.
---
Do you mean "Remember Ricky Spanish."? Nobody forgets Ricky Spanish.
---
I would recommend just playing unranked with him. It should be the same experience, just no MMR.

Correct. So be careful choosing it on console

don’t team kill, kill yourself and then spectate the hacker and record everything and send it to ubi

He looks like ya boi,

Hmm... well thanks for sending the link, I stand corrected. Hopefully they’ll retcon the mistake like they did with Lesion and Bandit.

Yeah i thought they were seasional skins but they are only avaible for new ops guns for now

That is horrible
---
I had a Bank match so its probably just weighted a ton more
---
dont play console siege, i only play mobile
---
The hairstyle, and the headphones, and the bandana
---
But that’s why I ban the new ops.  Why am I gonna let someone use an Op I can’t use and have an advantage over me if that Op is really good.  
---
You don’t want them banned play with 2 other people that won’t ban them, pretty simple solution

---
Winner winner chicken dinner
---
You’d probably have to change the weapons but otherwise it’s solid. (Because ubi’s stance on Israel in siege)
---
Both of them are difficult ops to play.
---
If you play them poorly,you will not live long.
---
IQ has the same LMG
---
Everyone needs to understand that this is not going to change. Ubi HAS and WILL continue to blind eye this Because they don’t know how to fix it. You can vpn a server and still get into it and stress or fry it. The best way to combat this is to STOP PLAYING THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME. BOYCOTT IT. B O Y C O T T. Stop playing. When sales go down and the fan base starts to lose momentum they’ll jump ship and do anything they can to bring it back. You have to understand ubisoft is a business. They D O N O T care about you. Or your rank. They care about your money and time spent playing their game. That’s it. Siege has been the most uninteresting and shit tier fps in the last 2 years because of all the horrendous ops and changes they make every fucking update. This game NEEDS to fucking die. If anything with the new consoles coming up, abandon this piece of shit, create a siege 2 with an entirely new engine, and just put in all the ops and maps and buy their own servers to host games. (WHICH THEY WILL N E V E R DO btw) and then continue to expand. These posts are useless. Nothing will change. This game is a piece of shit and needs to die in order for Ubisoft to realize they’re fucking it up(which they literally fucking do to every single game they release) fuck siege. Fuck Ubisoft.
---
Xbox player, haven't experienced any toxicity like such [yet]
---
And i also dont remember 'shitting on ps4 players' can u elaborate?
---
It's because the guns are available on other operators. The attachments you have on the G8A1 for IQ are initially carried over to Amaru's loadout, as with the other weapons and their respective operators.

It’s crazy how much more prevalent it’s becoming at the higher ranks. I’m usually plat 3 but play with different groups (silvers/golds to high plats/diamonds). I’ve been ddos’ed in around 20% of the matches I played where our Elo averaged near plat 1. It’s a terrible problem and needs to be fixed. 
---
Im not sure if just more people have figured out how to ddos or the less toxic people are leaving the game but Ubisoft needs to act quickly if they don’t want to lose all the higher ranked players.
---
You imply that it's impossible to have a low ttk without one shot headshots, which is patently false.

Bullshit like this clip should never happen in a competitive game.

theres is a free battle pass with 7 tiers that will release this season. next season is the full battlepass with i think 50 tiers and a premium version
---
when the new season arrive? did it came?
---
... well because you find something fun for yourself, doesn't mean you should post it on reddit
---
I'm not saying it's bad! I personally love barbwire over shields. I enjoy placing it behind me so I can't get killed from behind if I'm hiding off site.
---
Is that people getting banned?I can’t read it
---
Do you really, legitimately think that a few hours is enough time for people to be ready for two new operators in ranked? Do you not take ranked seriously or something? If you REALLY need the new operators then play casual. I’m telling you right now that a lot of people aren’t banning them for a laugh, it’s because they’re not used to them. I have the season pass and I still ban the new ops because I’m not trying to go against flaming shields and a flying lady when I’m not used to either. Relax man, test out the new ops in casual, then play ranked with ops that people want in ranked, that’s the whole point of a ban phase, don’t cry because of the ops that were voted out.
---
It's clearly not Mnk.
---
Support monty life is hard

I like this skin...
---
it should be that everything u queue up you have wait 20 mins before you are allowed to join a game. So if you log in to another account the queue would stop and thus waste their time.
---
Somehow my iPod connected to my moms speaker while she was listening to music and I played this not knowing I was connected somehow connected to it. She was scarred.
---
There are so many factors that could effect this and you gave us no information that could help us to help you.
---
My only advantage is more experience. Not to mention you can’t get better unless you play up in terms of skill. Also Sending in the Navy Seals on a far less trained terrorist cell isn’t a war crime so it definitely isn’t a crime on a virtual video game lmao.

Basically if you are about to win and A.) All your pings go to 3000+, everyone starts running in place and suddenly your kicked to the main menu and a pop up says you have lost connection to the match, you got hit. You also need to restart your game and or sign back out and in to que back to ranked. You usually lose no elo but you get robbed of a win, but assholes that hit all the time know when to trigger it to were it will still count as  loss for you.
---
So I didn't have it apparently so I'm contacting ubi support.
---
nonsense.
---
This isn’t really related now is it
---
Me me likey
---
I miss year 1 and year 2 vibes a lot but gotta give it to Ubisoft they are trying their best to improve the game which they have and trying to bring in better operators.
---
Finally it’s a shit map
---
This is what they chose to work on instead of bugs
---
Unpopular opinion: I like this map.

Someone decided it was worth their time to put a black scribble over half our Lord's face that I think letting all of you see it here is worth all our time put together.

Eh, you'll be fine.

He really isnt though hes just a good operator. Siege could really use alot more operators like Jackal

Already glitches:(

his toothpick is back now

Maybe.

But it still removes it from two game modes lol

From someone who’s just started playing siege over the last week, I have to say I’m abit devastated this has been taken out the ranked pool. WHAT A MAP

looked like a far cry healing animation for a sec
---
That's what I suspected as well.   
---
Do you know if it affects your stats on your profile? (w/l and k/d)
---
They could have reworked or at least gone back to the original
---
Chill chill i nokk pm arent bad
---
And then you play the game and it's anything but
---
I like how you drew her face, but I feel like you might want to work on anatomy a bit. Those legs are l o n k
---
UPVOTE THIS! This problem in way worse than you think
---
FO-12 doesn’t need a nerf at all, shotguns are poop
---
What information do you need to help then?
---
Lion is useful in every occasion, but requires teamwork. Maverick is a little less common, bit can be very useful at certain sights
---
Meaty
---
I have less than 1 hour with every attack operator except Monty and blitz, so I can’t just switch to a different op especially because on my ranked team a lot of our strats depend on a shield op, and when I’m last alive trying to protect the defuser, that ADS time is crucial
---
I don't even really play this game anymore because of DDoSing. I could've hit plat easily but I always get DDoSed.
---
another benefit of these player based maps is that it's coming from the players who play the game. This way when new maps are released there won't be anymore complaints from the players
---
Better start scrounging for that sweet sweet renown
---
It's out RN!
---
Eh, it's not so much that as just the general knowledge of the player base doesnt have to deal with it first hand. A lot of this sub doesnt even though know what a ddos attack looks like or that they even really happen. They see it as higher rank players just complaining they got "outplayed" and looking for an excuse for why they lost. Sucks really :/
---
#LET'S FUCKING GO
---
This would be emotional if it wasn’t hereford
---
No I don’t at all, but if you care SO much about that, then go play casual to get your bearings up with them. Don’t inflict your fear of new ops on people who want to use them right now competitively.
---
If you seriously are banning new ops while you have the pass, then you are brain dead, as you can play casual to understand them without worrying. 
---
Don’t spend your time for the next week not learning how to play against them in ranked, that’s an awful idea.
---
You can already buy it
---
You're an abomination.

Hello kmskrokodil, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2w35y/anyone_else_crashing_too/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yep
---
What did they do?
---
Which maps do you guys think should be reworked for year five? I think chalet and skyscraper because both of them are in ranked and it’s been a hot topic on whether or not they should be gone
---
Do yourself a favour and dont play ranked, please. Play unranked till things settle down
---
Either make it clean or camo, don’t do both
---
Maybe the grapple could be something like an ADS where it keeps them in a small range until they pull it out? Still effective for countering rushing
---
Ur dumb
---
I have a version where it’s a gun
---
Yeah only tool them 3 fucking years. Look at Black Ops 2,3 &amp; 4 and compare them. They are all reskins of the same game.
---
It’s year 3 still
---
If you’re talking about when you click someone’s name and see their ranked W/L and K/D, definitely not. If you’re talking about when you go look at your stats with each operator, I’d assume they count since casual has always counted.
---
Damn, stop whining like a little bitch. I'm sorry that they nerfed your favorite operator but literally almost no one cares. "Just get good" "Bad people need to stop complaining." Those are like the worst argumentive statements ever. If I had to guess I assume you where the one who sucked ass and used shields to kill people. Now you think your the best and everyone sucks. Please save it for someone who cares, because Reddit doesn't want to hear you complaining about how you can't get to copper I anymore.
---
keep seeing them but still have no idea what these flairs mean lol
---
Thanks for the feedback very helpful
---
6/6 placements have been ddossed.
---
I see you're using Internet Explorer
---
It's funny how people assume that the mags always have to be for their guns. They work in a team for Rainbow. They don't just carry their own ammo. Someone has to carry ammo for others, much like how Nokk has AR mags. Just because she doesn't need it doesn't mean her squad doesn't need it.
---
This is what most people don’t understand is that it isn’t in Ubisofts power to fix this but rather Microsoft’s as it is the Microsoft Azure servers that this game is run on every platform.
---
3D artists don't fix bugs...
---
I like it
---
THANK FUCKING GOD
---
Oh I'm sure justice would be swift and unfair if you messed with US govt commerce.
---
I'm just not 100% convinced you'd get in extreme trouble, I would hope you'd get a cease and desist before they pressed charges.
---
Specs
---
Holo on a 590....
---
Man im diamond and even before the season every 3/5 games were ddosed.
---
This season im gonna wait it out a few weeks before doing my placements.
---
Anything regarding PC specs and recording software.
---
CPU, GPU, Ram, HDD vs SDD, are you trying to record tot he same drive Siege is installed on, What software you are using to record. Any one of those could be a factor in why your performance drops while recording.
---
keep seeing them but still have no idea what these flair  mean.. please explain lol
---
can confirm, I just didn't get the "according to another amazon customer" part, which made it better imo xD
---
I hear you. I'd trade the buggy hellscape of Operation Health for the cancer we have now.
---
Sry. But legit, they make keyring charms, surprised they never thought of stuff like painted op logos or full operator arts
---
They don’t ddos you, they ddos the match server so it crashes.
---
You can exploit me with anal.
---
I will use it well
---
Yeah same. I wondered why I could tell whihh map we were playing when I heard the theme even though they all sound somewhat alike. Only now realizing it's different tones and my brain organizes the map to the tone. What a smart fucker the brain is like I didn't even know I did that but I did.
---
*its about to get hot*
---
I got killed almost immediately and then kicked for no apparent reason.
---
nice mode.
---
Ubi released this gamemode which should be "like ranked just without a rank". People can leave as if it was casual and no other players can rejoin. They just did something wrong
---
There's something weird about seeing someone in such an archaic uniform with such a futuristic gun lol
---
Dont worry about it we all have bad days. Posting stuff on reddit like this will always get you hate though so this probably isnt the sub for that. What system are you on? I could play with u sometime if you want
---
#( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Im not new, Im in gold and rank 267
---
Are you kidding? Just cause siege got a bit popular doesnt mean its the most competitive game out there.
---
I dare you to play other highly competitive games such as league of legends, fortnight (shit game), cod, pubg, or overwatch and see how many of your games get ddosed cause it won't be fucking every 3/5 games
---
Legacy or original 20 operators
---
Like Jackals PDW is so underutilized. Add one with a 30 round mag, and I'd call it a new gun.
---
Good. Blitz has had 4 years of being able to out ADS everyone. Should have been done a long time ago.

I have no clue. All I know is that joining a party allows anyone in said party to know your exact IP

It was comeback win and they were really toxic.
---
STOP REWORKING OLD MAPS!
---
Maybe OP played those first three rounds on his own and won a 1-5 on one of those rounds
---
This has been happening to me for the last 2 weeks, I don’t think it’s an ember rise issue
---
Don't play eus. If you were plat 2 and above last year you're bound to run into them.
---
I said “One of, if not, the most”
---
People play hostage?
---
ddos allows ping to climb to 6000 i doubt anyone would be playing on 6000 like its nothing
---
They shouldn’t be able to ban new ops until the first week is over, people payed for the pass to get the ops early.
---
I mean it doesn’t matter too bad like do you jackel and blitz much anyways ?
---
same with the penta charm
---
Idk what you’re talking about his was my original clip
---
Didnt knew that. Thanks for the info. :)
---
Has there genuinely been a rework to the smg11? Because you handled that thing well.

they turn on and off

you don't get banned for randomly being put with a cheater...
---
you get banned for being in the squad of a cheater.
---
I saw on a video by a YouTubed named hologram Sam
---
Ik
---
still mate, siege is fucked cause ubisoft are pricks who just secure the bag and don't give a fuck about actual issues the players want fixed.
---
why the fuck does hibana have a bat
---
Just curious, how much do you sell them for?
---
Did you solo queue or did you play with someone else?
---
I’ve hit 30k+ ping and had some slight problems at times, other times weren’t good.
---
They actually have the same abandonment sanctions as ranked and they cross. So people who do that too much will affect their ranked experience. It’s not ubi’s fault the community is toxic and dumb. Give it 2-3 weeks and this playlist is gonna be fun. Just have to get passed the trolls
---
I've been having the same but just randomly in or out of match hasn't happened before the update
---
Yes! I used to play blitz all the time before pick and ban
---
It won’t be. They’ve broken every map they’ve reworked so far.
---
£17.99 + P&amp;P
---
This shit is really weird tho, I got all the year passes and operators except for Y4, but i'm missing the Pro League Sets and the other stuff, so scuffed
---
Goodbye phantom sight new update
---
amen brother. atleast i wont be looking at my 6000 ping screen every roujd
---
This is a good one. More mobility, still retains the same feel, better flow through objectives and into/out of the building
---
I remember having every elite skin. This was around when Doc or Frost had theirs come out, I haven't gotten one since but I haven't played regularly in a while.
---
I usually wait a week or 2 to weed out the glitches and toxic throwing trolls before doing my placements.
---
Just play monty instead I guess or even fuze
---
i like it..
---
No he doesn't. Look at the magazine. Very clearly a 7.62 magazine
---
It is definitely no easy task, but something needs to be done about it. If nothing can be done, then anything above Plat 2 will be lost, and the ranks lost to regular players will get lower and lower.
---
yeah but consistently ?
---
You just photoshopped a whip onto Ubisofts concept art for Mozzie? This wasn’t something you made this was Ubisofts Art that you modified
---
And I know ubi isn’t perfect but this isn’t their fault. It’s the trolls who think this is funny. There really isn’t much ubi can do about that
---
Previous game started as a 4v5 and then someone left on their team turning it into a 4v4 so ye fun mode xd
---
I already miss it. I don't think it's terrible, nor the greatest.
---
What leaves me scratching my head is how Ubi keeps failing to create proper "competitive" maps, so to speak. Hereford Base (new) is barely 1 year old and it's already out of Ranked. Fortress is not even 1 year and yet, out of Ranked. 
---
Wonder how much longer til they take out Outback.
---
If someone has no skill for semi auto weapons, well...
---
I feel the exact same way
---
we will check in when you least expect
---
Not a bad price. Sadly, I'm broke and still in school

Hello Wabbl3, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2x9s3/new_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I think the idea is to take away shields from anchors that are already really strong. So it's sort of a minor nerf to make it easier to play against them.
---
I know they were for a while but it seems to come and go.
---
Pick and ban is good, but people shouldn’t be able to ban the new ops until the first week is over, people payed money for the pass to play em early, so they shouldn’t  be able to get banned.
---
I came
---
That’s my secret cap, I’m a raging alcoholic
---
How the camo ruins it for me
---
no, they changed the animations for like all the guns i think?
---
RED DOT DETECTED
---
He misses the old shield
---
Depends on how they hit the server. If they hit it so that you/your team gets kicked but the server still runs, you’ll lose elo.
---
If the server gets hit hard enough that it just crashes the match server entirely, the game is simply void.
---
No. I'm fucking you anally
---
Time well spent?
---
The whole thing is one, uniform color. In order to truly match the SCAR-17, you need to give it the fifty shades of FDE treatment
---
Look up mozzie on google images and you’ll see the same pic without the whip
---
The audio was a few seconds off but other than that, that was amazing!
---
What does that do exactly? Holding the deplorable shield? I don’t get it honestly.
---
Moon shoes
---
I enjoy the sort of chaotic maps for Casual, but can't stand them in Ranked. Like House is easily one of my favorites and just does not work for Ranked anymore. Fuck Tower in any mode tho.
---
Do you have the season pass? I'm not sure if the uplay+ sub comes with that but I suggest you put in a ticket with support.ubi.com to check.
---
Because Ubi nor any other company can find a way to solve Ddosing without seriously affecting how servers run. Even then, Ubi doesn’t own the servers, that’s Microsoft. So it isn’t Ubi’s problem to fix Ddosing.
---
Maybe an alien came down and abducted his teammates 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You do realize those games who got canceled due to a ddos haven’t ever been played at least from Serverside so there is no data about anyone being in such a game
---
I thought the reason Ubi can’t do much is because they use servers used by Microsoft, iirc Microsoft Azure, so any changes to the servers need to come from Microsoft’s end.
---
Same everyone went knife only it was a truly beautiful moment.
---
Should have extended one of the balconies on 3rd floor and given it reinforceable walls so attackers get a push kind of like the bar map on cash room
---
I have seen this same joke in a Varsity video a couple weeks back. Not sure if it originates from there or not but hey-ho.
---
Video Timestamp: https://youtu.be/0jVSA3ynCRM?t=170
---
I don’t like it when I use shield fuze but Ubisoft be Ubisoft
---
Finally someone posted about how annoying this issue is, champion rank only gives them more incentive, everyone was excited for this next season but with the addition of the champion rank, high ranked games are going to be nearly impossible to play.
---
I was ready for the Frost runout I saw waiting to happen in prep and still got domed.  I’m really not on my game right now and this isn’t a good sign for when I want to hop into ranked this season.
---
Thank you, kind stranger
---
Simple-what. Have you played coastline or even house?
---
Those lips are somehow still too happy for Cav.
---
I'd be sad too if I was a hostage
---
Because it isn’t as big of an issue as it is with Siege. It’s based on perception. Siege has a naturally huge toxic fan base which in turn brings about more ddossers and people to make it a bigger deal than what it might actually be.
---
I just played 3 placements on Xbox. 2 of the matches I was ddos after a plant situation and couldn’t move and then on attack couldn’t move at all. I’m not even a high rank player, I fluctuate between silver 4- silver 1. This has been happening more and more frequently over the past few months and it’s so frustrating.
---
I get that. Would it be easier to kick someone that tks the new op a minute or so into the round?
---
Basically.
---
then either get it or wait a week to be able to buy them with renown.
---
I restarted Uplay and still no luck :/
---
Yes, and thank god for it
---
You get banned for being in the same squad. Not the same team. You squaded up with a cheater
---
Start up rainbow first, if that doesn’t work, hold in Xbox power button for 10 seconds and leav it set for about 10-20 min, sometimes Xbox overwhelms itself and forgets it did an update
---
Why did you TK
---
New players will probably benefit more from the recoil decrease since they mostly body anyway. 
---
Faster ads doesn’t matter if you only hit a couple shots.
---
I can't remember the last time I saw someone hold sniper balcony when the objective wasn't bedroom/office.
---
I can taste the console copper
---
Because people can’t hack on console, so more resort to Ddosing on console since it’s replacing the spot people would normally fill with hacking.
---
Ok thank you everybody 😁😄😃
---
Flair checks out

Hello jradthebeast, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2xjfs/is_the_alpha_pack_glitch_from_last_season_back/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Sneak 100
---
I’m just saying I believe people cry wolf annoy this too often. Games drop connection, it happens. Either way this is a Microsoft issue and not a Ubisoft issue.
---
I’m silver rank on Xbox and it happens to me pretty frequently.
---
Thanks. I really only got into rainbow during year 4 so my knowledge of stuff like this is slim
---
You would assume so, but people generally don’t care what happens as long as it isn’t to them.  Kicking the person that TKs doesn’t prove anything and getting that four person vote could be fairly difficult.  It’s also impossible in ranked and unranked where the vote to kick option doesn’t even exist.  Give it a couple of weeks and it’ll die down.
---
I'm pretty sure that it's averaged, so if you finished at 1500 you would start this season at 2000 since the base start is 2500.
---
I just came back 2 playing Siege and my first game back on everyone just starts team killing each other. The reason I stop playing rainbow is because all of the team killers
---
You say slight, I say big
---
The only obj I can really think of right now that I impact trick is Clubhouse basement, and the position for it is perfect for how I play Rook with ACOG, I’m in the vicinity to have a long angle for stairs and blue, a soft angle on dirt and beneath hatch, Rook just seems like the right operator to put in that spot for me.
---
From what I understand ubi displays server ip to players
---
I dont get it... he doesn't look middle eastern to me.
---
It's best to wait a few days while you readjust to the changes and figure out strats with the rework
---
oh ok
---
I get that but if it made the game more stable I can't complain
---
To elaborate more on what the other user was trying to point out to you is that the Art team has different functions, priorities, and training than say the QA team, etc. that actually work on gameplay, etc. 
---
Their work very likely has little to no influence on how well the other teams do on quashing bugs or improving the game relative to that.
---
My idea has always been to have reverse friendly fire on from the very start for everyone in casual.
---
I didn’t pay $30 to wait several weeks, but I guess I’m forced to.
---
Yeah I always attack first I would prefer to defend. 9/10 games attack.
---
Yeah but what do they gain from winning in casual or unranked? Maybe renown ok but they get it also from ranked. They are now just abusing servers for their own enjoyment.
---
How have you managed to avoid this?  I'm a silver/gold and have it happen a few times every season.
---
Thanks man, have a good week as well, my man 🙂
---
Fuck Skyscraper and while we're at it fuck Lesion. -this message brought to you by Monty gang-
---
What?!
---
Reworked Kafe and Club are two of the best and most balanced maps in the game
---
There have been only 3 reworks adide from Kanal and two of them were fantastic so saying that every reworked map is just stupid and its not true
---
The difference is that the attackers need to grab the hostage and find a shield that's still up with defenders still alive.  Unless the site is clear and the remaining defender(s) are far from site, the defenders still have a chance of killing the person carrying the hostage to stop them from placing the hostage on a shield and detonating it, which isn't going to be simple as Goyo now needs to keep them away from the hostage.
---
Rebooting your whole system might be the next best step.  You can either do it by, well, clicking restart or holding the power button until it shuts down.  I’ve found that a forced shut down works better for fixing these issues on my own computers but it’s not guaranteed.
---
Am not a lawyer?
---
Yeah I'm OK with that new here Fort is God-awful almost unplayable half the time
---
I wouldn’t be opposed to that. That way a teamkill is still a teamkill, just a different person dies.
---
I wasn’t playing the new ops i just kept getting tkd by diffrent ppl
---
Fuckin-A
---
There is a max and minimum but I don't remember what they are
---
looooolll
---
I don't see a point in the vote to kick system, it's usually not used correctly
---
Yea exactly and they won't want to actively try and kill you
---
It took me 10 minutes to update, I couldn't even fall asleep in that time
---
I was going to bed!
---
That's a great philosophy, but ranked matches don't aggregate all the rounds you play as a whole, the aggregate the games, which means that performing well in a game you lose doesn't reflect as well as performing poorly in a game you win.
---
My friend keeps reviving me infront of Cav...
---
Pengu.
---
Hilariously enough me and my buds refer to playing ranked as ‘gambling’
---
I understand it’s frustrating. Trust me, I’ve been there playing casual on tower and the entire team leaves the match and leaves me alone. I get it. But like I said I’m pretty sure unranked has the same abandon sanctions as ranked. Give it 2–3 weeks for the trolls to go back into hiding in their moms basements and then that playlist will be a lot of fun
---
Will do *insert wink emoji*
---
Some people play ESDF as their home keys
---
Mine are frost and buck😫
---
Says pathfinders
---
Oh definitely.  I had a mad game on Hereford immediately after in casual and wondered why I couldn’t play like that where it matters.  I’ll keep my eyes open for videos from streamers like Varsity to see if there are new things I need to know about.  It got me gold 3 last season, so maybe it’ll help me continue improving.
---
yup but not copper and plat
---
#🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
You sure that's what's actually happening? Not trying to discredit your issues. I have a lot of friends that are silver/gold and they never get ddosed.. dosser are out to steal elo and boost themselves on the leaderboard they arent there to grief low ranks. I'm talking like 6000 elo plus. Maybe it's happening to you when they first are starting their boost cycle? Idk man, maybe just really unlucky.
---
In a game like Siege, you either deal with it or drop it until it passes.
---
I think shields need to be redone in some way. Slow ads time probably isn't the best direction.
---
yes, you were wrong. no new maps this year.
---
Yea I hope so.
---
Its DDOS, not East Coast
---
Buenos Dias Fuckboy
---
How fun!
---
I’m well aware, I just wish that wasn’t the case. It’s not that hard to not be a shithead but that’s still beyond some people.
---
sort out your internet then
---
Goyo gets three shields, so it kinda makes sense to take others away. I mean with the right team, you could have 7 shields on a map. That would get pretty annoying.
---
I absolutely despise clubhouse rework and I’m not really a fan of kafe either.
---
Exactly, it's going to get progressively worse with time
---
That argument made no sense
---
Siege is a competitive shooter and maps should be as balanced as possible to be competitive
---
I dont really get what is the difference in terms of having a challenge about playing a reworked map where you have to learn new strats, viable sites and such just as in a new map
---
Hol open*
---
This is Siege we’re talking about.  Being a shithead is all some people care about.
---
It’s the enemy team they can DDOS the whole server. Be blessed you don’t know about it
---
Nope Spoin Boi commented the same before you mate
---
Aw damn. Oh well i guess, not like its the end of the world
---
Hello, can you explain how it's working? How can they DDos big company server's? How they connect or know what to do? Should i be worried too? Cause if they can Ddos server they can hit individuals players. I just can't understand how you can Ddos something big like ubisoft
---
They all bullied him until they heard "LMG MOUNTED, AND LOADED"

PS4?

I mean it is slightly botched with me trying to make it slightly better

Cloggin the feed with garb gameplay once again :(
---
No one cares
---
Thanks!
---
Yup. Graduated in 2015.
---
you guys should force new people to play newcomer i've only been getting retards in casual  this day
---
Exactly why I refuse to ban leison. He's pretty nuts, but at least I don't have to deal with ash on site 6 seconds in.
---
Yes - same as ranked besides loss of mmr obviously
---
Definitely right at the end of last season. I couldn't get my aim right. Tried lowering and raising my sensitivity. Finally got it down, I changed my controller rotation option (PS4) from classic to updated and I've gotten my aim better now
---
Sorry i have disappointed you buddy
---
Because people don't know how networking works. Every single person who says something needs to be done about DDOSing doesn't even know how it works. If they did - they would realize that it's pretty futile effort. If someone could develop a way to get rid of DDOSing? They would be bill gates rich within a decade.
---
They're stressing the servers, no other game do I see servers stressed, ubisoft servers can be dealt with by a 14 year old with a computer and a program.
---
jesus christ

so stuff that’s been in the patch notes for about a month

Hi guys can someone tell me how to fix the problem where there is a lock on the currency pack option in the r6 shop. I was expecting it to be fixed on ember rise but it still won’t let me buy currency packs.
---
"ayyyyy"
---
Thankyou that's great
---
S E A S O N  P A S S
---
You that new to the game, don’t worry about those two ops too much.
---
It would be better if you made the drone jump into your ass.
---
Or let them play in their respective ranks as they deserve? Or is ranked strictly for high skill players?
---
“Played about 10 matches”...
---
10matches is by no mean a large enough sample to say something is worse lmao. 
---
Shields deserve a nerf, warden doesn’t need one, just like other operators he is situational still has a great load out.
---
Noticed the same thing during my last couple rounds, it may be a server side issue. Hopefully it'll get fixed.
---
People are stupid my man. However this update, they’re starting to ask more than usual lol.
---
As e
---
Sorry if this has been out I thought it just dropped
---
Only beta bitches complain about kill steals.
---
Well they shouldn't like it because it's a dead meme and painfully unfunny. I am in the "fandom" but most of it sucks. I fucking hate Fortnite and would rather play Tetris for the rest of my life than play that steaming pile of garbage.
---
I'm assuming that happened to you?
---
IF:( Revive - Invincibility = No)

If you’re that new to the game, don’t worry about the new ops too much.

Giving original ops elite skins &lt; giving dlcs ops elite skins
---
PS4 has had a glitch since the update came out that might be crashing your game. If you get crashes with a error message than its a glitch, not ddossing or anything else

It’s not if your it’s real fair and competive map if your having trouble with anything on this map you need serious help
---
Get a life you fucking virgin
---
Yo wtf I probably know you. My cousin Arika graduated with you lol
---
Looks more like mozzies weapon xd
---
*Ah yes, this is nice boat. I want to mount and load on it.*
---
Yea, and BW helped hide her traps
---
I would sure hope so
---
Why don’t you give some context while you’re at itv my mind reading skills be Ferrous Oxide
---
How the fuck does that even work
---
Somebody's mad.
---
What is all this thing about twitch charms? Can somebody explain it to me
---
I’m sad they took smokes impacts
---
Placing gadgets feels really slow as well
---
Don't remember them but you probably do know me
---
virgin
---
You haven’t supported them from day one beacuse it’s always been one week after release that only season pass owners get them
---
Well you’re not getting em without the pass. It sounds like you’re new here. Maybe don’t get these two ops and get someone that can help you out. I recommend Frost or Blackbeard. Easy to use abilities and guns. And they’re cheap too.
---
I think they have one. But a t the beginning on the round
---
Our side
---
It's happened twice today in placement matches and i hate all of you who do this
---
Poor Mira
---
Then why don't they comment on this thread? I mean they don't have to go into specifics or solve this issue by tomorrow, but they certainly had the time to answer to a thread about pre-sets for weapon attachments instantly.
---
I noticed teammates footsteps were really loud but i don't play very stealthily so I didn't notice much else
---
Hereford is gone🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀

Never would have thought I'd meet someone from Curwensville or Clearfield county for that matter on reddit. What are the odds.
---
Dont know why you were downvoted, take my upvote in return
---
Thanks for this there are so many dumbass on this site that don’t seem to get that
---
Yea it feels a littl clunkier
---
When a big hits your face when your grappling
---
Tbh they could get rid of the movement penalty and cooldown completely and he would still be under whelming. 
---
Needs an ACOG really to anchor, otherwise i think he needs reworking to be like Rook where he can hand the sunglasses out (maybe they have a single use on other ops).
---
One looks much more serious than the other, and the other has a bow.
---
Big disagree
---
Out of 6 rankeds in played today, amaru and goyo were banned in 6 of them. Fun part, it was me and a couple friends. No regrets.
---
Good Riddance lol
---
Very, very low. I thought I was the only redditor in the state
---
Asides that lmao it is a pretty good elite skin fits her character well
---
this isn't realism its a bug you know that but you want karma for sucking off a soulless company
---
I really wish they would've released a new map with ember rise. I would have loved to see a jungle themed map.
---
It’s still in custom matches. Tbh I rarely get house on casual anyways unfortunately.
---
Buck/Capital next please

Maybe he wants it.

Cringy

Big brain
---
If you subscribe to a Siege streamer on Twitch, you'll get their custom charm Ubi made for them.
---
They still have not fixed the audio issues, are you kidding me? What a joke. 3 new elite skins and yet they cannot fix fucking GUN SOUNDS?
---
I wish you could toggle this feature it is a tiny bit harder to get to where I want now
---
better than black ice
---
Vector is so good im glad that Goyo got it ,was feeling that was a waste to play Mira just for her gun
---
Hooool up... where's that cluster charge going...
---
chrome remote desktop?
---
I don’t see him anywhere
---
How did you find this it’s 98 days old jeez
---
You put a lot of effort into this, really good work. But there's a difference between DDoS and DoS, and I can guarantee that it isn't DDoSing that happens in these matches.
---
Also, I've only been playing Casual exclusively this season, on Xbox. And in maybe 5-10% of matches, we get DoSed too. There's no escaping it, it's ridiculous.
---
Pretty much
---
You have 3 months to get 50K renown, you could even play them on the test server... My rant is related as you want to play an operator in the first week that players can't counter, ignoring the pick and ban. Isnt that kinda p2w? Pick and ban is in the game so you can ban operators you don't want to play against.
---
Oh sweet, but how does it work, i mean ypu only subscribe and its done?
