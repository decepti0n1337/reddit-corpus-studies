yes... yyeeesss... YYYEEESSSSS

---
---
Just like Jager ingame
---
When you load into ranked with no teammates and the enemy team is still worried about losing the match
---
Why would repost this?
---
I‚Äôm getting rainbow six Vegas vibes here
---
[removed]
---
No idea how that second shot hit
---
Just ignore them. Unranked and ranked are less toxic.
---
Possibly but also possible to be good player, I had kills that looks "funny" because I learnt to just fire at sound ques, and it's will look like I'm using "soft walls hack" but I've just learnt to play from sound que, with a good headset and understanding how sound works and travels around a map, you can get some very questionable kills somewhat often.
---
Hard to say if you don't have any recording of it, sorry
---
That is very true.
---
what can you do
---
I was just looking for my business cards...
---
ik, but i cant even voice chat or send messages now
---
Grunting noises intensify
---
I'm confused why you're confused
---
I still stand by what I said, unless someone is literally in prison for this its just more corporate babble to make the players feel like Ubi cares about them.
---
How longs the ban
---
I'm a simple man...
---
I wasn't even looking at the gun or anything else in particular. But I saw stuff on the right give you a + score and the screen vibrated a bit. I instantly knew. "Kapkan"
---
Try 75 more times
---
I get called out for hacking quite regularly because of it, and the hilarious thing is, I'm not even that good at siege, I'm average at best.
---
I also wanted to get Mozzie lol
---
Go4 is probably what you're looking for. Some streamers host tourneys as well
---
that‚Äôs straight up incorrect. every match is played on a server in a datacenter
---
My cat tries to get attention and just ‚Äúcasually‚Äù presses his paw on my button power and turns off my pc at 3-1 and about to yoink my elo
---
Because you used inappropriate language. You can't get tilted and overreact, it just gets you in more trouble. That ban is entirely your fault, js. The toxicity is one thing but you cant pin the ban on them
---
You never know someone‚Äôs potential
---
it is a crime though. people are being taken to court. look it up
---
When you eat the bait you deserve the consequences. You're basically doing what they want you to do.
---
Mozzie is sick I‚Äôll be honest. He‚Äôs a lot of fun and drones are like the best tool in the game. Have fun
---
would have been better if he didn't just kill his teammate though
---
Long range snipers have litterally told stories of putting their rounds in the hot sand to get the extreme umpf. 
---

---
Just like you said the performance gain (or loss in your argument) is so meniscal that no the hot brass is not gonna cause jams.
---
*Happy F12 raptor noises*
---
Because people working in Cyber Security will be fixing gameplay bugs, get the fuck out.
---
I‚Äôve heard Go4 is full of MnK, any word if that‚Äôs still the case ?
---
I can smell r34 around the corner
---
Ubi is better take my money and like it
---
so i get tilted and say fuck off, but they harassed me and called me poor and they dont get banned?
---
whos really in the rlwrong here
---
It just says "involved". Doesn't mean he was a combatant. Could have been a bystander
---
Lol
---
Zoom
---
Oh yeah
---
Legit thought that was a guy
---
u/Masaru-Enatsu
---
That is what i meant, but people are paid to fill in back stories. If they somewhat arbitrarily picked GIGN events, that's fine, but if I'm going to insert a birth year for a back story, one of the easiest things to do is make sure the dates are reasonable. 11 years old is hilariously bad. You don't even have to do math to realize something is off
---

Probably, not much you can do about it. It's basically impossible to prove.

---
So much roaming made me tired watching lmao
---
Glorious lmao
---
You say that like it's bad to "camp" on DEFENCE in SIEGE
---
STOP PLEASE, Im never playing Rook, Bandit, or Tachanka again
---
Nothing personal, just taking into account all the 180s is seewbile playin'
---
holy shit that's the most inaccurate equivalence I've ever seen. Hacking ruins a few hours, pedophilia ruins a person's entire lifetime. You need to get some perspective
---
DDosing is against federal law and can get you prison time, fines up $1000+ and possibly having computer access revoked.
---
TLDR Most people rely on sound too much.  So a character that takes advantage of that is something that people are requesting a lot  and I can understand it because I know someone who is like that and I hate playing with him
---
I can upload a 180 I will give me a minute
---
theres ALWAYS more things to dix as a software engineer
---
the problem isnt Ubi not prioritizing right but lies in the nature of programming
---
This is one of those things that, while unfair, you will learn about with experience and not repeat again.
---
Next time you'll pay attention to what's behind the wall you're reinforcing, and assuming that you're not a regular teamkiller it won't have any permanent effects on your account.
---
Probably a visual bug. Leaning without adsing isn't even available in console's version of siege. (Forgetting throwables, of course)
---

99% of the time they're not very good players and try to make up for their lack of skill with bullshit gadgets.

I remember those
---
bandit tricking is ez work until they have a maverick who you tried to ban but team thought jackal was the better option
---
You do realize the modeling of the nitro cell is a realistic depiction of an ied meaning you just created a fake bomb which is you know illegal
---
Looks sick dude
---
sorry that i dont understand but what do you mean? These people are ddosing for some type of symbol in game or were?
---
Give us Capitao elite &gt;:(
---
They did issue a cease and desist and took down a website with Europol as an ally.
---
I disagree, I cant stand these low effort meme posts
---
Hell yeah!
---
This wasnt casual
---
Great work, however I think you made the head a little too big cuz it looks roughly around the same height of the torso
---
This was ranked
---
That game was a mess. The first round was a 5v1, one kid got a team triple kill plus himself with a nitro cell and got kicked.
---
Wait hold on haven't played in a hot minute what event is this? And how long is it on for?
---
F for no nut November
---
Ash noises
---
I've heard there's a competitive culture of hacking in China. So instead of comparing practical skills to see who's better, they measure their abilities based on how expensive/powerful their hacks are.
---
People care that badly about their casual winstreaks? Jesus Christ.
---
Then again, it isn't surprising considering the amount of times ive been kicked for not clutching a 1v5 or getting c4d by a teammate because i was playing rook and took to long to put my armor down.
---
FOOKING GPS SATELLITES 
---
FOCKING UNMANNED DRONES
---
FOCKING LAESA SOIGHTS
---
Right, because the comparison was specifically about time and not about justifying something normalized by a specific culture.  Big brain time.

It definitely is getting to be a hive mind, but I personally agree with them but won‚Äôt speak out on anything I don‚Äôt know much about. I‚Äôm not a fan of the CPC but I‚Äôm not gonna shit on the people of China.
---
I remember getting DDOS'd on PC one time, it's so massively rare there that everyone on the team was laughing it off and blaming Ubi servers unbeknownst to us it was someone on the other team who later got kicked by his own teammates when he confessed to be DDOSing, once kicked 10 seconds later the game got back to normal.
---
Thats why he carries impacts
---
Except on Xbox though right?

Tell me.

How is this supposed to be better?

Is that on PC or console? I took around a year long break and barely used the thing after the machine pistol changes and man is it hard to control. 
---
I've been useing the c75 but I've been wondering if I'm just useing a crutch or if it's a better option on console and I just need to adjust.
---
Please tell me your team got him. Because if not we have some serious F‚Äôs to drop
---
Yeah so you already have the answer to your question in the post.
---
because people heard the idea and now keep making it
---
here i have a new idea for people - a defender who can stick to ceilings and sort of blend in. kind of like cav
---
Yeah it came with the new season I believe.
---
I personally love the red dot, and I feel like the new ADS changes make the "the sight takes up too much of your screen" arguments a moot point.  There's not really a need to walk around ADSed all the time anymore.
---
The people that play ranked aren‚Äôt going to be the main player base for the mini games so ranked ques won‚Äôt be effected at all, if anything the casual ques are going to be the ones effected
---
i‚Äôm complaining there isn‚Äôt one, i know there isn‚Äôt one and u want ubi to add a way
---
No it‚Äôs actually in the game
---
bandit found the estrodiol. they couldn't resist the \*drugs\*.
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use the double click feature. It is WAY faster and effective at saving clips but sometimes I forget to double click before the desired event happens and I end up just starting the recording.
---
It'd be hard. VERY hard. Harder than console hip leaning
---
Acog with a red doot is a little bit too overpowered
---

But it is a good idea op

I was questionable about it at first but it is kind of nice. You can catch some people off guard.

It's all practice and patience, you'll get there bro.

Not just console.
---
Oh yea
---
You need to get friends and learn to spot what people are worth listening to and which ones you need to mute. Instantly mute anyone blasting music or memes, giving bad or unintelligible callouts, or speaking other than the languages you speak. Also mute people that constantly rage and rant over anything and everything. Once you weed out those the game should be a lot more enjoyable.
---
it also ties in the splinter cell universe as well in a different mission
---
I forgot I don‚Äôt pay ranked... but you‚Äôre right
---
If you say so man. Were it so easy I‚Äôm sure Ubisoft would have already found a way to make them not usable. Why did you think I supported people cheating in games just because I said bruh?
---
First and foremost, map awareness. Knowing how to sneak up on the enemy is your first advantage. The best attacks are when you can flank and get behind the enemy while they are focused on something else.
---
  
---
Second, know when to use silent step: Sneaking up unexpectedly is your second advantage. You are not completely silent when using the ability, it reduces the level from what it would be. i.e. running is louder than walking. It is still possible to hear cav if she is sprinting with her silent step turned on. Turning the ability on also prevents footsteps being left for jackal while its turned on, and stops his ping if he does manage to track you. If you time it properly, he'll never get more than the first ping.
---
Third, interrogation is your LAST priority. You are completely vulnerable while interrogating and if the attackers are co-ordinated you're more than likely to get killed before you can complete it, leaving your victim alive. They key to a successful interrogation is knowing when its worth the risk or if its safe.
---
And last but certainly not least: there are some maps  you should just not bother playing her. Cav is my main, but there are some maps, and some specific sites on others, where I will never pick Cav as she's just not viable. You need plenty of options for flanking and getting the drop on the attackers.
---
I hope my huge wall of text is worth the read and can help you get started with (in my opinion) one of the funnest operators in siege.
---
Depends if you're on PC or console.
---
It‚Äôs personal preference. I haven‚Äôt moved mine off of default. I tried moving it up but seemed so fast compared to what I was used to so I leave it alone. I‚Äôm a decent player too.
---
Everything that's been done using a k&amp;m is using adapters that convert k&amp;m movement into controller input. All movement that's done in game can technically be done using a controller, which makes it harder to prove before banning the user
---
It's not for everybody. The candidates game studios hire generally requires a BS in Computer Science. Which not only includes programming but a lot of math. Minimum of Linear Algebra which also requires Calculus 1/2 or A/B plus some physics. 
---
It's a lot for a demanding job. In the game industry you get paid if your game sells. If you work for big companies you get more security but it's not always worth it. 
---
Personally I'd stay away from game development unless it's a passion.
---
Ironically the store I linked sells that helmet too lol.
---
If a maverick elite happens I want it to either be like black hawk down delta force or modern day delta force like general miller‚Äôs bois
---
I deleted a lesser game(mirrors edge) I‚Äôm not bout to pay ten more bucks for shit I already own
---
r/unexpectedpinkguy
---
I love hide and seek! My biggest isseu is if your up against a 5 stack who all have mics, theyre probably taking the mode too seriously. If I come across teams that hunker while hiding and super scumming it with Leision and Smoke, I back out instantly. I dont mind the Frosts that spam their traps all around them UNLESS they got a Smoke. These squads also tend to suck the fun out of hiding. Dealing with seekers that clear your entire team in 5 seconds flat is super boring. If you just solo queue and play stupid youll have fun. If I had to make some changes to the mode I would replace Pulse with N√∏kk and swap Smoke out for Castle or Vigil.
---
if the guy doesnt want callouts in a casual match, then respect his decision. It's just a casual match. No reason to be salty if your teammate plays trasg
---
Its more for extra storage tbh. I own one, its definitetly worth tbh. Also ik EA are peices of shit but mirrors edge is a masterpeice
---
The well known leaker who leaked Nokk and Warden said that the ACOG was going to be on the BOSG due to fan pressure.
---
You are downloading the 4k ultra texture pack in addition to the game. That's why is soo big. Normal game 8s 60gb
---
So your invincible right
---
I have the same case its nice
---
thanks you're so nice 0w0
---
He wants call outs but then he wants us to shut up every time he has to sound or because he can't play without listening for footsteps?
---
 Do you not see the level of idiocy you're spouting right now?
---
this gave me anxiety
---
Can we not associate Mozzie with the devourer of onions, please?
---
Fuck I‚Äôll look into it. You‚Äôre probably right. And you‚Äôre definitely right mirrors edge is golden.
---
Great news for Cav mains and I hope we Ela mains can get ours soon with this one coming
---
Funny. I was able to do it a couple of weeks ago. Gonna try it against tomorrow.
---
If being a weeb means I can draw like this at 11 years old, sign me up.
---
I always figured he‚Äôd just be dressed in casual clothing. Keep with his backstory of basically living with terrorists and all. Make him the most casual fucker in the game lol.
---
honestly there are so many solutions to your problem that it's baffling me how this is still unresolved. 
---
have him mute you if he doesn't like you talking. stop inviting him. just mute him and let him yell "shut up" all he wants.
---
Supressor is pointless in siege unless it is inbuilt. Ex-bar is useless on gun like smg11 especially because A, recoil is heavier than normal SMGs, and B, that gun isn't meant for any engagements last 15m.
---
F
---
Well he‚Äôs already dressed as he‚Äôs living with terrorists.
---
text chat exists for a reason
---
I wouldnt reccommend something i dont use myself, plus there are ways to make your own from old tv boxes like Sky or Virgin Or amazon so.
---
Wow, I ummmm.....okay I'm not complaining
---
Hol' up lemme check the bio.
---
That isn't a ACOG on the BOSG, so its inaccurate.
---
Yeah you wanna know that gets that gets me getting bitched at by everybody else that gets everybody else inviting him to the game that gets him joining in and nobody else wanting to kick him when I'm not the party lead  That gets everybody else doing what he wants instead of telling him to just deal with it.
---
 Believe me I would love to employ the many many solutions possible but I am the one man out of the entire group
---
Not on console it doesn't.
---
 Even if it did it would take too long
---
That‚Äôs actually good for stopping hibana charges from below

they basically have said that....Epi said they are looking into what they can do on their end but at the moment it isnt something Ubi can actually detect and is on Sony/Microsoft
---
sounds like you're the only one who likes to talk a lot and take casual super casually in that group then
---
find a different group of people to play with who are more like you
---
IQ has absolutely no situational awareness apparently
---
Thats why Ubi needs a more in depth reporting system. Allow us to send them video with text explination as to why we suspect it. There would too many reports to file through? Then get the community involved! Sony and Microsoft handle reports on console? Bullshit! PS4 LITERALLY tells you to USE THE INGAME REPORT FEATURE to report bad behaviour in game! Ubi DOES handle console reporting. They just couldnt give less of a shit about console players. HOWEVER, this crack down on ddos shows promise. Hopefully this is a sing that their willing to fix isseus with console.
---
people specify Canadian and American accents all the time.

I‚Äôm talking like a white button up, jeans, sunglasses, sandals probably lol. Blending into the surroundings as a civilian. Maybe saying blending with terrorists was a wrong descriptor.

The sad part is no I'm not the only one who likes to chat half the time I'm not even the 1 talking when he starts yelling or if I am I'm usually making a call out.

 I have to ask seriously why  Is everyone so hell bent on defending him here I understand that everyone likes to rely on sound but you can't sit here and tell me that he isn't ridiculous
---
Ubisoft: glaz is too strong as an entry fragger

Also Ubisoft: gives glaz literal frags
---
Also on pc
---
Until u bring it to a convention and get banned

I agree, this is shit. We need an Echo Elite

What the fuck...

How come you were able to record when he got banned but unable to take a screenshot and post it? Cmon :/

As someone who uses Rook a lot and loves the P9 I gotta say I'm jealous. But, hey that's the world right? Another man's trash is another man's treasure as they say.

His gun needs to say ‚Äùno pain, no gain‚Äù in Russian and his gun shield needs to say Cyka in neon letters acrossed the side windows. The MVP animation is him just standing in that pose while glowing, ending with a red flash from his eyes as 64 layers of his turret audio slowly grows louder

yeah just destroy it before you get yelled at by police for carrying a dummy bomb since they dont give a shit about video game cosplay when they see what looks like a bomb from a distance
---
By far the simplest and most obvious solution to this problem is to just enable mouse and keyboard support on consoles. Manually reviewing thousands of reports isn't feasible.
---
Man that is awesome. If you like Thermite, that is.
---
No damn way, unless they wanna revert ranked and unranked back to how it used to be, which in my opinion is better that the current pro league settings.
---
Every time I see a video likes this I turn on the volume expecting to hear the exacts words "How's that not a head shot?" and I'm never disappointed
---
Plz don't say that :( I am cav main...
---
Oh no its soooo lewd.
---
&gt;Casual just isn't the same
---
There's a mode called Unranked that is litterally Ranked without ranks .-.
---
Yes
---
Tnx man :)
---
i got recruit in defense::D killed 4 of the hunters
---
Have you seen the bandit one yet?
---
Alright I'll make sure to work on that, but tnx for the feedback bro :)
---
were u playing valkyrie or warden... WITH RED DOT?!
---
Yes. Also cute
---
The amount of people adding "noise" gadgets is alarming, and until ubi fixes the damn sound, all of these are virtually useless

I had something similar happen when I vaulted not a mozzie and he phased through a wall.

The Telekom has answered what could be the problem. It's apparently a combined issue between Ubisoft and Telekom.

My very First pack in the game was a Black Ice and I thought "ehi cool, kinda nice skin"... Rng is rng
---
Update: bought the game, played some situations then jumped straight into Casual. Bought Rook and saving up for ash now.
---
Really enjoying it
---
Cheers guys
---
I have this same problem with Halo 5. I‚Äôm happy with my platinum rank but it‚Äôs frustrating when every game I‚Äôm playing against diamonds and onyxs while my team is made up of silvers and unrankeds. I feel your pain

depends on your play style. If you can give me a brief description of how you like to play the game and your forte then I can make some recommendations based off of that

If the gun wasnt absolutely worthless at medium to high distances ...
---
And then there is me with 600h and 1 black ice
---
Bruh I‚Äôm like level 110 and don‚Äôt have a single black ice.
---
Also takes me 3 years to get each pack, often going over 50%. 
---
This makes me angry but also happy for you.
---
Congrats.
---
I would love to see game modes such as gun game and one in the chamber. Or at least the possibility of making custom games like that.

What about your opinion, who do you prefer? i have nomad and im thinking about getting kaid
---
Just a dude who plays R6s with pineapple... *and other things.*
---
You seem to be missing both a BOSG.12.2 and an ACOG.
---
I don‚Äôt want it removed because it can do good sometimes like getting rid of teamkillers etc

Get mozzie on defence he is incredible

IS it actually an issue that will be resolved or is it quiet "by design" ?

Is that a tissue on the table?

You must really like Kaid....

Or Artilla....

Or old people in general....

I would say its game design. I‚Äôm playing this since beginning and they never changed it‚Äôs sound design.
---
And thats a fact
---
r/mildlypenis
---
Caveira had spent time in jail and she ws in trouble before joining team rainbow so her elite makes no sense
---
It really is that simple. All other operators are made up.
---
VTK should not be removed, because it's also needed in some situations. It would be nice, if you do not see the VTK, at least in the Action Phase. That is frustratinag

It‚Äôs the facial expression isn‚Äôt it?

It‚Äôs too holy.

Blitz has been fucking people since day one, ofc Kimi would choose Sins
---
I'd like this, but the name needs some work makker.
---
*ba dum tss*
---
There can be only one
---
it will be reused guns and I can see the attacker getting Jackal's PDW9 and a shotgun or an LMG.
---
they go with guns nobody uses so it might be the PDW9 and something like the M870 shotgun the germans use or Zofia's LMG.
---
You need to remove Minecraft and Fortnight from your PC

If they see this clip they won‚Äôt explain, they‚Äôll just take the spot your at out altogether lmao.
---
Okay, but why on earth would you do that with the reddot which has the biggest reticle in the entire game?
---
Would be neat if she used the MP5, or HK416 as primary, and P226 as a secondary considering those are the weapons the BBE/UIM actually use.
---

---
Firstly I‚Äôm not russian or slav.
---
Secondly Before I posted here I had searched this issue in Google and I found nothing especially for ember rise season. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking here. There is no need to be toxic ;). Thanks for the link. I‚Äôll check it.
---
Yea. This just seem like "Can I remake this and be a part of it?". Just, you can still use it as inspiration and still make something cool. There's no point in recreating this as it is well done already.
---
NO I'm tired of this lazy fucking excuses they have been using about data limits or licencing if anyone has heard of shot show it is the largest firearms expo in the United States. It is also where ALOT of weapon companies go to show off thier new toys and prototypes. Gaming companies also go to this expo looking to recieve licencing to use some of these weapons in thier games. I've been too the expo twice and actually seen game devs TURN DOWN companies offering to GIVE them lisencing to use thier weapon because it's basicly free advertising. The with data limits oh but you can continue to add new operators every three months and a new map every six months. Come on don't event try these weak ass excuses it comes down to laziness. There are other shooters with FAR more weapons in it then siege but they don't have anywhere near the problems Ubisoft claims they are having with siege. Of we get another set of operators with reused weapons I will be EXTREMELY surprised if the player count doesn't DROP by a couple million. I personally stopped playing three season ago even though I still follow the game I don't play. However when I did play my most favorite aspect of the game was learning and mastering new guns. And it's the same for ALOT of players and if Ubisoft doesn't start replacing some of these reused guns with new ones or give the next operators new guns for the next few season players will start leaving because the gun play will become stale with the same old weapons being used by every operator.
---
Why clash, shes one of the easiest counters in the game, and cav is not that good anymore if you know about her
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt take it out of the house at all. With the climate today someone could easily mistake that for a real device and you don‚Äôt want that trouble.
---
It's alot better than what it used to be, plus I don't think you understand how hard it is to fix something sometimes
---
Nah it‚Äôs a good idea but mis match party‚Äôs creates too large of a skill gap unfortunately
---
It has breasts. You are safe.

Gravity
---
I really thought this was Apex Legends forever
---
Actually, yeah :) if you have ‚Äûlow-latency mode‚Äú enabled (on or ultra) in your NVIDIA system preferences, try disabling it, restart your pc and try launching the game. Doesn‚Äôt happen to me anymore since I disabled it.

It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs also not a gu because that‚Äôs lesion

I still hate how terrorists will move or spawn outside the building. I mean seriously ill clear a floor and climb out a window to breach the next floor and a bunch of terrorists will walk around the corner from the edge of the map and light me up. Seriously just stop.
---
*Is it possible to learn this power?*
---
No, it's okay. Even if its not perfect id like it to be my own work
---
**SOLOUTION:**
---
Disabling the ‚Äûlow latency mode‚Äú in the NVIDIA system preferences actually fixed the issue for me. Don‚Äôt forget to restart your pc once you disabled it. You have to turn it off. Ultra and On will cause this issue for me.
---
The mp7 might need to get swapped since all attackers dont use smgs besides nokk who was gonna have a ar but eas too strong for her. The name could be Zues. Since when he activates his gadet he will be leaving your ears ringing. Also the drone gadget would need a buff simce most people can tap drones out of the air and off the floors.
---
That's spooky!
---
When some does a DOS attack it sends these "packets" which goes into the servers causing major lag to the point where you cannot move at all or you just get completely kicked off because the server couldn't handle the stress put on it.
---
I mean, to be fair it‚Äôs a seasonal event to have fun with. Not to be taken so serious. If I was an attacker and saw defenders glitched in the box I‚Äôd laugh. But if it happened that often they‚Äôd probably fix it (but maybe not since it‚Äôs only up for so many more days)
---
As far as I know, hit boxes of objects in certain areas are gone for whatever reason, causing the drone to go through the world. I‚Äôve had stuff happen where somehow the velocity of the drone speed, plus it getting crunches into an angle in oddly specific places will cause it to jam itself through part of the map.
---
So it's a guy with a guided missile on wheels. Interesting concept. The gadget could be called something like √≥pote e√≠nai ekriktik√≥, which is the phonetical translation of 'wheely explosive' in greek (i just think wheely explosive would be quite a funny name for an explosive drone). Cant think of an operator name.
---
Either you missed, or the grid is like the magic vibranium posts on some stair cases.

Yeah that confused me too but hey who knows

Zofia
---

---
Last time i checked, the entire unit consisted of men.

I love the name
---
Clickity clack get into my sack
---
It‚Äôs nothing like that. Tower is trash and zofia is great. Your opinion doesn‚Äôt affect whether or not a map is balanced
---
why? whats so bad about it?
---
Why do you have it so bright?
---
I played on console after chimera season and besides the seasonal game breaking bug, the only real issue was the toxic COD level community.
---
And then there's gridlock.
---
made with mematic
---
I feel for you, I prefer casual for its more laid back environment. I'm sure your teammate is annoying to play with, I personally don't like playing with tryhards that get ticked at their teammates for anything. I'm really not defending him for his behavior. I do utilize sound but you're not going to see me yell st my teammates. So I get it.
---
I do still use sound just as anyone does. And I love the idea of more sound based operators because I know how important sound is in siege.
---
This fucking MMR Cap is fucking stupid I had afew shit placement matches and now I can't play with any of my friends (all plats) so I just don't play it
---
No no, it's enabled but it will kill friendlies and opfor alike, its basically a tossup as to who dies to the roomba
---
Game sharing siege on steam does not work, as it is using Uplay and not actually steam.
---
Just bad map design it isn't fun to play or balanced. Some maps are fun but not balanced like house but tower is just garbage just like favela atleast plane is fun.
---
I personally loved it imo. Its really fun when they chase after you but if you hide like a pussy then it isnt fun from what i experience
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

LWAY? More like YIAY

Real funny
---
Yes but how the fuck do you like tower. I have literally never met anyone that has liked tower. That fact that you like tower is like saying that tachanka is not a God, or favela needs more soft destruction. Some opinions are just wrong, and yours is just wrong. Tower is statically one of the worst maps in the game to play. Tower can get fucked by ubi and deleted, and 99% of the community would celebrate. That said they still shouldnt add a leave match button cause leaving matches is a dick move. When I get tower, I instead only play recruit because I refuse to try on that map.
---
Yeet

Respect this person for what he did! No seriously i love it

Cheating is worse than zero sum. It works to their benefit if the fallout from their fraud falls outside of their own sphere of influence - which it can do as long as short-sighted idiots try to cut corners by picking the lowest bid above all other considerations - but [when your own civilisation is built on the same shoddy foundation...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XopSDJq6w8E)

It's way easier to do it that way, they already have the model. Making sprites out of it would be expensive.

yessss

it doesnt really mean that some1 is tryhard if they kill u, they just toxic and thinks its funny to kill teammates

Kills on attack ? Argh, I usually get more on defense...

Couldn't find it on the website so I just assumed it was from the in-game bio.

Is that while downloading or after? I know it compresses it to an extent. I just know mine broke 100 when i had to redownload :(

I'm not proud to say that I've 100% done this before.

Still won‚Äôt be able to play her in ranked...

My free pack was all waiting for me anyone else not get theirs?

No theres 2 1 week challenges

I mean its probably the texture pack im on pc and yet siege is still only about 70 gigs

Damn i thought it was 1 two week challenge

What a friendly little machine, great smile :]

This is why we ban you

Not true. Very false. Most of the time it‚Äôs so they can shit on players worse than them

Oh, I understand now, my bad! Now my comment seems like a jerk move...

"normal spot" - this normal spot not only won't allow you to toss C4 over the beds - you will also be more vulnerable from the window position and corridor. How come Valve can fix common bugs in matter of hours when someone posts 'em on reddit, yet Ubi literally takes months to fix something that small, yet gamebreaking?
---
thank you, i‚Äôm not sure why they mentioned that then, it wasn‚Äôt a jerk move you were just helping, thanks nevertheless

I probably wouldn't be able to get a maestro elite tho.

Two challenges. the timer on the event pack in the Ubisoft club is separate to that of the event itself. You had 7 days to complete challenge one. You now have another week to complete challenge two.

The only weird thing is, that I didn't get one of those MMR-messages that would reset some of the rank points due to this, which is weird cause my friend and I literally played all matches together and he got MMR back. Bad luck, I guess?

I think starting with a change in team size (smaller or larger idrc) would be a good place to start because it will either force them to make bigger or smaller maps and change how the operators are made.

Calm down inbred

Ah I see. Thank you very much for clearing that up. I Ela a lot but didn't realize her mines could fight Monty. Thanks!

Lion is just exhausted from carrying his team
---
Huh so this is why hes banned
---
Almost. It's an old glitch that can be done on many different maps and spots.  It is triggered by one player vaulting onto another in such a way that there is not enough space left for the person being vaulted onto on the other side and so the game forces him away, sometimes through impassable walls. It needs to be done with players from different teams due to collision mechanics and is therefore very rare to see in matchmaking but aboslutely possible. In a custom game it is really easy to replicate in certain spots.
---
Understood. Thank you very much!

No China!  Bad! No hacks!

Ash is also there but she is just exhausted from all the running and dying first

yeah or, dont use it at all.

Remember, No Russian

Nope

European?

Thank you very much for clearing that up. Didn't know Ying changed like that. And sadly, considering how much I play Ying, I also learned from you that I can hold the nade &gt;&lt;
---
Regarding #2, so the idea is: I hear Thermite/Hibana. I put down battery and pick it up right away. Right before I pick it up, Thatcher sees the wall electrify for a sec and throws grenade. But since I pick it up right before the EMP grenade hits, he wastes the grenade.
---
That.... seems like a lot of trouble and difficult to pull off?
---
the background is  more blurred that the elite image , also we can see the regular caveira in the blurred background? i stil feel its a fake .
---
Cringe
---
Make maps larger so we can snipe. Two teams start on opposite sides of the map, one bomb in the middle that the teams have to fight over/secure and then plant in the other team‚Äôs starting point/base. One life per round, teams of up to 8. No offense/defense, no being stuck inside a building. No special operator abilities or perks, just pick your load out and maybe some cosmetics like camo and gear appearance. *Maybe* even make everyone 2 armor/2speed across the whole lobby.
---
Just basically give me what SOCOM was but 1st person and with siege mechanics. Are you listening u/its_epi? I would throw walls of fucking money at ubisoft for this.
---
Meanwhile still waiting for Mountain boy elite
---
It‚Äôs like when that awkward kid in high school says he‚Äôs slept with 12 girls, but you know it‚Äôs more like zero
---
I only remember who I got them with
---
I really don‚Äôt know what that means, you‚Äôre gonna have to really break it down
---
You‚Äôre welcome, if you haven‚Äôt watched it I‚Äôd recommend it maybe you‚Äôll be able to see more of a difference.
---
XD
---
I think this is ubisofts way of countering leaving mid interrogation
---
Pacifists dont hurt under Any and All circumstances 
---
This is why we cant have nice things
---
What you said makes sense. People commenting in here are brainlets. The ranked system means the better team wins. Banning affects everyone.
---
I think the bundle is called Spring Break or something like that. Ash has a hat that says "SPRING BREAK" on it, and I think the charm is a sea star.

No it isn't, it's just lazy writing

KOBE! 
---
*beeping intensifies*
---
Ok my bad
---
Ah I see. That makes sense. I'll definitely get some practice in trying that. Thanks!
---
Thanks for the good idea for speeding up defense rounds.
---
Probably because you lagged while your drone was spawning. Since they drop when you  spawn which lead to the server getting  confused and like maybe not loading the floor or not registering that you landed. Probs something like this
---
**\[rEdAcTed\]**
---
Such unique character, so redacted
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
I mean the challenges are the kind of challenges that you can complete by just playing normally.
---
As a tachanka maine I can agree
---
I agree. It‚Äôs actually way more run and gun than siege. But it‚Äôs closer to that than past cods which is why I‚Äôm enjoying MW so much. I want a slow pace and fast ttk, it rewards awareness, which siege has trained me into
---
They changed it but atleast they're only 1000 each
---
Sledge is gonna give it 5 pounds
---
You use too get them for free but now r6 is making you use recruit to test the worse version of guns (no attachments) before (technically) buffing your fav gun with attachments
---
Yeah obviously it's a lot more run and gun than Siege, but I think using situational awareness is key to that game and not a lot of that player base is very used to it. Hence why they complain
---
No. You no longer them automatically. You have to unlock them with in-game currency. The *only edition* that would grant you the operators would be the Uplay+ version.
---
5v4. Check
---
Everyone in lobby has teamkilled. Check
---
Doc and Rook for spawn peeking on a casual game. Check
---
Yup, seems what you have here is a typical casual game on console.
---
Seriously? What ever thanks for your help.
---
Exactly my thoughts, glad I‚Äôm not alone in it
---
Image being a weeb and trying to defend this cancer lmaooooo.
---
Oh so this is the new tachanka
---
She has a deployable turret that has a shield and has a passive ability where she can control all horny males in the area. 
---
Oh and the rating is now 18
---
Is this specifically with normal Alpha Packs? Try restarting your game.
---
Sounds like an excuse from Ubi to make more money
---
hanging up the dokk call
---
Yup. The one elite everyone needs
---
Oh boy toxic levels bout to hit the ceiling
---
Dope!
---
Pretty much any M1911 is a good stand in.
---
right....
---
ranked or cas?
---
It was just really frustrating being in that subreddit. Like they ripped the game to shreds. Not saying it doesn't have issues, but they're the wrong issues.
---
This subreddit isn't very toxic compared to most other communities I've been in
---
The pathfinder ops (that didn‚Äôt came out in any season) are technically free because they cost renown which you can‚Äôt get from real money and you can only get it from playing games or situations
---
Ranked I want to grind
---
Haha buddy you're not offending me one bit, all you are is a racist little bitch so.
---
I‚Äôd stat check that, because they both have really good primaries.
---
Ranked but i haven't played rainbow for I think 2 weeks or more so I have to improve my aim at first and so on
---
Oh dude no doubt. There‚Äôs some netcode issues, but the siege content creators I watch really enjoy the game. And they beg for things that would be ridiculous (ie silent step as a PERK not ability) without factoring in balance. It seems very shallow compared to the siege community
---
Lol image thinking being a weeb is a race lmaoooo.
---
Suck my pp
---
I havent played in 2 months at least so thats why im asking - i will most likely suck
---
Or i could play on my trusty theater tv with inbuilt netflix *edit* plus it only costed me 100$ for 3 years Netflix a mini theater with surround sound and a really good projector
---
tachanka rework?
---
I‚Äôll try
---
I wasn't trying to say that MW is like siege; it's definitely a much more casual game. It's all about what you're comparing it to. Compared to siege, it's very casual. But compared to the earlier cod games, it requires a different skill set and is much slower and more methodical. A game can change without changing its target audience. Take the jetpacks introduced in cod-as controversial as those were due to their unrealism, they helped enhance the speed of the gameplay and gunfights, making it different while still appealing to the casual crowd. I can agree that as a series it is very prone to stagnation and lack of change between titles (mostly due to the absurd yearly releases). But given the consistency of its appeal, MW's sudden shift in appeal to those who more enjoy slow, strategic gameplay is a pretty significant shift in tone sure to alienate several members of the community. It's not because they don't like change, it's that they don't like the direction mw changed towards
---
Sure, it can activate indoors, it just can‚Äôt during the warmup, to avoid getting easy kills
---
i mean the claymore cant kill doc if he is 140 hp
---
I mean tbh recruit does have some uses like being able to use the m860 on attack and the ability to have two secondary gadgets
---
I would stop responding to this guy, it‚Äôs like talking to a concrete wall
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what i was was thinking, maybe i didn‚Äôt express it right
---
...because frost, ela, and lesion don't have nitro
---
"Been grinding..." or is it just r6 credits?
---
Bruh
---
Hope it doesn‚Äôt get banned
---
Wow. That's a details but I hope Ubi's gonna adress it at some point. It kinda sucks to aim to be one of the top games but have this kind of mistakes
---
Cause smurfing isn't a bannable offense?
---
OK but we can grind I haven't played also ranked for 2 weeks or more
---
Just Bugisoft doing Bugisoft things.

He is not worthy

Bought 600 credits, but the rest with renown. Opened 18 packs so far.
---
Remember when they said they would only give Defenders with one speed Acogs not too long ago
---
I'm only looking for mates in rainbow 6 for me it isn't really important which rank you are. We can grind and learn from both of us
---
He mained tachanka and did well, don't try it

250$ total 100 for the projector and screen and 150 for the ps4

The Asian community summarized that she did not look Asian, or that she lacked Asian facial features. They also complained that she had an "emo" vibe.

One could say, Goy o goy is that clever

as in boomah
---
\*When your 4 stack has to carry the random that's throwing
---
How about instead of being drones its a grenade that deploys those drones into a room and constantly scaning the enemys auto maticly so they have a choice try to destroy 6 drones that move side to side constantly or focus on the enemy while getting scanned.
---
I‚Äôm saying that the gadget skin would be the holograms‚Äô uniforms would be the same as the the elite uniform
---
At least you can directly buy the elite..why ubisoft :(
---
Ok, I had a feeling that it wasn't just a grind
---
I would switch the smg 12 with the cz75 and the carbine with the Aug, but overhaul I like it
---
I can‚Äôt stop laughing at this I‚Äôve watched it like 30 times
---
That is so painfully relatable. Even worse when it's a 3 stack and one person leaves and the other person tries to throw

Give it up folks, einstein over here has something to say. What's that buddy? Wha- A grammatical error?!? WHAT?!? B... Bu... That can't be possible! Surely not! A GRAMMAR MISTAKE? IN **MY** SIGHT?!? What a great, absolute miracle that you and your 257 IQ Brain was here to correct it! Thank you! Have my grattitude, Actually, What's your cashapp? I'd like to give you 20$... Know what?

Also, my Paypal username and password is: Ilikesmartazzes4 and 968386329. Go have fun. Thank you for your work.Ôªø
---
Thanks!, so casual is more beginner friendly?
---
I mean, it's 2 out of 18 packs, but yeah ok. It's pretty hard to do with just renown you know?
---
I do that in ranked sometimes
---
A buncha lemmings
---
Basically Homeless is the Chance the Rapper of Siege
---
I mean... you're not wrong. I play it (free) just to pass time on lunch breaks. I've been playing it less and less as the game favors dlc supporters the higher you rank up.
---
If he has to do all that wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to just take a picture with his phone?
---
THANKS MAN
---
O okay, thanks for the info, will be playing a lot of casual then:)
---
Pc people can aim
---
Yeah but in like 7 or 8 days and 12k per pack or 11.5k with the pass. It kinda seems impossible unless you already had renown stacked up
---
id recommend playing casual till you‚Äôre level 50-70 then play ranked. ranked will teach you a bit, but don‚Äôt play to early as it may be a bit to difficult
---
holy fuck dude learn some basic fucking English
---
you're*
---
too*
---
Do you always overreact this way to a joke?
---
You need help.
---
They said that over 2 years ago. I wouldn't consider that "not to long ago". The state of the game and how the game is played has changed a lot since Operation Health.
---
Give us some attacker elites ffs
---
Language
---
maybe it‚Äôs your internet? and plus the servers aren‚Äôt ubisoft‚Äôs servers lol so you can‚Äôt really blame the game developers
---
ok but who cares about console, that shit is stupid
---
I'm just going to put the preemptive "ur internet suks"
---
Looks like Velma from Scooby Doo
---
language what lmao, this is reddit, not club penguin
---
Yes, but if the host's bandwidth is full it will mess with the ping of the clients, which is how a ddos works
---
Okay thanks!, will try to get to that level!
---
Well i mained tachanka too
---
add salviothegreat
---
See everything better when there isn't any bad language
---
My grandpa kept saying she looked like a scooby doo villain too lol
---
yeah, but ubi doesn't fix the servers, so even if my internet is a bit unstable, the problem is the ping
---
no, not really
---
No fucking way
---
Players play wildly different. Ranked players are incredibly aggresive and will make ultra risky plays for picks, whereas in pro league people are FAR more reserved and strategic in their play.
---
Whom shaln't proceed
---
iS tHiS a JoJo ReFeReNcE??/????/??/

but this is fanmade and _she_ is the defender, the attacker is K9

My god, he's still typing...

I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH AN UNLUCKY SHOT IN MY FUCKING LIFE LMAOOOOO. you hit at the very last PIXEL of his head, bullet passes through hits shoulder, blood comes out of what looks like his head (siege just has very explosive blood). All in all that's just extremely unlucky... very last fuckin pixel, that shits hilarious

Ye tbh it gives everyone a sense of surprise and I think Ubi has been hoping for this for a while.

shrug

but it is definitely the season pass, i have it as well after purchasing it
---
I did not wich is why I'm wondering
---
Why does it sound like something badger would say

That is strange

People who leave games to do challenges faster shouldn‚Äôt do the challenges

No its for season 4. I don‚Äôt have the link but they said for season 4

i expected some mouthbreathing neckbeard shit in this video. instead i got some laughs

2 options: ask steam to remove the game from your library, then rebuy it. Don't know if that will be processed before the sale ends tho.
---
Other option, buy the deluxe edition on Uplay. Since you have the base game on Siege you will still update via Steam but I would think that it simply unlocks those ops on your account.

2/3 match did that so i'll just stop playing it

That's just completely and utterly incorrect. It's 100% per account, console does not matter at all.

If i were to fix one super annoying bug, or glitch, or just something annoying, it would have to be when you break/shoot a barricade piece and it just sticks... doesn't move or fall out, just sits there and ruins your line of sight
