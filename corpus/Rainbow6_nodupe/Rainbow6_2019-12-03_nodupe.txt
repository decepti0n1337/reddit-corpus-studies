I've played a lot of FPS games in my life and have been high ranked in most of them, so the aim isn't my issue
---
I'm fine with starting off from bronze and climbing while learning camera placements, map movement, hatch locations and efficient wallbangs+game knowledge, i don't mind getting a low rank and climbing and won't be discouraged by it
---
What i am discouraged by is is the game punishing me for no reason
---
I dont mind getting a disconnect if my internet goes down for a second, not every game is Dota where you have 30 seconds to get your internet back, i dont understand why the hell i don't have the option to reconnect
---
In Tower you basically spawn above defenders so they can't spawnkill you. In other maps, I know it's frustrating because I never spawnpeek and I hate who does it, but I understood that it's just in the game mechanics so I stopped getting angry at them and started blaming myself for not being ready to counter it.

This is cursed

"KYS" is in the list of phrases that trigger automated punishment. That'd probably be why.

I don’t play on PC but I talk to a bunch of high rank PC players and they say she’s fine. The scorpion can be controlled, the shotgun is still fine after the TTS nerf and her gadget is good. On console, I see her all the time. So no, I don’t think she’s “barely functioning” but whatever you say.
---
Not sure what you're replying to but I like your name and I like the fact you said nonce.

I upvoted but more importantly, I want you to know I respect you.

It's a common issue these past few weeks. Only thing you can do is keep opening and closing the uplay client until it works

I kind of just do this for fun. And idk. I've never tried it lol

Damn it why am I always too late

They sure did ;)
---
Bro, I have all the fucking operators, I was joking
---
Amazing animation.
---
He makes S of his gas :D
---
Yeah, she is
---
Hard disagree. Higher levels of play are extremely gunskill heavy. CS is a lot like siege with the same sorts of tactical gameplay but DM is very popular among pros in that. Siege is just as much about gunskill as strategy.
---
Not true. If you force yourself out of your comfort zone and play more aggressively or take more chances on one account vs not being able to on the other shows the difference. I dont define myself based on my numbers, but on my playstyle and impact I make in the game.
---
Thanks for the help. I have not been able to get on in the past day because of this issue

Pro tip: use drones to gather intel on where you plan to enter, while also spawing close to where you intend to enter.

I was just thinking swagger isn't the type to go as light as "commit die"

Yeah but its the first time ( I think) an major update released a Tuesday. Normally it’s a Wednesday or a Thursday.

I don’t get why people freak out that much, like we don’t know more than they do. Also what 2-3 days change in your life.
---
People like you are the reason I die in 2 seconds.
---
Yes! And turn off pay to win operators like ash or rook. They are unfair to people who were too slow to pick them. Also both teams should start  on attacking. Better balance. Also make every operator Thatcher.
---
The cosplay looks sick as fuck.
---

Just a joke sorry

Headshots and, naturally, higher dps weapons are quick kills with good aim

No need to apologize, just now realized that my reply kinda sounded aggressive. So, sorry on my end.

"pretending" yeah thats why Ash is already almost dead.  lmao.

Ok cunt

Im lazy

he probably stole this from insta or just cropped out the creators name.
---
You/the community went into a bug reporting portal and reported something thats "As per design" thing thats not a bug in in anyway shape or form. 
---
If you want changes like adding an acog to a bosg, you need to use other social media sites like twitter, reddit or ubi forms. 
---
The devs are 100% in the right to close this BUG ticket since its not a bug, its a design choice.
---
I'm just as surprised as you are
---
Did the community ever give recruit a first name?
---
This is called luck not skill
---
Granted, but he cant move while shifting and its extremly loud, theme music starts plating and it takes 45 seconds to shift and it lasts 30 seconds
---
Man this guy is good, been hitting shots for about two minutes straight
---
That’s...that’s the joke bud
---
I think it would be a neat idea, i would make it bullet proof but mute should counter a camera, and kaid and bandit can destroy it so better bring the new op or thatcher
---
Can we talk about the fact that you can't control jagers gun
---
You haven’t lived until you solve a sudoku puzzle

i cant control any gun tbh

It came out yesterday

They’re pretty fun you should give it a shot
---
also u can get sieege cheaper on uplay. I would recomend getting  the game on uplay. You can use uplay points to get 20% of the price. Even on items which have sale on them.
---
Yeah no doubt I’ll be sure to
---
#HAPPY BIRTHDAY :D
---
I’m still here bruh it’s all good
---
It comes out tmr
---
Ahh, I see. Sorry for making an assumption. The reconnect, I have no idea. On both pc and Xbox, I have almost always been able to reconnect, the times that I cannot are because other people joined.(I had friends in the lobby who told me so)
---
I’m going to be brutal, 3 or 5, 3 if it’s just the revolver, 5 if it’s a universal, it would be better if it was steel or silver instead of gold, but it is just personal opinion.

---
Most of high ranks play casual bcuz they want warmup , and casual system looks at ur rank and lvl so most likely u wont face high plat  with lvl 200+ if u are bronze and lvl 100

Siege is a competitive shooter, not some P2W cheese that rewards wearing retarded camos.
---
Will we ever get the option to turn off RFF when a teammate is downed? As it stands, being downed by a teammate will incur RFF on them and offers no prompt to forgive them or not. I understand it's meant to counter some nastiness (unsure as to what exactly, I just know it was mentioned when RFF came out), but as you can down someone and then kill them while they are going into the downed position, it's made for some slight frustration in matches. I can't count the times I've been killed by myself because a teammate walked in front of my spray and I down-kill them before I can react. I understand it's not a huge issue, but some QoL on that would be nice.
---
I mean I’m plat one and it’s nice to jump into a casual game now and then just to chill and relax. I personally have fun in casual. Use ops I usually don’t and try different attachments and guns and what not
---
Fuck CTUs can we get some Army Rangers
---
This has to go up so ubi sees it
---
F
---
if youre so bad at the game, why bring yourself to keep playing casuals?  they don't sweat, trust me. so go play ur lower ranked games if you don't wanna play plats/diamonds that are trying to chill
---
For what
---
If you didn’t sweat so hard in casual you wouldn’t be playing plats who are messing around
---
What happened lol
---
MMR on smurfs is usually bunk. Over time when they reach higher levels theyll start equalizing but im mostly concerned with how unranked starts you out in mid gold ranks and its unfair to squad me up with or against people with no map knowledge
---
I knocked both in obj and killed them with prismas
---
/r/SiegeAcademy/
---
Of course, I screamed yeet as I threw it
---
(The real) Spoit already tweeted about this guy and I (alongside with some others) reported him already to the Ubisoft support. Won’t be long before he gets banned. The only issue is it won’t change anything. This guy will probably just get another account and do it all over again. We really need hardware bans in siege.
---
Are you old enough to play siege
---
This is actually a very common thing I. Players called attacker paralysis. You fee overwhelmed by what could happen so you end up not being able to do much at all. I’ve found personally that the best way to deal with this is simply get in and try to get a kill or two and then go from there. You either die or you end up making a big difference. The important thing is just to try and see what happens.
---
He was just watching our Bosg 1v1
---
No I was bored i wasn't trying my hardest
---
Why do I sense you are not respecting this mans talent
---
I tried
---
Use your drone, I honestly don't drone enough but when I'm concerned someone is going to gank me for entering I use my drone or have a teammate I play with who normally drones while I overwatch. 
---
Other than that some other things would be use operators with claymores to help your flank or the operators who help you gain information about enemy locations when you move through the map. 
---
Such as Nomad, Doki-BAE, Lion, Jackal
---
13/2 kd, alright. yeah there just chilling
---
Thank you
---
Unranked as in it's casual but without the ranking system, you should try it sometime
---
Ok think you so much

no

i once told to the buck who was going to throw a nade in the garage drone hole on chalet i said "becareful not to kill yourself"

Very steady especially with the new season tommorow. It's not as fast paced as COD though, gotta be more tactical, but still extremely fun.
---
Took the words from my mouth
---
I'd buy it in bundles 😂😂😂
---
Do it. Worth it. More players than ever. An incredibly competitive pro league with a solid community. Can be toxic at times. Big learning curve, stick it out and you to will be smurfing in newcomer one tapping noobs :p
---
Chonk is looking a lil thin
---
As a capitao main and I approve this message.
---
That’s something that’s being said for years
---
House isn’t supposed to be balanced, it’s the original map before the game became what it was. It stays in casual more as a momento then anything. It will likely never be changed.
---
K just checking
---
Just like Hereford right
---
What is mnk?
---
It definitely has. Today there’s a lot of different ways to propel the pellet and even in just the electric gun category, there’s all kinds of springs, gear systems, motors, and batteries to improve ROF, range, etc.
---
I haven’t played in a while but it’s definitely tons of fun if you’re. I know at least back at my college, we had a club. Y’all carpool to large scale mil-sims and the school funded the club with guns and gear you could use if you couldn’t afford to buy your own. If you have a chance to do one of these, or just go to some local arena with some friends, it really does make for some great memories.
---
You never know, people on this sub are often... limited:
---
You gotta reset the game
---
Thanks for the reply! What about cross-play?

No cross play.
---
Not sure how that's gonna work just yet. Hopefully it won't only be for the new consoles.
---
Just remember comrade at least you took it like a man and one of these days you will be able to flex on them.
---
Mouse and keyboard
---
Too big brain for me
---
Warden can deflash himself, Has a MPX and degle combo for range/dmg or a shotgun to hold corners. 
---
Why would anyone pick this operator over say jager, alibi, vigil or ela for roamer. They all are 3 speeds ( so slightly slower than your OP) but has better gun loadouts and better equipment.
---
It’s probably worse on console where sasg is actually viable
---
Dang. It's a camo that actually camouflages. "Everyone" doesn't hate camos that work, although it's ok to voice why you do not like them.
---
ah, this operator is an attacker my dude, not a defender
---
nice clip
---
yeah, i was kinda trying to see how well i could run with a shitpost and turn it into a semi feasible operator
---
What a chad
---
I play on console. The sasg isn't viable at all
---
Bruh imagine being able to play Siege without stepping on a Gu mine.
---
High plat 2 player here and my advice is keep playing and use ur big brain even if it seems dumb at times. Practice aim on presidential plane disarm bomb (everyone says classic on house but just no) learn how to play off intel, how to bait, stuff like impact tricking/bandit/kaid tricking if you don’t know those things. How to counter those tricks is equally as important. Learn cheeky spawn peeks. As with the big brain comment do stuff people won’t expect obviously I don’t mean sit in a hallway but like dumb corners no one hides in usually under desks etc. Watch high level gameplay and try to replicate it while also being adaptable too. And make sure you play ranked, casual is a toxic wasteland
---
semi shotties haven't been good since skull rain. idk why tf they nerfed that but aight
---
Holy pp
---
This happened to me before, a defender shot at 2 other attackers and wallbanged me by accident getting him a 3k
---
Why would you ever pick an attacker thats limited to pistols that isnt a shield. 
---
Like if your anti roamer line up is Ash, IQ, Zofia, Jackal, Lion or dokki. what scenario would you pick this operator over anyone of those operators. 
---
I get that its a fun thing to dive around with a pistol but if they are to add an operator, the operator needs to bring something to the game. 
---
Attackers are already highly picked for team based utility. Even Ash is picked for her breach chargers these days and then for her frag role.
---
`alert: grammar error detected, engagi-’ nope, not editing that

Hmm. Never seen that

The balance here is that you never know which level you're going to get and you don't blend in everywhere.

I think it's pretty cool that the camo actually works well. R6s has a nice realism feel to it.

It's camo, it's suppose to blend!

Ember Rise homiies
---
Augs IRL don’t need to have their charging handles pulled back and locked to reload. So it really doesn’t matter at all. Once you drop in a fresh mag you can hit the bolt release or yank the charging handle
---
Yea lol
---
runouts are definitely a strategy tho. just like planning your attack route is. if you know they have a thermite and you don't have a bandit, why would you just let them open and take a huge advantage for free? why would you let attackers camp strong windows all day without making them worry about their flank? that's the exact opposite of "tactical", it's stupid.
---
spawnpeeks are pretty bad so i don't really care about them, but again it makes sense, especially when you're coming from a "tactical" standpoint, that carelessly sprinting into hostile territory is pretty fucking stupid.
---

I apologize....

Weeb
---
Yes,why?
---
Great op and super fun to use, I have some advice though, in my opinion, DO NOT USE THE SPEAR
---
Most of what you said make sense. Maybe my issue is really with map design. Maps like Favela, and Plane (understanding they’re not comp maps) put the attackers at such a disadvantage.
---
Why am I not using this potential?
---
Im very sorry
---
Is... is that the Elite Ela? Or, am I missing some awesome cosmetics?
---
It is ok, the headshot at the end of the video was worth it

South Africa
---
same goddamn thing
---
The rate at which the characters move and shoot isn’t realistic. You can’t lean that fast in real life, can’t weapon swap right left left right that quick. 
---
The movement isn’t really specific either, in the game you hover behind the wall, while in real life you will most likely slight hold or hand peak. 
---
Also while shooting, recoil designated by a game isn’t realistic either. (Spray patterns and dumb shit like that). 
---
Plugging real body movement, shock and comprehension into a simulation of siege would be extremely difficult.
---
That was unexpected
---
Das nice,

I hoped that would at least happen, but nope. It stayed reinforced

Oh, well goodbye from UK.

Very difficult mission it is.

I came from Battlefield 4 and I try to convice my mate to join in Siege but they don't. They think Siege is a camper game so they don't like it.

So I soloqueue and I find many players in game and until now they become my mates in Siege.

You know that that picture doesn't proof anything? You could just remove the cable connected from the controller to the adapter.. Unfortunately, its that easy to get and use a MnK on console.
---
Haha!
---
This.  When i switched to pc from xbox(high gold-plat)   the change in randoms was stunning.  Communication,  good sportsmanship. No run outs or super aggressive players. It was the type of gameplay i love in siege.  I miss it. I legit was sad once i hit level 30.  I didn't want to go.
---
After storming in and dying, Rook was the first to say clutch or kick lol.
---
That shouldn’t make a noise in the first place. Come on.
---
Don't remind me of the monster I truly am!
---
Pass those plates around
---
I have nicely developed ears but either by the fact I can focus the hearing of a particular sound in a noisy room, still the fact I can't hear my muscles moving, why would an external person do from such a far distance? Doc is a doctor, don't think he has joints problems.
---
You have no proof shhh
---
MP5
---
Blackbeard is gonna fucking piss himself
---
Wamai allows you to play reactionary instead of mostly pre planting all your utility. Also do not dismiss the idea of turning attackers equipment against themselves. Last second rush, flashes, capitao flames etc all explode in their own face. 
---
Since they still make no sound I'm sure a bunch of emp's will be pulled away from their target (could be huge on inside walls mostly) where jagers ads would often he spotted
---
Better get working on that fireplace then LUL

You yourself said they were overpriced in your first comment retard... I dont hate my life at all.... Do you own a company beacuse you act like you know soooo much about it. Im not "crying" that I cant buy and overpriced shitty vigil skin. I hate the game and everythimg it stands for more and more. People like you that play the game and support shitty buissness practisies in gaming are fucking retards. Why do you care so much about a multimillion dollar company? Oh booh fucking hoo they cant make as much money because they charge overpriced skins. Your the one crying. Crying for some sort of blowjob from a ubi exec with your speak you bumbiling repetitive child. Your not laughing hard at all... your not even laughing. Why would you be laughing? What is so funny? Is it that I support the consumer and you the multi million dollar company for no other reason because they made sigie? Thats funny.changing the price of one skin to be more in line with others will not kill ubi unless thier whole company sits on the assets of one vigil skin they dont moron. You keep bringing this up about a big company and it going under if I worked there. Like I said nintendo and IO do it fine why cant ubi. You are the most blind sigtard on the subreddit second to the people that belive operation y4s2 was good. Fuck of and go back to your ubisoft shrine and burn money in front of it, you deep level scum fuck.
---
Damn dude. I’m playing on a MacBook Pro with a 750m and I thought I had it bad. Getting a consistent 60fps at 1080p would be life changing for you haha
---
Just fucking turn him into a cyborg already, Ubi
---
Team kill the Fuze smh
---
But it does, so I would want to hear it.
---
The clothes make noise.
---
His accent has more offensive capabilities than any weapon.
---
Highly specific, highly accurate
---
Something tells me Nikita from Battlestate Games, the devs that made Escape from Tarkov, is everywhere now...
---
Yeah I mean I'm just angry right now. I love this game to death but this has been an issue for the past 2-3 years.
---
Ubisoft support always says they are looking into it etc etc but it's just the typical copy paste answer and they never seem to actually care.
---
I have never ever seen sound consistency addressed and it's hard to get "proof" of it happening because you would have to be recording every single hour of playing you do which I can't with my current setup.
---
I just posted it once? that's strange
---
My friend always spawnpeaks with Caveira
---
Mozzie and Kanal, loved to see an actual 9mm chambered AR-15(and i don't count PDW9) and that map getting a facelift (along with a second bridge).
---
We could see it twice.
---
All attakers
---
3 armor 1 speed defenders
---
Like it used to be.
---
At the end- he just stood there... menacingly...
---
Still won't beat the f2 though.
---
He's long over due for a gadget rework and a change to 2-2 IMO, he'll never work in his current state.
---
He has the accent *and* the f2
---
It lowers the more you play in a season, at the start of the next season you should be getting the 70-80 points.
---
Wasn't y4 where they were releaseing a series of sound fix updates? I remember burnt horizon saw one update. Not sure what happened after that.
---
50/50 sometimes I’m bullying idiotic players sometimes I’m meming w friends
---
But he's no twitch.
---
Full reload cocking is a *slap*.
---
That is strange indeed
---
One small point, if they are on comms making callouts all game and you aren't, and you have more kills, it could be because you can hear the callouts and they don't get callouts from you, just saying teamwork &gt; kills
---
Lol not even a rook main..
---
2-2 with current gadget state would still be fab.
---
Tachanka's gadget will now be focused on the razor scooter, hitting the opponent in the ankle with it deals 120 damage
---
Yep
---
Also wondering this?
---
Only true warriors shall understand this forsaken quote...
---
Haha same here glad it wasnt just me
---
I came to comment this, points for u
---
Lets just make his turret a normal gun with an overly large magazine size
---
Indeed it is.
---
This is how 2pac was killed.
---
Thanks for the information, so I know I can get considerable points again
---
God bless you guys.
---
While yes that's what it's supposed to mean then I only queued with these 4 players and only 1 had issues so that's not reality
---
yes
---
Yeah the problem is they never fixed the consistency of sounds.
---
They fixed stuff playing backwards and certain sounds not playing whatsoever. However the consistency of sounds was never touched and seems to just be gradually decreasing every season. 
---
I just hate seeing people vault through barricades in the killcam when they were next to me but on my end it made absolutely zero sound. I want consistency.
---
*your
---
Just kidding idgaf about spelling.
---
You're gonna eat what's on the table.
---
U should’ve made the Stone chanka from villa i would nutt
---
1000 is not a record
---
It drops in 24 hours and 20 minutes
---
forgot to switch accounts?
---
It's scheduled for begin December so it doesn't have to be the 2nd.
---
But it should be in 3 hours 20 mins from now.

Hello Mad-mex3, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the upcoming Shifting Tides season
---
Why aren't you? It's greatest place to carry milkshakes on the go
---
**Download link:** [**https://imgur.com/KUzFxwC**](https://imgur.com/KUzFxwC)
---
I’ve got over 1000 hours clocked and I still get up to 60% chance consistently and still only get commons and uncommons. About 60% of those are dupes.
---
it killed me for the same reason last week, nothing went to downstairs
---
It worked for Lion, just give him a chance
---
Why? I think it is a fair nerf
---
Thanks man
---
Okay
---
They honestly need to remove dupe legendary items it is stupid
---
Lol exactly his rework hardly fixes some of the issues with him imo still sees foot steps for to long (90 seconds is to much)
---
Back when Fuze pucks were homing intercontinental missiles
---
Engineer ay. Good profession to be in.
---
K a i d
---
A good idea.
---
But I think wearing camouflage cream would be better than sunglasses.
---
Fuck it im going kaid
---
Yeah if it's $10 rn, get it
---
To be honest its not new player friendly, BUT you will be match with new players like yourself, BUT there will be smurfs who'll make the game not fun, BUT once you start getting into this game it has an endless amount of fun because you can constantly learn new things, get better at mechanics, and theres new content quite a bit.
---
Hello fatyohsi, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e5g8hq/glitch_with_hibana/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Like I said Arma was doing same thing to me
---
I still believe the psu is bad 
---
Keep me updated .
---
What is MNK?
---
I look down upon the spawnpeekers who NEED to spawnpeek cheekily to actually get a kill. If you can only get a kill while spawnpeeking, it’s kinda pathetic in my opinion. People should be able to get kills without having to spawnpeek.
---
They are open on PC apparently, I'm hoping for the Xbox release and when that is/If it is actually going to be happening.
---
Closer examination of the skins by myself has led me to believe it is Japanese as you said as it looks very similar to a stamp signature that is very commonly used in japan.
---
It wold be good if they actually took the time to rework it and cut down the soft walls by ~70%
---
It is. You wanna scan the youngest footprints to optimise your scanner
---
Take them hostage and make them play rainbow irl
---
Laser sight especially on long range weapons is the worst thing you can have. 
---
Its best used on shotguns since it increases hipfire accuracy. But even then, it cud backfire
---
The fact that it is IQ, the biggest counter to echo, makes it all the funnier!
---
It is. In my opionion the colors are not very logical so this might help you to see which footprint will give you the most pings
---
as far as i know, ubi is reworking the camouflage of yokais, so that you can see then better
---
Your still dead to me 🤔
---
Thank you, I've recently been playing jackal alot so this really helps
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
Yes! That’s why Ubi nerfed it
---
anyone know how big the update is?
---
I think u guys need to get a russian meme poster just for this like. I'm russian. I laughed with that but god damn it makes no sense
---
Thanks I’ll send him the links
---
Kaid handgun
---
Highly likely.
---
And remove all split floor objectives.
---
So it could be a Japanese y5s1.
---
My friend calls him Jewish Santa and I have no idea why
---
Yeah that’ll be a nice day when leaked
---
I need to get his gaming chair
---
&gt;His double ACOGs make him a good roamer
---
wat?
---
This deserves more credit than it's getting.
---
4 glorious hours!
---
Wish I could do that. Missed eternal sun by 2k. But no worries, I'll just get this. Wanted this one anyway.
---
Yeah if only there was an operator who had some sort of scanner that could detect electronics. Maybe it could be something she can use while using her sidearm so that she can scan and shoot things at the same time. That would be pretty neat
---
His pistol, and his Shotgun/DMR. I feel like it's good to have ACOGs as a roamer. I just do better with them.
---
The true work of art doesn't exist
---
Yah it doesn’t start at the start of the year
---
There already is a motorcyclist elite skin though
---
Maybe a mad max type then?
---
Comparing PL bans to ranked bans is not a great comparison though. Especially when it comes to somebody like Jackal. Roaming in ranked compared to PL is so completely different, even when you’re playing in a stack.
---
You act like in a real life situation the members wouldnt communicate with one another. What are you talking about his guns have insane recoil
---
Acing through the wall as fuze without anyone firing a shot
---
now i am goint to use it too.
---
it is really dope
---
I can't believe rarted is banned
---
You still get all the ops which is most important. The operators this year are good ones.
---
The extra renown is very tiny and negligible, only 5%. You can easily make that up with daily challenges or something.
---
It may have been a wiser choice to buy a "gold" or "ultimate" edition cuz those have alot of ops. Cheers mate
---
This is false
---
You can literally hold down left mouse not compensate the recoil at all and it will barely kick. And hey in a real life situation the guy would have to tell them where the track is going, just like in game you can use VOICE CHAT to tell someone where he is.
---
44. This is why we can't have this here. Some people can't even read.

There was 10 cosplayers &amp; a film crew! We rented 3 planes to do some shots :D it was pretty cool but FREEZING
---
Thankyou!!
---
We rented 3 decommissioned planes that are stored on an airfield for some filming :)
---
I hear you. First 3 seasons was platinum probably 90% of the time. Did not hit it once in season 4,, only got to gold 2 cause I solo q every single game. 
---
I need a squad. Please help lol
---
FUCK
---
Thankyou! It was a p sick experience ngl
---
Am I the only one that thinks Capitao's elite set looks like Craig Robinson? I will buy just for the movie quotes that will be made during gameplay.
---
naxx out???
---
10.54gb for me
---
How do you lean right or left on xbox without aiming ?
---
Because if we balance the entire playerbase around assumptions that are true for PL - perfectly coordinated 5 stacks, full knowledge of strats and counterplays, flawless execution of said strats, pro league level of aim and reactions - we will give 99% of the playerbase absolutely horrible experience.
---
This is not the right desicion, and if you heard about Deathgarden, this good player centered approach was one of reasons it failed.
---
Is the african datacentre live ?
---
It's sensational
---
Why is it so dirty tho
---
You wouldn't rent a plane.
---
Nigward, new kafe came in phantom sight. It’s new kanal your thinkin’ of

There's a bunch of content going up on everyones twitters at the mo (I posted them all in a comment on this thread) - the video will probs be a lil while yet tho :)
---
IS THIS QUALITY CONTENT?????
---
It's first person, they can't see them
---
You read his comment wrong.
---
unfortunately you cant :( they never put it on console, probably because the lack of buttons.
---
Bruntingthorpe :)
---
cant catch me
---
To be honest, I think both new ops will be a quite a bit weaker compared to their old counterparts, but at least they're usable. Worst case scenario, Maverick will do the same as Kali but be better (think that'll be the case) and if Jager gets banned, well hey, you at least have a worse, but nonetheless alternative version
---
Ahhhh I was thinking,  thanks anyway dude
---
Oop, I've seen like 1 video from her and honestly, I don't wanna be "that" person but she's a little too,,, uhm, ditzy/kyaa/loud for me.

Good cosplays like that one sure are ;)

no problemo &lt;3

I think they run airsoft games on one of the planes here!
---
She's sometimes hyper but other times she's chill. She changes between these 2
---
as is tradition
---
Hmmm
---
In my experience, game balanced primarily around the competitive scene, has never affected my enjoyment of the casual game. Those changes don't change the average players experience very much, but a game balanced around a casual play completely ruins competitive scenes. games with a competitive focus should always be bounced around at least the higher-end of the normal player base, if not the troll leads.
---
if we're not going to balance around pro league's, we should balance around Diamond level players in five stacks at the absolute lowest, nothing less.
---
7 ops are reduced, Nomad Kaid, Zofia, Dokka, vigil, Echo and Hibana
---
The ban Jackal meta is so dumb. 5 stacks should only be matched against other 5 stacks, and that playlist should be the only ranked mode with pick &amp; ban. Banning ops is pointless in a lobby with all solos/duos because there is no strategic reason to ban anyone, it’s just comfort banning whoever is most annoying to play against. A team of 5 can have an organized game plan that benefits from banning certain ops, which is the entire point of the ban system.
---
Oh, shoot. You rite.
---
Zofia mains be like...
---
Did you unlock Nomad before the patch? Because her (non-season pass) price just dropped to 20k.
---
They reduce the cost of older dlc operators
---
Hacking both of Twitch’s shock drones as Mozzie and tasing both of Thermite’s charge. Who needs bandit?
---
No, operators are, since a year now I believe, reduced in price the longer they have been out. 
---
This is a bug
---
Thanks for the many tips, I'm gonna check them out right away!
---
 a true dildo
---
Bruh I couldn’t even get out of gold because ubi broke the ranked matchmaking algorithm. They basically turned it into casual as I was getting matched against teams of either bronze 2’s or plat 1’s. fuckin’ solo que eh?
---
Maverick?
---
Servers are up?
---
This has some crazy detail wow!
---
Who gives a fuck about Diamond and Gold?
---
 well Not really but im glad ddosing is finally getting fixed and punished so all our effort will finally be worth it again
---
Kapkan, Thatcher, and Mute’s are the best imo. Capitao’s elite is coming out today too so you can buy that if you want.
---
That's the real question, lol. Making ranked bomb only was one of the best changes in Siege history.
---
Was going to post it during No Nut November but then everyone would have failed.
---
Wasn't me but thanks
---
I saw some one having the same glitch
---
Yea I know, but I already had the renown I needed and I only have like 2-3 ops to unlock. Also had quite a long session ahead of myself so I just unlocked it.
---
Isn’t that a glitch and everyone is 25K?
---
I played casual and half my team consisted of 2 champion rank players, a Diamond, a plat and me while the other team was all high plat while im low gold
---
Hello Melle2, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the upcoming Shifting Tides season
---
Oh i miss wrote, I meant, where are all the girls when I paly the game. Lol
---
Yep, never happens on PC
---
&gt;Because if we balance the entire playerbase around assumptions that are true for PL - perfectly coordinated 5 stacks, full knowledge of strats and counterplays, flawless execution of said strats, pro league level of aim and reactions - 
---
But isn't that supposed to be what the game is? "Work with your team", in the very trailer of this game? We aren't just balancing around the best, we are balancing around the way this game just **supposed** to be played. We don't balance it around pros because they are pros. We balance it around their plays because that's where this game is played the right way. Where the actual flaws of every element of thr have is highlighted.
---
&gt;This is not the right desicion, and if you heard about Deathgarden, this good player centered approach was one of reasons it failed.
---
Funny you should say this, and...
---
&gt;we will give 99% of the playerbase absolutely horrible experience.
---
...this, because ever since they started taking into account pro plays:
---
1- playerbase has increased
---
2- people have been happier, as shown from the general feedback of the balancing in the past 6 months and positive feedback on the reworked maps this year after they dropped Hereford and took responsibility (pros didn't want Hereford and Fortress either)
---
3-  more and more players have been asking for the game to be balanced around the best. Now the best can be diamond and champion as well. They just don't want it to be based off *just* pick and ban rates.
---
So basically, idk about that game, but Ubi's formula of calling pros to test sessions, taking their input and balancing around their actual test sessions has helped the playerbase as a whole. So, it's clearly working out, and has worked out.
---
A few hours.
---
Zofia's too, even though she's meant to be 15k
---
What the fuck? My planned maintenance guy is an hour from now
---
leak your equations bruv
---
No problem, you put in a lot of effort, ended up thinking we got a new MVP position for Presidential Plane, keep up the good work
---
Indeed no one can resist the lords sexiness
---
Ah neat, from the patch notes I had no idea what they meant. This is a solid update. Hopefully this will learn that bonehead I played with the other day that Caveira is the counter to Jackal and not the other way around (I explained it calmly to him and he went nuts about it)
---
When are you going to release that movie you shot there
---
Sorry I set my time machine one day eary
---
According to a response from Rainbow six France's twitter account, they will be issuing more details about it "later". That doesnt indicate whether it's later today, this week or later in the month.
---
I have her at 25k but not everyone.
---
I was confused, I've not been playing long, and was saving to get caviera for 10k and now she's 25k too. I wasn't sure if it was normal for prices to shift each season
---
It’ll probably come out later during the season or through mid-season, maybe the same time as the last tested battle pass came out
---
Here's a simple example. Let's reshape all the maps with assumption that spawn peeking is not a threat to an attacker and that outside cover is not a rlhard requirement. Do you really believe this will not affect casual games?
---
Probably not. The 3 armor makes you louder and if you want a roamer who can do electric shit just play Bandit. Kaid’s meant to be an anchor alternative.
---
Caviera is 25k instead of 10
---
Y gaeh
---
Damn man I knew they would do this. I was really hoping it was a season long grind sort of thing.
---

It used to all be 25k back in the day

Quit yer whinin’

(It’s actually a ubi glitch just wait for em to fix it)

I know but shit had me rollin
---
Who’s casually playing R6 these days let’s be honest
---
maybe? seems a little counter intuitive. How am i supposed to know how much reown to save up for each op?
---
No, not yet. It's still in testing. We will let you all know beforehand when it is activated.
---
I have 27k, no operators available to buy
---
2 ATK rounds/2 DEF rounds
---
Yes, dinosaur was fixed.
---
BROTHER!!!!!! WE ARE THE SAME!!!!
---
*here we have a wildwatermelon in its natural habitat*
---
\[Bug\] Older operators prices have been raised to 25k
---
I was about to buy Jackal after the new season patch landed because of his rework (and hopefully him not getting banned every round lol), but boom!, I suddenly noticed that his price has been increased to 25k! o.O
---
I have seen reports that the other ops from Y1 and Y2 have been facing the same issues as well (I can't comment on that because I own all the rest of the ops from Y1 and Y2). Hopefully, Ubisoft knows about it and fixes it quickly.
---
&gt;jackal bans are common in PL. 
---
Data says otherwise.
---
Consistent 5% ban rate and &lt;30% pick rate. Yeah, no, that doesn't scream op, when cap, an actual OP op that no Ranked player called OP had 70% ban rate.
---
Check siege gg stats. He's the literal opposite of ranked, and I'd rather refer to stats from people who know how to play the game than from those that think Cav is OP and Spawnpeeking is unfair.

Damn right! Saw them in Manchester Friday, so much energy best gig I've ever been to can't wait to see them again
---
&gt;Time to kill was also higher as people didn’t realize how amazing headshots were.
---
Wtf are you even talking about lol, headshots have always been a 1 shot.  And players roamed just as much then as they do now.
---
Ubi pls fix
---
Oh look is Noty 
---
Why u leave the forums
---
Remember this is from the perspective of a casual, who is just about awful at the game.
---
Gun nerf. That would be necessary then.

Literally unplayable

literally all ops counter kapkan and frost by looking at the floor

Hello Gamogi, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the upcoming Shifting Tides season
---
Mods please pin this for fucks sake
---
I hope you mean fixed as is in permantly there. That little guy was my spirit animal.
---
Original and funny
---
Yeah so not a big change
---
Try restarting the client.
---
Most people you know would appreciate changing to get spawnpeeked easier?? Thank fucking god you aren't in charge of anything. I don't even think it's that bad but my retard teammates that die to spawn peeks as it is lose me fucking games cause they're idiots
---
Same thing for me after i restarted the game. At first i noticed dokaebi's price at 25k and thought something was wrong, especially since i tried buying ying for 15k which resulted in an error.I restarted the game after that and now i can only see the ops i own.
---
The problem with banning for strategy is that one atk and one def ban doesn't matter that much, since you can pick an operator who can pretty much achieve the same results. (would be more interesting of one team banned 2 atk and the other the 2 def ops, maybe unbalanced tho based on maps)
---
Not saying anything for or against banning Jackal.
---
No one wants to play with me because im 13.
---
Whine more you must be  a great teammate
---
oh gosh (♡°▽°♡)
---
Honestly, I play with a squad who doesn't comfort ban jackal and for some reason the other team barely does. My squad usually bans blackbeard or cav (I don't decide on this)
---
I had the same issue but it seems fine for me now.
---
If I can’t see me they can’t see me”
---
Just another ubi glitch
---
They originally tried to fix the operator prices being displayed incorrectly and now accidentally did something else.
---
It isn’t permanent or intended, just wait for Ubi to fix this
---
Ty
---
You act like 99% of the time reinforcements aren’t electrified instead of muted. How is he easily countered? Shooting him? No that’s not a counter. 800hp bb could be shot in the body. He was there to hold windows. What’s the point of him existing if he can only take a couple bullets?
---
Look at his name and profile image, hes edgy as hell what do you expect
---
I don’t think Clash is op but I enjoy when she gets banned, I don’t have fun trying to play around a giant bulletproof shield that shocks you and slows you
---
Ok
---
Oh I've only ever seen one guy cosplay Valk (and I lov him hahaha) - I've seen loads of gals do it! Must just be who we see at the time :)
---
Where you playing ranked when the maintance begon? If so that’s the reason why it counted as a match.
---
Not quite. There's a difference between specifically checking doorways for Kapkan traps and Frost mats (and often exposing yourself in the process) and just spotting tracks in the middle of the doorway.
---
yeah me too can only see ops i already own saved up for nomad(20k) and cant buy her
---
lol, "he probably won't get shot." 
---
Damn, such a good argument. 
---
There is data, if he was overpowered, Ubisoft would adjust him, just like Jackal. 
---
He's been out for a year, he's fine right now, when he launched I'd have agreed with you, it was hard to hear and he swapped back to his main weapons far too quickly. 
---
But he got nerfed and remains a solid choice, but not even close to overpowered.
---
It was a major gripe when it was pulling my trousers down all day hahaha
---
Thankyou so much!!
---
Even better when you dunk on the other team and get invited to their 5 stack when you are solo
---
My inmersion is ruined
---
It's a bug! Sorry! It's being looked into.
---
This is nothing, its sad and toxic but ubis used to it
---
I thought this bad luck only happened to me
---
Can't see operator balancing in patchnotes. Fpr me it's shows only jackal, but ingame i've notice many changes. Where can i see full list of updates?
---
I mean, sure, if you're able to play all the time and it's the only game you play. I mean it takes roughly 100, give or take, to acquire enough renown for a new op. That's a bit much for a first person shooter. Don't get me wrong, I love the game to death and hope it has a long lifespan, but the way it is set up it's clearly favored for microtransactions and to encourage people to spend real money. 
---
Side note, if we cannot agree on the ops, I think we can at least agree that skins and charms are ridiculously overpriced.
---
Lol sort by new its painful
---
My favorite season
---
Honestly it would help if the update would actually go at a reasonable speed
---
Ok thanks
---
EAs putting final polishes on it to hand it over to Ubi 😂😂😂😂
---
From what I recall it takes roughly 11 hours to grind for each one. Especially for someone just getting in now, that's a huge time investment just to get what really should be a basic feature of the game. I'm fully of the opinion (and this coming from someone who buys every season pass across multiple accounts and platforms) that after 2 years ops should just be completely free. I've had them for long enough and it only serves as yet another barrier to entry into R6.
---
Looks like castle is too
---
Wow nice buff lol
---
You know, you could at least try being mature enough when complaining.
---
Interesante
---
It's a pose init hahahah
---
Headshots were always one shot but players didn’t take advantage of this as people didn’t think it was a huge advantage, same way Ubi didn’t think it was a huge deal until as people got familiar with the game it started to become a main factor of the game. This is why Tachanka even existed as a character and I think he even got significant damage nerfs in the beta, because ubi thought just being able to kill people in 2-3 shots in the body with a fast firing weapon and lockdown a hallway would be good (and it was in the beta when people tried to shoot your body as Chanka and you just gunned them down real quick). 
---
Also people did not roam in the beta, you don’t know what you’re talking about my man, people say in the objective or in the room adjacent because no one knew the maps.
---
Was it not attached to your belt? Sick cosplay. Do you use it for air soft or something?
---
Thats sick man
---
It wasnt dropping till later this year.
---
Hopefully gone forever
---
Definitely. It’s much better than the two seasonal skins we actually got.
---
Hello LegoBars, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the upcoming Shifting Tides season
---
Ah I'm jealous! They were sick in London - I've been going to their shows for a few years now, we hung out with them backstage a few times and they're super nice
---
I encounter this type of shit on a daily basis, I just happened to record it this time.
---
No matters how long TTS will last.. New season, new bugs
---
She's banned because people don't want to play against a shield ops because they're annoying and lose you games sometimes. Why does everyone think people ban whatever is "op?" It's about comfort bans or bans based on a strat (such as banning thermite on club house).
---
People banned jackal because getting spam revealed is annoying because you're forced to stay point for the whole round. You guys really haven't played against jackal in awhile if you forgot about that shit lol
---
wah people enjoy things
---
U made a controller look like Beaulo nice one
---
Castle is holding a shotgun. Rook is behind him with a p90.
---
I'd upvote if it was original but I've seen this done on Oregon not too long ago.
---
I'm not a great teammate, but I'm not toxic.
---
Yeah for the most part your right but on some laps a certain ban makes a huge difference. A thatcher ban can make it so easy to hold a garage or wall that it can force an attack from a different side that’s easier to defend and so on.
---
And what job was that? Rolling out a full operation?
---
: 2
---
I don’t want the AK-12 to be nerfed. I also think we should have some 3 armor non-shield attackers. I’m okay with Fuze staying 1-3 if his gadget was better and they kept the AK the way it is.
---
Incorrect. You can buy it as part of the safari bundle
---
? Castle is holding the m10
---
tried, didnt change anything
---
translate
---
nice
---
I see a buff to Amaru in the future. As it stands I personally have no reason to want to pick her.
---
Lol atleast you can play Xbox servers are down
---
people say this at the end of every season and in about ehh 12 hours they will say Shifting Tide sucks and Ember Rise was best season ever
---
Wait, you get claymore when you refill your ammunition?
---
How does this happen
---
Nice
---
You kiddn me, mans dont like Bartlett. Me Ma said i play well on da map but mandem says otherwise

Hello RodianRN, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e5klfl/should_we_get_a_custom_music_setting/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They haven’t. It’s just an overload from too many players trying to play at once.
---
you gotta admit.... this is sexier than Danny deVitto....
---
Spoiler: You won't do shit for the next like 50 levels. Then you'll learn all the maps and you'll only do kinda shit. This game has a very very steep learning curve, but it's the most rewarding payoff out of any game I've ever played. I can honestly say it's my favorite game of all time and has been for nearly four years.
---
Twice the scopes twice the accuracy
---
I feel your pain. I’m a mostly solo queue diamond player that spent the whole season stuck in p3/p2 because I lost most of my placements and started out terrible. I had such terrible luck in my first few dozen games that I legitimately fell to BRONZE 1. By the time I got to plat 2 I was only getting like 18 elo per win lol.
---
So does this confirm that Xbox is trash and that PlayStation won the console wars?
---
I think a good way to nerf him would be instead of the plant being reset it just forces the attacker to go through a 3ish second "struggling" animation where they stop typing and the plant gets paused. After the pause the attacker continues typing where they left off.
---
Someone in the the r6 group said uninstall and reinstall
---
What are you, 11? If someone told you isnt real would you believe them?
---
Except they know you're coming. They have a pretty good idea of where you will come from and they have a pretty good idea of where you will go once in. You have nothing on the defenders without droning.
---
claiming being the important word
---
Where did you get that?
---
You got to be fucking kidding me, sick of these attention whores who probably Should've been beaten by their parents more.
---
Ok I will try
---
this season was really shit tbt...
---
Ahh luckily, but its a pretty notorious group, the question here is are they the real group claiming this or some random people ?
---
Actually you can’t unlock any operators any more.
---
Its gonna take a while so i hope this works
---
THAT IS THE TASTE OF A LIAR, CLASH
---
Good one. I am so offended by the most 6th grade insult I have ever seen.
---
More of a ubisoft problem than a console one.
---
According to UbiNoty, no. They’re testing them still and are only available on the TTS.
---
Pc
---
Too late
---
Damn then :\
---
I hope they give it to us eventually
---
Say sike right NOW. Not Bartlett
---
They know about it and are working on it
---
According to UbiNoty, SA servers aren’t ready for the live version yet. They’re testing it still and it’s only available on the TTS.
---
not for me):
---
I didn't even know the update was out on xbox yet, time to hard reset.
---
Wait they are down I’ve been able to play today
---
On mobile, you go to the main R6 subreddit page, click the three dots in the top right corner. And click "change user flair" the then you can scroll through them all, or type which you want. Sadly I can only figure out how to have one, but I see people with several of the emojis behind their names. Dont know how to do that.
---
I love how she say “time for an adventure” right before she does it lmao
---
its not new, its from last season
---
You'd be wrong then

Check your updates, new operation

Just tried Mira and not a fan of her new voice.   
---
I understand the voice actress probably didn't want to continue working on siege and terminated the contract but she sounds so dull now, I love how her voice had personality in the past. Hoping for a recast but probably won't get one due to it being time consuming.
---
Also I noticed the tachanka main, so if thats true you should be praised as a servant of our god.
---
you have my respects!
---
That is actually amazing, love it.
---
Yeah man i wanted to buy vigil for that sweet acog but nah ubi finds a way
---
Same
---
Let me get this straight. You RENTED a plane?
---
Guys i am pretty sure servers go back up at 1EST on xbox. I could be wrong but i feel like ive gone through this in the past and 1PM ended up being the case
---
Not for me :/
---
What is that? I've got over 1000+ hours and heard it before but no idea. Lol
---
I know, thats why i was questioning it. Its super annoying instead of ppl being actually happy that they try to make the game better and ad new content after 3 years for a onetime payment of 15 bucks (for me at least)
---
Hahaha i live for this
---
And also, the servers usually arent offline this long.
---
Huh, guess I am, always thought it did, eh me and my squad will ban him anyway lol.
---
Just a bit of an update, if you were in a ranked match prior to the maintenance start, it may have ended in the middle and carried over. Hence the 1/10.
---
That's epic! Love it!
---
The golden rule

MOUNTED AND LOADED!!

Just said he's getting a rework, his turret won't be his gadget anymore, I assume sometime in year 5.

Yeah I've updated it but it's just saying Offline - Connecting all the time
---
Liar
---
Hihi
---
What keyboard?
---
Theres a difference between balancing around high level play, and just blatantly ignoring logic. That isn't a change that would ever be made because it would harm casual, and harm pro league, its just logical suicide.   
---
A better example would be the glaz nerf a couple seasons ago. Glaz was an absolute nightmare at high level play because a player could just smoke off site and kill everyone uncontested. They changed it, and it wasn't a problem anymore. People adapted simply by not playing Glaz. Now with this season, I think its in a good place, Jackal has his thermal, but he still can't entry frag in smoke like he used to. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is also like adding Pick and Ban into ranked in general. Its a move to help people get used to pro level play. Sure people at lower levels just comfort ban, but as they get used to it, its less banning jackal and monty and more banning actually powerful operators. Its a different style of play in lower ranks sure, but its balanced around high level play and people adapted.
---
Wish my parents were rich but they're dead
---
I saw it in a comment I don’t remember on which post. Sorry
---
Yum 😏😏🤤
---
Same here, honestly the incompetence   is astounding but I expect nothing less from today's gaming industry.
---
Hopefully not for a while attackers need some elites defenders have been getting so many it’s starting you get boring now
---
Same im not sure why
---
Worked the other day though :/ shit okay
---
It's so much better though
---
Ooo
---
There was talk about 2 or 3 years ago of a Rainbow movie
---
Wonder what happened
---
When they added the new op screen on ember rise the ops looked very blurry.
---
They added AA this season it seems and now they looks hella good.
---
(Finally yay)
---
You don't have a relevant opinion. Shush.

Doom (2016) has Vulkan API.
---
game has a high skill celling
---
Yea bruv    worked 4 me
---
I think they are slowly opening up servers for people
---
I mean it was in casual and I get matched with level 8s so I guess it’s because of that but you’re right. But that’s just every community now that I think about it
---
K
---
I think pro league sets come out around 2 weeks after operation launch
---
Beautiful
---
Haha yea -- this dude hopped on Reddit to carryover middle schools antics during his day off from school. Apparently can't expect too much from him.
---
I'd like to see mozzie.
---
Recruit ain't there, so it's either casual or unranked
---
Mutes mp5k in the trailer has an acog
---
I thought it was a dig at their "reasons for reusing gun models" but idk anymore.
---
I do agree one thing that ive also noticed in siege is that people really dont either hear footsteeps or dont understand sorround system that well, and oh also most of them are just blind or they have really bad reaction
---
How? 1 obj become useless, and it has close to no cover in any room. Braindead ash mains can just rush in and have an easy kill because you will have no cover or you'll be in the only spot you're safe. I'm 100% sure I won't like playing on it, but hopefully it's decent for ranked.
---
They either delayed it or canceled it because all of the backlash
---
hhmmm, spicy...
---
He’s banned cause he’s annoying, I’d say not to ban him, go for more tactical bans but idk.
---
Space? Alot.
---
Wait what was his rework about? What did it do? I live under a rock most of the time so I did not hear about this

Yee it says Send Nudes

I didn't say anything about how they already do it. They're all gonna get elites anyway so the "more likely to buy" argument doesn't matter.

Ubisoft can't do anything about download speeds.

Yeah I would not be part of this if it was that expensive 😂😂😂😂

THANKYOU
---
Negative; but a PC is 150% worth it.
---
It's already overpowered how considering peekers advantage works plus denying a weak op the only utility she has seems to be really stretching it
---
I know that
---
Didn’t they?
---
Not as great as canal. But not bad.
---
This is the 3rd season since they changed it.  Now it's a soft reset to midway between your season-ending MMR and 2500.
---
Thank fuck I have Gigabit internet.
---
You might want to tighten your pistol strap
---
Shouldnt*  lmaoo

Lmao the gun was too heavy for it

It's a bug

„Im going to pull what I call a pro gamer move“

Probably Meat wall just because you gotta be in the right place at the right time.

I know, but I already have the game downloaded, why do I need to have 70gb free if the update is only 6gb? No other game does this, only Rainbow
---
Buy engraved
---
The servers are up now man if you haven't noticed
---
I don’t get what you mean by “soft reset” like say you finished in silver 2 will that mean that that rank will have a very minor difference on your rank for shifting tides ?
---
I dont think so because even the clip ela did not have any grzmont mines in the inventory yet she was able to deploy one. So she always gets one while she’s down
---

Console or pc?

This. I don't really watch his other videos but siege school and solo to champion playlists are off the hook. 10/10 would recommend.

Okay thanks for the reply :)

That's good

my stuff got removed ie this meme

Ah sweet thanks, they look dope
---
Oh nice ill check it out soon
---
they should up the fire rated her supernova a tiny bit
---
I sunk down to bronze 3 this season. I'm usually a gold tier player.
---
I get kills, and reinforce (etc.) MY TEAMMATES ARE FUCKING BRAINLETS HOWEVER!
---
You have a PC?
---
What's up with the severs? my disk drive broke so i cant play seige until it gets fixed.
---
The more important question is why
---
How big is the update on pc?
---
Nobody knows. Maybe there were issues with it like the Blitz Elite has so they had to delay it. Maybe we’ll get 3 elites this season which would be bizarre and awesome if that was the case. Guess we’ll just have to wait and see.
---
I tried making a new post but I guess there a limit? Idk I’m new to reddit
---
Max sensitivity be like:
---
Sorry :(
---
Ps4^
---
If you are playing on xbox you wont be able to connect and ubisoft is looking for a solution
---
I found that I really improved in rank and map knowledge when I started playing with others. There's always gonna be someone with better aim/quicker reflexes but a couple good teammates can make a huge difference.
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
My man it says change my mind your move
---
Yeah there is a pretty big imbalance actually
---
I hope it’s a reference or something
---
Let’s give a 4 speed a full auto shotgun. 
---
pc vs console
---
Wont let anyone onto the game, occasionally it does but all you can play is a local custom game
---
Yeah im not sure either but thanks for letting me know buddy
---
Its helpful to drone out or pay attention to cameras. That would help your problem with being killed from places you cant see them
---
No promblem
---
So basically take your highest elo, add 2500 to it and divide it by 2. That is what elo you’ll start at for this season
---
Soft reset means your MMR resets somewhat, but not all the way.  For you, the effect will be minimal.  If you are at 2450 (midpoint of S2), you would reset to 2475 (halfway between 2450 and 2500).  Even if you are at 2400, the reset would only be 50MMR (to 2450).
---
If you were at 3100 instead, you would reset to 2800.
---
That's a feelsbad
---
This gives  me an idea
---
What the hell is this? People dress up and pose on planes? What the actual fuck?
---
It does account for it. Thats part of what makes them a weaker team if they can't hold it together because of 3 rounds being lost.
---
30 bucks well spent, it looks amazing.  You could probably charge 40 bucks for one of these.  Idk though I'm not an expert in the art market
---
If you are true ash main then you are fast enough that drone phase is your droning.
---
LOL mood
---
That’s way too many bans
---
ye boi
---
I reset the game and it worked after that.
---
They do, yes
---

---
Not even. You can still hear the zip line connect to the window so any player on defense paying attention knows where it's coming from. And it would still punish not droning without being completely one sided to the defending team. As it stands now even the most careless players can see her coming from a mile away.
---
Do share 👀
---
I feel you this happened to me except I had to go before I could finish
---
This picture blows...
---
If the queue lasts more than 5 minutes...just restart it.
---
If it doesn’t connect in the first 5 minutes leave and join again. Sometimes the que doesn’t like to put people in a game

Was a big fan of R6, passed away, friends told Ubisoft or something, Ubi honoured him by putting him in the map when it first released.
---
why would you wait for an hour, just restart your game
---
Oh my goodness hahahaha
---
I don’t have a final opinion, they took out the 2 part I didn’t like so it seems interesting.
---
Sau, I have to say, that was a pretty smooth way to bring in this new version of Kali.
---
Marvel should hire you.
---
Literally every time you play with your mates
---
No it doesn't. Anyone can shoot the drone if you spot it, IQ only makes that easier. Not everyone can break Maestro's cam.
---
Ah ok thanks. I’m going to delete this post then
---
When I have waited more than 3 minutes I always just reset the countdown, workes most of the time.
---
"I'm bad and cant win gunfights, so I'm gonna complain that the map is bad"
---
No like how you can only ban 1 on each side is good so the whole op selection ain’t banned
---
Bullet-proof cams are very situational and moderately useless, change my mind
---
Came here to learn about it too, I was pretty excited for the concept art and stuff
---
Guess nobody spawned on that side of the plane
---
They changed the trophy requirements that’s why. That trophy use to be “Win 100 rounds of hostage on terrorist hunt”.
---
The new trophies are so easy, the platinum means nothing anymore.
---
Not convincing. Glaz didn't blast you in the nose as soon as you stepped out.
---
jk, this is awesome. gg!
---
If you get shot in the head it probably won’t count as a head shot and you will die, you can not help it don’t worry though
---
How would that work for a newbie with limited operators? However I do like the idea. I would definitely like the pick and ban extended as I too like the way it forces gameplay differences. 
---
I thought perhaps picking the operators the other team has to play with. Could be fun 😊
---
Correction, “I don’t like getting spawnpeeked when I’m in the rappelling animation, so I’m gonna complain that the map is bad”
---
Happend to me too, I played her once and it said that I got 15 kills.
---
Good job! You captured &lt;Amaru&gt; level 16 smurf!
---
Nothing now
---
Eh that’s previous season as well but that is a pretty shitty start
---
you forgot to mention that they might cause a turf war in the future.
---
Enemys rushed us with fucking blitz and monty too
---
This made me smile
---
Feels bad
---
Yeah and then equip any of the ‘rainbow is magic’ uniforms and notice how you stick out like a damn lighthouse. Like smoke lol a damn furry bright purple uniform
---
Hopefully it’s not completely terrible when it comes out

Type 89, Mk17, Ost
---
Half of them probably don’t even own the game. I like Battlepass on PUBG and Rocket League a lot. Granted, I don’t pay by year for season pass on those games though. Maybe give year pass owners one or two a year for free or a steep pass holder discount
---
Can't wait for the Jagers and the Wamais of the world to have it tf out. It'll be some West Side Story shit
---
Isn't that just the screen where it cycles through the different operators randomly whenever you open it? Like a show case?
---
Transaero! Reminds me of good old days when I could fly to see my family without spending a fortune.
---
Ironically that's exactly what he was wearing in game
---
Yeah. It just bothers me when people complain about stuff the way this guy was because if the dev's listen to them, it ruins games. Warthunder is a good example of it. 
---
Kanal isnt better for spawn peeking than consulate or bank are. Players are just failing to learn how to anticipate the spawn peeks.
---
So allowing people to get all the ops in game for free and decreasing the prices is money hungry? The prices went back up on some but that's a bug and they're fixing it. So I don't see money hungry come to terms when you can have the same experience by playing the game without dropping money on ops and saving renown
---
Yea wish it was annoil rig
---
I just want to spawn in a heli
---
Spin into a trap lmao
---
You know, they’re probably never going to reduce it to 30 because they want it to be unique and I agree with them. Just give the gun an actual recoil diamond and I’d be happy, seriously all they need to do for me.
---
Try to uninstall and reinstall

I would absolutely use the AUG. Insane weapon, especially for defenders and is a very good AR. If you are talking about Wamai than there is no reason not to use it.
---
Wow as if it wasnt hard enough already
---
Also just a final tip: use a stereo/surround Headset, sound is very important in this game for knowing where attackers will come from and defenders will flank from.
---
If your concern is that map X is one sided, then the truth is it makes no difference if you’re put in A or D first. 
---
You will play the same amount of rounds on each side.
---
Oh boy, tower and yacht, fun
---
Well guess ill be quit ting rainbow for a bit again, cus this shit is not fun
---
That's definitely new!
---
Nope. Reset this computer last week. Only things i've installed are other steam games, the battle.n
---
Omg im blind my bad ehh I dont think they will put it on sale before S2 but I never really look at pass sales so im not 100% sure
---
Could be, we never know the contents but they do change them every season
---
These people bloodthirsty when someone states their opinion when thats what they just did. Feels bad my dude
---
It's probably just discord being glitchy, it be like that sometimes
---
Aug: more damage
---
Mp5k: faster
---
sounds like they've been switched for you too
---
Preach it. Thank you. 👏
---
Not sure how much, but you usually get a universal camo if you buy it before the year starts, last one was the Volcano universal wrap.
---
Biggest thing is not play it like COD. Or for that matter any other FPS. Siege is a very different game and requires different skills. You will die a lot to start out but will learn the game more as you go. Enjoy!

Because warden is too slow :omegalol:

Unfortunately the headgear that comes with it is awful (imo at least).

Ok you just commented cringe, please delete

And I see British airways?. They are bankrupt so I guess they need all the money they can get.

---
Do you know the name of it?
---
It’s not very good. Not balanced and is just defenders running out every round.
---
No is not
---
It's a bug then I guess

AUG for me
---
I am very jealous
---
Haha
---
Getting shot hurts
---
Thanks, can you link the full source is it on discord or twitter?
---
again, thank you
---
That's a real nice skin
---
Favela should just not be in any rotation. Glad to see House and Plane gone for more balanced maps. I will miss Oregon.

2 weeks after release
---
Yeah I always play amaru I had 4 hours on her but now I have 48 minutes
---
Your really good, dont even have to have the update or anything to be a god with her
---
Hm, that's possible I'll keep an eye open for that
---
Bad.
---
Too many turns that lead to too many open rooms. Reminds me of Tower.

If it's on steam refund it if you have under 2 hours. Once you do that you can just go ahead with the purchase of the ultimate

Is a stereo surround tv good? I'm deaf with hearing aids so I cant wear a headset
---
You almost made me choke on my spit

just leave them and requeue

My issue is i have 7 hours, and since it was a package deal i am only getting the option for 1 item refund which is only a fraction of the price i paid

I'm not sure I agree. The actual numbers I would move on - like I said in the post this is a rough draft of an idea based on one casual conversation, not a fleshed out proposal. But I do believe that randomness can heighten the tactical nature of the game. You're right about the best way to use pick and ban, but realistically that's not what happens, most people just don't make decisions that way. Jackal is an annoying operator, but he is in no way worth a ban literally every game, and having him banned changed very little about how the game is played. If people actually banned ops like Thermite or Thatcher or Ash or Frost or Mute, pick and ban would be great. As it stands it's not very useful or fun.
---
I think the core issue at hand here is whether or not people prefer more choice or meaningful choice. You may say that you can have both, and I would say that's only true up to a point. When you get to the number of operators the game currently has, it becomes a crapshoot trying to plan because there are so many permutations the other team can go with. If you cut a number of operators randomly (and I do stick with randomly because 1) People make bad choices and 2) It forces out-of the box thinking and adaptation moreso than anything else) then you add meaning to choices again, because you can have a better idea of what and who you need to counter. 
---
The numbers are completely up for debate, and I was hoping people would find it more interesting to discuss what fixed categories there could/should be and which operators should fit into them. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case - evidenced by the moron calling everyone on this sub smoothbrains in another comment -  and people are just responding to the number that are banned which, 1) I do generally stand behind but 2) was not necessarily meant to be the critical feature of this idea. But oh well
---
Maybe when i am alone, but with friends, that will take year, also why is tower still there, but plane isnt
---
Thank you for your constructive contribution
---
Same here
---
My theory when I first saw that was that it was from ine of the older Rainbow games because the quality was kinda bad, but I'm probably very wrong
---
Who knows what the future brings. But not at this moment. Hopefully they do cross platform at some point like COD started doing.
---
There is nothing quite about it. The grapple hook makes a ton of noise. The same if not more than ashes breaching charge. If you can't tell the direction that *thock* and *zip* noise are coming from you should get better headphones. At least with amaru you know it's only going to be said windows, ash can do it on any soft wall/door/hatch/etc. I'm not saying they should take away the delay in getting up afterwords, that works fine imo, but the window breaking as soon as the grapple hook hits it is too much of a warning system.

No it's been a thing since Ember Rise's release

I would never use it on IQ. Imo it doesnt hold up the the commando or her lmg
---
Thanks :)
---
they "dropped the ball" by changing the name and making aides switch every 2 rounds. Yeah ok
---
Well I didn't go for perfection. I just needed a larger mousepad and I found one that had R6 operators on it, so I grabbed it.
---
There might be other places that offer better artworks with the mousepad, but I just wanted the lazy way out.
---
Does the patch notes ring any bell to you ?
---
That’s actually pretty fuckin dope. If I got that I’d use it over my Black I e

Who is that imposter who just killed Kali?

They were as surprised as me.

I have a question. How did it took you 7 hours to realize you bought wrong edition?
---
Ya why tf they holding it so close to their face. Are they trying to get their nose bashed by the slide
---
but it's the truth in that regard.
---
Good
---
Yeah that’s how I finally finished it
---
Oh yeah what's your rank mate? post your username in here and we'll compare stats

I disagree.

the year one ops are like 10k reknown and the year 3/4 are a lot more

Uninstall

I thought the only gun you could buy it for was frost shotgun?

Asked the twitter account. No response.

Thats about how I am mine was under 50 for sure and have yet to get another

Do you even know what black ice is?

lol

Good to know, also can we call it the bridge?
---
Thanks. Definitely gonna use that
---
This sub is such AIDS.
---
House
---
I was thinking something more along the lines of what CS:GO did, where the first reload utilizes the extra mag, and then you just keep reloading the gun normally
---
Are all of these plane cosplays being posted by one person or is everbody on the sub renting planes
---
Yeah, you used to be able to but it for frost shotgun
---
Because it’s more consistent this way, more consistency= more competitive = fairer games.
---
When the game had somewhat barely game out you were able to buy it for all guns available at the time if I remember correctly and luckily I bought it
---
You will not be missed

Extraordinayr

No. Do you know where it originated from?

Ha, I got the best legendary charm, the banana! "For scale"

Oregon
---
Yes i think they should, this would help immensely with choosing the next operator you want to save up for and unlock especially for new players that don't want to buy the season pass yet. It would also be nice to already be able to get comfortable with an operator before you would be able to unlock it  if for example you can only play a couple of hours a day. Although you could use the test server because iirc it should always be live now but would be nice to just be able to play with them in the live buils.
---
Yup. Not sure why people cannot grasp this.
---
I guess not
---
Ah, yes, the lords tit milk
---
COD joke?
---
They just fucking fixed it
---
Ohh nice
---
Maybe he's talking about the fact that Ember Rise had just 1 Elite.
---
I'm on PlayStation, there's no hackers here
---
Hit headshots.
---
It's really not that different.
---
Doesnt play amaru. Puts in two cents anyways even though you're wrong. Makes sense. I'm not saying you're wrong about smashing through site windows but even as a defender, if it's a slightly off site window, you still have more than enough time from window break to her entering to get over there and take her out. That's the problem.
---
Reminds me of Piemations
---
Thanksgiving is over I ain't grateful
---
The fact you didn't die throughout that whole thing is insane. But good job
---
I mean they announced capitao at the end of burnt horizon. Maybe they’ll do 2 more this season? Because Cav and Ela have been leaked.
---
Casual is fucking garbage and not remotely competitive lol. Changing the round rotation does not change anything.
---
It was a seasonal skin in the first ever season of siege. That’s when he’s saying he bought it and that’s why it’s so “rare”.

Shit looks clean

But why do they have to make it more fair

&gt;Removing Casual  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No, just renamed to quick play.
---
Erm, not exactly. AA/DD rotations to emulate ranked for casual play that literally no one asked for. Pretty sure that's what he meant by removing casual as it's now ranked lite between this and limited map pools.
---
Hahahaha that’s perfect!!
---
It makes an overall uniform experience. Why have extra confusion when switching between game modes when you dont need it. It doesnt hurt anyone to change it so why not?
---
I mean Hibana and Echo are already the Japanese ops.
---
Give him immunity to the ringing after an explosion is something minor I would like but it would not help him much
---
I’m a level 93 right now and the closest I’ve got to it is the common iceman skin and I also don’t expect to get black ice any time soon :(
---
It's either Kafe or Border.
---
I really liked the old Hereford base and Bartlett uni. In the current map pool, I'll answer coastline
---
Don’t turn away without cutting off that angle, move away while watching the angle and then look away. 
---
Also why just stare at some angle when you don’t know if someone is coming. Check cams or something.
---
Me too, but Oregon got removed from “quick” match. :(
---
I got the original one yesterday, that’s why I’m so mad
---
Wait that wasnt only in the beta, that shit still happens as of yesterday

I was about a say how in the God damn hell did you rent a fuckin 747
---
Are you talking bout the ice skin?
---
Agreed, I was just curious.
---
&gt;Casual is just renamed to quick match,
---
Demonstrably false. Quick match now implements AA/DD rotations like ranked now.
---
idk, sometimes if you get lucky you can see they are aiming and the sight is like too far to even see the holo
---
Level 131, i have 3, ak12 ,9×19, and fmg9

No, the mp5 black ice
