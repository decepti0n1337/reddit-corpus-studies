The incentive to play the playlist was to get a feel of the pick and ban. Where a lot of the crutch operators get banned, making us all play differently.

You lose nothing by playing it and gain everything by learning how to play without operators like Mira and lesion.

I‚Äôm not defending the TK but you were reinforcing a wall that should usually be left soft...

Not near my laptop at the moment, will do it tomorrow morning. I‚Äôll give you a screenshot as soon as I can

---
Commissioner Warden
---
Well if I could afford a PC, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem lol hasn‚Äôt been an option for me yet
---
Not here to argue this is just my two cents. But I would argue that it‚Äôs still unfair because the holder that can‚Äôt see the aggressor doesn‚Äôt even know that the aggressor can see them. If we think about it in real life you have more senses than just hearing and sight. You also have touch or feeling it whatever you want to call it. But in real life you can use that to say ‚Äúoh, my head is poking out‚Äù or help you position parts of your body in your environment without looking at them. You can‚Äôt do that in siege which is why people think it‚Äôs unfair. I think they should find a way so that it‚Äôs more ‚Äúfair‚Äù and both players can accurately gage how much they are peaking along with removing they have one pixel exposed and can see everything that it was before.
---
You were being stupid, lesson learned for you don‚Äôt reinforce there
---
Go to hell, and take your updoot with you
---
yeah, just for future reference don‚Äôt reinforce until near the end of the prep if you‚Äôre solo queuing, especially since you can‚Äôt hear the other teammates
---
Amazing 1v4 clutch! Complete with 4 headshots, a collateral kill, and great teamwork!

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs you‚Äôre team?‚Äù ‚ÄúSome old comrades‚Äù Fuze talking about all his killed hostages to Harry.
---
no, it's an updated version of his old chart. people pointed out a lot of flaws so he changed it.
---
Glad to see the subreddit is just as toxic lol
---
An educated guess judging by previous seasons
---
**june 11th, 2pm gmt / 10am est / 7am pst**
---
Up until last season new operations released 2 weeks after the TTS went live which has often been around the 4th - 6th of the month of release. But at 6inv ubi announced that the duration of TTS will be 3 weeks from Y4S2 onwards, which should mean phantom sight will release on june 11th and previous seasons would indicate the hour of the release ubi aims for is usually 2pm gmt / 10am est / 7am pst at the earliest.
---
But more often than not there are delays that can take up to 2 days like with last season.
---

Thats where i messed up, dont make my mistake, it took me a while to really get use out of those ops
---
Yeet
---
A change to the dynamic is indeed a welcome thing in theory, but I would counsel caution against advocating for it just because it's different. Not necessarily solely on the topic of roaming, mind you, but in the broader scope of things. But for the sake of argument let's narrow it to roaming because there are indeed words to be had here.
---
I'm not saying limiting roam potential is bad. The change in dynamic can indeed make for some interesting layouts because it is entirely possible for a map to be too big for its own good (looking at you, Tower...), but you don't want to make it so you can't move around the map *at all*. Kanal isn't the worst map in the game but there's no real reason for defenders to go to the non-objective building (aside from slowing the attackers advance, I guess? But why would they even be there in the first place?) because it's a glorified dead end. It's a waste of space, in the same vain Villa's basement can be largely a waste of space on Bomb since there isn't much to do down there.
---
If the map is too big, roam clear is a long, tedious and painful process for the attackers. If the map is too small, Fuze and shields have a field day and the defenders don't have much in the way of alternate angles to hold or places to hide. For better or worse, roaming is part of Siege's meta. Sitting in one spot waiting for the attackers is not very fun or interesting for the defenders. But that doesn't mean roaming should be the be-all, end-all meta that all maps should be balanced around (again, Tower sends its regards).
---
I'm not a map designer for this game so I wouldn't really know what their philosophy is, but I would much prefer more in the way of medium scale maps like Clubhouse and Outback, rather than giant labyrinths and tiny Fuze-bait cages with nothing in between. A happy medium would be nice.
---
I can approve of this
---
He was changing the chart based on comments and this is the final version
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on Xbox and played against elevate with shuttle and laxing pretty crazy.

*confused sirens*

Bandit had to sell drugs at one point you can read all about it in the bio and even in his operator video he said ‚ÄúI was forced to sell drugs‚Äù.

I dont think he's going to be nerfed very hard, although maybe he might get less fuel for his torch. I would still recommend maverick or if you're still not sure if you should get him I would then say capitao due to his gadget being useful on bomb and he has pretty decent weapons.
---
r/DecreasinglyVerbose
---
Threaten to take on some hardcore drug use if he doesn‚Äôt fix the internet...?
---
**This is why I play custom instead of bombers in your house mode**
---
It could be a few things. How old is your router? If it‚Äôs an old router you might not be getting performance you could have with a new router. Sometimes the modem the internet company gives you is crap also. How old are the cables your using for your internet hook up? I bought some nice cables off amazon recently and they run much better than the 10yr old plus cables I had in the past. What internet speeds are your parents paying for? Also the speed they are paying for might not be what you are actually getting. A common problem in rural America. At least where I live! Also try the old unplug your cable modem and router(also known as the old reset) for 30s-1min then plug it back in and that helps sometimes.

Then just don't get one man. I know MnK sucks, especially in diamond where you're at but the Go4 charm means nothing when you didn't earn it.

You're already a diamond with a controller (I assume) my man.. You don't need a Go4 charm that you didn't earn when you're already getting diamond charms that you DID earn. Flex on em with the diamond bro.

What happened to jackal's brother?
---
Lots of possibilities but just starting with the basics. Are you sure it's the internet and not the game?
---
Try pinging a few different sites and see if you get the same response times, if so then we can check some other things
---
Find a team that is typically available and as enthusiastic as you are for the game. It‚Äôs a team based game with different gadgets. Learn the operators and maps as fast as you can. If you‚Äôre good at aiming with recoil you‚Äôre set for a while until the strategies come into play in the higher ranks.

Tell him that the worse the net, the more I'll play to cover up for any mistakes that happen in-game due to bad net. Getting consistent net allows you to regulate your play time yourself and be done and dusted in a couple of tries rather than repeating until you get it right.
---
Also start watching a LOT of study material videos on the net, but turn it up to 1080p 60 FPS and show it to him how it is buffering so often and that you can't go ahead unless he gets better net. I suspect this would work.

One i main Ela it's not an ar, nor a smg. It's a carbine. Two the gun is total shit so just don't use it because at its state the damn shotgun is better at killing anything at range. Three use the shotgun it's the best in game. Four dont play bad characters especially her. Because the more we play them the more ubisoft just turns a blind eye to the real problem with them. And Ela has a major priblem, unlike everyone else she can't engage at range. Her scorpion is time worst gun in game,  her pistol is below average, her secondary gadgets are literally useless to her, and her mines are just lackluster at best. And the more we play her the more ubisoft just ignores these issues and nerfs her more even though she's the weakest roamer in game. She's gotten 6 nerfs with 0 buffs behind her and it's just sad. But were both on console so I guess not playing her makes no difference since ubisoft being the asshats they are only take data for operators from pc players, and at that only the plats and diamonds so only about 50k ppl at most there. Even though consoles make up about 75% of the siehe community our stats don't matter apparently.

It could still be useful with an op that can cut the power to the building for a few seconds, all lights would go out, all cameras built into the building should also stop working for those few seconds, the metal detectors would also stop working and so on, everything electronic that's connected to the grid would stop working for a few seconds, but Valk cams, Ella mines, Echo's drones and Kapkan traps should all still work, even when the power is out, because they all run on batteries, atleast that would be what I assumed.

No I think he‚Äôs saying pear Hemorrhoids

apparently Nokk is OP because she's invisible to everything and that being invisible to Echo's yokai I heard isn't fair from someone, But if they wanna make Warden Viable he should have his speed increased, For Nokk her ability shouldn't be allowed to hide from Echo's Yokai or Alibi's prismas for a nerf just all cameras including Maestro's evil eyes and bulletproof cameras.

as a muslim i can approve the frustration.
---
wanna play pc btw?
---
But Ela and IQ is hella thicc tho
---
haha dae le chunky xdxdxd
---
I would love to, add me on Uplay.
---
WHERE IS THE FUCKING ACOG
---
üëç
---
Carriedman on uplay. add me
---
Their band name is 
---
# SLAVIC SEXTAPE!
---
I like narkotik kal the best
---
I would honestly play this op if ubi made him.
---
I think you‚Äôre a bit misguided when it comes to attack metas. Also, in terms of balance, bomb is just better than secure and hostage. 
---
Also your idea of Lion, Ying, smokes and Monty could also work on secure and hostage. When people run cheese strats you have adapt and overcome, regardless of the game mode
---
Or if someone playing ash runs up and murders the histage. Gotcha haha
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt play casual anymore
---
I got the advanced version for 15$ and gonna buy that booster for 30 so iss good
---
yes!! I've always wanted some environmental stuff! like I had an idea (for example) maybe there's a saw somewhere and if you walk into it it kills you or something like that I just want something environmental!
---
I was thinking for house, the small door/hallway bedside the basement gym has a fuse box, if people had to manually pull the breakers it would be cool, but it would give away their location. maybe something only attackers could do.
---
On Xbox you can gift the game to yourself and it gives you a code in your email
---
Okay thank you.
---
if it disabled all the power then all the cameras could be temporarily disabled too
---
Watch any recent Pro League match and tell me strats don't exist.
---
Imagine running around with this
---
Is there a reason that leaving manually shouldn't always be a ban?
---
Punishing players for leaving to prevent an interrogation will have a lot of collateral damage to it.  There will be some percentage of disconnects, regardless how low of a percentage, that are the result of a player's internet or game crashing on them and not an intentional act.  While yes you could only consider players who use the menu system to leave, habitual leavers would just resort to alternative methods of leaving the game and we're back to either punishing all disconnects no questions asked or nothing has improved.
---
What they need to do is develop a system that outright prevents players from gaining any advantage from leaving for any reason, including the potential to be interrogated.  What I'd like to see them do is change the disconnect logic for an operator in the round to keep their operator avatar around until they are killed in whatever state they were in at the time they disconnected. If the player manages to reconnect to their game while their avatar is still around they can jump back into the game.
---
* A downed player stays downed and bleeding out on the floor until they either die from an enemy/bleeding out, are revived, or interrogated. If they are revived, their avatar stays where they are picked up.
---
* If the only alive/non-DBNO/non-Zofia players on a team are all disconnected, they all die.
---
* A disconnected alive avatar cannot be downed under any circumstance. If a teammate or enemy deals damage or uses an ability that would put them into DBNO, they die instead.
---
* If a player disconnects while holding the defuser, they will immediately drop the defuser. Even if the defuser is at the feet of a disconnected avatar, the avatar will not be given the defuser.
---
* A disconnected avatar will have a very distinctive color and/or icon so players know for sure they are disconnected to minimize the chance of them being used as bait.
---
This change would eliminate the issue described in the OP while also providing a number of different benefits. First, players can potentially rejoin the round they were disconnected from if they get back in quick enough. Second, the other team can still receive credit/point for their kills and assists with disconnecting players; this is important for many players.
---
Tomorrow (11th) people with the season pass can play the new ops then next week (18th) everyone else can play them. I‚Äôm not sure when the season starts with all the changes though.
---
But does it go 2D paper Mario world through your body when you look at the killcam?
---
I will be XDD
---
Yes. Lets go for the highest lvl of play of people who never play secure area as comparison to show me how superior bomb is to secure area.
---
I thought all the sarcastic comments were genuine for a second
---
That worked because they didn‚Äôt play cctv which is an important room for defending this objective. You shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to even be in between that and the obj in the first place honesty
---
Dynamax Thatcher
---
Lion, Finka, and Thatcher are enemies ...
---
All are enemies to Fuze
---
Because they're op lol
---
But it's also beautiful.
---
In a way, yes.
---
Another thing. How do you get the "Jager Main" shit next to your name?
---
No they‚Äôre not lol, blitz just play distance, and cav just drone
---
Lol it‚Äôs not that hard
---
I mean he‚Äôs in the TTS and I have played him for a bit, pretty underwhelming tbh
---
No. And fuck you.
---
Turn it into a horror game
---
Yea but not everyone plays tts
---
Your downed they have a cav there is no excuse and I'm saying quitting the game not having your internet getting anal pounded at that moment
---
Fixing production codebase like that would be a gargantuan effort that they wouldn't bother with
---
Why dont you, i dont see you coding a game for millions of players and if their is one mistake you ahve to go though hundreds of thousands of code to find what may be wrong.
---
Caveira's Red Dot
---
Yes lmao. Thanks for proving my point. There's a fucking reason they don't play secure area.
---
Having multiple light sources in a game is something that's been in games since the mid 2000's. The original Dead Space uses those shaders, ffs. It's Any computer with a dedicated GPU that's been made in the past 9 years could handle something as simple as that.
---
/effect give @p night_vision 99999 255
---
Because ubi wants them to play bomb.
---
It was such a grind to get the blackouts in WD
---
Matchmaking will put people who just started game with diamonds.
---
They cannot do that yet
---
And blitz is op against high ping players
---
Maybe the ops gadget should be wall outlets you can place down and if enemies walk by them, they get so magnetized bullets and other objects veer towards them
---
Thatcher would be meta if that was a feature.
---
Hello mrtank101og, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/byw1s3/looking_at_buying_some_new_characters_today_any/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Engine limitation. They shouldn't even have bothered with OpHealth. They shoulda made Siege 2 on a stronger engine. So many things the current one will never be able to do. Even basic things like flashlights.
---
Hereford is already the darkest place in the universe.
---
Overall this is a useful sentiment, but taking a hard line never reinforce next to a Black Mirror assumes the player on Mira knows the best strategy for the team to employ.  Seeing as most times I PUG and have a random player on Mira, they rarely consult the team to determine where the mirrors should go.  Rather, they run to the wall they want to Mira and reinforce how they see fit.  This could be half the wall in closet in Oregon basement but it could also be the snowmobile garage on Chalet.  While the former makes sense in pretty much every situation, the latter is almost without fail a terrible idea.
---
Believe it or not, it's a two way street.  Yes, players who are reinforcing later in the prep phase or during the action phase should be mindful of where Black Mirrors are placed.  But the Mira player also needs to make sure the spot they want their mirrors plays into the team's defensive strategy as a whole.  Since my experience with PUGs in that case is that neither player says a word, neither can take any kind of "moral high ground" if you will.  If you reinforce half the snowmobile garage on Chalet and put a mirror on it, 999 times out of 1,000 I am reinforcing the other panel.
---
*That moment when your deeply thought out strat backfires*
---
But then they would add more bugs
---

Yeah happend to me on Herford Ash stood in the doorframe yet all I saw and was able to shoot was like her ear
---
Some people are so ignorant lol
---
Id probably main thatcher if every single light went out in the room when he throws his emp.
---
And maybe also if jaeger wasnt such a counter to him
---
It'ts probably red phosphorus gas.
---
There are times when the defuser carrier in pro play is killed on the other side of the map (or at least far enough from the objective to be a serious hindrance); are you saying those players suck?
---
I don't want to get too caught up in specifics about the defuser management.  The general concept which seems to be coming through with most of the replies on this post, is that there is a depth of strategic choices that exist in Bomb that cannot exist in the other game modes.  You're welcome to prefer the other game modes over Bomb or like them equally, but I simply cannot get on board with the notion that either mode offers the same richness of strategic choices as Bomb.
---
Secure Area, for instance, requires at least one defender to have a path into a singular objective location at all times of the action phase.  This greatly limits the options the defenders have to hold the site.  With bomb, there are viable strategies that involve no defenders actively sitting on site but rather in adjacent rooms or the floor above/below.  An attacker in the site doesn't instantly put the defenders on the back foot if that attacker isn't in position to get the defuser down (or hold the defuser at all).
---
In Hostage the likelihood for a recovery for defenders is essentially nonexistent since it's so easy for attackers to make it to the extraction site with the Hostage as soon as they get behind cover (potentially including a shield).  This cuts out the entire strategic option defenders have in Bomb and to a lesser extent Secure Area of playing for a retake.

Yeah but don't forget that rainbow six is a multi-player game mainly focused on dynamic destruction, managing light sources and illumination surely is already a challenge for devs because it have to adapt to every destruction that may occur (which dead space do not have to do). I'm pretty sure that dead space use prerendered illumination with shaders on top to give dynamic light feeling (it's just my personal assumptions I'm not an expert). Also adding dynamic lighting will have little impact on gameplay but huge impact on performance in a game that is already quite demanding on gpu performance, and devs surely don't want to exclude player who don't have powerful GPU just for cosmetic mechanics (thatcher will still be thatcher). 
---
Also dead space rely a lot on the feeling you get for the environment with dark corners, shadows, sound... But siege does not, siege is more about clarity and quick actions than environmental feeling. Imagine a big fps drop for players with low-end GPUs (who can already play the game) everytime thatcher throw an emp nade, that will be very frustrating for those guys, and clearly something that may push a lot of people to stop playing siege because every client must have the same effect on environment illumination. 
---
Do you really think that changing emp nades effect in such a way is worth it? Do you think this will be a game changing mechanic worth pushing out a lot of player? Personally I don't think so and devs too apparently
---
Please detach the laserpointer of your gun its like ur screaming hey everybody look I'm right around this corner please pre-fire me

U either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
---
I don‚Äôt like it. If it cuts out the built in cams, then it‚Äôs forcing players to play a character if they want to get intel. It‚Äôs a good idea but they‚Äôd have to be sure of the way they implemented it.
---
I already became the villian a long time ago
---
That's fine, and my comment isn't necessarily directed at you personally.  I'm glad to hear you don't try to pull out seemingly ill-advised Mira strategies without buy in from your team.
---
But almost all people reading your post will be playing with a Mira (or be playing Mira themselves) by a different person than yourself.  This post advises the other four players need to just go with the flow the Mira player decides and by extension implies that the player on Mira can universally decide where the Black Mirrors should go.  This is a dangerous expectation to set for both parties in that equation.
---
Simply put, Mira players need to be more communicative with the strategies they are planning to use which in my experience rarely happens with PUGs.  Once there is a level of understanding and ideally even buy-in with the proposed Black Mirror placement, then it's on the rest of the defenders to not butcher that strategy.  This post makes it seem like the other defenders should be willing to accept a potentially disastrous strategy the Mira chooses for the team.
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
But they said R6 Siege will have 100 operators. Maybe they won't plan for a siege 2 until they reach that

I get banning Blitz, bit Cav just confuses me. Like why would you ban Cav on Oregon?
---
Don't just stand there solder, shoot the bloody camera
---
I always thought that was disappointing in a game like this one to not have the possibilities to cut the power or destroy the lights. In a real operation it's the first thing they do.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Welp that‚Äôs enough reddit for today
---
Or foozeball time
---
i was talking about that with my friends and my idea was that he couldnt use the shield as any other shield operator,he would have it in his back ,it could get damaged (like bb) and he could use it to breach a wall and 5sec after that for support to his teammates. for pripary he would have an mp5k.The shield will have 2 uses  if they shoot your back you get 25%of the damage and destroys one use of the shield
---
blue on blue you muppet
---
Cav and ela are amazing, ela shotgun main here btw
---
Lil chanka, A$AP Glaz, Ka¬∂Kan, philly fuze
---
Nah, cav is easy to shutdown if you actually drone and push together
---
And ela‚Äôs shotgun is pretty amazing but she doesn‚Äôt really bring much to the team
---
Smoke/Mira, optimal anchors with amazing weapons. Some of the best utility in the game.
---
Thermite/Hibana/capitao, incredible utiliity + decent weapons and I don't trust my random teammates to play hardbreacher without immediately dying.
---
That's not why I'm offended.
---
Honestly I've one really seen that in ranked plat and above
---
Instead of flashlights, nigh vision goggles, like the bulletproof cams. I'd also love being able to permanently shoot out individual lights, etc.
---
Don't know if it really would affect everything else except Valk Cams and Drones. A lot of gadgets seem to stand alone, so I imagine they're battery powered, not plug ins, if they require that at all even.
---
Disabling all that would be insanely OP and would just render a lot of defending operators useless if that was the case, especially with no counter.
---
You have a point there. Didn't think that one through.
---
My idea was keep the forgive system remove RFF and go back to the two tks and your kicked but if they forgive your tk it doesn't count towards your two tk's
---
Tbh if your connection is that bad then you might want to consider other options for games; disconnecting like that ruins the game for other players
---
Why are you offended

Thanks! :)

Then u open your alpha pack and gets a common skin hahahah
---
How is it not? Its the same as the IQ, Clash, and deployable shield glitch. You're performing a sequence of actions(leaving the game) to get an unintended result that gives your team an advantage(not having their positions revealed).
---
First off, Warden hasn't even hit the live game where players can try him with any hope at balanced matchmaking.  Can we wait and see how he performs under the real situation before we propose buffs for him?  Yes, he's one of the most situational operators on the roster, but he may turn out to be an unstoppable force in that situation to the point where any buff would be ridiculous.
---
Second, your suggestion completely removes the situational part of his gadget.  While there are many attacking strategies employed that don't rely heavily on smokes and flashes, it's rare that an attacking team won't use at least some of those items during their attack.  Having a defender who is permanently immune to them would be ridiculous.  This would also remove what is ostensibly a restriction that he anchors because he would become quite valuable as a roamer as well.
---
Yup üòÇ
---
That would be Realilistic and awesome
---
You put finka at c. The amount of times I've had finka boost save my dumb dumb teammates from having bad aim is ridiculous. The amount of times the finka boost made scared teammates push to get a kill. Saving a downed teammate from a crazy cav. Nading mira. Finka deserves respect and I'm sending the whole Russian army after you.
---
All I know about her is her middle name is pirate
---
Because it's part of the games "realism". As far as I know, if you place a Mute jammer too close to the bulletproof cameras and Valk's cams they get the fuzzy screen like the drones do. Not sure if they changed it, but I know that's how it used to be
---
um
---
my opinion is that its completely the other way around, but all speztnas are in my S, and cav is in my D-Tier
---
Ohhhh shit I see
---
My favorite part of COD Ghosts was fighting in the Halon gas. Surprise knife attacks were just soo  g o o d.
---
Yea but she also makes you deaf for a few seconds and has grenades do damage and it could fuck people up who are used to recoil then all of a sudden end up looking at the floor because of a finka charge
---
I‚Äôm not a beginner, I stepped from console to pc and only have 12 hours. Yet free weekend players seem far better than me.

Recruit rush &gt; finka shotgun Rush
---
shields are run relatively often, and banned regularly when the other team has a good shield player (Pengu or Mint for example). The main reason that teams don't run shields is because they have very good aimers and feel it is wasted talent.
---
Of course you can counter shields and thats why they aren't brought every round, but there is a lack of counter. It's not hard to hipfire someone with a shield, and they won't have much of a chance as shooting back.
---
I was genuinely surprised they even had one! It is much better than any other lan charm.
---
If you die to this shit then that's on you. Stop sprinting from spawn and expecting to get away with it.
---
A while ago when I didn't play cav a lot, I got random picked as her on border and I got a 4k and when I was battling the last guy my friend stole the kill and what would have been my first cav ace
---
This was a year ago...
---
Thanks I got it deactivated :)
---
So currently all players have the same thing

I don't think so sadly. You have to play a certain amount of siege per month to be eligible.
---
Rooks there as his armour can be useful but i was stuck on putting him lower or where he is. But mira is very situational and needs a good team to work so i put her in the middle,  sometimes good sometimes bad. Capitao is very meh, they still have been screwing with how gadget so I'm going to wait until they get their shit together in changing him.  Smoke has okay weapons but like mira very situational. But Ela deserves to be even lower than she is,  i do main her and i know that shes the worst roamer in game. Her carbine is horrible, pistol below average,  secondary gadgets useless to her specifically,  and her mines are just lackluster at best. She really is just pathetic in her current state.
---
When ? Tommorow
---
They would auto ban blitz if he was OP like lion was. Honestly blitz bans are more of a quality of life ban rather than hurting the other team. Blitz isn‚Äôt played that often at high levels
---
If we are just thinking of there abilities you are correct(jackal can scan footsteps anywhere tho) but when you take into account something like fuze with lion or dokkabei with lion or jackal it make the ability stronger just like Thatcher and thermite combo
---

?
---
Should have put her in S tier, finka sasg rush is op for a unprepared team or just a uncoordinated ond
---
You should think about it more further. If you think about it, the ability of Ash and Sledge is practically same. But they are used differently.
---
Im not saying youre wrong, coming from a gold but how in the hell are both of the major hard breachers in B and C
---
What game mode do you play if I might ask? OPS like cap,smoke,mira are way more important in bomb.
---
Agreed, well lets get ready for a very lackluster 3 months. Operation Phantom Sight is out tomorrow, so have your fill of her. I am honestly probs not gonna play her that much. I rather keep playing other operators that i want to get better with and especially since she is on the field. Means my mozzie main skills will need to come out.

Glad i could help!
---
It‚Äôs become a bigger issue now to get killed without seeing your killer than it ever was. The fix made the issue worse. The number of times especially as an attacker now where you‚Äôre looking to enter the objective that you get killed by someone who was never exposed on your screen is at an all time high.
---
For example when I started playing R6 pulse had a heartbeat sensor, now his gadget is called something "wave...", and I have seen changes for several other gadgets
---
Ah yes, another 'idea' that has been posted every 2 weeks since the game launched.
---
I do find it annoying you can't at least shoot lights out inside
---
Needs to be shorter
---
I always assume everyone is playing r6 cod style.
---
Yes. Combo is always great.
---
You have no idea how many times my team gets finka rushed lol I love and hate it.

Those for me personally are the only operators I absolutely NEED to do well in ranked.

So was there a certain amount time I had to watch it because I only watched the first 2 maps of Team Secret vs Lestream
---
This is one combo where your op would be potentially too strong,fuze,lion,vision.then you could also have the others as the thermite Thatcher combo or dokkabei and finka
---
Wonder if you can read.

Where yumi at

I didn't even know there was a first floor on fortress
---
You got an hour ban for one tk?
---
i made a thread like this a few months ago and nobody was this positive :( fbm
---
Should show their ping for the next few games, mark them as leavers
---
There should be a limited time playlist where it‚Äôs bomb only and all the maps are night maps. The operators can shoot out lights or the attacking operators could use thatcher to temporarily disable all light like you showed in the picture. Attackers could have night vision goggles and defenders could have flashlights. There would be a banning system for players to ban the operators that they think would be to overused in the gamemode (glaz for example) I think this is a cool concept to be able to mess around with stealth a little more in the game
---
Where‚Äôs my acog?
---
From playing Terrorist Hunt so much, I saw that coming
---
Ok

You're new to R6, huh?
---
Dope af. Gonna try to make a wallpaper out of this. Quick question, What are the dimensions?
---
*100% sugar*
---
It‚Äôll be better and easier if they did it for one new map!
---
lol tbh I'm sort of this way with my squad but I stay watching pro league and am pretty good with coming up with strats for us and they don't mind. When I solo queu or whatever tho and try to run a mira strat idiots always ruin it
---
Holy shit that was good
---
I hate to be that guy but, Mozzie\*
---
The tracking people through walls was a heartbeat sensor (pulse) and the other gadget was disabling cellular devices by turning of cell towers and anyways no operator in siege uses cellphones for calling and they are already adding a gadget that disables seeing teammates through walls, seeing pings, and checking drones.
---
No I'm pretty sure e3 is today thats what it said on the for honor menu
---
The recruit oiled his lips so much to take this photo lmao. 
---
And right?? I think the doc made his out of a bike helmet and half a Tupperware container but no idea where the other two managed to find those lol
---
That's a fair point! I'll see that it's included in future posts.
---
It'll be available a few hours after Operation Phantom Sight is available on all platforms.
---
The number of times I've communicated a strat and someone directly fucks it up is too high
---
I shouldve put him in the middle with mira now that i think about it. Because like mira they're either really good or really bad depending on the team and map.
---
I shot the arrow into the room and it said on the side of my screen "team damage -5" about and the  bam kicked 60 minute cool down for team killing

If you check his other comments in this dam thread, he is a person that does this.
---
I stand corrected. Only the season is tomorrow.
---
Why do you say that
---
never got banned after 1,7k hours, you are doing something wrong bud
---
Akho
---
These are amazing man, would love to see some color if you feel like that. Take my gold and don‚Äôt stop drawing!
---
Mira should be a must pick
---
Pulse is not an S, Mira should be higher and Nomad is higher than Z.
---
And then an OP that can counter this one. He would have the ability to see in the dark and would have no flashlight on his weapons so the enemy players wouldn‚Äòt see him
---
How to upvote twice
---
I'm a very new player, so I haven't even played old Hereford. But I do agree that new Hereford sucks.
---
see i pulled a sneaky on ya
---
HAHA FUZE TEAM KILL
---
Still an F I was hoping today welp going to watch e3 when it comes on I'm tryna see if anything happens to for honor
---
Same goes for the fact that there not only wasn't barbed wire, but nobody there heard him crawling that entire time.
---
he wasn't i literally paused every half second lmao
---
Not really, visual information is ridiculously powerful becaue if you can pinpoint the position, stance and momentary occupation (droneing, holding an angle or so on) you have an advantage in any firefight. Audio can only do so much for you so it makes perfect sense that we want to see our enemy's and that what makes the intel meta not the sound.
---
Did a 4 year old ride this?
---
I‚Äôll have to answer that when I get home sorry.
---
'Not Great, Not Terrible' - Comrade Dyatlov
---
I don't even know who it's from and I really don't have to know but a charm that just says "Bing bong" is a must have
---
Just saying the only handful times I‚Äôve ever been banned was for intentionally tking friends
---
Yookei cun han adelle it
---
Don‚Äôt kill hostages, they be innocent. What got you your 30 min ban before this?
---
Yea only expro players thats why Macie and Matim0 got them....
---
You think echo will be playable in ranked? 
---
\*Laughs in 98% banned
---
Now that's a lot of damage
---
If you have a friend play with them even as a 2-stack (queueing with a friend) you have a close to zero chance of getting put in an ongoing match
---
Do you have footage of this happening? It's not hard to master the recoil of the majority of the guns on this game with a little bit of time and patience. Although there are plenty of cheaters out there that do use scripts and cheat it's likely not as common as it seems.
---
So is Clash, deployable shield and claymores still being fixed?
---
This would be like complaining that players can see your feet from a vertical angle but you can't see them. It's just how perspective works. Pretty sure you learn this kind of stuff in middle school. How bad are schools in the US anyway?
---
That‚Äôs when you take an extra long blink when you hear the first and second barricade smacks
---
Did you watch the entire GetFlanked video? He whole second half he talks about the perspective close to the wall vs far from the wall.
---
This map is already dark enough
---
Division is an entirely different kind of game. When it comes to competitive games, sequels often end up splitting the community unless the sequel is significantly better than the previous iteration. 
---
Just look at how many CS players originally pushed back against switching to CSGO for years after release, or how Super Smash Bros Melee is still widely considered the best smash game.
---
I think u just killed the hostage
---
As it being frendly u will be punish as u would get by killing friendly player
---
So when it comes for you to attack you've shot yourself in the foot making your life harder. Remember it takes 4 rounds to win and you spend the 3 rounds as defender. If you're assuming it's going to mega easy to win at defence then wouldn't the exact same be expected when you switch it up?
---
What If you lose a round of defence and they stomp you when they defend? you are just making your life harder. 
---
Getting rid of Jackal means the enemy team doesn't know where one of your defenders are. Getting rid of cav for the same reason. They are both very strong operators when used correctly and rightfully banned in the majority of matches.
---
*touche*, but in the new ranked playlist right now it's like 100% Cav/Mira bans.
---
GSG9 recruit with M870/MP7, nitro and barbed isn't actually a bad roamer, better than Ela and some others for sure.
---
Really?
---
Ow. He better. Would jump his sub count by a lot.
---
takes one to know one
---
Just the way it is
---
I quite literally never said I didn‚Äôt know about vertical sites, you are just talking out of your ass. I said something like ‚ÄúYour statement implies to me that you enjoy playing vertical sites, you do you.‚Äù I directly referenced it. SERIOUSLY ARE YOU EVEN READING MY REPLIES?!
---

---
Was released after I commented.
---
Thanks though.
---
Capitao has average weapons at best. Also i understand that his smokes are immune to ads but why play an op whos unique gadget is half of something an op like jackel has plus jackel has a whole other unique gadget and a better ar with a secondary shotgun for destruction and vertical play

&gt; I just don't like to be misrepresented.

Well its partially ur fault cuz of the title and thumbnail that u used.
---
Trying to farm karma be like:
---
Yeah buddy your smoking that pack
---
They are waiting for Ubi's E3 panel today to confirm it for maximum impact. They come out tomorrow.
---
Apparently some dude said you have to apply for it.
---
I don't have Zofia but for the mpx Holo and any barrel attachment
---
As far as I am aware the streamers have to apply for a charm. Maybe Russian Badger and Varsity didn't apply?
---
Maybe players who leave drop a phone and we just add in an extra interrogation for Cav using the phone instead?
---
Wait, what? 
---
Link please?
---
I suppose
---
Whatever, have a good day
---
I‚Äôve been wanting something along these lines for awhile. Having a set brightness setting would be hard for everyone to do. It would be cool if you could shoot lights etc. but again this would be hard for developers to achieve.
---
Sad life. He has a pro team anyway, so he might not be getting it.
---
Plus, with recruit you can 3 speed rush with one of the best shotguns in the game
---
I am LOLing so hard rn :DD xDDD lord TACHANKA hahahahahhahahahahaaaaaaaaaaa le chanka lord :DDDD
---
i wish stupid posts like these would stop gaining traction so the devs can rework tachanka cuz the memes dead
---
They are must picks
---
I see you had 80+ ping. Just curious how would you rate your ping affecting your gameplay, is it too annoying, could it be tolerated?
---
Had to check the name to make sure it wasn‚Äôt me.
---
I don't even think this is a joke
---
Same to you homie
---
Bomb is like a fine wine, just gets better with age.
---
I'm excited because now ranks are more meaningful, nobody going to be cheesing there way up in unbalanced game modes.
---
There's a reason that it got 2500 upvotes lol
---
Molotov‚Äôs more for defense I‚Äôd say
---
i wouldn't care, i would only care if the game mode is unbalanced and shit to play
---
I tuned into him the other day because I've seen him in compilation clips on YouTube. He was bitching about some stream sniper for *10 fucking minutes* refusing to go into a match because he was stream sniped. Just setup the stream delay dumbass.
---
Not really
---
Sorry, but The Lord is absolutely NOT a tier D operator. I‚Äôve seen so many people use him to perfection, especially in ranked play.
---
Kixstar deserves one too.
---
Yeah but @thegodlynoob
---
Go follow @memes_r_trash_ on Instagram
---
Haha German man no zoom Jewish woman  no head
---
Is it really a roast if you were there to see it?
---
She has one of the worst SMGs in the game haha, her pistol is like all she has
---
Please don't!
---
They've been trending. Like 5 are posted every day.
---
Hoes must really be mad if they lurking in the comments of my post lol
---
Too realistic for a tactical shooter bud
---
I play on US servers a lot, not being from the US, ping is usually round the 60-100 threshold. I don‚Äôt see it affecting my gameplay at all actually, it‚Äôs very tolerable.
---
I agree
---
Her shotgun, and her smg is a laser
---
12 must picks? In a game where every round there are a maximum of 10 ops, and a lot of other tier ops are way more useful on secure and on bomb
---
In the hammer and scalpel short there was a part on six‚Äôs board where it had secondary gadgets and ‚Äúproximity alarm‚Äù was one
---
YES
---
every time he dies it‚Äôs either a stream sniper or someone using mouse and keyboard on console.
---
Delet ths
---
Yeah I would literally pay you to do one of these for blitz for me
---
Okay but who won lol?
---
It was as ubi called it. A "rework" not a nerf. A nerf would be removing a scan. If anything he is in my opinion better than he used to be
---
lord tachanka funni gib gold giv upvot
---
A laser with extremely low damage and a pathetically low fire rate
---
And the shotgun is very situational, I‚Äôd much rather have her pistol for close range engagements and get the down rather than use the shotgun
---
Where does it actually say 6/11?  I haven't seen that anywhere.  Just curious.
---
You seriously have a problem, i‚Äôve seen the GUY who scored idk how many karmas + is on the hot/top list. You‚Äôre just hoping to get some too. 
---
Happy hunting!
---
For real. I've been under the impression it starts tomorrow. Now I'm completely unsure for the first time about a new season start. Maybe they are waiting to announce it today at their E3 conference?
---
Well they ain't say a release date on twitter or anything. Everyone just assumed. And we're halfway through the day soooo...
---
Works in Wildlands. Siege just flickers the lights lol.
---
You got me on the first statement but i dont understand the second statement.
---
- Low HP med kit- 40HP
---
- Motion Sensor
---
- Semtex- only get one of them
---
Nah lets just make a tactical shooter but completely ignore the conditions that most tactical operations take place under: Night.
---
**ToXiC**
---
FUCK the F2 tbh
---
I play bomb, because its balanced. Rank is for competition. To see where you stack up amongst the playerbase.
---
It has never made sense to have unbalanced game modes to rank in. This is how it should have been from the start.
---
Adapt or play casual.
---
People watch for the rage moments and the toxicity, he‚Äôs siege‚Äôs wingsofredemption
---
How are you losing 4-0 to literally no one
---
When do they come out start of s2?
---
Can we get streamer charms with the free subscription?
---
Yikes, did this my first few games
---
A Capit√£o main. Man of culture.
---
While I love it, I have to disagree. No ops are must picks.
---
Deadline August 31st?, does that mean Y4S3 starts September 1st? Or is that something different?
---
You look expensive
---
Almost like siege is actually the least tactical rainbow 6 game ever produced.
---
Sound
---
Nah this is more of a response to u/thefriendlygrenades tier list. But i appreciate the attention
---
Yea but you can use the shotgun for rotations
---
I only play secure and have no problem switching to bomb. It‚Äôs way more competitive to play.
---
Ubi doesn‚Äôt make any money of removing 1 gamemode from RANKED, you can still play it on casual.
---
So what‚Äôs the problem? Not getting a high rank by cheesing hostage?
---
I don't think the community itself is toxic as much as it is too easy for the community to be toxic.
---
If you took away a few ops and attachments, I think Siege would be golden, but how far do you go before you get to Counter Strike?
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Yeah, someone who doesn‚Äôt even exist. Don‚Äôt waste your time :)
---
And thermite kinda looks like Rico
---
Yes, my friend got the charm with the trial.
---
100?! Seriously?
---
I'm probably in the minority, but I prefer the 417.
---
She has impacts for that, besides one of the anchors should have a shotgun, like maestro, smoke, mute, etc.
---
Bro, I‚Äôve been suggesting this since year one, just a central node in the middle of the building that the defenders can trap or defend, and attackers or defenders can disable it and shut off the lights and cut the power to the building until reactivated
---
On old hatch‚Äôs you could clip it in the hatch to hide it which meant it was kind of viable but this it‚Äôs a bit too intelligence
---
Thank you thank you ^^
---
How do you have multiple flairs?
---
Can we get charms with the free twitch subscription?
---
Bahaha trying this...
---
Holy hell this was cringy as hell to watch....
---
Ela ;) or glaz
---
My bad i spelled it wrong. u/thefriendlygrenade hes in this comment section
---
wdym no one drones, gold is sweaty af, every player drones every 2 inches of the map, at least in every game i played, people talk like gold is copper or something but theyre pretty good,
---
For example blitz and ash. They only are frustrating to play against in lower elos. Capitao is way more useful than those two, for his area denial and smokes + flashes.
---
How are you just gonna accuse Coreross of not watching your video? No proof and you keep saying he didn't watch it. He proved you wrong, It's not the end of the world that he proved you wrong.
---
right elaaaa üòçüòò
---
Gamma man
---
Surprisingly I lead each game (2 of them) with like 7 kills.
---
I second this question.
---
I'm a level 250 Doc Main muahahahahahaha (Devil face)
---
I have no idea who these people are and at this point I am too afraid to ask.
---
My first game of RR had the other team ban bandit and Montagne, and our team banned echo and blitz (my friend and I queued as a two stack so majority rule.
---
What if there was a defensive op with incendiary grenades, like smoke he can take over an entire hallway and the fire can climb the wall, the only way to counter is with smoke grenades but it will put out the smoke as-well as the fire. The fire can damage the wall and make it easier for bullets to penetrate. 
---
^defender btw
---
Personally ash, twitch, and blitz are attackers that I would ban every game
---
@Valkyrie_bae . for crediting proposes
---
i use the M762 with an ACOG, Compensator, and Vertical Grip. i also have claymores equipped.
---
IQ
---
I‚Äôm talking about hatches so she can rotate through the map, and she can use her impacts for kills since her pistol always downs
---
Hit the right shoulder
---
r/cursedimages
---
Ash
---
Recruit. üòç
---
That's scary!!
---
Purely coincidence imo. Blitz mains will suffer far more than anybody else along with Cav mains in the bronze-silver bracket
---
I mean I guess that sounds fine, when I play cav I just use the SMG for extreme long range and the pistol for everything else, then the impacts give me rotations. That‚Äôs all I ever have used
---
who would do that?
---
Ok :). I don‚Äôt know who you are but I hope you have a better experience without us.
---
Is it bad that my first instinct as to why I should watch this video was spotting the black ice...
---
Hate when people ban Blitz and Caveira instead of people like Jackal and Echo
---
My first thought was who spawns at that end
---
Thanks ela! Haha
---
I used to do this behind reception on Bank. But ton of Hibana players would shoot their pellets without properly looking back in the day.
---
Gridlock the Meat Shield.
---
Yooo that was actually sick lol and a good laugh my question is though why are there 3 people watching one mira window but no one in cc or in Archives lol
---
are you 12
---
It would be hard to have cover there with no deployable shields at the moment
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
Fair for blitz and ash (tbf i made it in like 3 minutes) but ive got a bunch of replies stating my opinions on capitao
---
Only works on console
---
Nah only if you down him and he leaves while interrogating
---
Trust me, I fucking will.
---
Yikes. That was very cringe. I‚Äôm embarrassed for them.
---
Thx!
---
Bye.
---
Wrong. Lord is F tier. That way, whenever you choose him, you simultaneously pay respects to him
---
I bet my guy. You enjoy yourself. üëå
---
you suck
---
Is that your favorite operator
---
Repost
---
The amount of Finka clips I see, I really need to stop neglecting her.
---
Not my favorite but i like it!
---
Burn in hell
---
Cool
---
Also random side note. I did this 3 times in the same game.
---
Do with that, what you will
---
Good job mods you love keeping Low effort content on this sub huh?
---
you salty cause you got spawnpeekd? pog
---
Breakdown,Breakdown
---
Lol like you think we actually give a fuck. You won‚Äôt be missed (also this post is just as toxic as what you‚Äôre whining about)
---
Would the phone disappear after the normal amount of time it takes a player to bleed out?  If so, this could help eliminate the Caveira problem but wouldn't gain any of the other advantages I mentioned, most notably the idea that a player who reconnects to the game could potentially get back into the match before the round ends.
---
And were the toxic ones? Omegalulxdrawr
---
u right. sry I forgot it.
---
Agreed
---
Nibba you gay
---
Eat a dick fuck boy
---
Nope. Still like the game, can't stand the subreddit
---
As someone else mentioned, I'm not on board with putting a racist operator on the team. Or having them be so open about it. The team is a team. They have their differences at time (such as Lion being arrogant and causing trouble for SAS/GIGN) but they're not enemies and nothing should make them so. If they can't see past that to work together or help each other, they shouldn't be on the team. Its different if there's tension because someone is a dick to another, but it's a while different level if it's just over race. So fuck that.
---
Second, I'm not big on either ideas. There's always the idea for an armoured drone, so it's pretty common, but I see that as being a little wasteful depending on how tough it is. If it's a one shot for each level, that's wasteful, but if it's multiple, then it might do good, but with the gun it could be a little overpowering.
---
As for the other one, I'm not getting the idea? Is it a moving signal disrupter? Does it just make a noise? I'm kind of lost.
---
Isn't he involved with the pro scene still?  None of the charms have been with pro players , or affiliates.
---
This reminds me of my first clutch I was on border as iq and my teammates left for my friend who just got on and the other team all ran out and I sniped them but the last guy was somewhat smart but can‚Äôt forget lean spamming and crouch spamming was still a thing in blood orchid
---
Interesting way to just ask about ones favorite op.
---
I don't think you care, I just want the mods to ban me.
---
Please, make a JabbaBC charm for next time.
---
RIP Kaid and Frost. The other changes were fine but I don't see why they needed to nerf two operators who already have low pick rates.
---
Exactly
---
It‚Äôs on fortress and this old as hell
---
Source? Nowhere has officially said yet. I think they waiting for E3 conference to say.
---
Might as well  just get get an OP that nukes the whole building...50000 R6 credits ofc..
---
I weren‚Äôt even Finka‚Äôd at the time, just pure skill;). Nah, I get you
---
Thank you kayne
---
[deleted]
---
No everyone knows
---
I think he was trying to grenade jump himself through the barricade but implanted his face into the wall instead.
---
I tought they reduce the damage of mats (like kapkan). Thats why I editted my post.
---
got confirmed today, because i don't think that they will release the new season tomorrow for ps4 only..
---
Or just Power off The Siege servers
---
Nomad and Cav
---
Just stop being trash. They do have accurate throw paths you just dont know how to throw
---
nothing change with bb , he still the same
---
You're in a tiny minority, F2 is probably the best AR in the game and it's a little silly to pass it up when DMRs suck so much in siege.
---
My favorite post in your profile may be the post in the fortnite sub
---
You mention pro league in the first bit, but most PL attack bans are target bans.
---
Removing Jackal is just removing some spare utility so he usually isn't banned, Dokk isn't banned often, Lion isn't insane anymore but was autobanned anyway so idk, and Ying requires crazy high skill to actually make her worth banning. Like Ying is basically only banned against Hungry.
---
So all of those are pretty situational, and Nomad is easily more of a threat than most of those ops are right now (depending on map). Monty and Blitz also get banned in PL more than most of those other ops, I'm pretty sure.
---
I was trying to figure out my perfect settings, but I always dont get wanted result. And I tried pengu settings and started playing like a god.
---
Me and the boys being the worst ops in the game.
---
This would be great. My only thought for all this though is that people would just abuse the brightness setting. Maybe if they actually made the maps Pitch black like you said. IDK, it‚Äôs a really cool idea
---
I can't imagine playing this game *without* headphones.
---
Also means most players probably aren't using any form of headset just tv speakers
---
I don't keep my PC running when I've got nothing to do, let alone running a game and that even for 30+ hours. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/58C9h1G
---
Yeah I got banned. And the only reason I joined that sub was to post that
---
Somebody said it would temporarily disable all the cameras too!
---
The ‚Äúprone slide‚Äù that they attempted to fix while adding back drop shotting is nowhere near an even trade. The slide was obnoxious and overutilized by high level players creating an advantage but drop shotting is detrimental to the entire community. I won‚Äôt be playing until it‚Äôs removed.
---
Wdym?
---
It‚Äôs the siege Road to SI skin
---
What's your source? No official channel has stated this.
---
But will all streamer charms ever made be available? I want the BikiniBodhi one ;\~;
---
Worth it 10/10. Also would like to say that that Tachanka fanart is really amazing.
---
do people still find Ash that annoying to play against? While not exactly the same, I feel IQ and Zof basically fit the same shoes. Ash doesn't bring anything to the table to make her worth banning. No frustrating track or shield, just a decent gun.
---
What does Snake Nade have to do get one???
---
Maybe in ‚ÄúReady or Not‚Äù or in the new ‚ÄúQuarantine‚Äù game coming out!
---
I'm on console, lean spam isn't a big deal for us.
---
Dropshotting, however, I'd much rather deal with on PC than console because on PC at least you can easily just dropshot as well. On console you need an controller with paddles or you need to get use to an extremely different playstyle by playing claw or changing buttons around. So it's alot harder to just adapt and accept the dropshot meta while it's in the game in console.
---
Thanks that one is my favorite out of the like 20 I did
---
Yep. Perspective is way off right now
---
Hibana and mute
---
It would be awesome!
---
New season is tomorrow 6pm UK time.
---
Imma sneekeh sneeehk!
---
just believe me
---
That's also poor game mechanics, you shouldn't be able to leave manually
---
We do that in Canada as well
---
Source?
---
I actually disagree you can use the gap to stop breech charges and use it to just straight kill people just use the 1911 and you‚Äôll 3-4 hit them
---
lady with knife aka cav is one of the insta banned.
---
It should be a new operator if anything where he can temporarily turn the lights out and use IR goggles.
---
Defenders like Jackal are the only ones that would be able to counter her without giving away their position and anyone else uses flashlights OR bulletproof cameras/evil eyes/valk cams.
---
I guess. But I‚Äôm not really asking, just dreaming. I can‚Äôt even list all the complications that might come with implementing something as big as this
---
Only the last part
---
There is no source but everybody knows.
---
There is a reason the reborn ranked playlist stopped today.
---
Caveira spooky thicc
---
Username checks out
---
I'm pretty sure those are almonds. I think the beans would be leaking out through the wick basket
---
Not for me. I never miss like that. Kappa
---
So does this mean Claymores will still be unavailable?  Yikes, was hoping toxic runouts would be gone. Glass half full response... Nomad buff.
---
So much talent. Continue pursuing that passion of yours, because I see a bright future ahead of you! 
---
Do you have a favorite among them?
---
Yea I miss my deployable shield
---
Should be a feature, tbh. Would make gameplay really interesting, even during daylight
---
Sorry üòé
---
what was the point of an extra week on the test server?? The season might as well be delayed for me, I‚Äôm not dealing with this again.
---
Seems really fucking OP. Having always on Vision is broken. Maybe if they had to turn it on and it had a bar.
---
That‚Äôd be insane!
---
CHANGES TO UBICLUB CHALLENGES
---
With the start of the new season, Ubisoft Club Challenges will now run on a Thursday &gt; Thursday schedule.
---
Does this mean the new season starts on Thursday (6/13)?
---
Wow. That‚Äôs awesome
---
Yeah my favorite of those four is the lord Tachanka
---
Thanks man for appreciation, you are probably the first one who likes it. I wish sometimes there would be Siege 2 announced with such mechanics, but who knows maybe in future they will change engine or something
---
What? That looks awesome! Rifle from Aliens!
---
‚ÄúSnake tactic, snake tactic‚Äù
---
You got EVERYTHING right. 
---
And I do mean everything great job.
---
How does someone walk up to the hatch as thermite and not realise it?
---
Yeah all the way up to burnt horizon it did for me idk what happened during burnt horizon but this is probably a fix and not a takeaway
---
Being able to play without PS plus before the weekend was a bug. It only got fixed because the free weekend reversed that setting and rage posted all over reddit so then Ubisoft and Sony knew people were playing unintentionally for free for months.
---
Xbox
---
I‚Äôll gladly play with you if you‚Äôd like :)
---
that would give defenders advantage imo but yeah it would be cool if something like this was in the game
---
Even got the butt right.
---
Shut up its a viable tactic
---
It would have been faster to google it than to post on reddit
---
Straight bots, even the thunt terrorists would have heard it. Nice clip nonetheless
---
Blitz and Caveira are autobanned every game.
---
Yes.
---
That's true
---
Were some legendary skins actually removed???
---
She doesn't have a 99% pickrate in PL dude lol are you serious?
---
MIRA???
---
I remember you from the IQ gun skin. Seeing the rest of the cos is awesome!! Well done. :D
---
I guess so, however how drastic would that learning curve be?
---
Bro I‚Äôm going to ree, don‚Äôt make me do it
---
Was that twitch on border?
---
I tried, couldn't find a definite answer
---
Someone told me she does on one of my posts but i dont follow proleague or esports for this game so i went with it
---
Why should you have been able to see them? I mean they can see your feet and you can't see them. The issue is your placement not the camera.
---
does badger have charm?
---
Not looking forward to seeing dropshotting again for a bit; honestly would just be fine with the Season being delayed, but I theorize Pro League schedules won't easily allow such a change. 
---
Otherwise, excited for the new season.
---
Feet aren‚Äôt the same as your eyes.
---
You fucking killed him man!!
---
Yes get the game and it get more fun over time
---
Yes, some are not possible to get whether they are from an event or ubi just decided to make them unavailable from alpha packs for whatever reason
---
The game is totally worth it. It may take time to get up to speed with everything but it's one of if not my favourite game and if you get it on pc then I'd be willing to play with you
---
If you don't even watch PL why are you making statements about it? Mira is banned like 70% of the time in PL, and not because how 'good' she is.
---
You will like it when you start but all around the game will make you more toxic on any game and in real life. Do not give in to this game please
---
Sneaky little rat
---
Yea isnt she banned cause of how OP she is?
---
Aw what the fuck! I only got ela, lesion, and thermites headgears and I wanted other shit and now it‚Äôs removed. How did people know it got removed?
---
Depending on how patient you are, you should be able to get those two ops pretty quickly in the next few days just by playing. If possible, I'd recommend saving your R6 credits.
---
*REALLLLLLYYYYY* good
---
Yes it is absolutely worth playing! This game is not that hard to find friends on. There will be some people that will be "toxic" but i find them really rarely. Feel free to ask me any questions that you have about the game ill be glad to help.
---
Btw what are you gonna play on? (PC,Ps4, or Xbox)?
---
true they would have to change that. There definitely a lot more issues so it probably wont be viable in the game right now. I would assume the lighting mechanics would have to be heavily edited.
---
Haha, I do this a lot still for a joke. Sometimes you get people to step on it and get zapped or if you are lucky, a hibana will shoot her gadget on it. You have to place it really well tho.
---
I have played more than enough league of legends i am immune
---
And still no Mr. Pit charm
---
That kaid and front nerf :(
---
Holy shit this is good.
---
Unless Microsoft has changed something in the past year you should be able to buy that bundle and as long as you buy it on your main account the characters should be available to you.
---
Wouldn't it be just a slight change to learn to adjust that new position
---
Sound is fine
---
I didn‚Äôt get get head shotted 8 times.
---
They should get a badge
---
TRUCK NUTS CHARM WHEN
---
PS4, but i never had any problems with "toxic" games. Even not with For Honour
---
Goodbye
---
Ok I‚Äôll try that thx
---
How did no one hear that rattling snake?
---
Wow, pretty nice
---
Good luck kid. You‚Äôll need it
---
I dont see anything (claymore joke)
---
&gt;not because of how good she is
---
Did you even read my reply? Most teams in PL just have strats that don't involve a Mira. They just don't want to deal with her, so they ban her. She's not OP, she changes the way you attack a site. That's why they ban her.
---
Thanks for the invitation am on PS4 sadly
---
bruh they are announcing it at E3, to sell the game more. So technically you owe us all 20$. So letting you know now my my paypal email is [kai.itsdex@gmail.com](mailto:kai.itsdex@gmail.com). feel free to slip me that 20 when you are ready.
---
What's up with the Mute and Bandit elites? Must be some serious issues if they removed them from the shop...
---
Thanks I guess :D
---
I scrolled past this while journeying to the bottom of the comments after reading the previous comment and then thought to myself "I didn't read what I think I just did, right?"
---
Scrolled back up to find out, and sure enough I did. üòÇ
---
Y‚Äôall did my guy Kaid dirty
---
That gun is looking üî•
---
Millions of lines of handwritten code probably makes room for conflicts. Probably.
---
Yea but wouldnt that make her good? Disrupting the entire enemies play and being able to get valuable information and picks seems pretty good to me.
---
The lord is in the right place
---
Is that a number?
---
can‚Äôt wait to get you tuber charms
---
so that we can get russianbadger charms
---
Isn't clash just autobanned?
---
Woh must be lucky then! Then everything else wont be a problem just take the game slow and remember its not a call of duty game. Play objective!
---
would take away from the game. ppl would be distracted with trash talking and it already takes long enought to type on controllers so it‚Äôll be pretty toxic and game breaking
---
Thats getting fixed in phantom sight thank fuck
---
Well the tone of your video makes it sound like it's a huge issue in R6. It is not. It should have been a video "your placement is wrong". Then you can tell that you don't agree with the devs.
---
But to say that people can blame the game when it's clearly their placement which is at fault, it's not right.
---
I agree you do state at the end of your video that people should stand further away from corners. But imo it should be at the start not at the end.
---
Having lean on circle will lose you gunfights (move right thumb to lean which means you let go of RS) unless you play claw, which is exactly what that guy is trying to avoid.
---
Thanks bro.

It's kingsman theme song ?
---
It‚Äôs really just what you prefer, both are good options
---
*laughs in G8A1*
---
That is why you always shoot out the bottom exteriors of the Mira glass.
---
You aimed and shot right where the top of his head was....you missed btw
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
I haven't had the chance to play but i keep hearing that both new ops are underwhelming.
---
That's true.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a number
---
Im pretty sure these are peanuts....
---
I didn't say you're edgy though, just that as a community R6 has some of the edgiest people I've seen outside of COD back in the day.
---
I just think 3 rounds is too long. If you got a team that's good at defense or attacking then they automatically get a 3 round lead so they just have to pay it safe the next round and take home the win.
---
how is it getting boring when every round is different? don't really understand
---
It's generally not a good idea to fuck with people's vision in competitive shooters. Leave stuff like that for terrorist hunt/situations.
---
He's hostile and toxic. Check top posts on this sub even.

Did you not watch Ubisofts E3?

isn't it illogical that they don't support their most popular Multiplayer game enough and spread out worker's staff to other games?
---
You cant buy them tomorrow.
---
You can earn enough Renown to buy both till they release for everyone.
---
r/birthofareligion
---
Maverick because his m4 is good, and he can be used to breach.
---
Wing's lmg is good. Suppressed it makes no sound when firing in long burst, and her ability is good. 
---
Mute is great for casual play, he has access to the same shotgun as sledge and his gadget absolutely destroys non coordinated teams. 
---
On attack my highest recommendation is Sofia. Her special is ash's, just with the ability to fire disorienting stuns similar to ela mines. She also has access to 3 breach charges, for a total of 5 breaches.  Mozie has good guns
---
Iq
---
it's not though
---
TTS isnt final and it was unintentional idk why you feel the need to spread misinformation when epi confirmed it was unintentional
---
he also streams. salty academy = sixquatre.
---
B-but the AUG isn‚Äôt taking up half the screen! üòâ
---
Looks killer though!
---
My 4 skin would look better on you
---
You can see that on the R6 Website, the R6 Fandom Site and InGame.
---
Because it‚Äôs defense over and over again or attack over and over again. And if you‚Äôre winning attack, you‚Äôre often attacking the same room over and over again.
---
In the test server, not the main build
---
First off all what the hell waswarden doing up there? And those opponents have to be coppers to lose a post plant 5v1 against a three armour one floor above with a bad gun. I know it wasnt ment to replicate the real game but still lmao
---
I will need to see a pic of your sneakers before i can tell
---
Smoke
---
This is very cool
---
I wanna see more stuff like this very creative and just fits with the whole community well done .
---
I really hope Chalet gets the slight map buff it deserves it should be pro league worthy
---
Thiccabae best girl
---
I'm pretty sure it is
---
How do you guys spell Recruit??
---
Is it still not out???
---
Hands down IQ. With comms you can push to their weakest defensive point &amp; exploit what ever set up their running.
---
You look slightly better than her, in a way. The outfit is pretty accurate and captures the fictional character. Nice.

No, what happened?

I mean in a true situation. I once was fuze and friend was lion. Obj was 1 below top floor. Went to top floor. Planted fuze near obj. Friend hit lion. Knew where they all were. Planted fuze on their head and multi kill.
---
Its a cross franchise Mobile game
---
Unacceptable goobisoft unnacceptable
---
Nope, when the season comes out you'll get them then. Other's had to wait an week until they can buy them
---
Same!
---
Just make it so if they leave, they can't rejoin the following round. Or if they leave and join back the following round...they're stuck in spectator mode until the following round. So the punishment would be not being able to play in the next round.
---
Yeah never know if Ubi will take this and make it an operator. But then again I would strongly push for this to be an operator rather than a new universal/somewhat universal attachment.
---
Yeah, it's definitely a far cry from a realistic counter terror unit type game.  That said, they should just run with the game and basically make it "SCP Foundation: The Game".
---
It would make it so you need special devices and creativity to defeat some of these guys. 
---
Maybe some monster has electric abilities?  
---
Well, we have Thatcher EMP for that.
---
Maybe certain creepy eyeless sentinel creatures reactions are predicated on sound, in which case, Cav and Nokk would excel at taking them down. Otherwise, you'd need to use crouch walking just to get in a position to attack them before they get you.  The reason for doing this is that they're strong defensive creatures but when 'sleeping', they have a weak spot that instakills them.
---
Maybe have a Brightburn Superman type boss enemy. You'd need some kind of "kryptonite" infused bomb device that the team has to arm and recharge to slow it down so you can destroy it kinetically.  Basically, run around and dodge its attacks while the timer runs out.  Once that occurs, you give it everything you got.
---
Or a shadowy shifty Lovecraftian boss that bullets don't effect and clouds your vision ala Ela mines that you have to take it out in some creative way that doesn't involve pure kinetic energy. Maybe Valk cams or drones seeing it hurts it as they record the unrecordable horrors/memories of some cosmic horror being.  In which case, you have to place cameras somewhere and move it there for it be physical vulnerable.  Other abilities and devices can hurt it too or leave it vulnerable (ex. flashbangs since they create light).
---
I'd love to see it take a different vision from just mindless shooting endless hordes. The Left4Dead type horde survival aspect should still be there but creative SCP style mini-bosses and main bosses could make for an interesting and unique experience that is unlike any game out there.
---
It was meant to be. Too much of this reddit is BS like this that can be googled in a few seconds
---
Oh it‚Äôs worth it if your going to play it a lot

Holy crap, looks great!

PL teams in NA and EU  play Monty quite often I know for a fact but I am not sure on the Latin America region and how they are with Monty and shields.

Google o'clock

For casual I don‚Äôt think it matters much. It would be nice to be able to play a full game but considering how often people leave a match it makes sense for them to fill the void.
---
This sounds really weird but that sweatshirt looks hella comfortable

Good games stay high in price if they are still highly active throughout the years. never seen blackops 2 under $20 at game stop or anything like that. meanwhile you could get ghost or blackops 3 for like $5 lol
---
C4.
---
Downvote me all you guys want, but am I the only one who's disappointed?  Outbreak was fine but I don't want more Rainbow vs monsters.  
---
I want a PvE event in R6, but I want to see what Rainbow Six is really about. Counter-Terrorism. Not a Monster slayer unit.

Yeah I suppose that's the real question, how much will I actually play.
---
Thanks.
---
1. Mira is good on at least 1 room on every competitive map, but not every room. That‚Äôs why she is situational
---
2. You do realize that I put Hibana at near the top of always a good pick, right? 
---
3. Thanks to Nomads nerf she isn‚Äôt as good, although she is still really good. The reason I said she was situational is because she excels on maps with a lot of run outs or roamers, while on other maps her gadget might not go off once.
---
4. Ela‚Äôs gun is not a headshot machine. Valk‚Äôs gun is a headshot machine. High fire rate, low recoil. And don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúEla‚Äôs gun has no recoil if you control it.‚Äù That‚Äôs true for all guns. By that logic the SMG 11 and 12 are headshot machines.
---
5. Kaid is rarely a better pick than bandit or mute, if ever.
---
6. Rook‚Äôs armor is incredibly undervalued. There is a reason Rook‚Äôs win rate is higher than any other op (except Frost the last 2 seasons). Doc, while he is, in my opinion, less useful than Rook, still sports the same good primary and an ability to heal teammates. IQ counters an insane amount of defenders (she sees invisible gadgets, can see pulse and vigil roaming, shoot ADSs, shock wires, etc through floors/ceilings). On top of this she is a 3 speed with a great primary weapon. If IQ isn‚Äôt a great pick, why don‚Äôt you tell that to the pro league
---
7. Maestro‚Äôs cams have way more counters than echo. Sledge‚Äôs hammer, any explosive, twitch zaps and EMPs open the camera to be shot. Unlike Echo drones, Maestro‚Äôs cams aren‚Äôt invisible and aren‚Äôt mobile.
---
8. On certain rooms Frost demolishes. You just need to know how and where to place her traps. That‚Äôs why I put her in situational.
---
are you on console or pc?
---
AND\* they get more money
---
Tomorrow.
---
After coming back to siege for the first time in a while I definitly feel like sound used to be super 
---
Different. The new sound is really different vertically. You hear vertical sounds louder for some reason.
---
Console.
---
There was once they started a vote to kick me. I chose Valk. They were lucky they went through with it.
---
3 player coop, I hate this.
---
I would recommend it, I have 500 hours In game, but that‚Äôs just me
---
Thanks, you too!
---
Agreed.
---
It was Ela, as per the dev video - https://youtu.be/b3wHIvupJLs
---
What finger do you use? I use my thumb bc it rests near space already and don‚Äôt have much of an issue with it.
---
Great job! I main IQ with that gun skin on the Aug A2 and it looks amazing! Stellar Job!!!!!
---
Ela‚Äôs or Kapkan‚Äôs by far
---
i‚Äôm gonna link you something in a direct
---
Oh please it's an rgb smart fridge
---
i think their point was that if it has a russian origin, we could end up fighting the humans who made this all happen
---
I'm just curious how people find enjoyment playing like that?...
---
When I'm bored enough I set the turret up in a position to help the enemy
---
What was my username
---
sure, [https://imgur.com/a/hXpuc0U](https://imgur.com/a/hXpuc0U)
---
I doubt it. Beta is our outbreak 2
---
Is this Outbreak but in its own game? (Please say yes ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§)
---
So does this mean rainbow 6 siege will bring back outbreak event when the stand alone releases?
---
What...what do you think coop means?
---
That‚Äôs a massive nerf
---
No they are talking EST. It will be released around 1600-1800 GMT (that when all updates normally are released)
---
So phantom sight is out tomorrow? Nice
---
This is a buff. People don't see it, but it is a buff. In what way? Well, I too, had this idea.
---
Traps would have you take heavy damage, sure, but this opens up opportunity to put down more than one. They also Do well to waste time, making it less almost of a binary insta-kill, and more "forced to sit until otherwise."
---
This can actually work too, with both animations of getting out being loud, or so. Either clear first, or risk it all. 
---
3 traps become 5.
---
Damage decreased by 40, making it a 60 damage. 
---
No way to crouch (unless default is crouch lock)
---
5 second solo break, 2-3 second break with teammate.
---
Since their health got butchered, easily make them less noticeable.
---
They're talking out leaving before it even starts. Like the attacker is downed by Cav and then in the time it takes for her to get to the attacker, they've already disconnected.
---
Just for my interest.
---
Which sense do u have in Windows?
---
just sent you a chat.
---
I wish they would ban by IP and not just account.
---
who else recognized the ela's voice before anything was revealed?
---
Gotta make sure every nook and cranny is cleared before getting the hostage out.
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Monty brings a lot to the table, and has also been banned numerous times, depending on the teams playing.
---
You know what I mean fool
---
It pisses me off so much, I haven't said anything about it on here though since fanboys will fanboy.
---
I miss Rainbow Six Raven Shield. Hell I'd even take Vegas at this point.
---
Would really rather they leave the alien/zombie/whatever stuff alone and head in a more terrorist v counter terrorist direction but I‚Äôm still excited for story based R6.
---
thats not the point. Using the same IP even assests. We have invisible OPs and bugged shields in year 4 the QA has serious issues. Throw more resources at the problem instead of launching new IPs or even side project. I hope that clarifies the post
---
I just hope it won't be something as lazy and pointless as that Outbreak thing.
---
In need of Just9n Beaulo and Goldy ubi.
---
I can just hear fortunate son from this
---
Does save the world even get updated now a days?
---
Can't play tachanka without his shield, is that coming back anytime soon?
---
standalone
---
It's a very recent development during the *Special Operation* updates of *Wildlands*. First was *Splinter Cell*, then *Rainbow 6*, *Future Soldier*, then a tie-in for the sequel of *Breakpoint*. And also an appearance by the Predator predating Year 2.
---
Based on the crossovers, it's fairly safe to assume that *Ghost Recon*, *H.A.W.X.*, *Rainbow 6*, and *Splinter Cell* share the [same timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/a9nmye/story_what_is_canon/eckyncq/).
---
Right? At least it would be closer to the base material.
---
Yes it will tomorrow with the new season
---
Only about 2 minutes but it was me and a friend
---
You already know the other team is roasting each other and/or calling him a hacker.
---
I got a survey a month or so back that was basivally asking if i would like a pve rainbow.
---
As i am trash at online, yes. Yes i would.
---
Holy shit, they are actually going to scam people with this pile of trash, arnt they? Zombie games in 2019 BTW.
---
It took me roughly 500 hours to unlock all the operators with the starter edition and quite a few boosters. I thought getting the game for $15 at the time was a steal but honestly it takes a lot of time to unlock all the operators. Looking back, I should have got the deluxe edition but just like you I didn‚Äôt know if I would like the game enough.
---
I‚Äôm super excited for this game
---
Good strats have to start somewhere
---
it's a simple spell but it's quite unbreakable.
---
Zofia, Jackal, Maestro, or Vigil
---
rarely will 2 impacts kill blitz, you will usually need more
---
No operator is useless
---
I'll kill everyone in this subreddit and then myself if someone happens to my thicc boi
---
I was being real with what ubi had said at the time, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not hyped af for quarantine
---
A fellow man of culture I see
---
Jackal, Zofia, and Nomad are all solid choices depending who you already have and what you want to do.  Maverick is a bit more situational but certainly could be a contender depending what you want to do and what your current team's needs are.  It's hard for us to really pinpoint a single attacker for you because we don't know your play style or what your team situation is.
---
It uses a different engine.
---
Another thing I'm not a fan of.
---
Perfect
---
If you put them right under his legs it only takes 2, and if they dont you can tickle his pinky toe with a bullet and dbno him

Haha
---
When pictures are taken in such a way to highlight certain features is it so wrong for someone to comment?
---
This mission is hell but to be honest, you don't have to buy it if you don't like it. Burn out occurs in game design and this might be a preventative measure.
---
Splish Splash your opinion in trash...first of all TACHANKA IS A GOD
---
The game stops attempting to find a replacement once the match reaches match point.  However, if you join a game mid-round when the opponents have 1 win on the board and your team loses that round you have to spectate, you can wind up on match point by the time you first get to play in the match.
---
Same, ima be away over seas soon an wont have any rb6 with me so hopefully it‚Äôs like it but who knows probably not
---
Amazing! This is escorting-pro-teams-in-pro-league worthy cosplay!

Holograms aren't the crazy part about alibi, its the tracking of your location using nothing but the current postition of a remotely controlled drone. How about Vigil making himself invisible to drones?  Tracking heartbeats through walls? A device the size of a sheet of paper, that catches grenades with perfect accuracy? I could go on.

I'm not buying, I'm just disappointed that, as a fan of Tom Clancy, that they are taking this route.
---
Oh no
---
The fact that you have almost half a year invested in this game and can't even get past the middle of the bell curve explains a lot about how irrelevant your opinions are, and how little you grasp of anything even remotely important.
---
Anyone who finds unbalanced content more fun than balanced content has the the mental capacity of a fried spud that's been kicked under a carpet and forgot about for a decade, and nobody ever has said Tower is a good map that should stay in the pool, in fact an overwhelming majority of players that have enough playtime to have a relevant opinion say Tower should be at LEAST removed from ranked pool because it's such an unbalanced map. 
---
So not only is saying "pro-balance is anti-fun" absolutely bonedead stupid, if it was in any way possible to perceive that as a proper, correct observation, you could not have picked a more polar opposite map to pair your claim with. 
---
You're literally too stupid and ill informed to realize that your own argument counters itself twice. Your opinion is irrelevant, but I realize you won't be able to accept and understand that, so I prepared a [mirror for you to talk into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEo_thYmg3s) (the blue text means you can click on it btw) since I'm not gonna be reading or responding to anything else you say.

Here to find out the same thing

That‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs struggle as far as I know. 
---
It‚Äôs a rollercoaster. The more you play, the better you get, but there are so many things to learn other than getting kills. You‚Äôre still learning angles, callouts, good positioning as you play everyday. Just keep trodding on and work on your game.
---
in youtube ubisoft says: is new three-player tactical co-op shooter.

If it keeps the quality of the game high then I appreciate it. You can't do the same thing over and over. Are they calling it a tom clancy btw?

The skin is really nice, good work!

It takes place on planet Ooobesks in the year 252525 on the interdimensional calendar.

yeah i thought so too. But this one pretty much went "England did brexit, now we got a tyranical goverment and mass survilains everywhere because of it"
---
True coppers go up top and open this hatch before the round starts.
---
(True story: As Smoke I once opened this hatch before the round - it was casual after all - and then went and hid nearby. Three of the attacking squad happily jumped down and I lobbed a couple toxic babes after them. Hilarity ensued.)
---
I hope they carry over
---
Ah, I missed that, thanks!
---
Good days bad days. Maybe you ranked up a bit? Didn‚Äôt get a good sleep &amp; aren‚Äôt thinking as clear or reacting as fast? More noobs on during the weekend than Monday evening? Lots of potential reasons, no way for the reddit community to know why.
---
Skin actually glows, 11/10 take notes ubisoft
---
Couple reasons. First could be it was a free weekend and there was a lot of very new players such as yourself. Also there is a casual MMR that is constantly going up and down while you play. Also it just could be a mental thing. I know me and my friends have a day here and there where we just suck and to be honest most people aren‚Äôt pros and in a game like siege you get punished for having an off day. Also checking your settings if you‚Äôre PC since it can reset every now and then.

There are three primary benefits to having a 3-round rotation.
---
1. If you fail to win in a round you can immediately fix what you did wrong and execute the new strategy.  When teams alternate, you have to remember what aspects you flubbed two rounds earlier and execute.  It's much easier when it's back-to-back.
---
2. The team can get itself into a rhythm on attack and defense much more easily.

3. I know your attitude toward the pro game isn't good, but Ubisoft does still need to consider players who watch professional play.  By having ranked mirror the format of pro matches the game players watch on Twitch feel more accessible than when the rule set is completely different.  There are players of every rank who watch professional gameplay and even if they don't aspire to be pros themselves it helps them to understand what's going on and possible even apply what they see when they get into the game.
