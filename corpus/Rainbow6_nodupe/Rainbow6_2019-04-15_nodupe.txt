No problem. Also if you wanna do a prebuilt look into the NZXT BLD service. It will let you pick out the parts and all of that and only charge you a $100 dollar build fee.

Sorry to tell you, but a large part of the community is pretty toxic. Some guy tried to vote kick me in t-hunt because I got the op her wanted. He proceeded to harass me the entire game.

Custom flair gang
---
Did they directly mean to do this? No it’s a fucking bug.
---
Sweet. Ill look into that.
---
Now go ahead and pass those plates around. Customers are coming!
---
Shut
---
I could be totally wrong but I remember Havoc being the name of the player and not any specific operator because I think Ubisoft thought rivalries would start to form between teams playing siege
---
I’m not sure you understand what a bug is
---
first of all it was a joke dummy, second of all i uploaded it straight from xbox, and third what did i spell wrong? youre such a faggot you had to reply and act like a dick; get a life
---
I honestly wish they kept with defenders being terrorists, it would be interesting to see how those character would be written as, but I can see why they ditched it, you don’t really want to be a video game that advertises terror groups to its audience
---
Mines gotta be blitz in T-hunt its a convo btw
---

---
Blitz:Anyone bringthe spare ammo?
---
Other op:No 
---
Blitz:Well then
---
Imagine a ugandan person saying that🤔
---
Thicc skulled my friend
---
I honestly don't remember, if I had to guess I'd probably say yes because this was the first day the map was out and I had no clue where anything was.
---
Why post it??? Just to ruin people’s games for the ass hats that choose to do it?
---
The lag is gone lmfao

I don't think it's that simple though.  Government agents had information that there was a cult which was abusing children and stockpiling weapons.  They did their legal due diligence to secure the appropriate paperwork beforehand, when they were attacked by the cult.  They can't just back down and leave them alone after that, because it would embolden other cults to just shoot at government agents whenever they want to harm kids.  So, like any determined agency, the ATF fought back with the help of the FBI, and right as they were about to secure the compound, the Branch Davidians started three fires and hijacked the narrative to be one of government overreach rather than cults literally doing what cults always do: maintaining control over their members to the point of death.  These weren't a group of innocent people minding their own business and legally purchasing firearms.  This was Jonestown part 2: Texas Boogaloo, starring David Koresh, the monster who'd rather burn children alive than get arrested and fight his case in court.
---
Sledge and hibana are also in my pc. 😂
---
How much connection is there between the real world and siege? Lmao
---
Get echo or Capitao, others can wait, but those two have too much utility
---
It just promotes a toxic environment and almost always just leads to more tking and ends in a wipe in my experience.
---
Can literally only use her shotty.

Nice acce but sry no respec for using p90
---
Why are you asking us? You either like it or you don't..
---
Siege was released before that even happened.
---
Most of the time it's dumb luck and practice. a lot of the spots I'll struggle with for 10 mins in a custom game and then be able to do it 100% of the time
---
The best is when assholes shot you just to do just enough damage but not kill you.

Great video

And I thought it was funny so posted it

In my experience, mostly at Gold 1, an interrogation can cost the defending team just as much if not more than it helps a lot of the time. There's been dozens of times my team has had an interrogation and then everyone was to go chase kills and I end up like 1v3 out of nowhere or something.

It's nothing but smurf accounts. I have checked it out. My buddy that bought the game on sale tried to play it but it's purely nothing but assholes. Your seriously better off playing casual as a new player.
---
It's why as much as friendly fire adds to the tension in a game like this I'm usaully against. It just lends itself to shitty toxic behavior. And why a big part of me just wants ubi to remove it from ranked. And just leave the ability to accidentally destroy Friendly devices and the hostage. Because while it adds to the game without a major punishment for it a lot of people will just abuse it because they're a fucking dick with the temper of a 3 year old.

The Original Lord Tachanka beta version/ pre operation health.

I think that the blame lies mostly on Koresh for extending the battle so long. If he'd given up, a lot of casualties on both sides could have been avoided.
---
Except they had a warrant, and Koresh was guilty of child sex abuse.
---
I didn't say this clip was insane gameplay. I posted my first ace. No need to be rude.
---
This is annoying, i've had far too many events where something gets in the way, even holes in walls tend to be different for players. They should really remove client sided events, to some extent. Cause this game just feels broken and unfair. i feel this should have been dealt with some time ago.

That is consistently my favorite map. That and Outback. Idk why, but the urban setting and general close quarters action appeals to me.

Still neat to hear about the gign one though. I just remembered the gsg9 one as it is often considered the textbook example of a counter terrorism operation.

did i want this? no

did i need this? possibly

 from what I know, thermite charges have always had a larger area of effect than normal breaching charges. But it's defiantly worth a try, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

I recommend getting jackal as soon as you can after I am basically a jackal main and find him to be one of the best ops in the game

I still perfer having a sight but if it came to only that it is usable

It also reminds me that I've got to start recording my Alpha pack openings.

You can't shoot out impacts. It was most likely the 3-second timer, or it hit an entity such as the wall or possibly even the camera, though I doubt the camera could cause the impact to explode.
---
What is with ubisoft and cults lmao

I'm assuming it's basically "ATF stands for Armed Terror Force and Koresh &amp; Co. were actually just regular people"?

Not like I'm against that or anything. Truth is more important to me, but hey.

The old one isn't very balanced, but the map size overall was good.

The new one top floor is kinda hard to take, and the map size overall is just way too big.

How the fuck would I know

vroom vroom one
---
And Coastline is based on a real Spanish Nightclub massacre
---
On subsequent analysis, the grenade happened to explode just a few frames before you had shot; it would take a few more frames too in order to register server-side, thus, your shot only hit the camera.

I am sure they were trying to get both Ruby Ridge that took place in Naples, Idaho, a state that boarders Oregon, and Waco in the same map. There is a theory that connects Ruby Ridge, Waco, and the Oklahoma City Bombing.  The Last Podcast on the Left really does a great job of providing the details of all of it.

This is true. Being part of a militia and very radical 2nd amendment felt the govt. Was to blame for what happened and wanted revenge. If I remember the office he blew up had nothing to do with intial Waco siege
---
They still have spats of course - but nowadays is nothing compared to those years. The ATF is in a weird place because it would have been abolished or folded if guns weren't such a big thing to manage. I heavily doubt that you could hand all of the stuff they do to another agency and expect the amount of manpower to be reduced (therefore saving tax dollars). You would be getting the same result but under a different 3 letter agency. If you want a really useless agency than look no further than the DHS or Department of Security Threatre as I call it. They waste far more money than the ATF does and at least the ATF actually *does* things.

Yes it is, just saying in the book there is a lot of similarities of the house being in the mountains. With artifacts and a helicopter pad. So the idea could come from the book. If you wanted to liken it to a real world scenario the closest thing i could think is the Ruby Ridge incident even though it wasnt a huge home with a helicopter pad.

All the people in the trailer had names, all of them were just playing recruits with different load outs so not really gonna happen it was just part of this gimmick in the trailer where players were supposed to have a rivalry with someone they played versus in the past

What level are you? I've noticed since i got to a higher level and people can see my kd i don't get tked as much. My kd isn't even that high it's just .8 but i guess that's enough to stop most people from tking me. When i first started playing in late 2017 almost every game i played i got tked and it seems like people will just kill you for being low level or if you have a low kd. Its really stupid and i can't wait for a system to punish toxic players.
---
Might have to do with the fact that it's a decline and faster operators will have more space when walking down the decline. It's hard to explain without an illustration but because they go faster they stay higher longer when going down a decline.

This is true. CS teaches the twitch, flick, and peeking skills. Those are helpful skills in any FPS game.

---
I don’t agree with that, a versatile spot doesn’t mean you play there every round but bookshelf should probably only be used like once per game max, there are plenty of spots you can play 3-5 times in a game easily without much risk along with being able to play them at any point in the match especially on sites, obviously it depends on the map and enemy operators but there are some pretty safe locations that are hard to push no matter the enemy line up making them pretty safe to play multiple times 
---
Bookshelf is usually a pretty high risk medium reward spot as there are so many angles you can get hit from the only good part about it generally is that you can watch office door/ office window (but realistically they should prefire you through office window so even that is debatable)
---
Some one who is helping there fellow siege community members that are "stuck" in the low ranks .who boosts players to ranks there just going to derank there self back to the rank there "stuck" at while the smurf is just moving on up in the ranks .
---
Shit the fuck up. Toxic Redditers, am I right? I'm not a fuckin child, it's not my fault people like u are trash at this game so u go and ruin it for the other players who actually have skill
---
Next time you do this turn off hud, it can be seen for a sec since the hammer moves across it. Nice job tho
---
You found an angle and that requires experience. But at the same time you move around by crouch walking and that is noob as heck. 
---
I don't know what to think.
---
Just a question since I'm not too bright in video editing. Would you have to redo the project from scratch if you were to rerecord it without the ui?
---
Or could you just use the same masking for the same frames (aka align it to when the animation starts) for the new recorded clip?

Oh sweet, ,my bad didnt read the latest tts notes.

If you go into a tactical realism custom game or turn the points off you can get rid of the points. I know it’s a bit nit picky and all but really great job!

The problem is that 3 armor isn't as useful as 3 speed. Getting somewhere faster is better than surviving more bullets in a game where headshots always kill.

They have,  since the 90s. Before we even had siege, there was going to be Rainbow Six: Patriots which ended up becoming Siege and The Division(correct me if im wrong about the division).

He doesn't counter jackal, but he counter lion
---
Really? I’ve always heard people calling him underpowered. I can agree with arguments on both sides though. I remember hearing Ubisoft wanted to rework him. Wonder what they’ll do.

To get 11k hours in 633 days you need to play around 17 hours every single day. Not even Pengu or other guys who play Siege for a living are playing that much. So stop spreading bullshit.

I main frost but kapkan is better so long as u think through where you'll mount the traps. Put them at ankle height, and put yourself in the attackers shoes. Think about how to make your traps invisible to them. Most people just throw the shit on the door frame and walk away. Frost mats are pretty much confined to windows and shields.
---
Yeah i'm pretty sure that this is a scam attempt

Frost mats with a lesion trap next to them 😫😫😫

Sledge is a very well rounded attacker. You got the hammer, nades, great rifle, even when using ACOG. Twitches rifle is arguably one of the best in the game. Drones can be useful.  Jackal is good too, with his tracking and both his guns are pretty decent. And thermites rifle hits hard, and his thermite breaches are very useful.
---
SLEDGE FOR OVERALL ATTACKER CHOICE
---
Defender I'd say lesion. SMG low recoil, mines are an incredible tool if used properly. Jager had a good rifle, easy to use. For more serious and advance play caveira or Mira are pretty great. Mira's SMG murders when you control the kicks and are good at landing shits from bullet #1. Window is a great tool for quick peaks when you find out all the right spots. If you enjoy sneaking around, you understand the layouts of the maps well when checking came, and have a good ear, Cav can be very deadly. 
---
LESION OR MIRA
---
That's my take. In the end it depends on your style.
---
Probably because you live near the server. The WEU server is somewhere in the Netherlands(around Amsterdam i think).
---
Your work of art is missing a watermark. Finders keepers
---
Screenshot? I can't find it. Also what gun does dokkaebi have that can do the required 51 single shot damage against doc at close range? Her mk14 does 60 damage at point blank and the three armor multiplier drops that to 48 damage per shot. bosg does way too much damage at that range.
---
Hate playing against those docs, love playing with them 😂

nah it should absolutely be Ned Kelly inspired

So, how do do you go about doing what you just did there? Do you manually mask each indivodual frames 1 by 1? Could you not automate it ? Like to automaticaly mask out a predifined background?

You hit his like stomach area &amp; Bandito responded in an ouch causing his head to have an animation of it moving down for some reason &amp; that cause the hitbox to move which explains why when you shot him in the head sparks came out, meaning your shot hit the aluminum in the back. I believe this is what happened.
---
If he doesn’t share it then he’s probably cheating tbh
---
If you're interested in retaining a playerbase you need to care about the feel of stuff. It does matter that something makes players upset.
---
Game design is more than what's balanced or you'd allow for really stupid things that are balanced but aren't fun for anyone. For example I could make a balanced character that had a gadget that revealed everyone on both teams when used. Balanced as both sides see it, but why would anyone want to play a game with that?
---
I swear to god, my squad and i did this just yesterday, except we're okaying fuze instead of jackal. And we finished the round in within 45 second. Afraid of our team getting the same treatment, we decided to play just what you said. Lesion, Kapkan, Ela, Frost, Clash. Result? 3 guys from their team go DC

Thanks, I'll keep it in mind. I already own Sony Vegas however.

Everyone has a burnout at some point or other where it just feels like a chore to play the game.
---
I tend to invest more time in other games when it happens and try to play a game or two every so often. Eventually something happens in those games that helps me start playing regularly again.
---
I have a platinum charm on my shield here :D I'm bronze 2 because I played a lot solo + drunk the last couple of weeks... well, at least I'll have my gold charm at the end of the season xD

He was out too long and red thing gone he probably bought he attacker

It's not really a game you can go straight on a after a hard day of work is what the main problem is if I'm honest

i see the mp100 influence lol

When your aim is so bad 1 hipfire is more accurate than 7 shots aim down sight 
---
Lol jk, that’s some insane luck though

Jackal and Vigil. Their guns are very powerful
---
The rest of us do..
---
So it's a new Burnt Horizon skin?
---
It’s kinda the opposite for me. I still watch Siege videos and try to keep up to date with news, I just don’t feel like playing as of late.
---
We're all different tho
---
Yeah
---
Which dlc operator would you recommend
---
An R6 logo would've worked better lmao
---
GIANT recruit is GIANT
---
That's normally what I do as well but I cba even watching it now which is new for me
---
From what I remember at least part of the fire was directly caused by the tear gas grenades. They’re a chemical start, meaning when first ignited you get a pretty hot flame shooting out one end as the chemical composition reacts to create the gas

Wait did you just kill someone-

No. No I refuse to believe that.

Ive had every dlc op from year 1 to year 4 UwU

Now I gotta ask: Dis you really adjust the mask for every frame? I‘d never have the patience to do that...
---
Surely there would be some way to determine people leaving due to poor internet and people intentionally leaving as to intentionally leave you would have to click the return to menu button.
---
Then again the leavers would probably just disconnect rather than use the button so that probably wouldn't work.
---
No problem.. It just pisses me off, I hope this gets fixed. Otherwise I wasted my money for nothing
---
Yeah Waco siege failed because their lousy Ash rushed in and died too quick without droning, so they waited till the end of the round (51 days) and pushed at the last second without numbers and it didn't work. They won the next round on Upstairs attack though. GGs no re

No he doesn’t - thatcher’s vest has no pouches or anything.
---
To be fair I dont mean peak, i mean he get to the highest level you can possibly get to, peeked.
---
Peak is in like a mountain top or when you're at top of something
---
Peek when you press E Q
---
No it's primarily because of PL now. Being 6 months, and new ops coming into the meta 3 months late, and Balancing team taking longer for detailed changes have slowed down the variation compared to before. Which is why many feel that way.
---
The cycle is fine the way it is. Doesn't need changes. Just that balancing team should work quicker.
---
Got about 1500-1700 hours across my accounts and I don't enjoy it like I used to because of this shite.
---
Yes I know. Peak is the word. You can say that he peaked at something. Peek is like when you press  E or Q

it's mighty hard to get anything done man, especially since alot of other fps games have the same punishment and reward system for a whole team

May your hit reg actually work, my humble servant.
---
Have been on holiday for a couple months now so I could be wrong, but have the devs not introduced a system where after a player has team killed once, all damage then on done to teammates is redirected unto the shooter - or something along those lines. 
---
 I agree though this game in its current state is super toxic and I think it comes from the little interaction with the community
---
I know, but i feel it can be done over time

Time for some serious protection.

---
I think the last few seasons have really added to my fatigue with this game. Matchmaking is terrible and has made almost no improvement, Fortress and Outback are awful maps IMO; they lack fluidity and cohesiveness and that really ruins the experience. The last 4 operators have also been quite a disappointment for me. Hopefully next season is one for the books
---
Was follow the god damn train!
---
Nobody likes it. “Too big”, “Too open”, and “Bland” were the reasons I heard about it
---
They currently do it on the average rank of the whole squad, so two or three very low mmr players and two high ones can only really average out at a high silver-gold enemy. And also this will always be a problem due to smurfs and players purposely down ranking, they can try fixing it but it’s like throwing a cup of water at a burning house.

&gt;you need to learn to read
---
Learn to read? You need to learn exaggeration.
---
&gt;No, utter nonsense that unless you can somehow force people to play together than the game is hopeless.
---
I said there's no hope in a game where everyone does what you want. Never said the game itself was hopeless, just the idea that everyone will act a certain way because as i stated, people have free will and will always be able to do what they want.
---
Well, to start, she moved from Israel to the US and transferred to the FBI.  No big puzzle there.  The mossad did have one operative in Rainbow in the book, but he was a techie.  She could also be a reference to Ziva David from the show NCIS who is a Mossad agent transferred to the American NCIS as a secret sort of mole at first, then a full NCIS agent later.
---
Theres nothing stolen here... what?

An Intel i5 8400/9400, or better. Siege likes single threaded performance over just more cores so don't bother with AMD unless you want to do more than just play Siege (i.e. stream, render videos, etc.)
---
16Gb of RAM, 2666mhz or faster. RAM is.
---
Whatever GPU you can afford while fitting in your budget. Ideally, better than a 1050Ti though a 1050Ti will run the game well. The newer 1660 and 1660Ti would be a better choice, or even the Vega 56 now that they can be had for around £250

They also took the hostage in a tour around the house before escaping to the window they entered right in front of the hostage.

The whole thing is upside down.

I like to switch between operators most of the time but I mostly play Ela. I can't really tell you whos good since it really depends on your kind of playstyle but i can tell you who not to get from my experience.  The operator i don't recommend it's Ela actually.  Yes i main the operator i think sucks the most.  Right now she's the worst roamer hands down and get weapons don't make up for that. Her shotgun is okay but that's the only foods thing about her asides her actual character to me. Get scorpion is pathetic really and the pistol is average. Her mines are okay in some situations but in most they just act as a annoyance or target for any twitch drone. Every other roamer in game offers a lot more than her and unlike her haven't been nerfed 6 times and thats only to the public knowledge of her nerfs. But hey that's just my opinion.  And she in my eyes does have the pinky good character in the game to me so if you like that than you'd probably like her.
---
Defence: Frost/Jäger
---
Attack: Thatcher/Fuze

I only picked year 2 cause i have 20000 renown and i dont like the year 3 ops so i wanted to buy a good recommended attacker for year 2

So in this case no one would be banned but it would be extremely frustrating causing them to quit trying and issue a refund for the service without realising they technically got banned

How can u get that much kills while I can’t even find a good place for his LMG
---
I hate having a teammate with that
---
Yeah but since some people like me started out in Year 2, it is unclear to us who the Year 2 operators are.
---
In fact I still don't know who the original operators are, who the DLC operators are and who the Year 2 operators are.
---
Only confirmed new operators I have come across were added as I started playing seriously in Operation Health, so the Zofia sisters, the Ying, the Koreans and I'm probably missing someone because that's an odd number.
---
I’ve played this game for like three years and I never thought to hold that angle ._.
---
If you've been to HK, you'd say it's not China. The only thing that's the same is the army and the land. Eevrything else is different.

Let’s not forget that he had a copy of the [The Turner Diaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries)
---
“A 1978 novel by William Luther Pierce, The Turner Diaries depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the federal government, nuclear war, and, ultimately, a race war leading to the systematic extermination of non-whites. All groups opposed by the novel's protagonist, Earl Turner, including Jews, non-whites, ‘liberal actors’ and politicians are exterminated.”
---
The Turner Diaries is the origin of the concept of the “day of the rope”,  where all “race traitors” are murdered and hung from the street lights and trees.
---
Slow peek*
---
And you hold the Alt button, it slows you down.
---
That's actually quite high
---
her pistol is 1 of 2 guns i have black ice for, if someone goes in the trap i will finish them with the black ice even if i get killed trying
---
Hmm maybe that's why everyone left
---
 Bravo dude. This is an incredible kill for being 2 days in
---
I also got it 2 days ago
---
k

---
2 days and you've got better angles than me
---
What a glitch
---
Timothy McVeigh, convicted for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, was found after the attack with pages from The Turner Diaries. His attack closely resembled the bombing of FBI headquarters in the novel.
---
The Anti-Defamation League identified The Turner Diaries as "probably the most widely-read book among far-right extremists; many [of them] have cited it as the inspiration behind their terrorist organizing and activity.
---
I'm gonna jump in to R6S here in the next couple days, buying it on sale actually. Cannot decide between the $17 sale, which gives year 1 operatprs and a few other things, or I believe the $30 sale for year 1 ops, seasom 4 pass, and other things. As a noob coming in blind, would the basic $17 bundle suffice?
---
That.. ok that doesnt make sense but aight
---
wow
---
Have they ever heard of spacing
---
Eh. Reminds me more of the rook elite.
---
If it was very good why was smoke/sledge or hibana/echo NEVER even marginally high on the win delta
---
Dang they deleted it :/
---
Peak is the highest level.
---
And ash
---
Because the two aren't necessarily linked.
---
That's basically me but instead I use the worst things for cover as I do this. In fact I went 9 and 3 in a game last week against diamonds because of this.
---
Face of Maestro body of Elite Lardex
---
Why is messi a better footballer than someone else who has invested the same time into practising? 
---
Some people are just bad at what they do.
---
Remember, half the playerbase of any game is below average. Not all of those are newbies.
---
I know but the face reminds me on Maestro
---
When he pulls his phone out for a Logic Bomb he unwraps a TimTam lmao
---
That these 2 nerfs were on overpicked but not overpowered ops doesn't mean that the nerfs happened because they were overpicked...
---
**A cgi artist frond out he has to make holes in a wall for a cgi FPS video**
---
This is amazing! Well done!
---
Ash has always been high on pick rate and above average win delta. she still is. you don’t know what you’re talking about
---
&gt; Not only, but yes, a big part of it was
---
So when you said Ash was quite literally done because of pickrate you were just joking?
---
&gt;If you go to the old patch notes, where they announced the removal of the ACOG, the first words were 'Ash is very popular,'
---
And that somehow means that was the only piece of data that was considered?
---
listen I know there is other data such as kdr and headshot ratio this is a debate/discussion it is not my job to inform you on other stats you have that burden and "wow" is quite a shity comback my respoce had you given other stats would be that the transmit to the Win delta which they have not
---
&amp; logic
---
Ash was picked in over 70% of games for pure gunplay unlike jager who while his speed and gun are a big part So is his ADS as he is the only anti grenade op. The machine pistol nerf was a bit harsh but meant to make sure that secondary’s didn’t overshadow primaries in a game about headshots most of the time faster firerate is better
---
Clash don't need ACOG as she's fit for close combat
---
Didn’t knew there was a Dio somewhere

I apologize, I thought that his aug was a rifle since it is described as a rifle in other games.
---
Because mozzi is short and gridlock is thicc
---
Pure filth my dude
---
Brazilian calls him montanha (mountain in portuguese) is much more easy for us call him this way
---
That would be hilarious
---
Do you even slav bro?
---
Amazing! I absolutely have to know where you got, or how you made the jacket.
---
&gt;listen I know there is other data such as kdr and headshot ratio
---
Back to "wow"
---
&gt; "wow" is quite a shity comback 
---
When you're asking about what other data besides delta &amp; pickrate could be useful it's all the question warrants.
---
You really need to use some punctuation.
---
After how many hours?
---
You should be in pro league
---
Well it’s a conversion from one but even if it was a rifle it still wouldn’t be unfair
---
Ya 2.4k elite ppl

About time. It’s been almost 90 freaking days.
---
You have ruined maestro for me. Congratulations
---
welcome to console siege.
---
How do I get one of those character main things
---
50-80% of this sub would say the same 
---
I wouldn’t cause I don’t enjoy third/fist person switching in games 
---
But this is your favourite game and I hope you can enjoy it
---
&gt;So when you said Ash was quite literally done because of pickrate you were just joking?
---
I never said she was nerfed only because of pick rate. 
---
&gt;And that somehow means that was the only piece of data that was considered?
---
Again, I never said pick rate was the only thing. And again, that's just proving the decision was heavily based upon her pick rate.
---
Rip does it improve at higher ranks or is this it
---
You are very correct, however, why does it matter that she was picked even 100% of the time if it isn't leading to a easier win or giving a significant advantage then its fine by me.
---
P.S. I made this more for the SMGs but ash is a hot topic 
---
P.S.S. look at what happened to Smoke after the smg update R.I.P. my old friend
---
Random question, how do you get “recruit main” next to your name?
---
Nevermind got it
---
Maybe turn off the points too? Then it'd be dope.
---
Idk why Gridlock has the super shorty. She’s a reasonable height
---
at higher ranks it becomes so and so, it's not completely toxic but I can certainly tell you it becomes blatantly unfair, mnk users up the ass, some trash talkers.
---
Jackal because I generally play a lurk heavy play style waiting for attackers so I can attack and then my ambush is ruined by “Someone is Tracking You!”
---
I’ve been playing t-hunt with guns I’ve never had the courage to use against real people. I also found doing dumb stuff like recruit maining really brought the game back to life for me.
---
Region?
---
Honesty, Barlette and Plane maybe. The rest are absolutely ass cheeks when it comes to ranked.
---
Switch favela and tower

Whilst I don't blame them as everyone is entitled to their own interpretation of how the game can be played, I think part of it comes down to a lot of YouTubers and how their content makes the game look. The YouTubers I'm talking about are ones like TuxBird and Snedger who really just fuck about most of the time, usually with parties of 5 so they are not really causing much harm to anyone but the kids watching the videos who think 'YES! This game looks so fun!!' go on and act like this playing by themselves with 4 randoms.
---
Like I said, I don't blame them, at the end of the day they are lining their pockets and making quality content but I can't help feeling like they have an overall negative impact on the game.
---
It's pretty much all tryhards who are bad at being tryhards in gold and plat and diamond are where you usually find more high skill players and maybe the occasional hacker

---
You said that she was "[quite literally](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bdgqz1/why_are_we_buffingnerfing_ops_on_pick_rate/ekxypqk/)" nerfed because of pick rate.
---
&gt;Again, I never said pick rate was the only thing.
---
I'm afraid you did.
---
&gt;And again, that's just proving the decision was heavily based upon her pick rate.
---
Not sure how you came to that conclusion.

Oh god oh fuck oh god oh shit

Oh no

Random question, do y'all know if the Rainbow is Magic stuff disappears tomorrow when the update comes, or today? I wanted to buy the collection for a friend.
---
I think the only other thing they really need to add other then that is matchmaking changes. Right now that is probably the most frustrating thing about this game is when you are playing a 5 man stack that are all golds and the enemy team has a platinum and above, that’s just not fun or fair to go against. The matchmaking needs to be centered around the highest rank in your squad so boosting will go away. This alone will be a very healthy change to Ranked. As for maps the only map I want gone is Chalet (and Kafe but that is getting fixed next season) because it is such a restrictive map for both attackers and defenders. The rest of the maps are fine.
---
Everybody totally missing that there are pro league players out there also having a say into all of this ????  
---
If we primarely used these stats Lion should never have bee nerfed and Cav would have been nerfed a lot more than with her pistol change.
---
Yeppity yep. The community is fine to me after 200+ hrs playing, sometimes we get salty kids but mostly its just ppl who chill all the time

I was with you up to ash with shield

Marmite is better than the shotty, idk why anyone would take shotty until Marmite is nerfed

Yes, but it's time consuming to get good, learn maps etc. and it's much better with with friends
---
The Everest
---
I thought it was fan art until I read the Caption ;D 
---
Great job!
---
I got the Tachanka unicorn from it which was only item I liked from the collection so it was worth it lol.
---
But I can feel you I often get only some charms too ;(
---
I finally got it posted, the link is here: https://youtu.be/9_eKkJPJoEA
---
He made them himself
---
What do you mean 'a'
---
No way, no need
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
---
it takes 2 seconds to counter the new nerf btw , when playing Maestro
---
Nope but soon it will be remade and I'll show it :)
---
Good
---
Thank you so much :3
---
Also no one really plays twitch just to counter echo. That’s what IQ is for
---
it only on that game mode dont worry.
---
Bruh, no. Everything in the match making is the same except you aren’t playing a five stack unless you are a 4 or 5 stack. There is enough people playing this game to do that.
---
It is the new camera perspective while leaning that is messing people up. Beforehand the camera was placed slightly next to your head while leaning, now it's placed directly between your eyes at all time.  
---
This meaning that normal perspectives play into siege, aka holding an angle close to a corner will make some peeking that corner from further away see you before you see them.
---
If you buy for the here and now, you get the performance you want right now. 
---
Been through it all myself over the past couple years with a Ryzen 1600, changed motherboard’s twice for it and bought Samsung B die memory to eek out more performance before selling it and switching to an i5 9600K last year.
---
For anyone looking to download this file, I uploaded it to my Youtube as well, the link for the direct video is here: https://youtu.be/9_eKkJPJoEA
---
Have fun!
---
Tryna make an Australian joke but you dont even have a golden gaytime
---
only get it if you are above average in skill and have a MINIMUM of 3 other people to play with at all times. Otherwise, skip over this.
---
&gt;He's popular and incredibly useful in higher ranks and PL
---
thats being too generous, he was average pick rate in a game with 2 ops that had 0.
---
I do like most of the maps but you got to admit, we have like 12 maps in the pool. It's a bit excessive. Proleagues only use 7 I believe.
---
I think you mean lardex the destroyer of buffets
---
General Tachanka
---
# PARKOUR
---
Why do people play Secure Area in competitive? Just stick to Bomb
---
the trouble that other guy went through masking sledge hammer frame by frame in vegas and you just come here and say hold my beer... LMAO.
---
but now seriously , this is a nice feature.
---
Twitch can shoot the evil eye out as the casing opens. Maestro can’t shoot until the casing fully opens. 2 seconds isn’t really that short when people know how to aim.
---
I didnt even notice it! It's in such a weird spot, and I'm still getting used to this map.
---
Blitz is fine its just annoying to die against.
---
*distant 'cunts' can be heard across the outback*
---
Here’s a thought, rank doesn’t matter. As it stands your rank doesn’t pertain to your actual skill. It just means you win/lose a lot, which is kinda an indicator of how good you are but not really since if you play in a five man squad in ranked then I would say it reflects your squads skill as a whole.
---
People who make fun of each other solely based off their rank are just really insecure and think they are better then everyone else when in reality they have only made the jump in rank before the guy they have made fun of has and were once in their shoes.
---
Ok I thought it was fan art
---
Yeah. I feel like 33 damage for the  AUG is more than enough. It will become really viable I believe.
---
Also Kaid shotgun’s seems awesome for soft destruction.
---
It’s addicting
---
I’m aware, but a twitch drone is still a hard counter to a yokai.
---
Glaz got his thermal scope in a mid-season reinforcement. That completely fucked the pro league season. The major change this time won't affect PL since Lion is permabanned anyway.
---
Not even close to the early seasons
---
look at the amount of DETAILS in this artwork.
---
Care to provide some examples?
---
I agree with the rest of the nerfs but I don't really like the blitz nerf. I don't think he is really that bad, just crossfire him like any other shield or run trap operators. I have a feeling ubi will accidentally nerf him into a useless state.
---
Put a sight on that gun
---
grats. I have all except mozzie. and that's only cause i haven't just unlocked him yet w/ renown-lazy. had all around 170 ish? i thought it was normal
---
Side freezing damage
---
LMFAO this is some fuckin year 1 operator trivia type shit. GUYS diD yOu kNoW gLaZ mEaNs EYE. WOW guys I’m so clever and on top of my game.
---
He definitely was strong imo but 7 seconds is overkill. 4-5 would've been okay, 7 is too much.
---
Yes you can.
---
How do I put that main thing in my name ?
---
r/subsiwishwerereal
---
Uh? That's not how you spell blitz

Look at the wrench in the side

After Red crow they all became carbon copies with small details changed.

No then she’s definitely lose her acog

Might have more with these changes though, or at least a more engaging playstyle
---
that actually looks so cool! I'll DEFINITELY spend my renown on alpha packs if this actually exists
---
Isn't there some option to know the difference between crash and exiting?
---
I played with friends the game crushed they won, i lost points. So i see what you say.
---
Maverick on Favela , if they're on 3rd floor , i would say to them : OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU

Rook is better for spawnpeeking because he can set his armor and go don’t @ me
---
I respect this comment because of Tachanka
---
r/wosh
---
Platinum, and mira can spank anyone rushing with DPS galore
---
Lesions 2 speed but I agree. The only thing I could see as a reason to play Ela is her large mag and super fast firerate, but I prefer Mira, plus Mira’s gadget is better imo.
---
Nope. Hit reg hasn't been great this season though so...
---
Sleggie, hehe...
---
tried that, also in the meantime made a facebook for this single purpose.
---
Do you not drone? This seems like a you issue rather than Mira being some kind of God.
---
Solution make Jäger 0 armor 4 speed
---
what did he say?
---
I’ve dropped to copper one season and it was fun. Mind you I never did it after and only played one match because I felt terrible for doing it. There is just an allure to being able to stomp on opponents. You feel very cool, like when you were better then all your friends at a game. To be clear I in no way advocate doing this as it’s a scumbag move and I was a scumbag for doing it.
---
Clearly you haven’t seen the PS4 community
---
It is getting a massive rework for year 4 season 3
---
This is the best cosplay I've ever seen simply because it nails me feeling like im looking at a game screenshot. The lighting, colouring and effects are all top notch.
---
It is an advantage when you have a gun with good damage and normal recoil, but Ela has low damage and ridiculous recoil. I’ve had fights that I know I would’ve lost if it had been the same guy but with a higher damage gun abound a gun with normal recoil.

How can they tell the difference? What happens if someone's network goes down? Or to avoid plenty they disconnect from the network? You're talking about an issue that's existed in multi-player gaming for some time.
---
We need this
---
Would be a fun gamemode, honestly. All operators available for both sides.
---
Operation health be like...
---
Its hard to get anywhere without a party
---
I’ve thought about this for a while, and I’m glad to see that many people agree that this would be a great change to the game.
---
no, best you can do is what i said or try nvidia's remove hud thing in the same place as the green screening but from what i've tried it's shit. not tried in siege
---
To make opening videos of course. Also since they buy everything most of these are duplicates so no point in opening them one by one.
---
I've never ever wore them but I want these
---
god the F2 looks awful with a red dot. haven’t played that situation in long
---
This is the best ELA cosplay I've seen! Nice work.
---
The most messed up thing about Mr. Bear was how well they motion captured him.  They did it so well it didn't even look like he belonged in the game with how smooth his animations were.  It has become clear to me that they put more effort into the motion capturing on him than they did on any of the other character models.  
---
Which makes sense since he's likely the most important character in the game.
---
I never wait more than 1.5 mins for ranked

Hello Clorplax, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bdkynn/has_anyone_else_encountered_a_terrible_glitch_on/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That garbage belongs in common
---
It's an issue that was brought up in beta. Even by myself. It was an issue brought up when the game went live. It was an issue that was brought up after they started putting me OPs in the game.
---
Years later.... Still an issue brought up.
---
The servers for queue suck. You aren't in a queue. You have to leave and rejoin and hope you are in a real queue again. After a few mins if still no game, repeat until you do find a game.
---
There's a difference between a user input resulting in a disconnect and a packet loss/connection severance at the provider level
---
I bet he is now an easter egg in kids bedroom somewhere.
---
Alibi is the best operator to buy if you want to win. Get clash if you love memes and just having a fun time with friends. Lion is getting a massive nerf so dont get him anytime soon. Gridlock is not that fun an operator to play, being honest. She is so slow and shes so big that it seems like I'm being shot by people I never saw because I'm so thicc. Also, it takes so long to get into objective  and her gadget is useless. Its destroyed easily, hard to hear when it's being destroyed unless you're lurking by it, and does very little damage to the defender.
---
help
---
Ash and rook.
---
I agree whit you mr bear was perfect
---
Very true
---
If you destroy the radio before hopping up there, this won’t happen.
---
Maybe lol but this is xb1
---
Hold on my comrade it'll be removed in &gt;1month
---
I could hear his scream
---
Well an ice shield would be stronger than his current shield
---
Which is why I said what if you unplug your network to be kicked from match.

mp5 used to be better before they nerfed it.. now you need to aim high chest to effectively get kills

What does he mean by that lol

Yeah, FBI shield recruit WAS a 2 speed, but they changed him to a 1 speed to match other shield characters.
---
does this include the Friendly Fire change they're trying out? Or is that still in the testing phase?
---
The sooner the better.. I get teamkilled in about 1 in every 3 matches I enter, then get kicked right after.
---
cav catches your roamer out then you get Yinged jackal tracked lion starts going off and ash busts in

it’s rule 9 genius. reading is hard isn’t it

Uh. They do this already don’t they?

This happened to me a lot on casual too.. they vote you out for anything.. even if you’re the last one standing and ace-ing while you take your time.. they just want to play again and die fast..
---
I switched to ranked last night and it’s very enjoyable. Players are male cooperative and team chat / voice becomes way more useful. Unfortunately I also discovered there is a lot ok kids on ranked that use the voice chat to fight each other for dumb stuff
---
Still I prefer ranked now
---
AuStRAiLia Is A GoVerNmEnT LiE yOu ShEeP
---
black ice has texture, its not completely flat, the new seasonal skins are all flat as if you just painted it on the actual gun
---
they could have made a really cool seasonal skin with that blue shark idea, but its just a sort of cool blue paintjob with a shark on it
---
I was talking about "don’t be the 100000th person to post something and expect nothing to be said."  and "now get lost kid"
---
Any specific insight on what sound issues?
---
I also relooked at the older seasons delta wins and Frost seems to drastically jump around the chart every season. Like Y3S3 she was around 1.50% and then dropped to 0% the next season and now has sky rocketed to nearly 3.00%, So it’s hard to tell what’s exactly going on with her.
---
This is exactly what we need...
---
I agree, but with the more operators they add the more they force certain picks as counters for the more powerful operators. And the 5 man toxic stack works well for fragging and objectives that do not require hard breaching. With little counters to these operators (like, maybe mute and jaeger?) it makes it much harder. And with that certain Meta that you outlined, that still is going to have some operators shine to the top, thus making their counters shine. And when that is realized, that is all you will see in casual and competitive; rather then free roam picks.
---
Can't
---
I don't think we should be encouraging shields at all
---
I don’t see the issue

So that's VarsityGaming he's saving up to do a 500 pack opening stream/video.

just a wall of lead, suppressing fire at its maximum. make the defenders shit their pant at the mere thought of re peeking that angle
---
Yeah shield ADS is dumb as hell, crouch walking you can't hear until they are 1 foot next to you, and sounds sucks so much ass that top and bottom are the same thing.
---
On Xbox if I quit the que and then rejoin I typically get in in about 30 sec
---
Honestly, we might need to make this guy have an overheat feature after a 5 second burst
---
As a monty main I’d love this
---
Just because I don't specifically know how they DDOS, it has been confirmed and multiple DDoser's have been banned by UBI staff. Please stop acting like you have any sort of clue until you have played against the same people with same names saying they are crashing the server and then they do. Go ask people like MacieJay, KingGeorge, Joystick-Empire, and many other pros and they will tell you the same thing kid.
---
Thought I’d love to have it back, considering his win delta I don’t really think he needs it lol
---
Thank god
---
Frost just doesn't get picked at high levels, all the data is really hollow.
---
Yes?
---
Honestly if you live past the first flash you've either killed blitz or youre in silver
---
I haven’t seen any as well as it shouldn’t be a problem for the user to have to fix in the first place smh
---
Lol xd it isn’t

It'll come along with the removal of vote to kick in casual

I sometimes do this with buck and jackal it's so fun lol

They Ddos the servers, not players. No easy way of knowing player IP since they no longer user P2P. I'm in college working towards my masters in computer science. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. Or "kid" you're probably a greasy 17 year old who ditched class to bitch on reddit
---
A character who can't be tk'ed
---
I am aware, and now that I think about it, that was worded incorrectly. He called me a kid because he got mad that he knew I was right and that i wouldn't back away from my point, and he called me a kid because it gives him +700000 cool points to the 2 others reading the argument
---
Early June I’d say. We should be getting the next season announced on May 18-19 at the Pro League finals in Milan, Italy. Then a week before that we should be getting teasers of the next ops.
---
You know they are both attackers right
---
You’re argument is still wrong, it *IS* against the subreddit rules to post this
---
Thanks! I'm going to go into ranked next vid :)
---
Someone buff the recoil pattern to a more linear pattern. I've honestly started using the AA-12 in roaming
---
Ohhh thanks for specifying

Bro people rage quit cas too. Which is even more dumb cause in ranked you lose elo, but in casual theres no real negative side you get renown either way.

Candelas are effective in a lot of situations, but (IMO) the ability to kill soft walls and flash/concuss from a distance is more universal. Zofias guns are very good, her LMG being pretty underrated.

dude have u made sure u redownloaded the pass?

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Smg11: Y’all are both pussies
---
What happened to that breach charge
---
How you get that "*operator* main" tag?
---
I’ve said it in a post before I think we should be able to remap buttons so you could make the up on the d pad a toggle to let you lean without aiming instead of select fire because that is never really used so why not let it become a way to toggle leaning with no aim press up on the d pad to toggle on now when you press in L3 and R3 you lean but knifing and running would obviously get disabled to allow this and when you think you wanna run and knife again just press up on the d pad again to turn it off
---
No one forced you to play it

They were all born during the time of the Soviet Union, but they work for the Modern Russian Federation.

What IQ skin is that on the Aug?
---
This is why I am a Glaz main.
---
wanted the shield too, but got the helmet wich isnt so bad, now at least i  have all defenders attention, and my teammates can kill them while they go, wtf lol.
---
I use it over her other gun
---
Make it a defender op that is highlighted red from Lion in honor of the Lion Nerf R.I.P Lion
---
i though lesion didnt stack.
---
Oh they very much do, same concept, aim at one spot, throw your mines there. They’ll stack if you do it fast enough for them to land on each other’s hit box, but not too fast where they’ll just bounce all over the place.
---
black ice is still cleaner
---
So Fuze main goes to BO4 and starts using Battery's Cluster bombs
---
What a shot what rank was it?
---
No they don’t, they keep above your head for a good 10 seconds before they hit any shots. Trust me, I have at least 40 hours of T Hunt
---
Yea but it only works on quantum level. The smaller angle of direction of movement and you, the speed is more visible.

it was never gone. and you can't post peoples names here, this isn't ubisoft support
