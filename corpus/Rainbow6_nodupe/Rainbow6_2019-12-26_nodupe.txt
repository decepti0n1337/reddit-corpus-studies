I'm in silver.  She's never banned dude. You seem completely ignorant

That‚Äôs Monty alright

Those are called meh shots, meheybe next time

I never should have hurt you. Said those things...

U don't know harry?

Honey, I did mention that I'm low copper. Of course I'm ignorant, but it does not excuse you being rude

So is Mira

spelled merry wrong
---
Merry Christmas my friend! :)
---
Happy cake day btw
---
also need to know where you get one of these ‚Äúgf‚Äù please respond op
---
Omega
---
Hmmm is that the helmet, it looks a bit purple
---
It doesn‚Äôt. If you leave a drone onto a Prisma, preventing it from appearing, then you will be ping when prep phase ends, but passing through it alone will not ping you when the phase ends.
---
So basically their ability would be just placing down ladders at hatches that everyone in the game can use....?
---
I got clash but I can‚Äôt use her
---
Hm, I'll try it
---
And what about her guns, which one is better
---
Rainbow‚Äôs community has been so toxic to some of my female friends that play, surprised she‚Äôd put up with it
---
Chat said "outplayed" lmaoooo
---
I don't know how can you custom make a gf, but ok...
---
oh... you mean the shirt...
---
is that good or bad?
---
congrats and nice idea
---
Both guns are good it‚Äôs just if you prefer a lmg or ar and the shotgun is for just straight rush
---
Yeah she‚Äôs temporarily disabled tho so I am not able to play her
---
Awesome
---
Bad he is a very weak operator and doesn't bring your team much utility.
---
I only read Playboy for the articles on the back
---
Miami PD?
---
Of course you don‚Äôt, you play siege!
---
I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs just in cod you respawn and the fight goes on but in rainbow there are only 5 enemies per round so the kills have more ‚Äúworth‚Äù.
---
Lol Kali and Wamai are year 4 operators so yes you get them, basically from this season pass you get the other season pass benefits, also Mozzie, Gridlock, N√∏kk, Warden, Amaru, Goyo, Kali and Wamai.
---
Yeah you have a point but the players do get very toxic if you do something they dont like
---
he is photographer
---
Ask Santa pls :3
---
Mira‚Äôs elite skin
---
Honestly the SMG-12 depending on your recoil control might be wonky, so the C75. SMG-12 isn‚Äôt as good as it was before, but it‚Äôs a decent secondary.
---
fiRST wE aTTAcK hIs HEART!!
---
Maybe, even with most playtime in casual i have to say i see toxicity every 4th or 5th round or so and I find this ok
---
Someone's gonna steal this and repost it since you didn't put a watermark
---
He is photographer
---
Oh any soft breach will cause it. Happened in a PL game and forced a quick rotate into a cross fire, didn‚Äôt end well for the attackers.
---
Oh, yeah no Warden is still completely and totally doodoo, and only useful for a smoke plant, which people hardly ever even try anymore.
---
Ah yes I love when my ping is totally stable all day and then one single game it skyrockets and I lag out only to get an abandon penalty and then not have the problem again all night lmao
---
ok that i can live with
---
I actually have a shirt like this but with just Fuze -&gt; Hostage

What has this have to do with r6 wrong sub buddy

Replace recruit with valk and you got the ultimate consulate lobby hold
---
The fuck is that other team setup? That seems like a horrible combination of operators
---
Nice! I have Cav and Vigil!
---
Echo is a good one, drawback is that he gets banned a LOT though in ranked and unranked.
---
Where do you get that? Or is it custom made? I want it! :D
---
Wasn't it dansomewoja's?
---
Yea. I think it's mostly a case of (a) bad apple(s) ruining the whole stack.
---
I don‚Äôt have a torso. Can‚Äôt relate
---
The perfect ace it is!!!
---
I enjoyed the mode, but getting booted from every other game after losing a 1v3 wasn't worth playing it
---

This is ranked?

My my, you seemed to have gotten a nice Christmas present!

That is the best shirt ever

I main clash and it is so annoying that she is disabled
---
Smooth.
---
My first match was not on the great side toxic af but here I am now 620 hours of siege :)
---
Did anyone else not get a holiday pack to unlock an operator? I don‚Äôt have one :/
---
Lol, can relate
---
Something doesn't add up. Is there a version of the game with multiple languages or not? Did you buy the wrong edition, misunderstand what your friends said, or is Ubi targeting you specifically?
---
400lb Ned Flanders
---
I see, you're a man of culture as well.

I miss the game mode, not the map. The map felt like a worse call of duty map with no respawns.

Thanks! This helped a lot.

Thanks for your help!

Hahahha, btw you could've trimmed the video.

Well something isn‚Äôt working as I should

how far can she squirt?
---
Oh my godddds cry a fucking river cunt
---
This has been happening to me to
---
TheRussianBadger would be proud
---
Unranked doesn't use ranked MMR it uses it own MMR, so it is working as it should
---
There is only one version in store. Of each edition I mean - one standard, one ultimate etc. Both my friend and I bought standard editions, but he did it recently and he have multiple languages and I already had an older version of the game on my account. And for some reason, when I bought it again they sold me the same version and not the new one.
---
Maybe I'm wrong somehow. I wrote to support and waiting for their response. My bet - it's some uplay bullshit that makes the first version you bought your only one. I don't think that was their intention tho. Just a bug or something
---
Did you server hop, that's probably why
---
I wish you all the luck I can give because if I can hit it today so can you!
---
If you feel frustrated check out siege school on YouTube by varsity. Great tips to learn the game.

Oh I just got the point the behind this comment

Yeah, maybe I should've done the same, but why is it a problem in a first place? That's what frustrates me the most

What‚Äôs your GPU? And you‚Äôd better post some pictures to show your pc so people can see your cooling system setups.
---
HMU on Reddit chat. I can't play rn perse but can give a lot of information. And on a personal chat, I can ask questions more so you don't drink through a fire hydrant. There is much to learn young Padawan. Also I'll be able to get online when my new build is complete.
---
Good luck!
---
i am talking about people who have no rank
---
Here‚Äôs four ways to win: 
---
Don‚Äôt be toxic.
---
Don‚Äôt teamkill, unless you have to.
---
And make sure to have FUN!!
---
But most important of them all, is to respect our Lord Tachanka
---
I actually have a laptop, don't wanna open it up and break that factory seal until it's necessary. My GPU is a GeForce RTX 2060 and my CPU is an Intel 9th Gen i7.
---
Sounds great
---
Yessir
---
The fuck you just say
---
Sick flick!
---
lowering your settings can help. you could upgrade your cooling system as well.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Does it run hot for anything else? whats the temp when your not running any games?
---
i pop the side of my case off in the summer(my cpu cooler aint great nor are my fans but i sit around 70 degrees)
---
Well, more like R3L3 the entire team (or other reassigned button for it)
---
Thx have good Christmas night
---
Damn, the floor must be badass at the game
---
and himself
---
Well, I'm pretty sure bullets are a good counter.
---
*Everytime Wamai reaches for his mag-nets he touches his ass*
---
Yup...
---
Do you really want this person to waste a day if their lives trying to get everything on that map
---
Thank you. I'm grateful for your advice!
---
And your team like: Fuck, not again! You killed the hostage!
---
Cause I do
---
Crack
---
Angled is great, it's more something you use once you get used to controlling recoil I suppose
---
It‚Äôs not bad, but it‚Äôs not great either. Bad ROF for an SMG, but minimal recoil makes it a headshot machine, but if I wanted a gun with minimal recoil I‚Äôd play Valk or Warden with the MPX because that gun‚Äôs ROF is better. The damage is fine, but ROF dictates a lot in this game and the AUG A3‚Äôs ROF is ass.
---
You meant to put Bosg with acog
---
I did, I also went from steam to Uplay and kept everything.
---
no problem! i hope you have some more fun thinking up creative ways to use this gadget :)
---
yes
---
Howd you so this?? Looks fantastic!
---
Everything transfers over
---
It's literally cheating
---
–ù–≥ —Å–æ–º–≥–∞—å–µ
---
Can't
---
The no mic 8-year-old immature squeaker with 3 others who think they are the best players in the game and it is never their fault when the round ends.
---
Those are always the people who will teamkill and vote-to-kick you.
---
Villains, possible, but they can't have that in PvP.
---
So it'll be more like fuze and ying- two people that completely oppose each other due to their respective methods. Basically, rainbow's ops won't agree with their methods or inclusion.
---
That's of course what I believe. Don't think rainbow would bring in...... terrorists! Besides, there's also a theory going around Ela was a part of Nighthaven, because her bio says that she was "in a PMC" before joining Rainbow.
---
Also, it's possible that Nighthaven funds rainbow.
---
I see Warden and I want to throw a downvote. But I'll give you an upvote this time.
---
He's... A Russian police officer?
---
I heard that you have to remove all your game info from steam and only play on uplay. Is this true? I got it from this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhuHR8q-yno&amp;t=80s
---
FPS mate, fps.
---
Anything above medium is burn unless you have liquid cooling and rtx and i7 latest.
---
Besides, you already know the effects of running on "higher than what your system can take". So, drop it. You can't cool it any further than you already do.
---
Also, try undervolting. Both gpu and CPU. Can help.

I‚Äôve actually just got a new pc, so I can basically smurf, but I don‚Äôt know the controls well enough for it to be effective. 
---
I‚Äôll write down how many Smurf‚Äôs in each game. 
---
In my last match I was against a 4 stack literally called: smurf.exe.84 for eg. They all had numbers after. They constantly tk‚Äôed the random
---
Nah you're right.
---
For cpu like 105¬∞ and after this temp it should drop frequency to get colder or ur laptop will just be off , it is actually same on pc but laptops got pretty bad cooling system bcuz u just can't fit everything in small laptop case , and this is main reason why i don't recommend anyone laptop other than pc , except some rare situations when ppl move from place to place and they can't move desctop with monitor and other stuff
---
Ofcourse u shd be proueüëå

Got Nokk
---
Varsitygaming  is also a great one he has an entire playlist called siege School that has helped a lot. 
---
I personally watch varsity and coconut  and I have a very good time knowing stuff
---
Don't forget watch a little bit of macie Jay Macie
---
 throws the box away and starts with a brand new idea lol the shit he comes up with is insane
---
Yeah, hard to see a ping from across the map. You would have to be a confident player, it could just be rook/doc in obj
---
Can i have your dad?
---
It has over 50 mil players? Damn
---
That's a whole nother problem of siege don't even get me started. every other competitive game you can't 4stack but Ubisoft is too fucking brain-dead remove it out of siege
---
Man ur gonna be way behind, drop shotting is gone(you stop adsing while moving to a prone position). Ranked has pretty balanced maps, house no longer a problem being only in casual. Acog is removed from ash j√§ger and bandit. (G36c on ash still has it). Did i miss anything big?
---
I've aced with every operator in the game now, except for clash. Even all the different types pf recruit.
---
I hear heresy also r/woooosh
---
Why would Microsoft give a different company ms game better servers then its own?
---
If that‚Äôs whoosh, your joke was ass lmao
---
Question: what age are you and your dad?
---
Nope, Sony licensed a m&amp;kb that works on R6. Time for people to let this go.
---
Or maybe you have small brian makes sense you being a j√§ger main and all
---
Nice! I've only ever aced once with sledge. (I've been playing for like two months). How long have you been playing to be able to be so good?!
---
Well...Minecraft realms are subscription based you gotta pay up each month. Whereas ubi you only pay once for the game and that‚Äôs it. Server use is free
---
Still isnt loading....
---
Its a whole new game
---
Most sights are hard to see unless your up close with a monitor, at least for me
---
That's what I was worried about (: seems they've added a lot in!
---
Facts
---
Mouse and keyboard
---
Figured I was very behind on everything (: very nice to hear drop shotting is gone, and there are less acogs!   
---
I remember the ranked House days which were a nightmare. Thanks for the heads up
---
As someone stuck at plat 2 because K&amp;M players, I think it's safe to say nobody's letting it go for a while.

Where is Ela?
---
It just happens. Sometimes you go on win streaks, other times you just take loss after loss.
---
It really is just console payers seeing something they don‚Äôt have and wanting it. I was that person for a long time, now I see how useless it really is
---
Getting a Shock Drone as Mozzie is over rated and not as useful as a regular drone.
---
Depends on the weapon, lots of weapons have too large of a spread to have the laser help with pretty much anything. If you are using 1x scopes it's almost always better not to hip fire.  Shotguns will usually have it as it makes them far more consistent as they always "spread."
---
Sexual assault good sir
---
I actually do the opposite, I have played the game for so long now I lack motivation so if I have any money I buy an elite skin for a character I dont play and keep playing until I get good enough with them to constantly pop off
---
It's fun to destroy exothermic charge and resulting in twitch tk xD
---
If you loudly announced "sorry m8 that was an accident, I didn't want to kill you" right after accidentally teamkilling, your chances of not getting reversed friendly fire significantly increase.
---
And how did you get the links? I would love to buy these pl Skins, but I Wasn't Sure bcuz maybe I bought them and its a glitch an I wouldnt get anything in Game...
---
That is certainly an interesting way to make sure you play a new op
---
There was a time where a teammate and I were entering the basement obj on Kanal in different doors. He shot me, and I (somehow) reflexively flicked a headshot. I got a message from him a minute later saying "I'm sorry, I got scared." I sent a reply saying "don't worry, I did too ‚úåÔ∏è"
---
Best interaction I've had in R6 to date
---
Honestly it‚Äôs all personal preference. I used to use the 5.7 only but switched, and than switched back, and again. I use the 1911 just for the damage output now
---
But it‚Äôs never common and when you play Ranked or even high Casual the drone is dead before you get the chance
---
Dont use the suppressor on IQ tho, just in case you get caught with your pants down while using the R.E.D and need to defend yourself.
---
I know a program that lets you draw your own crosshair on screen. It's always there though, whether aiming or not, but it works.
---
I got Wamai, I actually wanted to get him someday.
---
I love what youve done with the place
---
Nah..
---
Any universal skin we can buy with r6 credit?
---
I think it's just showing that they had a shady past, the fact that there was a complete cutscene for it is a little sus

I can tell who you play on defense and attack

something that is respectable

Kali‚Äôs gadget is more useful but you really get punished if you don‚Äôt hit your shots
---
No u
---
Yep seems like a good idea
---
I've been reading about this happening recently.
---
sorry about the bias, but i am a red crow man, and as such, i will have to say echo. the drone is super useful when ur trying to give ur teammates an edge.
---
If you want a good defender, start out with Rook. Aside from having a good gun (MP5), Rook's sole purpose is to put down a package with armor. You really can't mess that up and the gadget is handy. A good starter attacker is Sledge. He has a sledgehammer to break through walls and amazing guns (L85A2 and SMG-11). Enjoy Siege and welcome to the club!
---
Booster. I just did a week booster and hit 112 k in the week .
---
üëçüèª
---
I have solo queued a lot last season and not once did this happen. It may have been cause by the unranked people but regardless it‚Äôs just unfair tbh.
---
I am thinking the same...
---
Agreed, I‚Äôve been that silver player who gets trashed by a random play that joins from solo, it‚Äôs not nice
---
Congrats, I really don‚Äôt know how people struggles to get plat sometimes,m.
---
I'm still using echo with shotgun silenced in hopes it's a hidden gem tactic
---
Thnx
---
Silver is the most popular rank and the afternoon is the most popular time so it‚Äôs best to try then. If you have an open NAT and everything is working fine on your network then I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I would only expect those wait times in ‚Äúoff-peak‚Äù hours.
---
Tachanka Clause
---
Any videos of someone going from unranked to champ or diamond after 10 games?
---
You clearly don't farm, if you do repetatdly in less than a minute you don't get renown.
---
Always been like that for at least a year
---
Bruh did you even tried Favela I have spent hours farming on it for that Halloween packs.
---
when someone shoots your drone in general
---
[removed]
---
Whateven man, you still don't understand that less than a minute you get 0 renown regarless of map. You always have to wait til 1 minute.
---
Ugly imo
---
Lol
---
They should honestly give her mp5k with acog
---
i had the queue time around 12 mins 2 pm sunday so...
---
my wifi works perfectly fine 15ping
---
welp the last time i played was the season before the 2 new operators out, amaru and goyo.  
---
cuz the long queue time so i quit. 
---
if the queue time is short in the current season then everything is fine.
---
best dad award

Finally. The whole enemy team.
---
How many is that in bananas?
---
I'll give that a solid 5/7

When somebody says their gunskill has been bad i completely understand but for 2 seasons?????? If I ever miss on a opponent I see, I instantly go play t hunt to tryhard my aim and so should you

Very cool, cool cool cool.

Only thing I want for Glaz is 4x-8x zoom.
---
It‚Äôs pretty accurate that I think about that every time I got killed by someone who don‚Äôt uses an acog but I do have it equipped lmao
---
I'm now 21, my dad is 41.
---
I play at Y:50 X:85-100 ADS:25 DZ:5
---
(X depends on daily performance)
---
I would try to increase your X and slighty decrease ADS. Thats how it worked for me.
---
I started at Y:40 X:60 ADS:60 and then changed week after week
---
ubi saw ur rank so they decided to give you that skin
---
Gunplay that isn't shit. Each round plays out properly instead of wasting time bloating matches out stomping on a team with pistols. Grenades actually follow some form of rational use instead of finding what pixel to aim at to quarterback a smoke grenade into a spot.
---
Ik
---
Well if your like me and started during the first year the game got boring really quick but as they added new events and more ops to use it got mor fun again btw started during black ice
---
Didn‚Äôt you answer your own question in the post?
---
That's why I haven't touched casual since Unranked is out. You can't be kicked there.
---
Glaz v Kali 'Enemy at the Gates' pls
---
Is is a laptop or desktop? Did you build it yourself? Are you using a stock cooler? What CPU are you using ?
---
Man, this is so awesome!
---
I mean, like few operations back, you could see through smoke and have highlighted enemies no matter how much you were moving.
---
Huh? The wall you were next to is breakable
---
Yeah but I believe when they nerfed that they made it so they dont glow at all when he doesnt have charge, now they do
---
Almost like that outbreak event, really wish they would bring it back one day :/
---
Yeah I played in like skull rain or red crow then stopped playing a few months later
---
A good tip: play around one part of the map everytime you play it. That way you will learn it fast, and then move to other parts of the map
---
No problem
---
Haha meme fuze hostage lord tachanka thik iq

If is possiblr tell me too pls
---
Lol that's one way to put it.
---
Sady though, auto industry is down, and I'm still a trainee. Get paid literal peanuts.
---
Have to hope that the industry picks up so there are opening next year.
---
Nope
---
I'm in the U.S. it's currently 7am which granted is early but I play at normal hours also and sometimes it's still the same thing. And my wifi isn't garbage
---
Im talking about the rate of fire (rof) just so no one gets confused
---
You own the game on uplay, not (really) on steam.
---
It's the same with assassins creed games on steam or basically every other game from ubisoft.
---
The real ownership happens on uplay steam is just a front"
---
Run while you still can
---
Try a noose
---
You don‚Äôt. MnK on console is cheating and will get you banned.

Mo you silly child no no no
---
A great beginner tip: MAIN TACHANKA AND AMARU
---
Top tier attacker and defenders
---
What's the point of this post then?
---
What mode are you playin? Try stick to quick play as newcomer and unranked aren't very populated
---
Don't use it. It's basically cheating and unfair for your enemy's
---
F
---
Same here
---
Hm I changed from newcomer recently because it wasn't really challenging, I'll try quick play though i was just messing around on unranked
---
The easiest fix this game needs is a duck operator and Diddy Kong with his twin pistols. Without these additions Ubsioft is only scratching the surface of greatness
---
The real question is...could they be used as coasters?
---
50 million copies sold on all platforms.
---
Looks like your on the Naughty List
---
Yes. With each new season the operators that were released that season in the previous years all get reduced in price. So next season is Y5S1. So the operators that came out Y1S1, Y2S1, Y3S1, and Y4S1 will all be reduced in price

Extremely cool imo. For those who don't know, [Mokume-Gane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokume-gane) is a Japanese-method metal made by folding together precious metals in a similar way to how you fold together different types of steel to make Damascus steel.

Okay, what the heck guys, nearly 1k upvotes, #1 on the subreddit, AND a gold??

I love you all &lt;3

are u on pc or mobile?

Was your ping high? This happend two times in a row to me and my ping was above 200 before it happend.
---
I don‚Äôt..get it?
---
1st of all it's named a drone. 2nd of all this means that mozzie controls after he used the pest launcher on it
---
Long live the Russians üòêüî´
---
Yes
---
I play on ps4
---
:(
---
My video folder with 9 blitz aces says no
---
well they did it was just extremely small and underpowered so they buffed him again to get him closer to what he used to be but further from tachanka in the lower left corner of the win delta
---
 One time was 193 and the other was 500
---
Thank you. Bless your day.
---
Why would you date a flick
---
Class A noobs or no Jaeger
---
1st of all bot is a term, that can be used same way, 2nd of all, you can see BB's icon above it and there were no mozzie in this round (even if you cant see it on this screenshot)
---
cuz it's different on pc duh, for mobile, you have to tap your name from your comment in this subreddit, and "choose Flair" right from there

Dont resset just reque.

For some reason, I can hear you screaming PLAYING CARPENTER ON THAT WALL.

It‚Äôs soo I can get used to MnK before going to PC
---
Usually on ops I have played/am playing a lot of so it isn't a complete waste of money. Never buying the casual clothed ones like Bandit, Capitao, and Ela.
---
Ah shit I'm idiotüòÑ
---
Fuze is such a good op, I don't know why he doesn't see more playtime
---
Getting all operators then UBI gives you 2 CHRISTMAS packs which is guaranteed to contain the full set. Keep in mind that once you have opened the christmas pack you can‚Äôt get this skin anymore. Yep a 1 time thing. Gehdvdsjs

You think I need the yellow thing to kill you? I don‚Äôt.

Glaz after his rate of fire is increased: 
---
I AM GOD
---
I can't help but agree, her base scope without the double zoom is just a tad bit above the acog zoom. You don't go into close quarters with that either.  
---
If anything, the fact the sniper is a bolt-action is more of a hindrance than the zoom. I'll tend to at least try to fire one shot in closer firefights before switching to the CZ if it's close enough.  
---
The CZ wrecks shit with no issues.

Did this to all the original maps a couple years ago, cept Bartlett U (only cause my game hard crashed twice trying it). I really should upload the videos one day.
---
She's a monster 102kg.. even withmy kit on, body armour and rifle, I don't weight that
---
The old problem with ping was fixed but the current one can be seen in the kill cams. You know when you watch how you died and the enemy is shooting behind you but they are still hitting you. That is because for them they are hitting you and the server sees it this way which normally is very minuscule but if you have pings if 100 - 200 you are still at an slight advantage if you move more than your enemies and know how to abuse it. Most people with high pings however don't play that style so only a few are actually at an advantage. But as I found out the wall is breakable which is surprising considering I have 3000 hours on the game.
---
thank you
---
Oh yeah it‚Äôs definitely worth starting. Player base is pretty big so you‚Äôd have no problem starting any finding matches and getting practice
---
Does the wireless feature make any difference while gaming ?
---
I KNOW
---
I haven't seen plats in casual, a few golds here and there but most common is unranked then copper or bronze with a fair number of silvers.
---
thank you for the advice!
---
Why not have a "skill/gadget" selector instead of overall operator, so your op could be used in different roles. Since that's basically what it is anyway. Just instead of a set single character it could be a user's.
---
Yeah, it's a small change but idk, I think it'd work.
---
The game is M for a mature
---
I‚Äôve been on the right side of so many aces that there‚Äôs nothing special about them anymore.  They‚Äôre cool when they happen, but it shows discord in both teams that needs to be addressed.
---
How dare you stand where he stood
---
R6's playerbase has only continued to grow in the last 4 years, now reaching 50 million unique accounts. And Ubisoft plans to continue supporting the game with new content for at least a few more years. So it is still a good time to start.
---
You guys are idiots, they're gonna be looking for soldiers!

Sometime between now and the start of year 5.

Yep, this exact same meme will be repeated every single year, with the text changed, as long as Siege exists. It wasn't true the first time it was posted, and it ain't true now. Heck this year includes 'a grappling hook to be able to climb up through hatches' which is a low tech and basic gadget people were asking for from super early on, and 'more shields, but with a gas tank attached'. But sure, they are less realistic than hand portable super EMPs, a super drone that shoots concussion blasts.
---
Bro you're MVP tho,the most money I spent on a gift was a lot less then what all those 60 euro + games cost
---
I really REALLY wish they‚Äôd give me an option to just disable player and weapon skins for my own view. I find them all incredibly distracting.
---
I‚Äôm happy that other people can find a ton of enjoyment in them, but it‚Äôs just not for me.
---
Learn the maps, memorize each room then build strategies based off that.
---
I feel like most smurfs are in plat+ elo.
---
Thank you
---
Literally the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard on this sub. The game works BECAUSE of the casted roles each op plays- that‚Äôs why recruit is such a meme. It‚Äôs what sets apart rb6 from cod and battlefield etc. Seriously dude what‚Äôs your reasoning for this?
---
It would have been a great concept, but I think it would have hurth the competetive side of the game. There would have been always that one op gun and op gadged. The game would loose so much of variability and balancing. Now, you can choose what you like. You want good gadged? Ok, but you get weaker gun. You want to be strong in gunfight? Ok, here is your assault rifle, but you will be slower, etc.
---
This is something that would have worked in a game with a totally different mechanisms. I can imagine it even in CQB game, but at this point the rainbow has come too far.
---
Wamai should go to gulag
---
you're a no brain ash main. This shouldn't take too much brain power to get the joke lol.
---
Yeah
---
Those lines are literally a direct steal from *The Infinite Sea* by Rick Yancey who also wrote *The 5th Wave* for reference. Kinda cringe when people don‚Äôt get their credit.
---
It is already hard enough with the plethora of uniforms. 
---
With that said operators can‚Äôt look similar to others and need to be unique so ‚Äúnatural &amp; real looks‚Äù aren‚Äôt preferable to maintain competitiveness and EASE.
---
I mean, most likely a combination of a misunderstanding and bandwagoning.  
---
When you say close quarters I really _think_ close quarters. And in CQ I have never used my acog in that way (Full-scope style anyways, holding it close the whole time etc), rather used it like a quick scope or even hipfire.  
---
If you use an ACOG and have [firefights at this range](https://i.imgur.com/Kug17ym.gif) then the acog itself is detrimental to it. And of course a _bolt action rifle_ at this range would suck lmao.
---
  
---
Kali is such a blast to use though, love using her on Border + Valley starter. You can hit all the way through to the lockers site and get someone downed.  
---
On top of the plethora of random downs I got by breaking barricades into sites.
---
I've got Pro League Monty though...
---
New ops except for mb 3-4 of them look ridiculous. Like Mozzie,Gridlock,Kali,Maverick,Ela etc. Don't get me wrong they all look cool and all,but we still need to remember that they're from spec ops. I hope Ubi will add more ops like N√∏kk and Maestro in future (they look like soldiers and they sure look amazing)
---
That's my personal point
---
Odd. All I hear is "YEET YEET YEET YEET"
---
The website is on the piece of paper with the code. If you're going to the right one, it's entirely possible that the website might be down. Try again in an hour or so and see if it has the same issue
---
They pull metal walls out of their pockets, FFS.
---
emp granades are way more realistic than a grappling hook launcher thing
---
Oh it‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs difficult. It‚Äôs more of he‚Äôs a pain. He‚Äôs considered toxic lol
---
Thanks!!!
---
I have and he‚Äôs still very strong. If you roam his gadget is still annoying to play against and he still has a great gun, secondary shotty, and smokes. He is definitely still deserving of a ban.
---
because it's most likely something wrong on the users end, not saying ubisoft is in the right or else it wouldn't crash, but probably some driver that's not updated or something like that
---
sorta like the long load time that people with some harddrives have, and isn't solved until you install the game on a SSD, or I think even defrag your harddrive, super dumb.
---
because when I alt tab to watch youtube or something during ban phase my cpu starts to die
---
Lmao this. He is bad af. He has the same gun as valk or smoke and mute all of them are much better not situational and actually useful to your team. His gadget is useful in 5%-10% of the rounds where as valk is allways useful smoke is too and mute is too. Warden is not good and if you use the argument he has an smg as a secondary smoke and mute do too. Valk has juan as a secondary which is very good for her as you can open high softwalls tops to throw the camd in the holes you make with the high cal shot where as the smg on warden couldnt do that. Dont use him in ranked only if you dont ban blitz and you encounter a team of blitz glaz and and ying mains in 1 team, in that case use him 100%
---
how would you do that
---
I‚Äôve had that before on house but he didn‚Äôt notice so I just spawn peeked him every round till he did
---
vc needs to exist as a means for removing cheaters and annoying players, and i wouldn't agree on rff being permanently on, an people would troll too hard, running into your spray just to get you killed, it would become another weapon for trolls
---
Of course üòä he's still annoying to play against
---
You need to have all of the operators unlocked so Ubi gives u this because you‚Äôve got all of the DLC ops :) hope this helps
---
Really? Ah damn, then i have no option to have time to get it. Sucks.
---
More like 6.7 out of 10 tbh
---
If you‚Äôre squadded then why are you getting kicked by your own team
---
shift tab and use steams web browser, works fine
---
Yea I realized that but was too late to plant by the time I used my brain
---
Can i get it instantly if i buy the year 4 pass? Im pretty sure it wont right?
---
Gotcha, I feel like worse comes to worse the maps just wont be played. Another benefit would be that it shows which map is good and they can use that info to improve or make better maps in the future.
---
team joined half way through and we won
---
RootinTootinPutin
---
This isn't like cs, you can plant at 0:00.01 and it will extend the round until the bomb is planted
---
Who let Mozzie fight in a dirtbike helmet?
---
it's also bs
---
No unfortunately not, as Ubi has already released these packs, but I could be wrong, but you need every single DLC op not just year 4 ones my dude :)
---
that's why I'm a casual rn
---
Well playing aginst him 2 matches for 2 matches is not giving him a chance... Twitch has one of the best guns, extremly good gadget you dont want her to be your enemy, why dont you ban her?
---
Oh Fr? Wish I knew that lmao. Thanks
---
Let's ask ubi to  allow us to customize the secondary gadgets, like turning barbed wire into bundles of Christmas lights
---
BUT YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED IT SO FAR HOW CAN YA TELL?
---
thing is this was in casual.
---
I'm unranked and I'm just guessing that Ubi is like "oh let's just throw all of the unranked people together in one queue!"
---
This wasn‚Äôt you was it??
---
I don't completely approve what you doing but I can understand, same thing happens to me quite often, the worst is that we are in casual, CASUAL.
---
[It's only a game.](https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A)
---
Or you just shotgun out the first layer of floor and place it in there so there's floor above it; Kali's explosive won't have line of sight, it won't be visible from beneath because the second layer is in tact, and the Twitch drone can't aim down far enough to actually shoot it from above.
---
Congratulations my lord
---
Ill try to de frag thanks
---
Black ice is fucken raw my guy
---
I like what u did wth twitch and mozzie
---
Maybe your shot registered before the animation was done and it acted like a hip fire?
---
Doc is dancing to the song at 1:01-1:03
---
Lol for sure
---
Its not my opinion, that‚Äôs a fact. Apple juice is better than orange juice, is an opinion.
---
That‚Äôs your fault for voluntarily playing casual
---
I do understand your point. My main complaint is the artistic direction of the game and how great is the gap between the release ops and the rest of the game, not the actual gameplay.
---
 I realize that this is a videogame, with juiced up devices and over the top genius-level operators from around the worls, but there is a huge difference between a british guy using a jet black vest, a gas mask and his unit preferred weapon, and a polish woman wearing yoga pants and with her hair dyed emerald green. 
---
For example, as a spanish player, the spanish ops looked very wrong since they got released. Jackal displays a very weird mix of actual spanish police GEO equipment, but with the green colors of the "Civil Guard", the other big spanish law enforcement agency that he does not belong to, like they mixed by mistake those two units. Mira uses a stupid pizza delivery boy Vespa helmet, with american football face paint and some weird Robocop body armour.
---
I think Pulse look's especially silly because of the lack of any other headgear. At least Castle has a helmet on, and Ash has a hat, but Pulse is just this big bald head with some speed dealer sunglasses on.
---
Is Monty dumb..? He could literally just walk right up to you and then unextend and melee you.
---
Still probably a better feeling than getting teamkilled.

Give tachanka a big belt fed mag to avoid reloading. Poof! Easy buff

Delux gives you done beginning ops,

Keep Casual casual and bring back all the maps. I don't get trying to make Casual feel more like ranked play when there is an "unranked" playlist that is literally exactly like ranked but without ranks.  
---
I only play Casual because I don't much care to be hardcore competitive, and I just want to enjoy all the game has to offer without being hamstrung by ranked rules.
---
Yeah i know im asking for the most optimal for visibility and such, fps isnt a huge problem
---
Standard edition starts you off with only a few base operators I believe. Deluxe edition gives you all the starting ops. 100% worth the extra 2$

Exactly. I dont understand why they would remove content

Pick another op then?

Deluxe Edition unlocks all Year 1 DLC operators, Standard Edition you only have Recruit and must unlock everything through renown.

I did it once on old Kanal. I droned out the staircase near the exterior garage and saw someone. So I tried rushing. Thinking they were maybe running, I shot once through the connector hallway and hit him, one tapped, in the head. Id have thought I was cheating if I was him. Sometimes the darndest things happen.
---
Maybe look at your ram
---
can he be part of delta force
---
How about don't worry about which op I pick? If nobody is gonna pick him why does it matter how I play him. If you can get kills and help your team it Shouldn't matter how you play an op.

You're welcome. If you have any questions, check out siege academy

---
Satisfying ü•∞
---
I beg to differ
---
Best tactic for favela is to defend the obj from anywhere that isn't the obj.
---
I wouldn't mind a back and forth between seasons, like one season new weapons, then the next season some rehashes. Maybe even have one like the last one where one operator gets a new weapon and the other operator gets reused weapons.
---
*Git gud*

There's legit nudes of the person cav was based on. Look up Brazilian cop leaked nudes.
---
I was gonna say terrorists aren't protected under the Geneva convention, but then I realized this would be used against other operators in this situation. To be fair everything that happens in siege is just a training exercise anyway.

Why you all focusing on that shit tho? Leave homie alone.  Respect boyyyyy
---
Having a tantrum about people having a tantrum.
---
Ironic.
---
Oh yeah totally, I would be fine with no new weapons or only 1 set per year, I like having weapons I'm familiar with on new ops but we all know learning how to use a new gun is pretty fun too.

---
Well, thats illegal
---
Need this NOW!
---
There isn't really an option like that, but the closest one is setting shadows to medium. Then it displays player shadows so maybe you can spot them before you even see them, but it also makes the game darker and I found that I often didn't see enemies in dark places. 
---
I've been running Very High textures for as long as I can remember and I've never felt like they gave me a disatvantage. And even if I set them to Low I'd only get a boost of 10 FPS at max. 
---
I set reflections to the lowest setting because it just gives me less clutter to look at.
---
Ambient Occlusion to Off because it makes the game have way more shadows so it makes everything darker. No thanks.
---
Shading Low because Medium is the same and High takes away too much frames at the expense of making no difference.
---
Lens effects to Off but it's just preference as I was running with Bloom because it was looking nice and it gave me no disatvantage.
---
Zoom-in DoF is just preference.
---
I've set AA to Off because TAA just blurs everything FXAA doesn't make a difference and rest are ok but they just ruin your performance and are bugged.
---
Also you can disable Motion Blur in GameSettings.ini (located in Documents\My Games\Rainbow Six - Siege\\*random letters and numbers*) by changing MotionBlur=1 to MotionBlur=0.
---
Wait, that's illegal

He is special kind of slav: *black slav*

Also if you play on NA servers, would you be down to play some rounds?

¬£1.78
---
Sure!
---
Half the subreddit: satisfying
---
Other half: THIS IS ILEGAL üòÇ
---
Did you find any other ones like zofia or Blackbeard?
---
thanks mate!
---
Read the title.
---
Now I remember some talk from Ubi about reducing damage to the head through surface. Hope this will happen one day. I really hate the kind of situations like you experienced...
---
I‚Äôll pm you my username, I‚Äôm away for the holidays but should be home in a day or two
---
Normally I would say deluxe, but withthat deal definitely gold.
---
My Gametag is: Stylo. If you ever want to play. I honestly am really rusty since I haven‚Äôt played in a while but it‚Äôll be a nice way to get back into the game again. I don‚Äôt talk to much people except like 3 others who would be more than welcome to meet you. We all are pretty rusty at siege. Let me know if you want to play sometime :)
---
Why'd you have to shoot the coke like that, what a waste
---
I wish. I found the maverick ones last month and the lion ones just a few days ago. If i could find Zofias or Lesions ill flip lol. Im always on the hunt to find them though. If you find any others lemme know as ill do with you!
---
I would play with you but I‚Äôm on pc sadly,hopefully you find someone to play with and if you ever decide to get a pc send me a msg.
---
When I play Glaz I tend to open soft walls by shooting the wall in intervals in different spots, so the bullets don‚Äôt go through the original bullet hole. When a huge X goes across the screen all of a sudden I tend to stop for a second to fully understand what transpired.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Yep mate very unfortunate because the distance between me and the blackbeard was insane.
---
I know this is not related to the sub or this post but I feel it is extremely important that I share this with you. If any of you care for the truth of what is really going on in this world please watch this video:

Best value is easily the Ultimate Edition right now. You can get it from legit 3rd party sites like Gamersgate right now for 34 USD.
---
It depends on if you like Siege but if you do it saves so much time from having to grind to unlock operators and allows you to spend that renown for other items if you want.
---
Am i the only one that loves the photo? Lol
---
Nah too late. I just watched him tk a teammate in order to lose the ranked game and all of his platinum teammates lost the game with him as a result of this dumbass policy. Good shit rainbow
---
Damn I always thought it was painted on. Never mind then haha!
---
Honestly, i didnt feel ready for ranked until lvl 100 at 300 hours but maybe around lvl 80 and 100 hours is more appropiate
---
Yeah I saw this on Marley‚Äôs video as well
---
He could easily make a Smurf and play with you like that, it's not the greatest way but it'll still be better than throwing and being toxic. I do kind of agree with the whole mmr thing but it's kinda the o lt way to make things fair.
---
So hmmm normally ya queue time is 5 mins plus? Im on pc as well.
---
Dont over think it.
---
Pick a setting you general like and learn it.
---
üëÄ
---
That's just ruining the game for other people dude, would it not be a simpler solution to make an alt?
---
Already watched him derank himself and all of his platinum teammates in a ranked game as a result of this dumbass policy. This is what the game has come too smh
---
Hello SypZGods, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eg1kqm/this_video_will_make_you_love_rainbow_six_siege/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I mean if you feel like you‚Äôve improved a lot then sure. But the average player is high silver - low gold range.
---
Agreed
---
If you played so little rank does not matter imo
---
You missed the hostage
---
Ohhh how did. he get 2 packs
---
He has 2 alts and their both plat. Hey man I wasn‚Äôt the one that told him to throw a game he did it himself cus he doesn‚Äôt want to make another alt
---
We need to make our voices heard i feel like this can be reversed
---
Hah I can't do glaz vs Kali I main both &gt;:D
---
The lord shows his miracles again
---
I thought so too but apparently most players are actually bronze
---
You don't learn anything against smurfs that only rush / spawnpeek either
---
Do you use laser on rifle for shotgun?
---
I‚Äôve actually never had an ace before, so I‚Äôm not the average player. I‚Äôm worse
---
Pro gamer. Nice work OP.
---
He's throwing on his main? Jeez. I can't help you if he's too lazy to make another alt to play with his friends, I've said my piece and I hope you get to play some ranked with him soon I guess.
---
yes please! a long with the elite animation
---
Whats your level (100,200,300), do you play on PC?
---
Ah ahhhhh my knee that's my knee whyyyyy
---
Go and play another game for a few days, I usually do that and come back fresh.
---
(No joke but Minecraft is a good change of pace from the tiltedness of R6)
---
Do you think you could send me the print files?
---
Yeah you‚Äôd be surprise how many people care more about playing with their friends than their fucking rank lmao
---
Moving his mouse
---
But then the randoms at 3000 elo will have to play with the two worse players and the other team could have 5 3000 elo players amd that is not fair.
---
Yes you do. You actually learn more because thats how people actually play the game.
---
Took a season as well so dw
---
I was copper for nearly the whole y4 now I'm much better
---
I agree with you that its incompetence to a level but I just think its healthier to have something underpowered that's more niche get buffed to a better level than being stuck with monstrosities for a whole season. But not every operator can be released in the state of gridlock and mozzie and it's more a lesser of two evils situation more often than not
---
Tru
---
Having an ace has nothing to do with it. There‚Äôs usually only 2 reasons for an ace. Pure luck or your skill level is way above the enemy team. Kills are not the most important part of this game. It‚Äôs all about team work, communication, intel and map knowledge. Work on those and you‚Äôll be at least silver or gold in no time.
---
PONK PONK PONK PONK
---
Well duh but isn't the whole point of an alt account so you can do stuff like playing with your friends? Seems counterintuitive to have multiple alts just to get them placed in the same ranks?
---
Yeah it doesn't have any place, in like 700h of casual I have only see the votekick use as intended 2 or 3 times at much.
---
Even one time there was a flyin hacker in our team we didn't managed to kick him lmao
---
Ngl with all these stims Cav looks like a heroin addict
---
Maestro: **Cocks meatball sub with malicious intent**
---
I‚Äôm lvl 86, been playing along time. not on pc.
---
They quit lmaooo
---
at this point you're better off looking at reviews on amazon, there is no headset that's gonna be that much better than another
---
another contender would probably be the m20x and m40x from audio technica
---
Herbal Tea by Artificial.Music
---
I link the soundcloud down in the description of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne2XwzS4FsQ)
---
Ahh, I'd focus on trying to help them learn the game and getting into it while having as much fun as possible. We have the same issue at the moment but we just play unranked and laugh with the new people on how they play but help them learn.
---
BURN IT.
---
Where can I buy one of those?
---
Lol imagine the just dumping a pile of Legos out of a bin. That animation alone
---
For the satisfaction
---
Oh boy, can't wait to to see more commons in packs.
---
Deluxe edition starts you with the season 1 operators already unlocked. There are 8, normally costing 10k renown each. When playing casual you usually get around 150 renown for a loss and 300+ for a win.
---
Standard has no operators unlocked to start with.
---
There are base game operators (Pathfinders) that cost 1k renown each which will probably be your first purchases with either pack, deluxe gives you a nice headstart though.
---
There are training missions called situations that will get you around 10k renown for completing them which helps grab some base game operators early on.
---
If I was buying the game today, I would get the deluxe edition.
---
No problem, it's a very cool comic
---
First time?
---
I mean the other 3 CTU's that don't exist are CBRN, GSUTR and APCA aren't real and when ubi don't wanna add a real life CTU they'll make up their own
---
Bartlet University. Well god damn.
---
Huh, guess we all are deep down not protected by the GC.
---
*Picks smoke*
---
You have done Mother Russia proud comrade
---
Rejoice, and come share this vodka with me
---
You have to use an emulator to trick the console into thinking it is a controller. It is cheating and Ubi has said as much.
---
I would pay for a Tachanka in an Addis tracksuit.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs cheating on console. You have to use an emulator to trick the console to think it is using a controller. Ubi has said it is cheating.
---
But they are present in form of operators, nighthaven is shown off bigger and it‚Äôs unrelated to rainbow story wise, that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs not good
---
What is perfect. I don‚Äôt see anything
---
Squeaky toy barbed wire. Just makes that shrill squeak when something is moving in the area.
---
Awww why do you have to wait so long?
---
Cuz I already opened my Christmas gift and I didn‚Äôt have all Operators yet
---
Well I think it only applies to actual war and civilians, not police activity, since that what a lot of counter terrorism counts as. But terrorists are "illegal combatants" so they're fucked pretty much
---
1 out 10
---
Ohhh I see, I don‚Äôt know if they do this every year though unfortunately, at least I don‚Äôt remember it last year
---
Imagine equpping it with christmass lights and other decorations
---
Oh dang it
---
I thought Ela is more thicc lol
---
The curiosity rover has better internet
---
That‚Äôs true. Who ever said you had to use the bright yellow part of the flip sight, or even the flip sight at all?
---
Because year 5 will have a story to it until 2021
---
Yeah, sorry :/ idk tho, this might be something they start doing :-)
---
He just looks like bandit.
---
Yeah I hope so
---
Thanks for the belated Christmas gift, OP! /s
---
Change your t hunt settings to only the maps in ranked (which you can see if you go r3 on ranked and explore that submenu) and play on t hunt classic. I also personally play bomb only to get more practise since that's the only mode in ranked.
---
oh god
---
Signal Jammer transition was orgasmic. Pardon my language.
---
Seriously though!!

Your comments are some of the most childish I‚Äôve seen
