Zofia makes bandit tricking literally impossible in a lot of places, since her stuns cancels the animation. 
---
Is your VSync turned off?

Wish Cav looked that cute. Her new face looks like a potato with paint on it.
---
Maybe.. One issue is that it might not have enough "levers" or whatever the siege dev called them. I can't remember if that's what they're called but basically they said Lion was a huge problem to balance because his ability is global and not enough little things (levers or whatever) they could alter to change him so basically he would either have to be overpowered or underpowered. For instance, they nerfed Ela's gadget by reducing the blast radius and giving her 3 instead of 4. This sounds like a global ability, which means they'd have a real hard time balancing it.

I try. I play Terrorist Hunt yet I step into Casual and fuck up more and more. I'm afraid to solo queue in Ranked anymore because of last season

I got this never use it though

Give this guy gold
---
Because it doesn't make money. Thus, Ubi won't do it.
---
Anyways despite having the choice between console or pc siege I'd pay for skins and get stuff on pc first as it's just the more better platform.
---
Understandable if you don't have a gaming pc though.
---
Honestly it feels like the players run the game more often than not. Yes, run. Like the devs just sit back and go "k".

Its a glitch with the new map

Im trying to spend 10 dollars from my steam wallet but when it tryes to connect to steam it errors and a msg apears saying that the shop in unviable.

I have tryed restarting the game, restarting the PC, flushing the dns, port fowarding, copying the ubisoft shop link in the steam overlay ([https://webshop-r6.ubi.com/en/enUS/shop/products/undefined](https://webshop-r6.ubi.com/en/enUS/shop/products/undefined)), changed the proxy settings, checked the Frimware and firewall and flushed the steam configuration.

Ubisoft isn't one guy. Their priorities vary per team. They're not gonna tell the artists to just sit back and do nothing while a level designer works on fixing a broken window.
---
Wait, there is another way?

My friend reached 100 alpha packs recently and did an opening for our squad over discord. He didn't get any legendaries and the only epic he got was the French fry charm. He was so pissed off that he left his setup for an hour and came back yelling.

Its not just toxicity really. I'm tired of being put down because of my rank and nobody is willing to work as a team. I get called sweaty or a bot most matches and being the last op is always putting me into a state of panic. When I lose a round, I either get vote kicked or team killed. Every time I play other games I feel relieved and in control. But Seige? I feel like I have to suck it up and be better than others.

Jäger's elite is pretty good imo.

I have notice this.

People shoot me before I peel before they even see me

It is a low hanging fruit joke made by somebody who is obviously fucking terrible at the game.

Every season in silver I get people yelling at me that as mute it's my job to "hide the bombs", then by the time I climb back to plat nobody gives a shit about any of it.

You're ruining their experience first. Knifing people isn't what rainbow is about, its not what they bought the game to do. Then again your flair is recruit main so you probably think its funny

There was an old post back where Vigil got like 200-300 points for spamming his ability the whole prep phase and jumped to mvp lol

We should have an Defending OP that can jump up through broken hatches. But be loud as fuck.

CaV would be So OP with that ability

My first thought when there is one operator not spotted is "they probably have a cav"

I went to school for 6 years and have my masters in Kinesiology. It's universally accepted by my peers that BMI has some factor in health. While it isn't always accurate, it's always a good place to start. Again, until you've studied it, don't think your sad little Google search will help you

Ooh bee soft is what it is "supposed" to be pronounced according to the pun. Ubi (pronounced ooh bee) means where in Latin, making Ubisoft translated to soft where, sounding like software

If you jump through the window by the vending machine you can apparently push the terrorist into it
---
Uhhhhh
---
Unironically saying cringe and bro in 2019.
---
Now this is epic
---
I think 1 speeds are gonna loose it on attack ,and like you said that's probably an option there looking at
---
But those 2 points are amazing 
---
I use bandit as a bootleg mute. Barbed wire + battery = safe room
---
Primarily on maps like house or skyscraper.
---
I think the correct phrasing is “That’s what she said”
---
I recommend fuze. Just got him myself and am not disappointed what so ever. 
---
There aren't any operators that 'are the best'. Just puck who you think has a cool gadget. Sledge is good for new people, Ash is basically COD. Mute is a great operator for new people as well because his gadget is still useful after death. Personally, I started with fuze, zofia, pulse and lesion
---
Hes pretty much only for high comp/pro level players.
---
Hes supposedly used to prevent drone-outs during attack phases, so the enemy doesn't know what angle your holding, but this rarely happens in actual games.
---
In most cases, they wont drone out and prefire the most common angles.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
Tachanka is a dead meme though. Also rules are rules, and if your post(s) go against said rules the post will be removed. Maybe you should consider “acting responsibly”

When someone did that to me and my party my cousin reported their team and with the report toxic behavior button and got a notification soon after that they had been banned

No problem, if you're on PS4 I can help you out tomorrow when I've got some spare time. If not, then I can't help much more

Nomad/gridlock are good counters to Cav. I main her, and the hardest part of using her is utilizing the map as fully as possible, being able to rotate or flank as quickly and quietly as possible is her biggest asset. She can be frustrating if the enemy knows how to use her.
---
Gridlock and Nomad have good countermeasures to prevent her sneaking up on people, but the hardest part about playing cav is when the enemies use the buddy system. She isnt always equipped to deal with multiple enemies the best (especially if they use callouts). Her pistol is strong but she cant miss much, her smg is slow firing and she'll usually lose a gunfight unless the cav player has great aim, and her shotty is only useful for close range, where she might as well use her Luison.
---
I agree way too many children. Whenever I am TK’d I assume it is an angsty highschooler or a literal child of 8-12 years old. I switched over to playing siege mostly because I was getting bored with battlefield, I have been playing that since the first games came out and there is little challenge with the new one, it is such low stakes and once you get into the groove you are top of the game because no one is playing hard to win. Siege was different for a bit, but now I just run into children that shoot me because I chose the operator they wanted or whatever. It gets old quick, I’m just trying to play a competitive game. What are you playing on? PC or console? It seems worse on console
---
I was on my other account and I got a 13 kill game
---
I usually activate it and deactivate it instantly to give me an indication that there’s a drone active nearby, and then have it ready for use during gunfights.
---
What the hell is this mess supposed to be?
---
How can a video game character for an FPS game that has no story other than a short bio for every character be inspiring.
---
All we wanted was for him to have the smg-11 but alright.
---
I prefer goo-be-soft tbh
---
With the reset change I would say that there should be. 
---
But it goes a decent way and through multiple floors so it doesn't always mean a drone is nearby
---
Who is the problem?
---
You can repell in from that wall due to a bug. 
---
I think they had a window there but decided to block it late into the map development but forgot to remove the ThisIsaWindow area of the wall. 
---
I see we have a vibe killer, why must you always ruin others fun? Looked through your recent comments and they’re all negative. Why you gotta be so toxic?
---
You're
---
I can help you on Xbox then. 
---
Ok, it’s fine.
---
I thought they were supposed to come out today too. Pretty sure season pass holders got them last Tuesday so they should be available now... but I keep checking and they’re still locked :/
---
 Ash doesn’t have a smaller hitbox than other 3 speeds, her guns are comparable to other 3 speed attackers guns ttk wise (and before you start screaming rof, hibana has a higher rate of fire and comparable recoil), and also ash has less utility than *most* operators on attack. Ash is not OP, you just need to start hitting your shots.
---
I dont think so, Blackbeard and Thermite skins got it correct
---
IQ 
---
Totally worth it
---
That’s my problem also as a more casual player, I don’t have maps memorized that well. I know some really well but only if I’m doing a soft or hard anchor. All roamers I’m kinda weak with except vigil lol,, that’s why I went so hard this thread about him. 
---
Like you said, the pistol is good but you can’t miss. I miss a lot lol
---
I hope this gets the attention it deserves. 
---
I don’t think calling people out on their bs is considered toxic
---
I know, but it still gives me the heads up to know an enemy is on the drone. It’s gotten me a good amount of kills, and I’m able to let other roamers know that someone is on their drone.
---
MFW a fanmade item is better than the official. 
---
Holy shit that's amazing. I have used Sledge a lot lately and need to try this. 
---
Listen man, don’t give them any ideas 😥
---
You shoot a kevlar vest with a shotgun vs a pistol a shotgun is gonna do more destructive power
---
You know, both of these pronunciation could also be considered incorrect . In French it's not pronounce either of these two ways.

It would’ve been better if they kept the charms and added the camos along with them

Fuze isn’t meant to soft counter for people on shields lol. Don’t use him 99% of the time, but when you do make sure it is a coordinated push with a Lion, Hardbreacher, Smokes on the plant etc. He’s meant for flushing out, quick pushes and bomb planting. If you’re on a camera I have no idea how you wouldn’t know Fuze was detonating charges above you and Jagers should be down anyway

I can already hear him crying about her being too strong. He made a bad play and got punished for it.

Yeah that’s what I’m worried about as well. 
---
Then he needs to go ahead and Papa Roach it up.
---
i say doke eye bee but thats just me 
---
3 periods are completely open to interpretation and do not by any means show as a 100% fact you’re conveying sarcasm. 
---
I would agree with a max amount of damage but the one flaw is what about resets as they have been nerfed 20 hp is better than 5
---
I agree with it, he’s a sniper, not a fragger.
---
You get them with the Pro League sets I believe.
---
I like how everyones go to solution to people being toxic is to “play with friends”. It makes sense but friends aren’t always going to be on the same time as you. 
---
U wana know what would be cool if they added the same concept as fuse but with flash bangs instead of bombs.
---
It has no recoil.  Throw an angled grip and a suppressor and go to town.

Yeah me and my friends were thinking of something similar but it was recruit who actually had the backpack/supply box.

That would explain it.. I was just so caught off guard lol

If by ping abuse you mean consistently lagging back after being shot to give the enemy a free kill, then its ping abuse

---
I am in Australia and since the start of the season I’ve been placed on Asian servers. However there was server maintenance last night and I haven’t had the problem since 
---
I believe the whole point is people who chose it use it only with echo and maestro camps or to pair up with Frost. Otherwise no one picks it. Also, attackers rarely destroy them and go for walls instead. Now, you'll want to use ash and Sofia breaches on those shields as it can hurt to not destroy them
---
They’d both be too strong/hard to balance. You could maybe balance the attacker. But I don’t see how how you could balance a defender that could directly counter both Ying/flashes and smoke plants.
---
Pick and ban would be awesome
---
nope &gt;:D
---
So I might be that the first two operators who got Bday skins have the yellow color theme but boy do I hate that color. Hopefully they reflect the icon color with all operators. 
---
It’s U B Soft

If it's electronic, Thatcher probably disabled it, IQ gets wallhacks on the defender when it's active ect.

I don’t see how it could be. You only get three per match, and you can’t commend the same person for more than one of the three things. At least in Overwatch

Why did you post evidence of your own toxicity? Sure he "shot you to 82" but you just continued the cycle yourself by shooting him back. It never ends well for anyone, you put your team at player deficit because you now have 2 HP and a dead team mate. Think about the rest of your team before you do dumb shit like this...
---
Have you seen Destiny 2’s competitive mode? You win/lose a set amount of elo regardless of enemy rank, equipment, or skill. R6 is perfect in comparison.
---
Imagine fuzing someone the floor above you, only to have one of the charges fall through whatever hole was made and landing on your face. Now that's the real nightmare. 
---
In Smite, you could commend everyone for any of the 3, so you could commend all 4 people for teamwork or guide if you wanted.
---
I really believe there are so many people that post stuff on this subreddit just so they can post something. I see so many clips of things that are so undeserving of a post.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

yikes, my school allows racism and complete nudity xD
---
It can't really be abused because of the fact that you cant repeatedly commend someone over and over, even if it's a random person you happened to play with earlier and got with them again.
---
Don’t worry once you do get in a game half your team will immediately lag out so just savor the long wait time 
---
Because those guns came out AFTER that skin was released. When you purchase it Ubisoft states exactly what guns you can equip it on
---
That echo never stood a chance.

Right, like using the ability is a giveaway anyways, what's the point of using it before the round starts?

Operation: GOD SAVE THE QUEEN

It can't really be abused, you can't commend the same person more than once every 2 hours and it takes 600 commendations to earn a chest.

I do, but not by choice. My friends are just used to be playing support for them.

So thicc he explodes

wednesday.

Oh you 😘 ❤️
---
But the R4-C does more damage and has a higher ROF, while the recoil is still very manageable.
---
Recoil control isn't super important in this game unless it's as strong as Buck's AR.
---
All of the above is 100% accurate
---
Yes, yes yes yes YES
---
Fuck dude, should’ve thought of that

Prepare for Tachankafall, pilot.

Hey Weeb learn how to to make comics in non-weeb plz thx

It's though choice between reinforcements and Spawnpeek most of the time tbh unless objective is right next to the spawnpeek point.
---
I've actually have good teammates tbh if I ask them "should I reinforce or go spa...." And they just say as long as you pull a successful SP, fuck reinforcements.
---
Yep its been happening to me as well since the start of the season. Holding tight angles/peeks is literally useless now. This needs to be looked at ASAP
---
To be fair, Clash also got nerfed heavily after release... 
---
I thought ops go through military training not a hot dog eating contest.
---
They won't change it. The cars are 2d as well, it's so that they have little to no impact on your performance. Everyone would be pissed if the new map made your frames drop because they had fully rendered 3d kangaroos in the distance

Fun fact: that gun in real life is actually a glock 18 with a short barreled rifle adapter. It's called the micro Roni.
---
Speaking of legendaries, I haven't seen any new ones this season, or I guess I should say I haven't seen the usual 15 gazillion Reddit threads about new ones.  I'm assuming there are new ones though?
---
Yep I posted this and had it as the top post of the sub for a long time. (Although still technically a repost cause I found it on another sub)
---
That was back when we had less than 70K subscribers and getting a post to even 1K upvotes was a crazy occurrence.
---
So I've been doing this for half an hour or so and decided to try out buck who I could never really handle because I love ACOGs but there is no way with him because of his recoil. It was a rocky start but I think I'm improving. Thanks for the pointer!
---
I think I just nutted
---
Where is Osu!? I found Aim Hero on steam and am not willing to spend money to improve my aim "I'm something of a cheapskate."
---
Have you tried getting good
---
"hope to include" doesn't necessarily mean "will include".
---
Oh, they meant tomato tamato, I thought that was how you say Ubisoft.
---
Its been ruining my fun with the tkers and griefers. I know the best thing is to really just leave the game and find a new match, But a good amount of matches involve tking. Sucks that new tk system didn't come with the start of this season.
---
True, defender acogs are made from pure Osmium weighing him down
---
He never said Ash was OP, everyone knows she isn't, but she's stronger for soloplay and is rewarded for it.  This post was literally just saying Zofia is a more balanced and arguably team-oriented version of Ash.

I’ve got them both too, back to back. I’d much rather have the banana, doge, or alpha pack charm for meme value. The devil and angel charms are hot garbage.
---
You'll need an extended mag then because the M45 was derived from the Colt M1911 and the original M1911 didnt have a dual-stack magazine meaning each bullet was right on top of one another taking up more space, also the bullets are wider taking up more room.
---
I can't do this shit anymore 
---
Oh man that’s so funny, hahaha.

Very fair

thanks for the support guys!!!!
---
Pretty sure it’s an imgur thing actually.
---
Vigil needs a buff, both of his secondaries have at least 1 major issue. The c75 auto has awful iron sights &amp; the smg-12 has the worst recoil in the game. His ability does almost nothing and he's not stealthy at all, especially for an operator who's whole purpose was to be stealthy.
---
Is this not intended? This is why pro players peek from like 20ft away from the door they're peeking and not right up ne t to it because you get a disadvantage. Step back sonny.

Good thing they've already announced they're reworking theme park specifically to unfuck the haunted area and basically remove the train yard.

Looks like Mozzie is suffering from that old bent-in-legs glitch.

But it has already been a week should I not be able to get them in the afternoon?

The G36C is a great gun. Its just not lazer-tag ridiculously good as the R4-C.
---
Yeah that’s what I thought too
---
 Thanks for the new info it will help me in the future
---
I can't beat the shit out of you without coming closer.
---
Fuck you for being a competent adult!
---
Should have made it like an Echo drone on Attack.  You get the drone in the room, set it on the ceiling, and you can set it off whenever you want but it only affects the people in that room.

The better I get at the game, the more I spawnpeek and the less I get spawnpeeked

Took me till year 3 to realize fuze doesn’t shoot his explosive pucks randomly and the third pellet goes straight from the center.

---
Be better at the game lul
---
This comment alone proves you're part of the problem. You or another player got team killed for no reason, fair enough that's toxic behaviour and there's no real way to deal with it yet. However you then proceed to shoot the offender who then shoots you back so you team kill him now. See how you're also part of the problem in this scenario?
---
If you get team killed for no reason;
---
1: press the report button, yeah I know it does nothing but it's there.
---
2: take the footage and send it to Ubi via the support site. Then the player can get banned for toxicity.
---
3: just leave the game since it was casual. You'll get replaced by another player and won't have to worry about that player. Pretty simple stuff my friend.
---
that's the original pose ubisoft needed to put out.
---
It’s funny because I started playing Rainbow Six 3 and Black Arrow on the original Xbox and the G36C was thee best gun for riflers.

You can make it look like someone else is typing if you type it a certain way in the chat box to where it hides there name and looks like you said something. I'm not 14 so I never took the time to figure out what exactly the magic context is. But enough spaces and what not and boom
---
It auto corrected I put wouldn't not want
---
i just have either shit luck with other shotguns but that was the longest kill i've ever gotten, i downed one guy who was at the end of the corridor on the basement area from where i entered which would be roughly like maybe 8 meters max, but then there was a guy at the end standing right at the other entrance that leads to the storage area of the plane and he was at least 15 m away and one shot downed him and it won the round. i may have got lucky though lol

---
It's not "so bad". It IS objectively worse than the R4C, but that's not saying much because the R4C is really good. The G36C is a fine gun, there was just no reason to pick it before when you could take the R4
---
Did you jjust ram yoer keybpard out of frustration, or are you seriously that bad at typing?

They switched rolls. Glaz became doc as defender and they did it with the other guy peaking.

Yeah

Well its clearly nit

I had the same problem with solo queuing without teammates. I play fairly regularly with 2 others around 5.30 - 9pm most weekdays. On holiday at the moment so won’t be playing again until Monday but feel free to add if you like.  Shev23

Dude I once got disconnected first round in a ranked match,them I went to search for a ranked game so I can reconnect and I joined a totally different match.

Attacking team: dude uses explosive drones.

That's nothing, I got a fucking dodge charm from a legendary pack

I'm getting about Golds consistently because most of the Plat ish players I'd ususlly fight are in ranked or not on or dont get them because of my squadmates. Im a 162 and the highest other squadmate who I know well and met IRL before we played Siege together is a 136.
---
nah not at all pal, you’ve got his gadget wrong. vigil isn’t supposed to be stealthy, he’s supposed to be a pest, and he is excellent at it. As a vigil you *want* attackers to know that you’re lurking about but at the same time not be able to pinpoint you because that’s how you die as a roamer. If you’re playing vigil 56m from site hidden under a window waiting for a late round flank, you’re playing him wrong. He’s a time waster. 
---
CZ is a good secondary at close range. Well balanced imo 
---
Sus 
---
Oh my... that's hot
---
How I play with Vigil is to check cams as soon as the attackers spawn to see which spawn a group has spawned at, then position myself close to a common entrance for that spawn, and just hold them up or kill them if they don't drone. His gadget isn't really something you can see have a visible effect, but it is really useful to protect yourself as a roamer.

Yea the map need #0

It is a good gun, it is not a god-tier as r4-c but it definitely is above average.

Its a known outback glitch, theres another one where you can sprint at one of the rooftops and drop in right around the Bull. Feelsbadman
---
I got like five on my xbox account but only one on my PC account😭😭

Thats fine though. The meta has been super aggressive attackers and roaming defenders for years now. These role reversals change the dynamic

Damnit, I'm playing on PS4. But, I'm going to buy a new PC in April sooo maybe we can meet someday. 😄
---
yeah I kinda agree, the problem is you’re basing this off of one game with these randies. Don’t get me wrong, I hate teammates just as much as the next guy, but one game isn’t representative of how they play- maybe it’s their worst map,maybe it was just a bad game etc; doesn’t always mean they shouldn’t play bomb. Definitely true for certain people though. 
---
Bandit tricking is irrelevant now imo, it’s trivial to counter.

Better than the tiny alpha pack charm, my dumbass tought i got another alpha pack from an alpha pack...

Isn't there something similar in League of Legends also?
---
I think this idea is great! It motivates to stay positive.
---
So I did, didn't notice. Figured since the body still disappeared that it didn't count.  Thanks for the heads up, I'll delete the post
---
Wait really?

 Well now you know what I'm going to do tonight

They can’t.

It literally mimics a controller input.

Unfortunately, that’s generally how things in life work out.

If they would just allow M&amp;K we could all just......use M&amp;K.....

New seasons (and almost all patches) are released around 1600-1700 CET (varying by platform). 
---
And also at least 1080 p resolution?
---
Yeah, sure it does.
---
You have to buy everything if you transfer to pc
---
Just realised its my cake day yay!
---
Its still in beta, will go out of beta next season
---
Do you think they’ll make it a thing?
---
Well, from what I’ve seen from Ubi’s footage, Lion still will be strong in competitive scene, but no so frustrating to play against
---
I guess if you don't care about just posting all the details here again and you are just lazily linking to deleted content then I doubt that you put much effort into making something that would work and thinking about how it would impact the game
---
I hope they fix that asap, I've already died so many times and i didn't see the enemy and he could
---
Do you have any reasons why you think it is a bad map? The only reason you gave is "I am horrible at this map."
---
If it's a matter of not knowing the map, you already have the tools at your disposal to play the map outside of ranked before you queue into ranked again.
---
That honestly looks sick though
---
i feel like Mozzie is good as is. Gridlock could use a damage reduction on the trax to 5 and or lose one canister.
---
Fixed for me
---
The fuck you calling him a Zealand bastard when the word kiwi exists ya damn dag.

I didn’t say they didn’t, but I was interested since I’ve never been in a game that toxic on pc ever. Tho I’ve never played lower then plat 3 really so.

Once its released you have to download the pass, not sure how it's done but I've seen a few of these posts and that seemed to be the repeated solution

Alright. I will try to look for those thank you

This is a very well known glitch. I’m very surprised you didn’t know about this.
---
You can rappel through that window 
---
Oh, alright thank you! Was I supposed to get the charm though?
---
What I learned in my mandatory military training is that the whole idea of clearing a room is to:   
---
When approaching an entry point (i.e. a door), you approach it from the sides and, as my instructor said, you're supposed to "slice" the room. So again imagine you're ash and you're at the side of a door to a room you want to clear, the barrel should be the only thing visible from the other side (if one is paying attention), you then slide into view while "slicing", the barrel and your sights will scan the room from left to right or vice versa until you are in full view of the room. This is why you do these maneuvers in teams, you can't cover a whole room by yourself, so multiple people doing the same thing on two different angles, one covering behind, and two behind the two point men or doing the same on another entry point (if you're on a five man team). I guess they tried to implement this logic into the game but it's hard to do the movement while aiming down sights, as for the hitbox, you should be able to at least have similar POV's, I remember a while ago how these killcams were completely fucked, as in you could be facing your opponent when he killed you but the killcam showed you looking to the side. Guess that's back.

The dog tags were better.. these skins are fungly

Can you explain what you mean by averages out the ranks? As in like it’s spread evenly?
---
I’m not sure but I think most of the players are high silver - gold players if that’s the answer you’re looking for. 
---
Next season we get that cool new chart to see for ourselves though 
---
I'm a bit new: what do you mean it is free?

To bad no
---
I just want to whack a fool with that thing. That's it. 
---
Frost 
---
Hahaha exactly
---
yeah I thought so. Ubi fixes one thing but breaks another :(
---
Most likely, it could be rectified though by giving shield ops more pistol clips or maybe altering their tactical and empty reload speeds.

---
I'm currently level 210 or so, my first legendary dropped when I was like level 160 I guess and from 160-190 I've received like 6-7 legendaries two of which were side by side, during this season had 4 epics in a row 3 of which were black ice and another one was duplicate headgear, never bought any alpha packs though. I guess alpha packs are just way too random rather than being rigged and it's all about if rng would be generous or not.
---
Same! Coming from PS4 at level 110 with many skins and charms from all the way back to velvet shell I am feeling a bit naked on PC right now..
---
It’s not a glitch, the enemy team is purposely ddos’ing Ubisoft servers so they don’t lose any elo. It’s been going on for a while now
---
But the whole point is that they are changing it to become more viable, it’s not a new skin for it that you should be able to change whenever you want.
---
why does OP get to decide what other people do for fun? Maybe Valkyrie's idea of fun was to try and headshot the enemy with the deagle on the wing of the plane. Why does OP get to decide that they aren't allowed to do that?
---
a week after release

---
Can Mozzie even reach the doorbell?
---
Just click on heads 
---
That’s a great idea coming from a person who personally hates people that use MnK but I don’t even think ubi would do anything like that but other games have used something to detect it and then they ban them.
---
No,  not really :p
---
First couple shots were off, but then nailed like 6 straight. WTF is this game, Ubi?
---
If you ddos a person personal wifi then that overloads phone lines as well so you can’t call 911 and in some cases it over loads the whole streets internet so nobody can call 911. Hard to explain but hopefully you get it. Yeah ddos the game server is no biggie 
---
Yeah, you only get Black Ice for guns you don’t use, like the German defenders SMGs (I also have it on the M870 but only on test server)
---
Someone may have not known about it
---
Nice got mine last March great skin

Well the other version is not free and you can only get it in outbreak’s packs but okay
---
I love how you used the M320 breaches to kill those last two bois

---
Thanks bro
---
You got so confused on how to deal with that fuze
---
0:56 
---
feels good :D
---
I play on Xbox so the recoil is really weird for me.
---
This is prob the most common spawn peak, so most players on here will already know about it as this map has been out for 3 years so there will be very little that players don't know about on this map. 
---
Yeah, thats what I was thinking on this at first, but whats going on with the kill cam at the end? Does that have anything to do with anything or is it just another kill cam bug? 
---
I feel you. I have it on the UMP and I don’t play pulse either. Can’t believe to imagine how mad you were when you got it the second time.
---
I'm sure they'll be out later, around the time when the update dropped
---
Not from a Jedi.
---
“SHIT!”
---
But headshots? I know thats the typical thing players say but wouldn’t you want to stay hidden as much as you can specially when they can die so quick
---
Gridlock is slow. Mozzie being a team player waits for her. 
---
INSTEAD OF A FECKIN' CHARM, WHAT ABOUT AN NORN' IRISH OPERATOR...
---
#SquadGoals
---
Yeah I like it too, it looks really cool. 
---
You can still hold down the angles on the plant and it’s not like you’re crippling him when he moves. 
---
Now glaz just has a regular DMR when he’s entering/fragging and gets a little buff when he’s doing what he’s intended to be doing like holding long hallways and covering the defuser. 
---
I only do it to help my team out. I give callouts and only shoot if someone’s in front of me directly. 
---
On xbox I like to switch between her burst and full auto to help with the recoil the only hard part is learning and remembering to switch back and forth
---
As a Ela shotgun main I approve.
---
I see the runout from skylight and the door more often
---
and girl.

What if it was black viper?

But what if he then takes a selfie with the hostage?

*laughs in no damage from buckshot*
---
Takes two headshots to kill him but it feels like 25
---
It’s an unbalanced map but it’s easy to learn and mess around on and that’s why it’s so damn fun to play and they won’t change it 
---
giving it a laser provides more range, so does an extended barrel
---
Yea that what i mean
---
Stop playing Ash and play an actual operator.
---
jealous
---
Do you own the diamond skin?
---
No
---
Fidget spinner bitch
---
I think that would actually be a buff then
---
Then let's make it a V10 engine /s
---
It reduces damage drop off, but that isn’t what a laser does. A laser tightens spread. An extended barrel doesn’t. They do completely different things
---
Tower is the least fun map to play 
---
It's been really tough for myself to get back into the game cause of all the toxicity especially when I solo queue 
---
This is the way it should be to be honest.
---
#Ah, bummer.

Why would they have taken them out then? They didn’t do it to change them or anything... I don’t understand assuming they’re lying whenever you see an explanation that doesn’t make sense to you
---
Check the "community options" and click on the "user flair preview" and then put on a flair.
---
Thank you kindly! I do indeed have a Twitter, which is also Vyndist just like my Reddit. Appreciate the interest!
---
I don't even know the meta I just play ops I like. 
---
Looks horrible not gonna lie. Also why do you think it's a good idea to upload the picture as small as this?
---
25 vert, 75 hori, ADS 42, deadzones: R5,  L6
---
Haha! Now I kind of want to draw them in that style, that's amazing!
---
I mean I couldn’t write a AAA game but I understand how code is written and how this kinda stuff thinks. The hologram behaves very differently than a player model, and is likely hardcoded with the default model. Changing that behavior would cause a lot more loading and logic to make sure shit doesn’t glitch. I don’t think the code is written poorly, but it engine wasn’t designed with this functionality 4 years ago and changing it is too much. 
---
siege can be very toxic to newer players so don’t let people say anything about you, just keep on going forward and progressing, great job!🤩
---
Use a VPN that changes your region maybe?
---
Happy cake day
---
This is just the [R6 stats website](https://game-rainbow6.ubi.com/en-us/home) from Ubisoft
---
I mean, ubi designed the entire engine and game so technically everything that ever happens relating to it is their fault...
---
So now that we’ve determined that, is it okay that they’ve told us there’s some limits on the way they can design alibi holos? I say yes. Just tell us and move on to the next bug
---
Because if you’re wearing camo city people can’t see you
---
How did you make this?
---
I thought you were talking about clash’s and just said the wrong name, my bad, I misunderstood what you were saying when you said clash’s should have more
---
Epic gamer Moment am I right 
---
they honestly fucked everything up. especially hit reg. i tried one tapping a blitz while he was ADSing but the siege denied me access and they let him shoot before me, and I was fucking doc bro 
---
Because at the time EVERYONE and their mama complained about the maps and how they were unbalanced to all hell. They also claimed they were going to bring them back eventually. But reworked. And that again was a fucking lie lol. 
---
I &lt;3 Traps
---
In the very early versions it actually made duplicates
---
Yes, the Lion's Drone ?
---
Bruh moment
---
The commando has a few less bullets and worse recoil than the K1A and Mozzie doesn't have a fully automatic secondary like Vigil has.
---
The Roni has 11 less rounds less than the Storm and the "superior" part of the unique sight is purely subjective not objective.
---
His gadget relies entirely on getting drones, if he doesn't get any he doesn't help the team with his gadget and he's only one that can control them when he does. Valk on the other hand helps the team as soon as she tosses the cameras out(provided they are in a good spot) and everyone can use them.
---

---
you got fucking beamed bro XD 
---
Clash. C4. Bandit tricking. Sometimes you get the raw end. But a team of 3 and 2 vs a team of 5 that play together nightly, chances are low. I personally never have a problem with any character except jackal 
---
copy paste
---

---
source?
---
Tbf out of the dlc operators I’d say their unit is most likely to return, as I can see them doing a second outbreak. They’ve got all the assets for it so it would be a waste.
---
I think something that needs to be addressed more is the fact that more people are playing this game like it's a TDM.
---
Are you on xbox, PS4 or PC? 
---
És um jogador do caralho Miguel
---
This has been happening to all the shields, they attempted to fix their client side stuff but broke the he'll out of them in a bad way, me and my friend think that they messed up the attatchment points and it flops about.
---
You're the problem
---
I need a good defender elite skin. I have Thatcher and Blitz rn.
---
Need a good Smoke or Caveira skin.
---
That is also kinda annoying when I'm the only one playing obj and the rest of my team is going for frags ranked has suvked this season I went from a gold 1 to copper 2 more people are spamming blitz and lion in copper and that's annoying I had high Hope's for this season 
---
Looks pretty comunishy
---
But muh GPU is already at 75% storage on High settings 
---
I came looking for this post when i saw someone in the comments in this one ^^^
---
But at that time their solution was to split the ranked playlist away from the casual playlist which seemed to be a good solution for the playerbase. 
---
They also did start reworking maps, but obviously that’s a slow process and it would be very dumb of them to start with yacht or favelas instead of the ones they did (clubhouse, Hereford, consulate, etc)
---
My only gripe is when people say Ubisoft is lying. We should give them the benefit of the doubt given how well they’ve managers the game so far. Plans change and communication isn’t always perfect, but I believe they’re usually making an honest effort to fix/improve the game and communicate it as much as is feasible
---
I'm confused, is this a post of a picture of Finka's icon and the person just changed the color from yellow to red and it's got 2.8k upvotes?  I'm so lost lol
---
Yeah, but *look at the upvotes counter*
---
Not only are you banned  
---
But your IP is banned  
---
And your going to hell
---
Boo
---
What
---
Really? Unexpected?
---
I wish I could upvote this more☹️
---
Its the thought that counts
---
Same bro
---
Ash doesn’t count
---
It shouldn’t, you should have them installed from the Y4 update
---
I could be wrong on this
---
Mission failed you'll get em next time
---
Quite not what I was expecting, but I'll take it
---
droning life :( i drone when attack and drone when defend.
---
I feel so old saying it but the language is horrible. A 12 yr old me would have kicked the shit out of him if he spoke like that to me. He was even toxic to his 'friends'. Worst bit is its pricks like him who will be running the country one day (kinda)
---
Wow its red now great content
---
Probably deranking
---
Zofia has withstand. She can pick herself up. I'm surprised she didn't.
---
What does sexual preference have to do with moderating?
---
Is it though?
---
i guess i just forgot the context here.
---
I do hope that it stays alive for at least a couple of more years. I want to cross it off of my just made up bucket list for playing it on higher settings, 1080p and 60 fps for at least a while lol
---
Not even reading your post and I’m telling you yes. I switched and will never touch the potato version again
---
I don’t care what people say that’s pretty good
---
The panic C4 though...
---
What difference would it make?
---
Blow my unit
---
Seriously, the model in this game and payday 2 are some of the best looking gun models in any game.
---
Ahhh I see now. Why de rank? I struggle every season to get past silver as I play with randoms
---
Give him a little credit it could be a bronze or low silver play
---
Well I’ve upgraded it now with 16gb ram and 1660TI graphics card. I think I’ll be alright £43.81 a month for 3 years...
---
Game still has this problem tho. I run into it about every other game. It still applies. I’d appreciate it if you would confirm it too actually. Thanks!
---
I hope reaching plat by the end of the year
---
How do you get those charms and for which ops?
---
If Jackal was enlisted as GIGR (he was born on an exclave surrounded by Morocco)
---
You delete your account
---
In a way or another even Bomb is a frag fest as diffuser down means defenders need to kill everyone anyway most times to secure defusal. It's hard to say what Secure can change without becoming something that isn't Secure at all.
---
If you put time the keyboard will be easy just do bunch of thunts

This or his in the down but not out state

I've seen about 2000 of these posts. 
---
The horse is paste at this point. No need to keep swinging wild into the muck.
---
NOICE
---
Try the looking for group posts that Xbox hosts I always find good teams there
---
happened in most of my placement matches so i got mid bronze and only stopped when i hit gold
---
No, but why not just duplicate the object and spawn the second version if the user is equipping the elite skin and then spawn the first one if the user isn't? Further, it should be like gmod where you can a wrap different texture. If they designed it properly then it would've been like that
---
If you want to see my decent stats my nickname is YelloSup on PC
---
Haha great now I just need money which is a lot harder thsn you'd expect
---
Fair points. It just doesn't seem like the community is very vocal about these issues.
---
She trained with kapkan right?
---
This needs the Mortal Kombat Theme in the background lol.
---
Maverick hole at the bottom.  Person who set claymore didn’t move away quick enough.
---
Already plat2 but thanks!
---
I play siege on both PS4 and PC and I much prefer PC - definitely worth it with everything else a PC can do on top of siege alone
---
Pc is much better and you will have more precision 
---
Plus its so useful having a good pc and everything looks better
---
If you need help on choosing pieces you can dm me and ill help you choose parts for budget
---
Official statement by the devs is that the system was temporarily disable while they look for a fix.
---
Those affected shall also see their MMR get returned minus the actual rollback value (which is much smaller).
---
It’s more competitive for sure, but you will definitely be placed much lower than you are now for a long time specially if it’s your first pc fps
---
Nice mate nice
---
So they can play super bad players. Troll coppers maybe even copper boosting.
---
Hello frostyfeet007, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b0osts/so_this_keeps_happening_after_the_new_update/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Sucks man, that was my only win this week and it didnt feel like a win at all
---
I’ll get the f version and then I’ll see if I can afford the 500gb SSD and I can somehow pm you the new parts
---
Nah
---
I agree it's not a high level strat but my point stands regardless of the level of skill required for the play. It's just poor design that they can't even do it in the first place.
---
Better
---
That's a Twitch Prime charm, currently Bandit, Ela, Hibana and Finka have them.
---
Tip-You should use vertical grip for better recoil control and also stay calm when shooting.
---
Isen’t that feature only in ranked still?
---
alright, I will write down both names in the screenshots on a post-it, stick it to my screen and if I see either of them, I'll...  
---
...do what, exactly?
---
Very nice
---
Blurry phone screen shot
---
Check
---
They're objectively not identical.
---
1. Zofia has less speed.
---
2. Zofia has different guns.
---
3. Zofia has different secondary gadgets.
---
4. Zofia has different primary gadgets.
---
5. Zofia has different weapons.
---
They both see use at high levels.  Look at her pickrate in pro-league.  Look at her pickrate in Road to S.I.
---
You say they're the same operators with different kits, when kits are literally *what defines operators as different.*
---
truth is the game was rigged from the start
---
I remember getting that achievement it was a while ago that school map still existed
---
I'm pretty sure this was ranked (I took this ss a few days ago) this isn't the first time it's happened to me.
---
He is speaking the lagnuage of the gods!
---
You don’t necessarily have to push faster. Just attack smarter. Don’t hold a skylight angle for most of the map. If your actively gaining map control and killing roamer your doing fine. If you see pro games it’s very common for there to be no push until the last minute
---
Ho damn, just re-read your post again.  The way the TL;DR reads it looks like you are saying the opposite of what your post is saying.  I misinterpreted the whole post.  That makes sense now since the details in your post confused me when read with the TL;DR.
---
Apologies!
---
yellow? Do u mean legendary?
---
True
---
Every year they redo all the graphics that really matter so it will look just as good
---
They need an option in ranked to show where the bomb is if you discover it during the round. I'd love a closer view of the map and the ability to mark points of interest that your whole team can see. Plan out the attack before the round starts.
---
Are you on PC or Console? I am an experienced Siege Vet. Been playing since Beta. I can try to help ya out if you want. I can DM you my discord. and show you some things that might accelerate your learning curve
---
The way they deploy is different but their use and function is the almost the same
---
How to copper
---
fILtHy cOnSoLe pEaSaNt
---
Jk have fun hope you rank up
---
Maybe you should try this with other operators (other than Lion) they look cool
---
Marvel Defenders
---
This is pretty cool, now I wanna see this done for lion and the grim sky ops
---
UNITED FOREVER IN FRIENDSHIP AND LABOR
---
It reminds me of the blackbeard bundle
---
I’m aware they are very different I was trying to make a joke, but it was pretty stupid but I hit send sooo
---
What was the soldier 76 thing?
---
Yeah I know that’s what I said
---
Her DMR is probably my favourite in the game, surprisingly strong.
---
Anchors are really pivotal to a team, but normally roamers get all the action, but imo if you want to play a anchor I think Intel based ops (maestro, echo, and mozzie maybe valk) are the best, so you don't have to get action to help, rather than holding one angle the entire game and not really doing anything
---
Smonk's skull looks dead inside
---
They’re both area denial ops
---
Indeed
---
It can’t be that hard they made a super fast paced intense game that’s over 65 gigabytes they really can’t make a loop work?
---
On PC there is an ultra HD texture pack, which looks good still, they could probably easily pull some textures from that use in a console version if they had to.
---
I don't mind the bland colours if they are there for a reason like my ubiquitous skin for Ying's lmg, its mainly dark green but made to look like the pulse rifle from aliens. 
---
Then it's contrasted with my Mac daddy skin for the deagle which is the most pimpinest skin ever 🤣
---
YEAH I KNOW THATS WHAT I SAID
---
make the lion as gign
---
That is so wierd
---
When did you say that?
---
Most likely is I live in northern VA and we are known as the data capital of the world and I constantly get 1 ping
---
Since the recoil got wrecked, I rather use the semi-auto pistol
---
I always think this...these are the future leaders for god sakes.
---
What does it matter I agreed with you I know the functions of the operators I never said you were wrong
---
As someone who’s only played controller how long did it take for you to become comfortable with mouse and keyboard
---
my current is 400dpi, 10, 10, 83
---
also played with 1000dpi and 5, 5, 5
---
Alt by default
---
Nahh I think it’s just another jojo reference
---
Alright mate sorry for upsetting you
---
All my friends play TH, amazing to play with if I need to get a new OP, but if I wanna play ranked I'm outta luck
---
What if I’m on console
---
IM NOT UPSET YOU ARE
---
All good
---
At least it’s for a good gun meanwhile I get it for the shitty Russian pistol that isn’t the Makarov 
---
Hmmm don’t think you can but idk. Maybe someone else can help you
---
What screenshot please
---
Not nice
---
You're crouched...
---
Oh lol
---
Everybody knows the one
---
:D
---
That doesn't look like an issue on Ubisoft's part.
---
YEAH THATS RIGHT
---
Move the joystick halfway
---
That was bold.
---
Good job my doodly.
---
YEAH THAT IS RIGHT
---
so capitao is used for stopping the defenders flank?
---
Bad you peek spawn
---
Just like the bandit main to try to bring down the toxicity, yet get nothing in return, to you people, thank you :) to the smoke, your just a jackass
---
Nice.
---
Why don't people often include the post-round replay for these kinds of clips?
---
It's more of the thing you want to see with an angle that allows you to laugh at the enemy being blown through the air. 
---
Looks more like fish of prey
---
Saw another post about this and while I sympathize, I'm happy i didn't buy a Vega 56 like I was going to 
---
But Capitaos isn't a trap... 
---
In some situations, yes. As I said on another comment they are both area denial operators.
---
You can rappel into a window that's sealed off by metal in one of the bathrooms between bomb sites.
---
Was JUST about to comment this
---
r/UnexpectedSCP 
---
I don't 
---
Honestly though it’s only a matter of time before they run out of ideas. Look at bandit and kaid. I think they should add a sound operator. At least gridlock is as bad as bandit and kaid
---
Capitao and Gridlock are similar area denial operators.
---
If you are clearer roamed you are fine, I’m not so referencing that I see way too many people doing like what you said of holding skylight and effectively doing nothing for most of the round.
---
In Year 4, the camera for leaning for changed to the center of the head, so in situations where you are holding an angle close to an object, your head will be visible to an enemy when you can't see them. This is an intended change and a consequence of the full lean spam fix.
---
Okay
---
God you're dense
---
That’s what this whole convo is about, people were saying rainbow has dlc
---
I member ... Now its keep toggleing as Vigil to get infinite points
---
Agreed, I think legendary skins should have something special going for them and this one does not 
---
"Visible Confusion"
---
No that’s ducking fat. 
---
There isn't a special server they play on. Macie lives in New York so he plays on mostly US East or sometimes EU because he's close enough. Someone YouTubers and streamers live on the west coast so they play US West. No one in their right mind would play on a server that isn't closest to where they live.
---
👍 
---
I was thinking the same thing. I don't get it either
---
Ubisoft just broke the game like always
---
Looks better
---
Yeah that’s very true I was just about to bring up Kaid and Bandit 
---
Hey! I also bought the game  during Lunar New Year, I'm level 74 and haven't touched ranked, I started getting 1-4 kills in my 30s (I play multiple fps so my aim was ok but my game sense was trash now I get like at least 3 a game which isn't much but I'm proud. Point is, I'm glad your getting better!
---
100% one of the hidden ones is Caveira
---
Not much more expensive. Buy used. Build with a 1050 or 1050ti if it fits your budget. G4560 (check if it has 4 threads 2 threads doesn't work in siege) and just cheap rest of the stuff since those are low power and you can't of the pentium
---
Finka. Fista. I see the resemblance. 
---
Agreed this is lame, you have to know the name just to understand what the hell it's supposed to be. 
---
However outbreak was generally poorly received because it was fun for about a couple hours, but there was to little content to justify replacing a map. I can however see it being released and working on it as a spin off
---
Hello EJaws, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b0pko9/discovery_outback_matchmaking_broke/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That's like saying Ela, Lesion, Kapkan and Frost are all the same cause they're trap operators... Or Ash and Zofia are the same. Or Maverick, Thermite and Hibana are all the same.
---
&gt;and still no toxicity managemen t
---
O_o
---
That is a fair deduction as well 
---
Nomad was original and fresh, but when I tried kaid I was like do a shitty bandit?
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Well if you don't adapt to the meta how are you going to be successful? 
---
Nomad for me is hard to use, I can't use her ability/tool to its full potential. But gridlock I can use her, and her wepons are better. 
---
I wouldn't mind if they make at least one more. 
---
I've seen some clutch ass tight plays with nomad.
---
That’s not the same but whatever you think mate
---
I lost my season pass. What is it?
---
iniciando\*
---
Frost mean you can be elsewhere and achieve the same result though. Obviously they can shoot it as they rappel in or through the drone hole with a frag/breach round, but she's certainly good there for this exact reason. Hell there's even a window right there you can put one on that's pretty good too
---
Honestly i feel like your sensitivity is fine but i would try turning your deadzone up
---
in a very few situations, but mostly not, because it's only for a few seconds
---
They don't play on a specific one regardless of what you have saw elsewhere,
---
They play on whatever server gives them the lowest ping, sometimes they'll change server to play with friends but that's just dependant on who they are playing with.
---
Autocorrect. 
---
Don't r/foundmobileuser me 
---
Obviously that's opinion, but a community of 35 million players+ has more resources than any one organization just a numbers thing.
---
Because he's not there to fuck spiders
---
:(
---
God it's so funny to do this. Every time they get super mad like "what a dumb frost trap" then leave the game lmao
---
Holy fuck 
---
I mean at this point of my career having unlocked less than half of the cosmetics and getting alpha pack duplicate every time (not kidding) I'd be glad to get a common skin for Tachanka... but yay some people actually get legendaries &lt;/3
---
Did the screen shaking have anything to do with it?
---
Both of them are good for covering defuser on the bomb game mode 
---
Stop talking about it
---
You don’t talk about fight club
---
agreed (he also acts like the hostage)
---
They have an entire group dedicated to toxicity. Announced during year 4 reveal.
---
What happens
---
yees
---
Nice man, I’m starting my ranked journey with my two brothers today on pc, I hope I can place above copper 
---
The M870 is the best m8.
---
 (there are many ways to interpret this sentence)
---
the floating debree
---
Capitao and Gridlock are for area denial, but they accomplish it in very different fashions. 
---
Much like Hibana and Thermite are both hard breachers, but accomplish them in different fashions...
---
Ah
---
I saw no difference in performance with my PC. Then again, My PC generally doesn't give a fuck and still runs just fine in games that are notorious for bad PC optimization.
---
How does someone miss s joke like that? Its literally the point of the OG comment 😂😂
---
I mean all operators have to be shredded to carry two magic metal walls around, plus ammo, plus primary, secondary, grenades and gadget
---
Your getting hate for this but I see your point. I have the season pass so didn't pick them at all so that people without could give them a try. 
---
Latest patch. I think it's my favorite. Even though I haven't bought it yet. 
---
Is it possible her shield was blocking the shots? Something's definitely fucky, I'm just unsure what
---
It looks like the sleeves are tucked in Uber the main body of the jacket, I’m not sure but I think on the rear view you can see a sleeve dropping down from her side. Could be mistaken tho
---
&gt;r/recursion
---
FTFY
---
Ballsy vault considering you killed frost at that window.
---
your name gives me PTSD to the most toxic jackass I’ve ever met, but I’m like 98% certain you’re not him lol. and no worries, I just hate when people act like that on the internet just because they can hide behind their screens 
---
I see what you’re saying but in my opinion they are more similar than you think. Same goes for most of the recent operators like Bandit and Kaid.
---
Yeah but sometimes you can do stupid stuff with the hostage 
---
Assuming it’s a prebuilt, I wouldn’t pay that much. (1150 euro = ~1300 USD). Mine has a lower end Ryzen 5 (1400), a single 8gb stick of DDR4 RAM, 2 TB harddrive, upgraded CPU cooler, and a GTX 1060. Paid little over 900 USD (~850 Euros). And I know what all my parts are worth since I was the person who chose the exact parts.
---
I've been seeing him played a lot more recently actually. He's not that had. 
---
This would be crazy they would have to make him easier to be countered. 
---
Beautiful
---
they buffed the recoil, not what it used to be, half way there. also it now does 35 dmg 
---
There is also a sealed window you can repel enter through near Storage area. (Is right up against a small brick wall and is on standing hight)
---
Btw £ is pounds and it’s custom built 
---
Because if theres no bundle players have to spend more time and money on the game
---
Idk. I still think they should give him 3 scans with 15-20 sec cool down. 
---
Good luck to you and your brothers. Have fun on your journey 
---
Nah you play fortnite
---
Sorry to break it to you man but that was a 2K lol
---
&gt; or at least no one plays Jager because he lost his ACOG.
---
Jager still has a really high pick rate. Hell more often then not even in Protect Hostage Terrorist Hunt there is still a Jager on the team, and his ADS is pretty much useless against the Terrorist AI.
---
You weren't looking at him lmao...
---
As well as Siege 
---
spam? that's a big no-no
---
Has anyone hacked a twitch drone with Mozzie? I tried shooting one directly and it exploded and the twitch drone was fine. 
---
I just got back from a long break, it’s honestly so nice i was getting so sick and tired of siege I stopped playing around the end of grim sky and just started playing again last week, 10/10 
---
I expected a skyrim meme. 
---
Just haven’t seen them lately but at least he will stand in the way before the hostage gets fused.
---
/r/foundmobileuser
---
I tried contacting Epi and Noty, Epi can't relied but Noty said it's because they are evaluating prices for old operators, I asked for there is an estimate but I never got a response back 
---
It's actually hilarious them trying to justify abusing it and getting mad
---
its ma'am!
---

Thanks, I appreciate it!

Ah, a finished game

“Ay, we dropping !dropper! than planting?”

Gamer socks 100%

Does the shield go onto her back when she gets AirJabbed? Or is it just off to the side or something
---
Sick
---
Tell that to EA and actiblizz
---
5'10 230lbs
---
She's obese
---
Getting kills with it feels really nice. Also did you tell the tkers to cry more?
---
Breaking news: Russian Sniper literally to angry to die
---
Anyone remember back in Y1 how easy it was to get fuze kills. 
---
Yes...
---
My first two legendaries was that Ela headgear... And then the same headgear again...
---
You teammates were de-ranking i guess. Faced this a lot of times. Feels Bad !
---
It will help from the sparks...not so much the explosion tho
---
Most people were piping up as soon as she got announced. 
---
Lmao he might be
---
Thank you. I've never seen this video just the one of Hibana and Echo together ...
---
I like it. But Twitch’s drone is balanced fine. There needs to be a drone tradeoff when picking her operator. Her drone would be like Lion in a sense
---
uh cause she is. Why you upset about it
---
Man she just THICC tho
---
Yes. That is literally the point of the season pass.
---
Or they could shoot something at the camera, like Mozzie's pest but on attack, and instead of controlling the cam it loops it for x seconds
---
They should change it 
---
"They have the same usage."
---
Ash's charge is literally called a *breaching round* and Zofia's can breach as well, not to mention her 2 disorientation shots.
---
Glaz is also used for fragging, why don't you call him the same operator?
---
So is Blackbeard.
---
So is Buck, who has nades.
---
So is Sledge, who has nades.
---
You're oversimplifying roles and saying that they're identical.  I could literally just say that all the operators are used to win the game and I'd be just as accurate as you.
---
They aren't the same operator, Zofia is a more team-oriented and balanced operator compared to Ash, that's just all there is to it.
---
That wall is all sorts of fucked up. I was playing earlier today and got killed because of it 
---
Remember when the gold skin was busted on the japanese ops pistols? but it actually looked cool
---
Hot
---
You didn't explain how.
---
Sledge can smash the camera with a melee attack, but only him.
---
Maverick can destroy it with his blowtorch.
---
Thatcher can temporarily blind it with an EMP grenade, but not destroy it like Valk cams. Twitch can also do this, but her drone can only destroy it if the shutter is open, even though it causes damage.
---
Dokkaebi can hack it by killing an enemy and stealing their phone, but that doesn't prevent him from using it, she can just use it too, minus the laser.
---
You can also destroy it by shooting it when the shutter is open.
---
It's also a thermal camera that can see through smoke.
---
You also need to know good camera positions and important high traffic areas.
---
Compare to Rook:
---
You place a bag of bulletproof vests for your team. Anyone wearing one takes less damage from all sources and can't be instantly killed by bullets unless it's a headshot.
---
Gridlock is one of my least favorite operators to play, plainly just because she is SUPER clunky. Same reason I don’t play Fuze often.
---
Two weeks is not a short amount of time for something like this
---
No need to be an ahole lol
---
I mean when I saw her I underestimated her ability 
---
I agree with Finka  doesn’t need a buff but she’s interesting because she is really good but she’s considered not “fun” to play. So now you see her with a low pick rate hit with an extreme high win rate so she’s kinda stuck for now
---
Well getting TK'd every round made sure that I couldn't play the game, but I was saying thanks as I could actually text my buddies while spectating the round :) 
---
I used 2 weeks because that's when the season started (counting the live server for PC)
---
“Bister”
---
My advice just play ranked more don’t care about rank don’t stop playing rank if your scared of losing the rank you have. 
---
New Leaked gun?
---
He's probably some edgy kid trying to be funny, even thoughe he isn't
---
Ikr?
---
Nah. The game automatically puts your bullet  where tf it wants with certain guns and the deagle is one. It isnt a straight shot hip fire. The only way you can get a straight fire hip shot is with luck 
---
People do it all the time to rook and monty
---
Please make an entire rainbow manga 
---
This is literally why Glaz needs that rework soon. A sniper should not beat other highly trained operators medium to close range.
---
Pretty sure its  "as a friend would say, time to make a new door" or something along those lines
---
I can spawn kill with frost on this map. Its a bad map for this reason.
---
This is beyond science....
---
Hacker*woman*
---
Permission to agree?
---
AsH dOeSnT cOuNt
---
You defecated on the other team that hard and it still went to the last round.
---
Yeah you may have a point there
---
I don’t know but you could report to ubi
---
if you can control the recoil, yes :D
---
He hit 10k on twitch I believe
---
-my- OUR NANOBOOST 
---
But Lion and Finka are actually from their respective units and joined the CBRN. Maverick is from "The Unit" AKA Delta Force who then joined the GSUTR.
---
Yacht?  Plane?  Did you even play ranked when these were in the playlist?  Plane is as awful as house and only marginally better than border was.  
---
Would have been perfect for Ash
---
have you played any casual in this season? Might wanna do before commenting about the topic
---
The kill cam doesnt show what the other guy sees
---
Dude holy shit that corner is so dark
---
Turns icon yellow to red. Ten thousand upvotes. 
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
Oh, yeah kinda forgot about that 
---
So what you went into is more game knowledge and how to play Maestro well and not get steam rolled while playing him. What I was saying is a more general overview to introduce a character to someone with 0 knowledge of the game. If I say "This character has 2 bulletproof laser shooting cameras he can put down", you know what his ability is. Sure, you don't know how to play him at a pro level but to just quickly introduce the Op, that short sentence is all you need. Hell, that's exactly how I described it to my girlfriend who doesn't play siege at all and she knew what I was talking about. 
---
   
---
they do not care to fix what's wrong with the game, they want to bring novelty and sell copies of the game. 
---
Half the community is about 13 and somehow they all end up in my lobbies.
---
Sucks it’s for his bad gun
---
Big Maps?
---
Big problems! 
---
When Bandit becomes Blitz and should be called "That German guy"
---
I wish it did, I wonder what he saw. It may just be that
---
Ahh I see. Thanks

You take a picture of The Challenge on the home screen but didn't click on it find out how
---
Gotta be politically correct or **else**.

Not sure but the nostalgia

Level 126: Fuck Tower. I've given up trying to learn it.

You’ve done a great job. I would have given you silver if I wasn’t broke after buying rainbow six siege.

Hello rgjiv, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b0rh2u/the_level_of_desperation_to_get_diamond_in/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Should just remove the ability to team kill from casuals. Literally just played a game there and was team killed each round by 3 people obviously partied up. 
---
I was pointing something out faggot
---
That's stunning 
---
Fuze might be the worst attacker, but he is very difficult to balance and would be very annoying to play against if he was too good. I feel the gadget should either stay the way it is or completely rework it. A viable buff could be making him a 2 speed.
---
Assuming since he’s received a Yellow Headgear from Alpha Packs, he must’ve received a Yellow Uniform as well.
---
Jackal has received a Yellow Headgear, Uniform and Weapon Skin for his AR as well.
---
Maverick received a Yellow for his DMR.
---
1: We know how these theories work out in practice. Discussing the most hopeful of theoretical implementations is utterly pointless. No real implementation of communism will ever be stateless. You can manage that in very, very small communes and that's it. Don't speak of utopias or the utopian vision of an ideology. They're unrealistic, unachievable, and ignore basic psychological facts about human nature. Example: Communists greatly underestimate the commonality of human greed and push it as only a condition that the wealthiest of us have.
---
2: It's the collectivization of private property ("the theory of Communism can be summed up in one sentence: the abolition of private property", Karl Marx) which includes all land, which means even common labor like farming is then collectivized. You get to work the farm because the state allows you to stay and live on it. Not because you as the individual have chosen to do so.

You mean tinfoil?
---
If you pay attention to your crosshair during your slow mo, you never hit the head when shooting.

You deserve death for running out

But can it launch a 50kg projectile at a height of over 300m?
---
"Bland" is nice tbh, i dont want all legendaries to be neon bling with LED and music, it should just be a high quality skin
---
I got my 1st after getting memed by the chance upto around 40-50% and that was months ago maybe even a year. 
---
I think it's win 100, maybe you lost a few?
---
Hey as an aspiring mav main mind giving some hole tips 
---
impact grenades are made to open rotations, besides opening barricades and destroy gadget enemies .. but the game is not broken only in this, there are many things that do not work correctly. I just set an example. the closed doors for you and the other is open was just another example.
---
The problem with shields is that if you look left at a certain moment  it doesnt show it right away on other peoples screen which causes you to die from a bs looking way
---
This would be actually terrifying. Any floor or drone hole is suddenly unsafe.
---
What is that app? 
---
I’ve gotten my first Yellow yesterday since Grim Sky and it was sadly for Bucks DMR.
---
As my friend has received 3 Black Ice and 3 Yellows since the end of Wind Bastion. 
---
I wouldn’t say it’s cheating but typically secure area has not as tryhard players as bomb does
---
Thanks
---
Lucky. I spent like 3 months grinding for each op. Like 2 weeks ago I got Zofia 
---
Ah, Favela. Favela is a magical place.
---
True. I feel as if he is almost underpowered right now. A combo I want to try is 
---
Maverick, capitão, montange, twitch/blitz , and glaz
---
Thank you
---
In mother Russia, you strike lightning
---
All I can find are clock speeds. Weird.
---
thank you
---
Red faction? 
---
Yesterday I carried a guy to plat 3 (I'm silver 2 lol)
---
A very long time ago
---
Thank you 
---
You didn't mark it out on Ubisoft's reply, but I'm not complaining haha
---
Oo!!! Or even swap the smoke for tear gas
---
Oh rip mate. Don’t worry you only have a few months until the next operators lol.
---
An ADS gets two uses. A drone would be a waste on a shot, and take away any use with Mozzie.

Wait you did not completely sexualize her. You'll never be a able to compete with wifi bait. /s seriously good job though.
---
I actually dont mind fortress. Id take it over Theme Park any day.
---
Well you can start by removing all the damn yellow from it, this just looks like a low attempt karma grab.
---
Lmao Exactly! I hate her character model.
---
I believe it says on the roadmap.
---
Yes, that was the plan, I tried to make him look like his voice actor.
---
Did a vote on my previous pic about who I should paint next, and Tachanka won it easily. I already mentioned there that I want to use his voice actor as face model :)
---
Think outside of the State
---
r/woosh
---
It was about 3AM (EU) and we were like the only 10 players on at the time so we kept re-queuing. We played around 4 matches. Won 2 and lost 2. I wanna say my KD was around 1.2-1.3 at the end of the night in the total 4 matches. I didn't do too great tbh
---
She also says “setting trace’s thermo touch” 
---
I think trace is supposed to mean thermite since his actual name is Jordan trace and I believe that is what it means
---
YOU VAN COUNT ON OSTRUPPEN! NO REALLY! YOU CAN
---
That's really awesome actually. I was wondering more because I hoped it was a chain store that had a location in my town, but thats way cooler than I expected lol.
---
Just very unlucky all the time it would seem 
---
See you on the front page?
---
That looks amazing
---
I'm just as surprised as you.
---
Console or PC?
---
I leave the match whenever I get it. Lol. 
---
*puts the whole essay in quotes*
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
Castle but worse 
---
Well, you're rather wrong. I don't care much for getting karma. I just wish to get more involved in the community and improve. Thank you regarded for your mean but somewhat constructive comments. 
---
You my friend are a legend 🤣 that's awesome 
---
How good is the wifi?
---
Mav and Capitão are already a super good combo but I don't really see how the others would fit in. Maye Glaz but the other 2/3 I cant see how they fit in.
---
I just got it two ranked games in a row
---
Nice!
---
I don't understand why her holograms don't match what's equipped on the playable character. Putting any cosmetic on her literally destroys her to play the way that's intended because she won't  look anything like what her holograms are. I feel like they should make it so that it does reflect the actual character, so that 1. It would buff her as she's a pretty mediocre OP, mainly because putting attachments on your gun can be so revealing, and 2. It would actually let you buy her cosmetics and not ruin the OP/Gadget. This is a long overdue tweak that Ubi just looks over.
---
I only play if my phone hotspot gives me over 10mbps 
---
Np, also just gonna add in here rook and doc are my spawn peeking gods. MP5 with an acog is deadly
---
Explain, are they just not dying? Or are they just getting downed, because if they're just downed, that probably means they have a rook on their team.
---
I used Autodesk Sketchbook but yes, you're right.

You weren’t supposed to do that

Lol nice

It’s not shitty is just to dark and to many doors.

She's not using Acog. Hmmmmmmmmmm, I wonder why?

Bro..... how was it not obvious I’m just messing around? Man it’s impossible to banter or bust balls these days

That mozzie thing happend to me the first time I played him 😂
---
Defenders are only indoors for gameplay, they operate everywhere in cannon 
---
Yeah I was like Gold 4 last season I think and this random played Monty, that's fine I guess. But, he had no mic so.. he shouldn't of played him IMO and also he used Monty for fragging out (but was too trash to and died every round) also never extended the Monty shield. Like wtf

We're usually Plat in every Op.
---
The new patch reduced the damage of breach charges, so not only is it dumb luck that two people were standing next to the window, but they were also low enough health to be outright killed by the breach.
---
fuck you im your team mate  bich
---
Maybe it’s Boomer’s cousin, Boomah
---
Enhance. 
---
This doesnt even look remotely like that skin
---
Yup that makes sense
---
If I recall correctly it was Montagne who tested the shield (then probably helped her out with it)
---
Need a damn bluelight filter 
---
nice
---
I like it a lot, definitely better than Fortress or Hereford base. 
---
I've had a thing like this before. I was about lvl 20 and I got a weird legendary skin for Blackbeard and Rook

---
That people barley use
---
Screw top I believe 
---
Ahhhh, Bartlett 
---
I can sort of see that because Grim Sky was DEFINITELY heavily more themed on the British side (Hereford rework + ALL Universal skins were British themed (Majesty + Sovereign referencing the Royalty, Whitehall 1212 referencing the MPS and Spitfire referencing Hereford). US/Maverick got no universal skins at all that season.

if he doesnt look like this on his face reveal we riot

Haha thought this was an oil rig and boy was i confused.

you hear that guy?

||That's the sound of Doc mains all spontaneously killing themselves.||

Y’all on PC? 
---
At least it's not hostage.
---
Yikes. Sounds like he's one of those op ideas that are either overpowered, or underpowered when balanced. There's no in between for Blackout.
---
I'd still like having it. 
---
It wouldn't be so dark that it would be impossible for the attackers to see, but just dark enough that a flanker would be able to get the first shot on the enemy.
---
Right? Seriously need two flairs to represent our mains.

When you destroy a Mozzie Pest, the points should say "+# With A Drone, No Way!"

They add new items the first day of every new season, unannounced

That’s not a solution at all, that’s playing a different game mode and ignoring the problem

Yes. One is usually plat 3 or around the gold ranges. I never got plat, almost got gold 3 like yesterday but lost a Match (random went 1-8 so kinda hard to carry him).. shouldn't be hard to get though.

Congrats dude, be sure to update us when you get your first mvp and ace. I remember getting my first mvp, and shaking the whole last round. This game can be brutal, and a theres a lot of toxicity, but god dam it makes you feel good when you hit personal milestones.
