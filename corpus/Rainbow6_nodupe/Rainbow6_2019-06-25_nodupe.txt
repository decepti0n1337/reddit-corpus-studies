 (George\_Miester) is me the rest are a DDOS team! [https://i.imgur.com/WHaeDG1.png](https://i.imgur.com/WHaeDG1.png)
---
For me my issues with her using the FMG-9 are that it's just slightly too weak(IMO) for her role and it's the wrong weapon for who she is supposed to be lore wise. 
---
The FMG-9 would have made perfect sense for Warden but makes no sense for Nokk. By comparison I think Mute's MP5K would have been a much better pick both lore and stats wise as it's only marginally better having four more minimum damage and it's .2 seconds faster with both reloads. To me that tiny bump in reload time and minimum damage would help make Nokk more appealing without making her OP at all.
---
I’d rather just use the CZ and control the recoil while full auto
---
Damn you *never* draw IQ
---
The LED setup tho👀
---
nah, hes not hacking, just pure skill.
---
Bandit is like *Hello there*
---
On PC it's thermite/jackal cav/echo until plat, then it becomes really random.
---
Found the guy who wonders why he is stuck in gold
---
I think it's just a meme tbh
---
life
---
I thought he said "no Russian" because he wanted to make a joke about to not rush in, by not saying rushing but Russian. But I could also be wrong.. so there's that.
---
Haha wait Nevermind the mods removed it. Inconsistent and unfair moderation all around. Really bummed out cuz of it :(
---
But reddit has multiple subreddits for a good reason, I only want a subreddit like this so people looking for pc clips can see this subreddit and the people posting can just put it on this subreddit and the pc one too.
---
Lag?
---
Nah lol he was running into objectives going mach 5 going at people
---
Well if they've done it once before it's super easy to guess where they're going next and you can shoot it by the first one
---
You should always be using c4 with Mira though
---
True that
---
Bruh, they’re *black ice*
---
Fuzing the hostage AND his teammates...
---
Hope you enjoy her, she’s a ton of fun to play. I personally think she’s the best soft breacher in the game.
---
Nope.
---
Oh, there's more
---
nah, thats pretty normal.
---
I think shotguns are stronger on console because it's harder to aim with a controller giving AR and semi-automatics a slight disadvantage.
---
Oh boy I sure do love playing my favorite operator in this game
---
He's 1.63m tall, I think. That is pretty short.
---
There’s a big rn where if you hit alt+f4 it’ll recreate IQ glitch but with twitch. Only works with twitch though.
---
no and no
---
It’s a new glitch, saw some guy doing it a few days ago.
---
Maybe if she had an AR she'd be useful
---
I love thepeople in cas that will rage and whine when i rush and spanwpeek every round, completely convinced I'm sweating my ass off.
---
Me spawnpeeking 3 rounds in a row isn't exactly a high IQ strat, nor is rushing every round with Ash/IQ.
---
You clearly forgot vac
---
Wonderful, whats is happening with all these glitches
---
Or a Jäger nerf
---
Those are fighting words right there partner
---
Nice Ace.
---
[removed]
---
True that too, I’ve been called a MnK user on console just solely because I’m pretty decent at the game, I’ve been stuck in plat 3 limbo for the past 4 seasons. 
---
It’s actually hilarious.
---
vigiled
---
Like if you think is gay
---
The plan is to ban them all during a sale so they can all buy new accounts for cheap and Ubi can reap the rewards.
---
"spawn peeks are not a problem"
---
"just kill them"
---
"dont spawn"

-every idiot ever that thinks maps are balanced for spawning

It's already gone though?

Extended barrel is literally broken and is only viable on [2 or 3 guns](https://youtu.be/iw84aFDN2Cw).
---
If you notice the ban waves hit when there is a sale.  It is a business decision.  Ban all the hackers during the sale so they will pick the game right back up giving Ubi more cash.
---
That has always happened but it's getting worse and worse every season, most of these people are good players but their behavior makes me sick, most of them are wannabe pro players who are not good enough for pro-league so they inflate their egos by shitting on people in casual or creating smurf accounts to shit on even more people. And as soon as they die, they either leave immediately or send some hate message to the enemy team.
---
top ten images taken right before disaster. number one, german track stars and the speedy death
---
Ah ok thanks
---
you're a dick goatse.
---
Its not ddosing its the servers been happening to everyone...
---
I choose echo, and if not him Valk so I can still gather information.
---
Ok you got a point there
---
Want to switch?
---
There isn’t a year 3 yet it only arrives as soon as user 4 ends
---
Yeah man, I don't know what platform you play on but it's probably a community problem on Xbox.
---
They gave grenades to finka because she was under played; not because she was weak
---
I don't really know why people would want to kick you out during prep phase besides the fact that they find it funny. 
---
But also if you're the last man alive people usually tend to kick you to get the round over with as they either aren't optimistic you'll win the round or they just want to start playing immediately rather than just sit there spectating you.
---
Draw iq more plzz
---
I said 85%, but that's really not that far off.  I think in 50 matches, I have defended first maybe 3-4 times.
---
Shotty or ar?
---
Congratulations soldier
---
With real money. That aint the smartest thing to do with your money for a digital skin.
---
On mobile it’s a little weird. You have to hold the power button for ten seconds on iPhone, and take your SIM card out on Android.
---
this is casual but I've tried it in (console) gold and I get a kill every time someone pushes from here
---
I'm beginning to think the same about Nokk and Warden. 
---
Apparently they were too powerful with decent guns, so now they have terrible ones?
---
Of the last 8 or so operators, maybe the Aussies, Mav and Finka are legitimate. Lion is permanently broken and his update didn't change that, Clash is dumb and ~~Kindle~~ *Nook* and Warden went from OP guns to terrible ones.
---
Oh yeah, probably, I'm on PC
---
You *WHAT*
---
Well it is a black ice skin
---
30 seconds left and I get to Gold 1.
---
3v1 were defending and have defuser. Easy win.
---
About to kill final enemy and I'm in the main menu becuase I DC. I end up losing ELO which I should have gained.
---
I need a shoulder to cry on 😢😢😢
---
SASG for life
---
You were right about not caring
---
Gotta use the sasg tho lol
---
Reposted without even updating to new ops

---
Why does it look like there's a penis in the reflection, on the left.
---
I'd say Top
---
And I'd know
---
People think that? Wow
---
congrats
---
but i don't-understand why they cant just take her claymores off her . and give her grandes back and there wouldn't be a problem with her IQ is a good op no need to removed
---
Dont hate me! Ubi took my ACOG away! It's not my fault.
---
Ok but like how?
---
No friends
---
I have 5.7 USG, MP5, Sg-cqb and the p9.
---
(now that you know) you can even edit it (as I did) by going in the 3 dots, selecting one and click on "edit" on the top right! ;)
---
Thats Caveira and Jackal mains now that you can ban operators in ranked
---
No joke her helmet makes her look so stupid imo
---
Players on both kbm and console strafe to peek 100% of the time.  Also on console, say you sprint off spawn with your analog stick up, it might be at 0.0006 degrees, while on keyboard, it'll be 0 degrees exactly in every instance.  Again, thats why APIs could easily be implemented to eliminate players with kbm patterns.
---
This is what drones are for but I bet they still got mad like "Who the fuck sits there" definitely gonna try this though
---
That amazing
---
I’d say there all pretty much the same, am I missing something?
---
Spawn peaking as the Lord on the turrent is acceptable.
---
lol people still solo q and are surprised when people are toxic?
---
I'm hoping to move on that platform soon, saving up for one!
---
Clash on attack and being spawn peeked by blackbeard is nightmare fuel
---
Well as you can see in the clip that's what happened. Like half went over his head and some hit the bars so don't blame the game.
---
SEALs are definitely special forces, FBI I'm not so sure. pretty sure the american FBI ops are FBI SWAT tho
---
It was one of the worst seasons to play so you didn't miss much lol
---
Yes thats what rng is🙌

Dude it's soooo worth it. I've been playing PC for a decade but didnt fully invest in a good setup until early April this year, and it's so much different than playing on anything else. It's literally like playing a different game

Thanks bud, airsoft is something I want to get into but maybe in a year or two, once I have a friend or two deep into paintball I can talk them into trying airsoft.
---
So... Play your own servers?

---
Y’all dumb.  She’s a danish soldier. And danish soldiers wear nets over their helmets and draw eyes on their helmets to scare their enemy’s and to trick them.
---
The crotch grab for emphasis is my favorite part
---
Zofia or Doc
---
But they don't ban the cheaters. The "Report Toxicity" button does nothing, there is no dedicated button for suspected DDOSing or MnK (which they have said is cheating), and I have never heard of anyone being banned on console for anything other than teamkilling.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I did a little experiment about a month ago with my friend. Every single game I played with him, I reported him for toxicity. Probably 50+ reports total over the span of maybe 3 weeks, and he didn't get as much as a slap on the wrist.
---
lol ok kid
---
Just because someone is better then you that doesn’t mean that they are a try hard lmao.  God I don’t understand people like you.
---
never said that video games caused them stabbings, but think if there were no violence in any game then maybe it could help idk
---
People kept jumping through it every round!
---
Coconut brah, narcoleptic nugget
---
I get his scope is good for long range pick-offs because of the small center dot but I think they should tweak it so it become's less of an SLMG (Sniper LMG)
---
All these are good but hands down my fav are Grizzy,Soup,Jay and them fucking hilarious man plus offensive memes every turn
---
How is this not a problem in any other game then? It isn't a problem in Overwatch, CS:GO, League of Legends...
---
I don't mean to be snarky, genuinely want to know.
---
What do you mean! Look how much detail there is! It's like better than the Elite!
---
Just when I started using her more
---
GODDAMN
---
The scope is only on the M249 and the M249 SAW so it isn't like it is all over. The better scope is just a way to make the M249s seem more attractive to players over the ARs available to Capitao and Gridlock.

Bitter about what? I'm not even the person you were replying to. Why you're so aggressive here is beyond me.
---
that makes two of us, look at your name, something to do with siege, you care too much dude about the game to have something like that in your name, look up the people with r6 in their name on ps4, they have 1 game which is siege and just smurf smurf smurf, again why
---
Looks good but u not worried to be spotted from across the map?
---
It is really cool. Not sure if it’s better then the elite but it is definitely awesome
---
I agree, I was playing clubhouse recently on bedroom. Accessing the stairwell was impossible because of an insanely long range peak. It makes playing that objective almost impossible.
---
And if your telling me to stop trying to get an imaginary piece of metal then why are you getting so mad at people 😂
---
all a thatcher would see is barbed wire and not do anything
---
Going back to the original comment about the mp5 if you want to have more versatility for nokk I would agree with giving her this, but at the moment(excusing clash,deplorable shields, hackers and whatever also is broken in game) she is in a good spot comparatively to the other ops, she has a job and does it well and to give her more versatility might make her do her job too well and intrude on other ops jobs. Also on your dream for nokk g36c it would be overpowered as stated by the devs themselves during testing and looking at the magazines on her vest that’s the weapon I believe she had originally.
---
Im not saying you did its an example thats where the etc comes into play. Also Like back In the day when we were witnessing genocide on massive scales without video games. I'm on the other side people get out stress etc playing video games not think " ohh I shot a player let's go phyco"
---
whos getting mad? im just saying tryhards are pointless, my opinion, if im screaming at people then thats getting mad
---
It's a tippmann TMC. About $300 Canadian fresh out of the box. Minus the attachments and upgraded stock.  Just the gun, 2 mags, stock rail sights and adjustable stock.
---
At least now I know it’s not just happening to me.
---
Yeah I kinda miss iq lol
---
My name? My name has nothing to do with siege literally nothing 😂. And I don’t play on PS4 I play on PC so I can’t do that
---
Pro-League Maestro Cam spots my guy. Perfect for executing downed Ash's who broke their legs in frost mats.
---
Go look at most recent upload on my sub friend.
---
oh I forgot that he even exists mb
---
The thing that makes me hesitant is what you explained before with the fiddling you had to do. It just scares me that I’ll plug it in, turn it on, install everything, then my game won’t launch, okay why is it not launching? Etc etc.
---
ash jager main? thats what your name shows for me
---
No your just ranting for no reason. You know that posting this on reddit will do absolutely nothing but you getting hate.
---
The deployable shield has been experiencing glitches, therefore it has been removed from the game until it's fixed. As for the alpha pack disappearing, it's just a visual glitch, it should come back if you restart your game.

This sounds stupid to me. They beat you fair and square. This would make the game way more realistic but would be so annoying. Every kill would be a trade and it would make it a lot less fun
---
I prefer impacts
---
What a hip-fire. Meanwhile I can't aim for shit even when ADSing!
---
Isn't g2 up there?
---
Ping!
---
im fine with that, lets me call as many people as possible pathetic, if they dont like it then tough, tryhards are pathetic
---
But mozzie can't take his drone outside for more than 3 seconds. Was it in customs or something?

That’s a user flair for this subreddit. My name isn’t “ash Jäger main lol dab”. 😂

Buck or Hibana for Attack

Valk or Cav for Defense.

Clash’s smg used to be two shot burst
---
Hey Hey!
---
I get put into games (ranked or casual) and I still see people crouch spamming. They’re crouch spamming fix hasn’t stopped it at all.
---
I know games can relieve stress but not siege lol
---
I KNEW IT WAS A BIKE HELMET
---
He's not even plat. He's the same rank as your team. He just queue with a silver. The two of them playing together have managed to reach players of your rank. Thats what best describes them.

They banned boosted accounts on PC\*\*\*. They haven't done anything to curb toxicity or cheating on console at all. The "Report Toxicity" button on console does literally nothing. I would love for something to happen to the cheaters to discourage them from doing something like this in the future, but I can't imagine it will ever be implemented. 
---
Siege on console is open season. MnK, DDOS, lag switching, general toxicity goes unpunished so the numbers will only increase.
---
yup. for me if i want to releive stress by playing a game i would play a story mode for a game
---
It’s as a joke. I hope you aren’t this dumb please tell me your joking 😂
---
Above 10k, and I also have all the year ones
---
If you plan on playing ranked, I'd say capito. I can't tell you how often I've ninja planted and blown people up with that claymore by smoking the entrance to obj and planting inside smoke. Being able to hold doorways and the diffuser without being inside obj makes him (in my opinion) the absolute best op for bomb play.
---
My guy is in another galaxy
---
And “grow up” I’m not the one crying about people being better then me at a game
---
Idk man, I wanna believe this is real but it wasn’t a spray and pray, it was a single exact point on the wall that you just happened to shoot directly at, without moving your reticle an inch in any direction. It’s too exact for me
---
i dont, but ill still call every tryhard pathetic
---
To think that his elite can barely top his default skin.
---
Took is not a romer though
---
They tested her out with the G36C? That's pretty cool, I didn't even know that. And yeah, I totally agree that Nokk with an AR is overtuned, I just meant for a little day dream where it weren't overtuned, that gun would be ideal, given how, despite the G36C being a beautiful gun, is overshadowed by a generic carbine.
---
But back to our discussion, if she IS in a good place comparatively, maybe she shouldn't be given an ACOG, you are right. If I wanna go to a seperate issue though, I find that the silencer's damage reduction is a bit of a kick in the teeth though, if I'm being honest, on an op who needs to (this is me speaking for nobody but myself) equip a silencer. Hence my thoughts on the MP5SD.
---
I thought she was like be quiet but her knife was a finger
---
Easy solution. Don’t PM him. You instigated it so this is on you.
---
Brutaka!
---
My problem is I always get silver 1-3 and go against golds 1’s because of how my skill falls, gotta love the ELO ranking system
---
I’m so fucking calm right now
---
ok or OR...just scan the bloke and be done with it.
---
Damn
---
I dunno, I think the worst state was when they had a bug where you could just walk out of the deployment zones and drop c4 into all the spawns instantly killing the attackers was probably the worst season. 
---
I don't think this is the worst season for cheaters either, I mean the most blatant in the recent history of the game for sure. Some of the early seasons had it just as bad if not worse.
---
For the bugs, they have been reintroducing them since season 1. I have been harping on it since around then telling them to get their revision controls done properly, but it appears "fuck it let's wing it" takes the day. When I was coding basic stuff with a friend we used githubs little system. Where you "check out" code at a certain level, it marks it when you go to merge it back, it amalgamates all the changes that others have made into yours, also gives notes as to why the edits were made. So if you were to merge back in old code, it would recognize the old code and say "hey this has been updated - note is 'fixes drop shotting.' Would you like to merge (take your changes with patched), overwrite (NO BRING BACK TEH BUG), or test w/ the new changes (Keeps your revision checked out, but updates to the bug fix to make sure there is no unintended consequences). If something bad goes on it has a save of every single revision you uploaded/made changes to or earmarked. There are lost of this type of programs, not just online on github where companies can use their own servers to store the info.

Sure, ImagineWagons91

In the heat of the moment you might think you’ve hit them. Or your recoil bounces the crosshairs to their head and you love your mouse away before it can shoot the next shot, causing it to seem like you hit them because of the constant bullet noises

i do know about that, i just didn't know what to call it. any info on the question?

Goblin and Bastard, anything after is hot garbage

Idk why they changed the colors. The old ones were much better. Like why tf is diamond purple
---
Why it isn't ubis fault. 
---
Dev team are a few hundred with limited time and actual things to do beyond just exploit probing. 
---
Players are millions, have seemingly unlimited time combined and many are adamant in finding the exploits get an advantage and don't report it until it becomes common knowledge via YouTube, Reddit, or other media.
---
If(theoretically speaking) it takes 1 person 100 hours to probe for one exploit the dev team will find about 50 every month. The players can find them every second due to exponentially higher probability in numbers and time.
---
This is a good reason for player testing and the TTS version being given out. Unfortunately the man power so a lot go unnoticed. This can also be used to explain why battleye, fairfight, and other anticheat systems, as well as pc security software, are not entirely foolproof and you still see cheaters. The "hackers" with a lot of time and numbers probe for the weaknesses and find ways to skirt it.
---
Source: cyber security sources from uni explained this method in several classes.
---
Yeah no, elo/mmr rollback is only for games with cheaters in them, nothing else as far as what Ubi has stated.

For what?
---
Watch all your clips to make sure they are headshots, you probably are near missing without realizing it and somethings pong issues can have to do with that
---
he can be at times
---
Not entirely feasible. 
---
If(theoretically speaking) it takes 1 person 100 hours to probe for one exploit the dev team will find about 50 every month. The players can find them every second due to exponentially higher probability in numbers and time. It would take months to get one update to come out and make it nearly airtight.

Mad ~~Max~~ Smoke

This makes no sense but i love it

Boo. Not a full round of lmg kills. Nice 4 piece though. I’d leave if I were on the other team.
---
I have never had a problem but I also don’t play ranked and it’s for that reason ranked is just too sweaty
---
NOKK IS A LIZARD PERSON CONFIRMED?
---
Ikr lol
---
It’s ok man she’s dead
---
In settings change thunt matchmaking settings to a different map and turn off non ranked maps
---
The real question is does anyone like Bartlett university at all in general
---
Firstly start off by playing thing and not situations
---
Secondly turn off the maps you don’t want in thing in the matchmaking settings
---
Reminds me of how in delta operators wear skateboard helmets because the PASGT helmets were heavy and didn't offer as much protection. they still wore some kind of helmet though just to prevent soldiers from hitting their heads on vehicle ceilings or low doorways.
---
Also if the defuser is planted attackers will stay DBNO.
---
If you remove competitive then wont people just "tryhard" in casual instead?
---
gotta love xbox where u can only get banned for saying fuck in a message 👍
---
Flex on that play rank.
---
but the operator prices have dripped
---
Get a girlfriend lmao
---
Ayyyy! It's getting famous!
---
XIM is also a massive problem and I can’t handle my rage because if it
---
Have they?

I have all ops so I don’t know
---
I appreciate the compliment, sir.
---
MUM GET THE CAMERA
---
Yes but it u shoot first and hit head it ok
---
Congrats, now go make another 🤓🤓👍🏽
---
Why not just play the game and stop team killing.
---
Buck makes mistakes like that a lot
---
There is still some use to it. Jackal's primary role is to help the team hunt out roamers. And as you can see, the third picture is where most of the scary roamers are. So if you see multiple different footprints in an area, at least you know which ones to prioritize scanning.

It's high noon

I'm not playing situations. Read the post.
---
Valkyrie and Blackbeard dropped to 10,000. 
---
Maestro and alibi dropped to 20,000. 
---
That was with the release of phantom sight. I have a spreadsheet of all operator prices if you want to see that but the rest have not changed yet.
---
There is still some use to it. Jackal's primary role is to help the team hunt out roamers. And as you can see, the third picture is where most of the good roamers are. So just memorize that one.

Holy fuck it's Alex Mercer as a gun

A non- Believer
---
Shes currently banned along with clash.
---
how am I supposed to win if they hold the defuser like that?
---
I agree that the DBNO potential is helpful, however, half the time if you’re roaming or not near someone it doesn’t really mean anything. From the perspective of a roamer, which is maximizing your kills it makes sense to have the extra juice for your self. Even better would be to have a rook anchor and then have a roaming doc.
---
To many dude
---
Did you come up with that all by yourself? That’s so clever of you! I don’t know how I’ll ever recover from such a harsh burn.

Got DDosed earlier tonight. 3-1 up and  it started, got messages saying to just quit. Its so incredibly sad.just wasted over an hour to a single game that my team ended up just forfeiting. so frustrating. the fourth time this season alone.
---
It’s a glitch everyone’s says 0. Don’t whoosh me I get that there is a joke here
---
Thats me taking the picture
---
Thank you fellow rook brothers
---
U just need to develop that little bit of muscle memory, and when you do so, it will work charm
---
Welcome to the 100 club
---
Good luck at R6 then. Have a good day.
---
The game is not balanced around realism, Hatch breaking is considered soft breaching able operators so its limited to a few select operators. Glaz can break them due to him originally being considered a weaker operator.
---
I mean id say the most quirky ops would be the ones that play for the team
---
I’m still confused on how to use the new glaz 
---
And is this a nerd or a buff?
---
I run it on all the d-50 I love it for nokk
---
What? Seriously?

Yea back at ya

Yep.

Also idk if you've heard of Russian badger but his YouTube video on dokkaebi made me laugh so God damned hard
---
Haha yaaa it’s not even something I do all the time but that felt so amazing but I definitely  do see where people are coming from when they say it’s a bit sus bc people do it to make it look like they aren’t hacking
---
I've seen a few who do. Just not many
---
I never got yelled at, but I don't play doc that much either, still I can believe that this is a scenario that happens often. I think is because they think doc is like mercy or medic and will follow them around with heals.
---
Boson bunch is a up coming meme seige YouTuber his content is very funny
---
Interesting. I noticed that drones get a proximity alert in the form of that static... 
---
1. Is his gadget really that affective based on this?
---
2. Is the bosg 12.2 still a viable choice for a primary?
---
Thanks in advance dude i appreciate it!
---
"Doki Doki Dokkaebi". Yes I have. I watch the whole gang Geuce, Xurbdic, C.o.b., etc.
---
The first time I got the Celestial I popped my golden gun and started singing "This Girl Is On Fire"
---
Wait was that an example of irony or did you just want to flex that you get kills with vigil?
---
Listen to the op video lol
---
If you can't pick an operator they will either give you IQ or Clash as excuse!
---
Send the videos to ubisoft.
---
Tonight I noticed the opposing team kept killing and vote kicking their 5th, which would quickly get replaced and they would do it again. Besides that they were constantly trash talking us all match. Let me tell you, it felt sooo good obliterating their toxic butts haha
---
Totally agree.   
---
Even if its temporary they are selling something that is immediately available. Only it isnt, It has no eta of returning and it isnt advertised anyway.   
---
If they disable an operator the sale of that operator should be stopped as well.   
---
Bought clash less then 24 hours since she was removed the first time, the first operator I unlocked with credits and not renown.    
---
Wont be buying any credits again and future season passes are an instant no.
---
What is that recoil?
---
Ok I'm a bit too lazy to look this up, can you quickly explain the difference because I've only ever seen them used to mean the same thing.
---
I think that be cool as a gadget
---
Steal her look
---
I agree, I wish it was just a dot like the coyote sight in bf4 though.
---
1. Can I just say that you forgot to mention Warden’s guns?
---
Primary: 
---
M590A1 - SAS shotgun
---
MPX - used by Valkyrie
---
Secondary:
---
Something similar to Ela’s pistol
---
SMG 12 - also used by Dokkaebi
---
2. He’s a 1 speed.

Dude I had the same experience. I felt so dumb when I realized. Then again I was in middle school and definitely couldn't grasp the gravity of the scene.

Well, text don’t convey irony very well plus you didn’t cross post or link the original in any way

I really like the full hasmat suit with the blacked out face mask like finka and lion
---
Don’t solo queue. Trust me, you will have a move enjoyable experience if you can find a squad to regularly play with. One place to look is r/R6STeams .
---
Don’t forget the “you killed yourself” 😂
---
It's fine to share it with this sub but you should give credits
---
Sorry i am new i didnt know
---
Same as before, though this time click Edit at the top right, choose Fuze and add other ops next to the text box.
---
This problem is definitely getting out of hand. My friend got doxed when we were leading 3-0 in GOLD ranked and we lost the game because these brainless children (friend got doxed b/c he joined the enemy party and he said they were around 12 years old).
---
This will be the biggest website since The Facebook
---
I usually only play finka when we got a buck or a jackal cos of their recoil.
---
What caused IQ to be removed from console?
---
damn, wish I knew this when I was constantly being banned from Habbo Retros hahahaha
---
Hardware ban would need Microsoft and Sony involved. Banning IPs won't help either since most people have dynamic IP address.
---
These are different sets, so you'll have to buy these. You'd be able to equip either the old or new sets.
---
He just has a really good gaming chair
---
Why is she banned
---
So you gonna tell us or...?
---
Idk man, he’s a strange one for sure. I just hope they consider giving him a buff of some kind because otherwise there will literally be no reason to pick him ever if he is kept the way he is. They clearly were afraid that he was going to be overpowered so they made him really underpowered as a result.
---

---
Well with troubleshooting, if you wait until a certain time (Usually around midday In almost all countries) you should be able to open a live chat with someone on the uplay support team in your country and sort out the issue there.

Nah dude, I'm not going to give you karma over something that will never happen

I'm not good enough to get aces so I kinda just do my own thing 90% of ranked matches : /
---
That was my initial rank (I wasn't able to play when PS first came out) So getting placed in gold 1 isn't bad at all. I plan on grinding all day tomorrow and hitting at least high plat 3 or low plat 2

I tried it didn't work

if these issues were on PC they’d be actively working on fixing it. console seriously needs addressed by ubisoft. between this and crouch spamming/dropshotting mouse and keyboard players in 9/10 games it’s becoming a joke...

Seriously even ignoring the instant spawn peek there are a butt load of potential ways to peek this spot anyways. I've lost so many hard breachers/thatchers to this exact spawn when going garage.

Cross-platform capability probably isn’t in the cards for a while – although it’s an exciting possibility for an Ubisoft representative to raise. Perhaps the key quote in the interview from the perspective of PC players is that Ubisoft is looking at the cross-generational leap in terms of technological continuity – the way it does with the game’s PC audience.&gt;When the next gen comes out, Ubi will undoubtedly create a PS5/Xbox 4 version of Rainbow Six Siege. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a launch title for both consoles. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If this happens, they’ll have to let players transfer their skins and purchases, like GTAV and BF4 did at the end of the last console generation.  
---
&gt;I also bet it will have cross platform play, and M&amp;KB support for consoles (and put players using controllers in separate lobbies, like several other games). 
---
&gt;Just a hunch. Hopefully it comes true.

&gt;Not to mention the 3 round sides is a fucking horrible idea for ranked
---
I agree with the rest of your comment but 3 round rotation is the best addition to ranked, even better than bans. I am honestly baffled as to why people insist it's bad.
---
Sadly I wasn't capturing.
---
Remove that laser sight.
---
Now.

Same lol
---
Well yeah, but I didn't expect him to be right behind that barricade.
---
I think he means since Sofia can res herself she can go places where other ops would bleed to death.  
---
That's my guess.
---
with that one im going for more balance than realism. Little things in siege make sense, Jackle's footprint scanner for instance.

Don't worry about it man it happens. I'm just an extremely fast learner and extremely smart person (I'm waiting approval to join MENSA), and I've always been good at video games (number 1 in the world for CoD BO3 ffa for around 6 weeks). Some people just have a natural talent for video games. Don't give up cause you could get there someday. 
---
I know if it wasn't for my squad (they were the reason I even got the game) I would barely even be in plat right now. So try to find people that are better than you to play with, eventually you will come up to their skill level and maybe even surpass them. That's what I did. ( I was originally ranked a bronze 2 my first season and ruined my KD playing with 4 plat 2's)
---
I'll keep trying casual and I'll try it with friends when i can.
---
Dude, he's not saying it's hard to counter, he's saying it's bad game design. Yeah, if you're any good at the game, runouts are free kills. Doesn't mean it's not idiotic design in a game where fighting is supposed to be indoors.
---
I’ve thought this in the past but what is the incentive to treat “non ranked ranked” as if it was ranked? People will just treat it as casual because their is no consequences for messing about.

That's because it's at the tip of the triangle. Same applies to the Russian Reflex sight. Would be dumb if it was in the centre of the triangle since it would obscure the whole body. It used to be 3x larger than it is now so it being at the centre would make it completely unusable.
---
#FINALLY, SOMETHING FROM R6 IS ON HOT!
---
Reported.
---
Ne yaparsın... Hayat bunları denk getirir bana :D
---
I mean just remember that its exactly the same as the Russian Reflex sight and you should be fine.

In one game the other team planted the defuser and then someone hijacked the servers so we couldn’t disable it.

The other day my *own* team tried to ddos me......like why

The only time i use the Spetsnaz red dot is on glaz where the sight doesnt obscure my vision. Everything else is their reflex/Acog

Sony is super stingy about allowing crossplay, and PC vs Xbox would be a horribly unfair advantage.  So probably not honestly.

Well people here have asked for weird buffs for characters that don't need it.
---
You had already downed 2 prior into the round as you got +50 for confirming kill, and that shot is too high to hit a downed person. So two were downed then you killed the last making it look like a collateral.
---
It requires a valid phone number

I feel like it would be today, Tuesday is the day the stores on both consoles update so it will must likely be sometime today.

You should have added blitz and Montange too

I wish I took a clip of a wall bang with blitz to someone right in the noggin I was not expecting

Just ban their account and make them buy a new copy.

It doesn't really have anything to do with my skill in the game,  but I'm in low plat each season. It doesn't have anything to do with anyone's skill in the game. The fact that this is your basis for making game design decisions on exemplifies that you are either 1. an idiot 2. haven't been playing games very long so you don't know any better. or 3. just young and naive so your first go-to when people attack something you like is to attack them personally.

I think the feeling of a "must pick" comes from the fact that hes the ONLY defender who can stop enemy projectiles. But his ADS's are easy to counter and dont pose much threat, so after that hes essentially a worse Ash. Jager isnt all that tbh, hes decent but thats where it ends.
---
Na That man was just lagging hard is what it is. Happened to me a few times and got called trash cause of it lol remember once i saw a drone that went in a room and ran out with valkryie and the thatcher was there on his phone and lit up his face yet none of my shots did any damage so as i was switching guns cause i ran out of ammo he got off and looked up and killed me. then called sent me a message saying my aim was trash lmao this game is fun

Similar instances where some operators have holsters for two pistols, finka with holographic sight, maverick with a different magazine size in his operator art (which is now changed).
---
I assume this was the case but they probably will keep any new remaining weapons for some really good operators that they feel should get them. There's some sort of legality issues that games run into when it comes to the number of weapons that they can copy and use in a game, ontop of this - reusing older weapons gives players more grip with learning weapon recoils on currently available guns rather than having to continually familiarise themselves.

There's not much people there.
---
Turns out this works, but I don't think it will be hard for ubi to patch
---
i used the info when the enemy killed him to my advantage
---
It was before testing.
---
Muting the chat does not help. And since the wonderful people at Ubisoft won’t let us vote kick players in ranked we are stuck with them for an entire match. Thanks for trying
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Yellow meta best meta
---
Where was this information made public?
---
She has a thicc behind
---
Hopefully they'll release the pro league skins on PC after it since consoles already have the bundles.
---
Too much lead in the drinking water
---
A LOT of people shit on Castle, but its because they dont know how to play him right. His Gadget isnt meant to stop defenders from getting onto site, although it can be used for that, its meant to use up enemy recourses and stop lines of sight. 
---
The ONLY thing I want to see changed about him is more customization options ;~;
---
This is garbage. I don’t want to hear how some mall cop shot a dog. Delet dis nephew
---
Idk, you can see it in other posts?
---
#me an intellectual, bans lesion
---
I think they mentioned it during the release in the stream, I do remember hearing this!
---
Hello candEla_Bosak, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c59y3v/o_o_f/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Infrastructure maintenance
---
What? Are you proud of being the toxic guy that shoots his teammates over an accident?
---
Yeah thanks.I haven’t gotten it so far but it seems unfair for others to go through it and sit here and do f all.I didnt mean this as a witch hunt but it seems like the only way to get to the devs/mods which would work
---
Ubi knows your potential mate 😉
---
Rainbow Six=/=BF5 
---
At least Ubisoft kind of wants historical accuracy than DICE.
---
I personally would prefer they add 2 rounds and make it a 4 round round rotation to allow the defenders have a chance to adapt to the attackers playstyle.
---
Now I understand better. Just seen too much of people immediately reinforcing the wall that is closest at the time and leaving to do other stuff. If it was later on, they should have been quicker or said something tbh. Teamkilling was idiotic on their end
---
Ill do that too but i just saw some guy say he encountered a hacker at lvl 16 reported him and then encountered him again at lvl64 seems like ubi does nothing unless many people know about it
---
He's so happy, his jaw fell off!
---
Why didn’t you kick him?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/rainbow6/comments/a5230q/_/
---
You made these??
---
Why not just ads?
---
Bro, it’s a meme, chill out lol
---
I mean yes she definitely would be a little op but I would rather have a really good IQ man destroying me than an invisible one
---
LATAM would like to speak with you
---
I'm solo queue Gold II
---
Newer player: reinforces wrong wall
---
Mira:
---
No, its just suprise copying.
---
I don’t think so... they didn’t actually call them John Wick and Star Lord IIRC, so I assume they were just ripoffs
---
The diamonds aren’t good enough to play against other diamonds because they got carried
---
Once again, its not Ubis fault that OP had that poor hot registration, its because of OPs wifi. Although you cant buy a wireless connection, you could... idk maybe just buy a better router, make sure there are no water pipes between your console/pc and the router(Unless ur on ethernet) and try to get an ethernet connection?
---
Fair point, you can kill a good IQ but not an invisible one.
---
It was like that for me yesterday but not my mate.  After an app restart mine was fine too.  Must be some sort of bug
---
You all play solo? Cuz I've never seen videos with discord background noise
---
This meme is to cheesy for me
---
I once accidently downed a teamate going for a drone. The player on the drone saw everything.
---
Also, when you join an 0-2 only to get TK'd immediately when the round starts.

moving side to side like targets at a carnival

Probably still trying to fix clash and shields
---
A hero we didn't deserve, but the one we needed
---
The skins were made for special modes in partnership with the respective companies.
---
Who?
---
That banning isn't reliable though. Seriously, I've seen that system in MC kick in from just standing still.
---
Hello ndetro, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c5a0vn/audio_bug_sound_is_inverted_and_mono_during_a/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If it's only a problem for shitty players then why was he banned in pro-league for so long? He fundamentally breaks the game by having a global ability, and having a very low risk-high reward gadget.
---
Yup happened to me too. It’s shit
---
Now I know why the color is different all the time, thanks
---
Chanka got the yeezy game going tho daaamn haha
---
Did you not notice that he got nerfed? 
---
Fundamentally... stand still. 
---
If you need to move out of the way of bullets, a GOOD enemy team already knows your position which renders his ability useless.
---
Ok I just looked it up. The ones I was referring to were from season 3 and were ripoffs, but they also recently did licensing deals for legitimate John Wick and Star Lord skins. Misunderstanding
---
No player facing changes, just infrastructure maintenance
---
Ah, interresting. Never thought about it that way.
---
CCTV
---
Smoke elite will be hard to beat that headgear
---
Big brother is watching
---
I was playing and it legit took an entire mag to kill maestro. And the best part is I didn’t kill him he was downed 😂
---
when i posted, it wasnt there, i checked, or im blind
---
Do you think the console edition is different from the PC edition or somethhing?
---
I did some digging and found out why. At the start of each season a confidence level is assigned to each person(833). That means the system is 90% sure that you’re +- 833 elo from your starting elo. As you play games that number goes up/down. The higher it is, the higher your elo gain/loss is.
---
Yep can relate , but two punishments because he shot me , and shot the drone I died chasing .
---
What indicates they were on WiFi?
---
Love it!
---
He was reworked actually. They changed his ping from a full body image to a ping, they deceased the spin up time, and gave him a third charge. He still does the same exact thing though. It's still a global ability that effects all defenders regardless of location.
---
I disagree with the jackal ban. Jackal doesn't do anything to affect the flow of a game.
---
Someone like Montagne, on the other hand, has to be played around every time he's picked.
---
Change your processor, is the only true fix for that problem....
---
dokkaebi was wondering why the phone number for those two were the same
---
An actual plausible gadget without nano-machines? Nice, hire this person.
---
why do you feel the need to post this now when the clip is from the april fools event?
---
People that play hundreds of game only get +3 sometimes lmao
---
Weird flex, but okay? Tachanka'S SMG is underrated tbh
---
Lmao that Ying was a bad ass.
---
Beenn like this for 8+ t hunts
---
TWOOOOMADD
---
BFV is great...the gunplay is fantastic
---
How about he tells me what he meant rather than you bitch
---
True! With her RED Mk III as well, she would be useful to be fair.
---
Meh The Pro skins never look good enough for me to really use them. Like the only 2 I ever really used was Monty as it doesn't matter if he sticks out, he's not a stealthy character and Maestro because he's got S*** all for cosmetics right now.
---
This just reminds me of when you're Mozzie, and you steal Twitch's shock drone, and then seek Twitch out and just continously shock her with it to see how she likes it.
---
Usually when this happens, the next week we get those special events, so maybe we'll get that bank robbery game mode soon?
---
Console is still fucked. More DDOS than ever, more MnK than ever, and there isn’t even any MMR return system for playing against these people. DDOS is cheating just like aimbot on PC is cheating—it’s just as unfair. Console never experienced the heavy hacker influx in Para Bellum, so this might actually be the worst season for console yet.
---
I am in silver lol. My friend is bronze tho
---
True, although only really great for ranged fire though, I guess he could go in with his Smoke Grenades and his Pistol maybe?! Depends on the location really.
---
I wanna dance with recruit tbh
---
“To further simulate in-game realism, we’re now adding a virtual delivery service for Alpha Packs. Upon receiving an Alfa Pack, you will now have to wait 1 to 2 business days until your order is processed and a courier is assigned”
---
Now that you mention it, Either I don’t play enough BB (he too slow) or after 2k hours I’ve not heard his voice. 
---
I feel the next I play him that’s all I’ll be thinking of
---
I’d rather hibanna elite instead of all these dumb memes! What happen to the time when this sub reddit was more about game play instead all the stuff that’s on here now.
---
*How to increase the range of Mute's Jammers*
---
Lion or Blitz.
---
Lion because I admire him so.
---
And Blitz because, well, he could just blind the fuck out of all the enemies and I could just walk myself out.
---
Real shit, though. Is that an elite in BF V?
---
Plague doctor needs to be it
---
anywhere above platinum, and MnKers and in gold and above. Dont act like PC is the only platform with cheaters.
---
Lord Chanka
---
I guess everyone has the same friends huh?
---
Hold up...
---
Reinstall your graphics drivers.
---
It's a new map, on th bright side it has more content than phantom sight
---
You're Mute so it's not that bad. Thicc French bois on the other hand...
---
&gt;so maybe we'll get that bank robbery game mode soon?
---
Elaborate... PLEASE!!!
---
Can't wait for clash to be added back only to be removed.
---
Lion would be pretty cool, spotting movements from enemies would be useful to be fair.
---
Blitz, well yeah, you said it perfectly LUL xD
---
Well imagine you can’t play siege in general cause of your load times take two long that that’s happening to me currently
---
IQ vas never been banned
---
Nope but I’m pretty sure Ubisoft still considers mouse and keyboard cheating on console.
---
Cool
---
"No ban"
---
Don't we all....
---
Caviera
---
yah who tf plays on wifi lol
---
Epic gamer moment :^ )
---
Sounds like a waste of a bulletproof cam to me.
---
He team-kills his teammates to help his own hostage! 500IQ play!
---
Capitão. He’s done this before.
---
I play on Xbox so the sensitivity is a lot different
---
I will day that the common wisdom that “hardware bans don’t work” isn’t all that true. Overwatch has been using it to great success, most notably a year or two ago when they hardware banned an infamous griefer who had ruined several thousand diamond+ tier matches across several accounts.
---
Clash isn't an "important" op. I reckon she will come back next season and dep shields will be removed
---
My exact thoughts
---
She a defender though, I guess she could betray her fellow teammates to save you xD
---
Next season is the word on the street
---
Name DOES NOT check out! Lol
---
Why are you using the worst primary gun in game?
---
Wait....
---
Trueeeee! Experience is key! :D
---
The one thing that’ll stop me from entering Objective is seeing this guy squatting there
---
You just have bad aim /s
---
Yes of course, that is what I had in mind...  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I see... xD
---
Can someone tell me why she is autobanned? Just started playing RB6 casually again
---
Thank you
---
I honestly like the rioter aesthetic, only complaint I have are the weapon skins and the mask, change the mask and the weapon skins and we’ve got a pretty good elite
---
holy fuck this. I HATE the new mode but wouldnt mind it if it was a seperate thing. I really dont like the fact you are stuck playing 3 attack or defense rounds since more often than not you end up getting fucked or just dominating them making most games just be 0-4 or 4-0 because if you lose all 3 then lol goodbye moral but if you win its like lol fuck their moral. Plus, yeah I am not a pro league player and have no desire to be. In fact I would love to see Ubi tell us why it wasnt a separate mode. Ranked was just fine the way it was. Eh, well as a more intense casual that is.
---
Fucking tower. It’s so ass
---
Here is the youtube version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHti_9FdB_E

He inspects it if you hold it for a while
---
Ehh. I never sit there saying “shit I wish my optics were different colored” 
---
A colorblind adjustment is one thing, but personally I find them fine
---
If you enjoy multiplayer games that are tactical, then absolutely! I have over 700+ hours and loved it when I played. Much more fun with friends vs. random.
---
You can join the R6 discord if you wish to find a group :)
---
Thanks!
---
Ikr...but you could do it so, that you can change this in the settings, no?
---
Buy it- one of the best games I've played in years,it can get quite buggy occasionally though
---
I was drawing it while i was seeing it on google i dont know who the artist was but yeah i needed to go buy colours and pencils etc i dont claim that i DREW this i just found it and drew ot from google sorry if i offended anyone i can delete the post no problem!
---
Oh, ok
---
Good to know Dou!
---
mistakes made
---
I would give you silver if I wasn't illogically poor
---
M - V - P
---
you shouldnt be abel to queue if someone is more than 4 sub leagues away from your current rank. Like, bronze 4 can queue with copper4-silver4. Fuck this copper 4 and plat nonsense.
---
Tower because of how many rush spots there are
---
Bugs come with the territory, especially if Ubisoft is involved. Least they get fixed or aren't too terrible - unlike some un-named companies heh.
---
Oh I see what you are saying. You can choose to enable PiP.
---
Glitch in game allows her to shoot through her shield and it was being abused so rather than fixing it the devs just have her removed until they get around to fixing it
---
Yeah...but the white color looks better on some skins too and just for the personalization...
---
this is what passes for quality content nowadays? A number?
---
Leaked operator icon in the centre omg!
---
If you ban blitz you’re a silver Monty’s op
---
this sub is just amazing lmao anytime something new is added that’s a little different, everyone says it’s censorship. people complained about the lesion elite not having skulls and now this. just incredible
---
Yes...or is that too difficult to make?
---
That is a real gun. Its the browning mk1
---
Welcome to rainbow six siege, how can we help you?
---
Can we interest you in the non existent hit reg?
---
What about game breaking bugs?
---
Maybe some blatant hackers?
---
The last big team-game I played was Overwatch. Skipped CSGO because I can't deal with guns that don't function like a gun should (bullets shooting straight rather than in weird S and T patterns). I swear I'm a minority of people who hate that game.
---
Still, I've always liked enjoying a good tactical game, ain't got a friend in the world to play R6 with though! I'll consider it! I just wanted to make sure about this whole "buying characters" business.. I have no clue what all that is about, don't want some microtransactions ruining my life ya know?
---
I don't think that would be hard at all. I've seen many games do this.
---
Made in Montreal
---
1997-2017.
---
then why bother? You are basically just humble bragging here.
---
I actually hated the old white holo. And I get what your saying, I’m just respectfully disagreeing. This game has so much to change and tweak, the sight colors just doesn’t feel necessary to me.
---
Apparently age and skill level correlate to the validity of my opinion.
---
I'm usually Plat 2 or Plat 1, I've been playing for 3 years now, but I think Ranked is fine.
---
And it would look great...letz say Ubi about that
---
Yes ok... you're right...
---
Looks like im taking this down
---
Won’t last too long sadly. Imma get a water cooler for nothing other than big dick energy 😛
---
Think about it, you’ll come up with your own answers

Flash cards for the maps😂helps a lot 
---
Also varsitygaming has 40 minute map guides that help a lot, he shows good ways to attack and defend
---
some weebs just want to watch the world burn
---
When you need better wifi
---
The guy that got shocked was recruit I thought it was rook lol
---
It scans on an app I have but doesn't seem to produce any results.  Could just be the app I have though.  Either way, based on what it say's, seems to be a nod to the Ubisoft Montreal team.
---
I didn't say that this is indeed censorship, I asked if this is censorship, and if not, what else.  
---
I mean her hat is indeed censored, but it could be that they changed their mind on the cap having "FBI" written on it and they just didn't want to redo the trailer.  
---
Read more carefully.
---
Yes and it can be shot
---
Can you buy them with credits
---
I wish i could relate to this...
---
I’m not right, just a different view 😊
---
Me, an itellectual, bans Twitch to see the world burn.
---
actually it does, more than you think. For you see, if you abuse the ranked system for your own benefit obviously you will think it is fine. Plus, playing in plat means you are getting to play the real game so that also factors into many things which would cause you to call it "fine".
---
you are a legend!
---
Totally. All the characters can be unlocked with playtime pretty quickly. I never spent a dime and unlocked them all.
---
It’s nice it’s takes a little bit of time because it always you to learn the original operators that are originally given to you, since each operator is different. The newer ones get more complicated, so it takes a little experience to use them to their full potential :) totally worth $10!
---
Just a heads up, rainbow is a shooter that’s easier to get used to by playing slow and holding angles. Keep running in and you might get tired of dying quite soon
---
One cuz I have 0 self control
---
Nah cuz u can like play scenarios while u wait
---
Ok... your view is better than mine ;)
---
Based on what I just saw I am going to have to say that it most likely fell through the floor, I’ve never known his EMP’s to be destructible. If they could be destroyed I’d imagine they’d disappear when touching an electric wall as well 
---
I could be wrong and it could’ve just been blown up, I’m not sure
---
Then start banning strategically instead of troll banning. Dont be part of the problem; solve it.
---
Literally any time you down someone
---
FINISH THEM!!!
---
And at the start of each season u have to download like 50gb again
---
It’s Bc they team killed and were toxic for no reason. That’s the point lol.
---
I got pretty lucky with this clip. Timed it right with the Lion getting distracted by his scan's wubwubs.
---
The Browning Hi-Power, the MK1 is just a Canadian copy
---
Grim Sky and Chimera were both much worse.
---
It’s a connection issue, not hitreg.  You can see the yellow indicator in the corner indicating a lagging connection.
---
At launch the full price wasn’t really justified cuz it was short on content. Now it has double the playable classes and way more maps. If you’re into multiplayer shooters,  it’s worth the full price  now. 
---
Now the only negatives are the micro transactions
---
Do you use a potato for your WiFi?
---
Yeah there is, you just don't do it. You don't die. Be good at the game and you won't die by not doing so.
---
I got mine yesterday🤙
---
Turtle spins are life in 1v1
---
oh i did read your post. you can look at the hat and see that having FBI on it wouldn’t look right. it’s just funny that you people bring up censoring for China the second something is different.
---
I have the same issue but I'm on wifi 5gz
---
"Get the downvotes in 'ere, bois! We've got another one!"
---
I think it got easier In phantom sight
---

Hate it
---
Probably either casual or below gold 4.
---
If you don't play siege with a vertical monitor, you're not a pro gamer.
---
&gt;180*
---
Siege is wayy more addicting than the division imo
---
Thermite and other hard breaches a while ago collectively had negative wind deltas. Does that mean we should stop picking them? Win delta doesn't prove much in uncoordinated situations like ranked.
---
That makes no sense. It's just a blowtorch
---
That shit is legendary xD
---
Or just the ability to terrorist hunt while you’re queued would be nice
---
Great, more kiddos running hacks, yeah !
---
Naw bro you just capitao
---
Will the fact that I’m on console affect that? I’m not great at first-person shooters but I’ve always enjoyed them
---
Ff
---
Only 400 hours. Pussy shit
---
I wonder if Ubi will rethink echo's abilities.  Along w/ cav and blitz.  three of which have a near 100% chance of getting banned.  It may prove that these ops are OP.
---
Yeah nerfing a strong operator and buffing a weak one is totally pointless. Amazing logic.
---
Fucking hell I would leave too
---
AND WHAT DO BLOWTORCHES HAVE? nothing that could be stopped by a mute jammer lmao.
---
Block 100
---
Were you using Frost? Her Inglis never seemed to have the cap Bucks does.
---
Hello Pascalini, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c5dkfx/game_crashing_on_xbox/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
As an echo main
---
It feels bad man.
---
You could try lowering your dpi or sensitivity in game for the shakiness.
---
Also what are your pc specs?
---
The poor guy just wanted a epic kill
---
That's my point. How would a mute jammer stop it.
---
No
---
I like how you instantly thought of it as a dab, and not a stupid glitch. We're doing good as a species so far, I'm proud
---
Obviously it'd jam the flame
---
My gamer tag is AshJagerAcog797
---
Those thicc operators wouldn't fit on a vertical monitor.
---
let's do this.
---
To me, that doesn't look like boosting.  More likely you have some friends of varying skill who don't always play in the same 5-stack.  I don't really see a problem with a silver or a plat playing against golds (the two known ranks on the other team).
---
Compare that to the team I ran into last night--1 plat, 2 coppers and 2 bronzes (with 2 of the low ranks obvious smurfs).
---
Yeah, since i started not too long ago i dont really have a selection of operators i can use efficiently the only ones i can use are Fuze and Montange on the attacking team and hostage kinda takes Fuze out of the picture. I only have a selection on defence when i can play as Frost, Kapkan, Rook/Doc or Pulse.
---
No it would break ur finger
---
It’s a tough game, but very fun and rewarding as you get better.
---
Busted out laughing great work man (I’m a mozzie main lol)
---
Ur right
---
Well it helped the health of the game though. Was really frustrating to have to play against blitz. Glad he is gone
---
I agree with the buff, its dumb that you use your gadget for a second and then you have to wait a full recharge.
---
Sure flashbangs are for attackers, but you could make an exception to the rule with warden (kinda like clash being a shield on defense or drones on def as mozzie)
---
Maverick doesn't need a nerd anyways
---
Well I mean there very different games it really depends on what you prefer. I personally love rainbow 6 seige and don't really find the division as captivating but its really up to you
---
Not gonna lie if im defense first i ban thatcher
---
suka
---
But that's not a pencil
---
So do lion and a bunch of things but it’s just the only counter that would make a little sense and he really needs one
---
Bith are very fun games but personally siege has the longer shelf life in the sense of i find myself coming back to siege constantly and haven't really played the division since i beat it
---
No he doesn't why tho
---
Tru but he uses his pistols a lot
---
Got a breach kill last night, first since the update, still resulted in cackling like a super villain
---
I started a week ago and have more than half the ops at this point, and I try to play them all in casual. Casual is all about experimenting with loadouts and guns.
---
Thanks. :)
---
Bfv players dont want it, seige players cant get it. XD 2019 games in a nutshell.
---
He's a great support.
---
I know but now I can't stop using it.
---
Added!
---
TaCHONK is evolving
---
going by maps in ranked id say probably hereford base
---
Congratulations your Nøkk evolved into Tachanka!
---
Lol that is definitely a woman if you played bfv you would know that. 😂
---
Maybe go over to pc master race. That sounds more your style
---
Too strong, I'd rather buff him a little bit before going in full turkey.
---
Ik that but he said 2-0 wich means match point....
---
This would be a problem if you played on a console
---
An operator with no counter is broken it’s been a topic since he has came out and is a big deal for higher ranks
---
I'm absolutely down!
---
Resident Vigil, at your service. They'll never see me coming 🔪
---
Moreover in general they are annoying. Blitz is pretty shit but banned just the same as is Cav. Really only lesion and echo are worth a look for balance reasons.
---
i cant stand skyscraper either
---
I don't see the issue: You left the building, so you got detected. Pretty standard stuff...
---
Currently, 1. I can’t help but open them. I’m trying to save up for 50 though so I can do an opening. It’s a grind...
---
This is so sweet, Alexa play you've got a friend in me
---
A really big fucking hug coming right up!
---
😂
---
Dang dude you're straight trash
---
caviera isn't OP, her pistol (mostly) sucks ass if the other person is aware of you, it also has the fastest damage drop-off of any gun. Caviera sucks even more when the team is co-ordinated, as she becomes extremely vulnerable during an interrogation.
---
U can shoot him through the hole
---
My theory for this is that because he is an annoying operator to fight, when people get killed by him they play him next round, this you get a lotta games played in jackal that aren't by people who frequently play him. I suspect that the win delta would be much higher if you only looked at people who played him reasonablely frequently.
---
There's no stopping him at this rate
---
Yes I know what he meant but in the post he said 0-2 wich is incorrect
---
Unfortunately it's not your pc and it's just you. I have a cpu sitting in top of 2 shot glasses on top of my psu aiming at my gpu whilst have a huge window fan blasting in my case to prevent my gpu which has no cooling fan from over heating. I can't hear because of all the noise but I still manage high plat every season.
---
Rammus? Hard CC fucks him pretty hard. As long as you don't straight up   I N T  into a yasuo he will be manageable.
---
Got the Legendary WOW charm twice in a row, nice.
---
I wish. I just switched and it was tough losing all my cosmetics
---
Apparently this one came out in 2007. I wonder what modern technology can produce now.
---
With every season comes more game breaking bugs. I’ve been getting this too; getting kicked out of games with this error.
---
Carefully, he's a hero
---
talk about how you conveniently left out the lag symbols you definitely had in the top right? yeah sure
---
lol? want me to show you it or what
---
It splattered blood behind him so you did hit, this game just robs good kills
---
For you aim:
---
Step 1: 400 DPI
---
Step 2: 50/83 ADS speed
---
Step 3: Find a good vertical/horizontal sens that feels good for you
---
Do the next steps after a bit of playing, so you can adjust your senses
---
Step 4: Find a better ADS speed. You can find out if you like lower or higher sens with step 2
---
Step 5: Get a better PC if you really need it. 
---
Getting a better mouse or keyboard or whatever doesn't make that much of a difference, but is nice to have. But imo you should upgrade your pc and your monitor to get 144HZ.
---
You can't get it anymore
---
Honestly, the only way to pretty much guarantee teaching platinum is to go into ranked as a 5 stack. Communication is non existent most of the time when you solo queue.
---
people who are good enough to stream don’t main operators
---
I will never understand the Cav ban as long as Maestro, Lesion, Mira, Pulse and Valk exist. Like, just drone her out and push. Take a Dokki or Lion if roam clear is that difficult, but she's SUCH a wasted ban.
---
gg ubi
---
EdIt: ThAnKs FoR SiLvEr!
---
Same here, and yet no one seemed to be talking about this.
---
Nope. I’m insane apparently and think Hereford is absolutely fine. Both that and Fortress are significantly better maps then the ones I said earlier.
---
obviously blitz just has a good gaming chair
---
I think it was a maintenance patch

\+1
---
I think he needs a different gun. An op needs a good gadget, good guns, or speed to be viable. Good ops have two and great ops have all three. Warden has none. It sucks because he is visually one of my favorite operators.
---
587 hours, wth?
---
Subbed!
---
Probs the lesion animation and his amazing shield :3 Best combo in game lol
---
Ok thanks
---
you will be able to buy them until 2 weeks after the new season launches :)!

Indeed
---
The diamond skin has nothing to do with the diamond rank
---
Yeah but it doesn’t matter that it’s a rare skin if it looks like literal shit smeared across a gun. If legendaries are so hard to get they should at least look nice
---
Imagine being so bad you ban Caveira lmao
---
Oh dam
---
Can't play rn, are the new elite skins out yet?
---
Probably that gaming dick
---
Not mine lmao, but that one is 90
---
Over the course of 7 months, and one day exactly
---
I'm in copper with diamond skin
---
Ah don’t worry, I’m still waiting for my Buck elite as well
---
Nah just a similar post, other one said it was a server error, this one was a matchmaking error.
---
R6+for honor
---
But steam summer sale is happening right now so you could spend the savings on cosmetics
---
Probably preparing for the summer event.
---
Got Mozzie yesterday and I had so much fun playing him today, can only recommend
---
lol
---
And after he picks up the sword he raises it as the He-Man does.
---
This
---
Over the course of 7 months and one day, I play for about 6-14 hours a day
---
Avoid soloQ
---
That is tempting
---
Sadly, there is nothing you can do. Players who DDOS servers can't get banned either.
---
This art is fantastic, cheer up, draw more, because your good at it. Meet up with some friends, and remember people care about you.
---
Stupid question what is the red triangle thing
---
Pro league I think
---
Or one of the new universal skins
---
Open up to someone. Its good to talk. Its the internet, there are people who want to help.
---
Let me tell you kid I have black ice for Buck's c8, Frost's c1, the jtf2 pistol, the SAS assault rifle and twitch's f2 
---
I'm the biggest black ice flexer of all time
---
Lesion does not have infinite GU mines. He can have a maximum of 8, and that's if the round stretches out for more than 2 minutes.
---
Yeah the judge is pretty awesome
---
Oh you were talking about primary oh ooooohh
---
I ways play with 5 people from discord.
---
Get ready to lose a bunch of karma homie
---
Don't quote me on this, but I don't think you can
---
lmao same, i was gold 2 as well, but i got matched with a bunch if shitters after the 10 prelim rounds and now im a struggling silver 3
---
I was suprised the kegs angle was 45 degrees. It was perfect for this. Turrets and valk cams can atleaste shift. This is direct focus for a character for information gathering like cav or vigil.
---
What's the benefit of doing this?
---
Way to go, faces are brutal. 
---
But it looks like Flanders so you’re solid !
---
It‘s reverse friendly fire. If u kill a teammate reverse friendly fire is on for you. You then get the damage u deal to your teammates.
---
Good analogy that makes sense
---
Ah ok
---
It’s just siege being it’s self
---
Dude it’s been like this since Blood Orchid, it’s not ruining anything, it is Siege. You work around the chucklefucks.
---
I think his point is if you play that often, how are you barely reaching level 100
---
No, just picked a random number.
---
Lmao montagne nodding his head at the end
---
If she's related to Ela or Zofia I guess it's okay. Kinda useless story there since there's already a separate story going on with them, Ela being a decent part of it. But I feel like this isn't needed.
---
I never knew you could vault through that window up there. I knew you could get on the shelf but not through the window.
---
sWeAtYy
---
Oof
---
there is basically no advantage to ADSing with the FO-12, it actually hinders you more because of the high ass recoil
---
For every hundred times I’m teamkilled, it’s these moments that make this game fun to come back to
---
You went Ant-Man on them
---
This is what happened. I joined at 0-2 pick phase.
---
The only defenders that can use ACOGs are 3 armor defenders and not all of them can, just specific ones, and we are unlikely to get anymore in the future
---
Because recruit is too intimidating for the ranked players.
---
I have encountered this a lot lately
---
Rook and Doc have acogs. Those are all I know. Btw some guns have acogs and some operators have acogs.
---
And then you win because their Fuze killed the hostage
---
Restart your computer
---
Oh, I thought it was distributed denial of service because the person is using more than one computer to flood the connection?
---
Echo, and Kaid have them too
---
Here is the youtube version of my panic spray: https://youtu.be/6hQpC8JNC70
---
Deluxe edition is $12 right now
---
I’ve done that too. Doesn’t change anything. Updated my drivers as well. Still nothing.
---
Maybe lag?

Sorry for being a cunt but still, stop seeking attention ok? Just get your shit together cause at the end of the day I dont even know you and dont care... and people who still think they care apart from the people who know him, you dont

I don't think it's ddosing. I think it's servers. I've had this happen in cas so often and usually one or two people on my team and one on theirs is fine, everyone else is frozen in place.
---
I could buy it but it looks like shit ever since a graphical update that came with vigils release. They look scuffed and more plastic than be4 where they were very shiny and bright by they I am also talking about amathyst and emerald etc skins
---
Nothing happened
---
Ill have to go look it up again, because that may also exist.
---
It's not about how strong her guns or interrogation is. It's the fact you have to literally play differently with her on the map.
---
Oof i play secure and bomb
---
Just gotta deal with it for now I guess, doubt it will get fixed knowing ubi, I can’t play ranked anymore due to it so I’m stuck at Plat 3
---
No, it can't.
---
Echo and Maestro  have Acogs aswell
---
K
---
Flower round is custom designed rounds to shoot through reinforced wall. M500 eill be too OP.
---
As a Cav main. Why? God, Why? Will I ever get to play caveira again? I wasted how many V bucks on a banned op. :(
---
If we take into account that you're using a 1x sight and hitting headshots, you really don't prove anything at all with this video. The problem with the AK-74 is that it has a lot of recoil (which of course is only noticeable if you use an ACOG with it) and very low damage output (which again doesn't matter if you hit your headshots). I understand that you like the weapon, I do too but saying that it's good just isn't correct.
---
What are they made of?
---
Yeah, kinda gay tbh.
---
That actually might work
---
Good, it's year 4, they've finally learned not to release overpowered operators and actually test them properly before going live.
---
You will barely feel any recoil
---
Don't bother, it doesn't even look good on most guns.
---
100k thrown away.
---
I hear that, everything is about perspective 👍
---
Can we get an f in chat for mozzie?
---
Bruh it’s literally a connection issue...
---
No girl would hug a man with a laser sight
---
the defenders dont make sense to me. kaid, bandit, mute, lesion, mira, jaeger all make more sense than cav.
---
Respect
---
Why name something diamond (like the rank) when it doesn't look like diamond.
---
Mmh. **GOOD.**
---
So many 20 IQ people on this post, it’s literally a connection issue, you can see the symbol in the top right ffs
---
Sauce?

Why can WE get a 20 man squad on attack?

Hijacking the top comment to say please if you would go subscribe to my YouTube channel! I plan on making tons of gaming videos and lets plays, and It would just make me so incredibly happy if you did![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H46Qrd9GKA8&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H46Qrd9GKA8&amp;feature=youtu.be) Thank you :)

Can some do the whole team rocker moto please I’m to lazy
---
If u were gold one, and kept losing to the point that u were in silver 1, do u really deserve the rank u were at?
---
What , you're not liking how I'm giving my opinion on hitscan choices ?
---
And btw nothing against the employees this had a bit of sarcasm so hit the brakes
---
Mmm I hope its borcht
---
I
---
All 4 sites on consulate is extremely defendable.
---
Visa and lobby holds just need vertical gameplay a lot more than the other 2 sites.
---
Wholesome!
---
It's doesn't jump but can it break through things like it's made of lead?
---
As a regular lesion player, I'm glad there are not many intellectuals in silver.
---
Hitscan is horrible , it's not latency friendly , and no I'm not hating the employees , again I'm just judging choices
---
A large part of blackbeard’s head hitbox peeks over his shield
---
Nope , just criticism
---
It's an fps game, so m+kb will have a higher skill ceiling and be more accurate (more precise movement). It's why people use 3rd party adapters to use m+kb with consoles, it gives them an advantage over everyone else.
---
You can share the video to Reddit, like you would email a link or video to someone
---
I play plat, and get cav banned all the time still...
---
...you must be new here
---
I feel this on a personal level was one game off of plat ll than played two games against hackers got ddos’d twice and went on a losing streak all the way to gold 3. The life of a solo queuer
---
Ok - well, for what its worth hitscan would be a terrible idea for a multitude of reasons and would absolutely be more buggy than hitscan.
---
Nice
---
I think hes just the better player
---
I like it more than the russian SMGs. The recoil seems easier to handle but I'm on console so that might make a difference.
---
Yup. People like to pretend that these problems don’t exist and continue to defend the game. I don’t think a sequel is needed really but instead a MAJOR fix like one or two seasons dedicated to restoring the game and making it playable. I don’t care if we don’t get content as long as it makes the game enjoyable again.
---
But that's not too much of a concern when playing casual.
---
A projectile system is totally pointless in a game as up-close as Siege. Leading targets and compensating for drop would never be a meaningful part of the game, you just would never need to do them. And as a result of dropping the simpler hitscan method...
---
With how spotty netcode can already be with all the destruction in this game, add in projectile bullets and things get worse. Trades (which really shouldn't happen in hitscan) become way more common. The "your shot always lands on your reticle" aspect of Siege's gunplay is gone.
---
Faccs
---
That won't stop people from doing it, also the glitches come and go with each season so. In all reality people just need to stop exploiting them all together so it wouldn't even be a problem. We all know that's not going to happen so yes maybe they could go about it differently but it could also be the best way to do it.
---
I never realized the visual similarities between the nerf rivals guns and the fmg-9
---
Because that’s what heroes do
---
3 years of saving finally got level 75 lets go
---
It’s out of control this season
---
May I ask what the fuck
---
Notasmurf69420
---
Look buddy I don’t think you understand. It’s not about somebody not being nice to me in a video game. It’s about how that affects the environment of the game and makes it really toxic.
---
I main Echo so I HATE his ban. Mira obviously makes sense because she’s ridiculously useful at completely cutting off a push, and Lesion and Valk are so easy to play it’s just “I throw my gadget and sit in a corner lol” but Echo takes serious skill to be properly effective. What good is drunking someone with a Yokai if nobody can capitalize? People ban him because he’s always banned in PL, but those people know what they’re doing. Low ranks just spam ping and stun everyone in the first thirty seconds or throw them in random, useless spots.

Hello AnonymPingvin, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c5hcwm/sound_issue_since_latest_patch_in_game_sound/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
i think i’ll take that one if it’s available
---
&gt; what if there was a system to identify known game breaking glitches such as the iq glitch
---
..if a ingame system can detect a glitch, the devs need to know the glitch and detect it so they can tech the system. If they can do all of that majority of these glitches can be fixed will before updating the detection system. 
---
This is a extremely advance system that doesnt add much into the system. If they have a system that can detect anomalies like ingame glitches, their anti hacking solution will be magical.
---
Don't add a drop off , make the projectiles at a very high speed , might sound pointless but it'll solve the latency issues and unfair shots , I'm not here to mock , but you can simulate the same thing but make it more latency friendly and it's easily thought of , but hey I'm just someone with criticism , typical for reddit to bash people like me .
---
WEU? Very possible lol, I have about 900 hours in-game time.
---
Nice lol
---
u/Eduboy25
---
Yeah, I was a bit surprised when I looked at it and and fmg-9, and saw they looked nearly the same
---
Exactly I just use p12 when blitz it's a great gun
---
dont mean to be rude in any way but the person who just died can make that call out themselvs
---
I'm not bashing you, I'm bashing your idea. Projectile systems come with more latency than hitscan systems as an inherent property of their design. Projectiles taoe time to travel and additional calculations to perform. Hitscan does not.
---
? Alright buddy.. says the guy who cant aim for heads. And complains when he doesnt get a kill. oh! And the guy who cant see a C4. Lmfao fuck off. You call everyone bad when you're the one bitching about minor shit because you cant stand being outplayed. How very sad
