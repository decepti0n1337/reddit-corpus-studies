Is it because of the skull that is usually on Cav's face?

Ah, nothing like good ol' grandpa and grandson time. I'm so jealous.
---
You too, I‚Äôve got a video I‚Äôm trying to post but it‚Äôs taking an arm and a leg to do so. BAN IQ EVERYTIME
---
Guess I have to say it here now too.  I'm not sure that this would work out. Even if he's bad at aiming, he'd still be reported for aimbotting.
---
Imagine if you could actually shoot through his stomach.
---
You should be able to attach your cameras to drones change my mind.
---
You'll never stop me from wishing these things :(
---
Odds are you'll get it next time you launch the game.
---
Yeah we started banning IQ after that even though we knew that glitch was available but we didn‚Äôt think players would take advantage of it and be toxic
---
Hopefully haha
---
Zof's AR is pretty solid, I typically run a suppressor on it and it still 3 shots, and has pretty manageable recoil. (Personally I'd say it's about on par with IQs AUG or Twitch's F2)
---

---
I dont use her LMG near as much, but it's an LMG so it's suppression with 150 mag size is a big plus. Does more damage than her AR at the expense of RPM but you can run an ACOG on it too.
---
Her utility is pretty average, her impacts on her gadget are always hit or miss for me, I mostly use them for soft breaching or destroying gadgets, but if you can manage to land her concussions they're potent. 
---
She also has the advantage(?) of being able to get up from DBNO (like Doc) but with only 5 health by holding X/Square/whatever PC uses
---
There should be some sort of mechanic where people with mics are matched together more often.
---
Bruh
---
I don‚Äôt normally complain and I am normally able to hold my own with a positive K/D. But this one experience made me piping hot.
---
Ive found more clips and it looks like you somehow take the height of the drone and move around as if you some how were able to phantom through the floor whike traveling on your drone but still being an operstor.
---
They wont get banned for glitching, ou wont get your mmr back since its not cheating (external assist) but using a glitch in game and the exploit wont get fixed untill its replicated multiple times/reported so best case next mid season release. 
---
Report it to [ubi support](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Cases/new?template=R6CheatReportPC) 
---
If you know how to reproduce it report it with steps on the[ bug tracker site for r6](https://r6fix.ubi.com/)s (its a official site not 3rd party) 
---
And if you just have videos with the bug twitter it to the rainbow6 pages and famous streamers.
---
Doesn't make it worse that I have black ice for all the original ops at 231
---
Maybe a little to distracting seeing those colours flash up on your screen. If they actually implement it they should add a setting for the transparency of the icon.
---
I'm kinda salty and im just gonna resort to doing it myself. If ubisoft won't fix things even after ive tried to get it fixed and provide them with proof, im gonna get my elo back my own way.
---
Best i can hope for is this goes crazy big and ubi finally pays attention to it.
---
Could make it so that after the maps have been voted on each team gets to veto one
---
Exactly!
---
Point being it doesn't have to be...
---
Since when can you hack on Xbox
---
Yeah true but I love his AR

I‚Äôd go for Maverick, he‚Äôs a silent breather with really good primaries

That‚Äôs just console. I mean, it happens on of, but not as much (at least at my skill level) most toxic people are ridiculed by the whole match, both teams don‚Äôt like it, at least in most cases I‚Äôve witnessed. I played on console awhile ago, last time I touched my PS4 for siege was December I believe. It was really toxic, and I can only imagine how it‚Äôs gotten.

Time to wait for more DLC :(

This game kills itself

If you aren‚Äôt fragging or holding a angle holo is infinity more better and will like beet out a agoc in a fire fight it‚Äôs only fraggers or angles is when you should use a agoc agocs if your not in pro league kinda suck to be honest people think they will automatically get headshots by hip firing beacuse agocs get so much hype I only use them on Zofia rook and echo really never anyone else unless my friend goes thermite or hibban and goes shotty then I use a agoc but yeah
---
This w o r r i e s me
---
wow that really cool
---
Most definitely. But a operator like J√§ger that can block Cap‚Äôs bolts and Nomads air jabs would help counter.

Wouldn't it be made by EA though? I feel like they would just ruin the idea.

I haven't played console rainbow in a long time as I made the switch to PC, but I believe I used to be on 40-50 or something but I could be wrong. It's all about preference so if the current sens suits u and ur doing well on it then props to u. Just seemed a bit slow and seemed as if u wouldn't be able to quickly turn around and have a chance if someone was behind u but I could be wrong.

He just needs to accept his mistakes, or accept that other players are good enough to hit head shots. He ain‚Äôt in the pro league, he doesn‚Äôt have to pretend his play is lol

I still love Fuzzy (yes, ‚ÄúFuzzy‚Äù). He‚Äôs one of my first picks on maps where he‚Äôs still useful. Not so much on Yacht, Tower, Dostoyevsky, Plane, etc. Glad to see someone else is using him. üëç

Just make the aim along with the movement just complete shit, as to stay with the movies and to balance it out.
---
Yeah, Fairfight does absolutely nothing on console.
---
Now that‚Äôs a drone.. In your face Twitch!
---
I main her, looks great. Even though she's one of the worst operators in game now she's till drawn beautifully.  Also samsung is, better in some areas.
---
Thats not even close to what im talking about... run outs and spawn peeks coupled with ash rushes and blitz attacking every round... EVERY ROUND...
---
I can hear "what a save" from rocket league
---
This operator would slap, would main this
---
Yeah, I keep telling the elf that lives in my Xbox to ban these knowers but he never does anything
---
Yikes
---
Ash main huh... figures :P
---
I don't know man, I stay out of ranked because every meme about ranked sounds like a dystopia.

Aw, man, I just got my Claymores back and now assholes wanna abuse them so they take them away again and let defenders run out like crazy.

Had a buddy like this. I honestly use stuff like we'll get him next time big guy. And follow him next round, I'm a monty/blizt offense main. So it helps a lot when he has a mobile fortress helping.

Yeah that is playing the game. But it is also sweating while playing the game. If you are going all out trying to win I‚Äôm casual, then that is sweating. People play casual to relax and have fun. We can play ranked if we wanted to face sweats. That is why there is a game mode called casual (read casual to yourself and then determine if one should sweat in a mode called casual). Then there is ranked which is made for all the sweating one can produce.
---
Why do you think there are separate modes to begin with?
---
Who's the scary bitch now?
---
They don't make 'em like they do in Texas.
---
Sounds like something a tryhard would say
---
Mhmm
---
Shes really not, just scary as fuck, I bet by next season there will be a counter

Ubisoft can fix this for the 0.00000000000000001% of autistic people who use Maverick Ironsights, or they can fix clipping, sprint bugs, acog misalignments, poor map layouts, smurf accounts, ping abusers, more rampant team killing or ash which effects... 100% of players
---
Jesus man if you can't say anything nice in you sorry little life then don't say anything at all. It's not my fault you bad at the game, go back to casual with your mates and keep your mouth shut if you're too bad to get a good rank. Don't try to put other's accomplishments down just because you yourself can't achieve any, we have fun climbing through the ranks and having a sense of accomplishment wich you will never have in you sorry life.
---
Ok so trying to win = sweating.
---
Here's something: try to do whatever you enjoy. If you like going for kills, do it. If you enjoy playing obj and being a team player, do it. If you enjoy something, just do it and everything will follow suit. You might even get to the point of 20 kills per game, who knows.
---
No.
---
Trying to win while while acting like it‚Äôs PL finals= sweating .
---
Sadly he only detects the running sound.
---
What the fuck
---
"Gold ranks" bruh... i dont play ranked... i play casual. And as for the predictable bs you mentioned: there more than one window on a map... its a one sided game of whack-a-mole.

Might as well not try to win so players like you can "have fun" by ruining my warm up.

I'm surprised every time a post like this reaches the front page. Am i supposed to not try to win because you want to fuck around?
---
SPAGHETTI CODE YAY
---
Ah, you seem to have misunderstood OP. You see, he only has fun when he wins. So, when the other team tries to win, they're inherently trying to ruin OP's enjoyment of the game, which is very inconsiderate (aka sweaty, tryharding, etc).  
---
  
---
Always remember to throw the game for the other team so that they can have fun and win. That's what you'd want to do anyways, right? Unless you're some sweaty tryhard, of course.
---
there‚Äôs no hackers on console lol

He‚Äôs not hacking lol

"A blank canvas built for editing"
---
its just as effective
---
Tk'd as thatcher... idk about that one... but as for the rest: practice is good in casual, practice aim, learn new drone spots, have fun with it. but dont be spawn peeking or doing run-outs... they just make the game un-fun.
---
Now this is why I dont play ranked
---
I was in the same boat but met a group of really great guys through it, they‚Äôre some of my best friends now. Obviously everyone has different experiences but in just saying don‚Äôt be afraid to make the switch because in my experience it has all been amazing

---
Accomplishments? Are you serious...? Platinum in rainbow6 and you call that an Accomplishment? Also wasn't directed to you, more diamond players cause it's not that hard to get into plat.
---
And that would be noticeably distracting causing you to be seen more. Especially on someone like n√∏kk who‚Äôs main focus is to be stealthy
---
We trade the Blitz ban (because the enemy always bans Jackal) for a BB or Monty ban. One game we let BB play because our randoms wanted him and the enemy used BB and got 17 kills. Our randoms didnt even get a kill with him.. :(.
---
More realistic meme would be "Better player not trying" and the soldier about to get clubbed slammed says, "Worse player trying his ass off."
---
Thanks for proving me right
---
No I mean the gadget he is proposing
---
which parts of the gear specifically? I can try linking some, but do note that most of my Nokk gear are highly customized, specially her camo, coz alot of her gear either does not exist in real life, or are far too expensive for me to purchase in our country.

If you are playing an anchor role such as doc, rook, Mira, (virtually all 1-speed ops) then you usually stay and sit on objective and can go on cams to find out where the enemies are pushing from at the beginning of the round to help your roamers. For 3-speed ops, you‚Äôll usually be roaming, so by playing more you‚Äôll naturally gain better map knowledge and game sense for where the attackers will come in and you can either try to get a frag off or sit in a corner away from the obj and go for the late round flank. My personally favorite way to get better is by watching streamers and copying what they do in a round with certain operators. Good luck!
---
Let me put this into some form of perspective. If you (at least attempt to): drop shot often, crouch spam, lean spam, rush every round, run-out for spawn kills, spawnpeek, ect of that nature in casual... you are a sweaty tryhard. Practice for ranked all you want, practice your aim or find new angles, just dont ruin the experience for the people just playing for fun.
---
Looks like Forsen.
---
Same, I like the randomized maps, if they really want this why not put it in ranked. I could see ranked players caring more than I do.
---
His elite skin should be themed Fenway Park (Big Green Giant) replete with a Red Sox hat, Pats hoodie (sleeves cut off like Belichick), a Bruins goalie mask and green Celtics sweat pants. Don't forget the clam chowder stains on his hoodie.
---
But are the casuals actually having fun?
---
Exactly, so why have outbreak alien bullshit. And Why can‚Äôt a tactical shooter have body damage? Rockstar put body damage in red dead 2.
---
If the enemy player got 17 kills then no matter whether BB was banned or not you were not likely to have a good time haha.
---
When I play casual I don't care what map it is, I like it being a random map.
---
Regardless of who it is directed to, people put their precious time into this game so they feel good about themself for being above average per say. even if reaching plat is "not that hard" ,for some people it is and when they finally accomplish that they have the rights to feel good about himself. Even if diamonds are toxic cant you just let them enjoy themselves?
---
Find operators that you are comfortable with and certain operators serve different purposes. 
---
Three armor - stay in room
---
Two armor - can roam 
---
1 armor - are roamers
---
Also if you‚Äôre staying in room I‚Äôd find an operator with an Acog because that would increase you‚Äôre chances of winning a fight. 
---
Also do you play Pc,Xbox, or ps4?
---
Crouch spam, lean spam, run-outs, spawn peeking, blitz rushing, dropshotting.... "improving" why not be productive and improve your aim, or practice new ops... not be a toxic sweaty tryhard...
---
I don't like spawn peeking but I think runouts are fair game. That's the play style valkyrie is supposed to embody. It's a fundamental part of the game for certain defenders. I do think run outs are a bit busted though with 3 speeds being able to do it without being caught. I wish lion had a passive that immediately tagged any run out
---
Ready or Not?
---
üòÇüëç
---
Ah, right! Picking Ash is by default a sweaty thing to do. Can I get a complete list of operators I'm allowed to pick in casual to avoid being sweaty? I assume Thatcher and Mira aren't allowed either?
---
A robot operator would be great. Can't one shot headshot it, it has 200 health, and it's biggest weaknesses would be explosives and thatcher.
---
This is cursed
---
yes lol thank you
---
Helpful tips
---
You really don‚Äôt know what you are talking about if you think defenders have the advantage in a spawn peek. After even a few dozen hours you will begin to learn the popular spots to spawn peek and you could always just use a drone to look for any incoming spawn peeks. 
---
As for ash rushes; Kapkan, Frost, Lesion, and Ela all slow down the push. Or you could chill near an entrance with a shotgun and blast her in the face.
---
There use to be tons of exploits for this but I doubt people will find new ones
---
I'd lock her in let bliz keep blinding her have maverick keep burning her nomad keep smacking her into the fridge and lastly have all my team hacks and get breachibg charges put them around the fridge while i lock her in there and blow it up with me
---
Maybe because they like having a larger variety than pro league. None of us are pro league players so why should we be restricted to only playing what they play.
---
You want MOrE of your teammates to be bots?
---
Spawn peeks can be an easy kill for you if you shoot well. Put your drone near where you spawn and look for them. They're not hard to deal with.
---
As far as runouts, claymores are your friend. If you don't have a claymore maybe you shouldn't rappel there.
---
Is that caitlyn jenner
---
In what way? It‚Äôs already decently realistic. How would something like blowing a players head off affect gameplay?
---
Yeah. There special will be hearing aids
---
This guy tried to teleport above us so he can kill us but missed our location and died from fall damage lol
---
Rushing as a (known) buggy op in a tactical shooter is technically "playing the game" but it takes away from the fun of the game. It takes the tactical out of tactical shooter.

Both BF2's

---
Do you not realize that the Ban System is only in Ranked and Pro League? It isn‚Äôt in casual.
---
This is kind of a vague question, what is your play style? Anchor? Roamer? What opps do you use the most?
---
Its worse on console, there‚Äôs a booster or ping spiker in every match.
---
The changing of the barely visible illuminated lights? The theme of the Nova sets for both Warden and Nokk is yellowish and lighter blues. Making Nokk's lights from the grayish blue they are to the theme of yellow for the headgear would be nice since Warden is literally only given yellow headphones for his headgear change.
---
Let me fuze the fridge.
---
Witch-hunting is not allowed.
---
I get you're mad, but you can't try and attack someone like that.
---
Exactly, and you can also get the jump on a group of enemies as a roamer if they are distracted by an enemy. Me and a team member were fighting a group of enemies when a kapkan with a suppressor came up from behind them and took them out one by one. If he didn't have a suppressor then they would've realized he was behind them when he took out the first guy. In the end, all attachments have their uses somewhere

It used to be permanent thermal, but it was recently changed that you need to stand still so it will activate. There is an indicator on the left and right of that thermal circle inside the scope that will indicate if it's active or not.

Ive played many a game and lost but not been upset over the enemy team. My overall k/d and win/loss are both like .5 i play for fun and ive lost many times while having fun. But recently all thse dropshotting-spawnpeeking-leanspaming tryhards are just making the game unplayable. Sure, play to win... just dont run out on my team every round.
---
Every......fucking...... match.....
---
It changes based on ctu

I see a simple solution to the iq glitches tbh. Take away her claymores lmfao. Just hover her bases or something

I'm correcting you on both counts, where's the disconnect here?

Reeeee im going to make a new post about you for trolling. Just you wait the mods who are not related to ubisoft will find your r6s account and perma ban you!!!
---
It‚Äôs...called a competitive game for a reason, if you don‚Äôt play it that way, then cool, I have nothing against that personally, but why put down on other people for playing the game differently than you do? Who cares? Honestly man...
---
There's really only one map where you can be truly spawn peeked, bank. Anywhere else, you have to move into their line of sight. That's on you man.

Yeah it was pretty potato, I was trying out the p90.

Instead of banning claymores they should just ban iq this time. ( atleast on console)
---
Ironic considering it's console ranked üòÇ
---
RDR2 is incredible, one of the best game I ever played.
---
There is no disconnect. Your mocking me for believing in all the memes as you argue your point over a meme... and memes are made due to things that are going on. Ubi claims they "reworked" hit reg... but the memes and the upsets continue... they can "say" a lot... does not mean the issue is actually fixed
---
Jager is literally the only operator on defense that stops projectiles which is the reason he‚Äôs the defender with the highest pickrate by a wide margin. Bandit is my most played operator in the game at 90 hours but jager is easily the better operator. 
---
While Maverick is great on a map like Villa, he‚Äôs much less useful on something like Coastline or Villa.
---
Buck‚Äôs CAMRS has a decent set
---
How do I get a main tag?
---
Thermite picks would go lower than tachanka if that actually happened
---
It‚Äôs called *strategy*
---
it‚Äôs all about the angles that come off the flash bang- think of s bunch of straight lines in all directions of where it lands. if one is in your fov it will trigger. your fov is a bit larger than what you see on your screen

Nah the teammate at the bottom of the leader board... this is siege we‚Äôre talking about

You are a genius someone needs to tell Ubi

That's your fault for buying the season pass then like what did you expect its not like they were 3 other seasons before that
---
Oh I know,  that's the only way ubisoft does bugs. Game breaking
---
I was about to say.
---
I‚Äôve ran into at least 5 people who have done this glitch, it might be just bad luck but I think the platinum/diamond levels are flooded with these people
---
Have we really not started a chain yet?

Wack

It certainly was originally

Someone should say it so r/beetlejuicing

Does it have infinite uses?

Facepaintless Caveira:

that was very satisfying
---
Yup same. This shit is weird. Also havent seen anybody who gets defense all the time, only complaints that they get offense all the time
---
it took me 2 secconds too long to get this
---
The fact that those are half hots (half hots are the outlets where the top half is controlled by a switch and the bottom is constant) shows the detail that went into these maps. Very cool as an electrician to see!!

I think i was a little too specific here. When i say spwan peeked i mean i should not be able to be shot after taking 2 steps out of spawn. The attackers already know the spawns... they just gotta wait for you to walk out. And i should not HAVE to put myself in a position where im at a clear disadvantage just to walk oit of my spawn.
---
how do you do that on mobile i want to keep a persona
---
Nice work mate! Get rid of that red dot site!
---
\*gets spawnpeeked\*
---
So they do nothing to the recoil when ADS. My brother told me ‚Äúit adds weight so there‚Äôs less vertical recoil‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt believe it so I thought I‚Äôd ask. Thank you.
---
Huh, had a clip very similar to this...

There‚Äôs a radius which his gadget effects.. you can throw it in a spot and it can get both the reinforced walls and a barbed wire if so it correctly
---
Thats what he deserves
---
The shotgun is super effective if you can hit the shots with it, i like to think i have decent aim but i still find myself missing the first shot and losing gunfights because im trying to control the recoil; id say stick with the ar because the shotgun is really only as effective as his sidearm. 
---
the electroclaw *can* be used on three reinforcements if they‚Äôre those weird ones that are super close together. other cool things with the electroclaw is that its raidus is similair to a mute jammer in the sense that if you throw at a reinforced wall and blace barbed wire on the opposite side within the claw‚Äôs radius it will electrify it. other cool claw trick are that you can shoot out spaces between floor boards/ceiling and hide them so iq and twitch can‚Äôt easily destroy them.
---
i would highly recommend setting your T Hunt preferences to protect hostage and just play around with it! they‚Äôre super good when it comes to ‚Äúbandit tricking‚Äù walls from a distance as well but i havent successfully done it in the 40+ hours of playing with him. hope this helps!
---
This getting ridiculous, i think despite it being extreme ubi should stop claymores from being picked up. It would suck but atleast we can still use them this way and (hopefully) not keep getring glitched.
---
I was confused as I‚Äôm subbed to subreddits for both games
---
I did by accident because I fat thumbed the crouch key
---
Yeah sure. Seen it happen here already.fuck off
---
Same shit for me too. So weird.
---
Cool. Pm me how to
---
her whole head is way too round.
---
I bought it this year, and I absolutely regret it. People who do the glitches get rewarded by ubisoft instead of punished. It's just too much to stand. They are gearing up to have this game crash and burn.
---
God help Siege if a competitor comes out. I'll be the first to support it.
---
I was just trying to help you man there‚Äôs no need for that language.
---
Maybe, but once it flashes and there's no way to change transparency on it, it could actually mess with our peripheral vision. That would slowly give people more reasons to mute players.
---
The win Delta is far from correct. I wouldn't consider it accurate as long as ranked is as far from pro league as it is currently. Ranked also has tons of hackers currently (proof of this is the defenders chimera win Delta, all traps had very negative W/L. Traps were used to hopefully kill/injure teleporters.)
---
Realistically, you can't do anything. That is Microsoft's and Sony's responsibility, no one else has the power to do anything about it.

Lol your probably a ddos chump

Git gud. Honestly having played with both setups, KB &amp; M rock, even a cheap pair can out perform a controller
---
Well, not anymore
---
That's a snake
---
Ask Ubi
---
Check if UPnP is enabled in your router, also try temporarily setting DMZ in the router (should be in the same area as port opening)
---
Wait wuuut. Did they change something?  
---
Monty was a beast back then tho iirc.
---
Am not ubi but i feel if not going get fixed until mid season, with the new event coming. They usually have patches with new update.
---
uhhhhh, lion cuz i havent bought him yet
---
Yeah sure I‚Äôm a chump. Can we get to the part where you call me a fag next? Or just skip straight to the n word? 
---
I‚Äôve just met you man. You don‚Äôt have to be like this.
---
Cool, thanks not ubi
---
Idk, maybe if they hit right above you you‚Äôll take large amounts of damage

Why are you being such a bitch? You want nokk to light up like a christmas tree so you can see her in spawn? Smh go back to fortnite kid

No, but wardens glasses fuckin are. Thick much?

I use Sennheiser HD650 with my tube amp for music and whatever is lossless but I switch to my Arctis 7 2019 version I got a month ago. I love it. I needed something with good sound isolation because my Sennheisers are open back and I can always hear whatever my girlfriend or the dog are doing because audio bleeds so take that into consideration based off your listening environment!
---
Buck needs an exorcist...

thanks

They‚Äôre glowing because they‚Äôre looking down so the sun is hitting the rim.

The other guys ARENT glowing because he‚Äôs looking relatively straight ahead

Now get me out of silver limbo

Well his other gun has mags and so I think they were too lazy to program specific voice lines for specific guns.
---
To some.
---
 I prefer twitch
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I find Alibi‚Äôs shotgun iron sights pretty good, and the MPX iron sights useable.
---
Do you have an issue with it my good sir?
---
Unfortunately for them, they did. R I P
---
next time bud, just for you &lt;3

That‚Äôs really fucking frustrating
---
I do love twitch as well tbh!
---
no sir, i mean IQ

and then they both get banned
---
A few ideas to counter. Make it a dart gun like Doc‚Äôs, limit the amount of trackers to maybe 3-4 and make it possible to pull out with an animation.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs been maybe 2 weeks now and this shit is still happening.
---
This is a issue thats been there since the start of the internet / online gaming. its not going to get a fix any time soon.
---
Nah you cant have a preference when its against the rules!  The only bitching comes from mk users who cant aim with controllers for shit! And they arent good enough on pc either.
---
Haven't played fortnite since the end of season 2. 1 more season than i wished to play but no on the played this game or any other when that shit was popular. Oh wait that's still how it is. 
---
Two no i don't want her to be a "Christmas tree" as you,  the bitch of the conversation right now ssys i do. No there's two little fuckibg lights under her vail on her helmet. How is changing those to a darker color even going to make her light up huh? 
---
Stop trying to sound smart cause all you did there was make yourself look like a jackass. Cause you're acting like one of course.

Nice I would have just missed

Just got him on my team with someone else who was also hacking. They should put a way to block people and not queue with them like ow
---
So is his counter Jedi or something?
---
How much did ubisoft pay you for you to be their slave? How much more can you arse lick them? Ubisoft isn't a small team of 5, there are many devs from ubisoft that work to improve and develop r6. Can you honestly say they are doing a good job in terms of fixing the game? We had a whole season taken away from us to better the game, i didn't mind this because i thought it actually would fix them but of course it didnt do anything major and new game breaking glitches were released straight after. There are so many good aspects of the game sadly they get drowned by the terrible developers failing to maintain this game.  
---
Its a fact that ubisoft are incompetent at this point, and you can't argue with facts. If you do your actually delusional.
---
I dont record myself playing so i dont have video but it should be obvious to ubi by stats theyre hacking. Dont see why they need video all the time
---
Gold 3 I think, maybe 4
---
Apologies, couldn‚Äôt sleep so i wrote all this on mobile so it looked pretty formatted while i was writing it then it all went to shit. Speed pads are pads that have much less friction than a mid tier pad such as a Qck which is between control and speed. r/mousepadreview loves speed pads
---
All of it originates from 4chan, this isn‚Äôt new knowledge.
---
On my main I‚Äôve never used ela. I‚Äôve only used her like an hour or two on my smurf. She‚Äôs just too much of a meme to use. The hour I played was enough for a lifetime.
---
Only when it's too late
---
It's really hard to call it cheating when the devs allow and support it. Kb &amp; m allow someone to have a much greater amount of precision, not automatically make them better at the game. Potato aim happens all the time for everyone. It's a matter of how limited each person is. Having better headphones may allow you to hear footsteps better but it doesn't mean you can get any more kills. Having a lower ping allows you to act more so in real time but that doesn't mean you can get the jump on someone. Even as you said, strategy can win in spite of different equipment. The whole game is about strategy, not about peripherals.
---
If you zoom in really close you can see him deflecting the bullets with his toothpick. All I can say is he‚Äôs clearly too powerful for you to challenge with just a gun
---
Now cav will know fear
---
Only played ranked for the last year or so basically just dicked about in casual with some friends for ages
---
Every operator does not have the same frag potential, incentivizing kills over objective gameplay is bad for the game since support players are important too. Whether that's a monty or thermite, while its possible to get kills it's definitely not as easy as an R4-C.
---
What?
---
Personaly I would buy Zofia, good guns, easy to use but great gadget and claymores. Dokkaebi is cool but the mk14 is a bit tricky to use if your are new and or not that good at aiming. Finka is good aswell but not fun to play in most peoples opinions, and Lion is just a broken piece of shit so please dont buy Lion.
---
Did both at various points, none worked.
---
The chance still increases after matches until it drops to the baseline (when I'm supposed to get the packs) but no packs are added
---
I would say yes if you want to not spend rewown or R6 credits for up and coming operations.
---
LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED!

The Shidenkai might be ideal for you, however it isn't for everyone. Personally I like the Zero most of any of them that I've tried, which is about as far away from your preference as it gets. When it comes to mice and mousepads, everything is subjective (well aside from weight to a certain extent) and it's important to remember that. Just because you personally like fast, doesn't mean everyone does.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For an example, theres a Youtuber by the name of Brandon Taylor. He for quite a long time said he aimed best with a Shidenkai, however on his most recent stream he said hes preferred the Zero for a little while now. Now, this isn't universal. Some people like BadSeed tech swear by hard pads and do aim best with pads that zoom. This is just to display my point that it is subjective, and not to tell people that just because its your preference, doesn't mean its the same everyone else.
---
My dumbass forgot to link the vid
---
Yuck disgusting, Why! Now I know why she has face paint.
---
Aahhhh, thanks for the explanation!
---
&gt; , hence the ban on claymores last season.
---
might aswell ban the whole game because it's been one gamebreaking exploit after another.
---
Ma boi Llamas is famoos now!

ye, shadowplay i have used it in the past as well but idk what happened now. Im going to play a ton of r6 today and ill msg back if the problem is still here.

You really think ddosing on games originates from 4chan? What is this CCN and how the elite hacker 4chan is breaking our games thread?
---
Yes 4chan has threads on how to ddos game servers, Same thing with reddit subs or neogaf if you look for it, Hell there are discord servers with this shit and people discussing different services/botnets that provide better/faster/cheaper DDoSing .
---
DDoSing isnt new knowledge, its been there for ages.

if the enemies are smart they would go for theater, in ranked this setup could work very well since 90% of ranked players know like 1 attack strat per bomb site. I have seen a team i scrimmed against do something similair but they did reinforce vip to penthouse wall. you could try it out but make sure you forget theater. if you leave that then attackers might be able to plant without your team being able to stop it.
---
It helps if you use some Negative reinforcement for when you potato. Miss shots on an enemies back, punch yourself in the temple. Miss lose an easy win, choke yourself for the duration of the next pick phase. Its really effective, youll either get better or die
---
Feel ya, you wont know tilt till you lose 5-4 with a 008 bottom frag. That's true suffering, happened yesterday lmao.
---
Ash
---
Yeah, I don't mind the premise or anything of what you said, it's just really meandering and long which will get people to not read it all.
---
What are your theories on mouse sens? I am a bit of a nut when it comes to that stuff, I think people who say "your mouse sens is what feels right" is a bunch of BS. Just looking at players of FPS games you can see the trend that nearly everyone is playing at a very low effective dpi. My theory is that the size of your mousepad is what determines your sens, just over a 180 for a full swipe of the mousepad seems to be a nice rule I go by. But, at the same time it is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, so I would keep that in mind.
---
Remember... No russian
---
&gt;should be more personal consideration
---
There is, but on the k/d part, cause that would be dumb.
---
All you have to do is be a good leader and help the team with commands.
---
His uniform is really cool.
---
His weapons skins and charms are dope 
---
His gadget re-skin is garbage
---
His animation is is middle of the road. Not nearly as good as Fuze‚Äôs but better than a lot.
---
Lol there is no debate once you switch you'll wonder how you ever played on anything else
---
As a Canadian I must agree. Somehow in the transition between C7 and C8, the colt became a fire hose of recoil
---
I bet you would pay a lot to have grenades on Iq again huh
---
They throw impacts BEHIND you. NOT the shield. Get it?
---
)':
---
ah shit an ash main lol
---
Yeah it was more of an overused gimmick that wasnt even that useful. Wasnt even worth it to do it since it was just detrimental more times than it helped. Only thing it was useful for really was dashing past doorways and even then it wasnt anything special. For peeking people its literally just the worse version of dropshotting. Its just the same thing but with dropshots you can aim.
---
So you gonna do drunken ranked?
---
I thought you could spit me one with all that semen you're gargling.
---
Nah that's clearly fake.
---
I had a question, btw. If I'm a gold, am I going to play with only gold ranked players?
---
you can kill everyone with rushing :d
---
Umm Belle Delphine mentioned on the rainbow six subreddit.....
---
Why?
---
I enjoy playing IQ normally anwyay so i pick her to stop others from trying this.
---
not everyone lol not an aware player
---
What the frick
---
Well, no. Not exactly. if there is 5 gold 2 team they can find gold team, but also 2 plats 3 coppers team. Anyway it's still more fair than casual matchmaking and less toxic, with KD and skills like yours you will get copper/bronze, so you might encounter some deranks or smurfs, but there are way more "normal" players.
---
I'm not the one crying like a bitch over a video game lmao. Soft
---
she‚Äôs toxic but strong attacker in my opinion
---
*break

You want them to stop working, not just slow down.
---
Some people just have twisted reasons why they play the game.
---
Hell yea it is
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
i think maverick is better tbh his ar has an acog and high damage also 3 speed and an amazing gadget
---
Haha, imagine playing Jackal, Blitz, and Cav in 2019
---
Rip Hahahaha
---
Sorry, I don't understand the term "smurf", what does it mean?
---
And btw I knew I wasn't going to be gold or anything lol I was just it as an exemple :')
---
I'm not the one crying over a video game. Just deal with it cry baby. üò™üò™üò™

The worst for me is Favela.. fuck I hate it. (Only playable in Casual) lots of breakable walls and peak windows.. Fav is prob Fortress great layout and stairs are in good spots IMO
---
vigil shotgun
---
‚Äúcyberpunk 2077‚Äù
---
I like how you had to delete this and revise it after calling me "soft". Did you realize talking shit over reddit wasn't so hard and alpha?
---
Basicly yeah, plus less damage throug material but silenced benefits
---
Because reddit?
---
It would be a lot of work but really what ubisoft should do is not even try to fix the games ever ending new and recycling glitches and build a new game that isnt a giant spaghetti mess.
---
Not really though
---
Oh no! You can‚Äôt operate and play the game at 120fps?!? Oh boy, I can‚Äôt help but feel the need to feel sorry for you now

Hello Grekazz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c38puz/this_happened_to_me_right_after_the_mouse_bug_i/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Tchanka. He has the lowest pickrate for a reason. Bis gadget has been buffed but I doubt he will ever be usable with a turret. They really need to change his gadget to something else that actually makes him useful.
---
Kills the fucking game

Korean parents: "Holy crap hes going to [DIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death)!"
---
I was ment to take it of but i forgot beforehand
---
How dare you call the recruit shit
---
whole enemy team is playing first time i guess :d
---
Ubisoft needs to do harsher penalties for people like this, they're glitching which is cheating, wtf are they thinking not doing anything about it when you have hard evidence?
---
I think you can still use recruit if all of your owned operators get banned. You will just wait through the operator selection screen not being able to choose anything and then at the end you will get assigned recruit. This would probably require a second account though.
---
Congrats man
---
Let me brimstone the fridge.
---
Her acog is clearly OP
---
cheers for the reply mate! I always play super aggressively when i roam (falling back to waste time when necessary) so i‚Äôve always stuck to jager but everyone‚Äôs telling me that vigils guns are good too plus the impacts and gadget could help me a lot
---
iq glitch is back /u/Ubi-Ludo
---
Are those thermal impacts?
---
RARE!
---
That's called lazy dev work.
---
Lol, I hate both of those guns. Never had any success with bosg, and I cant see my target with c75
---
Nah, the point is that the game banned recruit :(
---
Worst sight in the game
---
Funny I dropped from Plat 2 to bronze this season
---
I love Keanu, but this doesn‚Äôt need to happen.
---
I can count the pixels
---
Did you consider that the person who left might‚Äôve been disconnected? If that‚Äôs the case, then someone would take their spot, and as a result they‚Äôd lose MMR for not being able to rejoin the match.
---
He would just be too op to play and too kind to kill.
---
I would recommend vigil but j√§ger and bandit are also good. The main reason why vigil is preferable for roaming over the other two for me is because he has impact grenades and can flank and expose enemies from unexpected places. He can also waste time and that‚Äôs the main job for a roamer. Vigil is also fun to play if you have an aggressive playstyle.
---
What does GCA stand for?
---
Jokes on ubi because n√∏kk is garbage
---
New op confirmed: Robin Williams
---
i disabled it yesterday, dusted off my rig (power supply was almost completely dusted close) and updated my drivers
---
i also opened a ticket to ubisoft, send my dxdiag and stuff, see what happenes, i dont think its a hardware problem though since its only this game and it worked before the latest patch and im not the only one with this problem.
---
Kinda felt like it. Thanks man üëç
---
Buying the pass unlocks 10% discount in store but it wont let me buy credits to spend at all.
---
It's been multiple months (3+) maybe but ubisoft care doesnt provide a valid response. Sends an automated everytime.
---
Aggression is the name of the game for me. I usually love to hold certain areas of the map and then pull of late game flanks and i think vigil is perfect for that.
---
Thank you üëç
---
Yeah I use to be trah with it to lol, but force yourself to use it and you will start to pick up them kills lol. I got a 4k with it a few days ago lol. Yeah I go agree that the sight is a bit fog shit but I've always liked the gun better than the smg12, I feel that it rips threw people a lot easier lol but that's just me lol.
---
Yes John Wick, his ability would be a pencil.
---
Bitch what? Lol
---
Is this a console only glitch? I haven't seen it happen on PC yet.
---
I don‚Äôt really play j√§ger anyway, occasionally I‚Äôll get his on random pick. But my main roaming operator is cav it warden
---
I thought they were more like thermal impacts.
---
I played against one last night and he had the nerve to put in his ps bio: 'Stop reporting, I don't use a modded controller or mouse and keyboard, I'm just lucky'
---
The guys aim on the round end killcam had unreal diagonal aim, it was shaking all over the place like he has a super high DPI setting.
---
Needless to say I wanted to smash his PS over his ugly, sad piece of shit head.
---
There could also be like a prompt when queueing that says "Ongoing match found, Enter?" And then maybe show the score to see if its worth it. This is just a rough idea tho but maybe Ubi can tweak it and make it optional to join unbalanced teams in ranked, obviously modifying the amount of MMR given or taken to adapt to the time played as to not affect players who joined for the last few rounds too much.
---
If you have been playing since day 1 why didn‚Äôt you just buy black ice when it was available to purchase?

---
Yea I just got tk‚Äôd because I tried to throw a camera. Then I got vote kicked. Fuck team killers
---
Well thank you very much uwu
---
Oh tight! Kudos on the job man. But I do miss you in content.
---
Lolol you have no idea. Last season people were able to glitch deplorable shields to their face making them invincible to body and head shots and clash was invincible as well with her glitch. Then you had IQ running around invisible
---
Too bad my random teammates will keep wasting their ban on Jackal.
---
Don‚Äôt you need R6 credits to buy pro league sets not renown
---
Because we are talking about how fun it is, as a tactician, it is an operator in which it is stealthy, it helps with information, it is not very good rush since it has 2 speed but it works. Not to mention the weapons he uses
---
Yeah
---
You cannot fix cheating.
---
Hardware bans. Not everyone can afford getting a new PC every 2 weeks
---
Hey so I have a question. I‚Äôm not a very good player (my skill ranges from low silver to high gold on any given day). In order to get better, should I solo queue or stay in squads. In squads I feel like I allow myself to get carried, and so I don‚Äôt end up actually getting better at the game.
---
On like the best gun too
---
I'm not allowing this on my part , as my second go to is IQ (almost my main)
---
For fucks sake Ubisoft do something !
---
I still have PTSD because of the jager glitch that turned him into a Blackbeard, but instead of Blackbeards tiny shield, he had the fucking deployable shield stuck to his head
---
If it lasts 1-2 months then at that point you have to assume the devs don't intend to remove it so you should just treat it like an advanced technique until they do.
---
let's try
---
Exactly, in games where there are little optic sights like BF1 you learn to like your irons.
---
Ubisoft are quite possibly the most technically incompetent devs/management.
---
Top 10 anime betrayals
---
ur for real a tachunky main?
---
definetly its his connection
---
I think that they should make you lose less MMR when you lose based on the amount of teammates you have at the end of the round. If you have a full team; full MMR penalty. Only four people stayed in; slightly less of a penalty and so on. It‚Äôs just ridiculous because I‚Äôve been in ranked games where it‚Äôs only me and another person because three people left. It‚Äôs sucks to lose so much MMR when I have no chance of winning.
---
The problem is the Anvil Engine its based on. While Engines are generally flexible, Anvil was original built for Single Player games like AC. That is one reason why they are taking so long with fixing stuff, cause they are not only fighting the bugs but also the engine. Another reason how underfunded the team that works on Siege seems to be. This has pretty much been an issue since the beginning and the highest levels at Ubi simply dont seem to care too much about Siege as other franchises bring so much more money in without having nearly as much development expense. 
---
Keep in mind that these are just speculations on my part but from what we have seen and some Insiders have leaked in the past its a reasonable speculations. Only thing we can do is urge the Company to put more resources into the devteam and in the future to change engines (which probably wont happen as it is extremly costly)
---
Try to minimise it.
---
I use Valkyrie's peashooter. :/
---
I don't typically like using Shotguns (unless it's Mozzie's shorty) so if there's ever a time I use Valk, I know I'll have the disadvantage right off the bat.
---
Only if this wasn't a few weeks ago lol
---
hit me up, threeface3 eu
---
I‚Äôm gold 4 on console but I play with my diamond friends( yes I pull my own weight I don‚Äôt get carried, i anchor and usually get 5 kills a game) but I would say people are known for exploiting the game in diamond and higher elo. It‚Äôs hell because I‚Äôve never been exposed to it but it doesn‚Äôt make the game fun what so ever.
---
Hello fellow hostage murderer
---
Yea i got lucky
---
i‚Äôm 90 lvl too but still haven‚Äôt any black ice..
---
looks like Integer overflow. I think ubisoft was never expecting someone to go down that far
---
Nice! ü§ù
---
I'm getting flashbacks from the worshipper in Skyrim that never dies .
---
Actually I didn't have a team to play with last season in ranked. If we play we just play casual and have fun. I do play on PC so there's no need to continue to to say console is shit cause I know it is, and I rarely play on console anymore. I went back to console just to get my rank.
---
Valk on defense because of her utility and her desert eagle and I like Buck, Zofia, and N√∏kk on attack
---
IQ is one of my favorite attacking ops, yet I CAN‚ÄôT PLAY HER ANYMORE.
---
Worst Op? N√∏kk. She's far too situational, and besides, if you don't want cams to see you, shoot the camera. And her silent step/ invisibility is only good in a flank scenario. And her loadout? We don't talk about her shitty loadout.
---
The ctu should be CIS (confederacy of independent systems)

what is tachankas name ??? UBI needs to fix this shit
---
I came across someone who killed us during warm-up time and we all reported him. The next day when I logged on I got the rank adjustment message and got my MMR back. So they are doing work in banning its just not instant.
---
Reverse friendly fire works very well imo, haven‚Äôt had a guy kill our whole team yet in the past week
---
Best title
---
You're rather odd.
---
Ok so if you rarely play console and all you wanted to do was get your rank, why is this such a big deal then? lmfao.
---
I've never understood why blitz gets banned
---
Is it just me or is everyone using Red Dot suddenly?
---
mate there is a video of get\_flanked and CR on this matter i think you should check it out
---
Only way to win a terrorist hunt bomb.
---
Me too! I dont think her smg is that bad though, at least it has no recoil. Plus, I guess the way I play Valk minimizes the disadvantage. I never pick a fight where attackers can see me. I run out or attack from the angles they are not covering
---
I use to only main Mute because he had really good weapons. His gadget was good every now and again, but it is F A R better than before.
---
That‚Äôs a big gun
---
Right there with you brother!
---
yes, report button for console, and better battle eye for pc
---
Won't get any disagreement out of me. Not sure why my comment got downvoted though.
---
I didn't play since 3-4 months too, how there are so many glitches in game now?
---
Probably low rank not really paying much attention that the holograms could be an actual alibi (No offense to the low ranks out there y'all will eventually get there &lt;3)
---
It has nothing to do with her claymore. I think it is a rappel glitch
---
I‚Äôm too lazy but if I need to know what the glitch is and why it‚Äôs happening I‚Äôll just YouTube it.theres easily a dozen morons every season with a new ‚Äúinsane new glitch! Get diamond ez!!!‚Äù Video. 
---
Fucking hate those people, and they have the balls to lie and say they‚Äôre just trying to spread awareness so it gets fixed. So if you want to fact check it just head over to YouTube, we aren‚Äôt allowed to talk about the actual mechanics of glitches here for obvious reasons
---
Kills and team playing are 2 totally different things
---
I can just imagine Thatcher saying, " I am anti electronics guy, *sets down massive rifle* and this... Is my weapon."
---
Cause I kept getting team killed and I had to sit for 30 minutes and just watch the game. How is that not an issue?
---
I'm starting to experience the same thing... I won't hear a teammate use an impact grenade right behind me, won't even have ears ringing, but I'll feel the vibration, but I can hear someone breaking a fucking barricade on the other side of the map. My connection is excellent too so I'm doubting it's lag or such. Don't know whats going on.
---
No I have tried and It has already been used by PegasusYami55
---
Thanks :)
---
You're positioning poorly. The closer you are to the corner the more your sight is restricted.
---
I was pretty sure if one claymore would explode next to each other the others would explode too.
---
Meine auch xd
---
Why do youtubers put up a tutorial about how to do it. The argument is that it helps ubisoft to be aware of the glitch. Couldn't they just show proof it works to get people to report it and personally tell ubisoft how to do it so they can fix it. Or they are just cunts.
---
Man the people in this Dunkin‚Äô Donuts are probably wondering what made me laugh out loud and nut on the spot.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter because an idea needs people like you to keep it alive. Without that it will keep being an idea. You are not stealing someone‚Äôs idea.. you are reviving it.
---
It's safe to say that I'll never touch warden because of how absolutely useless he is.
---
Wow!
---
And, i cannot stress this enough, YEET
---
it shouldnt give an adventage but it i'm serious it still relevant
---
You need a claymore as well as rapelling i think.
---
Actually it's a feature, if you kill a player (or a bot) while they are rappelling, the body will stay hanging.
---
this is cool &amp; all but i definitely prefer the Lord Tachanka bundle. looks way better &amp; i genuinely think they should've just made that his elite.
---
IQ mains after they get their claymore back
---
It doesn't give an advantage. So you've nothing to complain about on that front.
---
You just got roger rogered
---
Nice triple!
---
Doc, rook is just better
---
Holo on rook? Ugh
---
≈∏√∂√ª G√∂t √Ñ≈Ñ√ø ≈Å√•mp Br√∏th√™r
---
of cause i'm not the only one who complain about it but its important to fix it
---
I play blitz for the melee. I'm not a very effective blitz
---
Guess hitting the head will pop it off.
---
idk looks legit to me.
---
What‚Äôs mk?
---
Still trying to achieve it
---
Lol yeah glaz is now basically recruit but with an occasional thermal
---
You gain/lose more mmr at the start of seasons.
---
&gt;Peaking is very busted because they would be appear invisible or they would simply fire at me when they don't know im peaking there.
---
What? Peeking*
---
Well, I have almost 400 hours/lvl 174 (in-game gameplay time) and I've never, not even one single time, ever got a Legendary from an alpha pack. (except special packs, yeah)
---
You do realize there are pros who never use ACOG, right? It's ridiculous to tell people what sights to use. It's completely personal preference.
---
you're right it would be different in the fact that if you scatter burned a reinforced wall to peak through they wouldn't immediately know which hole you was holding an angle on, with mav they know your going to peaking the whole you just burned, with the droid it would create multiple holes at once thus allowing to peak one without the enemy straight off the bat knowing which one to one tap you through, good shit
---
It's fine. They're just complaining.
---
Well done bud, just gotta stay there now.
---
What are some other good crossover ideas?
---
they're mad because they died
---
Because it‚Äôs funny
---
Ela. She may have a lot of recoil and a peashooter but she‚Äôs fun to play
---
On pc
---
I‚Äôm still out here stuck in Bronze II
---
Not toxic, they have claymores for a reason.
---
But there isn‚Äôt a problem. Peeking close exposes you more than peeking wide, so it seems like you get killed without you even able to see the enemy.
---
Huh
---
It's not much of a complicated mechanic actually. First you ADS, then you press the prone button. So you can keep shooting during the animation. The advantage is, it's really hard for an opponent to headshot you during the process.
---
Ubisoft recently tried to prevent dropshooting by forcing the player out of ads as soon as he prones. But the last patch accidentally put it back in game.
---
A clip to illustrate : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hweYQeCGpCs
---
Once I was testing to see if I could stack valk cams and after I places all 3 (spoiler they can't stack) my friend instantly tk'd then I got voted out for bad cam placements, casual being casual
---
"They've got Droidicas!"
---
Every clip i see there's always something wrong during a match, Servers messing up or something?
---
I merely proposed tight/far angles as a solution to this current subject. I don‚Äôt think that the subject is OK because more than half the time you can still position yourself properly to engage the enemy and the same problem will still occur.
---
That‚Äôs 100% a wendys receipt
---
If you have friends to play ranked with it's so much better
---
In ranked there's no problem with it.  In casual they can be really annoying but ultimately you want to win so whatever.
---
Yeah, just [look at the advantage](https://i.redd.it/ftrkyvdg20531.png) it gave Supremacy against Shaiiko! /s
---
Sights are 100% personal preference. Doesn't matter if it's Siege, CS, COD, or what. It all boils down to whatever works best for you.
---
The chart I different for each person but the most common ranks silver 1 through gold 2
---
Ooof
---
round 9, damn that match must have been a slugfest haha, nice one
---
Kobe
---
ayy hello brother
---
Yes pls. I honestly hate a lot of the super crazy elite skins
---
Perspectiveso, abusei, balanceso
---
&gt;  I don‚Äôt think that the subject is OK because more than half the time you can still position yourself properly to engage the enemy and the same problem will still occur.
---
Do you have video examples? I don't think it happens outside of the "you're too close to the corner" situation.
---
how do i get my main next to my name??
---
Server stairs?
---
What is this a crossover? With r/StarwarsBattlefront
---
So perfect. Love this!
---
That's actually really clean looking.
---
I'm confused. You don't like when Ubisoft bans people for exploiting?
---
wat da fuq

!remindme 1 day ‚Äúvideo with sound‚Äù
---
Wow dude, you must be really bad.
---
Probably Liquid or Rogue
---
Does anyone else find it hilarious and weird that uni made only a single Israeli/Jewish op and named her \*ASH\*
---
OP‚Äôs trying his best!
---
Did you just use "I know you are but what am I?" On this guy?
---
Scored a overtime ranked game winning kill last night with a claymore, we were on round 10üò≠üò≠
---
About Lesion: I have 1380 kills on him and a k/d ratio of 1.48. 
---
He already got 2 nerfs in quick succesion: 1 on his smg and 1 on the damage tick on his gadget. 
---
His gu‚Äôs are pretty easy to see if you pay attention to your surroundings and only serve two purposes: 
---
- intel. I even think a kapkan or frost need the same kind of indicators to their gadgets
---
- slow down pushes
---
He has pretty hard counters: drones to see the gu‚Äôs even better than with the naked eye, thatcher emps, twitch drones.
---
The only thing pretty broken about him is his synnergy with Frost, where he‚Äôs able to pretty must one shot.
---
I have Yellow Fin and Space Martian, this skin is pretty great I must say but why so many legendaries for the F2 I wonder.
---
Yes i can disagree with frist sentence with 2th yeah you are right but remember apex was never good all hype was from fortnite hate when fortnite hate died out a little game tho
---
Like the r4c?
---
Yeah sometimes it‚Äôs pretty obvious that the other team is just screwing around, playing for fun.  But you do see some ridiculous shit down there.
---
And with the recent changes Ubi made to TKing, it‚Äôs made being toxic *easier* than ever before.
---
When ash kills an enemy or friendly accidentally or purposefully with breaching rounds
---
Yep. Best summary of events.
---
i came into Health after a hiatus from the really early times and then I came back again this year and both times I see the worst the game has to offer lol.
---
Months and months of entire swaths of the corest gameplay put on ice... is this alpha again???! ü§£ü§£xD
---
How did I ‚Äúaim a post at one person‚Äù 
---
Literally said not to go after anyone in this post. 
---
Showed the names to link them together.
---
Youre talking out of your ass. Tf2 remains in the top 10 on steam charts right now, and always has been. Thats not "irrelevant" its "not recent"
---
thats freaking awesome dude
---
I refuse to play any shield operator as I am a hetero male
---
The the exact same, but when I tried match making it would say that the custom game had already been started.... goobie plz
---
I'm stuck in copper limbo, full of throwers and toxic players

When will people stop posting this?

Good explanation tbh lol

---
mormons/jehovas witnesses worst nightmare
---
but what they deserve üëå
---
I honestly don't know .
---
Maybe it's a way to give chances to some of them as well known consistent hackers receive such bans
---
Maybe they don't want cyber cafe owners to get screwed by some hacker because he got banned 
---
Maybe it's something else I don't understand .
---
And speaking of cafes , we have one nearby I'm considered as a very huge customer to them , I'm mostly there with my friends , on games like pubg mobile , the amount of people that hack is a bit big but they're numbered , I've seen them , captured footage and reported them to Tencent , I told the owner , my friend basically , that this is a huge risk he's taking , he understands it and said they'll hold whoever causes the device to get HWID banned responsibility , so far it's been alright but whoever I reported got banned , the cafe has internet protections against IP bans too or something .
---
If I know some companies these days , banning players costs them profit , knowing Ubisoft ... won't be surprised if that's one of the reasons of why they aren't doing it .
---
The yellow fin skin is definitely my favorite F2 skin in the game. I wish I had it, but I'm not sure if you can even get it in alpha packs anymore.
---
Na I'm pretty sure u game on PlayStation with your fortnite friends lol garbage
---
No i extracted ubisoft to at least do something that isn't just changing a color for a skin. Oh wait they did that for Ela's winter set by only makin her hat a lighter gray and her jacket from a tan color to white. How original.
---
Not the exact same, but when I tried matchmaking ranked it would say that the custom game I was trying to join had already been started...  goobie plz
---
i dare for someone to shop in jounouchi / joeys creepy chin.
---
This was during grim sky I believe
---
I said I would 1v1 bud btw nice 51 hours of fuze and your shit silver placements and no rank for seasons
---
Unfortunately I think Yellow Fin and even Space Martian are no longer available, would totally trade you my Yellow Fin for your Lovelace if I could.
---
I actually like the copper tag
---
Risky click of the day
---
https://youtu.be/ElOEwtx7wjA
---
Currently on gold 2, never been to plat, I really hope I hit it
---
Bro why aren‚Äôt you using the m870
---
Clash
---
Cluster is brighter so if you aren't a stealthy boi just run that with the uniform and you look cool
---
So yeah you defended the game solely because your ubisofts pet. Just because you play the game doesn't mean you shouldn't face facts, just accept it and move on dont try to defend it when you have nothing good to say about the game and then end the argument with a pointless sentence.
---
I stop playing the game when the glitches actually affect me, right now i haven't experienced anything hence why im still playing. I enjoy the game when it works, like everyone else does apart from pets like you of course.
---
Basically
---
They can absolutely ban people proven to be using M&amp;k
---
I want one of those so bad.
---
Dude, thats amazing its all from games. My dream gun is a 308 mag fed bolt action rifle with a suppressor similar to kaids.
---
Pump actions are more fun
---
You sir üòé
---
What a legend.
---
Clash being banned isnt an issue. It's a blessing.
---
Why you bully my lack of shiny skins :(
---
Oh god
---
544 hours in casual and is still a bot
---
It was literally the first thing I thought of haha
---
assert old hereford
---
He also did a Kratos cosplay also.
---
Still a masterpiece of a music video imo.
---
Cause you posted a pic of 1 person the top, then a pic with him with his team and another of you asking why he does it. Hence the post aimed at one person no you didn't you said that in a comment when I said about witch hunting.
---
If there was nothing wrong with the post it would still be up now just down vote this comment and move on.
---
I like that
---
Maybe for some, but people in games are getting annoyed with clash still being banned lmao
---
I play everyone, tank doesn't mean nothin because I haven't played and you main jackal, garbage
---
"Bitch im *BUSY*
---
Bring it back plz
---
I csn't get myself to play 1speeds
---
He wins these
---
TEN SECONDS ‚ÄòTILL INSERTION.
---
I actually main hibana or twitch... plus are we not gonna 1v1 or are you just a pussy?
---
i legit think the new one is much better, no offense
---
I was just messing around on someone else‚Äôs Xbox in Rainbow. A smoke spawnpeeked me from Library on Chalet, and I shot a round into it and killed them. A Jager spawnpeeked through the same window so I shot another round at the same place and killed him. 3 games later I opened a Black Ice on the GIGN pistol.
---
Now I am sad cuz I don‚Äôt have a clip of the two breaching kills nor a black ice.
---
When, exactly did this become about religion?
---
Repost different name in the pic there are nine Es your username is 10 long
---
Haha same
---
A window into hell
---
Too broke to give gold ‚Äî‚Äî&gt;üèÖ
---
Imagine trying to spawnpeek as Doc and getting owned by an IQ using a red dot üòÇüòÇ nice shot op üòä
---
Yeah bugs like this happen all the time especially with all of these shit servers in phantom sight
---
Doing that is so fun on T-Hunt.
---
No but you definitely need an IV and some Tylenol cause you‚Äôre way too sweaty lol
---
Basically a manually operated sentry gun
---
Sorry I should have clarified, I was referencing the game. lol
---
Silent sprint by spamming shift is still in the game though
---
I'm prepared to be downvoted to oblivion for expressing my opinion, butttttt... Blitz honestly isn't that hard to deal with... just keep your distance, save your impacts and nitro cells for when you really need them and just play smart. It's not difficult to kill Blitz. I feel like people in the siege community complain about a lot of things. Clash isn't hard to deal with either. Like when I see that people would rather ban blitz over a jackal in competitive matchmaking it just makes me wonder how bad some people are.
---
Target Areas To Shoot: Legs, Hand, &amp; When a Blitz is Aiming Down Sights, just shoot them literally anywhere.
---
killer queen daisan no bakudan bites za dusto
---
Doesn't say they changed the renown gain though just returned to the old way of unlocking.
---
Do you want a gold star or something?
---
 
---
* **Fixed** \- It is possible to remove the recoil of any gun by following some steps.
---
Surprised they didn't just remove guns from the game for a month.
---
I kind of thought so..I figure it's a lot more challenging and complicated for yall than patching a bug.  In the mean time, is there anything we as a community can do to help combat it?  Like is submitting support tickets along with video evidence sufficient enough to possibly remove people who do that?  I'm asking mainly for console because it's a little more difficult for us to use videos since we have to go through 3rd party websites like xboxdvr, and we dont have battle eye.
---
You can tell me ?
---
A good noodle star would be nice Mrs puff, yes
---
What?...
---
I was really into aesthetics playing *The Division* and would discard weapons with good rolls purely because they weren't the variants I liked (e.g. Paratrooper SVD with synthetic furniture kept, Surplus SVD with classic wood furniture discarded).
---
In hindsight that wasn't terribly smart since the probability of getting similar rolls on a different variant would be astronomically low, but aesthetics mattered *dammit*.
---
As for guns matching that description, there are a few I've seen in *The Division* or *Wildlands*:
---
* "[M700 Carbon](https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/M700?file=M700_Carbon.jpg)"; Remington 700 with XLR Carbon Chassis.
---
* [SRSA1 Covert](https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/SRS?file=Covert_SRS_Louqas.jpg); Desert Tech SRSA1 bullpup bolt-action rifle.
---
* "[Custom M44](https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/M44?file=Custom-M44.png)"; Mosin‚ÄìNagant M44 with an Archangel OpFor Stock.
---
 - This one technically shouldn't make the list since it's not 7.62√ó51mm.
---
* [MSR](https://ghostrecon.fandom.com/wiki/MSR/Ghost_Recon_Wildlands?file=MSR_a.png); Remington Modular Sniper Rifle.
---
 - The one in *Wildlands* uses .338 Lapua.
---
Most of those would probably go with an [Omega 300](https://www.silencershop.com/osilencerco-omega-7-62.html) suppressor, which looks quite unique due to the Anchor Brake cap at the end that works a bit like a muzzle brake.
---
HMU when you get 18 kills
---
I think I lost 10lbs after all that sweat bro
---
Thank You
---
yeah, I think so
---
Go to ‚ÄúEdit user flair‚Äù and select up to 5 emoticons
---
General rule in games and real life is: if the explosive doesn't explode....run away from it.
---
Don't worry, I saw your aim in your last clip. When you get out of copper, lmk.
---
Ah I haven‚Äôt played it then
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. Mute jammers jam friendly nitro cells.
---
Soon they gonna remove all operators only recruit gonna be left lmao
---
They should put this as a discovery mode only before adding it or not to the raked
---
Big Boi Castle S T R A T S
---
Even In casual she banned
---
I almost made that but then I got randomly selected as ash.
---
Depends what rank this is.
---
Pulse is very good at roaming from below because of his scanner &amp; can use his C4 from below on soft floors. Sometimes getting 2+ kills if you're patient enough. But he is also very good around the sites using his scanner for knowledge to your teammates if you make call outs. I personally roam when using him. But like I said, a good enemy team will know what you're trying to do if you get spotted.
---
You can trigger by performing an action, which is what happened in the clip. Picking up a c4 is an action so it triggers it.
---
You spelt silver wrong, Jesus christ
---
The/A Glitch may be back/discovered
---
Yeah definitely, i mentioned up above that I'm trying to train myself to go for headshots more so using the suppressor helps :P
---
The number of times I got screwed over for being inaccurate though, it hurts :(
---
You should be able to click on an operator and see its guns stats. (If you do this please tell me and I will download it)
---
They are just talking about the IQ-glitch. They explicitly say 'We will continue to work on addressing the exploits for Clash and Deployable Shields and share updates as we progress.'
---
For me she looks better before
---
Lmao now o can prove to that guy that the max ping isn‚Äôt 1000 can I use your photo?
---
It bugged out. You trigger it by performing a new action which is why it detonated when pulse took up his pulse scanner at the end of the video
---
See kids that's what happens when you don't ban Echo
---
OP, where the fuck is the killcam?
---
I swear to god if someone else gets a fucking suit of Knight armor before Monty and Rook I'm gonna lose it.
---
Yeah credit me if you can
---
I know it‚Äôs sarcasm but how do you know it‚Äôs ash?
---
"Finally a worthy opponent" tachanka
---
Even in casual too
---
Yeah that just happened to me
---
Any news about the embarassing ddos attacks?
---
Maybe time to change your cell phone service provider
---
Level 92 and I don‚Äôt own frost, lion, or clash. Literally no interest in playing them
---
Lol ye
---
that pulse one looks awesome. all of then do!
---
Maybe
---
There is a glitch with her that she can go into the floor. This makes her move a lot faster and she can‚Äôt be shot but she can shoot you. It would automatically win the round if you did it correctly
---
It also seemed to go off right after he pulled his sensor out and put it away. Maybe that animation was stuck and caused the C4 not to explode?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me with how many other operator glitches there are in the game.
---
I don't see anyone...
---
Just watch his other clips, you will find out real fast.
---
Why do you walk around like a terrorist hunt ai but also clap 2 people. It hurts me.
---
good guy C4!
---
He's showing the end of the scoreboard which must make Ash the last operator to the right. Which is always where your operator is.
---
That's a downvote for me cap
---
Yeah probably
---
On console yes
---
Oh rip
---
Do you have a clue as too why?
---
Eh I usually play rushing with any op
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!
---
Last season my placement rank was silver 2 but now its bronze 3
---
they def dont in my experience

Praise be

Want me to send a vid?

Yes

You might wanna reply to him. You just kinda replied to urself.
---
Fucking broken ass game
---
Also (not OP) I've had ping up to 1,800
---
It‚Äôs nice that the ubi is taking out the ops if there is a bug. But they need to fix the glitches faster
---
They can't disable any of the core ops, according to UBI.
---
I hope you dont get duplicates x300 like i fucking did
---
Better than nothing
---
Thats nice
---
I do what I want bud. If you don't like them, don't watch them lmao.
---
&gt; My entire reasoning is that the entire system is flawed, why? BECAUSE YOU CAN‚ÄôT SEE AN ENEMY WHEN THEY CAN SEE YOU,IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM BEFORE BUT IT IS NOW.
---
You're not say why that's a flaw when that's exactly what should happen. If you are too close to a corner you can see less around that corner, someone who is further away will have better vision.
---
&gt;The current system is fundamentally flawed because you should always be able to see each other‚Äôs heads when facing each other. 
---
Why? That's simply not true.
---
Yes. Since you killed all 5 it‚Äôs an ace. An ace doesn‚Äôt mean you have to win the round just kill the entire opposition
---
Im not only mute main yes!!!!
---
Hello NooseHangler, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c3cyno/ash_phase/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Agreed
---
Gridlock has done me very fine in ranked when I play her.  Shit you can solo plant.
---
Dude, this kind of stuff kills me!
---
A couple of nights ago I point blanked somebody with the 590A1 while they planting the diffuser. Like, legit had my barrel in his face and it still didn't kill him.
---
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but they're just too inconsistent to know.
---
Danm wish I knew this, I‚Äôve gotten 3 over the past couple nights but just accepted it
---
Shes been out for like 2 weeks.
---
You mean you don‚Äôt want a Tachanka body pillow?
---
Yes, you're right. Since secure area was removed it's so boring to play ranked. In my opinion there should be more than just one gamemode. Just bring back the matchmaking preferences. Of course I should expect to wait longer to find a match when I only choose one of three gamemodes. I don't like bomb mode and only played secure area. Please bring back secure area and let us choose what we want to play in ranked, don't force us to play only bomb mode.. it sucks..
---
He was like fine I‚Äôll do it myself
---
Every single game studio: hit reg is very important we should keep making it better and more accurate
---
Ubisoft: but what if           no?
---
I think the rod should be reduced. I understand its a shot gun but HOLY SHIT there are just so many elas now that just get salty in ranked and run shotty that it makes me sad, mad, and piss, shit and cum.
---
That was the only one that was acceptable
---
Because its cheating and gives an unfair advantage to k&amp;m not hard to understand why.
---
Yes it is how the game is ment to be played witch is why its an unfair advantage.
---
If you can not see this then you are a lost cause..
---
UBI finally banned her
---
Yesterday I noticed a lion on my team that appeared to be visually glitching, going in and out of invisibility, and his gun was separate from his body about 2 or 3 meters. the gun was floating while the player was shooting it. The player did not have the gun in his hands.  it was really strange. not sure how that happened. was in favela if that matters.
---
That's a good black ice to get cus a lot of operators have that gun. The gun itself is kind of eh. 7/10
---
READ THE PATCH NOTES JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
---
It's bug maybe
---
Ughhh I actually liked it
---
If you think recruit has the best fragging power I have a bridge to sell you.
---
What would you do with the other 3 rounds?
---
Nope, last time they took claymores in general out. At least they learned and only banned the troublemaker.
---
Pick and ban in ranked is already a terrible idea. We don't need map voting too. I love playing Chalet and Skyscraper, heck all of those maps and it would suck to never see some maps anymore because no one votes for them.
---
Chill out fucking cunt I don‚Äôt understand retard. Say it in English
---
With the context of R6, yeah. 
---
What bothers me is the Facebook and 9gag part. You know the people on Facebook are sharing this thinking it's a genuinely good idea and not just a joke.
---
He has the best shotgun on attack
---
I‚Äôd love a vanilla playlist every now and again.
---
Something seen as so difficult, done so swift
---
I originally posted this video here under the the name ‚ÄúUsing Mouse and Keyboard on PS4‚Äù which was untrue and I did it just for clicks.  I realize that was a scummy move so I decided to re-post with a normal name.  Sorry.
---
Echo has a glitch?
---
Secure is a lot better for those who play solo for sure.
---
never happened to me on xbox or ps4 and I have to many hours on the both of them to be proud of
---
$150 dollars?
---
I'm not 100% sure if it's for all their player but I have to guess it is.   
---
just wanted to say nice work Ubisoft.
---
Its gone now in the new patch
---
they just need to make the purple tarps "transparent" or anti-collision or whatever so that
---
Could you try to figure out her name too? I believe she's a lost Bosak sister.
---
&gt; Coastline
---
&gt; * Fixed - There is a new way to get on the purple tarp.
---
At this point, they may as well just put some stairs up so at least they'll know how people are getting up there.
---
Lowest (excluding warden)‚Äîcastle 2hrs/gridlock 30m
---
Highest‚Äî Vigil 32 hrs/Ying 24 hrs
---
Yes, and im asking if theyve elaborated on that at all. I hate when people pull the "as a game developer" line, but as a game developer i just dont see any possible way that that becomes a thing to the extent where removing the character from multiple seasons of play is the best way to go. Which is why it seems to me this is either extreme laziness, incompetence, or an extremely weird quirk of their engine that makes it not so simple to debug collision. The third being something id want to hear from developers on, but still not something worth removing an entire character from two season on.
---
These take less than 20 minutes to make yet that get so much fucking karma on this sub its insane.
---
It‚Äôs a lot better now than before the rework. Now if you die from skylight it‚Äôs because you were peeking or careless. There‚Äôs 2 new areas overlooking the bomb site from the top now, there‚Äôs no need to be under the skylight
---
Get your mom to translate it for you then she speaks it
---
I was just warning someone about the possibility of this happening
---
There all bad lmfao
---
You're dumb as fuck
---
If you mean that orange image with the shield then no, thats just an old reddit post.
---
Hey Cxer kid. You want me to get your account suspended? Say the magic word, I have reddit admins on speed dial. I can get you shut down like that.
---
Ubisofts store or other official vendors.   
---
Etsy, you might find something but they can be told to close at any time and you likely wont get your money back. Also qaulity isnt guaranteed.
---
I can understand cab but blitz no, people just don‚Äôt know how to deal with him
---
Detailed in patch notes
---
When I saw you got the right amount of e's I was impressed
---
My wallet: "A big fucking hole coming right up!"
---
They are handling the situation badly but its best to ban the ops until the issue is resolved although we players are sort of left in the dark in the process
---
"Rarely uses gadgets"  is a self proclaimed twitch main and doesnt use ash?
---
Like me, i dont use one in casual, u know it‚Äôs casual.
---
But if it were just sent to Ubisoft, how long until it actually got handled? By sharing it to social media, the issue becomes more high vis and thus higher priority.
---
Yes please fren
---
Ok. Now i know why u are complaining. U are bunch of sensitive snowflakes who get offended being called a newbie. Lmao.
---
Yeah, valkyrie and hibana's gadgets are so simple.
---
Problem is when Dokk gets the cams usually attackers have shot them all out anyway.   
---
Its nice for the bulletproof cams/Maestro but  overall I think the operator Idea could work.
---
Her gun and ability is so nice though
---
How would you nerf cav? Take away her silent step?
---
A teacher worth talking about.
---
Valk makes sense for a game like siege, I didn't want to touch on Y1S4 too much lol
---
No, its just that i put them away because i made these for a project, i found 'em while digging through old stuff
---
I just ned 3 more floes in ranked aand then i gett it
---
Ty
---
Id probably make the reveal time after an interrogation shorter
---
We deserve fixes and a heavy hand from ubisoft to exploiters, Leavers, Boosters, Throwers and cheaters.
---
Yep I lost a lot of Elo bc of the iq and clash glitch
---
Bandit = yes  
---
Ela = depends on map like for example coastline no   
---
Finka = no   
---
Hibana = headgear no but her uniform makes her look more noticeable but not that significant   
---
have them all and i have the full ela set, finka uniform, hibana uniform and headgear equipped.
---
Just play terrorist hunt.
---
Go on do it the. Does your dad also work at xbox
---
Totally agree, Echo has been absolutely insane ever since he got two Yokais. Even with one he was insane he was just easier to shut down because you only had one drone to worry about.
---
As for scary woman, she‚Äôs so easily countered and her weapons are pretty lacklustre, like all you have to do is stay with someone and you‚Äôre pretty much safe.
---
Well the cool lookin gadgets are kinda required for ubi to attract more players and sell some season passes
---
oh you're right...
---
I understand the character shouldnt be allowed to be played while exploitable or broken.
---
Im just amazed that this company looked at all the options and chose "lets just not let people play her"
---
No I'll just report his acconut hahaha
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
And yes, she was. It was in their data. They took away her ACOG as they didn't want to kill the whole operator. And yes, it did bother the rushers as her pickrate dropped.
---
I think R6 just needs an operation helth 2.0
---
It would just give the Ubi devs some time to relax and get their stuff together with all these glitches. Yes, I inderstand it is a complicated game but I dont think we need more content rn, because with that new content, comes with new glitches.
---
Ubi has many things to do, and a whole 3 months to just simply improve the player experience would be delightful, to me at least.
---
Downvote me all you want but this is just what I think r6 needs.
---
Play terrorist hunt.
---
Still no idea at all of when we can expect clash back?   
---
Next .X patch, next season?
---
*Reverse Friendly Fire has been activated*
---
What are you talking about? Did they take IQ out or not?
---
Oh really? Damn that sucks, I was probably at 95 or so so it would‚Äôve sucked if I continued to go for it.
---
I missed a glorious opportunity, thank you
---
You can demanding that they give you a booster every time there‚Äôs some downtime or glitches is being entitled.
---
How do we find her weight now?
---
At least they've gone from making the new ops OP at launch to giving them cool gadgets.
---
*laughs in lion*
---
how the frost mat didnt clap you is beyond me, the hitbox on those things...
---
I've done it once or twice for challenges. Is it good to learn how to aim? If so thank you, I'll try it out.
---
Just aim at their heads 4Head! 
---
no but for real: just play a lot. it all comes with time. T-hunt helps a lot as well but is kind of boring for some people.
---
Learn the maps like the back of your hand and practice your aim in terrorist hunt
---
Only he wouldn't be active gameplay, instead you'd plan an action then hit go and he'd execute.
---
IQ is now completely banned. Even in Terror hunt.
---
=))))
---
FANTA.
---
mouse and key broad mate
---
Thats fucking sick. Gotta go check my email.
---
The biggest implication of this change is we can now play other games! The problem with aim acceleration is that it takes SO MUCH muscle memory to get good, the moment you step away and play something else you will spend hours or days trying to get used to Siege again. This is why I was always terrified of playing other games. Now I can play them without fear!
---
I literally practiced speed running up to that boss. The boar skip was easier than that fuck.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs super easy to fix bugs and glitches.
---
Meanwhile my KD is 3.0
---
the old skylight was also right above a side, was it op? logic right here
---
Dude... what if for a limited time Halloween mode, Ubisoft made a hide and seek/manhunt map that's really dark where one person is Nokk and they have to find and melee the other team? Maybe the hiders can even be certain trap defenders to slow/hurt her, like Ela and Lesion. I would play the hell out of this.
---
^ Found the asshole
---
smurfs
---
No he is just a popular character too ban
---
It is an ace bcs you killed all 5 enemies.
---
2nd
---
Ya I only use it during drone round and only throw the second one if I press the wrong button 
---
I just use sounds to locate enemys
---
This is some spawnpeeking level 300 Doc main energy right here
---
Not to come at you or anything but you realize Rainbow has made $1billion right? Why do you think they still support it nearly five years later. This game is growing every day and is making tons of money
---
Like I said, *if they've given it to us in the past, it's not being entitled*, I haven't played Siege for much time but if they've done it before, it's not being entitled. If you develop a standard, your players will expect such a standard. I'm not sure what you're missing here.
---
Im not being toxic, u are just being dumb. Read it properly. Stop being a sensitive snowflake who gets easily offended from a non-offensive term such as "newbie". No wonder trolls like to pick on u. Sad.
---
New glitch
---
Should of shot through the floor YOLO
---
Tachanka finally did it!
---
Your teammates are just bad. Neither should be banned because both are easy to counter. With ranked being Bomb there‚Äôs no reason for a Blitz rush and usually  Blitz gets picked off pretty easily. People need to realize it‚Äôs bomb only now, ban ops who are used better in bomb like Nomad, Lion, Capitao, Echo, Mira, Monty. People just ban ops they suck against which means when I go plant and get denied by Echo, or go to diffuse only for Lion to ping me all because my team wanted to rush obj and not look out for Cav
---
No deagle wtf
---
Just dont play it again
---
shooter = pc
---
Decent bro! Should try draw one of the Ops
---
It is handled both ways, obviously. As i explained, the youtubers who were sharing these glitches are giving it publicity which is good and bad. Its good because, as you said, sharing it to social media does give it visibility, which would also give it higher priority which would increase Ubi's response time. Its bad, however because, although the youtubers  do go,
---
*hur dur, Ubi needs to fix this glitch, hur dur, link in the description to r6 fix hur dur*
---
Im going to go out on a limb and say that not too many of the millions of viewers are actually going there and reporting the issues, most of them are just going to use it so they can beat the opponents and gain elo.
---
Gotta try drunken game once in a while I think
---
I‚Äôm sure reddit admins take your reports very seriously I‚Äôm absolutely shaking please have mercy
---
Thermite was born with glasses, he didnt buy them.
---
If only they had an op that could directly counter his flash... someone preferably with a sweet stache lol
---
I just love how this kid got shouted and the one who shout him got a high point.
---
Because glitchy
---
You do know that every time a new set of operators are out they get barely-reskinned for their other outfits right? She'll get better ones eventually but Mozzie's was just a hardly-recolored helmet and Alibi's was a different colored beret.
---
**Laughs in R6 credits**
---
It‚Äôs her fricking glitch with claymore
---
Yep they announced today that she will be banned on ps4 and Xbox one
---
They will drop an update for consoles 27th only
---
On the 27th
---
What kinda pants you got that can fit that T H I C C B O I
---
I wonder what the top left image is.  It seems to be that some kind of fiery hot residue is leftover.
---
Could this be one of the S4 ops?
---
Wow the other died to the nitro cell
---
Well that‚Äôs your opinion and I respect that we all have our own things that we like and things that we don‚Äôt like
---
learn a new op.
---
Looks like your gun is jammed
---
Then you can‚Äôt speak for all Console players ‚Äúeveryone would stop playing‚Äù. 
---
I do not own a M&amp;K, no. 
---
M&amp;K is cheating right now. It could just as easily not be cheating if they allowed it for everyone
---
I already started getting tired of goddamn dropshots again. Luckily they fixed it relatively quickly.
---
What was the question?
---
Solo queuing
---
You gotta level up without earning any renown
---
Consulate is my least favorite. 
---
Clubhouse is my favorite.
---
I mean you could do that, but Chanka's whole gimmick is being a big burly Russian man with an LMG. Giving him a technical gadget to operate would kind of seem unfitting for his character. Especially givin the fact that he has a face mask that is supposed to be protecting him while he mans a big ass gun. Trying to keep him in character is probably the most important part in my opinion.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have money to pour into a pc
---
Personally it‚Äôs never happened to me and I‚Äôve played for a good amount of time.
---
Inspect element?
---
YOU ARE LITERALLY ON REDDIT MY GUY
---
Favorite: bank
---
Least: hereford
---
Tower least favorite
---
Coastline most favorite
---
The issue is there is an incentive to just chase frags. It's in the scoreboard where you can see your kill/death that match compared to everyone else. There is in your overall K/D when people click your username.
---
There is very little incentive to actually play support and team-based operators. All that will happen is you get flamed by your team for not getting enough kills.
---
No i didnt
---
People like this just deserve to get their hard drives riddled with a thousand trojan horse viruses.
---
Seeing you before you see them? If I can put my bets on something it would be lag? Or pure damn luck?
---
For those unfamiliar, this is a desync. It happens from time to time, although they're occurring more lately.
---
If I had to guess, the server thought Pulse was still holding his Cardiac Sensor and therefore refused to let him detonate the nitro cell. Once he flipped back, it popped and the last attacker happened to be in the right place.
---
I didn't get one :C
---
Point taken.
---
You are playing blitz that's the first problem
---
In fact, that's an almost surefire way of making it take *more* time.
---
Bro you can get a PC that will play siege for 300 if you put some Tim into it
---
Favorite: Oregon
---
Least: favela
---
Theres many factors to that,  which includes: 
---
A. Your skill vs opponents skill. (ie. Your peeking too wide or they already holding an angle or know that that's an common spot etc)
---
B. Enemy simply has better callouts, (they know your there already from intel.)
---
C. Aim. (It happens to all of us)
---
Holographic vortex my man
---
What? They could just allow it on console like fortnite does. 
---
I can already plug in my M&amp;K directly into the PS4 and it allows me to play fortnite like that. Ubi could allow it on their game, but they chosen not to.
---
There's currently a perspective phenomenon that reveals part of people's head before they can see around the corner like real life (see this https://youtu.be/1NTf2A0Y8dM for more). In ranked there are also quite a few cheaters and hackers. Prefiring and holding angles is also a possibility, and you've just had bad timing
---
Don‚Äôt do it............
---
that's how it's spelled are you high?
---
Smoother gameplay and FPS on pc , if you aiming for high level or pro league then pc controller etc all depends on players skill
---
Message the enemy players and ask if they can help you get the trophy
---
Why though? Is it because of the muscle memory you developed before Grim Sky recoil changes?
---
I also don‚Äôt have money in general, and i don‚Äôt know anyone named Tim
---
I like this. Easy to read and informative. I really appreciate trying to get pro league more exposure on the sub, y'all are making a good start with these.
---
The description is also a mile long and the link is at the very end.
---
just let him play for like two minutes
---
I like tower and theme park.
---
I know what he means.
---
That doesn't give you a free pass to cheat.
---
Still no new deployable shields or Clash? This dev team is a fucking joke. Did Ubi take all of the competent ones and force them to work on their newer games or what? Seems like the people left over are the ones who rode on the shortbus while in school.
---
Autocorrect
---
How'd ya make em?
---
Football fields per church?
---
But that‚Äôs $300 you‚Äôd use for other things (Games, add ons, essentials for living). It‚Äôs really not worth it when they could allow M&amp;K on console.
---
it doesn't matter it's going off of data limits why they can't add new guns and for balance reasons, I love new guns but I get annoyed each season that I can't equip previous season camos to the new operators guns, And the selection for camos for the new guns is low.
---
different teams genius the artists designing the skins arent gonna fix the bugs thats not their job
---
Does ps4 players took ?
---
Copper is red now?
---
I never said I used m&amp;kb on console, I‚Äôm a gamepad pleb who uses an elite controller (which is actually really nice)
---
We have to see how thicc she is
---
Precisely
---
I want to get inside the objectif faster and I don't want to rappel... this gadget is more tactical and situational...if you played Siege you will understand what i said
---
I played her at 7 in the morning and she‚Äôs gone now apperantly. Too bad since she‚Äôs one of my most played operators and I also had her elite skin.
---
No one said they were cheating or condone doing it? I don‚Äôt have the $90-$200 adapter to even play siege with a M&amp;K
---
Ubi won't allow it and I agree it shouldn't be allowed I know how much better PC players are I use a controller on pc and I'm silver I use my mouse and keyboard I'm plat
---
r/woooosh
---
Don't really have a favourite map but I know I hate tower
---
Solo queuing in a nutshell
---
Starting the game with 2 players on a team then ending up with 5 for example
---
I don‚Äôt see toxicity this bad on pc and I‚Äôve always seen Xbox has more toxicity
---
Same ...
---
I know that often times it‚Äôs hard to tell where the enemy is 100% and it takes some time to get used to sound in r6s. If your Astros have a mix amp then you might want to look up tutorials and play around with it until it‚Äôs comfortable. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell where the sound originates from and it takes getting used to for example when I first got the headset I have now I found it hard to tell the difference between footsteps in front and footsteps behind me and I also found it hard to tell where enemies were based on footsteps above me but after a while I got used to it and was able to distinguish the origin of the sound based on my environment and game sense. I know this is probably not the answer you wanted but don‚Äôt give up until you find a setting that works for you.
---
That... Is really really dumb
---
On the bright side you can get 5 levels sooner than it takes for an old man to piss
---
Actually I think if you have him do the situations he'll get to 5 *and* have a little bit of learning experience
---
Just because it works in Fortnite doesn't mean it'll work in Siege.
---
Also, Fortnite is on the other end of the spectrum, Siege is all about headshots and aim, it's not fair for controller users to go up against a MnK.
---
You don't seem to understand what you're trying to say here, play PC, otherwise you're cheating.
---
End of discussion.
---
Then that‚Äôs on you if you choose to play with a controller. A lot of people are already using it on console. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to play a ranked match plat 2+ without facing M&amp;K users.
---
[you guys clearly dont actually know where it comes from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkLUOuE_-5I)
---
pinging u/Prototype223 as well
---
It's about half and half. People have bad days or bad rounds and they take it out on people on their own team. Theres no wrong way to play siege, just have fun and play how you want.
---
Adding to a problem never solves a problem, it's as clear cut as that. Also I've stated manny times that it's not ubis fault.
---
Guys, after every single nvidia driver update, check to see if DSR's are enabled. Right click desktop, go to nvidia, then manage 3d settings and look for dsr. If you see it saying its enable  click the drop down and uncheck everything. Even with a 2080, and 4x checked it will chug and crash your system. Uncheck every box, and reboot. Check again to see if its enabled again. If not launch game and check.

Coastline my favourite, Hereford my least favourite

So defenders could use it they should have done the pistol

He walks up the stairs like ‚Äúman this some bullshit‚Äù

i agree

That should help more I'd say

been gold 1 and 2 previous seasons but this season I'm in copper 1 it's such a bad season for me and I've been trying for ages to get plat lmao
---
i‚Äôm on pc
---
I got vote kicked for pulling an ace one time... people are just garbage in general
---
Have y'all played Black Mesa, a remake of Half Life? This reminds me of the late-game section where you go through a building full of traps and have to dodge them so the whole place doesn't blow up.
---
O yeah you can‚Äôt do it on pc
---
I used to do this all the time never gets old
---
I have nearly 2000 hours on PC and I've never even heard of this before.
---
Most toxic gaming community? Boy you sure missed the good old Modern Warfare 2 days on the Xbox 360. Found out my mom was a slut AND a pedophile with how many kids said they fucked her that were under the age of 12.
---
How can you get that skin form godlynoob?
---
It instantly kills,like all melee's in that game. However the start-lag is what makes it difficult
---
Terrorist strats are good
---
Yep. You can even kill an enemy by vaulting through the window if the enemy is under it üòÇ
---
I'm leaving if Im on the enemy team. Nobody should have that level of stupidity.
---
"I don't have money for a PC" is such a shit argument. That's equivalent to me saying "I don't have time to get good aim" and just use aimbot
---
lets just rename the skin and call it "a gift" and remove the logo, plenty of OP's with the same weapons have the same skins.... these are the same weapon...
---
If u mean spawn peek then I‚Äôm good because I absolutely hate getting killed in the first second of a round
---
Some games my connection is fine but then I'll play the next game and my connection is shit, so I don't know what's going on either. My interest is fine btw
---
I am fine with controllers, grew up with them, but competitive wise I am just better with kbm on pc.
---
This only happens if you let Geforce Experience auto optimize settings for your games.
---
I am running an AMD system, not nvidia. Should have stated that in that post, sorry.
---
It‚Äôs still on Xbox I did it today it just looks very spammy
---
You can buy them for 25k, it will be a few months before they are reduced
---
Not great, not terrible
---
Switch
---
Uhm what? Sry I dont understand what you are trying to say
---
Just verified them and it came back as several corrupt files. I repaired them and I will try to launch it now.
---
Awwwww shit here we go again...

Most of the hated maps have good reason.  To pick on Hereford, Ubi really screwed up the map design.  Good maps (particularly good large maps) have visual distinction between the various areas of the map.  By that I mean that different areas of the map look different.  On maps like Villa or Bank, it is immediately clear from a screenshot where a player is.  Because there is only one area of the map that looks like that.  This makes maps much easier to learn and to make callouts on.  A big part of the reason Hereford feels so bland is that you move from square grey-green room to grey-green hallway with 90 degree angles to grey-green stairs (with, you guesses it, 90 degree angles).  To be fair, as with Tower, this might have been a proof of concept for a concept that just doesn't work (trying to create spooky atmosphere).

I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs the equivalent of a vector burst to the chest
---
Mute acts like a frost trap for him and he just gets downed and has to be dragged out of range by teamates
---
Yea I did I switched to a smoke/BB main
---
F üò≠
---
When was the Master (gold) achievement added? I've been gold since blood orchid and just got the achievement this season..yet my brother has had it since some time in 2018
---
Yup lol
---
It is possible to make a bad map. And if anyone knows how to play them, it would be the pros. I've never seen a pro say Hereford or fortress is a good map
---
Its fun running at god speed and crouch spamming
---
Yeah its fucking annoying
---
The trick is to lul them into thinking you're passive. Line up the headshot and whip out your pistol.
---
I was playing modern warfare at the time someone threatend to boot me offline if i didnt clutch
---
She is not a fragger. All they need to do is sneak on the enemy and get close enough. Their pro league aim will easily get them the headshot they need at close range to confirm the kill.
---
Looks good man, i make them myself too. What program did you use to draw your icons. Here's my Lion [https://imgur.com/a/Vbyus4v](https://imgur.com/a/Vbyus4v)
---
I agree this is me too , but at least we can stand up to ourselves now .
---
Holy Shit Kid a good chunk of rainbows devs got moved to breakpoint to work on Breakpoint and probaly quarantine complain all you want but at the end day your still playing the game your calling shitty
---
The aim animation completely throws me off I cannot get used to it.
---
Naw PC, did it few times before tho.
---
It‚Äôs like in round 5 he had to Handle fuse thermite lion finka and jackal
---
I just want Clash back :(
---
My fatass thought the bottom left one was toast
---
what about a good looking charm like a chibi
---
yes hopefully
---
True very true but they are just the pros just because they don‚Äôt like a map doesn‚Äôt mean its unbalanced kinda like pengu and the headshot mechanic that he constantly says he hates it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs just someone‚Äôs opinion
---
It feels better after getting our asses whooped three rounds in a row because when you switch side you can just blame the fact that your team or the map just favors one side or the other. Plus it‚Äôs just familiar to me because I‚Äôve played csgo in the past.
---
oof
---
r/OutOfTheLoop
---
whas dis?
---
Yee
---
Yeah theyre running out of fucking ideas
---
Maybe one day I‚Äôll get to one of these in time
---
Jw how did you go from jackal and cav to smoke and bb?
---
my email
---
.....you died every match....and lucked out on 1 kill with a suicide and a hostage kill.  All of your teammates voted to kick you..... but you avoided the kick and in the final round..... was afk near the spawn....getting a beer.....and was the only one left.....you proceeded to immediately get downed....and teabagged until completion of the opposing sqaud
---
I can‚Äôt downvote too lmao
---
Sure, your personal opinion.
---
Hmmm seems like they really care about this game huh? If they get rid of half the devs. Breakpoint looks fine but oh by God quarsntine will be dead in a month. Especially with its concept and how it already looks. If it looks that bad in cgi, i wonder how it'll look on siege's out dated engine. I mean come on, they already fucked up Ela's face. When they alresdy have their model.
---
a "little" and proceeds to put his watermark on yours.
---
me too brother
---
By giving him an even more busted and OP version of an Ult they had to smash with the nerf bat in the past.
---
True but I need to get it from ubisoft. Need to do some research.
---
Honestly at this point the people who bought clash should just get reimbursed at this point.
---
A) I don‚Äôt think anyone cares if I gamethrow in a five stack.
---
B) ...huh?
---
I have a shotgun you idiot
---
That is nice. Hope you like it.
---
I'm not to my knowledge
---
I thought I was the only one. It takes me a while to do well in Siege if I'm coming from another fps.
---
Im down a full ass rank usually gold cant even stay in silver its just one BS  thing after another and now valk is op thanks to IQ being banned not to mention where exactly is clash this season, taking the deployable shields on a vacation orrr?
---
Thanks
---
They should at least make a R6Fix subreddit
---
I get fps drops every update. Usually down to 80-90, then when mid season patches come in it goes back up to 120
---
This sub has devolved into crappy cosplay karma whoring and funny xD moments
---
They're just obnoxious ops to deal with, even if jackal has a low win Delta I still find it super infuriating that some foot fetishist is sniffing my toes from across the map and it forces me to stop whatever I'm doing and hide lest I get wallbanged
---
Very old
---
Really
---
I like how you can hear the zombie in the well
---
This game desperately needs operation health 2
---
I think the 3 round rotation also allows you to learn the play styles of your teammates and enemies much easier than with the 1 round rotation. I really like this change to ranked and hope they add it to casual later this year or early next year.
---
It's happened to me before
---
But there is no option saying that
---
I did the same thing with IQ except I didn't kill a single person because I am shit. I ran in firing wildly, grabbed the hostage and jumped out window. Lost like 80% of my health.
---
The highlight of my time playing R6S.
---
They also gave GSG9 jeans, jumpers and sneakers so....
---
Well I assumed that was because they were on ready status and called up
---
How long did this take!?
---
&gt;frustration on all sides gets increased
---
I mean, people ban jackal/echo/cav/blitz BECAUSE they're frustrating ops to play against, especially in solo queue where team coordination isn't usually enough to deal with these ops.
---
No it‚Äôs just a glitch with the nitro cell
---
Now that‚Äôs EPIC
---
Thats what ive been saying for a month
---
Honestly kinda sick charm
---
He did this on purpose, but I‚Äôd wait before doing your placements on PC. It‚Äôs pretty toxic and there‚Äôs a lot of hackers and throwers rn. Sucks when everyone starts in Gold IV in their placements because you might get teammates who are not up to par with players of that rank.
---
Mine would propably be like
---
"Remember your epic match on border?"
---
"You lost 0-3 truly heart breaking"
---
"Your best round was round 2, you got one assist"
---
"You died a total of 3 times on rounds 1, 2 and 3"
---
This game is such a shit show at the moment
---
As much as I think its a fun and wacky concept I just think that adding operators that aren't human might not fit into the game. I believe that his gadget is alright and could fit into a future operator but nothing that changes the meta at all.
---
I hope you take this light hearted its only my opinion in the hundreds of people who do like this concept.
---
It can even make gunshot noises but that  would be op
---
what lights?!
---
Congratulations. It gets a lot easier to hit plat after the first time.
---
SWAT team simulator.
---
Yeah i got that one some seasons ago
---
It doesn't, you are delusional, take yourself to infirmary.
---
lol, cav buff time
---
The legendary version is basically the same thing but 3D.
---
And it is really good at getting head shots
---
how
---
No, what are you doing, don't go closer he's got a shotgun.
---
STOP! HE HAS A SHOTGUN, JUST LEAN AROUND THE CORNER AND WAIT FOR HIM TO COME TO YOU.
---
#YOU FUCKING DUMBASS, I SAID HE HAD A FECKEN SHOTGUN, WHY DID YOU APROACH HIM
---
^My ^everyday ^siege ^experience
---
It's hard for new people to understand this game.  It  took me a long time to understand it and when it clicks you love it.
---
Ahhhh that‚Äôs the deal yes I was in gold and I was surprised because I kinda suck. Setting people up for failure by placing them too high seems really fucking silly
---
I think it came out with Para Bellum itself.
---
What about a motion sensor instead of a camera? Camera could still be good though.
---
Oh, I mostly am doing this for fun, I accept the idea that robots and aliens will probably not be showing up in Rainbow, I just like Battle Droids too much to not do this.
---
I was really excited when they announced they were giving skins instead of the charms, but now i miss the charms.
---
It did
---
thats fair enough and if i'm gonna be real with you, you did great at the pictures and videos. How did you do it?
---
playing with friends may also make a difference, I've lost a few games with 2 other friends but we still had a lot of fun during the matches
---
Maybe next season, but I‚Äôm glad that we aren‚Äôt getting those trash charms anymore lmao
---
It's a game where operators have unique abilities such as shooting through a solid shield, turning invisible and they are able to cover their head with a metal shield while still being able to see through it
---
Airjab is pretty much a motion sensor.  But single use
---
I don't get it. Am I disabled?
---
I mean, i can kinda understand why they would cheat. It's an easy way to get a huge advantage over your opponent, with no repercussions since ubisoft themselves stated that they wouldn't ban these types of cheaters.
---
Soo they're letting these people destroy the competitive aspect of this game, and letting them get away with it scot free.
---
When ever the pack thing happens to me I re log and get it. Hope this helps.
---
Y video on m0bil no ever wurcc? Much syk
---
On the main subreddit screen you can click the 3 dots then click add flair and choose.
---
Lol
---
God I wish. Im slowly becomimg a Kapkan/fuze main though. I was never good with their gadgets
---
Hello daniel_0066, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c3fyzh/fix_this/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I mean the only reason why he didnt die the first time was because you have a suppressor on so your gun would have been at 25 damage. Also when you're in DBNO state you get 20 hp. And since you shot him in his leg that means that there was a damage reduction.
---
But this one wouldn‚Äôt impede defenders at all. It could still be destroyed, can‚Äôt ID defenders, and moving slowly past it won‚Äôt set it off.
---
I mean their gadgets are more luck than skill
---
Most people with common sense just restart after a couple of minutes and don't waste time posting in here
---
I seriously don't want any new ops until the game is fixed and in a good state,even if takes a year
---
Reeeeefunnndd
---
it's within IQ herself . otherwise claymores will be disabled again if people discovered other glitches with it
---
Isn't Thatcher English and thus a limey himself?
---
U press ESC and then "quit to the main menu" happend to me sometimes and that's the only solution from time to time it will load but most of the time it doesn't
---
yh true but say Thank You to all the Glitching Players :/
---
Why did I not get one
---
Lol console
---
How can you spot it out I'm not sure what the signs are
---
It‚Äôs the truth I ran into one on pc
---
Implying you want anything but the Rainbow is Magic rainbow VSN skin?  Damn dirty heathen.
---
It's almost like there's a search bar
---
Glad I'm not just going crazy.
---
16675 fired 0 connect tho wtf? Magic bullets that don't exist
---
I'll complain about it
---
Everyone hates blitz?
---
I know, Just found it funny...We won 4-0...unsurprisingly.
---
You just have to leave, there‚Äôs no salvaging a frozen match
---
Have you considered it's not the DMRs?
---
I mean you can't abuse 1 shot headshots with high rof with his rifle you actually have to aim to get hs's with him so probably that's why he said that
---
hey i‚Äôm confused on this, can somebody explain
---
It's never happened to me once and that was a few days ago, I play PC.
---
Red doot gang
---
His bullets came out the clip and hit them, no firing needed
---
Sadly no as that is a bit of a pain in the ass to do on Xbox.
---
Oh fuck do I not miss working at Timmys
---
S    M    H
---
there is nothing thats glowing
---
The fucking chances,that my game id is there.
---
NEW OP IDEA
---
Probably bronze or silver ,cuz only they don't know how to fight a monty
---
Someone messaged me after I won and I aced their team and called me a bot camping in a corner with a shotgun, like bro you prolly do that too. He had really bad grammar and was insulting me, yet also claimed to be a parent and Harvard graduate. Sure bud, sure
---
Um ok, that is heresy.
---
So how‚Äôd it turn out
---
Yes there is
---
Just finished a 5v2, feels kinda silly getting rewarded for winning it. I'm guessing server issues cause I don't wanna believe that some one on my team was doing something sketchy at silver rank.
---
Causal rape jokes ! Fucking nice
---
I think it's silent only on client-side, which means  your test is correct
---
Good job!
---
LMAO was it [this one?](https://youtu.be/OMGY23AleHs)
---
Lmfaoooo oh brother
---
Mine goes to spam
---
Don't you mean shoting
---
Probably because losing to coppaaassss
---
Ddoser were either on your team or you got trolled by the other team.
---
No shit üòÇI just didn‚Äôt edit
---
ya I thank you
---
Just throwing it out here, you're a goddamn traitor. Active in both r/hydrohomies and r/coffee
---
This is getting forwarded to the council of r/hydrohomies
---
this.... does put a smile on my face
---
Yeah, and they do suck. Why would i take a weapon that fires one shot when i could take one that fires 50 in one second. In a game about headshots with a fast TTK full auto will always be king, no matter how you play (who tf uses twitches dmr over the famas?)
---
I really wanted this skin for the AR33.
---
Yea I keep it high because it makes it easier to see people like cav In darker corners. Also my tv is an old HD tv so quality isn‚Äôt the best
---
Thanks, the only one that I was missing for a while is getting Frag Grenade kills with Thermite.
---
Spawn peaking
---
so essentially what you‚Äôre trying to say is that you‚Äôre an ash main
---
Just throw them at the enemy
---
She's banned again :((((((
---
I really think Warden can be buffed in a few ways 
---
He can be made a 2 speed
---
He can be give different weapons, my ideas would be the mp5k or clash's smg 
---
His ability could function like Caveira, vigil and Nokk where he doesn't need to completely recharge it every time
---
Okay well clearly I work at a Tim Hortons. And I‚Äôm more active in r/HydroHomies. 
---
Do what you want. But I personally don‚Äôt drink Coffee.
---
Rip iq mains üò≠
---
they would sell a lot more skins if they hired better artists. siege is like Apex Legends. cutting off their own potential by not having the top tier talent
---
It's not an intentional game mechanic
---
I hope u won. It would be embarrassing to lose 5v2.
---
Use a 7.62 as a knife
---
*ubi fixes purple tarps*
---
Siege community: **Ah shit here we go again**
---
I‚Äôve had this glitch happen before, bad timing for a blitz to show up....
---
Eh, posted because I didn‚Äôt know about it and it was the smallest amount of funny.
---
ohhh
---
Bro, anyone else see how IQ almost missed those guys? Lucky she had the upper ground
---
Report him. I hate it when the game is ruined, for anyone.
---
Nah it‚Äôs GoodüòÇ At least I can play it
---
At least you don‚Äôt use mouse and keyboard on console! It‚Äôs really getting out of control. They think they‚Äôre so good. People really need to cheat to win. It‚Äôs super sad.
---
Hopefully get the 2 other people not queued with him to take turns TKing him with me
---
Not as op as it was previously before the update but still easy to tap on heads
---
OpFor as Opposing Forces instead of using terrorists vs counter terrorists
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA
---
I didn‚Äôt get anything
---
I don‚Äôt think you are getting them ‚Äúagain‚Äù, It seems like they have added them recently
---
No other drawing tool would make it this good
---
Oh ok that makes sense lol
---
Im in the break room of Tims lol'ing at this
---
üòÇ
---
Never got one üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
When I see something that says "collaboration with X" I was assuming it was a video montage and not just some text thrown on a white background.
---
Hey it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs no possible way to play keyboards and mouse on console (unlike pc)!
---
Ok, thanks
---
what is that brightness  holy fuck
---
Truly
---
Surprisedpikachu.jpg
---
When your c4 turns into a proximity mine/claymore
---
Tastes the same tbh
---
I agree, most of us have been asking that for a long time
---
WTF is a Cicada?
---
As a Mexican I don't know what the hell is that thing.
---
Oh that bag make him look fine
---
Invisibility / sorta intangibility. Pretty sure her body gets stuck at spawn where the claymore is
---
Oh u right didn‚Äôt see that lmao I‚Äôm blind
---
oh huh thx
---
She had a glitch that made her invisible last I heard. That's why claymores are banned. It was part of the glitch
---
The bullet should just disappear for siege because that‚Äôs accurate hit reg.
---
I call this piece "excessive leaning"
---
So they can ban claymores off of everyone Fine but can‚Äôt ban barbed wire off of clash?
---
Bruh moment
---
I mean it's cool but I feel like it would be worth it to budget more time and money for actually improving the game
---
Still one of my favorite jokes in gaming lolol
---
That‚Äôs the experience
---
!remindme 15 hours
---
Two quick questions. Do you play Xbox and is that your profile pic on Xbox?
---
Same hear dude, on the same day as well
---
Last time they just took away claymores
---
10/10 for style, how she gracefully pirouettes into a Kapkan trap.
---
You know, this is kinda cute honestly
---
But realistically only Thatcher uses that pistol (P226?) because he has no choice.
---
It‚Äôs 12 am and I just shit myself because of this vid, I was really not expecting that
