Would a more realistic look of the guy be without the beard cuz wouldn‚Äôt that interfere with the seal for the mask?
---
That‚Äôs a good point. It was only a plat lobby nothing interesting.
---
Is prefer 6969
---
Yep I must say the audio is so bad, I legit can‚Äôt hear where ppl are coming from
---
I have a firm belief that everyone is like 5% jager main otherwise he wouldn't have a 90% pick rate in ranked
---
im not even that kind but im feelin good because of all these nice comments. np
---
And you‚Äôre a dokk main wtf, I‚Äôll give it to you
---
He did... I am a homeless follower
---
Make it triple.
---
who
---
They should just give us both. give one the 552s reticle and the other the xps2-2 reticle.
---

---
We really need better modding in this game anyway.
---
I mean yeah I can't draw a cav with a non consistent angle but that shouldn't matter me being shit at drawing doesn't make him any better
---
Thatcher kinda looks like captain price (aka bravo 6) from cod
---
Niceee
---
If the devs don‚Äôt change it not only will I buy wamai but I‚Äôll buy year 5 season pass as soon as it‚Äôs announced. Pls ubi!
---
thank you. u know whats also amazing? you. and the fact that i cannot fucking sleep and its soon 1am
---
This style looks really good!!
---
I was dying laughing. I don't know how it worked out.
---
I think the next operators should be Gurkhas that would be awesome. They could be in Singaporean army, Indian army or British army again.
---
Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs a TV in Study Room on Villa
---
Yeah itd be blitz but can shoot back instead of needing to run to you.
---
someone else also commented about this. but i dunno man. i dunno what ubisoft was thinkin. maybe thatcher has his own tricks how he can wear the mask without shaving his beard off
---
They should give a free interrogation for every player who leaves after cav downs them
---
Yeah I can relate
---
As (an) ocean
---
o okay, never played cod but i will.
---
That's true. The issue is, if you have that kind of aim, you're better off with literally any other gun with a higher fire rate. If you can guarantee that one tap, you're better off with more bullets for after that first one if you need em.
---
Why didnt you just run up behind Zofia and punch her. Then go for the interrogation before she has a chance to react
---
Let me guess,F2P?
---
no problemo
---

Okay

Yes, I can‚Äôt wait...

thank you. i bet you look as good as this style
---
Facts

Then help support my YouTube lmao
---
Worst one is in Ranked where people will genuinely leave just to protect their K/D. 
---
Personally if you press the option to leave game, you should have a cooldown before you can rejoin it just to force people to stay in the game.
---
So that's why it's not a thing that looks disgusting
---
It's pretty fun, hope you enjoy it!
---
I could hear someone on the catwalk above, thats why i was kinda apprehensive about going for the interrogation
---
Yeah that or maybe their character stays for a while so you can interrogate or kill etc
---
Not to discredit your clutch but the other team was really bad.
---
The fuse was chasing you even though he had a shield, he could‚Äôve just stood still.
---
thx. cod stull gotta wait tho. i have 5+ games waiting for me to finish em
---
Tuxbird uploads like he forgot to pay taxes tho
---
Nice
---
Thanks üòÇüòÇ you too

I‚Äôm very disappointed, this is unacceptable... HE DIDN‚ÄôT KILL HIM/HER?!?!?!?!?!?

44 if I remember was the lowest on 1 armors

That's unfortunate

I was talking to my coworker about this last night, and we wouldn't have it any other way

Like a dark whiteish sort of color with hints of teal

Yeah legit, the people in these videos have to be koko the ape trying siege for the first time. Meanwhile people i play against are reciprocity tryouts with gaming chairs.

Used a source pic, then drew a bunch of triangles and applied colors. Basically a filter with extra steps

Doesn‚Äôt 1 shot 3 armors. And can‚Äôt one shot at ranges longer than 12m

Sick
---
I don't get the joke
---
I'm not sure if Ubisoft will be willing to take this route (i.e. switching one gun for another), but they seem to be okay with adding one more gun to an Operator's loadout. Mute's SMG-11 and Thatcher's shotgun come to mind.
---
None of the Spetsnaz ops have a machine pistol as a secondary option, so adding an SR-2 isn't a bad idea.

I can't see anywhere that says you have to comment on something being bad, actually you broke one of the rules of the subreddit "do not insult", since there was no constructive criticism given you technically broke the rule.

They will fear me
---
Yeh, they were really awful at that but I do think Doc and Cav might had been in a party. That or Caveira simply decided to anchor the objective and saw me by accident.
---
Believe me, that's only a shade of the nonsense people cook up. But this is witch hunting. You can't do that in this sub.
---
It's not bad.

We were talking about that the day we drew it we were like "What if this became l8ke the Tachanka elite" it would be amazing.

I can be on in 2 hours playing for 5 plus seasons my username is DubstepOnXBL I can teach you the basics like when to lean some map knowledge what operators are good on which map and stuff like that

Just cancel and  restart it like EVERYONE else. Works every time.

alight I didn‚Äôt mean but release this seems like with hunting something I should just keep to myself mb
---
Because bosg is a meme and it isnt going to he competitively viable whereas smg11 acog would break the meta.

At the beginning of the 5th round there was three people. Me, my friend and some random. My friend had to leave and then the random got spawn peeked and just left. I kind of carried this game though

And to continue what is your username?

Does Smoke's SMG-11 Meta during Year 1 rings any bell to you ?

That‚Äôs fucking awesome

[Yeah....like it's original content /s](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dxvhzb/every_single_time/)

Mute and Smoke are already balanced and good operators so no need to make them stronger and it also isn't needed on Sledge.

When you go on the store what does it tell you? Do you need to buy it again or it send you into your library?

It‚Äôs even funnier the tenth repost!
---
Just message me if you still need someone to play with I always like help getting new people into this game
---
Realistically shooting someone with a shotgun that close would immediately kill anyone (and much further ranges than portrayed in video games) but obviously no one wants realism in that regard
---
Impossible to do, miroirs are HELL to code in multiplayer games. Also you could just drone, it‚Äôs much simpler and doesn‚Äôt require an operator ability.
---
Flip the images and you get an accurate one
---
But the bar blocked your shots. That‚Äôs why it D i d n t
---
AR33 on thatcher. Someone commented 
---
The vast majority of the player base is in shit tier and has shitty aim. At ridiculously long ranges (peeking) the controllability and zoom would still stand over the mp7 for 60-70% of the player base
---
Also bandit should be spending time bandit tricking or such if you‚Äôre gonna be that sweaty killjoy meanwhile frost has traps that are best placed after the prep phase is over anyhow. 
---
And close up shotguns are king since they can bypass the need to ads and accurately aim at the head once again opting for ease.
---
So I say again if you use the zoom less mp7 over the theoretically zoomed C1 you‚Äôre an utter fool because you‚Äôre forcing yourself to spray headheight when you can precisely aim at the head or just shoot body shots with a lower recoil higher damage gun.
---

Yeah I may be a bit immature with internet comments but that's because I couldn't care any less than I do what, I do care about is people slandering my name and calling me a bad father

Gridlock is great for teamwork or solo queues because she has a very useful gadget and has carry god potential
---
You still have the problem of Xim users though. Because Xim fools the Xbox into thinking a controller is plugged in, those shitheads get aim assist with M+K support.
---
Was this in terrorist hunt
---
Because bum rushing is the single EASIEST strat to counter 
---
How can you call me game fast paced when literally everything on defense exists to slow you down? Lesion, Ela, maestro, alibi makes you think for an extra split second, clash the most annoying of them all, kaid who can deny hatches which bandit wasn't able to do for 4 years? I could go on, but you seem to be contradicting yourself by saying that the new ops make it fast paced while all their abilities are tuned to slow you down.
---
I can plug-in in FIRST PARTY HARDWARE like the Hori Tac Pro. Now what? And before you say it doesn't work with R6: It does. I have proof right here:

Will you accept that M+KB is no problem and perfectly fine to use? I KINDA doubt it. You will most likely come up with another excuse to tell yourself it is totally cheating. Despite that nobody was ever banned for it and no rule against it exists.

No, PvP
---
It is really easy to tell and there's a big difference in high sens controller and MnK so that guy is just salty.
---
If the cons outweigh the pros, then it is doing more harm than good. If it is removed, the harm is non-existent. I don't see why it should stay.
---
Weird. Me and my friends haven‚Äôt heard it since like season 1 lol.
---
I'm sure as hell not, so I guess op was just unlucky.
---
Your comparison is lacking. Try "Using a controller on PC" or "Using an Arcade stick on a console". You are trying to use an extremely biased comparison which does not work at all because you deem it cheating ... which simply it is not. A wallhack changes game behavior. An input device does not.
---
‚Äúdark whiteish‚Äù so a grey?
---
Then they'll have less to make money from next season.
---
Don't give this community ideas. They'll do anything!
---
If you think XIM and the likes are on par with native M+KB you should compare that stuff by trying it out yourself. Because they are not.
---
Wow. That is odd. It's defining still there.
---
welcome to ubisofts shitty game design
---
Ah yes I love democracy
---
You never hear about the pros of it because nobody ever talks about it. If you don't want to deal with it get a squad or play unranked or ranked. Hell you only need to play with one friend if you are salty about being kicked.
---
Girls: why cant guys pick up on our hints 
---
Girls hints:
---
Essentially but it has hint of teal which gives it more of a very light greenish grayish color
---
Maestro can sometimes get banned instead of echo, so I guess that could be a downside there. Personally I would say the new OPs or kaid. Really good picks for hard breach denial/breach potential!
---
Gun *clap* meme *clap* review *clap*
---
No, no, no. This, this is just bandit mains after doc stim pistols them.
---
Oh.... Um....
---
I thought this r/hongkong
---
You should try Maestro. His cams are very useful if you place them well, and it helps that they are harder to destroy than other cams. Plus his shotgun is amazing for opening up walls (rotation holes and all that) and his machine gun (I forgot the proper term) is
---
pretty good too.
---
Mira is also a solid teamwork operator, as her mirrors can be seen by any of her teammates, and opened by anyone as well.
---
Her gun is one of the fastest in the game as well, and she has a secondary shotgun. I mainly use the shotgun to open up holes but it has other uses as well.
---
Ying is a interesting attack op as her 
---
gadget, if used properly, can give great rushing opportunities, and as long as your teammates aren't in the vicinity, they can use the flash to fuze or blow a hole and get in and quickly destabilize the opposition. Of course, you must be careful and try not to also flash ur team, as they sadly dont get an extra Ying Flash Resistance
---
Edit - Sorry if I missed something, I'm not the best at advice.
---
The fact that the eyes look like he is undressing me in his mind makes me think you used a poly filter
---
Nice job saving that much and not spending it.
---
I think I never saw maestro be banned in high gold/low plat people pretty much always ban echo and if it‚Äôs not echo it‚Äôs clash. I tried giving 2 different option to OP.
---
Lean speed is much slower than it used to

In the past you could lean so fast it's comedic

Then I read it right. Refer to my above reasoning why this shouldnt happen. This was also a topic that was broached during a pro league discussion by Kixstar I think.
---
Ill take your entire stock
---
thanks for tellin me. im pretty blind so i woud've never noticed
---
Yeah
---
If you want my honest answer this entire round for both teams was just nonstop bullshittery. Filled with team killing and both teams dancing out in the middle of the street. So by the time I was already putting up this barrier I was laughing with my team-mates but as I started putting up the reinforcements I was laughing with them even harder
---
naw man it actually feels like it. u arent overthinkin and thanks
---
good point
---
It'll have to be balanced though.
---
The sight is fixed. That definitely can't be changed. Like, imagine a guaranteed down gun with a 1x. Entry fragger supreme.
---
As for supressor, doubt that since her damage is hard coded to down regardless of number.
---
I would pick Maestro. 
---
Also, Maestros LMG is a laser. Hilariously so. Surprised Ubi still nerfs the shit out of Ela yet nothing for Maestro. He is the real dark horse.
---
yes &gt;:)
---
And that's an understatement.
---
no u
---
look at his other post
---
Interestingly enough, I'm not that great using the mpx with her but when I use Warden with the mpx I do so much better. Thanks for the recommendation, I need to try her more actually.
---
thanks m8
---
even now they already can quick scope with CSRX 300 so i dont thing put iron sight will change much
---
When you drone to enter a building/room/area are you droning far ahead or close to where you‚Äôre going to go in?
---
Must have had like 5 busted mikes and their y and t keys broken
---
Shaiiko got 25, set a world record and lost
---
Sh*t happens. His team just wasn't competent enough.
---
It is real because the skins were leaked months ago and this came from the official Ubisoft Mexico Facebook page.
---
you got your wish... no one's upvoting
---
What was in it tho
---
no problem, and u can call me whatever ya want man as people are never sure bout my gender
---
There is no better droner.
---
The best you can do is either quick drone or slow drone, how i call it.
---
Slow droning is basically when you take your time to check every room and corner to locate roamers and start clearing them out. 
---
Quick drone is when you know someone is somewhere and you quickly wanna spot him to have a better chance to kill him
---
There's actually a video titled that by multiple YouTubers hosting pros. Believe me, search the exact same thing and you won't be disappointed.
---
Why didn't you just post this lol
---
no problem thank you
---
gonna check after school

Its literally the same weapon.

I think you're perfect at being nice

thanks :]

I do both but I still get killed.

Oh! Did not know that. First time using the R6 tracker overlay. Thank you for the info!
---
Ok boomer
---
what kind of flair trouble
---
ok koomer
---
It was already in the very early stages in the game. Was nerfed cuz the gun had no recoil.
---
Now i can see a reason to give it back
---
dude it was to prove a meme wasn't staged, he wasn't posting like god tier gameplay or anything bro why you gotta be toxic
---
thank you. u are officially the third one to notice that. idk what was ubi thinkin when they dud that elite
---
Reminds me of this rather long gunfight i had. Both of us kept missing and i ended up emptying 2 whole magazines. I won the fight and the dude just rage quit lmao
---
it looks ugly when its on top of the art so i added it on the top
---
I talk to Sam about my personal problems he helps 
---
a lot Sam is a true homie
---
thank you my dude
---
Oh trust me I know lol but something about him in particular using that weapon makes me preform better than when I use valk.
---
Sorry for the confusion guys! Honest mistake on my part. It‚Äôs my first time using the R6 tracker overlay and did not know how it works. Thanks for the details!
---
Find the best flanks. It's simply the best way to play her.

gonna cehck after sch√∂√∂l

If you are getting enraged it‚Äôs infuriating

They manually inject a minimum of 9ms delay to prevent ping abuse.
---
not funny
---
I ALSO DID GET ONCE
---
Thats true. I mean i missed someone with Caveira, but u could hear the punch sound. It is frustrating how inconsistent it is most of the time.
---
I was using "Ronald Reagan" for Halloween and I killed "GDubbya" every round. It was epic.

Why do you have to act like a burnt pizza roll and shit on this guy just because he‚Äôs trying to prove that a meme wasn‚Äôt faked?

I don't feel like a 2k truly exhibits his greatness
---
That sucks man. And I will keep working at getting better at call outs.
---
Its so frustrating and its the most inconsistent thing in the game. I hope they do something about it.
---
K boomer

Yeah. Ubi should unkick you back in that match

Nice username, Grimm

Has anybody tested the exact time for it?

They need to replace current Aug with Gen3 Aug, like in pubg.

*my phone have stupid autocorect sorry Recoil and I
---
If you could kill the hostage and win as a defender, that would completely throw off the balance of the game.
---
Lol yeah she was completely clueless üòÇ
---
Acceptable casualty he say
---
I will try to play a devil‚Äôs advocate: reason why Fuze is so unpopular because his clusters are only somewhat usable in vertical play and windows/doors. With the second option in particular, you are very vulnerable. With option to launch clusters through reinforced wall(with long placement time and other balance decisions), his gadget would more powerful and interesting to use.
---
Yea i agree
---
Lmao
---
The moment they will give Ak-12 to someone else will be an official R.I.P day for Fuze. We don‚Äôt want that
---
Yeah so why have the mode? XD I understand why it's in the game, is for more modes, but a game about realism has a very non logical mode. I just find it funny tbh. üòÇ
---
What did you learn from the twitch stream that taught you how to control it? Well done
---
Personally, i think that little reduction in recoil would be appreciated.
---
r/i_wana_fuck_Wamai is a thing soon?
---
because the pvp side of the game is canonically a training exercise for the agents and it would defeat the purpose of those exercises if the hostage just dies at the start so they probably set a ground rule that defenders cant kill the hostage so they can actually go through the training which turns into the pvp component of the game
---
there i typed it out
---
Finish him! Yeats c4 at jaw. Fatality, walks away slowly looking towards camera and presses button to detonate, followed by a freeze frame with the words "To be continued" on it. üòÇ
---
Now please some russian servers
---
I like to walk the muzzle brake
---
My man where is your ACOG
---
How is it unrealistic? The defenders are taking a hostage, and the attackersare trying to rescue them
---
i remember when i was new i would just turn chat off so i didnt deal with people calling me bad when i was only level 3
---
I know, I just find it funny thinking about this if they were going against real people. üòÇ
---
Not all maps, but most of them. For example, Border‚Äôs screen wasn‚Äôt changed.
---
Damm girl how do you control that smg
---
That's why I don't play on that setting. If your difficulty is derived from cheating, fuck off.
---
Personally I would say hell yes, I've played this game mostly solo for 3 years on PC and it was fine. Amazing game
---
ive never played cod but i hope i someday will.
---
yikes
---
Go to r/R6Teams
---
*Wait that's illegal*
---
Show me a clip? Pretty sure none of those are in the game? Atleast not in ranked maps but also thought we didn't have those in casual. If they run out you have plenty of time for an easy kill
---
Is there a link to this blessed post?
---
I was gonna say they can just their team where you are then I noticed the buttons...
---
Gotta love it when everything just falls in together.
---
its funny because i haven't experienced the toxicity that much and some people say it's super toxic
---
I literally just want a very slight hint of depth and blur around the sight so it doesn't look completely out of place in this game.

Step 1 - integrate teams into the game.
---
If I see someone and they see me and I get a shot into them first it's still highly likely I'll die first and it tilts the fuck out of me. I've stopped using frost as much because the fire rate is just infuriating how it chugs.
---
Bruh but that is 2 months ago... Though you were talking about this poster.

We all know there is gonna be a casa de papel event.

Yea i was playing with my friend before he left and i continued on after thx for the help anyway :))

It‚Äôs functional.

Atleast pistols actually work in this game.
---
Not about the poster but the event. Gg.
---
Casual queues usually take seconds mate
---
Ez 71%
---
looks like someone had a great day at gaming
---
I mean, with more people simply switching over to the game because it's slightly different and a ranked game mode (ranked modes = smurf account purchases) why bother? Honestly the balance of currently existing operators in siege is so skewed. I have no idea man.

Alot off people don't bother putting the test servers on their SSD

Well, Mozzie is by far one of the most balanced operator in the game (and has a sick reaload for Comando +1 points) and he's a sorty of counter intel and a intel operator, this mean that he steal your drones and uses it agains't you, a huge game changer because you can block drones ways a lot and delay the attackers, his guns are good, I personally don't think they're so good as you said, but the zero-recoil, high fire rate from the P-10 is amazing, but just 19(+1) rounds in the mag, very balanced I would say, the Comando aswell zero-recoil, medium fire rate and 25(+1)rounds in the mag, that's mean you have to pick or high fire rate or "large" magazine
---
About the new ops, Wamai(is that the righ name?idk) he just similar to Jagger in the way they catch nades, but just catch one of them and auto destroy it self, well, he's good for use the attacker nades agains't them, just like Mozzie do with the drones, you don't want Wamai Mag-NET to be close to you, you want him to be in the attackers way, because if he's close to you it won't chance nothing, the nades still working, the loadout is at least good, the IQ Aug's, Keratos or P-12(Jagger pistol), shield or barbed wire(I don't remember the other primary sorry), Wamai's beeing "underrated" at least
---
Kali is just a "weaker Tatcher" i say this 'cuz the guy playing with her needs to be a monster to get the timing right for counter bandit tricking, she's good with pre placed bandits, eletroclaws, jammers, etc, but bandit tricking is hard to counter with Kali, the Bolt Action sniper, tha only advantage is the hit-down shot, but long reload, long ADS, long bolt action, every thing's long, has the CZ-75 as secondary, pretty good I would say, but she is a "over-hyped" and a "overrated" character
---
That's like actually fckng amazing

What exactly are you asking? They do entirely different things

valkyrie, her intel is amazing but you need to know how to place them in good spots.bandit is great his gun and ability but kaid does the same
---
job,personally i like them both on the same team but i would choose valkyrie.
---
Achievement get: return to sender

You must be fun at parties, but your not wrong
---
Great recoil control! That's some impressive stuff right there. You should work on your crosshair placement which can really make a giant difference. For example, at 0:07 to 0:10, you were aiming at lower body level which could have resulted in your death.
---
I'm playing on console. I was just posting this because that was the dumbest luckiest headshot I've ever seen lol

It‚Äôs called a flair and you can add it next to your name by going to the community and pressing the three dots in the top left or so corner and hitting ‚Äúchange flair‚Äù. I‚Äôm on mobile so idk if this is the same for pc.

These are two operators you simply cannot compare.

5 stack NA players on EU servers against lower ranking 3 stack and two randoms. What fun.

\^ this. Siege might be the only game where you need to teach "crosshair placement = crouch level" (and sometimes head)
---
C4! APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD!

I'm scared

Snake_nade is the first? Lol I never noticed it
---
Na wont fit. "Kali" has a 5x - 12x Sniper Scope not an Acog 4x (In R6 2,5x)
---
Best solution for groups would be 2s and 3s get combined while 4s are told to get a 5th or lose person. That is if they didn't want to allow solo into a group ranked queue to gap fill.
---
For sure. But i am just platinum

Killing teammates doesn‚Äôt add to the kill column, plus you couldn‚Äôt do that because of reverse friendly fire.

Lol I actually didn‚Äôt get hit by it so I don‚Äôt think it made it shake I do know when you get hit but survive, you do a huge flinch.

Looks really good! Have you drawn other operators or is mute the first?

Is it available on anything in the US?

Yes u can buy, licence need to always go true uplay.

Yeah happened to me aswell. Really annoying

Only on controller smh

Do u really not see kixstar or interro

Pls make miss piggy gridlock

Squad up and see if you can play ranked. If you are in the range you can play ranked. If not, it won't let you click ranked.

I can try to find it my friends

No it's just really hot soup

Same.

The game is still worth getting into. I had the same problem, but you just gotta take it.

You should definitly get into it IMO.

Find a good five stack is prolly your best option.

Yo man thanks for reading my song

Happened to me and redownloading didn‚Äôt change anything. 
---
Try verify your files if its on steam.
---
Could be your internet. Resetting/ just restarting could help.
---
Go to files in rainbow six and change servers and restart pc which help me. (Theres a method in utube) 
---
If it still happens just stop for a week as it could be your internet being shit sometimes it happens as well.
---
The shot gun is fine.
---
It's actually very possible on a controller as long as you're used to stick sensitivity and have played with the weapon enough to understand the recoil and pull in the counter direction.
---
If your bitch enough you‚Äôll go through it to get them
---
I will try this üëç
---
One of the best shows on Netflix. Can‚Äôt wait for these skins but I wish they were for a few more operators

Anything that was impactful oh wait no

Ok, now i get you..

do you actually play using the single fire mode or were you just trolling

Fucking lit

No, Jackal was downed, so I managed to put a charge down there, in case Lesion rushed up. So no, I was just experimenting, but you bet I will from now on.

1. Ranked is the thing I want to come back to, and having one bad match ain't gonna stop me from playing it lol. I'm gonna play more casual and warm up better before going to ranked tho! 
---
2. Reported him from griefing and blocked on Xbox too
---
3. Yea I guess I should or try to get my older Siege friends to play with me too
---
So youre a little Kid. 
---
k
---
sounds cool
---
Favela would be way too big for this they would have to create new maps for the most part
---
And then we have even more split queue times. Unranked is already dead and we want to add another playlist
---
It‚Äôs super easy ubi! Just ‚úÖ fix sound
---
I would never be able to do this, my reactions, my aim and my recoil control is terrible
---
Siege is not made for 2vs2
---
It's called custom
---
It has literally been that for the entire game. What made it spike is the reduction of the map pool, cutting out maps like House and Plane that have a much higher attack win % vs Villa
---
i said it in my head in kermits voiceüòÇ
---
Oh a man of culture YIKES!
---
Lesion easily, his utility is still outstanding even after the nerf plus he has a phenomenal primary
---
so what youre saying is, get a squad or dont play the game at all. very cool LENMOBB
---
Damn :D it depends so much on the context how you should take it. He seems like he was really cool guy to play with regardless of his kill count.
---
I mean... the ‚Äúnew‚Äù shield model is only 2 months old now. So I wouldn‚Äôt call the other one that old...
---
I have no clue about the meta, being a casual player. But I will say that you will be in for a wild ride. Also the operators since Operation Outbreak have all gotten previously owned guns. So really I would probably just ask your teammates.
---
A while = 2 months right
---
So the number one champion in EU is a former NA pro, who (intentionally to boost or not) plays with 2 unranked leading to him facing plat 3's. Nice, global ranks when? The advantage of divided ranks isn't really that important anymore.
---
They need to adopt the exact same system that league of legends has
---
Peaky blinders is BBC though...
---
Perfect cut
---
I believe they have a partnership with Netflix though
---
Lots lion got reworked and now his scan is 4 seconds and pings like a camera instead of having the outline. He also has 3 scans. Maverick the good operators that got released since then are maestro(played like an anchor and intel op)  maverick for assisting a thermite in opening a wall when thatcher is banned,  mozzie (play him like a mute to deny attacker drones and maybe steal some drones for yourself) gridlock is used a roam denial and you should use her trax to block off staircases, Long hallways, choke points. kaid is used usually to electrify hatches. Nomad is used as anti roam as well but more as denying runouts and doorways. The other ops aren‚Äôt that useful.
---
Ok, thanks but what do you mean by "previously owned guns"
---
How did you do it. Could you teach me?
---
It's 3:2
---
Yup
---
‚Ä™Sounds good but what about 4 stacks, if everyone solo queuing goes to this playlist, what happens to someone queuing in 4 stack, will they ever get a 5th?‚Ä¨
---
Maybe in the US I suppose, in the UK Peaky Blinders is the BBC‚Äôs flagship show.
---
Well there‚Äôs the customs lobby as well as the circle desk lobby on this map...
---
Im sure someone at Ubisoft has a code for the glacier skin. Im sure top streamers/ pro league players recieve them upon special request
---
Yeah he tried to guide us through the match but we fucked up lol, it was my first match for the day, i barely got a kill
---
It does the same damage as the Doc's MP5 if you hit body shots
---
Pround Brit Op born and bread in England Yorksire !
---
Year 5 map probably!
---
He literally destroys good players with a controller
---
Solo-Queue for Casual as well or nothing at all.
---
The operators (as far as I know) all have weapons used by other operators. For instance, Warden has Valkyrie's primary SMG (forgot the name), and the S.A.S. Shotgun, the M590A. N√∏kk has Smoke's FMG-9 and the Desert Eagle 44 secondary and so on.
---
Intrested in joining a ranked squad?
---
We need SoloQ Casual as well. Newcomer and unranked is completely unnecessary.
---
That's a lot of information thank you.
---
How about weapons tho especially on Nomad since I bought her
---
He‚Äôs called wamai because whenever he grabs one of your nades you instinctively say, ‚ÄúWha, my nade!‚Äù

I dont like when people post their operator drawings because they usually suck or are weird. But this one i like
---
xbox unranked is dead, cant find any games unless you 5 stack. probably cuz most console players are cusuals that play the game like cod and dont know how to play the game. doesnt mean they cant win 1v1's but this game is much more then an fps shooter. most people dont know or care about strats on how to hold an objective or they simply dont know since they dont watch pro league or youtube videos. these people only play casual or ranked and dont actually care enough about the competitiveness of the game to go into unranked instead of casual. 
---
there simply arent enough good/competitive console players out there compared to PC's playerbase. little 12 year old kids dont care about strats, all they care about is going into the building and getting a positive k/d. no teamwork or comunication, just playing call of duty in siege.

i love this game and i think its sad that i have to go to PC in order to get any competitive experience.

I like this better
---
Oh damn
---
If you‚Äôre getting tked in rank it might be where you got placed. The lower the rank the less people care about their ranks and they are more likely to throw the game. Finding a group will definitely help fight the toxicity from teammates. I used to play ps4 siege and have found some nice people just solo queuing. They are out there.
---
That must be a new update
---
I figured

Smoke needed a side hustle lol

Lol

When Ubi has female workers....

Hmmmmmmm

Pretty much how I think the whole thing is going to go

I was thinking about putting some of them up in a museum

Seriously tho amazing job especially considering it‚Äôs one pen

In all my 170+ hours of T-hunt i never saw something like this :P
---
And you'd lose your foot while stepping on it
---
Didn‚Äôt they say in ‚ÄúThe Making of Operation Chimera‚Äù video that Lion‚Äôs gadget was going to be like a breach charge you place on the wall to scan the other side, but due to technical problems they made it a drone instead?
---
go away uncle thermite
---
Holy shit haven't thought about this
---
Matimi0 always starts his sessions by one or two rounds of house t-hunt
---
nice
---
&gt;never gets used
---
Have you ever played on console? Literally every single Ela player uses the shotgun because it‚Äôs fucken busted.
---
Thanks dude

lmao so what

I can picture spawnpeek heaven on those rappelling from the helicopter!

Ew get out of here boomer

I love it!

This is  from a TV series called Money Heist in English. I believe this poster is fake because this movie is already into its third season, and since the masks they wear are the same as the legendary Vigil mask recently created. Pretty sure someone just combined the two, and that its not an actual collab.
---
Yes no if it happened to you it could happen again if its not reported
---
bUt wHaT aBoUt 4 sTaCks?!?!

Should mention platform
---
I've always wanted to do this lmfao
---
Thx for that

So because they cant afford a PC they shouldn't be playing siege
---
[deleted]
---
you seem very flustered, simply just don‚Äôt use ela and use someone like lesion I think it needs a nerf and that‚Äôs just me.
---
Because  the original article got taken down
---
You wanted to play Wamai? Too bad, he‚Äôs Wa-mine.
---
Wait I haven't played tts someone help
---
Glaz still has his place since his rifle is semi auto. But nice drawing
---
I was at gold 3 and the guy who killed me and called me bad was silver so yea, you r right. I am probably going to stop solo queing
---
Lesion or Vigil, but probably lesion. Mira ain‚Äôt bad, but is really only picked for specific sites like basement on Oregon and Penthouse on Coastline. Ela is pretty shit right now, her SMG has really random recoil, and her shotgun is getting nerfed next season.
---
Hmm, yes the letters here are made by the alphabet
---
No problem
---
It's 3D printed.
---
No thanks &gt;.&lt;
---
How much LSD mixed with coffee did you take before this match?
---
That's a weird looking soup
---
Looks great bruthur!
---
That‚Äôs awesome dude I would love to see more gadgets like that!
---
We all been bamboozled
---
Big
---
Nah the joke is just overdone and cringe. It's like unironically posting a bad luck brian meme. You're like atleast 4-5 years late with the "did you just assume my gender?" memes
---
If you play 10 games and still only get 2 kills per match youll be in the elo you belong fast enough since elo losses are really high for the first 10 games
---
Yeah I saw on r6 tracker the number 3 or something in the world only played 10 games. This was a few weeks ago but still.
---
Edit: number 5 on pc has played 11 games according to r6 tracker
---
Sr pelo noises ensume
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say very nicely is that I don‚Äôt think anyone really cares whether vertical grip makes a difference or not
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see!

1. was a joke

2. suposed to be tagged as gameplay (edited)

Dude thats lit, the best one ive Seen!

His rear looks almost identical to my own. OP seems to be a little confused though. This is certainly a different base model body, without a doubt.

Guy? Is there something i don't know?

Wait you've started 2 months ago and already plat?!

How did you get this "Finka Main" banner ?
---
Half the people that play on siege now that are on console use a keyboard and mouse. That's definitely one of them. Me and friend deal with it at all the time, it sucks cause they have such a huge advantage against console players using keyboard and mouse vs controller but there's nothing you or apparently boobysoft can do about soooo yeah
---
Buy someone you actually play

Now we mass produce this and distribute it to the HK protesters. God knows they need it.

I liked the little scream while running from the grenade lmao

If you go the main page of the subreddit there should be 3 dots in the top right. If you click it and go to the flairs there should be the icons for each operator that you can choose.

As someone who plays a lot of solo queue in order to improve, this is 100% needed idec about long queue times.
---
Cause it‚Äôs just me, I always worry about others opinions and I just can‚Äôt decide so I turn to redditüòÇ
---
I just never play jager enough but thank you and I really like it too, it‚Äôs very clean and it fits him but I just don‚Äôt play him enough
---
That‚Äôs even stronger than the current Lion. All you would have to do is drone the room and use gadget, then it‚Äôs ez kill. Whoever posted that is stupid.

IQ pro league set is way better than her elite imo.

Just get the Tachanka elite skin, you know you want to.

That's why he was confused

&gt;Most solo queue players have zero interest in communicating or working together which is why they get stomped by people in a stack who are doing those things. I solo'd for the first 2 years the game was out and can pretty much count on one hand how many people i ran into using a mic to do anything useful (PS4).
---
So, solo queuing you ran into players who don't communicate. Therefore it takes more skill solo queuing because you lack critical information your teammates should be supplying on occasion. Therefore there is a difference between solo and 5-stack because one guarantees communication.
---
That's like a surefire way to get scoliosis
---
This title hurts
---
This is already a thing, but it‚Äôs ‚ÄúThermit‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúKermite‚Äù. A quick google should lead you to it eventually
---
Hey! How many times has this happened to you by chance? Are you able to submit [a report through R6Fix?](https://r6fix.ubi.com/)
---
My favorite elites are glaz and hibana.
---
Yea I was just thinking that. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a different playlist but just be integrated within the ranked itself. If you are solo, you are play with other solo queue people. If you‚Äôre with a squad 4-5 you are put with others that are in a squad.
---
KSI before 4:20
---
The other day (Friday I believe) me and my little brother started a ranked game, it was 3-2 and my brother was in a 1v4 ( although he was smoke and the other ops were very lit it could have been a clutch) and all of a sudden he lagged out, no biggy he can join back. Well he tries to join but internet is being shitty, we end up going to 4-4 and he still isn‚Äôt back. Finally he restarts app and goes to rejoin by clicking the ranked button, he ends up joining a COMPLETELY NEW RANKED GAME and we end up losing and he gets stuck with an abandoned penalty, and later we both lag out of an unranked game and nothing getting abandoned penalty
---
As if Buck needs help killing himself or his teammates with a frag
---
When you were queueing for a match, did you previously stop the queue before this match? This is an issue the team has been looking into recently.
---
Yeah but I'm not good enough to play ranked....
---
5 stack queue times would enormous and you would end up playing the same people over and over again which is already a problem on PC. On PC it's advised that you wait a couple of minutes before looking for a new match so you don't end up playing with the same people as the last game.
---
Just keep playing you‚Äôll end up where you belong eventually. It happens sometimes just try to communicate in whatever way possible.
---
I mess up my grammar?
---
Please reach out to [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New)for assistance with this message! Make sure your Uplay and Steam account are properly linked up as well.
---
Very good point, my mains don‚Äôt have elites yet so I‚Äôm going with the next best thing
---
Hey there ya‚Äôll, commissioner of this icon here! (I made a reddit account just for this.)
---
You guys can use this icon on your profiles and whatnot, just be sure to credit /u/naphta1ene for his awesome work! May you spread the good word of the Kermite/Thermit army my friends.
---
When a projectile enters its radius the fuse resets, it gets pulled in onto the magnet and the detonates normally.
---
You already can in custom matches lol I agree with others and it‚Äôs a no from me dawg.
---
Good idea, it would be great to see somebody detonate a C4 right beside him by accident
---
Also look at Nomad in final kill cam
---
While your driving with your drone to the objective you see a Mozzie hold a sign saying ‚Äúdrone check‚Äù as he violently sticks a robot on your drone.
---
Be cool I guess, don‚Äôt think it would apply much cause most people just throw and instantly detonate it. What would be good is if they have it in their hand and it detonates as good players sometimes pre pull out the c4 so the attackers don‚Äôt hear the rip sound. Dokk seems to be in a good state rn, her win rate is very balanced.
---
he only used one emoji, read the rules on the subreddit.

# DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER

Wham
---
Worst map, I can‚Äòt understand why it‚Äòs still in ranked.
---
Hmm, yes these comment are made out of words
---
I probably will, thank you
---
I know what you mean, but people make smurf accounts to get better stats after becoming a better player too, or to get out of high gold\low plat once they are really good so they can get insta placed in plat or diamond
---
Mobile or web?
---
oh no.
---
Yep definitely, even with a pro controller u can‚Äôt do those quick movements
---
At least matched with 3-2 and not just a bunch of solo players
---
On mobile: the 3 dots at the top of the main subreddit screen and pick change user flair.
