darn they buffed impacts to have the damage of grenades and faster reaction time
---
---
---
Visual bugs, same with rooks armour
---
Cheers dude, but this really has nothing to do with what I was saying....... thanks though
---
Had same problem couple days ago and this is what ubi support said i should do and it worked:
---
- Go to Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-Game tab.
---
- Make sure "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game" is ticked.
---
- Go to your Steam Library.
---
- Right click on the game and select Properties.
---
- In the General tab, make sure "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game" is ticked.
---

---
You may also need to clear your browser cache in Steam. To do this:
---
- Navigate to Steam &gt; Settings
---
- In the Settings Menu find "Web Browser"
---
- "Delete browser cache" &gt; OK
---
Hope it works for you.
---
I like the 4th one from the right, I wish ops looked more serious with their gear like this guy does
---
You‚Äôre gay if you wouldn‚Äôt
---
No, you take the damage from it hitting them
---
Awesome, about to try this, I just came accross a forum saying the same thing so I'll give it a shot
---
Its level restricted to 50, which is probably more than enough to teach you about siege.
---
I know most of the stuff and even know how to counter defenders, traps excetera. My weakness is just slow reflexes and aim (many situations like clutches and defuses fail just because I cant kill anyone). Spawn peeking is also a fairly known concept.
---
Followed by ‚Äúa‚Äù, then ‚Äúg‚Äù then ...ban
---
You still get the benefits of the joystick aim assist when you‚Äôre using the MaK on console using adaptors.
---
You can‚Äôt lean before you ads though...
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs about what to expect.
---
As if you‚Äôve made this some sort of racist segregation. Reason is no one really knows turkey has a military at all. That region is in turmoil right now
---
I mean, you‚Äôre fifth behind France, UK, and Italy. So maybe your country is next?
---
Nope
---
Yeah, and even then Idgaf what the enemies say/call or insult me. Its just words and at the end of the day *a video game*
---
Lesion is more powerful the longer the round is, so if your ok camping in obj then lesion is great at that, sit hide, throw a guu, and then go hide again
---
Dark days
---
There‚Äôs a one speed two speed and a three speed option, which suits your play style best
---
Yep :( reflex is okay but I need my acog
---
Lucio.
---
It was never dead, but it was the epicenter of cringe culture (like Fortnite is right now) for a while, but it‚Äôs come back from the depths of hell and is being treated like it deserves
---
Not really hacker-like but ok
---
Nobody
---
They shot down his builds obviously
---
How do I get that?
---
Ewww
---
nah it's blursed
---
f
---
They have a newcomers playlist for new players
---
Look at Maestro's face: "Da fuq is this dude doing with a bike"
---
The quality isn‚Äôt even that bad just cut the video time down. Only show the parts you want to highlight.
---
I had the one on the very far right, I loved that game.
---
Like most class FPS where abilities and utility play off each other and the operators you bring significantly can change a round. Having characters that are way more powerful than others makes those characters overpicked and a bitch to deal with.
---
Good, I'll do the same, then.
---
you can also plag Lion, Finka, Dokaebi just fine.
---
When ur siblings keep on coming into ur room
---
No probs. Now you know.
---
True.
---
Isn't he like 4'3 or something like that?
---
Happy cake day, lord!
---
&gt;i shoot them back 
---
That's your problem right there. Solution: don't shoot back. They'll have to eventually stop to avoid getting banned, or will have to just get banned.
---
Can fbi open up?
---
Where did you get the helmet?
---
Why are you in copper? You're a level 115 and you have Ash's elite skin. That means you must have been playing for at least a year so you can't be a noob.
---
You could, if Tachanka hadn't been such a self-righteous dud.
---
only counter is thermite
---
Once a season for 1 week and I'm ok. But not as a standard game mode.
---
its a plat 2 and you‚Äôre gold 1, i think at this point people are just trying to find things to complain about
---
Thank you!

---
Oooooh boy....
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it, I know it‚Äôs in the works
---
That always happens to me but when I'm on the defenders side
---
Whats the ELO difference between Gold 1 and Plat 2? 
---
OH YEA AND THE COPPER 1? 
---
Stop defending the game for a very faulty and terrible ranked system. In my opinion its one of the worst competitive system out among the bigger competitive games like Dota and Overwatch!!
---
Interesting. Most matches I've played Glaz is able to take out my teammates without much effort. It's always the same story.
---
I think it's a bit unfair in general to have a one way glass. It makes the objective into a killbox with no way to retaliate but to brake the games principle and roam outside as defenders.
---
I used it the first few matches on pc
---
Did all that and it didn't solve it.
---
One of the best roamers in the game, his primary is unparalleled and has impacts for quick movement. With a low learning curve, that was my reasoning
---
Nice mental gymnastics
---
yes, more of this is exactly what we need please!
---
It‚Äôs not zoomed in
---
Yeah that was a tough pick, and I understand that some people disagree with me there. I think she just has a high learning curve, but can turn the tide in a match.   
---
But fair point, yeah
---
I think it's unfair, because that makes the objective a kill box that Glaz has no opportunity costs to enjoy. It's a one-way glass. There is no retaliation for the defenders unless they break the concept of Siege and roam outside.
---
Except young can't be flashed so..
---
[removed]
---
Well I only play cas if I don‚Äôt have friends for ranked so it‚Äôs not often but yea I understand your point but it‚Äôs not an issue that would make the map broken. Plus like I said earlier it‚Äôs not in ranked so the chances of ubisoft looking into it are slim unless they rework the map in year 5. Just spawn peek glaz the idiot will be looking in the windows anyway.
---
The ELO difference between a plat 2 and a gold 1 is 800, if you reverse that with a gold 1 you're facing against a silver 1 (low silver 1 might I add).  So basically you're saying as someone that could be a high gold 1, I should be facing against people that could have also just potentially entered silver 1?  Not to mention the main highlight of this post is the COPPER 1 that's in this game along with everyone else.  Like the other guy said, stop defending a ranked system that is clearly faulty.
---
So, you're boosting people on that bronze acc or? Cause there's no legit reason for you to be bronze if you're diamond every season.
---
Legit tried this one time in casual where id place my battery there and cover it with barbed wire. We would get on our cams and watch Thermite try to breach the hatch it was hilarious lol
---
But once again, you're putting pulse above mira, rook above smoke, tachanka above blackbeard,  you're putting smoke in the same tier as tachanka, you're putting cav in same tier as lesion, etc etc
---
I just can't see how any of these are justified
---
Umm, player ccount in Turkey?
---
No one cares about black ice anymore.
---
Bought it right away. So worth it. You see his tats and the gun skins are actually amazing.. definitely my fave elite
---
Wow, is that available now? I gotta buy it
---
Her guns are literally trash except for maybe the C70. Her gadget is just okay. Name me one time recently where her gadget actually was a game changer and helped you win the game.
---
This would be the best damn update to ever reach this game. Maybe castle would be good for once
---
Idk why but this made me lol
---
I approve haha
---
dead meme kid grow up if you've not got anything good to say, parents couldn't spell Brady so they named you bardy, bunch of dyslexic twats if you ask me
---
He literally can see through walls providing intel and has a godly shotgun.
---
You know what else is really good at quickly killing enemies? Literally any gun, but you can move!
---
I saw this artwork a long time ago. This isn't anything new.
---
Same
---
Very small populace besides the operators nation doesn‚Äôt matter I feel more attachment to lesion than I do smoke
---
Yes
---
Cause cosplay wise the german ops are the easiest because of how casual their clothing
---
Being 25% German has never meant anything to me until now
---
You‚Äôve played siege for 5.5 hours everyday since it came out?
---
üòÇ üëç 
---
You do you buddy!
---
again, you must be copper to think that. sound is the most important thing in the game and her ability is the best at that.
---
Did you not notice the Copper 1?
---
Facts
---
That‚Äôs Mozzie, Bandit is 5‚Äô9.
---
No I‚Äôm not. I have over 1000 hours in this game and a whole lot in dokkaebi
---
We all know why this is good cosplay ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
No they dont. They need to make it more fun and less competitive. It's casual.
---
This new teamkilling thing is shit. As soon at you get that red triangle everyone wants to walk infront of U to get you killed with zero risk to them.
---
It's not a bad idea. In fact, it's probably the best solution to combat MKB on console. People want to play an FPS, but they only have a console. They buy an emulator that lets them use MKB. They can now play an FPS with a proper control setup, but they are matched against players using thumbsticks.
---
If MKB were officially supported (I've heard Fortnite does it, maybe I'm wrong), players using MKB can be queued against other MKB users, while controller users can opt into playing with MKB users, but are otherwise queued against other controller users. This won't solve the problem of players with MKB emulators annihilating controller users, but anyone who genuinely just wants to play with MKB can do so legitimately.
---
This would also raise the skill ceiling of the console playerbase, which is always a good thing.
---
The important part is that **MKB players will not be matched with controller players**.
---
üÖ±Ô∏èoi
---
Also same. lol
---
Idk I‚Äôve been waiting for it too tho
---
Amazing cosplay. You got everything right üçëüçë
---
You should have gone for the head
---
Castle has the most balanced gadget. No need to buff it, give a different UMP that is a little better even though I still destroy with the old one
---
Yeah, there is, I was really just fascinated to be honest, it was annoying dont get me wrong but we were in a 5 stack in discord so text chat wasnt necessary anyway. They were doing it while still playing, they weren't doing good(but that could have been on purpose) and it kept at that consistency and speed the the whole match except the transition in and out of rounds but as soon as you got back to op selection or into the map it started again
---
\*Screams in 8 fps\*
---
Truth.
---
And he's possibly top fragger too. This just goes to show that you can never underestimate anyone or their skill level
---
Xbox is made to be used with controller. They're pretty clear about that. And if it's such a superior input device, go play on PC.
---
I didn't think about that. I was in a 5 stack and we really didn't notice much but I do know they were definitely throwing. And abusing the new rff system they had their whole team activated
---
Maybe just trying to throw you guys off, and fucking around on purpose. If they were throwing, I gues spamming chat with a macro could be a part of that
---
Yes!! !Upvote
---
It took me longer than I would like to admit to come up with this title.
---
This happened to me with Ying's LMG. For like 3 weeks I hard mained her and wrecked shit, then one day a switch turned off and I was completely terrible with it and couldn't do shit with it due to the horrible fire rate.
---
but its only 61k? Im hovering 350k and dont have season passes because fuck these greedy little shits.
---
When did they release this?
---
Ok buddy retard
---
600k
---
Yeah could be, what's impressive is they were still playin, not very good but still walkin around, not sure how they did that if like to know though I've accidentally hit t trying to reload or y trying to hit push to talk haha
---
Yes! I was a 9-year-old when it came out, now I'm in high school. Good times!
---
More like baldur tbh
---
Maestro can be fun to play, lesion is just a complete setback for the enemy, alibi is pretty fun 2 play, overall I say get maestro, p.s weapon skins dont matter you'll have all the ops soon dont rush anything
---
this is called adulthood.
---
Why do they always have glasses, enough with the glasses!
---
that's a big RIP
---
Downvoted
---
This is actually true
---
You can pick up plates after being dbno and it'll make sure you can go down again. Also if you wear plates then take damage you can put on another set.
---
I had this once my friend was afk .
---
Nah that counts as suicide. 
---
I'm thinking downed&gt;picked up&gt;airjabbed off a roof.
---
Love how plat players need their friends to make smurfs so they go up against easier competitionüòÇ how about just get good at the rank you are at.
---
And the tattoos
---
Not Bad
---
Put Monty up on top pls
---
Have fun when you get banned.
---
Whoa you are super cool. You must be a pro player in diguise. Holy cap you are such a god omg wow.
---
This would be the best way to do it
---
Airjab
---
Well he also said other things that were... much more unsavory.
---
He said it was for thunt
---
If you‚Äôre playing thunt you can turn them off
---
Too OP need nerf
---
Chanks isn‚Äôt getting an elite until he gets totally reworked. Not gonna give an operator a gadget skin for a gadget that might not stay in the game
---
yes It was the first thing i did when testing in casual
---
Wish wars ended the same way, only, MUCH quicker.
---
There exists a grip that one would put over the mag-well of the any Colt M16 or M4 style rifle and it‚Äôs molded to act like a sort of vertical grip, the one problem would be where the underslung shotgun would go if it were added to the game
---
T H I C C
---
Yes. My friend got kicked
---
You've been spotted.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, what‚Äôs wish wars?
---
Revenge for all thr times I was downed and got twitch droned.
---
That's what you get for popping my mira windows! Good job, mozzie!
---
Even if you took another plate after you‚Äôre down, you will still die
---
No probs. glhf.

Drugs.
---
Ubi should start selling kill cams emoji. I would play money to BM others.
---
Thx for these words
---
And k thought you're chatting with some gurl you had sexy time with...
---
Haha
---
Watch watch watcha
---
Who did?
---
It's a one time buy in of 20$ if you get it on a sale. If you play the game for any decent amount of time, you'll make enough renown to buy every operator fairly quickly ( I got all dlcs in 8 month of regular play) they aren't greedy for asking 40$ a year to support the game and keep updates, operators, maps, bug fixes and seasonal events coming along.
---
Super NSFW twitter feed.
---
I am level 185 on PC and level 158 on Xbox. Platinum or Diamond every season in the games history, with a 1.4 KDR. My stats probably tower yours.

Solo queue = terrorist hunt, you can't solo queue in multiplayer.
---
Lol, wtf, I feel bad for you,  nobody is giving you any good feedback. I'd say just suck it up and take it as the game is trying to help you learn those maps.
---
I got fuze and j√§ger...
---
Granted, when i started playing i did play alot of fuze but... Meh not anymore
---
Exactly. :)

He's even called Lord Tachanka in the cinematics.

Oh well. You tried.

Don‚Äôt worry mate that‚Äôs a leak for Y4S2 where ubisoft adds doors that you can kick down on some places

I buy every Elite skin and every time I played him tonight (in this skin), I felt like a gay leather daddy while the chorus of the song ‚ÄúGerman Sparkle Party‚Äùplayed on rerun in my head.
---
You forgot Gridlock!
---
Yurrrr soooo toooooxiiiiiicccccc
---
Honestly I wouldn't get alibi, her ability is good but I feel that lesion's and maestro's are much more powerful. I would have to say that maestro's weaponry is better than both of the other two. So yeah, overall I would get maestro.
---
Mby i am
---
It makes a lot more sense that this was a veiled racial statement when you understand he is also a Qtard.
---
Got same answer as OP above. I only play Thermite because we need to make a big fucking hole and nobody else wants to play breach. Never play pulse because there's a lot of good defender options that take priority.
---
And Fuze
---
Thanks
---
May the lord tachanka bless  you
---
Just leave them be. I frankly find the "haha dEaD mEmE" comments significantly more annoying than some newcomers thinking an old meme is funny.

Change my mind!

Is it even possible to make it suggest tachanka?
---
thats 610k
---
J√§ger and...Thermite? I thought Thermite was the strange one. I never play him.
---
This game has honestly made me feel an urge to shoot these things. And that's really bad because I play paintball and airsoft.
---
Thanks Babe
---
Yes? I think
---
Yess
---
If you have a red triangle on you‚Äôre name and you shoot a team mate you‚Äôll take the damage instead of them but you need I think 1 team kill to get the red triangle
---
It's new and its annoying. It's centre screen, making pixel peeks harder
---
Im trying, but cant
---
I mostly get jager, kapkan or pulse
---
"The happier we get the less we see"
---
so keep losing casuals so you get matched with people who are losers
---
Hey thanks for reporting this.
---
I'll get this passed on to be looked into! You can also post on [R6FIX](https://r6fix.ubi.com) as well.
---
If you have RFF activated you will only be banned if you kill some one with a nitro cell, ash charge, grenade etc. Otherwise the damage will just be reflected onto you
---
I get uncomfortable looking at this thinking enemies know where I am and I'm about to die very very soon

The real reason is they don't want to reprogram the pellet spread and it would make most shots one hit kill at medium range if they don't drop the damage.

they should change it to 3 pings so you don't waste haft the round running around trying not to get wall banged
---
Nice
---
Can you find buyable legendaries in alpha packs? Like Frosts huntress skin? Or are those paid only
---
No, reason being the map pool would become 3-4 maps constantly.
---
This does not show true skill nor does it benefit people who want to play all the maps. If someone is Diamond and they've only played Consulate, Villa and Skyscraper, then they are only Diamonds on they maps, they might be nowhere near Diamond if they played the others too and if I like to play all the maps and come against someone on Skyscraper who has constantly played that I'm going to get my ass handed to me and then balancing issues will be brought up for said map.
---
I don't think it's a bad idea, it does work in other games, I just don't think it's necessary at all.
---
I mean i hate some maps in ranked but i think we Don't need to have that

Yo that‚Äôs amazing

(Can u do recruit)
---
You can get everything out of alpha packs, surprisingly enough, you can actually get elite skins and full charecters out of them if your lucky enough
---
Elite skins are paid only
---
Idk about the csgo style but i wish at the begininning of the round we had a banning system like PL for maps to pick the map
---
To tell you the truth I'm more surprised that you didn't join a game right before you opened the alpha pack.

I'm afraid then he won't be picked at all üôÑ.

No. Just makes d2 heroes.

Also, am I the only one who finds drones extremely cute? I can't really explain it, but how they look at you with their red eyes and when you see them they try to jump and run away and turn back ocassionally, or sit on top of an object and when you see them they become shy and retreat from view... xD
---
Looks like you don't have a choice. Clearly the blood that flows through your veins is made of sulfur and mercury.

Iq's elite's ***Thiccc***
---
how about you shut up for Burnt Horizon teasers literally came 2 weeks before the finals and it's always been that way.
---
I feel like I just had an aneurysm reading that
---
Nah it villager &amp; pillager new ops confirmed
---
When you're a drone operator, they just let you do it
---
"It's a feature!"
---
Idk why but I think they‚Äôre going to make a dlc operator elite
---
Isn't the 6inv skin the newest one of them? What's actually the case is that all uniforms in the game, except for the 6inv and elites (and not including headgears), are the exact same with a different skin applied on top.
---
dude shut the fuck teasers for burnt horizon came 2 weeks before the major reveals.
---
Zofia is my guess ?
---
Really?
---
its not a bug, it happens every season when me and my friends fight over the new ops
---

Anger problem much? lol Do you need a hug, man?

You should go ahead and open them and make a video anyways since they're just sitting there.

Where do I take the survey?

Definitely copping it. I've been waiting so long
---
I mean,he probably doesn't look like this. This is his disguise, I'd assume.
---
Thats about 59-60 links to other sub-Reddits. I didn‚Äôt even know you could fit that many
---
It does nothing, just shows who has RTK enabled.
---
If i could rate this between 0-10 it would be a 9
---
Managed to hijack both twitch drones last night and used every one of the shots on various members of the enemy team including killing a nomad who was repelled outside a window. 
---
The next round began with the nomad player team killing the twitch player, and instantly devolved into a tk/rff showdown that left only a one player remaining.
---
... I count it as a team morale ace.
---
Smoke is german too. Why else would he gas people
---
Elite skins are based on elite units from operator country.
---
Sorry, what‚Äôs RTK
---
&gt; Nobody plays it anyways when you get more experience.
---
this is why i play it still, nothing feels better than watching new players fuck up giving you the ez win, dont play bomb as people take that shit way to serious
---
I'm quite new to the game and only gold but i'm so confused as to why spawn peeking and run-outs are so adopted by the community as if it is a good thing. Coming from a competitive game like CS i understand that these things take knowledge, but still i feel like it just is a massive anti-fun mechanic that needs to be adressed more.

Are there more people that feel this way?

My smurf is plat 3 and my main is in gold. :(
---
I wish I played the maps like bank or consulate as much as I played skyscraper and fortress. Maybe even the new map outback would be nice to play more than once every 20 rounds.
---
I'm actually kinda concerned if the beak might make him a worse roamer. They'll have to keep it a little closer to his face, probably. Small beak.
---
as a Mute main, this makes me happy.

He should get a full Adidas track suit as an elite skin.Kinda like the slav lord from "escape from tarkov"

What about in-game voice chat?

It's incredible how much renown people can get when they've played for a long time and get season passes. It adds up real quick if you play a lot.

I don't get it, anyone care to explain

New siege trailer, type seige trailer into YouTube and pic the one with dokkaebi and thatcher from 2 months ago

I‚Äôd rather not, I‚Äôm already tired of all the civilian like Elite skins which have been released
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
So you're upset about a casual game? Who's team spawns all in one location? You might have been picked but your team is trash if one spawn peeking Doc aced your whole team. Multiple people had an opportunity to refrag and didn't. Also anything for a W you're in for a rude awakening once you hit ranked buddy.
---
I keep taking the test, but haven't gotten operators I am good with...
---
*why we are still here?*
---
*Just to suffer?*
---
Even once he‚Äôs allowed in comp, he‚Äôs just useless. No one playing at a decent competitive level will drone carelessly enough to fall into a Mozzie trap; so he‚Äôd just be a shitty Mute.
---
Finka. The entire team would be constantly boosted as long as finka hit the ability button every 10 seconds
---
Doc could keep his team at 140 hp
---
Gridlock could cover the entire map
---
Maestro and echo would become super annoying
---
Rook
---
Plz give me elite tho
---
20 "unique" operators.
---
I think all maps should atleast be in casual, no harm in it
---
We already covered this dakine.
---
Its a 5v5
---
5 team members goofing around in CASUAL (A game mode that is taken less serious, You can play serious if you want but thats completely optional at this point)
---
The other 5 is the enemy, lets say if they were playing serious. They have two options: Take the free W and move on to another match OR go to ranked where shit actually matters.
---
I wanna say mean things but then I remember I LIVE favelas and most of the community hates it so I guess to each their own and even if I dont like it I do want all maps in casual.
---
Hans... get the flammenwerfer...
---
I got Thermite and J√§ger
---
That‚Äôs a roamers job, have a close sight roamer and a far sight roamer.
---
&gt;We already covered this dakine. Its a 5v5
---
So your first point is moot.
---
&gt;They have two options: Take the free W and move on to another match OR go to ranked where shit actually matters.
---
And what if they just want to enjoy the game? By your own logic the tkers are being selfish.
---
Im a bandit main and Im triggered because you have black ice for him&gt;:(
---
lol when i look at her ingame i always feel shes built like a dude but its armor
---
Since day one.
---
Then they changed it to have all 10 base ops unlocked for everyone but starter edition players. Lastly, they changed it again to what it was before but now older dlc operators have a price reduction (lowest being 10000 renown, like the JTF2 ops).
---
Also starter edition has been removed.
---
Twitch's Drone also uses Skell Tech parts. 
---
Source: ghost recon wildlands
---
It has dates when he went undercover and came back. It's 2006 and 2010. And the top left corner of the photo has "02/15" on it
---
From what I know that is true. But console makes up a huge portion of the player base and Ubisoft shouldn't only prioritize PC only because they have pro league. A problem this big affecting so many players shouldn't be left as is
---
That doesnt sound right, this game is very multithreaded. It has my 6700k at 70-80% on all 8 threads
---
My point is if you personally don't like goofing around and team damage. Thats alright, others don't like it ethier. But you can't call others selfish that clearly consented and want to do what they want to do.
---
Thank you! From a quebecer
---
I hate getting leg boners
---
Yeah if you can keep control of important parts of the map like rooms above obj then prevent them from killing from up there
---
Finger seams. That is all.
---
They should also make a console pro league and Xbox ps4 crossplay but I think the companies wanted a cut of the prize or something and Sony are really stubborn
---
Whats your definition of "enjoying a game"
---
You could just melee or shoot the downed target, even have as a "hold (whatever) button" like how pulse and Monty used to work. Sometimes I just want to get a tasty finisher after a clutched 1v3.
---
Bartlett had one door...ONE DOOR!
---
Yes and No. They should add all ESL/PL Maps as required ( you can't disable them) and let you add more maps to the pool.
---
By doing it this was, you won't have ppl getting high rank by only playing one map, like the office global Elite in CSGO
---
Ah, I see.
---
Not sure I want to be in the club anymore, 4th/5th game on and I got tk‚Äôd by a guy who said he‚Äôll give me a ‚Äúwelcome to siege‚Äù
---
Just hipfire in close range
---
Tachanka
---
imagine the amounta of turrets killing you or blocking the way
---
Not having some clowns fucking around on the other team.
---
He was still undercover before that 
---
In his second year with BGS, Brunsmeier was assigned to a joint task force aimed at quelling the growing threat of the Red Army Faction(RAF). In 2006 he, was recruited by GSG 9 to go undercover, where he would spend four years embedded with the Hannover Chapter of the Hell's Angels.
---
I've noticed it popping up in silver more. I wouldn't call it crazy frequent because I definitely see it more at gold/plat but it's been spreading into other ranks
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
the physics doesn‚Äôt add up. if you throw an object at a wall that is at an angle, it doesn‚Äôt come back in a straight line lol
---
I loved the details... like the heart smiling and sad.. the unicorn tattoo...
---
Its on Rainbow6 website. Its for new/expirenced players who cant decide who to pick for an op. Its basically a questionaire and it chooses your ops
---
I guess we could call the the German elite. The ges‚Äî
---
Yeah, TF2 has great inventory management
---
Gives hope to the Smoke mains.
---
Bro I totally agree got it last night played over under I went +12 with him in the night. New form. If only I had the black ice from my PS Account to my pc
---
I could recall incorrectly, but I believe the Glaz change is going to be mid season?
---
I did say in the example I wrote "IF THEY WERE PLAYING SERIOUS" which is not even half the players who play casual,  since there is a ranked game mode.
---
And my point is if they are playing serious in casual, which is a low %, they take the free W (if thats not clear thats a good thing.) Or queue for a ranked game mode.
---
But what about U N I Q U E N E S S
---
I could be totally wrong because I don't a source but I had heard Sony wanted cross play on PS3 and Microsoft shut it down. Now the company is just being petty
---
Probably just used her regular gloves and painted to look like skin, so the details are still there.
---
My only hope and wish is that the new ranked mirror the same rules from Road to Six Invitational
---
Fuck no
---
:()
---
I fucking love this game. This type of interaction would be inconceivable anywhere else.
---
Ty
---
Console or PC? The console community is absolute garbage which is why I recently bought the base edition on PC
---
&gt; I did say in the example I wrote "IF THEY WERE PLAYING SERIOUS" which is not even half the players who play casual, since there is a ranked game mode.
---
You've no idea of numbers. We can't just make up shit like that.
---
&gt;And my point is if they are playing serious in casual, which is a low %, they take the free W (if thats not clear thats a good thing.) Or queue for a ranked game mode.
---
So enjoying a game means playing super seriously to you? Because I never said that...shitty argument.
---
When you get mvp and you start shadow boxing everything is worth it
---
Welp no one did since we left drones near bomb locations and some were destroyed. 
---
And he was obviously spawnpeeking, but unlike common spawnpeeks he actually knew where we were and waited for us to spawn. As I said I was barely out of the loadout screen I got capped. And no spawnpeeking is fine, problem was that cover was almost nonexistant for anyone to use during that ambush.
---
Tryhardin yeah takes all of that, but if you're someone like me then its not gonna be fun. Winning is great n' getting extra renown is definetly useful, but if I lose, I lose. Simple as that. Next time I'll do better and take into account my weaknesses. Works every time.
---
Sweet.... So now people will just walk infront of your shots to troll.
---
Lmao gr8 b8 m8 r8 8/8
---
You're avoiding the question...
---
TBH you guys got some good points but there's people who always lose because of trash teammates(mostly people who solo que)
---
Nah wait until everyone becomes bald in their pajamas
---
Update: it‚Äôs 2 by default on PC
---
I‚Äôm not digging this elite skin like ew
---
J√§ger has been an op since the being of the game and he really is a great op and mira is great also
---
Lucky you. They just stare at me or in retarded situations kill me
---
Basically a hype build-up to the community
---
FTFY
---
Yes there were made for Anchoring i believe.
---
The fact that this could work is amazing
---
well it's a big "fuck you to the community" it has me wonder if it's gonna be a major season with buffs reworks e.c.t., I bet Nokk and Warden will be special.
---
you monster
---
K bye
---
Bandit's MP7 and his shotgun is both great but i like the mp7 better! All OP's are really great to me.
---
2 guys with a beard bald head mustash and both are exactly 1.80m
---
First off, watch the tutorial videos for some free renown (the currency in this game)
---
Second, don‚Äôt be afraid to play terrorist hunt and try out different attachments and operators. You can get some pretty good renown from it and if you want you can set the parameters to certain maps and modes just to train aim, learn angles, strats, maps, etc. 
---
And third, don‚Äôt only focus on getting fragging if you don‚Äôt need to. Siege is a strategic game, yeah you can rush if you want or just play it like any other shooter, but sometimes waiting and playing safe might net you a better result then running into a room and trying to John Wick the round. 
---
Also look for some friends to play with! Even if you have just one friend, it will help you a lot more then you think because they can guide you through, whether it be watching your back and providing covering fire or just offering new tups and tricks you might miss out on. 
---
Other than that, welcome to Siege! The community might be toxic at times, but every community will have it‚Äôs bad days. Just take your time to ease into it and spin some circles, because you can‚Äôt instantly become a pro.
---
Edit: If you have any questions about specific ops and playstyles by the way, feel free to ask people what you should be doing in game, they might respond like assholes but it can help you. 
---
i.e. Thatcher should stick with hardbreacher, if the enemy team has a Caveira then you don‚Äôt want to stray too much in case of an interrogation, and if you play an anchoring operator on defense, try not to roam at first so that you get a feel for the operator.
---
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh, grenades has always a good rng for the enemy Fuze haha.
---
Your ban lasts the whole game. So if you ban him because you dont want to play him, you wont be able to use him on your defenses either.
---
Wow, you are something else entirely. People who exhibit the sentiments that you did are selfish. Fifty minutes to work out that explanation exists and then once again fail to read it.
---
And I thought Echo was lazy lol.
---
That's the whole point. Siege is about experience and learning from your mistakes. Newcomer is good but it needs a nerf because it should be like a grind mode meaning that you should get all the XP in the world so you can get to level 30, that's why smurfs love it but apart from that Newcomer is bomb only so that it shows you how the game will play out in the "real world" if that makes sense 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In all honesty, being a secure player is kinda bad because you're not getting all the nutrients out of Siege but if you play Bomb you'll basically have a head start on how to play Secure with less time because you'll just adapt to the room since the Bomb plays gives you more map knowledge by default
---
Lmao
---
XD indeed.
---
Guns that are tan like alibi's default gun skin still have the tan holo but guns that have a default of black have a black holo
---
Which post in Christianity?
---
after the first miss on the downed opponent i legit thought he was gonna miss again and run out of ammo. kinda disappointing at what this could have been.

I'm kinda mad that kapkan's traps don't 1 tap anymore cause in his operator video his traps 1 tapped the bad guys but it's whatever.

We'll go on, explain it in baby terms for my dumb brain. You haven't done it so far. No being snarky or acting like a smart ass, just explain it, word for word.

their height is set when they‚Äôre released genius. they look completely different. two operators having beard and mustache doesn‚Äôt make them exactly the same. again, quit reaching

Well it's like sledge. His sledgehammer can one hit someone but it's better to go for a knife since its faster/the recovery is faster. But a lot of people try to go for a sledge hammer every once in a while because it's enjoyable and incredibly satisfying. It's just a fun mechanic. If someone dies because of it, it's their fault.
---
Why you bully like that

is this the new season?

 Glaze can shoot the cam through the window tho

If I wanted a satisfying takedown I‚Äôd play cav considering her whole gimmick is being stealthy and low profile, and there‚Äôs actually a reward for your risk not just wasting time.

He's saying Buck isn't affiliated with the RCMP in any way (the ones who wear the outfit). It would be like giving Valk a SWAT/FBI outfit.

You do realize that it's from newest to oldest, right? First came Granite Epsilon, which was the Season Pass skin for White Noise, then Chimera, which was the Seasonal uniform for Op Chimera, and ages later came Six Inv.
---
Hopefully, otherwise smurfs smurfing their way into the new comers playlist because they need an ego boost is a dick move

why is this nsfw
---
i think you're getting out of brain cells

Thanks for the tip

Omg I had this exact same idea about a year ago and, the animation would be home coming on horseback with Buck holding the Canadian flag and the Canadian national anthem playing in the background.
---
Sorry I was looking at a pretty grainy image this my bad
---
I‚Äôm not talking about smurfs. for example; I played siege at a friends house during the beta and the first 3 months the game was out. I got the game at like skull rain.

wow who shit in your cereal this morning OP probably no idea that he was even cheating.

---
My dude, spawnpeeking is the lowest of lows
---
that would be worth my money.
---
I think they will do first the non DLC operator
---
Stays for the rest of the game
---
I was agreeing with u
---
Spawnpeeking scum of the earth swine
---
bandit would be a fragging machine if he had angled grip
---
balance is the same reason ash (on r4c), twitch, jager, and more fraggers dont have angled
---
That's false. Norse mythology didn't migrate, the people did, and so their faith changed over the course of the journey. √Åsatr√∫ as we know it most likely took the form that we're familiar with somewhere in Scandinavia. You probably mean just general old Germanic faith when you say "the Norse religion", but there are some distinctions to make between the two that set them apart from one another, so you shouldn't get em' mixed up. Have a nice day.
---
Sorry hibana
---
Imagine buying elite skins lmao
---
It‚Äôs the same way with rook‚Äôs hands on the toile bleu legendary skin
---
If there weren‚Äôt so many shit and unbalanced maps we wouldn‚Äôt need to vote on it
---
Flawless lazy development XD
---
Yeah i realised while writing that this is really subjective now.
---
Oh well, agree to disagree i guess. But i‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs people out there who‚Äôre amiable while conversing
---
What about that furry outfit for smoke. What if it was for cav... Imagine how that would be, get downed from behind, then get intterogated by a furry women. (UwU what's this.. Where are your friends... OwO)
---
Its just her guns can't do all that much,  they can be deadly her shotgun being the better of the two by league but she just doesnt have that mmphh the others have because more often than not you're going to give yourself in a ranged fight and you're going to die gaurnteed. But yeah she is quite selfish when you think about it, but that fits with her character really.  Not like ubi actually has ever thought of it like that. They can barely listen to the community or even so much themselves.
---
I couldn‚Äôt hear shit, I‚Äôm impressed
---
My idea was so he/she‚Äôs like echo in a way or you play him/her like echo at least and it shows which cams are destroyed.
---
Maybe if the cams are indestructible it gives off a bigger warning or you can only scan with them 3 times
---
So I hate to be that guy but some white supremacy groups associate closely with Norse mythical symbols and mythology. Assuming that he was undercover in a biker gang, you‚Äôre looking at Ubi‚Äôs idea of a neo nazi white  power gang member. Or I could be full of shit, who knows.

Oof

They should just bring outbreak back
---
KF‚Äôs are very helpful, i suggest increasing your sensitivity, i run v:75 h:100 ads: 50 but its all personal preference
---
i looked at it a bit more i was actually entirely wrong about that the other cores do seem to be doing something (between 50% and 70% utilization) but while siege is up there is one thread at 100% all the time
---
i recorded some gameplay as well that shows the stutter https://i.imgur.com/yKUdKzX.mp4
---
Rarely, usually toxic players have toxic friends. 9/10 it‚Äôs a clutch or kick bs or kick the new guy loading in because they didn‚Äôt want to wait another 30 seconds to play.
---
you will get it one day!!
---
I also think Thatcher has the most balanced attacking gadget and Mute, Bandit, And Kaid have the most balanced defending gadgets; however that is strongly my opinion.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it will realize your diamond as the highest rank you have achieved.
---
Every year two operators,and finka
---
I‚Äôm just glad they aren‚Äôt chunky
---
nice but i wouldn't want it.

So like the deplorable shield buff or Mira windows?

If I cared about better I wouldn't be playing Fuze

IT WAS SAID THAT YOU WOULD SCOUT THE ENEMY LOCATION, NOT GIVE UP OURS!!

Oh relax. I never said you did. You made it clear that you and no intentions to do so.
---
It was aimed at those who think boycotting elites makes a difference.
---
Got the ass to match lmao
---
I know that I just grouped them together for simplicity sake hense why sledge is situational also how is iq a gods defuser defender 1 good gun 1 ok
---
Gun 1 meh gun and breaches or a claymore I‚Äôm not saying you are wrong I just wanna know why?
---
What do you think cav's elite will look like?
---
Ahh ok, I understand now
---
Who the fuck care? The skin looks good.
---
Nah I'm pretty sure you're 100% correct and thats what the artists were going for. Don't forget the licence plate on Clubhouse used to be 8888AB.
---
Tryhard funny

Uwu as frick
---
What the mf say?
---
I didn't think it would work, but you saved me, many thanks
---
Or if their aim makes it look like they have Parkinson‚Äôs

Your proposed changes to Ash just make her a strictly worse Hibana. Outright making a character unviable isn't the way to go about it. 1. Ash is fun because movement is fun, 3 speeds are fun, the R4C is fun to use, and her gadget is enjoyable to rush with. Shes fun by design. 2. As long as the win delta isn't high it literally doesn't matter if a character is picked a lot. 3. By going about it in a way that makes that operator terrible, yes.
---
The r4 is just stupid strong. Even without the acog it's still a laser.  I almost wish it was worse just so the G36 was more of an option ahah.
---
Exactly. 
---
Not only easy though, also very strong as well. That combo is deadly and still warrants some changes to make her a little more skilled
---
Lmaoo or atleast fire the old devs and hire the fans/ better developers to do the job
---
It really isn't hammer of thor is literally steeped in the idea of calling down lighting.
---
It's Thor's hammer. Bandit's gadget is electricity, that's why they put Mjolnir on him.
---
I just turn on yesterday my XP booster from ubiclub. There are new packages on 3, and 7 days long. Just fast terrorhunt on attack with random people giving 200+ points per match. What are pretty fast. Just take Lion, Finka or others, and it's easy machine to farm renown.
---
Way faster as whole matches, or rankeds.
---
Check rewards in Ubi club. Worth it
---
Woah fuck that got NSFW really fast
---
I feel your pain borther
---
They motion captured the repel animations.
---
How about we do the same with Jager then...? We can't right?
---
Each op has their own utility and more people liking it or needing it and using the op more is no reason to nerf them.
---
It‚Äôs too late. People already bought the skin so it wouldn‚Äôt go down well if it was changed like that after a purchase had been made.
---
You, it's fortress and Hereford for me as well. Just despise playing them.
---
Like the other guy said. Her clothes are pretty common. Also, the makeup required is very minimal. Just some foundation, concealer, and eyeliner.
---
They had to try some more aggressive tactics to fix the bike, clearly the wrench gridlock had wasn‚Äôt doing much. They were attempting to assert their dominance over the bike to intimidate it into running again
---
How original.
---
Here we see the new op displaying its dominance to the player base. Very remarkable!
---
God I wish that were me
---
Good to know
---
Only a defender deals in absolutes.
---
You've yee'd your last haw partner
---
This whole thread gets silver because it gave me the chuckle I needed today
---
Camera?

*draws 44. mag.*

Apparently it's around 35MB Down and 25MBup per hour

---
No it wouldn't. Team Fortress 2 has been home to endless amounts of wordless interactions for over a decade.
---
If thats mjolnir, then shouldnt bandit be prone at all times
---
No problem man
---
Tbh I don't think Ubi put much thought into the whole height/weight thing.
---
Yeah, but once you did it with every op (including recruit with special skin), on every difficulty it wasn't very repetitive
---
What kind of cretin came up with that?
---
Ah yes the G36C. Once again. It's so atrocious that even while having access to an ACOG and 30 rounds, it'd still be outclassed by the Type 89. Win rate is the sole decider of power. Not pick rate. If we balanced around pick rate it would probably be horrible. I'll give some examples
---
In TF2 the spy is the most picked class bar none, while simultaneously being the worst of the 9 classes, should he be nerfed?
---
In Fortnite(don't kill me) the SMG is one of the best weapons in the game, but is also one of the least picked, should that be buffed because of its pick rate?
---
In Titanfall 2 the Grenadier weapons are some of the most used, while being some of the worse, do they need to be nerfed?
---
In Apex Legends, the Kraber has one of the lowest use rates even when gotten from a supply drop, yet it's capable of one shotting anyone from anywhere on the map. Should that be buffed
---
There's probably a thousand more examples I couldn't be fucked to think about. But do you get the point?
---
But Hibana is a hard breacher. There are only 2 main breachers with Hibana being one. She‚Äôs always going to be more useful as is Thermite. This is an integral element of the game. That‚Äôs why all breachers are played a lot because you need them. 
---
Ash doesn‚Äôt need to be as good as Hibana to be viable. I‚Äôd argue 95% of operators aren‚Äôt as good as Hibana but 70% are completely viable. 
---
I guarantee you, and I‚Äôd bet my life on it, these changes would drop her pick rate to probably between 30-40% pick rate and roughly a 0-0.5% win delta, which would statistically place her right in the balanced category and you‚Äôd also feel it in game with her being played not every round, maybe even not every match. And that‚Äôs ok. She‚Äôd still be viable though. Still has a versatile kit and decent weaponry to boot, with 3 speed and a small hitbox. 
---
Let me ask you a question: If my changes, or ones similar were added, what do YOU think the impact on Ash would be, whether positive or negative and explain why? I‚Äôm honestly curious what you‚Äôd view would happen. It‚Äôs all opinion based so no one‚Äôs wrong üëç

Dokkaebi elite leak- Arrogant K-Pop singer
---
how the hell do people do this?
---
Alright reading through this thread is making me actually vomit. It's really easy to say "dokk gun bad cav gun good" but how about I actually bring up some stats so you can see that you're just talking out of your ass.
---
The average kill distance is less than 10m in this game, as stated by the devs. Let's use that as a metric for TTK (remember, the lower the TTK, the faster it kills someone).
---
Dokk's DMR has the TTK of **133ms-133ms-267ms** at armour levels 1, 2, and 3.
---
* For reference, *the TTK is identical to all DMR's for up to 2 armor,* transitioning out of the 2 shot kill range into the 3 shot kill range against 3 armor. This is the same for Maverick and Blackbeard's DMR's. Buck and Twitch/Lion's DMR's remain a two shot kill at all armor levels. The minority of DMR's (2/5) are two shot kills at 3 armor. We can conclude **Dokk's DMR is completely standard in terms of DMR's in terms of TTK.** She also has the advantage of a 20 round magazine, which puts it **above Maverick's DMR** as well.
---
 
---
Dokk's CZ has a TTK of **120-180-180ms.**
---
* Against 1 armor opponents, the CZ has the *second best TTK in the game, out of all weapons,*  second only to the SMG 11. Against 2 armor, *the CZ has a faster TTK to Twitch's F2* (180-184 respectively). Against 3 armor, it keeps the same TTK, still beating out the F2. With this data, our **only conclusion is that the CZ is an incredibly powerful secondary.**
---
Dokk's SMG12 has a TTK of **142-142-189ms.**
---
* Against 1 armor opponents, the average TTK for all attacker primaries is 155ms. *Dokk's SMG12 is above that average with it's TTK of 142*. Against 2 armour, the *SMG12 is 1ms away from tied with the fastest TTK weapons in the game in that armor range*, being Fuze's AK12 and Hibana's Type 89 (141-142 respectively). It is also *tied with the SMG11*. Against 3 armor, the average TTK for all attacker weapons in 185. *The SMG12 is only slightly behind the average at 189*. With this data, we can conclude that **the SMG12 is also extremely powerful.**
---
I could stop there because it's been proven in plain text that you have no fucking idea what you're talking about, but for fun, let's go over Cav's guns.
---
Cav's M12 (which you said is "super good" has a TTK of **218-327-327ms.**
---
* For reference, the average TTK for defender SMG's is 204. Cav's SMG is below average against 1 armor'd opponents. Against 2 armor, **Cav's M12 is BY FAR the worst SMG in the game at 327**, with second place being the P90 at 309. Although there are only 3 3-armor attackers in the game with Monty, Fuze and Gridlock. But just for fun, if you happen to fight any of those three, **it's also the worst SMG in the game.** With this data, we can conclude that **Cav's M12 is fucking terrible.**
---
Doing shotgun analysis is tricky due to all the variables involved, but if you bother to research (which you obviously don't) you'll see that it's a respectable shotgun, above average in the semi auto tier and the fact that it is semi auto already puts it above all of the pump actions anyway. With that being said, **the fact that is it a shotgun puts it behind other defender weapons.**An argument that smoke uses a primary shotgun and is still powerful is irrelevant due to his secondary being the SMG11.
---
Cav's Luison **remains a two shot kill at all armor levels when at the average kill distance**. For a quick recap, most pistols in the game share the same TTK in respect to their shot counts. Two shot pistols have a TTK of 133, three shot being 267, etc.
---
* For reference, against 1 armor, it is a 2 shot kill. **This puts it in the better half of pistols** (11 being two shot kill, 10 being 3 shot.) Against 2 armor,  **the Luison remains a two shot kill,** being one of 7 to remain a two shot kill. If you ever face a three armor, it is **one of the 4 that is still a two shot kill**. With this data, we can conclude that **Cav's Luison is a very powerful secondary.**
---
**In conclusion, do your fucking research before you sit here for hours fucking embarrassing yourself.**
---
How does a fan create better armor then a AAA developer?
---
*A* skyscraper not skyscraper
---
Nomad definitely
---
I feel like the armor would combine making it 5 instead
---
Not the one we need, but the one we deserve.
---
When you place it too close to a door sometimes the defuser gets placed partially outside of the room. In this case you lose the round since the game thinks the defuser is destroyed since it isnt in a room with a bomb and has been placed. This happens because your character model is in the room enough to place the defuser, but isnt in enough to place the defuser in enough.
