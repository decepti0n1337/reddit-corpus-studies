Console players are just as good, they just have less tools to work with. That's why gameplay isn't as quick and accurate, even though the skill level is just as high.
---
Blitz should have died but it's okay.
---
First they team kill me and then on atk or def I steal their operator or if they go ash I get in front of the breach charge and when I can team kill at last round with 1 friend so I don't get kicked

Well welcome to siege! You will meet some toxic people, like there are in all online games. But this game is worth your time to get better at. So if you have any questions don‚Äôt be scared to ask, we all used to be newcomers too
---
Wanna have a funny round?
---
Vigil, maestro, and dokkabe, and clash
---
Wanna win?
---
Nomad, zofia, ying, and maestro
---
It my personal preference but still something to go off of
---
Idk. Second knife looked like it should've hit???
---
‚ÄûSo anyways I startet vote kicking‚Äú
---
Priest doesn't play PL but god damn is he an absolute beast
---
WHERE
---
It did hit but did not register
---
Apparently it‚Äôs not new, anyone know what operation it was released?
---
Ash. That‚Äôs ash.
---
The worst ones of the bunch are the guys +18, at least in my case I have encountered more old dudes acting like fucking 12 year olds and it's sad.
---
Debris but yes.
---
Reverse r/rimjob_steve
---
Oh shush
---
That look like it hurts
---
Lois as twitch is spot on
---
ash?
---
you mean, ranged sledge?
---
It‚Äôs either a headshot or an injure
---
thats the only problem, however i would rather have the chances i get someone i use be higher than lower
---
No, lets be toxic. 
---
Every R6 siege player
---
Ok but what would happen,  would it just go back to random op?
---
According to R6Tracker he is rarely ever out of gold/plat 3. That isn‚Äôt an absolute beast.
---
But if they got banned for looking like theyre using mnk why would they get unbanned since theyd still look like theyre using mnk. And dont you think most mnk users would try to appeal as well?
---
Castles gadget is plenty useful
---
Have you ever seen his gameplay dude? When he actually tries? Most of his content is customs and whatnot but he 100% can contend with mnk players
---
truly I believe nitro are the best weapon of the game, I used to be known as the nitrogod because of the massive amount of kills I got from them.
---
Joe mamma
---
‚ÄúWtf are you doing? Do it again.‚Äù
---
Same , I  built my first ever pc last weekend, haven't bought r6 yet , but I'll buy the edition which gives you every op (forgot the name lol) , cause I'm not unlocking them all over again. Thus far the games I have are for honor ,which I put into my library when it was free and I downloaded it now, and man it feels good to finally be able to play fh with more than 30fps (I've been playing it on ps4 since the Alpha) and also bl3 which I already had on ps4, but it was a reward for buying an amd gpu soo yeah hahaha I'm replaying it with 170 fps this time around....
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ very funny
---
Yeah, was a fun one though. Most of the time the people i get on my team are either high or de-rankers.
---
This is the biggest pro league move I have seen in all my time playing this game, I have never seen someone do something so ambitious.
---
Where can I get one of these
---
Super impressive work, congratulations.
---
They should add a bike cop operator since the maps are so big now.
---
Yee I feel u
---
Yeah man, just how it goes in solo queue
---
For casual anyway, to fuck around and stuff
---
ur his 3rd cousin
---
Man I fucking hate autocorrect. Making 12 become 13 and shit
---
Wrong tag, but well done, I suppose.
---
Pc? Xbox? Ps4? Mobile? Nintendo 3ds?
---
when you're good and have good teammates too
---
Pc
---
Weekend at Bernie's Siege Edition.
---
If I'm in queue for longer than 75secs I'll quit and rejoin. Never had to do it more than twice.
---
This is a fucking particle accelerator
---
http://www.latlmes.com/arts/return-of-the-golden-age-of-comics-1 This. This is all you need.
---
And what are you queueing for? I‚Äôll try it and see how many times It takes
---
That's why I said every other game.. ever hear the PC kids on Fortnite or Halo? All they do is complain about controller
---
My friend hit -700 before they made it so you have to play with similar mmr players. We went against silvers since I was high plat and he was copper. I felt so bad for the others
---
I mean I'd say 70% is ranked, 25% is unranked and the last 5% is all else.
---
tactical quick match would be a great idea
---
Bro castle mute would be absolutely op
---
How does rotation work nowadays? Also why is there a rotation?
---
In Russia, we do not leave witnesses.
---
Man Ubi buffed Fuze without telling anyone
---
Would have been better if you were Thatcher but omg.
---
Now what  ?
---
can confirm am old player
---
i have been getting qued between toxic players all week
---
I remember one time I was playing on Oregon and it was a 1v2, defuser wasn't down, and this dude was screaming at the guy alive to sit at hatch watching laundry. He also keeps shouting at him to "keep calm, you need to keep your cool in these situations" and says it even after we won. I finally shut him up after telling him "shut the fuck up, you're freaking out and dead" that guy was really annoying.
---
Probably.
---
Sledge, Ash, Zofia, Thermite, Hibana, Buck, Finka, Dokk, Glaz, Kali and any other operator with breach charges can still get through them. You would have to manage your resources better instead of just relying on hitting down a castle barricade.
---
I got Rick rolled in 2019 it says
---
High key though ive meet some of my best friends on seige from inviting the random to the party. I wouldn't worry about getting ddosed if its your own teammates inviting you to the party why would they ddos their own teammate if they can just pull majority and vote kick.
---
Maverick, then gridlock, then lion. Maverick is 3 speed, has a great AR, fits in 99% of team comps, and is an S tier op for solo queue if that matters to you. Gridlock is great but I think Maverick is better, and Lion requires a lot of communication and is considered a dick move if you pick him. It‚Äôs like an unwritten rule, you don‚Äôt bring lion and the enemy won‚Äôt bring lion. But regardless of that, he‚Äôs very difficult to use correctly.
---
I like the idea, so do you think that to deploy the bipod should it be automatic like bf4 or we should hold the action key?
---
So basically Family Guy cosplaying every french ops
---
Gold?

Hereford Base, Plane, and House are currently removed from Quick Play.

Hey heres some advice: if u wanna work on your aim w/o worrying about dealing w/ other players, play a shit ton of terrorist hunt! Even better, set the gamemode for T hunt to disarm bomb (This is done in settings) so your experience closely mirrors the multiplayer game mode, &amp; there are waaaaay more enemies in the disarm mode than the normal ‚Äúkill 20 terrorists‚Äù mode. It‚Äôll teach you how to plant &amp; defend the defuser effectively &amp; show you a variety of bomb sites so you can learn the maps. I tend to start up a T hunt or two before I join a live game, or when I just feel like tapping some heads w/o stressing. This really helped me improve, hopefully it does for you too!
---
Jackal is op and kaid is necessary on some maps. Its a very good alternative to bandit when hes banned or when you really need to secure a wall. Now you can get 3 + 3 walls with kaid
---
Recruit elite skin at the end?
---
We restarted our game and it said we were in a match but it didn‚Äôt put us in one when we tried to reconnect
---
yes, blitz was my main before the patch, the good old days ...
---
does it destroy the barrier? if so, it does work
---
Thats why i send a drone everytime
---
The IDF is not a Counter Terrorist Unit.
---
I literally just done that
---
As someone who is trying to get good with Hibana, this hurts my eyes.
---
It is also on sale through Uplay and Steam.
---
Never had one wow
---
laughs in smash characters
---
No, but Israel's special forces are part of the IDF.
---
IDF is not a CTU it's Israel's military, Green Berets don't do Counter Terrorism, that's the Navy Seal's job, we all ready have Delta Force, it's Maverick, and I agree that would a lit Buck Elite. Pakistan, well that's a controversial country and most nations from the Middle East are controversial.
---
That‚Äôs only because warden exists
---
And tachanka.
---
Yeah, but there are 4 special forces units in the IDF
---
thanks guys for all the suggestions guys
---
Then use them.
---
You don‚Äôt think it gives you any advantage...?

Well, I‚Äôm using it on automatics, it fires at the same rate as normal, so nothing is changing. The only different I noticed is that it sounded funny. If anything it shoots slower.
---
Here is a good rule of thumb. If you don't physically do the action every time it gets inputed. Not matter what is is it's a macro and those are bannable.

I assume you play on pc now, was the transition from xbox to pc difficult

Oh the Roni would like nice with a black ice skin now that i think about it
---
Then you probably won‚Äôt get banned because you probably won‚Äôt get reported, but I find it hard to believe you‚Äôd make a macro *just* for automatics
---
Ah ok, I saw the solid white facing and I immediately went to printed. Very cool, would love to do something like that to have on my desk.
---
did the tracher ask y there arnt any doors and windows?
---
I thought they rotated in maps every month. May be wrong tho.
---
The reason is rarity, nostalgia and exclusivity.

Did you just call me mad after going full internet psychologist on me? I think you forgot some paragraphing there bud. Look how mad I am.

Some words of advice:
---
Never play with randoms or alone if you're trying to play seriously FIND FRIENDS
---
Never use the russians other pistol. Pmm all the way.
---
Is that sarcasm? I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm genuinely curious if it is just me with bad eyes or if she actually is
---
What the fuck? You bought an account? Please tell me you're not that dumb and I'm just reading with my imagination...
---
Great now I want an R6 siege miniatures game
---
And yet, clash is still a better option :/
---
I can't find the exact patch notes about this but I am fairly certain it is only for panitings and wall art. Now when you place the cam it breaks painting raather than attaching to them. What happens in your clip seems fair. It's placed on the board and not the wall behind it. So destorying the board should kill the camera. Just have to put more thought into the placement now
---
There‚Äôs no S5.
---
There‚Äôs 4 season each year and the "season pass" which is really a year pass give you the 8 operators for the year and some benefits. 
---
Y5S1 should come in March
---
Whatre you on about?
---
Exceptional model making skills üôå ... You studying architecture?
---
Ya i see were your coming from but getting an epic is rare seeing as how little their numbers are compared to commons, uncommons, and rares.
---
So even if the devs were doing it for that reason it wouldn't make that much sense seeing as how rng works plus adding black ice for operators via years with every new season or year would make it easier and wouldn't really increase the chance by that much unlike if they added black ice for alll new guns at once.
---
But like i said i understand what your saying and i kinda agree with it
---
Mozzie is absolutely a better Mute. You run Mute when you really want to eliminate all droning. You can jump a Mute jammer. You can't jump a Mozzie pest. Also Mozzie already gets a shotgun for site construction and doesn't have to give up his primary. The SMG-11 is great but it's mostly close range... which is what you have the shotgun for. Plus you're probably running a Smoke so that means 2 less medium range SMGs on the team against an attacking side that already has a range advantage on you regardless of which primary you use.
---
Mute is good, but there's a reason he almost always plays second fiddle to Mozzie in pro league.
---
Favela was last season, I think skyscraper replaced house in casual? I know it‚Äôs banned from rotation in ranked but I‚Äôm not sure casual
---
Yeah same, I use the g36 over the r4c just for the acog and angled grip
---
It's a pretty terrible floorplan
---
I‚Äôll play, I have nothing better to do, My user name is Roll_Man304
---
...... Mute is absolutely drone denial. It's all he's used for in Pro League. Which is why he's almost always played in tandem with Mozzie, especially in narrow maps like Coastline where 1 pest or jammer can shut down a path pretty well.
---
xDDDD, DeviantArt has the best "semi erotic" arts, take a look at the thumbnails of my vids... you may find them alluring......

why do people just kick for no reason

Wtf is this skin tho? xd

---
Those guys are trash, I hate dealing with them
---
The Desert Eagle is probably the gun with the highest amount of decent or good skins.
---
Hibana's rifle might be the most disappointing. A decent amount of good skins but they're all pretty similar (all of them using red as the primary color).
---
it's casual

Oh, I see
---
Cool
---
CSGO esports is top 3 biggest esport in the world, biggest FPS esport too.
---
What I‚Äôm saying is that both Mute and Mozzie fulfill a similar role but one is not a replacement for another. Mozzie can‚Äôt counter Dokk, Lion, and any other electronic based gadget, but Mute can‚Äôt supply 3 different cams and isn‚Äôt as good of a roamer. Yes, the SMG-11 sucks at long range whereas Mozzie‚Äôs primaries are great at long range, but Mute‚Äôs shotgun is better than Mozzie‚Äôs not only as a killing tool but for utility due to more shells in a mag. As for the Smoke thing, you still have 3 other defenders who most likely have mid to long range guns, and what Mute and Smoke lack in range more than make up for it with insanely high DPS with the SMG-11.
---
my left ear enjoyed this
---
the new op: mom

He used to be white. Until the outbreak event happened then he turned brown
---
I use the G36 with a Red Dot and suppressor just to trigger people.
---
You sir disgust me
---
Damn that sucks but you're actually insane
---
That's a decent charm considering others in-game. More importantly I think it's decently sized. The most disappointing was I think the 4th of July charm 2 years ago where it was a cool eagle holding an American flag.... except it looked like it wasn't even half an inch big when on the gun.
---
You don‚Äôt need sleep, you need to get that one renown!
---
*Come on, just one more*
---
Who cares don‚Äôt post on r6 reddit
---
Yeah seems staged tbh
---
Amaru is useful to get to other places faster, Kali is a good Thatch alternative and good with her amazing gun and sidearm. Warden would be good if he could flash or smoke on his own. It just s all based on how you play these characters for the most part.
---
Alright alright, although I shouldn't have assumed, don't need to get mad! That's an awful lot of posts about Xbox on your account though. ‚îê( Àò_Àò)‚îå
---
Ok thanks
---
You deserve an A
---
It‚Äôs not *that* bad, though it‚Äôs not great
---
Plus it helps fix the game, so you should take the little bit of time.
---
 Bro my rank rn would be insanely high if it wasn't for stupid randoms that are clearly not supposed to be playing ranked. Lost so many games with 14+ kills where teammates got none. 
---
Anyway hmu on xbox if you ever need an extra member 
---
GT : SlyBigRig

Stop saying that

Fair enough, i mostly post about xbox because that's what i'm usually playing rn, but siege and most shooters are always pc.

I mean in the pro league i've not seen her be played once and i've looked everywhere for gameplay of her in pro league and haven't come across any.
---
Her and Nokk aren't really good for pro league use even though Nokk can be strong on some maps.
---
Someone's gonna think you're a school shooter. Nice work man
---
Hey if you're NA and need a stack to play with pm me
---
nerfing an already weak operator would be dumb if anything she needs a small buff.
---
Low as shit lmao
---
Honestly I don't like how Siege made changes to Casual cause of Ranked like how they made Casual/Quick Play more like Ranked where they don't switch sides unlike before and how they removed maps from rotation. Like why add Unranked of you're just gonna make Casual more like Ranked.
---
I did that a few times in Year 1, it's not intuitive for beginners. Castle's barricade is inbetween soft and hard breach. It can be destroyed by explosions and sledge, but can't be damaged by bullets, yet you can make holes in it with Maverick. Weird stuff
---
Epic I know how long this would have taken you. When I did one for uni I was lucky my old man was a picture framer so he had a computerised mattcutter . So I went in one weekend and cut out all the walls and all opening so quick. While my uni friends spends days cutting out windows and doors by hand haha
---
Pardon me?

This is golden

Also people who put the bullet proof cams there

Not much but it's an honest pull

You won't be joking when 3 wooden barricades blow up at the same time with Hibana breaching a fourth one.
---
Someone make it and put it on thingiverse tho
---
Did you even read my post or just the tldr?
---
Enemies can't know your next step if you yourself don't know your next step.
---
That sucks, but i can tell ya why they do that. They do that cause they get the point for 1. The kill 2. The assist 3. Also can get more points if they headshot the downed target 4. And to be assholes
---
That was pretty fucking terrible but hey let‚Äôs not be mean
---
This is an oldie from a couple seasons ago
---
They won‚Äôt be putting out operator bundles anymore in a favour of the ‚Äúoperator lifecycle‚Äù program. Where ever season the operators from that season in the patch years are knocked down in price.
---
Exactly man
---
Crisp, clean lock boys
---
Good. Don't, waste of time and money at this point. And all the story was in supplemental material. Not in game.

that's why you use bosg without acog

Hi. Welcome to siege. Brace yourself, it can be a rough start. The community is a bit unforgiving here and there, and honestly the game has a thicccc learning curve. As far as attackers, thermite, thatcher, sledge, and IQ are all great starting ops. Defender wise, rook is primo for a starting op, kapkan, pulse, mute, and the german boys are great defenders and fairly straight forward. all of em. Some high skill ceiling things here and there (heres to you bandit tricking) but easy enough skill floors to get in the door. 
---
Hard to go wrong with any base op besides castle and tachanka. A cursory search can explain that super quick. Also hit up r/siegeschool for tips and more specfic things! good luck :)
---
dont listen to anyone, EXPERIMENT!! Test out who looks interesting until you find who you like.
---
Dont be scared, it's a discussion for a reason. Even when you dont know what you're talking about.
---
It was almost a full GIGN squad
---
&gt;Even when you dont know what you're talking about
---
That's the irony dude, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
For attacking, Thermite and Thatcher are good for starting out. Sledge is also another solid choice because of how simple his gadget is. For defense, I'd recommend buying Rook to begin with, since his role isn't super important but his gadget definitely helps out the entire team.
---
Did you just try to school me and get the answer wrong?

It‚Äôs a higher up government force that deals with them. Maybe do a little research before trying to call someone out

Rook, Doc, Sledge, Thatcher

There are two main types of long-term data storage components - hard disk drives (HDD) and solid state drives (SSD). HDDs reads and writes data from a circular disk. SSDs are far quicker, instead storing data in flash memory, just like thumbdrives do, which is some black magic that I personally can't explain. I specify long-term because RAM is a short-term data storage component.
---
If you have R6S installed on an external hard drive, you're probably going to have extremely long loading times. I have Siege installed on an internal hard drive, and I don't have loading issues. This is because data transfer speeds through USB connections are typically quite slow.
---
TL;DR - put Siege on your internal HDD.
---
Imagine being a Nokk main and not knowing what hard counters you lol. I'm done here.

Atleast you got a legendary skin that isn‚Äôt a literal cardboard fucking box, nice

1. Don‚Äôt throw her gadgets down in certain spots straight away UNLESS you have them in very specific spots, such as creating bullet holes and having the decoys gun showing through it. From my limited experience, I‚Äôve had a lot more success getting into gunfights, backing off and then throwing it down. Most enemies will shoot it thinking it‚Äôs the real you since you were just there. Works really well against fraggers since they shoot anything.
---
2. Her uniform not matching her decoy really doesn‚Äôt matter as the decoy is supposed to be a small distraction. Most people shoot it on reaction (depending on level of play) but unless they drone the room out, everyone will pay attention for a second or two, which can be enough to get the jump on them.
---
TL;DR
---
Depending on level of play, uniform not matching decoys is negligible and use them as gunfire bait during fights instead of dropping them instantly.
---
Give.her.impacts
---
But the quality ended up the same cause reddit compressed the video or sumthing lmao
---
It is kinda in rotation, they swap out the maps in rotation twice per season, it's currently out, but will probably come back soon. This is for casual at least.
---
My pint is soild. It's about using the opertor to the fullest potential. When Thermite is used to his fullest potential you can win rounds. When you use Nokk to her fullest potential you can pick up one or two kills and change the tide of the fight with those kills. 
---
Sure it's harder to get the most of of her but that's not a bad thing. If anything more operators need to be introduced like that. Wamai is a great example. Sure his gadget is good but you have to put it in the right places.
---
Solid Snake would be proud
---
This is beyond science
---
"They said it could not be done"
---
the ranked rotation is with the best balanced maps, as an example villa is a really bad map for siege strategy wise, u cant rly do anything.
---
wait, is it a cosplay? Holy shit, I'm impressed (by both, pic and costume)
---
Just logging into the client counts as hours played.
---
Thanms to photographer, who made this amazing shot (Sketch Turner)
---
Probably
---
The problem isn‚Äôt native K&amp;M support. It‚Äôs 3rd party devices such as XIM that are the problem. That‚Äôs an issue for Sony and Microsoft.
---
Why do other people do such cool projects in school? All we did was maths and shit. Most interesting thing we had was building the house of Nicolaus. Fml.
---
When is that coming ?
---
Little less than 3 months
---
Amaru is good as a fragger and flanker.
---
Warden can be useful if you know that your enemies like to run smokes,ying and flashbangs. It all really depends on the attacking meta with his case. If warden got released in the time where Ying+Smokes meta was a thing,he would've been quite strong.
---
And kali isn't that bad,you just need a good co-ordinated team so she doesn't end up alone in a 1v2 or 1v3 situation.
---
Yasss nokk must be a 3 speed
---
It‚Äôs surrounding Sydney there‚Äôs only one way in or out of Sydney atm
---
Ahh. Well you cunts are cooked then i guess.
---
I think the same!
---
Won't be buying this seasons pass but I'll think about the next one!
---
You help was appreciated, sir!
---
Aight, imma wait ..
---
TY üôÉ
---
Dlc is not included the promo. I already tried :(
---
Family pizza is meant for only 1 family member (me) right?
---
Seen worse
---
Agreed, currently in mid to low gold but I feel like I should be in mid to low silver. When I play with players of that rank the matches are way more fun because I can actually play the game, instead of getting shot from some position I didn't know existed.
---
Looks nice but why is Elite Hibana small and dazed?
---
Once waited 21 minutes, got up to go to the toilet and snack something really fast. In the meantime it found a match and kicked me for being afk
---
I suppose, why not
---
moi non plus, mon viseur est tres bas au moment ou je tire en plus
---
I feel like this season Casual (Matchmaking) has become even more toxic. On xbox I got team killed for shooting a camera before someone else
---
Please god no. Not only would this likely be a shitty show that might divert funds from the actual game, if it was in the anime genre it would be √©b√®ne fucking worse and likely ruin the experience for most players.
---
Not me...rookie
---
I think devs have better things to do. Can you imagine how hard it would be to make it work?
---
*trigger hand shaking*
---
Trophy, or throne?
---
Cause throne duo site can be attacked from above. I've fallen to it once.
---
If you hate the enemy team having an echo there are two good solutions. The most effective is to take IQ and go below or above the OBJ bad kill them with a suppressed pistol. The less likely option is to take thatcher and throw an EMP out, disable it and look for the sparkly blue pizza box
---
Ah ok, so the echo players would actually have half a brain and you actually have a point. Have you tried iq? She is a good counter to the drones
---
Hello buraki35, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eekcjl/currently_getting_server_ddos_on_ps4/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I guess so.
---
But yeah
---
I really don't get why they refuse to consider to remove friendly fire on casual, that's where most of these kind of behaviour happens. I can't even use their useless report button since I got kicked right away
---
Don‚Äôt tell them your fave then, unless your main is blitz or jackal or something chances are you‚Äôll be able to play who you want to.
---
u got the EPIC BANANA SKIN MY MAN
---
Ok yeah you're probably right. I don't remember vertical play in throne, but the other one definitely has a soft ceiling.
---
Yes it should
---
r/siegeacadamy 
---
Thank me later lol
---
Having it be standard is so much more sensible though. Imagine bleeding out and thinking ‚Äúthis is rather quick. They must have used a 762 round meaning  it could be Zofia, Glaz, twitch or loin with the 417, or three other weapons. Plus attackers would have an inherent advantage with DBNO bleed out simply because defenders you smaller caliber bullets. The more you actually think about it, it‚Äôs kinda, gimmicky and pointless
---
Not to forget the chat....quality chat.
---
We just need a small map buff where throne room has vertical gameplay,after that I'm fine with the map tbfh
---
Its funny epic meme
---
Welcome to the grind. Earn those ops
---
Idk
---
What helped me get better is to learn the maps and watch how the pro‚Äôs play. I‚Äôm a good shot but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything if my map knowledge isn‚Äôt good.
---
YES IT IS GARBADGE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
The only correct response
---
Yup
---
Yeah I knew the name of this post was a bad idea lmao
---
Maybe because he was just messing around
---
rrrright
---
No overthinking is a good tip i think
---
Another day , another poster that didn't restart his matchmaking at 3 minutes due to not looking at the other hundred posts

I will be sadder than usual then.

Yeah but it apparently works in general and other ppl tried it to, so...

Nice edit! That nitro cell on the claymore got me good

Check out kaosx's videos on YouTube. Watch pro league. Check out r/siegeacademy

You mean they tried it on TTS . Cause it's keep crashing people's games before they release another test server for Vulkan

Wouldn't it be better to hide Yokais around the site or an area you're actually holding considering the Yokai can stun opponents and stop defuser-plant animations. Bulletproof cams and BlackEys can do the same job as this yokai.
---
That Bandit's C4 though...

---
Actually higher ranks are probably the only place she's really ever that useful (maybe super low ranks too?).
---
The further down you get from competitive play the less useful she is. Just because no one uses her in Plat 3 doesn't mean "at the higher ranks she seems useless"
---
Guessing she got a fat grzmot to the face.
---
I have one in site
---
Whether an operator‚Äôs ability benefits only themselves is kind of irrelevant. Siege has already decided to go the way of having this type of operator and usually (if not always) it is for fragging. Getting kills benefits everyone, not just you
---
No.
---
do you know how much that would fucking cost in liscencing prices? Because i dont and i dont care, give me the **C O L O N E L**
---
kaosx and his videos changed my life
---
Buy it.
---
I've seen level 0 play quick match instead of new comer playlist then whats the use of that
---
I got my elo from a match that ended in the maintenance
---
Oh, damn, didn't think about that.
---
Thx for pointing that out.
---
The advantage of Yokai is you can move it around which is why playing aggressively with Echo is usually the norm. Which is why he is the top banned operator.
---
I've usually seen it written that way so I assumed it was the normal format. Sorry I didn't cater to your preferred style you fucking loser lmao.
---
I third this, it takes em out of the fight
---
If you play a match and the maintenance starts before your match is over, you don't get elo or renown. This has happened to me so many times that I am sure of it.
---
KFC Gaming is an official thing,no joke. 
---
Plus,Rainbow 6 Siege has won in it's voting tournament.
---
So a KFC x R6S thing is quite possible
---
It was also point blank
---
I hear people hate her Elite skin and just outright tk people that use it.
---
I grew up on casual tho
---
Currently in my school we are building a house! It‚Äôs really shit since we can‚Äôt use actual knives (even though we are almost in high school) and so all the pieces are jagged and there are two floors with no stairs. We all have to use the same template :(
---
Definitely shouldn‚Äôt. Hiding things in a UI is usually pretty straightforward. They‚Äôll probably just need to disable a few ops or something. The usual.
---
Free weekend already?
---
Thx a lot for the reply, my main issue is that I can't constantly press some keys as I get cramps. For example, the shift key. If I constantly keep pressing it I sometimes get pain on my pinky.
---
Who's gonna be the one to tell him that he misspelled chihuahua?
---
I think they should get invite  only because they won last invitationals.   So they can defend that spot
---
Can confirm. She is indeed a red head.
---
Redhead with short hair AAAAAAAAAA YEAH!
---
Hell I just want a "Haven't played in a few months" playlist so I don't get stomped when I come back to it.
---
Yeah only the smg 12 has way more recoil than th c75 and if you dont have perfect recoil control (like me) the c75 is a better choice
---
Same thing just happened EXCEPT I was kapkan 
---
And decided to be toxic
---
Would love this.
---
???
---
Why? Why would you ever.....
---
The only difference is that we use /V instead of N
---
This a joke please dont kill me

This has actually started to get a decent amount of support off late. With the new defenders being able to either tank or burn out or do both to attacker projectiles, outback has started to become heavily defender sided. Sorta like Hereford, but not gloomy. But much worse of a maze.
---
I'd like to see it buffed to remove that stupid lizzard maze and cut out at least one staircase.
---
Fookin noice
---
This is my background now
---
#metoo
---
Good luck against a well coordinated defense running wamai, J√§ger, goyo, maestro/Mira/valky and vigil.
---
Projectiles? Doomed.
---
Utility? Doomed.
---
Roam clear? Doomed.
---
Intel? Doomed.
---
Gun play? Doomed.
---
What else does attack have other than those 5? Nothing else, and the stack above is just one example of how defender can easily lockdown outback thanks to it's maze like defender sided layout.
---
Tasty.
---
Do you even have any idea how OP broken that is?
---
Og casual?
---
Thank the stars ubi doesn't listen to the sub.
---
Maestro!! Super pumped :)
---
But you don't code AAA games with a lot of backend etc. It's completely different.
---
Yeah, you and me both......

Lol
---
The Monty [Uniform and Headgear](https://imgur.com/a/yHwYZvz)
---
1. Lives far away from the closest servers
---
2. Shitty ISP monopoly
---
Anybody who's actually played high ping knows how bad it is.
---
Do you use the fire on site? Or maybe behind you like Nomad's anti-roamer bombs?
---
Do you also know if his fire can destroy Maestro's Evil Eyes? Just saw one mightself and hesitated using a bolt on it
---
Aim assist is only for C4 I‚Äôm almost 100% positive, even if it‚Äôs not you turn it off and less recoil? What. Since when does T hunt have less recoil? That sounds like BS propaganda
---
big deal
---
What‚Äôs the Monty uniform and headgear look like?
---
Got one for my least played op but this was nice anyways.
---
Please tell me this isn‚Äôt real lol
---
It might be hard at the begging but it's not so hard to learn basics witch u need to be good at pc stuff , the only thing u should remember is to avoid pre-built PCs like it's the dumbest thing u can ever do if u buy one of them
---
I've been using a game called Aim Lab to get my aim back to par, it's been very useful!
---
Oof
---
The shotgun?
---
Niche use, regardless of the range.

---
And on the day I leave to go out of town, what a clutch
---
Creating a skin takes time, time is money, and since we got this for free ubi does not make any money from it.
---
Giving players 25k renown takes like 10 secs.
---
Cry more about a free skin.
---
Pls ignore my rank I'm not trash I swear :(
---
Lucky I got nokk
---
I'm the only guy who can't lauch the game wtf
---
Well, the price reduction is great for getting OPs now
---
You can get year 1&amp;2 OPs for really cheap
---
Turn off the game and the to it on
---
Wait are they giving out free operators now
---
r/controversialcomment

No problem. What do you play on?

If you have a ps4 report him username is :rascalboy714
---
Use drones and cameras so you‚Äôll know where the enemy are. It helps a lot with slow reaction time. I suggest play thunt classic on house only (on normal), learn the terrorist positions and just speedrun it, go for headshots only and as fast as possible.
---
Clash last year, Warden this year.
---
second year of being clowned
---
How do you get that
---
There‚Äôs a leak for a proximity sensor as secondary
---
Haha my first reaction was that too. But I ain‚Äôt complaining tho it‚Äôs free
---
They give a free op! I shouldn‚Äôt have bought the new ops before now...
---
Yeh that's ubi's Christmas present they mentioned on the top of the page
---
Yeah, I learned that mistake 10ish years ago. Lol
---
ikr
---
thanks great gift for the fan base well played
---
yeah but i could‚Äôve gotten so much better ops
---
Tfw you only have one op not unlocked, and that's Clash, because you despise Clash with every fiber of your being and vowed to never unlock her.  Hehe.
---
Excuse me? Yeah it is, I did it with my friends and I see others doing it all the time.
---
Im really glad that this is a thing now, it truly is an amazing gift for those that don‚Äôt have full roster. Although the monty gift is a bit disappointing tbh but, can‚Äôt complain.
---
True, I'm saving up for Lion right now, which is a hefty grind... but I'm getting there! I don't play this game nearly enough so it takes me.
---
 forever to earn enough renown for anything haha
---
They won‚Äôt ever, they work 8 month long on one op
---
I agree it‚Äôs different. However, it‚Äôs as much work as it takes to have it appear with a lock symbol. If they have done it once fairly quickly they could do it again with most likely less work as they aren‚Äôt working from scratch
---
If we look at this from a networking point of view, imagine two people. One has 9ms ping and the other has 100ms. They both peek and get headshots on each other at the exact same instant of time. Now the way the servers work is that they count the kill towards whoever managed to get the message containing that data to them first. So the guy with 9ms would get it to the server much faster than the guy with 100ms even though they both had the exact same level of reaction time and aim.
---
There‚Äôs no lesion good
---
They won‚Äôt remove any op ever
---
Yes
---
YESSSS!!!!!
---
I mean... an ace is an ace
---
Just cause im a bad guy doesnt mean im a BAD GUY
---
I promise controller can look much much better than this. This gave me anxiety
---
Where can i get this pic in good resolution for a wallpaper?
---
its amazing
---
Don‚Äôt peak windows at all anymore
---
What rank? That champion rank on the top right corner you mean?! Only real pros can get this.
---
why not?
---
please tell me it is real
---
that is amazing man
---
Ubi have given every player a free op in this gingerbread pack thingy. Go to notifications it'll b in there
---
&gt; The r/R6 mod team will prune posts about the packs
---
#I see this as an absolute win
---
Facts
---
It's beatiful
---
Nice I got Maverick
---
No
---
I'd get the Shifting Tides ones if you have the renown.
---
Got Echo, one of two operators I was praying I wouldn't get, the other being Clash, haha. Oh well, congrats on everyone getting characters they like!!
---
Will there be another chance to get Monty new skin? I didn't get it because I don't have all operators but I really want that skin :(
---
I got gridlock
---
Damn as soon as I go out of town
---
Yessss
---
Tnx for your help
---
got mozzie, quite like it becouse i want get more into roamers as a full time Anchor now
---
Chances are, you‚Äôre gonna lose
---
Kali exists. A op sniper OP that'll fuck you up if you try and spawn peek her
---
Same dude, i really couldn't tell which operator liu kang was supposed to be until reading your comment
---
oh god
---
And have echo's gun
---
Its silenced and it fits hers character
---
Not up on PS4
---
I think he's getting a price reduction next season. Every year of the same season gets 5k off. I'm pretty sure that's how it works. So since next season is the first season of Y5 and he was released on the first season of Y3 then it'll go down from 20k to 15k
---
Its insane im gonna be iq main
---
The human eye can definitely tell the difference from 90 to 144. I have a 144Hz monitor and it's pretty clear to me 30 vs 60 vs 90 vs 144. Siege runs for me around 110 and it's fine for me.
---
I mean.. At least you didn't have to buy them!
---
I‚Äôm not trying to start a fight but If you just put some time into the game it doesn‚Äôt take that long to level up and sorry I don‚Äôt pay attention to what ex I‚Äôm getting like you are, I just posted this to get it out that this is how I feel about the game and you feel a different way so sorry I offended you
---
I‚Äôm on console and I‚Äôve played a few games already
---
My username is xMagik-J20 I can't accept rn
---
Outback is fine for me
---
They might still be adding them for console then, just wait I guess
---
Ok then üëçüèº
---
the ember rise seasonal operator skins are commonly looked down upon due to it being incredibly difficult to spot enemies on certain maps.
---
Got another ace today 3 one taps with the lfp and 2 knifes
---
All luck
---
It'll refresh the game and have the new free Christmas pack that Ubi is distributing right now
---
I've seen guys trying to sell these shitty Alibaba ACOGs at gun shows for $1,300 and I'm sure people have bought them
---
Buck Brian is odd one out because he‚Äôs not in gign
---
Ok üëçüèº
---
Won what?
---
Not on PlayStation
---
You are redeemed
---
You didn't offend me you just lied for no reason so i was proving you were lying. And you said in your last message it takes a good day of grinding to get half a level up for you so it takes a long time to level up for anyone who can't do that.
---
I was on ps4 for a few years but have switched to pc for the last 900 hours. Stuck with gamepad for its comfort. It feels easier to aim on pc than console too. You can do well without the best aim in siege. I can hang around low gold fine. 2000+ hours helps with a strategical advantage but if you're new you may struggle a bit, that being said, I wouldn't think mouse advantage would be as apparent in lower ranks. Back buttons/paddles help keep movement more equal too.
---
In some parts of this, yes they had to come over there and spawn in that side, but the fact you still made the hole bigger, your team was also shooting at them, and they definitely knew you were there, that was pretty cool
---
I like your name
---
Hahaha finally someone who understands ela is not thicc
---
What am I missing
---
The helmet is a bit too big for your head lol
---
lol
---
Technically he had 0 minutes on that op, so he played it the least
---
That is why you never skip the kill-cam
---
I got [Kaid](https://i.imgur.com/Bs5ovJg.jpg).  
---
That is actually not completely useless! Thanks UBIHARD!

That happened to me too but you're fingers and firearms will eventually get used to it and start getting stronger and have more endurance. There were plenty of times I had to stop playing for a while cause my forearm was on fire lol

Happens. Move on.
---
How long does this event last? My friends are all out of town and we're deciding if I need to go break into their houses and log in for them
---
My definition of grinding is clearly different the yours
---
Nice, not sure how hard AimLab is but I‚Äôve been using Kovaaks and it helps a lot too
---
Whelp there u go I am wrong lol
---
God dammit
---
What's your definition of grinding.

Thank you guys for getting me Kali so I don't have to spend my renown on her

Just sweating for a few games

No but I like it

Also it depends on the game

Lucky. I got clash. :(

when i play terrorist hunt that's the only map it matchmakes me to
---
Well we are talking about rainbow.
---
Been plat the last two seasons, and I just have to say. WHAT IS THAT
---
I don‚Äôt know what your sub feed looks like, in mine people complain relentlessly. 
---
None of the ideas fixes the problem, because the issue here isn‚Äôt how big the stack is, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs: (1) a bronze whose actual skill level is closer to diamond, which boosts anyone who queues with him; and (2) an unranked guy with plat MMR (which implies a diamond MMR the previous season, because of how the soft reset works) who can queue with anyone, either averaging down the MMR of someone else (if he queues with diamond friends, he allows them to face easier competition them they would have without him) or averaging down his own MMR (if he queues with a low rank, he runs his placements against silvers and low golds). You only need a stack of TWO for either of these manipulations to be possible.

Hello nightmare fuel

Imagine not being able to pump 
---
This post was made by M590A1 gang
---
It‚Äôs a free operator pack they do it on Christmas
---
"Oh putain"
---
If we‚Äôre rating how fast I would leave the game after I get spawn peeked, this is a 10/10
---
Yeah sometimes it does the same for me
---
Game is 10x better when you have a team to communicate with.
---
Welcome to online gaming
---
Call me crazy but I only play Ranked (because I‚Äôm a normal fucking human).
---
hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I don't care about Montagne. Sorry but this skin is not a good gift compared to a free operator.
---
Congrats! Mav‚Äôs a great operator for anybody, especially for solo queue.
---
Can we get F's in chat for this man please?
---
She was design to be a defender on attacking team. But without defending advantage.  
---
As a defender. You can guess where attacker will come from and be there.  
---
That's not the case with Nokk. It's hard to hunt the roamer. I rather play Jackal to counter roam than her.
---
It‚Äôs available for every platform, but if you didn‚Äôt get yours then try restarting your game. If that doesn‚Äôt work idk.
---
Nice job have fun!
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to move
---
Thanks its supposed to be a gif im gonna fix it
---
Every weapon in this game exists, the revolver is also used with a zoomed scope by the GIGN
---
Can we talk about why the Commando is an "Assualt Rifle" but is the in 9mm, but the K1A is an "SMG" but is in 5.56? Ubi you make me reeee
---
U have to understand that when making the game, Ubisoft forgot to include centripetal force.
---
A packet is a segment of data. Packet loss is when that data segment fails to get to its recipient. 
---
Here what probably happened is the packet containing your ‚Äúshoot‚Äù requests got lost somewhere so the server never found out that you were trying to fire at the enemy. Your client thinks you fired, but according to the server you‚Äôre just standing there looking at him. 
---
Something people seem to forget is what you looking at isn‚Äôt reality, but what your client thinks is happening based on what the server tells it. That‚Äôs why you get issues with high ping. Your world is a few milliseconds behind.
---
ACOG removal won‚Äôt do that much, high ranks and pros mostly play her with holo
---
Siege players just be like that sometimes. One time I got votekicked while loading into a match because my username (tap mcshoe) was ‚Äúfaggy‚Äù
---
&gt;Dude, try reading the whole study and not just the abstract. This was a survey with a relatively small size and was entirely retrospective. Which means that they weren‚Äôt getting info from people currently coping with an injury.
---
Funny you say that when you define masculinity &amp; "toxic masculinity" based off the social abstract traits from your own environment-society. Also 450+ runners is not a small size by any means.
---
&gt;At best it shows that men and women tend to have different coping mechanisms
---
Carefull with the congnitive dissonance. And so we agree lol.
---
Masculinity¬†(also called¬†manhood¬†or¬†manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men. Although masculinity is socially constructed,[1]¬†some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced.[1][2][3][4] - Wiki
---
They could have sited more for references for the socially constructed one but they did for the latter "biologically influenced", funny though this also some how proves my point, you can and should set standards for masculity socialy ( if done the right way, conforming with the biogical gender like i said in my last reply's paragraph regarding nurture &amp; nature - select, modify and create environments correlated with their genetic disposition ) but indeed some standards and characteristics are innate. But not the toxic behavious that started this debacle.

Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.[8]¬†Traits traditionally viewed as masculine in¬†Western society¬†include¬†strength,¬†courage,¬†independence,¬†leadership, and¬†assertiveness. - Wiki
---
But these particuliar standards are actually shared worldwide, mybe because men on average tend to have these characteristics inherintly. Or are you suggesting all societies around the world push the idea of men to take risks or something like you said previously regarding firefighters.
---
&gt;Sociology is a valid form of science
---
Never said it's not, but its very subjective and can be subject to stupidity and corruption. The concept of "representation" in the west is a great example. Also do i have to repeat my self regarding certain definitions.
---
&gt;Honestly the fact that you didn‚Äôt even address my point about neuroscience is proof enough that you don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on and are just throwing out random jargon to try and seem like you know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Again thats rich coming from you. Especially "adress my point" because you're not adressing anything of what i said.
---
If that survey isnt enough for you [read this ](https://www.mentaltoughness.partners/gender-differences/). 
---
"These four, natural design differences listed above are just a sample of how males and females think differently. Scientists have discovered approximately 100 gender differences in the brain, and the importance of these differences cannot be overstated.¬†Understanding gender differences from a neurological perspective not only opens the door to greater appreciation of the different genders, it also calls into question how we parent educate, and support our children from a young age."
---
&gt;And then you go and use a study that can‚Äôt even remotely be considered neuroscience, it‚Äôs just straight psychology (based on surveys on survey monkey). I was ignoring this because I knew it was just going to be more nonsense but dear god this is too ridiculous not to respond to.
---
I dont remeber linking that study to neurology even though in fact the difference between man and women have alot to do with neurology. Also psychology and neurology can be very interwined and this survey or any study done on a bigger scale prove that and help us understand the human brain better, If we control the environmental and social influences we see how neurological brain activity differs from a person to a other though generaly similar in people of the same gender but also differs on the technical ( brain's tissue structure, receptors and cognitive abilities or information procession ) in people of different genders.
---
You seems to be expressing a pattern of derailing points, dissonance, strawmanning and personal attacks. Its okay not every one is born equally.. i tried to explain it to you but not every one is capable of picking up eveything. Lool back its like you arent reading.
---
He would be broken if he could see through smoke while moving
---
hol up. can we save the pack for after we unlock the remaining ops (i only need 3) and then get the monty stuff?
---
The lord will prevail
---
I‚Äôve been saying this since day one. It‚Äôs fucking silly that a stealth op is louder and slower than the operator with a fucking rocket launcher
---
Dokabae.
---
The pack should stay in your inventory indefinitely iirc, and they did mention if you bought all the ops and then opened it, because it can't give you the operator that was in it, it'll automagically giveyou the skin as a fallback. So you can either guess who's in the pack (unless it'll rather get an operator even if you already have the op in a pack, thus choosing a new one) or unlock them all and use it.
---
Rook, P90 ACOG is a blast to play
---
Oh boo hoo
---
Lol you don‚Äôt play siege much if you haven‚Äôt realized that 3 speeds dominate gun fights
---
I got Wamai LOL
---
You get 1 per holiday season.
---
Bad Gaming chair
---
Yes. They mentioned elsewhere it's a failsafe if you open the pack and already have the op inside.
---
That‚Äôs definitely the main uses for it. They can also be used to flush someone out of a spot. Someone sitting behind a shield in a corner? Toss one of those guys and it forces them to move out or at the very least give up their position briefly. Works great against Chanka
---
Maybe not a turret in the traditional way but one would be nice
---
Ohhh no we are losing, let me leave the game so my teammates doesn‚Äôt lose any mmr.
---
I got Wamai.
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
---
The team mate we all dream of
---
I‚Äôm gold and I do this cause you can stand up and just laser
---
Exactly, I stayed the whole time trying my hardest but still couldn't do anything
---
Sorry if the animation was quite messy but doing animations on procreate is not an easy task, and I couldn‚Äôt make that neo effect on my other animation app
---
I got mozzie, whichis ironic since out of the 25 ops I don't have yet, I get the aussie one, being aussie myself. Never got him simply because his utility didn't justify the cost in my eyes, but hey, free justifies anything.
---
That‚Äôs some pretty solid work mate
---
I think a way to buff Warden which would also buff Valk is increase the damage of the MPX to be more viable.
---
she does. her sniper insta downs any op from any range as long as you hit them in the torso
---
Thanks a lot
---
She‚Äôs always disabled.
---
You get that it was sarcasm right? 
---
People would abuse the shit out of this system.
---
Skins just give something to a weapon
---

Lmao they did Hibana dirty
---
Cute
---
Till jan 5th
---
every new season, do you feel playing the same as previous? do you think twitch‚Äô nerf a couple years ago was right? do you think remaking old maps is good thing?
---
This was a great read, thank you.
---
Jan 5th
---
True da true
---
YES
---
But who would leave just to get a ban? It's still dumb that teammates will leave and you get penalized for it
---
This is why i need a elite tachanka
---
Jan 5th. As long as you log in you get the pack, don't even need to open the pack menu, just log in, logout.
---
Teams. 
---
They will cycle out which player leave the game so they don‚Äôt lose any mmr, ever.
---
There‚Äôs no bad mains, only players that enjoy operators and ash mains
---
Just warm up on unranked. (Xbox player formerly on NA now on EU servers) It might take like 1:30 to 2 minutes in queue but I experience less of this shit.  People are less inclined to do this when they can‚Äôt kick you immediately after I think. Solo Casual on Xbox is literally a joke no matter where you are.
---
I hate having a lot of kills and still losing even more than no kills with a loss. 
---
I‚Äôd much rather go 0-4 with a win, than 15-1 with a loss.
---
I thought all the 10 yr olds were still addicted to fortnite
---
It gives you one pack, and at the point of opening that it determines if you have the ops, so you'd be fine to save it and buy the final op.
---
If you have all them, it turns into 2 packs upon opening*
---
It's not a typo.
---
Dokkaebi, hell yeah!
---
Cav is probably the best out of that combo, assuming you're good at appearing out of nowhere.
---
Sounds about right.
---
How long will this event last? I won't be home for a while and I don't want to miss that.
---
Give it a day, if it doesn't appear contact ubisoft, they can see from the backend if you recieved it or not.
---
They are useable you trog
---
Chihuahua* pls don‚Äôt downvote me
---
Yeah
---
I play the same until the meta changes or if I want to try a new strat.
---
Yes, 30 tazers was op
---
Yes. They've all been good except Hereford
---
You just gotta log in, don't even need to press anything, as long as the main menu shows up.
---
lucky bitch
---
Yes, props to you for the great work on the cosplay but mad props to your photographer. I actually thought this was official imagery for the game at first glance.
---
What I'm saying is, if you're solo queuing and teammates leave you shouldnt lose mmr, on a 2 man or higher then it shouldnt count
---
Follow for answer
---
Say SIKE right now
---
An an an an an an an an an an an an an elite tachanka
---
Where are you that it's almost bedtime? (Just curious!) And as a EE who only had to take a dynamics class and a couple physics many years ago, I'll just nod my head and say perfect post 5/7 with rice.
---
Looks like kane when he was the Christmas creature
---
As a bandit main you are 100% correct.
---
Wow good job you got a kill.
---
It's always like that for me I play 3v4 , 4v5 , 5v3...
---
Man, situations like these are the reason why it's so hard for me to muster up the confidence to actually play this game. Sucks this had to happen to you
---

---
There is a shield skin! Although it could be given away as a prize for a Christmas challenge or something
---
For those wondering this is on an an elite controller, I despite MnK players. 
---
Lower left paddle is set to "B"
---
Upper right paddle is right lean, lower right is left lean. Think turn signals on a car.
---
That way the sticks are always free for jiggling, aiming, whatever. And the triggers are open too. I'm essentially using both thumbs on the sticks, trigger fingers on the....uhmm triggers, left ring finger as "B", and right ring/pinky finger for leaning.
---
Could be worse. Could be Warden.
---
They didn‚Äôt say they were doing their placements, just said they were about to hit diamond
---
Depends on the map and obj
---
okay thank you
---
Actually i was solo queuing because I have no one to play with and this game turned into A 2v5 before I just left because the other team was a 5 stack
---
I mean..... you aimed at his knee caps. Good clip??????
---
I‚Äôd quite like to see that!
---
Get good idk
---
"we've made the drone able to do the loop!‚Äú

Few days later

"disabled clash while we work on a fix for her sudden Spiderman like powers."

If you play shotty thermite you deserve to burn.
---
Last year I came back from vacation on the last day of the giveaway, logged in and it was over. It was around 10 pm central time so it felt pretty shitty.
---
I held out on buying this year's season pass until last week when I decided to buy it. The season pass is on a decent discount and then (I'm not sure if Ubi is still doing the sale) there is an additional 20% off so I ended up getting the season pass for like $14. Not only you get the Ops, but you also get the 600 renown, so I would say it's worth getting!
---
She isn‚Äôt?
---
I loathe this edit so much.
---
But why be a dick when you know how not to be one? ;)
---
Okay buddy. Now I know you're just trolling.
---
Ela recoil is ridiculous even on PC get out of here.
---
I would say so.
---
He's great at clearing utility, has access to smokes, and his assault rifle has a high RPM. 
---
Also the PMM, it's amazing.
---
2nd best. Blackbeard Santa is just too good :)
---
u/SAU_siege you totally predicted the very last scene
---
And gamemode. *Cough* hostage *cough*
---
I personally like Fuze. I just wish he wasn't SO FUCKING LOUD. Enemies hear me coming from a mile away with loud ass footsteps. Though his gadget is rendered useless by Jager or Wamai so. He's meh.
---
He also took the 9.8 m/s gravity of earth, which I would assume is not the same in game, as in many other games it is presumably a lot stronger.
---
I dont actually know tho, because Im much to lazy to do the calculations myself
---
How'd you get the additional 20% off? ü§î
---
You get it by having all the operators, it came fr the pack where you get a new op
---
I got my funniest win on hostage with Fuze. Blew up an enemy goyo shield and the fire killed the hostage so we won the game. Goyo was piiiissed.
---
Wow you killed someone well done.
---
And then t-bagged... **DISGUSTING**
---
She can be pretty useful and she is worth 25k renown
---
I mean yeah but it‚Äôs bigger and blows up when shot.
---
It‚Äôs just an idea
---
lmfao, just earlier this morning I was thinking about that monty leaked skin and though to myself ("I bet that they will give it to people who have all ops") and guess what hahaha
---
I kinda wanted the renown tho, but that monty skin looks really good, thank ubi.
---
Warden.....great
---
I mean yeah just worse guns for balance
---
Year 1, Season 1-4
---
I got lesion hes kinda good
---
I have been playing on pc for a while and the first time I played ranked on console with a controller i cleaned house with the aim that rivals a sack of potatoes
---
In console, brains are better than aim
---
I got Mira.  I'm a little disappointed since I really wanted Kaid, but hey, a free operator is a free operator.
---
This is old and the music is straight out of 2012, weird stuff
---
I second this
---
The Keratos? 
---
If it is that, then only the Italian CTU (Alibi and Maestro) have access to it besides Wamai.
---
The only thing that bugs me about this is when I clearly ask people to leave the mats alone so that I can use them as bait. If you are in a spot where you can wait to kill the mat-ted person, at least check that Frost doesn't want to do anything with them :).
---
Good thing I never play ranked
---
Nothing wrong with dick üòâ (full homo)
---
Oh OK thanks:)
---
One would be still nice
---
Ez clap
---
Why couldn‚Äôt they just give 25k renown like last year instead of a Monty outfit
---
Look at bandits mp7 iron sight and like every single gun in cod mw
---
Got clash, let's go pla- oh yeah she's banned
---
Definitely. His gun is amazing and plus he‚Äôs thick so can take more damage.
---
I don't think they said when it ends but if I were to guess it would be around the end of Christmas and start of New year
---
Why does it matter?
---
Leave it to the community to cry about free gifts
---
I‚Äôm sad cause I never bought the ops I know I‚Äôm probably never going to play so now I can‚Äôt get an awesome skin for my favourite operator...
---
I dunno, princess Blackbeard is quite high up
---
Why are you complaining about free shit
---
That happened to me once, I was pissed at the Goyo. The idiot put a Goyo shield right next to the hostage. One of the pucks downed the hostage and then the shield killed him.
---
No. His gadget is inflexible due to only being useful near he main objective and having to be placed on a soft wall, and being very loud, making him very noisy. Large hitbox and being slow means he's poor in gunfights despite the ak-12. Only mildly useful in specific scenarios.
---
Ooof
---
There isn‚Äôt a logical way of it boosting teammates gadgets and mute is already pretty strong he has good guns ,and counters a bunch of operators
---
He was probably consistently queuing with cheaters. The fuck got what he deserved.
---
I wouldn't say forgot, rather intentionally left out a piece of physics engine that would probably never be used. Which makes sense.
---
Negroidal shaman magic
---
Yeah bandicam does the same

The one thing that I do think would help would be to reinstate escalating leaving penalties.  And then give it real teeth if you go say more than one standard deviation (two?) above average.  That way you make it painful for frequent quitters but also don't punish non-problem players.
---
I'm not there to look I'm there to listen to what he has to say about controlling
---
a hundred on each side or in total?
---
Over ten
---
I got blackbeard :(
---
Ok then
---
The issue is so many people are having issues with reconnecting to ranked matches and getting abandon sanctions for matches they can't join. Also they had stricter sanctions then they had issues with ddosing.
---
Clash
---
The weird thing is how i was on top of valk  so i should of got killed and she should of got low so i guess it's  magic that or dancing can save you.
---
Some maps (maybe all, not sure) are based on real locations. Even if not, we do know the country, which would probably be good enough.
---
i have all of them :)
---
If you own all the operators, your Christmas packs will contain that set
---
I guess I should've been specific. This was on PC. On the site, it had a 20% promo by entering "UBI20". Not sure if it's valid anymore. I don't see the promo on the site anymore. After looking at my digital receipt, I got the season pass for $12.32.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\*EDIT: I tried to do it again, and it's only 20% now if you spend $50. Sorry.
---
I would have thought it would have come with the christmas packs but it didn‚Äôt, so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs another future shield skin
---
What Graphics Card do you have? Rainbow 6 doesn't run on weak Graphics Cards and most Laptop Graphics Cards...
---
Yeah you get the uniform but not the shield skin
---
Would twitches drone be able to do the flip tho with it‚Äôs weird shape
---
he just tells you to go into  a thunt/custom match and fucking spray a wall and try to controll it over and over again. Trust me that is how people get good at recoil controll..
---
Lol she is fun to play
---
I say, either make her a 3 speed, or have her device last longer or a shorter recharge timer so that she's able to move into position faster.
---
Oh sorry, I misread your title. Don't know mate
---
Outstanding.
---
What about TAA or off
---
Thx
---
Ya his CPU and RAM looks good but he doesn't mention what his gpu is.
---
Nokk isn‚Äôt meant to be a fragging operator. I‚Äôve said that like 20 times. She‚Äôs not meant to rack up kills in gunfights she‚Äôs meant to be played methodically and flank. 
---
There isn‚Äôt an operator that does what she does better. She‚Äôs never been one to get kills she‚Äôs meant to be invisible and flank. Stop playing and comparing her to fragging operators.
---
What abt TAA or TAAx2 or 4 or off
---
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760M
---
also: i realized I don‚Äôt have Uplay installed. Could that be the issue?
---
EDIT: they never tell you that you have to download Uplay. That was exactly the problem LMAO
---
That shield isn't part of the bundle, I know it's a legendary skin but not released yet.
---
Imagine Being a Recruit main
---
:]
---
U dabbed so hard on her that she died.
---
Uh no. It was 100% yes.
---
It's fine usually. If there is a toxic person (voice abuse) I just hop in a party with a friend. And there isn't really a way to be behind on the game. So if you want to play sometime, I'm down.
---
And a happy new year to you
---
In what way did you need it?
---
If you are looking for mates to squad up with, use the rainbow six discord. There are voice channels for xbox, and its easier to find people there than on reddit.
---
That's just Everytime that they all go recruit
---
I was afraid from your comment. But after seeing it I actually like it
---
Congrats, you're in *roughly* the top 5 ish percent of the playerbase. I hover gold 1-plat 3 and if people are using mnk I havent even noticed an impact
---
Idk, lol. Just found N√∏kk with a Santa hat amusing. Sp00ky Christmas time.
---
Why did they even make it a loop if I can‚Äôt take me drone through the loop?  It‚Äôs very vexing.  I‚Äôm vexed.
---
... They do it with their friend but you're simply going on a hunch. Makes sense.
---
I got buck! I never knew they did this. This is awesome
---
On console, if you press the right analog stick at the same time you are aiming, you sometimes knife when you try and Lean. This isn't very effective, especially when behind a fucking Vulcan shield
---
Y not cav and bb are cool and fun
---
Try her out she is fun
---
So you're in roughly the top 5% of the playerbase. I hover around gold1-plat 3 and if people are using mnk it hasnt made a noticeable difference to me
---
Thanks for the advice
---
What Call of Duty has a clean up kill??? Are you thinking of the Kill Confirmed stat that shows how many dog tags are picked up by each person?
---
I don't see anything wrong here.
---
Is it a new Monty set?
---
Cool? Why did you comment that twice?
---
It's casual it has a seperate mmr so rank doesnt affect matchmaking
---
They big gay, also monts n blitzs
---
Shut up
---
matchmaking doesn‚Äôt go by anything in casual, use them to get better at the game!
---
The first one didnt pop up as a reply, but as a new comment, so I deleted it and put it as a reply. My bad
---
Is that actually woja tho
---
Stop being a pussy
---
wait can you go through it yet?
---
Ima get kali or gridlock
---
I got the Monty packs but it's not in my inventory , anyone know how can I equipped them?
---
Yea and have a skin that literally buffs him. Yea nah.
---
3....2......1... AND ITS FICKEN GONE
---
&gt; You killed a teammate because they ran in front of you while you were shooting: Vote to kick - Team Kill (x2)
---
Tbf while I try to avoid walking in front of people I think are going to  shoot at drones during prep I've walked into people's bullets sometimes and I get pissed off. They're just drones. Proper set up is far more important than you unloading half a mag to get 1 drone, recklessly shooting near all of your teammates.
---
Nice flair.
---
oooh unashamed spawnpeeker and homophobic, makes sense really
---
Ubisoft will counter this by making the drones slower lmao.
---
To get an ace you have to get 5 people.
---
I mean I‚Äôm sure Ubisoft could make something work I was just saying it would be nice to see montages skin
---
Upvoted. So ridiculous that people are killing others over this.. Going out of your way for kills means squat. If someone is downed in a trap and you aren't near it; call it out or let a nearby teammate finish it. You are still removing opponents from the round and could possibly take out key ops on the attacking side.
