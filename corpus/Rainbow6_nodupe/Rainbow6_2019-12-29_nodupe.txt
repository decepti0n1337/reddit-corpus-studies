On ps4 it‚Äôs horrible, it‚Äôs genuinely hard to find a match without someone using it, either that or I have really really bad luck
---
You can‚Äôt just plug it in and use it, you need a xim which is really hard to detect
---
Not yet, I'm a beginner and still studying stuff, but I'm planning on doing R6 related art!
---
Thank you, sir!
---
I think everyone understands ‚ÄúNO NO NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING‚Äù
---
I see, so im the tasteless one here for always picking Nitrogen over BI
---
At what rank?
---
You can‚Äôt ban someone cause of movement either , I have lots of high plat - diamond mates who look suss as hell but they use controller
---
Dedication! Fuze main?
---
Yikes people still use this meme
---
In plat 2+ basically every game. There's rarely going to be a game where at least 1/10 players aren't using either MnK or macros.
---
raping the mic also works, just make sure to call their ops
---
Mira‚Äôs love this.
---
deebs
---
It was copper ranked anyway, hence the silencer too
---
I don‚Äôt play ranked because I suck and I usually enjoy playing with my friends, which is better when you don‚Äôt care about winning that much.
---
Moving differently than controller users doesn't mean anything unless talking about aim. That's be pretty difficult to do since footage would have to be had, then decisions would also have to be made. That process is a long one and it doesn't even necessarily mean that it's a guaranteed ban. And once again, 3rd party adapters can be made (sadly) if you tried to make the software something like BattlEye
---
If I can clutch a 3 v 1 with Ela's shotgun in ranked, I'm perfectly happy with the shotguns üòÇ
---
Absolutely, anybody who picks anything over black ice should be crucified because black ice is always he best without a competition /s but tbh people will mostly say black ice because its more popular
---
Or you just use your bloody microphone and tell your team to reinforce there? People really need to learn to communicate in this game, i've had lots of complain about losing a round because THEY couldn't open their damn mouth.
---
I hover around plat 3 and dont really see it at all so I guess there must just be a huge jump of usage within that 400 points of mmr
---
Most definitely
---
Ummm, what kind of revolver is that
---
I don‚Äôt think it would be that crazy considering any headshot is a one shot, but maybe they should injure instead of one shot.
---
the blazer with the hibana symbol i think
---
Hopefully bc I want some food cosmetics
---
Okay, recoil is not a problem, cos i can handle smg11 and 12, but ingame my mic succs ass so.
---
Ikr?? Why all the hate ü§£
---
Nitrogen Blast, easy.
---
Its in the community flair
---
I missed one? Darn, is there like a chart that shows every outfit and headgear for every operator?
---
Im an idiot when it comes to software and stuff but would it be possible for ubi to make it so you cant use third party controllers entirety?
---
yes
---
Number 1 in EU last season was snake_nade for most of it, he's an EX-Pro and streamer so it can 100% be a legit player
---
Yeah i didn‚Äôt realize it until recently as well üòÜ
---
How did that hit her leg
---
retard
---
I meant the one you get when you have the Y4 season pass
---
Just give‚Äôm a try amigo, you‚Äôll love them ü§£ü§£
---
I would but I don't have pc, sorry
---
What server are you on
---
I'm not a collectible guy but I want the Thermite just for that dumbass smile.
---
I only care about a loss outside of ranked when a player with critical info doesn't have a mic and it loses us the round.
---
Right now I‚Äôm I ranked but I usually place around gold 2-3
---
*large sigh*
---
I don‚Äôt really get it but none the less more air came out of my nose than normal so it‚Äôs all good üòÜ
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Map is oregon i think
---
Renfs destroy gadgets that are really close to wall, and I guess the destruction is given to the renforcer, so since the source of the damage of the goyo shield is given to it's destroyer, it was given to OP in this scenario
---
No one is selling them anymore, some sold them when PL finished but they were asking for well over $300 for them
---
Managed to get it this season as well. Even getting near to plat2. This season just seems to work for me. Been a few seasons there i kept getting towards 3150 mmr. Welcome to the plats!!
---
I wanted lesion and for attackers i didnt know yet
---
My map name knowledge is quite bad with some and brilliant with others.
---
I also think that helps r6 maps stats. By that, i mean so ubisoft or siege can see what maps people like the most or least. It also kinda helps in choosing new maps for pro league
---
Tower is useless in R6S
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have thought of it but well, still only cheaters and the best of the best
---
Same
---
Oh nice can I still get it? I have the pro league one as well
---
That's true, but good god did he cheese the hell out of his rank.
---
Unfortunately yes, you get more at the beginning of each season
---
Only with the Y4 season pass, got the pl one too ^^
---
Let me see if I still have the Photoshop file on my computer, I'll share it with you.
---
Bruhh plat 2!!! Thats like 400mmr from 3  well done. What do you play on.kinda afraid to play incase i lose it but my squad got me.
---
What a save!
---
F
---
I think she's good, but only if you work with your team to leave cams up
---
Nice I‚Äôm getting that then thanks my friend!! üí™üòÅ
---
LEVEL 84 AND PURPLE DIAMON 67 WL RATIO HOLY CRAP REPORT
---
Why does cav only bully buck?
---
 Thats stupid
---
Pick and ban has improved ranked. It makes it more tactical amd requires you to push differently if a key op like thermite or thatcher is banned.
---
Ubi plz
---
If u don't mind me asking, what rank r u?
---
Top tier shitpost right here
---
what a dick
---
Plat 1
---
O ok
---
Ying is kinda lame as you're really only getting bonus flashes and most people just look away and aren't effected.  That being said her LMG has virtually zero recoil and decent damage with a pretty solid firerate. The pistol is okay.
---

---
Gridlock provides solid flank denial and denies some site entrances all together. Gridlock also has an LMG with little recoil but a mediocre damage and an average rate of fire. Her AR has no recoil and a solid rate of fire but lower damage output. Her shotgun secondary is great for opening up sites, and her pistol has pretty solid damage output. 
---
All together, I think Gridlock is the best choice as she has the better gadget as both have pretty solid weapons.
---
Y‚Äôall ever get both teams to go sidearm only? Cranks the fun meter up to 11
---
SHE THICC BOI

They totally should've done this over the Monty skin.

---
to add to that, if people are in a clutch situation where sound is very needed, a simple ping can help. You can refer to this with the example that your mom is talking on the phone and you point to t cookie jar instead of asking if you can get one, so you don‚Äôt interrupt her conversation.
---
Casual does have some form of matchmaking.
---
Uncharted 1 would be my guest.
---
so far the one destroying my drones are new players and i just tell them not to destroy my drones and we are all happy :)
---
So, can lay down hiding in cheap corners. (could work too good on kanal) 
---
Is invinsible whiled doing so making it way too good for laying down in the corridor between bathroom and living room next to white stairs, awesome for holding a very popular entrance (office) on oregon.
---
Without continuing... your understandment of balancing a operator is very basic. 
---
Making some bits overpowered and some bits useless doesn‚Äôt automatically balance him.
---
Neither did you really think about how this could be abused which would make him get deleted during playtesting.
---
Reworking a operator that has been working since 2015 is not easy, reworking or in your case shift metas and remake tachanka is not easy. 
---
Balancing an operator is definently not easy, and can‚Äôt be done by just having some overpowered bits and some awful bits.
---
That out of the way i hope my arguments might make you rethink this and hopefully i won‚Äôt ride the downvote train down to oblivion.
---
This is amazing! Keep it up :D

Unfortunately I have not found a fix that works anymore. However I contacted Ubisoft support and given all the details they wanted, and they say there is a dedicated team for this issue.
---
Just like my aplha pack collection
---
Those lions are so cute!
---
I upvoted this for the title.
---
 The goyo did nothing
---
The ARX has one of the fastest times to kill in the game if not the fastest if I remember correctly
---
for me? no (7 downvotes and an asshole with 5 lines of comment about how trash my meme and i are)
---
for you? yea why not
---
The vertical recoil isn‚Äôt really the problem. It has tons of horizontal making it quite unpredictable and it‚Äôs really difficult to control the horizontal recoil as horizontal cannot be predicted like vertical

Oh yeah thats cheating. Macros is kinda what you described. Some controllers are made to cheat, and some people gravitate to it.
---
They balance out its pick rate by giving the Commando a sweet ass reload animation.
---
Ubisoft has a website where you can pick which play style you want and it shows up with the operator
---
What is the raison d'etre for unranked now that Casual is a clone of Ranked?
---
I thought you couldn‚Äôt post things here calling out cheaters or showing account names?

There made to cheat and I'm starting to hate the higher and higher is get in plat the more and more I see

isn't it +20 health?
---
Honestly at this point if there at or over level 20 I immediately tk them because there probably being to ic because by level 20 you should know what all the operators do
---
*B R E A T H E* Try not to hold your breath when under stressful or tense moments.
---
Please no
---
There is no way the #1 player is only level 84
---
Unbreakable surface. So it wouldn't allow that right?
---
Well I meant like they're satisfying? ~_~ whatever I haven't watched him in a long time so I don't particularly care
---
Acting like House wasn't already the perfect map....
---
This wins so hard.
---
Why does anyone want a battle pass in rainbow ?
---
I like her on Oregon, when they go laundry room.
---
Ban lesion and you can literally usually walk right through dirt. 
---
Or on kafe, if there is no lesion when they go bar, rush right white stairs.
---
Usually Book rushes only work once as the other team will usually catch on sadly.
---
They could have a similar dialog system too
---
You lucky... the best pistol in the game, I wish...
---
Buck and Valk
---
It's already been announced. It gives us something to do. I get diamond in the first week and then get bored until the next season
---
Such a great combo that you killed ash
---
Some of those are probably keyboard and mouse players as well.
---
Op do you take constructive criticism?
---
Ahhh I see now but wouldn't it be cool if you don't put slowmotion with effect that misleads other people into thinking it's something to do with the ela mine
---
Because that drunk effects distract me from seeing the kill you intend to show
---
Aways welcome
---
Are you just bad or are you new at siege?
---
Anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to cheat on console? I‚Äôve always been curious. As a console player, I‚Äôm grateful I don‚Äôt have to deal with all the low life‚Äôs out there who cheat, which seems to primarily happen on PC?
---
P10 *s u c c*
---
Then just grind to champion
---
As an friendly player: look for some Guides, play through all operators and search for 1-2 mains, and keep playing
---
As an gamer: git gud
---
Nah they just have really good gamer chairs /s
---
Why you against it? You aren't required to buy it
---
You have been removed from the match
---
Frosts weapon was still used by Canadian military up until not that long ago, at least that is what my uncle told me he was JTF2
---
Yeah i do, its a nice easter egg
---
Just gain more experience, take advice from better friends on your operators, and finding good mains is a major plus too
---
Truly
---
He posts videos of himself using the blatant hacks on YouTube. Apologists please BTFO.
---
Damn that was clean
---
Valk is big chungus compared to the others
---
I just don‚Äôt like the idea of battle passes and there‚Äôs enough micro transition in siege
---
you literally shouldn't have gotten any of those kills but still a quality ace (not including the aim)
---
Could you report his YouTube channel as well? He promotes the hacks he uses on his videos so I don't know if it violates anything?
---
Hello NotLucas21! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**

This looks like recruit showed up to late for the mission and is just wandering around in shock.
---
Fact: on PS4 a guy named child smeller fuzed the hostage
---
Once again you aren't required to buy anything. Every micro transaction in siege is cosmetic only. Having content like this keeps an active community. Just cause you don't wanna buy it doesn't mean others don't
---
Dokk
---
Dokkaebi.
---
He's obviously just a pro that we haven't seen before. Maybe hes just pure raw talent
---
Yes!
---
There is a good chance that there are the MnK players but you can see the difference between them both
---
one big fucking hole in my wallet coming right up
---
I mean yeah each to their own . I just don‚Äôt think siege needs a battle pass .
---
I think I am he has good ping and I wish I had it
---
When do the moderator applications end?
---
Oof nice
---
I mean it's true, the C9 should outgun the p10 easily, **BUT** for some reason it's just good and I can play 10√ó better with it, when I bought him I thought the recoil would be astronomical because it's just a pistol in a housing, but I was wrong... it's a laser.
---
At least have a 3 stack even if your shroud 5 average players will be able to kill you no matter how skillfull you are
---
Damage isn't as important as an acog, people are less likely to challenge a long angle with an mp5 holo than an mp5 acog, especially with a 3 armor.
---
That one poor guy getting rushed by like 3 people
---
His comments are atrocious in the video given to us in the link. He sounds legit proud of himself for cheating and goes on like he‚Äôs a pro.
---
To each their own. I prefer the commando for the higher capacity, and the lower firerate also helps with it being very easy to control too. Though it's definitely a superior choice for those who can deal with the lower capacity combined with the higher firerate.
---
Use smoke , doc &amp; kapkan for defence . They give u a basic idea for defence . Use ash , iq &amp; thermite for attack . Support is very important lesson for beginners .
---
Maybe that was what he was saying about it but but I could have swore he said he used it before while he served but could have used old ones in training
---
Usually having decent internet speeds through ethernet and living nearby servers is easy for getting good ping

She is the version that come with an ingame charm code so she bigger in size and more detailed

I think I have seen this in a video before

crucial? of course not. is it easier with a team? yup, that's how this game works when the majority are in silver/gold and deserve to be there

That ain‚Äôt snow, pretty sure that dude is just in the lowest graphics settings
---
Pings are really good. Now I wanna kindly talk about accessibility. If you're young with a squeaky voice pings may be a way to reduce negative perception. If you play in a noisy environments that may break peoples eardrums or don't have a good mic because its expensive or you laptop gaming pings provide a good alternative too. Also pings are visual. If your teammate has no sound or cannot hear at least he can see. This is especially true because the metal reinforcing noise sometimes drowns out other people speaking. Accessibility makes for better coms.
---
rainbow6.com/topissues
---
what happens when you shoot them
---
Theres a balance between those who have acogs, all 3 amour ops have acogs except for Mira and Clash. Since they are slower and louder they need an advantage besides some extra armour. Plus theres only 1 op that has an acog on defense that's not 3 armour and that's Goyo who's acog is on a semi auto gun. Plus there are ops to deal with jager.
---
It's get a Vertical Grip, and Stock on the modkit though. :P Pair it with the Extended barrel, it becomes decent in mid-range engagements.
---
Not graphic settings, just happened randomly
---
Shit he beat my record..  Mine was 35223
---
Iirc that's how the developers wanted the game to be originally
---
Yeah, unless ur Skaiko then u need atleast  a 3 stack
---
Bro, i have like 160048 emails... Fuck obisoft
---
Must be a lighting glitch then?
---
Oh good. It was rlly bad last season
---
Not possible
---
Yeah without a team it's basically a coinflip as a solo player. Its very possible, it just takes a lot of grinding and putting your best effort in. Sometimes you get trolls, sometimes you get tryhards, sometimes you get people that should be high tier plat, its a giant coinflip as a solo player. You can only do so much alone.
---
Also there were times where you could put an acog on the SMG11, the glory days of Rainbow
---
Probably, no idea
---
Oh you're talking about BasicallyHomeless. His meme video where he tried to get banned.
---
Not sure I agree with you about the game being "horribly defender sided". The game is actually easier on attack if you are playing with a full squad, especially if you know how to attack the main objective rooms and get a plant off. The attackers only need to access and secure one objective room while the defenders need to deal with securing 2 rooms. And the first move is made by attackers which gives more control of the situation to them because they can decide how to engage and make it favorable for them. In theory, the attackers are supposed to win and the defenders need to hang on to steal at least one round. Attacking is harder when you are going solo commando and it can seem like you have no chance against all the gadgets but in a vaccuum, a well coordinated offense will always beat a comparably coordinated defense.
---
Trap ops aren't useless, they are godly if you manage to waste the attacker's time for long enough that they need to rush. If you let the attackers relax then they start being careful, making traps ineffective.
---
I have a lot of the chibis but thermite eludes me. One time I saw it " available " on the ubistore and by the time I checked out there was errors and sold out.  I could spend the money to just buy it but half the fun is getting the charm... just for that dumbass smile. 
---
One day.
---
iirc it doesnt, it's all over youtube
---
In other news i finally broke into gold. It's been evading me all season.
---
Or the lord . But jokes aside try smoke . Of you get ambushed , you can always smoke your way outta there .

Has every item to have ever existed in siege, even unreleased ones.
---
You meant dangerous. ^^for ^^both ^^sides.
---
Fair point, but I still think rooks gadget is better. They‚Äôre both top tier but rooks is just a bit above. Think of all the gunfights where your teammates escaped with like 10 health. Without rook armour they‚Äôd be dead, and that could cost the round.
---
Yet another reason why I can‚Äôt wait to get a pc
---
They'll wait to do it in a banwave
---

---
Cuz 3 speeds can flank easily
---
Makes sense
---
Same here, live a ways away from the nearest server
---
Don't believe this game currently allows for you to have different sensitivities for "Hip Fire", "ADS" and "Ballistic". (Using Battlefield terms, where that sort of feature is available.
---
Rip
---
They may have IP banned you so talk to support first, if they have IP banned you then you will be banned through your internet/WiFi rather than your PC/Console
---
People spam ping in siege just the same. While the devs should work something it with spamming pings, it‚Äôs not a reason I would give for them to not consider adding such a system into the game.
---
He's in the elder realms
---
why does the gun look suspicously real?
---
Why you always do control shots.
---
Now Jackal cav echo and blitz have to go rush to piece their gear together and run out to the battlefield they were by the pool dammit

Who‚Äôs to say the unranks in your squad aren‚Äôt plat or diamond? You sure showed us by showing that you run with unranked players.

How can u main clash . She gets banned in every ranked game and is pretty trash .

I've only been playing 6 months and still getting the hang of MnK yet every other game I get stomped by people with far more knowledge and skill than me. I love the game but it's demotivating.

yep, my teammates kept leaving and we ended up 3v5 on the last round and still won.

I haven't played apex in a looong time, I just remember there being an instant "enemy over there" button, so you're most likely right

My boy varsity.

Definitely, but I'm not saying don't have common sense. I'm saying that sort of suspicion should be followed up, but not immediately used as evidence. That was my whole point, and the reason the OP followed up and gave more information like I asked for.

Hello! :)

after you close it, and go back in the ini file, it actually says 0? like to make sure it's actually saving it and you restarted the game?

rivatuner could be capping it too, if you even have that program

Okay, I'm definitely going to try it and see how it looks

Seems legit

That's a m60 though.

Is Doc hard? Would it punish my team if I chose Doc and wasn‚Äôt great at him? 
---
Also: how hard is it to get enough renown to get to one of the more expensive operators?
---
The operator was also disabled sooner into the season than previously. Additionally, this is likely a much more complex coding issues than the previous reason the operator was disabled.
---
I'd say no to ela too unless they like being nerfed every 3 weeks
---
Yeah I tried that already

Still an lmg so idk
---
I have rivatunr capped to 240, and it was active in fortnite which I got 240fps in
---
How the fuck...
---
Yes ,but no her trap doesn't have the spring connected to the teath it's more of a hinge
---
Ubi would probably IP ban him. Which would be a bit harder to get the game back. But just calling to your provider and requesting an new IP, get a new copy of windows and a new UPlay account, and put 2 SV on a new account and then rebuy the game will be enough to hack again
---
The spawnpeeks are fine, I aways keep a drone near a spawn peek spot, but the rushings can be unexpected though.

My favorite game dead by daylight had one and I loved it for like the first week, then I felt like I was forced to play and it became less and less fun

Fuze is the best operator in HOSTAGE

I'm actually not that bad, but I just suck real bad at any map that isn't bank, chalet, consulate, house or plane

I thought they patched out fire damage against the hostage

Doc is great because he has a great gun plus plenty of armor to absorb bullets. AND you can heal your teammates. There is no punishment for picking doc really

I just found out what the problem was. For some stupid reason, I have two different gamesettings.ini folders, and the one I was changing the FPSlimit in was the wrong one. I found a second folder somewhere, changed the FPS limit to 240 in that folder, and voila.
---
Banana outfit XD
---
Ok I know it's a joke, but I kind of actually want that in the game after reading makes things actually intense.
---
how did he get nerfed?
---
when there's a will, there's a way. consoles are basically just smaller computers.
---
It's likely just easier on PC than console
---
This is why I always double tap.
---
might have the occasional ally pop him in the head (in revenge for a prior match) or jerk allies stealing his totally deserved kills

Sometimes though, that extra second is the difference between losing or planting.

You straight up ignored everything they said

A legend does.

Please don‚Äôt remind Ubisoft, they will be soon be known as the new EA. If they‚Äôre going to add a battle pass, they should at least make it free to play
---
I've never understood using the term sweaty to describe a player in a game/mode that is designed to be competitive
---
It's more the sales that sell R6 for like $5.
---
Buy game with throwaway cash and rampage through without a care
---
I know but I wanted to support the game and I liked the stuff I got from the pass, but it just turned stale
---
This, it's not necessary but it won't hurt to have it. 
---
People that complain about the grind to level it up end up looking like they don't understand that they can simply not buy or ignore it's existence completely.
---
I'll just keep playing the game as I always did and I'll get some free cosmetics or something every couple levels, why would I complain?!
---
*Spicy gu lesion noodles noises*
---
Dont forget the 6000 r6 credit "BLEND INTO EVERY FUCKING MAP" universal outfits too! 
---
&gt; Every micro transaction is cosmetic only. &lt; My ass!
---
The main issue is honestly the restructuring of the seasons. Switching from 3 seasons to 4 seasons a year, gives the devs less time to flesh out the seasonal activities, leading to things that feel like copies of each other. 
---
A good example is the Sundial, which feels like a smaller version of the Menagerie, but with a modified loot path, no longer requiring the rune crafting. 
---
And Crucible (PvP) feels forgotten, apart from the seasonal ritual/pinnacle weapons. 1 new map this season, being Rusted Lands, a map from D1. But with the possible return of Trials of Osiris/Nine, it may be enough to rejuvenate the Crucible experience.
---
With the return of Saint-14, it may also give us enough umph for the D2 storyline. Shadowkeep left many questions, and Garden of Salvation left only more questions. With Saint-14 and Osiris, two characters who know alot about the vex and their connection to the darkness, it may help lead the narrative in a clearer direction. 
---
Note: I should've posted this to r/DestinyTheGame . Whatever, I guess.

---
The saga started on PC tho...
---
I‚Äôm sad I missed the event. I really wanted to try it. I was homeless at the time
---
It's an epic store exlusive deal. They're losing money with these coupons. Sony and Microsoft have nothing to do with that.
---
Then you and me must browse a different main sub because I have seen this countless times even before Kanal went to live servers lmao
---
if you don't like it don't buy it.
---
You‚Äôre comment seemed a bit malicious, no point in even commenting negatively unless its constructive criticism. It‚Äôs not that serious, filter your comments in the future
---
Don‚Äôt remind them. I don‚Äôt have money for this. I barely have money for the next year pass
---
Please I beg no more Patrick I‚Äôve learnt my lesson after that entire Patrick phase the for honour sub reddit went through
---
I am disagreeing with this statement from Pengu
---
He made multiple points here so I‚Äôm going to go through them all one by one.
---
First he talks about every gun being one shot headshot and most guns being 800+ rpm. I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs claiming that Kali‚Äôs one shot ability is on par with other operators because of one-shot headshot. I disagree because 55% of the time you can‚Äôt get that headshot. You don‚Äôt always get a headshot. If you are playing Kali it is as if you are getting a headshot because the person is dead as long as you hit them in the chest, head or torso. 
---
Secondly he talks about the long range capabilities. I do agree that the talented fraggers can challenge and rarely win against a long-range Kali because of pure headshot aim and reaction time, but rarely. Fighting a 4x or a 12x with 1x or 2.5x is extremely difficult and you rarely win that fight. 
---
Then he talks about Kali‚Äôs entry capability, but I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs talking about her sniper. Kali‚Äôs entry capabilities are actually good considering the CZs fire rate and damage, and Kali is a 2/2.
---
Lastly, I agree with his last point. Kali‚Äôs gadget is useful and fun. But part of me feels it counters too much and offers too much as to what she brings.
---

Ubisoft teased that they‚Äôre making another rainbow six game, based off of Outbreak, called Rainbow Six Quarantine
---
Copper innit
---
by looking at your reddit username i can tell you're one of those people who just try at anything to get a reaction out of people
---
so im not gonna even dignify that statement with a response
---
Thank you for introducing me to this subreddit
---
Yeah
---
Can you link a source? If you got it, I'd like to read that
---
First try to play few open ESL cups, you rabked experience is not the same. And pro leage is 18+
---
Maybe that‚Äôs all the yelling on kanal I‚Äôm pretty sure if you shoot a shipping container there‚Äôs continuous yelling near it so that‚Äôs a possibility I guess?
---
Ah
---
Maestro however you spell it echo wami
---
Plz nerf
---
I can imagine watching the kill cam like wtf.
---
I mean it would hurt to have it. Because it‚Äôs another source they focus on placing cosmetics into and not letting you buy said cosmetics directly. The goal is to get people to spend money to buy tiers for the good cosmetics. Which means the cash shop, a more player friendly method, will get less content. Look at their shift from paid direct costume packs two Halloween‚Äôs ago to forcing you to buy cash only loot boxes. Ubisoft is insanely scummy.
---
Also the pass isn‚Äôt free. You‚Äôre not getting shit without paying for it.
---
Good op, bless that absolutely disgusting wall bang

Hello Username-Taken01, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eh3gyd/friendly_fire/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
Who the hell wants more monetization in their games, wtf?
---
Sledge is like the most realistic OP in the game. Bar maybe Glaz at launch.
---
(Not directed at anyone in a provacatory way) Unless I missed something at the panel, there won't be any rewards directly tied to gameplay (operators &amp; stuff), so it's all cosmetics and lore... It's not forcing you to grind or pay for a competitive advantage, so whats the reason for everyone to be apposed to it? Odds are that it will at minimum last the entire length of the season, that's 3 months, or roughly 90 days for you to finish a pass that'll probably have maybe 100-120 levels, and that's if you don't fork out your money to make it easy. Based on the trial they had it'd probably only take a couple matches depending on performance per level, which you could easily accomplish in an evening. If you happen to play more on weekends you could make quick progress. 
---
If you play regularly, then you should have an easy time finishing most of it within a season. And if you can't/don't want to play regularly, then why would you bother worrying yourself so much about a battle pass? Battle passes are designed to reward the players who play the most, after all.
---
Personally, I play often anyway, it's just more content for me, and quite frankly I prefer this to alpha packs in many respects. Less randomness, and theoretically, more guaranteed high quality items, it feels like a rewarding experience to me.
---
I understand the whole monetization thing, but they have yet to reveal prices and how it works with the year pass/ if we will still have a year pass. Tbh I doubt it will be anything outrageous, I think they may have learned a lesson from ghost recon breakpoint. And at the end of the day, there will still be the free track that you can grind as long as you like.
---
Coreross published a good video on the battle pass today, which I encourage everyone to take a look at. 
---
That's all folks.
---
Agreed mr/ms [REDACTED]
---
It doesn't change the game at all though
---
We don‚Äôt even know if there will be a free part.
---
More than likely stick drift. Try slowly rotating the sticks clockwise then counterclockwise for 15 seconds each. This should put them back into place. If that doesn‚Äôt work then more than likely you‚Äôre controller is broken. Does this happen on multiple controllers or just one specific one?
---
Are you playing in full nokk cosplay since you started...     Unless..?
---
That or if your cursor (etc) is directly on an enemy and you press it it pings the enemy
---
Not talking about the game. If there was a battle pass then there would be so many people who would be like ‚Äúyou dont have this skin oh you suck‚Äù or something along the lines. Exactly like the yt vids of the people trash talking.
---
The statement I was using from Pengu was about one shot headshots, not Kali. Not really counterproductive. Just because I agree with one opinion doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt disagree with a different one.
---
At my elo, people are ADSing most of the time so if you get caught un-ADSed it‚Äôs probably your fault and not the gun‚Äôs. And no, people still get plenty of body shot kills even in the highest ranks and pro play.
---
Keep in mind I am commenting on Pengu‚Äôs long range point on this. If a Kali is in a long range engagement then her flanks should already be covered with proper coordination. And again I‚Äôm talking about Pengu‚Äôs comments so we are assuming there is a long range engagement going on, defender peeking.
---
Yes the CZ has extremely big iron sights but if you practice with it you can learn them. It‚Äôll take a while but it is doable, and extremely powerful if you learn it.
---
Yes I know Aceez isn‚Äôt the best fragger around haha it‚Äôs just hes a really good CZ player so I was using him as a comparable.
---
I obviously don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a full fledged EMP. Thatcher is so viable because of his anti tricking and gadget destruction. But I feel as if she can be used to great effect when the objective doesn‚Äôt necessarily need a thatcher. I feel on these objectives she is interchangeable with thatcher because she can disable both ‚Äúhard‚Äù gadgets such as shields or Maestros and your typical bandit kaid or mute. 
---
Your last couple points I disagree with though. I don‚Äôt feel like her kit has too many counters. I also feel like for CQB engagements you should never use the sniper because of the clunkiness and one-bullet fire rate. Use the CZ in this case. And if you are playing from a far, I agree. Long range engagements are rare and help the defence often. But when the times when there is one Kali should always win (garage-bank, long-consulate).

Really I see what you mean, it is a negative term, but think of it in the literal sense that you trying to win instead of being a friendly, you aren't being a useless teammate so, let them insult you by calling you a tryhard, they are just mad your demolishing then

When the Devs asked us if we'd be ok with shooting dogs, they were really teying to see if we would shoot monkeys so they could put a poopy monkey op in, they've planned the og ops so well.

Don't worry man, I said the same thing and got -600 downvotes lmao. No one has to buy it, just soy boy siege players complaining cause that's all they know what to do

Yeah, True.. But i have the feeling that in gold the matchmaking better is. More matches that are in over time, better matchmaking maybe? If i play in silver, the matches are not that good balanced ( 0-4 loses etc..) sorry for the bad English! :)

Actually MANY members of the community showed how OP she is when she was first announced (it‚Äôs 4:30 am where I am so I‚Äôm a little tired to go back and find every person). 
---
You didn‚Äôt list any of the reason why it‚Äôs actually good. The CZ is a 1000 fire rage gun with 35 damage (I think). I has a low amount of recoil and is great in the right hands.
---
It‚Äôs just how reddit works. Response to response. Each one proving the one before it wrong.
---
Neither of the hot breach podcast or siegegg show these weapon stats.
---
Actually yea, if you asked any pro or any decent player they would say thatcher is really powerful. Not OP, just powerful.

Yea. Long range support sniper that one shots with really good SMG and strong gadget.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter how much ammo you are left with as you leave the round as long as you have enough to get all 5 in there round :/

Idk why it says that, as long as you bought Rainbow Six: Siege. You should be fine.
---
You poor soul
---
Was it I must be thinking about the old kanal
---
You got me there
---
Not unless you've never played the map before.
---
Otherwise you applied knowledge of the map versus the likelihood of a defender taking that angle and you made an educated guess.
---
That's not luck, that's applied skill.

**FRIENDLY LAST OPERATOR STANDING**

It's only slightly above average in terms of DPS and its TTK is as average as average can get. Add in the reduced mag size and compare it to the other 20 round AR, the Type-89, and you can see that it really isn't that good. DPS isn't the only factor.

sticking out only really makes a difference in lower ranks, in higher levels it doesn‚Äôt matter if you stick out or not the gun fight will only last a second

But no

Wonder what flavor it is...

You're doing it right

That is not a solution. But there should be a much bigger punishment for those who teamkill

whats the point in playing newcomer if hes switching to pc (im assuming)
---
no
---
I guess the newcomer queue was kinda a mistake then. While I can see it's benefits, they should've started with those 10 maps right from the start. The main issue of me switching to quick matches is lack of map knowledge and just generally being useless to the team since I don't know what leads where ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
OOF.

Not a fan of this logo specifically

Yes
---
Well, using M&amp;K on console is never as responsive as on a PC. 
---
In my opinion, it‚Äôs just another waste of money that could get you an SSD or a nicer CPU cooler when you go to build your machinex
---
Is it like forever gone? :c
---
It‚Äôs the same exact thing. Neither mode counts towards anything so you just learn more in Quick Play. Newcomer is like training wheels, at some point you have to take them off and man up to the occasion. Go out there and learn. You don‚Äôt need to spend 100 levels on 3 maps let alone 50 is a stretch.

In T Hunt it‚Äôs fine but really annoying in casual.

Just go below for a free c4 kill. Leave the objective after prep phase ends so they don't know where you are. The ump is bad for people without great aim, and even then it has a slow ttk, I'd recommend the shotty and nitro. Don't bother with sights on a shotty, just obstructs your view. When you use your c4, just be sure they are not running.
---
Death by excitement
---
You're not missing anything, trust me.
---
Ranks don't even matter anymore, not sure that they ever have. No matter your rank you'll always play against people you have no business playing against - quickplay or ranked. I'd pay full-price for this game once more if it meant I would *always* be matched with players of similar skill and experience.
---
I'm weu, kinda in the same boat. I play na a fair bit with friends tho and the ping isn't too bad tbh, I get like 80 on their servers

I bet this gets more and more likely every season. As more maps and ops are put in the game the more realistic it‚Äôll become for this game mode to be desired.

Yes it should be like in Overwatch, where the game ends when somone leaves in the first minute...

Probably at the end of the season

I completely understand that, I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm being downvoted for asking a question. I‚Äôm wondering why it will decrease the quality of the game for someone who logs on, plays ranked a few times a day, and never even touches the shop, which is probably 90% of the playerbase, feel free to replace ranked with casual or custom games or whatever you prefer. I don‚Äôt see how it makes my experience worse.

I use p9 because easier to use, if you can aim well, Revolver tho

I use the p10 but the magnum ain't bad it's just i prefer more bullets over more damage

They mentioned this idea before i think and they said the game engine wouldn't handle the 2 different perspectives playing at once so oof but its a cool idea

Any update to Clash's status would be tremendous. Even if you can just give a rough range for when we can expect her back.
---

If you can hit your shots the revolver is great

Would be op and also impossible on a technical side.

It's a reference to the meet the sniper Video.
---
Don't question it. It's a sign from lord tachanka
---
In my opinion the holo is as thicc or even thiccer than red dot when you aim down sights
---
I might be wrong, but I think you do a long animation, like placing a fuze cluster charge as the final round ended and you get the black screen and transition to the mvp screen and you should be able to hit the fire button to shoot and i'm pretty sure this is how you do it, but i might be wrong since i never tried it
---
Yeah. I main echo, and the game gives me fucking Doc

What's your CPU? A quad core cpu really struggles to play siege without hitting 100%, your "fix" is to cap fps and move the bottleneck to the gpu, gotta increase the graphics pal, if you increase them, you'll stress the GPU more, giving your CPU a slight headroom.
---
Of course the real fix is moving to a cpu like 8700k,9900k, Ryzen 5 3600 or Ryzen 7 3700x and forgot about your CPU being the bottleneck again.

my cpu is an i5 8400. the weird thing is that I'vebeen playing siege for a over a year and this has never happened before. I come back to the new season after a month or 2 of absence and all of a sudden this. aslo how do i cap fps? because even with vsync on a 60 Hz monitor i have jumps to 90 fps on the benchmark

The bottom of his mag is also missing, and his bullets...

His time was up I guess

If you aren‚Äôt very accurate you are not going to want to use the revolver

This is not yours. Stop karma farming kiddo.

(Stabbing noises)

No. Unranked doesn‚Äôt need you to have a rank. It lets you practice and get used to gameplay without risk of deranking
---
Ok ill try when i get home ill let you know if it worked
---
Thanks!
---
Was a toppic at release. Someone posted fixed version

Lmao, I got alibi
---
The problem is I did ONE unranked today, and during this unranked game, two guys left so we were 3v4 and we got destroyed but we didn't quit at all till the lose.
---
To add to my point if mute has 12 walls he can antibreach that would mean that all reinforced walls would be in unbreachable s√≥ said thermite gadget would be useless unless used on a soft wall which defeats the purpose of an exothermic charge
---
I understand that lol. I'm asking if it's mmr based or not. Or if I need to get a new mmr before it will work properly. I'm not playing with people on my level is what I'm saying.

This is actually a good point
---
Actually, someone did a test on this. If you put them near a hostage, and the hostage gets killed by a grenade you trapped, then yes, he is your kill, not the attacker. But if you grab the hostage, and then move him a bit, then kill them with a nade, then it is the attackers. This also applies to Goyo's traps, Kapkan's traps, etc.
---
Mute jammers are only good at countering drones and jamming walls away from site to force the attacker to use utility to clear out roamers playing off-site.
---
Jamming walls on site is pointless because any coordinated team can easily breach. You would need Bandit and Kaid to truly have a chance at denying a breach by virtue of Bandit tricking and Kaid tricking.
---
how? i thought termite only had 2
---
I, as an occasional warden player, dislike this. That is all

The ones you have are not released by Ubisoft and not even licensed Products.

They have different Poses a lower Quality und no Chibi Charm Code included.

The Originals are still avaible in the Official UbiStore and at Conventions for the Standard Price.

It was actually pretty funny walking around in my house and hearing this music without headphones on I was like wtf is going on
---
I'd love to do this if my team didn't always shoot my hacked twitch drone. :(
---
Well, while that's good to know and everything, Ubisoft doesn't like to have these sorts of reports on the Reddit: It's considered "Witch hunting". Additionally, this isn't the first post of these. There has been several with this player for awhile now.
---
I like where this is going
---
And you can do the same thing with bandit batteries with slightly more cushion, making it easier to do, so why would you pick the op that makes it harder..
---
I think you need to learn about Bandit tricking and Kaid tricking. You don't seem to fully understand what that is at least based on your reply.
---
With the trigger discipline, too ! Nice work
---
If you're on Xbox, I might be able to help
---
For sure!
---
1. Map knowledge is the hardest part of the game to pickup and will take time. Be patient.
---
2. If you start by doing the "Situations" you'll get a fair amount of renown (in game currency) that you can put towards buying the cheapo operators.
---
3. Sightlines are key. A lot of this game is looking through angles and making yourself as small as possible then shooting at head level when you see movement. Headshots are instant kills.
---
4. Generally, it's better not to have a laser sight on your guns. In a game about positioning it's not great to give free info to your enemies about where you are.
---
5. Newcomer queue is full of smurfs. Casual is possibly a better place to learn the game.
---
6. When you're defending don't have everybody wait on site. It helps to have people roaming or off site nearby. Also when playing bomb, there are 2 objectives. You usually dont put up reinforced walls between those objectives.
---
7. If you can attack someone vertically by blowing a floor up over or under them, try it. R6 is a demolition game that happens to have some gunplay in it.
---
8. Don't peak the same angle twice. Come in at a diff height (crouching, standing) or go elsewhere. It's REALLY easy to pick someone off who keeps peeking.
---
9. If you're on attack, kill the cameras on the map. People just don't do this all the time and it helps the defenders a lot.
---
10. Play with buds. This game is SUPER diff (and better) with friends.
---
I'd also plug Varsitygaming as a YouTube channel with great resources. Sub to r/siegeacademy too. There's a dude named Kaosx or something like that who also makes great learning videos.
---
Above all take your time. It's a big game to learn but it's SUPER fun and rewarding. I've pretty much dropped overwatch for it despite being good at OW and meh at r6.
---
Happy sieging!
---
It‚Äôs odd that he‚Äôs so high of rank and only level 89, definitely a cheater.

There is no best attacker, your going to get unique answers 50-80% of the time, and lesion is an anchor.

Oh no I do what am I saying that makes you say that

Flashes on buck is worse than this kapkan's fun meter.

Pm me if you want a group to play with. We always look for people.
---
Yeah. I main Echo, but that's never happened to me
---
Because Bandit can be countered by Capitao firebolts, Zofia concussion nades. Not to mention, needing to stay near the wall makes him susceptible to flashes, grenades and so on which if not kill you, will deafen you making it so you can't hear the breach placement.
---
That is when Kaid is useful since he can deploy his gadget from range. Not to mention, he counters Maverick + Thermite combo since it's harder for Maverick to make a hole to shoot the electroclaw than it is a Bandit battery.
---
I had the sudden urge to reinforce my apartment haha

So you have a problem with them smack talking you (PC chat?) or tea bagging after they win? Otherwise I don‚Äôt see how them winning would be toxic. Kinda sounding like you got frustrated for going against better players and decided to label them toxic to make yourself feel better.
---
Wait WHAT

How far away from the wall are you standing that you're immune from that stuff yet can hear thermite placing his charge well enough that you can deploy the claw in under a second?

---
Question, did Marley get this for free or is he gonna open it in about 4.5 mil alpha packs?
---
Very true. The success of this strategy is contingent upon the enemy team completely abandoning trophy and having no intel, which is unlikely to happen. Even if the enemy players were to fall back and out of trophy, there are plenty of angles that can be held from kitchen that look into trophy. If buck loses the fight from above or gets killed in garage, then things will become increasingly difficult for the attackers. Blackbeard can get vaulted out on from balcony, or could just lose the gunfight. Moreover, if Amaru dies then you have to rethink your whole plan. Despite these flaws, I still really enjoy the strat. I enjoy it because it's pretty fun to catch people off guard. It also makes for a fun cinematic.

his loadout is great for the most part, mainly his great primary and his secondaries can be busted if you can control them. his gadget is situational but useful in competitive scenes where everyone is droning everything

Wow. That's a really nice strawman you've built. I didn't say toxicity doesn't exist. I said that it was **MY** experience that it was less so on PC. I know that it might be hard for your pissant brain to comprehend but work with me here. Furthermore, your comment about rampant cheating is laughable given the MnK problem on console. I'm not  PC elitist. Console is where the bulk of the community is. Look it up. Of course, there is going to be ample chance for toxicity there. There are more players. Unless you want to get into per capita numbers, feel free I guess? 
---
I can see why you get team killed a lot. I appreciate your impassioned response but stop building strawmen and saying dumb shit. Thanks.

His Gadget could be reworked to be a bit better, or an alternative design. It's mainly his weapons, and being a 3Speed. His Shotgun is pretty much a 1-shot meme-cannon, who a Streamer convinced his community to mass-feedback ubisoft to give it an ACOG.

Amaru is a GOOD operator
---
In my experience in playing Vigil, I've found that he's great for flanking and making rotations without giving intelligence. If you're an attacker that's trying to get a read on where the roamers are positioned, Vigil often denies you the opportunity. He also has a decent gun, and impacts for making rotation holes.
---
Vigil is an Intel denying operator. He essentially makes you have to drone everything twice. That‚Äôs using the words of Parker one of the pro league casters. The higher up the skill ladder you go the more effective he becomes. Droning becomes better at the higher levels of play and a vigil only hinders this.
---
No, he always had 2.
---
It would be abused by 5 stacks
---

Eh, I think you're making a chicken out of a feather.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôre welcome for this useless comment lmao. Hopefully you find what you want tho

No, drone hide and seek. 5 normal drones that are extra fast and can jump extra high (but not as often maybe) against 5 twitch drones with unlimited ammo. In a small but complicated map
---
You literally dont need your eyes to navigate the fucking map appearently
---
Yeah but i just think maybe for only a minute when somebody leaves you can leave without a penalty then after that minute its like normal. Just a thought i had while playing
---
this game is toxic and ubisoft still lets they have a free kill, I want insta ban, or kick.
---
Well, to steal something from another said another should own this first.
---
These look great. Mozzie if you want to try it
---
Dont reinforce between sites and dont tk
---
Yeah, pretty true. But I always find it really easy when the outline shows exactly where not to shoot your teammate. I usually play lower ranks (because I suck) or casual, sorry, *quick match* with friends who also suck.
---
But you can‚Äôt play her most of the time
---
I heard a window break above me and I have crippling spawnpeekfobia so I had the nastiest flick of my career and headshot my teammate about 4 times. I got kicked for it üò•
---
what?
---
No theres like a 2 second delay when you pull out the thing and blow it up and in that time they ran towards it. Also how was a supposed to know they were going to run straight for the c4 that i threw. And vigil paused at the wall and right before i was kicked he moved to the right so he wasnt reinforcing.

Your "suggestion" won't work in any way shape or form. They can't manually review each kick. And without manual review it wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. And you are the one calling yourself a "young adult" as a 12 year old kid.

i have lost faith in the iq of the siege community

---
is it bad i barely have over 100hours and i have 2 black ices
---
Exactly. They kick you or even kill you and once you report them, nobody votes to kick them out, but if you kill them (not saying you are supposed to), someone votes you out and your out of the game immediately.
---
Try to get in the habit of having your cross hair in the right spot at all times, so if an enemy rushes around the corner you're already set up for a good shot. Too often do I see people walking through a map and their cross hair is aimed at knee level.
---
Okay then. No comment.
---
She's just vibeing
---
I dont really have any mains. I have characters I'm better with than other ops but no mains. I made the decision a while back that if I wanna get better at the game I need to be super flexible in my op choices.

This really upsets me when it happens. Lime if I‚Äôm playing with randoms I can forgive it.

I‚Äôm in an intense situation, I‚Äôm alert af and on edge, I‚Äôm not going to second guess every character model I see for you. PLEASE call your rotations.
