Yeah it was pretty funny me and my buddies had a laugh about it.
---
---
---
I can't even see them until they're already dead. Nice shot!
---
ash is overrated
---

---
she is such a garbage op if your not rushing
---
Your scaring people
---
Because sometimes being silent when roamers are around is the better option.
---
I always aim at the front for this very reason. I don't see this as being toxic. Nice shot though!
---
Boosting???
---
'member when IQ had frag grenades? i member.
---
Noice.
---
Doing this in 0-3? Such an idot
---
Congrats, what's the last trophy you had to get?
---
tf
---
What?
---
One day my team got aced by this so I've been paranoid ever since lol. Thanks
---
It's a work in progress so I didn't at first think about more guns, but, I'll have an updated version out soon.
---
You and I have very different play styles and it‚Äôs clear they wouldn‚Äôt mesh lol. I like the guys idea for this, it‚Äôs different. I prefer silent entry‚Äôs when possible. Or being as far away as possible when I enter the building.
---
Meat wall (blow a guy up with breach charge)
---
I kind of feel bad for them xD
---
How great was this event though.
---
Now I have a reason to use N√∏kk
---
[https://imgur.com/XP8CVbV](https://imgur.com/XP8CVbV) I did it for you comrade
---
Amazon next day shipping it
---
Bucket for you bucket for me buckets for all
---
That‚Äôs the idea. But ubi don‚Äôt like my ideas.
---
That is the same as my connection and the game runs fine. Hell, I used to play on a mobile hotspot, and now having 10 down 1up DSL the game runs much better.
---
Leaked elite rook skin
---
I‚Äôve just posted an updated one if you‚Äôre interested.
---
I was in a game and someone put a Mira in between 2 reinforced walls. I posted it here if you wanna see it.
---
Gadgets as well. Does this op have any breach? Does this op ge grenades? Does this op sneaky sneaky thru smoke? How does the support aspect of this op work. How does he play without his special. Think of someone like rook. He drops his special first thing and then the entire rest of his game play is a shooter. How does snake work without the bow?
---
My hero
---
The bow would definitely take skill to pull off but I feel like 4 arrows is to op. Probably just make it 3 and add a charge timer to it and it'll be fine.
---
member my callout
---
nothing wrong with not sprinting around as ashe when it's 1v5
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/CkBBaok](https://imgur.com/gallery/CkBBaok) I did it for you comrade
---
They need to give nokk an actual attacking gun. And if they feel like reusing they might as well use one that sees no attention
---
I bet you‚Äôre a gold 2 talking shit about people‚Äôs ranks üò≠üòÇget a life virgin
---
I feel the trap would work best as a loud sound that doesnt distort but does deafen and alert defenders. Also deployment would be better as something similar to mozzies or nomads devices where its a free place device.
---
"The Bad one" is no longer available. Though with the Edition changes that happened in February the base game ops are no longer free and must be unlocked with Renown, But they are super cheap compared tot he DLC ops.
---
It's cool to see more of your stuff on here man! I subbed a couple hours ago. You've definitely got potential. Your editing is on point, and you and your friends are pretty funny. Keep it up!
---
Alt enter twice maybe
---
You can crouch in CoD?
---
That‚Äôs why i chose the C8 SFW. It‚Äôs also a weapon used by the J√¶gerkorpset in real life.
---
Why are you using a holo on G36?
---
nah we dont do that around here
---
the fuck

is this r/softwaregore

That‚Äôs some cool background lore for the world that Ubisoft created.
---
 T H I C C B O I
---
yeah, it was found on [youtube.com/jollypiratedonut](https://youtube.com/jollypiratedonut). what a hack
---
Because that‚Äôs what I like to personally play with and I do good with it.....that‚Äôs the reason anybody should use any gun and put any attachment on it.
---
No it‚Äôs me photoshopping my ideal n√∏kk loadout.
---
This might possibly be the gayest thing I have ever seen.
---
The cannonball is solid. If it were alot of mini cannonballs it would have a chance to go around and destroy whatevers behind it. It's almost like that's what's in a shotgun shell... anyways, it's not hitboxes. Its rng.
---
Looks the same to me üòÇ
---
See that thing turn the corner on me I‚Äôll I‚Äôll the trigger on myself thank you I ain‚Äôt boutta get eaten by that thing
---
How?
---
They changed some of the trophies recently.
---
If you play like a an hour or two since the start of the game level 335 isnt that high. 
---
i started off at velvet shell and my accounts on 296.
---
If you check my 1st version of my operator, the images I used were rendered images in game, but I flipped the tone curves to make them white. Is there a way I could find just normal white pictures of the guns/utilities/ect.
---
I live in Portugal where 300$ can only buy you a 4GB Ram PC üòÇ. There's no Dell in Portugal.

Thank you, had no idea this existed.

Alternate title: Man begins assaulting midgets until shot
---
Many variants of the Mp5 were produced. This page, from the H and K official website, shows that its probably an mp5a3. ( https://hk-usa.com/hk-models/mp5a3-2/) The gun can also be ordered as an MLI (mid life improvement) model, which adds the rails for grips, lasers, scopes etc.
---
Hope that cleared up any misunderstanding
---
no if the person has no operators then the game auto picks recruit
---
The effect would last 5 seconds and end at the same time the operator stops taking damage.
---
i support that
---
Details. Like when a touch of color is out of place. Or a shape doesn‚Äôt match with its surroundings.
---
Can't control discord with enemy team communication stop, would be too overpowered allowing hard breach no matter what

Fair enough but the idea just popped into my head.

If all you keyboard warriors dislike Boogie so much, then why do you watch every stream, video, tweet and subreddit? Are your lives so pathetic and empty that you spend every waking hour finding something to hate on? Seriously, get a fucking life you lazy cunts. Think of the actual good you could do in the world if you put a 10th of the hate you spread into some positivity. You people are idiots. You spend too much time worrying about someone else's life, actions, thoughts, tweets that you have forgotten about your own pathetic life. None of you are perfect, therefore you have no right to judge anyone else. I am sure each and every one of you have plenty of faults, that if made public, you would be embarrassed and do what you could to disappear. Truth or lies, Boogie keeps streaming and creating content. Yes, Boogie has some issues, yes, Boogie sticks his foot in his mouth frequently, but those of you that spend every minute of your lives picking out everything he says or does is just pathetic. Live your own fucking lives and if you don't like Boogie, then fuck off. Y'all are as pathetic as Fox News. Grow up children.
---
I‚Äôm sorry... did you say... *Ash* and *Headshot* in the same sentence

&gt;I trust the ceramic trauma plate I'm wearing will stop a .357 magnum round travelling 490m/s

Ye your right, searches the person playing recruit and he only plays recruit

This dude is amazing

Looks great! How long did this take you?

Right back at you backaroo

You play on console or PC? Haha
---
Aye bro u good ?

xbox
---
I‚Äôve never been a fan of Zofia and her ability. I‚Äôve never been able to quite understand her attach rhythm but you seem quite good with her! Any pointers to play her better?
---
Nice!
---
I guess
---
cool idea, but way op lol

Anyone have the link to the Rook video?

Thanks bro

That‚Äôs one dead attacker right there.

&gt;	using a controller for shooters feels so wrong once you get used to PC. 
---
I dunno, I kinda miss it. I've been playing on pc from 2010 but I remember playing so much halo and BFBC2 on xbox and would like to play again with a controller. Obviously not gonna work on pc with other ppl using M&amp;Kb
---
Kapp
---
Holy shit
---
Because the smurfs are in newcomer therefore not in casual
---
Then they would named it the variant either they are being very unspecific or they just didn‚Äôt bother to do any research into the weapon itself
---
I only main the Memes.
---
Seriously though, I don't really "main" any operator. I just play whoever I feel like and whoever I think will go good with the operators my team chooses.
---
Feels like an OP capitao buff
---
Lv134 and 0 my friend is lv73 and has 5 that fucking shit.
---
You are literally just trying to flex. What did you expect out of this?
---
My cousin died years ago in his sleep. It was cited simply as cardiac arrest. No foul play or drugs in his system.
---
It can happen, and even though all deaths are sad, it was rough because he was about 25 and his mom found him in the morning. No one to blame, no one at fault, just is.
---

---
Recruit  too op
---
Low key was hoping you would get shot in the balls.
---
My friend got black ice for ash‚Äôs r4c before level 10. I don‚Äôt play her but I know a lot of people do and would love to have that.
---
Like it
---
Why did this get deleted
---
May your feet stay flat and kvass stay strong. Squat on komrade, squat on.
---
Pretty much
---
By any chance, did you tk that Ash?
---
i should be using capitao more
---
Joycon boyz wya.

Recently I got a three man with fuse on hostage situation.

Damn....good luck with that man.

What all operators can use this?

Please, the jumpscares are scary enough already. Hahaha

RIP Etika.

How often would you get a chance to shoot Somone with a bow and not be able to.just shoot them with your rifle anyways.

I bet they‚Äôre rewarding them as I type this out.

thanks

That one moment you are about to clutch but u take a 9mm to the face by someone in the other objective.
---
It was on Xbox
---
A soul for a soul
---
Racial appropriation
---
It would be cool if he had a megnetic aura that pulled all metal close to him within a radius, which would disarm enemies (at extremely close range), mute jammers would be temporarily disabled, kapkan traps would stop working, if pulse's cardiac sensor is out it would take it from him etc.
---
The game has less rng than a real shotgun shell. And yes 100% of the time there is a pellet that is shot directly down the tip of the recticle (you can test it yourself)
---
It was only 2-2, if this was ranked how did it end before he was banned? It‚Äôs first to 4...
---
That's why I always peek while prone
---
Can we get some JoJokes in here!?
---
And doctors tell me not to worry about a heart attack at my age, What they don't tell you is a heart attack can happen at a young age.
---
This is what Rook Elite should have been.

You cant just say dont quote me on this and then say they are pretty sure about something.

Dont quote me on this but im pretty sure the next update will add minecraft crossplay to r6s.

My life peaked long ago

---
N√∏kk is fun, but if ur looking for a really good op for ranked and someone with good guns and abilities get zofia or ying for defence I‚Äôd say get vigil first his gun is cracked
---
You can't just complain about this like the only person under it's effect is you. Everyone is under the same circumstance, so it's fair.
---
You can it's the same as saying I think they are closing siege servers when contagion comes out. It is literaly the same thing synonymous statements look it up champ
---
worth it.

finally a clip that isnt a console player in casual
---
My crew is big

It was way more simple back then
---
A real mp5
---
this is hilarious.
---
Can we admire the recoil control to do that
---
Untrue. My friend always complains even when it‚Äôs legit. He always finds a way
---
And we lost... there goes my rank
---
It‚Äôs a different version Han the original mp5 I think it‚Äôs an mp5a2

holy wow your aim is ... something else

This was posted on this sub pretty recently
---
Wha-
---
This seems like a cool idea! How would Twitch's shock drone affect this device?
---
Pretty sure yeah. Everyone is poop on console. Lol
---
I‚Äôm sure they have .
---
Just play with a team :)
---
I only have one other friend that plays rainbow
---
I would suggest Mozzie out of all of them. He can be played in a variety of different ways; Drone Deterrence, roaming, or anchoring: 
---
1.) For drone deterrence you could literally just put your pests down and stop drones from entering the roam and then place the drones in each bomb sites as cameras to use for callouts
---
2.) for roaming you could use extra drones as cams and use a drone to drone out around where you are roaming and around the room to get the location of the attacker‚Äôs and either call it out or flank them 
---
3.) for anchoring, I would suggest not placing your pests down immediately and destroying drones in the prep phase, THEN placing the pests in order to stop intel gathering during the round by the enemy team. This way you get extra cameras mid round and also stop them from droning out the objective. 
---
Good luck friend!
---
Nice
---
Sometimes it feels like they saw me for way longer than I saw them.  I‚Äôll peek a corner and get instantly domed, thinking ‚Äúholy shit this dude is a god‚Äù then on the kill cam the other guy lumbers his way in to my head to get me.
---
I can never quite wrap my head around it.
---
This is a wonderful idea. Great work :D
---
You monster üòÆ. Atleast you didn't break it.
---
I was in a 5 stack,all ranked gold and got our assets kicked in three straight games. Not competitive, just wiped up. Not anywhere near ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù. I‚Äôm turning off Ranked. I play this game for enjoyment, not for making other people feel good about themselves.
---
Its pronounce 
---
ZA WARUDO 
---
Excuse you
---
Looks good! How long did this take you?
---
Lmao assets. But like fr you have never smacked a team 4-0 fr? If it was always like how youre describing you would have 0mmr
---
I thought he was rappelling upside down-
---
To be continued: Buck shoots C4 with skeleton key and clutches...
---
Don't mean to hate, but you started Burnt Horizon. Played 108 rounds of ranked. And got 2 kills, 0.50 k/d.
---
Than in Phantom sight you've suddenly played 112 rounds and have 738 kills and 491 deaths with a k/d of 1.50?????
---
No hate to you maybe you're just better than me but that's kinda sus for console
---
If it's deactivated, it would simply just keep it from activating for around 5ish seconds. If it's open, it would destroy it
---
A one shot body is a pretty bad idea tbh.
---
I said it once and I'll continue to say it. Increasing the RNG doesn't solve the problem of it being pure luck.
---
My suggestion. Shields get their old precision back but you can't headshot from the hip. So there still is RNG but no one hits. To do headshots you the need to aim.
---
Ca-Ve-era 
---
Kaid is better for support for hatches (chalet, clubhouse, bank, ect)
---
Nomad is better for maps you know people are going to run-out like skyscraper. 
---
At the end of the day I think the more ‚Äúuseful‚Äù op is kaid
---
Looks kinda like [REDACTED] if u ask me
---
My best is 4 seconds
---
S s deez nutz

‚ÄúHow was that not a headshot‚Äù

Thank you so much. I'm new to the game and was  deciding on who to get

Every time I get wallbanged pretty much

I recently got this problem on R6 where every time I go to my display settings it freezes. I have searched or people with the same problems and none have helped, the freezing is only in the settings menu on the display tab and doesn't matter if I am in game or not.

Obvious troll is obvious

Or a cheater on the other team
---
Thank you for reminding me how much I miss this gamemode ;(
---
u/zumwaltion Here's your operator. Hope you like it.
---
Those butterflies sound incredibly op.
---
The gun is the same besides looks attachments and damge
---
That don't seem like just a little prick.
---
OMG THANK YOU THIS IS AMAZING!?
---
I couldve added five emp packs like twitches shock drone but that would've been to op
---
either a cheater on your team or you beat a cheater. it happens. but in the end that cheater got banned.
---
You are extremely welcome my dude ill be making your other operator for you :)
---
For anyone who want's me to make any operator ideas for them dm ill see what i can do.
---
Too slow? Play some Call of Duty. Reloads there takes forever.
---
Recruit difficulty is for gods
---
Mr. Homless where u at?
---
{ - }7
---
Man you are a FREAKING CHAMPION!
---
Right, Lemme tweet him this.
---
One more thing for the bow is to give him "bad weapons". I mean the primaries since his gadget seems powerful. Look at capitao for example. He doesn't have great guns but great gadgets. I don't know how good the lion gun is but maybe a gun that sucks would be good for him. The arrows could also be toned down a little. Maybe addin bleed out if you remove the arrow. And if you don't then you make noise and cant move as well. A catch 22 if you will. The poison seems a bit overtuned since bodyshots give guaranteed kills. Make the arrow like snake teeth so you can't yank em out with out massive damage instead of poison.
---
A lot more balanced than most concept operators I've seen, though giving them Mutes SMG as a secondary seems a bit much
---
Thank you Thank you!
---
Don't forget going prone next to windows
---
#reddootgang
---
Well I read up on the MP5K and the description oh Heckler and Koch's website says that its meant to be a concealed weapon much like a pistol so I think it fits.
---
Thank you for being the only one of the people who downvoted me into oblivion that actually bothered to have a conversation about what's being discussed. Apparently in this sub you're not allowed to have a discussion about a post instead of going full hive mind.
---
Also, Downvote Button ‚â† Disagree Button
---
We both got on last night to give it a go, turns out since we both did play share (for R6 while his game was downloading), it creates an extra extra copy of R6 on the PS4 menu, after deleting that extra copy, invites worked like a charm
---
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up, total shock fills your body
---
Fuck it I‚Äôm giving you gold I can‚Äôt stop admiring this work that‚Äôs really good
---
Lmao I didn't even realise that
---
Nah Minecraft.
---
And Vigil. Don't forget about Vigil.
---
if u don't have many operators on your account and they're all picked by teammates or banned (so u don't have any operators left to choose) you'll automatically be recruit

What makes the left one a ''real'' MP5?

The first one is a variation of the mp5

&gt;Stupidly OP walking weapon of mass destruction
---
&gt;Still dies to a  P90 because he couldn't control Buck's recoil 'cause he decided to put a supressor on it
---
I do not care, but take my upvote
---
MnK is cheating and not hacking.
---
To you it may not be difference, but it is a big difference.
---
This is the reason why I permanently quit Siege ranked. 
---
2 seasons ago, 7 matches in placements, I was constantly being matched up with full gold and plat teams (I checked r6tab) while my teammates were silvers and bronzes who weren't even close to level 100, with below 1.0 KDs. In those 7 matches, I hard carried with 20+ kills in all of them but still lost. In one of the games which we lost 4-5, the 4 rounds we won were all won by me. It's so fucking demoralising when you carry so hard that you have more kills than *your entire team + the enemy team's top fragger combined* but you still lose like 80 fucking elo. 
---
Next season after that, same fucking thing happened, except for 8 matches in placements. I was completely fucking done. That was the end of Siege for me.
---
Smokyrie
---
Made me hard and wet
---
Bet ur fun at parties
---
I think the terminate should be a user activated thing that way Mozzie has the possibility of hacking and using the drone maybe as an emp against a twitch drone or something like that
---
Hello Coby_T, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cj865l/did_i_run_into_a_hacker_or_did_the_server_just/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Still a MP5. Or does a folding stock make a weapon not real?
---
Pretty sure you don't get that renown back
---
what, just because i think this dude's joke is stupid? lmao
---
Had this problem but only in game when alt-tabbing ever since new update still running 144 fps in-game. seems ubisoft bugged themselves during update i guess hopefully it gets resolved soon
---
Take a closer look at the weapon
---
Why *shotguns* when you have *knifes*
---
Hot potato
---
The Power Ranger squad.

Believe me, that's way more iconic in siege.

Are ypu trolling mr?

Where is this? I would genuinely like to see this irl. I‚Äôm guessing Chatswood
---
Repost!!!
---
get clash she has cancer
---
The pistol. Forgot the name but the recoil is low and single fire works like a pistol damn well.
---
Does it run well
---
This can happen in premades late at night/early in the day. It struggles to find a match up and just throws you against some people. A buddy of mine and me (Plat3/2) get matched up against teams of diamonds from time to time if we play outside peak hours. Worst we had was an enemy team with 4 people in diamond...
---
Oof
---
Alright thanks man. If the SMG is like the British one I know I'm not gonna have a good time with that.
---
The SMG 12 used to be very good but they needed the recoil. The CZ 75 is a better option it you don't mind the lack of a sight
---
It‚Äôs legendary soo.. it‚Äôs pretty rare
---
a 100 ping causes enough delay to miss the headshot there, you hit her definetely, the blood on the back of the wall wasnt there and she was at 30 health.
---
Yeah I think I'll use the pistol
---
Yes
---
Don't dare you talk about my main like that. He's got the same name as i do too.
---
I know how you feel. I hate the smg 11 and 12, with the SaS the pistol is way more useful to me with 48 damage.
---
Yeah and since pistols got buffed a while back they are wa@aaay more reliable than before too
---
well according to the game i didnt hit her at all since i didnt get the assist when she died
---
filfth like you need to be banned lol
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Retards just running in to your bullets
---
Wasn‚Äôt it just the Smg-11 that got buffed not the Smg-12 and Bearing 9?
---
I played 12 games of Showdown and didn't get a single headshot for the challenge. I think I only got 5 kills in total. So I guess I can relate.

Thx

REPORTED

There shouldn't even be a return to menu button
---
Alright I get you
---
Seems pretty cool. And the guns look pretty cool. A vector variant and a shotty from what I can tell
---
Honestly man idk. I just get my seige news from this sub which so far hasn't really let me down
---
What if I told you.... It's not always timing, they hear you walking and they react
---
I mean it's got Avicii instrumentals and Chumbawamba. You're fine. I didn't rickroll you just to rickroll--it's a seriously good mashup.
---
yes!
---
I mean it's got Avicii instrumentals and Chumbawamba. Of course it would be great. I didn't rickroll you just to rickroll--it's a seriously good mashup.

Oh  Xd
---
Oh lmao
---
Awesome!
---
{‚Äì}7
---
So basically OP is an asshole and wanted to brag about being an asshole?
---
Yeah
---
The problem is with a question like this it all depends on your play style, I mean they all can be good and add to the game if played well, but it's up to you to decide who's best for YOU.
---
When i have the choice i do, my mates insisted on playing ranked (casual is bad they said), ofc i could say no, but that would be boring, i had to play alone (which i hate) and they would have to 4 stack.  
---
After all it is a game i play for my own enjoyment and the enjoyment of my friends, so playing in a way that would be not fun for me (alone) or not fun to my freinds (me as a plat 2 and the gold 4s facing plats all night) just to not be "tOxIc SmUrF" would be counter intuitive.
---
And I'm not pretending to be morally higher. I am. He boosts selfishly to plat 1 and stays gold 3 in amercan servers to boost his k/d to make himself look better, where I am just picking up a lower rank acc to casually play ranked with friends.
---
There's 2 types of Miras. Trash cans that didn't pick an op so they got Mira and don't know how to use her, and the Mira mains who are the single worst players in the game bc they constantly stop you from covering a wall then the other team gently blows up that wall, quietly rushes and gracefully kills the entire defending team.
---
Awww shit dude they're using the part of their brain that they warn us not to use
---
Finally some one got it.
---
I dunno, it would make attacking 3F Kafe/Hereford even more of a pain
---
Well shotguns can't headshot either anymore for years now. And being purely lucky isn't a good mechanic.
---
that framerate though, üÖ±Ô∏èoi
---
Ned is that you?
---
Nice new gun. I'll take a new sniper any day
---
How is the map nerfed?
---
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks!
---
Thats one shitty Tachanka cosplay...
---
Sry mate I cannot name a more iconic clan
---
You realise we mean you and not the person you messaged right?  Just want to clear that up
---
Actually he used suomikonepistooli (smg) also but thats pretty op secondary
---
That is true, Thanks!
---
Any of the operators with soft breaching capabilities, like grenades, would
---
CoconutBrah has reached the final boss at Ubisoft
---
I can see the initial reaction being that he may be too strong, but it really don‚Äôt see it. There is clear counter play with hard breachers being able to open these, if they‚Äôre on a window. If on a doorway, it‚Äôs the same. Nearly every map is built on not having the main access routes into a site being windows; they‚Äôre mainly doorways. 
---
Plus he will be site specific for sure, like he is now. Difference is that there are more instances where he can get value overall. 
---
It may be too strong but from afar, I think it would be ok. If you see that though, fair enough. I can see where you are coming from
---
I was wondering why everyone was bad in this game then I realised it was on console
---
At first someone called me hibana is inside my obj, so i just fired around me like a madman, then ying came in and idk what happened, i couldnt see the killcam xD. And at the end I was doing echos job, being an annoying arse.

Great for when someone has the game installed on an IDE HDD. You can check if the game has started yet while peeing/getting a drink/cleaning/gardening/servicing the car.
---
Recruit club?
---
It really depends on your playstyle. Do you play anchor or roamer? Do you want to go for solo frags or do you rather want to support your team?
---
But in general, Lesion is pretty good right now. Other options are: Bandit, J√§ger, Echo (unless you play much ranked he gets banned everytimes), Doc/Rook and Mira.
---
Ahhh hahah sup
---
Me watching this video:
---
My brain: well I mean someone got an ace in 20 seco- Oh. Ok well this guy better get in the f*cking Guinness world record books or some sh*t

FANTASTIC An arm rest used as a mouse pad ,legs used as a stand and a complimentary dronk
---
lmao i just seen ur comment lololol
---
So Rum on here, tonic over there?
---
So your saying all adults are mature sure....
---
When did cap have blue smoke??
---
Yes, there would be two different play styles with Mend, a roamer who‚Äôs better off with the burst, who is risking his teams gadgets if he dies, and someone who could camp, probably Better off with the smg, that‚Äôs why I made him 3 speed, meaning he‚Äôs weaker on sight, but also is scared to roam. Giving him a powerful gadget means he must be made difficult to play;)
---
Which still doesn't address the problem with him
---
don't get your hopes up. there is no way to proof ddosing and ubisoft won't do shit about it.
---
HAHAHAHAHMID
---
Aki No Tsuru is a p rare one I have from Red Crow it‚Äôs black with dark red borders, autumn leaves falling and a white dove. There are gold accents on parts of the weapons too.
---
But he would be wiable in  a way. Imagine pairing him with mira.
---
That would change the gadget entirely so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a route I would go, but interesting nevertheless
---
A valkrie, a maestro, two people with bulletproof cameras, all pointed at a Tachanka surrounded by reinforced walls. Four people scanning in cams. Carnage.
---
Exactly
---
And then he gets naded through the floor
---
... you been here for 4 years first of all second of all this is a video game subreddit third of all again how haven‚Äôt you noticed if you been part of the subreddit are you blind?
---
Well it is funny to me and I‚Äôm not 9 soo
---
Me: WTF
---
also me: oh
---
Fortress too while they are at it...  So many rooms to drone....  It's terrible.
---
That just shows that it would not be op because you can have many counters against him.
---
Boy do I not
---
&gt;the game is made of spaghetti
---
The code is tangled, twisted, messy. Game was built on the assassins creed engine and has been peacmealed out, it has bugs, especially collision bugs, baked into its core. Theres a reason operation health is keme level status.
---
&gt;but how you said it
---
Oh i gathered as much from the screenshot, but i intentionally mirrored how you made your original remark. 
---
So if you don't like how i said what i said, you have to take the exact same umbridge with yourself.
---
That was an original idea, but it‚Äôs already more powerful to just wait by a wall with either a bandit or mute, (the manual way) as it would also be destroying the enemies gadget stock, so in this case, Mend might actually be better off doing runouts and spawnkills very aggressively so that he does die
---
There is only one
---
yeah sorry... i see ur gadget as a strong ban every game

The only people who argue which console is better are the ones who cant afford both (im xbox btw)

The same as jager
---
Maybe that means something
---
Damn. Beat me too it
---
No brain roam'n'peek boi.
---
That would be pretty dumb, as when attack is switched to defence, they also have no way to counter twitch or thatcher as the gameplay changes means they too are made stronger, in any case, I don‚Äôt care, maybe then I‚Äôll get to play either lesion or cav for once lol
---
I've played console since release up until 3 months ago. Me and all my friends with decided to actually quit the game for reasons like this. Console siege is incredibly toxic. If you can get a full game in without an intentional tk you are lucky
---
Booster still ticks regardless of in game or if your sleeping with the Xbox off
---
Yes. If you activate a 24 hr boost it will go away exactly 24 hrs later, whether you‚Äôre in game or not
---
I'm ps4 my name is Flaws007
---
If you leave i reckon they should triple the amount of elo lost if thet purposely return to menu
---
I just can't see the reason for not simply placing your Mira on the reinforcement so you can see everything, then when you see an enemy, you can lean out and shoot through an adjacent soft wall or hole in a soft wall. You get much better cover and vision. Maybe in this case, now that I think about it, maybe the boat would have blocked a mira on the right wall, but he still could have maybe shot through the doorway
---
So there is no way to pauze a booster when youre not playing the game?
---
No üòï
---
ü§£ good point...does he get an acog??
---
Bambi
---
Semtex!
---
Brother!
---
It‚Äôs probably extremely difficult to do, and they may not be able to do anything about it, for one it probably just registers as a usb input. And second that‚Äôs probably an issue that would have to be dealt with via the console companies
---
"Pathetic"
---
I'm not good enough in the game to be coach, but the human interaction aspect I can handle very well.. I'd like to give a try for free but it's probably the better for everybody if you find someone more professional
---
It‚Äôs clearly your internet, ying was running on the spot at the end.
---
While I agree, it‚Äôs impossible to do, because there are a lot of people who play ranked that have internet that simply sucks. This causes them to be kicked from the game. I see posts all the time on this sub of people lagging out or dcing on match point and getting an abandon. You can‚Äôt implement a system like you suggest without punishing people who don‚Äôt deserve it.
---
And if whoever reads this happens to be a person of the mindset ‚Äújust get better internet‚Äù you need to understand not everyone lives in a high population city, where it‚Äôs actually profitable for companies to lay fiber.
---
Sir, this is your only warning... the FBI dislikes your meme and we are disgusted
---
I guess the answer was obvious, but I wanted to check more deeply on his face, and his suit.
---
And if I go more deep, his weapon, is the AR of thermite.
---
You were lucky to have gotten up, that's all.
---
His gun was one of the weapon available for the recruit playable back then. As I said, you are overthinking this.
---
Get em
---
Any seasonal skin from year 1. The only seasonal skin you can get in alpha packs is the black ice skin, And it‚Äôs only for the original 20 ops plus buck and frost. 
---
The dust line seasonal is super rare and so is the year 1 pro league skin.
---
Waiting for company
---
Monty is annoying due to him being a super teenage mutant Ninja turtle with his fucking sheild
---
I got the same pens, why can‚Äôt I do this, I would like to report this hack
---
O and a zero.
---
Sure do.
---
how many y1 pro league skins are there
---
Depending on your play style, I would suggest unlocking Alibi first, as she has a really nice SMG, a really fun shotgun, a really fun shotgun pistol and a very viable revolver. She also has both impacts and deployable shields which helps her suit most playstyles. Her gadget is also super easy to use (just throw in front of a window). While Maestro has a powerful Acog LMG, he takes a lot more skill in terms of utility. Don‚Äôt even bother with Clash unless your part of a coordinated 3 - 5 stack team.
---
1 I think.
---
I don‚Äôt even care what you wrote you‚Äôre a cancer on console go play pc
---
I am just a fan who enjoy to see little details.
---
I missed outbreak, and saw the trailers again.
---
It's just, I noticed a lot of details, and they can work to the new Mexican OP in the future or probably he have 0 clue about that operation, so, meh...
---
&gt;Aim assist makes it much easier to get really good at aiming with a controller, hell even the pros in CoD play with a controller.
---
Does that not highlight it as a problem? You're essentially saying they should put in an aimbot.
---
Game is unplayable past plat 2 Xbox
---
Crossfader seasonal plus black ice for like every bloody pistol in the game. Also I think elephant skin might be my oldest skin üòÇ
---
that has 10x scope lmao
---
I see why he likes to mask so much
---
I‚Äôm genuinely confused here actually. At first I thought the same thing but he‚Äôs clearly using his XBox controller at the bottom. Then... it‚Äôs on top of his keyboard. 
---
Is he complaining about m&amp;k... whilst using a controller to play on PC? Or did he, for some reason, hook an XBox up to a PC monitor?
---
We may never know.
---
LUL
---
What's the sign he's making with his hand?
---
Correct. The less polys the engine has to render, the better performance you get out of the game. I understand the humor behind these kinds posts but they‚Äôre getting old now.
---
I struggle controlling recoil on some guns, so if I aim head level, I usually miss the head shot.
---
Red dot.  The dot takes up less space than the triangle and you can see through tighter angles better.  It‚Äôs just visually more appealing than the halo and doesn‚Äôt have that extra circle line around the dot.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Mine used o be stomach chunks, now it‚Äôs that oregano
---
This isn't an attempt to provide evidence against MnK users or boosters, just highlighting that a team of 3 gold's is placed against a diamond, 3 plats and only 1 other gold ranked player. This problem happens in ranked as well, I don't consider a diamond to be near my skill level whatsoever, even my casual MMR.
---
Oh yeah I see it now , my bad it looked like him clicking keys. Either way this post is useless
---
It‚Äôs either the point of a lame joke or he just has his keyboard plugged in to type messages (I believe you can do that)
---
welp
---
Do you know possible when?

that thatcher kill was big yikes but nice ace

Right now, I‚Äôm a low silver, but was at high silver levels last season. I would be higher in ranks but I struggle to find ranked squads because I have a lot of bronze friends, and solo q on Xbox is horrible.

Come and read the subreddit rules first
---
Man now I have some nightmares thanks
---
What platform are you on I can probably help you in a few days if you want
---
A lot of people don't like it. but I really like sledge's hazmat suit.
---
This is fucking well put together, i wish Ubi was this creative. The only problem i'd see with this (if it was real), is that she would be almost mandatory on attack.
---
I prefer my explosives included uncooked, thank you very much
---
The most elite of elite special forces!
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I would suggest getting a 3 day booster or something and grinding team terrorist hunts... you can finish them in like a minute and get 250 renown for each and make like 1,000 renown every 10 minutes. I made almost 50k renown in 3 days just doing that once I switched to PC so I could get a lot of the ops that I used to use on PS4.
---
Hey, I was expecting it to get removed immediately since I've had things that were more related to Siege removed on more ridiculous grounds. It didn't get removed this time around though, so I agree with you that it's nonsense, but since I keep seeing countless posts of similar caliber, I feel like it's fair to share whatever any individual feels is relevant.
---
What mouse are you using?
---
Wasn't this in a thumbnail of a tux bird video?
---
the drones get a white outline once they get hacked, prep phase or action phase
---
This is possible using various items on the floor that when you approach you slowly slide up them.
---
This has been around for a while
---
do you also have access to the texture files for the model? Any chance of uploading these to steam workshop for example?
---
Wrong
---
That means that there is a chance that Ubi might reveal Vigil's face. 
---
Why even put in a mouth if we never get to see it?
---
Only just found this out xD. How long has it been around?
---
Bible learn, Hentai Luigi
---
Im talking about people running around destroying all the drones before I hack
---
There‚Äôs 10 total drones on attack. Mozzie has 3 pests. That means **nobody gives a fuck**
---
Really thought you were going white stripes not some electro ripoff, so disappointed
---
For a few seasons now :p
---
Look man if you don't know how to place your drone grabbers in strategic positions I'm going to destroy every drone you miss.
---
I've accidentally killed a mozzie drone once or twice, but worse yet, is that my squad has an inside joke about whoever picks mozzie is gonna get shot in the back. We were playing casual and one of my guys picked mozzie. He got shot on spawn by a hair trigger. Later on he comes through a door and a different mate panics and plugs him a cpl times (thank god for doc). Later on yet I'm lighting up an enemy and, would you guess it, mozzie walks out in front of me for a cheeky kill steal that results in him meeting god. All this happened in one round.

Idk man my team rarely shoots my drone. Only the low levels but I forgive them :3 Newbies are learning.

---
Thinking about it, I‚Äôm just no good at ranked, the whole team was golds and they had this one diamond, was just weird cause we were all unranked
---
Lol are all console players like this?
---
&gt;That doesn‚Äôt work like you think, clash can‚Äôt use her weapon while her shield is up because it‚Äôs like montange‚Äôs shield, where it‚Äôs near 180 degree protection. 
---
Yeah I know why, what I'm saying is that this type of balancing is better than being able to shoot with an RNG cone of fire from behind a bulletproof shield.
---
&gt;Blitz, unlike the other operators, don‚Äôt have 90 degree protection, and just like montange‚Äôs shield while off the full protection, can be beat by melee attacks. Blitz is strong relative to the past because he‚Äôs 2 speed 2 armour, and can run with the shield up. What should be done is a small fix to consistency with melee range.
---
Blitz having the ability to sprint with the shield up should be his trade off for having a small sheild. 
---
And yes his ability to flash and rush also needs fixing, moving him back to a 1 speed would be nice.
---
His flash should have a shorter duration too. I'd actually be ok with him having a longer flash range that lasted far, far shorter.
---
It doesn't matter if you win or lose, if a cheater gets banned, all players from their recent games have their mmr reset, even if you beat them. Kinda sucks since you won, but that's just how it goes.

It's not a glitch. If you leave a ranked match those stats aren't affected.

---
*doot doot but lower.*
---
I mean, that is the only way to defend the top of yacht. It's the only objective where running out and being aggressive on windows is the best play for defense. If you anchor down, the attack will just pick you apart because of the lack of any decent positions. Any one angle the defense can hold, is vulnerable to an outside angle by the attack. And there is no reason for defense to be on the floor below, because then it is near impossible to get back up. So aggression is the best play.

Looks like you misread.  What he's saying is, don't shoot every drone you see, because Mozzie could have the opportunity to hack the drone if you DON'T shoot it.
---
Not please don't shoot hacked drones as you've clearly read it.
---
Either way, it's dubious advice because it misunderstands Mozzies overall power.

one thing ive learned... you never go in to casual alone
---
This is the source of this suggestion. I am tired of playing the same ranked games, with the same banned OPs. I would like variety to the strategy of the game, and 6 people banned on 100 planned OPS is not alot as far as endgame. And sometimes when you are stuck at a specific rank, dumb bans happen, weather its you're outnumbered on your team vote or the opposing.

Like choosing to piss next to you when all the other places are empy.
---
how does she have a green laser sight
---
Her recoil is easy to control?
---
Ye both are trash ( since we are flexing I have xbox, ps4, Nintendo, and a PC
---
Honestly is doesn't really matter how he uses it. As long as he puts the traps out there to deny drones it's good enough help.
---
I asked reddit for a new username and all I got was this tshirt

That keyboard is long as my dick lol
---
You need the world's smallest mouse and keyboard
---
Because your connection to your router and your connection to the servers are not at all the same. 
---
Have you forwarded your ports?
---
We know about this bug . No need to repost the same stuff again . Thank you and use search bar before posting .

They should either not count or count for way less Elo

Cobalt on lesion elite on every weapon
---
keyboard?
---
I use the flash hider for recoil control, it's actually fucking amazing for full auto
---
This needs more updoots. GET ON IT SOLDIERS
---
Thanks dadüòò
---
Cobalt looks better than diamond imo
---
Never gets old.
---
Is this out now?
---
One of my friends reinforces next to me all the time and it really pisses me off. He doesn't understand why, o matter how many times I explain to him that I got the wall, go find some other wall.
---
Yea
---
the secret is don't use a compensator, use a flash hider
---
it eliminates the left right recoil and makes it to where all you have to do is pull down, and not even that much. it's pretty epic and has been that way since his release, people just listen to meta and ignore everything else
---
same
---
people never cared who i was until i put on my skull
---
Yep, thats just A fanart. Agreed.
---
Cobalt looks nice but it's personal prefence
---
Jeezqu

not yet but this was probably put there in case they made some

My ranked experience in a nutshell

I had mine on top of my tower lol

Seems good apart from the fact that just shooting normal bullets would be stronger ü§îü§î
---
:')
---
right? crazy
---
Ur just change sens
---
Then you gotta upgrade somethin
---
Yes. I play at roughly your rank, but on console, which could make a difference. 
---
I don't see him banned as frequently as I see comfort bans like vigil or cav.
---
It's also worth noting though that I spend most of my time in casual, so I'm not quite an expert
---
the one advantage console has over pc
---
how am i an edge lord for thinking the joke was fuckin stupid lmao
---
Dude that would require me to get lucky shots or even win my gun fights.
---
Uh, ps4 ddosing. Happens at least once every day I play
---
I might be dumb but can you explain why everyone says he needs a bandana?
---
Ah yes. I am sir metaldick.
---
üíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
You can't kill somone who is clipped through wall but that still gives a huge disadvantage to clipped players. That needs to be solved somehow I know this is a known thing by all players but Ubisoft need to do something about this.
---
Laughs in scorpion Eva
---
Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask
---
It's just the disappointment I get when I realise if I held it for a few more seconds I would've gotten killed anyway
---
Hacking and ddosing are two different things, this is ddosing
---
Now you get tked for not teamkilling   ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The fact that no one has made a JoJos reference in this comment thread is beyond me
---
one day friend ;)
---
Just play with friends
---
i got it at 4% yesterday as well but only got a common
---
All of my friends kinda stopped playing this game, they‚Äôll hop on every now and again
---
Literally though. For some reason his main AR is literally uncontrollable after the first 4 shots... Idk if it‚Äôs really on purpose but it seems weird because he‚Äôs a great Op but far from being an overpowered/vital one!
---
Just an FYI because I see it often: Technically, cardiac arrest just means the heart stops beating. Every person that dies has cardiopulmonary arrest (heart and lungs stop). This can only happen if there is an actual health-related event that causes it (assuming a natural death). A death certificate cannot only contain cardiac arrest and be approved by a medical examiner or the state.  This is an understandable common misconception, mostly because the media/tv is lazy and reports these things as such.
---
His name is snake and their is a video game character with the same name who is always shown wearing a bandana and also sometimes shown with a eye patch
---
I can't believe you use Big Nate as monitor stand.

I just need Zofia.... I'm almost there with you. Congrats!

No it was definitely skill

Since when could you get back up from a "dbno" state?
---
Why am I getting Captain Levi vibes from this?
---
You should've just bought boosters man
---
I bought me the same mouse a few days ago.
---
Nice, I‚Äôve only gotten Black Ice for crappy weapons lul
---
I liked the old ones better. I feel they gave the operators more personality.
---
They say it's considered cheating, I wouldn't. As tempting as it may be in some cases. I've seen people with pretty fantastic aim on a controller.
---
Ah, then u can try play with people from recruiting things or whatever, they will also probs be adverse to tking and have gone onto sites/apps/subreddits for the same purpose
---
I made the thing. Waiting on a person to help design a logo. I will admit it needs cleaned up, kinda feels like i was lazy
---
The pinned post in "Hot" :
---
#Am i a joke to you ?
---
Go to the sub options and go to where it says to change flair, if you want more than one you have to edit and type them in by putting the name of an operator between a set of colons. Ex. :Rook: / :Rookchibi:
---
depends, do you want smoke from everyone on this community? it‚Äôs cheating and you probably shouldn‚Äôt
---
I play on Xbox
---
I think it‚Äôs a little small for buck‚Äôs recoil. I think a couple more meters and you‚Äôll be good!
---
Next gen is going to be mnk accessible... it people ddos,glitch,hack, and teamkill... some times you just got to say what the hey and go for it lololol
---
&gt; 50% of the time I don‚Äôt hear the Thermite charge being placed at all.
---
Shoot a small hole before reinforcing. This way sound passes through easier.
---
Dude i only have smg 11 and pmm balck ice the 2 guns i almost barely use
---
I once had my team vote to kick me because I was 1v5 and I had finished off 3 of them, but apparently I wasn't going fast enough for them. I didnt even die yet and they wanted to boot me. I talked mad shit to them for the rest of the game, but realized that ain't the type of shit I wana be doing anymore. When I was 16 in MW2 lobbies i didnt care, but at 25 it's just fuckin annoying now
---
Casual rounds are now 3:30
---
If you get the edition that comes with first 20 ops and occasionally get boosters it helps. Plus, the more matches you win gets you double.
---
Frost drinks to forget lesion stealing her kills.
---
If you shoot out the soft wall before renforcing it, you can hear it better.
---
I dont need any other console but the x tbh. So i want mnk regardless. Fuck the pc community in my experience. Not hating on all ye ppl
---
I forgot what I got but it definitely wasnt anything more than an uncommon. I have awful luck with alpha packs.
---
There is a way to defend tho. You know the ladder that goes up into one of the sights? There‚Äôs this bulletproof hatch on the back of it. Put your back to the hatch and a deployable shield in front of you and just sit there.
---
Well I like a acog and sledge has a acog but a slow fire rate
---
Yes, you do.
---
If I have someone in my rifle sight Im putting bullets in them no point to shooting a needle
---
And me over here on PS4 not allowed to turn super quick and have the ability to be a better aimer
---
Nothing wrong here tbh, bullets come straight out of face.
---
Agreed
---
Fuck off
---
Yes pls ubi should do something
---
Just get at least 1 friend to play with then nobody can kick you
---
I would help but my PC is broken feelsbadman.png
---
"These filthy casuals fell for my traps again, pathetic."
---
Thanks, dude! Think imma go for mozzie, then. It's confirmed
---
Where‚Äôs my sad boys playlist
---
Tho would be the best operator for team ruiners.
---
I'm guessing you're one of the people voting to ban Cav and Jackal?
---
‚ÄúHey boys, look what i got here!‚Äù
---
Make that a *0,5* and you‚Äôre spot on
---
i mean, this is one of the more reasonable nerfs I've seen, but not pulling out a gu is on you. it takes like 2 seconds and it's not that difficult
---
I agree if the smg was buffed slightly this operator would be very useful , as that moment has very restricted use for the casual players
---
can we talk about the keyboard?
---
Banana skin
---
C7E
---
Major foot fetish
---
Iron sights on any weapon reduces recoil, I don‚Äôt know why but try it out for yourself.
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt care but I wanna know why you do it lol
---
Doesn't he already do that? The gu mine does the most damage when you hit it and does decreasing damage every cycle until you remove it
---
Mah man
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt often use the smg, but it‚Äôs helps if your opponent is down the hall or something
---
meanwhile on yacht...
---
Got dirty very fast considering that you "just" got it...
---
And yes I know it‚Äôs cas
---
well we do need an attacking healer
---
Ha, you made a funny
---
Mine stand on my desk
---
My problem at the moment as I am just not a fan of shotguns but want to lean to the because of restricted use of smg
---
Most videos like this that are quick cuts don‚Äôt really equal good aim. You‚Äôd be surprised how much editing can make your kills look badass. A good example of consistent good aim is shroud.
---
A little breezy in there now
---
Lmao you're a funny mother fucker dude. I'm done with this shit you're exhuasting
---
No. But that‚Äôs another idea.

I would give Nokk the G36C and Warden the P90. Nokk's gadget in the current meta offers zero value to her team so she should get a rifle like every other attacker has. Warden's current loadout do not compliment his speed and ability.

Nigg isn‚Äôt a racial slur, i was typing it and then i tried to type something else but hit enter by accident. Then i did some research of my own and discovered that ubi has a system to where after a certain number of reports your account gets monitored and investigated but i didn‚Äôt get that, no, I was just instabanned as soon as I selected twitch 2 days later.

New op leaked. Akimbo. Their gadget is a sling that allows them to use two weapons, throw two grenades, TK two teammates, at once. Absolutely busted on launched, needed into the ground after one patch.
---
Sorry this is out of your jurisdiction
---
Well i seem to have made a grave mistake
---
Aha.
---
i want frost to step on me
---
Dude I wish there was an operator that had a zoom scope
---
Frost: 
---
Literally everyone: *thunk*
---
Frost:  :)
---
Tbf i've seen weirder bans:
---
Ash, Thatcher, Bandit, No ban
---
Ok, maybe not but it also doesn't have to be for just high level of play, alot of the current ops don't get used for high level play and this op idea isn't really for any skill level
---
I play on console (yes go ahead and hang me) is it really that hard to control on PC?
---
I read that too on this sub but I wasn‚Äôt sure whether or not it was misinformation.
---
Faggot.
---
Just use 32000 dpi
---
Red is definitely copper... I had to crawl myself out of copper hell
---
Entirely depends on the site. But on average bandit, he's more versatile
---
Epic.
---
I used to be a wrist aimer as well. I played 1600 DPI no matter the game, it took me a couple of months to become an arm aimer, but my game has improved so much for it. I play at 450dpi now and feel like I have so much more control for the FPS games I play
---
How do you feel about the other semi auto shotguns if the FO12 is causing such problems for you? Past 10 meters that shotgun isn't outgunning an automatic rifle. If you're playing aggressively, then yeah, shotguns are going to feel oppressive.
---
Gold
---
I like more social aspect you dog
---
Don‚Äôt know in pc, but on console you should use the flash hider, the gun barely moves
---
1- a silver 1 is equal to a gold 2 or a gold 1 is equal to a plat 1 in ur logic. Then why isnt the gold 1 a plat 1. There is a reason why he is in gold
---
2- they are good players who are playing with low ranked smurfs so they play against gold. If they were to play against plat 2 or 1s they would get there ass handed to them.
---
3- you are telling me i should have won this game with my dumbass teammates who are golds vs plats. Again THIS IS A TEAM BASED GAME. You cant carry the whole team alone this well turn into a 1v5
---
DPI literally doesn't matter. I've been playing 1200 dpi for years now, and I have plenty of friend with 3200dpi who are in diamond.
---

Hello NotAnElaAshMain, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cjiqot/we_seriously_need_to_bring_awareness_to_this_issue/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yea but if you were gold 4 then they would be gold 2 not a big difference especially since they would have silver 2s
---
Okay cool thanks
---
sending it to a friend that's all im not _that_ big of a karma whore
---
It‚Äôs a shotgun. There‚Äôs no headshot multiplier.
---
üòÇ
---
It is still different. U cant put a plat 2 with golds and say thats fair. The plat 2 is plat for a reason. He can frag out easily against golds. 
---
Another thing is yesterday i had a mmr difference of 175.
---
This is the exact opposite of how it works. Higher dpi IS more accurate, but the difference is so small it doesn't really matter. Pros recommend to play on whatever dpi you feel like, it honestly doesn't matter.
---
2nd commenr but i'm curious;
---
Low ranks?
---
Shut up.
---
sledge and rook.
---
You see I still use old boxes from when I moved like almost 2 years ago as a desk/stand
---
Well on higher quality mice it‚Äôs like that but if ur using cheaper mice lower dpi is more accurate
---
I'm fine with the other Semi's because they don't have a super fast fire rate like the FO12. Plus they don't have Vertical grip options and a extended barrel attachment.
---
im just getting a refund
---
nope, im just gonna refund
---
Nice. I hope someday I get mp7 or mp5 black ice
---
nope, im gonna refund
---
True
---
Pretty okay operator, she's niche but strong on certain maps (like coastline, where her mines deny stairs).
---
i get you on the realistic side of this, but as a game you can't have both teams punished for one team doing something wrong
---
This is why alpha packs suck
---
:(
---
We all have the same problem üòÖ
---
rook
---
Please stop comparing ranks. A gold 4 is a gold 4 and a gold 2 is a gold 2. End of story. If ur saying he can play against a gold 2 why is he down there. Why isnt he gold 2. Is a plat 3 equal to a plat 1. I get that plat 1s and daimonds are the same but thats it. All other ranks should not be compared to each other
---
That‚Äôs tough
---
The only way I see this being useful is if he shoots a trap similar to Nomad but it behaves like a Lesion. Otherwise you could just shoot them with regular bullets and go for a kill.
---
Gold 1-2
---
I like that silly blonde.
---
don't really care about skins but its fun for achieving stuff i guess. my luck is just not there
---
I can maybe tkmk
---
What are you on about? Cheap mice can't do super high dpi, it's the optical sensor that determines that stuff. 
---
You could take out the internals of a deathadder elite and glue it to your hand, and it would literally still be as accurate sensor wise as in the mouse.
---
As long as your DPI is above 400 it genuinely doesn't matter, just play whatever you feel comfortable browsing your computer with.
---
12 12 15 12 10 8 7
---
Maybe poisonous bullets? Idk
---
This lag switching is becoming a serious issue for games ranked ~Gold 2+. Or at least it‚Äôs a serious issue on PS4. It makes the game unplayable and makes me want to quit the game I‚Äôve loved and been playing for 4+ years. I‚Äôm not sure if Ubisoft has addressed the issue already, if they have please send me a link. PS4 seriously needs everyone‚Äôs help.
---
Jackal's c7e imo.
---
They are charms
---
The c8 is definitely good, but you're kidding yourself if you think it's better than the c7e.
---
Bruh what I play 10 10 but with 400 dpi
---
I'm in this picture and I dont like it
---
How is that even gold four, silvers are not even that bad.
---
Same
---
The copper two seems to be pulling his weight lol
---
I‚Äôm an angry plat Caveira main and i feel your pain.
---
It would be perfect.
---
They should because they aren‚Äôt that much better than you at all, if you can‚Äôt beat someone two ranks above you that‚Äôs your fault. It‚Äôs not impossible
---
+Respect
---
Don‚Äôt know but trust me they were gold 4
---
Why is this post getting more attention that my more recent updated version of this.
---
I mean like i know the pros play arm, and everyone always says that its better when they play, but i just don't understand how one can play like that. Besides im not having any problems with my aim rn so its whatever

Diamonds step in 10.2% of frost traps placed while Copper IVs only do 8.2%
---
Can u please gimme ur rank
---
The reason pick and ban existed in PL was to add competitive strategy, not to change up the game for everyone. Votes from each team are supposed to be targeted towards giving them an advantage, which is why it adds an extra level of depth to team strategy and thinking about bans, it is not there to simply ‚Äòchange the game a bit‚Äô. 
---
Unifying bans will be stupid as this will just encourage comfort bans, there is no way around that. Everyone will vote for jackal or lion or what have you because they find them annoying. If everyone is voting for a ban, there is no team vs team strategy, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúwe hate this operator‚Äù.

Or fun for those who want it, mostly everyone in GTA online has modded money so regular public lobbies are basically bad sport now, what with all the stupid overpowered bullshit they put in the game. It might work, but I have little faith in it.

Thanks for the kind words sir!

You can't vote in ranked and if you have any friends that play the game try to play with them. The game is a much better experience with friends it'll get to the point where you just play to have fun with your friends instead of just trying to win
