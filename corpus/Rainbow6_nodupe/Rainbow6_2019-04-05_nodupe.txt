---
Damn son that‚Äôs amazing
---
For me it‚Äôs personally the opposite. When I played console I would give a callout, then mute my mic and be teamkilled or kicked. People need to chill and if someone wants to or doesn‚Äôt want to talk, leave them be.
---
Yes!
---
That's a good thing 
---
Nice skills friend. 
---
Ela is heapsa fun
---
No. This does not happen to me at least. Could it be something with your pc. (Post pc specs in comments it would help). R6S could also just run out of memory and crash. I don't have a fix but, maybe somebody else can help if you give a bit more detail. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling?
---
Swearing is an expression of how serious you are, and I‚Äôm genuinely concerned with your ability to form complete sentences. Yes it aggravated me when you were being a bumbling fucking turd, just put a little effort in typing up a sentence so people aren‚Äôt writing on windows to try and figure out what the fuck you meanüëç
---
I like that if you listen outside the plane, you hear a woman saying things like: 
---

---
'Wash your hands before your come down to dinner!"
---
and 
---
"You better clean your room before bedtime!"
---
If it were the headgear I'd have been happy enough, but it's the pink cammo ;(
---
They do that to check if it‚Äôs a problem on their side, or your side. If it‚Äôs required to fill out the form, just do it. It probably doesn‚Äôt even matter what you put in though, since your just missing a skin
---
That's exactly what I've ran into, fairly new to the game so I was hoping this wasn't going to be full of idiots 
---
So link them.

Your username is it a reference to The Punisher?

Dude this is siege, the second you look away from an angle, a wild cav appears.

Why are my enemies not like that

They just turn around and shoot peps like me

Actually i might be a little dumb mistaking the enemy fuze for kapkan oof

You used to be able to get it in a bundle. It was for all handguns.

Now I think it‚Äôs only packs.

It can also be the name of a good punk band. Bloodstains.

I reckon the reduction is to allow counterbalancing with a buff to the gadget like 2or 3 bullets to destroy one, or increased damage
---
Does anyone know if the challenge packs are awarded after the event since i collected (completed the challenge but still no pack)
---
interesting bug
---
what?? why did they do that?
---
That‚Äôs a true story of a lost friend, thank you brother
---
it is kind of creepy
---
DU HAST MICH
---
nomad isn‚Äôt even a defender
---
Great gun selection too
---
I find there is a skillgap but at the same time it‚Äôs exaggerated by you. I hit plat 2 on other accounts in eu a lot, but on na I hit it and often had to go against diamonds in na. They seem (at least for me) mostly very good at aiming but bad with game sense, meaning you can outplay them with coordination.
---
Unintentional badassery
---
They can more easily adjust their mouse instead of using clumsy triggers?
---
Bro you use your left hand to wipe your ass?
---
Inb4 that doesn't even happen.
---
I don‚Äôt know. Nomad is getting a big nerf and blitz is getting changed as well
---
Stupid
---
Thanks to /u/dagandrek and /u/Milsurp_Seeker for the suggestion on the previous one I did lol
---
what‚Äôs happening to them?
---
The can easily adjust their mouse compared to using comparatively clumsy analog sticks?
---
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
---
That gun is so shitty
---
I guess but it seems shitty to make hip fire useable on pc but not on console 
---

the refresh rate depends on your monitor. monitors have different specifications i e 60hz, 120hz 144hz and so on. you cant switch in between say 80hz unless you have a g sync monitor. no you cant switch the bench map
---
Well dokkaebi is good help with her logic bomb plus you can take over the defender cameras. 
---
Ha art teachers are often pretty cool, but that probably would be pushing it a tad üòÇ

Pepe hands to me I got two charms

Yeah and one impact nade clears out a nice big chunk of her traps
---
Personally no, but it doesn't matter since I didn't personally create the salute
---
Think about this though, you could kill someone possibly by shooting an ash charge at the window
---
I would be so happy to pull this üò≠
---
You are then forcing people who WANT to play Ranked because the stigmata surrounding Casual because of fear they will be separated from their friends when they do get to play Ranked together. I personally don't think a change should force half the community's hand in what to play and when to play it out of fear that they'll be separated. I have seen first hand where a group of friends will have 2/3 really good players then a few other friends that come and go/play less often that fall behind. Having a shift between Plat to Silver is fairly common, especially with larger groups. Still don't see how splitting them/forcing them into Casual solves the problem in the best way possible.

fair enough

Except Mozzie has a mustache
---
Yeah, I mentioned that to a guy in one of the top comments, interesting stuff
---
Oh gotcha, Thanks 
---
I actually notice that. One that interests me is "Honey, Dinner's almost ready" But if you look out the window, it can't be later the around 4am from where the sun seems to sitting.
---
Oof
---
Yeah it does 
---
&gt;I personally don't think a change should force half the community's hand it what to play
---
Likewise, I don't think people wanting to play with their friends in a specific game mode should force the other half of the community to play unfair ranked games against people who are much higher skill level than them, leading to a shitty ranked experience and killing their desire to do better and rank up.
---
Nomads airjab is having passive noises added to it after it is armed, and Blitz‚Äôs changes are vague. You can read the patch notes over on /r/Rainbow6TTS
---
I think it's in your head man. Coding doesn't change. They just are able to lock faster before the hip fire spreads more 
---
I don‚Äôt know whether that‚Äôs a compliment orrrr lol
---
Do you have op ideas for all of them? I only see three on your profile
---
Idk, when I look at it, their resting hipfire spread is much tighter 
---
WAIT!!!
---
Yes I have ideas for each and every one of them but the three I have up there seem interesting to me 
---
Thanks a lot for these kind words :)
---
The picture is a P90 you scrap head
---
in my school, out honors math classes have an "emoji project" where u have to draw out emojis with formulas, this would be a perfect A assignment XD
---
Yes, it is saying they are all fuze mains
---
4 fucking pixels
---
Nice
---
They definitely can. They changed... Rook‚Äôs elite? I think. Changed his face or something and a lot of people didn‚Äôt like it, especially those with the elite. As far as I know I don‚Äôt think it was ever reverted 
---
But there‚Äôs still exploits that give you a very clear advantage. And I‚Äôm sure someone has managed, but decided to keep it secret so it wasn‚Äôt patched and they could continue to use it.
---
So is the one with the spear chain just an FBI scorpion he yells get over here and you fly towards him like you got hit by Nomads airjab
---
&gt; is this saying something about fuze mains?
---
They blow?
---
Some people don't want to play competitively, get stats, or be ranked. Or at least not all the time. That's what causal is for, introducing causal stats would defeat the purpose of having it.
---
Hello there!
---
i bought 4 packs and got all of the charms and smokes headgear
---
Ranked yesterday?
---
Also, how do you get that Maverick main thing
---
Are u using the mobile app?
---
vennu malesh reference
---
Main the P90. After using it so much, I've found that the most reliable tactic is to switch to your revolver and try to take them out with that.
---
Can you link the operator concepts to me?
---
Yeah
---
I wish there were thousands more like you
---
Gottem
---
You can *hack*, or at least not from what‚Äôs been blown up about it, but you can *exploit* to get a clear advantage.
---
......has enough time to make a post about incorrect saluting in a fucking game. Can‚Äôt even post something correctly. 
---
Lol. No. I need a nose protector 
---
Go to the r6 subreddit, the 3 dots in the top right, press change user flair

This was an assignment too. I got a 5/7 on this who roughly translates to 75%. There are people who used calculus along with modelling to find efficient ways to make logos, coins and other cool stuff.

Close app and start it again mine did the same. 
---
Vega 64 visual bug with operators is still not fixed.
---
I was reading something else at the same time I saw this and thought it said "Fucking Pony." The charm really should be called "Fucking Pony."
---
Last night I was playing as Maverick.  I made a torch hole in a soft wall, not expecting anyone around.  Valkyrie popped up out of nowhere, directly in the hole, and shot me in the face three times with the Deagle.  I killed her and walked away with 100 health.  Guess Nerf darts don't stick to Maverick, lol.  (PS-sorry Valkyrie, I'd be mad if I was you.)
---
He uses bose? Yeah cuz corsair pro voids are cheap but my bose cost over 200
---
wow, I feel like this is very complex (especially the outer diamond shaped lines) for a pre-calc student, but in calc, i'm not sure :)
---
And then not be able to help them out whenever they crash and get forced to use a terrible car? I have a friend who I play with a lot. He plays like a high gold or plat, but because he gets awful teammates, he‚Äôs stuck in copper. Then we squad up and we win almost every match. I would like to be able to help my friends and have something to show off at the end of the season for my efforts, but I usually get hurt because of my internet.
---
A Buck not killing himself with his own frag? Impossible!

Nice, but why dont you use the acog

\*POV of Bandit being headshot"
---
It‚Äôs Mr Octopus to you
---
It just bothers me that so many weapons have under 40 damage on defense yet so many attack weapons are 5 points away from 40 damage 
---
You‚Äôre just gonna have to deal with it and hope you don‚Äôt get TK‚Äôers. It sucks but there are always dicks in popular games. 
---
Also you aren‚Äôt the minority, everyone talks about how shitty TK‚Äôers make this game. 
---
RIP Vigil and Caveira lmao
---
I can see your point but me myself personally with the other two people I always play with haven‚Äôt had a problem I‚Äôm not saying everybody likes him. I have gotten out of dok/jackal lion traps by sensing that it‚Äôs going to happen. Usually the call or tracking comes first then I prepare to fight off my position. I ask for help since I  getting pinched. I‚Äôve died to the pinch maybe 2 times but teamwork is what is gonna get you through that. As for the defuser down situations there are many factors that are involved in that such as. Are they lit, how many are left, how many teammates do I have, where are they, rappelling, in the doorway, window, u could have the worst aim ever and still win with map sense. When he scans he has the cool down that‚Äôs your move time. You can‚Äôt take forever especially when defused is down. If you get spotted it‚Äôll be for a tiny amount of time and by then you are probably being droned or heard from moving into OBJ. I would say in conclusion map sense would most likely be your saving grace 
---
Yes it does. It also picks up defenders phones if they are looking at came or getting doki calls
---
"I showed you my Deception pls respond"
---
Fivesome it is then... 
---
I think it‚Äôs a balancing thing because the smgs are better in cqb so it gives an advantage to defenders in close quarters and the rifles are better for long range and they don‚Äôt want defenders to be able to take a lot of long range duels. At least that‚Äôs what I think 
---
Ok thanks!
---
Did it just get nerfed
---
Sam
---
Yeah I guess so 
---
Buck looks like he's doing is Captain America look from Infinity War impression.
---
Which server?
---
It picks up Vigil when his camera came gadget is active as well.
---
when she doesn‚Äôt send the feet pics
---
I think the separation of Germany was one of the reasons there was a second World War, excluding the other parts. 
---
To be honest I forgot Article 5 even exist.
---
Lol. 
---
Went under the corner of the shield?
---
The P90 is trash though. 
---
In less than a week I haven't killed this many spawn peekers since the Bandit and Jager bitch boy days.
---
these are actually pretty nice 
---
That's cool I didnt think of that!
---
For sure Maestro. Not that maverick is bad, but I feel Maestro is better. You can just play Hibana or Thermite if you want a hard breacher. Maestro is really powerful, plus I imagine maverick is gonna get a ton of nerfs in the future, and Maestro seems really balanced. 
---
Isn‚Äôt that the Ning‚Äôs title strat on strat roulette? 
---
Yes they do.
---
Consider it another personality trait of the operators. Such as, "There goes Smoke in his Fursona again..." 
---
Oh wow, isn't that what virgil's ability is all about? Counter electronic scanning
---
That's a lot of blue beary jam. 
---
Vigil* lol
---
Lol
---
*Teleports behind you*
---
Nani???
---
A siege youtuber called rogue nine did a video on this, I think the p90 was better at range? You'd have to check it out.
---
I just want the Shield skin, hope I can get it
---
Got this from my freebie pack, lol.  I think I gave up after 5 drones.
---
I saw that video but I don't remember the conclusion. I suppose I'll have to check it out again
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call clash OP. She‚Äôs annoying for sure, but unless the clash really knows what she‚Äôs doing, she‚Äôll be a mosquito at best. 
---
Maybe he‚Äôs just good?
---
You earned it!
---
np bro. they look like they could actually be in the game!
---
I love how people downvote for an honest mistake. Reddit is full of retards.

'Laughs in console'
---
I believe this is because a child can get R6 access throug console much easier than PC. ($300 vs $2000? No brainer) Those who actually own a decnt rig to play R6 smoothly on PC  much has a certain level of finance to afford it. Hence, you will meet more adult so to speak on PC. However, sometime adult or children kinda 2 face of the same coin when it comes to toxicity. But I believe the Pardon system (reflect damage system) will make your experience less miserable
---
Well actually the drones aren't ducks. They are cats 
---
the simpler designed ones like the sword hilt are fucking clean. ü§ô
---
Something tells me you might have predicted the future of R6...
---
You do have a point and I like the idea, but the voice lines are in English so they are understandable to every player.
---
Tbh, just don't change the character of Tachanka (Personality, backstory, and quotes). Then i'll be completely fine. 
---
Quote it. Not some obscure podcast. Not some forum comment. Quote the code or rule.
---
The Hori is licensed by Sony and works just fine on R6 as a m&amp;kb. If a licensed peripheral can do it, then a 3rd party one can too, unless you are so stupid you think 3rd party peripherals are against the terms or code.

---
You're not alone. I got this and the fucking butterfly charm. 
---
40 drones with most probably a 5r match is a bit much when everyone is hunting them , also plain ain't good for hunting droes since the spawns are so far away 
---
[removed]
---
Sorry for the horrible editing 
---
The thing is. I play on both platforms. But when you switch from one to another, you relize that "Oh shit, this is terrible"
---
I'd like to see North Korea get through our defences
---
I got stuck in it when I solo queued several seasons ago I‚Äôd drop 10+ kills every game and couldn‚Äôt get past silver 3 for the longest time. MMR system needs work. 
---
Probably because as a team they need to communicate with each other in a common language.
---
Very creative my friend. Great job on the colour and they actually look like real r6 ops. Props to you!!
---
I got on the free pack the monty gear and the 40 drones one I got bb's head bear
---
Ahhh, fair enough. My bad! My other point still stands.. 5hp, not he etc
---
I will make it legal 
---
That‚Äôs an oof
---
Just finished a bronze game I was 16 4 and one of the deaths was a team kill lol I feel bad for coppers and bronzes it‚Äôs all smurfs carrying vs smurfs carrying
---
But would you rather use the rainbow is magic skin with the rest of the set
---
This is some cursed image.
---
Discovery playlist be like
---
Alpha Pack. 
---
There are multiple cupcake charms 
---
These are all so cool. I could see all of these being really interesting operators 
---
make a custom lobby
---
Ya I‚Äôm stuck in gold rn but I tried playing on my friends plat 3 account and I got him to plat two with a win streak solo queuing with the same setting I have no idea why that is I think it‚Äôs just teammates honestly no one talks in gold or everyone is just trihard ping abusers
---
I like how they‚Äôre all kinda magical themed
---
It's console, they couldn't hit a barn wall from the inside with a Howitzer. I don't know how people play when they can't aim comfortably or control recoil, it looks so bad I can only imagine how it feels.

If by red belt you mean the shotgun shells I have one lying in my basement but I have absolutely no idea where I got it, you might have to make it or go authentic for that one. Try a gun shop or look online, I don't imagine it's something people would recreate for cosplay, and yes the one in my basement is red.

My free pack had the skin for Montaigne‚Äôs shield, so I don‚Äôt really want anything else. But it feels like a real waste to not get the second free pack, so drone hunting I go...
---
Beaten to death
---
i applied it on a couple of guns purely for irony lol
---
only thing im jealous of is a shotgun hit not downing someone
---
They look cool i'm looking forward to the names and special abilities. 
---
I'm jealous.
---
Oh I'm not on reddit all that much I just had a friend tell me to put it here cause he thought it was funny.
---
Our one and only god! PREIS THE OCTOPUS!
---
Understandable.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact you‚Äôre late by 2 months

Had the same problem, for me it was my CPU fan that was dying slowly ....so the cpu got to hot and clocked it self down so it wouldn‚Äôt sustain damage

I like the look of that, out of my free pack I got the paw charm, then my challenge pack I got the butterfly. I don't think I've ever been more unlucky in a video game
---
i forgot why it exists
---
Or they improved it? Idk, what words did you try/see?
---
It's a LoL meme cosplay. It's called Battle Bunny Draven and it has been around for quite a lot iirc
---
nah that‚Äôs not true. they don‚Äôt do pro league on console, but there are esl events
---
Oh jesus I better get a skin since I got this first
---
yeah they deleted it lol, didn‚Äôt know i couldn‚Äôt do it
---
Do you honestly think they're going to do anything about that when they don't even fucking ban the people cheating in ranked unless you're a high view count streamer or pro league player?
---
Hes only good with a coordinated team to push in while the drone is scanning.
---
I love the one with the 8 ball!!
---
Planning on getting R6? We can play.
---
Its not hit reg its desync that is the problem
---
Tested just alot of slurs in rain ow is magic after seeing that someone spammed n word, everything that gave redtext just passes through 
---
This was my first black ice too, pretty disappointed since I don‚Äôt play as the lord and if I do I play SASG
---
I got the tachanka helmet, nice charm though!
---
These look amazing! They are also some cool ideas for new ops

Pretty sure it's like black ice, where any handgun up to skull Rain has it, but not after.

I have some decent experience with server stuff, so I know how (at least at a moderate level) how hitreg and desync work. I just feel like it's been a lot worse this season, and maybe the camera changes don't help much. :/

I‚Äôm lvl 150 and I have 8 I think
---
I want that but all I got was glitter rainbow whatever for tachanka and blackbeard gay ass princess haircut 
---
Showed you my dick, please respond.

still, there is no reason she should have that ability. Sometimes (rarely) that will win you rounds and there is no reason it should be able to.
---
Gridlocks and nomad traps aren't realistic but as I've said before I don't really care about realism. I care much more about balance.

I totally forgot about Cav constantly using Portuguese for interrogation voice lines lmao

üëã üåä

I got this in the pack????
---
Camouflage motherfucker
---
Been on attack first round so many times. 20ish games in think I'm finally on the home stretch of 26/40 
---
this happens a lot, for every player. and always surprise that game has pro players.
---
i wouldn't keep play seriously on this game.
---
They need to come up with new challenge ideas. How about something like: "Get 2 kills with with 4 different Operators" ? Totally doable and encourages you to play different ops. (and you can still choose who ever you like to play)
---
More drones for you ü¶Ñüåàü•≥
---
Morocco
---
Y = mx+b amirite!
---
Virus would be cool considering there are more defender gadgets than attacker drones. Mozzie is just annoying area denial like a better mute.
---
Iris reminds of beach boys.
---
Remedy sounds like sawbones from dirty bomb.
---
Good catch comrade 
---
These are simple astounding.
---
Glad to see actual vigil art rather than just a blank screen
---
That spider icon makes me think of an attacker who‚Äôs drones can cling on walls and ceilings.
---
nice drawing
---
 thank you very much
---
Fuck shields
---
I swear it was there yesterday 
---
Thank Goodness. Feature added nothing to the game.
---
Same!

Lion : am i a joke to you ?

Go to the main page and click on [‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢] at the top.

Uncrouched and the knife hits the center of the screen at whatever time in the knife swipe that I'm not sure of. So the hit box was above her head. 
---
Go to r/Rainbow6 and select user flair.

I fucking love you so much no homo

It's small and stuff.

When I'm freaking out I like to have only one button in the screen.

Care to explain? Cause you lose all the advantages brought by the mira by doing that.

Kevin?

duhhh
---
At first sight, I read it as "lolize".
---
-6.9% recoil 
---
Very nice!
---
I understand  the itch all to well bro. Instead however, I usually supress that itch just by standing and crouching in one spot repeatedly as I simultaneously spin around in circles while pointing up and adding in the occasional jump (especially when I'm feeling real itchy about shooting cameras in public).
---
So did I - I really wanted the Monty shield (even tho I don't play Monty, but it looks awesome) and got myself the darn Chanka-rainbow charm
---
Depends on playstyle.
---
I raise you one better.
---
The set that I wear.
---
The lumberjack body, with the beret headgear.

It's so fucking cursed but it's perfect.

No. Kids room is a "wallpaper" around the map

But mozzie is a redhead

Possibly ginger can't tell with the helmet

I'll drop you an add when I get on sometime today.

Mom said it's my turn on the evil eye

His gun just feels whack (imo). But Hibana‚Äôs is worse so I always pick Thermite if we need a hard breacher. 
---
Disagree, but not because he's OP, but because I'm trash and panic like fuck when he runs at me.
---
Even though this new game mode is pretty funny if you play few times, this challenge technically forces you to play WAY more than few games. And it's getting annoying if we include full high rank teams, trolls and this fucking consistent leaving. 
---
I have a lot more to teach.
---
EDD deployed... let them cum
---
I play console and I can accidentally damage people and they'll be chill and vice versa. I also talk in game with my mic a lot and people usually like me and as for squeakers, I've encountered like 4 over my 2 years of playing. Sometimes you get toxic cunts who tk for petty ass reasons but that is the type of person, not the type of gaming device. 
---
They are too scary. China doesn't approve. 
---
Not alone. I haven't found a ranked game in 2 days on PC. Had to play on Xbox. 
---
Famn lol do you know how long its had been gone
---
It doesn't really require good editing to get the point across
---
Thank god for Removeddit
---
Yeah the Flash Hider for the 11 is way better
---
I think she's cool and fun to use but balanced? I rarely see her played at all
---
For the Shotgun? All shotguns have that crosshair
---
Said the Vigil main.
---
Feel like I've actually been playing well lately, to absolutely no avail. The joys of solo queue. 
---
The Hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
i meant by something similar, not the exact same bruh, fortnite got ranted because they said theyre gon add the respawn thing from apex. 
---
Tip for next time, you should have melee twice in both maps and made it so the cut is exactly in the middle of the melee and it looks like it's the same animation 
---
Not a sledge main, but I'm Scottish üòÇüòÇ
---
Johnny Walker is Scotch dude
---
I dont get what you mean?
---
You already bought the credits, you only have a few spare

renown is like free money, but is needed, if you spend bought, spare credits on some money you otherwise got for free

it doesnt taje any money fron their pockets?
---
True XD

!: repost :!

Kewl app üëç
---
Yeah I get that, for me I get mad because I couldn't do anything about it. A mistake is just that imo, shouldn't have happened but did, learn, move on but with lag/desync/hitreg I can't do anything so have to lose that game or round because a computer had a brainfart.
---
Very abstract, I like it
---
Nope the nerf didn‚Äôt hurt the MP5 that much 
---
Thank you for the rating! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
---
I thought it said "Hitler and Siege 1"
---
Hope you like it :) 
---
He‚Äôs one of the strongest attackers in the game he‚Äôs fine 
---
You can buy operators with R6 credits already. With your suggestion, Alpha Packs become a lot more accessible. More money = more R6 credits = more Renown = more Alpha Packs = more Legendaries.
---
If there's no grind, where's the value? 
---
It's got me a promotion 
---
i know its too early but why do the ideas always sound so OP \^\^ hyped anyways :D
---
on ps4 sure 
---
Why did you tk
---
5 rounds do. This is either fake or an edit.

How much do you get per game

That's some viable tactic. Gotta try it someday

Furry costume + dance

Every ranked player that's all aim no brain plays Doc for the acog, so unless you want to get shit on everygame by an aimbro I would be okay with them leaving it as it is.

Bottom left runs around the map collecting the triforce and the sword that seals the darkness before using its power to finally nerf Lion and seal him in the depths of hell?

Bro I recommend you to like recommend some of these to ubisoft. I would main any of these exlusively thanks to their icon. Granted they never respond, but it is worth a try.

Extra reason to be a decent human and not play blitz

Hello IZuccYourData, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b9qwq3/since_update_ive_been_getting_increased_cpu_usage/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It‚Äôs pretty unlikely that they would make the ops from different ctus
---
How so?
---
The dark blue indigo ish ones like the sword one with wings are the most realistic in the game already looking icons i'd say.
---
And my sledgehammer!
---
Thanks for the nightmare fuel
---
Mmm i suggest of course to begin with 1080p (fullhd) gaming at 144hz, in 2019 still playing at 60fps on shooters is horrendous. 
---
So i guess a good gtx 1070 is pretty good for 1080p 144hz gaming. A good i5 9 series or even a good ryzen as CPU, but I always prefer Intel cpus cause they are better optimized for games. What else, 16gb of ram at least at 3000 mhz, hard disk for putting your shit u never see or games who dont need quick loadings, a ssd to put games u always play to get into them quicker. As power supply even a 600-650w (I have a i7 6700k at 4.6ghz and a 1080ti and I still have my old 650w). Then as motherboard go for a good msi, gigabyte or Asus, don't spend that much money on motherboard, at this point spend more for essentials components like GPU and CPU, anyway when u go buy on Amazon and u are looking for a processor or whatever, it reccomend u a good motherboard for that.
---
I think I said all, the case, just buy whatever u like (of course the case needs to be big enough to put every component in it, watch out for that).
---
Oh of course a 144hz 1ms monitor.
---
These are all really good! I like trying to think of ops in my free time so I like seeing a lot of the fan ops! I think though that the jester icon would look better and probably fit more with the others if you removed the "Ha"s and made the jester face larger and more central, but that's just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt! 
---
I read in the comments that his grenade goes off three times with different effects each time so if that's what you were going for with the three "Ha"s then maybe you could make the three tips of his hat differently shaped to represent each kind of grenade?

But he's not wrong lmao
---
That‚Äôs the one they gave me for free lol
---
Well, he IS a Castle main...
---
That laughter is infectious. I love it.
---
It‚Äôs fine for me because we have new recoil anyway
---
Whatever he posted was against the rules and not relevant to R6 in any way. We have Rule #1 for that. 
---
I swapped on House back in Year One. Kids bed to Garage. Opposition were so meticulous and charged in with 30 seconds to go. Ofcourse, garage was empty haha. Classic patter.

Literally the 4 people below him are coppers and silvers lmao

Shit dude you can buy these replica helmets on Amazon for 200 bucks, just look it up

not op, but Maverick. Nomad is great, but her gun is so bad that I just can‚Äôt use her,

maybe that‚Äôs just me. Maverick has an extremely influential gadget, and a solid gun.

Great Wilhelm scream at 1:12

What rank was this. There‚Äôs no way that actually workedüòÇ I watched the whole thing and still can‚Äôt believe it 
---
You only aced once in a year?? I also started about a year ago and I have managed 8 aces, although somehow I managed to get most of them on Operators (bar having 3 on Cav, my most played operator in game) I decide to play just because I hadn't touched them in a long while.
---
Isn‚Äôt he South Korean?
---
He might be using mouse and keyboard
---
Why is the sens so low?
---
He‚Äôs using a mouse and key board you can‚Äôt lean on controller without aiming 
---
MnK doesnt allow that either
---
I always tought that it is diabled on console
---
Yea he's using a mouse in keyboard on PS4 which is bannable
---
It's not mouse and keyboard, it's a spectator bug. Using a XIM on ps4 doesn't give you leaning without ads, as that feature isn't built in on console.
---
he is from north korea,then he fled to south korea
---
It does. 
---
That's because of gravity...
---
These are awesome, thanks for sharing!
---
3440x1440 versions of these wallpapers would look incredible. I have an ultrawide and would love to set all the wallpapers on loop (have the current ones on loop on my laptop and they look great).
---
If you ever do decide to do it, it would be amazing!
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs on till the fifteenth but someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
My mate was pressured into doing all recruit on 3-0, then we lost 3-5. 
---
He will never play recruit ever again.
---
I feel that this strat would work better on kafe for the sole reason of there being no drones that start on 3rd floor, one starts on second but it has two sites to drone out, by the time that second floor drone moves upstairs the other four drones would report sing of people down stairs.
---
I like the idea but I feel like the majority of players use only one or two setups. Also I think it would add a lot of storage space to the game 
---
Crouching spamming to each is high fiving 
---
No please! I have kids!
---
also looked at your history, stop being a troll.You know, being nice also feels  good 
---
I get that, but why would you put yourself at an important disadvantage for no reason.
---
Thermite is ma boi. I have over 3 days on him :)
---
Is there anyway for mobiles phones (I have an iPhone XR) to make the gradient fit the size of an iPhone otherwise it looks kinda dull-ish
---
I need R6 stands now
---
I might do that later lol
---
yeah maybe this one charm hasn‚Äôt been posted here but it happens hundreds of times a day. people whine about free cosmetics. like you are here. it‚Äôs annoying 
---
Have done this to a buddy during a regular game, only the rest of the walls were also reinforced. 
---
But, he had a Mira, so was fine, and hilarious. 
---
50 nic
---
Why yes, yes it is lol
---
used to main him them i converted to the buck lifestyle
---
I believe it is here for the week following April fools day. Should end sometime Saturday or Sunday (April 6th or 7th).

be grateful you get anything because Ubisoft didn‚Äôt have to do the alpha packs. quit getting upset over something so insignificant 
---
Ouch! Hitting close to home there üòâ
---
Sir what about the Ying rework? Is Ying getting nerfed? 
---
True, he would pretty much make every smoke/flash and abilities like yings and blitz's useless
---
Gender reassignment. Be considerate

Yeh i think it's patched

Yeah, cause most of the time they team kill you or vote you out so it's wise to to go with the flow

love it how the enemy runs in and is 1 ft from him( pulls out pistol) enemy down the hall (pulls out shotgun) ..... god damn man is Jason Bourne...
---
Reinforcing that wall allows attackers to easily take control of that closet, where they can then take out anyone trying to play in obj, where they will then win the round. Much better left soft/open.
---
PC faggot. Get a life you fucking cocksucker 
---
Could be, but most likely lower settings and lower res for more fps(for the hell of it).
---
it's until the 8th, but the packs are available until the 15th
---
‚ÄúAnd do what?!‚Äù
---
epic
---
I've seen a draw twice in 4 years.
---
What
---
^ That
---
From someone with about 600hr into the game I can say that you should get Zofia, buck, and twitch. Zofia's gun is really good one of the best on attk and her gadget is one of the best it's similar to ash with an extra gift of a concussion. Buck is like sledge and his had a lot of recoil but it does a lot of damage. Twitch is good but her gadget is situational but her gun the F2 is really good. 
---
Try being me I would have been plat already but I got the smallest number and have to drop so my team can get easy games. Everyone is plat 2 but I‚Äôm sitting in silver 3 waiting till next season and someone else can be leader.
---
He was my first elite :,)
---
*melee*
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm against ACOGs in general on defense. In a realistic situation why would you need a scope in close quarters? It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. That one attachment is the only thing keeping these 2 guns from being balanced in terms of pick rate and gameplay, since people don‚Äôt want the P90 buffed bc it‚Äôd be too OP with an ACOG. This is also the reason the MP5 had a damage nerf, so it would be more difficult to kill people at range with body shots. Make both guns more powerful and remove the ACOGs.
---
So there gonna be an opperater with a fuckin sword

i think it's your aspect ratio lol
---
Bruh I know his name is Hunter in English but just call him J√§ger, you'll probably confuse some people 
---
Where is that map
---
That sounds about how everyone on plat elo plays that room, with slightly different ops. Some of your ops are wildcards, as only j√§ger, mira and mute are essential. Lesion is awesome for intel, but can be replaced by kapkan or smoke.
---
Kapkan is a bit less effective by visiblity and number of trap, more effective by damage and weapon and Smoke needs to be very active at holdng off enemies with prefire and smokes if neccessary.
---
Pulse can be replaced by valkyrie, mozzie or vigil. Valk and mozzie play simmilarly with their cams, while mozzie has better weaponry, valk can eat one more bullet and can place her cams better. Vigil requires the most gamesense because you can only rely on audio, callouts or murderholes for intel.
---
I was actually hoping for a vid showcasing it in action in a montage or sthm. of a few rounds of scrims or ranked.

well C9 won‚Äôt be called for being a team of coppers anymore
---
Well source is made by literal gods and wasn't made with open world games in mind like anvilnext was, also Unreal is known for having really bad performance.
---
AnvilNext was designed with open worlds in mind as it was originally for assassins creed games so the reflections were less of importance on it rather than culling and micro optimizations.
---
Source was made for shooter games, it has an ancient method of handling what gets rendered or not by breaking maps into rooms and rendering the room you're in and the rooms that are visible to you, CSGOs battle royals map is really small because of this. Since they can't really break that map into rooms the whole map gets drawn out entirely no matter where you're at, but because of the way it handles it it performance is amazing and can handle better reflections

Dude can you shut the fuck up, and stop calling other people‚Äôs mains bad you toxic dick, i saw you spamming that,‚Äù thatcher is bad‚Äù or ‚Äúglaz is bad‚Äù (which i take a offense to because i‚Äôm a glaz main) just because you‚Äôre trash with those ops doesnt mean others aren‚Äôt

I will

Yup, 80% of the time, bank works every time

Fuck off. Favela is alot of fun.

1000hrs of playtime here. Still have plenty of fun, yup the game has some issues, certainly. (some are bad) but.. well if you're not having fun, stop playing.

 ^Mature individual ahead^

Yeah, totally.

Like, you have your happy Mr Bear enjoying his life, and suddenly, he starts to emit muffled screams and all.

Laughs in short

I know it sucks,don't have to downvote me for it tho smh
---
i dont mean to be THAT GUY but up your sens, man. that is way too slow to control recoil, and also try using 70-83 sens in ads (83 is essentially hip sensitivity but adsing)
---
I don‚Äôt really have anything else to play but cod zombies and that gets boring after a while.I have a really depressing life when I‚Äôm not playing anything so I choose to play this game because there‚Äôs not really any other option.

Those first 8 100% apply to at least half of the players I‚Äôve seen in high gold low plat.

cool...

That is the exact reason I use reflex.

If I see this fucking chart on this subbreddit one more time I'm actually gonna bash someone's skull in
---
He bought it when it was available.

Nobody has said house

WHAT?! FUN IN SIEGE?! MADNESS!!

I didn't expect this high tier meme here

Darn I‚Äôve gotten black ice for his shotgun twice

Skyscraper and border to spot those cheeky Valk cams right?

I coylnt find the Frost main so I did the hibana one
---
Go go power rangers
---
1v22!
---
I use this sometimes because for me I get more kills pre-firing up than to the side. It works, you just have to be quick to kill them before they shoot out your feet. 
---
That doesn't help but you do have a point. 
---
yeah, I don‚Äôt even mind unrealistic gadgets so long as it‚Äôs for the sake of good gameplay, but lion, dokk and all that bullshit doesn‚Äôt fit the tone of the game and we don‚Äôt even get fun or competitive gameplay from it. 
---
Oh it used to be higher but I was so terrible coming back to this game I had to knock it down to default it work my way back up lol
---
Laughs in Ar-33 Sights
---
That's a small change, not a rework
---
They gonna rework her next season or maybe 3rd season
---
too op nerf
---
Just give me the BF3 EOD bot and we're good.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Let‚Äôs bust a fat nut on this
---
Yes, but not telling. 
---
Did something similar where we locked tachanka in the same area. Fully reinforced
---
A. This is a waste of everyone's time. No one cares that you're quitting.
---
B. If you're quitting, just quit. Don't make a rage quit post expecting karma.
---
C. Ubi is fixing problems only to have 2 more come up. Like a Hydra. Be patient.
---
Take a break from the game instead of blaming YOUR fuck ups and mistakes on other people. 
---
i did a 5 stack recently in Ranked. we were all round Gold. we took normal operators, lost 2 matches. both were 4-0 i think. then we thought what was the point of being tactical because we were going to lose anyway, so we all went recruit and won 4 matches including a couple of 5-4 wins. this game makes no sense sometimes.
---
This is literally the only reason I want this skin.  It pisses off so many people and it's funny every time.
---
There's an ever so slight different mindset between the different platforms from my experience (went from playing console for a year before I changed and continued progress on PC). Due to a lack of communication on console compared to pc, these things can be done with ease. I'm not saying that PC players are smarter, there are plenty of factors that play into making a strat like this work on any platform 
---
Maybe don‚Äôt be an idiot and say that in chat...
---

Don‚Äôt do that. Pro tip.

From a casual standpoint, both maps are amazing:)

No you probably won‚Äôt get banned but might if you keep saying repeatedly
---
I‚Äôm fine with it I have nothing to spend renown on
---
I just main iq
---
It didn't go downhill. Maybe in your eyes it did, but it's R6 as far as I am concerned. I wish they'd upgrade some stuff to make the game better, but it hasn't really gone downhill at all, it's the same basic game it was in Wind bastion with some very minor changes and 2 new ops. 
---
I'm just as tall as mozzie

I'll make note of that next time I make my season 2 operators

Read the rules man. NO SELF PROMOTION!
---
Oh and for people who like playing defend on T HUNT and get this map, the C4 on the window is a fun way to delay them from entering
---
Saying shoot them is same thing as saying stand still when there is a lion. Its not always that easy especially if have two people peeking you 
---
Where, we‚Äôre, tomato, tomato, potato, potato, who cares you know what I mean
---
Lmao what? I see Clash like one round once every 20 matches.
---
Small operation like this, you'll have that.
---
That / means or
---
:(
---
Alright, the reason you don't get why Lion needed changes is that the game plays a lot differently on PC versus the consoles. People on PC generally move and aim a lot faster and more accurately/consistently than on console and the few seconds that Lion forces players to stand in place for can be completely devastating.
---
If he TKed within the first 45 seconds of a round, he would have been kicked, but because it was later in the round it didn't count.
---
This is why the game needs a system where it pulls the whole lobby out of a guy leaves or disconnects and doesn‚Äôt penalize anybody and it‚Äôs fair to both teams 
---
That's cause the event takes place in Kids Room, ya silly billy. The first time I heard the mom talk in the background, I thought it was my teammate getting scolded. 
---
Also the PA announcements kill me. "This is a non-smoking flight. Sorry smoke ;)" and "what we thought was turbulence was actually just Nomad's airjab"
---
Where, we‚Äôre, tomato, tomato, potato, potato, who really cares. You know what I mean
---
Hello VikingZMH, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b9vy2m/cav_mains/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
on defense, you get 416-c or mp7, both of them are god tier guns with really easy recoil. 416 has a blocky iron sight but the thing shreds anyway.
---
50 @ 500 is wicked fast. Like 6-7cm/360.  
---
I use an INI edit to give me 2.5 @ 1600 for a 36cm/360. To compare with a closer DPI to yours, 10 @ 400.
---
I agree
---
That's basically a critical hit with words
---
Thanks great response 
---
The rule doesn't say no self promotion. It says those who self promote should also be strong members of the community and no more than 10% of your contributions should be self promotion.
---
With that being clarified, this is OP's only contribution to the sub, so yeah he's still breaking the rule.
---
I mean it would be worth it because the community is 10x better but you can‚Äôt connect accounts 
---
The funny shit is when you bring a head breacher, they don‚Äôt reinforce much of SHIT! üòÇ ü§£ü§£ü§£

Overwatch already has that exact system but it just baffles me how Ubisoft hasn‚Äôt implemented something like this yet.
---
Top 10 photos taken before disasters
---
And the Macie one on Lesion. Watch and enjoy both of them. Probably adding Shrouds to the collection when my Amazon Prime resets tomorrow.
---
I always take the mp7 xD the best iron sights in the game and i'm also bandit main :D
---
Unfortunately, he didn't get the sponsorship ;D
---
Thank you!
---
why ?
---
This is Mother Russia 
---
Most of them are good about following tactics but also just play who they want instead of who we need. But a couple of them are incredibly bad shots. No worries bro

wtf it is my fault that the game is unplayable on high elo ?!

Can u tell me ur acc also i am quite nooby if I'm not really in the zone so i will not mind sorry for late reply 
---
Video games are not real life

You have the burden of proof. Saying ‚Äúgo look for yourself‚Äù just hurts your already bad argument.

Hey at least you‚Äôve gotten black ice- 400 hours and not a single one lmao

I mean there are videos online of prototype stealth technology. Just do a quick google search. It‚Äôs there.
---
OCD kicks in when you didnt shoot all the petals lol
---
That‚Äôs not the proof I‚Äôm talking about but ok
---
It‚Äôs not the original image, it‚Äôs an edit that‚Äôs supposed to be a joke.  Do you expect people to give the source every time they post a meme?  I mean if he knew who drew it beforehand yeah it might have been nice to put his name on it.  But he didn‚Äôt, and you‚Äôre just being an insufferable asshat.
---
Technically it‚Äôs a 4k but great job
---
Refresh or restart the game same thing happens to everyone.
---
Restart game lol
---
Thank you! &amp; I used adobe premiere  
---
*cries in Ying*
---
PUT THE ACOGS IN THE BAG!
---
Ok thanks
---
restart game and if that doesn‚Äôt work hold power button on xbox and turn back on
---
Bombers are made to force you to practice headshots. You don't realize it since it takes two or three bullets to make a headshot on one(Based on your gun). They honestly are good fun if you are playing slow enough 
---
nice
---
I like the bombers:)
---
Also based on your logic we should get rid of all of T-hunt since that will "never be in multiplayer"
---
Ironically the M870 is American and the M1014 is Italian (and just for fun the AA12 is American in origin). 
---
Get a last person for your clan and you won‚Äôt have the problem
---
Oh, no argument so insults? Okay I see the level here and I won't say anything else. If you don't see where the problem is, then that's the actual problem. 
---
Btw the name of the artist is on the picture but yeah, crediting is super hard, man, every reposter will tell you. 
---
Yet somehow I get ranked with a Recruit who teamkills me for picking up the hostage
---
this doesn't really make sense though, because defense is just trying to keep the objective un-tampered-with for long enough, so logically, even if everyone dies, they still win, right? at least outside of hostage mode, that is. Then a draw makes sense.
---
Fuck blitzüòÇ
---
You can choose the game mode tho
---
And then get kicked when you don‚Äôt win it
---
Makes sense as it‚Äôs always in the middle of the screen 
---
How ? :)
---
You need to buy the game through uPlay or Steam. This is because the game is not cross compatible or a Microsoft exclusive.
---
They should keep the N word ban, the only people who actually say it are "edgy" kids anyways. Just knowing how much it would frustrate them brings me joy
---
Siege logic dictates that if all operators are dead everyone wins, kinda.
---
The point of a headshot is for it to be a one shot kill no matter the situation
---
What if I call my gay friend a fag for some dumbass shit he did? 
---
Not all games on the microsoft store are for pc, to play R6 on pc you need to buy another copy on steam or uplay.
---
The friends got beat by the mean meanies!
---
I agree but that includes recoil control into the mix so you don't just spray and pray 
---
This literally happened to me yesterday. My tm jumped through a window and got Frost mat'd, I follow him through the same window and fall on a SECOND mat. 
---
How did that happen, we were smarter than that
---
Yeah she's definitely not super easy to use
---
Yo this is awesome 
---
Is it a shotgun rush if I‚Äôm just standing my ground against 4 idiots 
---
Yeah, again, not trying to attack. Thanks for the kind conversation!
---
Leak was fake 
---
Yes.
---
Been seeing this a lot lately, shield operators are basically unplayable atm. 
---
i have never fallen out of a seat laughing before. thank you. 
---
Watch Twitch streams. Entertaining and you‚Äôre able to learn something. I guess you could watch YouTube videos dedicated to teaching callouts but that would personally put me to sleep.
---
yeah it¬¥s really annoying because i love monty 
---
It doesnt. 
---
Thanks
---
wat
---
I swear that twitch had a recoil macro going on there? Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
You mean lord taCHADka?  /s
---
Shhhh
---
He‚Äôs looking two different directions 
---
Lmao that sucks i am one of those guys that buys all the event packs because im not good with money...
---
This is so mean
---
Honestly I think it all depends on your mindset. To me it would be annoying, but accidents happen and sometimes people just wanna win the round and get on to the next one.
---
__i'd be insulted that you assumed i was dumb enough to argue against how reality provably works, but this is the internet and there are people who think like that, so fair enough i guess.__
---
Ok I guess I see where you‚Äôre coming from.  Completely disagree, but at least I know your perspective.  I stand by my previous statement since your mentality is exactly what‚Äôs fucking up youtube.  As long as you‚Äôre not trying to claim credit or make money off of people work I think it‚Äôs all fair use.  But you and I clearly run in different internet circles.
---
Also fuck off with the ‚Äúyou insulted me‚Äù  moral high ground garbage.  You came out swinging with your TURBOLOL comment so I just assumed we were just gonna be talking shit to each other.
---
Hibana, couldn't control recoil earlier really, so never bothered. About 300 hours later I tried again and goddamn is she deadly. Angled grip, flash hider and ACOG. Mrr
---
I would think nothing of it because I play the characters for utilities not their race
---
Nice watermark and cropping 
---
I feel drone skins could be more problematic than barricade skins just because they could blend in/hide better if they're the right colour. Drone skins would be more fun though.
---
The random vote kick thing is super irritating, but I generally don't get tk'd unless I do something EXTRA stupid, or it's an accident. I very rarely get 100% toxic tk'd
---
The title is r/ihadastroke material
---
Will there be a fat woman operator that can complete the body size joke?
---
Ok does recruit has his tongue out of his mouth open? 
---
**wat**
---
Thank you! Would you recommend any streamers?
---
As long as one team gets 5 (and both get to 4) the one who gets to round 5 wins. Therefore it can't be drawn.
---
Thank you
---
Git gud
---
Bit really yellimg but uh, yeah no problem ig lol
---
Thank you so much üòñüòñüòñ

Stop playing Wood 4s, "playing a dead body" you literally got spotted on cam at the beginning of the clip so any common sense team would still see the Blitz logo on their UI

Is that nomad in the top right corner?
---
Also great wallpaper!
---
Used subway coupon ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to finish that challenge.. I‚Äôm not amazing at the game and finished it in like 4 hours. 
---
Also think about it. Kaid, clash, nomad, possibly gridlock, the new ops, all nerfed, because people didn‚Äôt want to adapt. 
---
Makes it even harder when someone steals Bandit in like 2 seconds so rip using the barbed wire and bandit combo for destroying drones.
---
yea this is why I hate these challenges because people will be toxic just because. I had to grind all day on the first day to complete the challenge 
---
No cross platform.
---
Love this. Give me more silliness.

You do realise what you get if you complete it right?

I'm gonna keep going, I guess. Just... Very frustrating.
---
do you really think this is reddit worthy
---
Its easier to run around with a russian shotty
---
Hahaha thank you thank you
---
Alright that's fine
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs not a challenge. It‚Äôs just fucking annoying. I want a challenge to get the prize, not complete a chore.
---
Contact ubi then I guess?
---
It‚Äôs not hard, just extremely tedious
---
No. Absolutely not.
---
But I do like to think to myself it being only a slight bit above all the reposts and memes.
---
Lol IQ needs better guns lol
---
2 great guns, great gadget, great utility with smokes and a secondary shotty. What are you missing?
---

So creative, I absolutely love your ideas! Keep up the great work!
---
Fuck
---
Why don‚Äôt you ask the people that are in your actual game instead of dudes on Reddit?
---
Thank you very much mate you have a nice day 
---
What's off? Too low?
---
Skilled operator
---
I thought max was 140%?
---
Nothing better than seeing that one retard that's diamond that literally has no brain and has the name "keyboard smurf" and forgets how to do anything beyond "point and shoot." Yeah guys, that's the guy we should be promoting. Because this game is Call of Duty and using a mouse and keyboard is just "using your resources to your maximum potential" even though it shouldn't be possible and is considered cheating. 
---
How do people defend this stupid shit. As someone who plays on both platforms, I can easily say that if I were to buy a XIM and use mouse and keyboard on console I can almost guarantee I would hit diamond by the end of this month.
---
This is a game where any gun does less damage then a single knife or a hit from a shield. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time to question realism. 
---
Do you have a source for this? And is the change pretty much 100% coming? 
---
Thatcher doesn‚Äôt suck, but you might be utter trash with him and that could be swaying your opinion.

Didn't know about it being posted on another R6 Reddit, I saw it on twitter and found it funny.

I had a friend try M&amp;KB, and he went from Gold 4 to Plat 2 in 2 weeks. But he started running into lobbies with nothing but M&amp;KB users
---
No I know. But i think it would be pretty cool. Plus its annoying when a Thatcher can throw one thing and break all of your needles I pretty good balancing as well
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that. Similar to most other often played ops like Hibana, Jackal, Zofia etc. Difference is she‚Äôs slow and has a gadget that is only strong with the coverage it has, not because the trax themselves are actually good
---
I‚Äôve got black ice for his shotgun and smg. To bad I‚Äôm trash with him and prefer buck
