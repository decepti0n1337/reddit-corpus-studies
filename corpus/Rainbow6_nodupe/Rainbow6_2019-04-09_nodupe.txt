Nice of them to extend the part nobody cares about but not the part that lets people get what they want.
---
---
---
Lol
---
How did it take you nearly a thousand hours to only be level 150?
---
nice repost
---
Well cause It is kind of about gameplay
---
Mentlegen
---
I R O N I C AF
---
I've got 1120 something and im level 160, seems about on to me
---
Um nope. I just meet people from china. Most of them are fairly non-toxic.
---
No need to be rude, just want to report what seems to me like a bug. I got hit in the head above the shield by the enemy, but on the killcam it broke my shield and killed me instantly. Maybe it's a TIL, but I want to be sure.
---
I don't know but I can definitely send you my steam profile hours as proof that it took that long
---
You carried the team. World's fastest round?
---
What happened to her pelvis?
---
Crazy, I‚Äôm level 93 and only have 150 hours in, I guess that it plateaus.
---
I played a lot of T Hunts I guess? When I was pissed off at multiplayer but still wanted credits for the ops I would farm t hunts for hours
---
But he's not wrong
---
Yeah it's something like that, but even 150 sounds too small to be that high.
---
Cluster charge ready!
---
Give him an r4-c with an acog and Blackbeard shield
---
A better April fool's event would have been to bring back old Hereford, and delete all operators except for Recruit. Then make it all disappear the next day.
---
I'm out walking my dog right now but after that I'll post my hours to my profile is proof
---
Sledge would just pull his hammer out of his ass and send Thatcher to the shadow realm.

Raptor leg glitch :/

Haha I would have just crawled in and joined you

1 hostage and 4 teammates?

More proof you can't counter mav

Remove Acog, but his head hitbox is small

---
*Now is balanced*
---
The lord isn't involved, and Blitz sends his regards.
---
Task failed successfully
---
Her legs are turned
---
I would have saw you and just crawled in and joined you
---
I don‚Äôt think there is on Pc, but on console you can get a hardcopy.
---
Her natural hair color is dark brown so maybe we'd get that in her elite that wont come out for years because ubisoft hates her. I know this because of her bio on the ubisoft site theres a photo of her when shes young. Also because zofia has that color but anyways
---
Take notes REEEEEE
---
I play on console, so I use the Ubisoft website and I guess that they only track operator play time and not any other screen time, so it‚Äôs higher than that but I don‚Äôt know by how much.
---
Isn‚Äôt one
---
I‚Äôm not sure there is a max level?
---
Fucking updoots
---
Ubisoft's website is complete garbage for stat tracking. If you look at your accuracy it'll show something over 100%
---
I thought I was good at bandi but I guess not.
---
yeah I don‚Äôt like it but me and my friends do a Fuze/Finka/Blitz/Spetznaz Recruit rush
---
Suck my oui oui
---
1:02-1:20
---
Twitch is already 4 speed 4 armor
---
there are some poeple who want cosplay to be EXACT, but youre right. thank you so much
---
[removed]
---
I think you need to get back to the game and carry us some more. Lol
---
Black ice for all would be dope.
---
i did.
---
What about Clubhouse
---
#Thx
---
I would'nt recommend playing ranked until about level 70 or 80 just for experience purposes. You'll most likely struggle and get placed low (which is very frustrating because most people aren't very good at the game in bronze and copper). Unless you have friends or are doing extremely well in casual. I also say this because my friends were way ahead of me when I started and made me wait until I was level 70.
---
That's definitely a possibility but I feel like the edits to clubhouse were necessary while the overall consensus in the community is new Hereford base isn't very good. Though I guess if we were going with the everything back to original that would make the most sense
---
Yeah goobisoft
---
Did you get it?
---
Because it‚Äôs siege a tactical game with many variables and tricks the only problem with this if you rush in not paying attention
---
Yooo you must be new here. Two years ago this sub would go apeshit on you for stating something like that!
---
#BuffBlitz
---
YAAAYY
---
When ash runs into a hail of MG fire 4 seconds out of spawn in full view of her team, and it sounds just like a chanka turret?
---
All this needs is an ifunny.com at the bottom
---
Smonk with some ganja
---
I've been wondering if they'd add a 3-3 with a very modest gadget, making the fact that they're a fast and tanky boi the main appeal rather than the gadget itself
---
Can't blame them. The game has become a straight up trap/gadget fest, which is why I don't really play it anymore.
---
When your team does more damage to you than the whole enemy team.
---
K
---
Nice! I didn‚Äôt get my first ace until like level 70, I suck at aiming, that‚Äôs why I started playing this game in the first place, I could be decent without having to gun everyone down
---
Fat fuckin rip dude
---
Ahhhh yes the good ol IMG_0484.
---
Sounds like a casual problem
---
I got 2 charms from both of my packs. I hate charms...
---
They should just do all the old maps and ones without reworks in a playlist
---
I used to use it a lot at first, but the ads time is why most don‚Äôt use it
---
You‚Äôre a spastic
---
Its been in the game since launch. They made it a universal sometime later down the road.
---
That's unfortunate, glad to see you're interested though
---
Say its high noon and try to one-tap them
---
He can hold two fuze charges in his hands and shoot them like grenade launchers.
---
a spastic with a blitz ace
---
Totally I love how there are multiple ways to succeed in this game so
---
Much fun strategically.  I think I got my ace because I have played so many military and Tom Clancy games over the years so the shooting feels familiar but I‚Äôm still getting used to how to beat use my gadgets and abilities to turn the battlefield
---
i guess so, but im not really tolerant of trolling no matter the gamemode so its probably just me that thinks this was annoying.
---
What a accomplishment
---
It looks really good, but your black mirror looks very two way
---
This mode was fun but my god was it so jenk.
---
Nah, every bullet it fires is both a buck MstrKey and Glaz shot at the same time.
---
Should make Fuse charges deployable through the shield
---
dont see you pulling them off jager main, go back to sucking Jeff Kpalan's shnoze off for some ACOG skins
---
Hmmm. Do you play with a group of people? That‚Äôs what helped me. Another thing, learn from your mistakes. Every time I die, I think,‚Äúhow could I have played that differently?‚Äù 8/10 times, I die due to simple mistakes. I also try to learn recoil patterns of all operators so I‚Äôm confident in firefights. Hope I could help! Also check out Get_flanked on YouTube, he gives pretty good tips as well. Good luck on your road to plat!
---
But it really in this situation who put the turret down?? They wouldn't have gotten killed by a spawnpeek if the peek didn't happen in the first place.
---
Looks great keep it up!!!
---
Tachanka is clearly the best roamer for the base game period.
---
Oof :/
---
Agreed, I drag myself even through my worst matches and hate when the whole match is screwed by half the team leaving on either end
---
I really can‚Äôt use shotguns as primaries, and people do use other guns for IQ, I have multiple friends who is the G8. Bit for the rest I mean, there‚Äôs a reason why they are used less.
---
Yeah I can understand that...  
---
And like I stated in the screenshot....NO LASER!?
---
r/mildyintersting
---
Damn you got me, because I don‚Äôt post an ace with one of the most easiest operators to ace with, in casual on top of that then be such a child to say ‚Äòez‚Äô means I cry over a 2 year old sight change on a op I play a lot.
---
What device you play it on? Ps4, xbox, or pc? You gotta put this out for people. I'd be glad to help you but I'm not that well knowledged for a task of teaching someone the ropes. But I can tell you don't buy Ela in her state right now. She's pretty bad.
---
I wish they'd last longer than a damn week though or be accessible in custom games since I was busy that week and missed the Halloween house.
---
Every week is unusual weapons week for me lol
---
stay mad while i stay winning. GLE clan stays on top.
---
Plastic wrap*
---
The packs have said from day 1 that they were available for 14 days so this has nothing to do with pack sales since the packs aren't being made available for any longer than they initially were. I would say from their internal numbers that enough people are playing it to keep it around 1 more week. Several of my friends have been playing only this mode for a week and I haven't had any issues queuing for the game mode which makes me think that there's a decent amount of the community playing the game mode. (I play on PS4, results may be different on other platforms)
---
Clans in 2019 btw, also you‚Äôre gold so you‚Äôre barely winning anything lol
---
I personally would like it but I understand why people would get mad but then Ubisoft should just put the MnK users in PC lobbies
---
\#BuffCastle
---
Been here for a long while
---
i cant hear you over the 5 melee kills i just got
---
Haha thanks. Yeah for some reason, there was a glitch when Mira places her gadget idk why...
---
on a side note, can we make all charms common and stop making new shits to put in packs? Absolutely nobody wants or cares about them, just stop wasting our time.
---
Whats in the canisteh?
---
The game is full of it dude. Luckily you can mute voice and text chat if required. If they're TKing you and it's casual, just leave. If it's ranked, consider taking the L as you'll most likely lose anyway. 
---
Ubisoft is useless with the reporting feature they offer. So unfortunately for now we just need to learn to tolerate the toxicity and minimize it as best we can on our ends.
---
Have a nice day you absolute cutie üòò
---
I‚Äôm so salty they can bring this back but not outbreak. Please please please
---
Also now you welcoming me to Siege actually brought up an idea it's also a good way for new players to see what the game used to be like and kind of a way to see how far it's come since then kind of a then vs. now thing
---
Maybe it was thatcher that only had a pistol then. I only started playing this February but I can imagine how good the acog was on the smg11.
---
Did you say recrruit?
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY I AM LITERALLY CONVOLSING ON MY COFFEE TABLE IN FRONT OF MY WIFE AND KIDS I HAVE LOST NERVE FUNCTION BELOW MY NECK PURELY BECAUSE IVE STARVED MY BODY OF OXYGEN FROM LAUGHING SO FUCKING HARD SERIOUSLY WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW FUCKING FUNNY THIS IS I AM RUNNING OUT OF BLOOD BECAUSE I AM CRYING SO HARD IM BLEEDING OUT OF MY TEAR DUCTS AND PORES I AM EUPHORIC OVER THIS ORIGINAL AND WELL CONSTRUCTED JOKE!!
---
They were $7.99 each, came out to $34.76 for all 4
---
I can think of one thing that's made the community toxic and that's ledion and lion. But yes the siege community is pretty out of line these days and it's kind of sad that most of it is pretty toxic now a day's. Around 30million players maybe less, probably. Yet its a shit show of a community if Ive ever seen one.
---
Laughs in Ultimate edition
---
I don't have the best aim all the time, but my strong suit is strategies. I die due to inferior aim a lot, I think 1 shot head shot is perfectly fine
---
Ah, noice.
---
Reminds me of kingsmen scene in the bar
---
Not gon lie, t hunt is the reason why im a decent blitz main
---
People are so thristy for those drone kills
---
What skin is that?
---
You high or sumn old hereford was the shit.

653 hours of play and I am on 142 level and still 6 operators to go.

Same, I very rarely play ranked so I've not really encountered hackers, in 1300 hours of playtime. We were suspecting it the first game, yet it still could have been luck, I got killed as I rounded a corner through a door by the hacker who was playing Mira, he hipfired me, I put it down to lucky spray, then this happened the very next game.
---
Yeah, Thatcher is the only one from SAS that doesn'T has the SMG-11.
---
Mute got it only a couple months ago.
---
I have had it since operation outbreak as a universal skin, it definitely has
---
I also like pretending to be a door.
---
What is this referencing?
---
The plane part of the event is interesting.   
---
The Skins however just outright ruin what Rainbow Six is all about. Tom Clancy would probably take the rights away from Ubisoft for adding Fornite style shit to Rainbow if he was alive. A furry outfit are you freaking serious Ubisoft? Then you got a freaking unicorn helmet... The hell? It's not Fortnite!
---
i actually fell trying to prevent myself from getting peeked lmao
---
Levels get a lot harder to gain past around 120-ish. I'm level 178 on 1280 hours, I need almost 80k Exp for a single level.
---
No it should‚Äôve been the ‚Äúvictory by surrender screen‚Äù
---
Smoke
---
Frost.
---
Thatcher is hammerless and SMG11-less sledge now ha. /s
---
Cav or smoke?
---
I'm so fucking sick of different versions of the same 5 posts in this sub, shits stale as fuck
---
When the shield is extended it also procs off the original Finka concept where it makes the whole team run a speed faster and gives the, glaz's thermal vision, and also gives double health, permanently of course
---
Well actually she‚Äôs one of the best ops right now. If you use her FO-12, it‚Äôs easy to lurk using her GRZMOTS as audio cues and they block attackers hearing, leaving you room to sneak up on them. The FO-12 has the highest effective range of any shotgun in siege. It‚Äôs her skorpion that‚Äôs bad at the moment. Ela is now a lurker and not a frag op like jager or bandit like she used to be.
---
Me and my friend often pick tachanka in ranked just so that the enemies would be pissed off by dying to his lmg. (I have 1.28k/d ratio on tachanka)
---
just a casual player lol i can‚Äôt handle stress
---
I use the baguette to kill the faguette
---
While I would like that this 'classic siege' gamemode would be incredibly nostalgic and fun, there is one obstacle that would make this gamemode difficult to implement. 
---
So, does everyone remember a patch (or was it the Y4S1 update..?) that came a while ago, that required a 60GB download, but overall reduced the size of the game? ^(That I can't find anywhere, but I remember a lot of people complaining on Reddit about it and the patch installing on my computer as well.)
---
Well, what I theorize that the patch deleted all of the unused old textures and old maps, so creating 'Classic Siege' would require another download to bring those assets back. Which if Ubisoft had plans to have a classic Siege gamemode, they wouldn't have deleted those assets in the first place.
---
un ranked right now but tbh i‚Äôve only ever gotten Gold l
---
.....
---
Now that you say it......yeah. yeah that could be good. Not bad, actually.
---
Clash is just discount montagne though
---
What Siege needs more of... Creepy ass furries and unicorn helmets. Way to ruin Siege.
---
But it‚Äôs not gameplay
---
um
---
Oh.
---
Her shotgun redeems her a little
---
Cavs shotgun is better but I don't run it because I use the pistol for close range and her SMG for long range
---
Ela
---
Thanks
---
The blitz flash and melee are really unreliable os that also helps when playing against him

It all worked out in the end. Cap was high or something cause he jumped when I shoot him
---
Oh nvm im on mobile and didnt notice it
---
Delete this
---
this is the worst part, played 5 games yesterday, had someone leave in 4 of them. managed to take 3 games to 9 rounds but it drives me insane that I get deranked repeatedly over leavers then have to grind back up with a full team to negate that
---
Except Ash has a smaller hitbox lol
---
And you know what that's okay. I happen to like all the ops and constantly switch between them, but I know I'm an exception in that regard
---
This guy is almost eating the microphone.
---
Good luck and I believe in you!
---
You son a bitch
---
So we will get new challenge for rainbow is magic pack? Or no more free packs? :/
---
you don't get it back currently.
---
It hurts my heart to this day. So much wasted renown

What are some of your favorite lesion strats?

I just love how clueless they are

T-Hunt. I've explained this is past comments. Weeks on ends of T Hunts to help the friends I was introducing learn the game and maps and stuff. Proof of time and starter edition is on my profile if you wanna confirm
---
When you run around nearly invincible and need not fear.
---
Do you have a lightnings piece like from the star wars sets with the imperator? That could make the taser look even better
---
Ubi is probably one of the best AAA title releasers out at thia point. It seems most big boy game publishers are hell bent on ruining their respect and ubi hasnt fallen into these practices and hopefully they never do.
---
Well here's hoping everything goes according to plan!
---
I‚Äôm not that good, but usually stay in a room with soft wall near the obj and entry point, gu mines with a tiny hole in the wall, then kill.
---
fuck you
---
I'm in the presence of a good, clearly
---
Came here to make this joke, beat me to it good sir
---
I‚Äôm guessing you were talking about the titanfall guy. Yeah his mic was always too quiet and he was one of 2 randoms that joined us for our fun outlook on ranked
---
You betcha
---
Me too
---
I feel that.....
---
Totally serious.
---
wait wow, same thing happened to me yesterday 3 GAMES IN A ROW.. and i played against the same full 5 stack in two of those matches ... 3 v 5's for 3 games ;\_;
---
I wish they would put out more animated movies but those things cost millions to make.
---
happens
---
kill yourself before they can get to you, don't give points to kd warriors

Mine is stay close to obj maybe a room or 2 away and gu gu gu gu everywhere gus arent really for damage it's for me to sneak up shoot

Rule #1: Content Unrelated to R6

Bulletpoint 3: ‚ÄúThis looks like a thing from Siege‚Äù posts are not allowed

yeah and make shotguns even more useless same with dmrs. Yo jus dumb
---
Seems like outbreak will never return. It wasn't a seasonal event, as in easter christmas or so. The event was tied to operation outbreak.
---
I agree but I'd love for it to be like OG siege with 3 barbed wire Bandit, Grenades with IQ and Thermite, 151 Damage OTS 11 that had a larger zoom and slower ROF, 1 Speed Blitz, 100dmg EDDs and just purely "realistic" gadgets and none of this futuristic ass stuff.
---
"Doctors hate him, but Doc loves him"
---
*...but does this idea sell packs?*
---
Hmmmmm... apologies senpai
---
Ah it‚Äôs steam hours, that‚Äôs why. I‚Äôm on console at 700 hours at level 210~, so my hours only count for in game hours. I got confused with this time allocation tho
---
That's why I said for there to be a time limit for rematching.
---
Also, it doesn't matter if you can still win, you are at a disadvantage regardless of how good your players are and that's not fair.
---
You have them all so far.. üòâ
---
Ur Joking right? If you ever run out of utility do your realize how frustrating a clash can be? Honestly Ubi needs to remove her from the game
---
Worst part is I bought it after hitting level 100+ on console having all ops unlocked already
---
i was on my yokai when he was repelling in, so I kinda panicked haha
---
WHAT

The big guy can't be Sledge because of the cockney accent.
---
I hav 1.6k  hours and still dont have all the operator. I have bought alpha packs.....
---
Whenever I try to play recruit, even in casual, my team votekicks me.
---
Omg thank you so much I missed that spelling error, I will never again do such an awful thing. Do you want me to spank myself for it? Will that make you feel better? I don't know what else would make someone so attention hungry that they had to go around correcting peoples grammar on Reddit of all things feel good about themselves. Well either way rest easy that you have done your job on making sure that I know I used a word wrong.
---
i asked ubi support and they said it‚Äôs enabled
---
Yep, a hero over there. You have all my respect as a starter edition player as well
---
I mean it's more about the satisfaction of getting that one-tap with any gun. Lucky kills will happen in any game with recoil, or more accurately, any game period. For the most part I think people are open to the possibility of reducing the damage of head shots through walls, but that would also nerf teamwork with droning on soft walls, so I don't want anyone to rush to that conclusion either.
---
The one shot headshots are are like a solid 1/4 of what makes this game so tense and special.
---
So that‚Äôs how B-Rabbit‚Äòs sweater looks like....
---
*laughs in Gorbachev*
---
It really took you that long!? My first Black Ice was for the smg-11 back when I was lvl 17. I didn‚Äôt even knew they were a thing lol. But it looks sick on the F2! Congrats
---
Damn, i only need gridlock, but i have already over 2000 hours in. But I guess I did buy the shield skin for monty...
---
Well i play on me PS4 pro and i think i would never waste all that time when i can just buy the year pass
---
Im only missing year 2 operators cause i think none of them are useful
---
*i was gonna say except mira but then i realise everyone is useful except vigil,vigil just keeps getting the drones into your area
---
If we face each other, aim at each others heads and shoot at the same time you have the UMP, I have the SMG-12:
---
With 1SHS we trade.
---
With 2SHS you die and I survive.
---
We had equal skill, I won because of the mechanic. And because of the rate of fire.
---
Definitely steam hours and not uplay.
---
They are weekly challenges, they've always only lasted 7 days and you can actively see the timer on them
---
thats 18 MAX damage, so with damage fall off over distance it can be even less
---
Sir, I have a running joke with my mates that I make whoever did something amazing into my new "god" and that I'm going to pray to them before bed.  I will pray to you before I go to bed.
---
Who was last ?
---
Says the castle main
---
this is why i never buy packs to wish.
---
Damn I honestly wish there was a trade system because I got smokes head gear and I don't play him, and I can see you would like it more than me, although I'm not sure you would trade me the tachanka helmet since it's the coolest one, but I don't play either of them so it wouldn't matter all that much
---
Go to r/Rainbow6 and there should be a settings Burton and then change user flair
---
Clash? Or are you talking about one that can melee with a shield?
---
Did you get this lobby in an alpha pack?
---
3 speed and bb shield oh wait and the old lion scan from chimera
---
Ps add also glaz ots scope to it and it will be balanced
---
Farming hostage on house is the fastest way to get renown in the game.
---
You can get him out in under a minute (but if it's under a minute you don't get renown)
---
Just out of curiosity how are you only level 150? I have about 470 hours and I am at level 153 or 154.
---
Wow! GG
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more!
---
That part was an afterthought, read the part before that. Are they, though. Last I checked I still saw plenty of videos of people meleeing and shooting through shields etc.. 
---
I think the best option though would be to have the option to surrender without losing anything (manual rematching) or be able to just continue playing and possibly win, but lose a little bit of elo if they lose because where there's a reward there should be a bit of risk as well. And by little bit I mean like very little like 10 elo or smth rather than the usual 100+
---
I honestly wasn't a big fan of Smokes helmet, and yeah Tachankas helmet ain't coming off any time soon.
---
YAY!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I love this mode
---
On my way there, got all of the default ops and I'm just finishing up Year One, can't wait to reach your level!
---
That's literally why the game is good.
---
I haven't played this game in a while, what map is this?
---
honestly
---
smug flair checks out
---
Thered be less hitches and stutters if you cap it in my opinion
---
I don't understand why people rush that staircase on attack. That's the favourite spawnpeek runout.
---
I think peak performance would be straight up carved from stone
---
To many are doing this on everything. Is it a permant ban. Be nice if so.
---
Pretty sure the real ones are only sold by Ubisoft directly, major retailers only have the cheaper looking ones
---
Casuals always been t hunt
---
No thank you.
---
He outplayed you
---
can i have a p90 for cav pls? :)
---
Thanks man!
---
Who said R6 Siege going to the next gen of consoles was out of the picture? PC version won't really be affected and will continue to grow, so long term, why not?
---
You do realize that you can have different values for each weapon right? Say you have 2 weapons. One is a 450 ROF with a 40 base and 50 HS the other is a 800 ROF with 17 base and 25 HS. What weapon do you think is better? The answer is they're  actually about the same. Assuming one miss the 450 lands at a 0.8389 while the 800 assuming 2 misses (figure thats fair, double the fire rate double the chance to miss) lands at 0.8388. Ideal TTKs for these also fall around the same area with the 450 0.5177 and 800 at 0.5327. The balance between them being the slightly better but more punishing 450 ROF and the slightly worse but more forgiving 800 ROF. Both are close so there isn't an obvious winner and different types of players gravitate to either.
---
Under the current system the 450 is automatically several times worse then the 800 because they can both OHK. See my point?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve adjusted that since uploading this. I‚Äôll wait to post a more complete version once I get more of it done or complete it. I don‚Äôt want to spam progress pictures.
---
Lol. The exact same thing happened to me once. I was like "hmm I don't remember getting knocked when jumping down the elevator". Looked up the hatch later and thinking "ah makes sense".
---
Target won't die after interrogation. Fuze charge will go off after target dies/being revived/stepped on by target's teammates.
---
Mix the beef flavor ramen packet with eggs, sounds gross but damn its good
---
Nice.
---
Congrats man :)
---
This man holds much more power than I could ever even imagine

There‚Äôs no difference between Bronze Silver and Gold so I wouldn‚Äôt stress.
---
Spook 100
---
The p90 is a hipfire monster with the laser tbh. Also missing the elephant skin
---
so you grinded to get them haha, what i did is much smarter ok, i bought starter edition and then paid hundreds of dollars extra to get them.Im not retarded.
---
*cough* elephant skin*
---
I will do a little less transparent
---
Eh not really but its still better than you did that round so I‚Äôd let him have it
---
I would say no. Taking someone's down is wrong unless they are dead. The person that downs should get the kill the other should be assist.
---
I mean he got 5 kills it‚Äôs an ace. I‚Äôd call one kill stolen if the frost was still alive but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less an ace
---
I'm nearly there. I need 3 more defenders and 2 more attackers.
---
I want to hope you're right, but I won't quote anything for sure
---
He said this after acog removal ?
---
His brain lost connection, like the Ubi servers.
---
I‚Äôm level 170 but only have 480 ish hours
---
good ideq
---
I can't say that you are completely wrong, but if you don't see the big soldier near that cam, the problem is yours, not of the game lol
---
Make the dive! Leave Siege altogether! Cause the headshot mechanic has been here essentially from the start, why pretend like it's some issue that developed, but people just got better at aiming.
---
It was a good feeling and I still remember the day I unlocked my final operator.
---
You‚Äôre missing out on lesion man...

hi welcome to copper IV take a number

She broke both

This:

I think it would be cool if a new attacker got one
---
**CornerShot**
---
CornerShot is a weapon accessory invented by Lt. Col. Amos Golan of the Israeli Defense Forces in cooperation with American investors. It was designed in the early 2000s for use by SWAT teams and special forces in hostile situations usually involving terrorists and hostages.

Random crits are actual bullshit because theres no way to control it
---
One shot headshots require actual skill and people are just salty. So-called ‚Äúpros‚Äù complain about them for the same reason they pressure Ubi to let Ash stay broken. They really aren‚Äôt good at the game and have only gotten this far by abusing it.
---
I'm no artist but I love your shading. It's the one thing when I attempt to draw, I can never land. Keep it up!! I'm pretty sure as you draw more you'll up your talent even more! Level those skills agent! -crackdown commander voice-
---
Just add a search option. IMO.
---
Is this the new comers play list??? smh
---
Only just partly true. The high skill floor compensates for this. Gunplay is just 1 small part of siege. Huge chunk of it is game sense, positioning, map knowledge and strats. This is why diamonds win 10 out of 10 against coppers-silvers. Whereas other fps games such as csgo focus more on gunplay, and more easily accessible to casual players. Hence, its popularity.

Headshot must be a kill, headshot through a wall must be a wound, at worst. Ez.

If it is ever removed, play it yourselves. Or rather, just go play CS and don't ruin the fun for others.

Congrats. I bought the starter too but there's no way i could wait so long to catch'em all. So imma buy an operators pack.
---
I was waiting you tell me what to do!
---
Zaira?? From the PH?
---
Except I can't do that in th cause I would be surrounded in a matter of seconds. And the bombers...
---
I cri everitim
---
Honestly yes because joining a game that has already started is usually boring as a lot of the times you join mid round or one sided as the reason someone may have left is because the team was getting beat so bad it would be a nice incentive to stay
---
p90 with acog, suppressor, and laser sight is what me a my buddies like to call the Retard Canon.
---
Why
---
Fake and gay
---
Some one else pointed that out. I honestly forgot there even was a change in that stuff. But since it wasnt SI it must have been ranked. I likely assumed it was SI because I only ever seemed to get Bank on SI
---
Completely agree with you. I was just typing this up discussing purely the aiming side of the game.
---
I like making people mad by using a silenced P90 w/ acog and using single shot mode instead of auto. They call me crazy. I call myself the discoverer of a high-capacity (low dmg) DMR
---
Seeing you do it in 900 hours makes it seem like it's going to take forever for me.
---
I've got 504 hours and have 1/4 of year 2, nothing from year 3 or 4. I want die now.
---
:)
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it. As for the shading, I‚Äôm just using a basic 0.7 mm mechanical pencil with blue lead, so I just use a lot of quick parallel strokes. It takes time to get used to but once you get the hang of it you can easily fill in spaces with thin lines in seconds. 
---
I‚Äôm trying to do these as fast as I can in my free time so it‚Äôs a method that lets me at least sketch everything out and get the basic layout down first.
---
Ubisoft are amazing.
---
Ubisoft is amazing, what an update!
---
I knew this sub was trash but holy shit this is a new level of stupid
---
WELL DONE SIR!
---
What?
---
You sir, are a good man.
---
Good idea not staying very long. I'm an Xbox player. It can get awful.
---
I did this too but I bought most of them with R6 credits. In hindsight I could've gotten them all with renown by now since I've got 1,600 hours and only play ranked. Damn
---
You shouldn't have died from your own trap at 53% health.  Did you take top spot at the end of the match?
---
God, just by looking this clip i want to punch both of you :)
---
Yes but Mira makes up for that with arguably the strongest gadget in the game. 
---
A shield is the shittiest secondary gadget available. 
---
A well defended Tachanka is a hilarious waste of utility that can be taken care with one emp, shot vertically, 2 flashes, or just be fire bolted to death. Take out an ads then you can add all sorts of stuff to list like frags, ash charges, Zophia charges, etc. Mav has made him even more useless because he can just poke a hole in the wall and shoot him.
---
If you want an OP that basically has a turret, but also is actually useful then just run Maestro.
---
Just don‚Äôt tell my wife ;)
---
Glaz‚Äôs banana vision is stupid not in principle but in practice. The fact that enemies are highlighted bright yellow whilst nothing else is, and the fact he has exactly zero counters, makes it stupid.
---
They should just replace his current iteration with actual thermal, which responds to heat of other things like appliances and whatnot in the map. I also think making Smoke‚Äôs canisters obscure Glaz‚Äôs vision would also be good.
---
There are definitely people like that. Same as people who use macros to play at the top, just a bit harder to hide. 444
---
Yeah when you had to barricade and put down a hammer to stop that.
---
Nice work there bud
---
This appeared twice in my feed, with a difference in the title but the picture is the same.
---
Same bud :)
---
Not for virgins i guess \^\^
---
nah
---
Yes thank you for telling me exactly What i Said with ‚Äúdepends on where you hit‚Äù
---
Doubt it after 3 years haha. Just not possible for lowest common denominator the standard controllers. They won‚Äôt bother making it for a small minority that have remapped or elite style controllers.
---
You could argue sledge has a better primary, but for the role described buck makes more sense for opening the floors.
---
Accurate.
---
I personally would remove ACOG from all ops except 3-armor.
---
I also wanted a 1,5x or a 2x scope since dust line.
---
Another thing I wanted was to change the color of the dot.
---
But I can tell you that much. It won‚Äôt happen.
---
you could be right, balancing may indeed be far too difficult for this to ever work. Just wanted to discuss whether 1 shot headshots cater towards more skillful players or the more casual ones.
---
... in casual.
---
Your ace isn‚Äôt really that impressive, fun to watch but not so good you need to say ez in casual
---
You should watch some streamers like Beaulo (is that how its spelt?) Or pro players playing ranked. Happens quite alot.
---
Ah shit I meant pl
---
He is probably like: ‚Äúwhen will i get my elite skin?‚Äù PLZ GIVE SMOKE AN ELITE SKIN
---
I would be ok with any defender had an ACOG if their gun had a very high recoil to counterbalance it. I know it's not popular because "they're gonna spawnpeek" but you can just look at the operators you spot on the other team, detect that they're gonna spawnpeek and blow their head off. Spawnpeeking isn't a legitimate issue with ACOGs, it only affects people who have no situational awareness and just rush the objective like a dumbass
---
‚Äúabove-average‚Äù. Yeah, because the above-average player can win multiple world championships
---
Please show me the footage where a person gets fucking shot in the head (with a military grade weapon, not some backwater third world scrap gun), brushes it off and starts sprinting around in full combat gear. After that, show me the statistics that say that this is absolutely the norm and happens atleast 90% of the time.
---
Considering how many games I join mid-game: yes. But I don‚Äôt think that we will see such a thing.
---
It's just Lardex running out on me at the speed of molasses
---
Camera shift made parallax effect a bit worse, but that's all. It was always there and it's wort to keep it in mind and peek accordingly.

May i know your mouse config? :)

#YOU ARE FUCKED

You didn‚Äôt mention that once in he comment that I replied to, all it says is that you could survive a bullet of a pistol caliber.
---
Ash mains?
---
Yes ik but it's just funny because it has happened twice in the span of a week, my other one was much worse then this. Like shouldn't even be possible
---
Of course I've considered it. Rome wasn't built in a day, so this issue cant be explained in a single post unless i intended to write a small novel. The Intent of this post was to firstly discuss whether or not one shot headshots cater towards more skillful players or towards the more causal ones. If you neglected to properly read my post you are in no position to be pushing any idea's.
---
Can anyone confirm for me if this news about it being extended came out last week ? Or was this announced today. My friend is adamant he knew this would be extended from reading about it last week.
---
If they remove that, I will retire. Noobs asking for this shit. Fuk off!!!
---
I was convinced for half of that you found a way to spawn in during prep phase.
---
* Did you heard about Polish Goverment in Exile? Every conquerd country had their legall government in London. So yes, there was diplomatic relations between Poland and USSR until dicovery of Katy≈Ñ truth. I don't really understand what do you mean saying that "Katyn happened because division happened". Can you explain me what's your point? 
---
* Poland signed non-agression treaty with Germans and Soviets multiple times and allience with France of course. Poland also proposed to France to attack Germany when they ignored Treaty of Versailles. Twice. But France refused, so we can also blaim them for doing nothing against Hitler. 
---
* And yes, Poland annexed Zaolzie, wich was annexed by Czechoslovakia in 1919. But noone remmebmer that little but imprtant fact.
---
I know it is mostly rushers that get spawnpeeked. But it isn't Ash specific, hell anyone with an IQ below 70 can get spawnpeeked. I won't discriminate. **Everybody Dies**
---
Uh... That's way overkill for a PC. It's be better to build a 1200 PC now and upgrade for the last 1200 ater down the line, especially since next gen consoles are right around the corner and we have no idea if even an RTX 2080 is future proofed enough.
---
I mean, he never said he can't handle it, he just questioned why one would do it. Which I wonder as well. There's enough bs people have to deal with in general, why spread more shit?
---
**Seige be like that**
---
And you can. Not to mention, helmets have 0 effect on anything in this game 2/10 for realism
---
Actually one of the last few controller breeds. Ps4 plat and diamonds are like 60% mnk. Its so frustrating like just go to PC
---
*laughs in 3 armor over a 30m distance*
---
Are you saying hibana and thermite are retarded picks?
---
Rough. I got Monty's Shield skin. Hopefully one of these events allows us to get the cosmetics outside of loot boxes
---
Ah I see
---
Siege is about realism and have you ever gotten sprayed in real life? No because your still here.
---
I don‚Äôt remember the last time I even tried to use those stairs. It‚Äôs always the cargo ladder or back stairs

When i see this, i start thinking of Sly Marbo from Warhammer 40k. Specifically, his depiction in "What if the Emperor had a Text-To-Speech Device."

You are what's making this game so cancerous

yep, came in here to say this. sounds like he got upset over a death and said some stupid shit to make himself feel better.

Honestly it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. He complains about everything so it‚Äôs probably on the list somewhere.

He said the original ops
---
Reddit led me to believe only console players were this bad...
---
I've been taught a lie.
---
this topic makes me so angry because i‚Äôve been playing for so long and only really been holding on recently because of the mechanics. i can tell you now, if there was a 2x multiplier only i, and many others, would definitely notice.
---
it makes siege so different from other games. not saying the other mechanics and environment don‚Äôt, but any of those fundamentals are so important
---
Got Tachankas headgear from the free pack, your luck is appreciated sirs...
---
I don't mind entertaining the idea but I personally doubt it will even come into fruition.
---
I was really tired after destroying all the walls and floors, so forgive me if the video doesn't show every new angle.
---
That is until you become malala and give the finger to science
---
Let's be honest though. Pengu knows more about the game than you or I do. I may not always agree with him but he's played far more than I ever will and he knows more about balancing than most players.
---
He is also right about matchmaking it isn't accurate and only three others are the same rank as him ie. 2x world champs
---
You don‚Äôt gain 50 elo in one game of plat. Maybe 23 tops.
---
Buck does not have smg11
---
Those are so neat. I'd like to find one.
---
He's good, but his personality is toxic and egocentric. Not to mention his awful idea of game balance.
---
White Noise i think.
---
Good timing.
---
I think it should just be a guy saying how shit this game is but it's the best game he's ever played.
---
#kkk
---
Buck gonna have a good time
---
I used this as a meme and it can't even 1 shot a downed person
---
Spawnkilling in Siege is the equivalent to Spawntrapping in COD, a cunt move
---
yikes
---
I know the workaround by switching cams, but it‚Äôd be nice to just fix it. Haha.
---
Thank you
---
Damn man that's so cool can't wait to see more of your work
---
The problem with it is the people that abuse it, not the mechanic itself.
---
The mucus skin
---
Why would anyone want to remove this?
---
LOL NO. A bump helmet is essentially just a bicycle helmet. 
---
You mean ballistic helmets.
---
You should do house next.
---
‚ÄúYou touch my lunchbox and I will evil eye you, damn stronzos.
---
*cries in 18 damage*
---
Server maintenance
---
Nah, its when toxic as fuck players start yapping their mouths after you lose the first round.
---
Then you turn their frowns upside down by smacking the enemy team down repeatedly until he becomes a personal hype fan of you as you win the match.
---
How about Castle x Valk?
---
Dokkaebi x Hibana?
---
It's automatic
---
And getting headshots is lucky.... how?
---
One shot headshots currently support players who rely on luck to get kills. Removing one shot headshot is only going to make better players shine more often while making the worse players who can't maintain control of their aim to lose more.
---
By the way, it's funny how you say BR games by default to be arcade-ish. I would say pubg is a harder game than Siege because in pubg, the average recoil for guns is much higher, and you have very minimal information about where enemies can appear from.
---
If you worked hard on your aim alignments, then you shouldn't struggle by getting 2 headshots back to back instead of just 1.
---
Next season operators should be nurses with wheelchairs
---
problem is, I don't use either of them, wish we can trade in game stuff or something
---
https://youtu.be/p0qcYZJfy14
---
His AR is amazing btw, does 49 damage. The only problem with him is that he can sometimes he shot in the head above the shield
---
Nope. The delta protected my ass most of the time. and you just learnt how to not BB there, dont directly hit someone holding an angle head on, because torso hit is still a hit. Crouch as BB, and when i say crouch, i mean walk on crouch for 99% of the time so your torso part is smaller.
---
Agreed. You wanna make a realistic game then understand a headshot is gonna fucken hurt and down ya
---
Why is this even a debate? Without OSHS was the game would literally be trash. Shields and one speeds would dominate the entire game.
---
&lt;3
---
Yup!
---
Yeah but like does that need we can still play?
---
Yeah because someone having an opinion different to yours is "ruining" the community.
---
No not really. 
---
Getting hit outside of your plates is nothing vital. All your vitals are under plates. Getting shot in a plate might break a few ribs, but when your body is in fight or flight mode you are still moving. 
---
It has to be a really nasty shot to knock you on your ass. And then you're ass is off the ground and moving if you die.
---
Well, at least it's another free pack I guess. Better than nothing. Still, they should stick with 20, that's more balanced
---
Yeah I guess looking at an enemy on plain even ground and getting straight 1 tapped is playing him wrong. *shrug*
---
Its actually an account for the clan I'm in
---
You mean that there is a better place than reddit to voice my opinions and suggestions about the game? 
---
This subreddit represents  the players that care about the game and participate in the discussions and feedbacks . Also ubisoft devs have frequently spoken about reddit being the source for their community feedbacks.
---
I simply don't see it being worth the development time since it wouldnt be corresponded with the sale of the event packs. Not to mention queue times would be ridiculous since it would likely be impossible to find a certain game at any given time.
---
It depends where you get hit in the head, what kind of round and even then the survivability of surviving a bullet to the head is low and will leave you mentally and physically deformed.
---
Serenity himself said he's in favor of removing it. It's on his video.
---
WHY THE FUCK IS THE DAMAGE EVEN LOWER
---
I remember that being a thing in Rainbow 6.
---
Yes, the one Red Storm released in '96.
---
Oh man. It's that obvious?

It's just sad that people do it.  And it's so obvious they are as well since when you see the kill cam their sensitivity is above 1000. It's just embarrassing for the game really.
---
Its mostly 13 year old kids who do this because they have no sense of humor and think its just hilariously fun.
---
The total force isn‚Äôt that much. It would be equal to having the butt oh the gun against your head when you fire it and the recoil go into your head. It‚Äôs not that bad.
---
I agree with the sight options. We should have a 1.5x and a 1.75x sight. I don‚Äôt think we should have more ACOGs though.
---
Then it's probably for the better, based on your dumb analogy.
---
UPDATE: i actually got my pack about 10 hours later
---
it was the blackbeard headgear
---
I like latex dildos
---
If you've never had that experience then im sorry but I dont think your opinion matters much in the wake of someone who's been playing him since release and has encountered the same issue countless times. 
---
Also with more than 3 thousand hours in the game ive also met a very large number of people who experience the same issue.
---
Its casual tho
---
Wow you really suck at drawing
---
It should stay but at the same time, there should be exceptions. Are you telling me that both Cavs head and Rooks head are both equally unprotected? Rook has a fortress on his face, he shouldnt be able to be 1-shot domed like that!
---
It must've been a great drawing lol, I'm sure it looks fine.  This drawing looks awesome!  Great job, you're a great artist!
---
lmao... no its been here for a while
---
I still dont get why you beed different accounts for this. But if you feel like it its fair enough.
---
This. Id say claymore was a bad taste, but smoke would also be a bad idea because that would turn IQ into cheap glaz and make her an absolute hard counter to vigil. So for what it is, until goobi can make some kind of new gadget (1 use rook plate?) That clay gonna stay.
---
you should put finka in the back desperately trying to be a part of them
---
There are too many variables in play to consider when discussing how a match went wrong, maybe most of the player are having a bad day, maybe operator composition is bad. Based on the ranks of the players it can easily be concluded that the matchmaking system did not make any error.
---
U sloveni≈°?
---
Arguing for realism in a game that has very little realism is insane. By your logic we shouldn't be able to sprint if we get shot in the leg. We shouldn't be pulling reinforcements out of our pockets either.
---
You're being extremely ignorant.
---
49 damage but 545 fire rate and sub par recoil. Its one of the lowest DPS guns in the game for attack and idk about you but if his gadget isnt going to work id much rather have one of the guns that does 48 damage with a 690 fire rate. (I dont think that 1 point of damage is going to get anyone killed anytime soon)
---
Never understood why anyone watches any of these people. They are just toxic at times.
---
Same thing happened to my brother. Twice in an hour. Both games were 3v5. One he won and one he lost. From winning he got 12 elo. From losing he lost 35.
---
Ok one instance of a ‚Äúlucky spray ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean the whole headshot mechanic should be changed . If someone is able to fire a whole magazine and manages to hit you in the head they were still making adjustments to their aim. 
---
    Not to mention if they sprayed a whole magazine and hit you in the head whose fault is that?  You choose to peek or hold the angle while the other guy is spraying and got picked off because if it.   If you change the headshot mechanic you change the whole dynamic of the game.  
---
    
---
   If Pengu or anyone else for that matter wants to complain about a core mechanic of the game maybe it‚Äôs time you switch games because you aren‚Äôt enjoying it anymore.
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with his opinions. The problem I have is within his constant complaining. Every Pengu clip I ever see, he‚Äôs just complaining. I‚Äôve never heard him say something positive about the game, and that‚Äôs why I despise him. He‚Äôs just a plague.
---
Most people are too ignorant to understand this basic concept.
---
Good job
---
r/WholesomeSiege
---
Yes. Bc a 7.62x39 flying at 2,330 feet per second has the same amount of penetrating power of a buttstock. Congratulations you made everyone dumber.
---
I think this might be the first time I've seen a cav staying in one place, not to mention that place being the objective
---
Not true. Some helmets can save you from a 7.62 round to the head and you can walk off with no permanent damage.
---
This makes my soul hurt
---
Yup
---
Ok then get rid of 1 shot headshots and watch the game lose more than half of its players and turn into another call of duty parody
---
It's so obvious that those guys didn't learn anything about history other than "murika gret kountri of fridom, veri free!"
---
And if I shoot your leg with a DMR, you shouldn't be able to continue sprinting and leaning like a mad man.
---
I mean it‚Äôs pretty rare you get shot in the top of the head with the shield on, but his guns have head shields on them, they can‚Äôt have amazing stats
---
Why I agree that 1 shot headshot shouldn't be changed? Or why I'd like to see the 2 shot headshot on TTS?
---
Ok
---
It‚Äôs not a mechanic that singlehandedly makes Siege what it is, but it‚Äôs one of the core gameplay mechanics of Siege, just like environmental destruction and unique operators.
---
Watch some Pro league games and get advice for strats and other gammeplay. 
---
I would watch G2, Faze, Nora Rengo, Evil Geniuses and Team Empire
---
happy cake day btw!
---
Yeah, and look how that turned out witht the Blitz rework lol. This is all without mentioning the fact that you are either misinformed or just flatout lieing about what Pengu's opinion on the one shot headshot mechanic changes. And since you followed up the misinformation with "pro players are runijg the game" i'm going to assume you were intentionally twisting what he said.
---
If you think Siege is slow, try clearing an entire house in a careful and deliberate manner, it will take longer than three minutes. And that is just walking into every room.
---
Then, try to board up one single window, and time it. It will likely take more than three minutes just getting the material to the workspace.
---
How fast do you think someone reloads? Sets up steel reinforcements on a wall? Pulls out a knife? Defuse a bomb?
---
Siege is a slow paced game, compared to other games. But it is fast as hell compared to real life.
---
Hello wheresmycroissant, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bb7qxa/instillation_still_in_progress_error/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
why are these too frequent ffs?
---
That hostage is pretty worried. you should help them.
---
I got 1 shotted too thru shield a couple of times recently. Bb is 1 of my most played op (near-exclusively played on ranked at gold-diamond only) and 1 of my highest kd with 1.9. U cud say i main him, but i dont. I only play him when i see my team losing. With that said, I'd say bb is balanced.
---
&gt;if you get shot anywhere on the body once with a high caliber rifle
---
Depends on the armor.
---
Also I know for damn sure I can't click heads on demand and neither can the majority of players so when you land when it feels nice
---
u/
---
The game as the months go by is just becomming more and more toxic and driving new player more and more away.  Even myself even. It isnt fun anymore to be tk'd every match, have someone go afk or leave or to see keyboard and mouse either.  The game is losing its touch and ubisoft doesn't seem to care either.
---
If you're too far up your ass, why don't you annoy some other user who doesn't want an argument.
---
&gt; One shot headshot is what sets it apart from games like BF and COD.
---
You're saying it's the most important difference separating these games ?
---
Are you absolutely sure about this ?
---
Don't you want to think a little more about it ?
---
Very cool, could you do favela next?
---
Yeah I usually am tooüòÇ
---
Sorry man, but that sounds like a you problem. I'm assuming you mostly play casual and/or lower ranks? Because if you played plat+ and comp you wouldnt experience this much. That's why I still find it fun. It's not over done for me.
---
Or your entire head is 5 feet out from cover while you are no where near the edge
---
I wish it was a game I could play with music.  I used to play CS and Day of Defeat blasting music all the time.  There are certain albums that I'll listen to that bring me right back to those glory days of gaming.  
---
I miss the days when being an above average shooter meant you were a god in pub servers, back when MMR wasn't a thing.
---
Yea I watch a lot of streamers, but if u are in 1v4s where each fight is a 1v1, then thats the enemy's fault, which they should be punished for, but the question was should players be able to still clutch it out when the opponent is playing properly. I may have misinterpreted it but thats what I got out of it
---
&gt;Okay, you're just repeating the same thing over and over again
---
Yeah, because you're dodging the question every time.
---
&gt; Bringing up a single point isn't saying the whole game is broken, just what happened in that incident.
---
Really not this complicated. "I'm not talking about the whole thread" then "no one is saying the game is broken". You don't see a contradiction?
---
&gt;Do you not understand that they should be fixed in order to use them for finding glitches and what not.
---
Which is not what you said before. You said they can (present tense) be used to discern glitches etc. I'm asking you how when they are so broken.
---
&gt;I'm not saying they're great at all, but they shouldn't be broken just because it's the norm.
---
You really need to brush up on your comprehension if you think you and I are having a discussion on whether or not they should be fixed.
---
Feel free to DM me if you need any help and the time zones line up!
---
9mm through a double paneled wall into a helmet wouldn't even do that so enough with the realism
---
Yeah, no.
---
Blackbeard is in the perfect place right now,
---
I don't think you understand how much his shield provides as is... siege is a game where one bullet to the head kills. His shield blocking any amount of bullets is huge. It provides him with more time to land a kill.
---
The only way I can see him being buffed without him becoming too strong is if they made his shield invincible but he couldn't shoot while it's up, so he can peek corners and draw fire, and identify enemy positions with no risk. This would make him the only character in the game that can 100% safely peak but it isn't too strong.
---
Head shot for 3 armor should drop health to 5 or 10 , Except DOC he must die
---
Spawnpeeking in casual means I‚Äôm not trying
---
That makes sense from a balancing standpoint. After all, taking away the headshot entirely from those weapons would make them much less viable.
---
Let's be honest though. Pengu know more about the game than you or I do. But he doesn't know shit about how to develop a community, how to develop games, how to make a game profitable on long term, how to satisfy the community, how to make the player base grow etc... I hope you got my point cheers :)
---
As an attacker though, as long as you take control of the outer area properly, defenders can have a tough time. Although, the little tea room and the Buddha rooms make it tough for attackers on the bottom floor site, you gotta drone carefully
---
If I was any other OP in that scenario I would have died. 
---
And I don‚Äôt have Meastro
---
Remove ash first
---
I do primarily play casual, but I‚Äôm usually hanging around low gold- low plat, depends on if I‚Äôm having a good day or not. however, I do often play with lower level friends, and that may be the issue, I‚Äôm not 100% sure
---
&gt;they said that '' blackbeard excells at peeking angles '' isn't he supposed two?
---
He excels at holding angles.
---
Isn't one of the upcoming operators dutch?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/7jzahi/can_we_have_a_civilized_discussion_about_headshots/
---
He basically nerfed nomad into existence now look what‚Äôs happening. Ubi will always consider what the pro league players say due to the fact that they are making them money so if they consistently bitch/complain about something in the game you can bet your ass it will be looked into.
---
There aren't any Dutch operators right now, and none on the roadmap for Y4 unfortunately.
---
Danish
---
If you want Siege to be something its not, that's fine. Just don't expect your opinion to be the most popular.
---
Honestly I think a buff to Blackbeard would not be to his shield, but instead to his MK17. I think they should lower the damage but increase the mag size and rate of fire.
---
If you ever want to do this again and need a hand to make it take less time shoot me a PM and we can work together.
---
That's fair but his opinions are still very valid. I dislike the way people are talking about him here and other pros who only want was is best for the game
---
I would honestly like it better if you reverted all the patches for this mode just for nostalgia
---
Acog on smg11 j√§ger and bandit
---
Sniper 90 and thermite grenades too because why not
---
He dosent good enough though just my opinon
---
&gt; flying at 2,330 feet per second
---
Do you feel smart for googling that or otherwise knowing that?
---
what? did you think your head was hidden or something? are you stupid?
---
Exactly.
---
Well you're wrong.
---
Agreed honestly
---
Dont forget to save your world !
---
*minecraft ptsd*
---
gave it a try, dont know what to think yet
---
Yeah but the bad part is that you can get flanked easly and this was before nomad so even harder to block flanks and with alot of rooms it takes along time to drone everything. But idc to much it was my fsv map in ranked and never saw the problem myself i just know why others hate it so much
---
He got hour banned then.
---
Prove me wrong please mabye il change my mind
---
Thinking about others' opinions =/= thinking your opinions matter more.
---
I dont think it would spread them apart, I actually think it would just put some players in lower ranks, which Im completely fine with.
---
Lmao undo operation health entirely too for the real deal experience
---
Prepare for a wave of posts of destroyed maps...
---
Hardly precision since you can still miss even if you're actively trying to get a headshot because players move very unpredictably.
---
I can't change your mind it's facts
---
Ok, I agree, I missed a bit of information about relations between USSR and Polish Government in exile. Thank you for pointing that out. And yet, Red Army was the only force, that could help the uprising any time soon. And not coordinating with it was the biggest mistake one could make. Even if not directly, then through British intermediary. That could be arranged, but uprising was aimed to capture city before Red Army comes, not with it. So it failed, while Soviets were not in the position to provide support.
---
On your second point, Poland did very much something for Hitler by not letting Soviets helping Czechoslovakia and making gains by that, even if it was indeed justified.
---
That's literally what he was designed to do...
---
Hmmm i need to take time and just think
---
Lmao that stand off with Monty.
---
Ma main
---
I honestly didn't think you can open bank up so much
---
I am pretty sure it‚Äôs going to have the opposite effect. And Shotguns will be on the rise.
---
you should probably visit their ubi profile and click the flag label (if there is one....)
---
Except other games don't have 1 shot headshots, which means there's a level of forgiveness if you happened to miss a shot by a pixel. Games that don't have 1 shot headshots basically make it where the better player with better aim ALWAYS wins, period. That's not the case in Siege, there's wayyyy too much lucky shit in Siege for it to be considered even fair.
---
There's nothing to worry about here. There's no way Ubi is seriously gonna contemplate this. We are 3 years into the life of siege
---
&gt;Removing one shot headshots dramatically lowers the skill level
---
That's absolutely false.
---
A HS multiplayer would still reward aiming for the head, but would make lucky HS kills less likely.
---
I dotn give a flying fuck who say anything different I to think that his shield could use a tad more hp not a huge amount but just like up to 60-70 hp hes too weak with his shield in my opinion
---
Potato enemies but hey, it resembles blitz's OP video!
---
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't take it the time to look at other comments and I should have. That makes sense though.
---
Wdym
---
Bruh I can't find these anywhere!!!!
---
Im not sure whether to laugh or cry....
---
Well csgo? Idk if theres one shot headshot
---
Ohhh...sorry, I understood it the wrong way. Again, my english has a long way to develop.
---
You spent... 2 hours
---
Thank you for saying this
---
I'm not dodging a question, I'm saying OP said one situation, not saying the entire game is broken. I'm assuming as well that you're also trying to tie in the other threads, but I don't care about those. I'm not spending my day reading other threads which are being updated constantly.
---
Holy fuck dude, they should be fixed right, are we agreeing on that? That's what I'm trying to say, not start some discussion. You say they are absolutely useless since they are unreliable, and I'm saying they should be fixed. Are you saying that they shouldn't be fixed just because they're never reliable in any game?
---
Not at all. Some games are designed to be esports. Counter Strike, the most successful esport around, would be utter shit if they designed the game around casuals. Like it or not Ubisoft is trying to develop this game to be an esport, so of course they are going to listen to the pros. Now how they listen to the pros is what matters. They should take in pro feedback, but how they solve the problems should be left to game developers. The same way they should listen to the overall community and then decide how they use that feedback.
---
No, you know exactly where they are most of the time and can generally get rid of em.
---
Why dont you just gas em smonk
---
I dont think so, they are very good for stopping flanks and stuff, if they made it do 40 damage its useless
---
Sure :)
---
People use claymores to stop flanks if people r able to just run through it, it would make it useless
---
&gt;do you need more reasons?
---
I just need one valid reason, because yours are not really convincing. 
---
Saying you can't compare two games because they are not exactly the same is not really a powerful argument.
---
Noooooic
---
Your welcome
---
Not good enough....
---
Except you're 3 years older than me! Congrats &amp; restecp
---
Bro you posted it to the discord and now I stumble across it on Reddit? Lol
---
It is, and it was meant to be
---
Hammer only lasts for like 20 hits
---
69420666777 renown?
---
You word that like it isn‚Äôt a 67% success rate
---
Don‚Äôt forgot almost everything with the gun physics and how recoil is ridiculously low/unrealistic for 90% of guns . Also, if you leaned left and right quickly back and forth and tried shooting a target 20 feet away, even if you were a SEAL in real life I bet you‚Äôd not put more than 2 or 3 bullets on target:
---
Source: own and shoot firearms in real life.
---
I think you only get infinite resupplies on Normal ftr
---
No I understand that rogue wasnt gonna make it anyways but I'm just curious as to why they did it this way instead of giving the team that was supposed to play them a win instead of nothing at all. I haven't looked at the schedule enough and the scores to see if this could make a significant impact on the season.
---
Siege still retains a huge playerbase
---
Yh it‚Äôs the worst coz you think oh we got a thermite this‚Äôll be easy then 5 seconds into the round he‚Äôs either dead or doesn‚Äôt care about helping
---
OK, so let's use your example of "two equally skilled players". They both peak down a flat hallway with perfectly equal angles. Both of them simultaneously land their first shot to their opponents head, but the recoil causes one players second shot to miss while the other secures the kill.
---
How did taking away one shot headshots improve the experience at all?
---
Drawings are good, Keep going. Though uniform shading would make it better. There's more shaded detail to the face than it is to the uniforms.
---
Sounds like a plan, good luck with the grindüëçüèΩ
---
Can you do this with more maps? Would love to see Oregon, Cafe, Clubhouse...
---
The problem is that, this isn't a civil discussion, people upvoting this post is already pre-occupied with the thoughts of agreeing to this mechanic not to be removed and they are downvoting whoever says otherwise. This is a such a big problem of reddit itself where your opinions whether it is right or wrong can get shutdown completely by majority.
---
Through out the discussion on this topic, people are just not providing logical arguments for this but based on fear of change thoughts, demonizing Pengu, associating with call of duty kinds of arguments and threaten to quit the game, so I will not bother to discuss any further, this discussion has already ended long ago weeks before, nothing is going to change because the number speaks, why would Ubisoft change things that give them no monetary benefit at the cost of man power and the potential of losing players? This mechanic is deep in the veins of Siege, it is too late at this point to change anything.
---
I also have thoughts of removing all ACOG from this game and replace them with the Gridlock M249 rifle scope except all DMRs, this Pengu guy also have same thoughts by coincidence? Remember, there are people threaten to quit this game if they remove ACOG from Ash, it happened, not the best solution I would say, but I could tell things are not 100% one sided towards the R4-C anymore. I know nothing is going to change at this point as mentioned, but I would still like to see this mechanic to be tested on Tachanka for him taking no damage multiplier on his head due to his helmet, as he would be the best candidate for this test since he's the weakest defender and he's a 3 armor which is the only thing that would benefit from 2-shot HS mechanic, it is not the same results as Blackbeard as his shield has very high threshold hitpoints. 
---
I'm going to stop here, because I can already see the overwhelming downvotes coming in my way.
---
Well, it is a work in progress. I planned on filling it all out eventually.
---
Smurf city.
---
The Glaz managed to down me the instant before walking into the trap; and yup, snagged MVP.
---
What about the blitz buff we all cried for?
---
I was solo queueing and the guys I was playing with were really nice, but I am a little salty to lose :(
---
Xurbdic called, he wants his joke back.
---
1. What? That's not even close to what I said. At all.
---
2. Okay, however lucky headshots can and will happen in a system that allows it. That's my point, it adds a layer of luck, however small, to the game.
---
3. I have said now 3 times he would still be overpowered. I do not understand how you have such difficulty understanding this.
---
4. I'd agree. The argument is mostly in theory anyways not a change that would ever happen.
---
5. I never said we would have a 2 shot HS system, you're making assumptions from absolutely nothing. I didn't even imply a 2 shot HS system.
---
Skyscraper is runnout city and the top floor has only one route across (Basically a slightly better Kanal). I dont think Chalet is bad per se, but I believe it has become outdated.
---
That hostage must be super confused
---
ubi : At year 5 , we're reworking tower , bartlett , favela and ranked , tachanka is still a meme and ash gets it's hitbox fixed
---
It would be great, part of the reason why I like this is that it gives better map knowledge, and you can find angles you never knew existed
---
It makes the game so much less fun. There‚Äôs a reason someone asked this question. Because they may also be having less fun because of the shitty matchmaking. It‚Äôs an issue for my friends, an issue for people playing the game, and it‚Äôs an issue for the game itself if it wants to have longevity of any sort. It shouldn‚Äôt be an issue for friends wanting to play together because they can just drop elo a bit, or help their friends get better at the game. There needs to be some sort of matchmaking balance in this shitshow. Using one that everything else uses will be perfectly fine until the rainbow team makes a better system.
---
&gt; Would you think people would be on board because ‚ÄúR6 needs to change too‚Äù. There‚Äôs no good reason why 1 shot headshot shouldn‚Äôt be a mechanic.
---
We're not asking this change just for the sake of it, we have actual arguments (here are mine if you're interested : https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/7jzahi/can_we_have_a_civilized_discussion_about_headshots/ )
---
Lol I guess he should go play another game then ))
---
Y‚Äôall amazed at 2 hours when the real professionals can do this for more than 8
---
I got gold 3 playing with one or two friends in every placement, that‚Äôs a good start. Now begins your road to plat, every season I‚Äôve hit it I was not placed in platinum to start.
---
Almost every fps shooter game on hardcore mode (All CODs, all battlefields, counter strikes etc.)
---
Are you telling me that the skeleton key is refillable? Like you can fill it up with 21 shots after using them all?
---
I agree it's an issue, which is why I agree it needs a good solution.
---
How can you look at this clip and think, "Everything is working as it should be"?
---
Wow, wasn‚Äôt really expecting this post to get as big as it has. Thanks everyone, I‚Äôm glad you all seem to like my work.
---
I hope this leads us into an era of weird different menu musics going forward. Can't wait for barbershop quartet siege theme, or acoustic jazz siege theme, or slamming brutal deathcore siege theme.
---
Please do the uruguay one!!! Im uruguayan
---
I hate it when people whip out a fucking lusion or spas 12/15 to get a drone, bringing me to 40 or less health. I lower them but not kill because that's just another person down, and then I die because they killed me for shooting them twice as warning shots.
---
&gt;How can you look at this clip and think, "Everything is working as it should be"?
---
Where have I said everything is as it should be?
---
How can you use that data to make a statement like "there are hitreg problems"?
---
I think its unlikely they will take it out, as they specifically chose Chalet for the Beginer Playlist.
---
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
---
Pengu is not wrong, but removing one shot headshot would be detrimental to the game.
---
Truth be told, 1 shot headshots does "cheapen" the game. Strafing in and out of cover while pre-firing is one of important "mechanics" of R6S and since any gun can be used to one-tap a player, deliberately choosing a slow but hard hitting gun is akin to "nerfing" yourself. 
---
This very obvious if you compare the competitive pick rate for the 417 compared to the F2 or V308. 
---
Guns with low recoil and high ROF are in the meta because they can both one-tap and spray&amp;pray headshot better than the others. Notice how all the "fragging" operators except Glaz and BB have such guns? That is how Ubisoft balances operators with less useful gadgets.
---
1 shot headshots has been around since Day 1 and players love it. The increasing playercount does not lie.
---
If you are in to reflex/arcade/arena shooters, you want fair games,you want skill to be the most important winning factor, but players who are attracted to R6S are not interested in watching human aimbots out-shoot one another.
---
R6S is a tactical FPS, you are not looking for a fair fight, you want to outsmart the opponent and you will "cheese" them if you have to. Pro-league competitions are exciting because of all the creative/funny ideas players cook up on the spot to deal with the unexpected.
---
Ubisoft can't make a game that caters to all players.
---
I always tell myself I‚Äôm not going to solo q and I do it anyways and get deranked
---
Jesus
---
Die
---
Just get good at the game its not that hard go back and play cod if you wanna shoot someone in the head 8 times
---
I don't think that it would have any impact because in the end it doesn't if every team has 3+ points or not, their positioning isn't gonna change.
---
Only a few guns in those games have 1 shot headshot kills, mostly snipers so i dont think you can really call that games that are 1 shot headshot-centered since most of the guns in the games are atleast 2 shot headshot.  
---
(btw I do play BF and CS)

Who broke his shield

i don‚Äôt recall lying? but ok

Geoff is cute

Yeah I technically will have sea of thieves and state if decay 2 already ay e a couple others)

But it doesn't apply to all games

You got a stroke mate? ;) I finally got to play on Outbr.. I mean Outback btw
---
While I don‚Äôt like spawn peeks as well, I can‚Äôt understand how is it toxic. They are a part of the game and you can easily counter them.
---
I also think developers didn‚Äôt put spawn points on roofs because it‚Äôd be too easy to approach the building so they kinda thought of spawn peeks possibility. I may be wrong though.
---
Saying someone is saying something they're not isn't lying?
---
None of my friends were on at 5 am

like I literally woke up, opened chrome and did that. Never again. Well...I am doing that now buuuuuut

If you can get to plat, you can get there again. If you can‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt belong in plat. 
---
If you can‚Äôt help out a friend, then that‚Äôs being a shitty friend. If they don‚Äôt want help, then just play casual.
---
The only thing i think would be acceptable for any rempval of one shot would be if the very few weapons tgat have an extremely high fire rate dealt lile 70 or 80 to the head (so pretty much getting an extra 1 or 2 bullets into their pinky finger would kill em
---

I'd assume that sledge and a shotgun would be useful here as well, or does Sledge's ability not get restored when you refill ammo?

I wanted Tachanka unicorn uniform so I ended up buying all the packs cuz I got him in the last 2 packs :( same for Dokkaebi dive suit in the summer packs, had to buy them all cuz I got her in the last one...

Very original and thought out ash kill cam spam post. Thank you for your contribution by adding more to the siege community with this wonderful addition.

As he said, there's no limits, but in my opinion that needs to be fixed. Don't be a plat 1 who plays with bronzes.
---
I‚Äôm telling the truth ahahaha. 100 100 horizontal and vertical sensitivity with 50 ads allowing me to flick around before I killed the mozzie. I‚Äôve been playing for around 3 years and it‚Äôs just muscle memory now
---
Yeah, I was thinking more gold 2 with silver 1
---
he's right, ik it seems ironic but you just need to git gud
---
Just because they are rare and satisfying for one side doesn't mean they should be in the game. Pengu got a lot of hate for bringing this up but imagine playing at a high competitive setting and you get eliminated just because the other guy got lucky. In a competitive setting this just does not fit and as for Mira, wallbangs should still do damage, just won't kill the guy instantly because of 1200 rpm.
---
No problem, I bet fuze mains are going to have a blast.
---
You can‚Äòt
---
The rim of your acog completely gif him.
---
no
---
No shit it's hard, I never said I could. But what would take more effort, holding your shield like you already are, or literally swinging it your side as you run.... yeah.. continuing to hold it as is sounds more realistic huh? I never said they should be fast, and as much as I love blitz, he shouldnt be fast, he should be a 3 armor 1 speed. And are you seriously saying to remove Ballistic shields because they dont make sense? They most certainly do. The problem people seem to have with shields, especially blitz, is they dont know how to act.  I play alot of blitz and I'm fairly decent with him, you need to know what to do. Rushing a blitz is almost NEVER the right thing to do unless there are two or more of you. If you have c4 or impacts, use them. I'm more scared of impacts because they can usually drop me to below 25 health.  C4 makes me turn to avoid or back up to avoid which give people a chance to either back away from me or get an angle on me. Dont use your lack of know how to play against shields as a means to call for their removal.

Open Concept floor plan
---
Mute jammer
---
One shot headshot irrevocably breaks the game balance and design in the favor of some attributes.
---
For example fire rate of a weapon becomes extremely important as well as weapon recoil.
---
While stuff like weapon damage drop in importance because headshot=death regardless of what damage or armor.
---
Slow firing weapons become something that is undesired and unwanted.
---
Peekers advantage and lag advantage becomes a MAJOR advantage instead of minor because the first player who sees the other one headshots and wins.
---
Over long distances weapons like the MP5 SMG with low recoil are actually better than marksman rifles and big rifles because headshot=death and rate of fire + no recoil is king.
---
Going for the logical center mass of the target as is the usual in armed forces is actually awful in Siege because center mass isn't the instant death headshot.
---
The list can go on and on and on but overall headshot=death is a very problematic mechanic and is very cheap because its all about who happens to get that bullet into the enemies skull first - nothing else matters.
---
That's fine, but stop when you hit Plat 3, because people can call you out for it.
---
I agree. And I hardly use her.
---
&gt;&gt;This is a weird and crappy idea
---
you said it yourself
---
Wallbanging will not be useless because you are still doing damage through walls it's just that you will not insta kill anyone at full hp. If you were to know the approximate location of someone and shoot through the wall and make contact, this will still give you an advantage because they will lower in hp, or if they are low enough they will go down.

Which operators is it this season, and what is the price? I‚Äôm actually interested in having some more skins if they are for ops I like.
---
It‚Äôs still a gunfight and the fact that you‚Äôre only doing body shots means that you will most likely not kill them if you‚Äôre using an smg, hell why not just make walls give you damage resistance

I get all that, I'm just really opposed to monthly subscriptions to apps. I would gladly pay $15-20 in a one time fee but I will just avoid the app. Hope you understand.

Because of the annoying menu music that was only funny for the first 3 days?
---
Exactly.  It everything needs to be super realistic, otherwise there would need to be changes to Operators like Lesion, Echo, Jackal, lion, finka, alibi,  tachanka,  etc.  But hey, at least you're reasonable... one guy here replied and suggested the removal of all shields because "they dont make sense" and tried implying itd be easier to swing the heavy ballistic shield around at your side as if you had nothing and were just running.

Hello Alien_Mafia, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bbampv/adding_the_rainbow_six_siege_soundtrack_to_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You used to be able to tho I though

If your search goes over 1 minute restart it

Because loot boxes = money.

Well on console ,95% of headshots are luck . I feel removing it would let the player with the better aim win a gunfight
---
Why yes, of course! It's the best cover you can get!

But you didn‚Äôt say remove OSHS for just automatics, you just said remove OSHS.
---
Cool, thank you.

Is this on PC?

I see your point but then who actually finds this funny then? Who does it appeal to? Rainbow coloured stuff and silly music, how humorous.

Theres a reason those maps were removed for ranked. Because theyre unbalanced. Trust me u wouldnt want to play House or Plane on Ranked. Its hell against decent teams.

---
What's the problem here?
---
Do favela next plox
---
No offense to you, or anyone, but justifying the retention of the OSHS on the basis of it being "unique" is silly. The OSHS doesn't separate Siege from other FPS games‚Äî rather, the operator abilities, objectives, and gameplay do.
---
Removal of the OSHS will still reward the player that shoots the first shot, so long as equal skill is preserved. There's more to aim than reaction time.
---
No, they are both defenders.
---
And not a single Montagne main was happy this day ;-; (They are seriously really good though &lt;3)
---
it's pre mini-rework tachanka

This map has a shit load of spawn peeks not to mention you get can get put against diamonds and plats. I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs a better than newcomers.  Newcomers teaches you the 3 main maps of the game
---
Bruh.... u thinks THAT is bad? When i was bronze, i had some bronze teamates and we got matched up against 1 diamond and 4 copper 4‚Äôs that we fake coppers. It was so dumb, we got absolutely destroyed.
---
Ouch
---
Because people like you keep buying the whole collections. Even though there have been some exceptionally good skins in these premium packs (lesions especially), I have never and will never spend money on gamble packs.
---
I address per-gun balancing near the end of my post. My primary argument against the OSHS still stands as the low firerate of DMRs significantly lowers the effect of RNG.
---
Ubisoft must stop listening only to the pro players or make decisions by the pick rate of the pro league. Instead they should listen to the community as a whole and take decisions whether to nerf or buff a particular aspect of the game or the operators. The one shot headshot is part of the siege experience. If they remove that then a whole lot of players might not experience Siege as its meant to.
---
I'm not gonna pass that up lol. What's your Uplay name? I'll probably be on later tonight

i once got this stupid Rook legendary 3 times in a row aswell. that was... lame.

That was wrong of you, and I expected as much, which is why I addressed it.
---
This has to be the one and only good post on here. I made a post just explaining this, but I was also explaining about the bugs and hit regs. All I got were toxic redditers and toxic siege players telling me my opinion is garbage. I explained about taking her a Acog away was a dumbass move for ubi. I even said if it comes to it, ubisoft needs to give their game away to Bungie or someone that has knowledge of good development. All these nerfs like lion and Ela, just unreasonable. People complain about because they are bad at the game. People like me or if u played since beta, we've been practicing over and over and over just to get better at this type of stuff, and now ur telling me ur just gonna take it all away. Ubisoft has no comment sense on what to do. They say they fixed one thing, but it's still there the next season, and the season after that, so on so on.

Post your gamertag OP

There team was very rush friendly with frost being the only counter and in my opinion also the easiest to counter
---
The short explanation for this is the fact that these maps have been proven to be extremely unbalanced. Typically these maps are so defense or attack heavy that the winner would likely be determined by the order of attack or defend. With that said, house is a good ass time to play on. Hope this clears it up a bit
---
Why?
---
Well it's quite rediculous to say that they wouldn't without it.
---
Event week. Also what the other guy said.
---
The maps in newcomer are often called ‚Äú the easiest maps to play and learn‚Äù. They are a good mix of roaming and anchoring and have some uniqueness ( chalets garage site) and they teach you to play a balanced team comp.

Well I have a smurf in newcomers to pick up newer people and help them learn the ropes. I‚Äôm a plat 2 level 254 on my main and I never try in newcomer. I just run around the map and meme while giving call outs and gentle suggestions to the actual newcomers.

Why would they delete it it‚Äôs such a good feature
---
Just delete Blackbeard
---
Oh no he has ballistic shield  the bullets don‚Äôt work oh god oh fuck
---
&gt;you'd exchange the frustration of getting HS through walls over the frustration of not getting a down or kill after landing a HS
---
If someone is not downed after a HS you have a very simple solution : keep shooting at him.
---
If you're killed by a random shot, there is no solution or way to prevent that, you did nothing wrong, it's just bad luck.
---
&gt;The change would also result in multiple balancing issue for weaker guns, the silencer attachement and even penetration damage. 
---
Yes, some guns would need balancing, so what ? The meta is always changing anyway.
---
&gt;I'll be pulling data from guns available and gun stats during Velvet Shell for this next bit. [...]
---
First thing, the 2.5x multiplier is just something I said, it could be x3 or whatever, and again the whole arsenal could be retweaked.
---
Tehn what ? We have a huge disparity between guns ? Well that's precisely the point. Now DMR have a place. 
---
Or you can make a weak gun on purpose (it was not really possible when 1 shot could kill you).
---
Think about the shield, quickly after launch, the pistols were made stupidly inaccurate because otherwise shield were OP as hell, so firing with the shield up is now 100% luck based. Without the HS rule, you could have the same hip fire accuracy for pistol with or without shield, so the shots you would land would be shot you deserved, without the shield being too oppressive, since they could one tap you (and yes, pistols should be nerfed in that case, but it was stupid to have small calibre handguns as powerful as a full length assault rifle anyway)
---
&gt;So now that everyone has had their voices heard, can we move on? This ain't no religion, it's simple math.
---
You just show me some random numbers by using the random value I gave. Maybe it could take up to 4 HS to kill someone though a wall, so what ? Is it such a big deal if you don't get killed immediately though a wall with the least effective weapon in the game ? And again if it is a big deal, then they would just need to change some values.
---
You didn't proved anything, and you can't really prove me wrong since what I'm asking is to give the idea a chance by testing it on the TTS, because no one, not even me, could really know what effect it would have on the game without actually testing it.
---
If after testing it with different settings it turned out it was detrimental to the game, then yes, we could move out.
---
But for now, the hostility is indeed bigotry, people are against the change because it's a change, and your comment about frustration is very indicative of that. Why is it frustrating to not kill someone with a HS ? You can survive a headshot in pretty much all shooters, even on very low TTK one, how is it a problem ?
---
It was exactly the same thing with respawning in BR, people were against it simply because it was a change. And now that it's in the game, I'm pretty sure the same people would get angry if someone proposed to remove it.
---

Start in chronological order so you get the ops faster. Since they started going for the route where "the longer an opperator has been out the less they cost." Buck and frost are not bad starts either. They are decent characters and are especially good on certain maps.

What ? What matchmaking ? There's no matchmaking in this game. I realized that in White Noise. I (higher gold in terms of skill and strats) managed to get up to Plat 2 by playing against people mostly from silver2-gold3 (maybe one or twice I got real plats, but for about 100 matches in season I had mostly low golds as enemies).
---
I was playing with friends, but everyone were plat 3 or higher. Imagine what enemies felt when they saw that they got matched against plat 2 and 3's while being in silver/low gold. 
---
In this season the situation is reversed. I'm in gold 3 right now but I'm being constantly matched against plat 2 players.
---
If you‚Äôre still learning the maps, get out of ranked
---
Was meinst du?

I think it's a cool idea, but there could still be different possibilities to change the drones abilites (if needed) and what about the quantity, does Quake have only 1drone or what would be your thought about that?

My thoughts, not only on this operator but all, no one should be able to deal damage through a reinforced wall. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea, but he does sound super OP, I like the idea over all though.

Truly no empirical way to prove someone is a smurf without having someone at ubi review demos personally. Any automatic smurf detection system is going to get false positives once in awhile and unacceptable.

There are just not that many long distances to maintain against a blitz, I dont know what to say myself.  There are many maps where yeah you can hear a blitz coming, but where do you go?  The room you're in is 10ft by 8ft, and his flash can get you from that far away, and the hallway outside of the room you're in has an ash holding it because Ash mains are always fun people.  So he comes in around a corner meaning you have no opportunity to shoot him, you toss maybe 1 impact nade, and then he flashes and kills you from across the room because it *is that easy*.  Also all this ignoring the fact that blitz can hipfire his pistol which while not always accurate will eventually probably kill you.

They should remove it based on caliber and armor. When the MASKA on tachanka gets penned by fuze's 9x18 makarov it just makes no sense.

This really wouldn't change much except buff 3 armor attackers like fuze since defenders mostly use smgs and attackers mostly use rifles. Though it would also buff defender lmgs, pdws, and carbines.

it woul deal ONLY when the op is in contact woth the wall. It won't affect Hibana, and it'll be pretty hard to hit something trough wall. Also the shielders could simply throw these off, even before activation, but faster than lesion's gadget, and with smaller exposure.

Modern headgear can. But only about ‚Öì of the ops wear any kind of helmet - including Fuze's paintball mask and Mozzie's bicycle helmet. So they'd have to redo the vast majority of ops

Alright I'll give you that, I should have quit before the edit, my being a dick doesn't help anything. That being said, if I can take the heat out of it and just discuss the syntax: Me removing that part of the sentence doesn't change anything. There are two ways to say it. Your way, "Even if flashed as you knife Blitz" makes the flashing the subject, so the rest of the sentence ("that‚Äôll deny him the ability to hit you") refers to the flashing. If you reverse it to become, "If you knife him even as he flashes you", then the subject is the knifing, so the rest of the sentence would refer to that.

Here‚Äôs a tips on how I got good at the game that you might find useful: only play bomb, play around 20 minutes of lone wolf t hunt on house and on easy(classic works the best), watch the pros play and listen to their tips and do what they do(they are pros for a reason). Change your sensitivity to 40:60:40. Get used to it, don‚Äôt change it at all for a while. And just invest time into the game.
---
also living in my head? LOL imagine thinking that, whilst downvoting all my comments. jesus christ you have brain damage.
---
I would say that the deagles weakness isnt its fire rate but its heavy recoil (in comparison to other guns)
---
But yeah faster fire rate means more chance of headshot.  But i wonder statistically across copper 4 to diamond, what percentage of kills are actually headshots.  I would imagine its less than half.  Probably by a wider margin than you might imagine.  
---
I have 6,869 total kills, of those, only 2,867 are headshot which equates to roughly 40%.  I am by no stretch of the word great, id say I'm "above average" and the highest ive placed ranked is gold 2 but I could have realistically pressed into MAYBE Plat 3 on a good day possibly plat 2 if my group was on a fucking hot streak. (my casual MMR is in that range).  Meaning that I would estimate the average split is somewhere between that \~40% range, which doesn't factor in DBNO finishers that were easy headshots, and other fuckery.  The problem is FAR more complex than me or you can really dive into and I would assume that ubi has all the stats and are making their judgment calls off of those vs either my idiot comments or yours (not actually calling you an idiot btw, just being cheeky)

Sorry that was long winded.

I‚Äôd love to be able to watch dokks, vigils, Ela‚Äôs etc in the game, I shouldn‚Äôt have to go to YouTube. Back when I first got the game years ago, those videos were the most hype thing about buying a new op

You know the movies gonna be great when you see that startup screen

Good for you man! Keep on grinding try playing ranked to improve your skill.
---
Exactly. There are so many counters to the Castle, that it's more a pain in the ass for the defenders, than it is an obstacle for the attackers now. 
---
It would be interesting to have it strong enough so that only hard and soft breachers could be able to break the barricades.
---
DMRs do need a buff
---
The corpse launch out the window was the best though.
---
Just gonna say. You say Im bitching yet go onto to do EXACTLY what you said I was doing ??? Just a little bit of a juxtaposition in your argument dont you think. This is just never going to be productive as neither of us are going to move on the basis of our arguments. So on that note goodbye üëã üëã (I could manage to even bare to read half of your ‚Äòessay‚Äô so maybe you should use some more captive literary techniques, just a hint...)
---
At least you did it on this reddit, other Reddits would have torn you a new one
---
Muzzle break?
---
Wait Ubisoft has a dad?! Am I the only person that didn‚Äôt have a dad?!
---
That's for Terrorist Hunt only. It doesn't work for multiplayer.

What‚Äôs next lion in a zoo

That‚Äôs not even how bulletproof anything works. There are broken ribs, bones, etc., from getting shot in the chest by a 7.62. Now how is a helmet with thinner plating going to defend your head from a broken skull, etc.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm currently a Silver 3 so I‚Äôve definitely got room to improve :)
---
UNO!
---
Maestro's video is my absolute favorite
---
b-but sir, guns emit heat
---
you stole this
---
What platform are you on?
---
You somehow made kapcan more scary. And love it
---
Appreciate the tips. I‚Äôm under 20 total matches played in casual so I‚Äôm still learning the ropes.
---
Ricochets.

It‚Äôs the Mexican operator with Tortilla chips for Y4S3
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. If you are too, feel free to add me
---
What‚Äôs you say mate?!
---
so basically custom settings on lone wolf
---
Okay. Thanks!
---
I will kick your ads
---
Are you speaking about run-out at round start? Just don't rush blindly! Are you talking about run-out later in the round to get lazy attackers? Use claymores or get a mate to watch your back...
---
No I don't think it's a bad map at all...
---
This shit would be better than black ice if it had a little more ice to them cause those colors go nice together
---
Honestly you‚Äôre just a softcock

As me being Chinese this makes me happy

Also whenever you extract Mr. Bear she says that the Rainbow Pals successfully saved Mr. Bear, but would need restitching

I played it once, and I disliked it

Did... D-Did... How could he... Such a profanity
---
Tachungus...
---
The frost mat kill at the end with the grunt of pain killed me
---
I‚Äôm sure if you keep trying you‚Äôll be just fine. This game can be quite punishing, especially when your not in a great mindset
---
Next step is porn i guess.
---
How do people make these? I have no idea

Thatcher: Where‚Äôs my fookin hot pocket

Before the non straight mods remove this, I want you to know I appreciate this post op :)
---
Just doin my job
---
really?
---
Awesome play indeed! But it's kinda strange that your opponents didn't went out trying to kill you when you are repelling.
---
ah, and i like
---
Man is that a new shield?
---
Imagine already bringing AIDS character but still lose
---
But still tho, good job for showing them who deserve gold!
---
Why is everyone ignoring the fluff flair?
---
Very detailed... Guessing all of that was leaked somewhere then.
---
Sounds like the best elite there's been so far besides Lethal Citizen Glaz.
---
Yes this is so fucking annoying. Every single post about this has to do with their internet. It‚Äôs bullshit that the mods don‚Äôt remove these posts
---
Be nice to me smolboi
---
I think she can be sexier
---
These clips look really funny, you should give streaming a try, or maybe YouTube, I‚Äôm sure content like this would keep people pretty entertained on those platforms.
---
Haha
---
I agree with you.
---
IK RIGHT
---
I can be, her shotgun can be great and can kill almost everyone on the enemy team at times but it's very situational and you better hope they don't know you're there which they always seem to do. Ela is just really in a bad state and really if you look at it is almost Tachanka levels of badness. Her gadget can help with information but it can't do it effectively Lesion since his mines have little marks above them and when one goes off you have a better knowledge of which one did and it also delays the enemy much more than a grzmot mine as well. Hopefully one day she can be somewhat decent again because right now that's far from the truth.
---
You can change a lot of weapons select fire to a three round burst.
---
i love it the drawing style is beautiful thanks for putting iq im her main like you ;)
---
Did I have to use the /s in the title? it was not a panic knife, I had no idea she was gonna fall in front of me, my intention was to peek right since I was getting shot from that direction.
---
How many hours do you work in a week?
---
If you kill about one drone per attacking round in average you complete the challenge in less than 7 hours of play time. It's only one hour a day...
---
same bud
---
ah, can't be bothered to properly edit videos or thumbnails consistently.
