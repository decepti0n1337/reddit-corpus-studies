Really? Ok thanks man

Im fairly certain i kill 4 shots on 3 armors with suppressed d50

That second photo is my face before pelting my teammates with my cams
---
Lmao saw like 10 times. Laughed every time.
---
Thanks
---
it‚Äôs fine as it is tbh it‚Äôs just a no skill brainless gun any one can use. it‚Äôs only good for like 4 m outside that you can easily kill them as it won‚Äôt do much damage
---
Yep
---
Wow, guy on Reddit makes fun of another redditor for not being invited to parties. Isn‚Äôt this the most ironic comment of the year.
---
The damage in the foot is extremely low. I once tried with the magnum ish of nomad and I shot a good 4 shots in the foot and he didn‚Äôt die
---
Hi r/ihavereddit
---
bruh my do all of you guys sound like 5 year olds ü§î
---
No you're ignorant. They don't license half the guns in the game that's the whole point. That's why the tweet you posted is BS.
---
Do people actually get paid to cosplay; or is it just a hobby?
---
Just like a lot of Valkyrie players
---
AHH right, I mean that's also easy isn't it? They push from two angles, they can't aim and get stuck in doors and walls although I agree you get basically no renown
---
When I play its lion instead of blitz
---
lol
---
This community is toxic and so are you. This post was made to hopefully spread a bit more positivity
---
Wow okay
---
Well you can‚Äôt regenerate Hp. The first few rounds are easy but maybe round 3-4 they start aiming for the hostage and they destroy reinforced walls. Solo it‚Äôs really hard but in a squad of fairly easy.
---
WHIS GONNA COME OUT THE POKEBALL?
---
dont play if you get butt hurt and this post isnt gonna change anything so what even is the point
---
Ok this is cute.
---
ah i see. well your missin out on some quality fun mdude
---
The Deagle suppressed is a 3 shot to 3 Armor, 3 Armor + Rook armor, and 2 Armor + Rook Armor. 
---

---
1 armors take 100% damage, 2 armors take 90% and 3 armors take 80%. 3 armors + rook armor take 64%. Rook armor upgrades armor one class.
---
Edit: also, shots to anywhere besides the head do body damage. No limb modifiers.
---
Just for fun :) some people get paid I think but for like appearances and tabling at con or whatever

Do you mean the green shirt because that‚Äôs a cat tent and the fluff is my cat the bag is from shopping because I had to get some new cloths otherwise you the other cloths I guess are blankets and the only cloths on my floor aren‚Äôt even in the picture
---
That‚Äôs just great. One small gripe is the handgun should be in a drop leg holster not a waist hight one.
---
This artwork is very very beautiful. Alot of thought and design when you making this. 
---
Can i use your artwork as my profile picture at uplay?
---
Improve interactions between her and other ops, duration, the actual inner workings of her gadget etc. 
---
For example, I wouldn't mind seeing what she'd be like if her HEL presence reduction allowed her to bypass traps while walking. Then lower the cooldown to maybe 6 seconds. 
---
With all the trap ops being present, she'd have a much better time overall. Plus it links up better with her having weaker weaponry overall. I think its a fair compromise
---
Wait, what if instead of exploding and igniting fire, it instead lets out a emp blast that destroys and disables gadgets?
---
That derp face is almost as adorable as the bloody corpse of a hostage.

&gt; the only thing as bad as structural/institutional discrimination that has resulted in enslavement, murders, genocides, various crimes against humanity, and centuries of economic and social privation is being called a manlet.

---
'Why Spanish' can mean several things, so I'll answer each (likely) possible meaning.
---
**Why are you taking Spanish?**
---
I was, originally, planning to get a BA in History, which required four years of Spanish. After half a semester, I decided 'fuck it, B.S. it is!'. It is a free six credits, though, because I can pay $85 for the class I skipped (placement test).
---
**Why do you go to Spanish while sick?**
---
It amuses me when people react to me being a dick.
---
**Why are you doing it to spite your Spanish teacher specifically?**
---
Because her class is moderately hard, and I am a petty fuck (/s).
---
See reason 2.
---
How old is that screenshot?
---
People are way over reacting. It‚Äôs not pay to win unless you‚Äôre blind as me nan.
---
A meme I actually laughed out load too. Well done.

"I've been having an itch for a super tactical FPS" you won't find that on siege. Not anymore.

Quite epic

how

Whats your view on tactical FPS?

Get creative and stop ruining siege for everyone fuckin ubi

Console Marley inbound, stand back

Something that is not run and gun, more methodical.

Hey, that's a really great cosplay! And an incredibly stupid face too, just like me! Incredible job!
---
when the cosplayer looks better than the in-game character
---
Just because they are a pro doesn't mean they are always right. I would be interested in seeing the data behind player numbers in each region, how many are playing ranked, and how many are in each group and MMR and then maybe I would be okay with it. I would rather face 5 stacks than 40 minute queues.
---
I'd like to point out his name is literally narcissist
---
That‚Äôs racist
---
Plays games as recruit
---
I'll ask Bandit where to find some
---
Lol, thanks for pointing that outü§£
---
It could be significantly longer. I used to wait 30 minutes for a solo q game on CUS at plat 1 because the playerbase at that MMR was so small.
---
Siege pretty much is run and gun even in ranked, up in plat 2-1. Most players up there use mouse and keyboard, all they do is run around and headshot you before you can react. Casual, I don't think most people play it properly, way too toxic. 
---
Look into insurgency sandstorm, coming out for console, not sure about the release date though.
---
Just put some arsacyclopentadiene in it and you're good
---
Very adorable, 10/10 cosplay

That will teach those kids in fortnite costumes

Now you‚Äôre thinking with portals

No problem. Have a good one!
---
Capi' and the BOPE Boys are playing
---
Can you PM me a link to the glove you got? I was curious about them, as well.
---
Rank?
---
So you would rather they make drastic changes to every single operator who is viewed as too strong or too weak and completely change the entire meta every time they do it?
---
us broke bois gotta represent, ya know.
---
Sick
---
Like I said in the post. If we wanted to make it a better meme gun, there are better ways to do so. ACOG won't change much about the "holy crap this thing is trash feeling". If anything, acog would make it feel worse as recoil is more intense with acog, and you would be more likely to engage at a distance where the dropoff is in effect.
---
Im not sure what u mean by press a swctond button to cancel, in advanced deployment you literally press mouse one to place gadget and if you leave mouse one before progress bar is complete the animation is cancelled.
---
But one taps and headshots would be so much easier, with a two-shot gun you don‚Äôt really have to worry about recoil when it does so much damage and the drop off doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a headshot
---
"now the teamate who came to help is dead, because nook sprinted to a corner with her ability on"
---
Remember this part in your dramatization? Sprint means sprint. Maybe change it to walk instead. Hence why I said she would glitch and you'd hear her.
---
Region, platform, rank?
---
&gt;excessive
---
Sorry - just hate dumb people
---
Fucking best thing I‚Äôve seen all day. Love the face üòÇ
---
Looks like one of his legendary skins
---
Ubisoft/Battleye has been very effective overall. And making the MMR adjustment only affect you positively would degrade the correlation between rank and skill
---
French detected
---
I played with someone that setup a knife macro
---
That‚Äôs literally the point
---
Man they foregot those safety sizzers that she had
---
Hit em with that crouching-and-staring-at-ceiling-with-cam-in-hand walk.
---
well its not like choosing yes to intentional actually does anything. Its just a placebo. Think back to before RFF was a thing. Could still get one free kill consequence free, now you are just...shamed?
---
Damn. All the 8 month old memes are coming back
---
Unranked is a mirror of ranked, minus the MMR. So if there's something in ranked, it has to get in unfanked for complete practice.
---
Plus, what if the 5th simply doesn't want to surrender? He can't quit, else he'll be banned. Maybe you do, but when you don't have a 5 stack, these are things you have to live with. Not everybody gets frustrated easily, and would prefer sitting through the entire game for warm up than Leaving early. 
---
The only solution to your situation is to get a squad.
---
What the what
---
Well we can‚Äôt ban him, we can‚Äôt black list him in order to not play him. There‚Äôs nothing we can do with this info
---
They have created 2 other modes for tryharding. Doing it in casual just means there's less fun in the game and people leaving the game.
---
3 speed is too much too quick. You either make him a 2 speed, or give him the pea90. Not both. No full auto ACOGs on 2 speeds.
---
It was never in the game
---
Lol imagine if a guy posted this how many comments there would be calling him a loser
---
Why do I have those gloves
---
Other than to try harder with a 4 man team that's all you can do
---
Warden could be a 2 armor 2 speed
---
Which they already do, Thats why majority of the defenders have underpowered primaries compared to the attackers and only have acogs on automatic weapons if they are a 1 speed operator.
---
of course there will always be exceptions to every rule
---
I was so hype for you!!! Then you did...that..
---
To each their own, but at least she has the sound queue, that‚Äôs what makes her balanced besides her guns. Before she didn‚Äôt have that and even then people thought she was ok, I know I did. Look at it this way, is she‚Äôs so broken then you would see here banned constantly both in game and in pro league, but she isn‚Äôt. Rarely she‚Äôs ever targeted for a ban.
---
Toxicity is not the problem, probably just a device temporary incompatibility, try restarting the game, if it doesn't work, check for headset and microphone drivers.
---
i want lobbys like this
---
They really need to increase that automatic kick timer. Currently if you are an attacker and you go to get a drink on the drone phase and doesnt move within 10s after the prep phase you get the kick countdown. 
---
Its way to aggressive
---
Yes he is
---
i lol'ed
---
Yes
---
Worst glaz cosplay ever. But the best Valkyrie cosplay I‚Äôve seen 10/10
---
As ive been saying since before his release, Warden needs smokes to make his gadget viable.
---
It allows better retakes of plants, provide a way to push back enemies advancing in fear of being in his line of sight, and allows him use of his gadget on his terms 2 times in a round.
---
If he isnt going to have the mobility of others with metered gadgets such as Vigil he should at least be able to use it in situations he needs.
---
Thanks dude! Appreciate it!
---
It's a clay pidgeon hunter suited for boys at the range. It's a silly gun from a time long gone, only suitably for a game of trap or skeet.
---
Can't ban echo if there is no echo
---
If perhaps people didnt have to spend time pointlessly with the stream open for content we wouldnt have that problem.
---
Its funny I see Interro pointing the blame at those spamming, as opposed to pointing the blame at the reason that brings people into it.
---
Yeah mate Not the only one here 
---
I checked twitter but I had no luck there 
---
Hope this passes by soon 
---
Good luck!
---
I mean, ranked bans are often taken up by sillier bans like ying, jackal,blitz (even now) and rarely ever logical bans like lion, nomad, Monty, Hibana, thatcher and so on. You only get reliable data from PL, and she's banned a lot.
---
I'd like to see the amount of control she takes away reduced. gridlock is a much more fair and balanced version of nomad where even if the sound cue is given away, the defender isn't defenseless when the attacker is notified and then engage. I'd like to see some range reduction, or a simple noise increase. Even if the defender can hear it as clearly as a nitro cell, the fact, that they have to reroute in fear of getting bonked is still powerful enough.
---
Nah he ain't.
---
Nice.
---
Choco chipd please.
---
I was very tempted
---
Dear god please no
---
I‚Äôm almost to the point that I memorize the link and become immune to it
---
At least the paper shield will tank more hits then blackbeards shield himself.
---
Nomad has great guns imo and on many maps you can block runouts with her gadget so ur Team doesnt need to waste the claymores. Nice op 10/10 would buy again
---
Thanks, now I hate how much I want to have silent footprints with smg-12.
---
1:04 *Robert B. Wilde credits song plays*
---
He‚Äôs broke and super easy to play change my mind
---
casual is too boring and whenever I go into casual, they played like its a fucking ranked game, they spent near 5 minutes to end a single round. Ain't nobody got time for that shit, I might as well go into ranked if I wanna feel like I'm playing casual because it ends faster.
---
‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt hear a thing.‚Äù *CRAAAAASH*
---
Valkyrie on the enemy team:  
---
Valkyrie on my team:
---
Honestly, I think the c75 is better for 2 reasons, its easier to control and it can be unsilenced leading to higher damage but equal damage when silenced
---
*NO BAN GANG*
---
It's personal, don't know if you play pc or console, but for me they are both easy to control.
---
Forgot clashüòâ
---
Hmm, maybe that‚Äôs something they can try in the Test server. At the moment though most people seem pretty content with her in her current state. As you said ranked bans are in reliable as they are mostly comfort bans (sadly), and the data from pro league isn‚Äôt all that well in terms of representing how strong she is in the regular game against regular people. If anything I think she need to be kept this way, because as it stands I can‚Äôt help but think the game as a whole is a little defender sided and ops like her, Maverick, Jackal, and the new Lion are needed to even the odds.
---
Ok. Here you go
---
down voted no deagle
---
Bro, you have no fucking idea what race I am or where the hell I'm even from lmfao, and I'm gonna be real with you: I'm not reading all that.
---
All of that is totally irrelevant. Just produce the literature that supports your claim that "heightism" is somehow presently and historically as severe with as severe as racism.
---
Just a tip. On your phone you can use the Volume down key to take pictures. That way you don't have to remove your glove.
---
Monte is a Support op he shouldnt be able to fuck everything up by his own imo
---
I agree, I‚Äôm a console player and personally don‚Äôt like the unpredictability to the smg-12. But that may have changed because I haven‚Äôt used it since operation Chimera
---
Tachanka:
---
Give Tachanka the spear 308. Turn the turret ---&gt; auto gun (2x) that you can put on walls and floors that have a 10 round mag (and do 3 dmg) and have an Acog similar scope. Allow him to use to shoot and after out of ammo is used as normal cams. Same properties as Bulletproof cameras. (shot from side = destroy, meleed = destroy) Same shooting destruction as Maestro cams.  Go from a pure anchor to a plant denial operator. Keeps that idea of a mounted weapon. (Mobility Buff + cams + anti plant denial = good new Tachanka)
---
Warden:
---
Give Him Echo's gun(?) make it so his glasses are more powerful the longer you let them sit in rechange mode (so if you let it change to 20%, it would be very cloudy, almost no difference, while a 100% change gives full visibility) Keep him at a 1 speed 3 armor (balance to new weapon). Same "main gadgets". 
---
Just Some Ideas ;D
---
BOSGACOG
---
delet dis
---
I don't know actually, never played console, but they changed a few recoil patterns with ember rise, give it a try!

No offense but tachanka uses none of this

Where is your m870?
---
I would not say you suck thats a great start and its a good looking signal disrupter
---
Hell yea!
---
In my left hand. It doesn't look exactly right, but it's close enough. I have it tucked under my armpit.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to try pc but I don‚Äôt have the money or the patience to start my progress over. I think I‚Äôm gonna buy a keyboard and mouse adapter to try keyboard and mouse on console. But it won‚Äôt be in casual or ranked, it‚Äôll be in custom games with friends or t-hunt
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/cE1qU88RU6GEbkwAA
---
That‚Äôd be pretty OP in my opinion. Just removing the movement penalty would be plenty good
---
Oh, so you buy them too?  Makes sense.  I'm thinking about buying them now.  I've been saving them and I'm up to 21.  Seems that I earn the packs about twice as fast as I could buy them, which honestly isnt terrible.
---
These are wut u call the wonders of siege. Getting mad is part of the process and improvement and acceptance that these things happen are the only way that youll fully enjoy this game. Its not always about carrying that feels good its the feeling u get after the ban that your ready to play that makes the game constantly replayable.
---
I think you need to stop posting garbage.
---
Not even the elite. Still great tho
---
Or Skyscraper. I like Oregon but Chalet and Sky are maps she can be too prevalent on. Mainly because they are attacker sided, more so then Oregon. Those are the maps she is most powerful on. Every other map she‚Äôs a hit or miss, and that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt see much talk about her, because she isn‚Äôt overly oppressive on the rest of the ranked pool. Map design is what makes or breaks an op like her.
---
Is that Black Eye something you bought or made? If made, very impressive stuff.
---
Yeah please don‚Äôt turn this game into fortnite bs.
---
Him having smokes doesnt make him self sufficient it provides an alternative and efficient counter to quick plants and retaking objectives. Just having smokes he still cant rotate with the gadget on.
---
The whole "its attacker only " argument is silly trying to prevent a reasonable and effective balance because of players arbitrary views.
---
And you can't compare Glaz to Warden as Glaz doesnt have to recharge his scope unlike Warden.  That alone is a huge detriment to Warden.
---
Smg11 or mp5?
---
Because they'd probably add dumb shut like Fortnite emotes
---
I did this yesterday with an ads and I lost it üòÇ
---
Absolutely,
---
I really hoped i get some kind of more interesting missions or something alike.
---
I mean (probably hate example) fortnite got missions like "go to place xyz" "do this or that".
---
I understand we can't dance unr some lightposts.. but how about some special missions like "win a match with an AR33 equipped" 
---
"Use all your breach charges in a round" 
---
"Get 2 kills from above" "Open up 4 reinforced walls" "Get 5 kills over higher distance"
---
"Kill 5 enemies using explosives"
---
I am a person which always did those weekly ubi missions.. but even they are poorly creative and mostly every week the same.

Echo and Caveira are hit or miss in my lobbies. What I really don't get is the banning of blitz and clash all the time, which is what I normally see. Blitz used to be fantastic but his ADS is terrible now. And Clash is easily countered.

That would be a legit defender.  Honestly think it‚Äôs a good idea.

Why did you shoot them, you should have t-bagged with them and then killed yourself

Is that an Instagram signature on Reddit? No dignity.

We‚Äôre you in ranked because if so you aren‚Äôt supposed to leave then because it‚Äôs not something you do in ranked no matter what unless a hacker is in but other than that you have to stay or you will be punished and it will give it to you after the ranked game is over and the reason why is because it‚Äôs a competitive game mode not one to leave also once you leave no one else can join but you or who ever has left so you can rejoin it if you lag out so just don‚Äôt leave a ranked or unranked match because it doesn‚Äôt provide a good time for the other players even though for the enemy team what if they want a challenge and want to fight a full team

Nice

How about no? Its different if you're in a 5-stack and you all want to throw - but if you have a random on your team who's trying to win, and you're sabotaging their game, that's bullshit no matter what their rank is.
---
This looks amazing good job, but I would recommend moving the antennas a bit further apart, not much tho, like maybe a total of a quarter of an inch all together, but other than that it looks legit, just gotta add some minor details and it would look exactly like the real thing, good luck!

Actually, they already are rotated in. 1 month rotation, remember?

I appreciate this

Already everyone does

I love it !

Good, cause I know this sub sometimes gets hostile when talking about changes to the season pass.
---
Thanks for the upvote! However I don't think it's fair to shame cosplayers who do lewd cosplays cos I do those too. Taking your clothes off doesn't just have to be for 'validation' :) sometimes it's just fun!!

Awesome!! Best I got was a 4K with the shotgun.

Also you think they‚Äôll add R6 credits to buy the next Pass with or am I reaching to far?

Your team, killing. Yes that is indeed worse.
---
Nah that might be being overambitious. There's only so much generosity a business can show.
---
Hopefully, the paid BP will be a part of the pass. If they do it, I think  they'll stop there, and probably cut something out of the pass, like maybe 100-200 less credits or something, or no seasonal uniforms.
---
done

NEver seen that one i think IT is new

thankyou!!!! stupid faces are my forte

Ya, I tried going over top of the bumps to smoothen it out but jus ended up making some larger.

Is it the Penta skin or the acog?

I get that you wanna cosplay the character and all, but wearing the SEAL Patch when you‚Äôre not actually a SEAL is kind of stupid. Just like some Air Soft dude wearing a Ranger tab when he never went to ranger school. Just saying it‚Äôs you‚Äôre free to wear it. But you probably shouldn‚Äôt because you didn‚Äôt earn it.

Yes but I was tired when I posted so my title was trash

TEMPLAR GRAND MASTER, monkaW

That‚Äôs what ubi did with warden and the MPX. And look at how that turned out

Since when was the mpx never used?

I would not trust Ubisoft to be even somewhat competent if i was you

Missed opportunity to selfie with the black eye
---
He‚Äôs part of a minority of 3 armors that dont have acogs, and for people that dont aim for the head. It‚Äôs a frustrating weapon to use
---
F
---
And if it‚Äôs sooner, that still counts but I don‚Äôt see that happening until his alternative is out (if that happens in season 4) because people have rose-tinted glasses on and can‚Äôt see the issues
---
Was so excited ever since they first announced the battlepass and now this mess makes me so sick of r6 despite how much i love this game
---
How about something a little more realistic. I am truly not a fan of holograms, electroshields and lasers.
---
I mean they haven‚Äôt done badly balance wise with the ops in the game currently, but yes, they are reluctant to nerf some of the more popular ops out of being scared to offend many many players who play them
---
At one point they can‚Äôt add all the events, they take data because they are special maps so I doubt they will be able to add back all the events.
---
It‚Äôs a guy in a dinosaur costume
---
It‚Äôs a bad gun.
---
Aww makes sense. You look just like her, I always had a little crush on Valkyrie ;)
---
But we Germans complain about everything free
---
Lmao thankyou!
---
Im gonna be honest here i don‚Äôt think Glaz should have ever been nerfed and i don‚Äôt think shields should have been nerfed and i don‚Äôt think the smg 11 should have nerfed but i don‚Äôt get a say in what is buffed and nerfed so i don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm talking about it but they are making a lot of unnecessary nerfs and buffs
---
Yes, I missed some of the events when I go on vacation and always wanted to play them, it would be fun to 1v1 friends in them.
---
Would be cool if they had a weekly rotation on custom maps like 1 at a time
---
These aren't the only pics I'll be taking of Valk, don't u worry
---
Don't forget thatchers hk33 that isn't licensed
---
Smg 11. Kicks like a donkey but at least my team mates wont harass me for using it
---
I dont know am just asking ,is it really that easy to fall if we stand like a statue playing Alibi.
---
Yeah, I mean if you know the spray patterns of the guns you could turn a corner and die instantly, especially with the 1 shot above the chest...
---
~~blessed~~ *silver* ftfy
---
He does feel week when you use him, but up against him hes good. Hes a strange op
---
Bring a nickle tap your feet
---
2 bullets is 2 second chances where you would have more than likely died. So no, hes fine as is. Does exactly what he is supposed to do
---
Jivil
---
It's definitely dumb you have to adapt your playstyle so much to get value out of her and Idk why the ubi made the Mp5 good at longer ranges that's just odd game design
---
Smg's are classified as close range weapons due to lower caliber and shorter barrel length which limits the range especially in games
---
Raaarrw
---
Yeah, maybe tie the points gain to multiplayer TH only?
---
Or maybe just a fixed value per TH game, so you don't get more points for lone wolfing
---
Put matte clear coat over it.
---
I'm tryna figure out why he got garbage bag for pants.
---
When he was released his shield had like 600 or so hp, imagine that, he‚Äôs peaking a window and you literally cannot kill him, having a 2 shot advantage is pretty good, that‚Äôs 2 headshots they could‚Äôve had on you
---
That's the problem with this generation of operators, they're always on their phones
---
A 5 year old can draw this and for a 5 year old its probably a good effort. Bit not for a grown ass adult. 
---
Spoiler the game is not for 5 year olds.
---
I don't think BlackBeard is weak. I mean, you just need a single bullet to take an enemy down if you hit the head, but BlackBeard can "take" four shots on his head and keep alive, that's strong af. You can use him to hold rotations or to piss off the enemies with a dangerous upside down rappel. I think he's not weak, he's not strong as he used to be, and that's a good thing.
---
If only valkyrie looked that good in the game. üòÖ
---
a stupid operator. goes completely against the one shot headshot concept. whoever uses him is a cheap player.
---
Sneaky beaky like

Its getting worse and worse the more kids find out about reddit.
---
A five year old can draw the Mona Lisa, what is your point? 
---
Spoiler your intelligence IS for five year olds.
---
Yes it does but in csgo u don't have scope hitting someone in long range and getting headshot are lot harder in csgo then it is in siege.
---
he he
---
lemme get dat
---
Excuse me, r/rarepuppers is the best sub on this damn site.
---
My points still stands that csgo is lot harder in terms of gun skills but siege is lot harder when it comes to understanding maps and overall stuffs.
---
it's the magazine from the ak47m that nomad uses, so....

if anything blame ubi for making non curved 7.62 mags :p

Yea, I thought about shortening it. Never touched any video editing software though, but I think you're right.

I get the Maestro statement, but the one in garage is ignoreable because we didn't have any hardbreach.

Oh that‚Äôs gonna be a lot of pain D:

Not always people leaving, it sometimes puts you in a match without accually joining the match. Can't blame someone for leaving if they didn't leave the game.

You realize that my Mossberg 590a1 is...a milspec combat shotgun right?
---
As in currently issued? 
---
You realize that it came with sights and I do in fact need to use them in order to hit what I want to hit right? 
---
You realize that I shoot clay pigeons with my shot gun and that is relatively difficult to do without practice correct? 
---
The fact that you're saying hip firing a shotgun is totally legitimate and that you don't need to aim proves you've never held or fired one in your life. 
---
I keep my shotgun in my safe, but I can take a picture of the ar-15 a d the magazines I keep near.my bed for home defense if you'd like...

I get both sides of it.

I can't stand the guy who stays on Ash when we still need a hardbreach or Thatcher, it's also frustrating when I'm in a really intense close game and I have a guy on my team who keeps picking ops like Glaz and Caveira  and literally contribute nothing.
---
Thanks!

Play whoever you have fun with. What‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter. In the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game and having fun is really all that matters.
---
Firstly, well done! It takes a lot of time and effort to make content so bravo to you.
---
Constructive critiscm time though. I get that the style you have is a meme-y/troll-y style which isn't my personal favourite thing but you should absolutely do you and there are moments that are funny and clever (like the Snoop Dogg bit) BUT the audio really needs balancing. It's obnoxiously loud at times like with the K.O. with the knife on the Maestro on the stairs. 
---
You have the game audio loud which I think is important as it let's your viewers hear footsteps too so they can anticipate what's going to happen but as the songs and background things are going on it takes over the game audio  rather than the game audio being muted, to allow for normal levels of 'music' over the top.  
---
Have a think about it, if you were watching a video would you want to keep turning it up and down to hear the footsteps but then down because your ears are being screamed off. 
---
You could probably do quicker cuts/get rid of the dead time by speeding up sections where nothing is really happening too.  
---
But yeah, good stuff!
---
Jager and Maestro. Both give very useful gadgets, good guns (there's an argument for the 416c and ALDA being the best defender guns), and are very good in their respective ideal rolls (Jager as a roamer, Maestro as an anchor).
---
As much as I like Vigil as a roamer, he's a very selfish roamer unlike Jager with his ADSes. Frost just isn't my cup of tea, but randomly placed frost mats seem to work pretty well.
---
Its almost like this game is coded
---
I usually ban lesion and no attacker, I like playing echo in ranked
---
YO
---
Imo mozzie. A lot of rotation ability. Use of drones to watch your own flanks and great guns
---
Spoken like a true Jaeger main
---
&lt;333333
---
Did you really say Kapkan is better than Ela lmao?
---
Lion duh Amaru is straight up useless in most of cases
---
I highly doubt that they would remove his LMG, cuz that's what makes Tachanka special. Also, if they removed his LMG, it's basically just deleting Tachanka as a character.
---
Acog matters in most of the maps sure some maps like Oregon or outback don't require acog but maps like bank or consulate u definitely require acog there is a reason why jager and bandit lost their acog from defense because it was way too powerful and ads also matters because then u have to hip fire to kill someone and hip firing in r6 is lot worse than csgo.
---
But how would they rework Tachanka without removing his lmg?

Think the artist is TB_Choi.
---
Okay so I pick Tachanka in ranked when he is called for, I have certain rooms and areas where some ops are good and some aren‚Äôt, I feel that everyone is like this. Kapkan is better for bank basement than frost is, Glaz is good if they are aviation room in villa. For Tachanka my biggest use comes living area/library on villa, set him up watching the hall on library anyone comes near you pop them. Also learned to post him in the downstairs bathroom on border as a hall deterrent. He may not be good but he‚Äôs our lord and very situational.
---
Kapkan has amazing guns, great pistol. Not the gsh. Secondary gadgets that actually help him. And a gadget that not only does damage,  not only is more plentiful. It's not as mobile but also is louder, creates a tiny but effective smoke screen that can blind the enemy. Hmmm better in almost every way.

Have my upvote

We were down 1-2 on plane and it was me vs 4 guys I rushed with capitao and won and they were using echo! Like chill out lol, then I spawn peeked with doc and got 2 kills but they planted  it was 1v1 and I couldn‚Äôt find it in time
---
Just the way doc is slowly running up to you and not shooting just makes me laugh
---
Yea I will. Just wanted to see how if other people would think that this is a good idea or not
---
Damn bruh at least come clean
---
Why are you writing these stories like they happened to me, they didn‚Äôt, they happened to you. Please use the first person
---
Because I solo queue sometimes? Everyone isn't always on at the same time. I do play ranked, in a 5 stack though. What if I only have time for a couple quick games? I don't get to play because I don't have enough time for ranked and don't want a meaningless penalty? Not to mention the ddosing is making ranked unbearable anyways. 
---
You want to play the game like an idiot, that's your prerogative, but don't expect other people to be forced to play like a moron just because you do. Casual is there to try new strategies and warming up, not for you to sit there with you dick in your hand waiting for everyone to conform to the way you want to play. I don't get what you don't understand about the fact that you're playing a competitive game, if you want something that focuses less on thinking you should go play call of duty.
---
I‚Äôve seen some concepts on him getting the russian lmg as for a primary and probably a huge deployable tower shield or something, but another moving LMG on defense is too much
---
Yeah that was the problem I just had. I mean I'm not to worried about since I've 3/5 (the one I was unable to join being one of them now) of my placements so far but I think it's something that needs to be brought up to Ubi so they can fix it.
---
Why do you not like our clips?
---
Yeaaaah, no. Came after the shot.
---
This didn‚Äôt really have to be posted you could just go watch the video.
---
Ahaha.

Kind of what happened to me but I was solo queuing but I tried to reconnect and it just took me straight back to the main menu.
---
How'd you know hahaha

Most of the famous youtubers are good enough to do it but because everyone does it became stale

Ok ok but it do be lookin fresh doe

Actually... I kinda like it.
---
back in my console days operation health was straigh blue screen after blue screen... thanks siege
---
There is a speed and reaction time difference that PC players are used to playing with and seeing that a controller can't seem to achieve because it is capped at that speed. So it tends to get slow for PC players when they see it.
---
It's personal preference.
---
Mines connecting just fine.
---
Actually there is still a way to do this. I wont say how here though, dont want to spread the disease.
---
Thank you good sir!
---
Bad internet? lol the game kicks you itself what are you on about? relax fangirl you are gonna get the coreross charms
---
That‚Äôs even worse
---
Not being a toxic piece of garbage
---
Gotcha, no worries! Thank you!
---
No advantages at all. People say targets are easier to hit with stretched res cause they are bigger but they don't take into consideration that everything becomes bigger, not just the players. As you said it's all personal preference. I mostly use 4:3 but I sometimes switch to 16:10 cause horizontal recoil is reduced.
---
adidas krasovki
---
Damn that sucks, other day, friend and myself queued in and never got any teammates. Had to play 2-5 other team felt bad and forfeited luckily. There is still hope in this community.
---
Yeah me neither. I love the addition of Goyo and I just learned this
---
Never greed the last kill.
---
It‚Äôs the same like cosmetics which are only available through credits. I don‚Äôt get why people complain about it. It‚Äôs not like they want to lock new ops behind a pay wall which they could have done long ago
---
I‚Äôd be mad initially, watch the killcam, and be too impressed to do anything but commend you.
---
Yeah this makes them sound like a PC elitist no matter what way they put it.
---
I thought it was the constantly updating community group challenge.  Mine full on crashes my game, which has happened at some shitty moments, so I don't even look or add challenges or anything until it's either fixed or that challenge is over.
---
Only play ranked with people you know. Your fault this is happening. Make more friends
---
Lol. His ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù drawing has the same amount of upvotes as your gameplay lmao. Congratulations my guy
---
You be there for at least one round before people can kick you
---
I seen this and I was so surprised
---
I responded to an absurd opinion with an equally absurd response. Cry me a river, pleb tears taste so sweet.
---
Wow why didn‚Äôt I think of that, sorry my friends I played with aren‚Äôt on 24/7, or when I want to play. Not sure how it‚Äôs my fault a majority of my team left before a match even started but whatever mate
---
I've tried turning hit indicators off and stuff like that, doesn't seem to do anything.
---
Woosh?
---
To be fair, hes lied once that we know of.
---
But why?
---
You gotta expect that buddy. Trolls is fun especially when it illicits a reaction. Make a lfg, find some more friends in cas or unranked. The fact you haven‚Äôt found your own solution to this like most other people speaks to your generation and intelligence. Yes internet please listen while I complain about something I can easily prevent or remedy
---
Blood goes up. If you hit someone in the chest, it goes over their face. If you hit someone in the stomach, it goes up to their chest
---
Depends on the map and if we are defending first. I like to ban Thatcher if we are defending first
---
Because even with 25 mag in other shooters, FAMAS wrecks(requires a bit more skill though than in Siege).
---
Because it took me 4 years to play a terorist hunt, when I joined it was a hostage and a fuze kept killing him
---
Haven't they always been like that?
---
What majority if people use.
---
Because his role is to stop plant attempts so more hp is better than speed?
---
This isn‚Äôt trolling though they didn‚Äôt get a reaction because none of them stayed in the game I never even saw the people in the game I loaded in and it was 2v5 I literally was placed in a game I was guaranteed to lose
---
You can see it hit the chair

You misspelled Sirius.

**Title:** "Massive New Update Coming Out!"

**Video:** "What do you guys think of a buff/nerf to this operator?"

There‚Äôs a few. Badger, Matimio, and the commentary/tutorial channels like Rogue.

This though, it would cause more element of surprise to defenders and it would allow you to fight back.

Hello Chad
---
Different teams work on content and bug fixing.
---
I was just making a joke. 
---
You don't need to be sorry to me dude.
---
Ubisoft, it‚Äôs in the game!
---
I'm not a great player but I play more than my friends so I usually IGL, I'd say just know who's gonna be helpful and what your team needs, if you need a bandit, make sure your team picks him, make sure there aren't multiple players filling the same role if you only need 1 player to do that job, for example if 2 different players pick echo and maestro you could tell one of them to change 
---
If you're playing with friends just explain how they could improve and tell them what you need them to do like watching a drone/breaching a specific wall. What helps is always telling your team what your plan is and how each of them could help
---
You are probably correct. Unranked works on the casual MMR IIRC.
---
But it's clearly not working plus there are ops that do that job better then him
---
I love how fucked up Siege is. Everything works smooth until you decide to shot, or vault, or run away from gunfire, then magical "connection issue" icon kicks in so everyone can say, that you "can't" blame the game. It's almost like the game have built in active defense system, that gives dev excuse to not acknowledge the issues.
---
Literally, I feel like most YouTube channels that make mostly highlight videos are just Godly clones.
---
Vigil*
---
You are very close to truth. AS Val can full auto with –°–ü-6 ammo, when it is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED for VSS. Technically VSS can do it as well, but there will be a lot of gunpowder leftovers in the gun. 
---
AS Val is lighter and more compact version of VSS, with slightly higher gaps in construction and higher fire rate. Thats all.

I don't have any server issues, but I really despise this map. It's the worst map in ranked pool imo.

They are both horrible. Lion can be used at any time with an almost absolute chance of doing nothing. Amaru most likely isn't going to work either but if she does it changes the game but overall they're both trash or trust the others golds in the comments.
---
No
---
Why does the game kick you? It's either slow Internet or server issues and neither of those are on ubisoft so stop blaming them
---
I agree with getting rid of the damage on the zap, but she‚Äôs an operator that forces teamwork. If your team isn‚Äôt gonna play right, you‚Äôre gonna suffer.
---
stop when I'm confused and asking for an explanation? fuck's sake people are dicks for no reason
---
\[Suggestion\] Get the fuck out with Battle Pass altogether. This is a game we paid for, why does it have F2P like shit?
---
If they're considering nerfing Lesion by not having his initial Gu mine impact do damage, then I could see them doing so to Clash.
---
But, the difference between them is Lesion is picked, Clash has an awful pick rate, so I don't know if they want to do any more damage.
---
I could go either way with this argument.
---
What are these?
---
I've had server issues and hitreg problems 3/10 times I've played on that map this week. And *only* that map. And both teams noticed so it wasn't on my end. Like, just now I shot a rook 7 times, he shot me in the head 4 times and he ended up winning the exchange with full HP on the fifht headshot because the game just didn't work for a solid 4 seconds, and he acknowledged he hit me in the face multiple times because we were both standing still
---
Ahh so you haven't played skyscraper, chalet or outback?
---
The sound is the same. Nothing has changed. The sound system is different from most games. It travels through the nearest hole that connect to you. Sound doesnt go through things. The sound is completely fine for how they want but yes sometimes it glitches and nitros cannot be heard or prone people but the overall sound didnt change.
---
The electricity damage is nowhere close to 10 damage.  It‚Äôs more like four.  She‚Äôs awful on her own and only benefits a team when played with teammates who can back her up.  She doesn‚Äôt need a nerf, player‚Äôs just need to learn to fight her.

I hope that is his elite skin. Just him in a toga, but still wearing his helmet

It‚Äôs cringy how they had to throw the diamond and champion symbol in their videos as if we didn‚Äôt already know they were good. It‚Äôs just sad tbh

It‚Äôs just another source of income I don‚Äôt understand the hate, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre locking operators or guns behind paywalls, it‚Äôs strictly cosmetic, and you know what even more confusing about this post? It‚Äôs that the battle pass is OPTIONAL :00000 omg crazy ikr?!?!

You saying that‚Äôs a flaw? It‚Äôs a damn feature. If anything they should charge extra to witness it

No she doesn‚Äôt, she has the lowest win rate in the game, how does it make sense to nerf that? If anything she needs a rework because she‚Äôs horrible in competitive but just annoying in general

Also it‚Äôs 5hp a zap

I will download this game again,thank you!

Because this game is filled with 10 year olds that think its funny.

i was playing most of my games on ranked im silver btw follow my youtube @codywasabi for more funny videos
---
I don't even want all new guns every season for the rest of the game's life cycle. Just an Operation Chimera with Lion and Finka is perfect for me. They get reused guns, but they also get 1 new gun.
---
Pro League does make money of course but by far not enough for such a company. Siege is kind of ubis backbone when it comes to financially support other projects. In the end u i is a Company which is build to make money so...

You can roam with her and proxy around your mines. That‚Äôs the whole point of her, I would love for her to get a real pattern on her gun but she‚Äôs close quarters and when you‚Äôre close with her the scorpion is insanely good which is the point. The mines are one of the strongest defender gadgets in the game being able to deafen blind and slow down look speed. It gives you every single advantage in a fight it‚Äôs a smart gadget not a place and forget like Kapkan or frost.

Look at all his other posts tho
---
When you kill someone, sometimes they‚Äôre in the same situation as you and you just don‚Äôt realize it. 
---
When you perform an action in Siege, you see it faster than other players do. It could be also that the other player prefired your position.
---
do you know how can i share my animated cover in the site?
---
That‚Äôs true but I‚Äôm not talking about those situations.
---
She can only grapple to ledges you can rappel on, windows, hatches (death sentence if there's anyone in the same room as the hatch) and skylights from below. Again, there are technical limitations. Ubisoft made it work on hatches (not all of them, mind you) but if they want to program it to work on surfaces inside the building they probably would have to code every single map on a case by case basis for her grapple gun to work. And sure, frags would fit her kit but will they make her good? I doubt it. 
---
The real solutions are the following: let her destroy the window she's grappling to as she jumps in; decrease her vulnerability after she lands; or make her a 3 speed. Maybe all three, I don't know. Making her able to grapple to more surfaces would be great but I don't think it's possible to achieve technically or at least it'd take way more resources than just doing something more simple.

Same, I stopped watching Siege youtubers once the "memers" caught on. Youtubers like Bikini making whole videos about TKing people for no reason and their 12 year old fanbase copy them actively ruining the game. Hell you could even argue that Bikini is actively ruining this sub with his meme spam.
---
I guess it could work on console, i was thinking on PC.
---
Honestly there‚Äôs no fix. It‚Äôs all technical, idk how game development works. I‚Äôve seen this kind of thing in other FPS games like CSGO for example.

How the hell did you do this tho

An eye-opener for you: these "content creators" spend multiple hours a day playing game just to record enough footage to make a 10-minute youtube video to earn a couple of shekels. Not to mention there are just 2-3 somewhat decent moments in whole 10:01 video, the rest is filled with VPN ads, le epic funni meymeys, epileptic editing and constant earrape.

It's not that hard to look experienced if you are able to cut out 99% of matches where you get completely obliterated by actual players and show how you wreck  lvl5 newcomers playing from smart fridge through adsl using wii nunchuks as a controller.

It really is all luck when getting teammates tbh, if you want to get to a higher level i would advise playing we some ppl until rank plat to play with well rounded ppl
---
What about RAM? would 8 gigs work or should I go higher?
---
Players are wider and therefore easier to see and hit. It takes time to adjust to the sensitivity changes however. The main downsides are that people move faster across your screen (can be fixed by training your tracking skills) and your fov is lower (personally don't bother me at all).
---
Oh, and acogs go from "borderline unusable in close quarters" to straight up unplayable, but that doesn't bother me either.
---
Idc
---
I suggest you find yourself some squad mates. Depending on platform you can throw up an LFG and you can specify the type of player you want. Or if mics are required. But honestly I feel the same. I was playing yesterday with a plat 1 that honestly looked and played like a bronze 4
---
But you didn't get the same score, says so right there

How do I report an issue that I‚Äôve already tried reporting with no response
---
I've been appreciating Alibi a lot more lately, use her to block angles from windows. If you place the projection properly, the attackers have to expend utility to get rid of it or get spotted once they shoot or pass through it. Ela is good as a shallow roamer if you can pinch attackers to enter a tight spot and ambush them at close range. Overall they're pretty much at the same level with different uses. I'd say Alibi is the better roamer though.
---
idiot with the shield only had to walk up and melee you...

I meant stats, I was matchmaking into another game when i was posting this.

Oi cunt don‚Äôt watch my shit, how about you go get some co2 and a tube yeah?
---
I get that its more realistic or whatever but there has to be a line when it comes to game balancing. Surely I can't be the only one that is bothered by this mechanic, I'm sure this affects higher ranked players more than a gold like me.
---
See but that‚Äôs your opinion. Operators can be a source of income for ubi, but selling skins and packs nets them more money. If you buy an operator, you get their guns. Even if their new to the game. You don‚Äôt get seasonal skins and outfits automatically
---
YeeeeeEEEEEAAAAASSSS!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAASSS!!! YAAAASS!!! PUT THE BIZON IN RAINBOW SIX UBISOFT PLS!!!! I WANT TO DO OPERATION BULLET HOSE WITH IT!!!
---
That problem is easily offset by just paying at every transaction, instead of filling your balance. Though it is bullshit you have to resort to that anyway.
---
Guess I wont.
---
Maybe she could still destroy the glass on the window so sound would propagate. That would make her gadget less obvious but not to the point where it's frustrating to deal with.
---
Well PC was a fresh experience for me. When I finally got tired of console bs I swapped to PC and revitalized my love, not only for Siege, but for gaming in general.
---
A few tips aside from a fresh start:
---
-play more frequently. It will get hard to stay consistent on a game you play in spurts.
---
-observe other players, play with better players, and observe YOURSELF. See what other people do opposed to you and see what mistakes you made. Watch for killcams and see where you went wrong and work on not losing the same way twice. By playing with better players you ultimately pick up on better habits by learning how not to constantly die or lose over and over again.
---
-be patient. Kills do not matter in siege. It is a team game, therefore, your team effort is what wins games. If you are going 1-4 dont stress it. If you cant frag out swap off to a support role so you can help the team in other ways other than kills. 
---
-most importantantly, have fun. This game can get frustrating but it's a great game nonetheless. Avoid tilt, calm down, observe why something happened and push forward. The angrier you get, the more likely you are to make stupid risks in hope of turning things around and more often than not these mistakes will get you killed even more therefore starts the vicious cycle of getting even more mad. If you have to step away to regather, do so. Dont letnthe game get the better of you and enjoy it.
---
But the majority chose them. The player base of siege wanted pick and ban so there is no reason to complain. The ban system is also used to see which operators are too powerful and this is proved by them needing jackal and working on a way to nerf lesion.
---
I mean kill the rook with the acog p90
---
Oooh fair enough. I thought clutch was any disadvantage win like 1v2-1v5.
---

Lion can be abused to get to higher ranks and has a solid assault rifle, but Zofia is a complementary to anyone that loves fragging out, honestly you can‚Äôt go wrong with either operator because they bring something to the table and also Zofia is a good pick because she counter Goyo hard.
---
You seem to be making a lot of assumptions. First one being that ranked is void of memes for the most part. You‚Äôre playing against a CONTENT CREATOR. Their job is to entertain. And all you did with this explanation is prove to me that you‚Äôre one of the people that kill a great player or a content creator and go ‚Äúclip that‚Äù.  You beat someone on time and think they‚Äôre trash, that‚Äôs how your mind works. That‚Äôs all I need to know to come to the conclusion that everything you‚Äôve said is skewed. Not enough of anything to prove that someone is bad because this one person beat them that one time.

It's not broken. You should keep that in mind when peaking. The best thing you can do is back away from the edge you are peaking behind. It feels crappy at first but it's better than getting head glitched because the camera is on the side of the head and everyone just pixel peaks behind everything.

Thats a clutch...1vs4 is a clutch. 1vs5 is a ace clutch

Because just about everyone was playing ranked so they could boost off lower elo teammates and not just "playing with friends"

Hitboxes are not normalized, I don't know where you're getting that information from.

Caviera is an amazing operator, if you have good teammates calling out, combine that with a valk or an echo, ez interrogations, sure, her pistol nerf was a lil tuff but overall great weapon.

Vila is repeatedly played on proL with no complains about the map. If you consistently have issues with the map thats something on your end.
