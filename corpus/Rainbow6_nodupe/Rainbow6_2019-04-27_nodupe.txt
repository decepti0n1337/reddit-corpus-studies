Eh after the nerf/buff its fairly even

---
---
You act like your version of English is the original or something.  Oh wait...: shit.
---
Too bad it'll never happen.
---

---
Just like these things that will never happen.
---
Chanka becoming an actual viable operator.
---
1 speeds getting acogs back.
---
IQ getting her nades.
---
I think it's mostly because UN peacekeepers don't exactly have a good record when it comes to their deployments.
---
Salty?

If you have 200 ping and they have 0 ping, that means from their perspective your peak is delayed by 100 milliseconds. That is 100 milliseconds of advantage that you gain. However, the shot that you fire is *also delayed* by 100 milliseconds. That is 100 milliseconds of *disadvantage*. That's why peeker's advantage has absolutely nothing to do with the ping of the person peeking. It is entirely related to the ping of the person being peeked. In which case the higher your ping, the greater the disadvantage. There is absolutely zero advantage to higher latency.

Exactly like overwatch did with OWL
---
All starter editions were upgraded to standard
---
Impact.exe stopped working

This has been happening far to often recently with impacts, Hibana charges, ect.
---
they arent a counter terrorists tho lol they arent even counter insurgency.

Dang, he thinks he has it bad, he should try and come to console, we have all of that annnnnddddd people who play the game once a week
---
I’m allowed to voice my opinion mate. 
---
Idk what it is with people like you and “ew, you can’t disagree with me, how dare you think differently from the majority” bullshit, but it makes me laugh. 
---
Implying I change games over cosmetics, Jesus Christ.
---
Chalet kitchen for example, all you need is 4 reinforcements
---
Je ne comprends juste pas le but de parler en français dans un jeu où 95% des joueurs sont anglophones, surtout dans un jeu comme Siege qui nécessite beaucoup de communication entre les joueurs
---
Looks like a halo marine. Good job!
---
Imagine if Dokkaebi wasn’t a gun-toting high school nerd who prank calls everyone’s phones.
---
No that just means he went on drone killing duty during the prep stage. His ability only last so long/ stops when he shoots a drone. He likely saved his teammates from being identified. Or they had a mute...
---
it's not going down hill fast.. this is as low as it can go. and it's not gonna affect 80%+ of the community, but I do hope ubi does something soon
---
Lets do it for our kind
---
I understood what he meant I was taking a jab at the broad term reading.
---
K
---
You should also know that you can’t shoot through that window (Mira’s black mirror), until the red canister is popped. But it is highly recommended that you don’t pop the canister if you’re on defense.
---
How’d you get so many IQs in the game my team can only ever pick one?!?!
---
You could put attachments on outbreak recruits?!?
---
I actually really enjoyed the survey. It was really interesting and I could relate to a lot of things. Rainbow Six Siege being one of my favorite games, I am really excited to see another one. Almost didnt want the survey to end. Personal questions like my household income, age, marital status, and employment thing kinda had a scam survey vibe to it.
---
I love mozzies patients he’s just standing there like “come on ya fat fuk, get the damn radio to work at least” and I love it
---
If your queue goes past 5 minutes its because its bugged out and restarting it will get you into a match.
---
Your post has been visited by the clash doggo... you have the respect to post.
---
I feel like it's good to have slightly different options to different scenarios based off the team you're playing against.  I almost always go Sledge, but at times I'll switch to Buck if the other team is running Cav and I need to break a wall and then shoot quickly.  It's just two different soft breachers doing slightly similar things in completely different ways.
---
And people complain about the hot female characters.
---
Played a casual match, one round I picked an op and went afk for 40 seconds, came back and started playing as normal but quickly realised the rest of my team had gone recruit. Tried to run but they started shooting me and got domed without shooting back. 
---
Honestly so pathetic that people think it's cool to do this kind of thing. The reverse friendly fire does nothing to fix this kind of toxicity. You can still teamkill once or just do 99 damage to any team mate with no penalty. Of course if they're solo they could get kicked but when others also think it's cool to be a toxic shit they get away with it.
---
So we let players pick their loadout. More ammo or more throwables, no more locking stuff to certain characters, their equipment is solely determined by the space they have.
---
That panic knife
---
On new xbox accounts, only the season pass operators transfer over. For example if you had year 1 and 2 season passes on your main xbox account, you would have year 1 and 2 operators on your smurf. However, if you bought a bundle, it would not transfer over. As for the base ops, new accounts don't get those anymore.
---
Good for you.
---
More Shirt Spam
---
I would play with you on PS4  but I’m trash
---
Oh no.... No locking stuff?! Help! I don't want to get spawnpeek ace by bandit!
---
I dont plan on walking to the building while ADSed. Or down a long hall with 6 different angles. Faster ADS helps when you dont know where the enemy is.
---
But it could do so much better.
---
All they had to do was change the texture on her balaclava so it didn't look like rubber.
---
Lmao half of your comments in ur comment history is “F”. Welcome to reddit, you’re assimilating just fine.
---
Wait they should test in pro league BEFORE ranked? Are you saying ranked is more important then pro league
---
I know, thanks
---
I think that is called pulling a u/BikiniBhodi
---
Alright did no one else think that when it shows the valk? lol
---
Yeah that happens a lot I just panic and somehow live
---
fucking hell you wrote all that over a pointless argument about breaking barricades? lol
---
They get kicked anyway. Players should not have the power to kick at anytime. It is abusive
---
I was gold 4 once then I got put up against 3 plats and 2 golds my team was bronze I mean wtf?
---
I think that’s called pulling a u/BikiniBodhi
---
Thx for this
---
I'm well aware of that. It doesnt. If it ever goes beyond 5 minutes I reset it as soon as I notice. Still regularly taking at least 15 minutes to queue unless I get put into a team with the exact people I was just playing. Seemingly as if the only people online are 10-15 people in my skill bracket which just doesnt make sense
---
Im reserving the rights to repost this next week thank you, i need dem sweet sweet upvotes
---
People say this about all games at some point, and there is always some degree of truth towards the death of a game. But it’s this kinda of talk that digs it a bigger grave, the fact is it’s this stuff that makes people think they should leave games, they shouldn’t play the game and there -fore making the problem ultimately worse. Don’t let it get under your skin bois and grills.
---
Definitely read this as “fucked my way to my first Ace.” 
---
Two things ran through my head:
---
1) slut lol
---
2 I’m intrigued
---
People think peeker's advantage is somehow affected by the peeker's ping. They don't know how it works or how it manifests. Nothing has ever been done to address peeker's advantage, because nothing can be done. In the context of siege, "peeker's advantage" is a catch all myth that is a widely used excuse for anything not going a player's way.
---
Thanks for the diamond and pro league strat. I will never drone again in ranked or in cas
---
Bruh
---
Can u link a pic of it
---
Damn man recruit has the potential to become an actual custom operator, with exclusive cosmetics, voices, and being able to use attachments
---
Fuck it , mitosis time
---
It is a duty all  console players must do. Call it a dickhead move, but it's justice because they don't deserve to have fun, and their kd doesn't represent their skill. Every time you tk them, they cry inside because they're on the verge of losing their artificial 1.5+ kd
---
I've been team killed for missing default cams more once
---
Welcome to Purgatory son. You're here because you didn't do well enough to qualify for Heaven, but you didn't misbehave or be Bronze enough to qualify for Hell.
---
Its' not bad here, its' not good. Just is. Enjoy your stay.
---
Shots don't register, peeking around a corner when I don't register, I've got too many clips of this occurring so it's why I hate playing eu ranked.
---
I fully agree with this, I hate ranked because I solo que and I solo que because I hate myself.
---
Keep it to casters and small time community ones and it will do pretty good
---
Could also break open the top of that wall to the left for more sight for the cam.
---
I agree as well. The newcomers playlist only has 3 maps so you can learn them well but I wish that was around when I first started playing. I only started siege in November but I’m still not familiar with most of the maps.
---
PC
---
I think she should be able to shoot while shielded the same way blitz and monty can
---
Ahh ok that sucks
---
It’s probably more than that since XP requirements increase with each level
---
China and the Eu has the majority of the hackers btw
---
[removed]
---
Ughhh, r/punpatrol, hands up and make it quick, i wanna eat.
---
Lmao.
---
Witch hunting isn't allowed
---
It looks really nice on the SMG 11.
---
Uh oh the fun police have arrived, I bet you cried like a bitch after we killed your ass
---
I’m impressed
---
Cause most hyper aggressive teammates I get spawn in as Ash with the defuser, run in die and leave. I don’t want teammates like that.
---
I want this now.
---
I just want a 10v10 for like a day already
---
I got a faster ace haha   Let me see if I can post it
---
I'm pretty sure you guys are talking about 2 different games
---
I just wish you could place his turret where you would think it could fit, instead of the arbitrary rules siege dictates you place his turret.
---
Nope, siege, and it went into jackal needing a nerf, and lion needing a buff

Okay I didn't mean hyper aggressive like that I meant in terms of peeking and pushing solo for kills + drone work, also who tf lets ash take defuser?
---
What the fuck is that uniform top? 
---
This guy is supposedly in the military and thinks he should wear his shit all fucked up like that?
---
Apparently first thing I see is a beard...
---
Another problem: I have game sense but bad aim.
---
imagine commenting on a 2 month old post just to be a dick
---
It happens to the best.
---
Her core playstyle got nerfed? How on Earth did her core playstyle get nerfed? She needed to shots to down before, she still needs 2. Right now, she can do 2 further now. You should be happy that you won't be firing overglorigied confettis past shotgun range.
---
This is my way of thinking also, but I hate the most of the community in this game is win or be toxic
---
Matchmaking is 64 tick tho in cs
---
Agreed ive been called booster so many times, it not my fault my IRL friends suck at r6.
---
Oh
---
But the thing is almost all of Ubi’s games are multiplayer
---
Oh i know man. And in my opinion, it doesnt matter, when you play ranked you shouldnt be playing with someone that is that much lower of a rank. I say that because its RANKED! For no reason what so ever should a game be that unbalanced. If you want to play with your friends, play casual, ranked should be taken more seriously.
---
Up
---
had this issue for about 4days just fixed its self
---
Yea I think a PlayStation/ Xbox crossplay would be amazing. finally be able to put together a full custom match with my friends 😂
---
What? That happened to me!
---
You use the rest elsewhere. Big garage, for instance.
---
Like VG said, if you don't find use of it in site, use it elsewhere from common entry points that could at least even marginally delay attackers.
---
Don't you mean NSG?
---
four onety one
---
Seems to be pretty popular at least on console, haven't noticed any problems like cheaters or anything. Worth the base price at least (can't be that expensive anymore).
---
The worst type of person right here ⬆️
---
Community is at its biggest. Definitely not too late to join
---
Oh you meant Special Composite Group **of the NSG**?
---
Should have just gone with 51 Special Actions Group.
---
As much as i would love this to happen, i'd probably argue that that's the last thing Ubi will do, just because of the fuckfest that will probably follow it considering all the events in the past 20-30 years or so, and the preassure will come from many sides not to do it, so they will just not touch Serbia with a 20m pole. I'd say the same probably goes for all our dear neighbours from SFRJ, although i think it would apply less to Croatia and Slovakia for obvious reasons that they are much less contraversial even today (generally speaking in the public eye).  
---
Love the idea, but probably not gonna happen any time soon.
---
At lower ranks, yes.
---
At anywhere above gold, her shock drone is what coordinates in the strat.
---
Honestly if you're level 400 and not in diamond wtf have you been doing the whole time
---
The game has a very active playerbase (at least on PS4) and as long as you have good internet the game is very active.
---
What is it according to uPlay?
---
Did this happen before with someone or something? Cause i saved that pic, saw it yesterday and thought it would be a good idea to post it here..
---
IDK, lack of attachments and one of each grenade type don't seem very appealing either, especially when you have an ACOG doc spawnpeeking you from a Coconut Brah thin angle.
---
1.its called a macro
---
2. yah
---
Throw high and a bit pass them. Can't shield above
---
He’s wishing he was taller so he could reach it
---
I’m happy af
---
Then, don't play
---
Wow would you look at that
---
Guess what, guy
---
You can also have your tactical military looking gear ***and*** I can have my stupid unicorn/pink man bun gear.
---
I like the stupid shit. I wish there was more, but I’m not gonna fucking *reeeeeee* every time they add something that I don’t like.
---
Looks like he's being sucked off
---
Siege 0.1
---
BEST COMMUNITY EVER
---
Because it's a game you dumbass
---
this exact picture has been posted before. nice try
---
It gives you better angles without fully exposing your bodies. Especially if you crouch while doing it, in general makes you a harder hit. Some lean spots are so well you can see an enemies entire body and they cant see you. Just use it near walls as a safer way of peeking
---
shitbucket
---
thanks!
---
you know it!
---
My black ices: ots-o3 gsh-18 552 commando
---
You playing on controller fam?
---
The game is based on realism. I think this is a legitimate question.
---
Bullet peaking also used to move ur head a lot more than it does know so when its spammed thats y
---
I’d like to see how they get it back in the truck
---
Because knifing is extremely risky. The payoff is the instakill.
---
Two questions. How much do you play a day? And do you ever get bored?
---
“Based on” using a knife is a disadvantage in any game that you can kill someone from far away
---
I like gridlock. Great for denying reclaiming obj, even as just a time waster
---
im plat and I like twitch for her f2
---
from twitch or the game? and do you know why? just genuinely curious.
---
Yo look i am gonna check that pic again it happened with me Im not lying. It's probably my friend who posted the other one or something cause he's the only one who had that pic too.
---
How many times is this gonna get posted like wtf lol
---
Jesus take a freaking chill pill before I call ur mum dickhead
---
Fucking amazing, I run Valk on Tea Room all the time. I put 2 cams outside to watch Geisha wall &amp; both sides of the balcony for runouts. Put the 3rd cam in the hallway most times, but this is even better. I’ll definitely be using it
---
but also her shock drone can be very powerful. she's the best mira counter, and she can clear the attackers route of traps, cams, ect. but my point is that an operator's gadget isn't the only thing that makes them viable, speed/armor and weapons do matter.
---
Inb4 Blackbeard becomes just Kaid on offense.
---
Yeah
---
Why is this where you draw the line for realism? Your main throws soup cans that are full of needles and can go completely invisible but the fact that a knife could insta kill is what bothers you?
---
This is why I play on lower sensitivity
---
Do you not know what Steam is? It’s digital distribution platform. Like uplay but includes a wider range of games. Literally if you play PC games you’ve heard of Steam.
---
Ima try that now
---
t pas un anglais je sais tu aimerais mais ta pas eu la chance de voisir t parents, cest comme sa la vie, chaque un dois etre fier de son peuple et faire de son mieux pour le rendre encore meilleur.
---
 bravo tu parle une deuxième langue moi aussi et je parle aussi l'Espagnol sa m'aide quand je voyage mais mon langage cest le francais québécois, et je ferais tout pour aider cette langue, voir des vedettes qui a la première chance qu'ils ont ils décrisent a hollywood et commencent a chanter en anglais sa me fait honte. T pas oublige de vivre en anglais pour etre bon et fameux, mais le monde veu le chemin facile et vendre son âme et oublier le peuple qui les a fait grandir quand le reste du monde s'en calissé d'eux.
---
tu devrais etre fier d'Etre quebecois, comme un anglo devrait etre fier detre un anglo. 
---
tu sais pourquoi les anglo sont pas bilingue? pas seulement car ils colonisé plein de pays mais car eux ils ont pas honte de leur langue ils sont fier, voir du monde comme toi qui fait tout pour acceuillir les anglos et point que tu parle meme pas ta langue avec t amis car un anglo que tu connais pas online vas pas comprendre lol t pathetique mon gars.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
mais regarde tu peu toujour dénemager a toronto oublier ton passé ou quebec dire que t juste un canadien te marrier avec une canadienne anglo, et parler le reste de ta vie en anglais, si tu meme changer ton nom pour un nom  anglophobe et ton passé francophone va etre effacé.
---
choisis tu est quebecois et fier? ou tu veu etre un anglo? choisis et prend ce chemin. car un quebecois qui a honte  de lui cest une perte pour les 2.
---
It allows you to peak corners without exposing yourself as much, additionally it moves your head which makes you a little bit harder to hit
---
I’m lvl 500 with 12 hours
---
Imagine sticking a scope on the Deagle to balance the shield nerfs lol
---
Suck me
---
Thats gonna be a no from me dawg
---
Tacops trades fire rate and ammo for damage, blowtorch is supposed to be loud to open up angles that people will eventually walk into, not to surprise them
---
Because you can use cameras and flexible displays to make something mostly invisible like that. And needles that poison you is very real and much worse than lesions needles.
---
Kewl
---
What if you tried viewing each one?
---
He has about 3,140 hours according to r6 tracker
---
Cool
---
Ok, but, based on my understanding, in this game both PC and Console have dedicated servers, right? If so, that program can only pop up with the servers IP, and what's the point in nuke the sever out, or maybe on console they have client matchmaking? That would make more sense in DDoS'ing the enemy team
---
Man the new slinkys are pretty neat.
---
Everyone drives their drone under there so its not that hard to spot
---
You got owned libtard style 
---
***hueheueheueheueheueheueheheheehehehehhuu***
---
She’s scratching he bald ass head
---
Streamers don’t deserve to be advertised in game.
---
You aren't really stupid enough to think Quebec could survive as its own country right? You'd be hugely in debt, have no global power of influence, have to negotiate your own trade pacts, defensive alliances ect.
---
LPT: You can't shoot through Mira's windows..
---
Same man, they need to fix it... I want to play Blitz but lately I've had to take a bit of a break. Hopefully they do something.
---
Just solo q ranked and find people with mics
---
I'd let you flash me.
---
That's the one black ice I want
---
Important to keep this stuff in context. These issues aren't nearly as common as painted here, esp if you're not a Diamond, like 90%+ of players. "You can't even play ranked now" is incredibly hyperbolic.
---
That said, this stuff sucks.
---
On PC i either have a five stack or go in solo but usually I always voice chat and talk with people.  If they communicate or joke around with me I end up making friends.  I have made over 100 friends on Uplay from just shooting the shit and joking with people on siege.  Even on the other team.
---
Some people are just cancer, honestly the main reason I try to play only with friends so I can avoid toxic randoms
---
That ADS saved ur life lol
---
Nice looks cool
---
Honestly, that mouth hole balaclava makes anyone look goofy. Give her a regular balaclava and the old face model looks just fine.
---
its been redacted. deliberately left out to create mystery
---
No I think it was only September October and December, there'll probably be more later though
---
And to think I got to negative Karma by jokingly saying "Console Clips" on this page
---
Good game my good sir
---
Those tears are tasty
---
No I don't believe so, sorry.
---
Yeah. It’s not every game but a couple times a day ruins everything
---
They aren’t always “clans” as they could just be fooling around with the names
---
attackers wants to know your location
---
Did it come with the code? i ordered the vigil ine and it arrives in june
---
Sometimes Fraps can make overlays not work, if you use Fraps, quit the app and try it then.
---
You know what, it didn't. I thought there was suppose to be one but the box only had the figurine.
---
Twisted big thoughts*
---
Sadly, yes I am
---
Alibi, no attachments, lower quality, default everything, and has the projector under it( can drone it out)
---
How? Seriously the majority of people aren't going to go out and buy a mouse and keyboard. It's a bit hard to use mnk when your TV is 7 feet away from you couch mounted to a wall.
---
I got 3 consecutive kills with the Boss-G last Thursday. That cannon hits like a train.
---
I thought this was a slinky at first
---
3k renown? Oh boy....
---
My smurf account username is EnozFrumsOn, which is NoSmurfZone backwards
---
I mean, each level increases amount needed so i'd say 3 times as much
---
Did you even read the post? He literally was bitching about casual not being fun. Unlike you some of us don't actually have the time to play the game every second of the game so ranked isn't an option. Bitching about how casual isn't fun and bitching about casual   K/D are two different things.
---
Lucky lol
---
Boosters don’t affect XP, just renown
---
Guacamole_D1ck, the single most Irish man I’ve ever met.
---
If you go onto some of their Twitters you can see what their complaints really are. I'm not gonna take my time to search through them for someone who wants to make excuses for his own poor gameplay though.
---
It's a very on/off weapon, so to speak. I either do extremely well and hit consistently, or I can't hit the side of a barn from the inside. Still a blast to play for the massive oomph it has.
---
Let us know when you get a macro ban. this "device" is far easier to detect than most macros.... most macros add random variation to mouse clicks. What do you think Battle eye is going to do when it detects some idiot with the exact same click time between firing, farming renown.
---
I play with 200 ping. Peeker's advantage heavily affects me and has since the game was released, and nothing can change that. Players with 50 and less ping have no idea what it is, or what it feels like. They just blame it every time they die.
---
Ha! I see why you don’t come across many toxic players, because you are one!
---
Not in game, just on Reddit :) I only give callouts in game.
---
Wish I could upvote this twice, a lot of people take this shit way more seriously than it needs to be, and it's more than likely cus they're trying to copy all these YouTube and pro league guys.
---
The immediate drop off on the shotgun past 20m kinda balances it out.
---
I wish you would’ve presented this in a less whiny way so i didn’t have to downvote
---
Didn't know Blitz was **bold**...
---
1. Call me slow but I'm not quite getting the AC: siege joke.
---
2. What's your solution to the problem then?
---
It's balanced.  2 shot range is 19 meters.
---
Her last Nerf fixed her lol. Her gun was originally 99 damage and would take 5-6 shots to register even 1 damage. Her recent Nerf makes her perfect and a fun operator to play. I recommend learning to counter roamers, and common run out or rotations.
---
That would be a very hard nerf to an already unpopular operator...
---
😂😂😂
---
At the Time I regretted buying ying, but now that I have every operator I don’t really care
---
No one tbh. Even though I don't play everyone, it is an unwritten rule to own every operator. With exceptions of course
---
Although this reply is long overdue, not really. Mozzie is one of my favorite ops, when I said feminine I meant silly. Like how the assumed color for girls is pink. You don’t have to have a freak out over my post. It really just seemed out of place to have it pink. It really should’ve been something like Obsidian, Amethyst, Titanium, or Ruby. Just would look and fit better, if you don’t want criticism you really shouldn’t post this on reddit.
---
I play legit every one so I don’t care
---
IQ because it’s second nature for me to know cam spots on maps. After all she was only 500 renown so I don’t care
---
You'd be mad too if you were me
---
counter roamers by running around as recruit with a shotgun, just pray that you shoot first and let the hand of ubi guide your aim. bonus points for hipfire snipes
---
If you are talking about paid event lootboxes then I hate it. You should have a chance to purchase the item you want for a fixed price without playing casino.
---
rubbish
---
We only say say that if we were playing kaid
---
yea, remove the cock sucker. Reworked. Sheilds are for pussies!
---
Fuk Pingu.
---
Off the wall... But how do you get these emails? I got 1 the first season I played and haven't gotten one since?
---
Just bc there is a cn server didn’t mean he will stay there. You can change your server location.
---
How exactly? And how would the game or Ubi determine if the player is physically unable to use a controller? And even if there magically is some way to determine that it doesn’t mean they should be an advantage just because they are physically unable to play like the others.
---
Ok let's start at one. No it fucking didn't. Two having to lie about that is sad. Three answer me, are you a smurfing POS. Four I don't feel the need to edit as it had said K/D previously. Also why are you replying? I thought you don't want to deal with bitchy people.
---
There is only one operator worth maining {–}7
---
You’re rubbish.
---
Given during Operation Health IIRC.
---
Give us a one good reason of why
---
No. It's a headgear received during the Operation Health (Y2S2)
---
thanks
---
thx
---
Then you dumbass are truly blind. Like I said I care about the future. I don't care about my performance. You are definitely the one in need of Reading Comprehension skills.
---
Next time please inform yourself about the things you talk about. Yes, Sony officially supports Mouse and Keyboard, however each developer has to decide for themselves if they want MnK to be used. Ubisoft doesn't allow native usage, meaning if you just plug in a keyboard it doesn't work and you need to buy an emulation device to use MnK. Therefore it's unwanted by Ubi and illegal
---
well the thing is, I haven't changed any of my settings since I was playing pretty good earlier this month
---
What was it
---
I don't have it for 416-c, not yet
---
I have it for the G36C, feels bad.
---
What is your reasoning behind using the pistol?
---
I was the victim of that grief so I kinda hopped on then pain train a lil early. I apologize &lt;3
---
Welp my advice still apply. Take a break, i once slumped my way down to copper, and just take a break and finish up other games like borderlands 2. (great game btw, would buy the 3rd one) Then i was back to a more calmed state than previously.
---
Lol dude. U just proved my point. U wudn't understand my subtle insults (hint: its a few posts away, u didnt even see it). So there's no point really if u cant understand me.
---
Probably because of the same reason Thermite, Zofia and Thatcher are almost never banned. They're just an essential part of most strategies
---
If Blackbeard can exist in this game, then Tachanka should be able to roam with his turret.
---
wow that ig page is shameless
---
1. cropped the original artist's watermark
---
2. put their ig page as the watermark
---
Jesus, this community really is a toxic shithole
---
That's because I don't care for subtlety. If you aren't a bitch you'd actually insult straight up. Anyways if you want I can give you like 8-12 hours to come up with one while I sleep. Your choice really.
---
Finka, lion, ash, blitz and possibly ying.
---
The map pools aren't the way they're meant to be for ranked, Kafe, skyscraper and other trash maps remain there.
---
"Hurrdurr, i care about the future. I dont care about my performance" LOL. Lamest excuse. If u truly care about the future, u shud be posting in [R6fix.com](https://R6fix.com) or r/Rainbow6TTS, not ranting in reddit.
---
I've been sucking a lot lately too but I actually have a reason for. I've been working 10-hour shifts plus overtime. I get home want to sit down relax play something so I hope on Siege play a ranked match (not playing casual until Reverse Friendly Fire is active on the live servers) and then  end up deranked or at the bottom of the leaderboard with like one kill because I'm too damn tired and unfocused. But that doesn't mean anything to be 17 year old little fuckbois. I'm still trash apparently even though I work religiously actually contribute to society.
---
I do believe that the range is decent but I'd put it as close as possible. Try it in a custom game with a friend.
---
My mind is so fucked up from all this „made with mematic“ that I checked the corner on a frocking screenshot
---
Yes
---
yeah. i agree with your list.
---
oh?
---
It's Ubisoft's way of preventing players from being boosted by cheaters.
---
thank you:)
---
Who gives a fuck, right now the problem that needs solving is mnk on console
---
Well go complain to Microsoft and Sony because Ubisoft can’t do anything about it
---
No idea how that Lion got a headshot on you
---
I don’t give a fuck cos I’m on PC but ok
---
Exactly, we shouldn't be forced to do so
---
&gt;Answer me, why you don't care about the player base. 
---
First of all, (and once again, let me tell u) u are so presumptuous.
---
Game will not die just cuz a whiny few are turned off from Casual. U act as if ***every game*** in Casual, u get matched against a squad of Diamonds. No, it happens so **rarely** now, unlike before they added matchmaking in Casual. *Yes, it may still happen. Yes, u will lose.* But why u acting as if it happens regularly?
---
&gt; You can't shrug it off with a "Go play ranked," or "Get good," or "Excuses, Excuses." 
---
If u feel like matchmaking in Casual is unfair and teams are uneven, this is where "go play Ranked" comes in. Ranked has a more *consistent* matchmaking than Casual. That's why I said "go Ranked". But, u just had to go with the "I dont have time for Ranked" excuse. If u dont want to play Ranked, but want to win in Casual. That's where the "Git gud" comes in.
---
&gt; You say you only play casual, well what rank are you? 
---
I said I **mostly** just play casual nowadays. But I still play Ranked with my rl friends. After consecutive Diamond seasons, I stopped playing with my old squad (online friends) and went on hiatus for more than 1 year. And just play casually now with my real life friends (1 who plays like Copper, 1 borderline Gold). We hover each season between Unranked and Gold, depending on the availability of my friends to play Ranked. Solo queue, I can easily get Plat.
---
Then why the fuck are you making a big ass deal about it
---
Because it is a big ass deal
---
But you just said you don’t give a fuck
---
If only consoles had chat.
---
Also: Čau
---
Console peasants might
---
I don't believe you can lean without Aiming Down Sights on Console
---
Glad to see there’s so many Czechs. Čau
---
I think he meant dumbass not rumbass
---
ah
---
I keep moving in between plat 3 and plat 2
---
Yea confused the hell outta me too
---
Skyscraper
---
lmao
---
Another problem the gun
---
I wish I was around for Velvet Shell. I love those skins.
---
Ok so why don’t you be specific as to what you’re talking about and calm down. You can see why we’re all confused here, because you don’t explain yourself and then get mad. Don’t give me an attitude, asshole.
---
that's a good rank to idle on
---
The plug down the bottom is the correct type in Australia. The one in the game is American.
---
I see, thanks mate!
---
👌🏻
---
Quack?
---
Overwatch has this and after a few months most (but not all) players have stopped using it and taking it seriously.
---
5 stacks could cheese the hell out of this system
---
that site is straight from 02
---
Yeah, when the best I’ve gotten is plat 3 , due to a bad first 10 matches I got placed silver 4 and I’ve been bumping between silver 3 and gold 2 , I play with fandoms so I don’t ever have a solid team
---
You can trade ubisoft club points for renown and that would make all ubi games sales plummet
---
The sad part is people might try and abuse this
---
Now I'm sad
---
Yeah I just commented about something like this (but not as in depth) a few seconds ago and Overwatch toxicity has just gotten to the point where I don’t like going into teamchat, every few games there will be a thrower, and half the time I give all three to random people for the 150 xp. It’s pretty sad because players were asking for this feature a lot and it really hasn’t been well executed.
---
The drone was sitting still and was captured already
---
Maybe the same person could not "reward" someone more than 3 times?
---
Buff the recoil, not a lot... Just a bit
---
Is that terrorist hunt?
---
Is this on Xbox?
---
You’d get people that just report you for no reason if this came out
---
Possibly
---
This would really be an improvement if the commendation levels would be taken into consideration in matchmaking. This way people with high commendation levels would get games with more respectful and mature players. This would discourage toxicity as players will see direct improvements in the team environment when they act nicer to people.
---
How long does it take for the Rank Adjustment to happen? (or just banning of the player)
---
Can this system even detect ALL the hacking devices and actually differentiate the hacking software from other random files placed in game?
---
And can ubisoft detect players who used these illegal softwares if they only play small amount of games?
---
CS has a similar system but idk if it works.
---
Faceit tho(a third party CS:GO service) has a thing called FBI, which works well.
---
Just like i said to the exact same post from when the map was in tts, does it really matter? It's a outlet. It adds nothing to the game.
---
It's really hard to do this right, because you don't want people to abuse it. Overwatch additionally gives you feedback when you rightfully report someone.
---
Still?
---
What I do is go to pool table on the 2f in coastline to shoot the pool balls as a warm up for leaning and aiming.
---
Bandit, maestro, maverick and ying
---
We need bigger stairs for those goddamn it!
---
Well to be fair I’m only level 1 cause I just got back into overwatch and I consider my self not very toxic.
---
No one likes morons either but here you are.
---
&gt;detects software not physical things
---
How are you people this god damn thick. What do you think a key press or click does? it's like you potatoes think a mouse is some mystical device... it sends a signal to your computer, software detects what that signal was, and inputs that signal into the correct program. If you think ubisoft are incapable of tracking an idiot failing thunt for hours on end clicking his mouse in a repetitive pattern, then you're an even bigger moron than the OP.
---
Don’t quantify everything with “not being racist”.  Say what you’re going to say and if someone is offended that’s their problem.  Do that and avoid actually being racist and you’ll be fine.  Consider it your tip for the day.
---
Everyone has only be picking apart the interrogation bit, but no one is addressing her asinine hitboxes.
---
I feel you. sad days for blitz.
---
Ah the good old days
---
Still not gonna stop be from killing my teammates.
---
Thank you for the insightful comment. You truly are a modern Aristotle.
---
I've been wanting a positive report feature so I can also report players for good behavior. Many times I run into really helpful or cool people on both teams and would love to report them for a better standing kind of like how Xbox live (used to?)have a rep system.
---
well was level 162+ on my dads account since December 2018 and i started on that account on Blood Orchid.
---
he is, you can tell because his eyes would be tinted too
---
Check out the youtube btw. Called cTjL
---
Yeah, It happens too much times
---
reflex isn’t bad tho
---
it is, it looks horrible seperated
---
theyll use all X of em then stop, or if its once a day, theyll do it once a day. If its an end of game thing theyll do it once a game. These systems already exist in many games and theres a reason they usually offer negligible cosmetic rewards. They don't actually work.
---
Nobody uses the ones in CS:GO because you can only do 3 per player (one of each kind). I have like 6000 hours in that game and have like 12, i think the highest ive seen was like 40 and it was cause the guy went into every game and actually asked for it, and he was the only person i ever saw do that. And this was at the highest ranks of play.
---
in league everyone uses their one a game for their queue partners to level each other's borders up.
---
And all the terrible mmos that use them usually give low ammounts of the free currency which may as well not exist since theres always so much that its not even a reward.
---
I've never seen a good use for the system and I couldn't tell you a way to fix it, since if there's no incentive to yourself or friends you're going to forget it exists. If there IS benefit to yourself you'll spam it carelessly.
---
She's on the rise now. In every match, there is a Twitch there
---
I mean it’s not a huge deal because it’s not that common but it’s definitely frustrating
---
it’s the only one i used out of the russian sights cause the rest of them are ass
---
so ?
---
Definitely
---
Rather than a free alpha pack (which would do no harm by any means), a simple indication of good conduct, a badge or something similar could be enough to motivate some people to behave ethically.
---
First look at his pic I thought it Arya Stark
---
Anything would work
---
Lmaoooo
---
Not to mention people reporting you for not clutching the 1 v 4 people in this game are just toxic
---
There’s basically wheels built into the wheels. Drones in game have the same wheels. Allows them to strafe
---
I use Alt. Press with your thumb since vaulting isn't super common.
---
Jesus you’re a degenerate. Don’t try and act gangster online saying ‘yo mama’ when you’re probably a 13 year old white kid called peter
---
I like the idea, I always use comms when I can, and it can get infuriating when no one responds when i ask them where the person that killed them was etc. This system could really encourage people to be better team players. Its a win/win situation really.
---
listen buddy, I’m not one of those people that blames the game for everything, But I literally slowed down the video zoomed in and there isn’t a single pixel on my screen. Get out of here with that BS about “you’re just blaming the game”
---
Never mind fixing rank, toxic behaviour and broken ops. Ubisoft needs to fix this

Hello GNAR--, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bhztfa/something_interesting_i_found_while_playing_thunt/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Consoles desperately need their own test server
---
It doesn’t do much for toxicity though. System isn’t powerful enough or designed in a flawed manner
---
No bandit mains love drugs.
---
Dota has this system where it puts people with a similar goodwill ranking on the same team.
---
So you have some players having a good time and some players always wondering why they need to spend the whole game flaming and griefing their teammates, who don't know how to play and are constantly flaming.
---
Works really well, especially when people in /r/Dota2 compare their experiences.
---
East coast US
---
And you can only pt a bullet proof shield 8 feet away from the lmg so if your shooting someone the just have to crouch and you can’t see them
---
Dope
---
7. Callouts should be clear, carry enough information and not repeated like a skipping record ("cav, cav, cav, cav, cav, cav" is not helpful, "cav in kitchen" is very helpful)
---
8. Accept that sometimes you just can't be revived.
---
9. No backseat gaming, give callouts and advice but not orders, especially if they're a random (level doesn't matter either, I had a plat joining in on copper and bronze matches trying to run shit and it's just cancer, it'd be bad enough if he were actually hard carrying but a plat bitching from the grave in a bronze match is the epitome of siege players being toxic and not at all self aware)
---
10. If you aren't giving on point call outs or clutching the round then you don't get to judge other people for how it plays out.
---
11. If you're going to leave after any slight roadblock then stay in casual, rage quitting ranked just cucks you and your team.
---
No team killing just means your a twat, but no matchmaking in ranked is down to your ranks, golds with golds etc, this can be manipulated by higher ranked players by playing with lower ranked ones it’ll sort of put them in the middle. But team killing just handicaps your team for that round and makes you lose points
---
Do they? It would seem to me that if someone has a keyboard, its probably attached to a PC, which as we are always being told is a "superior" gaming system. That dosent even cover mice. Last time I checked there where 4 or 5 that worked with the xbox, and none of those were cheaper than $30. Do both of those have enough cable to teach 6, 7, 8, maybe 10 feet to someone's couch or armchair? How much is a little lap-board going to cost? Are they going to need a new headset? Even if Ubisoft did allow m&amp;k, and did split the que by controller vs m&amp;k, only a fraction of people currently using the adapter will take it out.
---
Sure but dont expect to get a charm ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Blitz is broken right now. I swear to god, there are times I try to melee someone who is right in front of me, only for me to get shot. Ubi, plz fix blitz.

---
How about fix the ranked system so it rewards good playing atleast somehow if you lose. It makes literally 0 sense that i lose the same amount of elo regardless if i carried or if i was the bottom.
---
Yep, it does. But people only use it to get more exp (It gives you a little bit of exp for it) or to just give recommendations to someone that plays a certain role that a lot of people don't have fun in (healer). Overall, it's not being used for its purpose
---
Thanks bro! Feel free to pm me the links for it and I’ll check it out!
---
You never played online then
---
The reflex in game with the triangular reticle was actually designed for pistols, but it's not available on any pistol, Ubi pls fix.
---
When I wrote this it started at 7 and ended at 11, does reddit think I'm actually that deficient that it needs to correct my counting of single digit numbers?
---
strange
---
Not exacly, player you endorsed might also get free rngbox and that's why players don't as blindly spam endorsments as you think because it starts to run a strong human instinct to not reward someone who is bad/rude.
---
Nobody used DMRs on attack so Ubi gave one to defenders. Successful experiment.
---
Is sixth pick coming?
---
I found this out so long ago and forgot about it
---
Your reward for good comms is winning the game
---
No, only way for me to play ranked is to first queue up for casual and get the "bad service version" ban from there and then I can play one ranked match after. I gotta repeat that every time I want to play ranked.
---
League also have this, don’t be toxic and get free stuff
---
You make a good point, but I think it could be interesting in maybe a test server
---
They're never going to make every map fully balanced, especially with new ops coming every few months. Keep taking away maps and this game will be struggling more than it already is.
---
Not with pick and ban but maybe at some point in the future.
---
Are hidden files turned on? I think .INI files aren't visible by default
---
This sub is garbage lmao, they'll upvote a casual 1v3 in bronze and shitty fanart but no high rank clips or pro league stuff
---
What do you mean by 'taking away maps'?
---
Try setting a different download location in Steam's settings.
---
No. Thay just can't detect is, since macro runs on the mouse. You PC doesnt' know anything about it, it looks like 100% human input.
---
Overwatch has this. It's great.
---
no that’s rook

Whoo! I downloaded them but forgot to install it. Lucky me!

People turning off or banning maps is essentially taking them away. Already lost a few fun maps.
---
well the UN peacekeepers do a lot sexual assault i know that much
---
Repost pls send me the real link anyway i credited the artist.
---
Smite has a system like this where if you get commended enough you get a free cosmetic item.
---
lol, well you're the one flexing, suggesting that one gun was the only one to use...and then suggesting that if anyone disagreed they must have never played the game.  You're like the sweaty Ash main who only runs the R4C and shits on everyone else with a different opinion.
---
But a map beeing fun is an opinion. And aslong as people like it, its going to be played.

I'm sure a lot of people would like to play Plane, but we don't have that option.

Wich headgear is it? And how much does it cost
---
Good way to split the normal friendly players in the game from the toxic players
---
free r6 credits? how?
---
If it works, then lucky you, I guess, I've been wracking my brains over this for a couple of days lol, and finally found the fix.  
---
If it doesn't work then you know what it is.

Thats something good about beeing able to choose maps: you can even play some old maps, even if they're unbalanced.

When theres a new season for next year they give you 600 when you buy it and i game share with friend so i get it for free

---
Vigil 😂
---
As a pretty new player, I just wish they’d punish spawn perks and run outs. :/
---
What is it?
---
Spawn killing isn’t a problem. It can be annoying when you’re new, but you’ll learn where to watch for them. Tbh once you know where people are spawn peeking from it’s really easy to take a free kill off of them.
---
Clearance levels are pretty useless yep
---
The MVP screen idk about, it’s kinda cool, some of the elite skin animations are pretty sweet. A play of the game style killcam like overwatch would be tight tho
---
Game is not the same after 3years they changed lighting and some models in game, also idk what the problem exactly.
---
I would point out that sometimes if you're talking with your friends in discord or complaining about your teammates, it might still be good to have PTT on for economy of communication. V is a good option for PTT because the only thing it makes mutually exclusive is vaulting, which you only do with a tap and rarely do when making important callouts.
---
I think new players start at 1.
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
Pretty much
---
I doubt I'll get a response considering this post is 4 hrs old, but how about noobs like me? We barely know any callouts right? 
---
I've played the game for roughly 6 months and I still don't know the maps well enough to navigate where I need to go to. If I am at a certain place then I know to do, but I wouldn't know how to get there. So even if teammates tell me where to go... I wouldn't know where to go.
---
And given the competitive nature of the lobbies in general (*cough* toxic) I'm pretty sure I'd receive a negative commendation (if that's an option)
---
A “looking for group” system would be way more beneficial
---
It's people like you that make me rage and quit the game for months on end. Screw you, you brilliant bastard
---
I have V on melees
---
Lol
---
Since alpha packs can’t be bought
---
Nigga what
---
The game simply looks a lot better and thanks for help i just delete my post
---
What?
---
The tarps are different colors
---
Against defenders: Clash (just remove this piece of shit lol) and Caveira. I feel like Caveiras pistol downs me in 2 shots over the whole map, but when I am playing her, the luison needs like 5 bullets to kill an enemy right infront of me. 
---
Against attackers: Jackal, he tracks me every single fucking time and Maverick cuz he makes barely a sound and you're dead.
---
Still like every operator in the game and think every of them is unique and useful while fair. (except clash lol).
---
In overwatch you'll be able to tell that they're not noobs because they wont be level 1
---
This trick is actually came from a very old reddit post by someone who i can't seem to find his post (Valkyrie tower c4 spawnkill).
---
Thanks to him, i always use his trick and almost never fails if no one is rappelling from North side windows.
---
In your settings, under match preferences, you can filter out what maps you do and do not want to play on (takes party leaders setting). I'm not sure if this is terrorist only or carries over to multiplayer, but it may be something to consider.
---
did you find a solution?
---
Btw if u see a gamer tag in there anywhere of my friend plz tell me
---
After this he went on a losing streak and never recovered 😂 i know the feeling
---
what did you put on the mouse side buttons then?
---
The abilities
---
Every damn post... 
---
Ubisoft needs to learn to take some fucking notes from Blizzard.
---
Ubiaoft doesnt like the word "Free"
---
DotA does this really well. You can be commended for good teamwork and things, the more commends, the better your behavior score, the nicer players you meet
---
because the artist himself posted it already ?
---
Wow thats amazing u hope i get it soon though
---
What's middle mouse then?
---
No one really uses overwatches system when I play, it might just be a waste of the devs time to implement this.
---
What
---
r/rareinsults
---
If you're talking about the scroll button then i have it on nothing and ive actually been meaning to try to use that.
---
Like it has a small camera attached to a small thin barrel that can peak thru drone holes
---
You can add an angled grip and a compensator and most people can’t tell the difference when in match.
---
Lucky spread
---
i think someone is just mad that they are a non-toxic player and they don’t get good skins.
---
Probably the most realistic shotgun range I’ve ever seen in that game.
---
Ahhh... Nvm ._.
---
You got ripped off!
---
no thanks people are gonna abuse that
---
Shooting through bulletproof glass is too much, shield doesn't need a nerf, it's just blitz needs to go back to 1 speed.
---
But they could make a knockback effect, not the current melee towards shield kind of knockback, the current melee towards shield should be called flinch, and the knockback effect I'm referring to is just a coordinate backwards shifting mechanics.
---
looks like he played the mute aswell
---
Unrelated question, but how did you get the user tag lmao
---
I always wondered why it’s yellow in spawn selection

Thank you :)

Hello goatsasf, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bi1jx1/his_head_just_flew_off/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The most insane part is that the in-game scoreboard ranks people based on score rather than kdr, and getting your kill "stolen" actually awards you either the exact same amount or even slightly more points than finishing the guy you downed yourself. Assist scores are absolutely massive in this game, and for good reason.
---
There really is no good reason to be mad about "kill stealing".
---
Yes, they don't go away.
---
I play sledge to get moments like these. Never had them though
---
Or you get matched with other decent players, that way good behaviour is rewarded with higher quality matchmaking.
---
Staged much?
---
MVP is for elite skins you can buy for real money and they have special animations plus to show off skins
---
How do you figure it's "dead"? What are you basing that off of? 
---
You suggesting that it's possible that the endorsement system "might" have played some factor in Overwatch game being "dead" really makes me question anything you say.
---
Thirded
---
So it's kinda  like the endorsement system from Overwatch?  If so, if people dont use it, it veco.es irrelevant.
---
the new siege for the nintendo  DS looks great!
---
Either your NIC doesn't work, you need to switch download regions or your firewall is blocking steam

Val mpx is just bad at times

Well on pc it is. Getting headshots on console isn’t as simple as point and click

Zofia - Maestro - Mozzie (maybe also Maverick)

the little kids that are high levels will report a level 20 in a casual trying to have fun but sure
---
I have iq and tachanka
---
&gt; you know the world is fucked when you have to reward decency and good behavior.
---
not really, people have been rewarding good behaviour in pets and children for decades. It's a lot more effective than punishing bad behaviour (to an extent).
---
Maybe they should try and do what overwatch does but give you dupes only if you have everything of that op
---
Ok thanks
---
You would be surprised where you can fit cat 5/5e/6 cable. Learn to make the ends yourself and you can run it anywhere. I've ran it under carpet, under baseboards, behind crown moulding..
---
If you know you have an open wall with no fire stop it's easy to run it inside a wall between the studs too.
---
Did any of them ragequit?
---
as much as i hate shielded operators, that’s not fair.

You can pay real money for renown boosters which you then use to buy alpha packs.

And league of Legends

Rainbow needs to fix their game the enemy team was doing this almost every round they were Downing in the hostage before the round even started and it somehow counted as us doing it he was using the lesion traps and then leaving the game as soon as the hostage was going to go down and they counted towards us bringing down the hostage
---
i feel like it could easily be exploited maybe if there’s a limited amount of commends you can receive a day people can’t boost each other for free alpha packs
---
Agreed, was so happy when OW got rid of them. Really hope Ubisoft smartens up.
---
Is that loading screen the one were you wait in lobby forever and if you leave it says you will get penalized? And you can even talk to other people in the lobby, but the game never starts? Cause I had that 2-3 times and I thought it was a glitch not people exploiting and the weird part was my friend hosting was searching, I was having lag issues so I tell him to cancel and I restart my game and I got that lobby bs but he didn't.
---
Would it even work with squads? I think people would just use it to get people to do shitty things, like "I'll commend you if down that teammate"
---
There were always trolls. Just people who have no life
---
How did you revert? I can't seem to
---
Took a while to realise to turn vigil's gadget on and off repeatedly
---
nice

Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
I play on PS4 so there isn’t any game chat but I didn’t know you could get permanently banned for toxic behaviour? I thought perma bans were only for hackers?
---
The game doesn't show your avg. score when people click on your profile, but it does show your k/d. Not that I care, but I think that's part of the reason why those that care do so.
---
I have my hor sensitivity at 40 and ver at 15. I watched a video and the recommended sensitivity was around there. The people I use have high sensitivity and I really do like them but it’s pretty hard to control it. I usually don’t do tap fire or burst but I’ll try that!
---
Ubisoft said they loved it, so they might add it.
---
Someone reinforced near Mira
---
sure
---
That's not a problem I mean its basically like using jackal in terrohunt, you can do it if you want to XD
---
Sony Xperia C5 duel
---
MP5
---
If only 😥
---
for fragging, probably zofia, maybe lion. If you want support ops go for ying/dok
---
for defender probably lesion, ela, maestro
---
A recruit skin where he looks to be infected by the virus
---
My friends always say that the arx is way better but I always manage to prove them wrong
---
pains me to say as an Ela main but I’d have to say lesion because he has more utility. Ela’s smg is difficult to learn but is satisfying and rewarding when you do.
---
And I like points
---
Okay but how thick was she? This is important information.
---
Don't be so boring.
---
Thats the live of a Monty ^^ Im not sure if that would work (because with bombs it doesn't work as well): if you see an enemy + look (direktly) in his direction + ping -&gt; the system awards you with something like the scan assists when a mate injures/kills them
---
**Caveira** cause fuck having legit wallhacks in Siege, still dont understand how the community is okay with this. 
---
**Blitz** and **Montagne** are just boring to fight against.
---
**Mira**, its such a cheap way to get wallbangs, no skill no brain, just aim and move to the side. Wallbanging is supposed to require more effort.
---
**Echo**.
---
Any Attacker using ACOG because they waste 2 minutes "holding angles" aka camping outside and only start moving once they hear "15 seconds left" at which point they stumble into OBJ room and immediately get a face full of lead.
---
Ya and put all the scum into games with each other lol while the good teammates get matched
---
it seems nice on paper but in CS:GO even baseless reports will lower your trust factor, so if you play well enough and people do a salty report for cheating you might get punished for it.
---
Just play casual if you're "putting" yourself in bronze.
---
Unlucky same here
---
smh my head
---
Think you mean Lion for the first one
---
Use acog for every gun
---
Yeah sure let me stick it on my shotgun
---
Ash/ela.....we are equal in toxicity lol
---
Thanks m8
---
Rook my guy
---
I got Jackal and Doc, however I don't think I play them that much... 🤷‍♂️
---
Nice for memeing not for anything else
---
Jager or mute
---
Ooh dont worry i am an ash jager main
---
No
---
Oh they definitely deserved it haha.
---
Should i buy buck or should i buy Centurion
---
Where does it tell you your most used operators?
---
U get sent an email
---
He needed a lot of ammo for that feat
---
Good behavior and sportsmanship should be incentivized and not just bad behavior punished. I fully support this.
---
But plays like a plat lol
---
Just kill mav before you let him expose that many holes, you shouldn’t be leaving ops unchecked and relying entirely on counters to their gadgets. You can always pop a disposable shield in front of holes, or position yourself where you can see the majority of the room. 
---
I think it’s far easier just using a different tactic to defeat Maverick. If you know he’s on the opposing team, just sit in a room outside of the objective and open up your own hole into the room with a shotgun or an impact and watch it. If you see a hole open up, go around to where he is and shoot him. Much easier than adding in a character that would pretty much only be useful against Mav. 
---
It’s only really an issue if someone is anchoring in objective room, which if they are doing that, their whole purpose is defeating threats to the room, you should be on guard. I haven’t really ever seen a mav make multiple holes and keep repositioning between them, and if they do, taking time to deploy a gadget that fills a hole that you could shoot through or just burn again doesn’t seem more effective than just shooting through the hole or repositioning instead of staying put Ansbach playing into his hand. Fundamentally, maverick is most useful against anchors who play like this in terms of using your gadget on an objective, so to counter it with an ineffective op doesn’t make sense
---
Rewards for leveling up
---
So essentially a way for squads to reward each other in Casual while leaving randos out - the same as stepping in front of your shot in Terro to steal your kill. 
---
I don't think this would work because there's way too many toxic people in this game.
---
Lol why don’t you go find out why the universe expands
---
What good are you accomplishing? That’s toxic. Next round you’ll have 1 less man and more chance of losing
---
I don't know about you, but as a vet myself I can't get enough renown. Ubisoft has been ramping up their game with Bundles, and unless you constantly have a booster active you won't be able to own them all. Dupes can be annoying, but is this really the best counter we can give for them existing?
---
“I play like a plat”
---
I have no problem with rappelling terrorists. I shoot them and toss a nitro down. Then I bag like two kills.
---
Nice one lol
---
Link for where anything other than fan made says Ladders specifically?
---
I know if i play a game that has a much different sensitivity a lot, then i will have poor aim because i will be used to the old game. Maybe adjust your sensitivity. But record your current settings so if you liked the old you can revert back.
---
My best ace was when I had 1hp in a 1v5 situation. It was on old Hereford Base and the site was the top floor with the bomb planted. Was able to get some nasty flicks and defuse. Everyone in my party chat was losing their shit after that.
---
Same here
---
That’s for normal terrorist rappelling I’m talking about a glitch
---
Toxic people for me are almost always high-endorsement. Even if they're not, what does that do? You just suspect ahead of time that they'll be toxic? It still doesn't change their behavior.
---
That was from the Outbreak LTM back in march
---
Nah I usually take it as “hey you pulled us together as well as you could” 
---
Though if it ever happened where I got raged at then given it passive aggressively I would probably FeelsBadMan
---
Dang spot on
---
Try climbing up from copper 4
---
I don't know
---
ClIpS aRe WhaT ciVieS Put IN tHEIR haIR, ThaTs a MaGAziNe.
---
You have a certain level as to how "nice" of a player you are. It's weird because I've level up from level 2 to level 2 like 3 times but i see level 3s and 4s a lot
---
What if they’re just being toxic assholes
---
[People watching Rook](https://i.imgur.com/b7pOX75.jpg)
---
Check out uplay settings. I know steam has that option to, uplay should have something similar, but idk
---
It looks so nice, shame it was for a limited time.
---
Cool got it
---
I agree
---
I don’t like doesn’t mean I don’t want it
---
Fuze, Blackbeard, or Jager
---
Imagine the BOSG.12 with an acog though. That would be so cool
---
Yea but who really keeps track of those things there’s 8 of them
---
Ok, I see you Blaze from Blaze and the Monster Machines...
---
For real tho nice cosplay! 👍
---
Tab. I dont sneak a lot. Just crouchwalking. If i do have to sneak its usually just with w though

Hello Relatable-Username, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bi41oc/has_anyone_else_been_experiencing_server_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Unless the room needs my reinforcements on walls or ceiling hatches, I always try to reinforce the floor hatches
---
Thanks for the reply :D
---
I love doing cool thungs.
---
And they vote to kick you 😂
---
Just play ranked.... only RANKED
---
I mean, it's dependent on where the obj is, but yeah totally
---
Im not the best at using a mobile device
---
It's called "I queued for 30 minutes and found no matches at all". But of course I am expected to go through that because if I didn't your precious games would be affected. And of cause *brilliant* players like you shouldn't have to put up with such scum as a new player, amirite?
---
Was the cosplay Thicc? I mean thats part of the character. *SWEATS IN GERMAN*
---
*slinks away in jackal*
---
It has to be the hibana one
---
Go play all of the situations ya noob
---
I love the AK-74 and didn't like the ARX the few times I used it
---
I agree friendly fire in Terrorist Hunt is absolutely annoying, even with the added health to players (because of people team killing in the first place).
---
I've found that since they buffed player health how players grieve me is they choose a high damage gun (LMG/Shotgun/Etc) or use C4 and then team kill or kill the hostage. 
---
It would be nice to report why players are being toxic; cheating, afk farming, griefing/teamkilling and for this report if found valid accumulated into some form of discipline. 
---
And an added function to avoid players who are being toxic. And block a player who is being toxic so you don't get match-made with them in the future.
---
I’ve been playing for 4 years and still haven’t finished them😅
---
High ping makes enemy shots not register quite a bit. I’ve seen shots not land on someone with a high ping &amp; when I ping abused myself I noticed multiple enemy shots not register on me completely, but my shots register fine. These were all recent.
---
I’m on West US servers &amp; either I’m forced to main shields &amp; melee in the morning because of Japanese players or face sweaty MnK players in the evening since I’m in Plat.
---
I don't know what to say. That was an incredible play and I don't know what the enemy team was thinking all staying so close together like that
---
I know i have 1000+hours🙄
---
Lesion imo , he is a better anti push and intel gathering operator, he still has a very good gun and has impacts
---
From the NATO website “Article 5 provides that if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked.” The first implementation of Article 5 was after 9/11
---
Bartlett University gets attacked by the terrorists in white masks and you as part of team rainbow are tasked with eliminating the hostiles and defusing the two bombs they have placed on site. The cutscenes for that thing are epic you really need to watch them.
---
It's kind of stupid though because I go on Rampages all the time yet mine is Crystal Clear White I probably have like 500 player kills and about 6000 or so NPC kills with a total of I think a week and a half of game time so I feel like they should make it a little more limited
---
Reeeee
---
Zoinks! That got dark.
---
I like that, if only people who aren't queued up with you can commend you.
---
the situation article 5? it's a terrorist hunt mission you get after getting all 30 stars in the situations, but no one does it anymore so get some friends ready if you want to do it as you need a full team of 5. also it's really hard cause there's this smoke gas everywhere and you cant see 10m ahead.

how tall u?
