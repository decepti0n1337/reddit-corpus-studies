Didn't they say they weren't going to elite all of 5he S.A.S members?

Recently made the switch to PC

I know what I plan on saving up for now.

Is this adressing toxic behaviour or are you playing with friends.

I mean I can’t aim for anything while doing it so I suppose

So I guess you like fortnite? And that screenshot was taken before 2019 you uncultured eggplant, Also I’m CoOl BeCAusE I HaTe On PeOpLe WhO MaKe A JoKe
---
Well, I guess the word filter is a bit dumb anyway, but... really? Come on Ubi. Why even consider it? 
---
Bet
---
Monty got your back
---
Gotta say, it ain’t as cool as I thought it was saving up and I want my 90,000 renown back lol
---
Although it is good to flex on friends ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
These 3 random guys just kept throwing stuff at me. so I just played along(casual)
---
Nice kill
---
Will starter edition owners get a refund for all the ops they bought for 12500?
---
A.b.s.o.l.u.t.e.l.y. O.u.t.p.l.a.y.e.d.
---
Yes, the MP5 is a relatively old gun that still functions. Glad someone else noticed. /s
---
OP is playing on console, that's why he was saying console siege.
---
I don’t doubt their ability I just think it’s more likely this an alpha pick skin or a skin that simply will never be released to the public 
---
I don’t know. It’s a bug I think. Happens to me too
---
Alright in my defense I couldn't even think of something that tachanka would do, Everyone else there was just easy pickings
---
R6 cosplay is generally very easy to do since its mostly tacticool gear.
---
How do white bar
---
Sir! My bullets seem to not work! This water pistol isn’t enough firepower! 
---
(Monty looks mildly annoyed and slightly wet now)
---
How much renown were operators for people on normal/not starter version?
---
I'm honestly waiting for these jokes
---
I feel like I’m the only person on this sub who doesn’t have a 3D printer
---
never played it actually. Nice comeback by the way. Have fun with puberty. 
---
I am not a huge fan of the challenges that require you to play as an OP you dont have, I have no idea if everyone gets the exact same challenges but as a newer player without too much free time these fun weekly challenges give me something fun to aim for while also getting a small little bonus making it a slight bit easier to unlock more ops with the extra 1500ish possible renown. But when you cant do 2-3 of them because they require you to play as someone you dont have you lose out on that small chunk of renown and a fun challenge. 
---
I read it at tater tots... which she should have as well... they’re good... I’m hungry. 
---
And maybe just a bit dyslexic

Because PRC has very strict telecommunication guidelines re: video games and other forms of media.

*meanwhile bank he was meant to be monitoring gets robbed*
---
I guess its new but we already got the Italian short
---
...
---
sounds fun and wholesome
---
Finally it has begun
---
My school does lol I don't
---
Cosmetics! I spent about 150k recently on some new cosmetics for some operators.
---
Lol, my dad calls tater tots "potato nuggets" and I have no desire to call them anything else but that anymore.
---
I legit bought the 7560 bundle yesterday off of amazon uk
---
you can change the system, but you will never change the people. Plus, literally nobody at Ubi cares lol. 
---
YES! THANK YOU FOR THIS BLESSED KNOWLEDGE!
---
-and the emus won.
---
slow news day huh?
---
God my first match was on Favela and I absolutely hated it, I thought I would love it because back in MW2 Favela was my favorite map but in siege it just feels too tight/verticle and I feel like I never saw anyone.
---
No one can give an exact percentage. It's just based on the eye test. If the kill was not done in an efficient manner--wasting a considerable number of bullets while shooting--it's a potato situation. If the kills is clean and efficient--wasting minimal bullets--it's not a potato situation. 
---
This is way better than a motorcycle

You're 100% correct that some people cannot be appeased. I deal with them on a daily basis. Hell my job is pretty much be paid to be yelled at all day by rich entitled brats that don't even know what the meaning of the world polite. But at the end of the day that's what the job is. I give a nice person the same customer service as a rude person because it's my job to give good customer service not only give good custmer service to those I deem worthy of it.
---
wow
---
I know this is unrelated but any map with a bathtub in it I force someone to remake that shitty porno meme where the pornstar says "Get out theres a shark in the water" and the guy says "This isnt a beach its a bathtub".
---
Must of been using the Nerf Shield 
---
The GIGN shotgun is op as fuck at close range.
---
Thought this was a shitpost on /r/eve for a second.
---
Yes Please!
---
They have reworked specific bundles for the game offering different content packs + the base game for a fixed price. One other change they made was upgrading all starter editions to full game. No more starter editions 
---
I thought that was a picture did you draw this?
---
Oh sweet. Glad they removed the starter edition it was way too much of a grind to get new ops imo.
---
Lean spamming is worse than drop shotting ever was
---
I said the cosplayers name hours ago, what do you mean no one bothered?
---
They prob got bored of always playing with the same ppl
---
We only ride kangaroos in Australia 
---
That's.... not how support is supposed to work. At all. What the actual fuck kind of bullshit operation is Ubisoft running here?
---
I haven't done a propper research but Uruguay doesn't have a force as big as other countries like Peru,  Colombia or Mexico. Any Latin America country will be a great addition for Siege however if Uruguay gets reveal I'm gonna be happy but asking myself "Why?"
---
Message me 
---
Why am i not getting it? 
---
Did you buy starter edition?
---
Not everyone has the financial means to give such a tip. And if one does want to give a "tip," they can do so by buying something else that is of greater value, e.g., an elite skin or PL skin. 
---
Spawn peaks are ok. 
---
Run outs tilt me so hard, and are just dumb anyway
---
Yep, maybe i just did it to early,. I am gonna restart my game
---
Nah i cant draw for shit mate i found this pic one a RainbowSix instagram page and thougt it was cool i didnt found the artists name if u know his/her name pls tell me 
---
Try that and if that doesn’t work I would contact Ubisoft support.
---
Thats actually the first thing i tought of too 
---
CATCH A RIIIIIDE
---
I mean for that logic Ash isn't an operator either; she's code and a 3D model in the form of a theoretical person. Your action figure comparison is actually closer to the real thing because it's based off a real life wrestler, while Ash isn't based on any actual FBI operator. :P
---
They eliminated the start edition today and replaced it with a new edition. Everyone that was on the starter edition was updated to the new edition. 
---
Sure,ill do that, Thanks for the help
---
Her gun is the only reason I cant play Ela. I just default to using the pistol if I end up playing her which is a shame because I like her mines.
---
Np
---
Well... As much as I'm curious myself, having the nuances being general information would probably be a recipe for abuse. I imagine many of those toxic teamkilling premades would be happy to wait 30 seconds before teamkilling if they knew that was the threshold for 'getting away with it' a bit more, so to speak. Kinda like how Ubisoft put that abusive language system in place which people then freely circumvented and used to troll others after working out it's details.
---
IM DYINGGGGGGGGGG URUGUAYAN HEREEE OMGGGG ITS ALMOST THE FIRST TIME A GAME ACKNOWLEDGE MY COUNTRY AAHHHHHH \*CRIES IN HAPPINESS\* 
---
Yup. Now all renown can be spent on DLC characters
---
Finally
---
he was doing some kind of don't shit for two weeks challenge or what? 
---
VAMO ARRIBA WAACHOOOO
---
just delete .ini file in Documents\My Games\Rainbow Six - Siege\manynumbers\ 
---
Game create new file with default settings. 
---
As for stuttering VSync is always first suspect, turn it off (both in game and drivers). 
---
For test turn off AA. I noticed on my old card that it dosen't work well with low memory cards over longer periods of gameplay. Maybe an issue for you too.
---
What the fuck are you on
---
Yea my friends don’t quite understand the toxic ops yet 
---
Montagne covers your back with his pistol and has smokes for hot plants, other operator covers montagnes back with a primary gun 
---
Looks like fan made wall paper 
---
Personally I think of SI 2018 Grand Finals, Fabian shit talking people or Yung casting.
---
But I guess your idea works too.
---
Not even half
---
Mozzie is the man
---
That just sounds like a typical Casual Game. Just because it's casual doesn't mean that you have to play casually. So many people just meme a ton and still hit shots because they can, and a lot of people use Casual as a practicing tool as well. Also, like darkstarwut said, a lot of the time people just start telling people they're a sweat simply because they got killed like it was nothing and the person is so high up on the leaderboard. 
---
Simply playing the game the way you play =/= Sweat, and people really need to settle down and realize that.
---
We need a flair for this.;
---
Can we just get a scorpion rework Ubi? Like you can nerf the damage again, lower the mag count or whatever but just make the gun useable at longer than a foot away  
---
The dlc OPs were also 25K, but in standard edition a base OP cost 500, second from the same Unit cost 1000, 3rd cost 1500 and 4th cost 2000. All together all 20 original OPs cost a total of 25K, the same for a single DLC op. Until Ubi changed it and all original OPs came free with standard.
---
Gridlock was secretly behind the Emu War. 
---
You mean kangaroo right?
---
The community. No offense but it’s on par with Black Ops 2.
---
A few weeks should be a week, shouldn't it?
---
I mean, you need a 2 or 3 years of dlc ops before ubisoft can realistically start discounting them in the first place.
---
This is intended, as they said on the [blogpost:](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-344167-16/rainbow-six-siege-year-4-editions-launching-february-12)  
---
&gt;Reintroducing Progression for Legacy Operators  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;For  new players and Starter Edition owners who have been upgraded to the  base game, they will see the return of the progression system for  unlocking the original 20 Legacy Operators. Legacy Operators will cost  500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 Renown based on how many Operators from a  specific CTU you have unlocked.
---
  
---
IMO this was an unnecessary change.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Feb 12ths i believe
---
I literally just bought the ultimate edition of siege for PC a week ago, does this me I will not get the year 4 operators and I should have waited till February 12th instead of Feb 8th when I bought it?
---
I shouldn't have to read a press release to understand what they're selling. The "Full Game" for the past 2 years has been the standard edition, and that came with the base 20 operators. To then switch what they mean by "Full Game" on their store page without outlining what exactly they mean by that now is not put on the consumer. 
---
 oh howdy! i didnt see ya there
---
It’s not only Americans, it’s literally everyone above the equator, the Aussies can make upside jokes about everyone else if they want to. It’s all perspective my man 
---
I can’t argue that point 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Full game is the full game. You get access to the full game plus year one operator's.  Even before they gave the vanillas and attachments for free, it was sold as full game. 
---
Only those whom have experience with the game prior to this purchase would have a reason to complain. 
---
Idk about you but i enjoyed playing the game to unlock operators. 
---
Don't catch you slippin' up
---
Holy shit I thought it was a drawing at first damn that’s good
---
Hus gadget can literally do that
---
Thx I’ll need it. Solo que on Xbox isn’t an option if u get what I mean
---
hey OP how are you recruit with a red dot?
---
gl with that 80gigs
---
I actually liked that one I could see ubi being able to pull that off
---
I still don't get what the fuck the appeal is about this skin, like do you guys think it makes you look good? It's honestly like the fucking Elephant skin it's just the most noob skin ever and people think it's cool or makes you better at the game like shit theres waaaaaaay better skins in the game and it triggers me every time I see this fucking skin in any game XD all I can think of half the time is "this is probably a CoD kid who moved over to R6S but is still a CoD player so they chose this shitty skin because it's like all those dumbass skins that people grind for just to use because it's suppose to symbolise being a 'good' player" seriously why is this skin even a thing let alone 90k reno
---
Oof, so only two rounds? :(
---
Are we forgetting that Ash is born in Isreal?
---
She has no apparent affiliation to the IDF, but still
---
THICC
---
Praise the sun and chill out
---
I hope she isn’t actually that fat ingame
---
Hahaha thanks for using the word eventually xD I'm drowning right now! I'll get yours done for sure :)
---
Spectator is slightly inaccurate. He probably could see you.
---
Nice
---
I cant level up now
---
I used to be an Ela main then they took the impacts away, and I stopped using her for a while, tried to retry her.
---
I’m assuming after they screwed with the scorpion more, couldn’t do it, stopped using her again, tried using her shotgun in casual a while back and I’m hooked again.
---
That shotgun is ridiculous and it makes her feel like a completely different operator, but she’s won me a lot of gunfights I should not have because that shotgun blows people away.
---
10/10 would recommend.
---
EZ CLAP WE WON 5-4 FKIN NOOB GET FUKT IM 0-7 BUT SO EZ
---
Cool. I like the weathered look
---
Pretty obvious from one look at it’s ugly mug
---
Someone requested an Ela as well so that means your queue is going to get bumoed up! :)
---
XD
---
I still don't have all of the base operators though...
---
Yeah Echo sounds super cool! I'll dm you for more details :)
---
I hate when people call high ranks sweaty in cas if you die to them...their a higher rank so them not trying is still going to be way above your skill level and most of the movement and actions we do are out of habit and isn’t sweating it just comes out natural after a long time of playing plus in ranked we can’t always run out or rush blind without being safe and it’s more fun to do those strats in casual sometimes so stop harassing Plats and Diamonds we wanna have a fun time to not having every game being ranked or feeling a bed to do good or be called carried and shit 
---
What the actual fuck 
---
Hahah definitely :) I'll dm you for more details!
---
For once I found someone actually with a mind on Reddit. may the lord's praise you but still Ash is overused and we can all say that with confidence and shitty pro league numbers. Just saying she may need a little tweaking to the R4-C or maybe the G36C to make it better.
---
What is it?
---
nO mEmEs AlLoWeD
---
I can tell just from the Gun who this is . 
---
What how am i a bitch for voicing a opinion? Explain that to me and how this affects you in any way possible.

I meant starter apologies** But thx for the info😄
---
Lion is literally the most powerful operator ever released...

That's a desktop feature you might not have on mobile, apologies

Yo wtf I didn’t even realize 
---
Not really. Play ur cards right. He has two scanners which also has a cool down. He counters roamers as well.
---
Oh god frost is out to get me with those spikey bitey things oh god oh fuck
---
What's scp?
---
He looks like a pedophile at the beginning 
---
I believe it’s the short time to kill in rainbow
---
Because of the short ttk matches the game draws in a more competitive player base and when there’s more competitive people there’s more toxicity 
---
Oh ok thanks
---
This ain't it. 
---
We meet again. FPS MACHINE STILL BROKE.
---
Yes!
---
There’s already 3 SAS elites, other factions can have some nice things.
---
It's very fun, but the community is excessively toxic. Many games have toxic communities, but Siege is the only one (to my knowledge) that gives trolls a platform. Trolls have the ability to remove you from matches and decreased your KD. That should never, ever be the case. 
---
It's okay lad, it was just a mere joke
---
big agree
---
Is that why he had a 99% pick/ban rate in Pro League yeah? Cause he was super duper balanced? 
---
Is that why he's currently quarantined in every competitive tournament? 
---
Almost everyone has this legendary skin but imo it's cool
---
damn boi, you thicc.
---
So uh, why are Sicily and Sardinia not Italy anymore?
---
The SCP Foundation is an organization that secures contains and protect anomalies 
---
The locomotive isn’t a real shotgun, it’s based off a Remington 870 that’s sawed off
---
Note: this is not meant for fat shaming
---
I know, sooo close but I always lose 1v1s against Clash so I didn't wanna take that chance 
---
Yeah. But sometimes a tk might be accidental so it would suck if they were way longer.
---
That's literally the \*original\* full game lol
---
Lol, you think phones could run Siege? You nuts? 
---
[NO! PLEASE GOD NO!](https://youtu.be/umDr0mPuyQc)
---
By ttk I meant time to kill
---
I always thought they were their own countries, guess I was wrong
---
But its a balanced map
---
And they didn't even try to contest they just gave up. They admitted defeat to you just so you didn't Ace. That sucks but yeah 1v1s against Clash are risky.
---
Luckily I’m too good
---
She hit the gym a little
---
Oh. I thought you said tk with an extra t. My bad.
---
Wow ubisoft! How considerate of you guys to join us in the body positivity movement #HealthyAtEverySize
---
So if you are a budget gamer with time, why pay for the pass? Get it for free, as you keep saying you can. Noone is forcing you to pay the 30. For the people who need the pass (people with jobs, other responsibilities, kids etc) 30$ is a good price point. Not to mention, I love the skins that come with them and I still use them consistently.
---
Dude you’re already doing it wrong by placing them in bar wires 
---
Yeah u still think your idea would work tho
---
THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING SUPER DUPER COOL. 👍

---
All year one ops 30 outbreak packs and 600 r6 creds. I bought that same edition
---
&gt;They were a few thousand renown. 
---
thats starter edition which the phased out few hours ago.
---
they rolled back the legacy OP acquisition to that way back around OP health(standard edition) where they cost 500-2000 as you unlock them from each CTU
---
Same Question Here
---
I'm mad about the nerf to her gun still but its not useless. Its still great for close quarters dueling.
---
To be honest, my friends stopped playing the game because people are toxic and lost interest. But for the challenge, just do casual with 5 people and it already finished (even through it was last week)... ;)
---
I think OP's brain has been fuzed. It currently can't function as normal.
---
they sell the same thing...
---
Bro i need that when I get out of the reign on console
---
No one uses it on pc either it’s more of a game review term
---
Hows alex
---
Try her shotgun. It’s ridiculous with an extended barrel. Totally different play style but it’s dominant. Easy to roam with easy to make rotations.
---
You will not regret it.
---
I waited for him to take off the mask and have the Owen Wilson "Wow" sound effect played in the background.
---
hi power girl i like your comics
---
And to think, the Renown wasted on this could've gotten us 20 Commons, 2 Uncommons, 1 Rare, 1 Epic (but not Black Ice) and 1 Duplicate Legendary instead!
---
Op is Thatcher. Drop the pitchforks
---
Its just the gaming community in general
---
I got 10 outbreak packs. I got it on sale on ps4 for 17 bucks.
---
I think it was 2 nights ago I got it on sale for 17 bucks on ps4.
---
Broski he has an ez counter...DONT FUCKIN MOVE 
---
What? They didn't add it to console did they?
---
Don’t catch you breaking your femur... up
---
You are telling me this isn’t a detail rendered model of frost elite?
---
#YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
---
Am I able to unlock all the operators through progression or have to buy them all.
---
I’m currently sitting on 150,000 renown saving up for 50 alpha packs 
---
Ok but like..how?
---
In what way?
---
Bottom floor bomb site is the easiest plant ever for attackers
---
Top floor bomb site is ridiculously hard to attack. There are runouts on all 4 sides of the map to kill people rappelling, there are tons of angles to peek on skylight to immediately 1-tap any attacker that goes there, the the hatch is a deathtrap to drop and any staircase push is extremely easy to shut down. That's every way you can attack that site.
---
Middle floor is the only simi balanced bomb site on the map.
---
I thought I was going crazy because I was certain I had some skins but couldn't find them. Usually happens when I get a skin for an op I don't have, and when I unlock them, its gone. 
---
As much as I try not to, against clash I always make the mistake of turning around and trying to run. I should've just taken some shock damage to run her battery down while getting close. I obviously didn't think to do this in the heat of the moment, hah 
---
Your kindness makes me regret my comment. I hope u have a good day. 
---
Nope
---
Have a good day, fellow Redditor. 
---
damn
---
no need to start getting angry, just talk like normal human beings

No the twitch pack green camo is really bad for him.

If you’re talking about Sex Pistols, the stands ride the bullets and manipulate them
---
Needs more campfire. 
---
See, we let you know ;) 
---
I was thinking something similar to outbreak but instead of an outbreak it could be like a scp security breach
---
**In awe at the size of this lass**
---
it's $15cad rn idk tho I won't have my stats n shit
---
Considering the recent rework of her splash art, I have a feeling you’ll be pleased in a few days..
---
English fucking hell

The other ops are 100% ying and the phone girl

unless you paid for them before they were all free you dont get them. from what i could see, all the ops on all editions went back to the 4 tier system of unlocks unless you bought them before. 
---
How do you get it?
---
What did I just witness.
---
I'd upvote your post more if I could. This needs to be solved, and hate to say it, but toxic masculinity is rainbows biggest issue. If I get into a lobby with a girl and only one person asks for nudes, that's one person too many.

aren't the main 20 operators in total like 20k renown lol

Could be. They didn’t kill me either. But they were in the objective room and they kept me out longenough to complete secure

I own both PC and console versions. I play mostly console, but PC, eh I play here and there. The "just stand still" thing, yeah that's not gonna fucking work with a blitz on there team, ur right. However that stand still could possibly work. I have experienced this, everytime i reach plat 3 I go against plat 2 and diamonds. Like i said, I play with a full or 4 man squad so we have communication. Now don't get me wrong the whole stand still thing isn't always going to save u. It can in certain situations. Often times or sometimes it just won't. What I like to do in that 5 seconds of time is to maybe go behind a wall and peek the corner, bait them just a little bit, maybe shoot, idk something to bait them, but I like to hold that peek and wait until the scan is done. It's either A whoever comes around that corner is getting fucked, or B if it's a blitz coming around that corner, u best believe im fuckin dead. 
---
Definitely needed

There is nothing there talking about operators after Y1

Yeah unless you already had standard ops already you would need to unlock them. https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aq1n97/heads_up_to_those_looking_to_buy_the_ultimate/?utm_source=reddit-android

Oeange represents FBI, Yellow SEALs, and Steel Blue represents Maverick, cause he is from America, and joined the GSUTR, which doesn't have a place that it is centered in.

Think about that...you have to learn and practice with it for it just to be decent. I cant think of any other primary in the game that takes so much effort for so little return. the scorpion is basically a more uncontrollable smg 11. except its a primary.
---
We got a revolver skin for that? Thought it was just the charm

That isn't saying much. Most of the elite skins look terrible to me

Tachanka is OP.

For real though, the game auto picking him is a good thing because it’s fun.

Whenever you do something that leaves you in a vulnerable position, for the intention of killing the enemy. 
---
Example: Getting on the defuser and defusing, but when you hear the footsteps, get off the defuser and get that kill. That is an example of bait. 
---
it seems like a clear case of tokenism, damn it PC culture. and if she's trans, it wouldn't even matter because it's a tactical shooter so why would they even put it in.
---
You deserve my upvote

I’m sorry should we have supermodels fight instead of actual elite soldiers come the fuck on asshole

The game was not always like that. For the past two years the standard edition has come with all base operators. Now the ‘Deluxe’ edition doesn’t even do that.
---
And you’re acting like a brat because “I had to unlock them so now everyone else should.” Grow up.
---
I wish to god they just said the genders 
---
There is. The word is watch the Invitational on Sunday
---
Every single person who ever proposed the idea of making earlier ops cheaper was downvoted to hell on this sub here. Glad Ubisoft is reasonable this time.
---
Judging by face and body there's a good chance it's a transgender operator.
---
If you aren't terrified when you hear the tic of Cavs pistol then That's a bad Cavs. It should be the last thing you hear before you die.
---
Holy shit, what a unit
---
It took me awhile to learn that you had to press and hold the gadget press to use Monty 's shield.
---
My aim isn’t that bad tbh

“Yeah nah she’ll be right” when reviving

Actually it's gay

That may have had something to do with it as well. I honestly don't remember exactly when that happened.

Ya sorry i actually meant "when your a drone and you hear cavs pistol" and i forgot when writing the tital sry.
---
"Hold up, could of is only reserved for non-English speaker"

/s in case if people missed the quote mark.
---
Well, she clearly seems to be overweight. I don’t have any issues with large people, but I’ve never seen an overweight special force operator. 
---
Shield can be used to extreme strategy actually 
---
Btw thanks everyone for all the upvotes have a good day
---
Trust me you really do, especially if you like dark humour 
---
It isn't. They're memeing
---
Fuze should have fuzed both from above
---
she looks like the TF2 heavy with an uglier face lmao
---
Amazing.
---
Isnt that skin fixed now?
---
Nah its when someone just sits outside or on a headglitch the whole round trying to get kills. George says it alot because on of the guys he plays with alot baits in 1v3, 1v4, 1,5 situations. He also plays almost only ash on attack.
---
Tachanka would be completely useless but I would still pick him for the meme potential

---
Damn... Ur rly good😀 if u would like, have time etc an ela artwork would look so nice😁
---
oh yeah nahui
---
nope, now they're back to how they were originally, 500-1000-1500-2000 renown on the original ctu's
---
so if this is deluxe then what do u get for the base game?
---
Hye being fat is very healthy! /s
---
No. That was for the "Standard Edition"($40) that gave you all operators. That edition isn't available anymore.
---
Now they're selling the base game for $20 with the same progression system as it had at launch.
---
No not anymore because year 4 is starting. You could get that one
---
That's some weird looking fridge
---
When will this hit consoles? I just started playing and bought the standard edition for $12.49 a few days ago. So far I’m liking the game a lot, and have about 12k renown saved up. I almost have enough to buy one of the first wave of DLC ops, but should I hold off? How long does it take for consoles to get updates after PC?
---
25k renown for standard ops. 150 hours for all of 'em. Nothing wrong
---
If they just bought the game how would they even know what has been going on in the game for the last week, let alone 2 years lol? Take this child's Reddit account away. Op's just tryna play the victim for some karma.
---
This is definitely beautiful front I was a very happy frost main before the took the shield 😭
---
Hibana man!

You decided to buy a product at day X. At day X you looked at the product and you were very happy with it's content and the price attached to it. You said "oh ok, product X very much deserves the price of Y and I'm ready to pay the amount"
---
Just because later down the road the price changes, doesnt entitle you for anything. You decided the game was worth the price for yourself. If it wasnt worth the price, you shouldn't have bought it. And you can't retroactively decide that it suddenly *wasnt* worth the price at day X. Your choice, your fault.

BREAKING NEWS
---
Something no one really should give a fuck about, has fucks given about!
---
Ubisoft was on the case pronto! 
---
Actual problems people give a shit about? What Problems?
---
interesting idea, but how would attackers counter the barbed wire? i understand thatcher would be the most obvious reason, but not many people pick him.
---
maybe it could stay electrified for 10-20 secs then go back to normal?
---
I don't see how my posts got taken down for being a meme and then there's this. Is this not a meme?
---
Oh how much is he
---
Just bought it last Friday can confirm. Mind was blown.
---
She such a babe! She good for everything you can open up walls, hatches you can Flash bang people and ok gun type 80 with ok secondly/ was of the best side arms 
---
if they ever release that i expect a full rework of ela. 
---
idk why ubi keeps making super strong roamers with ridiculous guns/useless(ish) abilities. then nerf the gun to an almost unusable state. 
---
you cant even full auto with ela anymore. the recoil is so awful that it feels like im shooting a fucking laser gatling gun from fallout into nothing. sure ela's gadget is really good if used right. but removing her impacts AND nerfing her gun to hell? what kind of balance is that? 
---
but hey, lets release the attacker variant of ela who has not one, but TWO GOOD GUNS. 
---
pls dont downvote. i honestly feel like they need to buff ela's recoil/damage and give her a smaller clip like mira's vector or something. ela doesnt need that big of a clip, but she needs some sprt of control on her garbage primary. 
---
you might want to clean your glasses
---
Makes sense, you've been nerfed so many times. 
---
I have the starter edition, and I am still grinding for this! Currently at 40k.
---
Hello xEpoch_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aq3oc6/hitreg_machine_broke/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Keep it has a dream, Ubi wont give Ela anything nice :/
---
only in casual
---
i presume that when year 4 comes out, a year 3 bundle will be available to buy, similar to the year 1 and 2 bundles you can buy in the operator menu
---
That should be @rexidn_ on Instagram.
---
So she has to be a 3 armor right?
---
Do u know who is jade aldemir lol
---
Can we just get everything we want on a moments notice? plz devs you only need to listen to everyone who has ideas about what should be in the game.
---
I think it should last as long as clash is firing off her shield. Counter the barbed wire by firing ash's explosive shots at it, or zofias impacts. melee the barbed wire if you can. Grenades even. Theres tons of ways you can counter it and get closer to clash
---
Nope but people have said that’s her 
---
Man this is copper console 
---
i fucking love the sasg shotgun. its even better when you bring it on attack with finka 
---
Thanks:)
---
Jade is char on dying light and elite frost and jade aldemir look like same 
---
When you buy the year 4 I think it comes with all of you don't already have them
---
i get what you mean. its a pretty good and well thought out idea, with good counters. could work, hope this gets to the top! &lt;3
---
She's already too much, from the stairs near the toy airplanes on Villa you can shock someone by the big double door near the deer room. It's too fucking much
---
She T H I C C
---
no if you get the year 4 it only comes with year 4 ops
---
Must've. Must have.
---
No such thing as "must of".
---
But... But... When I was a starter it gave me at least a little feel of progression while i was getting those ops.  Nowadays starters have to grind 15k, and when sou start and you have no clue who to choose because there are a lot. If you have your friends who played it for a longer time they can help you who to choose. You are going to main a few ops but you will learn how to play with them. And it only takes you a few hours to unlock the useful ones.... 
---
Fair enough bro I didn’t know that 
---
Well shit. I bought the complete collection and recently the year 4 pass so idk how the other editions work.
---
It's actually a C7 series is Canadian. But Jackal's C7NLD is actually modified by the Dutch for their army. 
---
She has the lowest ranked win delta and the one of the lowest pick rates. She does well at range yes, but its not hard to get to cover from her shield
---
happy to help 
---
Literally just taken from reddit and not gonna give credit
---
Pretty sure she’s a 3 speed, 1 armor. 
---
Same bro I just bought the game 2 weeks ago for $80 CAD and now its $15. 
---
its gonna get taken down bcs this comunity sucks and bcs its a meme
---
Dead IQ, because IQ is dead in the vid.
---
Just need a full set of teeth
---
Why of all places here though? 
---
This is very true. I even tried to ping 'X' at times but obviously doesn't work. Also have clear vision of the objective. 
---
I mean it doesn't happen often but at times it waste time both during droning phase and when match begins!
---
Oh i cant wait😀
---
sounds like you had a great experience :) awesome!
---
Or "What the fuck are those!? What the fuck are these!?"
---
You need to work on your comebacks mate
---
Hahah me neither ^^
---
Oh yeah it looks really good but I imagine she'll get it soon if I'm not mistaken twitch got one back in grim sky so you never know
---
I 1v1ed my friend once as cav. Punched him to death
---
Yeah nah yeah fuck up cunt
---
Mashing x was also very often my art of dealing with it 
---
Those big ass traps always easier to spot elite or not, it all depends on placement
---
If i may ask is drawing your fulltime job or are u just so good naturally?
---
nah, let's keep realising iq and tachanka bundles that no one is goin to buy
---
Don't make me take my Ground Harness off and come up there!
---
Honestly just let them abuse game mechanics if they want. It's a scummy thing to do and shows what FaZe in R6 plays like
---
#angery chocolates 
---
Looks a lot like a super 8 or Mira's shotgun
---
Bird Box challenge since day 0.
---
Ironic
---
I predict she’ll get it like year 4 season 1 or 2 (2 is more likely imo but you never know)
---
Mann Netflix stole from the almighty lord 
---
r/unexpecteddarkestdungeon
---
70.000 renown and i am confused. Should i buy this skin. Or should i buy new operators of new season?
---
Sounds about right
---
Mute saw Cav's body fly past him and turned to you like "Oh shit...."
---
Yea, too bad Ubi couldn’t locate that either
---
hopefully her hitbox isnt that big as well
---
Well I use thumb “nubs” too and recoil and aiming is easy, maybe he needs to change attachments
---
And they changed "petrol" to "gas"! ubisoft smh
---
Perfection.
---
Would be funny if they fucked her up again
---
But for real tho, ubi can make some good looking faces (Valkyrie, Twitch elite, etc) so I have high hopes
---
Man thank God for the fat acceptance movement, just like anti vaxxers it’s going to wipe out all the idiots sooner or later.
---
If this is the new operator hope it’s hitbox is massive and it’s sprint speed is down 75% for balance.
---
It’s Mon-taj-en-E and K-EYE-d, right?/s
---
Owen Wilson and butch 
---
Gets vote kicked
---

---
I was just about to ask the same thing. I would love to have it available. 
---
Why do that when you could... look at it...?
---
Hibana all day. Her rifle is amazing and her gadget is my absolute favorite. 
---
[his name is Worraz!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R_M3K7j3rI)
---
Although it may be seen as unnecessary, its not a  bad thing.
---
The cost to unlock the legacy ops isnt that high, this still allows some choices to play as, and it can help alleviate the overwhelming feelings some may have with choosing from so many.
---
I assume they want to buy one and can't decide. 
---
Hibana, lesion is a cunt and so is anyone who mains him
---
As someone who is starting to main Ela I would really like this to be a bundle and not an Alpha Pack Exclusive. (I always get shit outta mine) 
---
unexpect e dabba?
---
Definitely 
---
you need to re-read it, says nothing about that, and knowing ubisoft i dont know why you would think they would give away the year 4 season pass like that when it's on sale for $30
---
Careful what u wish for, blitz pushing ur objective juiced up by a doc like with a finka boost sounds scary as shit
---
It really do be like that though.
---
It’s casual so it don’t count
---
It happened to me yesterday
---
Shield Ela is used to delay blue stairs push on Bank for as long as possible.
---
It iS MaAm! 
---
Please don't ruin Borderlands 2 for me. Thank you in advance
---
Hmmmmmmmm, see what ;)
---
Well for the first one, my pro leagues sets as well as other dlc items  transfer so if thats not considered special edition but the base game is, it doesn’t make sense.  im traveling right now, wont be able to purchase the ultimate until to tomorrow to do a little experiment. Im fairly certain it will transfer, and this may get interesting as Microsoft has specific terms that supersede publishers on their platform.
---
I think it’s called being 14 
---
yeye
---
Back in my day we had to buy our attachments
---
Will there be a discount on the season pass for us that already bought the complete edition? 🙄
---
Twas so worth it (crying internally)
---
None of the operators exist, the game is a work of fiction.
---
Already 100% completed it, best RPG I have ever played 
---
Recruit
---
Yeh, it sorta has a light scent of the scrapyard segment.
---
I could tell, EA BAD CDPR GOOD PRAISE GERALDO
---
This man is so thicc he's straight outta gears of war
---
&gt;Supports also get "points" do they not?
---
Not really, they get some but it would not be balanced at all.
---
Even if they can somehow balance the operator points, in teams there are roles for people, people drone for eachother, watch the flank (which may never come) or just make great callouts. 
---
These are even harder if not impossible to account for, but saying that they do not account for player skill that should determine your rank would be ignorant.
---
Siege is a team game, while it can be frustrating to get bad teammates the end result is that either you win or lose together.
---
Oh yes it would be
---
I thought you meant an ace with your crossbow. I was disappointed.
---
I am sorry for forgetting diesel. but I have not heard anyone call it fuel in Australia

I have gotten 5 total 3 of my lvl 170 main and 2 in my 110 alt

15 its right there in his username
---
Thanks for letting me know! I do, but I bought the year 4 pass before so I was mostly curious

Wtf give me your luck mate

---
3x0=0
---
HAAAAX! 
---
I only remember being able to afford XXXX
---
I had couple of moments in ranked games where one guy was insulting whole team because all operators this guy had were picked. If someone was merciful enough to let him pick for example kapkan, all his gun had this skin. I don't like this skin and it's too expensive but for God's sake, don't buy this skin if you dont have more than 6 operators in attack and defense.
---
Same problem, playing with a ryzen setup and apparently its a common issue, really annoying.
---
That's all I want for the game as well.
---
I guess he is talking about the Smoke fmg
---
I thought I was going crazy. Change it to last chance pub and all will be forgiven
---
Not petrol/fuel is probably interchangeable, rural areas have a lot more diesel vehicles so remote areas as depicted in the sign would probably say fuel 
---
Good luck with finding good teammates, we do exist
---
Petrol is what americans call gas. A lotta cars run on diesel, especially the type you would see in bum fuck nowhere like the map seems to be set. Fuels a compromise although it really should be petrol
---
plz no
---
In closed Beta on xbox everyone had to play recruit for one or two games til they could afford the first operator defenders were often running out not reinforcing a single wall, needless to say an m870 does poorly outside against an f2 or r4c
---
Both Caveira and Capitão are really difficult to pronounce for those who do not speak portuguese. Because both the '' EI '' of the Caveira and the '' ÃO '' of the Capitão have very characteristic pronunciation of Brazilian portuguese, so it is super normal for people to speak diferent with their native accent.
---
Better only call them ''Cav'' and ''Cap'' hahahaa
---
I feel like it's not just PC. I'd get TK'd so much more on console (xbox) for absolutely no reason now I barely get TK'd on PC even on solo queue because my teammate just 'felt like it'. I'm close to the same level that I was on console which was 169 (167) and have never had as many complaints as I did on console
---
Probably forgot to add attachments to the gun before the game started.

My friends are also facing this issue. I dont think this has something to do with my headset.

i agree. but i think there should be a page where you can record someone and then send it in this means if they VERY toxic or racist over voice comms then they can get a short ban and then it will get longer and longer. your thoughts?
---
&gt;Dok/Lion/Jackal/Blitz/Finka
---
Don't you love it when they type gr after
---
But wait, how does he watch cams without a phone?
---
The better I get at the game, the more I like it. 
---
I bought the gold edition last week because of the huge sale and missing Y2 &amp; 3 operators. Will get the year 4 pass now or not? Because i do have vip status on my account
---
Fair.
---
Wait. That’s Illegal.
---
Haha? Why tk? Not really funny or interesting imo.
---
Like i understood, people who bought a higher edition will not get dlc operators on other accounts. Creating a new smurf that doesn’t have all operators is kind of a discouragement. People will have to pay extra for a full smurf. If I got that wrong, then pls ignore me
---
It was all the way as you described back in y1s1 (black ice season), but it was hella broken and shotties were literal sniper rifles - so it was removed from the game cuz some of shotties like Super90 were too OP compared to dmrs and snipers
---
Hmm. Have you checked audio levels?
---
Waste their time by pretending to be afk in spawn the next round
---
I don’t play cav a lot but people leaving before I can kill them always make me giggle or even lol hard depending on situation, so for me that’s not an issue.
---
I fixed my FPS. Moved game from pretty full HDD to SSD and it netted me like 50 fps. I didn't even load slowly or anything before, additionally I turned ASYNC10_ENABLE to ON and ASYNC10_NVAPI_MODE to ALLOW_ALL using NVIDIA profile inspector, which I had enabled before but had to clean install my driver. This also improved my frame rate a fair amount. 
---
People use that?
---
They wont, casual people take the game way more seriously than ranked people. And even if they do, at least they cant kick you for some dumb shit
---
I better find a vb tallie or a bottle of Bundy or gtfo
---
Nice, 3 waiting simulators

Yeah this is fake I’ve seen this video played with a kid play GTA 5.
---
This
---
I don't know what it is about console gameplay but it looks smoother than my PC with a 75Hz monitor.
---
I remember very well, people playing shield then were about as cool to me as crouchspammers are now
---
Oh thank Christ 
---
Ok seriously. Every player that played before season 1 had to unlock them and didn't even have any DLC-ops. Guess what... those players didn't die. I mean that is like what 3 rounds for the first OPs? Do the simulations and you can already buy one before the first match even.
---
the skin YOU like maybe?

Everyone else is aware that ESL admins allowed the abuse of it and as a result they are perfectly within their right to abuse the fuck out of it. Regardless of anyone's personal opinions.

if its on console switch between wired and wireless internet i had the same problem 2seasons ago i dont know what happend but it was probably because of that give it a try

There is a trailer out on YouTube for the new map. It's called outback

This isn't something Ubisoft can fix, this is purely Microsoft and Sony's fault.

Meaning?
---
It's true..
---
If i bought the Advanced Edition a while ago do i now own the Regular version or the Deluxe with Y1 Operators?
---
Good point yeah didnt think of that
---
It's a script that you can load into your mouse, so, say, instead of having to tap for every shot, you can just click your mouse once and it'll send the signal to computer as if you click it 4 times. Also one of the more notable use is to automatically pull the cursor down so you can hold your aim while spraying without having to physically pull your mouse 
---
I wish I was southern. You guys gave all the cool slan.
---
Yeah they fixed this a few seasons ago. Sucks that it only works for bombers
---
He could always track the bombers, it looks like it's still just the bombers he's tracking I  this picture.

Gamingcirclejerk trolls are the most funny to me. When you take their bait instead of trolling more they just go "guys pls im making fun of you stop responding".

Hello MarksGotNoFans, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aq5s43/the_painful_realization_this_probably_wont_happen/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The real lyrics are "give me fuel, give me fire, give me that which I desire"
---
Go back to the gray quarter elf!
---
You know dark elves were just a way they could make people in the game raciest without the devs being called racist for making characters raciest.
---
I'm not going to lie. I completely forgot that hostage and secure were in ranked. I don't see why we can't have Pro settings but with the different objectives.
---
Even if every single operator carried a 2000 renown pricetag, it would be stupidly easy to unlock them all. Between club challenges and whatever pops up in the main menu the game throws renown at you. Really it’s just to give people something to do until they hit level floor for ranked. 
---
I actually forgot you have to unlock base ops lol.
---
I was happy but this changes a lot, luckily I haven't played it yet so refunding and will buy Deluxe and save $5 lol
---
Seriously, an overweight, not majorly but still, in the army? Ctus must be fit to Max out their capabilities
---
GJ
---
Australian?
---
This is 'murica
---
I don't think so. I think it just inflated the renown prices for the original operators.
---
Oh ok

Perfect for the "heroes never die" quote.

yeah aha I remember being told that when skull rain came out way back when 
---
Happens to me regularly, and it's really annoying. A few days ago i got killed by a Hibana that jumped through a window behind me. I heart her jump through and break the window, but didn't hear her hitting it two times before, which would definitily have warned me in time.
---
swear starter edition wasn’t out till year 2? 
---
If you are on steam i know you can remove your current edition of the game from your account and then buy another verison of it.
---
The closer you are to danger the farther you are from harm. They'll never expect it.
---
Yeah, you get recruit

If your not sure you could try watching some smoke tutorials on YouTube.

I"m just a lowly console pleb so take this with a grain of salt.
---
It seems like your issue is inefficient information usage.
---
Gathering information and swiftly acting on it can make or break a round. Especially in the early stages of the round (entry/roam clear). Droning while useful is a wast of time unless you have people behind those drones ready to capitalize on that information.
---
I would also suggest
---
Having an IGL to swiftly make changes to the strat.
---
As well as  having predetermined roles in terms of team composition.
---
I want that damn gun skin :/ 
---
Is this real? I find that really funny.

I would ask thermite if any training recruits went death from his exothermic charge/Texan dynamite
---
Yes
---
If you have no video, we really don't care. Remember to record your next one.
---
As far as I know, you can’t do that with PS4 controllers. Once again though, I could be wrong
---
After buying it, do you have regrets would you invest in one of the operators i mean skins and etc? How do you feel?
---
We say ground floor in the US too, it's just also the first floor.
---
I will ask clash, why she is bald and why she showed her tongue to maestro
---
I bought the complete edition before this announcement came out. Does this mean I still get Year 4 operators?
---
another ITA12short-like secondary. This is nice :)
---
Okay thanks
---
Well yes, someone would find it cool, and it would be fine to have an LGBT person. In the game, because it wouldn't matter, they have a job and if they can do it well then that's all that matters. But having her also be fat makes it a case of tokenism, and why would a spec ops be fat, they're supposed to be the elite of an army/nation. So in whole, I would have no problem if they were trans, but having them be fat is just stupid. Also hotboxes
---
## FEE FI FO FUM
---
you stay stuck in the loading screen, its often triggered when someone joins an ongoing match just has the round was about to start after someone left
---
This has many flaws but it's a decent idea. For example, what if you accidentally team kill? I know I have more than once. Or what if you choose to kick a toxic player and it turns out he had a "good guy" bonus? It would be no fault of your own yet you'd still have yours reset
---
Yep she can, if a teammate is downed while Finka activates her ability, he will be revived
---
Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
---
Very unhappy with part of this. The base operators should be free, and making them so was one of the most vital changes the game made for me. It went from a game I only played Rook in when I wanted to play to something I learned the nuances of. I'm so disappointed by this.
---
As someone who wasted a shit ton of time grinding terro hunt to unlock alk operators , I do.
---
I love how since year one people complained how Australia wasn’t in the game and now that it is they are nit picking the shit out of it. Like fuck who cares whether they call it gas or fuel? They’ve made tiny mistakes on every map for all cultures, just relax.
---
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man show the kill cam
---
Every time I would see it, it would the shit out of me.
---
same, I'm not sure if we get the previous deal or we will follow the new editions, last chance would be refunding &amp; buying deluxe edition I guess. 
---
Ash has the same hitbox as the other 3 speed female ops. You barely hit her with a very low DPS weapon.

I saved the video before the replay but even there you could see that his shield was on the side 
---
OOoooooooo YEEAAH!
---
I mean so just a better version of clash lol
---
Sometimes fan made ops are interesting. What's the harm in posting them, you dont have to look at the post.
---
https://steamdb.info/app/359550/ it hovered around $15-20 from discounts for the most part of a year already.
---
oh cool you can teamkill. grow up 
---
I'm not going to say no, but Australian language does not include cunt much if any. And if you're Australian you're not helping our image
---
It's a good idea but it's too giving. I'm not a toxic player but if I was I wouldn't really care about an extra boost or not 
---
Blitz in a 5v1, what a lad
---
pls ubi
---
There’s no harm in them but what always happens is the infographic game breaking or useless ops get to the front page while the decent ops in text posts aren’t read at all.
---
I fucking hate shield ops
---
It’s casual so setting up a proper defence isn’t usually on the minds of most players.
---
You have a point
---
It gets rid of the changed plant/defuse times too
---
Can’t tell if ur bein sarcastic😂😂😂
---
Good point. In that case, in addition to those changes, add the Forgive/Punish kick option too?
---
Better than a 2 tap shotgun with good recoil and range?
---
I use this spot often but I never see any others just it. If you have a Hibana/Thermite you can blow open that entire wall and have a decent view of meeting hall from the outside. Only issue i’ve ever encountered is defenders jumping out the window of the big tower
---
Yeah it's nice when you win but annoying when you carry 18 - 2 and still lose 😆
---
I really want another South American season like Argentina
---
before  the ectoplasm skin and the siege invitational skin black ice was the best weapon skin but not anymore
---
The range is trash, the kick is trash, and the only thing good about is the damage. Vigils is better if you yourself are better at the game. So if you were, then you would know that either one can instantly kill with a headshot, but one can get multiple quick and clean, and that one, is vigils Smg
---
This post should be upside down - an Australian
---
I hope so. Been wanting another South American based season for a while
---
Kinda stupid considering the default ops are pretty much all support, while also being easy to learn. If your team asks you to be bandit, you’re out of luck until you unlock him.
---
Is range is good as fuck, the kick is about the same as any DMR. You don't even need to get a head shot with Kaids shotgun, it's also very good for putting holes in walls. Also with the suppresser it's still very strong 
---
Forgot about that, I guess they could make time to secure longer or implement time to grab hostage
---
There’s another angle by junkyard where you can rappel up the small part of the roof and dome people trying to spawn peek from bathroom
---
Cause its a slug shotgun, im not saying its bad, im saying Vigils is better
---
You cant
---
This has happened way too many times to where I can't count. Ubi, fix it please.
---
only on console
---
My only critique, you didn't put an entire magazine into clash to humiliate the person playing her. Clash mains deserve it.
---
When I started playing Siege I exclusively played Sledge and Castle. Two very simple operators to learn and both fairly decent. Others such as Ash, Rook and Kapkan are easy too. Don’t use operators like Caveira just yet
---
That's how the world works? You won't be able to get 2000 Euros for your Pentium 2 nowadays anymore either. Stuff loses value over time.
---
Try changing email password. Might not do anything but hey it's something
---
Barely. Also, keep in mind OP said he wanted to. Anchor for a bit and roam. Kaid doesn't have much use on site after he puts his electroclaws down 
---
it's a trap ? im not speaking about the mat
---
No, I am genuinely serious. 
---
As much as I am a sarcastic dick at times in all of my time playing siege its not something i can honestly save i have ever witnessed. Interesting!
---
There is no grinding in this game, it's always too much fun! :D
---
This has been some shockingly bad patter like
---
They are only sandgropers if they are from WA.
---
Depends on the map and skill level. I haven't run breach charges in years because I kept getting wallbanged placing them.
---
Man th e Learning curve on this game is steeper than mount Everest lmaoo jk but in all seriousness though it's quite difficult
---
Hello N1tr0_SK! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
possibly
---
Well, ask Ubi why they named the only Jewish operator Ash. 
---
If you're asking whether or not I'm anti-Semitic, that's a whole different debate I'd not like to lead on a public forum that's absolutely unrelated to that topic.
---
It took me a good few months to actually get used to, very underrated game in terms of how complicated it can be. Just need to stay patient and you’ll learn things as time goes by
---
Hes a better anchor than Vigil as he is meant for anchoring, unlike Vigil who is a roamer. Both of them can its just that they have different attributes for their jobs of anchoring and roaming. 
---
Yes, I know, and I have. But some people haven't. And that's an issue. The whole community improves, when we cut down on opportunities to play poorly. Secure area teaches bad habits. 
---
And casual needs to be at most 3:30 minute rounds. I'd prefer 3, but that may be too short for some levels.
---
I don’t think a first person shooter about special forces operators is the best place to push an agenda bud. That’s my attitude towards this. Nothing more, nothing less. 
---
THANK YOU. Every time someone posts one, for the next week or two all these other shitty ones start popping up. 
---
Same with in game "selfies" *my whole team left so I took a pic with the enemy*. Then the entirety of the sub is just shitty screenshots. 
---
It's sir curling stupid. 
---
I'm a sound whore...
---
Imagine how op mira would be though, and there is no hard breach on defense.
---
Yep I'm determined to get good and learn as time goes by wish me luck!

hibana if you need an attacker, maestro when you need a defender
---
Sadly... Reinstalling didn't seem to help, and I can't even get the Extra section in the profile inspector. I click  the button on the top right and it doesn't pop up :(
---
It's a trivially small amount of renown that forces people to research who their next operator should be, and then spend a few matches with them. Good idea. 
---
Lol just a bit 😜
---
Nerf this tatoo
---
Everybody used that spot constantly 
---
😆 I just loved that show!
---
So it hit the first guy, killed him, fell and exploded and killed the second guy?
---
Well, this does make sense since in most other games, the sniper is usually highlighted by a bright light. 
---
Although, he’s probably about to have his smokes taken away regardless..
---
In close quarters it's insane, just don't ads. 
---
No you don’t, you will still have your ops
---
gotta catch'em all
---
Rule 34 it
---
Personally I'm in a constant state of disappointment when it comes to the state of, and the lack of trying to improve, casual.
---
YoU dO rEaLiSe ThE yEaR 2 OpS wIlL gO oN sAlE tHiS yEaR rIgHt 
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhh
---
i feel like this is a problem more with how you are playing than the system
---
Wait it's 50hp
---
It killed the Castle on impact then killed the Jäger with the explosion. 
---
This, you shouldn't magically know enemies location because u were killed by them.
---
My guess is it stayed on the body as it fell backwards and exploded right next to the Jäger
---
Blitz should be deleted from the game entirely.
---
Map teaser/trailer released monday. 2 days later meaning wednesday Mozzie CGI teaser. 2 days later meaning friday Gridlock CGI teaser. That's how this works for like 1.5-2 years now.  They showed a teaser yesterday to hype people up for the upcoming season. And the teaser also contained Gridlock even tho we didn't saw him. Character CGI trailers mostly be about them selfs.
---
I lost my red crow seasonal universal like a month after that season ended. Spent rainbow credits on it too. I’ve made three support tickets since then on the matter and have never gotten any response. 
---
Because cargo shorts
---
Maestro. 
---
They do that in America, too - at least in larger buildings like offices and city skyscrapers.
---
What if I bought the advanced edition? I just got it on 20th December and I regret it now :(, with this price I can get gold/deluxe now.
---
Same
---
Loli
---
Not sure how you could feel bad about that when you now have access to all the base ops for free without the grind to get them. 
---
Literally, if they want to balance ELA with her massive damage dropoff over distances and insane recoil, just give her impacts! She's a 3 speed she basically needs them, a shield is not useful for a roaming operator. Come on Ubisoft.
---
Why though lmao 
---
I believe its a skin for invitational atendees for Jagers primary only. It was listed as an item available for those who had purchased the vip ticket for the event. 
---
pls dont nerf my legs i need 'em
---
It should be petrol!
---
yea im stupid i just now got that
---
I feel the same way Civil_vagina_puncher
---
Oh ok thanks 
---
Casino is a no no if ubisoft want to sell their game in china. 
---
Blitz should not have a melee.
---
It really is. For example: people on the East coast of Australia pronounce derby with an "a" sound instead of an "e", where as over on the West coast we don't. I'm curious as to how small changes like this one originated.
---
how much do I get paid and is it hourly or based on files renamed
---
I have been playing from chrimera and still can't control the scorpion that well
---
Fuze is going to kill himself and Pinky.
---
CQB the knife will always win.
---
Yes, everyone who played back then remembers release Ela. Dosnt mean she cant be shown some love every now and then.
---
Yep. I dunno how much you need to reduce the ADS by though, Probably 5-10 I would guess.
---
people die, memes don't
---
And then players who actually like the casual rule set, even if it's occasional, lose that way to play entirely for what purpose? Please keep in mind that not everyone treats every game mode as a step toward being a pro. I recognize there is a gap between casual and ranked which will always exist unless the modes have the same (or similar rule set). I can at least understand if the suggestion were to make them play the same save for possibly round count and receiving a rank, but I don't understand why casual has to be drastically changed if the end state isn't going to mirror ranked.
---
No, instead that i feel like im downed almost bleed out but then doc shoots me with stim gun
---
Ah yes. The classic "if you care it makes you wrong" argument. So full of insight and wisdom. You're right. Next time I'll let you draw the line about the issues players allowed to care about.
---
When you're in a more highly populated area you tend to focus more on your immediate surroundings, because that's where things are happening. What's the problem with somebody asking another person directly instead of searching it up? Would you be annoyed with someone asking you where a (corner) gas station is instead of looking it up on Google maps?
---
Exactly, But I get what you mean on Mozzie being a bigger women, I mean I don't see people crying about Valkyrie having big muscles so technically Mozzie is a more bigger version of Valkyrie, When Valkyrie first released I didn't like how muscular she was but I got used to it because they took inspiration from the first woman who signed for the Navy SEALS training and gave up.
---
You’re about the damage drop. It’s in line with other pistols. But chaining long range shots is harder. Less damage but also less damage drop is understandable, but the clip is 12 rounds and and non-ads shots are much less accurated.
---
I just cameback from vacance, and saw that i have Digital content and Currency pack locked too, i don't know why :(
---
That must not be consistent throughout the country, I think it just depends on the person. Everyone I’ve known says basement, first floor, second floor, etc
---
wow you are lucky my team recruit rushes and dies in the first 10 seconds.
---
So droning is bad, ok
---
awesome dude, thank you very much, time to hit some Thunt and customs and start messing around 
---
He clutched a casual match where it was a 1v5 the whole time
---
Agreed. As much as I like it, don't really need an acog on my close quarters sidearm.
---
Jesus the sockets! On villa they completely fucked up the sockets, that's not what is used in italy, italian villa in tuscany with...american sockets &gt;.&lt; come on Ubi.
---
No, a meme's death is when it gets annoying or is no longer funny. lOrD cHaNkA Xd or fooking laser soights are certainly not funny anymore. It's like how no one uses troll face unless they are 9. It is a dead meme.
---
It s not about droining, he is playing with his tablet... I can't believe you didn't get it mate... 
---
lots of long hallways and 90s 
---
LMG's are by design, not meant to fire fast, but to saturate an area with fire.  However, that doesn't really translate well into a video game like Siege.  
---
No im not lucky, i just wanna stay downed. Not get up and fight againts school :(
---
So?
---
I’m trying to be mean or anything, but like were you sure you wanted it when you got it? Or was it out of impulse?
---
Someone is kinda a cunt isnt he :/
---
Very judgmental. 
---
I want to see you clutch them at then
---
"tablet" 
---
You could make it so that while in bot mode it can’t get interrogated 
---
there’s no killcam in road to s.i mode though 
---
Did you try and pick out the few cases of overweight weight lifters when you Google "professional female weight lifters", because that's what it looks like you did. 
---
I have clutched several times dude that too in plat elo so ......
---
Yeah that just shows in what direction ubisoft is going. And i thought Siege would stay unaffected by this
---
But was it a 1v5 the whole game?
---
I got called a coward for using that spot after a guy almost killed me by spawn peeking that door. 
---
Awesome collage op! Don’t know what the guy above me is taking about, but it looks great!
---
That too but I’m talking about shields 
---
But then if she shot to kill him and not interrogate, it would give away her position for no reward
---
Well... is your GPU driver up to date?
---
We will see the skins when they give us patch notes... which should be in 4 days, on Sunday, when we get the Season reveal.
---
Wish you some sens of humour
---
Ah, I remember the days of my first ace. You’re gonna look back on this clip one day and go “holy shit were all of us baaaaaaad”
---
Casual pleb aren't you?
---
Thanks for replying! What makes 90s bad?  
---
I get why too many long hallways is bad, since they benefit acogs(and thus attackers) a lot and make it diffuclt to flank since you're spending so long in a vulnerable position without cover when you're moving down them.
---
Why doesn't google have a translate function from G'day to English
---
I mean, the difference would mainly be site selection in my idea. What's wrong with site selection? I think being able to pick an operator suited to the site would be an upgrade over the old system, same thing with spawn locations for attackers. 
---
Yeah, I was sure. All of my tattoos are fun &amp; are based around things that mean a lot to me. For example I have a wild wasteland tattoo from Fallout New Vegas, a Lilo and Stitch tattoo, a tattoo from my favourite podcast etc. I like decorating my body with things I enjoy :) 
---
what is that skin??????
---
She's down
---
So people aren’t allowed to post their opinions anymore on a public forum? I’m not defending any posts here, as I haven’t read them all, but I am defending people’s right to dislike something due to looks. If people think that clash looks weird and defend that reasoning by saying that she’s bald I feel that’s fine. There are bald people in the world who look similar to clash, but that doesn’t mean that everybody needs to find them  attractive or like the look. There are also women with masculine features, but just because they exist doesn’t mean that everybody needs to find them attractive or cool looking. People are allowed to dislike the creations of Ubisoft just as they are free to not find every single person on this planet as an extremely attractive or beautiful individual. 
---
I just feel it’s a little harsh to blanket criticize people for not liking the look of new ops. If they added in a new weapon and I disliked the look of the new weapon and made posts about how I hated the new weapon and it looked bad for reasons ABC no one would care. Some people would agree, some would argue my points, but at the end of the day it’s my opinion, and I’m allowed to express it. 
---
Then clearly you're blind mate. He did something cool yeah we all agree with him on that but the name being everywhere is ruined it. If it was on the some corner just like how it should be it was fine lol.
---
But how will the rest of the ops work upside down?
---
Looks great for a 6 year old.
---
u just killed all my dreams
---
Soooo, take away the things that make her unique?
---
I hope there's an easter egg thats like something thats been written on but its upside down, or maybe those secret rooms only drones can enter but the room is upside down.
---
As I have pointed out to all of those people. No she fucking doesn't. 99% of professional female weight lifters look much for trimmed than she does. Literally almost all of them. 
---
Also, just because that other 1% can lift weights doesn't mean their physique is fit for active duty. Stop being absurd.
---
Why is it on pc h/v is low and ads is high?? I play xbox and i play 90/70/20... i like the slower ads movement but high hip fire turn 
---
Woo!
---
Unlike her gadget? 
---
Randomly getting a hacker makes you lose MMR? Pretty lame
---
So you judge for not laughing for post which has like trillion versions of it
---
If you use 6-6-69 you will get the same sensitivity as 5-5-83
---
Quit crying OP. There are two Genders, change my mind. Freaking weirdo
---
That’s all other roamers though 
---
i know. I is supposed to lower the amount of people that hack but I doubt it will.
---
Prepare for invading
---
The whole idea behind Ela was that she can take on multiple people at once with her magazine. That's what they said when they released her.
---
Taking her mag away and giving her impacts just makes her the same as every other roamer. 
---
Just shoot her in the head lmao.
---
Ash has a larger hitbox than Mira...
---
He said downvoting cause american
---
Giving her a singular rock as a primary weapon makes her unique, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be effective hahahahahaha 
---
Or give them a second pistol that’s identical but without the scope
---
Amen !!! Like Bank is one of the largest maps but it doesn't feel large because of the huge lobby area. Then we have fortress which i think has somewhat the same size as bank but just consists of a trillion small rooms with a myriad og angles to check..... Smaller UBI !!! smaller !!!

Steam says contact Ubisoft.

No, my friend got all the ops without paying any renown, i think its only the new players.

Coastline is probably in my top 3 least favourites. Border, Villa and Kafe are okay but I actually like Favela

Wait really? I guess I lucked out then because I just switched from PS4 to PC

Well it does say 'Standard edition' on his steam.
---
the clip made me laugh lol, nice job!
---
I guess it's time to contact Ubi then!!
---
I feel like themepark is a balanced map with lighting Issues. Hereford I feel like has deeper issues in it's design specifically the top floor. 
---
Favorite ranked map: Oregon
---
Favourite casual map: Favela and Plane tied. Both are shit for ranked, but are really fun maps to mess around on casual.
---
Least favourite ranked map: Bank, all because of those fucking sprinklers in vault.
---
Least favourite casual map: House, only because its so damn small. Tower is a close second since having good roamers makes the map fucking miserable for attackers and you're always watching flanks.
---
Maybe the team left after the operator voting?
---
Yep, the Standard Edition was changed yesterday.
---
They should be cloaked like lesions lulw
---
Honestly it does all piece together well with the leaks we have too.
---
Plus the fact that it is Y4S1, so they would want to show off something cool for Y4 and to hype the Invitationals. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you were right with all this. 
---
No, you're mixing them up.
---
All the puzzle pieces are coming together and it pretty sure looks like the leaks were right.
---
Agreed I'm. Not down to play skyscraper, Chalet, themepark, fortress, and Hereford all in a row.
---
❤️
---
I literally do not play ranked anymore purely because Kafe is in the map pool. I actually despise it more than every other map combined.
---
Oh lol. Will let him know. And yeah I did buy it a few minutes before him
---
oops i put a photo of apes,it was supposed to be a gun.
---
Plane is good too
---
Wait, what's wrong with those maps? I'm not exactly a fan of chalet but skyscraper and kafe are good.
---
Your content is genuinely fantastic, I wouldn't hesitate to pay if that meant getting the source quality of your works!
---
thanks :) I got him like a week ago and I love messing with people.
---
What do you mean this teaser hasn't revealed their gadgets!? The guys gadget is his motorcycle (vroom! vroom!) and the girls is a gun!
---
Thanks!
---
They want to make Frost stronger. Her traps are really easy to spot. This would be a rework because they would have to change the way the trap looks and at the same time it would be a buff. The hitbox would be smaller but they could reduce the hp of the trap to be more balanced. This rework would be perfect because the trap it's pacticly the same but better.
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one that noticed this, gridlock seems to fit the described character of the defender way more. I’m super excited to try him out just based on his personality 
---
I was the Sledge and I died so that's just not true.
---
Also, I'm a bot so it wouldn't have mattered.
---
The new meta has been revealed
---
I don’t mind Kafe. Theme Park is my biggest downfall on ranked
---
Yeah definitely pick and ban.  Just not banning new ops or Lion because PL bans them.  You still pick and ban.
---
It all makes sense because the leak came out around the time that we usually get the roadmap and they most likely delayed it because they didn’t want to prove the leakers right
---
This was the only time we tried it
---
Instant death
---
Thicc grill
---
What I meant is that this is not the Lord; this is Kapkan.
---
I don't really bother with Meme Park. Just find the lighting a bit annoying at times.
---
That is one helluva oof
---
I mean Ubi banning ops to match PL.  they would all be available and subject to pick/ban.
---
Frost is really bad in any competitive level of play without really good placement at the moment. I think this would be a nice buff though I could see it being ridiculous when combined with barbed wire. This would definitely make Frost a top-picked operator though I think they would have to nerf her gun in return.
---
Don't forget it updates every second

oh

Idk I’m not one of them, probably just laziness tho

That would change the point of Frost, her mat is the only trap that isn't electronic (can't be countered by IQ, Twitch or Thatcher).

Jackal would become a roamed I think...

The original Mad Max was just rural Australia, It wasn't even a post apocalyptic film. Though there was hints of society starting to collapse in the first film, it wasn't until the squeals that the movies went with the post apocalypse setting.

Don't join random people's parties on the enemy team, because some people have been booted offline after they joined them.

That is not cheating at all

Baiting. Imagine you are hunting a crocodile. You could kill the croc, but it would be much easier if you threw a a teammate in for him to chew on so he isn’t focused on you. So you do that so you can kill him. You just baited your teammate

I know, i wasn't on board with the system since there were occasions of falls bans but they changed the system and i basically got banned that doesn't even exist

Hahaha amazing! Gridlock is hilarious!

I used to get that really bad, but I’ve been playing the game forever now and it still happens but not much at all. I know what your talking about it happens to everyone

It was from the PlayStation store so I’m sure it would be the up to date version

They're like Junkrat and Roadhog.

Just swap to another drone and swap back to yours, than it will detect it 
---
K&amp;M lol
---
Yeah, that's why I said 'fundamentally changing' the mode, because both P&amp;B and pro league rules are no minor changes. Of course it's important to keep the game updated and roll out tweaks and fixes like adding an extra prop to avoid spawn peeking. 
---
My point was that Counter-Strike had the same old mode for years and everyone was fine about it. The same with Dota but you also have extra modes including a separate captain's mode for those who want to feel the pro scene type of the game with 10+ mins pick and ban phase. 
---
Thats... Actually.. A really good idea.
---
Honestly if you want a bigger fps boost, upgrade your gpu if you can gather up around $200 usd (around 265 cad) you can get a gtx 1060 6gb on newegg, the difference is pretty big.

You should go ask them for a refund because it fucking sucks

Aw

I average the same. Its more about knowing where to place them than it is the enemy seeing them.

Sorry I was sort of interpreting your idea as a place able gadget like a flood light or something.

Amazing 
---
Make it so EVERY pistol (Other than revolvers, that might cause issues) has a sight much like Ela, Zofia and Clash's Red Dot, maybe add an alternate choice like a Reflex Sight(But for pistols) or maybe something as simple as a Ring Sight.
---
I'm fine with the .44 having a scope(to be honest it was the last thing we would expect to see on a pistol in this game) but think about the other sidearms!
---
Siege is a TEAM oriented game that does rely on communication and coordination, that's what makes it unique from other games. A lot of your complaints hinge on the premise that the new system is punishing solo play, which I agree to a degree that it does. However, the ranked playlist should not be built for solo players. 
---
1. Your first point is completely  contradictory everything Siege is about. Whether you like it or not, communication is key in this game. If your team don't talk to each other or make callouts or coordinate operators, you're instantly at a disadvantage to any team that does those things. 
---
2. I see where you're coming from on this point. I have a few friends that set their game to secure area only in ranked because they find it's more fun and balanced. While I find bomb to be a little more fair, I would get bored with bomb every single time. The non-pros wouldn't be able to exploit secure area as badly as the pros. Bomb only is terrible for Echo mains as well. I see both sides of the argument on this point.
---
3. Again, this is going back to your anti-team, anti-communication argument. You say that "You can't get anything close to their level of communication, map knowledge and teamplay with random people," which I would agree... if you had to play against pro players... but you don't. In ranked, you play against players at your skill level. No one has their map knowledge and no one needs it except for them. 
---
4. You are definitely in the minority in this point. Very rarely will players ban random operators unless you are a bronze or copper level player (that would make your points make a little more sense). P&amp;B is appreciated by teams because you can either ban OP ops like Lion and Echo on bomb, or site specific ops. Even if you are a solo queue player, you can get a sense of what your other players want to do in the ban faze. Very rarely do you have a full team of solo players on one team. I usually queue with 4 players, and our one solo player usually went along with what we wanted to ban. If you're frustrated with the P&amp;B, I'd find a team to coordinate with.
---
5. Siege is extremely toxic anyways and tking definitely is a problem since this gamemode is in casual at the moment. Those problems are already present in ranked right now and that's never going to change.
---
6. I agree with you on this point that getting a smaller map rotation would get boring. Although, I absolutely hate playing on unbalanced maps in ranked. I'm split on this take so this is a valid point.
---
I think you need to find a team to coordinate with in ranked. Siege is a game that requires coordination in ranked gameplay and most of the time you'll play teams that communicate. I don't want Ubi to start coddling solo players and making the game anti-communication. I hate to be this guy, but if you're frustrated with teammates in ranked, you're just going to have to play casual. That gamemode is definitely geared towards solo players.

Well since thermite charges don't count as teamkills anymore, nothing is going to be done

It contained nuclear stuff apparently. And was attacked by terrorists. So... 
---
She needs a rework, not a buff. Her problems aren't just that she's not good enough, it's that she feels shitty to play as and shitty to play against because her gadget relies completely on people happening to not check the exact spot where a trap is. It ends up feeling completely luck based on both sides, which isn't good design when it instantly downs
---
I play only ranked with two to three of my friends and 4 out of 10 randoms we get will never even at least try to type something in chat to give you at least basic info. And we're playing on plat.

Realistic if you live in an elephant enclosure. How would someone of her even size pass selection. Ubisofts female operator models are so hit and miss.

Zoomed in it looks kind of like a high powered slingshot or compact crossbow, definitely not a normal handgun at least.

Making the trap harder to see while keeping the insta down would be terrible for this game.

Do they sound Australian to you? They really sound authentic Australian as some operators have their accents forced.

Well that is kind of what we see now. Almost every match I see Lion/Blitz banned. I think banning operators because they are OP at least helps with dealing with peaks and valleys of balance. In a perfect world everything is balanced and the Ban phase is more strategically used.

You will receive some things like the New Operators, but not account specific things like the R6 credits.
---
I'm pretty sure ALL the new editions revert to the original unlock system of progressively increasing renown for each CTU, with the total renown needed being MUCH lower than the starter edition, like 500-2000 for original ops.
---
Knifing to and from shields needs to be removed entirely if Ubi is incapable of fixing this issue.

Sorry I didn’t know.

Wow well what timing, thanks! Where was the announcement for that? I must have missed it
---
Probably no, she would only be a good close quarters op, and this would only kind of work on a map like fortress, villa, etc. with lots of little rooms. Like in Bank, “they’re main lobby” well where? And don’t even get started on a casual map like house. She would *only* be used as an intel operator and not really help her team get frags because of how easy it would be to save yourself from roamers pushing you. It would be a total rework of not only her play style, but her place in the game.
---
Nice guns. Sub par "special". Not up to standard with the other operators.

I’m alright without the credits. So I do have to wait until they release to either get them or download the pass?

---
I came back around a month after I posted this originally and played it pretty consistently up until around 3 weeks ago. It's starting to get boring again, but the release of Apex Legends is now taking more of my time than Siege and is helping me take a break. I appreciate Ubi for rethinking their stance of the Chinese market and am I glad people had a similar stance to mine to not let Developers walk all over their player base in order to make more money. 
---
I am excited for year 4 and I hope they start taking the game back to what it originally was with more operators that require teamwork for them to work properly (i.e. basically any operator that does not have a global ability like lion or finka) and I hope their map design begins to improve, because goddamn these maps from the last year and a half or so have been hot shit (other than Villa and Fortress, they're okay). Thanks for replying to this 3 months later just to ask how I have been when it comes to siege :)
---
All new versions reverted to the original unlock system or progressively increasing amount for each CTU.
---
Maybe OP is smurfing due to free weekend lol
---
Sorry Base ops. Got it confused. So they are locked even on complete edition now?

I'm aware what the inspiration for it was.

I'm saying, what the "backstory" is for Rainbow being there in the first place. Yes, i'm aware of the popular theory that PvP is just Rainbow VR training themselves. And I do believe that theory.

From a developer's point of view, this is generally done to alleviate the frustration of the player who is reloading.   
---
I know the situation you're describing and it is 500% infuriating as the person who dies to it, but role reverse for a second and think about how many people would get all ass-salted because the animation was un-cancellable. I believe it used to be the case in white noise (?) where you could not disrupt your own reload, but they changed it due to players complaining too much about the lack of a reload cancel that other industry leaders have in their games.

What is Buck's thing? It says an under-barrel shotgun, but I have 0 idea what that means. I assume just a powerful shotgun attachment? 
---
I saw a post somewhere a couple of hours ago and was like wtf
---
Get back to the for honour thread you heathen 
---
I’m not gonna even watch the video but I already know It’s just the same video upside down
---
Except you loose no matter what
---
Especially if you have one of the Australians on your team 
---
but the Thunt bots are pretty crap 
---
Not as good as getting an alpha pack out of an alpha pack
---
What part of Siege isn't based in reality? All of the gadgets currently in the game could theoretically be made with todays technology. Even Outbreak could happen. Prove me wrong!!!
---
45 000 000 accounts rather than players
---
damn vigil ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
This is single handedly the most retarded post I've seen through out my 6 months of reddit
---
I think bandit because all other gsg-9 ops have elites already 
---
YEET

/r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow PSAs because of repetitive abuses.

Choose a different title and re-submit your post. Thank you.

Was that actually you orrr?
---
Cuz I didn't hear him/you I realized what was covered realised that cav was over there earlier and thought to look and saw him/you then 1+1 = 2
---
Good breaching tool. Also good for cqb combat 
---

Maybe I'll go abit higher but for now this is what I'm comfortable with :)
---
Why does this trigger you so much?
---
Pretty much what it means
---
Its a shotgun attachment on a dmr/ar
---
im wondering two but cant find it anywhere :(
---
DEUS VULT DEUS VULT DEUS VULT
---
I agree but they would alleviatea lot of inflated report logs if they would set a limit on how much damage you can cause your team before you get kick-banned. 
---
Like, auto-kick = 200 damage, not two kills
---
Yes but so does Smoke and Tachanka 
---
I'm not triggered it's just stupid 
---
[mp4 link](https://i.giphy.com/4HguryXzmjxCKkOQq5.mp4)

This mp4 version is 82.62% smaller than the gif (2.23 MB vs 12.82 MB).  
---
False sense of satisfaction
---
Other than that, no.
---
Why is that?
---
deserved it
---
Wasn't me. I've been flicked before and it rages me cause I had every advantage. And I get double checking but you flicked right at his head and ended him without any looking at all.
---
i tried now after a long ranked session and it works in part: it give me an error "you cannot go on" with a security error
---
She thicc everywhere
---
ok no it works, ty mate 
---
Docs doesnt, he literally smokes a pipe. It works with the road to SI
---
They’re most likely going to rework tachanka and bandit has been in the game for longer, so I’d expect he gets an elite before buck or the others 
---
*As for what's in the canister, it's best you don't ask*
---
Agreed to operators in general.   
---
I have a massive IRL hard-on for Zof/Ela's sidearm, but I really dislike using it in seige because of the RDS and green laser. So I usually forgo using it in Siege to my dismay. I feel like this would fix issues for other CTUs that have had their pistol irons constantly re-adjusted. Instead of perfecting the irons so that it is a "everyone likes this" basis, allow us options that primaries have (Not all of them, obviously). Being able to chose irons or an optic on your pistol would be incredible. (And the ability to remove "special" attachments.)
---
How would he smoke it through his balaclava? 
---
Not anyone else’s problem who because your friend has an issue with jealousy. Black ice looks spicy btw
---
Oh tats shit
---
As i went to look I saw him and it just happened he was right where I was looking I mean if I was hacking or something why the fuck would I clip it and put it here??
---
Hello joeyesfinna, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aqcaqq/pro_league_ready/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah it's a shot gun attached to either of his primary weapons you toggle between. It's a great breaching tool for soft walls and hatches and even for destroying floors from above or underneath to get greasy kills.. the c8 rifle isnt a slouch either plus he gets drag grenades
---
Started playing R6, was able to unlock all the operators within the year and outbreak 
---
We'll see 😃 
---
Show us
---
Well if they shoot you by accident then they would get banned for accidental tk. I think that if someone downs multiple teammates and doesn’t revive them like they do in a reset they should get banned, or else people might get banned for a reset or something other that accumulates 
---
She a thicky
---
Wouldn’t bother uninstalling and reinstalling, just up the sense until it’s where it used to be 
---
Before you jump on the witchhunt train, actually watch the video. Thanks. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dp-0_hvOeiA
---
Yo she got that dumpy
---
If she is T H I C C she must be T H I C C in all of her body
---
Oh, okay. I didnt know if it was just a literal description, or if was being vague.
---
Whilst slow breathing is someyhing I do in usual bouts of stress. In gaming it's way harder since, if I do that, I relax, and I can't both relax and have quick reaction times. I'm always tense from the moment I enter the building to the moment of death of my character/victory screen. This is bad yes, but there is no way to really trian that to my knowledge, if the game makes me stressed I'm not gonna be able to prscrise it sithout dying, if it doesn't make me stress...what's their to practise?
---
Lmao they’re upside down. 
---
Thats why you should stay with monty not blitz, ahem monty main
---
Sorry taking down now
---
Ikr, or get a lesion that will slow us down or stop the push
---
Because you shot them
---
You could say that ubisoft, loved that dog to death.
---
On the official website it displays Mozzie as the guy and Gridlock as the grill.
---
Smokes gas
---
I shot below his waist and it was a headshot 
---
You're basing your assignment of his name on your assumption that he's the attacker. That's contrary to the one point that is clear from what we know: biker man is the defender.
---
IT'S SO EVOCATIVE
---
It's my life
---
Maybe try ranked you fucking idiot 
---
Grenade launcher would be under powered or super over powered it would be like a belt feed impact grenade launcher 
---
I love it! Looks great
---
Nice 👌 Is the handle built around a PVC pipe?
---
Yes the setting under t-aa. You can leave sharpness at 50 while you are finding the setting that works for you. You should be able to play at 50% scaling or better. Once you find the scaling you can bump the sharpness to 100 probably or leave it, it doesn't matter too much.
---
Thankyou so much!!! 
---
with people like this if you record them doing it and send it to ubisoft support you could be able to get them banned. but if enought people spread this on reddit then ubisoft might find a way to implement a change to stop this from happening.
---
Not racing but chase action maybe.
---
That's the one thing that always gets on my nerve
---
I'm just happy I'm not the only one with a real crusader helmet
---
Seems pretty normal for someone who mains Blackbeard 
---
No. Ubi said they hated Outbreak and don't want to waste resources doing it again. 
---
Chimera 
---
its ok!
---
As a frost main, please dear lord
---
No you clearly hip fired lol
---
Why is it always buck
---
Situations like these are why the saucy meatball man is my defensive main.  These situations and the glorious ALDA.
---
Wait, did they really give Swags his own charm??
---
lol nice
---
color is super vibrant. looks really good OP
---
you sir are an idiot why would they release a 1 speed, 3 armor attacker for? are you dyslexic or something can you not see she#s a 1 speed, 3 armor no way is she gonna be a 2 speed/2 armor
---
also there's this leak how's it feel embarrassing yourself?
---

---
And it all started with worraz, cuz he's an asshole!
---
Never said I aimed but okay
---
Why are my eyes sweating right now
---
i'm fairly certain if you filtered by unique IP's it'd be less than half. between all the banned accounts and the smurfs i'd struggle to believe the actual numbers are anywhere near these
---
Thanks, dude!
---
r/crusadememes
---
The animation quality in this... His movementis soooooo good
---
Yeah agreed 
---
You can definitely see the difference between anchor(probably) and pusher.
---
It's doing exactly what a trailer for anything should do, which is set up the characters in their own world, their dynamic, and, eventually, their role in the game, without giving away too much of the fun.
---
Loving every bit of it.
---
ignore OP they're misleaded or they're trolling
---
Isn’t that the Bear trap from new Vegas dead money 
---
I want climb that rock 
---
An operation I'm actually excited forrrrrrrr
---
I swear the clunking sound that it makes is scarier than playing Outlast.
---
Mhh blackbeard and his papershield is really scary
---
Bandit, Smoke, Montagne, Tachanka, none have elites, all been out at the same time. And didnt ubi say they werent reworking Tachanka because of his meme status
---
DEUS VULT BROTHER
---
AD MORTEM INIMICUS
---
*insert “yeet”comments*
---
how about during drone time when we tag them
---
Proof?
---
Mockit full tilt after that
---
The hip fire is random, you may get a headshot, you may not, you never know
---
She is countered by anyone with a drone.
---
I still feel like that would be busted.  The developers have acknowledged that Lion was the biggest mistake they’ve made, even Tachanka (their second biggest mistake).  From Lion and Tachanka, they’ve realized that forced someone to be stationary, even for “only” 3 seconds (60% of the planting time btw), does not work in Siege, given all the information and destruction that both sides have at their disposal.  
---
TL;DR: Lion is busted, and the reason for that is because he forces people to be stationary in a game built around information and moving.
---
Oi fucking oathhhh cunt
---
Yup
---
There’s a reason Kapkan isn’t a one edd kill anymore as much as I loved him. The only possible way would be to make it have a beep and be able to be spotted by IQ
---
not quite, i'm just messing with estereotypes. in portuguese it's bruXa
---
really?
---
East anglia
---
Nomad is just as busted as lion tho

You stated that you specifically aimed at and only at his waist which is only posible when aiming.
