Ubi should really attempt at making an singleplayer campaign for R6, the lore has amazing potential, it could cover operetors pasts (bandit being an undercover drug dealer etc.), their relations with other characters like idk someone having beef with someone else on the team
---
&gt;Again, not how it works. You really aren’t absorbing anything I’m saying.
---

---
So then how does it work? Who is paying Ubisoft?
---
&gt; Yes actually, because that’s how it works. Netflix take x cut with expectation of y total and in the case of not reaching that has z contingency to cover those losses, which comes straight out of Ubi’s bank.
---
Except Ubisoft isn’t losing anything if Netflix paid to have their item advertised.
---
Capitao and Cavs pistols are more than likely made by Taurus in São Paulo, Brazil in what was once a beretta factory... hope that clears it up for you. 
---
IRL it’s called the PT92 which is commonly used by BOPE
---
But then players could just intentionally aim at the teammate they wanted to kill when they ran into the gadget and they would receive no punishment...
---

As cool as this is, I would hate the stone fuking much,
---
Literally any shotgun can load slugs...
---
I really dont see why you assumed this would be a sniper.
---
That looks like my friend ajay
---
Hes one of the best solo players. He's good at flanking around and opening up a kill hole while the team distracts.
---
I think that's Kali.
---
I think the Taurus would be the easiest to track down in a replica fashion between the two
---
this just feels like ela with extra steps, i would prefer if the flash flash like 3 times in a short span of time

Regarding Valk’s arms: How heavy are those cams?? No wonder she can chuck ‘em anywhere she wants.

Wait a minute
---
You didn't happen to download jaegers acog in all of that did you?
---
Rb6 sold out on this one just give everyone 20 alpha packs for wasting their time
---
Honestly thinking back to my beginning mistakes i don't even know how i was dumb enough to make them. No wonder i got tk'd at least once per match for the first week or so
---
Err... Can anyone tell me plz If there's any site that i can see other artworks from the same artist of this wallpaper?

(I really love this art style tho... @-@)

Nope. You wil get banned.

I thought rainbow got RTX until I read the title
---
*Acurate 100*
---
Okay nah i think theres a problem right now others are having the same prob
---
Ubisoft has complete control over the renown economy, so if they did this it would mean players have more renown on average so Ubisoft would make skins cost more renown
---
This ain’t a free market, Ubisoft already made skins as expensive (from a time perspective) as they want
---
Warden looking like a chad, like always. Stay strong warden mains.
---

---
No problem

I couldn’t find Nook for a few minutes

It is stubbornness though!
---
If they do go through with a weapon nerf,  that in no way hinders his gadget (which is his strong suit, and what people scream at us when a jäger nerf is suggested), then this could’ve happened months ago. 
---
He didn’t need another alternative for his weapon (which has always been really strong) to be nerfed. It was obvious and doing this months ago would’ve helped and wouldn’t have made his Utility any worse, so everyone would be happy.
---
And the more people say it, the more times they’ll see it and maybe consider it. Look at the BOSG12.2 ACOG facade, and look what happened.  
---
You say it enough,  people will listen. Mediocre college level psychology there for ya!
---
Quite frustrating, it seemed to work fine on TTS when shifting tides first launched but everyone had 120+ ping for some reason so clearly some issues
---
Ok, yeah now that I rattle out the cobwebs of the corner of my brain that contained chemistry 101, I suppose all the electrons would not hold a significant amount of mass.  Interesting how much power we use to make those electrons do one of two things.
---
Fair point with warden not having the most practical gadget, but idk if goyo’s acog is much of an advantage considering its on the TCSG
---
I bet you already know the new operators to be announced for the next 5 years
---
It would show them regardless moving or not. So this would mean to destroy it relatively quickly. (If it dies mid scan, the scan cancels, it being the EE-TWO-D) I know, I suck at names. And probably thinking of Ops too. But I just want to hear the communities opinion
---
This is actually awesome
---
I think you accidentally downloaded the whole of r/outside
---
ah, yes, *i'm* the immature one for having my name set to "trans_ rights_". the person who called me a trans piece of human garbage is clearly the better man in this scenario.
---
It actually super good if you can control it’s recoil but I can’t so I use a reflex
---
At least yours downloads, mine can't even finish 45 MB...

I want to see now a whole thing where wamai isn’t afraid of lion, but lion hates wamai.

wait apparently theres a option to enable the customized controller when i turn it off it resets when i turn it on it uses the edited one https://youtu.be/mGNK4bncfPU?t=307 see that

maybe theres chance , if i dont have to thru the struggle of editing the controls everytime this might be a solution

Nice, that's a little outdated but noted.  Were approaching 20 zetabyes fairly quickly now.  So maybe two strawberries pretty quick lol.
---
I don't really care at the end of the day because the game comes first but lore wise it seems fairly stupid for a couple reasons along with just seeming like an easy way for Ubi to add new characters with less effort.
---
Fuze isn't considered a shield operator since that's not his main focus/gadget.
---
Or at least trade items with each other.
---
I died to this the other day with monty and its so annoying cos you think you've got him and then you die and your like shit, wtf! They need to fix it.
---
If they kill a teammate does it show up as a tk or does it show up the new op killed them
---
Sooo an operator that pretty much guarantees headshots through soft walls and smoke?
---
Oh that’s too hear! If that’s the case im going to use that feature too. Good find
---
Anyone see the bear charm Pooh
---
it doesnt pass soft walls. you have to be in LOS to see the outline, and even then the outline is only there for .5 seconds.
---
I mean in situations other than ones like this, where its an on going thing. If I'm rushing an objective to plant before time exires (ie: 5 seconds left) the echo shouldn't be able to prevent the plant from another room.
---
Jojos kinda gay tho 😳probably why I love it sm

I've been hearing this 'fun fact' since I was a freshman in Highschool... Like 10 years ago.
---
Surely it's... *doubled* every year since 2016 alone, at least, right?
---
Looks great!
---
Also because in poor African countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Cameroon (and plenty more I haven’t named) people mostly run around from school to home due to there not being much affordable travel. This honestly is what keeps their cardio health to be much higher than people in America.
---
I know this because my mom is from Cameroon and had to travel all across town by walking or running every single day and did a-lot of water fetching and  chores in her childhood.
---
Well part 5 had a million gay couples so it’s not a secret

Nice I play laid and I approve

His shotgun is designed to have large impact radius as it’s a breaching tool. Did you mean getting kill or breaching wall?

He has a 90% pick rate he need a nerf beacuse wamai will just be used along side jager they need to make him less desirable

Thank you 💪 Lemme try it out then.

Just one question, does the arrow break the barricade?
---
Thanks for creating this giveaway! If I win I’ll make sure to show off the prize in my siege streams! :D
---
Her shotgun is shit on console at least in higher ranks it it it will get you killed
---
Not my thing 😂 I think I'll unlock Cap or Hibana
---
Yes sir.
---
Thank you so much
---
First off the fe-12 or what ever it’s called is shit don’t use it but the scorpion is a headshot machine I usually use reflex vert and compensator
---
What platform do u play on and no it doesn't
---
Goyo easily. He has good guns, impacts and C4 for either utility or killing potential, a great gadget for area and plant denial that’s also passive and can be activated by anyone, and he has an acog. 
---
Warden, however, has a pea shooter primary, decent shotgun but not good for range, super hard to control secondary, and average pistol, with a situational as hell gadget, no utility, and is basically just a worse version of Mute and Smoke. You can either bring the shotgun/SMG and rely on the SMG-12 for range or bring the MPX and have no utility but have easy recoil and range, and he needs that range to work with his gadget which requires him to stand still to see through smoke. 
---
This is all a very long, complicated way of saying Warden sucks and you should buy Goyo, and of you want to run Shotty/SMG with C4, just play Mute.

Once I had a thermite(level 50ish) destroy my breaching charge on a castle barricade to put down his exothermic charge. I was mad until the next breaching charge I put down got me the acievement for killing someone with one
---
Wait you guys are getting free blowjobs
---
Depends. Lesion is an intel trap operator who can soft roam and echo is a plant denying anchor who generally sits on or very close to site. Both have solid guns but echo has acog.

I play on PC sir.
---
Use the shotgun. Not only is it busted af but the SMG is impossible to control on console.
---
It’s actually overpowered which is why it’s getting a nerf and thanks for the scorpion recommendation.
---
Yeah I was awake for like 5 minutes &gt;_&lt;
---
ok
---
I use her shotgun in higher ranks console...plat 2-diamond matches. I've seen others dominate with that shotgun in higher ranks also. I think it's got to do more with how the playstyle fits with the shotgun.
---
Nope, Even though I have a girlfriend they’re definitely not ‘free’
---
Thanks this cleared my doubt. I will go for standard.
---
A lot of countries use decimal commas.
---
No it really wouldn’t if you’re a good support yeah you’re not getting kills but you’re also not dying and I never said the main thing was kd I was include it
---
Trust me you want deluxe, in the long run it will save you a TON of in-game currency when buying characters, and the $10 is definitely worth it for how much more you get
---
That’s heck of a pc storage upgrade you got there
---
Pulse has a lot on his mind 😳
---
They're... Both great operators? I'd go for the one that fits your playstyle more. Echo if you're an anchor, lesion if you're flexible and shallow roam
---
Lmao I just played with that guy but he left after he got killed
---
9 nerfs. 9 nerfs. 9 nerfs. 9 nerfs. 9 nerfs. 9 nerfs. 9 nerf. 9 nerfs. 9 nerfs.
---
I just wanted to typed that out for the broken records out there. 
---
Regardless, she is still plenty viable.
---
Is she the best operator to choose on defense? 
---
Absolutely not, but to say she's not viable is being dishonest with this operator. 
---
I have said before and I'll say it again: An Ela buff is not necessary, but if she got one, you wouldn't get any complaining from me.
---
This is a clip from a video on my channel. Id love some feedback! https://youtu.be/Q2H0dMG7oNc
---
nice mate
---
Why? There is nothing we rong with them making operator suggestions. This makes no sense, nonprofessional players also sometimes think about the game
---
Engraved for the SAS is my all time fav. 
---
Next would be the 2019 Six Invitational skin, probably that awesome ww2 shark plane design skin for shotguns, the USA 4th of July skin for FBI, and finally any of the gem skins. 
---
I would say Black Ice as an honorable mention. Despite its overhyped infamy, I own it on several guns on PS4, and on the AR-33 for my main thatcher on pc. It’s super sexy, despite the hype.
---
Black ice for Mira's vector?
---
Year of the Pig skin, hands down

Even further, it takes about 6.02*10^23 atoms of hydrogen just for hydrogen to weigh a gram so...

---
Dude this event actually felt fair too (unlike how I felt like a head a major disadvantage on attack of doctors curse)
---
I only see 1?
---
Yeah but it would force players to actually make sure they're safe to reload instead of reloading after every kill.
---
I also kind of wish players had a limited amount of space and had to choose between magazines, drones, grenades, loose ammo (More bullets for less space but have to be manually packed in) and their gadget.
---
It would allow players to make hard choices like only taking 2 mags of rifle ammo in so they can take 4 thermite charges instead, or someone ditching their pistol mags for an extra drone. Hell, maybe they ditch guns all together and go in with 8 frag grenades.
---
Jackal is into feet. Change my mind.

No need to gatekeep my Wii.

If you dislike a console pleb's post, just downvote it and tell the OP to die. EZ 👏/s
---
If they didnt just disconnect it's not ubisoft's fault if they left by choice it's just shit luck sorry bud
---
I like the second half. I think it should still stick to all weapons but using your pistol to catch the trap and then quickly switching to primary could surprise enemies who push after hearing the activation and shot/s.
---

That what he means.
---
Mine ain't either
---
Money heist should give more renown
---
Lol or he is one of those dads that r really into shoes
---
He literally says "Rifle shield deployed, get behind me."
---
But that was when his shield was literally 800hp and acted as an actual shield.
---
I don’t think that that would mix wel with siege but there are some games out there that do this, I’m pretty sure insurgency is based on a point system.
---
I use reflex, compensator, and vertical grip. I do strangely well with it.
---
It just forces a slower play style. Especially since it would be easy to detect if you were paying attention. Slowing down would counter it
---
Thanks
---
Clachanka must be a real strat tho cant believe I never thought of it
---
If you waver, YOU'RE MINE
---
Your beret is shit
---
what is this, the monkey's paw?
---
Oh. Really? I kinda read it as a friendly fire kill that just woundnt count towards a ricochet penalty.
---
I feel like the characters are too complex for that
---
Unless it’s could be like a 1v1 and u can send in terrorists to attack your friends from certain places ya feel kind of like the new resident evil game coming out
---
Now what type of guns would he have? Long ranged rifles? Medium ranged rifles, sub machine guns? Shotguns?
---
How out we replace the pp-19-01 with a KORD?
---
I bet he wears light up sketchers when he’s not sniffing feet.
---
That’s the most bogus thing I’ve ever heard I did the mission and I got no fucking mask I even remember asking people how to put it on cause I figured there should be one. LOL Rip
---
They give me incentive to try different operators so I guess it's not that bad. Fun to have a goal.
---
Lion's bundle makes him an astronaut.
---
He get a boner from the sound of that Velcro

That wouldn't make since as it would throw off the kill per enemy death ratio even more. Plus he said it in some other comments.

Sadly yes. Comcast used to have me on a unlimited plan but last year switched to a data cap without me realizing. 1000gb sounds like a lot but with two xboxes a few phones and tablets all with multiple streaming services it goes fast. The great thing is they give you two free months of overages then charge you up to $200 for the excess data used in the month after that but hey they cap it at $200 dollars so my bill will only be like $300-$400 a month if I go over.

My suggestion never include equipment(detail loadout) unless it seems to be needed
---
Blackbeard is a -3 speed with a massive hit box and the objectively worse assault rifle in the entire game with huge recoil and even worse fire rate. His shield also breaks in 1-2 shots and he can still be headshotted if the bullet hits the top of his head, which happens pretty commonly. Blackbeard hasn’t been a problem for years and anyone that still complains about him doesn’t understand how big of a trade off he is and how much skill he actually takes to use effectively.
---
That's a lot of operators....
---
that reloading animation is cool
---
Or if they even touched up the map like they have this sweet Halloween game mode and then they throw this out at least make it interesting
---
Did they decrease any prices (Whether renown or credits) in those ~2 years?
---
does it shoot airsoft rounds or metal bbs or not shoot at all? and can it be modified to do so?
---
Thanks😂
---
this is beautiful
---
Downloading the HD textures pack I see.
---
you downloaded a brain worth of siege
---
I'm sure hes just downloaded half our galaxy cluster lol
---
Recuirt shouldn't even exist at this point, don't know why'd you ask for an elite skin for him.
---
do you start the game once every 4 months? 70gb is like the total install size.
---
someone finally said it

Goyo should get his panel of “This is fine” with him surrounded by Volcàn shields, great art btw

---
If this one sells and makes it worth the time I put into it, I’ll most definitely make more and make ones that more expensive like air soft and metal ones. Obviously different gun types and skins too
---
I'm not up to date with the latest and greatest for parts, but I would find a build around 1k, then buy it all on Cyber Monday for 600. Don't buy one from a store, build it yourself. It only takes maybe an hour to do and it's way cheaper and more customizable.
---
If you mean muzzle brake, the same attachment can look different on various weapons. It only depends on which weapon you put it on, you can't manually change the look of it.
---
Better off asking in pcmasterrace because there is a mix of console and pc players here.

That’s beautiful

i’m sure it has crossed the dev’s minds multiple times and it is something that can be improved greatly, but a complete graphical overhaul would cause a shit ton of problems for a game as complex a siege

True story. the smoke elite skin has the name of the  chemical used in the toxic babes written on it.
---
I think the word you are looking for is retarded. However this was also very epic, take my upvote
---
Because it released in 2015 plus it still looks better than anything on a last gen console.
---
ok, cause i have airsoft gun internals i could use to modify it thats why i asked
---
Yeah but other games get updates for theire graphics and stuff so why don’t they do it as well
---
Realistic mode on custom games is sort of like this. You get like 3-5 mags and when you reload, you just swap mags. So if you reload on 5 you get a new mag but now your mag #1 has 5 left.
---
There's other cool stuff like no death messages, no friendly outlines or names, and the scoreboard is unavailable during the match. Siege should have made that the event instead lol
---
I'm Italian and we get the switching sides thing... Some people really lack imagination.
---
Being a competitive shooter, the devs have made sacrifices to have the game run at 60fps.

It is your prerogative. One speed isn’t perfect for every person. You can state cookie cutter facts all you want but I ran speed tests and tried multiple configurations. I placed my modem at different places in my house and my main Xbox has always been connected straight to my modem but keep telling me these facts that you experienced through me. I’m not going to buy adapters and run an Ethernet cords to every device that connects to my internet. That would be insane. Why would I connect a tablet to my modem? It’s made to be a portable device.
---
32GB update? i got scared and checked but i have no update available on PC
---
I just checked out spectrum and unfortunately it’s not available where I’m at but they redirected me to the xfinity website so there’s that.
---
Quick question. How do you get the tags on your name like how yours is that you main thermite
---
AIGHT MR BEAR WHERE IS THE HONEY DONT YOU LOOK AT ME WITH THEM GOO GOO EYES?
---
NO? OK THEN 
---
mission failed: hostage was eliminated
---
Lol get shreked buddy. But for real though damn that sucks man.
---
NEW MANDALORIAN EVENT

NO MAP RESTYLE
---
NO OPERATOR SKINS
---
NO SPECIAL GAME MODE
---
NO COOL VOICE OVER 
---
NO FREE COSMETICS
---
BABY YODA CHARM FOR ONLY 3000 CREDITS GET IS NOW
---
lol that actually happened to me on operation: White Noise. Just 2 more matches to win and bang down to gold IV 😭
---
Payday gang vs Rainbow 6 would be an awesome event for both games.
---
Not to mention attackers who camps smh..
---
Ever considered pissing off? Y'know you can delete a Reddit account for a  reason...
---
On Attack; Dokkaebi &amp; Blitz
---
On Defence; Jäger and Kaid
---
TBH he tends to have some shit opinions.
---
Should i buy and play it can i learn the game in this time
---
You only have 2 shots
---
His love for his team, friends and family
---
Is casual, you'll be alright. Atleast it was plane. Lel
---
Sad part is, is that the first one that gets killed ia actually nomad, and her gadget's job to watch flanks
---
Give us bacc pls
---
You aren't missing out.
---
I call hax. He headshotted Ash. NO ONE HEADSHOTS ASH.
---
Mozzie and frost as deffenders and maverick as attacker
---
i do, Carnage.
---
I fill
---
Gotta tell my grandkids that this guy was still copper
---
What is the point of this post
---
Beautifully done my ultrawide brother xD
---
When doc elite is cosplaying thermite elite
---
I'm kinda scared about this already.
---
"How's it hanging?"
---
My own laptop runs Siege at 30fps on 800x600 resolution.
---
That's life.
---
What a clickbait, it's only the limb penetration system :\
---
The download must've been
---
SO ZETTA SLOW
---
Might be a while before Echo gets an elite. After Capitao in the new season the most probable order of release is Ela, Caveria then Buck.
---
beeb
---
haha, true!
---
Wow this looks so good.
---
You don't need to reload and still have a full mag after pulling out a Lesion Gu

Hello Sean_T1997, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dzz65a/i_tried_to_log_into_my_ubisoft_account_and_i/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
How is season 76?
---
ehmmmmm imma just go
---
It's siege
---
That’s why I said likely! Lol
---
i love it! do what you gotta do to win my guy.
---
So in his current state, he's nothing more than a liability.
---
So my point stand.
---
&gt;Castle
---
For real? Recruit replacing the one guy who delays and/or wastes utility and blocks off lines of sight and is often considered Mira's best friend?
---
&gt;Clash
---
Moving Mira window that delays attackers, basically making time a worse enemy than it already is?
---
&gt;Cav
---
As much as I'd love to say that Cav is basically an overglorified recruit, she's still got something recruit doesn't have, however useless that may be as you climb up the ranks.
---
&gt;Warden
---
Warden isn't useless. He's niche.
---
Plane?
---
Hell yes you should, the deluxe edition will give you a good head start with characters as well, I’d say it’s a great time to get involved
---
Please don't, it's not even funny, just humourous enough for a one time thing (barely)
---
This ol'man looks he didn't enjoyed the Beaujolais Nouveau
---
Yeah I see, steam didn’t even have the time to react goddamn
---
how about just blocking the trigger and it takes like 5 seconds to remove as the op takes out his knige and levers it off
---
And in the process making a large hole making him a better buck?
---
Wtf
---
\#bring back Mr.Bear
---
If Kaid's smg didn't have 1 extra bullet than most, you wouldn't have pulled this off... 
---
And here I was, thinking it was useless
---
Love that little game of tag with blitz
---
Still all the same glitches but at lest there’s p12 Acog
---
she still ain’t got acces to that m9 she’s holding &gt;:((

10km of internal wiring have yet to be delivered

Wait when?

Thanx :)
---
Hello sgtsolitary! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
I get almost nothing on eu servers.
---
You mean nickname?
---
Yes
---
I’m so confused... Is it still in the game or no? I swear it’s not. I’m probably just dumb hahaha
---
When they think they have I from every side 👌
---
Starting to think this isn't a principle of siege.
---
Can I get that sound as a message tone?
---
F
---
Nice kill man
---
I consider myself a decent artist but I don’t get how people can do this
---
Like Payday?
---
is there a way I can see a list of these type of changes of maps? Thank you
---
Nice Dokkabae

Asking for the link

are Things like this normal on Console? :D

I sadly never see such stupidity on Pc

To hopefully find other people who hate him as well

Well I have a YouTube channel (about 300 subscribers) and if you’d like to edit some videos for me I can shout you out.
---
thinks its got anything to do with the stock drop that happened to ubi? or it could just be netflix
---
i have elites and only buy elites on siege but i dont like when shit gets overpriced especially on skins that are meh and not worth the price at all, i personally dont like the show either but i feel bad for the people that do
---
Black, white and gold.

I am simple, but i dont care

is the rank showing on the scoreboard only a console thing now? you can't do that on pc.

I thought it was something like that, here ya go

i forget the name but its a legendary cardboard skin for the t-33
---
Some say this event is almost more rare than lightning striking the same place twice
---
Epic isn't the right word. Mediocre at best
---
Attack - Sledge and yes im one of those.... Ash
---
Defense - Jäger and rook/doc
---
His elite skin says it has arsenic in its particles
---
i mean i got a legendary for the first time in months a few days ago, and its literally jager uniform just recolour to brown and called "leather"
---
the "legendaries" in the APs are actually so horrible, i only know of 1-2 legendaries i want and both are headgears
---
He wants the source of the video.
---
Democracy.
---
That's not next to the window. How tf did you get there?
---
Limbs have always only taken 75% of the weapons damage when hit even at 3 armor ops, now it only changed for 3 armor(you mistook armor for speed) which got reduced by 10% so it partially buffed all 3 armor ops
---
This is the most upvotes I have ever gotten. I went from 200 karma to nearly 1000. Thanks guys!
---
That is bullshit and most people should know it. Slow loading isnt fixed by moving the game to a SSD. Slow loading can caused by many different things like slow internet or other slow components of your PC. I have my OS on SSD but not the game still most of the time i load very fast.
---
*Kills you in Star Wars*
---
Things like this are normal with low skill players, regardless of platform.
---
Well i Think we tot ddost and bugged in to there when I was jumping in the building through the big window
---
Yeh he’s right
---
I'm not sure dude. I kinda doubt it was ddos.
---
Vigil mask with lips is the last thing I need to see
---
Well it’s kinda dumb if you can’t understand that you play defence and attack

Mini smokes that are smaller and last 4-5 seconds
---
It was really laggy maybe it was just the servers
---
Nice
---
We where warping
---
Why would they just stand in the lobby like that? Move!
---
Yeah, but I think they made this alongside the Halloween event so they didn’t have enough recourses to touch it up, so they put an intern to teach him how to do modeling and stuff
---
Holy crap I didnt even look at his, jeez
---
The game is Alive and well on all platforms
---
but when you reinforce you are defending and want cams
---
Did everyone forget that when her Scorpion got nerfed everyone was complaining about her recoil and mag size. Now everyone wants it buffed back?
---
Nah, leave my girl Ela alone.
---
She’s good where she at.
---
a lot of people use it and its rather frustrating really. atm it is OP but its being nerfed in y4s4.
---
Dont care didnt ask
---
&gt;But the way I see that playing out is that you will have more good opportunities to use it on site
---
One thing I forgot to mention is that there would be a delay before you can use it again (like Amaru grapple) so you can't just spam it.
---
So for example on garage, if the attackers blow 2 walls, you can't just instantly close the breach.
---
&gt;And in your example roaming or not he still loses 2 uses of his gadget
---
The idea is that you would rush where the attackers are trying to enter, and immediately trying to block them.
---
I thought you were talking about the comment, which was stupid, not his profile
---
Ngl thats pretty sexy no homo
---
Ehm, what the fuck? Why isn't this a bigger deal? HUH?!
---
The difference between SATA and NVME is the opposite of null. SATA m.2 devices get around 500-530 MB/s reads/write speeds whilst an NVME gets 3500 MB/s. So no, the difference is the opposite of null. I thought though, it would be implied that I'm referring to an NVME m.2 because why would you go with a SATA one when an NVME one is not much more expensive?
---
[Source](velocitymicro.com/blog/nvme-vs-m-2-vs-sata-whats-the-difference/)
---
Thanks lol
---
Yes , its very annoying at first but it is really satisfactory when you finally get an ace or clutch a match
---
I don’t even have an HDD yet my game takes ten eons to load

I love your flair

I just wish people could see past all the bad stuff *that the whole fandom condemns*. Yes, it’s weird. No, you don’t have to hate
---
Ela is for sure being over nerfed, even more than Blackbeard, well the shotgun of Ela is broken af, that's a fact, but the SMG is shit, she need a buff NOW, 'cuz she is really bad nowdays, I agree, she may need a rework, but for now I think that a SMG buff is better than a rework, just fix the recoil a little bit and will be an awesome gun, at least that's my opnion
---
Not gonna lie, that's a really good cosplay. And I'm not suprised by the large trophy.
---
What if instead of slowly leaking out it sat there until an impact occured, then it just exploded downward creating a new reinforced wall. So what was a soft wall and accessible by Zofia/Ash suddenly becomes a hard wall to be breached. Or put it on a reinforced wall, thermite uses a charge to blow it open, but suddenly it has become reinforced again, necessitating another charge.
---
True, almost more suprised about that.
---
I mean, I've made rewards using acrylic and hand tools. Not as easy as using a laser cutter, but it's definitely doable.
---
I just don’t see many people talking about it as much as the other events. The Halloween and April Fools events seem to be everyone’s favorite. I’m glad a lot of people are agreeing with me I didn’t think this many people liked showdown as much as me
---
Again... Light disturbs colours on the flag first! My skin too!
---
I dont really think, just force of habit.
---
Well when your on obj you can hear all the vital things especially if you make sound propagation holes, and if your roaming then you either use default cams to scout out your location or have a valk set up cams in the spot your roaming, a roamer really shouldn't be running wild around the map anyways so shouldn't need intel across the entire map
---
that ui lmao
---
Only two Evil Eye kills ever reported

Me three
---
Well, I borrowed my account to a very good friend because I was very inactive. He bought some credits on an external website and my account got permabanned for that.
---
Tbh I thought it was dok poking their head out a drywall
---
Hahahaah that's great. Your so bitter over it that you have to result in name calling. God I love it. Siege may not be as intensive on loading as to make an extreme noticable difference but for other games, larger games, such as Battlefield or that, yes there is quite the difference. Yes a game takes advantage of the 3500MB/s as that is the red speed of the drive so that's what it reads at. Unless there is thermal throttling an NVME drive rated at 3500MB/s will run at that speed. Dont act like you know how something works when you dont. A drive isnt going to magically decide to slow down because the application is a game.
---
Attachements are pretty much subjective but there’s definitely a meta for the weapons.
---
That's my favourite skin!! This is awesome! Id give a plat if i wasnt broke :/
---
Fuze
---
Oof cant help you there
---
Fine by me. You should use reddit less.
---
Oh hiya, dasistfuchs
---
They did but then they made him two speed so it made his gadget go down faster so they just nerfed his gadget while buffing his speed
---
TIL lightning strikes the same place once, 5 times or 7 times only.
---
Lmao imagine doing this shit with randoms
---
And also if you use it for one flashbang then turn it off it emptys then refills, which isnt how it should work
---
Thats not the point. I just want a second account because I still wanna play ranked against plat/diamond people without losing my rank. I just would play against silver players at the beginning so I think that would not annoy anyone. In addition, im just 1 of 5 players. Im not a god or something and it is not my aim to annoy any people
---
Allo mein friend
---
I have trouble picking between compensator and muzzle break, flash hider. Idk what’s best for what
---
Oh no, I called you a knob and swore! Police! Arrest me for committing such vile crimes!
---
Kid, if you think I’M toxic, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Do you ask your mommy to wipe your ass with how delicate that skin of yours is? Or are you just an immature brat who can’t bare the thought of someone swearing in your general vicinity? I only called you a knob, the other swears were, get this, just swears not directed at you.
---
I can say the same to you
---
Doesn’t need to happen to thatcher but a new op that does it. However we already now have another alternative to thatcher so wouldn’t be super useful
---
I dont care that it doesnt have a recoil diamond. It is still a headshot machine and deadly even if you dont get the headshot. It's not a hard gun to use.
---
Frost mats arent viable because anyone with half a brain will spot them. Kapkan is better than frost but similar problem. Leison is ovb better which is why he's getting nerfed but he's still less versatile than ela. I think a reasonable ela buff would be to give her another grismont or make it build like leison but shes still pretty fine where she is
---
You understood me. It is not my aim to annoy any people. I just wanna play ranked against plat without losing my rank. Of course I have to play against silver players at the beginning but I think this will be ok. Moreover, im just 1 of 5 players.
---
Ikr like no way he did it to em like that 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Good shit dude!!
---
He should have faster animations fore more flexibitly. Picking up and putting down his LMG faster would be nice.
---
There was no effect, how was that fair.
---
Depends on the gun.
---
Muzzle is for unique shot weapons like dmrs and pistols.
---
Compensator is for weapons with high horizontal recoil: like ela smg or the vector ( best use in high rmp weapons)
---
Flash hider: is more for vertical recoil.
---
I think rogue 9 did some videos comparing all the attachments
---
"wHy Is ThIs TakInG 6 mInUtEs bUy A SsD"
---
Stop ffs. I Have the game installed on a decent hdd from  2013 (WD Black 1to 7200rpm) and it takes a few seconds to load. It could be even faster if i remove the HD textures. 
---
Whoever is taking 40 seconds to load must be using some old shit hardware from 2007.
---
Varsitygaming and rogue 9 did videos on attachments a while back i would check them out
---
Thanks I’ll check em out on yt
---
that bug is still around? lol
---
Yes bro the commando is fire and the reload animation to me is so clean
---
6k
---
Will do thanks
---
Na dude it’s obviously Amaru
---
Wamai is God
---
thought it was a but so i clicked the vid. i am now dissapointed
---
Idk I can play both I just wanted to know which is better in general yk?
---
What Laptop is that?
---
it is what it is, knowing the outcome you shouldnuse different tactics in the future. knowing they cannot be penetrable you surely know you have to do something different in that very instance. if so then only your approach has to change, not the game.
---
Was that... Groot?
---
You're welcome
---
i ask you why not?
---
I’ll try draw her soon then!
---
You are idiotic cause apparently I’m not a warden main if my flair doesn’t say it
---
I totally forget about his ability when i confront blitz
---
And have you ever heard of a joke
---
nice.
---
Oh no sh get away
---
And then everyone clapped.
---
wow this is really good
---
Jager has been acting up again since more people have been getting ACOGs.
---

---
But he is just frustrating not good. I think he would wind up in the jackal box. Always ban despite sub 50% winrate.
---
Not only that but its better for game balancing
---
Are able to tell the difference In between 0.1 seconds and 0.01 seconds? It’s not really noticeable.
---
Woah, what? I'm the one that hasn't heard of a joke? I was making a joke about you not having the warden flair, and you instantly started getting defensive. Take a look in the mirror once in a while, eh?
---
i count things like this as a yes. This weapon has a really high firerate so only getting one shot can be challenging and you may have tapped but for a split second too long
---
Could this be my god?
---
i think it is... when my mates and I are in a 5stack, we usually have 3 with the game installed on HDDs and 2 with the game installed on SSDs. the loading times vary and it is seems to be NOT dependent on the drives. sometimes the ssd guys take longer, sometime its the other way around. but usually everyone loads within 1-2 seconds of each other.
---
lucky guy
---
Hmmmmmm, idk, maybe MSI???????
---
If this is abusive then I could go for a little abuse.
---
cuz its parking.png for refelection
---
It looked 2d despite being a 3d model
---
Very well done! Looks very much like Ela.
---
our fellow comrade has spoken
---
Gridlock fart
---
it's not every currency, it's just one of them fairly regularly
---
Which model...
---
Duplicate black is the worst since it always makes me think about what if I got another blackice instesd of this..
---
Yes, but technical terms shouldn't.
---
Nope, what did he said ?
---
If he talked about the ability to reinforce or barricade from a distance, that's a thing I've seen suggested a lot. But I feel the original thing in my concept is the whole decay thing pushing you to use your gadget throughout the round.
---
Love It when blitz'a flash actually works...
---
Seriously, can't believe his woman made him play Favela.
---
How does using mnk have anything to do with smurfs or cheaters?
---
tbh i almost never used to spawnpeek or aim outside. Im trying to learn and it does help a lot in ranked xD
---
That sounds more like a bug than anything.
---
Some mobos are weird and have them on the back as well. Then some might be SATA M.2 drives instead of NVME. My motherboard has both, and was very confusing of my my harddrive was not registering in my bios.
---
Probably yes. It's the same with Steam and Uplay
---
I fucking swear, if this happens, I'm coming for you both.
---
Nah but cute tho
---
Her shotgun is the opposite of balanced on console. Anytime you try to battle an ela with it in any range below 10m, you will get clapped. This nerf is very needed, I’ve got no clue how you say you played on console
---
Mira - she’s harder to use but she personally is way more fun. 
---
She changes the entire dynamic of a site and hinders the attackers plays. Even if a Mira is blown out, it’s still viable for shooting through and nitros. 
---
She does require a lot more team play though.
---
With the ingame button
---
First ever recorded use of Warden's gadget
---
Elite yah
---
Agree about disabling reload canceling, but the rest are really bad ideas for Siege.
---
Ikr that made me laugh
---
Bingo. I have a 256Gb SSD for my OS and apps like Adobe Photoshop, a 2TB HDD for most games and a 2TB SSD for large, open world games or games with lots of objects in them.
---
This new event is the laziest shit I've ever seen. Here you go, play the worst game mode (hostage) on Bank (Personally I hate bank) and we're gonna add two skins and accept a fat paycheck from a Netflix series that (granted I only watched one episode) is lame as shit.
---
some guys pay extra for that
---
I had to google what this NVMe business was and holy crap 7x as fast as SATA SSD. Kinda kicking myself for having JUST dropped $150 on a sata ssd. At least I opted for the higher end samsung evo model, so hopefully I get some good longevity out of it.
---
Scratch that. Love it when warden works.
---
Even if you get 1 pick it still can drastically change the round. Maybe you get an important attacker like the Thermite or something, sometimes it's just 1 less guy on the map to shoot at Defenders. Spawnpeeking isn't terrible by any means. I do get triggered going against stacks who constantly  and aggressively run out every 2.2 seconds though lol
---
It would've been better if the scanner was on a CD or something.
---
Cause rank doesn't have anything to do with your general game knowledge and gun skill. It's just a representation of how many games you've won or lost, personally I'd rather be in silver (especially on console) than be plat or diamond or champion.
---
Don’t need that much imagination if you use the boss G on both em. Which you should.
---
Well obviously you just flicked when it wasn't necessary to flick.
---
I believe M.2s that are not NVMEs use the same lanes as a SATA connection anyway. They might get a little more bandwith to the CPU than a standard SSD, but transfer speed is about the same. My system uses one of those, because the form factor of my case limited my storage options and I wanted more GBs for my dollar than what would funtionally be a slighty faster boot time.
---
Neither.
---
Chalet. Fix it or forget it, forever.
---
The same reason why Blackbeard was a shitty concept for this game.
---
They're protected from one shots yet they can one shot you. For full body shields that's down to RNG but RNG is super frustrating to lose to.
---
You know that standing still is only for smoke, right?
---
this is a nice comeback. i’m here for it
---
Nah it's because they made Warden to deal with Blitz Rush, Ying/Glaz meta, but they ended up fixing that before his release so he was preemtpively overnerfed.
---
I was about to comment this. Surprised this isn't higher
---
"free hong kong"?
---
Yea, Who do you think that G2 will pick for support?
---
I’m exaggerating, should be obvious. What I’m saying is when you are in any close quarters but long hallway part of any map (ex: Oregon basement) she can peek you from range and murder you. A clip fed semiauto shotgun shouldn’t hit that hard from that far
---
There was a time when they could ADS without lowering their shield.  Whoever decided that deserved to be fired.
---
XD I think it is being taken to far XD
---
You've been a dirty boy, Thermite.
---
Cause they can’t aim
---
needs more acog
---
hoes mad
---
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in this game, and I was there when Thatcher had a shotgun in his operator image but couldn't actually use one in game.
---
I love it.
---
as a glaz main, i like this. Thank you.
---
Thank you bro
---
Cqc is where shotguns shine buddy. That is your fault for going into their territory. That's only and always will be your fault. Cqc is where shotguns are supposed to be effective. Guns don't feed in through clips. They do through mags. Clips load into magazines but magazines are what goes in a gun. And about a mag fed shotgun the sagia does more damage and has better fall off st ranges than the fo12. So nice try
---
Nyet
---
100% just a little bit slower
---
❤️
---
Jeez it must be your favorite weapon then if you know so much
---
Not every Op needs to be viable, those ops may come back into the meta again.
---
Cool, didn't know Paper Siege is already released.
---
Look up the operators for y4 and see if they're something you'd like to play with.
---
buy a pc
---
Jesus it’s insufferable to read your replies. I’m talking about narrow hallways not getting peaked out of a close door. Like at 20m your health shouldn’t be shredded all the way to 0 from a shotgun
---
&gt; That thread was actually from about half a year after the game release. 
---
Which should give you an idea about how off-beat you are with your statement. Blitz only turned into a monster once Ubi added his ability to sprint with the shield up in late 2017.
---
&gt; T-hunt wasn't a mode when the game came out.
---
It [wasn't](https://youtu.be/Ae3yc-X_WTA)? Then what patch introduced t-hunt? 
---
&gt; The shield characters were all OP on release.
---
Yes, just like there was no t-hunt on release, you are apparently working with your own alternate history. 
---
&gt; Nobody knew how to deal with them early on
---
It's not like dealing with them was as easy as throwing a C4 just at them, no fancy angles or traps required because: **The shield did not give explosive protection**.
---
&gt; There was an early patch that nerfed them to oblivion.
---
By making shields protect from explosions and giving Monty extra shielding on the sides while extended? Care to name that patch that supposedly nerfed all shields to oblivion, and how it did so?
---
I don't have that kinda money :/ or age for that matter
---
No, he's just HaNgInG oUt!
---
Listen here you.
---
Looks similar to a swastika
---
How did I never considered that Warden counters Blitz.... what is wrong with my brain?
---
Legit just did this on Oregon
---
Isn’t it fun
---
It’s so fun. I only got one though
---
Delete this, don’t give them ideas
---
Nøkk for the fmg, plus her shotgun hits and breaches like Buck's Skeleton key, and it shoots far like an AR
---
He camera cloak and silent step ability is great once you understand it.
---
Or at least don’t give them time to reload
---
already leaked
---
Will be as soon as I get home!
---
He was definitely in flash range
---
It just does whatever the snapper wishes for.
---
I was thinking about something similar to this. I wish we could attach the laser sight to any gun we want (In rainbow six siege) and have the option to turn it off (like battlefield)
---
The only ban I've ever had... The lord's turret meets Mr bear. F in the chat.
---
Alot of terrorist hunt this is coming from someone who went from ending para bellum and grim sky copper 4 (no joke) to going into plat 
---
1. A team that is not only good with game sense, map knowledge, aim but also need to be nice if you play with dickheads that are good is it worth it 
---
2.alot of terrorist hunt at least 30mins to an hour of terrorist hunt before you start a ranked
---
3.learn how properly lean around corners 
---
4.focud on actually aiming and not spamming l3 r3 
---
5.dont just aimlessly spray
---
6.last but not least have fun and keep enjoying yourself sorry for the essay btw
---
and you're welcome
---
I know they said they would have one, but is the actual skin leaked yet? If so, may I please have the link
---
At the very least he's been buffed to the point where he's now "not bad" rather than "complete ass" by making him a 2 armor.
---
Now if his gadget worked more like cavs or vigil's he'd probably be a lot better.
---
Meanwhile Nokk still needs an SMG that doesn't suck ass...
---
There were mtx before. Even then it's not like every game has mtx, a lot more don't have it than have it.
---
Nope that's not it
---
Not new, ever since jager lost the acog

One, it’s easier to identify a player who uses a script than someone that uses in game mechanics to abuse the game.

Two, I believe there is a patch coming out with Shifting Tides to stop any shield being destroyed with a reinforced wall.

I'm not saying every game has it, but it is definitely very prevalent in modern games.

It was very rare for a game that cost money to have them, say, 10 years ago

I know, just being cheeky. The other guy already proved me wrong and I admitted I was wrong, so this convo is largely unnecessary.

To answer your question, you said "circle jerk of hate". You could have chosen anything else but u went with that, which tells me that u obviously are defending him.

You are also trying to feel good about yourself by saying those words, again, you could have gone with any other words but u chose them. You obviously just wanted to feel good about yourself for being a big boy and using "circle jerk of hate"

I fail to understand why everyone thinks the slow load is due to lack of ssd. I have moved my game to a large hdd and not noticed any additional loading times outside initial launch time. Like it was fun y at first but now it just seems dumb.
---
this happened to me exactly once. for months now playing him only used his gadget to my benefit once
---
Why is his name the African spider god out of curiousity? What relationship does that have to his gadget?

Or is it literally just because he has the night vision goggles.

That's true now the way you put it. Although I wouldn't call it an issue since any "serious" game that has an audience doesn't have gameplay interfering MTX nor required. If you launched the same game today and back then, then the only difference would be that the before one doesn't have content updates nor the MTX skins. In the end it doesn't matter since you don't really need to buy anything.
---
People make a choice when they buy a game in a state it is. There's nothing to complain about what they ADD into the game that doesn't affect it negatively since you already got what you purchased.

It's a gamer meme that is obnoxious to read every game related thread.

it makes me suspect we might see more customization with elites, by that I mean, you being able to swap the head

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.

What is the joke I don’t get it

Siege has great comms tbh. easily 10x more people have mics than in cs
---
Lion is basically hated by the whole rainbow team. And by the whole rainbow team i mean 3 people
---
thanks men.
---
He can also have a antigravity granade, he toss the granade into the Room and make something similar to nomad gadget(he IS a attacker)
---
That's the reason vote-to-kick exists.
---
It actually didnt work you were moving haha
---
thanks, friend!
---
Agreed
---
Exactly, and how else can you test new spots and strategies unless you're using them against real players
---
Depends on your playstyle. The one’s is recommend are Hibana, Maverick, Gridlock, Nomad, Buck, or Zofia on attack, and frost, Valk, Echo, Mira, Lesion, Vigil, Maestro, Alibi, Kaid, Mozzie, or Goyo on defense. 
---
Like I said it’s all dependent on your playstyle. Do you like to roam? Do you like hard breachers? Do you like anchors? Etc etc. If you don’t care about playstyles, I’d start with Lesion on defense and Buck in attack. Both are really good ops and good in pretty much every situation.
---
This was on PS4 btw
---
That is where they set up for the Rainbow 6 team member photoshoot.
---
Guess who's first in lobby
---
Or even something like mute gadget
---
probably since Nokk's gadget is a bit less influential than warden's
---
Siege has a very steep learning curve which means it takes months or years to get good at it. The only other advice I can give you is to expect that every enemy is above level 300 and around every corner to kill you (which most of the time isn’t that far from reality). You will die far more than you get kills, but when you do get kills... it will feel far more satisfying.
---
My only thing against this is the fo-12. We already have ela running around with that monster of a gun
---
Jager is homen!!!!!
---
Yeah and its really Deep green but yo know... Yellow Light...
---
Or even a EMP gadget similiar to mute
---
Villa is good map imo I like it yeah there are some flaws but yeah know A lot better than Fortress and Outback
---
I gotta say, you are pretty damn good making these pixel arts
---
I own the game on both PC and PS4. PC and Console are entirely different when it comes to comms. On PC I always talk and help my team out with call outs (and I mean good call outs, not “oh, he’s to that door to the left, no more left) and they’re typically pretty good about it. Most games 3-4/5 have mics and talk back. On Console you’re extremely lucky if even one person doesn’t mute you at the start of the game. I think it’s simply due to not having push-to-talk that has made the comms on console so toxic. People just don’t want to deal with that one kid who’s mom is vacuuming while he’s eating chips in a wind tunnel while others are just trying to game.
---
Or between her cheeks

I get that

Nah fam Yacht its been removed forever now
---
How did this deserve 1.1k upvotes... thanks guys lol
---
When you realize the person is a Sofia main but is playing Warden
---
The point of reworks is so that They are no longer casual Maps-_-
---
bruh what about the people who can literally not talk
---
Then dont land in copper
---
In my experience, people start the game saying “Hi/Hello” or “Anyone have a mic” me and my group reply, and they never talk once again
---
Its honestly just a bland map that everyone got used to and theres no longer Viability or things just become so Standard that like it can be really easy to defend oe easy to attack

You know I actually love playing fuze on hostage. Only time I play him actually. With enough map knowledge you can place his charges and get free kills without hitting the hostage at all. Now depending on map and which site hostage is on something your charges are useless, but I'll take that bet anytime.
---
Yeah no problem, hopefully I was able to explain it to you well enough :)
---
Every single time I try this kind of cheeky shit with Maestro they don’t push the way I set it up.  Without fail
---
I have no reason to be mad in a sledge main
---
If you main Buck and Sledge, I personally would consider giving Zofia a try. Very similar style of play with the soft destruction but overall, great utility and fantastic AR.
---
Thanks :)
---
Lmao no. Warden is meant to counter attacker’s utility, not provide his own. This would make warden way too powerful imo.
---
Why do you have "smurf" in your name?
---
No?
---
How do you not have most operators if you've been playing for years
---
You're not wrong. The read speed CAPABILITY is there and NVME SSDs blow SATA SSDs out of the water. The game files WILL load faster but the other guy sounds like he was talking about starting the match, which has nothing to do with the drive and just how matches start in siege.
---
Very nice colour
---
The real joke is suppressors reducing damage.
---
If there's one thing to get me to stop using my mic is the dicks that will die early and then give me crap for making a mistake.
---
That or you get the one guy with a mic, who dies .02 seconds into the attack phase and spends the next 3 minutes telling you how trash you are.
---
So true.
---
 dayummmmmm
---
find work, go to college,  start streaming,  just live  normal life
---
do it before someone steals your karma
---
wait what game did this monstrosity?
---
Its cuz ur playing a newcomer match
---
What op next?
---
No, you have to leave the queue after about 40-60 seconds if you haven't found a match yet. It's a bug that gets you stuck in the queue forever. 
---
Also, dont play newcomer. Just do casual or unranked.
---
Yes I meant that, I posted this whenever I woke up
---
Interesting probably can do with some work, thank you!!
---
Sowwy, idk why I assumed you were clout chasing, there's just so many people on reddit posting just for karma and awards. Really, really good art tho, props. Ur kinda inspiring me to do pixel art too! but im not gonna do the same thing, I might do some more high resolution stuff.
---
There's been no new people to this game for years. That mode was always a smurf-fest.
---
Plz be patient I hav the shys
---
Yeah I get that. I have just been more inspired than usual lately and making a lot of them, so I can see why you would have thought that. Pixel Art is a lot of fun :)
---
Get lesion and if your good at killing people take vigil
---
So you smell feet or nah?
---
This looks to normal
---
They talk. Its just that they dont say anything until its 4-4 match point and they decide to leave defuser in spawn and ash rush, then they yell at you for not clutching a 1v3
---
The large public community is known as a toxic community in Rainbow 6. Sad but true.
---
This also Applies to the people who join rank matches but then leave on the 1st or 2nd round like why?
---
Ranked used to let you play the same objective all the time, in the good ol' days.
---
I mean im on console too and all maps when there new feel like a maze except fortress that shit is a maze regardless, But A map is fun when its competetive
---
I have come close to leaving this game behind. If that happened, I would be gone so quickly.
---
Is lesion a attacker or defender?
---
This is one of the better ones. Good job!
---
Well it would be broken. Think bout headshots
---
Oh, I still get a solid 80+ FPS maxxed out with my RX 580
---
Let me just spend £200 on an ssd to load faster
---
Im proud of you
---
I'd be game for 5-10 damage depending on distance from target.
---
Ew, console.
---
Subsonic ammo does have less energy though
---
I get what you saying but i think the elo should be slightly impacted by how many kills you get and i might be one sided on this cus im the fragger of my squad
---
This entertained me more than 90% of the new posts on this sub. Let him have it man
---
Can I buy this off you?
---
I play on Xbox. I'm terrified of talking to people in game, so much so that I don't think I've spoken on there for at least a year. Every single time I turn on my mic, people on the other end berate the rest of the team or just me. Otherwise I'd be 100x more open to talking.
---
Also takes less than half a second for you or a teammate to get shot in the head, and considering there are tracers already flying through the wall in the picture, someone is in the process of dying already
---
Damn, this hit home real hard.
---
Isn't the loading mainly due to their servers being shit? Or is it something else(the joke) that I dont get?
---
I’m on console, people’s aim isn’t that good
---
This isn’t a good idea
---
It’s because I was speaking in game, I was explaining to the sledge what happened. And there was a guy on that floor close by running around when I stood up and aim I don’t know if you can hear the steps but my bad for not having the mental capacity to play to your liking
---
UwU more fanservice for us girl players please 😍
---
That‘s how it used to be in the early days of Siege, my friend. And while it was quite frustrating when you went to reload just to get rushed and killed I kinda miss the risk you had to take. It was like an extra resource you had to watch, but maybe that‘s just the nostalgia talking out of me.

---
I do not fear the impossible
---
Thats the problem, not everyone can frag out, it’s best if it’s evenly distributed across the whole squad whether or not they win to lose because this game isn’t all about getting kills. There are several ways you can win without killing everyone, hell, it’s even possible to win without killing a single person. The fact is teamwork is what makes or breaks you from winning a ranked match. Sure you could be going against one of the best fraggers in the game, but that doesn’t make it impossible to win against if you put all of your effort into attacking/defending the objective.
---

I would try to refund it and get the deluxe edition. You can grind them, but personally I wouldn't recommend it. If you have the standard edition you can buy all the year 1 ops for $20.

Okay... for the one hundredth time... we get it... you don't have to yell!
---
Consoles do have less recoil its just counteracted by the use of a worse input method for fps'. 
---
They do take the rest of the playerbase into account though. The fucking shotgun nerf was because of people whining on console. All of cavs changes have been because of the regular playerbase. Bosgacog is because of bikinis dumbarse fans, most of whom would be in gold and below. They collect data on all skill levels and platforms they just only show us plat/diamond on pc. 
---
Yes but the majority of the playerbase doesnt coordinate with their team at a level where castle can be good. So if you balanced him for that average he'd be way too strong for those who have good communication. I also disagree with your buff idea as then you cant shoot peoples feet, meaning theyre free to take it down and so are less likely to be funneled somewhere else.
---
Ela's guns are fine, maybe reduce the scorpions horizontal recoil a bit but thats all it needs. Just get the enemy to come to you where your grizmots are set up and fight in close range. Barbed is good for alerting you to the presence of enemies and shield forces them to destroy it, wasting utility, or jump it into where you are, giving you the advantage.
---
I think we'd all give first an "explosive hug"
---
I ship it
---
Oh yea didn’t even notice that... that may have worked
---
Except we're just slapping on a suppressor. I guess an argument that we also switch ammo could be made but it's hard to tell considering theres no sonic crack even without a suppressor and its hitscan with no drop either way as well.
---
Think of the children! You're just monsters in disguise, that's why we cannot see your faces!
---
Nope, the SATA standard is old AF and is limited by the backwards compatibility it provides. SATA was originally designed for HDD's which have are a physical spinning media. Because of this limitation SATA can at max theoretically reach speeds if 0.6GBps, while NVMe doesn't have this limit and presently runs at 16GBps (a 2667% increase) while manufacturers are looking to hit 32GBps (a5334% increase).  NVMe uses PCIe which allows for better multitasking and communication. It's the same standard that your graphics card uses. If your motherboard has an NVMe M.2 slot you will experience a faster load time or if not your hard drive will not be what slows you down. The next limiting factor is your RAM speed or CPU. When it comes to NVMe vs Sata for speed and performance, NVMe is always better.
---
You won't be able to synergize as well starting next season. In the patch notes it says smokes gas will be see through for both sides
---
Oh, ok
---
Well I play ranked in a 5 stack and mainly play casual because I don't feel like I need to take a game so seriously. If your so mad about party chat why not use a LFG app/discord to find player with mics rather than forcing them to not use party chat.

How is this toxic? Like what the fuck

Is this a ranked game? I play with my bro in casual all the time and if some teammate fucks around we take turns shooting them in the head.
---
You don't know what it's like on pc! In that .5 seconds, Glaz would have 360 no-scope collateralled 3 of your teammates through a wall and Blitz, Ash, and Ying would have already secured the objective! Stop being such a casual!
---
Am lord main can confirm
---
No, you don’t actually use the laser sight to aim without ADSing, it’s to make the bullets more accurate when you shoot from the hip.
---
This was a ranked game unfortunately:(
---
But my BB glaz is getting a buff
---
Oh damn that probably explains it. Team killing was a big issue but when when your teammate slowly chips away at your health you can’t do much about it
---
Well, guess I’ll be using a laser from now on

oof, that's always been no skill on console

If ur on console takes alot longer than half a second to take a screenshot....both have to pull up a menu then hit the screenshot...then you cant move while its taking the 3-5seconds to take said screenshot otherwise u wont get what u want in the picture

---
Maybe on ps4, on Xbox we have this nifty thing called “lfg” where you can form a squad with and link up in a party before you even join a match. Instead of soloing then getting upset no one is talking in casual.. because you kinda sound dumb to expect people to talk in random lobbies.

Just as you entered you had a huge lag spike with your internet mate, can’t blame the game on this one lads

Yes but still time delays and still long enough to die1

This is amazing

Theoretically, you can die instantly in this game so any amount of time is long enough to die

Thats old iirc, back when Ying first launched, could be wrong though

Heres a vid showing the difference in pc and console recoil with console having less recoil. While it is roughly 3 years old i couldnt find anything suggesting its changed other than fixing sight misalignment and all the other sites i read also said console has more recoil its just its far easier to control on pc.
---
Just because they dont give us the charts doesnt mean they dont take into account the other sections of the playerbase. The only people ive seen talk about the ela nerf is on this sub and all the people who say it was unnecessary have been ela mains and those who say it was needed are not. Clearly someone on console must have been bitching about the fo12 or they wouldnt have nerfed it. 
---
Damage is irrelevant in a game with one shot headshots. It has a high firerate so just spray at the enemies head. If it has a very quick dropoff then use it inside that range. The majority of siege encounters happen under i believe its 10m anyway. You say people are complaining about a shotgun being good inside its effective range yet youre whining about the scorpion being bad outside its effective range. Her pistol has a sight so you can take the fight to outside your effective range but the smart thing to do is force the enemy to fight you up close.

Ela works fine as a soft roam Intel op. Get them to fight on your terms. Stick inside small roams or around corners to get the jump on the enemy and fight them in your effective range. 5 seconds is a very long time in a game like siege that has a very quick ttk. You can stick them in places that are very hard to destroy like on the ceiling above a doorway as that will still catch most enemies, at which point you jump out and fill them with lead. Her gadgets are fine if you soft roam with her. Shields arent annoying to place down as they stick to doorways now and barbed being easily destroyed doesnt matter as you can hear it being destroyed.

Turn it off for long range, enemy dont really know where you are. Turn on for cqc with no real counterplay and better hipfire

Not showing off here, but am gril. I get two reactions from people when I speak. "\*gasp\* gril?? gril??" or "isn't it passed your bed time, kid?" I have one of those voices where you can't tell if I'm a 12 year old boy, or if I'm female. Either way, I get harassed or team killed. I'll give a call out, and most guys just ignore it, and harass me some more. I just wanna play the game, man. I'm not here to seek attention. I don't talk unless I have at least one male friend with me.

I’m waiting for the next season before I seriously go for a good rank. Been doing a lot of solo queing

I still don't get it how people in 2019 still don't have an SSD, they're ridiculously cheap in comparison from a few years back.
---
You shouldn't have tk'd him. Even if they're bering dicks, ignore them and move on. They won't do it if they don't get a reaction
---
Uh you posted this twice
---
That wouldn’t have worked, he just kept following me around and shooting me, then teabagging for every round so far

Oh

Ok will do

Me too , yet he is on +1 😅

Yeah but what you're saying isn't exclusive to console, that's his point. PC players backseat comm more than console because of this exact PTS reason.

They are working on it. Now the boost will be heavier for nearest teammates and the life bonus doesn't expires

I wouldn’t say so to be honest

I hope they don’t remove her recoil buffs, I love using that as the team breaches.
---
Such is the curse of modern day gaming, rest in pepperoni, common decency.

ranked is for competitive players so if you're competitive go ahead and try it

What kind of copper enemies are you playing? Especially that guy at 25 seconds. Just ran in and did literally nothing.
---
We should play sometime

Gotta love those teammates who don’t talk until they die 13 seconds into the match point round just to call you trash for not clutching the 1v5

I’d just go on and play. As long as your headset works just sound whore. I know that goes against a lot of what you’ve heard since you’ll be solo queing. It will give you a basis of what your skill is and your stats don’t look as terrible as you say they are. Just make sure to drone and don’t get overly greedy. 
---
Best of luck mate.
---
What's wrong? I feel fine buddy.
---
How???? If setting kapkan mines destroys the frost mat when triggered?? And then I have to look for super unlikely door frames for the enemy team to walk through...
---
You get the exclusive skins for the operators too?
---
Yea this has been on off season for me, on my main I got placed plat 3 and now I’m like gold 1 and this is my solo q account it’s usually up in plat but sadly it’s in like gold
---
Well if ubisoft would fix their game or implement microphone options so I COULD take ingame, that would be nice
---
thanks
---
This game was great at launch jk but at least the community was amazing
---
Hate this game mode
---
I year two EVERYBODY talked on PC and it was great
---
Oh I wasn’t disagreeing with him by any means, just throwing in my most heavily encountered experience.
---
Thanks you
---
They got rid of the starter edition. It’s just standard
---
You're kinda going on a rant over me making fun of the tryhards while defending the same argument as me. Just a little confused as to what you're getting at?
---
now think about that
---
Run outs would be EZ
---
Yeah that was pretty neat
---
true
---
Yeah just not the volcano weapon skin
---
They should be able to help you, If you also have a death certificate or such it would make it much easier for them.
---
Y'all are fucking idiots
---
They give elites based of popularity (pickrate) (+some other stuff) 
---
Its hard for lower picked operators to get an elite, because theyre not popular enough
---
Ubi wants to make money, if you make an elite skin for an operator noone fucking picks, thats wasted time which will give less money than giving the popular operators an elite skin
---
^^^i ^^^will ^^^die ^^^on ^^^this ^^^hill

but they only do that on match point when they could have been making callouts the last 4 rounds

You get every operator that has already been so, gridlock, mozzie, nokk, warden, amari, and goyo as well as the next two operators one from Kenya and one from India
---
Oh. I already have it but I thought that the skins were exclusive to the preorder too. Honestly though, the skins aren’t that much different from their original. My favorite season pass skins were lion and finkas.
---
Cute  :D

I like it

Hey.... You’re pretty *good*

Also on ps4  if you are in a party you can only here your party talk

The eyes and proportions REALLY remind me of Enter the Gungeon, I love it
---
They should just implement a high priority and low priority queue. The more you leave matches, the lower you will get. When playing all matches to the end, you won’t get queued into ongoing matches. You leave often, you get punished.
---
I occasionally start a match with "Hocus Pocus, focus on my scrotus". Can't really say I have an end-game plan for it, but it's something I guess.
---
I can get behind that
---
Imagine using push to talk rather than always open comms
---
The only random guy I have ever spoken to in Siege was a dude who communicated only via a sound board and it was the funniest thing.  I miss that madlad.

This has the most toxic people in the community but when a person is not toxic they are the most nicest player ever

Hey pal that video is from 2016. Fun fact it's 2019 now. 3 years later?

If they looked at the charts for other platforms and characters? Tell me why when they do one of these updates to characters do they always give the PC chart as an example. But when it's one specifically for console they never show us a chart or data? Funny huh. So if they always have data for one thing but never and have never shown any for the majority. I think there's a little bit of nothing they have in terms of data. 
---
Damage is a thing in games with one shot headshots. It's a big thing and always will be. Headshots happen much less than body shots. That is always going to be the case. So when you hit the body you do basically nothing with the scorpion. Fun right? No it's not. Fire rate does not really help in this situation either. "Oh just get headshots" That's not an argument. The scorpion is effective at 10m. Yes. That's smg range as well. The fact is every other smg can do mid range as well. Every single one. SMG's are both cqc 10m. and mid range which is 10m to about 20m. The Scorpion can't do that. And the majority of gun fights happen within 15m. Especially early game. Which for roamers is primarily where you're going to see enemies. 
---
Just because a pistol has a sight on it does not negate the lowest damage of all handguns, the poorest fall off range of all handguns. The sight is a niche it helps but doesn't fix anything. How are you going to force enemies to you as Ela? How? A grzmot mine will push them away to a more secure position so don't give me that crap. You can't. You need to push up as Ela. She's a roamer. None of her secondary gadgets or primary gadget help her do that.
---
Ela does not work fine as a soft roamer. If she stays in one general area the attackers will find her. Every gun in the game can out gun the scorpion. The FO-12 in a gun fight can be out ranged. her pistol is just, out everythinged. If the attackers know where she is which they will eventually they can easily kill her like that. They can avoid her as well or push her from two directions. Something she wont be able to face against. She works best as a flanker and aggressive roamer away from objective. So she won't be easily found. She's not even great at doing that compared to everyone else persay Vigil, or Bandit. Every job she can do someone does it better. Every single job. She's not good at anything. She's not mediocre at anything, she's not even somewhat viable at doing the most simple of task when put up against her fellow roamers and team mates.  5 seconds in siege is nothing. Especially when the mines usually only go off early game where every attacker has a buddy about 5 feet away from him aimed at the door you're going to come out of. 5 seconds means nothing when they can stop and find cover whilst still sprinting and being able to shoot. They can't ADS but still shoot. And things like the G8a1 are really good at hip fire from my personal game play. If you put a grzmot on the ceiling it probably won't go off due to it's height. A lot of people like to crouch and it won't go off if they do. Even if they're still standing up the ceiling is very easy to see something on when most maps have white, gray, or brown ceilings. A black glowing object is very very noticeable on blank surfaces. If the attacker knows choke points on the map which a lot of people do. If they know you're in the game as Ela they'll expect to see grzmots at those door ways. The fact that you only have 3 as well makes them even less effective. You can only trap 3 doors and most objective rooms have a hatch, a window or two, two door ways, a breakable soft wall, a break soft ceiling, etc. Have fun being able to trap all of that.
---
Her secondary gadgets are borderline useless. Even for soft roaming they're pointless. That still requires her to move and two stationary gadgets will never help her. Shields are the most buggy pieces of equipment in all of siege. Half the time you have to fiddle around in every direction to get them to fit in certain areas they should be able to fit in already. And if they're in doorways. the pretty much picked every single game Ash or Zofia will have a nice impact coming straight towards your cranium. Barbed wire does make noise when being destroyed. But it also makes it practically useless when it is destroyed. And for a roamer it gives no added benefit to you what so ever. You can say it helps the team. But that entirely negates the purpose of why you have gadgets in the first place, they're to help you. 
---
Impacts and a camera would do Ela wonders. It'd probably negate her shitty weapons all together asides the Scorpion lack of horizontal diamond. Valkyrie for example has pretty meh guns. They're okay but not great. But her gadgets are really fucking good. They benefit both her and the team by giving off information and allowing her to throw explosives like every other roamer. Now give Ela impacts it allows her to be able to soft breach, an essential roaming mechanic for getting around the map more easily without having to use the shotgun. Give her a camera as well and she'll be much further developed as a information gathering operator which she is. She gathers info as a roamer. Yet she's pretty bad at doing that compared to everyone else. Adding those two gadgets would do her wonders.
---
Its harder to make a non competitive map competitive than making small changes to a almost competitive map to make it competitive. I feel like  Yacht is a hard one to balance due to the shape of it like plane. Also, look a herefor, they tried to balance a atrocious map and failed.
