White mask's gas grenades are same as smoke's ones at article 5 cutscenes, but also smoke has a headgear that similiar to cutscene's rainbow team. So its possible to smoke picked up some canisters from ground while beign part of operation article 5, than researched and used it against his enemies. Thats just my theory.

That's not comparable to toy soldiers. Anime-themed event is too niche, not 100% of Siege players would enjoy that. They'd never do it. Toy soldiers is understandable, it's nostalgic, lots of people had them as kids, and even those who didn't still love them.
---
Maybe see cure area and hostage should be added to unranked and not to ranked.
---
That's a body stuck in the top of the window.
---
And her arm dangling down from the top of the window.
---
I dont believe guns change the dynamic of gameplay so much as gadgets but maybe that's just a me thing
---
No, it was an April Fools event. Wasn't it?
---
And you keep showing me that you need to learn to counter it like a good caveira is hard to deal with and a good blitz or Monty is hard to deal with when you counter them they stop it most of the time
---
Blitz
---
Would smash
---
I have the blitz elite in my list! Just finished the lord
---
Step 1 : go to School

---
Step 2 : learn to read
---
The post with your friends Cav is literally right above this post in my feed. 
---
Both look really good and like you guys put a lot of effort into it.
---
I was on 5-10 minutes ago i dont think so
---
None of those operators are hard to deal with except blitz. And he requires a team so he doesnt just get clapped. You keep coming up with stupid rebuttals and ill keep slapping them down.
---
Thank you random persona fan :]
---
It's all good nice ace
---
And I‚Äôm talking from the console point of view pc is probably different
---
Xbox one.
---
Same
---
It's just been bad for me due to getting paired against diamonds every single time
---
He says it "wArDeN"
---
The sad thing is they fixed it in the most recent patch they put out today. Ngl I liked it when cav had the glitched face it was scarier
---
Ok thanks!
---
You can, just dont enable the ban phase.
---
You challenge Tachanka?
---
Lesion on defense for sure.
---
I cannot tell which others you do not have
---
Yes if your close (high silver low gold) but if your gain / loss  diffrence is high then yes
---
nah, he lagged out and joined back right before the round started.
---
Yeah that's the problem I'm facing rn. The grind is just too much. I've been playing for a couple weeks and have only unlocked 3 ops.
---
But the memes
---
Buy Alibi this season and wait till next season when Mavericks price drops to 20k
---
Yeah I see that, are you new? If so try the newcomers playlist, there will be smurfs but there always will be, just hopefully there are less than in casual.
---
Casual is wildly unfun and repetitive. The rounds are far too long and nothing about it is interesting.
---
&gt; I dont believe guns change the dynamic of gameplay s**o much as gadgets**
---
That I'll absolutely agree with but take extreme's like the F2 or the R4C when it had the ACOG and those two alone made many people play their respective operators by themselves, after those we've seen newer weapons that have pretty much no recoil like Mav's M4 which can really draw people in.
---
It's not that I think "guns &gt; gadgets" but that I don't agree that guns have no effect on how the game is played and that even with gadgets mattering more than guns doesn't mean we can't have more guns.
---
He provides 0 utility and it was ridiculous that u not picking an op in time was defaulted to recruit.  He has a huge arsenal of weapons but that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all. He provides 0 help to an actual team. Sure it‚Äôs fun to handicap yourself sometimes tbh but not in a ranked game at all.
---
Welcome to Siege.
---
I wake up feeling so horny
---
Because one or a even a few players having "fun" while playing recruit interfere with fun of the other teammates that are trying to win the match. 
---
Against a good team playing recruit is a loss of utility for that team.
---
Lesion, maverick and zofia
---
I get it, you‚Äôre not good-_-
---
I saw somthing that it was free
---
&gt; Casual is wildly unfun and repetitive. The rounds are far too long and nothing about it is interesting.
---
with a booster you can get 1-2 ops per day easy
---
Come up with a theme of your channel. From there, keep making videos related to said theme. 
---
Keep working at it as the market is heavily saturated.
---
He has utility equipment and offensive equipment. The gamemode is always TDM + bomb/hostage/secure area. The best way to help? Kills
---
Literally did almost the exact same thing a few years ago
---
Maverick, lesion and goyo when ember rise releases
---
but why is it wrong? More money for ubi should theoretically mean more investments in the game and what's wrong with that? we've seen increases in prize pools for official competitions as well as more assets used to market the game. 
---
Personally for me, the battlepass seems no different to buying skins. The only difference you paying once to get a handful of cosmetics. The only thing that would annoy me would be if they priced it slightly on the high side or more.
---
I‚Äôm going through the same thing rn I just made an instagram for all my game clips and I‚Äôm starting a YouTube channel and I‚Äôm trying to get growing too.
---

a guy playing blackbeard complaining about fairness.  Thats rich.
---
By adding another playlist, you're just making the queue times go higher...which they're already terrible.
---
Could probably go to the wiki
---
Yeah I know that‚Äôs a plus but I just feel like if one person leaves then that team is at a disadvantage for the whole match
---
Didn't expect to see a console vs pc war in the comments but here we are. I'm just gonna say this no matter what platform you are on, it's all about game sense. If you are a smart player you'll be a good player no matter what the platform. No amount of better controls or aim will help a player with no brain cells.
---
In the time it takes for them to headshot you 3 times, you can line up a headshot of your own. Then DPS doesn't matter.
---
uh? this makes no sense, the only difference between good pc players and good console players is the aim, for obvious reasons but that doesn't mean that players on console have shit aim, maybe the console players you see on here have shit aim but thats just because they are shit lol.
---
Breaching pants
---
I saw some fanart of Blitz cooking eggs just like this
---
it wont.
---
Your avoiding the question because of your shit stats what‚Äôs ur name
---
I just hope it comes free for season pass holders
---
Had to do with the cav face modle bug that happened on the test server yesterday. Her face literally melted lol.
---
Bro I can‚Äôt sign in to my other acc :( how do I know if it got banned
---
I am mildly confused............
---
No but r6 peeking system isn't the best.
---
Maestro's cams can set off the shield
---
what question you moron? are you even talking to me?
---
Cheapest to the most expensive in order 
---
Grind the game &gt; 
---
Wait for a sale and get he complete edition for like $50 &gt;
---
Get the year 1 &amp; 2 bundles, &gt; 
---
Get the year 4 pass then grind out the remaining ops using renown&gt; 
---
Buy the operators using credit.
---
Why the long faceüòè?

U suck bro

Well first of all there is no guarantee that backfill always works on casual. I had lots of matches that started 4vs5 or 3vs5 and ended as same. Also no backfill after match point and lost tons of matches from 2-0 to 2-3. I prefer leaving penalty instead of backfill chance that's why I'm gonna play fully unranked
---
You are aware that not every single player in casual is a complete shitter right?
---
That's not at all what my comment said
---
take assists one kill assist is 75 and injure assist is 50 that be 125 a normal kill is 100 and a headshot 120 now with bomb spot gadget detroyed and all is the reason he has more points
---
Ok, then twitch not being able to is a little bs, they have basically the same ability, one is a drone and one is a cam.
---

You do not play in challenger don't even give me that lmfao
---
*It's a 1v1. You're trying to slowly creep towards the objective to plant. Suddenly, you hear the smooth dragging of blubbery flesh behind you. Your time has come.*
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.
---
definitely mind the push to talk to a mouse side button, thats a godsend
---
And I approve your theory, pretty good and coherent.
---
Bound your primary gadget to mouse 5 and secondary to mouse 4 (both your side buttons) bind lean left to caps lock, lean right to e, and q to switch weapons
---
idk dude
---
Questioning why in the fuck did i never realise that siege is fucking odd
---
Is your offer still standing? No matter how hard I try I can't get out of the claws of Silver
---
Yeah I learned this today. Im getting back into the game after many months away. 
---
And I was confused by the amount of obvious smurfing. 
---
Probably just gonna do my best back in normal matchmaking haha.
---
bc I think the people here care more about r6 than youtube tips and tricks
---
I agree, I think that she should be able to set them off. Ubi might have done this to make it so she cant just set them off during the prep phase, but I think it should be treated like miras, if you dont want them to be set off/ use up your utility in the prep phase, you need to protect them from twitch drones.
---
I don‚Äôt see how we‚Äôre hating on casual, just usually funny clips like this happen in casual. Also casual in my opinion is a lot more toxic than ranked. I‚Äôm also a diamond and play casual though.
---
Its gamebalance over realism but the "lore" reasoning is that evil eyse are shooting lasers and twitch drones are only spike with a bit of electricity which doesnt set off the explosive part.
---
I thought they patched this
---
Artist name?
---
Das pretty good
---
just saw the comment where you're bragging about having a positive kd, i searched you up and you been stuck in gold for ages and never got past gold 2, you clearly don't know what playing at high level means so you shouldn't be talking about "challenge" my psn is Fcrbiddxn you can search that up if that makes you happy
---
It looks better
---
Yeah.. I'm a jackal main though.

---
Jdwagnr, keep your excuses coming

Sure mate
---
But I didn't throw down a 1.02 KDA on Ela like it was hot shit when it's painfully average
---
Thanks for explaining
---
Nag and I checked the patch notes to ember rise and they ain't patching it then either lmao üòÇüòÇüëå
---
I appreciate the game balance, I also understand the laser vs. electric shock on little thing, so I am ok with it, even though that should be the other way around, a shock sets it off, not a laser.
---
Says the dude with a Saran Wrap sheildü§£
---
It's the developers' second choices for the camo selected for pro league sets
---
Just make your move and sneak around
---
I wouldn't mind twitch being able to pop them if it took her 3/4darts to break one.
---
Yeah but the recoil is so low you can easily adjust it the downside is for longer range the damage drop off really is like a toy gun.
---
Alright, think I might grab the game if I can get the operators with in-game currency. 
---
How much time would it take to get another operator? I assume it's like League or any other F2P and newer operators are more expensive.

1) first one is free, give it a try before to judge its negativity.

I'm gonna pay for it, I support Ubisoft development group.

people who can‚Äôt read the sub rules deserve to be banned. change my mind

Then maybe its console servers, but its definitely not my problem when the only thing I can see is their head, I shoot at them, blood comes out and their character screams, and then they don't die.
---
anyone else y'all had in mind for me to draw
---
people who can‚Äôt read the sub rules before posting should be perma banned

Ok 3 memes in a row about this, what happen with cav?
---
OH GREAT I PAID 100 FOR A GAME AND HAVE TO PAY FOR A BATTLEPASS IN ORDER TO GET A STORY. WOW. Fucking ridiculous the point is that they are locking this shit behind a battlepass when they dont need to. It's meant to look cool so you buy it that's the point they are taking advantage of you by putting up a paywall.
---
Looks good. Good work!
---
I think theres a subreddit for it
---
It does not violate rule one, because yes, the image does not directly relate to siege, but the over content of the post does. It does not violate rule nine, because there is not text over layed onto the image.
---
What the fuck? I could never pull that off...
---
Apparently Ashs secret to having no hitbox was Naruto running down a hallway.

okay i get yeah. they dont even have to play it moreso just learn. so yeah lets take a pro player like Pengu for example who was the OG of Blackbeard. have him teach about how he is most effective. that be awsome.
---
They're red boots used by the IDF actually, makes sense considering Ash is Israeli.
---
Ash best r6 girl
---
that escalated extremely quickly
---
it does violate rule 1 because the IMAGE has no game assets. that‚Äôs what the rule says. the caption does not matter with rule 1. 
---
this does violate rule 9 because it‚Äôs custom created artwork that is a meme. 
---
last time i‚Äôm saying it. read the sub rules. i‚Äôm not arguing with you anymore because i know the rules and clearly you don‚Äôt

I dont know how to upload images on reddit, but here is 1 video from siege 1.0 on release and another in current siege. there is a big difference in graphical quality and lighting. There are other clips where its more noticable but it would take to long to find them
---
"It actually takes effort. Much easier to adjust ammo capacity up or down by 10 bullets or to randomise the recoil more," said no Ubi dev ever.
---
Just an excuse to not find the artist in the first place. 
---
Especially when you look at how one of the artwork reposted is Pericote who is one of the most famous R6 fanartists out there and the google search immediately shows that it's her work. 
---
If you look at OP's comment history, there's one comment I think is removed by the Mods or banned that's just OP telling others to get off their phone and go outside instead of criticizing him for reposting.
---
Guessing you're fun at parties
---
Do you play a lot of casual games compared to rank games? Do you consistently win a lot of casual games? 
---
[The system is the same as the rank system but with casual game MMR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/6xi74j/changes_to_casual_matchmaking_in_season_3/)
---
here is a direct quote from rule 9. 
---
‚Äúimage macros include simple image edits such as superimposing or other imagery as well as applying filters.‚Äù
---
the g word with a hard R? man you one brace soul
---
Level 195-ish but I share my account with my roommates
---
I just hate how seriously people take ranked and how easily they freak
---
No, rule one does not say the image must relate to siege, it says the content must relate to siege, and obviously this post relates to siege.  And it does violate rule nine, because once again, the text is not over layed onto the image. If the titles text were slapped onto the table, followed with ‚Äúchange my mind‚Äù then yes, it would violate rule nine.
---
Also pre- White noise pistol recoil, why was this buffed? i liked the old recoil much better it just looks not stupid when you fire a pistol.
---
I got the season pass as well and I‚Äôve only gotten 1 legendary from an alpha pack since I bought the game like 2 years ago and I really couldn‚Äôt care less because it‚Äôs free stuff.
---
Yes, but this post in no way has edited the image. Has it?
---
This is upsetting
---
yeah i‚Äôm not arguing with you anymore. the rules are clear to most people except you i guess
---
My squad already uses all 3 of the frag ops nearly every round and we have a dokkaebi main as well. We're gonna have 8 frags more often than not.
---
Like how a jaeger main answers it.
---
You‚Äôre not arguing with me because you realize that you are wrong.
---
Where are you getting this idea that its popping up after every game with bright lights playing a siren noise saying "THIS LOSER IS ONLY TIER 4 LOL 16 MORE TEIRS FOR THE MUTE BUNDLE - EXCLUSIVE TO PREMIUM BATTLEPASS OWNERS (YEAH THE GOOD PLAYERS)"
---
You're complaining about something there is very limited information on.
---
Btw, i have had 4 accounts (all bought at $8 to $20 each) with most operators. They only ones missing are ops i don't play. Absolute waste buying the $100 edition
---
Ok that was an unnecessary reply. He didn't insult you.
---
if you say so lol that‚Äôs why my original comment has more upvotes than this post or any of your comments. because people know what the rules mean
---
imagine wasting your time to write sexist comments on some random person online... LUL get a life and learn some manners or you‚Äôll be single for ever.
---
what are you smoking??
---
Yeah they are. 1 full season and nothing other than common except one black ice.
---
But they are free so we can't really complain.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I hate R6 fan art, but I hate people who don‚Äôt give credit even more
---
Deleting all your comments now huh?
---
The dev skin or one of the VIP pass skins for the r6 events as only a couple hundred of those exist
---
Wow I thank you so much!
---
Whoa whoa whoa! I get the insult to the player but why their mother?! Gosh! Simmer down, bruv.
---
I bought the 100 dollar because I have a ubi account already and dont like using g2a or reselling sites. I guarantee battlepass progress will be shown and contrasted with the premium progress.
---
how are they not free. you don‚Äôt have to pay anything for them and all you have to do to get them is play the game.
---
Fine, you‚Äôre a hoe
---
not all of them. still not responding to my latest point huh?
---
Safer, but I don't throw. At all.
---
Good
---
Better not be. I just bought this a month or so ago.
---
Wholesome af.
---
Willing to bet one of two things happened next round. He was either team killed, or kicked.
---
How much do you play? If you do 8 hours a day like the streamers then no because you will have more renown than you have a use for.
---
I play around 3-5 casual games per session while waiting for friends/warm up. And I win pretty much every game as the enemy team have such low ranks. You have any idea if leaving casual games affects your MMR? Because I often leave midgame.
---
My squad usually goes with a Buck, Finka, Sledge, Dokkaebi, and usually an op with a claymore. 
---
We have weird strats but they usually rely on being able to blow everyone up. A normal round usually consists of a squad with 6 grenades, and at least one claymore. (Two claymores if our Dokkaebi main isn't on that night.) 
---
This update, combined with us banning Jager 100% of the time, is gonna be good for my squad.
---
Nice
---
Can we just appreciate the pun?
---
Yeah they're overpriced and take too long to earn, then what you get is usually filler. Probably the worst pack system in a paid game.
---
I can tell you when i got my pc last spring it was so much fun to learn the game ‚Äùagain‚Äù
---
Waste of a breach charge if you ask me

Ty! I got really inspired by the new bios in the test server

It's because of these kids that i don't mic at all here, I really want to, but i'm afraid of being shouted on and voted out

There's no way!No one can just deflect the Cluster Charge !

Not meaning to be harsh and you clearly put some effort into this, but; this is pretty shit. There‚Äôs no two ways about it. I mean you literally copied the image and made it look worse. You didn‚Äôt bother to erase mistakes and your coloring is horrid.. These kinds of posts are the reason that there is an agenda of shitposting on this sub, which in turn creates a negative image of the game. This looks like it was drawn by a 5yr old, which is a reasonably estimate for the mental age of most siege players. A for effort tho /s
---
Why is Sledge so fookin THICC
---
I really feel bad when you have teammates who throw (even if it benefits me) I just played a game where 2 people threw on the other team, I felt bad for the other team they really couldn‚Äôt win.

I have I just prefer the other secondary
---
Yeah I agree with this comment. You can start by having an advantage if you‚Äôre good at shooters but also at a disadvantage for not knowing the map layouts which is very key. Learning the map helps with placement, where enemies travel the most frequently depending on the defending location and so on. Also all the different classes will need to be learned to defend/attack against their abilities.
---
Well thought out and considered response you have.
---
&gt;Also - I love this quiet censorship with removing Battlepass posts and calling it "gathering data in one place"
---
UBImafiAAA.
---
3 Speed and very slight buff to FMG might be enough to bring her up so much more. 
---
Many ppl are asking for a different gun but I'm afraid that might not be enough to buff her enough when she will still be 2 Speed with questionable gadget and no utility. 
---
Even without buffing her gadget and gun, if Nokk become 3 Speed, she will feel so much better overall.
---
i lkie the idea i myself ofen tought abut this
---
but the problem is :
---
1.attackers wont be able to get rid of a half reinforced wall because they werent designet to do that 
---
example: 
---
Thermite? charges  too big
---
maverick? wouldnt be able to even go near the wall 
---
hibana? banned
---
2. as a defender if u go from crouched to normal standing your head will always pop up as first without knowing where the enemy is while the attacker are alredy aimed at you 
---
my suggestion: only mira should be able to do that 
---
she can choose between two regular walls OR two half walls but the half wall only with mira windows this will allow the attacker to counter these wall also defender would have information before they decide to peek 
---
&amp;#x200B;

constructive feedback is welcome

---
Same team banning Jackal and Caveira lmao
---
Wonder what can be done with Amaru to be better though (it's little fast to judge but still). 
---
With Warden and Nokk, ppl have been suggesting several different ideas that are all valid to certain degree. 
---
The only thing I can think for Amaru is make her rappelling faster and maybe the windows to break when Amaru is going through it.
---
It's not friendly to new people so please try to get a group of people to play with. It will help you A LOT to get a firm grip on this game

then you're doing something wrong lol

Imagine Ubi give a much longer duration for her gadget. I'll accept that as well especially if Ubi DOES decide to give her a different gun.
---
A DMR/Shotty combo would be neat. The only problem is that the Six12 SD is weak and inconsistent, and needs a buff. Higher firecap, less recoil, better range, tighter spread, and better soft destruction. Maybe a 417, since it's overshadowed by the V308 and FAMAS?
---
Don't switch if you have full control on console. It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
The two key things that take a while but are crucial are 1) understanding the game mechanics (what the gadgets do and what they do to the environment) 2) learning maps. Both you can learn in the scenario training missions then terrorist hunt. Coop terrorist hunt can be a great way to learn to play in a team but it can also be really toxic. Yes this game has a toxic community, and it‚Äôs actually important to learn to ignore it.  Finding some folks to play with regularly can be a real confidence builder. Your going to suck when you start, this game is just that unique and the learning curve is that big. But if you can brush it off, learn from others, and even be bold or reckless at times to try out new tactics and experiment it can be really fun. Don‚Äôt be intimidated by it. Also I think they have a beginners setting for people under rank 50 so that might be useful.
---
Good tip. What I did, just strictly play ranked. Warm up in T, hunt. Don‚Äôt take it so serious, and with time you get better and better.
---
Is this THunt?!
---
you don't need to have a garbage rank
---
I'm glad to hear that, i was hoping the problem would be less rampant after the elo and ranked updates. thats why i'm here.

don't buy it, like you get free skins for playing and you still complain, kek

That could work, nonetheless I just wish they stuck with whatever they had her mags with and made it semi auto unless they couldn‚Äôt, because the FMG9 for me sucks unless it‚Äôs very upclose or lucky. The shotgun is fine since it‚Äôs stealthy but definitely needs a buff.

I think that the claim that she's too strong with an assault rifle is BS. She's too weak now, and would be well served by having a "bad" rifle like the G36C or AUG A2 (and hopefully she'd hold it further from her face than IQ).

Its hidden behind an unnecessary paywall that can cause people to spend more money and prey on human psychology to entrench a user and get them to purchase tiers or whatever other bullshit. I already get free skins for playing with renown and alpha packs they are just finding an excuse to lock kore content behind an unnecessary paywall that is worse than just having to outright buy a skin. Obv free skins are going to be worse than the premium battlepass skins anyways. Oml remember when progression was free in games jeez. R6s "progression" is already monetized with boosters and r6 credits why should I have another system that I can easily waste money in that doesnt need to exist in the first place. Ubi makes more than enough money off of r6 they are doing this to pacify the community and slowly introduce more intrusive microtransactions. Especially when shit like lore is on the line ofc I'm going to be upset. Why does the fucking story of your game need to be on a battlepass, I have bought games cheaper where I can unlock everything and access all lore with a campaign and multiplayer mode so dont even try and act like this is anywhere near ok.
---

Yeah, i would really like to see the gadget upgraded, but since they have Cav and Vigil's abilities at extremely short durations now, I doubt that would happen.

And it's not my bloated ego it's just fun "whispers especially with a full smurf squad"

It doesn't directly affect the recoil, but it makes it harder to control because using a suppressor denies you the extra recoil control of the other barrels.
---
Jesus you are dense. That was just an example and I‚Äôm not actually sure how many games it can take for someone to decide they don‚Äôt want to play the game anymore and then they go and get their money back because they simply didn‚Äôt enjoy their time playing. It happens more often than you think and is why refunds are a thing.
---
&gt;And it's not my bloated ego it's just fun "whispers especially with a full smurf squad"

Are you seriously trying to justify it by being in a full squad of smurfs? Because that makes what you‚Äôre doing even more shitty.

While your point is very accurate, my only problem is that in R6 you can't buy Lootboxes. And I don't think the Pass will change that. You have to play to actually get them. I think that kind of reduces the addiction rate. Unless I'm wrong, in which case please correct me.
---
dunno for sure but should be about 60 and above, my setup (ryzen 2600x and gtx 1060 with 6gb) handles a little over high settings with smooth 70 (capped it there, my screen doesnt get more than 70 hrz)

i've been in school for 1 week...

The number of times that I‚Äôve been attacking and had all three attacking rounds stressed and still beaten them in those rounds only for them to ddos the server before the forth round is hilarious! But in all honesty, I don‚Äôt believe Amaru will be an issue at all. You said yourself that the stressing only really happens once you get into platinum and if your teams isn‚Äôt watching the bomb site then you really kind of deserve to lose the round. If the tactic you are saying is what they will do then only Amaru will be on site and she will be planting... aka no cover. She won‚Äôt be a problem.

i bought MHW Iceborn on ps4, uninstalled BF5 trash (because of greedy EA), Apex Legends too.

MHW have small amount of cosmetics, and dev company has respect for their work.

Can not imagine, that they will add SEASONS, Battlepasess, etc. Because it is possible, but they do not do it.

No, you can destroy their vests and they will shoot at you with a rifle. The L8A5 I think? They can also use it while rushing you.

Things could change for sure but I feel there‚Äôs a good basis here

Sadly, in the UK at least this is not the case. Next Monday mate. Kids are goneeee

and that's a good thing, it's way too unbalanced to be good in ranked. it is fun in casual tho

&gt; "The battle pass is  a great opportunity for us to develop our universe"  
---
~ Emmanual Bajolle
---
Suuuuure, because before Battle Passes existed, video games could not ever develop a universe or lore of a game.
---
What charm is that?
---
And a black smoke
---
They try to turn ranked into an actual competitive mode instead of basically casual with up to 9 rounds which is the best thing they‚Äôve done so far imo. I really don‚Äôt get why people liked secure and hostage I always found them to be completely dumb and kind of impossible to balance.

I don‚Äôt play much ranked and neither do my friends. As you said if I put some effort into ranked I could change my kd. How long that will take, I depends. I don‚Äôt play siege to be super competitive, I play it bcos it‚Äôs fun. Ranked just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me so I don‚Äôt think that I will ever bother putting some time into it. I think that if the ranked kd‚Äôs were replaced with casual kd‚Äôs it would just be better.
---
I was a competitive COD4 player back in the old good days and when I downloaded R6S I felt like you anyway. Its a bit strange fps, you have to practice alot to understand the mechanics and the flow of the game. Just be patient, and watch some youtubers (not the pro guys who simply kill and bang bang, the one who help you with tips and tricks)
---
Can't wait for Operation: Crusade Sun
---
ha, **it**
---
&gt;im not new to competitive or shooters but theres so much going on and so much that can be done that i feel overwhelmed
---
You just kind of have to push through it. 
---
While learning the game, stick to operators that are more direct in their purpose and goal - on defense choosing Rook means you can contribute to your team with very little knowledge necessary. Jager and Bandit are sort of the same. There are "better" ways to play it, but just throwing down the ADS and the batteries on any reinforced wall on the objective probably helps more than it hurts. 
---
Attackers like Sledge and Thatcher are good as well - Sledge just allows you to bust open everything. Thatcher? Just follow the Thermite or Hibana. 
---
Just find out what characters you can personally handle using, and stick to them while you learn everything else.
---
If you don't have enough time to reload your primary or if your enemy is too far away to shoot with a shotgun.
---
ha
---
When you run out of ammo in your primary (in a fight).
---
Potential Metallica reference in Siege? Fucking upvote. Easy.
---
A couple of hours is nothing. That‚Äôs why. Some of us have thousands of hours and are still learning. 
---
On YouTube go watch: Braction, GRMP, Get_Flanked, Rouge-9, Varsity Gaming, Grief-Drums are a few good places to learn about the game.
---
When u in tense situation and cba reloading primary or I u using shotgun and need a long range/ end of corridor fight

---
Then again, he‚Äôs a scrum half so he‚Äôs used to bossing people about, letting other people do the dirty work, and just generally having little man syndrome
---
When in a gunfight and running out of ammo?
---
When you want to sprint faster, when you run low on ammo. That's about it.
---
1. When you run out of ammo and don't have time to reload
---
2. You have shotguns as primary
---
3. Sneaky beaki with suppressor

Many artists have pointed out in the past that once the there are enough reposts and those that got more attention than the original, the reposted ones are the one that shows up first instead of the originals when someone attempts to find the artist. 
---
One an artwork is reposted, sooner or later others starts reposting without credit (OP in different thread said he couldn't even read the watermark and only said "artist as bottom" after being called out multiple times) and ends up being posted everywhere. 
---
Dead By Daylight fan artists had a problem about a couple of years ago or so when bunch of Korean artists' work ended up being reposted everywhere and ended up with several different ppl erasing the watermark to claim that they drew the artwork. Those artists now use private server to share artworks with their fans only now. 
---
Even Pericote who draws R6 artworks and have said fine with reposting to certain degree, voiced annoyance at reposters couple of times.
---
I just mean if you're ranked K/D is only like 60 kills 100 deaths. You can quickly change that round.
---
Also it sounds like you have a performance anxiety issue. Ranked is just longer casual. So if it's K/D you care about then just think about it as a longer casual.
---
I personally enjoy the staying on defence or attack for several rounds in a row rather than the flip flopping in casual. As it ruins my flow with an operator.
---
Mira is a sht for lowskills. I ban her every game
---
[deleted]
---
Don‚Äôt worry I have a jaeger clip in the same match ill post later
---
Point is, everyone has had a game where they didn't get any kills in the first round. If the teammate was talking trash after only one round, then he/she is a complete ass-hat and deserves to be treated like such.
---
New operator leak???
---
jesus i‚Äôm stupid thank you
---
I‚Äôm not even going to begin to explain what‚Äôs wrong with your comment, mainly because it reads like a massive troll.

Ying might need to work on her situational awareness
---
ah
---
&gt;  Cosmetics are not taking away from other aspects of the game. 
---
they are in a sense that you have a limited number of resources. rainbow six siege isnt a game made by a team in the void. theya re a part of ubisoft montreal and toronto. if you dont need 100 people working on rainbow then you move them to a different division work on different project. but you cant have all the people working on one game so if you want to boost your marketing team you cant boost your other teams. you want more people to design skins, work on monetization? other teams are gonna suffer from that. you just cant have it all. its alway either or, this team or that team.
---
its kinda hard arguing with you when you just discard everything. " Terrible way to look at this " terrible world we live in. "Unless you know every decision" obviously i dont thats not the point.
---
&gt;   Bugs take time to fix. Different teams work on different schedules towards different goals. 
---
its clear thet they do but they dont get fixed unless its critical they did. just take a look at wow classic rereleasec 15 years later. some of the old bugs are still there. do you know why? wow was THE mmo back in the day so blizz didnt have to fix those bugs, what were you gonna do? not play the only good mmo? 15 years later, same old shit.
---
you know, you make a lot of sense, but ubisoft doesnt really care much. they want as many new players as possible and the notion nowadays is that people only like easy stuff that strokes their egos and doesnt really challenge them. you see this literally with every game. starts out "hardcore" and becomes a watered down casual noob experience at the end. that wont change anytime soon. Im not gonna play this game anymore, invested enough time and money and I have had it. look what Dice is doing...people still play battlefield 5 and think its a great game..the same here, people justify that its totally fine that maps either dissappear or are only given to you under specific conditions (map rotation) things I payed for with the season pass. they can do that, but thats it for me.
---
If your main problem is that you die too often, what helps from my experience is:
---
-on attack try to use your drone as much and efficient as possible, for example use the droning phase to position your drone near the route you want to take in and make sure to check it before entering
---
-when it comes to firefights there is no universal formula to win IMO, but trying to find the right balance between aggressive peaking and staying down and waiting for your opponent to push will win you a lot (just try what works for you)
---
-try to anticipate the actions of your opponent, view the round and the firefights as some kind of small chess games (observing other players will give you an idea on how the most people play the game) 
---
Hope this helps, have a good day
---
Will this skin be taken out of the game at the beginning of next season?
---
I like doing this on favela with tchanka. Set his gun up right in the top stairwell window and blast the obvious rooftop spawns to pieces
---
Thanks for ur advice I appeaciate. Btw I am deleting this post bcos the mistake in the title.
---
Ok guys, this is epic, Ash is a vape lord.
---
So what you're saying is you don't want the free stuff the free battle pass stream will give you. I don't like free shit either. Fuck alpha packs too.

ah ok

And? What kind of response is that? Are you fucking 12yo or what? Moron

So is this an event? Like a couple years ago? Or is this a whole damn game?

If it comes with that feature it's better than planned. hahaha

Just play the game, you'll learn as you go, play terrorist hunt, and watch some content creators. You'll learn as time goes on

Nah, nah, he asked for you. Also, I‚Äôm pretty sure that video was before the latest recoil nerf.
---
Yep...
---
On the internet we're all stereotypes.
---
Then you‚Äôd have people spending 20 minutes trying to get a sentence in. Also what button should be used for text chat for team and everyone? We‚Äôre already missing out on leaning without scope because the control doesn‚Äôt have enough buttons
---
Aye I got that same carpet
---
How is it not? You said "who cares when it's only cosmetic" and I replied that people care about looking cool [through the use of cosmetics]. They seem like the same subject to me.
---
LOL
---
But this time he has a gun
---
Why
---
First of all, how is UBI‚Äôs workers supposed to make living? Should they just make the game free and work on the game for free because it is their passion? Youre a massive idiot. HUGE. Ubisoft does microtransactions the best I have seen in any game. The things you buy are PURELY cosmetic. Thats it, doesnt affect gameplay or anything else. When you think about it, you dont even see your character in game so why do skins matter? If its such a big deal dont buy the skins, battlepass, season pass or anything. You can spend $30 on this game and with some time you can be just like everyone else. I personally buy the season pass every year, and if the battlepass trial that we get this season is good, or I enjoy it, i may purchase the PAID version of the battlepass to support a game I love. You dont need to buy anything and no one is forcing you to. So get off your high horse. If you want to leave, good for you, no body cares. But dont go spewing nonsense.

Because I'm not talking about it from the pov of people wanting to look cool. I'm saying who cares regarding people complaining about it being sold.
---
&gt;They seem like the same subject to me.
---
Context.
---
This was a generic ‚ÄúHey your activity prompted a mod response and you‚Äôre under review.‚Äù
---
I do this stuff for a living, and for me I‚Äôm literally paid to assume every joke is a literal statement.
---
So if you come in and joke with me ‚ÄúI wanna die‚Äù I have to escalate it and send someone to make sure you‚Äôre okay mentally.
---
Most mods are volunteers, but being that there‚Äôs a decent Ubisoft presence on the discord, they probably handle most things a little more professionally than the standard discord server.
---
Best recommendation would be just to stay chill about it and let the review process fly over, they‚Äôll deem it a mistake and let you off with a warning as long as you don‚Äôt get combative.

No, this is for maintenance, not the new season. That comes September 10th.

Only skins that you had pay real money for can be gameshared. And by real money I mean nothing paid with ingame currency even if you spent money for currency.

screw it, go big. give jackal's C7E with ACOG to a defender. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

---
My problem with recycling weapons is if you buff/nerf a weapon a recycled weapon, it affects multiple operators.
---
For example if they decide to give Nokk's FMG-9 an acog, they have to give it to smoke too which would make smoke too strong
---
If they though Goyo was too strong and wanted to nerf the Vector, that would also be a direct nerf to mira

Ember Rise comes September 10th.

Hello Roa5teD, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cwku5l/is_this_a_bug_i_keep_having_these_screen/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Quick and short answer, what a guy
---
Hehe
---
This game has so much potential I really want it to just be better, also 250 million dollars a year is not enough for a bigger dev team? Who knows maybe with a bigger dev team and polishing the game more players will come in the player base has been growing.
---
but yet it feels like it's been a while since a new set of weapons.
---
Licensing.
---
They even said that there's not a lot of guns left they can add.
---
While it does suck we don't get new guns, I'm excited for the new gadgets and map rework.
---
do you have a link or a video name?
---
You can place them on the floor
---
Those are the same people who leave after one loss in rank with a squad
---
I feel like the battle pass should just be included into the season pass
---
the battle pass is literally optional
---
PRAISE THE SUN
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if 95% can be purchased with renown. 5% still can‚Äôt be.
---
Yeah, the DLC is free, and that‚Äôs great. The game isn‚Äôt. The season pass isn‚Äôt. The seasonal and limited event skins are not. The elite uniforms are not. Most bundles are not. 
---
Patreon is not cosmetic content. There are tangible benefits to subscribing to Patreon for youtubers, like keeping their YouTube careers viable enough for them to continue. 
---
I have no idea who this guy is, so I have no bone to pick with you for calling him out, but you‚Äôre drawing a comparison between two completely different things.
---
I do this on soft walls
---
If you see the Battle Pass and you don't like what it contains don't buy it.
---
Nobody is forcing you to spend money on cosmetics.

What system are you on where Siege is 80-90 gigs?  It definitely should not be that large.
---
This exact post or this format??
---
that's pulse and thermite
---
True that
---
Good idea üí°
---
Theres no point in activating the glasses as soon as the smoke drops. The duration of the smoke is longer than the glasses.
---
How does this work? You don't have to cut completely around it?
---
Don‚Äôt understand the point of this post
---
Why pulse he has a t-shirt with E=mc2 just like smoke and smoke is bald to only not on his elite
---
So a guy making money off Youtube asking for more money to fund his channel isnt at all similar to a video game making money off a purchase asking for more money to fund its future....ok
---
True
---
I wonder if a hammer to the, face? Would work..
---
Are you holding a Juul?
---
Actually true
---
True, I don't really understand the super hate about it.
---
Lol
---
Buns
---
This post
---
That mentality is sickening and the reason they are getting this greedy. The game is not free 2 play, it should NOT have a battle pass in it.
---
Neato.
---
Is no one questioning the fact that the way the post was worded makes it sound like he thinks the UMP-45 is a good weapon?
---
Nice!
---
That's pulse, smoke had only interest in chemistry not in physics. Pulse Thermite and Hibana are close friends.
---
I like new gadgets aswell but I still thing say the a Danish ops should use Danish weapons
---
it was confirmed a while back that it was pulse, the girl is hibana IIRC. he even has a charm with her name on it
---
It's probably made of a strong material
---
thank you
---
any argument?
---
You realize literally everything you listed is 100% optional with literally no gameplay benefits right? I just think a guy making money on youtube asking for more money for future content isnt too far removed from a video gsme making money asking for more money to support future content
---
This is beautiful
---
I have one of those lol now I have an idea
---
Almost.
---
Wdym? We need to stop those lazy memestealing mf. They are not just stealin shit they also promote stuff and get ez money. Literally scumbags

Stray bullet clips the edge of Frost's hair "are you ok!?" "Yeah I'm fine. What are you doing?" Kapkan holding a pair of scissors and a hairdryer. "Hold still I will fix you up!"
---
Ak&gt;Lmg  Change my Mind
---
Its not a terrible weapon tho, granted not the best obviously but it gets the job done when i play pulse.
---
Have you tried making money of youtube? You get jack shit
---
&gt; also 250 million dollars a year is not enough for a bigger dev team?
---
You'd think so, but not for Ubisoft. 
---
&gt;and polishing the game more players will come in, the player base has been growing.
---
The player base grows because it comes, specifically, for Siege. It's clear Ubisofts vision for Siege is to streamline, simplify and make the game hyper competitive. They view Siege, the same way they do Basketball - Basketball doesn't need to be made into Hockey or Soccer. Just keep it basketball. 
---
This is why they have been doing stuff like removing night time modes from the rotation, slowly and continually phasing out fan favorite but uncompetitive maps, and trying very heavily to focus the Siege community on watching the esports stuff.
---
Oh kinda makes sense but thats why i posted it just to know if i was right and it looked like smoke bc of the formula
---
An ash jager main would take half a mag to shoot a drone.
---
So?
---
Don't pick the easy ops, pick the good ops. You'll get good at them.
---
I literally just described how they are similar but not exactly the same but it all just boils down too, guy making money off Youtube asks for money to support future content is mad at a video game making money asking for more money for future content
---
cant say I'm not a little bias because I'm Ukrainian

Oh no i know i absolutely agree. Im literally playing ranked with OP now. We suprised its being reposted elsewhere. I agree its scummy tho

That goes in the over 90%. Each bundle can be bought using renown and so does every unique skin. Oppose to what? Capitalism? You guys are literally complaining about paid clothes for virtual puppets that don't affect gameplay...
---
Paying for COSMETICS is how Ubi maoes money to keep supporting the game
---
Too close...

I would genuinely prefer a pistol over the ump dude, honestly would probably have a higher dps lol

They can do whatever they please, it's their game.

Also watch Balcony Big Door. Cheeky Bastards can skull tap you from there when you are repeling.

That‚Äôs the only thing I can think of

Thank you!
---
The pass will not have anything that directly influences the gameplay. They said this too. So the pass is literally only for cosmetics and backstory / lore purposes.
---
My pc games are pretty much one of three things:
---
1. Bunch of little kids or immature teens
---
2. Bunch of 20 somethings jerkoffs who only seem to play to do mean things to other people
---
3. A bunch of actual bros playing the game like they should.
---
I wish there was some kind of Toxicity MMR. At the end of a match, as long as you played the full match, you can rate people on your team for toxicity levels, even if they left midway through the match. People who recieve constant bad scores are matched more often with other low scorers. Also, people who just spam bad scores on everyone will quickly have their scores mean nothing to the system and they will basically get shadow banned from the scoring system without anyone knowing.
---
Who had the highest ping is usually the guy that did it. It's a felony, has been for a longtime, technically speaking nothing you can do to prevent to legal action post incident. Really expensive legal team etc etc.

That is the ugliest shit I have ever seen

Wow well done

Did u make these or buy them?
---
file size too big fml
---
Its such a stupid idea to have vote to kick on casual. The place where people dont give a shit, horrible. Csgo does it so much better and has it in ranked play, when someome is kicked it is because they were so detrimental to the team all four players wanted them gone: i only saw it when someone was actively throwing and shooting teammembers throughout the round. Siege should either follow suit, or get rid of vote to kick entirely.

I completely agree, I feel like no matter what though, the vote kick system can't be fixed. You'll get a squad of 4 in ranked and you'll be alone in there. They could vote kick you if they just wanted to play by themselves without that 5th. I just don't see a way to fix it sadly.
---
Capitolism kid, this is how companies stay alive. No one is forcing you to buy it. They already give you free ops and free maps. Grow up
---
You're going very far and finding things to comment on to actively defend this monetization, is Ubi paying you? If so how do i get on that payroll! You literally are sticking up for Ubi when you say you aren't, by defending the layering of further nickle-and-diming of players. You're missing the point, much like the other guy here
---
Nobody has a fucking problem with the fact it's cosmetic, nobody is bitching about pay to win but you're framing it that way because it de-legitimizes their point. The issue is name any game on the planet that has this much monetization, and adds more while people cheer?
---
No other game has the balls to have a seasons pass, battle pass, paid currency, lootboxes, timed exclusive skins (tied to paid currency lootboxes) all in a game that IS NOT FREE TO PLAY. So it's ironic as hell to me that you guys defend this, then claim you don't defend Ubi or these tactics. 
---
Again, you can claim it's about "option and choice" but that's a copout, because the only "choice" is pay or don't. 
---
Christ Warframe is free, and somehow has a better monetization model than this - at least they don't pressure you to buy a seasons and battlepass every year, and you can earn premium currency.
---
People weren't happy with R6 credits or seasons pass, but put up with it. The goal post was pushed. Now that it's accepted, the goal post got pushed again. Once battle pass is accepted, it'll move again and they'll add new monetization. 
---
They'll keep doing this until people get fed up with it. And it's disgraceful that people make excuses for the predatory behavior. I'm just about done here, because not one person can offer anything constructive outside regurgitated "you don't have too" or "it's a choice", as it sounds like mindless collective drivel. I don't at all want to stop you from voicing your thoughts, if anything I encourage the contribution of thought out opinions. But that's not what we're seeing here, what we are seeing is unsubstantiated "shut up quit whining" without any meaningful reason why. I'm at least presenting why I believe the monetization has gone to far, and presented that point with supporting evidence (other layering of monetization models) all I've gotten back is contempt from people who act like this is a poor person problem. 
---
I'm here to have a discussion on monetization in R6, and all I'm getting are bunch of angry children who say shut up and buy it with no considerstion of content-cost ratio, or no care for it. 
---
As a community we need to consider the *value* of the content we are being pressured to pay for. Sure, Ubisoft has been gopd to us for a long time, but they are literally only doing this to capitalize on the largest playerbase they've ever had. 
---
This isn't for the fans or community 
---
They. Want. More. Money.
---
Happy birthday bud

it looked like you hit her in the head but ok

You mean unranked? There is no operator bann in casual.

Because thats what heroes do!
---
This is awful sorry
---
What else needs to be done?
---
Pretty sure you just use the regular one and state you‚Äôre looking for Xbox players.
---
Now you're cherry picking, go read my other replies if you want full context. I'm not replying the same thing 13 times. 
---
Your arguements are degrading to petty "rEtArD" quotes and memes. There's nothing constructive here
---
I got one on bucks rifle

Okay buddy lol maybe back then now he is okay not great or really valuable to a team
---
And then you are going to get melted, dummy.
---
dude this is like the third time you reposted it. if people didn‚Äôt like it the first two times then they‚Äôre not gonna like it anymore the 3rd.
---
But the game is healthy right ?
---
Probably Nvidia Control Panel. Could be that they have digital vibrance cranked to 100.
---
There is absolutely no sane logical reason why you would want to buff something that tanks 2+ headshots in a game revolving around 1 shot headshot.
---
Yeah steam does that, it‚Äôs kinda wack
---
Tell your friend that weapons have no side, even if made in another country. Im from a NATO country and still use AK‚Äôs as primaries.
---
So it makes you happy if somebody throws something infront of your feet so that you can buy it to spend your money?! Gesus...
---
You would be okay to pay for breathable air as well i guess if it would be privatized.
---
Ya I mean, I've had stuff like that happen. It's not as much of a concern to me since I'm only silver 4, but still. It's so annoying. Like do you not have anything better to do?
---
No problem!
---
&gt;Blitz without flash is the same as Recruit/Monty/Fuze in CQB. Is Fuze with shield OP in CQB?
---
The difference is that Blitz runs with his shield, making it much easier for him to circle you and/or melee you before you can even damage him.
---
Cheaters always appear more to the end of the season btw
---
No, everyone screeched about Smoke getting a plague doctor skin for some reason.
---
How long does it takes to do stuff like this ?
---
I‚Äôve had this happen on PC as well. So far it‚Äôs only happened once. I was a bit confused in why they were doing it, though.
---
Toxicity from teammates on console is what stopped me playing. I mainly just watch streams or if I can get a group together I'll play with them. But its not worth to play by myself if there's a greater than 50% chance of being kicked or team killed for no reason.
---
...why?
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
Not that weird tho
---
I think he wants a system where you can mark a player: never play with again. So that after the match, they will never be on your team again
---
I‚Äôm not super familiar with OW systems, there‚Äôs no free way to gain skins besides battle packs/events related to playing in game?
---
Is r/beetlejuicing still applicable to this one...?
---
If you dont agree with our opinion, ignore it. Reddit is a place for praising but for complaining as well.
---
This is not breathable air we‚Äôre talking about. This is an entirely optional addition to the game you don‚Äôt have to take part in.
---
This is not them throwing something at your feet, this is them offering a service and you getting upset because they put a reasonable sized price tag on their hard work.
---
Yes there is a reason his thing is not getting shot in the head or neck it takes 2-3 shots to break for a mediocre pistol for a sub machine gun or ar it takes 1-2 shots even a buff to a hundred would still make him weak or they could buff his gun better ads accuracy or even fire rate
---
It's been an honour
---
Yeah, sorry I typed it angerly and quickly
---
Mozzie is like 4‚Äô11
---
Nope I don‚Äôt really know any tournaments apart from the pro league stuff.
---
Is this in casual? In my 500+ hours I've never had that many people leave in a game of ranked. I'm just hopeful the changes do help that's all.
---
Maybe New People can see it this way?
---
Finally the dark souls season is confirmed
---
This isnt a beach this is a bathtub
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
but that skin doesn‚Äôt have all the cool knick knacks that article 5 has
---
You beat me to it üò°üò°
---
This is why I quit siege because of how unwelcome people most people are.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty awful. I‚Äôve only just really gotten into the game over the last 2 months, and I really only play with 1-2 friends and go incognito. It‚Äôs at least harder to get kicked, though TKs will happen as long as they‚Äôre allowed in-game.
---
I wish it was casual but no it happens in ranked
---
I think that Austrian ops would be cool. I talked about releasing the Austrian Cobra Unit with my friends. My idea was well recieved within my friends.
---
i love how my camo is 300% reflective and glossiness is turned up to max
---
Not a clutch but nice
---
No. We still have ... 834 more to go!
---
You passed it already
---
It‚Äôs called ddos‚Äôing
---
Yeah that's fair
---
If it was only that one game it was more than likely a DDOS.
---
Is the issue that it‚Äôs not showing 144hz in the display settings or that you‚Äôre not hitting 144 FPS in game?
---
Ihihihih xd get cancer
---
But depending on price (no more than 10$ in my opinion would be acceptable) and if it was only for cosmetic items it it could be interesting... but that said we also have weekly challenges that give rewards so I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm really crossed on this idea if it was correctly implemented I could get behind it but I think it‚Äôs better model for free to play games
---
And they say console people are trash üôÑ
---
Oh yeah. Btw. Brett decided to say on Twitch that after my ace I got no more kills.
---
Well, that was false https://img.rookmine.com/190828025741.jpg
---
if the battle pass isn't included in the season pass i'm quitting this game
---
UP = Unofficially Perfect. Duh
---
Happy cake day
---
You get a loot box (3 items) every time you level (same as r6, xp from wins/losses etc), which takes about 1.5-2 hours.  There you can get 5 a week for wins in the arcade mode (mystery hero's, special game modes etc)
---
During events they have event boxes,  every loot box you gain during the even is an event box and can have event skins etc in them vs R6s 1-2 for the event.  You get coins for duplicate items you can use to buy whatever you want. There's nothing locked behind a paywall like 15$ elite skins etc, everything is obtainable from the boxes or the coins.

Didn‚Äôt shoot him just to make everyone and my team mad.
---
If any videogame causes you to rage that much you might want to stop playing because it defeats the purpose of playing games.
---
:)
---
It‚Äôs not about difficulty, seems through his walking, he‚Äôs going full speed each direction, and at hard diagonal angles
---
I mean, personally, I agree that you missed.
---
You missed though by just a tad
---
Tell that to all the people on this sub that do and say they aren‚Äôt cheaters
---
Well games my friend, well games. Tbh this kinda toxicity I expect from a gold 2 lol
---
You did not hit, rainbow has hitboxes where the helmet dosent count
---
Might be off topic but where is your other drone?
---
Yeah you missed
---
Ubisoft: No, I don‚Äôt think *WE* will
---
They said ‚Äúthe latter‚Äù which would mean they‚Äôre referring to theme park.
---
I did find it interesting that they mentioned Bartlett at all
---
Yeah it's a weird attachment choice for the shotgun imo- the Aug is alright with a silencer but Kaids shotgun doesn't have the ammo per magazine to really worry about shooting someone 4 times at mid range
---
Plat 3 I'm trash
---
Maybe less aggressive than Punk, but it holds the artistic value of rebellion or just being as crazy to your hearts content. I might not see any crazy Mohawks with spike cuffs and chokers/collars in Pop Punk, however the same basic wacky tacky style can definetly be seen in both scenes.
---
Please what map I must know
---
His ability definitely needs to be reworked a bit in terms of its user friendliness, even when I have played him and encounter the rare flash bang. The time me seeing the flash bang and actually activating my gadget, it was too late.
---
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called on the TTS right now. Unranked
---
"Theft"
---
Big crime time. Maybe bring your badge next time, sheriff.
---
Yeah....now your open letter makes sense.
---
Which is why nobody in PL uses it either.
---
I knew they were reworking Theme Park. I just found that interesting and curious that Bartlett was mentioned. Only time can tell
---
What do you mean? Is there a free weekend?
---
But still, I don't want to see that while I got my 'no creative tag' filter activated.
---
Ey, klok mi. Loco
---
Think that‚Äôs just lag on your end, I imagine if u watch from their perspective, they didn‚Äôt receive those shots to the face
---
Kafe dostoyevsky
---
Never make these stupid glory holes. What should have been done is a line where you can see the corner. There is a drone hole. Nobody would be able to run up and shoot his feet on the angle without being shot through the hole or drone hole.
---
Kafe
---
I think he would have to work out a shit ton on the keto diet to become 3 speed level. If buff his speed it would be to a level 2. If anything I think people would like another primary option that has an acog.
---
What‚Äôs ur gt we should play also do u live on east coast or somewhere else?
---
I would like to highlight something that I think is wrong in your statement: "The money made will most likely go straight back into siege, funding the development process, helping make the game better in the long term."
---
Ubi is a public company, some of their games are sustainable some aren't.
---
"Rainbow 6" dev team has no control on how much money/share they can re-invest in the development of their project, only CFO(s) and the investor's board can.
---
If the board consider that R6 is an old game (and 4 years it's pretty old) and want more/same amount of money, they will press the game into mass-monetization, reduce the team into a skeleton crew and shift their effort/money into newer and fresher games and slowy let it die.
---
I'm not saying that's what gonna happen, I just think that saying: "the more money R6 make the better it'll become" is wrong is this context.
---
Your aim may be bad, theirs is definitely worse. Good one, GG!
---
They did that voice line before he even got released. He had 1 rifle shield that CANNOT be broken. Your only option back then was to aim at his body or kill him from behind.
---
Why are you thanking me when your just bringing a problem that isn‚Äôt needed for this sub? It‚Äôs just a post that helps no one because no one is that stupid...to fall for something like that.
---
Free week, 28th to the 3rd
---
WOW HOW BROKE
---
There is!
---
Glad we could be of service
---
That's why I said "most likely" not "certainly"
---
{-}7
---
Praise the lord
---
Yeah, I can't go a single game without maybe 1 rubber band moment, ping apode to 300, packet loss and loss connection icons in the corner of the screen.... Only with this game.
---
Yo could u carry me to gold or plat before the end of season üòÇ im silver 1
---
but people often spray into smoke anyways
---
I don‚Äôt know who that is, but yeah. Timer starts after prep phase finishes.
---
September 10th, people may say 3rd possibly but it's definitely the 10th
---
Oh cool.
---
&gt;The Free Week will be available to Xbox Live Gold users. To join in on your Xbox One, visit the Rainbow Six Siege product page on the Xbox Store.
---
(from the ubi page)
---
It's just copying pro league. 
---
Imo, I'm ok with it for ranked....but I wish unranked (not casual, the new mode) went back and forth
---
Ubi: No. Here. Have a battlepass
---
Depends. Now that unbanked is coming out, casual should be be less sweaty. That said, I don‚Äôt think myself or anyone else will hold to 100% consistency and I definitely swear in casual sometimes.
---
Nice diversion
---
nanomachines son.
---
I also fuck around with my friends like you do, but I'm not going to complain about something so insignificantly stupid. Play the game, have fun, fuck around. If you get RFF too fucking bad.
---
Oh I'm so close to the promised land then woo
---
Yeah i lost interest in the online of this game because of that.
---
So i stick to For Honor, at least i know that style of douchebaggery and they cant just votekick like a bunch of cunts.
---
no there is not.
---
Lag on my end I have a 9 ping every game. I'm hardwired in
---
Ahh thank you so much! That's so kind :)‚ô°
---
I think the camera man had a crush because she was the main event that night lol
---
Help me out here, I haven‚Äôt heard of this new mode, what the hell is it?
---
R6 is on Epic too? The more you know...
---
Epic
---
Or maybe *being Warden*
---
I have one of these Vinyl figures. Idk if they're still available and they're quite fragile, but they look really awesome. 
---
Just search for Rainbow Six Siege Collection Figures. Maybe you can find out which operator the person likes and gift the according one
---
üëÅüëÖüëÅ
---
I would actually like a rework. The map was bad, but the setting of an university is so good in my opinion
---
One shot to the body and one to the neck. There was no headshot
---
MOZZIE
---
I hate the battlepass too but Siege is always $20 or less only the special editions reaches $60
---
What
---
Or maybe that it recharges faster and useable like Vigil‚Äôs ERC-7 or Cav‚Äôs Silent Step
---
They should do 2-3-1-random kind of like a modified basketball best of 7.
---
Ok I don't get copying pro league either. 99 percent of us aren't gonna be pros. That being said don't they play a higher round count ?
---
?
---
Thats fucking scum as, how bad could someone be to ddos in a low ranked game
---
Finally i can get out of copper after being placed in gold 1 because all i play against is platinums
---
If you look under community options in the sidebar you can put whatever dumb text you want in there, then you can pick whatever operator chibi/icons you want too !
---
How many clips can we send?
---
What's the reason to remove maps for rework? Why not keep them in casual?
---
Map is not a phone what should be taken from your for repairing.
---
Thx, do you have some clips? :)
---
Issue is too long of queue times partly
---
As much as you want
---
cz he has no brain
---
I was gonna say that but I thought it was too soon
---
Then you use the mute function. It's very useful
---
It doesn‚Äôt improve squat. 
---
People who want a specific app to play are rewarded for NOT going AFK and selecting their Op. 
---
So why should someone who‚Äôs AFK get the same ‚Äúrewards‚Äù as someone who‚Äôs sticking around for the entire match?
---
I hate getting Ops like Dokk and Hibana but I‚Äôve gotten better with the SMG-12 and Bearing-9 because I was AFK for multiple reasons. So why should I get Buck or Zofia if I‚Äôm AFK?
---
And people thought he was OP before üòÇ
---
Oof ok, could I just send my video link of my clips on youtube over private message, and you maybe just choose which ones you want to use? Then i can send the individual clip for you.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt make sense, as the elite skins are supposed to reference something in their past, the only one that would make sense would be his current outfit, but for an MVP animation, him driving in recklessly on an ATV was would make sense
---
 Nah
---
This has only been posted about 1000 times, but thank you, very cool.
---
Good job!
---
Maverick new elite skin ????
---
Yeah, you should increase your FOV and you will immediately became gold
---
Ok! Than tell me which social do you want to be credited with
---
Honestly, I would tend to gravitate towards ops that have a passive gadget and decent weapons, like Kapkan or Frost on defense. Such ops for attack would be Finka or Jackal. "passive" on attack is a loose term. It's more along the lines of gadgets that help your team as a whole more than yourself. 
---
Once you get better with passives ops, then you can move towards ops with more direct gadgets and decent guns. On defense, those ops would be ones like Ela or or Doc. On attack, those would be ones like Ash or Blitz.
---
It really just depends on your style of play. I am a very ambush-y and tactical player so my Defensive mains are usually Ela and Valkyrie while my attacking mains are typically IQ and Buck.
---
May I request montagne?
---
I'll be honest, I'll still play Rainbow Six, but I won't support further monetization outside the seasons pass, as I have since I started playing. And if i ever feel so generous, maybe, I'll buy an Elite skin. But none of this expanded paywall for me
---
That's not good.
---
Imagine next season when house and other maps will return but some good (from your point of view) will be removed. House and other will appear more frequently!
---
It‚Äôs not teamkilling, it‚Äôs tactical opening of the wall that has the enemies behind it
---
This could serve two purposes:
---
1) keep things in casual a little more fresh/varied
---
2) make learning the maps a little easier for new players
---
this is exactly why i don't play MOBAs, why bother to learn a game where people are assholes no matter what?
---
The only time I saw that symbol displayed was on the final kill of the round.
---
Can you post a link to the sound visualizer?
---
Hey this was well played, but to perform better and more consistently like this, I would up your sensitivity some
---
&gt;You were petty condescending to that guy
---
&gt;
---
&gt;‚ÄúIt was rather obvious.‚Äù
---
&gt;Newsflash, adding a period makes you sound like a douche
---
Uh....no? If I assert the obviousness of something obvious that makes me a douche? I'd like to speak to the wise man who came up with that nonsense.
---
If he finds that condescending when nothing such was ever meant of intended, then that is not under my control. Like I said, I don't now him enough to condescend him.
---
&gt;Also side note it‚Äôs not even to save data. The old Hereford is still in the fucking situations, two of them in fact
---
Getting changed this season.
---
What are you even talking about? Right now it's:
---
Att-Att-Att-Def-Def*-Def* and then it for the 7th it randomly assigns Attack or Defend and alternates from there.
---
All I'm changing is:
---
Att-Att-Def-Def-Def*-Att*
---
I moved one round from position 3 to position 6 so each side is guaranteed two rounds per side. That's literally it.
---
Sweet, I sent you the video link and the link to my youtube channel for credit. Cheers.
---
you are more than capable of going on a discord and finding 4 other players. its really not difficult
---
I got an idea how about dwayne the nokk jhonson
---
Both fucking sucked, they were unbalanced as hell.
---
Data limits.
---
And it sucks because I am a huge fan of charms, and I love a lot of the ranked charms, and really excited for the ember rise charms because they look really good
---
If yall are playing on xbox, mind if I join?
---

---
Also good, if you're looking for others besides The Rock you could do Mozzie Osbourne. I'm just brainstorming here
---
&gt;So why should I get Buck or Zofia if I‚Äôm AFK?
---
So that the team you're playing with doesn't get anchored down with a crappy operator you barely use. If being AFK alone wasn't bad enough for the entire team already, getting a bad operator randomly picked makes it worse. I guess if you really want to punish yourself for being AFK, don't make a preference list.
---
Maybe
---
They stated point two in the patch notes I believe
---
Mira and Kaid have low pick rates?
---
But that effort is not put towards the game. It's used in selling us a fucking battle pass.
---
Cheers for the advice :)
---
Ubi gimme back my house
---
I agree I was a bit confused myself..
---
I'd be interested but fair warning I am by no means good
---
I say as a level 83 casual leave casual with most maps, casual is for fucking around and getting kicked, I don't want to be forced to play custom to play the maps I want to, also my favorite maps are getting kicked out for a while so that sucks.
---
That‚Äôs ok pm me your ubi name
---
Taking away more maps from casual  again. Go die of cancer and stop fucking with the game already.
---
This is just a poor attempt to mimic content updates, to draw in players with monthly "content changes/updates".
---
And on top of that, you also refuse to put Bartlett U. back in casual rotation despite the horrendous maps known as Favela/Yacht/Tower being allowed in Casual.  
---
Oh, and new maps are still added straight into Ranked despite largely being disliked and untested, with NuHereford/Foretress/Tower being the prime examples.
---
Glad too see you continuing to double down on terrible ideas and practices. Really gives me hope for the future of this game/s
---
Totally agree.
---
No new guns and maps is bad but ok.
---
But removing maps and modes (I mean night maps) from casual! That's nonsense.
---
Repost
---
Some assholes kick the last Guy becuse thier little adhd retard body can't wait. And yes that is why people get kicked becuse the people kicking you don't want to wait.  And sometimes people get kicked for clutching a 1v5 becuse aprently they are "sweating top much and should just play the game". Hopefully you understand this shitty explanation
---
I think you're over thinking this.
---
Yup
---
I wish
---
Nobody likes toxicity but if you say you've never been toxic your not fooling anyone, everyone that's played this game has been toxic, it's practically inevitable when you play this game. 
---
And yes, toxicity is more common on PS4 than pc since ppl on console have a controller to aim with and potato 24/7. Being above lvl 100 on both platforms I can confirm that.
---
I've switched from xbox to pc recently and except for the occasional "diamond sweating in casual" thing I actually have alot more fun, the people on mic can be toxic but sometimes people are toxic in a fun way and the text chat is the funniest thing sometimes now whenever i try to play on xbox it's always toxic messages, tk's, and kicks so idk if I'll ever be able to play on console anymore
---
Don‚Äôt focus on getting kills, focus on the objective and winning the game, then kills will just come with it.
---
I play on pc and I actully get kicked a lut. But I have heard its hell on console.
---
I cant say that I'm bummed out with the lack of Tower.
---
No, because then you still have to reload, and if someone is waiting behind it you are dead.
---
So max 6-7 rounds.
---
You're like 2h to late for me, I played on two accounts simultaneously to get this challenge lol
---
Maaan, House and Plane are really fun maps to just fuck around in I don't get why they'd be gone, Tower is a personal favorite of mine but I understand why people may not like it all that much.
---
Favela's a bit of a clusterfuck and people who know what  they're doing will bully the newbies wich can get annoying so out of all 4 I can kinda understand Favela but I still think Casual should have all the maps available
---
I kid you not, bruv. I've read this in a couple of places.
---
As long as you have a mic you can make friends
---
Switch to pc like I did
---
Me and my step brother have played at the same time, but I use PC and he uses an Xbox
---
repost
---
OP was referencing that post.
---
It was mentioned because it's a special case, since the map is terrible
---
No I'm not "the people" who do that
---
well i don't have a second acc
---
Why the fuck is Solaire dead in the middle lmao
---
If an enemy runs into a corner you can keep firing as you slowly turn the corner, ez kills
---
Looks like we have some miserable losers who hate new players downvoting you.
---
I am sorry buddy . But internet points aren't in your favor today
---
[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cthiuu/proleague_hot_breach/)
---
Delete this quick before this subreddit bashes you and downvotes you to hell
---
I've been playing a bit on pc lately and I was surprised when my team didn't shoot me or vote to kick me when I picked the new ops on the TTS, I've run into a few toxic games but solo queuing isn't a nightmare
---
Still need a friend?
---
Thats a Good choice, but I think maybe highlight weapons that don‚Äôt get used enough because the op has various options. The Sig is always picked over the Shotgun.
---
I made the switch last year, haven‚Äôt looked back since. Console is just, hell; but much worse.
---
Yeah that's what I've experienced
---
I like the bb who tried to climb in. ‚ÄúIn your minds eye Blackbeard- how did you really see that going?‚Äù
---
Wholsome
---
Oh oof, i'm sorry you get kicked a lot :( I try to play with at least 1 other friend so we can prevent that should it happen. Console sounds awful, though
---
It was on Oregon and when I went to swing into a window I hit a lag spike and got stuck in the roof, I was able to walk around in the roof and see everyone below it was similar to how the spectator views a pro league match when the are in the over view mode, however it was in first person, I couldn‚Äôt shoot anyone or plant the defuser though
---
I don‚Äôt typically spray if I‚Äôm peeking or holding an angle I just burst fire it. I spray when I‚Äôm startled tbh
---
Hey did you manage to buy credits?
---
Kinda confused how Ubi expects us to spend cash when they aren't allowing us to do so.
---
Bruh some times you just gotta shit no hate
---
Look good
---
I'm curious though  did you move to pc because of the community or because of keyboard and mouse?  Because I'm really enjoying how good the game feels on pc
---
And the Smoke/mute smg 11+ shotgun combo is amazing on pc
---
The reason why I play with a full team squad, god the game is so much better this way
---
Where did you buy the parts needed
---
Goodbye Yacht!
---
Hey is it still working for you? I'm in India and can't seem to buy it.
---
I'm having this exact issue. Everytime I launch r6 it closes my wallpaper engine, lgs, and sometimes even discord. I'm about to stop playing until someone finds a solution.
---
No new guns and maps isnt that bad, new maps would be nice but i'd rather they keep improving their current pool there's so many maps already and they havent had good luck creating new maps that have a good flow to them in a while.
---
No new guns is awesome for anyone thats been playing for a while, all these skins i have carry over, and there's only so much variance between guns anyways.
---
Nae naed
---
I moved because of keyboard and mouse. Decided I wanted to learn it. The community is just a bonus
---
DAFACK
---
why would you repost something that was just on the front page
---
There is a degradation in Xbox servers https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1166792506974994432
---
There is no link. It's a thing made by a famous r6 youtuber called Bozon Bunch
---
are you on console?
---
https://support.ubi.com/en-US
---
The worst is when you start reinforcing and a Vigil blows your head off for no reason.
---
I‚Äôm calling the media on this guy.
---
Capitao is more fun IMO but they‚Äôre both excellent operators.
---
Ddosed?
---
oh yeah lol another sick burn. Memes are against the sub rules. not my fault people can't read them before commenting and posting. you should try it sometime
---
Yeah unfortunately. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not an issue on pc, but i can‚Äôt switch to pc until next year :/
---
 Did you see the blood splatter tho
---
I actually found that since placing in this competitive season that‚Äôs changed a lot. It feels much better as you are ranked based on how much you contribute to the team as that player type.
---
This means that you start getting put with people that actually do their job properly.
---
If you're on console do not join any party's that's how they pull your ip. Unless the're ddos'ing the server
---
what is ctu
---
Fucking Toxic waste of a human I call them
---
what is iirc
---
Xbone.
---
They basically lag the entire server to where you‚Äôre stuck in place and can‚Äôt do anything, it usually happens when you‚Äôre on attack so the timer runs out and you lose
---
yeah i think so but i couldn‚Äôt find any sources about it
---
Ok I'll do that
---
sweet as
---
Funny, i play on XBone as well and it feels a lot brighter to me, might just be my tv though
---
There are dozens of us who like Favela, I swear! Dozens!
---
What did he say
---
Me nor my friends joined any parties, when we saw their usernames we suspected they were ddosers, they lagged the entire server I believe, we were all in a party.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm at the ‚Äúrecommended ‚Äú, but I‚Äôll probably bump it up.
---
They took a terrible map and make it terrible .. in another way
---
Mozzie should be the Penguin.
---
try reading the patch notes buddy
---
That would be really nice, but there are *rumours* that R6S's workforce was divided for projects such as Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Rainbow Six Quarantine.
---
The past two seasons' unexpected recycled contents *kinda* confirmed those rumours, so I wouldn't have my hopes up.
---
"so this is the power of ultra instinct"
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
How do you download said app
---
This is also happening a lot lately to my friends and me
---
It doesn‚Äôt work that way dude
---
this isn't Ubisoft support. send it there.
---
It‚Äôs good
---
Damn.
---
Even on this post that has a glimpse of twitch. You still find it. Its not like this post is popular too. It has 14 upvotes.
---
Heh, nerd. Nice one
---
I'll admit, it was tough to master. I have practiced this technique on 1 speeds. But a 3 speed? I truly summoned all my power that day
---
I didn‚Äôt think it needed one, same as Hereford.
---
I honestly hope it‚Äôs just a thing that dies out soon, ranked is unplayable in higher ranks
---
If I recall correctly
---
Did I hear Yumi?
---
After that u got a warm bath??
---
What platform, if they ddos the server i suggest learning to do it yourself, that way you can do so against them so no one wins. If the guys ddosing u was called "Hiii get booted" ill ddos him for you. Idk if he does it in ranked
---
i do it every season right away depends on your skill to make your team win
---
Just saw the picture of your case, It looks great!
---
Yeah I was kind of annoyed by it actually because I kept thinking if I was a girl and I wanted to go to event having 100% chance to be singled out from the audience... well I would find it uncomfortable.
---
And I get that the intentions might have been good, showing that there are female esports fans and all that, but they overdid it if so and if anything the message became the opposite: look at this guys! A grill gamer in the audience omg can you believe it!
---
Lol or when you blow a hole in a wall with impacts and then someone promptly reinforces it üòÇ
---
Unfortunately Skyscraper will still be in ranked next season. I still don't understand the logic of removing maps that are at least playable from ranked but keeping the two oldest and least playable maps in.
---
.....smoke isn't a 3 speed
---
Precisely and then put it in ranked
---
Already read them they just need to hurry up
---
He either hit his neck or there was some client side lag involved
---
yea you should its 2019 you cant just assume things
---
thx
---
Big oof
---
WHAT?!?
---
I like playing shit maps in Casual. Just for fun and all those shit strats and run outs that don‚Äôt work on good maps. 
---
Plane is the only map that you can lose the entire round from spawning at any spawn point. That‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs like DMRs and Glaz against ACOG Defenders.
---
Mixes it up a bit, you know? It‚Äôs Casual after all.
---
I like the new modern Setting... but you are right there are maps like Favela or Tower which have too been fixed, Kanal wasn't that broke...
---
Why are brainlet redditors so obsessed with giving everyone ACOGs?
---
Idk, I don't necessarily think Bartlett was that far from being good. Once you got inside the building, the layout wasn't terrible and allowed for a lot of flexibility. The big issue was getting in. If you didn't get spawn peaked on your 100 meter dash in the open you had like 2 viable entry points no matter where the objective was.
---
Skyscraper and Chalet need much more work to be brought up to a good competitive level imo.
---
so you read the patch notes and saw that the new season comes out in like a week and a half and still thought you needed to post this? so basically this post is pointless
---
Wait what happened to the claymor.. it just disappeared
---
Club house spawn peak has now been over ruled
---
There's a difference between "a shooter that players compete in" and "a competitive shooter", in the genre sense. The former is more about fun. The latter, more about winning.
---
To me it was pretty cool, stop being a snob
---
Nokk is basically useless sadly, her ability isn't that good and the fact she lacks an acog and is only a 2 speed makes her not even that useful as a flanker
---
nomad you can cover many flanks with her and it‚Äôs more noticeable if they do trigger your trap
---
I enjoy her smg on her more than on smoke. And I love the [vortex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cuzz0k/vortex_holo_favorite_sight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) holo.

Zofia, she does everything except hard breach

Thanks a lot! as my first video It wasn't going to be perfect but that praise feels really nice!  I aspire to be able to call myself a 'Professional video editor' one day! So the main problems were the millionaire intro and subtitles?

I don‚Äôt wanna be a killjoy but the iron cross is a nazi symbol

finish your kills if you got time left

Just so you know 
---
- siege is hella toxic
---
- siege esports sisnt like siege comp
---
I'd rather have "garbage" teammates rather than one as toxic as ***you***
---
What the actual fuck lol. Lag or totally broken game (not surprised).
---
So you want to punish people for playing with others they're good with? Idiot
---
Wait where‚Äôs n√∏kk I can‚Äôt see her

Happy cake day!

That's the hole point of the  marksman rifles low time to kill but short magazine as well

All this rotation does is potentially increase the crappy maps you can play in casual while decreasing the chance of playing an actual good map in casual. I wish we had map preferences or a voting system in casual so my party didn‚Äôt have to leave every single House, Yacht, Plane, Favela game.

Ok silver 5 calm down there
---
Hm, maybe i do have a med condition, because after I take a few sips of my Dr.Pepper or my juicy monster I usually end up having to go right away. But as for coffee it doesn't really do that to me.

&gt;They may not get back until prep phase is over. Depending on the operator that can be extremely detrimental. Jager for example since he takes the longest to get his utility down. But it's extremely useful utility. Bandit would be another since his batteries are generally needed early.
---
Okay yeah I see what you mean. I usually make sure I hurry the fuck up or finish placing kapkan traps before I leave. I usually get pissed when I have an afk mute or bandit on the team so I can definitely see where you're coming from in term of abuse.

Not giving comms all game isn't toxic though?
---
Haha yes I‚Äôm not the only mad N√∏kk cosplayer who plans to do this, though the outcome is less spooky than I envisioned. More of a ‚ÄúMom pick me up I‚Äôm cold‚Äù appeal.

My hope is that people who play like that and kick people for being the last man standing are also sending too many toxic reports and therefore have their privileges revoked. That being said, the algorithm could also use data from the match to determine the likelyhood someone was voted toxic simply because they were last man standing. Either that or maybe just add a clause where "people who are kicked while they are the last man standing are immune to negative toxicitt reports". There are definitely ways to avoid too much abuse of the system while overall improving gameplay for people who actually want to communicate and have fun.

No no no.  it should work as a combination of ying and glaz.  Auto adjusting for flash and stand still or slow walking to see through smoke.

Bro this guy just goes to random game pages and tries to defend the game every time. Don‚Äôt waste your time, this piece of shit truly has no life.

Yes!

Will your idea also allow the charge to be thrown onto destructible ceilings? This way the charges pop out of the floor above.
