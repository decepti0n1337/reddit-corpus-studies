Yeah because it‚Äôs just a game and it‚Äôs humorous which is good for my mental health

I just got that yesterday!

Eyyy, 69 upvotes *nice

Oh oh if this is console then he would've been fine, props to op though, I was pretty high but I thought he was using a mouse.

‚ÄúEcho can‚Äôt help me where I‚Äôm going‚Äù

---
I love that line
---
Hibana is the best
---
Makes me curious as to what they're doing. Maybe a future event next or something? Or the next season's op like wraith from apex?
---
I had to downvote for the memes
---
Honestly this gamemode is probably the last one that should stick around. It's just a 3v3.
---
Anyone have a glitch where all their weapon attachments are gone?
---
It‚Äôs not childish though, you don‚Äôt have to sweat the game 24/7 to have fun
---
I was dicking around with my friends, almost all of us do it. It‚Äôs not like I was TK‚Äôing randoms.
---
Still not as annoying as seeing basically the same clip 10 times in a row ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Simply said it's when that 1 guy sends a lot of packages with a lot of devices to the server you're playing on so you're game will lag incredibly hard you can't even move

I‚Äôm pretty sure go4 is on all platforms lol no need to start another dick measuring contest between other neck beards (all the virgins ‚Äúpc master race‚Äù )

My stoned co-worker that I'm teaching on the job, but just keep telling him how the bosses are awful

Fair enough I did think about this after posting, but figured that if the existing inconsistency caused by debris and bodies is acceptable then this wouldn't be as drastic. 
---
Then again it would make callouts while spectating a little difficult. So I'm inclined to agree. Thanks you commenting.
---
Okay but is anyone having issues after entering a discovery match where all your attachments get removed from your guns and all skins for your guns and ops??!
---
Is this a PC problem ? Maybe I just havent noticed on console ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
only pc i think, google said only pc too.
---
Outbreak was a bit of a special case as it was basically testing the waters for Quarantine, but yeah I'd love to play that, at least as a Quarantine demo
---
But it used to be on all platforms, what happened?
---
Console problem but it‚Äôs pretty rare unless you‚Äôre in the higher diamond ranks. Never experienced it myself.
---
No my friend you seem to be the stupid one in this scenarioüóø
---
oh dude thats like so funny  hahahahaahaha
---
i dont get it
---
For right now it‚Äôd be mostly casual and then I‚Äôd hope to move into ranked
---
Just noticed right now as well. Sucks
---
Same thing except they just vote me out of the match instantly. I hate the community that plays this game 99% of the time
---
You sound like a 40 year old virgin, I bet you‚Äôre fun to be around.
---
Never seen this before, thank you so much
---
Twitch's hand...

So basically stickers?

Added

oh ok thx for tolerating my retardedness
---
They should just release a game modes every  week, like ones already released just to mix it up.. now and then release new ones
---
True, I've been trying to figure out what n.j.t means and I got nothing
---
Say my name.
---
"it's MY son's turn on the Xbox!"
---
If I presume you use a controller, the Go4 will be full of hyper-aggressive sweaty 3-speed using mouse and keyboard players who abuse the system by having an immediate handicap. 
---
If you use a mouse and keyboard, then you stand a chance. Not that anyone would take you seriously or that it is any mean feet of accomplishment as your playing with an immediate advantage unless against all the other cocks using them. 
---
Whichever one you fall into, good luck. Personally, I see no worth. No reward in playing it as nothing valuable comes from it, even if you win lol. If you wanna play it, feel free. If you lose, don‚Äôt beat yourself up though (unless you use M+K,  otherwise you should feel ashamed)
---
It‚Äôs high noon...
---
Teammate: heya mute could you do something for me?
---
Mute: drones?...
---
Teammate: well actually we need help killing the attack-

*mute has left the game*

Potential thief: Ever been robbed?

Banker: *proceeds to enthusiastically tell entire life story*

Time to start traveling with your console, just to be safe

So unbelievably frustrating. Sorry man

what the fuck, really?

*boah*

you spelled fuze weird

It's omay. Thanks for pointing out that I'm bad at highlighting things

I love the reflection ü§£ü§£ü§£

Capitao looks like he's straight out of Pineapple Express. I died laughing when I first  saw Rooks new helmet and armor and this is a perfect representation a
---
I'm on PS4
---
Its funny when you kill someone with his turret
---
Sorry
---
3v3 fast paced and defender can go outside
---
Biggest shit attempt to sell expensive seasonal skins I have ever seen. The skins are absolute basic level trash except like 3. Game mode is playable on any map just use a revolver. Very disappointed.
---
Yes I love recruit! One less reinforcement, no ability, and no sights! Recruit is clearly the best operator in the game! 
---
Sorry son, recruit is not a good op.
---
Yes
---
When you forget to eat lunch.... Then you see your gun
---
No?
---
Yes!
---
It was sarcasm but ok...
---
Love the continuity with the your percentages. Also thats fair.
---
damn, someone had to post it on reddit, spot ruined.
---
Jackel has a better gun and his gadget is good
---
If you shot behind the bar chair you can prone under it, tag me if you use this spot.
---
Where is this support page?
---
Found the Doc who spawn kills.. üëÜ
---
Yes pc
---
I know he‚Äôs just fun to mess with and meme
---
Spawnpeekings not bad downvote me all you want but you know it‚Äôs true
---
What mental deficiency do you have sir?
---
My username is OLD\_FART1, (weird name ik it's a cracked account) Ubi support refuses to give me actual evidence that I've violated their Code of Conduct to the point of perm banning, all they say is the same as the game message "Multiple Toxicity Offenses"
---
Never said she was a anchor. Actually very much have argued against that. Ela compared to every other operator of her class does the jobs she can do but so much better. The scorpion in no way is strong. 2nd lowest damage in game, at its fall off range which is a standard for most smgs and carbines not just hers the damage dealt is pathetic. It's also the only gun in game given a random stat which already makes it the worst by itself but combined with the others it's a no brainer. The shotgun is a better weapon automatically because it's the only way Ela can soft breech. It has much more utility than the scorpion. Deals more damage up until 20m. Has a set recoil pattern. People play Vigil as he's more or less a flanker. He's very good for flanking the enemy and getting behind them like Cav as well. Doc is chosen as he has a strong weapon kit, good secondary and gadgets. As well as team ability that helps him and everyone else. Not just for fragging. Open up your mind will you?
---
As someone who doesnt speak Arabic I am physically incapable of not relating to this joke.
---
Eh it looks like an Ed Hardy shirt on a nice gun
---
Hope to see you then
---
You‚Äôre*
---
Time to get serious
---
Yeah, it would be cool to go out and throw a flash and see maybe all the colors in a lil firework or something like that!
---
Most guns are automatic so it‚Äôs pretty useless, I bullet vs the next 9 coming at you
---
N-nothing.
---
I usually rush them and melee until the shield goes down then I spray them down with my gun, shotguns help too if you‚Äôre good at aiming around the leg and shoulders too. Or the good old C4 sometimes helps
---
Btw, one of the guys wasnt very friendly
---
Same here
---
I‚Äôll try to consider this in matches!
---
Then all of your friends would have to download it for it to work
---
This is nothing new
---
I feel your pain it happened today
---
As far as i have heard on reddit i m surprised it took that long to start happening to you
---
Probably just get cosmetic items for the American ops though, I‚Äôd like to see a thermite BBq outfit or something though your idea is v cool
---
Ghost
---
Because EA's microtransactions for battlefront 2 weren't strictly cosmetic and actually gave an in-game advantage. Not really worth it to cry over not being able to buy packs you want.
---
Banned
---
Thats cool do moar
---
Forgot to link creator Korezky on Deviant Art
---
I have a feeling you're dissing CoJ. I'm going to decline said diss, because Gunslinger was **the** shit.
---
Why did I get downvoted so much lol
---
Bandit elite is one of my favorites. I bought it as soon as it came out.
---
Do you happen to know that the net is for?
---
Kaptagne
---
You are in serious denial my friend. Ela has changed, move on.
---
You say high levels but that's barely more than meta abuse, and the way you worded your posts seemed to say that they encourage this kind of gameplay, but to me it looks like they are trying to bring Siege back to less of that. Funny that you bring up Lion, as well, since he, Dokkaebi, and Finka (global operators) are seeming to be a big problem contributing to that run and gun style right now.
---
Not as amazing as three claico Jack's in a row for capitao
---
and me
---
My favorites are definitely Thatcher, Blitz, and Bandit
---
It was still a lucky ass shot, non of the less
---
?
---
He‚Äôll always be my favorite.
---
Lion isn‚Äôt nearly as strong, Jackal is banned nearly every match for some reason, mozzie is very strong so watch out, blitz can only flash every 7 ish seconds now
---
Warden
---
Thanks for the help! I guess I‚Äôll wait till the end of the season!
---
Just restart your game
---
I haven't play the new rainbow update yet why does alibi have a revolver and bosg

The recruits are perfect for the Graveltop Gang. Too bad I'm worm food everytime
---
We just need a Conga Line of recruits going through a convention
---
lol
---
Just because you don't like one person on your team doesn't mean you should immediately throw the game.
---
It's glitch because of showdown
---
It‚Äôs good because it easier to hide in the shadows.
---
You clearly don't know the Rule 34.
---
Thanks a ton! Have a whole Year designed on my account if you‚Äôre interested!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ

how do I not trigger this again then
---
Wtf is that spin? I haven‚Äôt had that done to me yet.

Don't play showdown , no tbh I have no clue

that sucks. i wish him well!

Yeah I won‚Äôt @ you but I‚Äôll u/ you üò§üò§
---
2 ez
---
Nice bathroom bruv
---
O i mean its been out for 1 day xd and i just play rank so lol
---
This is why clash should have never been added to the game in the first place
---
It‚Äôs a 1 tap. It‚Äôs decent for Xbox.
---
It should be disabled unless the player in question has:
---
-Been AFK for a certain amount of time
---
-Has a RFF charge
---
Never
---
my totally crazy unbelievable theory:  
---
ubisoft doesn't want you to like the default free recruit. they want you to shell out cash for paid cosmetic content and not be satisfied with what you already have
---
Lots of extra watch batteries to power his glasses that he'll use once every 10 matches
---
Restart your game
---
Blue Red and White
---
Art stealing fuck
---
Marry her
---
Terrorist Hunt. Play a lot of this solo to learn maps and for aim practice. 
---
Check out VarsityGaming on YouTube, he has a good series called ‚ÄúSiege School‚Äù. 
---
Lastly, just laugh off your friends. You‚Äôll get better. Siege has a steep learning curve but you‚Äôll get better eventually.
---
I'm trash as well. I think besides the obvious is just learning the map layouts and what tactics work lol
---
first you need to get your sensitivity down then play THunt to improve your aim, winning gunfights are necessary to win rounds. play the game over and over again and improve game sense, watch ‚Äúsiege school‚Äù videos by VarsityGaming, watch pro players, lean to be patient and when to push and objective/enemy. finally, coordination is very important so always set up a plan with your friends on how to push/defend a site.
---
#F
---
Thanks man
---
I mean with no tk
---
Because I do. There doesn't need to be a reason for that. When I play a tactic shooter I want to feel like I am playing some elite police unit. I don't want to feel like I am playing some kindergardeners who escaped from a costume party where one is a pink unicorn, another wanted to play cowboy and the third one gives no fucks with a top hat.
---
Also it kinda does affect the gameplay. A pink unicorn for example makes for really bad camouflage. And despite that it's about the atmosphere and believability a game creates.
---
I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
@
---
Someone give this op an award for origenal title!
---
Start with normal
---
It's more like saying a photographer with a dslr camera is better than one with a Nokia flip phone. Sure the skills transfer over and the guy with the Nokia probably knows a few tricks but the dslr is always going to be better unless the dslr guy is a complete noob
---
Man listen I just wanna play with my friends I don't even care about rank. It's literally just about fun for me.
---
I saw this meme on r/2mirl4mirl the other day. Quite proud of how large the community is now.
---
Stanley Hudson
---
Im glad im not the only one doing this. You only need one other vote to kick the non recruits lmfao.
---
Bro as a montage main I would love this
---
Boosted Diamonds are far worse. Had a funny plat3 lad tho yesterday, thinking about uploading the conversation. So much salt and arrogance.
---
Bitch cafe didn‚Äôt need a rework glaz can see you‚Äôre footsteps for up to 90 seconds that‚Äôs half the round and on console smg11 is not that viable    And there was no reason to take recruit from ranked
---
Attackers with grenade  in the **SHOWDOWN**
---
On pc you don‚Äôt even need to hit the servers just type in chat
---
Absolutely ..unless one day you face this monty god, who will ace your whole team lol
---
Yeefense = defense
---
Hawfense = attack?
---
Really well done
---
Is that anomaly
---
Yeah i also played Secure in ranked.
---
But Bomb is not to bad.
---
I think they switched it because the Maps where balanced for Bomb or something along those lines.
---
Then by all means go play with your friends even if that means you have to drop ranks. Or yet go play casual where rank has no meaning. Theres a lot people who are playing ranked ‚Äúcompetitively‚Äù to win and boosting accounts is just another part of the ranking system that needs to be fixed
---
Heres how you tell a skin is good in rainbow 6 siege 
---
1. The more bubblegum the skin is the higher its value 
---
The lesion packing gun skin is one of the highest valued skin in my opinion
---
Old hibana kreygasm
---
Oh god, no. I dread facing him. I always fuck up my nitro throws and get backed into a corner.
---
Now that clash is out, I have an unbreakable shield ;)
---
I have been playing since year one never happened. Lol üòÇ I was just very curious
---
Montkan
---
You‚Äôre very lucky lol
---
I'm still going to end up going through the five stages of grief.
---
If you aren't doing well as montagne, the problem isn't the operator or that there's too much counterplay. The only shield op that could be considered bad is clash, and even then she's still frustrating to play against. It seems like there are a lot of counters because the defenders have to use at least 2 of echo, lesion, smoke, or c4 just to kill you while your team rolls them, or they focus on your team and you kill all of them. There is really not much, if any, effective counter to a Monty in a coordinated team.
---
Hard breaches? Bandit &gt; Thatcher &gt; tricking &gt; vertical play/capitao
---
Mira? Twitch &gt; mute &gt; capitao/other smokes
---
Shields? Not really, other than JUST FLANK 4HEAD (not really a counter) there isn't much you can do without dedicating at LEAST 2, probably 3 people just to killing the shield.
---
I played a ranked match 3v5 today .... it sucked
---
I've always preferred muzzle brake, I guess it's just opinion though.
---
At least he is not fucking invisible

I‚Äôll admit tho yor right about cav

nice lips

F

too real hahaha
---
To bad no one will ever use it because of her holograms haha

Thats because anything near ash's head becomes really tiny, its like a void, thats why you cant headshot her
---
Yeah and why the fuck don‚Äôt I have my shield back with jager, at least give us a different gadget besides only having barbwire...
---
You have to buy them yea. They might give another challenge for 1 more pack in week 2 of the event but other than that you have to buy them

I mean yeah it‚Äôd be funny I guess. It would probably fuck with his hitbox though
---
One way I did is do protect hostage on tower in the kitchen as doc. Once action starts wait 20 seconds and have them kill you rinse repeat. You won't get a lot of renown, but it is fast and adds up quickly especially with a booster
---
This is awesome, what did you use for all of it?
---
Just pulled this from a pack the other day!
---
Wow you‚Äôre so talented I can‚Äôt wait so see what you have in store for us
---
You know what's interesting? 
---
Having J√§ger in team and this happens !
---
It‚Äôs scummy, but it‚Äôs how Ubi wants to do it. It‚Äôs their game, they get to decide. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt play! Simple as that.
---
I literally just got tachanka spawnpeeked and uninstalled lol
---
Dog not taking it seriously trust me, just I kill teammates for cheating in this game (glitches, hacking) not spawn peaking so I see his point.
---
nah Im sure ubisoft would get it perfect, as are all things they make
---
Yep. Unless there‚Äôs another challenge next week the only way to get Showdown cosmetics is to buy the packs. This is the latest in a list of events with this model, which started with Outbreak last year.
---
You kind of look like the Dallas shooter that got domed by a security guard
---
Now just go to your local convenience store
---
Well i don't mean to be rude, but this isn't call of duty and commando pro isn't a hack.
---
\&gt;:(
---
Data caps :/
---
They're only for terrorist hunts. I meant casual multiplayer.
---
Clean your counter, there's too many items
---
As a Thermite main, I'm absolutely fuming.
---
He was friendly but i think he was afk that round bcs He came and asked why he Is dead üòÖ
---
On console, I would say because it‚Äôs really fricken hard to hit Plat (especially if you solo). At that level, there are so many people using bronze accounts to boost and so many Diamonds boosting, as well as mnk. Can‚Äôt say for computer.
---
I am thinking about making a operator card of him or something like that
---
Nice
---
This was nice bro, good job. I can barely aim for shit on console and it‚Äôs all I play üòÇ
---
What does the /s is used for?
---
Sherlock
---
When you roll at the end of the match it's always for a regular alpha pack, you have to buy showdown packs
---
I‚Äôll steal yor balaclava and hide it in a ranked game so you can‚Äôt get it back
---
Dang I didn't know that eh the more you learn
---
Sarcasm
---
It‚Äôs because you used the acog with bucks gun
---
It's really hot out there. The metal becomes molten  and bends.
---
I believe it's a spherical 3m radius
---
Wow
---
Did the other team rage quit
---
I like this
---
It‚Äôs amazing!
---
I bought 9 packs and got both the ash and twitch hats, well worth it

Bandits that I encounter on Chalet:

(Wall that has no business being Bandit trapped) Bandit trapped

Why didn't your boyfriend like it? This is cute as hell.

Put this on r/sfshittyrainbow6

Thanks, as you can tell I put many hours into this. (But it actually took like 20 min to figure out how to put the sticker of Cleveland Brown on my boy Capitao bc im dumb)
---
I just got the same skin!
---
Well to be fair it‚Äôs a really common thing in siege. 
---
Not that I would ever do it.
---
üòâ
---
Buck on console gives me aidsüíÄ i dont understand how people play him
---
Thanks just need a general idea appreciate it. So where should you normally place them to get good use out of them?
---
Are you assuming that I have a peepee and that everyone on this sub has a peepee? How disrespectful
---
Is that wealth I hear? I‚Äôm too poor to understand.
---
Now this made me want some recruit cosmetics really badly. Ubi pls fix
---
If you‚Äôre crying about spawn peeking then you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
if you think about it slugs are just regular bullets
---
Yeah bro shit fucks you up I didn‚Äôt even know what happened I was speaking complete gibberish
---
Blind luck, stupidity, and a whole lot of stubbornness.
---
Looks great!
---
Yeah makes sense. I run into alot of elite controller players in high gold/low plat and quite often a mnk in upper plat.
---
Checkmate kaid mains ! where is your god now ?
---
neeeeed the smoke chibi
---
You are now a God
---
*Bonk*
---
Obviously it changes map to map and obj to obj but I usually put them at crouch height on the side of doorways and on the ground below windows.
---
Occasionally you'll be able to cover multiple doors and/or windows with a single placement on the ground but that's more of a case by case basis
---
Place them on walls next to doors and windows.
---
bruh perfect

I found a diamond the other day that had a 0.6 KD. I thought he was just bad as a noob but his KD was declining..

Nutted
---
Thanks for honest answer ;) prepare for turtle
---
this defeats the whole purpose of a fast paced gamemode
---
That‚Äôs how you do it
---
Let‚Äôs not get too sicko mode
---
Why the hell would you have erection during presentation?
---
I had an all knife clutch as well. We lost.
---
There is not only one way to play the game.
---
Thats why  you shoot hibana pellets in the middle so bandit cant trick them both walls
---
My nigga üëâüèªüòéüëâüèª
---
OK
---
of course not, but the description of the gamemode says ‚Äúfast paced‚Äù camping isnt face paced
---
Yes along with frost invisibility :)
---
Enemies are either pissed or confused, maybe both.
---
I use Bandit and Thatcher a lot so this both pleases me and triggers me
---
Thought so, appreciate the response. Do they do a lot of events on siege do you know ?
---
Thanks, got they two. Still an enjoyable event regardless üòä
---
She is good to mess around and have fun with friends, although if you ever want to do anything in the ranks of gold and higher maybe consider another operator (in copper anything works so don't worry too much about it).
---
Why did you speed it up?
---
I'd say there's one about every season/season and a half
---
Nothing like a genuine compliment.
---
Hi sir, may i save this and make it as my wallpaper?

For Twitch's F2, it's usually ACOG, Foregrip, and Compensator. But on certain maps like House and Hereford, I switch the ACOG with Reflex.

Nomad. She can hide her gadgets and stop flanking. She can stop disarming and it‚Äôs also fun to use. Gridlocks gadget is good as long as no one is around, but it‚Äôs extremely easy to spot, hear, and take oht

This is why I always ban Thatcher on Chalet. I‚Äôd rather run Kaid, watch for Twitch, and hope they don‚Äôt know how to Mav trick the wall.
---
On the floor next to doors and windows, on the floor by common anchor spots. 
---
I rarely put them on the walls because when attackers are scanning the room from a door or window and your ADS is right in the middle of their screen they‚Äôll just shoot it. If it‚Äôs on the floor they have to aim at it and if they‚Äôre aiming at it they‚Äôre not aiming at the boys. 
---
I also play in gold on console where it seems people can‚Äôt aim up and down very well.
---
&gt;Maybe it can come with attachments

SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!

lmaoooo. ash kill cams made me choke. showdown posts are annoying in general

Did you know there is a Delorean in the new map
---
Nice, I wanna see that final at GC :D
---
I use this Bandit trick very often and despise the new Capit√£o since it the bolt just ruins my strat. 
---
On the other hand, I actually run Sledge against this, well thrown frag through the drone hole, free kill.
---
Tachanka is playable, you just need to know where to place the turret, the only real way he could get a buff is to give his mounted lmg a little less recoil.
---
Umm people above gold typically know how impossible it is to trick this wall with the countless counters than can murder from the drone hole....
---
Sadly no, they don't have any drawing before the fight

Hold my beer...

ofc much is personal preference but i dont want to have a competetive disadvantage..

Welp, time to get back to the future.
---
In quick play especially is a place where you can carry depending on if the enemy team has the same amount of skill as your own (assumably low) but you ironically didn‚Äôt see that you showed a bit of your toxic side, regardless of it being fair statements.
---
Go on subreddit, click 3 dots at top right of screen. Then click change user flair.
---
Gridlock, despite being a 1 speed, 3 armor. Her stingers are better since the enemy team has to deal with it by either shooting them, impacts/C4, or going a different way. 
---
Her guns are better with a 60 round magazine LMG, a very decent F90, and a pocket strat shotgun sidearm.
---
She brings more utility with her smokes and her traps can‚Äôt be destroyed by Jager‚Äôs ADS.

I thought this was a screenshot while I was scrolling by. 10/10
---
Well I asked cause once it was 4:4 in ranked, I was Lesion and I tossed a Gu mine, which accidentally hit a teammate who accidentally has only 2 or 3 hp and I downed him. We both died while I was picking him up and we lost that game because of this. I almost uninstalled my game after that, and how could a well-trained operator lose health to something of such a small momentum?
---
In my (silver/gold) experience, those frags seem to get a lot more teamkills for the attackers than kills on the bandit
---
You can clearly see in the that post it is a ddos. EVERYONE has around the same ping and is stuck in place. 
---
This screenshot doesn't show a ddos. It shows a server dying of its own accord. Yes it's the same game but this screenshot alone does not indicate a ddos.
---
I'll have to give it a go. I've only played in a 2 stack for a few seasons in a row though. So might not get the bans we want.
---
This is my 5th restart and still no pack. Its buggy as hell.
---
And then there are other nations down under, just trying to stay out of it
---
You can ask on r/gamingsuggestions
---
you're telling me. I played one ranked match this season. Got in, my whole team was unranked playing against plats and golds
---
He is who he is. He doesn‚Äôt need to dress up.
---
You miss nearly every bullet...
---
He's a Mira main
---
Really bro cmon look at it
---
When you can‚Äôt aim so you blame it on ubi
---
fastest hand in the west
---
It‚Äôs still your fault
---
Gridlock
---
I did hence why I can tell you miss nearly everything
---
you went back in time to steal the final
---
I cant even get one done. Thats why i dont play bandit
---
I cross posted it
---
Thank you for the help!
---
Yup like the three or four headshots
---
I thought he would hate him because he has an unmanned drone
---
Silver 2 too diamond. LULW okay bud.
---
It‚Äôs ok just 31 minutes. Go play other games for 31 minutes then come back.
---
You didn't fire a bullet while aiming at their head.
---
:(
---
For almost everybody I use the Reflex sight. Ever since learning how to rush and rotate I just can‚Äôt use the ACOG anymore, it limits my field of view too much and doesn‚Äôt allow me to flick as much when I get surprised. 
---
It‚Äôs a tossup between Flash Hider and Compensator for me, but I usually go compensator. My initial shots are usually good enough that I‚Äôll trade a little recoil in the beginning for some stability if I really need to keep firing downrange. 
---
Vertical compensator, always. With my playstyle I like to flick sideways at head height and so I‚Äôll sacrifice the scope in time to ensure maximum vertical stability.
---
Well second one wasnt realy my fault
---
I am kinda confused on how you could miss with the MPX, then one gun that is so easy with even angled grip that you simply can't miss with.
---
It kinda is for not paying attention
---
yeah, they are far better to deal, instead of clash IMO.

but the fookin lazah soights

But im actually just commenting to tell the other commenters that its a VERY dumb idea to dump or insult your SO just because they didnt like what you made \^\^ holy shit its just a little painting. its not like he doesnt like ANYTHING she makes. atleast we dont know that so calm down guys.
---
...and could you make a kapkan, thatcher, mozzie or nokk one? my favourite operators right now :P
---
Isnt it always bad?
---
Due process?
---
Didn‚Äôt think I missed but I mean maybe it just happened to not hit him when I was aiming and shooting at his head
---
B
---
No red plug.
---
No yellow plug.

No router symbol.

Yeah, it didn't hit because you missed.

Now that's messed up.

Awh man, I sure hate it when I don't know my friends name!

We talked about the game a year ago, and don‚Äôt know who he was
---
He means master bedroom, hostage site
---
Yeah
---
meanwhile I will knife them point blank and mine don't register lol
---
I didn‚Äôt mean for it to come off like that, I asked his opinion minutes before posting so it was fresh in my mind. I should‚Äôve at least specified that I‚Äôm happy with it, and I genuinely enjoy sharing my little paintings with everyone here. Sorry about that :/

There's no skilled based matchmaking in casual, meaning regardless of your rank, you'll be playing with any rank, copper-diamond, if you want to be on a even playing field play ranked, it's simple

I'm going with general help so:
---
Maps have been reworked, play a lot so you can have a knowledge of almost every spot in every map.
---
Train in t-hunt classic solo, only headshot till you end the normal, then hard, then realistic. (Take your time for the last one)
---
Watch a lot of Varsity gaming video, it's funny and teach a lot of things in the game, same for MacieJay and other streamers/YouTubers.
---
(If competitive) Give and take call-out from your friends, they always help in a way.
---
Last but not least DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DDOSSER BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING A HUGE PROBLEM ON CONSOLE, IT WILL HAPPEN OFTEN IN RANKED. Suggest to you to not care about it too much.
---
That gun is like ash's headshot hitbox back in the day
---
I said Epic because to this day I have never seen a Legendary that is good. Hell, even black ice is epic, not legendary
---

---
Little late comment here. I'd love to see some sort of buff (damage or ACOG) now that some time has passed and I personally think she's underwhelming. 
---
MP5SD for ACOG option would be perfect (it's basically FMG with an ACOG stat wise after all). 
---
MP7 for damage but I feel like it could be almost any other guns defenders have as long as it offer more DPS than FMG 9. 
---
For a solo operator whose job is to enter site by herself and take out anchors, FMG just feels inadequate for her role especially when her gadget is very selfish one. 
---
If anchors are doing their job and watch the entry points, Nokk absolutely has to land a headshot immediately or she gets outgunned by Anchors who has more armor and range (and sometimes in damage too).
---
Ok.....I've been playing T hunt a bit....and I've been playing as the same ops as always....I especially like montagne because I can just shield until the perfect opportunity and when I'm playing with friends I can help shield them.
---
Well since it is 46 days later, we now know that  N√∏kk really doesn‚Äôt need any changes, except her claymore, and Warden really needs some form of a buff. N√∏kk is overall fine in her current state and HEL is really balanced. However, Warden is pretty much the worse op in the game right now. His gun is awful, his lack of acog is even worse, and his ability isn‚Äôt always useful. While he was designed to be an alternative to Jager that can more easily anchor, a 2speed with his ability that would be able to actually push attackers would make sooooo much more sense. Also the fact that he has to stand still, as an anchor, to see through smoke (like new glaz), is really really stupid. So yea, right now N√∏kk is fine but Warden could use that acog.

T hunt at this state is pretty terrible tbh. It drastically needs a rework, maybe in year 5. Because there was nothing about it on this year's roadmap. Also I think having especial events that all ops are available to play (for a limited time) is a better idea.

The community is kinda toxic, it's just the way it is unfortunately.. Alot of people is super impatient, so if you are the only one left, and you try to be tactical instead of run'n'gunning, some people will try to get you kick'd.. It's not everyone, and the game is great (when it works), so I suggest you find some people to squad up with, to get the best experience possible

There's no such thing as too late!

On console it is basically useless
---
Why did he get banned?
---
I see your point. I would prefer if the the event content was earnable (like alpha packs, but much more rare), as well as directly purchasable as is all other gear. 
---
I'd like to see event gear:
---
1) be earnable but very rare
---
2) be directly purchasable with Credits (NOT Renown) for more 1.2x more than an event pack
---
3) still be available in event packs
---
I think purchasing individual gear for Credits should make the gear more expensive than if you purchased an event pack and got the lucky item you wanted. It's a win-win. Let's say you just wanted to buy the gear set outright, it would be maybe 1.2x as expensive as if you had opened it by chance in an event pack. This way, the event pack is still a relevant way to obtain gear but the shortcut is still reasonably within reach. For people who don't care and want most/all gear, they don't have to spend the upped prices of individual gear whereas for the people who want individual gear don't need to spend 8100 Credits to get that one piece they want.

I argue that every map is defender sided if you as an attacker let it be. People overall are better defenders then they are attackers, especially maps that are slightly larger then usual. Also you regurgitating that Pros and Streamers don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt make it bad at all.
---
Ok
---
Sure, but not in this context.
---
These lootboxes have a ceiling to how much you can spend. It's $80. That is the ABSOLUTE MAX amount of money they can make from one person buying these. Other games give duplicates so there is a non existent cap.
---
A lot of people, myself included, will not buy these packs for that reason. Sure, you can get everything for a set price, but most people only want a few things.
---
So the situation becomes this:
---
* Option 1: Have a few people spend $80
---
* Option 2: Have way more people buy a lot of small purchases adding up to maybe $10 or $20
---
You will make WAY more money with Option 2 than 1.
---
Yeah last I checked you can do it in 2k. Your best hope is just reporting them both in game and on their actual ps profile
---
this is LITERALLY me, AMIRITE GAMERS xd uwu rawr

Reminds me of the original r6, where you'd spend an hour carefully planning your multiple squad attack plan just to realize that one of your stops wasn't angled right when a grenade meant to breach a room coastlines a whole squad

Or one can still love an artist (or in this case, your girlfriend) and still be honest with it. My girlfriend didn't like a certain thing about me, but she still loves me anyways.

Lootboxes are Option 3: Both.

Bandit takes a lot of time to electrify the wall and the Hibana is probably below silver.

These two options usually work for me: Restart Siege, or play a match. The pack will appear after the reset or after you finish a match.

Packs usually show back up after restarting the game

Not much thatcher can do, thatcher can‚Äôt do shit versus bandit since his nades only take effect after the bandit battery is placed and after your nade goes off so if the bandit isn‚Äôt retarded and is picking up his batteries after tricking there‚Äôs nothing you can do
---
r/tworedditorsonecup

That would cannibalize elite skins sales which is why they dont do it, selling point of elite skins is that they look different on operator selector screen
---
Nice play, my dude. My team does this on Chalet when attacking garage. Have Hibana stay outside garage and bait the bandit while Monty, Thermite, and Thatcher go after our real target, the side wall that leads into Winery.
---
I believe so!

I dont think you can deploy in that corner very well, even when they are available

If you don‚Äôt mind my asking how did u do this without getting banned?

How are the defenders op with the new shield of you can see through both sides
---
That‚Äôs good, preserve your innocence
---
They haven‚Äôt even begun to peak.

Yeah. I think the C75 is great. It rips in those close range engagements. 1000 rpm at 35 damage is no joke
---
The artist is at the bottom left, I never realised it till someone told me. I literally posted this with genuine intentions for humour. Go check my previous posts if thats your mentality mate.

Servers are just bad. I can go from a perfectly smooth connection on CoD to a laggy high ping connection on Rainbow on the same internet in the same 3 minutes. Nothing you can do on your end about the bad servers.

The M870? That thing is kinda nuts on smaller maps tbh. I kinda like running it on Hereford.

Then you run into pay to win because it changes Valks cams and Twitches drones, granted people make that argument already. I just wish you could equip their animations to any outfit.

Plus the mag size it has, might as well be a full blown primary

I always go for lesion simply because invisible goo mines that tick 10 damage per second and take 3 seconds to remove is annoying af. I also rarely see cav, but when lesion isn't banned he's always picked.

Nice I love border too.
---
I made sure to say Game Server for this reason. They are NOT ddos'ing Ubisoft's servers, they are ddos'ing the game server you are playing on. Ubisoft's servers hold a lot more than Siege, so the servers are broken up into smaller game servers. Think of it like a custom match that is being crashed, rather than the entire game.
---
1. Roll acog on anything you can. And 2. It‚Äôs quite a steep learning curve but you‚Äôll get it.
---
It'll make you a huge douche if your intention is boosting, which it certainly sounds like it is
---
I completely agree. Warden‚Äôs main gadget is far far too situational and limiting to justify the rest of his weak kit. He is a slow, loud three armor, wielding a shotgun, a mediocre smg, with a poor selection of side arms. On top of this, he is unnecessarily denied an acog for said smg.
---
The worst part; however, is the nature of using his gadget. Warden has no control, at all, over when his gadget can be of use. He is entirely reliant on attackers giving him functionality through either smokes or candelas which they choose when and where to deploy. Even once they *are* deployed, assuming Warden is in position to even be of use, he emits a quite audible que that he is watching. Then he has a short uptime to capitalize against an enemy who knows he is there, while also likely having an inferior weapon and position. He can‚Äôt even conserve that uptime like Nokk. There‚Äôs no reason Glaz couldn‚Äôt just toss a smoke, force out Warden‚Äôs cooldown, toss the second and do exactly as he wanted to before.
---
I think Warden either needs a major buff to his gadget or the rest of his kit.
---
Solution one could be to give him a resource based gadget, like nokk, cav, and vigil, so he can conserve vision uptime to better deny pushing with smoke. I would also say he shouldn‚Äôt loudly announce his position and be so limited in mobility while using his gadget, since he has no control over when the smokes/flashes come out. Wouldn‚Äôt mind if he highlighted people like Glaz even. Would give him some utility without an attacker literally having to throw it to him. 
---
Solution two could be buffing the rest of his kit. If they‚Äôre sold on the mpx, Warden should really have an acog for it, bare minimum. I‚Äôd also like to at least try giving him a nitro. A high fire rate weapon w/ acog and a nitro is a kit I‚Äôm will to take a potentially useless primary gadget for. Maybe the acog by itself would be enough and the nitro too much, but it would definitely cement Warden as a strong, all around anchor, instead of a junkie looking for his next smoke.
---
But yeah, in his current state, Warden probably has the one of the worst defender gadgets, while also having an underwhelming kit. Let‚Äôs hope for change someday.
---
I want to see you play more of this

First off you don't need to comment negativity, unless you're giving a legit critique. "I don't like it" isn't a critique, it's just being negative and rude towards someone's art.

Second off, if you make it a point to tell your boy/girl/theyfriend you don't like their art, you're a dick.

Nokk is pretty fun to play. I got her on release (I don‚Äôt bother with the season pass) and it‚Äôs fun to sneak around and take fools out without them ever hearing or seeing you.

Lol you got me there. I just reacted and grabbed my phone.

I would say Jackal's PDW, but a) he's banned every ranked match and b) I feel like I've seen a lot more people running it lately, even in Pro League.

Mozzie's guns seem balanced, I feel like the split of players who use the Roni or the Commando is pretty even.

Yeah but I have seen that happen before and the crosshair wasn‚Äôt there in the past when this happens

Ok kid.

I'm confused
---
It happens with shottys I think

Dunno why you'd want a custom multiplier if you have an ingame sens you like, but 58 @ 800 DPI with your multiplier will work.

I solo queue a lot, but for the most part I didn‚Äôt really try up until outbreak
---
July 9th?
---
I was more thinking stanley from the office but idk
---
Unless they have ying or blitz then warden is basically useless, with blitz being banned every ranked game and dying being fairly situational, he isn't very viable. Nokk is similar to Vigil in usability, along with being the only attacker with an SMG, she isn't great with long range engagements where attackers usually thrive. Only thing she's good for is sneaking, but I've rarely seen or been in those situations. I would say he's correct with this assumption, at least imo. Already ready for the next season
---
Ill still miss guaranteed
---
Go on?
---
Awesome Edit! What rank are you?
---
For some reason they keep nerfing it secretly since grim sky. Its had its damage lowered and it fires slower. No fucking clue why, it's not like it was actually overpowered like the *ahem* m870
---
I just thought that any headshot was insta kill but people are saying shotguns

Git gud nerd. It‚Äôs golf rules, didn‚Äôt you know?

If one pellet hits it‚Äôs not a headshot idk how many have to hit but a few of them have to hit.

Xbox GT?

Probably due to them being good support. Did they have any assists?
---
It's a hacker on the attacking team trolling around.
---
Ash g36 with angled grip
---
Try angled grip everywhere where its available except shotguns. On pc you can easily compensate small buff to recoil that vertical grip gives you with your mouse. And you will shoot in your enemies much faster after seeing them without ads
---
Oh and for ela there is her shotgun with extended barrel.
---
Not slow walk you can regular walk without getting detected
---
I did it in 7 seconds I killed all 3 with a made from my spawn
---
Is this 9gag?

Top spot had more assists and probably had some spoting "assists" so they got a decent chunk of points

Yeah, the smoke vision is just way too situational, and it doesn't even work if you dare to move. And the activation delay is so long you can't reasonably stand out in the open to trigger it, or be reasonably expected to be able to effectively counter flashes with it.
---
Might help if it auto-activated on flash, and if the smoke vision stayed active when walking slowly.
