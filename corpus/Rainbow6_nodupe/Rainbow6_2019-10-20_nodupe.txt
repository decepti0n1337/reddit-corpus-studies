slithering and slethering around like a boss

I could agree with the smaller maps. At least 2 more would be nice. The large maps can be a little overwhelming on days when you just want to relax (Bank). But as far as the 2v2 goes, wouldn’t custom game be the same thing? Or were you thinking more of a specialized online experience?
---
tea would be nice to see if unranked or casual is faster
---
You sure?
---
So warden?
---
Cause rogue 9 made it a meme
---
I saw a full gang. Ela wanted to play gweent
---
no pc on earth could handle that
---
when the spookrober is draging you down
---
A commin duplicate, im afraid.
---
We were doing shotguns only , I’m not that bad
---
That's what I thought. He didn't test it?
---
Nope lmao
---
lol greed, you know this game once the proper BP launches will have more microtransactions than some F2P games?
---
Believe it or not , but I was playing with a full squad of plat 3s/2 s

I’m pissed they took Kaids barbed wire, let me and bandit make the floor electric dammit
---
its really what you said: an simulation in vr in order to train. not used by the army but by r6 but whatever.
---
That's surprising
---
It stops boosting, be thankful

This would be helpful -- if it was the elite.

Or you just stand outside big garage below the window, aim upwards and voila!, there goes the welcome mat.

It punishes people for being sloppy

I thought it was pretty cool but then I saw the BOSG... oh lawd

---
When people ask why those on console get made fun of, show them this video.
---
Lion be like "I wonder where the last enemy is ?" 🤔
---
Only console players would do that
---
Probably because Turtle Beaches are overpriced garbage that only sell well because of the name. They're basically the Beats of the gaming headset world.
---
And why are the CTU‘s fighting other CTU‘s? Doesn’t that make the other CTU‘s terrorists? They’ve become what they swore to destroy! 
---
And on both sides speaks the same announcer, maybe he’s the real enemy? 
---

---
To be honest, rainbow is one of the more realistic shooters I’ve played, even tho many things that happen are questionable. I like that there’s Team damage, I’m not abusing it and so aren’t many other people I’m playing with and I play a lot of siege, without team damage something would miss and would ruin the game a bit, for example the enemy team is capturing the objective, while fuze is outside and keeps fuzing, you can’t take care of the enemy team and they capture the objective fuze‘s grenades keep them covered.
---
Or the whole defender team would hide in smoke‘s smoke
---
You dont need much for gold

Ur clean bro

I use that for melee

Very Sneaky..

Cuz it ain't Call of Booty brother

I see now

Suprised no one shot him through the drone hole

Its fun

Why does this give off really lewd vibes despite not an ounce of nudity

Yeah but this is a new instance of it, and as far as I know, nobody pointed it out.

What'd it say?
---
Neither for casual
---
Damn thats lucky
---
Why
---
See what?
---
Last time I was in this situation where everyone was outside looking for me I just went into site and planted by the time they made it back it didn’t matter who had more number they all just piled through one door way making it easier for me
---
Just Realized I used "stole" wrong
---
Right there with you buddy
---
pretty sure he was after the achievement for getting the breaching charge kill
---
I got it without even realizing, kinda sad I don't have it recorded
---
Why didn’t dokk frag?
---
They have had tons of tournaments in every single game and controller players hang with them every time. Unless you are a pro I guarantee I will.
---
Attackers: *does this*
---
Grenades: Am I a joke to you?
---
I think he's the best siege content creator
---
you have 20 hp when downed
---
You got one kill
---
1. The attackers are absolutely brainless. Why jump through the same window after the first guy died?
---
2. The attackers are absolutely brainless. There is a drone hole directly to Ela’s right. If you’re so determined to go through that window, shoot her first.
---
3. The attackers are absolutely brainless. 3 spawns, 4 doors, 5 windows, 2 skylights, and a tunnel. Go somewhere else!
---
Who has the sword icon?
---
No Problem for Ryzen
---
Oh man the F2000 is looking sexy.
---
Alright I'll take that bet lol. Drop your username and we can go.
---
Ela shotgun is stupid OP. Ano
---
Yone closer than 5 feet away stands no chance
---
Echo cause he's op on every site. Mira is good tho
---
I mean theres tons of options in this thread currently, pick anyone of the retards that are ass clenchingly pissed that I insulted their precious recruit or tardchanka.
---
i didn’t read that so calm down bud
---
Bruh what rank are you
---
Depends on what you play most. If you play a lot of ranked and unranked then don’t get echo as he is almost always banned and instead get Mira. If you play mostly casual then I would definitely recommend getting echo.
---
Or furries...
---
They kept coming in like "I'll get em, let me at em." 
---
Usually after 1 max 2 people die like that in quick succession I find another entrance.
---
everyone on console is deaf without headphones I guess
---
I'm Rick Harrison, and you never know what is gonna come through that ~~door~~ window
---
Attacked? Enemies' cries of "you only use a shield cause u can't aim" are what sustains me!
---
And although it’s less common then giving impacts to anchors is equally annoying. Where are you going took the nearest buffet?
---
Only on console lmfao.
---
Although, PC Casual lobbies are an absolute shit show lol
---
This is how he changed a nation
---
People say the map is far to small, in casual it's unusual to not get a run out at least once per match, some objectives are impossible to attack. I see the map quite a bit and have grown to be okay with it (I know a lot of good maestro spots) but otherwise it kinda relies on the stupidity of your enemy to win some objectives.
---
Either they can give her the MP5SD without an ACOG or give her the MP7. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And make her 3 speed.
---

It's difficult to get people to coordinate in casual. Playing someone as complex as Mira can end up being a detriment to the team if you're not set up in an orderly fashion. Someone will generally reinforce next to you, taking away your soft wall for peeking, or even worse, shoot out the glass.
---
toxicity is just a part of gaming whether you like it or not. people care too much about there internet points. and it doesn’t matter it’s not your game and you can’t decide if people play it or not you’re just a part of the community.
---
Right? I would literally never pick impacts on Kaid. C4, maybe, but impacts? Fucking never.
---
i couldn’t tell you tbh
---
Kinda gives me a neon vice vibe i love it
---
Upvote for skeleton unzip for Ela

I am aware.
---
Sneak 100, coming to theaters near you.

I don't know why but headsets always are worse for me. Any form of in ear or just earphones have better 3d sound when gaming personally.
---
I say replace his gun with the VSS Vintorez.
---
 As glaz main I like this idea

You can beat this with infinite-round ties.. unless they removed those, only got one back in 2016 so very possible
---
Oof all three of them triggered lmao
---
Recruit is a man of culture.
---
Depends on the drug lmao
---
It do be like that, also nice name

that sight is ok the regular holo is my favorite besides acog

Yes but then what’s the case with maestro? High rof and low recoil and double the ammo ela has?
---
No No No Noooo

You have infected other poor souls

How much is he charging?

Matt Frost, at your service.

I never do it, but once they can move it isn't spawnpeeking anymore.
---
Their rank should just be “No”
---
2 things
---
Ela bout to get boned
---
Ela v Skela
---
That is all
---
The names Matt, Frost Matt and you
---
this is the best pun on this site
---
That Monty was braindead to not have heard the defuser being hit. I still find it funny how ubi is like "hey guys! Look at us! We added a tablet for the defuser! Isnt it neat!" And yet still keep the smashing animation lmao.
---
This is woosh hell
---
Straight outta Cod4 with the ninja defuse
---
Ah, typical console.
---
Up vote for Ela unzip for Skela
---
Durango is the Project name for the original 2013 Xbox One. The Project name for the Xbox One X was for example Scorpio
---
Keep in mind the huge acog monster lmg maestro wields, as well as being able to soften up or even kill someone with proper cam placement. Also evil eyes give the attacker anxiety. They will stare at it waiting for the slightest opening.
---
That was all I used to do back in search and destroy
---
r/angryupvote
---
Ahaha I think I only had one ninja defuse and it wasnt unti the remastered version
---
it's not your fault, it's that limit.

see you in hot

*this is beyond copper*
---
Granted, 3 people have been executed.
---
He’s not a three speed.
---
His gadget is incredible though
---
The worst part is this was on PC...
---
Thanks, sorry I’m kinda new so I don’t know every op yet
---
Too many nightmares of me going up the stairs on Favela to be staring at a cav. Great cosplay !
---
*increases ban on next asshole team*
---
heh
---
Oh I know where this is going
---
Amazing!
---
Double barrel shotgun nose
---
If you watch it slower, you'd notice it doesn't flick right to the head, but just to the left of it. He has to correct his aim in order to get the first kill.
---
I only noticed this thanks to this post. How was I so blind?
---
"THIS IS WHY WE BAN LESION ELI!"

yeah but still i’d rather use the ar

Damn that trigger finger

Just read the info on there and go to town
---
The only place you could be to be able to knife is prone under the window.  Siege is about paying attention to everything even how people died and not being observant is what got them killed.
---
Nøkk is bad. Her guns suck, her ability is more like vigils than Cavs, and she's just not good. Nomad has better guns and a better ability. Get nomad.
---
Ok thank you so much
---
Thanks m8
---
Why ash doesn't have angle
---
All I want for them to do is disable Lesion being able to see an outline of where they are so that people playing him will actually have to remember where they put the mines like Kapkan and Ela.
---
I love claymores. I know anything else can be much more useful to me or the team, but when i get someone with a claymore its the best.
---
1 out of 5000 mmr maybe
---
Fuck this reminds me of the meme were the joker and there is a little joker and the caption is "When dad and i get mcdonalds and the family doesnt know" or some shit like that, thats what this reminds me of
---
But his goggles prevent flashes and suck against smoke, but I feel like it would be cool if the op could always have the thermal goggles on
---
F for MoonboyGames
---
Depends on your playstyle tbh. Nomad is a lot stronger and is great for stopping run-outs, and Nokk is stronger for going alone and might need a bit of a buff. I'd suggest nomad but it's up to you
---
I've made plenty of things in my life already- for example, *you.*
---
Yes, it's me.
---
4:30 as In east coast time?
---
That by definition isn’t an SMG.
---
And SMG is a carbine that fires pistol calibers. A .308 is a rifle round. It doesn’t matter what the base model is. What matters is the round it fires
---
It's hard for actually bronzes to play when there are so many fakes in bronze
---
Nah it's not your gender it's just the toxicity of this game

Nah I don’t think that’s it, I think the saying goes along the lines of: I use my 46 chromosomes to not make a fool of myself online 
---
And who said I thought it hit lmao,like I said, it looks like it did but whatever. I guess reading isn’t your specialty either
---
Casual + newcomer is a very good way to get votekicked for no apparent reason
---
Are you talking in voice? If no they have no way of Nowing your a girl. Sometimes you just get randomly vote kicked by a 4 stack that you wronged in some way
---
Penetrate their defenses
---
Why would you use it tho no fancy reload
---
What's your dpi at?
---
Aight my guy/girl I’ll friend you just invite me to a party or message me on reddit or PlayStation or something idc whatever works lol
---
Cry more
---
I never said you thought it hit. I said the video proves nothing and I’ll take it seriously when it’s stable
---
Looks like you need to get better at reading
---
Kapkan hides.
---
Oh. Uuhhhhh. Weird
---
Will do, tomorrow around 1 I can play for a good while so if your on during then we can meme around🤣
---
I'm still pissed they took bandit's fucking acog
---
I hope they actually do give an op an RPG so we can see people. complain about backblast. (Hint, dont shoot it inside or with someone behind you.
---
Go play in bronze and see how it turns out
---
commando is superior
---
Im on ps4

Attackers had a dinka, yeah I meant dinka bitch got a penis

Finka was added Two or three years ago...

Yeah it’s ridiculous lol.

Extract Hostage on Terry Hunt is by far the hardest thing Ive ever done solo. Just cause you cant do one thing doesn't mean you can't do others.
---
Never judge a fish by its ability to fly.
---
Hoes mad
---
The learning curve and the expectations of people are high in this game, I've had multiple occasions where I've been tk'd or kicked for not clutching 1v4 / 1v5s. The only thing that keep me from quitting is that whenever it doesn't happen the game is quite fun, the only thing I can say is that queuing with friends drop that vote kick to a zero for obvious reasons
---
He’s a three speed with a C4, great guns and gadgets. Why don’t people use him more?
---
depends on were you aiming at
---
if you going for heads = p10 roni
---
if you going for anything else = commando
---
the reason why i picked Mozzie is because the stupider it is the better the outcome
---
I mean in retrospect yes but also look at your K.D for the season itself under the ranked guide and what is your role when you play, if your an anchor, support your generally not supposed to get kills but it does happen if you play it right.
---
U right, only 29 r6 credits away from 69... almost *Nice*
---
Flannel league.
---
We need a modding rework ASAP. Modding in this game is laughably bad.
---
Boy I love 50% of my screen being taken up while I ads
---
The pepperoni is better in all ways statistically (except ammo) but the commando has become his main weapon probably because of the reload animation (also is pretty good by itself)
---
This was probably staged
---
Imagine playing for 2 years and no friends to team up with
---
Mozzie b thicc
---
Yea I definitely can. Cyaa
---
The thing about amaru is, apparently, she's "very" strong in a coordinated 5 stack, coordinating to assist her in taking site. Pros' words, apparently.
---
She does have one of the best loadout combinations in the game, breaching potential, and quick off map and on map rotation. She's a low responsibility fragger, and giving her frags now *could* result in making her ash v2.
---
I'd say we should hold off on buffing her until we have a season's worth of data. We have the data for nøkk and warden. We need to wait for data for her.
---
Another Prove for consoles being noob, another prove that PC is Master Race, get triggered and salty console bois
---
If you have that mindset, maybe the game isn't for you. You will die a lot, even in T-Hunt practice. This game has a very steep learning curve. Even high ranked players get frustrated and make mistakes. 
---
The one thing that helped me was trying to view every death or failed round as a chance to improve. Over time, you will get better but so will your expectations of yourself. That can lead to great bounds or total burnout after dying all evening.
---
I think he’ll still be a comfort ban for people in Ranked that like to roam around the map without being tracked, he still seems like a strong pick considering even one ping can tell you where anyone roaming is, and he’s still got smokes and an impressive loadout. It’s a step in the right direction though, less difficult to deal with when you’re roaming from one side to another and you just get tracked once.
---
Sometimes I am but I’m thinking they know bc my PS4 name is my own name— which is a girls name haha. I might just be paranoid but I really love this game, I find it super fun but it sucks getting vote kicked every second match. I’m thinking of changing my PS4 name which will cost $10. :(  thank you for replying btw
---
You could just make a smurf
---
He got something better though
---
Oh shit really? And i mean that would have to be touched on a lot no? Cause if you think like how far doi have to turn my CONTROLLER SIDEWAYS to lean lol not mad just common sense cause that would be a hassale
---
New ops aren't paid through real cash. That doesn't count. Everybody has access to them. Same could even be said for skins.
---
I didnt get plat until i was level 180... :(
---
Why would I do that? That just makes the game worse for lower level players
---
Hitboxes as a whole are completely fucked, its not as bad as it use to be, but you'll notice it. Also neck shots don't count as headshots I'm pretty sure
---
holy shit i thought this said stand
---
no you don’t get banned for them. where did you see that?
---
Spawn peaking with Doc
---
I was about to comment on the bad choice in primary but I realized this is pre-nerf Ela and that recoil just doesn’t exist.

Are those

Ok
---
bandit has a built in vertical grip on his gun and his gun is already crazy hood it doesn’t need a buff.
---
Ok...
---
I aced in 11 seconds :/
---
Thank you very cool
---
You're not an actual plat untill you hit plat 2. Most people that get plat 3 dont even deserve it. They just get it by versing golds and silvers. Maybe you got carried maybe you didnt. If you mainly played against silvers and golds you're a shitter plat. But if you got it versing other plats then congrats
---
Yummy yummy

it’s already like that

I can hear the image

Sweet.

On his shield there are 3 meshes that if hit perfect with mellee not bullet that it will go through

Impossible. Facts are true; like for example; cav is the best operator in the entire game. If you don't agree you can catch this interrogation.

Did you get TK'd immediately?

---
This does put a smile on my face
---
I think we all know where this is going...
---
Thank you Mila very cool.
---
Let's go ahead then.
---
If you ever played rng heavy games like hearthstone and watched highlights you know the craziest shit happens eventually. So yeah i would say this isn’t necessarily fake.
---
If you had a player that was very inexperienced on your team, would you like “Hey they got a maverick in the room over there!” Or would you prefer “Maverick in tea room!”
---
This trick works by throwing a grenade/drone and then switching to your breaching round gadget way before it's actually thrown.
---
Just press your grenade/drone key then your operator gadget key right after. Might work with other operator gadgets, but I haven't tested.
---
Disclaimer: A macro was used for testing purposes to see how quickly you can do this trick.
---
Server Asia Right Now In Silver Cuz Playing lone 😔

I use the 50 dollar hyper X and upgraded to then from a pair of headphones and let me tell you this.
---
Before I went to hyper X I would have trouble telling whether the foot steps were on the other side of the wall or above me or below me.
---
Now I can hear the loud thuds indicating that they are above me and the normal shuffling indicating that they are on the other side of the wall and the light bassy foot steps indicating that they are below me.
---
We don't take kindly to liars round these parts.

Looks like Untitled Goose Game. I love it.

I'm implying that after the round started, from 2:30 until 0:00, Glaz would still be outside the building/obj with 50m distance
---
1. It gets activated if you've shot a teammate so much and other multiple pullings of the trigger in order to prevent a team kill.
---
2. This never happens to me, but if you do it often enough Siege just tells you to fuck off I guess
---
3. By choosing a different killer every time
---
4. Because one high rated player isn't gonna completely destroy your chance of winning
---
5. Because Ubi wanted people to take ranked more serious
---
6. They arent
---
7. Because Ubi doesn't want people interfering with a players chance of getting banned unfairly. If you see a cheater, u can report him. That's it. No report spamming.
---
8. I dunno what kinda question is that
---
Hibana or Nomad are good picks. Depends on your playstyle.

Don’t forget your teammates are rushing into the building with defuser... and playing ash when you really needed that hard breach

Yeah me neither but still she s very powerful op. She s like a spider she just sits in a room wait until one of her mines go off and then go to collect her prey
---
It’s almost as if those are entirely different games that are designed to be realistic as possible while rainbow six isn’t
---
It happens. This is on console too, less easy to flick to the left.
---
Oh shit i thought those were condoms
---
Xin chaooo
---
This is great well done! Using the chibis was a great choice
---
Gotta love how the circle around the play button in mobile reddit lines up so well with the crosshair

If you guys didnt get it, consoles have a set fov at 60

---
 im not gonna say anything 'bout that tho..

I read it. I really felt like the last mission to Brazil was unnecessary. Sorry for spoiler, im on mobile and cant mark spoilers

He looks kinda like malcolm's dad. But older. As if he time traveled.

Literally the exact same pose too

Or you bring breaching charges.

Mike Myers had 10 sensitivity and we had 100 AND southpaw lefty

I have a PC , that’s not the issue or why I want support brought back
---
Oh my god the mp9
---
I remember when they were at the bank and they had to do a takedown in less than five seconds, that made me think *oh, this is where Bank happens.* Then that chalet scene happens, that was cool as well
---
no i mean im a vietnamese too budd :) but theres that streamer who does cosplay of r6s and she has patreon and shit. She does her ela cosplay there so when i saw the noti i thought u would upload it here :v but nah yours is purely better
---
you really wanna prove a point don't ya? just stop talking and move forward...
---
Fookin laser sights
---
Not really...
---
Whata gentleman, scumbag.
---
Yes. I really am trying to prove a point. You wouldn't talk to a woman like that in real life so why do so over the internet?
---
on the 22 or 29 of october

You're beautiful

What is that rook outfit it’s so cool

It looks great on some weapons, shitty on others. For example it looks really got on the USP 40 and the Deagle, just to name a couple.

Sorry but nah
---
Yeah,probably.

I love how she recoils on impact.

Then do
---
I would prefer Ela blasting off skeleton heads DOOM style
---
No but set textures on low and dont minimize your game when it time to load the round.

For the patches just try Australia army surplus patches in google should be plenty of them as I see them all the time here in my local surplus place

Ok, thanks!

I use a reflex for me it just feels less jumpy than the holo and I just don’t like the red I would say with the acog it depends on play style and map range
---
Muzzle brake, reflex. Easy mode.

---
1. This could be the Follow the Leader strat from Strat Roulette.
---
2. Just because *you* have the common sense to check the kill feed doesn't mean everyone does.
---
3. It looks like some of the people were trying to turn left to pick him off, but with it being on console, unless you have your sensitivity ramped up really high it's pretty awkward trying to flick like that.
---
4. Yeah, the odds of this happening are low, but all that means is that it's not zero.
---
Damn  Europe
---
Right? So many crap clips get uploaded here.
---
Its great, but its difficult to apreciate ela cosplays anymore due to the huge ammount of cosplayers that dress up like her IMO.
---
Really, why is she the most cosplayed? Just curious.
---
Mira
---
They weren’t just team mates they were actual friends so I trusted them
---
Console dog
---
Lesion is better,then mira and Ela for last
---
Honestly I tried it and I feel like I’ve gotten more kills because of it idk why
---
mira is the top op and is a must pick at most sites
---
Ela
---
I uuuh...feel a lot better about myself now
---
Ya
---
I know. I'm just saying. In a game about realism. A guy low crawling down the stairs in tac gear should would like a 3 stooges episode vs crouching lol.
---
any reason? I heard his gadgets op but that’s about it
---
If you like go roaming with shotgun, buy  ela
---
Lesion is soooooo good loq recoil high fire rate good ability
---
No links is fine, i forgot i to point out i was planning on using his shot gun and the commando 9 instead of the P10.
---
any reason? She seems solid but her weapons don’t look good
---
No. Somethings up with the servers my que times have been crap all day
---
Jesus Christ
---
It does
---
I’m more of an anchor, I like to stay near or at site and just pick off any easy kills

Cuz he’s hobbit size?

Bro that window she has is OP

Mira I don’t like bc her gun has less ammo per mag ( I miss a lot ) and ela got nerfed and isn’t very intimidating anymore
---
Ah ok we'll still for the shirt patches and vest an Aussie surplus place should do you maybe someone who is more into 3d printing could help with the rest

I reported to a one arab guy (most the keyboard cheaters are arabs) with this profile description :

Where did you get the helmet? It look quite cool to use in airsoft
---
Definitely lesion

1 at most, but just know that the BOSG is one of the worst guns in the game

that sledge is an absolute unit

There’s a cosplay content reminder telling me not to be sexual but that paint job is makin me mighty aroused, looks damn good.

A fully automatic tech-9 would be considered a machine pistol. And if it's added to the game, it would be full auto. Just like every other machine pistol in the game. And either model regardless of actual function. Is widely known as the "Tech-9" it happens a lot with weapons. Either a different named is added to it. Like the bazooka. Or a civilian models name take precedence over the original, as is the case of the tech-9.
---
it's not a bad gun, the recoil is just horrible with ACOG
---
When the lasers touch, you become bonded forever
---
Made by me on Nike by you.com
---
Thatchering intensifies
---
FH and holo work pretty well since buck is a more close quarters operator. ACOG doesn't really suit his kit as well and just hinders him more IMO
---
if u miss your two shots with bosg your dead and a liability to your team,just switch to the k1a or mk14 if youre playing dokkaebi
---
I'm not saying to let it go. Hold onto it with a death grip. It's a fantastic weapon platform. I'm saying that it's reached it's developmental limit. You can always add better parts, or sights to it, but you can't modify it past that. I look at it like sharks. They hit their peak, and "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" came into play. It's already perfect. Leave it be.
---
I'm really hoping that that event comes back so I can get my own pretty butterfly
---
My username is my favorite storybook character tf
---
yes
---
lol I feel more bad for that blitz
---
Wtf is that thing?!
---
Fooking laser bonds
---
If it's a primary weapon then I don't mind. I have a buddy who has black ice on every pistol, but not a single primary. You have never seen a person more bitter when opening a pack.
---
Every time I passed a mirror I panicked
---
Am I wrong or device used in Brazil is actually a prototype of Pulse's scanner?
---
Not boosted plat 2 here, if you play with laser in mind you look at the wall next to the angle you want to cover, which puts you in a disadvantage either way and the recoil reduction is so low it literally makes no difference,  not to mention you're only supposed to use hipfire point blank
---
That's my secret, I'm not a caviera main
---
so im seeing you play on ps4,there is this nice thing on your controller left to your touchpad called the share button, yeah please use that
---
Doubt they'll even get license to add a Swiss army knife.
---
Gridlock. She **thicc**
---
Anything for the picture
---
That would of been sick too, nice try op.
---
I personally use laser on every shotty except Mira’s secondary (for destruction purposes). When you’re holding angles with a laser, you just have to make sure it’s positioned on the door frame (or wherever the enemy won’t see it) then just move it once they enter.
---
Don’t let the streams cross!
---
His shield is already trash lmao I usually just take one bullet from a Jager of something and I'm instantly dead
---
All servers are fine right now ( [Here](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/status/) 
---
So try restarting your ps4 and wait a few minutes before opening siege.
---
Still a better lovestory than twilight
---
Hes got Widowmaker-itis.
---
You cant share to Reddit with that
---
yes usb stick
---
Top is a bit tricky to attack, I think people focus solely on the outside wall which makes it super easy for defenders, in reality there are many way of getting into that site. Attacking kayak is all about the vertical play, get a buck or sledge and open the hatch as well. Have someone drone site while you destroy the floor and once you've flushed them out of site you can drop and plant.
---
Most maps are somewhat defender sided without coordination though.
---
5 seconds left, no way to kill clash, and all of a sudden she dies? Yea that’s not lucky.
---
Why insult the guy because he used a laser sight?
---
Jus restart with uplay. I m in sea too . Its working
---
I'm on mobile Reddit
---
I agree
---
It will be like an episode of power rangers!
---
Just tryna help out newer players
---
Whats up with this sub an its unconditional love for ela?
---
You prefire way too much man. It’s often better to have the “element of surprise” as a defender rather than constantly give away your positioning.
---
How wholesome
---
Huh?
---
I dont mind spawn peeking ! Hey if you want to risk it then feel free in my opinion its up to each player to adapt. The fact a defender can have the advantage is what gets me wether it be the ability of time on there side of setting up before being shown as outside and getting the angle advantage, that infuriates me. At least if it pings immediately it gives the attacker a small chance of going prone.
---
just leave acogs alone god damn it. why yall gotta complain about everything ffs. what do yall want gone next the ability to jump out or shoot outside or what. the variety of long range and close range makes this game different from other games leave the game as it is
---
imagine your sister getting harassed like this. grow up you piece of shit.
---
Wait what is to "with stand" is it some zofia ability or console thing can someone answer?
---
Then why don't they make the M4 variation that they already have?
---
I love the elite sledge club
---
Thank you :)
---
It’s always Ash
---
Probably coastline, this way you can just pick bedroom/cinema. You also have kids bedroom on Oregon
---
What is the skin name?
---
This is why you should drone first before entering
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
Wow
---
You forgot 4.
---
4.  The attackers are absolutely brainless.  Zofia has concussion grenades, Sledge has grenades (or flashes, either would work,) and Lion and Thermite both have a claymore (for the drone hole) or flashes.
---
Sad Monty noises

Something i just got from another redditor on r/dankmemes. Just for a dank comment i did

It was actually 'sat' sorry for bad grammar I'm too lazy to edit

Flair checks out

AND JAGER GETS HIS ACOG
---
Yea Ur not wrong
---
Ace, not a 1v5 as your team was still alive, nice tho
---
that would be interesting to play
---
Again I don't plan on making a career out of this. I can get my message though as is. Toxic Jager main
---
Gj
---
I mean you're right. But people get banned for my last comment all the time.
---
Lol u right
---
Aiming whit them its not a joke, i used to have and acog on all attack weapons and i was so terrible, i cant see shit and managed the information you have inside and outside that is so blur, you are deadly though if you managed to control the recoil and the precision
---
It's actually surprisingly easy. If your data is in the cloud or local \[without the cloud\], try transferring it to a new account on your console.
---
I’m looking more at her ability, and she looks pretty cool. I’m also a big shotgun fan, so if it’s good, I’ll go with her then. Thank you!
---
Nah no issues. Keyboards are notorious for typos these days.
---
This is cute af
---
her shotgun is too easy
---
How the fuck is playing jager toxic
---
her sniper* u mean
---
First of many people can and have gotten hundreds of hours of enjoyment in single player games (myself included)
---
Also, I assure Ubisoft is not in a shortage of cash. All they’re doing is over monetizing all their games (even their single player games) to the point where the store is getting more emphasis than the actual game. And a good chick of that money is just going to go into the pockets of the executives at the top.
---
its bucks
---
Someone's new to siege
---
none of those ops have frags tho.  At most Zo coulda tossed some concussions in there maybe.
---
70 ping isn’t even that bad.  That can happen between WUS and EUS.
---
you can't see a guy prone under the window from the drone hole though.
---
No been playing a year
---
Someone hung themselves and their spirit is haunting you.
---
Sledge
---
I don't play much pc but to what I've seen Console is waaaay more toxic
---
was there a sledge in there? I thought it was Mav, Zo, Thatch, Lion, Thermite?
---
It's so frickin cute
---
I always look there when I spawnkill
---
*melee's window*
---
She's very casual. Just a jacket and leggings. 
---
Same with IQ. They're both very easy. All the other ops are kitted out in military gear.

zofia can self revive to 5 health when she gets downed. been like that since she released, except it used to be 1% of total health. it was changed to 5% because in custom games with 50 or 25 total health, she would have less than 1 and instantly die after self reviving
---
Sigh... *unzips*

Lasers are revealing, I've gotten a cuppl kills with that 😂👌

Honestly though, I use a controller on PC so I have to disagree with this.

Turn it into a displate
---
Hackers get skins that havent come out yet. That's how a lot of elite skins get leaked before they're out
---
He is hacking, probably not a good one since hes not MVP.
---
Excuse the format of the title, I’m still relatively new to formatting on Reddit
---
Hackers have been able to get unreleased skins, like Ela's elite and the Halloween skins
---
To be honest. They should be embarrassed.
---
Thts the idea I got from the Hammer and Scalpel video..... after the attack was over both thatcher and dokkaebi returned to a attacker lockers ( zone maybe?) like you return to lockers after playing basketball ...felt like they were training to me
---
no
---
i love this
---
You know it
---
Why not
---
That's actually a great idea
---

---
If you're console you're stuck with it but there's some kind of bloom effect on pc you can change in the settings

Damn that’s pretty fucking cool. Editing the map mid game is always interesting

Thank you!

Still waiting on the R4-C black ice i m lvl 377 btw
---
Good job. Now Ubisoft are gonna remove it lol
---
Yea, its pretty sick what it can do
---
What platform
---
Best advice is just go into a terrorist hunt, don't worry about dying. Just try do the quick qe peaks. It just takes time. If you would rather change the keys to something more comfortable then definitely do so. My keybinds are quite odd to some people but its just more comfortable to me
---
My only thing with that is ads with most pistols are pretty accurate
---
ah, I understood that after thinking it via overwolf since it calculate the sum of elo of each team.

Touché. Frosts with a muzzle brake is a fucking laser.
---
i especialy like the moment where you win the round
---
Yes. He doesn’t
---
but with this he cant stand in the smoke and kill everyone, i forgot to include it in the post because it was late when i made it, but he would also have to be X distance from the smoke to see through it
---
Basically I think it’s when you have a 4 stack and they lag out. It’s happens to me and we were able to join back
---
Thanks lol unfortunately I changed my gamer tag as no one would get that king of the hill references 😂😂 my Xbox GT is: xKILLERx 753
---
Are you me? 😂 I'm blind as a bat too.  I can wear contacts though.
---
Dude there's hundreds although I'm told there's typically 8-10 without even looking. I see a bluey, reddy and a yellowy!
---
Yea also with frost if I'm using her shotgun I'd rather have the laser on that and then I can safely peek with the pistol without the sight so I don't get countered as easily
---
What are your key binds?
---
Yeah but why. What utility does it provide
---
Gotta love 3 armors
---
....shit
---
They probably spent more on copyright use of the operators than their actual toys

God you're so funny holy shit
---
My keyboard is normal, but I have a third main buttob on my mouse with 12 small ones, so my right ring finger does my gadget and my right thumb is what chabges my weapons. My friends hate it and constantly tell me to change it. But I've played like this for 9 months now so I can't break the habit.
---
You forgot to mention your platform bud
---
Never gets old
---
Sure, but compared to other ops she has nothing. Jeans. Sweatshirt, helmet
---
Imagine holding down site and all you see is Mister B A G U E T T E hauling ass towards you.
---
But thanks
---
Yes i have submited a support case and the steps didnt help
---
I tried. It downed them and then I died. (Reverse friendly fire wasn’t on)
---
I mean yeah but these would be super specific ops. Most sites are good with 10 reinforcements in mind and that's how they design the maps (besides favela). And the floor gadget would only be useful on like 4 objs, and completely useless on 2nd floor objs.
---
Also 5x5 what? Meters? Cause that's a large area about would be hard to place in small areas where it could be useful.
---
Makes hip fireing a tiny bit more accurate, and I think it also tightens up shotgun spread, but I'm not sure about that last one .
---
So your first one is a smaller reinforcement??
---
The second one on 3/4 of obj it will be useless because you already have enough reinforcements.
---
I had always thought about this and I fully support this
---
He starts screaming: EXCUSEZ NOHS MONSIEUR DO YOU SPEAK LE BAGGUTE?!

No, it needs to be like a little bit further because otherwise the lesion will be activated before the frost.
---
He's just annoying and it feel bad to be punish by 'using foot'
---
Ur laser is a cat chasing the other lazer
---
It's a reinforcement that denies vertical play.
---
On almost every site I want a few more reinforcements for all my comp strats. For example I want to be able to reinforce more of theatre on club for a hookah defense, I would like a few more in server on border for armory etc. Allowing you to make more defendable positions to waste attackers time.
---
There are only 3 factors that affect your elo loss/gain:
---
1) whether you win or lose
---
2) your team’s average elo vs enemy team’s average
---
3) how many matches you’ve played in the season
---
And your starting point of each season is halfway between silver 1 and last season’s ending elo.
---
Yes, hacked a H U MA N
---
So are we just not gonna talk about what happened with the blitz?
---
Well they fixed the sprinklers in bank but I haven't noticed any other issues besides, DO NOT BOARD THE HELICOPTER, but u can just shoot it out. And the alarms on skyscraper.
---
Feet. I was thinking it could spiral out like gridlocks grenades. Also there are handy second floor holds as well. Half wall in armory for example would now be safer, or a mirror on armory wall, spots like that. 
---
The extra reinforcements come more from a comp perspective than a ranked one.
---
This is me every time i play Lesion
---
Oh okay i understand now the first, yeah it could be nice but should have only 1 MAX 2 otherwise it will be too strong.
---
Personally I rarely have problems reinforcing all the important walls. There’s only 1 wall that you need to reinforce in server that help you defend armory on border.
---
My favorite gun is the SMG-11 because it’s fun to use and compensates for my bad aim.
---
Bad situation. I can only say that your teammates are very good)
---
Shouldn't ranking up only happen when you win more than 50% of your games? Because winning 50% of your games means you are equal to your current opposition, why would you rank up?
---
It is the same points that you lose and gain however it is varied by the comparative rank between the teams. So if your team is on average ranked lower you will gain more if you win and less if you lose. And vice versa. 
---
Scoring has no impact whatsoever on the MMR you receive or lose. There are so many factors that contribute to a lose or win that are not captured by the scoring system that using score for your mmr gain or lose would be an enormous detriment to the ranking system. 
---
The diminishing returns works very well except for a few cases like yours. It's not really that big of a deal. With 30-40 points gains you can easily still rank up, IF you are actually a plat 1 player. All you need to do is slightly tip the match in your favor and win more than 50% of your matches.
---
You lose 4 team mates
---
Its on safe :)
---
Make their friends look stupid for dying for no reason
---
Oh That'd look dope!
---
Happened to me in a placement match , they were not cool and they completely destroyed me
---
Blackbeard is my main. Shield saving the life if you have a good reaction. It really helps.
---
Probably would lead to confusion for new players, since yellow is mostly GSG-9, so the call outs would be incorrect at times.
---
But i love the concept, at least it would be a bit more rewarding for buying an elite/a PL set.
---
Individual psych profiles and bios do mention interactions, but no, we don't have an interaction only page.
---
Welp thats siege for you and also he is not wrong about the aim part it is trash
---
Or you could just aim and kill each of those targets with a single head shot...
---
You know what im kind of mad at you but you have whatever opinion you want i won't interfere with that but you like edging.
---
AHAHAHAAHAHHAA
---
On attack.
---
With the super 90.
---
Sounds fun.
---
I'm actually just a silver 1 and gold 4 kinda guy
---
If your new to the game how do you know the map so well
---
People's dream of castle on attack would finally become a reality.

best idea

---
To tk teammates
---
My character didn't always have his leg up - Like 5 seconds into watching myself, it randomly went up.
---
Wayyy too much on the effects, just plain ass gameplay wouldve been better. But if you really do want some effects in there i would just go for fade-ins and fade-outs.
---
i play Siege because Battlefield series has become shit. once it becomes good again, if it ever does, i will delete Siege immediately. this game is just too frustrating.
---
I’ve done this before in secure area but injure is 20 hp point is I had to hit gridlock 7 times for it to work but I was laughing so hard
---
Yeah, it's weird, her glasses activate when she throws a candela but for some reason she doesn't know how to activate them otherwise
---
He was a blacbeard he deserved it
---
It's a good and bad idea. I like the concept but not the finishing. Maybe instead it could have an E for elite on the top or something like that. I don't like how it cancels out the color coding part of the operators tho.
---
Yee
---
I think if you equip pro league uniform the gray background could be different maybe
---
I am you, you are I
---
It's actually fun, requires strategies, and not boring or repetitive like call of duty or csgo where you run down the same three routes over and over.
---
because i want to get better at the game and show my friends that i am good in atleast one game
---
Yeah
---
Oh yos! Initiate Russian party button!
---
I honestly don't know. I hate the game, my few friends are straying from it. But I keep playing. 
---
Probably because of Tachanka.
---
Poor quality but something like this? https://imgur.com/gallery/qf5uc4w

Innovation, Siege is one game where every round is different, every moment is a learning lesson, and actually stimulates your mind to compete against the other players. It’s not cod with pointless drop-shots and the same thing over and over, expecting a change. Siege is far more complex and harder to really unravel or master than any game I’ve played, there’s no real definite way of playing because there’s tons of ways to play the game.
---
Aww, somebody didn't know about the longer defuse time
---
Dokkebi would be kinda useless though
---
Thanks! I'm a slut for customization stuff in games and color swap is always my first idea lol
---
Ok that'd be really good! Nice one.
---
I'm assuming the yellow/gold looks greenish because of the quality drop?
---
Or how about that, but swap out the white with the colour of its CTU etc FBI swat is orange, black and gold outlines
---
Now you mention it, how did Warden find the lens to counter Ying’s candela?
---
I enjoy people telling me I’m trash
---
im not 100% but i think ubi said their stance somewhere on a post . im sure its google able
---
Yeah i did with some free online editor lol
---
I'm not sure this is good. The Icons make is easy to identify your teammates, for example through walls. Giving them all similar colours might be confusing.
---
I'd like a preferred operator system set it up on the main menu with I'd say 3 or 4 ops you like and if none are available it goes to random pick
---
OMG this is why it hasnt been working. I didnt know I had to go to that site.
---
A favorite op system could be instilled like that as well and it will pick out of whatever ops you have favorited just like you said
---
Perfect
---
I've had a couple rocket league games where we just tried to stack all the cars on top of each other, instead of trying to win
---
Not just auto off, it's impossible to turn on
---
Possibly, three other guys lagged out too as soon as the game started so it became a 5v2
---
You're weird if you bought this game and don't play PvP...
---
If anything the elite icons should have their normal colors with like a gold border or something
---
wut
---
Nice
---
Yeah I think most people didn't even think of that
---

---
Not that old, house was removed from casual beginning of the season
---
Bro you got OneDrive app to save videos from and the Xbox App itself to save videos from it's so easy to upload screen recordings now
---
Not a new idea, but a good idea that needs to gain some actual traction.
---
Please don't. Its just a lifestyle I choose to live. #MakeTheRecruitGreatAgain
---
Please stop flashing the score board. It makes the video hard to watch
---
Spawnpeeking on Plane is very much a double edged sword. It's easy to kill attackers because they are so exposed when they spawn but it's very obvious where defenders will spawnpeek since there are so few exits on that map
---
anything like that for Ps4?
---
I’m fairly new to the r6 scene a reddit aha sorry !
---
Wow, that sucks. What rank is this?
---
Yah it’s a bad habit sorry
---
Well, that's your opinion, and I am glad that you took the time to type that. Really helps with the debate.
---
LIERRR!!!
---
Well it boils to down to being ubisofts fault for putting those files in game to begin with
---
Nothing to be sorry about. Its a good idea, and i cant work out why it hasnt been implemented like said in the thread, why not add a 5 attack 5 defence favourites list so you can always have an op you would prefer
---
The problem is that your’e playing on console.
---
Finally someone agrees with me!
---
Do the elite with gold and none for pro league since you can mismatch cosmetics with the pro skins
---
Not even a woosh dumbass 🤦🏻🤣
---
Is a screenshot of the screenshot of my game
---
Next time you struggle to get in the game just Google search r6 servers - it takes you to a Web link where it says if there is any issues with their servers and specifys if its xbox/ps4/pc.
---
I rushed in and killed all the ones on the first floor and then waited in dining by the ammo crate while all of them pushing me
---
The biggest thing seige needs is a cancel match if the game starts an a leaver happens immediately. Overwatch is a perfect example.
---
I think he's pretty damn good too, but the only qualm with him is he has to be on site to get the most use of his gadget, if he tries pre-placing it, it will just get shot by Twitch or hit by a Thatcher way too easily.
---
Did they play nice?
---
These were randoms. I have friends I play ranked with but none were on
---
Ohhhh that makes a lot of sense, so it's like an automatic warden with her own candelas.
---
wooaahh. yep, too high for this, anyways Recruit team plays are the best, or just using recruit in general and actually laying waste to the enemy team is the best thing ever.
---
The same thing could be said about Jager? Hos gadget can be easily destroyed, just like bandits. I see no reason to put Electric Jager on different rank than normal Jager.
---
Honestly it is a nice idea and a nice concept👍... it would be very cool also that in the pre match it would show the operator in full view with relative custom skin.
---
Nope went for the quick win, never lost mmr so fast in my life
---
oowee is neat.
---
Only thing i would change, have a tachanka as well so you have the LORD and his 4 horseman
---
Not as cute as you
---
Magic
---
I know where ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yea
---
- New legendaries.
---
- Blood Orchid uniforms and headgears and Skull Rain / Red Crow / Velvet Shell headgears back.
---
- Stuff from old bundles that didn't drop in the old loot pool like non-legendary uniforms (this is new) and some skins for the GEO and SDU from existing bundles that didn't drop on ap.
---
More orange, probably
---
In my opinion it only means much at the extreme lows. If someone has like, eh I don’t know, 0.75 or below I feel you can be pretty sure that they’re bad. Aside from that, there can be a lot of factors contributing to whatever your K/D is.
---
And on attack you change the LORD for fuze
---
Yikes, would have been cool to do multiple 1v1s every round. They would still win most likely but then you'd at least have a chance.
---
Don't tease me, love. 😘
---
Aye, you’re fucked.
---
Sick
---
At least crop it first
---
She had flashbangs and breach, they changed the flashbangs for claymores because she was too powerful with the flashes.
---
The ended up giving her flashes back because she was too powerful covering flanks (duh)
---
We live in a society
---
At least he got the meat wall achievement
---
For me personally I don’t main anybody, because I found it to be the best move to be able to pick anybody and be proficient with them. That being said I understand where you are coming from. There is a larger diversity of defender gadgets as opposed to attack ones mainly because attackers are meant to be offensive so their gadgets are supposed to help them get into the building and destroy enemy defenses. There hasn’t been a new concepts for attacker gadgets up until Nomad was introduced and from there onward they have been starting to pump out attackers with different abilities, even if they are situational like Amaru is. Gove it time and I would like to think they will continue this trend and there will be more attackers that catch the eyes of people when they are deciding who to buy, pick, and play.
---
This is when two monitors really show their potential
---
Just a bit of background: Had to lower the resolution to 720p in order to even upload this here. I have previous submissions that were in 1080p, but that was back when I had internet that was a bit better. Now, my internet is bad enough that my previous uploads for this timed out before the upload could complete. :P Hooray for crap-tier bundles.
---
Jager has a bulletproof camera too tho, and you will either have to: A. play verticality to destroy them, B. burn ADS, C. have an IQ, which is why one reason she is also in S.
---
You could also just drone in and find them to EMP them, but now you have x less EMP's and hard breaching is going to be harder.
---
Edit - forgot to mention Twitch.
---
I too have purchased more attackers. I have more fun with the attackers like maverick but I love playing with people like mute and bandit on defense. No matter what defender I use, I feel like I’m at no disadvantage.
---
You’re fucking with me lol
