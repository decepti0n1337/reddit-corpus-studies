If there is no way to counter the bugs, might as well give them a taste of their own medicine. Besides, we‚Äôre not doing the bug unless an enemy does it
---
It's a bit different
---
Probably 3 speed. Who knows tho
---
It absolutely happens.
---
The game hasn't aimed to be realistic for a long time, and personally I think that's fine. If Siege was just filled with generic army men 24/7 no one would be interested and visually it'd be too boring.
---
The fact that Rainbow showcases a variety of characters with different appearance is one of the many aspects that makes it great, imo.
---
its the same glitch u can do it with just about anyone with a shield. expect echo
---
Needs the vigil drone overlay.
---
that looks like 0 brightness lmao
---
Jager doesn‚Äôt have an acog
---
vigil means staying awake especially at night and like watching over people and shit, so that kinda references his back story of being from north Korea iirc.
---
 ig J√§ger could make sense cuz he kinda hunts the attackers projectiles and shoots them. 
---
As for Zofia, it's the polish version of Sophia which means wisdom. So that kinda references her character especially in contrast to her younger sister ela.
---
Gotta sell season passes somehow.
---
Wallhacks &amp; recoil macros would have sounded stupid to people two years ago...
---
Are you fucking blind? You must be a special type of retarded to not see the glitch being exploited.

Trust me dog. Nobody's gonna miss Clash or Deployable shields. And this is coming from someone who using the deployable shield religiously
---
See there's a difference between playing strategically, and holding the same angle for 1 1/2 minutes while the defuser is on the other side of the map, and going to get it when there's 15 seconds left.
---
Yeah I know!! I saw that it made me upset in the stomach
---
Dont know for sure but Id guess thats the case, we will know for sure soon enough.
---
~~Been there~~ am there. I feel you
---
They will not get banned, they never ban for abusing a glitch
---
I saw the Nokk teaser on Twitter so they combined cav, vigil, and the girl from the ring into an operator on attack. I'm gonna shit myself when SATAN WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE BREACHES INTO MY ROOM.
---
Somewhat. My pops is a military historian. And i wasnt trying to be like ‚Äú MaH ReAlIsm‚Äù i was just genuinely surprised
---
Sorry. I‚Äôm busy right now and I just read it quickly and responded from my phone. I‚Äôll edit it
---
Is Nokk Danish or something
---
Is it just me or does N√∏kk sound more norwegian than danish??
---
I bet if the report button actually worked that would be something
---
Let's never forget the Ballad of King Buttfucker.
---
People already complain too much about not hearing attackers and such get ready for this mf to pop out and shit on your whole team

I do not need to sexualise my pillows. I like them normal.
---
I dont know, the Dollar Flu and the Dark zone are really good story points, that and the rouge agents and hunters are all very appealing ''Bad guys'' to me. The narrative of the games are very skewed as most people dont listen to all the extra content and whatnot and all they get from the story are the pretty crappy cutscenes and the choppy radio chatter during missions. That aside however, it was just a comparison on how the equipment looks similar to the ISAC watch piece, no need to break out the capslock.
---
DIE DIE DIE?

Ying, flashbangs, claymores, nades vertical play.

its no good

---
Take away IQs claymore. Poof. Problem solved.
---
Disable deployable shields. Problem solved.
---
As for Clash, you can just get rid of her all together.
---
I really enjoy meming clash though with the flip strat... I say remove her ability to pick up barbed wire that has been placed already
---
From that video it sounds almost like Nook, but with more of an uh sound. Interesting
---
In these cases they should just disable the broken chars until they have a fix
---
Yea that‚Äôs fair, I usually play buck and Sledge from above. Maybe IQ and Thatcher could be closer
---
Am not there. But existance is pain. I hope your life gets better
---
Report the players, ubisoft suspended a large amount of people abusing it on xbox last night (:
---
And Maestro
---
(I've no idea your genders so...) I pronounce you, married
---
Look's more like the girl from 'The Ring'
---
The Neanderthal society is too underrepresented in this game, the only one of that race is Ash. Therefore, we need more of them, Swedish people don't even exist lol
---
Unfortunately it can‚Äôt be transferred
---
It‚Äôs okay, I get it *wink*
---
ah fuck
---
Its what I feared the most after seeing the trailer..
---
Game been out for 5 or 6 years already..  it's easy to get new operators so don't think your missing out of you don't get the "premium edition"

Her name is Attacker Vigil and there's nothing you can do to change my fucking mind
---
And is a division agent
---
Ok
---
Ubisoft doesn't  ban for toxic.  They just have report buttons.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
It will next week
---
*I‚Äôm the spook bitch now*

Should I just get the cheapest edition possible then? I‚Äôm not gonna be a hardcore player in any event but would I be at a disadvantage then?
---
Here's a funny thing about artists: untill you pay them, they can and will draw what ever they want.
---
Also, there are probably a ton of female artists out there that like to draw the male ops as well, though I don't quite understand why the gender of the artist is important when looking for cool art
---
They will ‚Äúreview‚Äù it (if at all) and then leave it at that.
---
My whole squad did
---
Not to mention server connection errors
---
Look I know it‚Äôs the Denmark op but I just thought it kinda looked like the division watch
---
Nothing to do with nokk but I would like a atk op that can blend into any wall/floor for a couple of seconds but can only use pistol
---
I couldn't agree more I just went up against a team exploiting just about anything they could to win after we stopped them the first couple rounds
---
Good. Had the same issue a few days ago
---
Just imagine the memes
---
r/thathappened
---
Yeah it happens way to much,  you enter a game and half your team dies in the first 10seconds and get pissed off at you for living and playing. The community as a whole is very toxic in R6S. Trolls, Griefers, Clash Exploiters, hackers and team killers. The game really hasn't changed much in 3-4years.
---
This is why traps are the best friend for a defender

---
True, lmao
---
how about my smurf on console?
---
and they say r6 isnt a horror game
---
It's the gaming community in general. It's just toxic as fuck. When siege really blew up the community went downhill
---
for christ sakes what guns does she have first a five seven now this
---
Oh, I'm sorry I forgot some people need an op who can hit a button to help them control the already non-existent recoil on their gun.
---
Save the occasional Castle barricade or exterior maestro cam Sledge is a worse Buck, change my mind.
---
As much as I love fuze, he's bad as a 3 armor and his gadget is quite situational/risky in competitive play.
---
As for a serious discussion on her viability, I'll say it heavily depends on her visibility to evil/black eyes and echo drones, and what she can do when hidden. If she can cloak and do some actions (for example, plant) that will have massive effects on the meta for certain sites, especially when coupled with bans on other forms of information gathering (Mira, lesion)
---
If you left because crouch and lean spamming you might want to wait until the current glitches get patched. But you should absolutely give it a shot again!
---
Some people on consoles use additional hardware to access KB/M because they're trash with a controller but want easy wins.
---
Some chew on toothpicks
---
Is it for sure a supressed deagle tho? Havent taken a good look at the gun but thats an in game screenshot of her character model, so id thats what it is, then its what shes got. Its not concept art or anything
---
Thought she had a deagle...
---
How is that related to my reply?You said how did hello read that fast even though it‚Äôs like not that much and he commented 4 minutes after you posted so unless you know exactly when he started reading that‚Äôs actually really wrong. I love reading so you misinterpreted

Jesus fuck man. Get a hold of yourself the game isn‚Äôt that bad. And fuck dude it‚Äôs an exploit, not a single game developer has ever fixed a bug overnight, and if people are exploiting the game, then I‚Äôd say 99/100 times it‚Äôs the abuser‚Äôs fault and not the devs

i enjoy this theory, could be an interesting dynamic and considering how defense has so many intel tools now.

It would make defenders think twice about what they see on cams, its something of which we haven't really seen yet in-game. Vigil is the closest thing to this theory we have so far

It‚Äôs embarrassing

If you like ash you might like zofia, shes basically ash but with quicker and quieter breaching, and concussion grenades as a bonus

Might wanna grab your grains of salt cuz Alibi had a Beretta in her early promotional stuff, even though she has never had access to that gun in the live game

That's.. not really true.

[It's definitely doable.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/BvWnxG)
---
That'll run Siege at 60fps easily, and it'll likely do it on medium-high. Only thing it's missing is Windows and an HDD. Can get Windows 10 from /r/microsoftsoftwareswap for another $40, or deal with the watermark. I'm somewhat assuming you've got an old PC lying around you can yak an HDD from, or if you have to buy one that's another $50.
---
Obviously more would be better- even another $100 on that build would see a fairly massive performance difference. Hell, shelling out another $40 on RAM would be significant.
---
All they deserve
---
Well one I replied to you since you gave the time. Two if the article came out 13 minutes ago and he commented 10 minutes ago it took him 3 minutes. Why are you overreacting to a joke as well? And if you love reading I made a book but that's not the point. You're overreacting buddy calm down will ya?
---
You're a good man Theon
---
Thank you
---
Err I mean what?
---
That's her operator select screen art I'm talking about the CGI trailer, Alibi had her MX4 Storm in her CGI trailer with her holograms and that's one of her primaries in game, The SIX12 is one of Nokk's primary weapons and the secondary is a suppressed deagle since it's showed in the CGI.
---
Her other is likely an assault rifle or DMR.
---
do you not have phones ?
---
Lesion is always a good choice. Helps gather Intel as well as damage and slow down. If you play bomb, he can also screw a team over from planting if they wait till the last seconds and hit a gu mine. Can't plant while while the gu needle is still in. I'm sure he'll get a nerf somewhere down the line for alot of the things I just mentioned, but as of now, he's a solid choice. Also primary is pretty decent. Just feel like you have to go for headshots with his gun.
---
cheater but i respect the acog on the AUG i mean that's what i put on her
---
Her headgear reminded me of Dead by Daylight's Nurse's Bride outfit.
---
Other than that, I'm hyped for her. Seems like a pretty interesting Operator!
---
If you keep your minds and use them more actively instead of passively she becomes far more dangerous as a roamer. Especially if your number one goal is to delay the attackers for as long as possible.
---
It‚Äôs not an in game screenshot unless she has the exact same animations as cav
---
Big tiddie anime girl?
---
F
---
skeleton castle
---
That's maybe, 7/10 people on ps4 when its a 1vX, and it's beyond infuriating, its even better when it's secure, and they pull the same shit, only for either the timer to run out right before they get in the room, or they spend too much effort on getting into the room before time runs out, that they either hit traps, or get domed as soon as they get in the room.
---
Its literally an in game screenshot, its how they do theor trailers and stuff obviously with dev tools and whatnot. Shes mid animation because shes crouched down in some typw of stealth ani, just like caveiras when her ability is activated
---
Yeah IQ‚Äôs are having a field day with this shit lately. I just don‚Äôt get it, how is it fun? Or satisfying? Knowing you‚Äôre not winning based off your own skill but having to exploit &amp; glitch in order to win/get kills?
---
Is that confirmed? I thought there were some parts in the trailer that looked more like active camo from Halo

&gt; They need to block external chat as well. So you are forced to be in game chat.
---
This I don't like. The rest of it, fine, and maybe even this in ranked. But in casual? No.
---
Er yes it is, 9/10 games people are glitching so it‚Äôs unplayable. I blame the people exploiting it but it‚Äôs still ubisofts responsibility to fix it. Don‚Äôt understand why you are defending it. Cretin
---
I doubt they would give her old ctus weapons
---
You miss the point that one her secondary gadgets don't fit with her in anyway or form. Two that every other roamer has a choice for weaponry and range she doesn't. It's not about her mines because either way you use them they still won't be as effective as they really should be and you likely will not get that full 10 anyways. Every op has either a carbine/smg and a shotgun. Giving them the option of whether they want to specialize in close or long range. Ela is only given close range guns and that's Ubi's fault because they overnerfed Ela and won't do anything to fix her. You miss that point very much my good sir.
---
Its really hard to give a shit about a new Season when the game is currently almost functionally unplayable.
---
In real life I always say the eye for an eye philosophy leaves the whole world blind. But this is rainbow six siege and you can bet your ass I want to shoot that little fuck. He gets to kill me once and doesnt get punished(if he doesnt tk for the rest of the game) but when I want to get my revenge I get punished a second time? Let me shoot him back and I'll be happy, no hard feelings. It's annoying because the only time I get team killed is when someone randomly targets me round 1 in the prep phase. Almost every single time that's when it happens to me. It's not fun sitting out a whole round because of asshole teammates and it's even less fun when you realise you cant get revenge and they just essentially got away with it. After everything is all said and done it is still a video game, but they are made to be enjoyed. Being team killed isnt enjoyable.
---
"You come to me, on the day of my daughters wedding..."
---
I still think Caveira has the advantage over Nokk.  Nokk would still need to create some sound to get inside.
---
&gt;I play on console so I dont want an in game typing chat system. That is stupid.
---
He said a quick chat system. Like Rocket League, or maybe a ping based system like in Apex. Not typing.
---
yep
---

Anyone recall the gears of war slide and grab glitch?   Was that hacking?  It was just a button combo.

yeah its a six12sd watch coreross's video. leaks also rumored n√∏kk would have a galil variant and a scar with a new scope
---
She is a frogman. The Danes have the jaeger corps, which is their army special forces, and the Frogmen, which is their navy special forces
---
A division agent? Looks like the ISAC watch.
---
Do we know its a she? Because N√∏kk is male. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_(water_spirit)
---
Yes (lenny face)
---
Queued. Ended up surrendering üò≠
---
Remember when that leak about  a month ago said that she will be a "cute fan-favorite." I don't know about you but I'm seeing exactly that
---
Damn getting some real Predator vibes here, looking like Wolf from Requiem
---
You otta have Mute react to N√∏kk because she did the silence thing with her finger too

Stop playing the game as well.

Vigils cousin ....

Easily the craziest shot I've ever seen. Wow.
---
That‚Äôs a really cold idea. I also think she will be silent like cav for two reasons. 1. She poses like cav in the thumbnail. 2. When she moves through the water, she goes invisible but you can see her wading in the water but shorty after you don‚Äôt see anything at all...

Not just jager but Mira, rook, maestro, tatanchka, can do it as well I think I‚Äôm missing one more op tho

Everything in clip is still possible with RFF. Its the first round

Except this looks exactly like that

You are a moron. With no knowledge or info to back up what your saying your only reasoning is "well they made it they should know how to fix it" well they do. But have you ever coded? Have you ever gone through hundreds if not THOUSENDS of lines of code just to find a mistake with a couple of lines? You have no idea what it takes to actually fix something like this your logic is flawed to it's core because your operating under the assumption they can just pop in change a could things then boom all better. This is a game that receives a new content update update every three months DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND THE PURE VOLUME OF CODE THAT IS that is hundreds of new lines of code that have to be gone over and double, triple and even quadruple checked. And those lines of code may be fine but when implimented in to the game it could cause completely new bug or cause old ones to pop up again. You have no idea what your talking about SO HOW ABOUT YOUR KEEP YOUR IGNORANT FUCKING MOUTH SHUT DUMB ASS
---
Doing me a hard quit to desktop with that one
---
Well you may be one of the only people on the entire siege community to ever want to contribute to a conversation.

That was haunting. A plague version appears in the tower of mice quest too.

What the actual fuck, I've only been off of siege for a day and then this and the shield glitches happen looks like I'm taking an extended break see y'all next season!

Whether or not i play Siege, im still a gamer. When discussing games and theories, being a hater gets nothing done and leaves a poor taste attached to your name.

I played from beta and now i really don't like this game AT ALL. I took two months off and fired it back up last week and it's just not fun. I think i'm just going to uninstall and play something else. It was fun while it lasted. They really messed it up.

There‚Äôs a glitch that makes IQ invisible and her player model stays in spawn the whole time while she goes and knifes everyone

Should you use a laser on Buck‚Äôs C8 because it decreases the Skeleton Key spread?

Wanna know a game that's a lot more complex than siege, and yet has a better experience and a less glitchy experience as well. War Thunder. Only came out a year after Siege, has better graphics, bigger maps, more destruction, more details and little bobs to the maps, needs to load all textures and broken objects when one is broken for all players in a server, very highly detailed vehicles that are almost at 1000 in it's state. Ground forces by itself has 490 detailed vehicles with their own separate armour values and penetration factors for each type of shell. Shooting in the game is much more complex as unlike siege it has bullet time. And like siege one shotting is key but in war thunder is even more necessary as if you don't one shot you're likely fucked, it also requires you to have a very precise angle and correct shot placement to pen the correct amount of armour. Physics are a lot more realistic in war thunder than in siege, gameplay is smoother, fps isn't as laggy. Depending on the nation matchmaking queues are much faster. And has 4 different types of vehicles, tanks, ships, planes, and helicopters, which add up to about 1000 vehicles like I said. War thunder did that in only 2 and a half years siege is only hitting 40 op's by now. And War Thunder has to balance a lot more vehicles than just a measly 42 characters, and the game is more stable in that sense as well. Oh and did I mention War Thunder is free? And let's you play the game completely without spending a dime? And let's you earn premium currency through wagers. Premium vehicles are balanced out as they only help research the tier below and above them by one. That's a more complex game in every sense, and has gone much much farther than Siege. Oh and has a patch about every week to fix the smallest of issues. And ubisoft is a much bigger studio than Gaijin, yet fail to ever listen to the actual community.

If only they had a stance of punishing willful glitch abusers. But they don't so we all live in this horrible situation Ubi made.

It might be, but im good enough at the game imo. I used to be really good a year back but I got burned out of playing this and im back now and been practicing. But lo and behold after the few months of playing. Im already getting tired of this. Maybe I'm a whiney bitch, im not sure cause trust me I was good. Star of my friends r6 team.

Hello HumanitarianCannibal, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bp729o/strange_mute_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Apparently its pronounced closer to nook as well?
---
Or NOUGHK or something?
---
Its not an unnatural or unfair advantage. Else you cpupd say using any different input device is cheating. And the course is clear anyways: Consoles are folding to allow more input devices.
---
Using KB+M on a cobsole gives an advantage. Yes
---
 But no unfair advantage. You still have to aim yourself. If you say KB+M on console is cheating, you would also need to say using a controller in a fighting game on PC is cheating.
---
She becomes invisible and most people (99.9999%) use it for personal gain. The few that are nice (0.0001%) make it a battle royale amongst the other team before throwing
---
Lol I'm not as entitled as you think, I was mostly exaggerating and using one semi-rare instance as a basis for my point. That being said I do think that I shouldnt be punished twice as bad when the person who did the first tk is only punished slightly. I love the new system and have been asking for it forever now but I think if you dont have reverse friendly fire(RFF) on you shouldnt take damage, even if you shoot someone who has it on. Once you tk though I firmly believe if it wasnt forgiven you need RFF turned on. 
---
As of right now if your teammate is toxic and team kills he will get RFF turned on, but later on in the round if you accidentally hit him you will be taking damage or you might even kill yourself. That's not fair to good players who follow the rules. Yes, toxicity doesnt solve toxicity but there are some people who need that frontier justice. Imo that's a win win, and if you go past eye for an eye and decide to kill them again then you will get kicked. Perfectly balanced, something something thanos.
---
Obviously it occurred to me....but traditionally the choice has been play casual and get TK'd by 11year olds or play ranked.  Now ranked is infested with shitty antics too. Despite my whiny post I don't care about my rank...not a dick measuring contest for me....just a way to queue up with people of a similar skill level
---
I'm convinced N√∏kk is just a dementor
---
Didn't even know that was a thing. Is this something that's popped up in the last couple weeks?
---
I know how you feel mate! I felt the exact same way with this game and overwatch (I dont uninstall them for the fact that if I ever want to play them again redownlading would take ages lol), what you said in your post is the reason I've been playing fortnite so much , but as much fun as I have in fortnite it makes me miss the fun times I've had in this game, that's why I'm wanting to get back into it :/, thanks for sharing your experience tho :)
---
Rn it‚Äôs a bug where it looks like she‚Äôs in spawn but she‚Äôs not
---
Last week Overwatch all the sudden wanted to run at 14fps so I‚Äôve been playing siege 
---
Just causal tho and glitches haven‚Äôt been a problem but it‚Äôs also not a challenge
---
You can't expect people to not use glitches. People are assholes and will continue to be assholes. It's up to ubi to patch them.
---
&gt; It's operation health
---
&gt; is a basically a
---
&gt; 3 months period

---
Good of you to help, but don't invoice the guy just yet
---
You mean you can‚Äôt wait to get teamkilled as them?
---
Dementor
---
Ye, it‚Äôs really game breaking
---
Just take a break, if it‚Äôs stressing you out take a breather for a while. This game is known to be very toxic and is known for its bad community.
---
So all PC players are cheating?
---
Dang I feel old. Got siege back in Black Ice and joined reddit during Red Crow for siege too.
---
play casual but don‚Äôt take it seriously AT ALL and play with friends and screw around
---
Go invisible IQ then troll. Of course you gotta throw afterwards to balance it out, but it's fun in secure overtime
---
new op
---
Better ways you could‚Äôve advertised you wanted people to play with mate
---
They can‚Äôt just disable OPs https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/7nv0l1/enough_is_enough_ubi/
---
Hiiii Warden
---
It is not banned by Ubisoft. ToS say nothing against it. And do you want to argue that using a Controller on PC in a fighting game is cheating too?
---
What does f mean
---
Phantom Sight is IMO the best named operation
---
nah mate, I have no problems on xbox LFG
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs a white guy. Unless we get a white Samuel l Jackson.
---
He was talking about console
---
Tbh people don‚Äôt give a fuck about pronouncing the names right, I always get roasted for calling lion ‚ÄúLeon‚Äù, even though that‚Äôs how they say in the French language.
---
That will make the trap meta even more over powered and no one wants this
---
They spent multiple seasons trying to nerf trap ops for a reason
---
damn not even a please
---
I've been away from home for a couple of weeks  so that probs explains why I don't know about it.
---
Invisible IQ, then troll, the only downside is you have to throw afterwards if you have morals, but still
---
I dont really take casual serious, tbh it's the toxicity and bullshit that happens is what ruins the fun for me, I would also play with friends but they have also dipped from the game aswell lol
---
Better not be
---
Her recoil sucks, but there is not a gun in the game in which the recoil is absolutely uncontrollable. It can be managed.
---
( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o) oh boy
---
There is a gamebreaking glitch performed with Clash atm, people probably assume you are going to do it.
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt waste my breath on somebody that dense. Can‚Äôt win with those types. Defeat their argument 5 different ways so they go in circles and look like Stretch Armstrong they‚Äôre reaching so hard.
---
How I died today...at least it was only casual..
---
Seven days
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta and have suffered through the op operators and all the broken glitches like the rest of you. I swear to Christ if this bitch is actually invisible I‚Äôm selling my account and never playing the game again.
---
"Get ya t-shirts :) "
---
Just coming back in time
---
Everything.
---
It's literally a random pattern which does make it uncontrollable in a sense. You can compensate for it but it'll never be perfect. And especislly with how shitty the gun is it's far from it.
---
I dont even get whats the point of posting it on youtube channel? To get it wide spread and gain ubisoft attention is just an excuse in my opinion, bugs are so complicated to get rid of and its not just pressing a button, it takes fucking bunch of time to investigate, just like hacking, its easy to create hack but hard to counter it because the coding is so much complicated. 
---
People like DBL online said his intention is good and grab ubisoft attention but I doubt there is nothing about gaining tons of views. He thinks promoting a glitch can benefit the community to get rid of glitches but its just increasing the amount of people using glitch and ruining everyones game, while Ubisoft is under so much pressure to fix 3 bugs at a time and its not something easy to do.  
---
Not gonna lie, before DBL promote the glitch, almost 9/10 matches no one uses these glitch and 12/14 of my friends dont even know it exist, and now its just chaos and when i ask them where to find the glitch, is always the same guy with a perfect tutorial and pure intention of saving the game from glitches.

Glitching and cheating are two different things.
---
She will be invisible to cameras
---
 Feeling the same way right now. All they need is a hotfix to show they care.
---
Im ready for the Operation Healthier memes
---
Maybe ash‚Äôs r4-c?
---
No they are not. Glitching is exploiting the game to gain unfair advantages over opponents. Cheating is using inside or outside resources in order to gain an unfair advantage over your opponents.
---
Oh yeah, I used it for my post too. I just cropped it.
---
Perhaps? I'll try it out, thanks!
---
Ah I see. Its just the pixels bother me a bit btw neat post
---
One thing I see a lot on attack is people feeling like thy need to use the ACOG. Try experimenting with different attachments. Apart from that, try using Twitch‚Äôs F2 with the sight you usually use on Bandit, I think you‚Äôll like the decent damage and high ROF
---
All im saying is compare this game to others. Bugs of this severity generally dont last 2 weeks in other games. In league the disable bugged champs.  
---
You can suck ubi off all you want but in my book its not acceptable.
---
i think it would be dope if they threw in a mythical monster. Doesnt even have a gun, just fucking drowns and eats people
---
Typically and video games, cheating refers to the use of third-party programs while glitching stems from a developer error. If the game allows it to happen then it‚Äôs not a cheat.
---
I‚Äôll send you the uncropped picture. And yeah; the resolution is a bit bad.
---
Yeah I can't speak for war thunder. I'm sure it also has issues as any game does. It's a shame siege isn't in a better state than it is, but I like to think it will be in a great state without the constant issues and exploits eventually. Till then best we can do is help report the issues as they come in and hope they aren't as game ruining as the ones we have currently.
---
Awesome, I'll try her out!
---
Trial and error, stumbling into it, trying to reproduce it. Most of them likely happen by accident but some people make it their job to find glitches.
---
I think her ability might be that she could touch a camera with her glove (which we see a printing on which might be some kind of tech) and she would be completely invisible, unlike Vigil which has the white fuzz. At the end you can see her touching the camera with the glove, and then it goes black.
---
Just luck
---
Ikr? Finally, some quality fan content that doesn't involve Dokkaebi

It reminded me of the time shift device from titanfall 2. Circle on the left hand, glowing. I really hope I'm not alone on that one.

50 second video? Come on man, trimming is your best friend

All ready have it

I was freaking out !!!
---
I heard her break the barbed wire so I just fired at the door. Didn‚Äôt expect to kill her tbh.
---
The video thumbnail has her holding a silenced deagle that's for sure
---
Nah, more like a bonerfart.
---
dude fck these cunts. why they gotta ruin this game for us.. im so triggerd
---
Ahhhh okay. I have to admit to using that shit but only to kill the god that is known as "exploited clash" :)
---
OP is a hero. I would rather be on his team in the 4v5 then play with a glitch abuser.
---
Hold on.
---
Ok math checks out.
---
Could be, the console community is toxic af
---
NOT BAD!
---
until you do all that work only for an ash to Tokyo drift around that peek and contest obj faster than a mofo
---
A fair point. And honestly, if Nokk or some other op had it, I really wouldn't mind. Ubisoft is losing a fair a bit of believability with stuff like a BIG ASS Australian Woman running around. The Navy Seals don't have women, Poland surely wouldn't have green haired yoga pants wearing ops running around.
---
Personally, I wouldn't mind a fair amount of obscure guns to be around, not every gun needs to be as Iconic as a SPAS-12 or an M4 or a Desert Eagle.
---
I‚Äôm aware of that but still concerned...
---
dude i havent played in four months. and first game i come back to is all 3 damn glitches. ridiculous gonna drop this game for another 4 months. smfh ubi
---
Wait there's a new op? My computer broke so I havent played in while. No idea whats goin on
---
For me playing serious and for that sweet win is the fun, when the game doesn't mean anything to me how can it be thrilling to play?
---
Losing games is hardly bearable except in casual but with the amount of glitching even in Plat elo these days I'm better off not playing ranked or using a smurf so I don't completely lose my mind.
---
I could also just play sekiro...
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 in silver we can play on weekends + fridays!
---
No, but if he went on missions it would.
---
Fucking owned lmao
---
I can 100% lock you down as a 'Truck Freak'
---
Another theory this might be true is that at the end of the teaser you can see NoKK uses the left Arm . The orange glowy one to block the camera. It could be Nokk can actually get into range of any camera and hack it to see enemies. unlike Dokkaebi nokk can only hack when getting into a range of a camera. instead of hacking dead enemies' phones.
---
Yea, I think if they did it right it could be really good and fun to play with just like the AA12 with it‚Äôs huge mag and full auto lol
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna be able to play anymore I get scared way too easily.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

has that color never been used because GIGN have some sorta blue, the JTF2 have light blue.
---
This either means everyone hates eachother or are best friends.

Or both.
---
tHeRe WaZ aH nOtHeR oNe,?,?,
---
Its all good if they use any of the exploits. I tk people for using the exploit and they get pissed so just use montagne for a bit
---
It's really fun the reactions I've gotten for killing one on the list right when the game starts and mnemonic marking their names off
---
I mean its casual if someone wants to try it who cares it just sucks in ranked
---
And not a trebuchet? Pfft. Casual.
---
So is she defense or attack?

What a strange looking barricade
---
Because there‚Äôs no longer the +1 in the chamber
---
Team Killing is as toxic as glitching, it‚Äôs like fighting cancer with another cancer..

How is it a spoiler to post an official info released by Ubisoft?

7th of June probably
---
Can you imagine roaming as Mozzie, droning the room to your left and seeing no one, so you get off your drone and suddenly see one lady with a cloak on her face looking like a fucking Dementor staring into your eyes as she puts one round through your face
---
You. Are. Awesome.
---
All the times I‚Äôve been under those stairs and did not realize there was a hatch until now.
---
"Hey guys what's going on today I'm going to show you how you make Nokk invisible to everyone on the opposite team throughout the whole round"
---
They're different glitches but the overall function is the same. With Clash she has her shield up but shoot with her gun. With others they basically get a deployable shield on their gun.
---
You‚Äôre looking at it wrong.
---
Does the fighting game support MnK as well as controller? 
---
Yes? Then you‚Äôre good to go.
---
No? Then you‚Äôre cheating.
---
Same goes for MnK for Siege.
---
Does Siege support MnK on console? 
---
Nope, it does not. You have to get a third party piece of hardware to get it to work so therefor you are cheating.
---
One of the biggest facts that gets overlooked is controller and MnK is supported on pc. The game detects what input you‚Äôre using and adjusts the recoil accordingly. If you‚Äôre using a controller then the recoil isn‚Äôt half as bad as what it is on MnK.
---
Now, Siege on a console has permanently lowered recoils as IT ONLY SUPPORTS CONTROLLER. Now, plug your MnK in with your XIM and you‚Äôll be playing PC style siege with little to no recoil. THAT is why us console players get shitty, especially when experienced PC MnK players come across to console and don‚Äôt even give us a fighting chance.
---
Nerf him. His torch is silent and he‚Äôs so inconvenient. I‚Äôm killed by people playing maverick the most.
---
he‚Äôs lying.
---
I know but where did they come from
---
so what you are saying is: "Rest in Rest in peace in peace"?
---
Some people who find glitches seek to try those random combinations of actions. A lot of glitches usually follow similar steps, with slight differences. So tehy try everything that is similar in the past. Like the monty/new clash glitch.  But it is nearly impossible to patch one glitch, and have it never resurface at all again. All it takes is someone to be able to find an alternate way to cause the same outcome. Ranked is ass atm, hence why I'm just waiting until a hotfix, or a patch. Shouldn't be too long. And to be honest, the break is nice. Was feeling my aim and gamesense just deteriorating recently, and a break just seems fitting for the next week or so.
---
best to read before you post
---
You truly are a hero. There was a guy on the enemy team in ranked that did this for 3 rounds and I messaged him about it and he just started acting dumb like ‚Äúidk what you are talking about‚Äù or ‚Äú it‚Äôs just lag you sweat‚Äù. Btw I‚Äôm only silver 2 and people are pulling this shit
---
You‚Äôre right hes lying
---
Yeah, Was pretty funny. Thank got I was in low gold elo at the time, and not plat1 like I am now. Would be so bad if you could still do it.
---
I see. So the mag itself is 20+1 bullet in the chamber. Makes sense now. Thanks.
---
Happened so fast, had to watch a second time.
---
Got it. Thanks.
---
This man looks like he's about to sneak into my house at 3am, shoot my dog, kidnap me, then interoogate me for the CIA
---
It's a good way to Escape. You can still sit under it with it open as well. Little ledge left. But the team started tking the next round.
---
The maps are by fare the worst thing in this game. Its like they don't know for what game ther made maps. I mean conpare it to cs:go they paint walls in some corners white only to see enimies better on that spot.
---
Once a prop made a shadow who looked like a persons shadow they removed the prop after a mini "shitstorm".

Thanks, I thought so

We all want new ops, but the problem is it's not easy to just come up with something new thats not in the game yet. though there is a decent amount of concepts going around that are pretty fresh.

Never forget about the one in the chamber. ;)
---
Operation: Predator
---
Lol it was a mix of both...
---
Glitchers get stitches!
---
Agreed.
---
Fixing glitches isn't like flipping a switch and making the problems disappear. There's a whole process to it. Just be a lil patient.
---
I'm honestly really curious to see how Nokk, Vigil, and Caviar mesh when they go live. On console so I'm a month or two in waiting

If I had to guess what N√∏kk‚Äôs device can do, I bet she uses the dust/particles that‚Äôs coming from her device to hack cameras so she can be permanently invisible. But I still think there‚Äôll still be a UI pop up to notify us she‚Äôs nearby like they do now with Vigil
---
Careful, he's a hero
---
I hope you are joking
---
Theres a new one. It is very hard to pull off, since you only have 3 tries but if you do it its pretty gg
---
Why the fuck did someone give this platinum
---
Is this a norwegian operator?
---
Ah, good to know. I thought it was something like N-uh-ck
---
Lmao nokia phone
---
It looks to be a salute lol
---
Kingsman is that you?
---
Is it bad if I use the glitch as a mind game thing. I just play clash normally and rush them and they run the other direction
---
Hold angles on defense, drone on attack before entering unless absolutely sure no one is where you‚Äôre about to enter. The question of who to unlock is a matter of who do you like using at the moment. But yeah the IQ glitch, clash glitch, and deployable shield glitch is really ruining the game for me at the moment.
---
So shes basically the new spooky bitch that said fuck you cav and fuck you vigil, six doesnt need you anymore. 
---
?????
---
Where does it say that?
---
is the black ice for style? or do you not even use the smg?
---
i dont get it... i get it
---
Well I won't be playing Rank today. Lol
---
They are not going after good features they are going after what is needed in the current meta.
---
Is this Naruto?
---
Yesterday I was kn a 4stack and the 5th was doing jager head shield glitch needless to say he didnt get to play a round
---
But Nokk is Danish
---
Glaz can be pretty powerful on bank, hell most maps he‚Äôs pretty powerful
---
Cool.
---
4 months is supposed to be a huge gap or smthn for a 3 year old game? How low are your expectations.
---
Nokk isn't Russian, you know... She's Danish.
---
Nokk
---
Maybe
---
Where in that is there any ‚Äúdebunking ‚Äú going on?
---
I think it would be too unstable. There are so many players who will do it to just be a dick or because of accidents like shooting someone cause they ran in front of you or just choosing a character they wanted.
---
&lt;3
---
He has the space stone.
---
Oh no.
---
A well placed fire bolt from Capito end most shield nightmares
---
Random question feels stupid asking, but what purpose does that net mask around their face have?
---
Its also that these devices have hardware that update regularly so that they are recognised as controllers, i remember a post a few years ago about an official ubi response that they do not infact support these devices. Hell, my cousin bought a strikepack from EB games that works with heaps of shooters, watched him go from not hitting shit for weeks to modding with zero recoil, crouchspam, drop-shotting and auto lean. Theres more than just kb+m thats bad on console but if you need an unofficial device that reads like a controller but plays like a keyboard and mouse that requires 3rd party software when the devs themselves have said its cheating then its probably cheating.
---
Thats a pretty big chunk of time. Games are bound to have bugs and they can‚Äôt be fixed right the fuck away. Have some patience
---
She can go invisible or some shit
---
Gridlock already gets bullied enough lol
---
Why?
---
So if her power was helped by Dokkaebi, and there is reference to the mythical creatures ability to 'mimic cute ones' (i.e. others, not herself), maybe she can make herself look like another (any) character that is in the team currently in cameras...to confuse defenders as to what attacker is going where...

Yeah, I'm so dumb that I'm downvoting every comment, because that'll definitely show me.

And I'm also so dumb, that my argument can be debunked by reading official rules of the game.
---
Blitz has really nice shield skins.
---
Yup
---
I did the same thing
---
I'm pretty sure Vigil doesn't appear on hacked bulletproof camera.
---
We could also talk about Glaz "thermal" scope that doesn't spot friendlies.

Again realism is not a primary concern for devs, science is just used as an excuse to explain magic things.

You should unlock them all, doesn't really matter all that much who you start with. You might think you might like someone and you really don't when you get to playing them and vice versa
---
Mate, you know the score
---
I didn‚Äôt feel like adapting si I just quit.
---
i dont know whether this is cute or kinda dumb
---
It's obvious you dont know how KB/M are used on PS4. The adaptor (like the xim which is the most used one, so idk where you get your knowledge from because it's not true lol) translates mouse and keyboard into controller inputs and IN NO WAY IS THAT NATIVE LMAO. Do you even hear yourself, you're talking about stuff you know nothing about and portraying it as facts. 
---
'Nobody has native mouse input. Everybody is just translating mouse input into controller input' yes that's the fucking problem. That's not native. Thats literally paying money to use you a mouse on console. That's an unfair advantage et al cheating/exploiting. How does this not get through your head. 
---
No, I argued my point previously. I didnt attack you as a means to make my argument better. No, I made my point. I called you dumb because you are a dumbass. Those things are seperate. Calling you a dumbass and treating you like one isnt so it strengthens my arguments, it's just me speaking the truth.
---
Damn too bad for me it's secure area
---
Me and my friends call them pancakes
---
Only if you can control it. Some people just can't get used to using mouse. Keyboard can be awful too for some people. A controller is simple and comfortable.
---
What about if they change their name?
---
I was sort of hoping for like something as cool as that ice skin
---
Facts
---
yeah i‚Äôll bet

Attacking vigil and a defending Glaz.

don't let the mere existence of glitches hurt your enjoyment of the game.

I can only speak for EU gold, but hardly anybody knows about these glitches. during the last weeks I came across a single shield j√§ger and that's it.
---
Looks like one of those wrist watches from Endgame. Guess i've found my new main.

Yeah. This needs to be adressed. Same with the Jager/Bandit shiekd glitch. I thought it was something patched like 1 or 2 years ago.

It is Ubi's responsibility to prevent injectors / externals as well, that is a bad excuse for allowing players to cheat using in-game exploits that Ubi obviously didn't know existed. **Cheating is cheating**, I don't care if you run a program, load an injector or if execute the cheat yourself.

Hi! 
---
Danish speaker here, i like that You want to teach people How to pronounce the operators name!
---
But the pronounciation You provided is false If You want to stay true to the Danish language, since the √ò in Danish and norwegian is pronounced differently. 
---
The √ò in Danish is pronounced a lot harder, so If people want to learn How to pronounce it correctly i would recommend finding a video with the pronounciation of √ò in Danish.
---
What gets to me is when you are added to a game in progress and the team just insta kicks you as soon as you join
---
You bring great dishonor to your fellow blitz mains I spit in your general direction.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Thanks for the suggestion, and I just looked it up. You're right! It does look like the n√∏kk or n√∏kken, as I've also seen it. Overall, it's a great icon. It incorporates her stealth, her chainmail hood, and where her name comes from.
---
Dat look like glaz tho
---
Knock
---
Imagine peeking a corner and shrek is rushing you
---
repost, still on front page you pleb
---
no n√∏kk. you dont pronounce J√§ger like jagger or something
---
When I play mute, I‚Äôm kind of known to use my nitro on drones that are pissing me off. Suffice to say, teammates usually less than pleased.
---
"Some bugs" - you mean multiple game breaking glitches rendering the entire MP unplayable.
---
No, I don't think "every other game" has this.
---
Well imo this change will probably make him have to use his smokes mainly on site so quite often you‚Äôd have a maestro cam or bulletproof cam on site that can see him. Like basement on Oregon.
---
How did u find this post again
---
Where‚Äôs my favorite anti-breacher?
---
The c4 toss on chalet
---
T Series saying "Cease and Desist"
---
that was barely even kind of impressive
---
Yea but you have to have someone controlling the cam to give another person info, glaz can do all of this by himself
---
Why tower is in casual map pool then if it's garbage too ?
---
haha suppressor is bigger than the gun
---
Got a letter in the post
---
It's not just the glitches, it seems like their nodes are completely overloaded as well.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I have had so many desyncing and hitreg issues the past month that it feels like I am playing PUBG again...
---
I never though for a second that this was witch hunting
---
Except I‚Äôm almost positive glitching to get an unfair advantage over your enemies would be considered cheating, which is stated in CoC that you‚Äôre not allowed to do....
---
The commando is best in almost any situation. Has a faster TTK on 3 armors compared to the aug and a faster TTK on 2 and 3 armors compared to the G8A1. It also has access to an angled grip and has a very high damage per shot.
---
Whose turn is it to post one of these pics next week?
---
Wasn't R6 supposed to be classbased and they changed It before the game came out? Maybe this concept art was before the decision to make it hero based
---
Most of these glitches have already existed, so people try them each update and once in a while one activates again
---
Finland uses √∂ too. Don‚Äôt leave us out :(
---
Echo and Maestro are "added" to all maps. I mention it in the title and bottom left of the photo. They are really powerful in all maps, not just the esl ones
---
Where the fuck that Apyr came from?
---
It‚Äôs a perfect analogy, because counting cards is the exact same thing as abusing a glitch, in both scenarios you‚Äôre not playing the game as intended with the sole difference that the guy counting cards is not ruining the game for everybody else involved, he‚Äôs costing the casino money. My point is that the guy counting cards is using his skills to get an advantage, which for that reason I‚Äôm not condemning, and yet it is still considered cheating, even if in and of itself it‚Äôs not an unfair one, the bug exploiting in siege has absolutely nothing to do with skills, doesn‚Äôt win you anything, it just ruins the experience for everybody else since it trumps every kind of personal skill you may have, so once again, it is cheating
---
yeah, it's totally unlike ubisoft to break the game by power creeping new ops...
---
lets be real here.
---
ive had people sitting behind a clash shield glitch shooting through
---
It's not even Nuck, though. Don't get me wrong, we're getting close, but still quite far away when it comes to how English people will pronounce it! "Nuck" is really a lot better when Scandinavian people try to pronounce English with their own accents, but far out territory for actual English, which will interpret it as the F-word with an N replacement, which sounds just as bad as "knock"! :)
---
For the British speakers - it's the "uh" in "earnest". Uh-nest. √ò-nest. Specifically with RP (Received Pronunciation), it's in words such as "learn", "burn", "cellar" and "ever" as well.
---
For Americans, who involve the tongue and pronounce it err-nest, l-err-n and ev-err, it's not right though. A doofy "uugh", like a zombie moan, should come closer!
---
Source: Scandinavian, Nerd, Uni-student (English language)
---
I do appreciate the effort of keeping it right though, pacc! Things like the Caduceus staff as a symbol of medicine (instead of the Asclepios staff, which would be correct), makes my skin crawl, so I'm right here with ya!
---
Anything I can
---
Now I can play with Bain constantly whispering in my ear while I play
---
Can somebody tell me what are these glitches. I haven't played rainbow for months and I am planning to return.
---
To be fair they try there best to fix those glitches asap.
---
I know,just saying that valk should be with them (useful on all maps)
---
I hate teamkilling but I hate glitching more. My squad has a pact that we won't take a win on the back of random teammates glitching. It's rough when one player is glitching and there are 2 randoms seemingly innocent but when all randoms are a stack they are going down. Not gonna win while glitching. 
---
Unfortunately not all people think like this so we lose when our team glitches and the odds are high when a full team uses glitches against us so atm I think we lost a few hundred Elo over 2 days solely because of glitchers.
---
Fookin laser soights

Hello Meaxho, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpbbw9/what_glitch_is_worse/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Shoot hostage room with Capitao?Seems legit
---
I do know how it worls. And I am telling you about the Hori Tac Pro which you conveniently ignore.
---
Don‚Äôt use capitao on hostage, or fuse for that matter
---
Oh so the where Fuze shotgun in the short came from.
---
I love the blue uniform
---
You have to think about the screams though.
---
I like that idea.
---
The Sony controller is far away from being Third Party and unofficial.
---
She still gets hurt by traps and makes noise. Very unfair still.
---
Oh it's going to be so good scaring caveira players
---
It's not the fursuit, so that'll be a 0/10 from me dawg
---
I like the twitch prime skin for bandit
---
Hey does any1 has a schedule for the 18,19 of the event
---
Between 2-4 weeks from now i think
---
I do not need to own.the devoce to have knowledge about how it works. I am very aware of what people consider an issue. But to me it seems like you simply want to shut out opinions you dislike. Which is by far more in line what Anti-Vaccers and the likes do if you seriously want to go this way...
---
Ok thank you
---
Who says you have to use an external programme to call it cheating? That‚Äôs your assumption. That‚Äôs not a literal definition. Do you honestly think your perception is the pure fact? Get a grip. 
---
If I pull out my old cheat papers for GTA vice city,  but I‚Äôm not using an external programme. Am I cheating or exploiting?
---
If someone calls Mountain or Montage obe more time, I'm going to harm the hostage.
---
Ah a fellow Yugioh the Abridged Series watcher, have an upvote...in america
---
I think that he should be more bulky
---
I mean. That‚Äôs a pretty stupid move.
---
Also had a Capitao try to crossbow down a hallway through the barrel entrance to cellar over me and my teammate who were stacked, because I was running point with Blitz. He had no reason to shoot the hallway, he had no reason to try and shoot through us, but he did it. And he ended up hitting the back of my shield and burned me to death.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes - a TK in crossfire makes sense, otherwise its bad game sense.
---
The Ash had her one daily ‚Äúthought‚Äù and slowed down
---
Would you write that as "nuck"?
---
I haven‚Äôt even played siege since the shield head glitch started my friend told me and I noped. As someone who plays ranked only I‚Äôm not dealing with all that.
---
What? People that post art that are not their art? You prefer that no one know this art than someone post it, because it's not theirs?
---
Yes, it's stylish af and gives +5 agility.
---
With a new season coming. Who the hell knows when they will release a patch. They may just wait for the new season patch.
---
I absolutely agree
---
Use saucenao
---
*Do you know what Cav and Glaz have in common? Sneak. Like where an enemy is. Or when a hostile is pushing. The only difference is the stakes. Glaz‚Äôs is higher.*
---
It‚Äôs absolutely not pronounced Nuck. Use open vowels, it‚Äôs far closer to Newk than Nuck any day of the week.
---
of course, i forgot the ubisoft mantra of "if it aint broken, dont fix it, and if it is broken, again don't fix it..."

Yup, posted by /u/

Less hamster is a karma farming bot

Wow. This game is really messy now as I hear. Isn't this horrible that you play against kinda cheaters. And how do rook sees with a shield in front of him? Is it invisible?
---
Ohhhhh
---
I'm so hyped
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bol4jl/05142019_clash_and_deployable_shield_glitches_iq/
---
They have spoken on it. Here and on Twitter.
---
Have you considered that maybe they dont know how to fix it?
---
Is that Iron Man?
---
It sounded more like a N-ah-ck to me. May be the background noise from me tho
---
The GAME is unplayable. Not just ranked
---
I was not thinking a type chat but more a quick chat option for those who would prefer not to use a mic, maybe a more in-depth ping system, I've been solo queuing since I first got the game and I've never had any problems.
---
Yeah I played ranked before I heard about the exploits and the enemy team was using all 3 against. Needless to say we got smacked 0 - 4. I'm not even going to try and play ranked until they fix it.
---
Good
---
Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt ban glitchers cause they‚Äôre not hacking so you‚Äôre wasting your time
---
Well now he can be mistaken for Valk on long ranges or from behind xD
---
Yes, the problem is that people constantly post things that aren‚Äôt theirs without at least mentioning in the title. Gotta get that karma somehow eh
---
Thats fair i just wanted to point it out :/
---
TKing may be bad, but if you‚Äôre trying to play fair, why should anyone stop you?
---
Yeah, the quality was garbage. My mic is good, but it's Vocaroo.
---
r/unexpectedcommunism

Why report them? Just send the glitch to ubi then they should sort it out.

I mean he always helps the defenders by killing the hostage anyway

That's not about karma. I just want people to know nice art

Same you cant report them thay will just keep doing it untill in a month or 2 thay will patch it and then i well play again

The Art Of Siege book that come with the version I bought is full of art like this, sledge with frosts gun is my favourite from it
---
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll die either.
---
I envy you lucky citizen
---
Yeah right, whatever I‚Äôm bored of this
---
If you said you surrendered, it means someone started a vote to surrender and 4/5 people on your team voted yes. Basically your team forfeited the match.
---
no this is actually a fallout 4 power armor mod made to look like our Lord
---
Or maybe just put an ‚Äúo‚Äù because everyone understands what you mean without the line
---
It took me a long time to learn how to quick peek. I learned by going in to a custom and practicing a lot.
---
Looks dope just take out clash
---
The fact you tagged this as news makes me mad.
---
&gt; Yes the outcome doesn‚Äôt matter. Because if they‚Äôre cheating and I beat them, they‚Äôve still cheated haven‚Äôt they? 
---
Yeah you've decided to have an entirely different conversation now.
---
&gt;Doesn‚Äôt matter a fuck if they win or lose, they‚Äôve cheated regardless
---
Why have you switched to this line? No one was talking about it...
---
&gt;You‚Äôre reaching for this fucking exploit shit.
---
The things they are, by definition, doing. "Reaching".
---
&gt;Even though you‚Äôve said the same glitches, but being done in a third party programme, is cheating
---
"Third party" being the important part of that. Not what the end result is.
---
&gt;You think cheating is only from using other programmes. Fuck a games night at your house.
---
You've accepted  that I'm not saying exploiting is legit, so to then say this is mindbogglingly stupid.
---
best bet ive seen is restarting your pc, and if that doesnt work, going into task manager and stopping r6/uplay then starting them again. if that fails still, try getting ahold of ubi support, believe it or not ive had nothing but good experiences with them
---
Yeah, they did.
---
Oof
---
Apex legends and if i could, overwatch
---
Amazing, love the detail work you've put in!
---
Yea but still looks like iron man mk1
---
Thanks edited.
---
yea it sucks. I don‚Äôt play hostage but there‚Äôs also a exploit in hostage that you can 100% win every defense round and it‚Äôs been in the game for a month I wish ubi hires more people to work on bugs.
---
It means the game isn‚Äôt fully installed and that you played it while it was just playable. Try seeing if there is still a download.
---
I like how fuze is about to fuze the hostage
---
Boycotting won‚Äôt make them fix them fix the game any faster
---
Nice.

Let play cornhub

Yep, no invasions here.

I understand it when people write ‚Äúyour‚Äù wrong but I still prefer it when they write ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù
---
No it‚Äôs not real idk what he‚Äôs doing lol
---
I don't get it
---
I think you‚Äôre on to something here. They really make that loyalty part heavily implied.
---
You sent videos of the community team. The ToS stoll say differently.
---
I think maybe you don't understand what natively means. Maybe look up the definition yourself first?
---
Native means any given device works out of the box. Which the Horo Tac does.
---
I mean I've also seen this quote about a Polish merc killing commies in the cold war.
---
It's a fairly generic "stone cold badass" quote at this point.
---
I think it could would if it didn‚Äôt let you shoot or anything while you were in this mode, and you‚Äôre still SLIGHTLY visible
---
It does make sense when nano bots have been created IRL and designed to inject anything (yes, that includes adrenaline exhibitors) and remember that these bot does expire from operation to operation (every match that is)
---
There are many who are 'useful' on all maps like breachers for example, what he is getting at is that Echo/Maestro are so strong they work exceptionally well in every defensive site. Valk is useful on all maps, but isn't as much of a game changer as Echo/Maestro are.
---
The reinforved bundle is cool, but i have the SPQR skin on the shield
---
We have evolved too much for old marketing. We are immune to propaganda.

What sound bug are you referring to. Just curious

It‚Äôs a lot easier to write you‚Äôre than look up how to type using characters from a different language

**My my, have the turns tabled.**

Hes not talking about glaz or vigil
---
Just in case someone doesn‚Äôt want to see anything before full release
---
LMAOOO
---
True
---
Yeah, it's a shame. It's a little different though, IMO, because Kaid is someone an american could see and say "Kade" because "aid" is something they recognize. While "okk" is probably not something they would recognize, so just exclaiming it while people still wonder about the name, i could probably make a change for the positive.
---
I know unfortunately but this is unacceptable... imagine going to school for game coding and game designing and fucking up this bad ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Still, it preferable and not impossible nor that hard.
---
Believe It or not the optic cammo was deployed during afeghanistan US war;there was one v√≠deo from terrorist that leaked showing some Special operator with It passing info or something to a tank,untill He moved He was invisible,although v√≠deo compression certainly helped look that way , as the jihad was definitely aiming the cam at him.
---
It looked similar to that japanese cloak they showed some years back,only not as "projected"
---
Also Pretty sure most ufo recently catch on cameras are military tests.
---
F22 has been in development since 80s,only came out in 2000.
---
F16 a plane that came in the 70s was basically designed in the later 50s
---
So the next next plane is being project 20 years ago,and since the Focus is drones and ai...you can guess.
---
Kinect shield are also a thing but not as usefull as games and anime makes them

Didn't they say they implemented this? What happened?

This happened to me just now in a match on xbox
---
Lmao this cracked me.
---
No i quit playing ranked because of all the bullshit exploits. And yeah I should be diamond, every match I got ddosed in it was the final round and we were winning.  So shut your mouth.
---
oh man how did i miss this! This would be amazing!
---
Isn't it already longer in the game?

I‚Äôm surprised that fuse is not with a hostage
---
I know that. She‚Äôs just scary when she pops up behind me.
---
Why is he on -23 when his statement is correct. This subreddit full of coppers
---
I'm going to be banned to hell this next season I'm a nomad/doki main on attack and mistro/ela on defence
---
Are you in any way intelligent enough to realize that he stopped a piece of shit player from ruining their game? Any normal person can see he was right, and it is literally impossible to get banned on console, your useless report won‚Äôt do anything.
---
Exactly
---
I realy wanna see N√∏kk vs Cav

As much as I loved this game, it's also the most toxic game I have ever played.

I know but again he‚Äôs secret service I think it would look kinda unnatural for him to be using a long gun so his pistol better be good. That‚Äôs my point.

Anything with a camera and a gun is op

F12 is the default for both Steam and Uplay IIRC.
---
guess its my own personal opinion then. I love hibana, so having pick and ban would kinda make the game a little bit more stale for me. oh well, ill just use capitao or fuze
---
There's a thing on the sidebar that says your username, then a button next to that that says 'Edit'. Click that, and you can choose a flair. Unless you're on mobile, because I have no idea how that works.
---
Have you ever opened a door only to see a tachanka mounted and loaded staring right at you before?
---
What is the mic bug on pc?
---
Yup . I totally agree with you . The idea of a p90 with an inbuilt silencer is infact suitable for a secret service operative.
---
Who‚Äôs there?
---
You can‚Äôt see me
---
Woah
---
I think whos banned is going to come down mostly to the rank it is in. Lower ranks will ban annoying/ scary ops like blitz, dokk, caveira while higher ranks will do actual bans like maestro, hibana, thatcher, or lesion
---
Bornholm, an island of Denmark, might have adapted that term. Not sure at all, but they have a heavy dialect that sometimes resembles the other Scandinavian countries
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm hoping his pistol will be either the silenced deagle we see here or a five-seven. I‚Äôd be happy with both.
---
Anyone else see fuze about to kill the hostage
---
Please, have mercy with the development team, they are working in the new season and this appeared, lets just hope everything will come back to normality ASAP
---
Sory 4 ma english
---
But, it‚Äôs free ranks for cheaters
---
Hire hackers? Lmao wtf are you talking about. Not everyone can hack cause you need an external device/software which not anyone has therefore it‚Äôs unfair
---
Man that was deep, I‚Äôm sorry for your losses XD
---
I mean yes but I‚Äôm sure the people who truly play them for who they are wouldn‚Äôt mind disabling them for the time being so they can play a fair game

Would you say it's been here for years?

Hopefully, part of her ability will make her quietly whisper, ^^^ooogggaaa...booogggaaa, when she gets close to a defender

A year maybe?
---
Haven‚Äôt played the game in a while  until today. I hopped on to ranked with my friends and every round there was a shield in Hager‚Äôs face, clash was invincible and iq was just wall hacking, what an experience.
---
This happens to me literally every time someone plays clash it's so irritating I literally won't even bother fighting clash anymore I find another entry
---
I'm out of the loop, is that really  a defender with an offensive riot shield??
---
#**OOGAA BOOGAA AAAAAHHHAAAAAAA**
---
My friends were lucky to find people like you during ranked matches
---
Rook or Doc with ACOG MP5.
---
No she is Nokk.
---
And it's not like breaking woods door/windows is our only way to breach into the map.
---
Ah, thanks.  I've had that problem and didn't know what to call it.
---
Thatcher and Clank
---
mind stone.
---
first of all i get the idea of locking a busted ,glitched operator and i fully endorse it but shields in generally should not be removed ,its not the same with glitch iq or glitch class
---
Im So SmArT
---
No spoilers /s
---
Spy is objectively the single worst tf2 character
---
Just a smoke nomad crossover
---
absolutely disgusting
---
Well i mean it depends. For some people it is just useless info that they will never need.
---
However some people will spread the information to others, explaining it as truth in their eyes, which creates more false information.
---
Some people will also defend these views because everything up to that point has showed them them these fictions as truth.
---
Few times i have had conversations with people that would just not believe real facts and cling onto fiction that they have seen time and time again.
---
Didn't know that. Btw I just confirmed rn, and exploiting game mechanics breaches the terms of service and hence is a bannable offense.
---
Thanks, since the glitch is known, I don't met yet a cheating IQ, or I take IQ to prevent the glitch.
---
IT AINT ME, IT AINT ME!
---
those Famous Streamers already got an big income but im talking about those small creators &amp; streamers &amp; Youtubers that really need help to develop their videos and Grow their Channel something much like e**** creator code that when you buy something using that code its Gives 10% for Creator code Owner 
---
I‚Äôm a big fan by the way ! You were a inspiration for my channel ! üôå
---
Sure, but thats whats needs to be done to stop the spread of this shit. Losing rank because of a cheat is worse than not being able to use an operator. There are enough of them to choose from now.
---
Is it in other games too? Cuz that could be a reason for it. Also try either enabling or disabling raw-input.
---
Hm especially when they have black ice weapon skin
---
fuze doing his part
---
No ubi does not NEED to create a way to help any streamer or YouTubers.
---
But they do twitch streamers got a charm to support them, they also sponsored YouTubers in the past to make videos. Unsure if this is still the case as I don't really watch any videos on seige any more.

if u hop over something after grabbing hostage you go invis again
---
People who say it's a dead meme were never true followers to begin with.
---
Not soon enough
---
You hear it in another room and then a mix of your teammate's screams and gunfire
---
If only
---
I expected an actual man frog
---
They already made it, there's a whole section in their webpage to youtubers
---
Has anything been released on the gadget?
---
What is S because I‚Äôve been playing more with that tapioca guy.
---
Why are gridlock and maestro so low?
---
Why is yellow recruit so superior to the other recruits?
---
Doesnt mean hes useless. Just means those are the best of the best for most situations.
---
great idea tell everyone to ban my mains...
---
I dont think you realize how annoying this glitch is. No, it is not and never will be fun to play against an invisible op.
---
Assuming the person isn't a cheater, the cheater season.
---
I'll give you half-credit, because you admitted it's not yours in the comments. But I agree with u/WeNeedaBetterWorld, people will assume it's your work based on the title, and if I was the original artist I would be upset that you didn't credit me. Perhaps the artist is planning on posting an entire series together, and you've just stolen one panel and posted it out of order? If you stole the work and can't find the artist, don't post. It's that simple.
---
Thats why i put it in disccusion.
---
Mp7?
---
Unless this was from after launch then it does make sense because originally there was not supposed to be individual operators, there would be classes on attack and defence (attack had shield, sniper and assault, defence had trapper and 2 other I cannot remember)
---
Please tell me where that‚Äôs confirmed lmfao
---
idk a lot of these are dependent on site and your teammates choices too haha
---
Maestro should be higher and Mira too
---
gonna be so many palt and diamond charms on guns next season because of cheating scum.
---
M870
---
Yeah, she's fucking ridiculous because it's full body as well. So if your up against her as the last one she can just hide in the fucking corner. It's ridiculous

Is this your main psn account ?

I feel like I have seen you once 
---
What is your main psn ?
---
RNG Stands for ‚Äùrandom number generation‚Äù. Dumbass.
---
Huh... Isn't it a bit weird to be reusing weapons right now?
---
Imo, they should‚Äôve just taken clash out of the game. She has an insanely low pick rate, and the majority of the community would probably appreciate it. 
---
Again this is my opinion, and we‚Äôre all entitled to our owns. I‚Äôm not knocking Ubi, as they have a lot to do, and I respect coding as little as I understand it. But in my opinion, they should‚Äôve just removed her when they heard of the bug
---
It's not too far out really. Why not use guns that are already in the game, that people are used to? They don't belong to any existing CTU so they could give them any gun they want. I like it.
---
Im pretty sure kaid is a trainer for other ops
---
Rainbow Six contains the best of the best. They aren‚Äôt a recruitment/training program themself
---
Not a very good joke, yes?
---
Nah, looks like Maestro just got an upgrade. If he could sing every callout like this, I would be very happy.
---
"reee someones ruining my casual copper games"
---
Can you post a link ?
---
Not that unusual since Ubisoft said they were pulling all their devs off Siege to finish Ghost Recon. Just sad. But the FiveSeven, P-10C, and Six12 were all in the promo art/teasers so it isn't a placeholder like some are suggesting.
---
Do not disrespect the sacred scrolls
---
But we saw official pictures of Nokk with Lesions's shotgun and with the deagle
---
no new weapons?
---
Looks like I'll be using impacts to take care of them.
---
At least we get consistent updates
---
Way to go buddy it took me three days to try to hide the hostage perfectly.

*throws drone outside*

Anything client sided is completely fair and balanced. Especially when you get spawn peeked from a window which, for you, wasn't even open
---
This is a far stronger assumption than her not being interrogated. Thanks for sharing.
---
I was having a similar issue earlier this year. I was cosplaying as Blackbeard and finding his actual ACUs is difficult. What I ended up doing was just going with the default Multicam and it actually works out plus he does have a few pictures of him in a tan multicam but also in the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù dark multicam. Hopefully this helps
---
He looks so badass
---
That‚Äôs an upgrade
---
IQ gave up on trying to cheat that round any you killed her anyway, oof
---
&gt;I wonder
---
They did confirm the nationalities of the operators at the invitational. Defender is American.
---
N√∏kk if you Buck
---
be careful around schools lmao
---
5 out of 8 games of ranked I played last night, either several people or one was doing 1 of the 3 bull glitches every round. How have they not fixed this yet?
---
She still does
---
This is a blessing
---
Something like overwatch has for new players to see which one is better for beginners
---
    Not that unusual since Ubisoft said they 
---
    were pulling all their devs off Siege to finish Ghost Recon
---
Source? I don't recall this.
---
Prefire don‚Äôt forget you can shoot through walls so always look for those wall bangs drone it out every now and then and have fun
---
Not one new weapon you got to be kidding me
---
Try uninstalling the game and requesting a refund from steam or Ubisoft support
---
When peeking corners it is best to ‚Äúpixel peek‚Äù which is when you position yourself so that when you lean there are 2 doorways that make a small hole for you to shoot through you can look it up on yt
---
My bad sorry
---
Ngl I am not excited as I wanna be. If they're planning on setting out for their "years long road map" then why are they already reusing operator elements and abilities? Nokk is gonna just be Vigil on attack. I really hope I'm wrong, but this is what I see for now
---
With the Para you can use an angled grip, so there's that.
---
I hate how the icons in the middle are reversed. Useful chart, but now unusable in this state
---
No, its really not.
---
I wonder if its data limits if they're using only guns currently in the game.
---
Lmao shut the fuck up kid. I answer your question and you gotta be toxic back. You‚Äôre dumb. It‚Äôs a fact and Ubisoft has said before that the report toxic behavior button is **ONLY** for commutation toxicity.
---
Also I don‚Äôt do the glitches
---
Cpu
---
Add another slide captioned fuze
---
Biggest thing new players don‚Äôt do on attack is drone 
---
Drone a lot, especially early in the round, you should be on your drone any time before you enter a room unless you think there is a  person in the room who could hear you and kill you, in which case having the setting that auto goes into your drone when you throw it turned off is helpful (can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name) but throwing your drone and making them think you‚Äôre on it, can give an easy kill sometimes
---
Otherwise have a teammate watch the door while you drone and let them know what‚Äôs in there so they can push it
---
Droning too much however can be a bad thing, a general rule of thumb is that you shouldn‚Äôt be on your drone much during the last minute of the round, and should be focused on pushing the other teams down applying pressure to them, making them overextend and give you a free kill, or just pushing the objective
---
Also, talk to your teammates, communication is ridiculously important in this game and can be the difference between getting a kill, and being killed, that goes for offense and defense
---
On defense, making sure you‚Äôre aware of your teammates positions, where they are taking fire from, and where the enemy could possibly take shots at you, is key
---
If you roam, knowing the maps is a necessity, but if you aren‚Äôt comfortable roaming yet, picking a 3 armor and holding obj is just as important and helpful, while requiring much less map knowledge
---
This game is all about knowledge, knowledge of the operators and their uses, map knowledge, knowing where your enemy is, and being able to predict where an enemy is going to push from, making quick decisions like that, is going to make you a much better siege player
---
Hope I helped in some way
---
Sorry it turned into an essay I didn‚Äôt realize how much I typed
---
The devs create them on purpose - to not only be the best at the game they create, but to keep their jobs as well.
---
Warden is from Secret Service, N√∏kk is from Fr√∏mandskorpset, They will be a part of new CTU, specifically created for Rainbow team, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they won‚Äôt have new weapons(look at Maverick and Clash).
---
It's getting there
---
No one knows, because its nothing danish. Closest thing to a danish name or nickname is the use of an "√∏".
---
It adds another layer of strategy, forces people out of the same old strategies used repeatedly, and is perfect for situations like now where the game is basically unplayable due to a certain few character's game-breaking glitches.
---
This one isn't a preference thing. Doc has access to the acog, which is supremely powerful (especially on defense). You're giving up a huge advantage by not picking the acog.
---
Yeah it's especially annoying because it's casual, it doesn't matter. People who tk for that reason are just dicks
---
No they‚Äôve literally said they only consider hacking cheating lol. Ubisoft has never banned anyone for cheating. My friend got banned for messaging a glitcher with a toxic message but the glitcher didn‚Äôt haha
---
You can only grief people.
---
Cheaters ain't people.
---
It was stated very bluntly in the reveal stream and repeated in another interview. I can probably pull it up when I get home from work.
---
Fuze with shotty is the thing i didnt know i needed
---
Definitely the cpu
---
Every month this is posted and every month we say no.

Hello LunarFrag, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpe75o/you_thought_the_tachanka_speed_glitch_was_bad/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That is pretty cool actually
---
It'd be better to just limit the ranks that can queue together; with your suggestion although they would play diamonds, they would lose barely any points and gain a ridiculous amount per win since their average rank is a lot lower than the people they would be playing.
---
Gotcha, That makes sense.
---
Bruh, Warden's a cutie!
---
(Hope he's voiced by Steve Blum.)
---
No you can't buy the previous year passes anymore. You can only buy the year 4 pass now. You'll just have to buy the r6 credits for older operators
---
Respect!
---
Can we get the first two masks
---
Nokk has a D-50 in that loadout screen which is confirmed by her yesterday's trailer's thumbnail...
---
It happens on console too, occasionally we have to switch to party chat.
---
Isn't letting the game autopick already random?
---
only in US its called cap-can, kapkan is Russian word for 'trap' and its pronounced as khap-kaan
---
they did say they wanted to counter the smoke and plant meta
---
Did you make this picture or screenshot it?
---
No way these are placeholders, they would not go to the length of putting these weapons in the operator trailers.
---
Is there a way to download TS now? I can't see it yet in my library

Hello IAmNot_ARussianBot, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpf2di/glitches_and_the_case_for_pick_and_ban/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Placeholder. In his trailer Maverick had a shotgun, he did not have one in his final loadout.
---
Then you might be blind.
---
* She uses the cav-pistol hand style and position
---
* This indicates she has silent step abilities
---
* Her loadout looks completely different; Surpressed Deagle? Yes please
---
* It was said somewhere in the lore that she doesn't betray people, potentially meaning she has cav immunity
---
Prepare to be disappointed then because it is 100% real.
---
US link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpZBD30L7fo
---
He has MPX, SAS shotgun, SMG12 and P10 (Clash).
---
There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any new guns whatsoever this season, kinda sad about it
---
Looks like a Kingsman agent.
---
MPX works for valk because she can see where the attackers are if she has a cam and can prefire them. Idk how it will work for warden‚Äôs ability though.
---
new videos up, spot the difference
---
https://www.facebook.com/groups/780323055338167/?ref=share u need to get in the group to view the post
---
He gives off a Kingsman/Bond vibe, I like it.
---
Also North American link here
---
https://youtu.be/qpZBD30L7fo
---
You'd be buffing him more than anything by making him a 2 speed. Now he'd be able to capitalize on his stuns.
---
by three weapons I meant a new primary for both Warden and Nokk, and a common pistol between the two
---
Damn james bond lookin ass
---
their pistols seem confirmed but let's hope to all gods that their primary's are placeholders
---
i cropped the original image then circled the random icon
---
The gun loadouts are most likely temporary. Ubi has only ever given one attacker an SMG and even then it has a drum mag. Highly doubt what we see is their actual loadouts
---
2 2
---
MPX is on Valk tho so no acog. (Ubi have repeatedly stated that tachanka and kapkan having the same weapon makes ACOG for tachanka "impossible")
---
nope.
---
If I play warden, shotgun through smoke is the plan.
---
Yay :)
---
i play on ps4 and i practiced a ton with 75 sensitivity and once i got it down i can flick like a motherfucker
---
Wtf is a game taking big? Do you even spellcheck bro
---
just iq i think. also keep out the way of clash. that shield might turn out to be a complete nightmare
---
For people in North America here's the link for the [Warden trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpZBD30L7fo)
---
Lion was different. He was a GIGN operator, using the same shotgun as the GIGN operators. But atleast he and Finka both got unique guns as well as Spetnaz and GIGN guns.
---
These two have EVERY SINGLE GUN in their loadout copy and pasted from other CTU's.
---
Make them watch fun videos (anthony pit,bikini..) maybe it will make them want to play siege
---
Random operator select option.
---
Lazy copy/paste operators, lazy loadouts, lazy game.
---
My bad i speak taco burrito
---
I wouldn't mind. It has 800 RPM and low recoil, and siege will always be a headshot meta.
---
Remember, that has better damage and fewer shots to kill than the mp5, except the acog.
---
They probably are used to respawning? 
---
Siege makes you play so carefully and the learning curve is like a mountain peak. I understand. The very friends that got me to buy it back during Black  ice are intimidated to hop in with me today. So much content has been added since then, it‚Äôs kinda overwhelming.
---
Gordon just came in R6 stright from Arkham
---
I can still see that and faze's on the shop as well speak.
---
Yes they would. They are trailers not gameplay. Animating either would take the same effort. They don't take Gameplay animations and put them in trailers.
---
Thanks for the info mate. Appreciate bringing it to notice.
---
This sexy mustache, James Bond wannabe has my boxers a little soaked. And as a Valk main I don‚Äôt mind the weapon. Oooooooooh baby
---
Honestly N√∏kk looks like the shittest op I‚Äôve ever seen if the sources I‚Äôve seen are legit
---
Wow who made this
---
Nah
---
Disappointing*
---
Each game mode has a drastically different skill ceiling that it makes rank almost irrelevant.  
---
You could be a Platinum III in Secure, but who knows, you might actually be be a Gold II in Bomb. 
---
Keeping it to one gamemode makes the ranking system more accurate.
---
Wrong; It was said by someone in the TTS that they are confirmed placeholders. Also placeholder guns have been used in all op trailers since the beginning
---
Then I am sorry that you did not get the point of it.
---
Shield desync.
---
Issues exist with shields.
---
I know the ops are real, the guns are placeholders tho, most of them aren‚Äôt even from the same country
---
No?
---
The guns are a let down for me. Imo .
---
It's a mix between KiX and DrDisrespect ...
---
maverick has a shotgun in his video
---
You already can.
---
It's called a drone.
---
Is that a question or a statement?
---
You can‚Äôt hear it but I was talking to a mate and called out one tap on both shots, was very satisfying
---
Oh i talked about that black n white golden skin
---
That is a random op button
---
Don‚Äôt even get me started in N√∏kks loading- an already situational gadget with no acog or DMR

Not true at all...

recently pulled off one of those as well [https://streamable.com/9coel](https://streamable.com/9coel)

Yeah
---
I‚Äôve started to pick clash just so other people can‚Äôt use the glitch. I‚Äôm sick of these slimy ass dudes.
---
They‚Äôre pretty fun to use in custom games, though. Messing around with friends and stuff.
---
DoNt RePoRt Me
---
Yes.
---
Bicycle operator when?
---
I think early game rumours yeah. But theres a point where if the other team isn't entering then you can take the risk and end the round.
---
Thanks üòè
---
It's not, the pre-season notes made changes to the FMG-9 and Deagle, so if they're placeholders that's incredibly weird.
---
inb4 Jager finds a way to still put the shield on his face
---
Ok, ubi has to be memeing, only new thing is the site (which mozzie already has) but for a new gun, and that you can have a suppressed deagle, ima be depressed af if they fuck up our first scandinavian op.
---
Just play what they play.
---
You do realize when buff blitz was a thing, blitz was a piece of garbage and his earmuffs counted as his head hit box, he couldn't sprint ect.
---
So it's like Cav and Vigil had a baby and it got put onto attack. This does nothing to sway how I feel about Ubi reimplementing operator abilities after they said they were going to keep the operators refreshing and relevant. While it is relevant, I feel it's not refreshing. I guess we'll all see when the ops come out, but until then, I'm gonna keep seeing what I see with what is provided and hoping I've got the complete wrong idea. Suppressed deagle would be pretty fuckin cool either way tho
---
That‚Äôs f*cking stupid
---
That's fucken Ron Swanson
---
No way these weapon choices are legit
---
The loadouts look trash and if warden doesnt become atleast a 2 speed this season will be dead to me
---
Show them funny moments from yt, it's why I got into it
---
They are placeholders. Don't worry.
---
Why would a secret service operator have as secondary the same weapon as korean operators?
---
It has to be a place holder.
---
Iq bug? I dont play this game as often anymore, yesterday I saw a guy on my team constantly playing Clash and IQ. I saw Clash being glitched, but what has IQ?
---
Not a 3 speed doesn‚Äôt count
---
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one that isn‚Äôt a fan of this icon design. It looks so stupid and out of place in comparison to the other operators. They could‚Äôve at least used maybe the glasses as a focal point for it instead of a weird suit design.
---
Only bomb? Why?
---
smh
---
Im excited
---
Probably just you and a handful of others.
---
The rest prefer to get all the data and test it before making statements, rather than assuming speculating.
---
Remember how people called lion sh*tty with the leaks and jackal OP? Look how both those turned out. History, sadly, repeats.
---
Any confessions?
---
Man all these old men on defense teaching the youngsters
---
Bryan Cranston is the new operator
---
Heisenberg is the new operator
---
Also mpx and six 12
---
I just watched his teaser and it only shows his blowtorch and a pistol?
---
I don't see why. You have tools to deal with them.
---
memes aside, after the buff the deagle was already fairly accurate, and now it has a muzzle brake. it's gonna be a monster.
---
Thats the new thing, now you can add supressor to d-50. This includes valks and blackbeards d-50 to.
---
I scrolled down and this exact post was posted 1 minute before yours
---
I lost more than 10 fucking matches because of this bullshit. I actually unistalled the game till these clowns fix the fucking game instead of adding skins and new shitty operators.
---
Is commissioner Gordon
---
I understand that the idea of Nokk is op, but you did not need to give her the shittiest weapons in the game. Nokk has two defensive weapons, and I bet that she won't even have an acog. The fact that ubi wasn't even able to give her a proper weapon on attack is pathetic. And the deagle? Seriously? That is probably the worst pistol in the game, with its clunky ironsights and horrible recoil. The only good thing in that shit loadout is the USG. I hope that these are fillers, because these loadouts are looking trash.
---
That just makes it even more important that they modify the "pick ban" system to make them able to remove gadgets and operators that are found to be abuse-able.

Revert his dmg model to the 85 with a very slow fire rate. Tbh idk why they gave it that insane rof to begin with.
---
Operator uniforms and headgear?
---
For now, this is best season in this year,but we must wait for release
---
Placeholder weapons?... Pls
---
Or have him have the ability to remove the gun from the stand and carry it. Only hip fire but at least he would be mobile.
---
Nice
---
It is highly unlikely that every gun is reused.
---
Didn't Maverick have placeholders in all his artwork and leaks?
---
Ah my bad, OP responded that it‚Äôs the SMG-12
---
A bunch of juuls
---
As√≠ no eh as√≠ no
---
The official shotgun of the u.s. secret service is the Remington 870. Interesting choice to use British shotty but maybe it changes.
---
100% accurate, i confirm
---
100 operators, they said. At 48 ops (counting the new season) and they are starting to reuse abilities.
---
Dude still XD hibana mains would start shooting out things to make dicks
---
There is gameplay footage in TTS. All the guns are recycled. Im sad but this is the truth.
---
* **Why shift most of the team to a new ghost recon survival game nobody asked for?** Yeah, ignore everyone that bought wildlands and liked it. Ignore that ubisoft is a goddamn company and they need to make new games to exist. Go back to your bubble kid. If they want 100 ops, they will need to do some recycling with some tweaks. This is just how numbers and limits of engine, and mechanics works.
---
Please do not implement the 3-round rotation bullshit into the main build.
---
This.
---
Looks pretty good. Man i hated bakery so much.

This is the right way I believe, you should not be able to stomp silvers to artificially raise your rank.

When was Ivan?
---
Wow that‚Äôs lame lol
---
Rest In Peace
---
So ur annoyed okay but seriously they took existing stuff and merged it to something rly cool
---
Placeholders in the TTS too until the official reveal maybe. Why on Earth would Warden get the SMG-12?
---
The hell happened with the operator icons?
---
Bomb is the only Ranked mode? As a Hostage player,all i want to say is –Å–ë–ê–ù–´–ô –†–û–¢ –í–ê–° –°–£–ö–ê –í–´ –ß–Å –¢–ê–ú –ê–•–£–ï–õ–ò? –î–ê –ü–û–®–õ–ò –í–´ –í–°–ï –ù–ê–•–£–ô

The weapons are retarded. But other than that I guess it‚Äôs fine. The dude is dressed as expected, mustache is illegal but fine fine let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs grandfathered in. 
---
The guns are still whack. Reusing guns already.
---
Everyone would look the same, and Nooks and Wardens design is still grounded in reality. What the hell do you mean?
---
Her gadget is pretty good, kinda situational but she has an fmg without acog and lesions shotgun. For an attacker she needs some way better primaries
---
does that make his ability any less useless
---

I'm gonna be mad if he won't have Walther PPK as a secondary.
---
Darn! I personally hate the mpx because of the ttk for it
---
That should be a thing honestly, I want to see Mozzie just resting his foot on it.
---
Well if he's part of rainbow there could be exceptions on that stuff, but I'm no loremaster.
---
glad they're ignored cause their ideas suck.
---
That gun combo is wack
---
I can‚Äôt even watch it
---
Is Nokk actually getting the d50
---
*cocks back pistol* DELET THIS
---
Nobody goes against terrorists in suit. They might do bodyguarding in suit, but not counter terrorism.
---
and a muzzle break
---
Zofia's is a Phoenix, which represents her withstand ability. It does make sense.
---
I'm staying away until those glitches are gone. Finally, my Switch is getting some mileage.
---
Based on a leak reported by Core Ross, it's a total reuse for both characters.
---
I think it's left over from when the smg 11 had like no recoil, it was basically a primary, so people ran the shotgun for opening walls etc because why have two good smgs.
---
Now its just ok, but people are slow to rethink opinions and still underestimate the value of the FMG.
---
Either that or have him be able to remove the gun from the turret. Hip fire only but he would be mobile. I think the armor piercing rounds is a good idea too.
---
I have not
---
Who tf peeing in the juul room
---
One exception is if it‚Äôs a cop mustache it‚Äôs fucking allowed.
---
It's not a joke when you get screamed at and harassed by other players because you play G36 with red-dot, every time you get killed...
---
No map pool changes? Fuck off, that's the only thing I cared about... Pick and ban as well as the round rotation are really nice but I don't care about them as long as I need to play Skyscraper, Hereford, Chalet, Fortress, Theme Park etc.
---
Breakpoint is wildlands but with survival elements. Why would I pay additional 70$ for a few new features?

I think it‚Äôs more of the fact that he‚Äôs aged, so he logically wouldn‚Äôt be as fast as the younger and more fit ops. The bullet resistance still doesn‚Äôt make sense though
---
Alibi has an M9 in all her operator release pictures. No usable M9 in inventory. This checks out.
---
Same as Gridlock. Someone of her weight would never get in. I don't think women are allowed in the Australian CTU either.
---
Just win your gunfights
---
I'm afraid it's not, they announced that they will be giving muzzle break and a silencer to Deagle and they are adding a Holo sight, like Mozzie's to FMG. And this is why
---
Thoughts: 
---
-Nokk is just vigil+cav. 
---
-Nokk only has defender weapons. Good defender weapons, but the point still stands.
---
-She also has the 2 worst pistols.
---
-Warden is a Glaz counter. The anti-cc thing is cool.
---
-Damn, 3 armor. that sucks.
---
-You couldn't choose 2 worse primary weapons. At least valk has a decent shotty to make up for the trash damage of the mpx.
---
-SMG-12 is cool, though.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Alibi uses a Berretta in the art work for her but doesn't use one in game. I agree with you
---
Who is taking a poop in the juul room
---
Making Mavericks swap speed slower again. Can't they figure out another way to balance him instead of ruining the same thing on him.
---
This was my main reason for taking a break from the game. It‚Äôs frustrating when you‚Äôre trying to climb and you run into this all the time around the silver/gold ranks. It makes the competitive ranked mode feel like it‚Äôs a joke. They should work towards making the game mode polished and fix stupid shit like this before releasing new content. 
---
If this one problem would be fixed, it would make a huge impact on the players experience while playing a ranked game mode.
---
A man of culture I see
---
I wasn‚Äôt asking you, was asking u/k2030 but okay that‚Äôs your opinion on them.
---
But keep in mind questions can be asked multiple times by multiple people
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for AMAN Ops.
---
Eh, I don‚Äôt see how there wouldn‚Äôt be room. Again, I‚Äôm totally cool with her load out, she sounds snappy and horrifying when you get pushed from the rear, which is totally my style. I just think it‚Äôd make more sense having a GSG 9 weapon is all.
---
Looks like Gordon left Gotham to become a 00 agent
---
Wish they did the fn2000
---
Why would a 3 armor be a roamer /s
---
Is the test server live?
---
Apple watch alpha pack skin incoming.
---
Looks like an option to choose a random operator
---
It's pretty cool, yeah. Although we can't access the feed, I'd like to assume the defender marking feature when they run outside is based on data gathered by the Eagle Drone.
---
It used to be silent and it gave no indicators, but that was a long time ago. It's not silenced if you see an indicator.
---
While a hard breacher would be nice.  I think we could have had claptao fire charge be a thermal projectile that melted a reforment like a bigger mav hole and give him 3 bolts and make his smoke toxic like*smokes* smoke bombs.  But thats just my opinion.
---
It's one of many game breaking glitches this season.
---
IQ - Invisible
---
Clash - shoot through her shield
---
Jaeger/maestro/anyone with deployable gadget &amp; shield - deployable shield on head
---
This is the worst its ever been since i've played this game
---
the guns are a HUGE disappointment for me! would have loved to see a F2000, Galil, Tavor/MTAR, even another AR15 variant would be cooler than this
---
Well in the cinematic Nokk is holding the shotgun, and has a deagle in the thumbnail
---
I know, but it isn't in my library now.
---
Yes, or at least offer another solution, Like temporarily taking the abused items out of the game
---
Imagine roaming on tower and turning a corner and seeing nokk standing there
---
Definitely a hard anchor, looks like a good op tho.
---
His CTU def has to do some more moving around. Am from Brazil, can confirm since bope is basically just a glorified police unit. Very glorified
---
So Nokk is just Vigil but for attackers?
---
right? i understand playing mix of objectives. but not playing bomb... that is not really playing siege.
---
Hello rykercon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpgycu/master_chief_its_too_late/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
"Oh I've been playing the game for over 1000 hours therefore my opinion matters more than yours because I've been playing longer" just STFU with your play time. It doesn't help you AT ALL.
---
Now, that is a bullshit excuse. "Data limits"? wtf, erase hereford and put new guns then.
---
Thats probably where these images got their source from. they made it to seem consistent, and add validity, but if it was made after the trailer it would make perfect sense. Still hoping this isnt the case, because reusing guns is just terrible balance practice, now valk and warden would be intrinsically balance tied, like castle and pulse. castle needs a buff, pulse does not, and it causes problems. surely they see that, cant imagine theyd reuse 100% of the guns.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes FINALLY
---
That‚Äôs fine but that‚Äôs what casual is for. They shouldn‚Äôt make the competitive mode have secure when maps are designed for bomb and having a separate ranked for secure is a bad idea, which is why they are removing that choice.
---
Per your edit, it takes 10 games each season to rank, so, you know, I've played more than one.
---
We have already had similar examples with Lion and Finka who only had 1 new gun and at the same time I don't want to be somebody that at every single turn complained about Ubi being incredibly lazy. I can respect your opinion but that doesn't mean I believe it.
---
So why does Nokk have AR mags in her vest?
---
Kaid has an acog
---
Seconded.
---
What is Buck if not a better sledge?
---
That's the problem with these hero shooters. At some point, they'll end up reusing skills.
---
What do you feel like the change to the deployable shields is a buff? It is a nerf, surely.
---
is it just me or does it look too posh now?
---
In my head I'm thinking a three speed op with hard breaching impact nades, the way I see it attackers are pushing and defs are trapped on site and can't flank or rotate, this would fix that
---
YEAH !!!
---
edit: apparently I was RIGHT!!
---
I guess I just want to see more operators with more original abilities rather than balancing using existing abilities, like a defender that could plug Mavericks peak holes with some kind of expanding foam, or an operator that had some kind of wire door trap that snags up your guns but still let‚Äôs you move.
---
 
---
I just want more interesting things rather than mashups of what we already have. That being said, an attacker that can match Cav and Vigil is a win to me.
---
At that point Buck is similar too because he has 3 flashes
---
We should be mad at Ubi for allowing these people to run rampant
---
I was wondering if it was like PL,  if you didn‚Äôt know if you down someone or not
---
Hah lol just searched through my notifications to find this, seems you beat me here lol.
---
Anyone who has played a moba or a hero shooter can tell you that new characters don't and often shouldn't be 100% new ideas. Usually they take old mechanics and put new twists/balances on them, or take old ideas and put new mechanics on them. It gives you redundant options and specific synergies and also means that having a ban mode won't lead to a specific strategy or play style being completely inaccessible. Characters like Nokk are exactly what the game needs.
---
A 2 shot kill low recoil "dmr" like weapon is in no way "subpar"
---
Probably got reported
---
The tts wasn‚Äôt supposed to go live till next week. The weapons are most likely place holders. Ubi goofed and acknowledge it
---
Yeah i see what you are saying, smokes can fix that, there needs to be more reasons for operators to bring smokes anyway now with Warden
---
I never got into it personally, I like to either defend or attack a single room
---
Uh thats the tts
---
Ubisoft won‚Äôt ban glitchers
---
Nice!
---
Can see some changes in Kafe Dostoyevsky too. 
---
Thnx
---
Nah fam the comment about how many hours you have and your rank isn't about Glaz. That's you trying to be a big boi.
---
No vault prompt for defenders anymore. 
---
These were the worst places to watch for when attacking the trains as they could jump out, kill anyone that was repelling or on drones etc. Claymore was the only utility to counter by placing at the bottom but even at that, you had 2 windows above and 2 below which was a difficulty.
---
Does it really work like that? Reputation based? First time I hear about that.
---
What iq glitch I haven't been on r6 for a few weeks
---
D E T A I L S
---
Is every mission the exact same and if you take over certain areas do the bad guys just respawn again??
---
Like division wild lands had so many great things about it but overall they became unplayable to me after 30-40 hours.
---
He has a p10c apparently... Which is cool I guess. I mean I'm kinda looking forward to being able to use it on a more maneuverable operator but I hope this is not going to become the constant trend of reusing old weapons.
---
Yep.
---
 Meant literally any map at all. As in, Ying isn‚Äôt useful on a single map.
---
CAVEIRA
---
Neither am i
---
I bet if they are placeholders, you‚Äôd still be complainingüòÇ
---
Again, this isn't about the counters, this post isn't for me. It doesn't present me or mine with an issue, but I've seen it cause massive frustrations in new people who come to the game, and through talking to them, I understand how the mechanic seems broken. 
---
I'm not here to whine, and they aren't whining either. Merely pointing out that this is heavily biased.
---
Lmao this backfired on you, huh?
---
Old meme when they claimed that old/unpopular maps needed to be removed becuase "data limits" without giving a clear explanation
---
He looks so dumb wearing a suit.
---
This
---
Unless I read it wrong, they made black mirror windows on it right? Everything else is just the way it was?
---
This can‚Äôt be serious...
---
At least we can put muzzle attachments on the deagle tho
---
I like what they changed, and I also like what they kept the same.
---
My bad
---
Or, it was to show that I'm not a new player whining about something I don't understand, but rather a long time player trying to show you that my comments are made by someone who has been around the block a few times.
---
Neither of those modes are what maps are made for, so a ranked system for them just doesn't make sense.
---
This is on Fortress, in one of the Zone Securisation area
---
I dont get why you are against something that would literally won‚Äôt effect you. I‚Äôm more pissed that the game mode I play Exclusively is being taken out the season after I paid for a season pass. It‚Äôs just shady on their part.
---
The only one I can think of was Alibi has some art with an M9, but that‚Äôs it.
---
‚úåüèª
---
Ah damnit. YOU GOT ME THERE. I said you've probably played one ranked game before knowing you were ranked. Oh no my whole life is over
---
#WELL FUCK#
---
Yeah I'm not particularly impressed with the entire game at this point. It feels like the game just kind of went kaput. I've been playing red dead redemption 2. I'll come back when I hear about the next new season. Imma skip this one. ‚úå
---
Still a more cinematic battle than the battle for winterfell
---
What doesn‚Äôt help is that Ubisoft have apparently (I read this on the comments of a post on this sub) diverted most of the siege team to the new ghost recon- they should be focusing on siege if this is to be their long term money maker. Siege has a very different fan base that may not be satisfied with the upcoming ghost recon, just my thoughts on the matter
---
I'm dying here. Please stop üòÇüòÇ idky I found this so funny but at least I got my ab workout in for the day.
---
You are waaaaaaay late
---
!redditbronze
---
Kaid? Hello?
---
In my opinion, he should be 3-speed, 1-armor, as I would assume mobility is higher in a suit than in full combat armor.
---
how is silver elo doing nowadays?
---
I still think you're whining about something you don't understand.
---
It supposedly sound more like nuke than knock.
---
maybe buck
---
She can be invisible.
---
^+ best designed ops by a mile
---
^+ good abilities to change the meta
---
^- reused guns, no new weapon, really lazy
---
^- no new map, just a map rework of an existing one
---
yeah..not sure about this season...
---
So they pick the FMG-9, a universally known bad smg for an attacker? That makes zero sense, even if "data limits" are their reasoning for no new weapons.
---
The patch notes are out, lol. They aren‚Äôt place holders. They legit reused the same guns, didn‚Äôt even bother to re-skin them.
---
Because the operator abilities are recycled from previous operators. Recycled weapons from previous operators. No new maps (Just a minor rework to Kafe)
---
What exactly is there to be excited for next season? 
---
Pick and Ban in Ranked I suppose. 
---
I'll tell you one thing. I'm glad I didn't get the Year 4 pass. I would have been ripped off.
---
I disagree with their logic there I think an attacking healer works fine, if they play well they can easily rotate to eachother for heals.
---
It would affect me? It already does. Queue times are longer than they need to be bc some people play only secure. And Ubi has no obligation to not remove a bad mode from ranked bc you bought a pass lol.
---
Warden look like Gary Oldman as Commisioner Gordon.
---
Idk, calling any playstyle "playing like bitches" is pretty much the definition of whining
---
It‚Äôs bad in comparison with the rest of Smoke‚Äôs loadout, its a laser with decent damage and a standard mag and now has the Vortex sight on it
---
No new map maybe?
---
Bye bye :D
---
Was that a supresser on the Deagle?
---
You probably spend way too much time on YouTube if you want an honest answer
---
I am a 100% secure only player and have adapted to this playstyle along with many others. It is competitive because it is a full on TDM, none of these double set ups. 
---
I wish to f...ck they would revert this as a lot of people do not like nor play bomb in ranked.
---
Glaz on plane is not even close to the same league of bullshit as the clash glitch. You can't win entire games by default just off playing glaz on plane since it's so much easier to counter him. I don't know what to tell you dude, I'm obviously not going to be able to change your mind
---
It's two, Kanal and then Theme Park.
---
Those seem like really weird guns to give them. This is really weird and stupid on Ubis part.
---
If you know what coding is you wouldn't be saying that right now
---
Well, she has the shotgun in trailer and she has the deagle on official picture.
---
Don't get why people are complaining... Ranked is the competitive gamemode, out of all things it should have this rule set and bomb only because yeah it's the competitive gamemode.
---
Hello rykercon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bphyvn/mater_chief_its_too_late/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Didnt read but holy shit ur triggered lmfaoo
---
But both of these ops are going to be incredibly meta changing. An attacker who counters Echo, Valk, Maestro, and Mozzie. And a defender who completely destroys smoke defuser plants. Just because their abilities aren‚Äôt flashy doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt meta changing.
---
Yeah, I thought they would just be changed when they are revealed, fuck me.
---
That‚Äôs definitely a mpx.
---
Yeah new maps have been kinda shit lately like new hereford, fortress, etc. only decent one recently is outback
---
This is the test sever, there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre pushing it to the TS while missing map assets 3 weeks out.
---
Pretty sure his ability is going to be he can‚Äôt get flashed by flashbangs and he can see through smoke grenades thanks to his glasses
---
This are not the weapons trust me
---
I get that they's throw a shotgun in there just so she'd have one but the deagle i mean come on JGK has 3 different secondaries they could've chosen
---
I play almost daily with my girl and my dad, it‚Äôs a great way to connect and stay in touch with the old man. But we collectively have decided to just wait for a week or two until this is patched. None of us want to waste our valuable relaxing game time yanking our hair at obvious cheating
---
... No ... Die ... Spahp ... Kill me
---
There's apparently a weird bug at this time causing the main menu to run at 30 instead of 60, regardless of how powerful your PC is
---
Real shit? Welp my b.
---
I play plat1/Diamond,
---
Never seen glaz being played. Been probably a year since I last seen him played. And even when he is being played, he is easily countered by rushing him (doesn't work on PC, only effective on console).
---
Just remove it. it's simpler. Yes we need something in place for removing the toxic people however people will still be toxic without it.
---
They‚Äôre making it so every deagle can have a suppressor
---
The MAC-11 is an American SMG.  The SMG-12 is a mod kit.
---
Maestro... Jager... Valk... Rook... Shall I keep going?
---
Alibi had beretta, finka a ak74 and iq a 1911 variant that I can‚Äôt remember the name of.

---
I think the guy in the back is castle.
---
Did you ever play with other services like Faceit? You could play like this since a llng time and if this would be a "big" change then the "big" change would've been the season they released it for custom games. I mean implementing it into Ranked can't be to hard.
---
Ya I didn't say they need to, but why would this require to cancel the normal operation map?
---
How about just waiting until its up and running before jumping the gun..
---
...... OK..... Sooooo? For 1 of the 4 seasons you paid for, you get new reload animations and default skins for the same guns you've been using since year 1. Cool. 
---
If you're satisfied with spending your money on that rather than getting all the stuff I listed above AND the new default skins and reload animations that would normally come with new weapons they create from scratch, then power to you.
---
So you know that FMG that you never used but still know exactly how to control? That's what you get. Have fun experimenting with it and figuring out it's effectiveness. How thrilling!
---
Same goes for the other 7 weapons.
---
Yeah, I hear you, and it's unfortunate, which is why I'm forced to play on my smurf.
---
It's really up to preference. SMG-12 is good for close range due to high fire rate and recoil. C75 auto is good for medium range due to lower recoil.
---
Phone
---
1 speed immune to flashes/smoke and has a pump/smg combo seems pretty good to me
---
Its hard to see with the sights, but it still is a very potent gun. Both secondary are good, they both have drawbacks however, just pick the one you prefer
---
Not only an ace but a clutch hell yeah
---
Yes, you cannot shoot her, atleast from my experience. You can't even see her gun
---
I really hope the leak of the weapons a while back were true, otherwise I‚Äôm disappointed.
---
Does it only work on PC?
---
Do we really need ANOTHER hard breather?
---
Can confirm. I play kapkan SASG and Fuze on diamond and do very well with them.
---
The reason she was powerful was because her weapon was too easy to use because the recoil was really low. That's why it was nerfed to what it is now. It wasn't the mag cap or the rpm, although they definitely played a role in making her powerful. Giving her less rng would make it too easy to keep your sites on target and since she has a fast rpm and decent damage output she would be able to end fights way too fast, which is exactly what happened from BO all the way till the nerf.
---
It wasn't the fact that she had no downsides, it was more so the reasons that made her weapon have no downsides that were the problem, namely easy recoil contributed to no downsides.
---
All in all, I believe change recoil to be more controllable is actually a step back in the game's development as those changes were implemented in response to a problem and removing then would more than likely see that issue return.
---
Fluid as hell
---
Smg 12 is her other I only use it because I just can‚Äôt deal with the irons on the c-75 but the c-75 does have way better recoil so I would recomend it for beginners
---
To make the animation fancier? And let's be honest, Smoke has always needed a holo on the FMG
---
üôèüèªNO MORE RAILINGS! üôèüèª
---
C75 all day. Smg12 used to be the best option but it‚Äôs not very good since it got hit with the recoil nerf.
---
He's encouraged to be still. Which is no small nerf. We'll see how it plays out.
---
If this type of nonsense gets posted one more mf time i swear. You know these glitches are here. You know they havent been fixed. So in conclusion stay the fuck out of ranked until they are fixed!
---
I use them recently and I fall in love with c75, but is has not so much ammo.
---
They're designed for bomb with the other two being afterthoughts.
---
Ah, well, wishful thinking on my part
---
They‚Äôre place holders. Video posted on their Instagram account had him holding Valkeries MPX
---
Bartlett's issues were the rampant line of sight most windows had to any attacker spawn point and getting into the map, but once in, it actually had some nice interior design.
---
I actually miss that map and wish Ubi would rework its attack spawn points and add more entry points.
---
Than play them in casual. This will help ranks to be more representative of where you are especially if you solo que.
---
And abilities
---
Yeah! Shootable net sounds really good. Another idea I had was it can partially reinforce walls so you have a soft area to shoot while you are still protected. Similar to the mira
---
Oh, my bad i thought that the deployable sheild glitch needed jager ads to work. 
---
Ouch.
---
If thats the case the DSG isnt so bad that i cant wait 2 weeks for next season, but something needs to be done with clash
---
Different people are working on the glitches than new content. How does the coding/art knowledge on creating new guns and characters translate into fixing weird bugs?
---
Lmao
---
This^
---
Don't mean to be that guy but its pronounced Nuck but its fine
---
Seems like being a mix of Cav and Vigil on attack could be... Very powerful
---
The other gun is the SMG 12. Most people perfer it as it brings back memories of when it was good. It got a huge recoil nerf in Operation Grim Sky. I personally use the SMG 12 as I'm not good with Iron sights
---
I honestly hope they don't change kafe as much. The Hereford base rework is a trash map.
---
This doesn‚Äôt make sense, they kept the old Hereford Base in situation but not the old Cafe?
---
Literally just take away her barbed wire. This seems practical to me and what I was thinking. IQ can't do her glitch without a claymore so give her her Frags back or give her stuns. Take away Clash's barbed and for the meantime either give her a nitro or have only one option as a gadget. Disable deployables and either leave one choice or add impact/nitro/barbed to an operator. It really isn't that hard since they change OPs non-unique gadgets all the time. And it resolves every problem temporarily until they find the root cause.
---
Well, we should have a quarantine system.
---
As soon as an operator has a game breaking glitch, just make them locked and unable to be picked until they patch it.
---
Well most of the people that play this game for a while and buy season passes get them as soon as it comes out to get the "cool" timed universal weapon skin. Or they know they would get it anyways so they say fuck to waiting.
---
It‚Äôs just a flesh wound
---
On ghost recon
---
How about an option to have Solo queuing a priority and if they can't find a match then they put you with premades. Everybody wins with a slightly longer que time.
---
Because we don't need new maps, we have so many maps that are unbalanced and hated, so they are reworking them first before continuing with overloading us with maps.
---
Plus yes I did use Faceit. But now the operator bans and 3 round rotation is becoming more streamlined it will be a huge change. Remember how excited everyone was over the Road to SI? And how next to everyone said they would want it in ranked?
---
Oh yeah, I wouldn't want Ubi to completely follow OW's systems, just the one that prevents grandmasters from partying up with bronzes and queuing up for ranked.
---
Np. they just didn't have much of anything to show off when they were revealing map reworks during SI since it's planned for Y4S4
---
Those leaks are from the tts it went live today on accident
---
People are already playing the TTS as Ubi accidentally sent the update and the leaks are correct
---
They are not. They didn't for the 6games in-between R6 and Breakpoint so I don't know why they would now.
---
Mmm. Nothing has been announced. The guns are possibly placeholders
---
So we're going to see that on May 19th when pro league finals are and see who's right.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy bomb, I prefer secure area. Ranked wouldn‚Äôt be the same if it was just one mode.

---
Not as much as you üò´
---
Makes sense. Although I dont know why they dont have separate teams
---
Ubi‚Äôs cock is waiting, why don‚Äôt you go suck on it some more
---
I think so. Maverick really doesn‚Äôt fill the role of main breacher really. That‚Äôs just my opinion though. Plus I wanted a hard breacher for every speed rating, and have more options overall
---
But none of that was in game, was it? This is actually in game. In the game, Nokk has a FMG-9 and a Deagle. In the game, Warden has a MPX and 5.7.
---
And besides, none of those examples are the same. When the game first came out, all the promo shit had operators using other operators guns. IQ was no different with the M45 MEU. Then Alibi, a Beretta 92FS. A gun that never arrived - That's different, that's not re-using old shit. I've never seen anything with Finka using a AK, you may be confusing it for the Saiga 12, which is under the AK pattern.
---
Last time this happened as majorly as this, it took 5 weeks. 
---
Blitz could ADS with his shield up and rush - console had to wait till the next season for a patch
---
See my problem is I'm at a point where I can't play casual cause I'm use to the formalities of ranked. People do dumb shit and take dumb peeks that would get you shred in ranked and get rewarded for it.
---
yes, it's not 50 / 50 cuz the game is a little defender sided, but that doesn't change the fact bomb is way more balanced and way closer to the 50/50 mark than secure area. The main point is bomb is MORE balanced then secure area and hostage which in ranked is what we need, an even playing field

No he isn't, he can literally still move for a short period while being able to see through smoke, which I think is being done more for the sake of console players due to the importance of the left analog stick when aiming but this still allows Glaz to entry frag effectively. If you're decent at reading other players and have good reflexes you can still play Glaz sort of like before, it's just harder and riskier now. I do agree that these changes mess up long range Glaz and that they were also pretty unnecessary now that they're adding an op that can counter him.
---
I wouldn't say recycled. They are putting a new spin on a already existing idea
---
It's FREE. Oh my God.
---
Don't call yourself the R6 Community, you're one salty person.
---
&gt; level 340 consistent Plat 1 - 2 and I have over 6 thousand played as secure
---
Let's see where you'll end up next season after switching from arguably the easiest game mode (really, most of secure mains I've met are bots) to the real one :)
---
is cav racist it looks like *black face*
---
Finally a worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!
---
Bet he won the round though.
---
I‚Äôd recommend what I‚Äôve been doing I join very competitive 5v5s
---
Because Aussies are cooler
---
Why am I wrong?
---
joke's on you, I disabled hostage and secure 1500 hours ago
---
Flashbangs, being too near a breach charge going off, most explosions, and the 12 year old Ash mains screaming REEEEEEEEWEEEWEE when they rush in and hit a Frost matt 6 seconds into the round
---
Invisibility and immunity to DMG other than sometimes setting off Frost Traps or GU Mines.
---
Free as in I have to spend time or money to get it? Stop calling me salty when you can't defend anything your saying
---
But now it plays like every other map. I do miss sieges uniqueness.
---
Agreed, she only has close quarters weapons at the moment which I feel is bad.. but they could be placeholder weapons so they might not be final- I still have my hopes for the Galil for N√∏kk
---
Hehehehehehhe
---
I can only guess that as an attacker she could get to the obj too fast and easy if she was 3 speed. IIRC they have added only 3 speeds attackers 3 times (Capitao, Hibana, Maverick).
---
Same, but I bet reworking this kind of gadget is so important, willing to bet they take extra care to not allow the face shield and other exploits don't happen with the new one.
---
\&gt;reused weapons
---
\&gt;reused animations
---
\&gt;reused abilities
---
There is literaly nothing new this season.
---
Leave it to Ubi to completely destroy any and all hype for the new season.
---
eh i just spray and waste my ammo on the piano
---
That's so cool omg
---
Maybe recycling one gun, but none of theirs seem to be original. Plus why a smg with no ACOG for a 3 armor? Not even gonna mention the ridiculousness of him being a 3 armor
---
Sorry I posted it multiple times
---
Not saying they should just saying I‚Äôm used to being let down
---
Yeah but her ability only lasts about 5 seconds and her weapons are horrible, so the 3 speed could somewhat make her more viable
---
well it's free but you pay for the game, and many people pay for the season pass to have these operators without having to farm for them, and I don't think anyone with the season pass wants to pay to have reused operators  
---
can't you just agree that they are being lazy this season?
---
The trigger doesn't even move. His fingers go straight through it when he presses it.
---
"Bet u steal art too"
---
I honestly think that its because there is starting to be to many operators. Even just one new operator creates balancing changes and yaadaa yaadaa. Adding new weapons creates another hurdle. I don't care to much if they use older weapons, it just needs to be a good combo of weapons. For example the person who chose the weapon combos for both new operators should be fired.
---
Fuck you bomb is superior
---
Maybe you should get some friends to queue up with...
---
don‚Äôt want to take anything away from you but please tell me you didn‚Äôt do the IQ glitch
---
That's a way to shame u down aswell for supporting him. What's ur iq
---
Why is everybody only excited for guns? I mean, It should be the gadget that matters
---
I swear 20 of my kills had to be luck lmao
---
Why do they base a operator around the danish Frogments, when they say she is from the danish Jaegerkorps.  
---
It's like saying black beard's CTU is Rangers. I mean it is maybe too late but, it does not fit. At least in my oppinion.
---
I like bomb better.
---
You mean a new reload animation that will be for their new weapons
---
Secure area can be just as competitive and a lot of people prefer that to bomb, and like ranked. I think them taking secure area out as an option will ruin the game for a lot of people, i bet the community will shrink by 25-30% after this. This game is on its way to the grave. Devs need to learn to leave well enough alone
---
Dude, that‚Äôs still lit af
---
I have 929 hours of play time in Secure Area... WTF...
---
Really? An MPX and a Dessert Eagle? Recycle much ubi?
---
The gadgets seem to be pretty shit so yeah I'm pretty disappointed in this season
---
I've seen diamonds doing it on console. Ranked on xbox is such a joke anyway. 
---
In addition to these glitches, the vast majority of high level players use keyboard and mouse. The top players use kbm and hack. ddosing, server crashing, and lag switching are not uncommon at all.
---
Hello GodSpeedK1llua, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpiuer/help/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That's odd, since they have unique animations for the guns they have now.
---
I didn't even know there was an IQ glitch, I know about the Clash and Deployable glitch but I didn't use either of those I promise.
---
As someone who has tried and succeeded at this glitch i would kove grenades insted it gives no advantage to both teams and i would love grenades back
---
Shit, better nerf Blackbeard
---
I'm still holding out hope for a third weapon. If you look at their loadouts you can see any empty third slot.
---
Warden orange justices on ying‚Äôs grave as N√∏kk stabs caveira and vigil repeatedly
---
Imagine if they made it hostage only
---
Awesome! Glad to hear it! Good job man
---
Why no AR for N√∏kk?
---
Other than the glasses, which imo is lame. I think Nokks gadget is pretty nice.
---
Bro you just said you suck
---
can you play the now?!
---
the MPX I really like and I don't mind at all, but the six12 and the fmg9? fuck those two
---
Like ops or strats?
---
You don't even understand how to debate a point without getting your feelings involved. I can easily defend what I'm saying, I've been doing it this whole time. Maybe take some time off from being a neurotic child and go take a walk...? 
---
With that out of the way, If you enjoy the game and play it constantly, there's no reason that you should not have the renown for the new operators. They never promised new guns with every season and I completely understand why they would reuse certain weapons. On top of the theorized data limits, it also allows them to be able to balance a pool of weapons that doesn't have 4 to 6 being added every 3 months. New operators with old weapons also allows those weapons to see the light of day in different situations. The FMG9 is getting a new sight and apparently a buff, it's going to be interesting seeing it on the Attacker side. This also allows them to legitimize giving skins to operators off-weapons. The FMG9 is hardly ever used on smoke, it'll be utilized quite a bit on Nokk. i.e. they can actually make money on those skins. Same with the integrally suppressed shotgun.

Playing on  the  same few maps for eternity gets  boring  though,  especially  if  there's  more than  one  map you  hate - getting  these multiple times  a session really drains the will  to  play   the game out of  the game. Sure, the casual queue  has a  couple  of unplayable maps (namely  Favela and  Tower),   but I'm not  asking  to   bring   these to ranked (though I  wouldn't  mind Yacht  at all)  - I'm asking  not  to make  the ranked  experience  even more repetitive only  so  that people can feel like they're  pros. Theme Park, as frustrating  as  depressing  and eye-tiring  as  it may  be, is  balanced enough   for the  ranked  queue,  and so are some other maps  that  aren't played  on the   pro  league.
---
No that I know of
---
Plus just how in unplanned it feels. Feels like they got carried away on something else and kinda forgot about the ops until last minute, ya know, the forefront of the operation. Really hope were all wrong and this season is great, but things aren‚Äôt looking hot.
---
I believe Blur studio made the cinematic shots and operator intros.
---
Seeing that they really like rehashing old operators and changing them slightly, who knows
---
I don‚Äôt think he did. Because kill cams for it keep them in the spawn/where it was performed (which is usually the spawn) and this guy is well inside the map.
---
It's ok, but it's not anything new or original, I'd be completely fine with reused guns if the gadgets were something we haven't seen before
---
She better have an ACOG on that SMG. Please Ubisoft, have mercy.
---
Please give the mpx a acog
---
operators
---
Not only does N√∏kk have unoriginal guns, they are absolute shit. I mean her secondaries are both pretty decent,but our choices for her primarys are either. The worst smg in the game, or one of the worst shotguns in the game
---
Not mad but when I solo queue I prefer secure. Don't really want to have to play bomb by myself with 4 teammates who don't communicate
---
Shit, too many glitches
---
No, they have a unique reload animation for the guns they have now.
---
Feels bad man siege feels pretty broken overall right now.
---
How long are you playing a night?
---
Good but people glitch in ranked
---
Yeah I'm just done for the day
---
[Please don‚Äôt!](https://i.imgur.com/HvtXJ8q.jpg)
---
Holy shit. I would probably fap to this
---
That's just the new layout as some other operators have three weapons.
---
I highly doubt they'll get any new weapon.
---
Im not going to post a link because the embargo isnt lifted but it was gameplay of nokk with smokes smg on oregon and the new kafe. How in the actual fuck can you 'jump' to a conclusion if the conclusion is already made ? The operators teaser trailers HAVE the weapons listed IN GAME at the operator screen and operator choose screen IN GAME. When have they EVER given random weapons to operators on the tts ? Ive seen restricted gameplay of y1s4 and y2s1 before there was tts and before they officially revealed those seasons and yet both atk and def had the weapons shown when they were announced. Its not a fucking jump to conclusion, it is the conclusion
---
A team needs to do it on-stage, right in front of everyone, use it to completely shit on the other team, then forfeit the match after that round to show the whole world how Siege is *really* being played right now.
---
That is probably the only thing that would get Ubisoft to finally buckle down and make some changes; being embarrassed like that during their own event.
---
I didn‚Äôt say these ops weren‚Äôt changing the meta. I‚Äôm just worried because if they keep recycling abilities and weapons, there is a point where the meta stops changing.
---
What kinds?
---
Im done arguing over shit thats literally in the game. You can see in 2 weeks
---
Dont forget, you also get a fmg9 on attack
---
Look here boi, keyboard warriors are pussies. So yes the whole world knows that your internet personality reflects your real personality. Check my post history and comments and you'll understand the exact kind of person I am. Reddit doesn't lie, it just shows the real you when the doors close and the lights turn off.
---
Best temporary solution. Bye now losers!
---
I bought the standard 20‚Ç¨ edition about 2 weeks ago. All base ops are available for 1000 renown. And I was saving up for Maverick (25000) and now I'm collecting all base ops after which I'm going to the more intricate ones.
---
Right, because we all put Secure and Hostage in Ranked mode. It was us that did that.  LMAO at kids like you who think they're good.
---
I hoesntly just prefer Secure Area. I don't care if that makes me a worse player or whatever. You switch sides anyways so I don't really see how it's not considered competive. Each team has an equal opportunity to win and it comes down to skill and strategy in the end.
---
In response to u/MTheTomeSweeper, the opportunity was there! ü§£
---
You're right, they're the type to complain about it being a dumb change, get stuck in gold, and stop playing.
---
^^Sorry ^^not ^^sorry ^^^Secure ^^^Diamonds*
---
An alive defender has priority. Even if it‚Äôs your valk cam for example. If no one is on the cam then a dead defender can control it, but the second a alive defender switches to it they get the control.
---
Yea it‚Äôll probably be just like the last one lol
---
people who play this game competitively want ranked to be like pro league. if you don‚Äôt like it then play casual
---
Basically what the other guy said, they also changed how cav and capitao looked too, now cav actually looks Brazilian
---
But at the same time, people don't fucking plant and would rather go for that last kill.
---
Diamond.  The problem is that the character's utility is entirely dependent upon him surviving, and succeeding in fragging through the smoke.  
---
It's a fragging anchor. Every other anchor has universal utility.  Situational/individual utility has almost never been meta in this game.
---
Let‚Äôs hope they actually fix it
---
Not when people stop playing
---
Warden with the donut operator mustache
---
For practice rounds, agreed. If you‚Äôre looking for a legit Thunt you need to deal with the bombers. But for just map and gun practice, I‚Äôve been feeling this way since White Noise
---
Dealing with runouts its better than dealing with glitches
---
Keep it to my guy, it's pretty cool to see it fill up more and more
---
With all the glitches, cheats, and toxic dummies.. They're working on it.
---
They're not even going to be subtle about it, huh?
---
Now that you mention it damn I wish it was that
---
It's pretty much a placebo button.
---
FYI, any op with a deployable shield can do the glitch this time around.
---
pisses me off they gave those shit guns
---

That could just be new animations/attachments for those guns or operators in general. If they are real they are terrible choices, Valk‚Äôs marshmallow shooter is only balanced because her kit is so strong, it‚Äôd be terrible for a 3 speed. FMG9 is probably the worst smg on defense and attackers generally get better guns to balance them out. Unless the stats are completely different, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Guess we‚Äôll find out Sunday.
---
Ok, but people are paying for the Season Pass and they are free to not even give new weapons but choose randomly some of the old ones?  
---
Come -fuckin- on, that's just ridicolous.
---
One is a defender and the other is an attacker.
---
Yeah, slowly filling up.
---
Holy shot they actually did something.
---
Credit where credit is due, good on ‚Äòem!
---
They said that they might could provide a fix to the exploits next week, so I guess barbed wire will have to do the trick until then lol!
---
Anyone know when this starts? And will the horrible glitches be fixed before then?
---
Well, in the real world if you own a franchise like Rainbow6 it takes work.
---
I don‚Äôt need a sob story about developers. There are games without glitches. If this game carries on with the glitches, then me and many others will leave the community.
---
That is highly relevant information for them to know.
---
Good (or not so good as a Clash main) news OP  [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-349909-16/update-live-exploits](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-349909-16/update-live-exploits)
---
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY KEPT IQ'S GRENADES!
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing because of the exploits, as soon as I heard of them I just stopped. The game is toxic enough at times as is. I‚Äôll wait it out then hop back on
---
I keep thinking Dad warden memes are going to be a thing
---
Wow, I am actually thoroughly impressed. Ubi actually doing something about the problem instead of letting the entire game go to shit for 3 weeks while it's fixed.
---
Good job on them.
---
garbage. like always
---
It does have its own strategy but it just really isn't as balanced that's what makes it more competitive. I would just try to play some bomb in casual to get the hang of it more
---
They don't care we can even threaten them and they still won't listen to us, I remember when people asked for Dokkaebi for the K1A that Vigil has because they complained she only had a DMR and shotgun, it's not fair but they've never added new weapons for a DLC operator, But the least they could do is let us use an ACOG for the FMG-9 that's the shit I don't like.
---
Hopefully we see exploits in future being dealt with like this, and hopefully more quickly. Good job.
---
On another note I would like to point out that since year 3 we have been getting only one version of new maps, a day version. I would love to see the recent maps of year 3 and 4 including the future reworked versions to have a night version for casual playlist added to the game, more map versions seems only fair for the lack of "new content" we are going to have,
---
This isn't Titanfall bud. If you're asking this you clearly weren't here for Maestro's release. Shit actually ruined the for me for like 2 weeks
---
Not if you actually hit someone with it.
---
They're "rainbow" operators. They are no longer held down by their previous units. They can use whatever weapons they choose. Just think about them walking in to rainbow HQ and picking a gun off the wall.
---
Top 10 anime battles
---
I GUESS SHE GOT SOME BIG ASS HANDS THEN BC ITS A FULL SIZED DEAGLE
---
The spark seems to indicate I dinged the copy machine or whatever, right? Because my ACOG is definitely right on home boy's brain when I pull that trigger.
---
at least give them the ones that are good and fun to used to valkyrie and smokes...................
---
Understandable, definitely would practice up on it as they are super super helpful
---
That's a mine field my guy
---
Still think it was a missed opportunity to give the FiveseveN to the secret service since they actually use them but that's just my personal gripe.
---
Is clash gone. Can I come back and play now?
---
This is the funnest part of the game, legit enjoy unlocking all them. Have fun!!! I‚Äôve played since year 2 so I didn‚Äôt have as many
---
dear diary....
---
Lmao I saw the gadget on her glove and couldn't help myself
---
I play to have fun with friends while also being competitive. If ubi wants all players to have a esports like experience, then just make another game mode. I like the idea, but I also enjoy not having pick and ban on ranked
---
She will disabled tonight.
---
Ok retard
---
lmao
---
Clubhouse needed a complete rework of the top floor, like Kafe got for the bottom floor. Then ubi buffed the other floors just a smidgen.
---
Yes!  Now how i have friday saturday sunday and monday free i can get renown!  Thanks ubi
---
I LOVE playing this game competitively, but the 3 round rotation really didn‚Äôt play well for me.
---
Casual is too casual these days.. you can‚Äôt play seriously on cas
---
Agreed. This exactly.
---
The gadget animations are so smooth, I love them already.
---
Without ACOG?
---
Oh lord no not as an op, but as a game mode like outbreak.
---
As someone else mentioned a lot like the half life mod: Hidden Source
---
Does this mean Nobody will have Claymores, or just IQ?
---
Hey! I was about to say that
---
in their defense, the DMR is not that bad and has at least an acog
---
I do have a lot of ops to play, which is why I‚Äôm not upset that much. It‚Äôs mostly my mates who I‚Äôm worried about, as they only play a few ops.
---
I hate the "Less queue times" excuse, there's 2 sections of the game split into 3 gamemodes. There are millions of players on all the time, It's not like I have to wait that long for a game.
---
Really, the same weapons? 
---
Yeah I bet USSS agents use MPX smgs, unless they do.
---
And Fromandskorpset are definetly going to be using loud and cumbersome 50 caliber hand cannons as their sidearms.
---
I hope they at least change Nokk's pistol.
---
I think it can be justified lore-wise as all of the CTUs being connected within Rainbow 6. Not that I think the choices make sense, eg. real life secret service using short-barreled P90s means Warden had an obvious reuse case. But yeah, I agree.
---
They are already disabling clash, deployable shields and claymores tomorrow. Check the @Rainbow6Game twitter. No need for these changes.
---
I personally don‚Äôt notice any difference with Cav but maybe it‚Äôs cus the make up. But I mean Echo still looks like a Japanese-American
---
Nobody will have claymores by the sound of it.
---
Oh look, she's being removed, looks like I was right.
---
Likely nobody.
---
Totally agree. Disappointed
---
It's like they took a bunch of rarely used guns and gave it to these 2 (obviously the deagle being the exception because it's mandatory for Valk and BB).
---
Yes it is. There‚Äôs a skill base system in both casual and ranked
---
Just tryna say something. Ain't gotta be a troll
---
I'm 90 percent positive that it depends on your rank.
---
You just have to play more to learn them, it really doesn't take as long as you should think
---
That's a good question
---
What're the glitches? I don't think I've seen them, to be honest.
---
Nobody
---
I was here for maestros release, but I'm talking about all operators, CSGO style with recoil and rng. Maestro was a lot different with his hip fire spread, and I don't want it in the game. It's a discussion
---
I guess.
---
Yeah I'm one to play all 3, but sometimes like to play secure of I'm solo queing.
---
Does your grammar even works lol
---
You make a good point. I hope though that we will nit see the current 4 rounds to win.
---
O
---
Hello sportsguy4life, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpjuu5/ubisoft_is_updating_the_game_tonight_to_fix/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Their special abilities are pretty good so maybe this is their way of not making them too op.
---
I'd rather get to play secure and pick my objective for once, Can I not get fucking bar on clubhouse or VISA office on consulate? I hate those open rooms that I would logically never pick.
---
But still tho, I enjoy not having pick and ban. I think it‚Äôs a great idea, but it would suit another game mode. Maybe this other game mode rewards more elo or maybe it‚Äôs just personal preference? I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôm not all that worried. Do enjoy playing hibana tho, rip
