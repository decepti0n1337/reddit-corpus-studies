Oh yeah what's your rank mate? post your username in here and we'll compare stats

I disagree.

the year one ops are like 10k reknown and the year 3/4 are a lot more

I thought the only gun you could buy it for was frost shotgun?
---
Asked the twitter account. No response.

Thats about how I am mine was under 50 for sure and have yet to get another

They dont Clutch: No Problem

You dont Clutch: Votekick 3/4

It's in Italy. Its ezio

I‚Äôm 113 and have none so at least u got one

Do you even know what black ice is?

lol
---
Good to know, also can we call it the bridge?
---
Thanks. Definitely gonna use that
---
This sub is such AIDS.
---
House
---
I was thinking something more along the lines of what CS:GO did, where the first reload utilizes the extra mag, and then you just keep reloading the gun normally
---
Are all of these plane cosplays being posted by one person or is everbody on the sub renting planes
---
Yeah, you used to be able to but it for frost shotgun
---
Because it‚Äôs more consistent this way, more consistency= more competitive = fairer games.
---
When the game had somewhat barely game out you were able to buy it for all guns available at the time if I remember correctly and luckily I bought it
---
You will not be missed
---
Extraordinayr
---
No. Do you know where it originated from?
---
Ha, I got the best legendary charm, the banana! "For scale"

Oregon
---
Yes i think they should, this would help immensely with choosing the next operator you want to save up for and unlock especially for new players that don't want to buy the season pass yet. It would also be nice to already be able to get comfortable with an operator before you would be able to unlock it  if for example you can only play a couple of hours a day. Although you could use the test server because iirc it should always be live now but would be nice to just be able to play with them in the live buils.
---
Yup. Not sure why people cannot grasp this.
---
I guess not
---
Ah, yes, the lords tit milk
---
COD joke?
---
They just fucking fixed it
---
Ohh nice
---
Maybe he's talking about the fact that Ember Rise had just 1 Elite.
---
I'm on PlayStation, there's no hackers here
---
Hit headshots.
---
It's really not that different.
---
Doesnt play amaru. Puts in two cents anyways even though you're wrong. Makes sense. I'm not saying you're wrong about smashing through site windows but even as a defender, if it's a slightly off site window, you still have more than enough time from window break to her entering to get over there and take her out. That's the problem.
---
Reminds me of Piemations
---
Thanksgiving is over I ain't grateful
---
The fact you didn't die throughout that whole thing is insane. But good job
---
I mean they announced capitao at the end of burnt horizon. Maybe they‚Äôll do 2 more this season? Because Cav and Ela have been leaked.
---
Casual is fucking garbage and not remotely competitive lol. Changing the round rotation does not change anything.
---
It was a seasonal skin in the first ever season of siege. That‚Äôs when he‚Äôs saying he bought it and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so ‚Äúrare‚Äù.
---
Shit looks clean

But why do they have to make it more fair

You're the enemy of the people.

Yeah those guys weren‚Äôt the best but I was scared out my mind.
---
&gt;Removing Casual  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No, just renamed to quick play.
---
Erm, not exactly. AA/DD rotations to emulate ranked for casual play that literally no one asked for. Pretty sure that's what he meant by removing casual as it's now ranked lite between this and limited map pools.
---
Hahahaha that‚Äôs perfect!!
---
It makes an overall uniform experience. Why have extra confusion when switching between game modes when you dont need it. It doesnt hurt anyone to change it so why not?
---
I mean Hibana and Echo are already the Japanese ops.
---
Give him immunity to the ringing after an explosion is something minor I would like but it would not help him much
---
I‚Äôm a level 93 right now and the closest I‚Äôve got to it is the common iceman skin and I also don‚Äôt expect to get black ice any time soon :(
---
It's either Kafe or Border.
---
I really liked the old Hereford base and Bartlett uni. In the current map pool, I'll answer coastline
---
Don‚Äôt turn away without cutting off that angle, move away while watching the angle and then look away. 
---
Also why just stare at some angle when you don‚Äôt know if someone is coming. Check cams or something.
---
Me too, but Oregon got removed from ‚Äúquick‚Äù match. :(
---
I got the original one yesterday, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so mad
---
Wait that wasnt only in the beta, that shit still happens as of yesterday
---
I was about a say how in the God damn hell did you rent a fuckin 747
---
Are you talking bout the ice skin?
---
Agreed, I was just curious.
---
&gt;Casual is just renamed to quick match,
---
Demonstrably false. Quick match now implements AA/DD rotations like ranked now.
---
idk, sometimes if you get lucky you can see they are aiming and the sight is like too far to even see the holo
---
Level 131, i have 3, ak12 ,9√ó19, and fmg9
---
No, the mp5 black ice

The sheer amount of cheese behind that kill. Opponent definitely threw their controller
---
I‚Äôm mad that I got a duplicate the day after I got it the first time
---
Says the unicorn main.
---
As a console player casual was how we met new players for ranked or just for messing around it gives the guy that sucks a chance to play with the friend group and mess around
---
Pear.
---
Doubt they'll go full single country season. Maybe just an attacker or defender.
---
Me: buys 24 hr booster
---
Ubisoft: new update launched
---
Ubisoft: server maintenance
---
3 hr later.... servers are back up
---
Me: have to leave for work :(
---
Nah they are good you start in your last rank and if win you go a lil bit up , if you lose you go a lil bit down and lastly you get a rank between the last match u did and your rank from last season
---
THANK GOD
---
That would be great, especially with one of the best players in the world being Greek (Hyper I think).
---
You have to guess whether that's a yes or a no.
---
This cartoon is from an instagram account named sau seige, please follow him as he made this cartoon.
---
It‚Äôs based from the last rank and the 2500 mmr everyone start with, if you are match against new or vets then you are at the same skill level.
---
I'd be happy with a 2 or less queue. A couple of my friends derank so that they get an 'even' match when the inevitable 5 stack pops up.
---
When I saw the trail I thought it was a smoke grenade
---
no one asked you to post that clip either and here we are. &lt;3
---
That makes sense, thanks!
---
Not really that shitty tbh but yes a weird bug
---
Wow like relax bud
---
You are right! I thought it worked the same for every part of the body, my bad
---
Luison seems fine. Nothing else concerns me.
---
&gt; There is nothing quiet about it.
---
Yeah, that's why he said WOULD be broken, not IS broken
---
Valkyrie spawn peak? ;)
---
i would be so pissed if i was Kali lmao
---
To be fair, only us OG's automatically assume everything is a bug due to the history of this game. 
---
People who have joined recently probably don't realise every new patch comes along with it an ocean of problems. Not all games are like this so I get why the default assumption for most people isn't "it's a bug". We're just all hardened by 4 years of consuming spaghetti.
---
I think in the near future I might change my mind since it's the first day of the season but it might be useful, especially on smaller maps but a operator like Doc or Rook will always be the default spawnpeekers since they have the decent range and the magazine capacity compared to Vigil unless they buff the range of it I think the BOSG Acog will become irreverent within the first few weeks of the season just because it is a meme feature but fun nonetheless.
---
Are you with the valkyrie cosplayer on the planes
---
This is great.
---
You made me realize they are both bird's never new zofia's was one
---
Flash&gt;Frags . OK buddy
---
It was only supposed to be a meme. It was because kaid had an acog on his shotgun

Im not saying tk him if he goes goyo again after trying before but.......
---
rented a plane?
---
Oh, ok thanks
---
Sweet I just get my position revealed for 4 agonizing pings instead of 5 because I did something so forbidden as to fucking WALK. Jackal is bad game design, and just needs to be removed. His central premise is to make people stand still. You can't strategize around him because you don't know he was picked until after prep. He's almost as bad as launch LION.
---
Never rush the last guy. Especially when that last guy is belt fed.
---
It was barely negative and technically highest pick rate to
---
Well you can only mute/report him if he is in your game.
---
Nice
---
this was my first game of the new season, off to a great start so far!
---
This isnt siege?
---
Why did she have the Mike Wazowski face at the end though
---
You can literally tell his monitor has a 1.5 ms response. 1.0 and he wont see this problem
---
That's true, but Kaid's shotgun is more forgiving for missing shots and is more versatile personally speaking.
---
r/lostredditors
---
But it‚Äôs not a double barreled meme cannon
---
Still a trash gun. People will use it for a day or two and go back to the K1A and MK14. Content Creators will make a video or two about it and move on. It was a silly meme and I‚Äôm surprised Ubi actually added it, if only they listened when we were asking for P90 on warden, but nah we got 2 speed warden.
---
Oh, sweet. Not a bad switch imo
---
Mmmm. I can already hear Vigil‚Äôs gun from the entrance of the plane trying to spawnpeek me.
---
That and Tf2
---
Facts
---
Oh man lol I hate having/seeing clips like this. It really shows just how broken it is.
---
Probably 10-30$ considering content wise
---
Charm for what?
---
It makes ubi money to not have data transfer so i doubt they will ever add it
---
It is, I hope Ubisoft will listen to the community on more serious issues rather than just pay attention to the memes. Both should be heard out but I think fixing gameplay and addressing the needs of the communities first.
---
 No
---
Won't even connect for me
---
Did they buff ela smg? Or it‚Äôs just me ?
---
I do. I play casual because I don‚Äôt like ranked rules and limited maps, but now both are slowly being implemented into casual. Leave ranked and unranked for the sweats and newcomer to the new players, casual was never broken and nobody complained about it.
---
Renting a plane doesn't necessarily mean flying said plane
---
Happens to me all the time on xbox
---
except Ela was proper broken, even pass owners agreed (for the most part) and now she's balanced.  Not everyone is out to get you my guy.  Ubisoft is a company, ofc they want money, but they aren't using balancing to get it.
---
This is good but Operation Chimera had the best out of all. Hands down
---
That it does.
---
well, what I do when people do shit like this is try my best to make sure they don't get the ops.

Sure ela was broken and that's the point lmao. "hey guys this operator is broken as fuck" 
---
"HOLY SHIT I SHOULD BUY IT"
---
Ikr I hate it
---
Really... what r u copper, no one ever rotates thru the door unless ur in cooper... it‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt see the wall which rotation was made, was covered by stack of cocaine, now it can
---
lol plane isn‚Äôt even in ranked
---
its the same thing but it will never be the same R.I.P casual ‚úå
---
I think it‚Äôs done for balancing issues. If it was like this, the gun would be busted and we‚Äôll have another smg12 on our hands. So no
---
Idk they do keep them close but the way it is now looks like the gun couldn't be more than 8 inches away from the character's nose. Nobody does that.
---
The solution is that defender weapons shouldn't have infinite range one shot headshots but no one wants to accept that.
---
I know it‚Äôs the same but it‚Äôs just not the same
---
All of them
---
Idk but if you cancel the update while its downloading it will delete siege altogether so theyre obviously tied in some way
---
I mean in many games new characters are broken and OP, then they'll get nerfed to fuck soon as people have paid for them. For honour was like that with some characters too. 
---
Also Ela is pretty weak rn.
---
Where do you find it?
---
It's supposed to instadown regardless of hit location (except headshot i assume)
---
Not going to lie the cosplays are so cool and I‚Äôm honestly amazed by the amount of effort u guys put into these cosplays. I could never do this myself so hats off to you.
---
I honestly think the guns r kinda oversized in the games. Pistols especially so
---
Ok retard.
---
How would that impact the game in any meaningful way? Most combat in R6 is in extreme close quarters.
---
The only map that has that stupid possibility is plane.
---
Yep
---
Hey lmao. I was in that game.  Was a nutty flick.
---
Type in thermite with m870. It's got  that, smoke in the stack, fuze holding what looks like a 57 or 1911.
---
He's thinkin on why Ubi took away his plug walk
---
With the supernova like an absolute unit
---
Tbf you did that in casual anyway just not back to back. I still don't like it though. If I wanted to play something structured like ranked I'd play unranked.
---
My Xbox can‚Äôt connect either
---
Yea
---

I'm a long time platinum, but now that you've resorted to petty and pointless insults, I'm just gonna say bye.

My GT on xbox is k1llj0y1027 if you wanna search my stats

Cant sorry, the mats are how I contribute to the team. Be wary of which window you jump into

4 maps I don‚Äôt play great and 2 I feel 50/50
---
Ugh give frost barbed wire back
---
Massive downgrade
---
Yeah, I previewed it on the BOSG and was not sure about it shooting 12g rounds. Still some nice detail though
---
That or kicked
---
It's always done that.
---
Better idea, don't grab the new op EVERY SINGLE ROUND and I won't tk you. Sharing is caring.
---
Damn how long has he been squatting there
---
dont worry we will all remember it and it dhall be in our hearts
---
Ouch
---
Well they are 12 gauge but they are slugs.
---
Sounds about right
---
Her HP tho... feelsbadman
---
What grade is this in?
---
5 for me
---
Yey
---
it‚Äôs not the same it‚Äôs 2round if attack/defence then switch before it was attack defend attack defend ect now its attack attack defend defend
---
U couldn‚Äôt have done one of an op that doesn‚Äôt suck? Like hibana or sum?
---
Unless you have a friend
---
You must be new here.. lol all jokes aside. This is sadly just common by now. Give it a week and it‚Äôll die down. Other than that play Ranked/Unranked it‚Äôll help a little with the TK. But as far as Casual or Quick Play now, it‚Äôs every man for himself.
---
Hold up this might be a stupid question but did you rent a FUCKING PLANE for this picture
---
That gif ending was perfect.
---
The new attacker op released today
---
This is happening to me on PC
---
Play casual
---
and favela

[Here is a nice dev blog rewritten by the devs that worked on the ranked matchmaking explaining how it works](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-277344-16&amp;ct=tcm:154-76770-32)
---
Yeah drawbacks of toxic community like to ban new ops bc they think it's funny that ppl pay 20$ to get their shit banned
---
Same issue here on PS4. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs some bug. This same issue happened for me when phantom sight dropped
---
Hey das realistic though
---
Fuze must have mastered the power of the tornado from Wamuu.
---
If you are randomly getting hit by kali, that means you are randomly just standing in the open without cover. 
---
Or getting droned out and not moving out of that location.
---
Yes
---
I love the base.skins I leave the P12 stock
---
am I witnessing a meme retcon?
---
Kali is similar to the AWP on csgo rather than the semi autos. i dont really get what you mean by faster recoil.
---
Specs
---
If for a player that died of cancer ( i think) 
---
So his name is probably for this but it‚Äôs j the game for the player that died
---
Nah, rushing the last guy over and over instead of just holding angles on the defuser that he HAS to get is 100% throwing lol.
---
The tradeoff is worse ttk and shit sights for a better recoil.
---
Nah man,in cas ppl do that all the time in a 5v1, svwn in gold ranked lol
---
40mm of healing goodness baby.
---
This statement hurts.
---
There‚Äôs no bot in siege
---
Lolololol okay so for an hour, from 3am to 4am your time, you‚Äôve been trying to convince a 12 year old boy that he‚Äôs gay. That is actually fucking hilarious. Normal people do not do this
---
Ah that makes sense, "keep playing forever" that's thoughtful of them to put his name in the game.
---
its going to be $40 atleast in aus. It's always been the same price each year. Also year 5 will most like be announced/out in feb next year. It will be showcased in the invitational 2020.
---
Ah shit. Here we go again.
---
The game isn't fun when there isn't anything to learn. Oh wow I sure need to learn how to Use a fucking sniper.
---
Plug your PC into port 1 of your router / gateway
---
I honestly can‚Äôt do this anymore as I am bored as fuck but I hope you took none of that seriouslyüòÇ
---
Not toxic. More like because people probably haven‚Äôt played them yet and they don‚Äôt won‚Äôt people learning new ops in their ranked games. Especially someone like Kali who will probably be awful if you can‚Äôt play her well.
---
gg
---
couldn‚Äôt lose that üòÇ
---
If you ain't using  the bartlett university skin, your wrong
---
why tf does quickplay have map pool rotation?
---
^(STOP TAKING MY HOUSE YOU FUCKS)
---
But a limited time bundle would not harm the game...quite the opposite they would make some money
---
Why do i keep seeing cosplayers at this plane? where tf was this? Is there a tour of the plane?
---
Yeah I love collecting the nice skins
---
Yea, I kinda feel like they are going to be completely nerfed to hell like everyone else
---
so why must we continue to suffer with Tower?
---
My favourite Operator to play on [REDACTED] is personally [REDACTED]
---
Especially when I'm playing the [REDACTED] game mode
---
Last night I was playing pulse, I held a fucking angle for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Legit an entrance just below our objective, surely SOMEBODY would come along. I broke the barricades a bit, peeked out, nobody ANYWHERE nearby.
---
I turn around after 90 seconds of nothing and Capitao shows up and kills me.
---
Needless to say these guys lost the round on time with two people still alive on both teams, they didn't even make the final rush, they kind of just slowplayed themselves??
---
I thought only for T-hunt
---
I'm obviously talking about N√∏kk
---
‚ÄúLooks like your gadget worked, Wamai!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt get poin-‚Äú
---
‚ÄúWow, look at all this smoke everywhere near the gadget that just did its thing!‚Äù
---
lol it's all good
---
Sir, I don't think you're playing Siege
---
I feel like i can see past the original better tho
---
And the game mode bud
---
I dont think it's only for t hunt
---
You forgot the ‚Äúvote to kick‚Äù pop up sitting in the corner
---
All Outback All The Time.
---
Yes, but they also change the round rotation from ADAD to AADD
---
wow you‚Äôre such a great hero congrats
---
it is a good idea but they have no incentive to do this. If they did then it would be by credits only cus it will not be fair to the people who grinded it out when it was released. Then people on reddit on would whinge and moan about it being paid and no ingame currency. SO good idea but not happening.
---
that‚Äôs a nigga
---
you do realize they just renamed casual, the only point i see is the new round switch thing which i think is incredibly stupid
---
There are only bots in thing. You just have bad players on your team
---
And supposedly the first spare mag reload is faster than a normal reload, right?
---
Doesn't help that Halo just launched and XBL network is getting slammed.
---
What‚Äôs the title and and where can I get it
---
I use 4:3 and 84 fov it kicks in my face like hard tbh instead of changing it holding it further wont be as great as literally changing the sight
---
We need a shitty attacker gadget to give to some ops alongside flash grenades. Too many breach charges, too many claymores. Thoughts?
---
I hit nothing but headshots I will post a higher quality video
---
This happened today, except I got shot and there was no frost and i was vigil, you know what there‚Äôs no real connection except for the map and Amaru
---
I know this is a fan piece, but there are numerous details being missed just from this clip.
---
Hahahahaha someone else's turn
---
The Ember Rise uniforms camouflaged you super well with most maps. If you were on Villa, you were basically invisible.
---
Nice size, you could easily ask $100+ for that or others... once again great job
---
Let's be real any league gold or above and IQ is dead right there
---
Fixed it lol
---
You absolutely hit no headshots AND you had flashing connection icons because you‚Äôre playing on WiFi. This post is just comical, dude
---
Well it's only been in for 1/2 a season, so it's never really had to hold it's own. It's mostly a place people go when they feel they got their rank or are playing poorly (or if their stack is missing). So when everyone is pumped for a new season it's totally dead...
---
Also uPlay has been messed up probably because of all the downloads. Might have to restart uPlay and it may work better.
---
Rented a plane!?... jesus, how much did that cost?
---
They affect everyone because and defender triggered it.
---
fornite bad minecraft good
---
Shut the fuck up and let people enjoy the games they like
---
I'd like to see another map based in a real life location (like Coastline or Dostoyevsky) or counter terrorist operation (like Plane or Oregon)
---
Legend has it year 1 vets can still feel the issues in their bones. 
---
Funny to watch everyone now a days rage at bugs and unintended stuff like a short tempered toddler regardless of the game.
---
It‚Äôs not that big of deal, just leave if you don‚Äôt like the map
---
Why do they even take out the casual exclusive maps? At least take out the ones that are in Ranked and Unranked. If I want to play House and Plane then I go to casual, but now I can't do that. They're nowhere.
---
*Canadian wants to know your location*
---
Wamai gadget detonates the projectile after it catches it,  gridlock, ash, capitao, etc...
---
This is insane. Great work!
---
Drove me up a creek.
---
I think it's good for the meta, each side is more easily punished for being repetitive with strategies when the last round is fresher in your mind
---
Just start handing out these  fidget spinners to kids
---
I wish they would bring Bartlett back. Was my favourite map
---
Yep it‚Äôs maddening.
---
Does anyone know what that fps counter is on the bottom left?
---
Just had to let off a little steam
---
How did you understand the post and then take a step backwards?
---
Yeppp. I remember how bad hit reg used to be, monster sledge, hibana pellets not going off. The game is far more polished.
---
Haven‚Äôt played yet, what‚Äôs wrong with it?
---
yup, that sundown skin looks way better
---
Yes, youre right, but i really wanted to make Warden something of a Vigil kind of thing, a very situational gadget and very good weapons, and since the MPX aint the best weapon, we should give it the ACOG just to increase its effectiviness(dont know if i spelled right).  But if you think giving this power to him would make him OP, we can consider make him a 1speed3armor again.
---
maybe try restarting your router, manually reconnecting your ps4 to it, test your connection, then try launching game, used to work for me but I dont play on ps4 anymore so take that with a grain of salt
---
switching every round was better
---
You can change the maps you play in matchmaking preferences if you want to get rid of Tower and Favela
---
Lol, I figured bonschweetz already made it clear enough that you all were there in her post... guess not.
---
Thanks for info. It just seemed weird because Nomad has the only Projectile in the game that doesn‚Äôt detonate unless an enemy crosses it. I didn‚Äôt know it forcefully detonated the projectiles it caught.
---
My ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù bug was the rubberband grenades. Holllllyyyyyy shit was that beyond awful. Perfect made throw and then all the sudden ‚Äúbuenos d√≠as fuckboi‚Äù -explodes and dies-

This is cool!

---
The entire reason people love black ice is that you cannot buy it (except that one). Make it for sale and it just becomes another expensive skin. But if they made it for newer guns I would be quite happy.
---
Yeah I'll probably get those instead
---
Agreed
---
is this only for Goyo/Amaru? and it's fixed?
---
No
---
Nope it‚Äôs for everyone and it‚Äôs not fixed.
---
A much safer bet would be to give him the p90, it‚Äôs an okay gun and it‚Äôs severely outclassed by the mp5. The mpx with acog would be way to easy to use and would  be very deadly 
---
You probably didn‚Äôt do this because you gave the p90 to nokk but there‚Äôs better weapons for her and I don‚Äôt want an acog on nokk as well.
---
It could be better, but the original one is more realistic... since you are actually aiming
---
You have to manually release the grapple now
---
DO NOT MIND THE RED DOT!
---
Like when it takes an extra 5 seconds before the game loads and people go nuts in chats. And I think...it literally took 30 mins a game during beta. We sat there staring at a black screen for THIRTY MINUTES at a time. That's no exaggeration I remember writing down the times and calculating the average just to make sure I wasn't going mad lol
---
That's r6 for ya toxic af
---
The way Smoke is holding his shotgun makes me feel uncomfortable
---
I can see why that‚Äôs annoying but I guess it helps when you don‚Äôt wanna accidentally go back on a roof or the ground when at a window 
---
Guess I‚Äôll just have to see for myself soon
---
IQ was there too
---
It might be ironic but doesn‚Äôt make it funny.
---
To be honest i think all ops have purposes for different situations but i think the least competitive op is amuru but still a little fun
---
Imo kali makes Oregon hatch obsolete Unless uou are actively mute jamming the hatch
---
It's Blackbeard. All Ubi's bullying made him drink the pain away
---
If you use the AWP a lot in CSGO, or snipers in other games like BF V, Kali. If you play jager a lot, Wamai
---
At least there is a bundle now that have night vision goggles for the GSG9 and a really dark black and grey camp scheme attached to them. Can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called but that‚Äôs the closest thing you‚Äôll get, nothing for Cav though besides what I‚Äôve mentioned.
---
Fact
---
So you became avatar or satan by sacrificing 3 of your team and destroyed enemy team with that power am I right?
---
new penetration system, it's great
---
Operation health is when we're fixing the bugs and repairing the game
---
Google it, it's pretty easy to find. I am not gonna baby feed you when you are not helping with the conversation at all.
---
Take map rotation out of game. Its the stupidest shit in the world
---
Or just give him smoke nades.
---
First i think they make them bigger so that the skins and such are more obvious. 
---
Secondly, I'd also bet new players were more comfortable aiming when given more visibly obvious cues and larger sights.
---
After a couple thousand hours you have the feel baked into your brain so the visual is more fluff than anything and you want as much screen real estate as possible. but for the frequently unpracticed player, the weekend player, this is probably more comfortable.
---
Poor mouse is complaining, too much left finger being used.
---
Doesn't need to be some people get hyped over new animations, see: mozzie
---
Frost for sure , it's only useful in hands of newbie on low ranks
---
That's one of the worst suggestions I've heard in a long time honestly. Don't mess with the one shot headshot mechanic, never. Blackbeard is a mess to balance because of it.
---
Nope your team.
---
Were you frost??
---
Bruh the valk cosplayer said it was like 100 dollars
---
Yup, just give him smokes
---
Never drink while doing a special operation kids.
---
 I think it‚Äôs part of ubi‚Äôs plan to get rid of casual eventually and leave only ranked and unranked. Which personally I‚Äôd like.
---
As i say in every teamkilling complaint post, USE THE LFG. 
---
But youll probably ignore it so oh well
---
So it would be like any other normal pistol
---
And now who is covering the rear?
---
Its almost like why would you need a 12X scope in r6?
---
The clones winning the war after order 66 lol.    
---
Guy here. Notice they are cornered here.   Having a teamkill fight lured the enemy out of position into a killzone
---
That is not rainbow style. Oo cannot only rely on itself. Noone.
---
Yea it is your being a shit and costing other people placement matches
---
Very unfair imo, maybe not in pro league play, but for you average ranked game where things can get toxic, defending first is definitely the upper hand.
---
Imagine attacking first and losing all 3 attack round, going down 0-3 in a solo queue ranked game isn‚Äôt the same as down 0-3 in a pro league setting. 
---
They need to stop trying to make ranked like pro league, they are not the same. At all.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say that. Frost has good guns and is a 2 speed. Warden is much worse.
---
Were them also siege cosplayers?
---
But unranked is also AA-DD?
---
It was good, there was no need to do this change... Now casual is terrible for me, i guess i have to play on unranked now
---
The craziest part about that whole sentence is that no one asked
---
Iq‚Äôs good tho
---
I dont see why theyre trying to force the ranked playstyle on players who just arent interested. Unranked is the way to play and learn the ranked style before playin ranked. Casual should be just casual.
---
Lol its not that bad
---
Sometimes my graphics settings have been reset, maybe yours got reset to ultra
---
I'm pretty sure that Lim shots don't instantly down. Only torso shots
---
The worst part about Amaru is that she's not even that good of a rusher since she's not even 3 speed lol.
---
It still is. All they did was change the rounds
---
Thanks this was very helpful, I deleted the update file and reinstalled. Seems to have worked! Cheers mate!
---
Quick match and unranked are miles apart
---
Use Q and E simultaneously pls.
---
He's the same as before, except now that his high light is constant again, with smoke vision still requiring the charge. So technically, Glaz still is worse than he was a year ago
---
Yes. To more closely resemble the ranked playlist.
---
Or long peek, but when you look away bail, same principal.
---
Its deadass the same game mode
---
Am i the only one who likes it? 
---
If gives you the chance to see the playstile of the enemy and win cause you figured them out, the way it was before you whuld lose 2 timws before wining, now a decent team can win even faster or push back and get a comeback
---
Y'all have got to be my favorite seige cosplays of all time. So perfect!!!
---
One slight change of how the game progresses is not significant and its still miles from unranked or ranked.
---
I don't think you understand, they mildly inconvenienced a GAMER and RETRIBUTION NEEDS TO BE PAID
---
Hello AnnaVergiss, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e5vdvt/isispenta/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
and im sure they werent shooting at the hostage your gadget that you placed caused it to go off course and burn the hostage
---
It's an objectively garbage, unbalanced map, but I still enjoy it usually. Unlike Favela. Fuck Favela.
---
*YOU FLAGGED YOUR TEAMMATE. RUN IT AGAIN.*
---
NO ITS MY TURN STILL
---
How is it a repost if I‚Äôve never seen this post and got it from Safari
---
That's a big F
---
That doesn't really make sense though - you're the one directly responsible for that bolt killing the hostage. You could completely abuse Wamai's gadgets if it put responsibility on the attacker.
---
i fricken hate that. its like "why the fuck are you STILL outside, attack the god damn building"
---
I know that's why I said ironic and not funny
---
JohnTheBaptiist - allow the new seasons Eu stats ü§£
---
I only play her for the memes
---
Amaru BOSG please
---
Doki was banned from ESL events for toxic behaviour and I was banned from his stream.
---
Yeah, as is the point of the gadget?
---
ew emojis
---
I thought casual was fine before atleast the rules anyways. I don‚Äôt really get why they instituted this change. It just feels like half a match. Plus if you want to play offense and you join in progress and get stuck on defense the whole game, that sucks.
---
Full vid here:https://youtu.be/WBdOk8imp9w
---
Isn't that the point of the gadget?
---
isn‚Äôt it expensive to rent planes? lmao
---
Fucking hell want to write anymore? I hate the game because of the retards that play it and dumbfucks like you that think your an intellectual. I'm not wasting anymore of my time on someone who struggles to formulate multiple points other ther than "its your opion" or "ubi know what they are doing". I need to take a long hard look at myself, this is the most pathetic argument in the world we are arguing over a fucking skin in a video game. I dont indulge myself in this shitty waste of time of a video game  Fuck you and go back to your fucking buissness studies you blind pillock.
---
No one knows, and if they do, they will probably be around christmas maybe?
---
Either way I still like using her smg as it can be a great way to land headshots easily
---
Thanks!
---
This is so true. I'm gonna sub your YT channel, hope you make a lot more of these.
---
Gotta love how they gave Wamai one of the best guns in the game
---
Ha. So funny and quirky
---
Literally one step away from ranked but ok. The only thing missing is pick and ban. The maps dont matter to anyone not in pro league.
---
If you can hit the first shot maybe but if you miss then it comes back to kick you in the ass by going left or right without warning and there really isn‚Äôt a way to control horizontal recoil, especially with a controller. I used to like using her Smg but then once Grim Sky came out it‚Äôs been very difficult to control since then. I just hope they consider reworking the scorpion to make it a proper primary at some point in the near future.
---
No joke I'd make a macro for spinning and just spam, i wanna see what happens lmao
---
Sound is your best friend 
---
Learn how sound works in the Game 
---
Also i got bettet from watching siege youtber like Macie Jay or Matimi0
---
Well obviously
---
Probably cuz there may be better stuff in the battle pass, which won‚Äôt sell unless it‚Äôs holding top tier items
---
Ohhh man that makes sense, thank you!
---
This looks amazing
---
2-2 atk Def rotation just hurts
---
So, a fuze then
---
Did you try to verify the files manually?
---
Steam&gt;library&gt;right click the game&gt;properties&gt;files integrity
---
What is the problem?
---
I played over 150 games this season and I can tell you it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I placed in mid gold, played like 10 games, solo queue, didn‚Äôt get anywhere.
---
I kept solo queuing for a bit, ranked down all the way to copper, then played with a 5 man team and ranked up to very high gold again... just don‚Äôt solo queue...
---
Smg is good lel
---
I‚Äôve done that, the horizontal will still mess with it regardless. Look I can see you are trying help, so I‚Äôll just leave it at this excuse arguing about the scorpion recoil isn‚Äôt what this post was intended to be; to others and my own eyes she is probably one of the least effective ops in the game when she is using the scorpion. Yes her traps are decent but outside that if you are looking to be an effective roamer with her she needs to use the shotgun, because otherwise your own gun will get you killed. You would be better off picking ops like Lesion, or other roamers that are way more effective like Vigil and such. It shouldn‚Äôt be that way. That is all.
---
I don't think any of us are karma farming, I'm just posting because it's my picture and my account. We just all happened to be at the same setting and share the pics with yall because we think it's cool. Is that such a bad thing? How many r6 cosplayers have actually been to a plane? I'm p sure it's a first for many.
---
I wish it was like this for all pistols
---
Ill stick to the best roamer ever, clash XD
---
That Thatcher(?) is a bot
---
As a solo queuer, I must say, only time Jackal is a problem is when him and at least one other attacker are pushing you.
---
Jackal is easy to deal with, especially if you know where you have been. If Jackal is alone, you know the only direction you need to worry about. I personally only vote Jackal or Blitz because I know it is pointless to try to get Thatcher or Cap banned. Same with Cav and Echo.
---
I prefer Dokkaebi and Mute tbh
---
Vigil and yeah, I know
---
yeah 9 times out of ten, hes either stuck at a door leading outside of above a hatch
---
userflair: Mute chibi

Next time just jump out of the window and flip upside down
---
Some might
---
Just try it, instead of asking online?
---
Yeah
---
Isn¬¥t the intention of teamkilling, to make someones day worse?
---
Sooo fucking true
---
I am sorry, but you think Ubi are listening? Every user here said that uncontrollable Scorpion is a joke, not a ‚Äúbalancing solution‚Äù. And, for what, 1,5 years since Chimera nerf. They do not care about your suggestions. They measure the operator‚Äôs metrics by metrics. So Ela will be buffed only in case if her pickrate/winrate goes down(even more, yes, than it currently is).
---
And all of this happened because Ela on release was not the operator‚Äôs design problem, but rather an incompetence of balancing team making her THAT much strong. And they even couldn‚Äôt nerf her properly, for god sake...
---
You know, there always will be some idiots, but minding them every time...
---
very sure
---
Do you have a blank version, would like to try this
---
Agreed lol that shot hopefully got rid of some rust
---
Hell I just want someone to pick Kali and use the gadget to get through the wall. She kept being picked yesterday on consulate and I was thermite standing by the garage door watching as she entered the other side of the map.
---
Anyone with an angle grip.
---
nah favela is good
---
I leg shot Mozzie and didn‚Äôt insta-down him earlier. It did about 90 damage, though. Pretty sure you have to hit the torso.
---
Clapped by ubi
---
Same, thought it would come with the update
---
Just make it a map called "Movie Studio" and have the rooms be different film sets (obviously also turn the studio into an actual one with camera and lighting equipment)
---
The voice actors were too costly to hire for new voicelines as they will make more content like "The hammer and the scalpel", but dunno the make millions in revenue
---
Any regrets?
---
I can win 1v1 with doc any day of the week
---
Pc
---
Ehh the CZ isn't a very unbalanced gun. Not as crazy as the smg12 and no recoil improving attachments it's just a good sidearm. If it reloaded slightly faster once I don't think that'd break anything but I love all the reload animations even if Mozzie's a little hype beast
---
for Mozzie mains . Yes they are very respected
---
Really? For some reason I enjoy the simplicity of it. 
---
Haven't even played the actual season itself yet lol, just saw that splash screen and menu after the update came in. Looks dope
---
Yes. Hate facing one. Love having one
---
it used to be for multiplayer too. we would turn off some maps for ranked and casual. we could turn off game mode too for multiplayer but Ubi removed it to make the matchmaking faster and better and to make the game more balanced.
---
I was so happy when I started playing Borderlands 3 on console and immediately upped my FOV to 110 it was wonderful
---
Sure... but can you outplay Kali with defender (with out acog dudes) at long range. No?
---
Oh nice! Yeah Velvet shell was good. I'd rank it up near the good ones. Probably my third choice, behind skull rain.
---
What did you do
---
Honestly, No i don't. the game is great with friends and when you get that really good party. hours just fly. IMO
---
2 things: 
---
1. How the hell did Kali find you
---
2. If I was their teammate, after the third failed plant, I am putting a bullet between their eyes
---
I'm fairly new to Siege and I have to say I only play with friends. No interest in soloing it at the moment. Still haven't decided on a main though!
---
I dont really care about being called fat. 
---
 Personally, I just despise all the aggresivity surrounding the game. I'm there to play to meet nice person eventually but mostly to have fun. Seeing racism homophobia or any kind of insult is not really my idea of fun  even if they are not affecting me. Not to mention screaming kids and else.
---
Let s pretend you are just walking in the street and you have people all around you insulting each other. This would be weird and ruin your walk. I dont see how it is any different
---
April fools event?
---
Ai man if ever you wanna play, mess around. i like to recruit lots or meme. i play to have fun. you can dm me ill add you.
---
There is a mute button and the trolls only want to make you angry.
---
in Closed Beta it took a lot of time to find a match and the matchmaking was horrible. but 60min wait for a match? I've never experienced this kind of time and I played on PS4 from Closed Beta and it's only been a year since I changed my platform to PC. the max time it takes to find a match (even when I'm solo) is 5 minutes.
---
Wtf? Look like Blood Orchid
---
not only for the CZ, but rather for every pistol in the game pls
---
I literally just post about this lol
---
Best rework ever
---
Oh 
---
Is the community toxic ? More than Siege's? Considering that is f2p?
---
The change of name makes literally no difference to the game and the 2 round rotation makes practically no difference.
---
There is a bug after spining it shiw u got an alpha pack but at main menu the chanes is reset and u get nothing
---
Good luck getting this sub to understand that. 12 hours and I haven't been successful despite providing data.
---
*Facepalms real hard*
---
Shitty
---
People just hate change.
---
Just press "vault" while reppeling up?
---
A lot of people wanted this, but yeah not having the option blows.
---
&gt;horrible IMO 
---
Oh my heavenly Lord what have they done! They have committed the sin of making us play the same round twice instead of one round later! Spent almost 100 dollars for this! Betrayal! Man f**k this game I'm heading back to Minecraft!
---
*Facepalm*
---
&gt;I don't get why ubi suddenly added some new mechanic to the game when literally nobody requested this feature. 
---
One of the most requested features and a really fucking useful one.
---
&gt;Why isn't there an option in settings to return this new control back to the old method, the same way you get to choose gadget and drone deployment modes?
---
I was under the impression there is.
---
&gt;I never asked for this feature, but more so this is actually a negative.
---
To you perhaps.
---
The word is "peek"
---
It‚Äôs been a day, what if your ears are just dirty
---
Mad cuz bad
---
We could start arguing semantics over the two, how the CZ has 6 more bullets, and slightly faster reload, and how the SMG has access to an angled grip, but on an experiential level, SMG has good sights, CZ has good recoil.
---
People didn't ask for it but that doesnt mean people didn't want it. It was an inconvenience, and ubi fixed that. Though i do agree that ubi should add an option to turn it off, like all new features.
---
Melee is preferable to aiming on console.
---
You have data? I'd like to see it if you don't mind.
---
Change? Homie this isn't even a "change"! This is just........idk what even to call it! It's too insignificant to even be called a change for somebody who's played this game long enough to know how the game works!
---
Gosh, complaint boxes these guys are!
---
He did, right before the clip begins
---
Think your hearing is going, sorry pal
---
You're right people enjoy complaining.
---
Yeah this is totally retarded.
---
I prefer the old system. The whole argument that it's to help people not accidentally get on the roof is stupid. Only noobs can't control it properly.
---
Part of my game play in some maps involve me getting onto the roof ASAP to avoid peakers. This is slowing me down with an additional prompt. 
---
And who ever asked for this anyway? They just add and change shit nobody asked for.
---
Ive been a player since launch. This change wasnt necessary. No one asked for this. Sure we'll have to adapt. But im just asking... *WHY?*
---
I actually wouldn't mind typing the whole thing again but I'm kinda burnt our from all the typing.
---
It is in my comment history if you don't mind looking, else I'll just pull it out once I get back home from work.

Would you be able tell us how the tests went? Or any statistical information?

I understand the frustration of the community (my own included). If there was some sort of "limited time" indication, we would have played alot more rather than wait for the season start (and find out it is discontinued)
---
Omg this is so great!

Oh ho! Then come close as you like!

Literally playing unranked is less toxic than casual

This all seriously just comes off as karma farming. Could‚Äôve just taken one picture of say, all the people that attended and made one post?

Nah, better to get everyone on their accounts flooding the sub with pictures, guess it got you gold huh? Mission successful. And replying to every single comment for the comment upvotes is the icing on the cake, why do you even bother replying or give half a shit what these people think
---
Who's conrad?
---
Good to know I'm not thw only one who doesnt know
---
but he is right. Ubisoft has to balance the ops for the casuals because they are the biggest group of people who play the game. yes if some ops are rly broken in the pl they will have to nerfe them but first and foremost they'll have to balance the ops for the normal players.
---
Most pros use 400dpi and medium sensitivity in case you were wondering.
---
I really wonder if this genuinely has any theory behind it because it seems so true
---
Lifeline.
---
This is wyh I love Reddti.
---
Never happened to me on PC EU. Presumably your on the the super toxic console?
---
The aa dd format is daft, we have unranked or ranked for back to back roles, casual is for chill and testing shit
---
i like this.

They ruined casual. The end.

For the cut-scenes they are adding for the battlepass, the previous voice actors were expensive and it was easier for more lines

r/siegeacademy is your friend. Lots of tips, and even some coaches like u/kaosx who really know what they're talking about.

---
Yes burst fire does make it better. But then what's the point of having the damn thing have the fire rate in the first place. About her gadget its because usually you find yourself away from the mines. And being able to pin point which one goes off lets you take more advantage of them. Not that they're bad but they can just be improved
---
Your flair says otherwise.

Did not know what tag to use, so fluff it is.

You beat me to it - years of academy training wasted!

The revolver is light destruction.
---
I love the new ops too, Kali isn't OP like most new attackers and Wamai is a really good alternative to jager. BUT I hate theme park so far, the random walls around the map that give complete map rotation ruin the flow of the map in my opinion. But the ops are ebic
---
Wamai. Kali pretty useless tbh. Fun tho
---
kali is fun but wamai is more practical, your choice
---
That hurt my soul
---
Joystick?

Just started playing her recently so much fun

just use the pmm is fantastic but yeah

A blue weapon skin would fit really nice with that uniform

No. We discussed that on discord.

Oh cool, thinking of getting Finka myself as my next attack op (either her or Gridlock). Would you recommend her?

Astro A50s it seems

You're arguement is pretty invalid.

Lol.
---
Why?
---
It's just my personal preference, though if it helps the old one is better in most regards.

Thank you!

I‚Äôll use it occasionally

Yeah, I know. People are so dumb in this game...
---
A teamkill also count as kill in my book tho
---
Sort of.
---
Nah; Executive Producer, they usually complain the most.
---
Aim, please leave him alone, the chainsaw he uses rn is so loud you can hear it from across the map, i don't even remember the last time i died to a mav,the(excuse me but its true) lvl 20 noobs started bashing him and they nerfed him to hell, and now they even want a counter, can you guys not leave anyone who requires skill to use and counter alone?
---
Cool. Then 5 stack. Or be able to ace every round. My point is that rank doesnt actually matter. And dont say "I dont have anyone to 5 stack with" because everyone here knows there are places to find a squad.
---
Why u guys thinking about is in a tactical standpoint just bum rush with m870 it‚Äôs that easy
---
Also add favela to that
---
I Wish they did a map in the setting of shifting tides. Like on an oil drilling rig in the ocean. Could be pretty dope.
---
I guess they think it whuld be cool to change?
---
It's heavy BF3 vibes
---
Nah, I just don't like having content locked behind a time limit and a paywall.
---
Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you should. If you're very inexperienced, you should practice more.
---
use the map resourse outside the game: [https://maps.r6guides.com/#themepark/1/all](https://maps.r6guides.com/#themepark/1/all)
---
I honestly have no idea why they are doing this, maybe a hint we will get to customize it later on?
---
1) Update drivers  
---
2) Check game files
---
You should play whatever mode ou want to play.
---
Yeah since Villa launch
---
Perfect, since you‚Äôre replying to all the complaints, message me when your ready to work on it!
---
*sweats nervously*
---
Same shit happening to me
---
Good thought but no I simply wanted to see if my bullet would hit the wall in the middle of the device or if the hitbox counted for the empty space in the middle
---
I'm pretty sure they nerfed shotguns because console players said they were too op. but now on PC, the already almost underpowered shotguns (with a few exceptions like BOSG) have gotten a nerf as well.
---
W I D E
---
I thought it would be vigile the wiggle
---
The sight is similar to the one on the Polish RG-15 and the Bailiff.
---
I always get disappointed when I see commons, then they are sometimes Blood orchids and I am relieved. Blood Orchid Chanka uni :D
---
This is a felony
---
My lord
---
It wouldn't be quiet regardless of when the barricade breaks. The grappling hook noise and zip line noise is louder than fuck.
---
I dont know if Mira's voice actress is cheap/bad or the VA director is bad, but she is meant to represent a spanish speaking character, but either doesn't know or even try to sound spanish, just some "generic" foreign accent.
---
Soon tacticool dudes wi try an nail me to cross using a tactical hammer with tactical nails.
---
Finding a group in a community or whatever is useless in this game (at least on PS4). Because whenever its loaded with arrogant cocky players who are just "magically" on their "off game" and play like shit.
---
Nobody should ever HAVE to ace every round.
---
Who's the op?
---
Somebody had a bad game...
---
Never seen it and that's dope.
---
Yea, i like to think its balilffs and they messed something up but i don't think they whuld do that, i think they ment for us to see this, maybe in the close future we get it, and i hope we do.
---
What Stone Age monitor are you playing on? /s
---
Honestly you sound like a feminist.
---
Wait... No... 
---
LUISONACOG
---
i'll take my blitz icon so u can have the kali
---
That makes sense
---
If you look closely you can see two lesion traps on the welcome mat.
---
Bad
---
Yeah, I'm sick of my teammates playing music and not paying attention in ranked.
---
Happened to me once in the prep phase
---
Yeah.
---
Lol I think someone needed to complain in your case, that gun positioning, holstering and movement is terrible. Not like you‚Äôre trying to imitate a *realistic tactical* shooter or anything...
---
Haven't heard it yet.
---
Hate the game, not the player
---
This is what u/i_wana_fuck_twitch plays on his VR headset.
---
1 skin costs 9k-10k and you bought 4 which totals to 36-40k in which you could have bought the whole bundle.
---
The hat and her face aren't aligned, but otherwise it's great! Also, I would practice drawing guns so you can add more details like her red dot on the pistol.
---
Its either to weak or to op, theres no real middleground
---
Just walk up on stage at the next lan and ask 4head.
---
Wamai kinda thicc
---
I dont have a problem or anything. Just answering what some one asked is all. Only reason I even noticed personally was the plane rental comment when I used to load 747's along with other planes when I was in the Military during the 911 conflict and knew that something was off there lol. 
---
I personally dont care. Didnt that intentional. Someone just asked what was up with the pictures.
---
Idk man it worked for me
---
Mira just sounds off.
---
Fair enough
---
Happened to me at House the other day. Couldn‚Äôt find him...
---
I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt take that as a negative thing, as a lot of women think it‚Äôs a bad thing to be called ‚Äúhot‚Äù.
---
‚Ç©‚Ç≥‚Ç•‚Ç≥≈Ç
---
join the discord, soloQ is death sentence for mmr
---
you‚Äôre are brain dead
---
What exactly are you asking? The goyo deployed his fire shield on the other side of your wall. By reinforcing the wall you set it off and he and his mate stood in hit. Double TK = ban
---
That teammate is just a dick
---
Where can I get one?
---
Yeah I started then as well but after 280+ hours I got tired of blasting guys in the head with glad an them not dying
---
Oof
---
Same for me, I‚Äôve had maybe 2 moments like this but they are incredibly rare.
---
I do it all the time lol
---
Stop it. Just stop.
---
I love his tiny feet
---
I like this alot
---
I just noticed that
---
Just as usual?
---
They did took out Theme Park the season before it got reworked, if we're lucky the same is happening to Skyscraper
---
Someone thought it was so dirty that they voted to kick you smh
---
MMMMMMAAAAATTTTTE  GET  BEEEEEAAANED 
---
u love to see it
---
Winnable, I won one of those in op wind bastion
---
I'm fine. If you really care about the realism and details of a project that's aimed to provide a fun oppertunitiy for people that wouldn't really get this oppertunitiy with the budget they collectively had then the best way to constructively improve our chances of getting better in this category is financial support. 
---
You're welcome to say what you like about production value; but that's just the facts. That's how things improve with detail ridden pieces. It's not being snarky; it's a legitimate problem solver into the logistic of set design. Pay for it.
---
Yeah, so what do you think would be a good gadget?
---
Gay
---
Siege updates are always a little weird.  Give Ubi time to figure it out.
---
Yeah, I'm expecting to be a complete noob until I get a clue of the new stuff and changes.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
If that add color the way they did to kanal and some slight rework, it could be one of the better maps.
---
https://youtu.be/qSZpgtnXm18
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
Leder still looks good tho
---
Will this be fixed later?Im really having alot of fun in this game!
---
I've only been here for eight seasons but god damn it feels so long
---
The cardassian emblem is many different colors throughout Star Trek, the icons just reminded me of Cardassia. I‚Äôm not complaining about it...
---
I got it yesterday as well
---
"fixing"
---
Yea they'll patch it soon, they usually do.
---
&gt;Yes, but I'm trying to achieve a high rank.
---
Then get better.
---
Seriously, i'm not trying to sound like a jerk but if you cannot carry then you are already at your highest rankl. The only way you are going to get a higher one is to get better.
---
Congrats! üéâüëèüèº
---
Maybe ubi realized sledges Hand position was shitty
---
Master chief collection pc no new halo
---
Why they even made it AADD when we already have unranked where you can play AADD
---
His ability is far from useless tho
---
It's def his, check his profile, he clearly has a talent with this and I saw the original images really far into his profile.
---
I mean, that magic bullet thing is prevalent in a lot of fps' , whaddya gonna do?
---
a new season came out so it has to update
---
See if these numbers improve the visuals. But leave in-game brightness, gamma and HDR to default to let the tv do the work. It will be set for gaming and non-gaming.
---
If you use game mode, set it to the same numbers if possible.
---
Picture Mode: Expert1
---
Contrast (Picture): 100
---
Brightness: 50
---
Gamma: 2.2
---
Color: 61
---
Tint: R12
---
Sharpness: H: 5, V: 5
---
Color Temperature: Warm2
---
Backlight: 67
---
Aspect Ratio: Just Scan
---
Other adjustments: Color Gamut: Standard
---
Black Level: Low (must set X1 to Standard, Ps4 on RGB Limited)
---
Real Cinema: On
---
All other settings should be set to "off" or zero "0". 
---
Any individual R,G, or B color subcontrols, if present, should remain at their default settings.
---
It's the same rounds but in a different order. 
---
If you won each round you'd play 2x Attack and 1x Defense or vice versa 
---
If you went 3 - 1 you'd play 2x Attack and 2x Defense
---
So on and so forth
---
No, he basically upgraded the graphics since making it look this nice takes more than the game files.
---
Ikr
---
K
---
Switzerland for Y5S1 ?
---
Wamai elite outfit
---
We love when OP doesn‚Äôt even credit
---
The order matters, almost everyone I know plays casual for fun and ranked to win and going ADAD keeps things fresher
---
That‚Äôs what she said;)
---
Boomer?
---
I mean they gave him frags now and Warden is still not up to snuff. We'll see the next PL how it plays out.
---
I honestly don't know why I got so many matches on theme park today and yesterday, maybe ubi is just trying to push these maps or its just chance but it gets really boring
---
Wouldn‚Äôt you be the boomer preferring an older format?
---
It a low rank. No skill set of 5 is letting a Doc run his bulky ass out and knife two 3 speeds. That Ash might as well sell the disc back to Gamestop.
---
I guess you just answered your own question lol
---
Sneak peak into new operator called glitch.
---
I don't get it
---
U good?
---
\*knife intensifies\*
---
It always does. But this clip especially
---
ACTUAL KOBE
---
People would only say it becomes more and more like rank. I kind of like the random side, you play obj that you don‚Äôt often play. 
---
Where it sucks is when the whole game is the same obj over and over again.
---
Man‚Äôs got a boner for drones.
---
It‚Äôs still a really unbalanced, badly designed map too. Especially of you‚Äôre down a teammate, defense will easily win on the majority of the sites.
---
Oh, nice. This is like the third time in a few days that this has happened. Weird coincidence
---
I know
---
The last thing see before the world goes dark.....
---
Idk what I just missed
---
*insert console player diss* üôÑ
---
As well I. Nice art!
---
So long, and thanks for all the fish
---
I love this. Its amazing and making indestructible is just even more amazing.
---
He looks like the dude from crackdown
---
Lol I did souly main echo at one time. Now its him maestro and Goyo cause I also have a bone for the deployable shield
---
&gt;Well she should hit edd first and it would destroy the frost mat
---
IIRC the EDD is high enough on a window that the frost mat may might take damage, but won‚Äôt destroy it. If the mat isn‚Äôt fully destroyed off the edd, it still kills amaru due to her firing delay.
---
He stops drones from seeing him but even then he doesn't do it that well or long
---
Khali is Great.
---
He was.... Nevermind
---
Not Outbreak, but Chimera set.
---
Unranked is AAADDD
---
Yeah I know.
---
no it's because you said k, like ok boomer
---
Ash gadget, Zofia, Capitao, Maybe kali wall burrowy thingy
---
It reminds me of the Black ops 2 lobby music
---
The Mac Daddy is an amazing legendary
---
Eh, close enough
---
I NEEEED ITTT
---
Not sure my dude
---
Zo
---
Sounds about right.
---
PL sub's iq is dropping as well lately
---
Things were great back in Skull Rain and Velvet Shell
---
There are plenty of good legendaries
---
Ok thanks brother!I bought digital deluxe edition on sale,i like Caveira and Hibana(attack and defence)which operators should i look to unlocking/using soon?
---
No.
---
Being my favourite gun, I wouldn't want it to be Op.
---
Through a windowoooooooooow, \*\*\*THROUGH A WALL\*\*\*
---
I think its a new legendary for Y5S1 but i dont know
---
Buy year1 ops with renown (they are really cheap) get the year2 bundle (that‚Äôs worth it)
---
Acog wouldn‚Äôt make it op since it‚Äôs recoil would balance it
---
He looks tired or something, but still well done.
---
How did you get it?
---
Through a windooooooooooow, ***THROUGH A WALL!***
---
It‚Äôs because of the lack of buttons, nothing more
---
Play unranked then.
---
can't edit title :(
---
thanks a lot!
---
this is the way
---
It blows up the goyo shield
---
Good
---
i only got the fucking smoke uniform and some rare charms. i paid for 2. i'm really pissed off because of it. this is why lootboxes are the worst. i spent 25 000 renown on that shit and i got 2 fucking charms and a meh uniform
---
 #MakeCasualCasualAgian.
---
Ngl I wish this was a seasonal skin....
---
it's a masterpiece!
---
Are you sure that‚Äôs not a problem with your own internet ? Like I highly doubt every Asian Siege player has the same disconnect issues as you
---
I motion to make Rainbow Six Siege the US National sport. All in favor?
---
do it really matter doe
---
Since yesterday you can assume there will be a vigil peeking or running out with BOSGACOG
---
To be honest, the actual uniform looks better.
---
It‚Äôs just casual
---
Aug A2 - Flash Hider, Reflex (Pick), MP5K - Comp, Holo. P12 (Pick). Use good shield spots otherwise just pick barbwire for him.
---
Ember rise
---
It‚Äôs normal for your controller stick to drift, you just have to raise your deadzone till it stops drifting. Don‚Äôt go higher than 10%, you would start noticing disadvantages and only raise the deadzone of the stick that‚Äôs drifting. But usually new controllers never have this problem unless you dropped it or something.
---
What would you think if Ubisoft kept him as a 2 speed but gave him the p90 without Acog ?
---
Why is castle so lonely?
---
They way he is now is just a shitty Valk or Smoke. Warden needs something to make him stand out.
---
Aug and Keratos and on Kali the c75 auto
---
Well I mean Charms weren't a thing until Dust Line, but it would be cool if they did what other game developers do. Like BF gives original players custom dog tags that you can only get from playing old games or their closed/open alpha/betas. Even Bungie did this when they still owned Halo
---
RIP, how did they even find you? IQ?
---
I see a lot of people from my region complaining about the issue on the steam forums and even here on reddit? If it is just an issue with my own internet connection, then how come a lot of people are experiencing it as well? Lemme guess, it's their connection's fault too. 
---
Just stop.
---
Jesus you are already ranked ?
---
It's just cool nostalgia.
---
Rook or Montagne?
---
he sacrificed hair and sight for teleportation  
---
wise man
---
Quick match = casual
---
This is the way
---
Her guns are the most underwhelming things on attack ever. At least the G8 has an angled grip now so it's generally what I use. This is despite the fact that I have black ice for AUG since it and the commando are just an awful experience all around.
---
What country do you live in just out of curiosity ?
---
Started on black ice, played 5 seasons after that then took a break till ember rise came out...I still rock my velvet shell plat charm :)
---
Lol no.
---
Games fun, but it's a fucking mess.
---
I remember playing all of these
---
Im pretty uncultured is that Russian or German? I was never able to really tell the difference (I speak English french and some Arabic)
---
I like to play casual too, so no prob. Usually ~Plat 2
---
It would defeat the purpose of giving him the P90. It‚Äôs both to give him an acog and because it‚Äôd be a commonly used gun. That‚Äôs why I chose it over the other ACOG‚Äôd SMG‚Äôs.
---
Cos if you win that means the other team has probably tked the hacker or let you win so you shouldn't get elo and they shouldn't lose it.
---
God **DAMN**
---
He just stole castle's helmet
---
Oh for sure. IMO I wouldn't want to trade away weapons performance for a slightly better ability, and I'd be willing to bet most of the community feels the same
---
I honestly think that the last time I got a legendary it was 3 years ago
---
And it was a fucking sausage legendary skin...
---
Is that a rail on the handle?!
---
\*maniacally laughing grenade incoming\*
---
I took one glance at this comment and thought the same thing... lmao
---
Damn.
---
Well shot guys I didn't know it was from a previous season. Should I delete the post? Just lemme know
---
How I feel when I get queued against Diamonds haha
---
 #MakeCasualCasualAgain
---
Kinda silly that they keep tweaking Casual to be more like Ranked when there is already an Unranked playlist, and the Newcomer playlist is just a watered down version of Unranked.
---
I don't want to have to set up a custom game just to play my favorite map, House.
---
Kaid can electrify 3 reinforcements at once with a claw tho
---
I honestly hate charms at this point. They should just leave them out of paid packs. You buy a few because you want the cool uniform or headgear and since they put 3 times as many charms in there at a higher drop chance you're extremely unlikely to get a skin
---
Soon^tm
---
Why? So you can find another thing to blame the issue on?
---
I have never got a legendary skin :(
---
N√∏kk just needs a better smg, like the mp7.
---
When the camera lights were red. Barely remembered it was that colour.
---
A Swiss army knife? Is my country gonna get an operator next year?!
---
You need to download them
---
You can remap buttons, such as switching the l2 and r1 buttons or even switching circle with l1 and then l1 with r2 and then putting r2 in circles spot, but you cant break away combined actions.
---
I‚Äôve gotten this 3 times on 1 account I love the skin hate that it isn‚Äôt for the Automatic.
---
Is it only upper body because I shot doc in the stomach
---
May I ask why?
---
Good luck with your research!
---
Possibly.
---
Sorry man. Everything you said is a straight up lie and can't be backed by anything. No ill will.
---
The only "uncommon" symbols Germans use are certain letters with dots above them (√Ñ, √ñ, √ú). These basically just indicate that you pronounce them differently. For example the √Ñ or √§ is almost pronounced like a German e but still a bit differently. It's mainly because words using these letters are derived from words using the normal letter counterparts. Jagd (=hunt) and J√§ger (=hunter) would be an example. Then there's the letter √ü which, again, indicates a different pronunciation of the letter s.
---
For the Russians, they use an entirely own (and unique to them, I believe) set of letters with a few exceptions like a and e.
---
The more you know!
---
Isn‚Äôt it supposed to be a one shot down though?
---
It's obviously reverse-able. Fashion and function.
---
Damn bro, feels bad
---
Wow, it's an actual good legendary
---
Dude, we literally live in different ends of the country and some of us in different ones, we don‚Äôt have the budget or the time to all get together to train as if it were a real life scenario. No amount of dwindling ad sense could support that. Believe me I‚Äôd love if everyone was as on point as their Cosplays but for now until we find a wealthy millionaire who want to train Cosplayers on room clearing this will have to do.
---
So did I. I think you just need to learn how to play attack better, no offense. You probably have strengths that I don't, but I am a better than average attack player at a G1-P3 level.
---
I've had an even weirder glitch with it where my character somehow door l fit three rounds into it, I was able to fire all of them as well
---
This could change the game, if people learn how to do this they could place alibi on barriers to track their spot. That is if the player hasn‚Äôt broken it yet.
---
One grenade ends it all
---
Lucky
---
Done, gl

Hello Orion_Flame, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e65jhq/is_this_a_bug_or_a_featureis_it_just_me_that_sees/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I DON'T MIND
---
Nice! As a Mute main, I never managed to get my hands on the 'Safety Yellow' legendary skin... So this is a nice opportunity! I was lucky enough to get the Conduit one for the SMG-11 tho back in those days. Still hoping for that one day where Ubisoft would rerelease those old legendary skins...
---
Personally I really can‚Äôt vibe with the MK14 so I‚Äôm going to keep using everyone‚Äôs favourite bubble darrel if you don‚Äôt mind.
---
I‚Äôm embarrassed I don‚Äôt remember especially considering I managed to hit platinum in Y1S1.....
---
Good legendary wth
---
He tried and died instantly
---
wamai time
---
I havent noticed anything. BUCKMAIN4LIFE
---
Hey look its my rank way over to the left over th...nvm its off screen
---
Its alright.
---
It's only useful for gold and up players. They should have a way to turn it off for anyone who wants it off.
---
Peek long, save awp
---
Very nice.
---
Another great legendary skin that I will never get...
---
Be honest you're just asking for the acog event that someone showed on here weeks ago
---
It was leaked by some TTS picture that the G36C will be recycled and I forgot the rest. It has a Y5S1 tag too so it's going to be next season.
---
I play him for his PDW9. It's a lovely gun, perfect mix and I hope he doesn't get banned as much so I can use him in ranked once more.
---
vio_lens_film on pretty much everything üé¨
---
Wow
---
Imo they should do at least one of these things:
---
- Give 1 AP per win and remove the shitty roll system.
---
- Make them cheaper to buy with renown.
---
- Remove legendary duplicates and put all of the existing legendaries in rotation.
---
- Give more renown to duplicate stuff, let it be the actual price of the thing or 50% (You can get a 20.000 uniform and they don't even give you the 25% value :\)
---
Of course the most interesting thing are the legendaries, it's very oof that very few people manage to get some of them before they are ruled out of rotation.
---
I don't understand the point in removing them when you can't buy AP with real money (yes, I'm aware of the renown booster discusion but with how costly are AP meh)
---
"We're delaying it for next year so we don't have to give it for free for the people who bought the Y4 season pass"
---
The banana charm is also awesome
---
The game all PC players love, since all the annoying losers with keyboard converters ruin it for everyone on console.
---
I was not aware of someone else already asking about it lol I just thought about it while playing around with the c75 thinking to myself how ludacris it would be if it had an acog lol
---
Gotcha fam
---
Yes they did
---
Its only a one hit to the body/waist not to limbs
---
IQ Skin or Commando Skin?
---
Thank God I would literally guard that with my life cause people would destroy it and its literally pretty much a tombstone for us r6 gamers.
---
Its becuse new hit registration system now when you shot hands and legs its damage you might watch some youtube videos about it
---
I actually like the bird of prey one, I'm a bird owner and I think they were going for the texture of a birds feet/legs if it makes it make any more sense to you than before
---
They should just revamp the tags so there can be a tag for "artwork" "cosplay" "op concept"... So people can mute those tags they aren't interested in watching.
---
Thanks m8
---
So... "I know you are but what am I?"
---
Definitely 4chan mouthbreather characteristics. You aren't helping your case, man.
---
I'd start maining iq with a sexy skin like that
---
Ridiculous idea if you are with a squad of 4 you can kick all of them and they have no say
---
They‚Äôre nearly the same (only difference is that one has safety switch only on one side and second on both). They were even made with same machines. Your mistake is justified
---
Little bit of a long story I have been away from Siege for a long time I just played for the first time today since Operation Para Bellum I enjoy playing it with my close friends but they stopped and then picked it up again. I wasn't very good at Siege to begin with, but I actually didn't do too bad today. I clutched a round and I think I found a new main on defense Lesion and was close to being mvp a few times. I'm glad to be back so much stuff has changed.
---
i mean you‚Äôve got to give them an A for effort
---
Nah Erik gone bruh
---
I‚Äôm going to give the map some time to get to know it from a gameplay perspective, but my first impression is that they made too many rooms too similar, both in color and aesthetic design, leading to confusion and making it more difficult to do easy call-outs.
---
You can kick one of them
---
Casual, Ranked and PL used to be like you're playing three different games and it's absolutely amazing that Ubisoft are working to make them as alike one another as possible. Imagine playing Casual, then jumping into Ranked with different rules and maps, then watching PL for the first time thinking you'll know what's going on but you don't because it's different again. Consistency is great for the new player experience and just because you've played this way all this time doesn't mean that every change is bad.
---
Christ almighty I remember the good ol days.
---
Remember fellas back in our day sledge had an acog on his smg.
---
The deagle skins are good.
---
hex...adic.
---
nice.
---
Ok, that makes a little more sense. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Oof!
---
Wow wow. I never said everyone needed to train. My friend works in film. If he called me up and said he wanted me to be in a frozen fan fic tomorrow, I‚Äôd do atleast the minimal research required. Unless the guy pulled you all from a con to put this on same day, it takes literally 10 minutes to watch a quick run down on the basics. I‚Äôm sure you had to shoot these scenes a few times, and in between those shoots you probably had a few minutes to practice. Saying you didn‚Äôt have time to ‚Äútrain‚Äù or practice is just a cop out. 
---
Even just having a single person who did their research would make it much easier as they could point out that Valk should stick to the outside of the room when clearing. She may not understand why (to avoid the kill one), but that simple pathing would add. Small things like that add up. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve spend an hour on worse things than watching special forces walking around a shoot house. 
---
What bothers me is this push back within the vein of ‚Äúwe couldn‚Äôt‚Äù- you could. You just didn‚Äôt want to put the effort in. You don‚Äôt have to make excuses about budget as budget has nothing to do with it. You don‚Äôt need a military advisor on set, just a smartphone and 20 minutes.
---
That's still stupid being able to kick them for no reason
---
I don't know which one I like more; the Banana, Doge or this
---
Damn dude
---
such a nice story, thanks, this will work as my bedtime story as its almost 11pm for me

No joke Glaz is nothing to sleep on this season. Sure you have to sit still if you want to look through smoke still BUT, all the other buffs make him worth picking again. I say if you want a fast sniper then you pick Glaz, but if you want a sniper that has more utility and can hold long angles with ease, then you pick Kali.
---
If you can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem, join em.
---
Yea, they add a new attachment every season.
---
I mean that‚Äôs literally only .1% of the community. Os it really outrageous to want things the entire rest of the community will enjoy? Besides it‚Äôs guaranteed the majority of champion rank achievers will be cheaters or mouse and key board users on console.
---
I have them too, but if you surf the Siege reddit you'll see like year 2 players that have it that have never played the Beta or even preordered the game (obviously).
---
Hope ok I‚Äôm going to use this as my phone wallpaper because it‚Äôs awesome!
---
But it is different thats why I'm complaining.
---
Yea I just wasn‚Äôt sure if the years ops were gonna be good
---
Exactly
---
That's not the issue nor does it solve the problem!
---
So no new content, more bugs and worse servers? Sign me up
---
Does that mean we can expect lean and crouch spam.
---
Oh no, it‚Äôs not offensive! I actually really liked it and I learned a lot about Vigil. It just blew my mind while I was reading it üòÇ
---
Well there was jokes of it.
---
Not bad, Ubi is stepping up their game with legendaries lately
---
Many things
---
I just want a map that‚Äôs balanced and makes sense.
---
Be-cause I don't work at the mall!
---
Reinstall?
---
He really is over banned for no reason. It‚Äôs mainly because people are either sheep and just vote to ban anything or they are solo queuing and don‚Äôt communicate well with the rest of the team.
---
I did, that is where I overclocked my monitor.
---
I have tried still doesnt work
---
Is this now his same pose in the weapon/skin menus? I always hated that one of Sledge. It seems very awkward.
---
Joined during white noise, I was garbage. I got bored and stopped playing during grim sky. Came back during phantom sight and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm starting from scratch but I‚Äôm level 50 and everyone is being toxic coz I‚Äôm bad lol

What do you mean wasting time? I‚Äôve heard people say that a couple times and I just don‚Äôt know what it means. Like regard siege I meanüôÇ
---
I mean my Monitor is running in 77hz no Problem, Windows and testufo.com confirm that.
---
There is a possibility.
---
His left hand holds onto nothing lol
---
What i meant by that is vigil is good to avoid getting droned out while roaming. Since u wont be in too high of ranks that isnt important yet so stick with ops like lesion or rook for now
---
Ah fair enough
---
Not everyone wants to join a party. Me and my buddy have mics and will use them in game chat. We don't wanna join your party.
---
Hey don‚Äôt get mad at me, I‚Äôm just trying to help. There is only so much Ubisoft can do to fix toxicity and at this point they‚Äôve pretty much done the most they could. Take it upon yourself to avoid this issue with a squad. It doesn‚Äôt solve the issue but it sure as hell beats the alternative.
---
Sweet, I really fell in love with it last couple of days, increased mag size really did a lot for it.
---
Feels bad. Did you get your win back?
---
Hmm i play with controller on xbox and my aim is way more precise than this. U cant use that as an excuse mate. Plat2 is possible with a normal controller
---
 Might‚Äôve been buffed up by the doc

I feel as if I were the only one who loved this color and design. The new plat color doesnt make me feel as good as this did.
---
Making it so that down in your teammates activates reverse from the fire would fix the problem.
---
  None of my friends play this game anymore except for one.  And I'm not gonna go seeking other people they should just fix the goddam problem and do their fucking jobs!  I should have to go out of my way to avoid retards and team killing trolls
---
I've learned from my mistakes
---
The only skin in the entire game I actually want.
---
*blank stare.
---
"The Run-Outs were the worst. You knew it was death when they picked Basement.
---
Ohhhh ok that makes sense, Lesion was my other choice I just find Vigils kit and character really interesting
---
I never understood the hatred towards cosmetic microtransactions in live games. Y‚Äôall understand an entire team is being payed a lot of money to make new maps, ops, guns, balancing changes, cosmetics, and events constantly right? Why would you care about the microtransactions when they‚Äôre the exact reason you‚Äôre constantly getting all that without having to pay more than what you bought the game for?
---
I've been playing this game since the alpha!
---
I started in Blood Orchid
---
Yeah, nice charm tbh, but my absolute favourite is still Happy Sam. I know it isn‚Äôt legendary, but I just love it
---
Me too buddy

I like Marley's content, him and Dom are pretty funny together, but sometimes, just sometimes, I find his plays a bit suspicious....Not that I'm implying he's actually cheating, but damn, some of the stuff he pulls off is just nuts to me.

This is sick

*T H I C C*

I have a Logitech headset but I believe the volume was lower than usual.

Oh definitely! Putting it together little by little, thanks for the idea!

Theres a screenshot function on the PS4

of course its ok! i feel really great when people want to use my art as their backgrounds
---
I joined in Para bellum. Wow it was longer then I realized. I still feel like a mood!!!
---
Pls no, there‚Äôs nothing worse than a cav main
---
Nothing you did in this clip was only possible with cav
---
If Kapkan‚Äôs EDD is detonated, it will also detonate the Vulc√°n shield.
---
Would fit both imo
---
what

BOSGACOG

Off for repairs.
---
But Kali actually looks hot. Gridlock is hideous.
---
Honestly, not the worst picture I‚Äôve seen.
---
Too poor for that shit
---
I play on pc?
---
They don't have a system for it, so everything would have to be done manually. Paying someone to do it from their end would be a waste of money unless it's a click of a button, which it isn't. Granted it isn't super hard but mistakes can be made. 
---
There is no justification to say "Hackers can do it, so it's possible." The skins are in the game so of course someone may have them. Ubi's stance has never been that it was impossible, just that they won't do it regardless.
---
legendary skins are actually just special commons
---
Oof, but it all worked out in the end!
---
Killing him after he healed you? That's disrespectful. You owe Doc your firstborn
---
Yes but that kapkan trap is too low to actually trigger if someone jumps over the shield.
---
Believe me i had someone just jump in and the kapkan trap didn't blow up the goyo shield.
---
Ah then I do not know. Haven't ever played on console. Sounds like a bug. I've had one where it says the game started but all of us were still at the main menu. Could hear each other on voice chat and text message both teams but the match never actually started. Only had that once though.
---
That‚Äôs easy to see
---
Your Loadout is awesome, kitchen is also a good spot I personally enjoy the spot above lobby more but I guess it's up to you. And as a Tip I would say don't overuse the turret the shotgun is a better choice, however the turret is an awesome shield and a good way to get the first or last few kills
---
People use the maps to cover up thier garbage aim. Drone more and if someone is holding an angle. Pre. Fire. Them. Not that hard.
---
You said no earlier, sorry I‚Äôm not familiar with CS so I couldn‚Äôt tell you were lying
---
Also show me how you know every player is being kicked in a third of their matches lmao. I‚Äôve been playing for 2000 hours and I have 3 total abandons, am I just lucky with good servers????
---
so today‚Äôs the birthday?
---
Doesn't really answer my question, but thanks for the input.
---
my favorite glitch
---
I miss before black ice, everyone was so chill, cause we were all trash
---
it was 3 days ago, im just late
---
I guess it just seems more fun that way. Atleast for us. At the end if we wanna squad up we'll invite to the party. We tell them to go game chat but most seem to not want to because they're toxic kids screaming in the mics and blasting music. We can atleast communicate better with our team in game chat. For us anyways
---
Nah know one plays mnk like that
---
yup :)
---
I was with you until you mentioned hit registration. I do not believe it‚Äôs an issue.
---
I don't even think he's the best operator to ban personally. His gadget is really good but it's not game breaking. Especially now.
---
Don't forget the darkened celestial nighthawk underneath.
---
Quite a lot of languages use the Cyrillic alphabet
---
*is skeleton*

Remember the part where I said I have videos of it

My first legendary aswell, made me buy Valkyrie as my first op aswell
---
oh, because today was my birthday and I was kinda surprised that today was my favorite games birthday
---
feel like they would forget about it
---
I find party chat a lot better because it lets you mute certain people or easily invite everyone, then there‚Äôs the chat functionality (at least on Xbox) so if someone has no mic they can still communicate a bit
---
Sorry man it was ranked, he had to go.  May he Rest In Peace
---
As a roamer your goal isn‚Äôt to get kills. Its is to delay the attackers from directly attacking the objective. You can do this by applying enough pressure to make them watch the flank and then make them come for u. But u can‚Äôt let them get too comfy or they will just go for site and leave u last alive. With vigil they will struggle to find you on drone and therefore it will be more of a nuissance to get rid of u and focus on obj.
---
Favela is hot trash
---
Operation Health is a 3 month period of time
---
That's worse than cas though.
---
Ubisoftde on Twitter iirc
---
Even if they did forget, they would've noticed it while reworking the map
---
What I really mean by that is that it‚Äôs only really worth playing characters that will help you buy time or stay alive such as Doc.
---
I really like that, i got a c75 legendary recently that looks mint as well. Good job stepping up legendaries ubi. Next on the list should be seasonal skins
---
Because then the problem would still exist when you‚Äôre right side up. Like when you‚Äôre playing on a railing while rappelled and want to peek over it, it was very difficult to not accidentally vault all the way up
---
In a day or two you‚Äôll have the muscle memory to press space at the top and it won‚Äôt be an issue
---
Ok that makes a lot of sense üòÅ
---
damn. happy birthday tho!

Yeah that's true. I'm on xbox too

thanks dude, means a lot

We all know the best charm is the legendary doge charm. My friend got it and I'm jealous of him :(
---
idiot who doesn‚Äôt keep up w news here: what is it?
---
Yay another headgear for an op I‚Äôll never get
---
Lmao my first legendary was birchwood for glaz
---
Just try it next time in the end it‚Äôs better to get on party chat even if you don‚Äôt enjoy it and establish communication. It‚Äôs always reassuring to have teammates (for me) that talk and call out, in the end it‚Äôs better than someone who is a godly ash main and refuses to talk
---
I guess? I mean trying to class operators like that is without benefit but if you really have to then yes I suppose she is the closest operator on attack to a medic.
---
Ralphie is the actual skin of the old guard.
---
if only this was true for every occasion, massive slacking by Ubi.  
---
a 60 iq monkey could even code the most simple wallhack, with some hiding no one will ever find out.
---
I mean, yes and no.  Yes because she boosts her teammates and gives them a range of buffs and health, but no because the health and boosts aren‚Äôt permanent.
---
Absolutely!!!
---
Yes the repeal breaks shields and that of course apply a to Vulc√°ns.
---
I am so sad about new mire voice lines. They dont have any character, and she doesnt even sound spanish. It sounds more like someone from the US is trying to sound spanish.
---
Yeah, it's still in the quick match playlist though.
---
It‚Äôs not about the amount of kills one person has but it‚Äôs about the team and how they cooperate
---
I mean I never had a problem before the change and didn't even know people complained about it. Im just saying it should he optional not to entirely remove the feature.
---
Blitz has big booty
---
Yay another skin for a gun I never use
---
I had 12 kills on my first placement match and we lost. ‚ÄúHey guys could you not spawn peak this round? You‚Äôre not very good at it.‚Äù 10 seconds into the round 3v5. ‚ÄúOk thanks for listening‚Äù
---
Friend runs zofia and lesion constantly so don't want to pick them up
---
do the swiss have a special ops unit?
---
Ight, imma head out...
---
No. Ever since they decided not to have a campaign mode unlike EVERY other rainbow six game, I truly dont give a rats ass about a story in this one. I only see this as a multiplayer game and nothing else. I prefer more content or a second operation health. Just something that improves the game somehow
---
Forget the pro's name but I remember a doki holding white stairs on Kafe with the cz during the last invitational.
---
Holy shit
---
I‚Äôm going to pull the ping card, I will also pull the clothing isn‚Äôt part of your body card and that guns aren‚Äôt lasers card.
---
You didn't provide any evidence to him having cancer lmao
---
Less than 24 hours of full release and this guy is a pro-strat because he played ranked on it and thinks it sucks.
---
I prefer it over the other high fire rate guns as it has little recoil, comparable ttk, and a large mag.
---
Thanks, edited my comment.
---
Honestly, I just fill currently. Mainly because I only have base ops but I usually just grab whatever the team is missing/needs
---
Does this mean Swiss operators in the future?
---
I am so lost regarding what this comment means but I absolutely love it üíô
---
Yeah, I always felt a bit bad hitting it, but you gotta be able to silence the music and noise from the environment.
---
Rappelling does DMG I got killed ones by someone rappelling through the window lol.
---
can u link to ur post
---
No, I didn‚Äôt. I never claimed to have done so, I also didn‚Äôt reference another post without any links to said post
---
I mean they didn't travel all together tho... And feasibly it would work but nobody was watching anyone's back
---
They already do this. They added the RFF to squads if they don‚Äôt get it all it‚Äôs because they are not queued up together.
---
unranked but with less rounds
---
Casual was a way of life quick match is gay as fuck
---
Hey, do you play ranked? Would like to meet and play with german :&amp;
---
Literally hidden as far as possible away from the site. It truly is impressive
---
Oooh, gotcha gotcha. I didn't get far in Destiny, so!
---
thank you

You can just say no lol

It is really satisfying if you get a one tap and see it uhhh

As well as the rest of the team.

Well... i can.

Damn level 339

I saw this awhile back and was disappointed.

That's why I still rock my diamond skin

i posted another post like this one but it got downvoted :(

Wouldn‚Äôt put it past Ubisoft they attend not to share everything that they touch in patch notes
---
Who
---
Nothing wrong with that.
---
Wow, one I might actually use/want.
---
cut the video, man.
---
Thanks for the feedback, I had no idea. Do you have any idea when they implemented this?
---
\#bringbackcasual This is a hashtag I've encountered and I think we should spread it around in the community.
---
Yeah... I need a life
---
Her ability literally allows her to breach kek
---
U think I'm playin?
---
They really seem to have stepped up their game, or just realized most players want black skins.
---
It‚Äôs been around since a couple of weeks into ember rise.
---
Naa.
---
Wait, u can buy it? Wtf. I thought they were making it limited. F
---
Dont worry I'm 251 üòú
---
How dare you disrespect master, you should be t-bagged by Cav for your sins
---
Im saying i like that idea. And im a vigil main
---
Agreed, I just throw in the sight Bc people might fight for it. Iron sight improvement like the P9 would be very nice
---
DAMMIT WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THESE AS UNIVERSAL SKINS ;-;
---
Some people like the new gamemode, it's alright but I do prefer Casual though.
---
Bruh only the fakes BUY ash elite
---
right?
---
And just think they plan on going for 50 seasons
---
And even if they don't do the plant spam the drone is visible for 2 seconds after the blast
---
Sure what about the new operators
---
Yes ghost recon one of the worst Ubisoft titles ever released
---
oh yeah my bad, nice flair
---
My life story
---
#DAMN BOI HE THICCQ
---
This headgear practically screams "DELTA". I love it.
---
Oh yeah nobody has ever gotten one of those before
---
That's probably one of the weirdest suggestions I have heard. Like teammates seeing through them is an issue.

Battlefield 1 niggas remember this helmet
