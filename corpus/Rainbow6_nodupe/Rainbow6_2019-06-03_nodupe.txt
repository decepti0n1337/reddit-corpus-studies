What's the video in the background (the guy dancing) from?

I love it, I will probably buy it.

How do you get 4 tags? Like maverick nomad smoke and ela?
---
So this is "mid" 1v1 yet you have all your traps left, your cam and both reinforcements. And he just happened to go AFK.
---

---
Yeah, ok. lol.
---
I havent played much ranked this season since my friends have all dipped from siege, and i wonder why consider what a shitstorm this season was- but thats my casual stats, as you see i clearly stated ‚Äúim a casual secure player, but a bomb ranked player‚Äù as when i play casual i could give less fucks, but when i play ranked i actually wanna try a little. And, i play also, i played like 5-6 matches of ranked today, i did not see one echo, until the final match and final round, and we got his yokais.
---
Claymores are fine
---
Worth using my data for
---
Tachanka with on valk cam
---
I never heard of discounts before the end of season.
---
yep
---
I looked at this picture for a while thinking it was a video lol
---
He needs his deployable shield before anything. 
---
A glaz like HUD so teammates can inundate him with smoke as he takes ppl out.
---
What edition?
---
Lesion, ela, maestro, smoke.
---
Zofia stops defuse.
---
lol
---
Crouch walking is your best friend; barb wire is also a good alarm, always ADS a corner or hallway when moving between long hallways and areas, always have an exit planned if things go awry, impacts are good for distractions/rotation holes/ killing someone while they‚Äôre injured, use cams when you can, be aware of enemy team comp to ensure you won‚Äôt get pinched by lion/jackal/dokkaebi/blitz so you‚Äôre able to decide if you want to roam/lurk or stay around the objective. When it comes to roaming you have to pick an operator that suits your play style, some are good for just fragging while others a better at harassing and wasting the attackers time
---
Go to user flair hit edit and you can write in different combinations
---
Really?? I‚Äôve also been playing since white noise and I‚Äôve never seen this message once
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt feel this, I ace when I get back, and I never know how
---
Make it remote controlled. Please god
---
The music makes you cool af.

Yeah for real, as soon as I upgraded to PC and started working on montages and started to grow decently.
---

I‚Äôve been grinding on BFV too, haven‚Äôt played in a while, but every so often

Hey it's you again. Go away. This is my domain. I've claimed this thread for America

They stopped doing end of season discounts on weapon skins a long while ago.

That‚Äôs the beauty of it. Don‚Äôt give them money then. Other people feel differently. If they think x y z is worth $20 then that‚Äôs fine. No one is forcing them to buy anything. 
---
Do you feel the same way about the lottery or any other game of chance? The game is rated M after all.
---
I did get the glaz headgear and septicemia on the 9x19 for the Russians
---
Very much okay with that.
---
map hitbox
---
See you in hot!
---
High plats/diamonds are easy to play against I ranked but when I queue up for cas it‚Äôs nothing but brain dead lvl40s holding angles in some odd spot for the whole round :(
---
What they should do is make it like a cut out like doorways in Favela
---
It's a good change. Next I would decrease her ROF a bit because 980RPM for a "support" operator is a bit much imo.
---
Idk, you sound pretty upset about losing internet points.
---
Also, thanks for not screaming at me for playing secure! Dont get me wrong though, ifully agree hes op in some cases, but as i said, who isnt? (And again, dont say blackbeard) like, 2 seconds left, and echo, by some miracle, has both drones and isnt dead, you‚Äôre fucked, to put it bluntly, but then again, 2 seconds left and you hit a gu, fucked, 2 seconds left and an ela throws a grizmot at you? Fucked. It just depends

I also played against Macie, Zironic and Flynn aswell when they played on EU. Played two matches (won 1 , losed 1).

For them its a regular match, but for my it felt like a final. I was more hyped and thrilled then i was tryharding lol.

Fun fact. Sky and chalet have 1 viable site whereas Hereford and Fortress have 3. The issue with Hereford and Fortress are they their layouts don't really fit siege, because they are L hallway layouts.

Hmmm
---
Good Meme
---
tower or hereford
---
the worst part about the maps is that i wanna learn only the ranked maps, because if they are on ranked it means they are better designed maps, but i cant play only these maps on casual. This makes me play "useless" maps that makes me play even worse because i get lost haha
---
And people we glitching w deployable shields to where there would be a shield in front of their torso and head so they couldn't be headshot
---
Yes yes it would lord
---
Jager and Bandit want to know your location
---
Before ranked limits I got Diamond on a smurf in 13 total games. I was like level 14, had a 13.0W/L and 3.0K/D.
---
These stats are only for ranked so it's entirely possible they've barely played.
---
Tower. I always feel paranoid of roamers when attacking, not sure if anyone else feels the same.
---
 Being efficient
---
And kinda lazy
---
lmao
---
It gives you links to .mp4 files to save onto your computer
---
its from sonic unleashed it plays after you finish a level
---
He is literally shooting through the unbreakable wall
---
Why tho
---
Wait we aren‚Äôt allowed to use barricades? I haven‚Äôt played in a while?
---
No yeah, if that‚Äôs an option I always do that. The problem is maps like outback where you have an objective with a window and a window right outside objective that are essential entry places that you can‚Äôt enter without someone using a grenade to destroy the mat because you can‚Äôt repel.
---
I use it for that
---
*deployable shields (bc of exploits/glitching)
---
not really that fast
---
Is that a post it on the camera? Smart.
---
The last shot on pulse missed, but the shot before hit. You fired 3 shots at him. One was over his left shoulder, one hit him in the jaw, and one was over his right shoulder. The middle shot that hit him didn‚Äôt produce much of a muzzle flash so it‚Äôs hard to see it, but if you watch the ammo counter you can tell when you fired the bullet.
---
The skin on the right looks awful.
---
Worst map in the game - Favela
---
Worst Ranked map - Hereford Base
---
Do you have full sauce?
---
House is more frustrating to play than Tower. That being said, I hate Tower the most because rounds always take too long from its size
---
Knowing me, I would‚Äôve found a way to screw that up
---
Clothing isn‚Äôt part of the hitbox you kept shooting her helmet
---
You can see r6 emotes and then you can choose snoomojis and it has doge

Holographic or ACOG

The shields are only sideways in killcams not in game

This guy knows what‚Äôs up ^

 R6's matchmaking is a modified version of MS' TrueSkill.  True Skill actually tries to match new players with established average players.  I'm not sure this was carried over to R6, but it seems likely.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 from  [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/) 
---
**Q: I am playing my first ranked game in a game mode. Will I be matched more likely with another player new to the game mode or with someone else?**
---
**A**: When you play your first ranked game in a game mode, the TrueSkill ranking system assigns you a mean skill level *Œº* in the middle of the leaderboard but a maximal variance *œÉ*2 of skills; it‚Äôs your first game so the ranking system should reflect its lack of knowledge. Now, the TrueSkill ranking¬†matchmaking criterion takes its maximal value for other players with the same mean skill level *Œº* but a small variance *œÉ*2. Thus, if available, you will be matched with another player in the middle of the leaderboard but with a much smaller *œÉ*2: a player of established average skill.
---
Why is this better than matching you with someone else new to the game? Well, this other player may, in fact, be one of the most skilled players (who just happened not to have played the game mode yet) whereas you really are a beginner. Then, you two are (up to) 50 skill levels apart. Matching you with someone who is an established average player guarantees that your skill level gap is never bigger than 25 levels.

I got the Rainbow gun skin for Kapkan,

There is many other ways this game differs from others; the extremely destructible environment, 5v5 "Class" based elimination game-mode, the EA like amount of DLC characters, the unique gunplay and feel to weapons, the smooth feeling of controlling the characters, I could go on. Just because the headshot system has existed from game start does not mean it is good. Meta constantly changes, and as people get better they realize how superior SMG's are to other weapons.
---
Also, it really, really, isn't that rare. I've got alot of clips, of me getting shot and me shooting others through a wall.
---
I like the idea of being able to veto a map. I get border so much in ranked and although I like border, I hate border in ranked. Every round is the same room, Lockers... every. damn. round. "Guys, I know we lost the last 2 defense rounds in lockers... but lets pick lockers"
---
Risking dying or them throwing a flash/allowing a shielded teammate to go first is a worse idea then to just shoot them through a wall. You really have a pretty good chance of getting them if you aim at head level.
---
He literally couldn't, the gun is suppressed so there is no indicator or bullet trail.
---
Also, how the hell would you know? He's behind a wall?
---
Except you can buy a PC that can run Siege for $500
---
Hang in there and never give up!
---
I've heard the same for bearing 9 and when I used it there was no difference, both were equally easy.

I've tried it for the smg-11 and again, no difference. Nothing are the same.

Your first point is wrong, I know the screen shake you're talking about, because it can also happen on PC, it depends entirely on how they grip the mouse and what they're idle position is. All of my friends that are ass at CS:GO have the screen shake you're talking about, they use a lot of wrist movement for aiming, they jitter a lot. Stuff like that, obviously some console players are going to have the screen shake if they're not use to using a mouse or aiming with their arm.
---
  
---
Your second point is also just wrong. period. Lmfao, I'm literally not the kinda person to shit on platforms. I think consoles and the console communities have their place, and demographics. I think it's fucking stupid to try to coral every single gamer to PC, because competition and player needs are important for business and consumer progression.
---
But saying that controllers are even capable of the same performance ceiling as MnK is just ignorant.
---
Look at clips posted to this sub every day and compare the casual MnK user on PC to the clips of console game play we get. It's not even close. I know people can get good with Controller because I use to play console, and I use to be really fucking good. But you can look at almost any competitive shooter in the market and see the areas where MnK shine. Imagine if CS had been bred on console, and never saw the light on PC. Where would movement players and KZ and Bhop, and NoSpread, HnS, be? Nowhere. Imagine trying to be a movement player on console cs while maintaining good aim. Even Siege, a game that relies very little on movement heavy game play, sees a massive divide in movement styles and output from PC to Console.
---
Go buy Xbox CS and get good movement mechanics while being a fragger. than come back and talk to me
---
Just buy him its not that much

Hell no, Clash does not need a nerf so significant she is practically rendered useless for any round Glaz is taken. He doesn‚Äôt even need a buff and he deserves the incoming nerf.

Siege is a horror game. Change my mind.

It was formatted incorrectly, since the edit, I see what you mean.

Don‚Äôt blame me for you overthinking and reading things that aren‚Äôt there. The analogy was simple, breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage. It wasn‚Äôt a bad analogy, you were just adding other comparisons to it to make it sound worse. Exaggerating a comparison to get a point across is very common. Never have I stated or implied they were the same thing. After accusing me of a fallacy that doesn‚Äôt work, you started adding things to my comment to make it work. But I have to say, your mental gymnastics are pretty amazing lol

LE MNK BAD!!!??????!?!?!?!?

Warden isn‚Äôt very important to the game as a counter to blitz. There are many counters: Frost, Lesion, Kapkan, Mute, Ela, Echo, maybe Smoke, C4 or impact grenade operators, and pretty much any team with good coordination.

You don‚Äôt need Warden to counter Blitz, you just need to be good with any of his counter operators.

Ubi literally made the new defending OP a 3 armor and Cap used to have grenades. Cap is amazing for rushes when you factor in his firebolts that are great for locking people in and out of obj and his AR/LMG he's much more useful than Dokkaebi. Balancing my ass. There's no point to run Dokkaebi if you have a lion and finka especially if you're smart and already have a mute. Plus Dokkaebi doesn't even get picked often based on her delta.
---
Mira, lesion or Zofia imo
---
Lmao
---
By undoing the locking system that you used after putting up the wall and putting that bigass wall into your pant pocket.
---
Lion on Defense. If he was a one speed, he would be the ultimate Hunter for stray attackers. Given that you use him properly.
---
Doc or Warden on Attack. Doc for the obvious, and Warden because it would be nice to be able to rush in with Ying, or creep in through smoke bombs while Glaz has my back.
---
3/6
---
Big man, strong, fast. Smol woman, fast not strong.
---
Seriously though, Capitao actually goes slightly slower with the LMG. It's not much, but it's there.
---
The better Hereford
---
kid stick to your shitty analogies and bad grammar, arguing with some brain dead high schooler about concepts that he seems incapable of grasping mentally isn't exactly how I want to be spending my Sunday night. Keep getting stomped out by MnK users in ranked.

Just a fyi enabling vsync will add input lag, which makes your mouse movements will have a delay before you see it ingame.

I wanna say Lesion just cuz Mira is tricky if you don‚Äôt know the spots. Lesion just kinda yeets his soup cans around and shoots people. High skill players would do better with a Mira but the average player would pick up Lesion much easier

Casual is something I only played when I was a new player. Matches where longer. People tried less. And it was all around a good experience. But the by level 80 or so me and my friends decided we where tired of casual and moved on to rank. The match times was shorter. Which is something I love. Casual matches allow for more time to coordinate attacks but it also gets annoying when it's a 1v5 and the last dude dude thinks he can go full beaulo. Ranked is faster, no Vote to kick, and pro league rules are something I love. I do play casual from time to time. But it is a dumbed down version of the game in my opinion. It's not a bad thing in my opinion. But its casual.
---
&gt; There's no excusing that at all

Do you people really not hear how you sound? Peripherals and the advantages they offer have been debated since the beginning of time, fight sticks, racing wheels, MnK, controller. Hell, I've come across console players that claim scuf controllers are cheating. You realize a couple years down the line, Sony and Microsoft are gonna realize how important integration is. MnK on console at some point are going to become standardized. Acceptable performance in video games is starting to plateau. After years of consoles holding back video game development and technological pursuit, they're finally getting to the point where cross platform-ability and integration are possible and healthy for the culture. You think once all of this is integrated the chosen default input method that's chosen / standardized is going to be controller? Why do you think no serious eSport is console based? RL is the only remotely popular eSport that uses controller, because it's usually the most advantageous and fitting input method for the game. FPS games are dominated by MnK players because it's the best input method for the genre. I've heard console players say that MnK offer no advantage because they're just that good with controller (lol). Eventually MnK is going to be natively supported, you'll obviously still be allowed to use controller, but input method is going to be about choice instead of what the platform restricts you to. Wake up sheeple

There is really nothing at stake in casual except for XP and renown. Compared to ranked where people care about their rank. So people usually load up casual to take a break. Or it's a place new players go to learn the game. While I do agree that team play should be encouraged in casual most will ignore the callouts as nothing is really at stake. They dont mind losing a round.
---
Oh, and its on a 3 speed
---
I am, the adapter emulates controller inputs. This adds a *very small* amount of time as the adapter must convert M&amp;KB inputs into controller inputs. This still faster than it takes to recenter a joystick.
---
The Xim Apex has an 8ms delay as told by an [Administrator of the Official Xim Tech forums.](https://community.xim.tech/index.php?topic=48217.0). I have not been able to find the delay advertised by any other adapter manufacturer, however they all advertise it as "unnoticeable", so it is a fair assumption that they will all be around 10ms.
---
Joysticks recenter after a few hundred milliseconds, although this varies depending on the controller. This is still a very small amount of time, but not even close to the input lag of an adapter.
---
Put the MnK away and feel free to follow the rules like the rest of us. Otherwise, please go play a different game.

It's ubisofts fault, they should've long time ago enable mouse and keyboard in Siege and then seperate them into their own matchmaking like Fortnite (and let them play against pc players). They are just lazy or don't want to commit resources to this problem or they don't know how (it's not like they are known for their good coded bugless games).

There are multiple modes for a reason dude. Now if people are playing like this in rank then it‚Äôd be a problem but if you‚Äôre taking the time to learn maps/angles you can take the time to find a squad
---
omg this thermite
---
I'm hoping the game has a class based "hardcore" multiplayer with no aim assist and higher gun recoil. But I really doubt it. I fear that like most call of duty games they will sacrifice long term player count for short term high numbers.
---
Whilst I am God awful at r6 I love the concept and work that ubisoft have put in over the years. The esports scene around r6 is testament to that.

she can be played as a hard rusher, but she also fills in the role of slow, methodical push with droning if you want. she's a good 2 speed 2 armor, so that gives you a bit survivability and her gadget can give you additional info when you're out of drone (conc nades blow up on proximity). she also has claymores to cover your back from that nasty cav flank. 
---
all in all a very well rounded op with huge amount of utility - that's why you'll see her being picked in almost every Pro league lineup - unlike lion or Ying, which are much more situational.

Ubisoft addressed it a couple months ago that there is still work for them to do before they can use the data centers in South Africa.  Look at the thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axx8j2/ms_azure_is_ready_and_south_africans_are_ready_too/) for that comment.

The lighting was pretty bad up until a year ago. Looking outside from indoors was like staring into the sun.

Breaks the balance of attacker vs defender over ranges? Breaks the whole CQB based game of defenders want close range fights, attackers want long range fights? Encourages spawnpeeking?

Guess you're on PC?
---
&gt; Currently aiming down sights is fast af, you can maintain full accuracy while crouching, leaning, walking etc.
---
Wat? They never changed accuracy and movement mechanics.
---
Console not pc
---
not really, buff = makes it better
---
nerf = makes it worse
---
the recoil got worsened, therefore it got nerfed
---
Because the majority is always right... but well. You will need to adapt sooner or later anyways. Next console generation will probably way more open in terms of Mouse and Keyboard.

"fully functioning" hmmmmm

Reflections are already in the game I think, atleast partially. Mozzie and Nokks vortex sight reflects alot.

Canonically, the multiplayer in this game is training so it makes sense this way.

Just to mention you forgot to add that the scorpions damage is set at a max 23, already very small and pathetic especially due to the bullshit recoil that is pretty random. But past 20m it drops to 15 which is just.... why?

Well nice to see that im not alone with my opinion :D . Sorry for repost, didn't remember to check if this had been discussed recently.

When someone destroys your yokai

Well, kapkan traps and nitro cells one shotted everyone, including shields, despite of where were people facing. 
---
Shotguns were quite meta, they could one-shot people from afar.
---
You literally couldn't rush this game much at the beggining. Also people didn't quote know all the angles and stuff, so many people just had to go slowly to not get lost, because illumination was different too.

That‚Äôs only 1 destroyed yokai wait till they destroy 2 :)

I've seen a few videos where players are oblivious to enemies that are on the middle of these types of staircases while walking up, and some might blame on aiming down sights with ACOGs. Here's my perspective of me just running up the stairs and not seeing the enemy. Take care and scan through all angles on the staircase especially this blindspot.

The reason why they changed it is BC the old ones caused ear fatigue and made some of them vomit during pro matches.

On the main page of r/rainbow6 there are ... click on that and change user flair
---
Bank, border, clubhouse, coastline, consulate, Oregon and villa are the pro league maps. Personally for me, I don‚Äôt think this is too narrow of a map pool but also I feel like I never play them. It‚Äôs always Hereford, chalet, skyscraper and fortress for me. Almost all the pro league maps are within 5% of win loss for attack and defend besides villa which is defender favored at 57%.  I think that those 7 are a good amount for ranked. If anything take out fortress, and Hereford and put in outback.

Ut has to do with their ability to update the TTS as frequently as they need to.  Patches have to be approved by consoles and it takes too long to be effective.

i believe that all changes on console need to be approved by microsoft and sony, then they receive a window to make those changes. so if they made a ts on console, it would be more restrictive and out of fairness would put delays on testing on the pc servers. i would love a ts, even if it‚Äôs updates came out after the pc changes, but as of now it‚Äôs strictly pc.
---
It isn't.  While nobody on this reddit knows for sure why not, the most common theory is because of the approval process required to push a patch through to the client on consoles.  With PC, Ubisoft can drop a client-side change as frequently as they want; with console, those patches go through an approval process through Microsoft and Sony before it's allowed to be pushed to clients.  This approval takes time, and given that the TTS is only up for a limited window, much of that time would be spent waiting on approvals as opposed to gathering data about what's working.

I did also make the transition from PS4 to PC in October, and the little camera movement he does around 0:06 is like when you have high DPI and run out of space and you lift your mouse off the desk to readjust it

Dokkaebi cuz she thic- I mean cuz her kit is really good, I like dmr's and her one is probably the best one in the game. The bosg is a fun option and also viable given you have the aim. Her smg-12 is rng reliant, its great. I don't like her C-75, never have, used it once. Her recent nerf to her ability didn't really change anything for me, I only use it to see if anyone is nearby, don't really care if it rings after that.

This game never stops amazing me haha. Correct me if I'm wrong but does this mean Ubi designed a logo for the killfeed specifically for a black eye kill lol?

Was just asking people's opinions please don't take this as I want them all removed, it just seems that's what Ubisoft is doing to attackers to take that pick rate ability so maybe that's what they were heading towards

IN MY OPINION. Must state that before I get jumped by people and stabbed. Too much meme-y content feels like your trying to force being funny and it just isn't. Videos jump around too much so it's more like a Call of Duty montage than a siege video. If you want the bestest advice think out of the box be different from every other video. Also lost points coz of fortnite in your banner. DISGUSTAN

so if I got a rank at the beginning of the season, I'll still have it?

ffs, fix this already...

just search "rainbow six siege ranked guide" and scroll through till you see some from 3 or so years ago

wait this is the seasonal skin coming out for the new operation? i thought it was a summer event skin

I'm pretty sure they did fix this and then it came back in a later update but I don't know if I'm hallucinating or if they're really that bad at game development.

It was a really enjoyable video and you put a lot of effort in. The reason it didn‚Äôt get many views is because the title. It‚Äôs a good funny title but if you are trying to gain a following I suggest a bland title like ‚Äúsiege funny moments‚Äù something that will explain the video for now till people know who you are and know you do funny videos and then you can use titles like that or even use the same title but put in brackets (funny moments) 
---
Because you don‚Äôt get a lot of traffic your video got lost and probably why it didn‚Äôt get that many views. 
---
Hope it helps because from that video I saw you did it very professionally and you will grow naturally if you keep it up.

I was thinking the same thing

Wait so you play in pro league? If not I don‚Äôt see how using ‚Äúwell they don‚Äôt use it in pro league‚Äù as an argument. Pro league players are playing a completely different game then everyone in match making. The main difference is they train everyday for 12+ hours as a 5 stack. You can‚Äôt make an argument for match making using pro league. That‚Äôs like making road laws based on how NASCAR drivers drive, it makes no sense. Also, I normally don‚Äôt get traded until after I take out 2-3 sometimes 4 people. And BOSG is easily viable in high gold. Like I said, it‚Äôs a really easy gun if you know how to aim and roam. If you aren‚Äôt really great at both of those then definitely use the k1a or a different op.
---
Favea.
---
I wish I could have been there when the game first came out. If I had known what I know now, I prob would have had my first diamond

I don‚Äôt think he need a 4 storied map, like Hereford is. Eliminate top floor or maybe only add top floor entrances for stairway access only. Make them only entry points from above, and really limit playable space.

Soft destruction is the name of the game. It's not much but they do it better than anyone else. They can both open decently sized holes fairly quickly and they each have frag grenades which are S tier equipment. Their guns are simple and easy to use. They are very new player friendly.

No my point is that no high level players use the weapon for a reason. You literally don‚Äôt see plat players using bosg unless they‚Äôre memeing. There‚Äôs just no point in using a worse weapon it makes no sense when the K1A has great dps.

Strongly disagree with maps being "non-competitive". It is competitive, it has a wide range of strats (cool miras and their counters) for almost every floor except the ground floor.

Point is, spawnpeeking intel isn't the problem, it's the fact that the attackers should have acogs to challenge it or it's a fair fight essentially, which would stop spawnpeeking being high risk high reward, which would break the balance in it.

‚ÄúYeah man uhhh bring some hard breach, yeah okay Hibana for hatch....maybe a soft breach and a twitch, who else....someone to flush out roamers? Yeah we‚Äôre good.‚Äù

*‚ÄùOh fuck.‚Äù*

I'd hope the pin was included otherwise you'd be missing your limbs

I‚Äôm a thermite main cause that‚Äôs who my friends stuck me in when I first got the game. I found I liked his gun and always had something to do on most every site. I have about 33 hours in thermite so I‚Äôd like to think I embraced the roll.

Mute

No problem

Why not use big scottish man with heavy hammer? Big scottish man will break *YOU* if you say he's not enough.
---
*sad Blyat noises*
---
It‚Äôs subjective
---
Only the last few shots hit him, and Frost's gun does little damage.
---
This was before the global recoil changes took a shit on the scorpion. It was sooooo much better before grim sky. Now it‚Äôs completely garbage.
---
Plus this was originally just a joke so... Yeah deal with it. Plus I remember checking the elo. The 2 teams had roughly 400 elo difference.

A pc that runs 1080p at 60hz is definitely not more expensive than a newest gen. console lmao

I just jumped back on after over a year off.  I'm in the same boat.   Hang in there.  We'll get back up to speed.

I prefer this other pistol personally

Or a pistol
---
Oh didn't know that, I checked the patch notes and they didn't say anything. That's good to know.
---
Dude it‚Äôs a game in itself. You have to get into the right mindset, be ready to get wrecked until  you start using your brain. Use that anger to motivate you against your enemy, not your teammates.

dosnt vigil have an uzi as a secondary

They are still working on it in the Test Server though and isn‚Äôt complete but they have all week here to get a fix for it and have it ready for the live servers come next week.

Oh, fair enough. As long as it actually has an effect.

mate like i said before i play on both, you‚Äôre saying all console players are dumb which is stupid, they‚Äôre not dumb it‚Äôs just hard to aim with a fucking joystick, you‚Äôre just a neckbeard who thinks he‚Äôs right about everything and thinks he‚Äôs superior to everyone when you‚Äôre just an incel

In the video with the tweet it says ‚ÄúTrain up your friends for Operation Phantom Sight‚Äù this weekend on the proving grounds special event‚Äù

Weird flex but ok

Honestly above the display case where the portraits are is a significantly better place. Ash can't kill the Evil Eye from the window and you cover the Red hallway entrance for smoke plants.
---
It does have a nice hipfire
---
TK DOMINES
---
Go with the shamal headgear for smoke and then buy the lawn-dart greens uniform. It looks REALLY good together.
---
I was making a joke because they were doing the scene
---
No, this will be pick and ban. They said they would introduce it in a limited time event before the season went live.
---
Shotgun one taps don‚Äôt count
---
It doesnt say proving grounds special event, it's a free weekend
---
Nah, the one Vigil has is a MPA57 or MPA30
---
I originally thought Kaid actually had a DMR when he first came out, but then again it is basically a DMR
---
I‚Äôd rather them fix the game and then bring stuff new in. Like they need operation health 2.
---
Wait, thermite used to have grenades !?
---
I want bullet management. So I can go in with some extra ammo and repack my mags in a corner.
---
I'm excited for the fix for this. I'm so tired of hitting windows and missing opportunities for kills because all I can see is a board.
---
Eh, i never really got all the hype about this skin type. There are better skins in the game that aren't "epic", but then again, skin grades are all arbitrarily assigned anyway. But, then again its all opinion and a lot of people do like this skin so I'm in the minority I realize.
---
But he does tho. The demoralizer! /s
---
For the longest time, I was staring at this thinking how tf getting thse operators cost u 75 bucks...then realize elite was a thing lol

To suppose to be somewhat realistic you wouldn‚Äôt have it irl. Go to [r6 maps](r6maps.com) and it shows you the blue prints and what‚Äôs destructible and what isn‚Äôt. Also look at the bottom you have a compass and room name next to it
---
Im almost level 250 and Ive never heard the call banana on bank lol
---
Yeah I'm not sure if you know the definition of a preference.
---
I‚Äôve had this for one game but it only happed when i was watching mira
---
that's probably the only the best one sided mirror
---
I read the words ‚Äúfully functional‚Äù and was like wait wtf.
---
I like the lighting in the video, it looks soft and welcoming (in a tactical military fps kinda way)
---
You need Yokais and a shock drone then you will be complete
---
Heart attack. Didn‚Äôt you read Pulse‚Äôs bio? He is obsessed with heartbeats because of his condition.
---
Jesus that‚Äôs blurry
---
Thank you but this guy is a console expert we should listen to him and buy new ps4s because it's a gpu thing lmfao.
---
Your ping is reasonably low, but I‚Äôd bet that at least one of your shots landed after you were already dead on the server. They were holding the angle and it doesn‚Äôt seem like they wasted any time laying bullets into you. That shotgun is not a one hit kill, especially if the shots are a little high and some of the spread doesn‚Äôt land. 
---
Weird not to see how much health the other guy had left. I could have imagined that being a trade.
---
It's not REMOTELY your fault, but I know I often die in early round and I just do a lot of shit with my ops
---
Sorry had no filming equipment
---
I'd say run them through maps on a custom game and get them used to the layout of maps first then have them run through it with a drone to see the names of the room.
---
When they get comfortable doing that then you can tell them specific callouts in rooms like banana on bank.
---
It‚Äôs the 4 windows upstairs by the curve next to spiral

If he was on mnk he would lean from hip u retard

I thought this was in response to the fortress comment, my apologies

G36C without R4 getting in the way

They just need to rework on the top floor a little bit, don't really need to take the map out of ranked pool completely. 
---
New hereford is big, but it's not huge like Fortress.
---
Where abouts, im still not seeing it
---
Amazing drawing comrade
---
What?? You just can‚Äôt lean from the hip in console even if you use MnK, that‚Äôs a PC-only feature

You get that result but Rook &amp; Doc can see perfectly fine to peek you („Éé‡≤†Áõä‡≤†)„ÉéÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

I miss rainbow is magic :(((

Unranked people have mmr too

Oh no worries

So to the left of spiral stairs, there‚Äôs the 4 windows and like a curved hallway, that‚Äôs banana because it looks like a banana
---
Oh I get it now, thanks
---
Because you start at gold 4
---
operator bundle will never comes out , because operator price reduction
---
Why even play ranked if you wanna surrender? Go causal. You can leave whenever you want -_-
---
Yes
---
Can you please make it blurrier and more zoomed in? I can see it too well
---
Wait. Where's ol Thatcher?
---
Lol this needs a rework as bad as the clash glitch
---
Agree. Also loved the process of unlocking new operators!
---
Looking this game with fresh eyes when it released was a privilege
---
Red=RFF Points. If you lose too many points, RFF turns on. If you gain points, RFF can turn off. This can be done by helping the team like giving them plates or healing them.
---
You can‚Äôt just fix people leaving games. Also even though your teammate did leave that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt your fault at all. You may have been at a horrible disadvantage but the thing you and your remaining teammate did led to a loss.
---
Hello lbp6johnny,
---
Look in uplay, on the library tab
---
Well I wasn‚Äôt the one going negative
---
Thats kind of what its for
---
a map being balanced and promoting different viable strats usually goes hand in hand with watchability and entertainment. I think that point is entirely moot. I feel most people would argue that balanced maps are the most entertaining to watch. I don't know how you can have an even game, with close scorelines, and consider that more enjoyable than a shut out. You mention multiple points without awknowledging that they usually interject each other. You keep repeating this weird "who's opinion is more important" bullet, while pulling opinion pieces out of your back pocket. I can't tell you how many times I tune in to pro league, just to see the casters look slightly out of it, and obviously bored. Flynn has said something along the lines of "we'll be expecting this to be a defensive shut out, as it always is and as we are accustomed too" more times than I can count. Or Flynn correctly guessing what the outcome of a site hold will be. Because most the maps on a pro level are kinda cut and dry at that point. You'll notice that most the maps in Siege in general get to that point on a pro level. Most site outcomes are predictable unless a team fucks up, or unless they're playing against a team that's just in a better seed.
---
Also, 7 maps has almost nothing to do with fast bans, what is another couple of minutes worth of banning at the beginning of a map?? They have a small 7 map pool because teams have to put time and effort and scrims into each map, and polluting the map pool with too many maps, means more saturated games and less polished strats and game play. I don't think siege ranked should be much different. I don't think people should be able to choose to only queue for one map, but I also don't think your next ranked map should be a dice roll of luck. I hate fortress, themepark, hereford, and have unsavory opinions about a few others, I can still win them most the time, but I can't tell you how disproportionately I get put into games on hereford, themepark, and fortress. at the very least allow us to queue for a specific 7 maps and keep the map pool the same. just stop forcing new maps, unbalanced maps, and unfun maps that aren't even expected to be played at high levels of play

Punishment will develop like 15min to 1 hour to 8 hours etc. So if you disconnect alot you shouldnt be in ranked anyway.
---
Actually they were, Noble at least, all a little above 20 I believe, but either way it's pretty crazy when you realize that the vast majority of the human-covenant war was just straight up sacrifice upon sacrifice to try to gain any advantage they could against an enemy that was far superior.
---
Her SMG is full auto now
---
Replace blitz with thatcher
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind Outback all too much. It‚Äôs pretty competitive tbh
---
I did that the first time but it did not work, i just waited a hour and now it works again.
---
Pft, both attack and defense have a Moroccan op ;)
---
So close, yet so far
---
It has enough space around it. There was 29C in my room today though which might be the reason. I played for 2 hours without fan kicking in after I removed the top cover.
---
Nice one!
---
"So do i just count to 10 or...?"
---
Dota2 does the best about it. Putting you in a playlist with other leavers and only way to get out of there is to win a game :D

Once upon a time she was. Then came the dark (nerf) times.

Where‚Äôs the thatcher!?

What's next? Twitch drone? Yokai?

"How to hide" not "How to make bulletproof"

I miss being able to nitro Blitz from the front.

So you don't care if you lose power and get disconnected. Because i bet you money if you got disconnected somehow and before you could reconnect your team surrendered you'd be pissy about that too.

I feel like if you dont have all the ops, and you dont know everything about all the ops, you shouldn't attempt to rank them

Try to limit the FPS Display in game files, or play with V-sync (I know it's terrible)

Already tried that.

Probably a random pick

except every leaked elite has released the following season

Probably a random op

Who cares? If you like it buy it lmao there‚Äôs nothing else to it
---
I like the thot-patrol
---
He killed the entire enemy team, I believe a little celebration is deserved...
---
I hate when it comments twice
---
When you become better at the game, you will understand why those maps are unacceptable for competitive play. Bad maps don't suddenly become balanced when you get good and learn how to exploit their poor design.
---
It's a risk/reward system that puts the defender in an uncomfortable situation that favors attackers, most of the time.
---
Siege is about always paying attention, if you get taken out by someone running out, you weren't paying attention enough.
---
Preference my guy plain and simpleü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Your poor, poor bank account... Feed it money

In the situation he‚Äôs talking about, defenders are favored

What actually is this?

called it when blitz did his thing lol

also whyd you have to start when the hatch broke it was loud and it scared me :(
---
As long as they don't include the bandit skin... Please God make it stop....

Pretty good actually, most of my friends has been saying just use the keyboard and the mouse but i can‚Äôt be used to it

You r soo bad even the servers want you gone!
---
Passing around, comrade.
---
The broken parts already don't have hitboxes.
---
Thanks.I will buy  it.
---
Thanks, its just frustrating because I feel like ive let my whole team down you know? And it doesent feel like a earned kill, just a lucky hipfire

These r some shitty designs.

the game looks way more realistic than it does now

yeah but then you usually have enough boolets to shoot out around 150 heads, and nobody is that inaccurate

but dont use them to shoot out fapkan traps, you should always let them be

Mute. This man is just like me in real life. Few words but has a great Impact, when I'm playing Casual nothing is more satisfying than knowing the attackers couldn't find the Biohazard Container...

I‚Äôm sorry pls forgive me

Well, yokais that are hidden are difficult to see normally and IQ can take them out easily, valk cams may be in spots which are hard to see for the attackers and IQ can take them out easily, gu mines can be annoying and IQ can take them out easily, ADSs in which are on walls which you can get but need to be taken out and IQ can get them easily from above or below

Thanks I‚Äôll let you know if it works

...at least you won

and i want to sledge myself

Hitboxes are what allow physical interactions between models, and considering they are stuck in the broken window... yes they do in fact have hitboxes.

If you think otherwise then you don't know what a hitbox is.

---
Yea. The moment you hit that glaz fucked your day.
---
Smh that‚Äôs always how they get you
---
I think they want to keep the hitboxes for the debris so you can have a visible indicator on the ground around a window so you can see if someone has hit a piece out of it without actually having a direct view of the window.
---
But I do agree: They should remove the hitbox interaction with the remainder of the window so it can fall away consistently for all clients.
---
You don't know what a hitbox is.
---
People invite you to party grab your ip with ip grabber exe then paste it to a ddos service and send you a 30k

Well then you REALLY have no excuse. You are just bad at critical thinking or have no standards.

Honestly despite ostensibly occupying the same roles, it seems like both operators have vastly different jobs. Thatcher deals with ahrd breach while twitch hunts down maestro cams, adses, Mira windows, and the occasional lesion mine. While thatcher's job almost solely consisted in getting rid of any denial gadgets, and maybe throwing in a emp nade during a plant to disable cams.
---
Yes yes YES!
---
I got Wifiman, that showed that my wifi was running fine on a separate channel. I had to delete my local files, and rename my game folder, and then reinstall my game. It took like 10 minutes, but brought my ping back to normal
---
It is the greatest of all.
---
Not trying to be rude, but then theres not really a point to commenting.
---
Thatcher is able to pop maestro cams as well, though he has to shoot them after the nade goes off and expose himself.
---
Hes packing
---
That image was displayed on an office computer in the Unity version of SCP: Containment Breach I think
---
Damn. Seems almost too easy. Thank you!

They are not even close to useless. Someone hit by one of them is really gonna struggle to fight back.

Nokk's interesting, but I'm not sure she's useful outside of being Spooky Bitch 2.0 or fucking over the enemy Maestro, or when you're like me and an FMG-9 + D'Eagle is your dream loadout in R6S, and Warden is too situational, even if he is a really neat idea.

Thanks, first round into the CASUAL game I was put into the other team went Doki, lion and Jackal, so that was fun
---
I def recommend mozzie. I'm an intel slut and like to know where everyone is at what time. wallbangs make me so happy. His drone steal ability might not seem like much at first, but it is a HUGE help later. Its echo but with three cams, no blur and sneaky tech. Not to mention he has The commando which has a large mag, little recoil and angled grip, sidearm shotgun for close quarters combat (I call it the shotfun) and last but not least a nitro cell which is a definite must have when using drones.
---
It‚Äôs *CASUAL*, never expect anything from non ranked modes..

Pulse is more fitting for the role, but J√§ger can do the job too.

Bandit for me is important when it comes to the ‚Äúbandit trick‚Äù therefore he might stay in objective often. I usually move a little away from the objective but not enough for a *roamer*.

you should buy it again, but probably on a discounted price since you owned it already. Maybe like a 50% off
---
What are you looking for exactly? Like a logo or operators..?

Yes sir

Holographic on Yings gun. Too much kick with acog the holo provides perfect flicking/close quarters fighting
---
A logo pretty much

Flexin‚Äô my MP7 black ice on Bandit ^_^

I know no one asked but I like this discussion so forgive me for also adding my opinions.

I like Sledge's and Bandit's for how they look. I love Thatcher normally but I don't like how his Elite looks, but that's just me. Valkyrie is cool, but Mute's is definitely my fav animation with Jaeger's at second.
---
Literally send me a PNG of a bullet flying past you in siege. The white line is the smoke trail, you cant see physical bullets in Siege lmao
---
Also, bullets do not make a noise flying past you with a suppressor, feel free to hop in a custom match with a friend and have him shoot near you from a range with a suppressed weapon.

I‚Äôm new at siege and i didn‚Äôt know you could buy operators with gold

Competitive games are always full of toxicity, look at Overwatch and CSGO. People leave mid-game and even teamkill you..

It looks freaking awesome but when equipped and playing with it it looks like a pretty typical white skin tbh. Still this it's cool tho
---
I dont get it? 2 Kills in Casual? Am i missing anything
---
Just curious, why?
---
I agree on this, holo and reflex works 200x better
---
yeah true.. I just wish I had friends who play casually. Every Friend of mine is toxic unfortunately.
---
The map is also hideous.

Are you on console or PC? If console, I totally understand because comms were always horrible because everyone was in their own parties. But if you‚Äôre on PC, randoms generally have mics and will communicate enough to make it playable. I‚Äôm in the upper gold/low plat range on PC, and every game I have at least one person with a mic and often times full teams with mics. I solo queue 90% of the time and I have a great time with the game still.

Personally for me Jaeger is the best roamer good gun. Has a passive ability and good secondary if you run out of ammo in your primary
---
Pulse is getting a good buff where the time between dropping your sensor to your gun is reduced so it makes a viable choice for roaming. 
---
Bandit to me is a great lurker you can bandit trick and then when your successful/unsuccessful you can lurk around obj and pick people off. But he‚Äôs also solid on roam
---
Not a bad idea, but I think the easiest fix is if Caviera downs someone, which isn‚Äôt hard to detect, if they DC while down it automatically triggers the interrogation.

Finally, someone who does not use holo sight on shotgun

Played against the Thot 3 stack before and as expected they play recruit.

I'm wondering what the hell poor kapkan did to deserve losing a toe.
