Don’t say finally grinded, those kills were really easy got them in a  few games
---
---
---
I agree too, u/Nokks-Swamp-Panties
---
Like a tachanka on 5:4 resolution on 16:9 monitor
---
Nooo.
---
It’s Cav’s...
---
Then they would have to make it that you get one pack every 45-50 wins or 90-100 losses which would equal the renown cost
---
It was by the door to the far left near this sort of broken vase
---
Mounted and ready ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I would just want something more to deal with trolls
---

---
Amount of people dicking around and trolling in ranked amazes me
---
I wanna try this with castle, and some ads’s
---
It’s 15 or 20 per skins so multiplie that by the number of skins and you got your number.

Haven’t played this game in a while but I’ll totally reinvest whenever this skin drops for my queeen

Remember me I upvoted it first on jah

2 health!! You're on your way to greatness, I'm sure :)

Yeah that shit expensive as fuck
---
Then perish

The frost trap joke took me a second, and then I got it and I'm dying. Thank you

---
Alpha packs came in Operation Health. One of the only good 3 things to be included.
---
Nice one. I would love to See drone skins in the game. I still want the kitty drone from rainbow is magic :D
---
Nice,thats a lot. I know man or atleast do your job and then die. Its fine by me.
---
I’m plat 2 now.
---
Why? This is what is definitely a ProTeam selection.
---
You probably kick the other teams ass!
---
So have chosen... DEATH!!!
---
I can just hear you just a screaming and then running away screaming
---
Dude, same! This is part of the reason why I modelled it so I could just come up with some cool looking skins
---
Actually you could jump massive ranks with just a 5man stack, even if all of you were garbage alone. Its funny tho, cuz being low rank equals skill but being higher rank doesnt really mean anything...
---
the only reason why this has so many upvotes is that it’s hilarious as hell and it’s a perfectly cut clip. Not 30 seconds long, bravo to you. ❤️
---
That was like r/perfectlycutscreams but better
---
vibe me comrade
---
Almost another 80 hours of Twitch on PS4 as well. Was like lvl 250 on that. But ya exactly, if you're gunna play a significant role then at least try to do your job lmao. It's always fun when hard breach runs in the open and dies to spawnpeek off the statt
---
Uhh... what...?
---
Hopefully they don't release it
---
Sorry for being ignorant, but doesn’t that just mean “hahahahah?” Surely that’s not a racial slur or hate speech? Again very sorry for being out of the loop.
---
I prefere Lion and I like him much, much more
---
Does anyone know what Cav’s elite ability change will be? She obviously doesn’t have a gadget or anything to change. 
---
I’m assuming she’s going to get a knife in her other hand while she’s sneaking.
---
In the seige community, one of the worst things people can do on house is reinforce kids to as it puts a flaming dumpster in even the best laid plans for the defenders and is (generally) very frowned uphon
---
What was the clip??
---
I don't enjoy ranked anywhere near as much as casual but I think you're right. I just have to get good at it and get used to it. Casual is now a festering cesspool of degenerates but for new players, they are forced to play casual for a while and it's just a bad time.
---
Both are good, it's all in preference
---
Idk about that either. I have wanted a new "Thatcher" option sense the game came out I've never been a fan of his load out. So for me getting a new option to deal with defenders gadgets would be nice.
---
28 seconds of holding hard angles and no action, I call that thrilling
---
perfect that’s all i need add me and we run some games later tn if ur down
---
Could be, the leak only said “Bolt Action Rifle”.
---
Wait why is that? Shes a 3 speed so I'm confused lmao
---
cock
---
And you husband
---
Her load out is very sub par and she doesn't feel right using anything other than a shotgun which is a very situational gun
---
She lacks utility. Recoil buffs gets more and more unnecessary as you climb the ranks where recoil control is mandatory and people already are well equipped to handle most recoils, and even the health buffs is not very beneficial since it is headshot meta.
---
She has frags, and a good 100 round, and that's about it. She's neither a full healer, nor that good a fragger because of how many counters she has. She has more counters than the the rest of the 4 in a team put together. However if you have a well coordinated team centred around Fragging, then her, ash/zofia, Thatcher/IQ combo can REALLY frag out, IFF the boosts are well timed.
---
I personally use the commando 9 due to more clip size and range but yeah it is mostly preference
---
Yyy
---
Whenever I'm shaking in this game I get at least 3 kills and when I'm calm and collected I miss full magazine a get hs from an enemy that I was able to for the last two seconds
---
Both work.
---
But 9 kills quicker, while the 10 has higher headshot percentage.
---
In your defense, your reaction time was very good once you realized it was bouncing back towards you.
---
I like how the moment you messed up you tried to run
---
yes this, i never use deployable shields, everyone prefires them anyway at least with barbed wire you can somewhat try to hide them in weird spots
---
Why did he try to kill u
---
They had black ice I didn’t
---
That has to be the dumbest reason ever
---
3 out of seven is actually good with your odds to get a heatgear,  there is a 1/4 chance for you to get a headgear , technically you only should have gotten 1.75 (which you cant so 2 head gears ) and you actually got an extra , they're loot packs and gambling tools you'll never get exactly what you want every time which does suck, but you actually got lucky with your odds and got an extra headgear my friend

She's really not as good as she seems. The res isnt all that helpful because it requires communication and quick action to really make a difference (neither of which are common), her recoil reduction can be okay of you're on console but on PC it's negligible and often hurts more than it helps because it can lead to over correction of recoil, your sound is deafened in a game where sound is key and your vision is tunneled by an obnoxious blue effect. If you want to play her, she can be a lot of fun but not nearly as competitively viable as she may seem.
---
so she left and you lost that means she didnt get the win, got a penalty for leaving, seems about fair to me. btw if you need wallhacks to win a round, i dont think you were going to win that match anyway, just saying
---
preference, but some slightly prefer the commando more
---
I don’t care because I watch videos about them first and if they suck I don’t buy them
---
That's fair enough.
---
** Vietnam flashbacks intensify **
---
NO
---
Yeah like warden he looks cool until i watched RussianBadgers video about him
---
because there's better operators to pick
---
...people who call this a good operation are delusional and must not have been playing during or frequently during it. It's not even good in retrospect, the game actively got worse and worse and 99% of its promised fixes got shipped during the next operation and broken during the operation after it.
---
You don't want Health 2.
---
Same...
---
Yeah, I guess that makes the most sense
---
Guns are already lasers right now. And this would just force you to stand still while the enemy headshots you.
---
For drone holes, there's usually a little lip that it gets caught on.
---
Birb op please
---
Why?  That word is not bad.  Neither is the D word

nah, it's gonna be a different game mode event

---
Bro I feels ya mine console became mentally not good right as Halloween event came out
---
sometimes I wish I didn't, but yeah
---
Except smoke's beauties are clearly compressed air tanks.
---
I got very lucky that game
---
I highly doubt they’ll ever add it, League is a team game but it’s rather “slow”. The macros in rainbow are mostly fast rotates or well prepared strats so they need a lot of communication to actively inform the other team mates of what’s going on. Unlike in rainbow we can just ping anything that goes on, the call outs in rainbow that you give your teammates are just Question Mark Pings in league.
---
Which is part of why I like league, I don’t like my voice and I’m even more afraid of talking to strangers. So online I don’t use my voice at all, occasionally in rainbow I get shit on and my team flames me over not communicating but that doesn’t happen in league. Because in league I can just type or ping them :D
---
That’s a lie op, you can’t link them
---
The colt635 is a SMG.
---
I loaded into a loosing game, was 1 v 5. They TK'd one of their teammates, so I walked in to say hello. I violated the truce and felt bad afterwords.

Fab Jäger is trying to save the wine for later can’t have the attackers destroying dah wine

Nvm, the video glitched for me and showed a still frame, I see it now

If you're 100 days in then you don't know why people make fun of bb
---
Worse than Apex's? Cause I've found Apex's to be the worst and Anthem's to be "relatively" nicer.
---
Ok, good thing it fixed
---
Mercy is just another weakness to be exploited.... you did good younge one. Soon you will accept the dark

If I was tanner I'd do Doc's invitational skin from last year

It's called "peeker's advantage". Watch Serenity video on it

Commando 9

Way to skinny. 
---
Not enough Tachanka under that uniform.
---
Well the level that retards choose to go is insane. Check it out. I guaranty that the first game you play you will be stacked by at least three people and security with arrest you at least once. /r/SS13
---
I still remember when I first started siege and didn't know if you held grenades for long enough they blew up in your hand
---
Oh so someone photoshopped toby on the stairs, I was wondering the whole time where the dancing on stairs scene was. Thanks for the clarification fren
---
Keep us updated on if he ever does. His accomplishment will break new ground in R6
---
I just switched last week, I don’t think there is
---
4 Black Guys and a small Asian woman........What could go wrong ?
---
Yeah it’s known
---
I've never seen a headshot kill from a terrorist in THUNT
---
The enemy can't kill you if you kill you
---
YESSSS! I'm gonna make a black ice nitro cell... Because why not, and then I might try to make a twitch drone
---
Imagine everyone else looking on his drone like wtf
---
I don't get angry when someone chooses BB but I feel that in certain situations, he is a very "cheap kill" operator. When you're rappelling a window or peaking a corner (basically any situation where only your head is visible), you have a **significant** advantage over the enemy since your extra head armor alleviates any worse reaction time and/or mechanical aim (I think Pengu chose BB in the start of his career for this reason). In higher ranked matches a lot of people instantly go for the head so the presence of a head shield is quite distasteful in the community. That said he's really damn slow with the shield on and it's just a video game at the end of the day.
---
yeet
---
Wouldn’t you say that making yourself invisible is only cosmetic?
---
Would you report them then?
---
I kinda forgot ranked was a thing
---
The changes are ok for Monty, but No clue why they decided to take the same route for blitz when in reality the casual community's problem with him was him running up and flashing. They said that they were looking at more melee counters. Why were they never implemented?
---
*Visible Confusion*
---
Sorry just putting it bluntly. K/D doesnt matter if you lose
---
Do you have all the original defenders
---
Okay thanks for the help kind samaritan ;)
---
I'd grab ying first so you have another attacker besides getting a kill with her candella on someone who's downed is one of the sweetest feelings you could get. Even better is shooting a downed op with mozzies pest but you gotta get hit the right spot or it'll just bounce off
---
I actually think it’ll replace her tablet. So when you do a logic bond or get on cams, she’ll look at her smart watch rather than her tablet
---
You're running out of storage.
---
Different game but I've been doing this in Modern Warfare a lot lately. The grenade sometimes veers to the right mid throw and it'll bounce off walls right back into my face.
---
Why is your legs bent outward
---
Except you can't buy alpha packs with money. They're a decent way to reward playing the game. Operation Health also completely rehauled lighting and removed cosmetics from the hotboxes. It did a lot of things, they just presented it poorly.
---
All I wanted was the doc uniform, but out of my packs i got the frost uniform + headgear, ela uniform, doc's headgear and i think thats about it.
---
No only tachanka and doc
---
Oh yes
---
Okay
---
On the in-game kd shown, casual doesn't affect it. It's only the stat tracker sites that show a consolidated kd.
---
That being said, your kd still counts even if you quit.
---
So it’s like a smoke on attack and a maverick that doesn’t have to risk exposing himself?
---
Don't need to imagine. I've been there before.
---
Nope they just came in with the heavy handed nerf and left it at that. Typical Ubi.
---
Thank you. That's all I needed.
---
So I was in a weird tunnel that had a slight incline. My body wasn't straight up and down
---
How long did it take to model? Im pretty sure its possible to rip the drone model straoght from the game
---
I got lesion body, Ela body, smoke head, and oozer charm. I could probably still get 2-3 more with the challenge and renown
---
You could do it considering frost is a girl xD
---
Yes

Another Portal Gun Buff!
---
Totally sympathize with the “All I need in life is this”. If only they added a trade feature or something...
---
Id be hyped. At least its a skin i could use on all operators rather than a pistol black ice for the pwm
---
A few hours, mostly because the wheels fucked up a few times. But I'm using it for a portfolio piece, I'm currently working on a breaching charge too and then afterwards I can hopefully do a nitro cell
---
They only don't have it because of shbz tbh
---
Wow u have luck
---
Its u/shbzfromtwitter
---
The literal first post in New is "ass hole", so I ain't surprised.
---
This in notifications was great
---
blackbeard, buck, capitao, hibana, jackal and ying. Also no operators come with the game anymore
---
That's probably due to the fact that the FMG already have a pro league skin, I think they didn't want to have "duplicates"
---
I got KapKan’s weapon’s skin which was lame and his headgear.
---
Frosts uniform and bandits uniform 
---
And got smokes headgear and uniform.
---
I was hoping for bandits headgear or frosts headgear but I’m happy for my smoke set
---
So far with renown and 1200 credits here’s what I have.
---
2 dumb charms
---
Bandit uniform and weapon skin
---
Doc headgear
---
Kapkan weapon skin and uniform
---
Ela uniform and headgear
---
Have a spoiler warning man...
---
Nah all the year 1s and base  come with the game now
---
Get the cheap ones first
---
stroke
---
Seems legit
---
C75 Auto is the best one
---
got the two free packs the first week, got a MP7 skin and a charm. grinded for a pack, got Bandits headgear, and was just like "fuck this shit I'm never going to get what I want at this rate" and just ended up buying it all since I really wanted Frost and Docs uniforms.
---
Why did I visit that sub. I knew it would be disturbing but I opened it anyways. I blame you.
---
Its a really good skin. Also I love the game so i figure 20 bucks every 3 months cant hurt.
---
I doubt they ever will
---
Ela easy. Her shotgun is broken
---
Ela is good because she has n OP shotgun you can spam with . Ying is decent but i don’t really like her .
---
It’s not really confirmed yet
---
I wish i was that drone
---
That sounds awful like I see that you put a lot of effort in to this but this just wouldn’t work
---
Don’t forget Mira

conversation after me and my buddy were tked
---
It’s referring to [raccoons](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/coon%27s_age) . So no it’s not. Not everything is about race. I have a pet coonhound too, is the breed of my dog inherently racist.
---
Yes. That is what it means. However I see many teams online, including randoms I play with who use the team voice chat, that turn it around as a dirty derogatory term towards them. Like you would say Wetback, Cracker, Blackie, the N word, sadly sexual slurs like queers, fags, etc. 
---
“These F’in jajas are pissing me off” etc. 
---
They’ll type similar stuff in the all chat directed towards the opposing Brazilian team too. But because it’s not recognized as a derogatory term, and  it probably will never be detected as such, it goes unnoticed. 
---
It’s been increasing more and more in the last year and I’m surprised I haven’t seen it talked about more on the forums.
---
holooo
---
fuckreddot
---
She probably would’ve got you if she took it slower though.
---
People like you seem to be completely unable to grasp the concept of probability. Just because it's harder on PC doesn't make it impossible.
---
I only know 1 person? Are you sure? Ok.
---
Oh... OK so you're just a loser. Cool.
---
Could just use a dispenser like mavericks torch that way you can freeze floors to make a running hazard or dont have to worry bout the electricity
---
It's likely but that's not what happened 🤸
---
Ranked now? Moving the goalposts are we?
---
Bud, go outside. If you are acting like a whingy little manchild over something like this then either you are obsessed with the game or you have bigger issues.
---
And of course people would find another term to use. That’s why you see creative uses of numbers to fill in key letters for hate speech now. Alt spellings that phonetically sound like the word but it’s spelled different. Etc. 
---
Again. It’s not that they would find another term. It’s the fact that that type of talk exists to begin with and isn’t being addressed.
---
I also had a flank drone my buddy was supposed to be watching you see it in the clip next to the table.
---
I see. I am a console peasant so I haven’t noticed this problem myself but yeah, definitely seems to be poor behaviour amongst some players.
---
Tricking should never had been a thing now with no counter is another thing entirely, just make it a one trick pony cant do it twice
---
Can we say oof
---
&gt; just made a simple joke
---
Oh yea, don't we all know this classic. 
---
*Knock knock*
---
*Who's there?*
---
*Fuck off cunt*
---
Fuuucking hilarious. Go outside kid.
---
You should be allowed to report people sabotaging games like tk instantly ,leaving right at the start, ect
---
Because bandit tricking already counters most of the hard breachers other than maverick, which isnt really a breacher, or hatches which kaid takes care of
---
For real.
---
I cant understand why devs turned Hereford Base to 1950s
---
Yes really
---
I reported him for griefing, no idea if that actually does anything or not tho
---
Where’s IQ when you need her!?
---
They have to remove because it’s not Halloween anymore what do you want ubi to do ?
---
No idea haven’t played in long enough
---
I play ps4 and pc. It’s not being a console peasant or anything. It’s been prominent for me in team chat there too. For what it’s worth, I’m in central US, so maybe the people are more racist and aggressive towards playing Brazilians here. But it’s both console and pc.
---
Yup that’s ranked what do you expect ?
---
Its just so fun and I love the theme / atmosphere of it
---
Keep it year round and rename it
---
That's how I joined that game. No one even left
---
Good job :)
---
Good news I didn't rank down
---
Oh yeah I just noticed that yeah that’s mad weird is that game still going on ?
---
You can literally kill someone with only like 3-4 lesions
---
Might have something to do with coon being a slur here, while also not being somewhere raccoons exist. I know it might be hard for you to comprehend, but the US isn't the only nation with access to the Internet.
---
He already tk'd someone
---
“I take it upon myself to police what people say because I’ve never done anything important in life and I think I’m doing something noble by defending black people”
---
i so would've killed myself*
---
Did you use the codes?
---
Yeah I think so too. Believe me, I understand that it’s not quite acceptable to say stuff like that, but drawing attention to it when nobody took offense to it in the first place is just looking for attention and an attempt to seem like a good person
---
STOP SPOTTING ON MY CAMS
---
Still talking about R6?
---
Jesus christ. You are actually a moron. Go out in public calling people racial slurs and see what happens you sad sack of shit. Will you bitch this hard to everyone who calls you a loser then?
---
There is no way someone this fucking stupid isn't just a troll.
---
Imagine thinking there was something wrong with calling out people for using racial slurs.

You should be happy that you only killed yourself
---
Red dot is a much small sized sight which limits your vision, but gives you more off sight screen view. IMO too much screen view in a sight that is supposed to focus on your target is bad. Compared to holo which gives you a lot more
---
The fact that you think I’d actually do something like that is laughable. I knew you’d do this, I cannot stand people like you, you try to police everything and everyone, obviously I know you can’t say shit like that to people who you aren’t cool with. This specifically illustrates the worlds need to be offended. You don’t care what people say, you just wanna look like a good person and feel good about yourself. Get over yourself

One of the first FPS I played, played it on sega dreamcast
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I almost like the strategy and team dynamics more. I remember one mission being a hostage extract from a swampy house or something, just looked it up, that was the final mission. I just loved looking at a blueprint and specifying team A was going to enter through the roof while Team B was going to clear from the ground up, once both teams have cleared the building exfil through the rear
---
He's a 17 year old brown SJW who thinks he's a tough guy.

Perfect idea!

I prefire that door whenever I spawn ruins and frequently get a pick. Even managed a 2k once

How do you set more than one flair?

Oh you'll be fine just get up dust yourse... Oh.  Sorry my stim pistol can't fix that one
---
Man shoulda pulled mine
---
&gt; Why the hell would he just randomly use a slur?
---
Because racists are stupid and illogical.
---
&gt; Does that mean saying “ I’m gonna kill you “ in a joking matter make you a murderer?
---
Thanks for confirming you're a troll. 
---
&gt; quoting me doesn’t make you sound smart.
---
Oh we can definitely agree on that.
---
Only got one left and it's get 5 kills with breach charges. I've had 4 for the past month still yet to get another

Press edit and then click any flair really, then you can type whatever you want

Drone skins would be cancer competitively, imagine not being able to find a drone becuse it blends in so well, we've seen it before with uniforms twice.
---
Not a broken game like siege
---
it's too late for operation health . Wait for next year instead
---
It's called a 3k fyi lmfao
---
To be fair, a lot of things in this game don't work the way they would in real life

bruh why aren't you on G2 yet wtf

Yeah I know that just it was done in one mag..It's not a massive issue really
---
Where do you find these kind of cousins? All the cousins I have is probably trying to kill me
---
you're very wrong there hahaha stop listening to meme accounts on insta. What us cod people complain about is the fact ur character will scream contact so the enemy can hear it and ur foot steps are very loud so u can be heard from across the map. Not the fast TTK but camping is in every cod and literally everyone complains about it. I have over 1000 hours in siege hit plat 2 and now i have 23 hours in cod and its nothing like a arcade siege but just a more realistic mw.  It has no destruction and no special operator abilities (basically what makes siege)

You can do it with one if their F key is broken.
---
I agreed with you until you said that. He's saying the game base's maturity level is low, so it isn't unlikely that a friend did this with him. You moron.
---
So the next atttacker will actually have a sniper rifle.
---
Looks awesome, specially on phase 2.
---
What software did you use?
---
Holy shit
---
She is Danish
---
I guess people on console don’t use headphones haha
---
Ahh. Well if he didn’t respond so confusingly I wouldn’t have roasted him. You moron
---
I can’t see it
---
I'd hardly say you roasted him considering he's in the right
---
Well hes obviously not trying you toxic tryhard
---
And you,re wallhacking you toxic hacker
---
And that guys controlled has a sticky button you toxic regular controller person
---
Ooh yea im good level 180 but i aint no fragger i bring the support roles and the gamesense i can predict most people moves and execute planes but in a 1v1 im useless i just simply dont have the best gunskill
---
Fun fact: this gets posted every 3 days.

You monster!

How many times can this be posted in November. Leave your guesses
---
Lol 1v1 trash talkers is pointless... Its fun I still do it 90% of the time they're either squeakers or cocky 14 yo. It's funny af hearing the reaction. My favourite one is when they say you sound whored. What bc I'm not allowed to take advantage of a major game mechanic. Lol still tho it does cause needless trouble it's just good to put a bitch down lol.
---
Did you just watch Pengu's stream/highlight video before posting this?
---
Because his points were EXACTLY the same.
---
I hope you only execute unfriendly planes.
---
Also yeah 180 too and enjoy using alternative methods to get kills and secure rounds quite a lot.  
---
Maestro wins fuel me.
---
that was dirty my dude
---
You are that one try hard guy who ruins the party :/
---
same with Nokk who's a trash operator that's why she's getting buffed in the future, to make her more fun and less mediocre
---
Oh, good to know. I'm not that up to date. It's still stupid though.
---
Ubisoft doesn't allow any kind of account switch from console to pc/ other console. You'll be fine tho, trust me.
---
Wait you call PMM not a laser but a pistol?
---
Im on pc and how would I do that excactly?

Is that the very first rainbow six?

So not funny didnt laugh

Once you found em double click on it and scroll down till you find "Mousesensitivitymultiplier" and set the number to 0.002230, this is the best I've found to make the control super easy.
---
The next step is to save it and go find the right sensitivity in game, my personal one is 70/70/83 (yes, it looks weird, but if you're an arm player try it, should be good), if that's good for you it's done, if not, just mess up with the sensitivity and go for t-hunt.
---
(Multiplier default is 0.02000 if you need to go back)
---
I like it bro, ignore him

Please go check my post its basically the same shit there

Yeah I can fix that in my splicing program, just set to ignore overlaps. I've seen a bunch of drones but none with the wheels like you did them and I love it.

Noice! How do you want me to send it and do you need a high poly version or would that work? And what file type? (It's currently saved as an FBX)
---
Obviously not enough.
---
Btw take a look at the top right corner, do you see those icons? That is why..
---
I count at max, 6. Just because your blind to your lack of recoil control doesnt mean you hit her every shot
---
Ye I was sort of thinking the one in game that the defenders have I just forgot the name so I presumed it was Russian
---
The 1050 and rx 580 are around the same price, I would recommend looking into to getting the Rx 580 card as well. Always have time to upgrade

Keyboard and mouse adapters have been around for 10 years or so on console, if something could be done don’t you think it would’ve been done already?

---
This looks great. I'm guessing gadget skins will be a part of the paid battle pass. Hope I'm wrong.
---
I think it has something to do with people leaving ranked games
---
The VZ Scorpion is not Russian tho, it is Czechoslovakian. But still, it was widely used by Russians, probably because of its multiple functions like its lightweight feature, medium-range combat by switching to semi-auto, and others. (I feel that this was unnecessary. Well, it actually is. Lol)

dragunov isnt a bolt action and glaz already has a dragunov svu (ots-03).
---
oh my god are you serious holy shit /u/real_james_bond007
---
As long as it is optional
---
I mean, it's only in casual so it's ok for me.
---
When you leave i think you should get a longer ban/cooldown than 30 min becuse people just decide i dont wanna play and leave becuse they know they can just play something else instead.
---
Nah knowledge is good, Frick it lets just gonna be him a pkm that's Russian
---
Idk about him as an operator but the idea of someone who can ping doks positions when she rings phone is very interesting.
---
That's fair
---
At least it wasn't ranked.
---
Maybe so but I've never failed to get a kill while running this tactic
---
In that case why not just leave the light on and make the rest of the drone transparent. That way you can tell players to shoot drones by spotting about 2% of its surface area and stop complaining.
---
Alibi her smg is good and watch a vid on how to use her properly and she can be like amazing

---
Go to Ubisoft launcher and check out the games under Ubisoft+
---
Personally I'd say 7:1 surround is a gimick that isn't necessary. A good pair of headphones, sennheiser for example, maybe Bose, will do better than 7:1 with better sound quality, the game already has built in surround sound, though the sound at the moment is a bit wack
---
Use her shield
---
I don't know want you mean by "tactic" I was just pointing out how to gave way for them to kill the injured Jager. And also how you inadvertently blocked his way when he was escaping

---
Where did the first gu go?
---
Something about the eyes/face seems off
---
Yeah but when you hear footsteps of an armor 3 lets say, its hard (almost impossible) to know which direction it is from - because you heard the same sound of footsteps in both ears; you only knew someone was around you, not which direction. Before i used my Arctis 5 (with 7.1 surround audio) i was basically deaf when playing the game - i primarly used cameras and roaming wasnt even an option, but now with 7.1 surround audio i got a LOT better.
---
Yeah, the time is: as fast as possible at the best quality I can
---
I'm loving the irony
---
Same :)
---
True my dude :)
---
The yokai would easily have that as a skin... Someone spam Ubisoft
---
The only problem with that outfit is that you lose any advantage given by having a dark outfit in a dark corner...
---
I'm still super jealous though.
---
I jumped a little, that's terrifying
---
I love how you kept bobbing up and down as you casually moved away after planting the Claymore.
---
Same :( but i think if I play this again, i might be good
---
Gotta get those points for destroying a drone somehow

 Sounds like u/eklim987 is someones FBI agent.

---
Im trying to play ranked, but i'm new
---
I’ll try this next time
---
Yea!! Thats why i became hooked with it

Damnn, but nice try tho!!

You can still see and fight them in situations - a good example is IQ's one.

I will try :)

Lmao the only person that liked them.

Tell me the secret too!

"Why would you ever scrimmage your offensive line against your defensive line bro, they'll never play each other in a real game"

that was me last year, got valk full halloween costume
---
Me too and I bought like 5 extra packs, fuck
---
Dang man I just kept getting different pieces to each set and I bought most of them
---
Broken dogs
---
Friend deployed
---
I got Doc Full set from the 2 challenges, then i bought 5 more (2 with Credits and 3 with money) Which i got
---
\-Ela Uniform
---
\-Lesion Headgear
---
\-Frost Uniform
---
\-Mr.Smiley charm
---
\-Bandit uniform
---
When your key is broken you can’t ucking type respects
---
And here is my camera, always being shoot down by the enemy before I tase them
---
What is there to argue about?
---
honestly I would suggest destiny 2, its free rn and has a lot of grinding and rng
---
Ok deutsher
---
Ahh yes, the secret map you get when you look at the floor and press G
---
*sad last doot*
---
Getting charms is better than getting half a set!
---
Why?
---
Cav just said 😐
---
Thanks any ops that go well with her ?
---
Lol thanks
---
I'll run down my loot kapkan head gear first try ela's gun skin and frosts body gear
---
This was a while back, I'm gold now. I used to be shit. I'm also level 86
---
vibe check
---
That first kill you got made me fail No Nut November.#BOSGACOG
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
Ok thanks any ops that go well with her ? , also any maps she does better on ?
---
Isnt there only one challenge?
---
match point and enemy didn't have a single point, I don't think that's it
---
When 2 people in a squad get a tk warning the entire squad gets it
---
There was 2
---
You look GODLY
---
Uh, I’ve had some solid coordination with her and Lesion, Ela, and Mira.  And maps where you can pinch attackers and force them to attack from a certain direction where she can meet them and have a teammate behind her or flank from the other side are where she does best.
---
Destiny 2 its free
---
When will this weeb circlejerk trend end?! Its so fucking annoying!
---
NOBODY expects the outside stairmat
---
What about his weapon skin?
---
I really wanted the smoke headgear but I got the full doc set:|
---
lol ty
---
Shh... im currently resting my brain and i cant let it get angry i forgot bout it
---
Yeah bro, makes the game difficult to play but still it is fun
---
Console is wild man
---
Me too bro...  Real r/bruhmoment
---
I have elas full spook set and had a legendary weapon skin back when i started the game.
---
To me it looked like 1 chest shot and 1 shot above his left ear that would have hit his head if he wasn't leaning. I could be wrong
---
Yeaa, some cartridges will need you to blow as hard as you can and atill wont play
---
Well I got docs uniform, which is just a white uniform with blood splatters on it, so it goes with a lot of headgears
---
I mainly just wanted the Kapkan headgear, and I got lucky and pulled it in a pack I bought with renown.  But that Bandit outfit is pretty tight, no lie
---
Just cuz i main her doesn't mean that she's good, it means i just use her for most of my matches cuz in my opinions she's universally good
---
He has a YouTube channel that has a bunch of tips and tricks
---
But you spray or at least burst a door and don’t one tap it
---
I got frost outfit and a goddamn charm
---
Why do you disagree?
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior: Aim?
---
Shotguns
---
The difference between lesion’s traps and kapkan’s is that kapkan’s traps deal half your HP while lesion’s deal like 5 or 10 damage. Having a cloaked trap that takes half your health would be way too powerful
---
Lucky you i got a charm that looks like a ballsack with a face and a p90 camo i'll never use
---
Should be free. Especially the first one. If it's not that's nuts.
---
ive had one taps, but thats what im saying, ive had multiple bursts or sprays where the first bullet i shot was a hs.
---
They said it could not be done
---
lol this was months ago when i first picked up rainbow, had a really shitty sensitivity setup too for my controller.
---
honestly I'm not a fan of the head, it makes him look like blackbeard.
---
The uniform's good tho, it goes really well with the leather bondage gear helmet he has.
---
I had a fuckton of renowned saved up and I had to use all of it to get Kapkan's full set.
---
I have never agreed with something more in my life.
---
Might come in 5-10 years depending how Siege turns out in the future
---
I see
---
U missed one thing ,  acog on 2speed defender (goyo) is on semi auto shotgun-dmr , witch kapkan dont have and wont have .
---
i always pray to him, spray and pray at least.
---
But they said that they might run r6s to Year 10, I don't think it is likely, or at least not likely in the coming few years. We have R6 Quarantine coming tho
---
inbefore u have camouflage drones after skins
---
Yeah I got the Doc headgear and I wouldn't be too disapointed if I didn't get the full set. Getting half the lesion set would be terrible though, even if it was the headgear.
---
I got full set for Frost and doc (no weapons) bought 2 packs for renown and got 2 in the challenges. Still one free to go, hoping for Kaplan or smoke headgear
---
Just don’t give him acog it’s already the best gun on defense with the Alda.
---
God no
---
Fucking hell where’s the 9 tailed fox when you need em?
---
Dont we all
---
I was lucky enough to get the *SUCC*. Didn’t get the uniform, but I got the uniform during rainbow is magic, so it makes a disgusting combo.
---
Wish I played people this bad lol
---
I got skinsuit Ela, and then charms
---
I think no, but im not sure
---
Its the US president plane in Heathrow, United Kingdom. Play situations, it explains a bit
---
People still play this?
---
I mean Pengu/ doki have comparable stats on their low lvl smurfs
---
Yeah Im curious as to how that will turn out.
---
Good point
---
What hitbox?
---
I got smokes headgear and uniform and only bought one pack with renown
---
I hate myself for being that honest but I started the game again like 5 min ago
---
But tbh this is probably the only shooter that gives you this rewarding moment when you come out on top of a fight because you know you played that well. Sometimes I hate it sometimes I love it. Thanks to everyone tho who had a discussion with me. I always love seeing the other side

All the top players on console just dos if they're about to lose and have 300-0 records.
---
Its just  the reality of r6 community. Devs have tried their best to contain it but there’s not much you can do. I would recommend finding a designated squad that you can play with.
---
That wasn't a seasonal skin, per se. That was an event skin. Those will always be more limited than standard skins.
---
Zoomed destruction, yes.
---
Thanks!
---
Where would they be
---
Jager shouldn't be nerfed imo. To lower his pick rate, ubi simply need to add an alternative to him. One of the main reasons why Jager is picked so much is because he's the only defender who deals with grenades
---
Why is every one picking bb he's shit
---
Were those guys even communicating with each other?
---
If u need anyone to play with n help u with tips msg me if u want
---
Its fun LOL sure for a new player
---
Yeah. Thanks. likewise.
---
He's a classic case of "I'mma prove to be a keyboard warrior and then delete so I can come back and be the same idiot".
---
My God......were none of these dudes schooled?
---
The thing is . Jager has a very unique ability which is blocking grenades . No other defender has it . Therefore his pickrate is through the roof
---
Got frost headgear from first pack
---
there may have been a miscommunication
---
He was talking about headshots with guns.
---
Twitch's dmg is fixed.
---
Just because an operator is picked a lot doesn't mean they need to be nerfed
---
Really better join to any team or make one with friends/randoms from group
---
Got the entire Doc set in the free pack and the easy win thirteen rounds challenge. Haven't played the gamemode since.
---
He 100% does not need a weapon nerf, as you just said,his weapon is good and balanced. 
---
He's picked alot because of his gadget, there isn't many counters to it, besides Thatcher, outside of him his ADS is a very good counter to alot of operators.
---
The issue is that there isn't something like him, an alternative is needed, not a nerf.
---
As a new player, you’ll die to everything so complaining about spawn peeking is like complaining about every other thing you die to. It’s just another layer you have to learn, because it’s part of the game
---
the legend himself arrives
---
Dropshotting was bad enough
---
Maybe Lesion, his gu mines can slow down the attackers so that Clash can make some extra damage. Or Jäger with barbed wire, he has a strong weapon and wires slow down enemies too
---
If both teams die, the game is at a stalemate and since defense has the objectives at the beginning of the game, everyone being dead means the defenders ended in control of the objective, so they'd technically win
---
I did the same thing with lesion
---
*T H I C K*
---
I literally miss it . Especially one tapping the spawn peekers
---
Not everyone can find a 5 stack

But yet you were just getting into an argument over someone's choice of main? I think you're the salty one here.
---
Hi zander
---
Not everyone can find the time to stay in a ranked or casual game. 
---
Things happen that is beyond their control.
---
Let it be internet, electricity, family related emergency or rage quit / troll.  
---
Cant tar everyone with the same brush.
---
I'm sorry, mate whole you have a point that rainbow six is skirts the line of reality and science fiction. What your purposing is even against the fundamental laws of reality. While things like holograms and tracking footprints is ultra science fiction. A MAGNET DISRUPTING A CHEMICAL REACTION IS DOWN RIGHT IDIOTIC. that magnet would have to be powerful enough to overcome CELLULAR BONDS. And any magnet that strong would literally warp the space around it causing it to collapse in on its self as a God damn black hole. While rainbow six likes to dance on the line of reality and science fiction I can assure you that something at goes against the laws of physics is not gonna happen.
---
Gridlock is not shit she is very useful
---
Why nerf people when they could rework or buff the lower picked ops to make them more attractive to use
---
neck is part of head, tell me how you can survive if you got shot in the neck
---
Oh Hell No. Didnt you post this a day ago as well?
---
Very funny, laughed hard
---
Ranked on console is ridden woth MnK majority of them are plat at least ive seen. Havent seen many diamonds.
---
One unoriginal I did a Vigil cosplay thing a couple of weeks ago and two how is you phone floating
---
I don’t ever seem to run into any
---
I got two weapon skins, not complaining (bandit, lesion)
---
Get the attackers because the ones you don’t have are the fun ones
---
Real questions right here. I would say bronze as a bronze because if your a bronze you at least expect bronze teammates, wear when you plat it’s really hard when you get silvers on your team
---
Shoot gadgets, dont worry about hitting people.
---
Same , and , I still have 2018 ectoplasm skin , so it makes a perfect set
---
But that’s....Dokkebi?
---
I wanted frosts uniform more but I got lesions head and Ella’s skin gun
---
Gotta tell you my accuracy is 500% worse when a twitch is about to shoot my mira canisters.
---
If the defuser is planted and the game ties, the Attackers now hold objective and win.
---
Basically if a tie happens, the team needing to act loses.
---
Black ice breaching chargz next?
---
I did that with the doc items!
---
Well, at least you added the touch of the cell phone in the air so ima give it to you
---
It's the same image
---
Good on ya for winning nonetheless
---
Hans get die flammenwerfer
---
dang, u one lucky gamer,
---
i litteraly got the lesion body and the frost headgear and im still griding for some more packs,
---
cuz i really badly want that kapkan skin. and of course the SUCC
---
I would go for echo vigil and zofia but it’s really just whoever you want to play with
---
9/10 for the costume. 11/10 for the trap pun
---
Oh my bad dude, meant no offence, just see a lot of people don’t know about.
---
I mean more in a perfect scenario plats vs plays bronze vs bronze
---
Whoa nice job :)
---
best thing to do is get a team that you can consistently play with. being comfortable with your teammates and knowing their play style helps a lot. another thing that will help you improve personally is playing a game or two of t-hunt to practice / warm up your aim. i know you didn't mention anything about aim, but if you have any problems aiming even after practicing on t-hunt consistently, then maybe try a different sensitivity. as for game sense, just remember to constantly drone while attacking, and try to keep a mental map of where the attackers are while defending. also idk if this will help, but i always watch a maciejay / skittlz / beulo youtube video before i play ranked. the video kinda gets me hyped up and i pick up some of their strategies. hope this helps
---
I opened 4 packs, got nothing but charms
---
yeah i want Slides to the game. Makes the playground shift more fun
---
I think thats called an impact nade
---
The guy that got shot probably thought that too
---
You one lucky mutha fucka
---
I got Ella's fullest off my first two packs..
---
I only wanted Lesion's. So I'm pretty dissapointed.
---
Two packs. Frost and Lesion headgears. Casual flex 😎
---
I would suggest sledge and mute as beginning ops until you get the feel of everything
---
Trade for a first day full Ella outfit?
---
So does the match count or could you just bitch at ubi and hope they'll remove the match? I've had 3v5 games right from the start but this would make me have a aneursym
---
Damn right
---
Thanks bro, I will definitely keep that in mind and look up those people.
---
In this scenario, niether team is “needing to act” as they can both win by killing eachother. This means the lose goes to whoever is killed first, which in this case was op.
---
Yes indeed
---
Correction: choose edit, not custom. Pick whatever and the option to type your own should come up. The ela faces in mine are coded as :ela chibi: and each icon has their own code
---
Yeah, this event gave me a crippling gambling addiction.
---
Is this the same idiot that made that video about hiw WW2 games should punish anyone that play nazis in multiplayer?
---
Zanderrrrrrrrrrr
---
thank you good sirrr
---
Maaaaybe... I was gonna make a nitro cell next
---
A black ice nitro cell? It's also a good idea
---
All good. No offense taken
---
Actually, the Attackers "need to act". If they don't, they lose by timing out. I've played plenty of games where this happens both with the bomb timer active and with the defuser timer active.
---
Frost
---
Good, you completely profiled his parents too.
---
Yeah but that is just creative mine is just fan art

---
Outlandish.
---
Yes.
---
Thank God these are just for fun.
---
Me too! But with Ela
---
In cas or ranked
---
nice
---
Used to be mp7 but I do fine with reflex.
---
Stop echoing them
---
18 pixels which are his hitbox his head is 20 pixels but only those 18 matter
---
would be insane when they managed to get the garage reflection on his head
---
(no idea how it would look or how you can make it)
---
Gotcha, didn’t count for myself lol.
---
What about a Black Ice stim pistol to spawnpeek with
---
First 40 secs is sh*t gets better (funny if u like this sorta thing) later
---
Its the same thing you dolt.
---
Newcomer and casual... I may sound sweaty but I am not.
---
Oporation SUCC I love the smonk head gear
---
In cas there’s really nothing you can do as people just don’t care about cas very much :/
---
I don't echo them
---
Imo using twitch on default cameras in prep phase is a waste + big brain enemies could spot destroyed cams and be more aware of twitch drone.
---
I'm at the liberty to decide what to play in a game I paid my own money for.
---
So, yeah, if I want to play, say, lion while y'all play recruit, I'll do it.
---
Just leaving it out there in case there's a serious discussion over this.
---
Then uninstall
---
Haha i absolutely love that in 2019, 4 years after the game's release, one of the most requested features to make hands penetratable to avoid them blocking headshots, still hasn't been added to the game smh
---
Instead of doing that just upgrade your PC, why spend (Im assuming) $300+ on a PS4Pro (which FYI doesent gain any advantage on Siege over a regular PS4) rather than just upgrading your GPU/Ram?
---
Tfw no Rook 😞
---
Really didn't think of it. I hope it solves the problem though...
---
Happened to me and my friend last night on our 10th ranked match. 3 v 5 right from the start
---
yes you killing yourself counts in the death stats
---
&gt;Shoulder and neck, didn't hit head. Also they fixed her hitboxes ages ago
---
Neck = headshot. The fact taht you still cant penetrate hands is mind boggling
---
:(
---
It is a balanced and fun gamemode it isn’t sided it is fine
---
I did too but I already had his elite so I don’t know which to use
---
Pretty much.
---
Because they saw it already and you were gunna get shot anyways?
---
That's exactly what happened in the OP click. He got seen and went for the damage since the drone was gunna get shot anyways.
---
Also, shooting people with the taser is a good way to distract someone who is watching a corner so your teammate can run out and kill them
---
Not new
---
&gt;false neck counts as head
---
I love when I win solitaire in Siege
---
Have you ever looked on cams in prep phase? Also, no. It's not a waste depending on the map and spot that cam gone might deny alot of intel. Ofcourse you could just shoot it but that cam gone will enable you to focus on shooting the enemy. And if you dont fire the gun to shoot a camera, the enemy cant hear the shot, so they dont know where you are
---
A long ass series of unfortunate events
---
P10 is clash Elias is rg15
---
Now we just have to wait till they allow us to buy them directly
---
Bro I need to know what language that is
---
Time does not equal experience or skill
---
I always get matched into article five. Not the normal one
---
I am not telling you to kill your team but if they are all dead no one could destroy your drone so......
---
^mandatory ^/s
---
How do you get matched into article 5 without picking article 5?
---
And pull out an L85 and act like thatcher and everyones lazer sights
---
Lmao I got like 5 headgears and nothing else
---
So?
---
But i was talking about the commenter, not the clip. And if we are talking clip, i get why ypu would zap in this case. Twitch very likely knew echo was low.
---
I dont think youve ever met any 8 year old that ever plays any first person shooter. They are all like this, blind, deaf, and downright idiotic sometimes.
---
The moron at the end is a nice touch. Only reason to attack someone personally in an argument is when youve already lost and have nothing else to say.
---
I hope you know the win percentage number it spits out only counts your teams rank vs the enemies rank and not peoples actual skill like k/d for instance. the rank system is already matching you with people within the same rank so doing this is useless
---
thank you for coming to my tedtalk
---
That is pretty cool.. alright but just this once
---
Why would I look at it from a realistic prespective? If you do, you are also pushing for the entire gamemode to be changed. It would mean attackers would always have to plant the bomb, even if there is no defenders left. This would ruin a lot of the intensity in last second clutches. I dont see how it would be at all good for the game.
---
The thing that separates ranks is awareness. Lower ranks have lower awareness for some things. Thats pretty much a fact. I’m not saying anyone lower than gold is broke dumbass
---
Thanks I'll consider it. I'll be getting a job soon so I'll save up
---
Shit I didnt know he died but he sold the rights to his name for money so I'm sure he's chilling in military heaven or Valhalla as an honorary warrior. I say honorary because I'm not sure if he was actually in the military but his book Splinter Cell was badass.
---
I was saying how I personally look at cams during prep phase.
---
They really need to sue websites that sell hacks. Or, at least shut down their websites.
---
I recently posted several buff ideas that wont break the game, I will have to find it
---
do people not use the smg11 on the sas operators or is this an old clip?
---
They changed it so wherever dies first loses even if you trade
---
If this where to be included in the game it would be op AF
---
*whoever
---
Castle Buff idea: if his barricade is placed on a door, drones cannot go underneath it only the yokai can. Another idea is to make the barricades foldable where you can fold the top of the barricade down. The foldable barricade will act as a shield in a doorway or window, but once its folded it cannot be undone. Another idea is to improve the strength of the barricade
---
They have it in custom games and t-Hunt I believe
---
Thanks!!
---
That was from last year
---
You’re prob an mnk that I would love to 1v1 n throw in the dirt
---
Tnx dude good tips, my sens is like Aust1n. And we can play some casual or ranked togheter if you want.
---
Get better at the game. There’s not much else you can say about that. It isn’t a “glitch” that you cant get a higher rank, it’s just yourself. You have a 0.80 kd, which is slightly below average. All I can say is practice.
---
i spent 50€ like a degenerate
---
Yeah thats fine, i really just dont get what you get out of knowing they have a twitch?
---
Edit: other than the fact that you now know of tge drones being there
---
Nah, this is last night. To be honest I so rarely switch to my secondary, I don't even think about it. The pistol was just what I had equiped.
---
I hate geting uniforms instead of helmets thats is all i get

What map is this?
---
So im happy for you
---
Free intel for Mira, bandit, lesion, mute, etc.
---
In that case it seems they changed it sadly to "prevent" you from running Thunt in 60 FPS
---
Tnx dude❤️
---
They have god mode in a game, but they will all die in real life, sad people
---
the drone/yokai thing could be pretty useful, but what about mozzie?
---
Ok
---
I wasn’t joking about racism in saying my name is a joke
---
That's not what this subreddit is for bud
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
My friends always say that jewbisoft is saving these positive changes for Siege 2. But yeah fuck mouse and keyboard go play PC if ur not gonna use controller
---
Holy god that's perfect.
---
Hahahah holy fuck
---
Finnish lol
---
Hey bud, shut the hell up, does anyone seem to care other than you, no so unless u wanna 2v2 don’t waste my damn time
---
mp7, sonetimes vector 45 acp, and the smg11
---
I am mnk but on Pc....
---
Crossplay should only be implemented on consoles, i don't want to play vs PC gamers that have FoV, FPS and many more advantages
---
It's been like this for a bit already, don't remember the exact update, but it's been a season or two. People are downvoting because you're wrong, it's nothing to feel bad about, nothing personal. That being said I think you deserved to be brought up to speed by any &amp; all who downvoted you, since you said you didn't understand the point of the video and weren't trying to be a total smartass or anything. Cheers!
---
Oof that hurt
---
It looks like you’ve kidnapped Tachanka, locked im in your trunk and suddenly took a picture picture of him when you reached the river
---
Honestly I cheated past it, only way I could get to other levels. Thank goodness I can get to bronze 3 now.
---
Map sucked
---
Great man, it was like free elo
---
Tachanka says: “Wearing your seatbelt is cool and its the law. Do it or i’ll mow you down both my DP-28.”
---
If you switch up a couple things it’s also a Nokk costume. Good job
---
If a lesion knows there is twitch he wont throw his GU mines during prep fase and mute would place his jammers in corners so it cant be taken down by twitch. Etc. Nothing big.
---
Hot.
---
suppressed deagle  or the meusoc
---
Wrong subreddit buddy
---
OMG!
---
That's the biz. We out here spawnpeeking with the stim pistol
---
But no one checks cams that early in prep phase
---
Sounds like you take the game way too seriously. Maybe just take a few weeks/months off.
---
That's literally what they need to do to fix it, so annoying
---

Real pc players use controllers.
---
I too, joined the bandwagon.
---
What’s the subreddit then? Why the fuck is everyone using bud, just pisses everyone off
---
They said it could not be done.
---
I will, but I’m just thinking cause you guys look very red
---
Pretty creative, took me like a minute to get the joke
---
ok lets look at the leavers this way: if you never leave, that leaves 9 others that can possibly leave, now since you never leave that means that only 4 of those 9 possible leavers can be in your team what this ultimately means is that the enemy team will have more leavers than your team and thus you will still be able to rank up even if every single game had 1 person leaving :)
---
What was that jiggling lol 
---
Nvm in a idiot realized right after I commented
---
Yeah, I also hope they have a big sign on their back, saying "Shoot Me"(!)
---
It will probably be an elite skin if they ever get one.
---
I'm sorry but does jager have an ACOG
---
The new Xbox will be backwards compatible with Xbox one, meaning that queue times won’t go down even if people buy the new Xbox.
---
Also bare in mind that you have these concerns when the game has been out for push on 5 years. I think we’re good on player count, Xbox is still plenty popular in terms of player count.
---
i only got dumb charms just like every other event since Chimera
---
So true. I would say something like “if you feel like looking away, just hold the angle for a few extra seconds than you want to” but then that’s when the enemy will come. You can’t win with this strategy
---
Why are you quitting?
---
Why are you so concerned about your K/D ratio?
---
I do this all the time, recruit snake strat best strat
---
If Ubisoft’s adds him I’ll 100% start playing again
---
Hacker cant get first?
---
Big bruh
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
What's it gonna take to get biker cav from wildlands into this game!?
---
Just a lil tip so stuff like that won't happen anymore, keep your sight on the angle you are looking at then just move your body away. So like move while aiming, it has saved me several times already
---
Fun fact: when you shoot next to their head it doesn't count as a headshot. Counterintuitive right?
---
One of these things is not like the other
---
Haha I got charms

I almost have all i wanted, full ela full bandit and other stuff from smoke, the strange thing is on my payed account i get legendarys almost always and on the second account i got every even just the charms, really suspicious, ubis working with black magic apperantly.
---
At best they would not pull out the Gus, so it would be 100 damage at best, 40 damage at worst
---
We didn’t fully catch on until the third round on attack because we had never seen this type of thing until then, and in round three we tried to rush with her but be a bit behind to get a free plant and then stop them from getting a free disable. We did TK him on defense just in case he would try something.
---
I got the Blackwood skin for 9x19vsn
---
I thought that was obvious
---
Nah you can post memes, it’s not in the rules but they got to be related to siege :)
---
Siege captured in one clip.
---
Something dokkabi and mozzie  execept on defnese 3 speed and mess up thatchers emps

Do you mean renown or R6 credits
---
I’m going to be honest, I get roughly 90 FPS on T-hunt on my PS4 with VSync turned off. So 30 FPS is staggeringly low with Vsync being off.
---
Wondering what Simon riley was doing there.
---
Ok you have a point there but so do why should we let leavers of with a 30mim cooldown when they leave a ranked before even the ban phase has ended or becuse the other team has won 2 rounds in a row becuse that is what happens this week i have had around 5 games where no one left in my team i have lost 10rankups in a row becuse of this. I think they should atleast get 1h. We can look at Counter strikes cooldown system If you leave one match 30 min if you do it again 2h then 24h then 7 days if rainbow would have a system similar like that we would have not as many leavers
---
The reason I’m quitting is I don’t have time for anymore I have to deal with a whole bunch of other stuff right now but thanks for asking
---
am i the only one, who thinks, that bandit looks like a road construction worker in that uniform?
