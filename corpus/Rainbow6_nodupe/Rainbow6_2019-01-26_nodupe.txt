i hope recruit gets removed. it‚Äôs never viable to have recruit over an actual operator. 
---
---
---
Lol....
---
About time.
---
FUCK YEA. 
---
[removed]
---
lets go
---
yes , sidewinder looks like a remix version of his default uniform basically it change the vest and jacket 
---
thank you guys cuz this is super annoying
---
thank you
---
Woohoo!!!
---
:‚Äù)
---
HAHA SO RANDOM BAN TACHANKA 
---

---
fucking idiot faggots
---
Noice
---
Crouch spam removal: yes
---
Lean ‚Äúspam‚Äù removal: no
---
Wow,This is a big step jopefully not far from now.
---
Thank you Ubi, very cool!
---
Can't wait to hear what you're gonna come up with, glad this is being addressed! 
---
Why is this here
---
flair: official
---
Sweet, now what about mouse and keyboard use on console?
---
it‚Äôs really good to hear from you guys on issues affecting the game, and shows that you do listen to the community. keep up the good work
---
No way to just buy the ones I want.
---
Yusssss!
---
Thank you so much! This has become increasingly annoying.
---
YES. I hope people don‚Äôt resort to probe spamming lolll
---
A crouch and lean cool down (similar to CS:GO) would be a good idea.
---
I got a collection pack but every time i try to open it, it says expired
---
Finally ill get to Diamond!
---
This Update will be the best Update after removing the dropshots.
---
knowing Ubisoft, this update will come somewhere in year 7.
---
I thought this was fan made a few hours ago because of how silly it looked. I was surprised when I logged in.
---
q e c q e c
---
Can you address issues with being kicked for no goddamn reason and losing all the renown you wouldve gained? this is really fucking annoying.
---
This fix can‚Äôt come soon enough! Ranked is full of people lean and crouch spamming, some with macros. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 
---
Clash
---
#no further bruv 
---
I've got almost 240 alpha packs hoarded... never open any and spend all my renown on more lol.
---
Remove any movement. Maybe remove sprinting...
---
I think u/ItsEpi mentioned that it uses casual ranks, but I might be mistaken. 
---
Yall will be complaining till you try and crouch and the game doesn‚Äôt let you
---
A lot of monitors are being smashed right now 
---
Thanks. This is amazing news
---
What he said.

THANK YOU FOR LISTENING

Good to hear. In all honesty you could have adressed this a little earlier. I think all of us understand this is a complex game and implementing changes takes time. But at least let us know you're working on it.

Anyway, good news. 
---
Alright guys, get a head start on this. What‚Äôs the next ‚Äúgame ruining‚Äù thing we‚Äôll whine relentlessly about ‚ÄúUbi not fixing‚Äù?
---
That's great to hear. Thank you for your hard work. Looking forward to a good solution.
---
 The new game mode event and now this. I love you Ubi!
---
He'll Yah scew crouch spammers
---
oh yeah yeah
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Lucky 
---
Name a more iconic duo
---
The crouching I agree with but I hope the leaning update doesn't effect a good player's ability to be able to flick or lean into a shot.
---
Don't worry, I understood... the second time..
---
thank you 
---
God bless 
---
This. This is all that was needed. SOME COMMUNICATION. We weren't expecting a solution straight away, we just wanted some acknowledgement that Ubi saw this as a problem as well. So thank you for the update, and thank you for looking into this.
---
I hate all the pussies on Reddit who onto complain about people who are better then them and they can‚Äôt be good like them 
---
NICE DROP SHOT KID ü§ß
---
No, you‚Äôre not getting downvoted for having a different opinion. You‚Äôre getting downvoted because you fail to understand the problem people in this thread are trying to address and instead focus on an issue that‚Äôs completely different. Your victim complex is also now a second reason to downvote you.
---
I never knew I could be so erect
---
Ok, THIS is toxic
---
Get_flanked has a video on this, it would probably be helpful.
---
Agreed lean spams whatever but eh I'll take what I can get 
---
Both yes, deal with it. 
---
Please fix before the Invitationals
---
Thats great news.. thank you guys ..
---
Make SIEGE great again. Thanks to the whole Rainbow Six SIEGE team.
---
About time &lt;3
---
Hopefully you guys cant get it sorted before the invi's
---
would REALLY REALLY suck if the biggest siege event is played on this patch :(
---
You can literally avoid bullets by doing this because of hit-scan. Hope it gets dealt with soon.
---
Just return the lean system to how it was before. You couldn't instantly switch between left and right, youd always have to go back to a neutral position first, then hit Q or E again.
---
Plz no
---
YES

---
It's ranked rules xD
---
complete lies regarding 'PL' rules
---
nothing here is from PL except pick n bans
---
And one of the worst animations for an Elite skin.
---
You'd think someone as popular as Ash would get something cool, but I'll definitely take this uniform. 
---
Plus we can mix and match the normal uniforms unlike the Elite ones. 
---
It has been mentioned on the Twitter page that there is a good chance pick and ban will be coming to ranked.
---
Thank you! 
---
Honestly, coming from me, it's a shot in the dark
---
It's meant to be "competitive rules"
---
not an upgraded casual
---
Console mouse and keyboard needs to be looked into also.
---
What in the fuck is dokk wearing lmaoo ? 
---
Except lean spamming breaks the hit boxes. 
---
Honestly having the pro league rules permanently would really help me playing the game better and enjoy it more.
---
How?
---
It's much easier to plan ahead and have a mental structure of stuff when you can know in advance what you can expect.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Ventilation 
---
That‚Äôs crazy I‚Äôve never had it to that extent but I feel for you bro. This Reddit community is cool but the gaming community is trash and toxic as hell 
---
Its not even that long her mouth just is fukn HUGE
---
Smoke
---
No recoil
---
I was playing smoke though so I can‚Äôt m8 sorry
---
R/wooosh. Community pranked you about lean/ crouch spamming.
---
Can you not take 2 years to actually implement the fix this time around?
---
Maps allowed in pro league... and I think pick/ban as well. Basically proleague playlist. 
---
I just filled out an emailed survey a few hours ago where I pointed out that one thing I thought was lacking from the dev team was good communication.  This is what I want for every problem in Siege.  Maybe you don't have a fix, maybe you don't even have an idea for a fix, but at least you confirm that you are aware of the problem.
---
Honestly even if the dev team came in here and said we know users think it's a problem but we don't see any real reason to fix it right now I would be happier than with nothing.
---
Basically what I'm saying is great job, keep up the great communication and I'm excited for whatever kind of fix you have.
---
Kapkan- love his weapons / C4 and I like trying to think of where the most likely routes for attack will be to plant traps
---
On attack thermite or dokkabae, thermite because I like his weapon and blowing shit up, dokkabae because a well timed logic bomb can help out your team tremendously 
---
He's not wrong at all. Some people treat ranked like it's the fucking Invitational 2018 Grand Final and they're Penta down 0-2 to EG in dire need of a 3 map come back
---
At the start of this season, I changed my controller layout so I could crouch spam and therefore win gunfights I shouldn't. After two weeks I realized I wasn't doing it, and I didn't need it. So I reverted back to my old controller layout, and I played better. I can't crouch spam with the default layout. I don't need crouch spam, and you don't either.
---
If theres no penalty for leaving people are going to leave, it's just that simple
---
Check my edit :)
---
Not really no, i didnt take a screen cap but i can get one of the friends in the group to come back me up. 
---
Or do ye want proof of the 2 wins 
---
They have 3rd party devices that disguise it as a controller.
---
There is nothing they can do. 
---
A ‚Äústamina‚Äù system on crouching like in CSGO could help this. You can only spam so much before it slows down and puts you at an awkward disadvantage 
---
Big if true. 
---
Thank you for acknowledging the problem!
---
We would definitely appreciate this kind of communication on issues more often.
---
I feel like the leaning in siege needs to be like crouching in csgo, where if you do it over and over, it slows down
---
Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please do not mess this up Ubi! The one thing that makes siege unique is the control the player has on his operator. Do not take that away. Other comments have suggested very reasonable fixes like slowing down crouch speed for subsequent crouching
---
Ubi has acknowledged the issue, bit it puts the kb inputs as a controller, so it cannot be detected. Have to wait for next gen consoles
---
Try using more commas and periods, but I agree with your opinion
---
I was one of them lawl XD
---
GOD SAVE THE NOTY
---
Yo, that's cool, intimidating, and kind of hot. 
---
Unlucky. I played Consulate 4 times in a row today in the SI game mode. 
---
New invitational game mode. All ops with skins have them equipped in the game mode.
---
*praises God*
---
Thank you so much for looking into this. Thank you all 
---
Dirrtty ace bud. 
---
completely remove crouch and lean spam.
---
So, on r/rainbow6, just go to the main page, and on mobile in the top right is three dots. Click change user flair, then find echo main and select that. On pc it's to the far right on the middle, then just click change user flair
---
u/jackanory994 
---
It‚Äôs cause Ubisoft is Canadian and we don‚Äôt want you infecting our superior country.
---
First the playlist, now this! And Lion rework news on SI ? Thanks guys Year 4 'bout to be the best 
---
I wouldve said: 
---
#FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKKK
---
Thank you so much :-) 
---
If you haven't had blitz voted out u havent played the real gamemode lol
---
I would also love this, but people who take long times to load get kicked, and if someone were to leave a match in casual no one would replace them, because no one would have the option enabled to join ongoing matches. A better solution would be adding a percentage xp boost when you backfill, to the tune of 15 or so percent.
---
I've had contact with Ubisoft before on related matters. I don't think they'll give me the time of day but you're right, I can always try.
---
I‚Äôm impressed at the C4 throw...every time I try that it gets stuck on the goddam ceiling. 
---
that is a retarded system mate.
---
Not exactly it but thanks!
---
This is amazing, I hope it doesn‚Äôt get over nerfed tho
---
Tru 
---
Ash has an absolutely astronomical pick rate
---
Zofia is eeeehhh
---
Bandit and kaid are both relatively even
---
Blitz is picked a shit load at most tiers
---
Montagne is just sadly huddled in the corner
---
Well some would maybe still have it on so those people will get put in 
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt ubisoft allow you to play on other servers
---
Not as bad as the Fortnite system?
---
The hammer and Clash/Maestro images are super blurry for me, anyone else?
---
I think, "Um... It's in the title... I met a girl during terrorist hunt....then I took her on some dates in game... The *first* pic is theme park. She died trying to come back inside...and bottom is a romantic getaway." is good, I understood it just fine. Perhaps people are so used to memes that they dont understand a genuine story??? Idk
---
Take a guess who my team banned, its pretty fucking obvious
---
Thank you Ubi, very cool.
---
Clash‚Äôs reaction to seeing ubi report her win delta as -10.9%
---
So let me guess in your perfect world you want nothing that can give anyone an advantage over a slower player cuz everything has to be equal right how bout they just take out all operators and it is just recruits and they can only use pistols that way it's fair for everyone...OHH and no crouching or leaning anymore cuz someone could not be good at that and a constant mini map so no one gets upset when they are knifed 
---
Ah I was confused because I play Monty ALL the time and I rarely play Ash but yeah on the larger scale of the game, Ash is picked a lot and Monty a lot less.
---
&gt;This seems to be a logical approach. Make doing it the first time at 100% speed, then a second tap 95% speed, and a third tap 90% speed. After that make it 50% speed with a 3 second timer before speed reset. Should also apply to leaning as well.
---
lol csgo had this problem for a long time, they did the same fix
---
it doesnt really affect their aim at all. It just moves the crosshair slightly up/down and left/right.
---
Lmao
---
Fortnite is just RNG just like PUBG
---
Jokes on him, at least my SMG isn't a potato.
---
What packs? Is there a new event?
---
what have you done
---
What exactly is ‚Äúrecently‚Äù? The crouch spamming has been a massive, glaring issue in Siege from day 1, which turned into an epidemic LONG ago. The speed of the game mechanic is to blame just as much as are the players. Ubisoft has enabled quite completely, and hopefully has some ideas actually worthwhile. 
---
Hahahaha. üòÇ
---
I just hope leaning wont become super slow and cumbersome
---
That did it! TYSM 
---
I need to learn my manners
---
Ye
---
I KNOW ECHO IS MY MAIN WTF
---
yea I know. Don‚Äôt think they should change it personally but they could always make him 2/2 w/o the shield and 3/1 w it 
---
Operation health 2: crouching removed 
---
Thank you! Kaid‚Äôs shotgun on console next please
---
there‚Äôs literally nothing Ubisoft can do about it. there aren‚Äôt that many MnK users on console, it‚Äôs blown way out of proportion and you losing doesn‚Äôt mean the other team is using MnK
---
It‚Äôs cosmetic. Who cares.
---
A stupid charm
---
Nerf blitz pls
---
Because it ruins communication and tbh the Asian players are insanely good and play at very low ranks, so practically smurfing
---
I don't think you understand how bad this practice actually is... especially on young kids who could likely develop gambling addictions because of it 
---
Stop talking shit
---
Just like Nintendo telling fans that Metroid Prime 4 is being reset. We'll understand as long as we know it's being worked on.
---
Hello bobby_baby, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajvptu/ranked/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
*BIG UPVOTE*
---
Got a sick outfit for doc
---
But doing QEQEQEQEQE which does indeed break your hitbox, in a sense of your head literally being almost unhitabble
---
Theyre polygons dude 
---
Because the only shield operator that has a place in this game is Monty. 
---
Can I ask how it's a "pro feeling play style" if it's not taken as seriously as ranked? If people are not banning the best ops for the map and playing proper teams, droning people in etc surely a "pro feeling play style" would be a hyper competitive match people doing the best they can to win?
---
Not him, but I‚Äôll drop my 2 cents.
---
Siege just provides a different type of gun play compared to a lot of other shooters. For example, Halo and Call of Duty. These games are a bit more run and gun and arcade-y, die then respawn, and what have you. Not to say these games aren‚Äôt fun or their gunplay is bad by any means, they‚Äôre just different. Siege emphasizes angles, positioning, recoil patterns, and shot placements (for the most part, at least) when it comes down to gun play. The gunplay requires more thought and strategy (or at least it should, there are the crouch and lean spamming 3 speed mains that deviate from this) that isn‚Äôt necessarily prominent in a lot of other shooters on the market. CSGO would be a game that fits this description to an extent. 
---
Again, this is not to say other shooters not like siege are bad or have subpar gun play; it‚Äôs just a different style of gunplay that a lot of people including myself enjoy. Hopefully with the crouch and lean updates they have in mind help the game recenter back to a tactical style shooter
---
dont get me wrong, this was lucky lol
---
&gt;Agreed lean spams whatever but eh I'll take what I can get
---
Lean spamming literally does?
---
yeah but only in that mode, that's how it was in the halloween event too
---
I don‚Äôt like playing Blitz, but I like to win.
---
So why not do this to all ops then?
---
make it foxa vs magnet
---
Consider the jumping mechanism in Fortnite and how you can tire by jumping too much too quickly and prevent you from further jumping or diminished jumps. Perhaps a stronger version of this, a stamina so to speak, for said actions. 
---
Was it? Nice to know
---
Sigh
---
Just look up a video about crouch/lean spam im sure a video will show up regarding the issue, I personally dont play siege anymore but from what I've seen it just messes with your hitbox and generally looks absurd, in a semi realistic fps you shouldn't be able to crouch spam and lean at mach 7
---
Same here
---
I dislike echo with a passion. I specifically bought buck to shoot him vertically.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre still thinking of me a month later. 
---
Mira 
---
Clash looks like she's trying to show maestro her blue tongue after she ate a blueberry popsicle
---
It‚Äôs her grandmother I believe. In her operator video she talks about her *safta*, so it‚Äôs fairly likely that that is her right there.

This is a shitty shitpost, but I'll bite: Elena Maria "What's your favorite car" Alvarez is in fact best girl.
---
You cant plat recruit in the Pro League playlist 
---
it just probably is, I've seen mostly negative feed on my thread however if they do implement it it will go to ranked not casual.
---
Alibi
---
I'm going to stick to my previous statement and say branch out. There are plenty of operators in this game. The game is more fun if you play more than two ops. Let me tell you. 
---
with the trippie redd haha
---
Lord Tachanka is a dead meme
---
Sorry guys, he gets like this if he doesn't drink his formula after his first mid-afternoon nap.
---
I stopped playing a little after the second map.
---
I didn't even know there was a third...
---
I meant in casual. Probably should‚Äôve made that clear üòÖ
---
I don't know I guess people hate Blitz mains like me I guess
---
I wish this could be kept permanently for ranked play. Potential strategies having to be changed because of an OP ban would make the game a lot more tactical and fun.
---
Frost doesn‚Äôt seem to understand; the plan is to teamkill until you see ‚Äú0-3 TOTAL DEFEAT‚Äù
---
It's just a temporary event that will hopefully make it's way into ranked. Recruit is simply not used in PL. He ain't going anywhere.
---
The only thing I want is Mira's headgear. I don't care If I get all charms. JUST GIVE IT TO ME THIS ONCE UBI!
---
Hello Criz117, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajwa04/miras_family_charm_coordinates/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Oooooh. Thanks
---
game theory: recruit is actually lesion in disguise? 
---
Oh.
---
I play more than two operators, I come from League of Legends and I pretty much play different champions every game but I want the variety, I still my mains, my goods my bads but I enjoy mixing it up constantly, seeing different people and less same picks.
---
*Hehe, not anymore*
---
Nah u aint the only one but its nice aint it?
---
Ya. You need to do it through the discovery playlist but you can ban any of the ops. Your team can only ban one though, it acts like selecting bomb sites in ranked. If one gets more votes than all others, then that's the operator your team bans. If there is a tie, then its a random selection from the tied operators. Your team can ban a single attacker, and a single defender. The enemy team can do the same. Do remember that neither team can play any banned operators (so remember not to ban an operator you want to play).
---
BU was created as a terrorist hunt map only, putting into rotation gave them a lot of backlash. They're planning a few reworks including favela but I think everyone wanted BU out of the rotation more than anything.
---
What about enabling friendly fire on gadgets, huh? It‚Äôd be much easier to do that. There‚Äôs ways around everything. 
---
üò¢
---
Ok, I'm sorry if it looked like I was a dumbass
---
Lol it‚Äôs wonderful. 
---
Try raw input in the Control Settings
---
Sick, thanks man.
---
I play on console so Blitz isn't an issue I guess on PC he's hated 
---
Huh, A lot of people ban Echo. Idk if it's because I'm a trashy gold player but I don't see him as that big of a threat.
---
I am terrible frustrated over things like this, people like you and OP. People that complain with no disregard to actually looking into the objective of things. It haven't been up for more than half a day and people are going mad, like it's the end of the world. It's a challenge. I personally hate the club challenges where I have to kill people with a special type of weaponry, but I am not all up in arms over it, because it's temporary and I can deal with it like an adult, without having to complain about every little thing. 
---
All that you say is under the assumption that this game mode is made to promote team play. What if it's not? What if it's done to encourage people to play games, a lot of games, testing out what has actually changed. The ban phase for instance. This is probably no more than a test, as you'd expect it to be. Testing out servers, bugs etc. 30 drones is a lot, and takes a lot of gameplay. 10 headshots can be over in a couple of rounds. 
---
I am not against people having discussion, and voicing opinions. But when you haven't even seen what to come, or know what their intentions is. You shouldn't call it a stupid drone challenge, just because you're a two faced half-wit that reads "competitive" and automatically assume you're going to play like the pro-league. 
---
Battlefield is one I think of. It's not like the guns feel bad (I still love battlefield 4), it's just more 'rigid'. The ability to lean and strafe is non-existant in that game; you don't pre-aim corners, because there's not really a point.
---
I liked the map as well, it was fun to get kills from spawn peeking the front entrance :D
---
Dude, it's not the connection. I've had multiple people in random lobbies tell me the same thing.
---
Like, I went into games and asked teammates where my character was looking. It was like 60^(o) off, like in the clip.
---
&gt; me hitting plat doesn‚Äôt prove it
---
Dude, did you read my post? I've just played against plats and diamonds who have done nothing but lean and crouch spam with 1.5+ k/ds. Why should I believe you're any different when you admit you do the same thing? You're the same as them, and you're making no credible points for your case.
---
&gt; I definitely just lean spammed all the at up to plat
---
Yeah, you win enough games in your placement matches using that shit and you'll be in plat off the bat. If not, then do it in Gold, win your games enough and you'll be in Plat. It's not out of reach theoretically nor practically.
---
&gt; are you on Xbox we could 1v1
---
Sorry, no, I play on PS4. 
---
Secondly, this game is not about 1v1. I don't care if you kill me 1000 times in a 1v1. The point of this game is a 5v5 strategic, tactical, skill-based FPS game. Not a 1v1 shootout. 
---
Pretty common tactic. Shields in a doorway usually mean welcome mat or EDD
---
When finally i fixed the dropshot to crouch spam shot u fix it i want to know how we gonna play as a game lovers 
---
Its just not what siege is, its a semi realistic fps where to win an engagement you're either supposed to be a better shot or a better strategist, not better at wiggling at mach 7, personally I don't play this game anymore (but am still very active on its meta and what's happening) but i can very clearly see how this can be a huge problem, especially in higher ranks where EVERYONE is willing to abuse these mechanics to win
---
Lion for me. I hate his wall hacks.
---
&gt; You literally can‚Äôt do it on console it‚Äôs a visual bug
---
Ok, I'll ask around about it.
---
&gt; fool
---
Did I start talking shit about you? Go fuck yourself, prick.
---
Now fix shields
---
First learn to tie a nuse, than hang your dog. Than fuck it‚Äôs dead body. Than call Ubisoft support and complain about the fact they killed your dog. Get your items back in game. Repeat next time a minor inconvenience happens. 
---
i still would like more maps to be available, and gamemodes
---
It's supposed to replace ranked when it's over.
---
Am I the only person who hasn‚Äôt died because of lions drone or something?
---
Yeah? Well lean spam is just as bad.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean that all rules should go to ranked.
---
It's a mix. You should do everything in your power to win, but at the end of the day we're all just trying to have a good time.
---
Only 3/second? I wish that was the case.
---
&gt; into rotation
---
Casual or Ranked?
---
Why. and I mean WHY would they EVER think making clash throw her tongue out was a good idea?

Are you okay?

I swung low, just in case. But yeah, I've seen something like 8/ second before in videos. It's wacky.

:( I thought the shield would stop the EDD from being triggered cause they‚Äôd vault over it?

Only Blitz main will down vote this. ü§£

Lets get this to the top upvoted post!

hi  Take Your Plates why not both. fun for every1 i rekon

The rush meta. Ash is a 3-Speed with an ACOG and a good gun. She is normally used by the "no-brains all COD" type players who just rush in and kill everyone before the minute mark. People don't like getting rushed, so they ban the operator that rushes.
---
I‚Äôve died to it like once, but I get that it‚Äôs a problem
---
Yeah sure bud, that's what it is. You must be dense if you think half the people on Reddit use their awful search function.
---
Sorry that not everyone has time in their day to sort by new to see every little repost. Maybe if people upvoted the original this wouldn't happen as often.
---
omg thank you for that.
---
I was bout to get so pissed off about seeing this *again like every fucking thread*
---
Then stick to casual if you wanna play with a casual audience. Ranked is for us sweaty try hards.
---
What‚Äôs an uncircumcised dick ever done to you..? I‚Äôve got a guess but.. never mind I don‚Äôt want to know
---
Maybe this will make me return to what used to be my favorite game
---
Is that...
---
the Imperial Seal of Japan?
---
Why don‚Äôt you open your packs!
---
Frags, stuns
---
Just need to do what CSGO does, make it so the moment they spam it more than twice you immediately chug down and become a super easy target.
---
I'm not dealing with more 12 year olds
---
Cannot confirm authenticity of said audio, hence they cannot be banned for abusive audio.
---
I don't think you know what I macro is? The best way to do it is with a macro. Not all macros work the same but if you get a good one you can make it spam at the most perfect time interval to break the game the most.
---
Are you on pc?
---
No
---
Why you steal/dig out old Pics? 
---
Xbox or PS4 
---
They probably identified it as a problem as soon as it hit the front page here, and they chose to wait instead of communicating right away because they wanted to put tests in to see if there was anything they can do at first. If you communicate to the community that you're going to fix that problem as soon as possible and it turns out to be a lot harder than originally thought, then you'll be pissing off the community with empty promises. This is why we haven't heard anything about reworks they have for operators. They have to make sure that things will work and can put a time stamp on when it will be finished before making empty promises
---
This mode is really fun and I would like this permanently in the game. The old Rang mode should also necessarily remain or get the new mode at least all maps of the current. Nothing is more annoying than always playing the same few maps
---
üòÅüòÅ I'll gladly wait for the game as long as it's a masterpiece just like the first one. The music and atmosphere has to be done right
---
Ps4
---
Same 
---
But how
---
yeah but thats why we should get repeat demo like in csgo.
---
csgo doesnt show you anything, but still we got overwatch and you can download the entire match to view it again.
---
Did it last night and it saved me a couple times. 
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt know what all those questions are for, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the  number of blatant hackers is exaggerated. Your concerns are instinctive,  since you have no actual way to check *how* you died, but your subconscious may also be using it as an excuse for the mistakes you may have made. 
---
I have no actual way to check how I died? Are you high, or what? I only played a couple matches of the event. All other multiplayer matches of R6S I ever played where with access to a killcam. I think I know from all the other matches that there are quite a lot of hackers on the PC platform. At least in my time bracket &amp; skill bracket, I cannot talk for any other brackets.
---
And what mistakes are you talking about? Where did I state I made mistakes in my matches? 
---
I love this map too, but it has severe issues for a somewhat competitive play, starting with the fact that the vertical gameplay is almost nonexistant, layout is easy yes, but too big a good attacker expirience, not hvig enoght time for droning.
---
Look like they gonna go down vs dj blyatman and the russian village boys
---
thats what casual is about
---
You might forgot why Ubi put it out of Rotation. There is a good reason for it. And as long as its not getting reworked, its not coming back. 
---
Probably plays operators who have high ban percentages. Which is fair but also could means he should learn all operators.
---
no
---
https://www.wwe.com/videos/playlists/triple-h-sledgehammer-attacks-playlist
---
Can‚Äôt pick site: that‚Äôs fair
---
Can‚Äôt see site: Yeah also fair 
---
Can‚Äôt see spawnpoint: If all drones are destroyed; spawnpoint is shown
---
Secure Area Instead of Hostage/Bomb: You can select gamemodes to play
---
Many Non-Comp. maps: Fair, but non-comp maps like House or Yacht can be fun
---
Join in Progress: a bit of a stick in the ass but unless you want to add abandon penalty it‚Äôs not going to be worth removing. 
---
Matchmaker doesn‚Äôt select on causal: not true, it does try to make Causal matches as close as possible. 
---
No real rules or consequences: You must be new. Everything is a slap on the wrist In this game
---
Premades vote to kick: At least they aren‚Äôt tking you or berating you like ranked. I get a free match leave with some toxic ass players 
---
Causal is bad but this is an overstatement.
---
Agreed, I could do a call out and be told to shut the fuck up 
---
Do you have reasons or is it on a personal level? 
---
But how am I gonna effectively teabag!
---
But pubg hit detection isnt rng. It rewards skilled players with good aim like in siege/battlefield. 
---
Sure it may be fun but it‚Äôs not nearly as competitive, which is why a lot of players turn it off
---
Wow... Ubi are able to communicate.. first time I have seen that happening.
---
Why would it being hitscan mean you can dodge as a result?
---
Best argument I've heard for not changing it. XD
---
guess you're playing PC. On xbox I'm only against plat/diamond and I'm silver 2 level 49
---
That‚Äôs not what I said my dude
---
Bop.
---
Man thank God your idea will never see the light of day
---
I noticed most of the PL players today had the new universal equipped. Looks pretty good
---
&gt; And what mistakes are you talking about? Where did I state I made mistakes in my matches?
---
I‚Äôm only saying that in some situations it may have been just a f*ck-up on your end and not an enemy with an unfair advantage. 
---
The first time i tried pubg was after mainly playing siege for months and it felt like a chore to play
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Maestro heavily outweighs all the women in the game.  It's not physically possible, no amount of "fighting spirit" can change that.  Unless siege is set in the action movie land where the less a women ways the more fully train marines she can defeat single handedly
---
Penguin simulator.
---
So you break the wall next to lobby stairs and then you parkour on that loan room wall.
---
Casual is for goofing off, laid back.
---
Ranked is about playing, learning, becoming better
---
u/UbiNoty are you going to take that slash to your honor?
---
Unfortunately, you *have* seen the light of day. Bad times for all of us.
---
That's a reduntant question
---
Yeah you're right. Maestro is an absolute beast. At 6'1" and with that muscle mass, dude would easily hit 210. Even if clash was all muscle she wouldnt stand a chance
---
I asure you i do know what a macro is. Which is why i said possiby. Meaning this player could very well be using a macro. 
---
However its also possible to spam like we see here without a macro. Pro league players have crouch spammed like this at LAN events.
---
Im well aware its easier to do with macros. But its possible without also.
---
How many cores is your cpu?
---
Appreciate the communication and I can't wait to see what you come up with. 
---
As an idea I think you're probably looking at already is add cooldown to continuous crouches, similar to what counter strike did. You can do similar things to leaning such as having someone complete the full lean motion before they're allowed to lean again. That way you can still have one quick peak which would take skill to do but not the overwhelming spazzing out of ash mains.
---
Also. Bring Pro League rules to ranked.
---
i just hope the "solution" wont mess with siege's flow of gunplay
---
Ah, the Blood Orchid pistol recoil. Good times.
---
Alibi or Clash
---
&lt;3
---
Oh yes, absolutely. Where did I state that the majority of the playerbase where hackers? It's most definitely a minority. Most people do not hack.
---
It's just that hacking is still quite common, and therefore we should have access to a killcam. This is not a tournament setting with known people, where you know they don't cheat.
---
That‚Äôs a redundant way to show everyone your point if you can‚Äôt even prove that said point. 
---
Hibanana

Keep up the good work!

There‚Äôs a difference between funny low-effort and just plain low-effort

Hello creamysardinehandler, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajwx0z/spread_the_word/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I'm going to be honest. I don't think we need the 6th pick in ranked unless you make it all full stack or implement a team vote on who should pick six. It's a system that wouldn't be as smooth.
---
I also think there's a good element to droning and discovering ops etc. It's just a little harder imo to implement than other changes for someone who solo or duo ques. Everything else. Bring it to ranked.

---
Because people who play ranked and give a shit about a number in a video game think everyone else has to as well.
---
I personally love it and hope it gets added to the game, but I don‚Äôt think it would replace the current ranked set up. 
---
I mean not to be too rude about it but I dont think you need the /s there. Unless you can literally only play one match a week or less that really is quite a long time. I only play roughly one per day and I have probably earned over 500k. 
---
The pattern in CS GO is predictable and controllable because it's the same pattern every time. You cannot say the same about fortnite
---
I like the pick and ban option. I think it would have a great place in both the casual and ranked playlists.
---
Casual just got a little more interesting and ranked will still have the competitive edge it needs. But this would be a more appealing way to make casual easier to enjoy.
---
The only way I can tell in game is if I'm attack or defend
---
Gj well played 
---
well copper exists so...
---
&gt; he has to either expose his head with no flash or try to hip fire you before you gun down his legs/arms
---
Or he assists in the bomb plant and you win through objective instead of maybe through TDM.
---
Cancerous people who spam this crap then think they are actually good at the game. Giant tumors the lot of them. 
---
Yeah the macro abuse is crazy for this
---
...that thermite breach lol
---
Poor Bandit...
---
Alright- Razer synapse has a thing where you can calibrate the mouse to a surface. If that‚Äôs not it, I‚Äôm kinda out of ideasüòÇ
---
When we get the other 3. My challenge says you only get 1 from the challenge
---
Why the FUCK do you hate Michael Jordan so much?
---
You get the operators regardless of your login.
---
You can't really put a damper on leaning but crouching you can most definitely implement csgo's method.
---
Yes, there is no login requirement for the pass
---
ew why waste your renown on that 
---
[and it's been this way since season 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/6xi74j/changes_to_casual_matchmaking_in_season_3/)
---
While there are ways to mitigate that randomness like FSA, I definitely agree that bloom is one of the worst aspects of Fortnite. It feels awful to have the center dot placed perfectly on opponents, only for the RNG to cause your shots to whiz harmlessly past your head. It's why close quarters and building are so important- bad RNG doesn't matter when their head takes up your entire crosshair.
---
I see a lot of blitz/ash bans coming. 
---
why? The number is meaningless as it include free weekend players and alternate accounts. The only number (which they would never actually reveal) that matters is concurrent players. 
---
Did you not buy them? Are you jealous you can‚Äôt?
---
We appreciate this communication Ubi 
---
THANK YOU! Someone with actual logics. Honestly, they complain about EVERYTHING!! Lol. They failed to realize that they have the ability to even the playing field. But rather cry about on Reddit. 
---
It's a test for ranked
---
*removes the lmg and starts charging the attackers*
---
I hope it stays!
---
But he‚Äôs an attacker...?
---
That happened to me in the Halloween event...
---
That is amazing
---
Make a "Casauler" game mode
---
Muzzle or flash, depending on the day‚Äôs mood. 
---
It's more competitive style of plat that used in ESL matches. It's a test for ranked.
---
Do you plan on playing ranked?, I planned on solo queueing to high plat/diamond like I do on PS4, and it was the most retarded thing I have ever tried to do, most people sit in parties on Xbox and barley play in game chat, if you plan on making it in to a high rank, you need friends to do it on xbox
---
Hsr player model looks nice, her operator image looks terrible
---
I wasn't around for this, but at one point the DMR's fastest shooting speed was reduced, but most people didn't even feel a tangible difference. It's mostly targeted at macro users, and they often calibrate it so that the human players aren't egregiously affected.
---
- The timer for bans need to be quicker. 30 seconds per is too long.
---
Only if we can never join matches in progress.
---
Yeah and to be clear I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad game, just a shitty design choice. Give each of the weapons a recoil pattern and call it a day. 
---
It's on the front page of the sub Reddit.
---
.l. 
---
I don‚Äôt play this game and have no idea how that saved you, could someone explain
---
After grinding and buying all the operators with renown, that is an achievement to me too. 
---
4 real
---
Thx friend Capitol mains are good too
---
MEAT SABER 
---
Good thing u got it tho. Sheesh. No idea it was that much to get all of them 
---
All of them
---
That's why I cared enough to tell y'all.
---
Her DMR clip size is on par with Buck's and BB's though, and BB's has the angled grip aswell.
---
Suggestion. 
---
Please check how csgo and battlefield has fixed this. After 1 or 2 crouches they are starting to crouch slower and slower. This should fix r6 too. Also do the same for lean.
---
Ubisoft, please delete the game instead of ruining it
---
Thank you.
---
Technically, neither does a boner.
---
It's vote based, your team is just voting for dumb shit

Upload it to YouTube and share it to r/youtubehaiku.

Chalets Is Not That Bad To Be  Honest But Hey That‚Äôs Your opinion

True I saw the face get leaked
---
and that is
---
# nice
---
&gt; I didn't vote to ban him for the meme
---
&gt; I did it because I thought it would be funny
---
pick one
---
Nope blackbeard doesn't have access to the angled grip unfortunately(on his marksman anyway) , I know the clip size is the same but I really like using an angled grip on a dmr
---
Keep this ban mode pls
---
i know the lucio is photoshopped but is the background real? i am good with photoshop and i would say everything except the play road to si would be easy
---
Welp this game is dead to be then.
---
Main reason I didn't play BO3 ranked.
---
That‚Äôs also my fear. I‚Äôll be sticking mainly with my Slim until I upgrade to a Pro. I just figured playing on more powerful hardware would ‚Äúfeel‚Äù better. 
---
sometimes i forget people have to actually buy ops 
---
Starter Edition dude. You get 3 ops for each attack and defense. Each subsequent operator takes 100k to grind out. One will hit level 20 for ranked before the time the same time they unlock their first operator. 
---
Thats todays loading screen hahaha
---
As others here pointed out we really appreciate the communication. Thanks devs. I hate the crouch and lean spam but what's even worse to me is that we as a community often feel left alone with problems in the game so if you guys could just get into contact with us more often like now that'd be amazing.
---
really but is the lucio photoshopped
---
Yeah obvs lol
---
then they really need to up that level.
---
By lucio you mean the jamaican thing?
---
Na man it's just the gaming chair.
---
Ya if you're getting it to play ranked cross console and you have no friends to play ranked with, 10/10 would not recommend getting an Xbox
---
..... unless you like Forza üëÄ
---
Thank you for the acknowledging that there is an issue, we don't expect a fox ASAP.  Crouch spamming is incredibly frustrating to deal with.
---
This discussion is out my SCOPE but I prefer that glaz over thy glaz any time.

ya i was making sure also the photoshop on the matchmaking box could be touched up

It's a great way to pick out of your comfort zone if you only pick that op if they get banned and a good way to learn new strats 
---
Oh shit I thought everyone got it first try. Damn
---
Keep Rollin baby
---
I'm saying I didn't do it for the whole "Lord Tachanka" meme, I did it because he offers no utility, it would be like banning the recruit to me, we could've gone no ban and it would've been the same 
---
And I already picked one 
---
This Is So Sad
---
Haha. Well I‚Äôve been with Xbox since it‚Äôs beginning. Upgraded from the S to the X in October. Bought a PS4 Slim in November and haven‚Äôt touched my Xbox since. Partly out of guilt, I figured buying Siege for it might give more reason to play it again. 
---
Thanks can't wait to use this ;)
---
[Nice!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx-HkTEV5YU)
---
That was something I considered too, I just wasn‚Äôt sure if that would affect the gameplay in siege. Anyway I‚Äôm sure they will make the right choice to better the siege experience! Thanks again for your help!!
---
I don't think casual should have bans, but I do think casual should be like the new playlist without the bans and all the maps.

It‚Äôs alrightü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Play a match or restart ap
---
Ye it worked tnx :)
---
I don't see a reveal timer, are they getting rid of this as well? If so good. I really hope they get rid of 6th pick and the reveal phase. Kinda makes things a little spicy not knowing what you're going against. 
---
Nice shot. I've gotten the feel down for distance for zofia's gadget but I wish it tilted a bit as you looked up so that you could accurately use the ladder sight. 
---
Leaving is the best part git gud
---
Ela is bae but monty is bae-er 
---
An xbox one S, I see you are a man of culture.
---
No one has fun being dead friend or not. Do you think this is going through op or his friends head when they‚Äôre playing, ‚ÄúOH BOY IM SO HAPPY MY FRIEND SHOT ME IN THE HEAD AND NOW WERE DOWN A MAN SO US WINNING IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE ME MY SELF AM DEAD BECAUSE OF MY FRIENDS FUN GAMES‚Äù ? I‚Äôm glad op got the 7 day
---
Hopefully it becomes the final version of ranked.
---
Eh
---
Yeah I had to block two people because they kept harassing me about it. 
---
Then I suggest you consider buying:
---
- Hibana
---
- Jackal
---
- Zofia
---
- Maverick
---
Any other questions you need answers for?
---
He could crush a melon with those biceps
---
Most Plats are just crouch spammers that cheese to get good stats. They suck lol
---
Same. I posted it here too.
---
Blitz or montagne?
---
Okay?
---
Agreed easily the best op in the game
---
[Are you in the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajylmw/hbu_take_some_notes/?st=JRD41E73&amp;sh=2ed75aac) bloody match?

Your cpu could be used heavier in T-hunt. You might also have a software acceleration on
---
Ahhhh. I‚Äôm jelly you have all of them! I‚Äôm too boujee to use real money on this game lmao 
---
It‚Äôs funny how people don‚Äôt understand that your kd when you were bad carry‚Äôs over. 
---
So if you aren't diamond or plat you can't enjoy it either?
---
Ranked is, frankly, a steaming pile of shit right now.  I don't even play the game anymore because of QEC spam, and at Plat and Diamond, it's constant blitz rushing, with a dok, sometimes a lion (rarely cause most people still don't know how to coordinate him properly), jackal, mira spam, etc.
---
This is the gamemode that should have been ranked for a long time.  And yes - I appreciate that starter edition people get screwed.  That's a shame.  But the solution is NOT to prevent enjoyment of this mode for everyone else - it's to prevent them from getting screwed.  Give them 5 or 6 operators to unlock at the beginning instead for example.
---
And it's still easy to get hatches, just throw a grenade before putting down a charge 
---
PMM

Xbox?
---
The last time I had this issue, I changed it on my phone browser. PC browser didn't work.
---
Twice in a row, the only solution was my phone.
---
Well, that makes more sense.
---
Brendon Greene hasn't really been behind many games. He helped out with H1Z1s King of the Hill, and he was behind the battle royale mods for Arma 2/3.
---
Yes.
---
Yep.
---
The ping isn‚Äôt that high...
---
nothing like there other games, so if you go in thinking it'll be like DOI or Insurgency you will be dissapointed. It leans more towards call of duty with the removal of AP rounds and other features that set it apart from the cookie cutter FPS's that are put out. Dont get me wrong. Game looks great but its poorly optimized and not like the other NWI titles.
---
I think they should slow down even strafe
---
Like not working :(
---
God. Dammit.  
---
It was proven that it wasn't an advantage in multiple videos and tests.  
---
Why do people have to complain because they are bad? This happens in so many games.
---
Atleast, that's my opinion.
---
dumbass
---
ddosing? isnt that on peer to peer only? thought this game wasnt 
---
People clearly hate shields
---
Haha awesome 
---
Say, can somebody region hop and play in ESL, as long as he has 150 ping?
---
Just a curiosity question.
---
Cool 
---
Hey no bullying
---
Just queue for a new game and it'll be in your inventory when it's over
---
me and my friends all agreed to always ban Blitz because we HATE him
---
Shotguns are broken. Completely useless if your shooting at anything over 10 feet away

I only want Mira's.

Thanks

Have a decaying sensitivity when doing any of these movements, so when you lean, crouch or prone, it is incredibly slow to move your crosshair.
---
Esport FPS will literally never use bloom ~~again~~. Anything RNG has no place in any kind of esport, especially one as tactical as Siege whi h requires some mega brain thinking compared to CS GO.
---
I had the same issue and just by restarting  the game the problem was fixed
---
Dude this is soo cool!
---
Valk vs Loud woman would be awesome.
---
It was during a scrim
---
Awesome! Nice work, a great improvement for the game.
---
Tf???
---
I can try, gotta get home first tho
---
Honestly, get a team of 5. It‚Äôs the only way to rank up. In terms of improving your own gameplay, Aust1n has a video on how to improve your terrorist hunt practice. My personal advice, I used to play way too careful, and if you play like this, you need to know when to just brave it and jump into a window or doorway, and trust your aim.
---
What do you struggle most with? Do you use sound?
---
Thank you, somone gets it
---
Depends of shotgun, in my experience elas shotgun can decimate even at longer ranges with emptying the magazine, and gign shotgun also has suprising range

Because console

Noooo.....

---
I don't know and yes.
---
People play this game for fun, Pick and ban is good but the none side switching is shit
---
I don't want to play ranked. Fuck that. It's toxic and unfun. I just want to get better.
---
&gt;I used to play way too careful, and if you play like this, you need to know when to just brave it and jump into a window or doorway, and trust your aim.
---
I play like this until I get one-tapped by some sweatlord holding an  angle.
---
For me it's Overwatch and Fortnite and games like that that still cling to bloom and chunky hitboxes. Siege and CSGO do it right with proper recoil patterns and no bloom (CS GO only has bloom while you're moving)
---
The clunky feeling games on the other hand are ones with poor animations and way too much going on like Battlefield 4 And PUBG. And for as much Reddit complains about it, the hitreg in Siege is one of the best I've seen, and the servers are top notch too, I get 25ms ping on WUS and 70ms on EUS.
---
"gambling"
---
It's just a convoluted way to sell you a ¬£40 bundle. 
---
Can anyone tell me how i can get more packs?
---
It really depends on your playstyle. I personally enjoy just sitting by the site so I like to play Mira. 
---
You should kinda play ranked to get better, repetition is key, I also recommend taking a break all together if you're a bit burnt out, come back to the game after a couple of days, it'll make you re learn the game slightly and adjust. Drone more, check sensitivity settings and get them perfect. Have set plans when you attack and defend on each map. Patience is key and be calm in gun battles, and forget about KD or whatever others think. And rank, don't care about it, that's prob why you stopped playing ranked.
---
I got the seasonal skin in my pack, the only one I wanted
---
His guns are good, he has a very good support gadget which is simple, has claymores, hes the A N G R Y  M A N, whats not to like?
---
Where can I get this!
---
The sound still haunts me to this day.
---
I addressed this issue as a kind of racism upon Clash's dlc but it fell on deaf ears. Some even contradicted my case. I think this is racist but oh well a community like this won't consider it so. Just find a normal picture of Clash in-game. There are none.
---
R u sure this isn‚Äôt ashes skin?
---
Taiwan actually
---
Kinda felt this about drop shotting, it wasn't widely used, but people made it seem like it was a massive problem. Now it's awkward to go prone.
---
His name checks out, means it's not recently made. r/beetlejuicing
---
Cool, but did MJ post it on Reddit to help fellow siege members?
---
Nice, that's exactly how having randoms in lobbies would go haha. The pick/ban system definitely works on paper when you have a full squad that's going to rank, but when you have at least one random it's so easy for things to go wrong. 
---
Son of a bitch!
---
All the items are... meh. 
---
Same way people justify buying any other dlc? Also, ‚Äúso much‚Äù is relative. The $50 or so is not much for some people. 
---
Thank you for pointing this fact as well, usually this mistake is a native mistake, and also the way he writes is definitely English.
---
How stupid of me not to realize that he is from the future.
---
That's a pretty good C4 throw.

Having no killcam is amazing, but you can't check if somebody's cheating or not.

Crouch spam lean spam being worked on see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajusqs/crouch_and_lean_spamming/?st=JRDA0TYD&amp;sh=fb1be304

Operadidas more like..
---
Dokkaebi's shoulders. Not  only is her outfit bad, her shoulders are spread too far from her torso. There's about half an inch between her torso and her bicep. They just removed one thing and left it, as a result her shoulders are too wide for her body, and they didn't think to compensate for removed gear. It's a small missed details, but even the smallest details can throw an entire design off.
---
 &gt; What's the harm in that
---
People saying the same thing 1782 times
---
That‚Äôs all you did? I heard some people say you gotta type !claimreward or some shit like that.
---
At best, too.
---
I did 
---
I wish they would add this on Overwatch ranked.
---
I did it with the Thatcher elite skin with the S.I. skin over it and I really like the S.I. headgear and really hope that they would let us use the S.I. headgear with the elite skins.
---
That means it's seasonal.
---
So lazy
---
This system and map pool is incredibly good. If it had better matchmaking (elo based, now its just random) it would be really good, much better than the current state of ranked. I wish the ban timer was shorter, though. 15 seconds a ban should be enough. 
---
Genius.
---
How dare you parade her out in public like that! 
---
Valk or zof imo
---
This isn't /r/4panelcringe
---
Finally something new for my girl Dokk &lt;3
---
At this point they could just open up to MnK completely. I don‚Äôt want to buy any adapter for it but I would buy a proper Mouse and Keyboard to play with .
---
Blaming the development of the invitational pack cosmetics as a whole for a minor discrepency on only one of the 5 sets is like going to McDonalds, ordering their vegan wrap and sharing your thoughts on every other item because you shared a bad experience with only one of them, seems nitpicky to me. Dont buy them and thatll be your problem evaded.

The only annoying prick around here is you. He did not even correct your grammar, you just want to fight someone over the internet. What a great guy you must be.

---
But that's the thing it's a fluid motion that you still have to do I dont think quick leaning is game breaking maybe crouch spamming is but the quick lean with a crouch is like taking a angle and making it a 50/50 shot if your gonna be up or down it's a skillful part of the game to quick peek a door to see what's going on then repeek the same door at a different angle to get the kill.
---
Looks like beaulo can't do his quick peeks anymore...
---
I want this mode instead old rating!
---
r/woooosh ?
---
What I'm saying is those who designed the cosmetics for them spent it to no effort on them. They couldn't be bothered to make them worth it. I don't buy them anyway, but I hate to see them waste the talents they have on something so mediocre and lackluster when they could be making some of the most badass cosmetics in the game.

‚ÄúSomething must be done‚Äù yes take personal responsibility and play with a 5 stack

---
How do you get the thing that says who you main as??
---
Was this on the Road to S.I?
---
That is such a wrong thing to say. Ubisoft is a AAA company and has definitely earned many, many millions (mabye even more) with Siege.
---
Look at Fortnite and Overwatch. Even though I don't like the game there is one thing they do right and that's the balancing of game breaking issues. They should and probably do have a team of people just for fixing things like Lion, crouch spamming and other glitches that are in the game.
---
It is not unfair to expect a large company like Ubisoft to fix their game *and* push new content at the same time, especially when there is a community on Reddit with lots of good ideas they could just implement.
---
Coding is not that hard, and it doesn't take "many months" to implement a fix for crouch spamming like the one CSGO uses, certainly not if they would devote their attention to one thing at a time.
---
The reality is that they're either way too understaffed or simply don't care enough.
---
This isn't meant to be a competitive playlist...YET.
---
That "YET" is the keyword and is where the hype comes in. This playlist is testing the waters to see if the community WANT a Pro League based playlist. We are looking at a potential replacement for ranked, given a few changes of course. 
---
THAT is where the hype comes from. Also it's fun as fuck banning Lion every match like I'm Fabian.G2, always been a dream to pretend I'm the Best Player In The World.
---
Yes, because if you destroy 20 drones, you get a "Road to S.I" Alpha pack.
---
HOW DO YOU HAVE 319 ALPHA PACKS
---
Oh yea dude. Someone was loading for less than 10 seconds and 3 people left one of my matches earlier. 
---
Please
---
Shit, you right.
---
reduce speed of crouch and leaning speed
---
to the point where it is effective but not useless
---
The angle of these screenshots aren't the best. Doesn't really bring out the colours cause of the lighting
---
Totally agree, also I feel like it's way more frustrating for the other team to have a player with echo bothering them rather than a simple camera from valkirye. Valkirye is not really that big of a threat, just a personal preference though.

Retro might be on it but the original gang who made the first game isn't on it, they're long gone for sure. Still very hyped though!
---
It has a couple problems so what? doesn't mean it's entirely garbage. I can easily tell where shots are coming from in pubg.
---
Its in Casual and its an event for the normal game its called road to six invitationals, you can play a softer version of pro leaugue with pick and ban 3 round defender/attacker swap and the ESL map pool its available every weekend untill thw Six invitationals now
---
good, play it on pc
---
That doesn't make any sense
---
Good lord brother ! Seek help!
---
Fuck off
---
You had to add the challenge first tho, so.
---
Wanna share?
---
Or it could be the 4th of September.
---
Should have been valk. At least she has muscle mass üòÖ
---
Ive been waiting for this to be a gamemode since pick and ban was introduced it improves the game so much.
---
It needs to be implemented in ranked but probably do first to 5 win rather than first to 4 and 6 overtime, just to make the gamemode more fair.
---
true dat
---
Wait you mean people are so obssesed with the drone challenge they tk? Thats realy toxic
---
Hopefully this ruleset becomes New ranked as soon as possible. Just more rounds plus ESL mappool.
---
the biggest issue is when people use a macro to crouch spam faster than a normal person can achieve
---
happens alot in OCE servers and they will typically be boosters gets frustrating when you dont get elo for it aswel.
---
Thanks :)
---
this should be a mode in itself with Lion perma banned as well 
---
Yes, and they were a stack of 3
---
Manipulating server ip? What the hell?

Figure this one out: I couldn't not care more if I didn't try

I'm curious to what rank you are / play with, as I mostly play with high golds up to plat 2s and I see it almost all the time.
---
*VOTE KICK INITIATED*
---
I think that it should be similar to CS:GO as in they added something very similar to stamina, as in the player‚Äôs movement when crouching became slower, therefore the player‚Äôs crouch was not very fast.
---
Another idea si to make the player‚Äôs screen much less stable so that it has a fair trade-off as it will also be harder for them to hit their target.
---
And here i am. Ranked in Silver and dropped to copper within two days.
---
Okay I thought I was the only one and I hadn't said anything but I just saw another post with the same issue so no , your not the only one
---
So whats your Point? I played almost exclusively ranked for the last 4 seasons. I play esl matches and scrims since Grim Sky. I plan tactics together with one of our team and I IGL.  
---
The only thing I said is that I just don‚Äôt like Fortress. Imo it‚Äôs too big, there are too many rooms. Everywhere you are standing you could get peeked from 3 different angles. But what does it mean? NOTHING! Right. The Pro‚Äòs decide. The few players that earn their living with this game. Because they know best, what is good for the game. Sometimes even better than the devs.

We need answers

They are trolling because comunity don't like how angry clash is
---
Some advice, it only counts drones in the S. I. mode. While this may be obvious, it sometimes skips the mind. So causal and ranked ones won't count. 
---
As a cav main I couldn't agree more
---
Sure. But there is always this discovery playlist. Go learn it there. Or in T-hunt. For strats and everything around that, you need Ranked. Bc casual is just a messed up place, with no site pick, 4min time and a matchmaking that is not really balanced.
---
As the other said, my squad of diamonds and plat 1's never plays casual. Now we do and are matchmade with quite low ranks so that could explain your experience. 
---
Recently?  
---
I am glad you are working on the issue. But there is a serious disconnect on what's happening in the game and you reacting to it.
---
&gt;planning our next steps.
---
 
---
Pun intended?
---
That‚Äôs blitz bro
---
Restart game or PC
---
Later on they all left
---
No 
---
How can u even spam that hard. I tried and it doesn't work like that lol
---
Just because they don't say anything doesn't mean they aren't aware. 
---
They just don't want to promise something and not deliver, then they'd get more backlash. 
---
Is good for ps4
---
smae bans I got in the same order! 
---
or you could play the game like a normal player, in &amp; around your own skill level
---
Just sit your ban out and maybe talk to Ubi IDK
---
Is 1 TK and a ‚Äúwelcome to Rainbow‚Äù toxic?
---
It‚Äôs usually lion blitz or thatcher even on boarder. Then lesion Mira or clash for me. Seems pretty nice picks tbh 
---
What did it cost?
---
Generally veterans would think they would have no skill, which most times are true. That does not mean you have to be toxic. I wish it was a much more enjoyable experience for newer playersm
---
Most people want to win, and "new players" are in their eyes more an extra player for the enemy because they dont know shit :(
---
Why is everyone banning cav? She is not that hard to deal with lmao. Would rather ban echo or Mira with lesion cause lesion just is too damn good 
---
What's wrong with banning Hibana? Personally I ban her for certain maps especially club house. It's not trolling at all. Same for thermite on consulate garage if I'm defending first. There's a strat and reason behind it 
---
Fookin' lasah skateboards
---
Nah in plat elo on PC it gets boring lmao 
---
Ah, the wonderfully agonizing stress of playing against crouch spamming.
---
It couldnt be much more closer to the right sub. Its an esports documentary that is currently being showcased in a specific chain of movie theatres and is streamable for free via sony crackle. 
---
Die, casual.
---
I- I mean. You are entitled to that opnion. 
---
It does because that means hes getting more points from stuff outta kills
---
Why does an ace not count if it's in casual? It's still an ace
---
'Frost Main'
---
your leaderboard spot is determined by your overall score, not K/A/D. he/she did more for the team, E.G. healed as doc, placed down ADSs as J√§ger, destroyed Bandit batteries as Thatcher, etc
---
This. Exactly this. People who ban cav are wasting a ban. She got bad weapons, a mediocre 'gadget', it's way too risky to interrogate. The risk is not worth the reward. 
---
Happy cake day! 
---
I feel you Bro. When I was new, I'd get team killed when I was 6/0. Or I'd see people vote to kick other people for no reason. Angry, Toxic messages in causal games. It's honestly ridiculous. But every PVP game's community is getting pretty toxic
---
Some time? Crouch spamming is here from Para-fucking-bellum
---
then go for diamond
---
I killed this dude by a thermite charge on a hatch. He saw someone and stood right on the charge. 
---
Kills/assists aren't everything, my friend. If they played as vigil they got +10 for every drone decieved. If they played mute they got +10 for drones, breach charges, cluster charges, exothermic charges, xkairos, whatever else jammed. 
---
You did great, but try not to focus on who's "better" score wise. It is a team game :) glad you won and hope you got an alpha pack
---
She looks like a monkey  so she needs monkey hands
---
Why can‚Äôt we just buy the collection item(s) we want instead of the stupid lottery system. By the way I already know the answer. Just venting.  I like the new system a lot, hope we get this permanently.  
---
Looks like i'm going back to copper fellas
---
Tut tut, Ubi didn't even give Dokkaebi her own hands!
---
I like echo as well but it‚Äôs a smart ban. 
---
Right? It's like they try to make her as ugly as possible. This one makes her look like Venom or something
---
God I hope not. 
---
Grim. I don't use the spam, also good enough to counter it, mostly.. saying this I hope they don't f**k any movement mechanics trying to fix this.
---
What
---
Sad face
---
I'd be fine if they had Casual, Ranked, and Ranked: Pro League as I don't much care for the sparse map pool and the Pick and Ban system can be annoying.
---
Mm in casual I think is fine but ranked is pretty broken. 
---
but lean wasn't worked in last year?? 
---
Pretty sure this was made for /r6g/ around season 2/3
---
Good point.
---
I'm on PC. beamerboy-..
---
EU. 
---
Pro league is set up to be balanced,  as to let a teams skill end up coming through.
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt ranked be similar? 
---
You are right! The Lord will be my new attack main.
---
I would disagree that the risk is not worth the reward. Wallhack for 10 seconds for the whole team is huge. You just need to be careful and not interrogate every person you injure
---
Thanks for the info I‚Äôll know for next time
---

well on lesion i don't think lesion needs to be nerfed, rather, the other trap operators get buffed so that they have the same knowledge of where their traps are. And as for the nerfs, i think right now maverick needs to make more noise when his gadget is being used because it's just too quite right now.
---
The files to print out a copy
---
What's your yt? 
---
The 3000000 gives you renown not a pack right? Shooting 30 drones yourself in the new playlist gives you the pack. 
---
I dont feel like its using the casual MMR, at least the players in my casual matches arent that stupid. Here it just feels random. Pick and Ban is great, but the banned operators I've seen so far are mostly hilarious.
---
It actually getting so toxic I dont know if I want to do the invite event/weekly charms any more. This problem and arm shields really fucking make the game ass.
---
No this mode is very bad. Toxic af and boring as hell
---
No team in the world sees a vigil 6th pick to a Doc and go "Aw fuck our whole strat is broken now". Like... MAYBE if you 6th pick on and off of someone super influential like Mira or Shields you could get that effect but it's definitely not a standard occurrence.
---
Nor is it by any means a major impact. It's literally just a case of "Oh they have a \_\_\_\_ instead of a \_\_\_\_" and that's it.  
---
Yes, cause loot boxes shouldnt not take place in a paid game!
---
Thanks to Reddit Silver I've already gotten a girlfriend, a yacht, several very small mangos, interro's left beard and a kick-ass hat.
---
I think the picture here is that Clash is Stronger at arm wrestling therefore she's mocking Maestro (according to her face) and you can see maestro struggling to win
---
Well said. You can count me out of this practice.  
---
Nomad is op and her gadget has no counterplay if set on right spot
---
Don't waste renown on skins at least for me game play first and then accessories, but hey you do you. 
---
Haha you got it for free of course you don't se a wall! I bet if you didn;t get it you would agree with me...
---
Yeah the game mode is amazing and I don't even mind people leaving, but what the fuck I keep being matched with diamond/high plat and this is just not fun
---
I thought she had weird ass lips.
---
To repeat my two examples: Give false info to the enemy team and insult team mates until they kick/kill that player.
---
They should just make this the ranked game mode 
---
So much of this. With some of my credits I already had, and dropping 10 on the game for more packs, I got nothing but charms.
---
10/10.
---
No it‚Äôs only in a special event
---
try logout of uplay and re-login
---
Hardly ruining the experience now calm down buddy I think you‚Äôre just salty over your rank cause you take it too seriously like personally I play the game to meme it up now anyway maybe I‚Äôll see you in matchmaking on my way back up through silver 
---
Its toxic towards fucking everyone
---
I would also like to plug Rising Storm 2 as having excellent shotguns. Suppression is a big mechanic, but shotguns are lethal out pretty far. 
---
The best way to use shotguns in RS2 is flanking, and you can do some damage from a good distance
---
the operation health charm is a nice touch
---
Or just put the MnK console shitbags in the PC servers.  That would be some shit
---
Ubi: Oh look, how many players love this mode.
---
Players: I'm here to get the second pack.
---
Jokes aside.. Before you call me Copper, I'm Gold I. I don't like this mode. It takes long time and they just banning Ela and Valk√ºr for no reason. (Why)
---
I'm here to enjoy the operator what Ubi' released.
---
You think this is good because you hate Blitz you think he is "broken" but you are an Ash main with your 5 speed and No - recoil gun. And your settings are the following: Low Graph, 4:3, 144Hz, 250FPS Right?... No offense. Don't be triggered! And look: You buy the season pass or Elite skin, and start a match... Bamm your operator(s) were banned. So funny ye?... No. I know mate, all of you are a Pro Diamond e -sport players but think about it okay? The current PL players started with the regular ranked system and reached that point where they are. If you want to be a "Pro" player, then do it. If you reached what you wanted, you can play Pick and Ban. As I said: No offense, so don't wish the death of my Mother etc etc... Ubi please, make at least 2 different Ranked modes! One for the PL's and one for us the regular bois.
---
‚ÄôTwas a joke m8

Same here, I wish they could be some time to reconnect to the match before game founds another player to fill. My internet is pretty shitty and it's pretty common for me to get disconnected, even if it goes out for just a few seconds. Any form of recompense would be great
---
I've done it multiple times from archives and ceo sites. Impact from another operator should make it possible from open area. Just leave reinforcing after you make the hole and place the cam

Unfortunately , the SBR one... not that any of the American o es are any better

It getting stuck on the ceiling may not always be a bad thing, considering that you can still blow them up from under.

She may not be 'good' or 'meta' but playing against Cav requires a certain play style that some people simply don't want to deal with.
---
You could say she is just like any other roamer but if she gets a pick on you it could be much more devastating to your team.
---
Coincidence?

The SI Playlist is literally unplayable on console. Every game is full of sweaty KBM diamonds whilst my team is full of controller golds.

Maybe on PC for hackers but on console there is no need. Killcams weren't in ranked at launch, only introduced after hacking became quite an easy back then (no AC other than fair fight

Fair enough point. Usually I only play when my buddies are on so I never personally experienced this and it all is dependent on the situation and skill level of the teams I suppose.

Why aren't people banning Nomad? What she can do can really change up the meta.
---
I really wanted that skin but now I have second thoughts
---
I understand but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd implement it separately. Of course I could be wrong. Another thing is that it could still be used on console to see if someone is exploiting a glitch (like the old blitz or Monty hipfire exploits). Not like they could get banned for it or anything though... 
---
Idk man I just prefer having the killcams. 
---
How are you saving 200 bucks?
---
This is a really awesome idea.
---
You could sell these for basically every game and make bank.
---
Too bad my SSD is behind my motherboard...
---
Exactly.
---
Playstyle?
---
You need an attacker or Defender?
---
Box?
---
No way. If it lets you get rid of global ability cancer it's very welcome.
---
Why are people talking about these? T-Hunt is a waste of time.
---
Why is 3 armor a deterrent form picking shotgun? Anchoring with shotty is extremely powerful and just a few days ago got  an almost ace with rook shotty (one teamkill in enemy team - that is why almost).
---
THE JEANS META HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!
---
Why should I have to avoid playing a game mode because people are assholes?  That's not the proper response.
---
0 reason to have recruit in game at this stage. Leave it in casual maybe but ranked there is no point.
---
Check out AMD ReLive
---
I think he means Savin $200 for an Invitiationals ticket to get the Invitiationals skin which‚Äôs looks exactly like this skin
---
Already completed that challenge. 
---
Only in discovery matches where the skins are set. Not in regular matches. 
---
If you can get past all the glitches and broken shit I liked season 1 the best for some reason lmao.
---
You made two?? 
---
Same. I‚Äôve used the same charm since release and pretty much run no skins on most weapons.
---
Yeah it's your rank that counts.. there are so many seconds accounts that i don't even look at levels anymore
---
They mean lean left and right super fast. I think leaning is fine.
---
I just loved it
---
That's why I wanted to ban him, so we unrestricted in our utility. But noooo he's a useless operator they say.
---
Its super fun
---
They've been smackledorfed!
---
If you play casual 24/7 you are going to encounter people who find tk fun...if u don't like it play ranked if u don't want to do that just don't fucking complain on reddit about it u weeaboo
---
That‚Äôs actually one gun. You use both hands, that‚Äôs the weakness of this OP
---
I did complete them and asked to collect. But didn't get any after clicking collect. Any idea about this?
---
Well your idea is completely retarded. It's meant to get people interested in playing at a more competitive level. Fuck your elitism.
---
Not OP, but thanks for this suggestion - just used it to watch the movie (and I'm in Estonia)
---
For this mode, they should keep Lion banned until his rework is in the live game, just like in Pro League.
---
new :)
---
in High gold headshots are maybe 20% at least in my experience. RN i am gold 3 although I spend most of this season in gold 1. Also I queue with friends who are plat 3/2 ( I don't have plat because they only play 5 stacks and got 30 matches this season and I play solo q and have  371 Matches this season). Furthermore rook armor saved me or my teammates countless time in clutches. After all the player who clutched the round and by the end of it had 5 hp would be rekt without a rook armor.
---
I mean just make RtSI the new ranked mode and replace ‚Äòcasual‚Äô with old rabked mode then it‚Äôll be perfect.
---
At least we can always pick spawn/ point, which is crucial for the tactical aspect of the game.
---
It's cool except for the map pool and the 3 round swap.
---
People already complain that the ranked map pool is stale - what will people say when we have even fewer maps once ranked is updated with these rules?
---
Why is the 3 round swap considered more competitive? In my mind it makes the game more boring and gives whoever gets defence first the opportunity to build a 2-1 or 3-0 lead and finish the game off.
---
Can someone address these questions? I feel like I'm the only one scared that ranked is going to become a sweaty pro-league emulator to the detriment of variety and fun.
---
To their logic, if it's a drawing, it's not a meme.
---
she has dad hands
---
But bc his team mate died 
---
The pick and ban system is great. It is super fun, I definitely think that we should keep it 
---
That completely makes sense
---
Old af
---
Then they should leave the game lol, wrong type of game for them
---
Ash headgear
---
Wanted the Weapon skin, but still have the challenge to complete so there is still a chance 
---
Honestly this is what ruins the game, it's an R rated shooter where you kill people and ubi won't let you say "naughty" words. It's dumb af
---
There i a lot of good people in this community, i am glad i come across them often as a solo player.
---
The removal of AP rounds made it call of duty. I shouldn't need 5 round to someone's chest to drop them. Removal of the supply system was a mistake as well. NWI dropped the ball and it shows. Players are jumping ship due to this. No matter how good it looks, it's broken. Call Of Insurgency: Sandstorm

Honestly, i dont even mind them but its pretty eye opening to see the hatred for them

The barrack Thatcher skin for the l82.
---
I must be really luck because I have well over 2k hours spread across my accounts. About 3/4 cas 1/4 ranked 
---
I'm talking about m&amp;kb which is even worse than modded controllers.

it got removed from the R6 community because it wasn‚Äôt related to Rainbow Six Siege
---
He forces you to play red light green light and if you don't he gets a real time location of your entire body. Lion combined with Fuze is terrifying.
---
Yeah true
---
Yes, Blitz, Lion, Cav and Lesion are quite often banned. 
---
Pulse is already an operator..?
---
Hibana has great guns and utility, and all around pretty solid
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the only good auto pistol now ahaha
---
Good communication but when will you fix ranked you ghouls? Its been 3 years for gods sake do something about it. Oh wait you are busy nerfing caveira cuz the copper plays cried about it. Instead of fixing ranked where 5 sweaty tryhards sitting in discord get matched vs 5 solo players. 
---
You are a bunch of trolls sitting in an office getting paid for drinking coffee. What are you guys even thinking?

What do think about when u get up at 10am?

---
Thermite skin
---
Lion isn't automatically banned by the game they just aren't allowed to pick it. I spoke to KS about it and he said that if someone idle picked and got given lion they would have to use their sixth pick to swap it out. 
---
1- same format as a different game mode isn't more content. Content remains the same unless you are a YouTuber with a 5 stack that plays r6tm for a living.
---
2- this playerbase might have 35 million accounts, but it doesn't have 35 million players. A much smaller number are online, and with queue times already reaching 5 miniutes on ranked, last thing you would want is to double or triple that time.
---
3- as for banning and not being able to play, you aren't going to see that happen to balanced ops other than Mira or echo. It's called shuffling the strats, even in solo. All you need is text chat. Even mic isn't mandatory for pick and ban. the real benefit to pick and ban is banning broken/Op ops still in the boot camp phase, and to ban ops that are annoying. This means you can't just stick to your favourite Ash, and now you'll have to take the "trouble" of being versatile, something this playerbase below plat desperately needs.
---
4- again, irrespective of having abundance of resources, it rather obvious and but natural and simple math that bug fixes will be quicker with 2 game modes than when focused on 3. There is absolutely no positive benefit to dividing the playerbase and resources, even if you had more than enough.
---
Why else did you think outbreak didn't last long? It's not just it lacking repeatability, it's that it is illogical to allocate resources into something that isn't the core of the game, and the core of this game is pro league, and pro league based gameplay, which whether you like it or not, is going to be the future of ranked, as promised by them themselves when pick and ban first came.
---
Yeah I just shit my pants when I saw the c4. You lucked out big time.
---
I'm just going to be that guy and point out that they added the Beta statusquo to ranked in Y1S2. What does this mean? Nothing
---
Add rank based casual... Bronze players dont want play against Plats and Diamond at 90%...thats why no bronze and copper players in casual
---
Wait
---
Use thot, that word doesn‚Äôt get reviewed.
---
There is a thing that if they disconnect while you interrogate you still get the interrogation!
---
Well I didn't think about that. I would use them as key replacements (single keys) so nothing illegal. However, if I'm gonna get banned for no reason I will use my normal keys.

---
5 que can be an option for all ranked modes, i don't mind, but people will mind if they look in straight 8min+ for a match with 5. Toxic 3 people can fuck up your experience on every mode in a 5man team game. its nothing special for the new mode.
---
And remove vote kick.
---
I like these. This are good suggestions.
---
A really big recon disruption coming right up
---
i don‚Äôt think i can get that on the AMD 5 2400
---
This so toxic.The sentiments of this post touched me inappropriately.
---
I hate how people waste bans on blitz and cav instead of banning ops that will introduce a difference into the playstyle. For instance banning a echo, or Hibana
---
It's actually 7 seconds.
---
People really need to understand this.
---
I think the intent is to resist lazy content. At least there's some effort in a drawing for a joke
---
But if you bought it on uplay not steam then you cannot do that I don't think
---
Wsa it the actual Beaulo or someone imitating him with a nick like BeauIo? I met a SecretIy.Chaos in ranked the other day.
---
I play in a 4 stack (because our 5th member passed) so even if we all pick no vote, some rando gets the pick and it would end up like ranked, playing the same sites.
---
Try reinstalling it through Powershell
---
Yo can we also Mayne work on ban appeals or forgiveness? No, okay. 
---
Yeah that's probably it, til
---
This. 100% this. 
---
Oh please. As soon as hear that Lion activating sound the entire attacking team knows they can push aggressively just as a coordinating team would. 
---
Is it as effective? Not at all. Is it still fucking annoying and broken? Absolutely.
---
The operator itself is overpowered. It needs its rework.
---
Homie the whole point was to NOT play recruit because he is a liability.
---
No thanks, but your suggestion is a bad idea and goes against what the point of the game is.
---
Bro stop being such a casual try hard pleb /s
---
Thank God it's not overwatch, you can bet your ass they would've just made a reveal how she's transgender. Not that there's anything wrong with it, it's just that it's getting annoying over there on how they're just catering to the dumbasses on their forums who want every single character to be LGBT.
---
Ugh, thank you, that‚Äôs what I wanted to know. It sucks I can‚Äôt do that, I just want my operators back haha 
---
I have a 250gb SSD with os on it and I *barely* fit r6 on it, I have about 5 gigs left rn
---
Just cause some people cant counter spawnpeeking?
---
It's a common glitch where the game won't put you in the channel of your teammates causing you to not be able to hear or speak to them via VOIP. It happens randomly and for me I usually restart the game whenever it appears to fix it.
---
I guess they did that so they don't lose money that way, but yea it sucks
---
Console or PC?
---
Best  tips for splo?
---
Yeah Buckthatbang, Thisismy3rdacct, and Grannywitagun was in the lobby
---
??? The reason there aren't as many players is because the game costs almost 4x as much as insurgency source. Most guns are one hit kills against no armour, and ap ammo was such a pointless balance decision because it was essentially mandatory to perform well. The only guns that take more than 3 hits to kill are smgs and handguns against heavy armor at long range. You're being hyperbolic.
---
you are asking because you think we were both in the same game? we probably werent. no one was speaking, except me and my brother (we were in a party, no one could hear us), and no one else was speaking. so i heard no complaints from hackers. we were up against 2 unranked players and 3 crouch spammers (2 plats, 1 diamond). i think the opposition team won 4-0.
---
Because the other team can‚Äôt do it either so you see them come up with new ways to attack
---
^^
---
I'll admit that I like keeping it on for the occasional memes. Like there were two games yesterday where both teams agreed to ban Thermite and Hibana just for fun. I wouldn't have picked up on that without text chat on.
---
I can't find the Discovery Playlist anywhere. I am on Xbox. Can someone tell me how to access the Road To SI event?

I don't remember usernames, while defending I was maestro, I placed my one evil eye on a pillar near main entrance and halfway up the stairs by skylight

I think grim sky is the only one that didn't follow that in recent memory, but even those skins weren't too great.

that means free kills, a lot time lion activate dron, enemy team start be egdy and rush  mindless and died like noob

Pretty accurate 
---
I remembered I read somewhere that if something has no duplicate and if you spend a sum of money you will get everything, that can get away from the gambling accusation.
---
99% people would tell you they want to buy their items directly, but sadly maximizing revenue says no. People that want them will pay up for it, people that want them but cannot pay up for it will suck it up and move on. It's not like they will stop playing the game, they still do.
---
sorry to break it to you but ash + crouch/lean spam vs others doing the same with much "harder" guns to control isn't the same thing
---
You are in the minority that is composed of just you and probably just one other dude.
---
Ubi also sad they are going to work on reducing 4 miniutes down, and trying to make casual a training ground to ranked. So whether you like it or not, casual will reach ranked, and seeing how this pro league list is out, that might happen sooner than you think.
---
So I don't know whether this is a troll post or not, but you best start enjoying your 4 minutes and counting down your casual days, cause it's gonna be gone.
---
&gt;In this regard, casual sometimes actually forces you to think in a new way.
---
Except you can't actually make strats for those sites because you don't know which one it will pick before you choose an operator. Making it completely pointless to randomize the site.
---
CZ is a beast and it's a pleasure to use, it has a very satisfying recoil and can tear appart anyone in seconds, screw the Bearing-9.
---
i hope the esports guys complain about Blitz. seems the only way Ubisoft fix anything is if they complain.
---
If you pick no vote, it means you are ok with anything. So why should the rando's pick bother you? You are, after all, not voting, so you are ok with whatever comes.
---
Sounds ironic and self contradictory.
---
So its just a temp mode. Thank you.
---
Right so you think Lion is balanced???
---
i bought the whole collection, but what happens in if i still complete this challenge 
---
A decent number of people.
---
Or you could play with a different group
---
Poor cav.
---
Not gunna lie, idk what that is. I‚Äôm very new to pc lol

ofc not, he need rework but he isn't that op as ppl crying about

It's because they likely just reskinned the glove model with a bare hands texture. They forgot that gloves add bulk though, as her bare hands should be a bit thinner.
---
Truth.
---
Hey, I only agree. The game would be better without such mechanics and such players.
---
But see that's the other thing
---
All my close friends play without being too focused on skill, but all the other people I've come in contact with who don't fit that category burst my ear drums upon their death.
---
I use a macro for keys on my mouse like melee and gadget and haven‚Äôt been banned. I use it because I can‚Äôt map those buttons directly in game so I use it to press V for example. 
---
thank you, and yeah I noticed that I did mess up on the fingers but it wasn‚Äôt until after I painted it I noticed

What's ultimate freezing?

For cheapt turtle becah recon 50 is quite good

Got the thatcher headgear
---
thank you!
---
Nevermind I didn't think this many people felt this way, props to you for linking all of them

Interesting, not that many people even play monty
---
Its temp but its most likely a test to see how community reacts to it so they know is implementing it to ranked a good idea.
---
thanks üòé
---
Universal gun skin, the rare (epic?); I can't complain.
---
Cool story bro
---
It has Matchmaking. It uses your hidden Casual MMR, which is different from your ranked MMR. If you play more, you'll get grouped in your skill level. /u/PuhTayter for you too.
---
Yep I have had the hyperx clouds for over 3 years now and they still work great.
---
This honestly makes my siege experience really bad because I can‚Äôt get kills
---
You‚Äôll get renown when you open the packs.
---
Quite a generalization there. I want some items, I have the money, but I won't get the packs.
---
I love it. Let's you plan defense better. Let's you learn from your mistakes faster becuase you go back to defending. Usually we forget after switching.
---
Playing shite Ops in plat because plats are scared is great
---
You tell your friend to stop being a toxic cunt. Or you shoot your friend before they have that chance 
---
Blackbeard but it Doesn‚Äôt scare them but instead just makes them mad and call me a hacker or a meta abuser 
---
Welp I haven‚Äôt watched a pro league game yet that banned Monty and blitz over a single hard breach. Yet. Idk I just like the G2 approach to everything, tactful and careful. This meta is shit and needs to change
---
In my opinion, maverick, jackal, caveira and kaid should be top choices for bans.
---
Then just have it load in a few Recruit player models so if someone joins during the prep phase they spawn in as a Recruit with Default Loadout.
---
Not home right now but I‚Äôll try it once I am 
---
Everyone says they hate it because its the "cool thing" to do. Pineapple on pizza is really good
---
well because it's not available of course it is a bug lol
---
Yes, my friend.
---
Thats what i started doing after i got my 30 drones
---
i didn't see a single person play kaid in over 30 matches, and blitz and lion is usually the ban mix
---
Ah yes how could I forget. My bad
---
That wouldn't be a bad idea
---
Yeah, i've experienced something similar too, just today.
---
With 6 to win instead of 4
---
Shield melee us uber strange. I've had shields that were like butter to a defenders knife and I've had shield melees that felt like energy swords. Personally melee only makes me mad when I fail a clutch. Other times idc about it being broken. Headshot through shield tho will always upset me. 
---
No I don't drone in that gamemode.
---
We need more people like that in this community 
---
For me it's usually mav and cav. At the same tine, i am playing in Europe so there's that
---
This is a god awful analogy for many reasons, but okay.
---
How about fix the whole hit reg first then go from there. You haven‚Äôt even released that patch and you‚Äôre moving on like it‚Äôs not the biggest problem in the game which has been here since launch.

Hello Natruux1234567, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ak3ydx/pdw_or_c7e/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Omg that has happened to me so many times
---
It someone kills you with Ash, 9 times out of 10 you are dead regardless of the op. Headshots 1 hit kill and there are plenty of high fire rate or high damage guns on offense to match with the RC-4. It's a hard reality to accept the enemy got the better of you but when you realize it you can start improving. Other attackers provide ways to frag through utility and defenders have all sorts of ways to stop an Ash and prevent a rush.
---
 Funny how everybody cried about the SMG-11 getting nerfed even though it made Smoke way too strong with fragging power and utility. But Smoke isn't a meme like Ash so xddddd
---
i'm playing in the eu as well and i'm sure that lion and cav are the most banned ops by a long shot
---
Don‚Äôt join enemy parties dumbass, is it wrong of them yes, but you let the do it
---
So for someone like myself who hasn't committed alot or time into this would these new playlists actually get me hooked again 
---
facts 
---
Sounds like a pretty sick idea tbh. I'd take one...or three...
---
Stalin would be proud 
---
Personally I think you should swap every round. Sometimes you have a game where everyone wins on defense or everyone wins on attack. Meaning the team that starts with that advantage only has to win one extra round to win
---
depends on the team  comp, me and my 5 stack always run a thatcher or an iq, so echo never seems to be a problem, and my frinds have played long enough that we can spot the echo drone while invisible unless the rooms really dark

You can‚Äôt shoot their feet if they‚Äôre hitting it lmao. Unless they‚Äôre standing directly in front of the barricade hitting it which literally no one does. 12 seconds wasted means nothing with 0 roamers, they will be on site in 12 seconds basically.
---
Not all of us are of colour sir
---
Asshole
---
Got the Dokkaebi Uniform from my first pack, then got Dokkaebi Headgear from my second pack.    
---
Guess the game wants me to play more Dokkaebi.
---
yeah... it looks so bad.
---
Castle barricades are never used to waste time they are used to block angles and crossfire 
---
It‚Äôs worth considering that this time they‚Äôre giving out 5 free packs in total, which is a fifth of the entire collection. It‚Äôs much more likely that you‚Äôll get what you want out of the free ones in comparison to previous collections.
---
Hmm... intresting...
---
Why are people so lazy
---
We like roamers and don‚Äôt like having our feet sniffed. 
---
did the same on consulate, was a pain to attack sites in general
---
also if they do adopt it i hope they keep killcams and assist xp :/
---
Yes
---
Well it‚Äôs not exactly pay to win so I don‚Äôt see the problem man
---
i've always had this issue with casual on ps4 :/
---

Nice bro.
---
I got the thatcher body gear first try 
---
No thanks. New charms are much better.
---
But you chose the worst one just to get upvotes.
---
yep, i still use it on all my guns
---
You pay money to have nails that look almost identical to regular nails, but they're shiny
---
Not related to this sub 
---
&gt; For example: "we fucked up here and here, let's do it better and win next round". 
---
i agree but this is when you actually communicate with your team tho,in most cases in ranked people not even use chat to communicate making what you are saying impossible to achieve with random people.
---
Those hands give me dead island vibes 
---
I guess other people have been getting lucky because I‚Äôm finding it to be worse and more toxic then causal which sucks 
---
Does anybody know when this "event" finishes cause im unable to get on and i dont want too miss the new skins. (I get home in 2 days)
---
Thanks man! Appreciate the comment!
---
Activate the event 
---
I chose the first one I saw smh , and they are all the same 2d looking design  anyway
---
I think it's about time Ubisoft paid for a few courses for their artists to learn some female anatomy:
---
* Valkyrie
---
* Hibana
---
* Clash
---
* Dokkaebi
---
When will the horrors end?
---
Casual shouldn't have bans. The point of casual is to do whatever you want and fuck around with operators and loadouts, and banning operators goes directly against that.
---
It's really stable, I just wish ADSing didnt block half of my screen
---
Even if you dont have a group of friends to play with, theres subs for finding people to play with, as well as other services like GamerLink. 
---
Why not? U lose nothing from droning and giving up ur drone
---
Is this not already a thing?
---
Was ist dein Ingame Name? Ich glaub wir haben gegen euch gespielt.
---
Blitz, Hibana, Echo and Mira........there I said it 
---
Wide
---
Ok thats good to know, thanks!
---
Clash.
---
i think of her as a not-so-often used operator
---
thats why they made the spsmg full auto
---
they are trying to increade the people trying her out
---
sorry if i‚Äôm late to the party, but what‚Äôs happening here? thanks in advance. 
---
It doesn't use ranked MMR (it uses casual mmr) so all you guys complaining about 'plats and diamonds' are citing a rank it doesn't even use...

holy fuck.
---
GOD HAS ANSWERED MY CALL 
---
Ja a nasty boi
---
Haha
---
Pro league doesn't have killcams the playlist follow pro league rules
---
I WANT THIS MODE TO BE IMPLEMENTED 
---
Yes. 
---
I'm a firm believer that kills in terms of numbers don't matter in this game but if they are going to be listed regardless they should go to the correct people and I think in this case it's the person who downed them.
---
There could be an argument for a dmg based system determining who guys credit but I think this would be the best idea with the current system we have. 
---
At most the only thing that I think could be added is a downed symbol added to the killfeed for when a player kills a downed player  to prevent confusion over people thinking they got a kill they didn't actually get with this system in place. 
---
He isnt op if you dont know how to use him or cant communicate. But on a good team he is op.
---
Sweet
---
What are the specs on your PC? And get the full version. It‚Äôs much better in the long run. 
---
Just think of it as $50 for the weapon skin and the rest is free lol
---
who the fuck plays cav in ranked. im a cav main and i dont play her in ranked
---
I'd rather ban him instead of caveira. I don't play her but banning her is just laziness to me. Drone the map and you make her your bitch
---
Stand still so that the enemy can preform your ass. Perfect counter!
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty easy to counter. An Ash/Zofia charge will take it out, but it will make the enemies think twice/expend utility before pushing up the stairs
---
Old ones are too busy and over complicated for a small charm.
---
New ones are simple and minimalistic, yet still look great.
---
My thoughts on the matter.
---
Hello DangerDan127, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ak4r1k/new_main_menu_screen/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The gun skin is nice, but holy hell the headgear on that bundle is AWFUL. I've legit only seen ONE person use it - and they got TK'd by a teammate for it.
---
You know what? I just give up. You're probably a troll, and if not, then it doesn't matter anyway, as the discussion ends here. There's nothing to talk with you about anymore.
---
Ps4 or xbox? Im silver 1, but i like to think im a mid to high gold player. Pros say rank doesnt determine skill!
---
Pick/ban is fucking stupid and it's literally the equivalent of your asshole friend making you use the madkatz controller.
---
No it's not [source](https://twitter.com/ItsEpi/status/1088861860705771523)
---
Hello brothers
---
My casual mmr is around silver 2s and they like to ban blitz, lion, cav. Those 3 were the most popular bans. 
---
Oh boy people are getting better at the game, better lower the skill cap
---
How is destroying 30 drones a hard grind?
---
The lazer soight XD
---
I wouldn't mind buying them with r6 credits if they would let us pick what we want instead of this whole alpha packs bs that is right now. Just add a buy option for each item in the collection menu.
---
Exactly why i love banning can. I can't even count the matches just this month where at least 2 teammates would get interrogated and not make a single callout about it leaving me royally fucked. Solo queuing is just cancerous in general. No one uses a mic on console.
---
BLITZ IS GONE ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Ya the pros are wrong and you are right. There is a reason Lion is currently not even pick or ban-able in pro league... but nah this PS4 player has got it figured out gents, just git gudder!
---
CLAP
---
Sometimes that bug is selective too. Maybe it‚Äôs my guns that don‚Äôt make a sound, maybe it‚Äôs lion‚Äôs gadget or the phone calls from dokkaebi, maybe the door or window‚Äôs barricade is broken without a sound and the person who broke them enters with footsteps that don‚Äôt register any noise. It just baffles me that so many sound glitches/errors have been in the game for so long, and now the original one from the game‚Äôs launch is getting worse.
---
he is strong in ranked though, the win delta doesn‚Äôt do that justice. Ash isn‚Äôt overpowered, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect someone who still says ‚Äòcod boys‚Äô to understand that. Ash brings nothing to the table that is ban worthy, she‚Äôs literally just a comfort pick with the 3 speed and good weapon. 
---
Looks cool, and I‚Äôm glad you put gloves on her caveman hands ;P
---
Ranked
---
Someone said that in a video but I just can't remember who
---
Not that I know of. It might be. 
---
And gave her man hands 
---
Only if you queue with them.
---
Castle 
---
Its cool i already got the universal skin lol
---
It should just replace ranked, not be added. Allow secure and hostage alongside bomb and call it a day Ubisoft.
---
You can win a 1v1 against monty if you are playing bomb which is the most balanced mode.
---
ikr her nails are gross too
---
because casual matchmaking couldn't care less what rank you are
---
I just want to make sure I'm getting this, you used the global chat to try and make the enemies think a teammate was saying that Ying was planting?
---
Also don‚Äôt forget the wrong windows on fortress
---
Let's all beg for this to becomes the new ranked mode. It's so much better. Make ranked casual, and add an arcade playlists for casuals. 
---
Press enter twice before every point you make so it's easier to read. 
---
Thank Thor.
---
This has been killing experience for us in recent weeks. There's no negative to leaning back and forth repeatedly half a dozen times. Players retain perfect aim and speed. Same for crouching up and down. You shouldn't be able to shoot well at all if you double tap it.
---
I got a callout that he was behind desk, so I aimed there. Plus, I had already sprayed that corner before, so I didn‚Äôt think he would have over there. But yeah, it was super lucky
---
i wish.. played regular ranked and wanted to kill myself
---
Not really if you are out with a cheater it doesn‚Äôt really matter if you queued with them or not, you still have to report them otherwise it is some form of boosting 
---
They could totally use some of the new ops for that
---
Is this in casual or are they doing a apraxia event?
---
Already did. I actually just finished up another game and it showed up. Not sure why or how, but 2 hours later I got it. 
---
I see surprising amounts of Kaid here, but he's not a big deal honestly. If he electrifies walls, you deal with it just like you would with a Bandit; and there are very few hatches he can electrify that Thermite cannot open (and even then, Thatcher deals with it).
---
&gt;Also, what does Pulse‚Äôs charm say?
---
Hibana.
---
this is not that terrible of a strat
---
**BR√ñTHER**
---
I didn‚Äôt buy a pack, but I honestly think that they could have done these better, like make them worth renown. I know it‚Äôs a big source of income, but cutting a part of the player base that doesn‚Äôt want to open their wallets out isn‚Äôt right
---
Lol what?
---
why do you think this is a good idea lmaoo
---
I firstly thinked that this is Kojima...
---
It's all about preference.  I find the default fine, but other people probably hate it. 
---
Dunno lmao I don't use windows 10 I just assumed it's an illegal copy 
---
Shields are close to being the strongest ops in the game, when played correctly and with a bit of team coordination. Shields can just push with almost no droning and you can't kill them, whereas everyone else dies from one bullet. You can't prevent a plant when a shield is there, you can't hold a room when a shield is pushing it with a friend or two etc.  
---
tl;dr Shields are extremely hard to play against and extremely easy to win with, if the shield player knows what they're doing. Shields are "weak" only in low rank play. I know this, as I play a decent amount of Monty whenever enemies play toxic comps.
---
Select ‚ÄúMore Challenges‚Äù on the daily challenge tab. Scroll to the bottom and view details and add the very bottom 2 challenges that correspond to the weekend event. Then hop into the new game mode and hope you get defense first as drone kills only count in that game mode. Not casual or ranked.
---
Cel shaded gun skins would be amazing. The Valk one is my favourite skin in the game.
---
I'm using my spawnpeeking scenario as an anchor around my explanation for why I think the anti toxicity system is flawed in general
---
He‚Äôs as old as my father
---
Your wish is granted, but the skin is now a legendary in an alpha pack with a .1% drop rate
---
Thank you ubi
---
I mean a well placed thatcher takes care of basically everything
---
I don't really have any issues with the machine pistols :/
---
To me every operation has good and bad things about them except operation chimera that one can die in hole for all I care 
---
2FA (at least for ranked) could work like they're using (or maybe just testing?) on PC regarding smurfs. However, that level 30 who's plat will be put with plats in ranked, though, just like they would if they were level 100 - it's only when the account is new that it can be frustrating, but no more than at the start of a season when there's like a million people all at the same MMR. (Okay, probably not a *million...* wait, maybe? I dunno how many people play this game rip.)
---
Regarding matchmaking into games with diamonds, casual works in the same way as ranked with MMR and whatnot but the scores are hidden (and different to the ranked ones, importantly). A lot of diamonds are diamond *only* because they play in a 5-stack because at that level teamwork is required (fair enough). When on their own in casual, all it says is you're close to their level when playing more casually (i.e., for players at higher levels, when on your own and whatnot). I've had the same issues, although less so (mostly plats and the occasional diamond for me) and I've found that there are people who I'm much better than, the matchmaking is just quite diverse. While frustrating, playing with better players is the only way to get better imo and it keeps matchmaking times down.
---
There's no way, other than reporting them and whatnot, to get rid of throwers, though - they're the real problem in this area in my opinion.
---
Meanwhile every person I play against crouch spams like they have it scripted on their PC's
---
sorry for the dumb question, but how do I access the new playlists? The site says it is under a discovery playlist menu but I kind find it anywhere on xbox
---
He is just trying to get those calories burnt on his brand new apple watch
---
He‚Äôs just annoying as fuck, shields overall need a nerf
---
This is console in a nutshell 
---
Every game I've played he was banned
---
Wait is this issue on the side of ubisoft i thought it was a client side issue and personal based on the players computer and internet. 
---
That‚Äôs what happened the next game lmao 
---
nope and i dont think they plan on making this a feature maybe just maybe we will be able to transfer elites one day
---
I'm pretty that's just the community as a whole. Not just one rank 
---
Also, going after my age seems pretty toxic tbh and I bet you eat oranges for money
---
Not really. Normal ops still have a good weapon that you have to be cautious of. Cav has a nonlethal pistol and the shittiest primaries in the universe.
---
Seriously? Do you know how many leavers are in this gamemode? They die once and then dip. I‚Äôd rather it be like ranked where they at least get punished. 
---
True, but Ubisoft should either have a way to detect that or let us kick / surrender in ranked
---
Thanks, I'll see to it!
---
14 years old confirmed.
---
Why does sledge get a giant black bar 
---
" Was the alternative to just let him spawnpeek me " - You said it in your post in the way I did understand you were defender and teamkilled him, so my bad on this, I see you did edit on that. Yet calling him cunt because IN YOUR OPINION you think spawnpeeking is scummy is not a good thing, like LatexSmoke said.  
---
I am also not a follower of the chat filter and I would like to let my emotions go and say something(even when I do not need this, I like to have a possibility), but making the community and the world itself better is starting to hold back some words we would like to say and let it go - which means you should just say it in mind and not write it.  
---
Anyway I do not look at this situation like I was looking with the "teamkill" in mind. I think saying that one word is not that terrible, but also not necessary. Wish you all non toxic words or behavior.
---
Yes invitationals are back

Hello ellieisherenow, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ak5jb0/i_cant_play_ranked_with_these_people/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Honestly, it's my opinion your whole upper body should be showing if you're leaning around a corner. All these little pixel corner peeks by leaning are just absolutely asinine. 
---
Saw that several times today. I got recruit once too
---
You're entitled to your own fantasies
---
Its all in playstyle really, golds are headless chickens mostly I think. Plats at gonna stop and think, low golds just panic and run about.
---
Mute 
---
Yea have a time out action that kicks a player if they keep a game loading for more that 5 or 10 minutes
---
Big fan of your flair by the way, glad to see another man of culture on this sub
---
Probably the time needed and casual feel to the playlist. If the teams doesn‚Äôt have majority-rule for the bans, the whole ban phase lasts 2 minutes. With this more casual feel to it and lots of people without mics, multiple people will choose a meme operator and not be able to 6 pick away. This seems the best intro to pro league rules, and might make an easier transition down the line to implement op reveal and 6 pick.
---
What‚Äôs was your favorite play style during season 1?
---
Thanks you my P90 brother 
---
I play pretty passive and conservative, on defence I don‚Äôt roam very much and on offence I am very careful and guard tight angles
---
Red Crow even though the bugs were awful on ps4 lmaoo they even had to remove hibana from the game for a day but its still the lost fun i‚Äôve had in a season
---
You know, and his 2 invisible cams. And his ACOG. As Kix put it, even if Echo never uses his drones, the teammates  can still make callouts from it.                   
---
Saying hes purely for plant denial is absurd. Echo just got overbuffed.
---
I unfortunately do have them, because they are really hard to control on console in my opinion. Btw can you give me some tips in terms of playing Monty? I want to play him a bit more cause he seems fun and I've seen a few Montys cleaning house. C;
---
Hmm.. there could be lots of reasons? First of all, have you updated all of your drivers?
---
Usually on Xbox it‚Äôs on the main menu screen in the bottom right corner of the screen. If it doesn‚Äôt show up, quit the game and check for updates, then reset the Xbox for good measure. 
---
I do the same, but I also put them on LMGs. Since they tend to be weaker weapons, I will start spraying as I ADS. The laser makes it more accurate for the split second before I'm fully ADS'ed. Granted, LMGs are "off-meta" to begin with, but I have a soft spot for Capitao's and Zofia's, plus Ying and Maestro don't have another ranged option.
---
Feels bad man
---
Wanna talk about it?
---
Was it on clubhouse? I played that match. 
---
Same in ranked
---
U cant hear from across the map. U cant hear anything in this game correctly cuz the sounds are fucked up thats not a secret
---
I love this 
---
Did u play with HandlessFreak
---
Imagine how annoying it is to join a casual game and it‚Äôs 3-0 and you have 2 other people on your team. Now make it ranked. 
---
Thanks for understanding after I clarified, and I guess if I don't get banned I'll vent in future by saying nonsense and watching people perceive it as offensive
---
I‚Äôll play this when there no vote to kick system. Took the defuser for spawn. Team mate killed me and then proceeded to kick me in the first round.
---
The same time as pc but we don't have an ETA on it
---
Teach me your ways
---
I agree with that
---
it‚Äôs literally in the patch notes for next patch. try reading the patch notes next time 
---
Ah, fair point, and i was soloing for those games too so
---
Have you not seen the videos all over the sub of people shooting through shields?
---
Is that someone's username, if so I'm not sure 
---
Lion has too much of a bad reputation. Yes, he can be an incredibly annoying op paired with other locating ops, like Jackal or Dokkaebi. But (Can't speak for high ranks, as my highest rank is fucking gold 2) most people don't do that. AGAIN: I can't speak for Diamonds and Platinums or Pro League since I don't watch Pro League. But in my experiences in Gold or under, he is really not that bad at all.
---
- On and off Lion main
---
(And just so you can hate me more im also a glaz main but not blitz, fuck blitz mains)
---
As Bandit main, I think Twitch mains deserve nothing but burn in hell
---
It's because he's fucking useless since hatches are his claim to fame and thermite can just place his breach charge beside the electrified hatch. So what's the point in picking Kaid when you can have bandit with better guns and weapons?
---
I personally hate almost all of them 
---
the matchmaking this season even before the new gamemode has been awful
---
they are. 
---
Watch loads and loads of videos. Get\_Flanked has a lot of good stuff for beginners. Once you feel comfortable with the mechanics and stuff, start watching Pro League and take mental notes on the stuff they do.
---
But she‚Äôs so fastttt and so smallll
---
on 2 3 in ranked
---
your teammates mustve been really mad
---
No, that is not a thing, as much as I wish it was. 
---
I wouldve popped him in his old ass fucking skull. Fuck crouch spammers man. 
---
Happieness noise
---
But we already completed the community challenge
---
I see your point but in atleast my opinion Ash works just fine and ain't frustrating to play against 
---
40.0 feet ‚âà 12.2 metres ^(1 foot ‚âà 0.3m)
---
Sure :) Have a great day. Or night. It's 1 AM here.
---
there is no "better", it's literally preference and how you play them
---
that does nothing for me, this is still not your photo 
---
Maverick, Jackal, Vigil IMO
---
r/didanyoneask 
---
Cav is always banned, I don‚Äôt really see Blitz being banned
---
I'll save you the next point in your playbook and call myself a npc for you. 
---
Its probably packet loss, do you play on wifi or wired?
---
As a Mute main, I agree
---
Bandit wants to know your location
---
My teams always ban Lion, Blitz, and Cav. It's annoying af because no one at my level can get any value out of lion (we're talking 2 drone scans at the beginning of the round for "intel"). People freak our about blitz and cav bit they're really not that bad. Better off banning Echo, Maestro, Valkyrie, Mira, Glaz, Snackbeard, or Hibana. Plus w/ lion you can usually count on the other team banning him if you don't. 
---
The past 8 times I‚Äôve done this playlist I‚Äôve had bronze low leveled teammates while the other teams gold and above level 100.
---
Matchmaking is fucked.
---
Every new bit of clash art is trying to make her look uglier and uglier
---
This literally happened in my last match
---
Honestly, I think it depends on how they are played and if they're played with a coordinated team. Like Lion is very op with a coordinated team but if you use him with no coordination he is bad. And blitz is just quite op all around.
---
As long as it's not in ranked. (Please tell me this wasn't in ranked)
---
Imagine banning Cav
---
Eh I still feel like it's a wasted ban and banning Echo/Lesion will be a much better choice.
---
But I guess we can't really tell people what to do and if they decide to waste their ban, we can just punish them for it
---
clash. needs. the. ban. or. a. nerf. that. doesnt. make. her. impossible. to. kill. in. 1v1. situations. with. no. grenades. or. nitro. cells.
---
Blitz and lion got snapped
---
Reverse card
---
you called
---
That was the hope but he was a little too far away 
---
Dust line and Skull Rain had the best charms no doubt about it. The new ones look so boring and uninteresting. They're literally just the season's logo and the metal you got in ranked. Sometimes the logo doesn't even change colours making it look out of place. (Like the left image shown, would have been nicer if the whole thing was at least plat and there was no black boarder around it). Plus not to mention the old two charms looked REALLY nice in plat and diamond.
---
I‚Äôve seen Fuze and Hibana get banned more than Lion
---
As a Mira main, I agree
---
Thatcher would never have a lazer sight SMH SO UNREALILISTIC
---
Then on defense Echo and Caveira.
---
You can text mute specific people 
---
Doesn‚Äôt say they have to be standing. Find or make an enemy DBNO and it should work if you place the breach charge close enough.
---
Don't you dare touch my Mave daddy.
---
I played against a recruit in the event so I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôre forced recruit
---
Tell your friend to go back to fortnite 
---
other than to remove some toxicity, this change wouldn't effect the gameplay other than to remove some toxic arguments knightbell was talking about
---
Hibana - good breacher with distance.
---
Jackal - all round good op, gadget and gun.
---
Lesion - useful op to slow down offence
---
Not my proudest nut
---
Better than my chances of getting a black ice... I'll take it
---
That moment when you realize that torsos, arms, legs, even hands and feet exist in siege, and guess what? They make up most of the operator's bodies, making them a prime target for 90% of the playerbase who don't have the aim to the level of Beaulo. What a revelation! 
---
All sarcasm if it wasn't obvious enough
---
Hibana, jackal, lesion, vigil 
---
That could have been a match with me, but the odds aren't that crazy,  you on ps4?
---
What do you guys think? he is making a really big sledge kill compilation, I thought it was pretty funny!: [https://www.twitch.tv/mrpriceo0](https://www.twitch.tv/mrpriceo0)
---
this workload is nothing. BF4 was a disaster and DICE LA worked their ass off for 2 years and fixed most issues. Siege has less problems and it takes forever for Ubisoft to fix anything, and even then it seems big problems are only ever addressed when esports start crying about it.
---
Ok
---
But every player I encountered few past weeks? That sounds a bit stretched...
---
Not anymore. 
---
Fuze is one of the weakest operators out there, his gadget is easy to avoid, he‚Äôs slow and clunky too. Only thing he has really going for him is a extremely good assault rifle it‚Äôs insane how good it is but as it‚Äôs on a 3 armour it‚Äôs not that good.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what my match was like, last two were Cav and clash
---
The one with the theme park, it's when I bough r6
---
I didn't know we were getting one each weekend. That sounds like a decent deal, especially since you can get more through challenges
---
Yes, jem.
---
Nice 
---
But almost every player in my games for the past few weeks? Why is everyone using party chat all of a sudden?
---

That's why I almost TK'd him and didn't go through with it.

I'm literally having this problem too i don't care about the game anymore i just want some drones

Dokkaebi Asian&gt;White

Still looks cool though

M870.... on the test server.
---
They changed them ages ago 
---
I‚Äôve had the same voice com trouble, where can I find the extended services in settings?
---
Did they add pick/ban to ranked?
---
New mode? Sorry must have missed the update.
---
So if I‚Äôm using a button in my mouse for gadgets I can get banned? 
---
It says 0 
---
There‚Äôs nothing there 
---
this, is the largest of oofs
---
Yep, Fuze is underwhelming. His speed, deploy time, and loud deploy sound make him really bad. He's only usfuel against people without any awareness. 
---
Idk I use all his weapons. I just think his gadget needs to be nerfed. It's not fair to encounter, even with a Jager
---
I like the playlist but the lack of killcams is driving me insane.
---
My brother and I play on ps4 and yesterday he banned The Mighty Chanka, maybe you were in the same match.
---
They dont show up in the feed for some reason. Go through and check each character
---
Man hands
---
Shouldve Messaged Him To Leave ü§î
---
literally everyone i play ranked with have bomb as the only mode enabled and queue times aren't long for me (gold 2)
---
I also don't understand how this would reduce the number of ranked players.
---
Did that 
---
If you‚Äôre talking about speaking then I feel you but I‚Äôm talking about how no one can hear you.
---
Yeah when I was getting my 300BLK pistol cerakoted white, I opted for a slight distressed look since a perfectly white finish is gonna last all of 1 range trip. Has held up pretty well. 
---
Rip the new players
---
Dear god there‚Äôs so much wrong with this.
---
Yes. The people above me have really good points. He‚Äôs slow and his ability is pretty fucking loud, 
---
I haven't played in a long time. Is this guy basically just a wireless bandit or is this a bug? Why would anyone play Bandit with this guy in the game?
---
Clearly they picked it 
---
Restart game. Should do it. 
---
Holly fock
---
the only people who complain about ash mains are bad players
---
hence why "lion is a waste"
---
Not when his pellets ricochet across the map 
---
I haven't touched the shop tab for a while, but the new 2019 packs gave me a reason to. But now I cannot buy anymore :( Anyone having the same problems?
---
Shit to play and shit to play against
---
Yeah, that's deserving. If my team has a Cav, any downed enemy is offered to her for interrogation, regardless of how downed them. But if she just shoots them instead, the match then becomes 4v6.
---
He only gets 2
---
because the new playlist is still like casual right now, hes not even gone from ranked lol
---
I personally think that switching each round is the most fair, but then again I am not a PL player
---
We joined mid game and were given the operators as random picks, I have a video of joining the lobby that I could gif or something. Not sure if Recruit is even available to pick in the new mode, could be wrong.
---
I have duplicated the aug black ice 3 times :(
---
So from my experience, Blitz tends to be a big problem for two groups of players. 
---
Silvers/Bronzes who dont really know how to deal with him, and Diamonds. Diamonds issue is that everyone is in a 5 stack, that Blitz is never alone, and probably knows all the tricks in the book not to have stupid things happen. 
---
Speaking personally as a Diamond, the issue with Blitz is i cant have a genuine gunfight with him and end up losing alot of engagements on the sole basis that they had a Blitz. People always assume you just double team the Blitz, without realising the way many top teams play him is to double team each individual player one by one. Its actually a well known military strategy for how to win with small armys, and the issue is you have to focus on the Blitz to kill him - which is not something you can do when being double teamed.

Blitz is part of what id describe as the standard 5 stack in toxic Diamond teams. Blitz, Jackel, Dokkabi, Lion, and usually an Ash or Finka. Many of these teams dont even bother with a Thermite, and you'll be surprised how often you play them when in your own squad of Diamonds.

Yea Blitz has a negative win delta in PC plat/diamond, maybe he's harder to counter on console ?
