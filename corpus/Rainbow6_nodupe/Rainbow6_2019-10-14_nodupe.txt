Use his ability when you wanna know where people are. Use the gun wot shoots bullets. You'll be mainlining him in no time
---
---
---
Because I wanna just play the game man. I don’t want the stress of winning, even in unranked. Like sure, I might be platinum, and I’ll get 10 kills in one game, but those are rare days for me. And sometimes I wanna just chill and play operators like Tachanka, or use meme guns like certain DMRs and the BOSG.
---
I honestly still laugh about the fact they gave Oper9’rs fookin Taurus’s. 
---

---
One of the least effective and reliable weapon companies comparative to Springfield  and Hi-point.
---
Yeah my bad, I forgot to mention, the other teammates also chose that option too.
---
Exactly
---
Casuals
---
Pc: toxic
---
Console: toxic
---
Unranked
---
Ranked
---
Well, machine pistols are 180 ms  of delay till fully ads, 0.18 sec, vs the pistol which is 0.1 or 100 ms.
---
So its a 0.08 seconds of difference, so idk if it's worth it still.
---
 
---
Of course if it's an smg and not a machine pistol, then its 200 ms or 0.2 seconds, so here we see a 0.1 seconds difference, so still a real small difference yo pick a pistol over a full auto gun.
---
Watch rogue9 video about ads times this season, pretty informative regarding the new ads times, and may make you use vertical on guns you used to use angled grip for faster ads.
---
There's usually no reason to pick a pistol over a machine pistols or a shotgun.
---
Idk then
---
Hey Op, try manually selecting the data center from settings.ini file.

---
Yeah let’s hear how you can edit the title man. How do you do it? 
---
You can’t.
---
[removed]
---
Honestly twitch and ash are so much fun to play
---
Power creep
---
A man can hope.
---
You hate to see it
---
Castle very much has a place in the meta in a higher level of play rn
---
Leroy "Ash" Jenkins
---
F
---
But it's unnecessary because the gadget is already good as it is just needs to be used correctly for it it to be effective
---
It depends on how i feel that day but lately I've been maining Fuze
---
That’s a new one.
---
I remember when Frost just came out her shotty was so good.
---
Gridlock is my main right now. 
---
I would do terribly things to be able to put that SAW scope on any attack gun...
---
Though Amaru has some uses in roam clearing, she seems to be built as a "fun" operator
---
Alright. How?
---
It's a gun in a box
---
Would love to see the video
---
Alibi is much more useful and you probably shouldnt add to the massive amount of toxicity already in the game.
---
Don't main anybody. Even better, don't main lion. Be versatile.
---
But if you do choose it, v308, pop scan when you see somebody on drone or somebody asks for a scan, don't pop just after spawn cause it's useless, save 1 to 2 for post plant, that's it. That's literally a pro tips guide cause he's a low skill high reward op.
---
i swear to god i was gonna link the same thing
---
man shut your lame ass up
---
Yeah I agree that's why I posted this
---
Clash gets banned a lot in ranked, so factor that in. Alibi never gets banned.
---
I like Thatcher a lot on attack and Ela on defense
---
Ah a fellow man/woman/whatever as well
---
Clash is good in a squad, Alibi is better by herself. Clash isn’t a toxic pick in the slightest, people just don’t know how to go against her properly and they get annoyed by it.
---
Did I say I was
---
Ump and p90 are worse. Have you even seen the p90's stats? It's pathetic.
---
You do know that the fmg has the exact same stats as the mp5k and mp5sd, and does more damage than the mp5, don't you? If you can kill attackers with the mp5k/sd, then you can kill defenders just fine with the fmg.
---
Damn....
---
Ok
---
Have you been disconnected from a match at all recently? Some players were disconnected from one match, got put into a new ranked match, and then eventually got an abandonment penalty from the first match.
---
I’ll see
---
That question is like asking why the sky is blue
---
Combined level with PS4 and PC over 200 and haven’t got any of those long range one taps. That’s gorgeus, keep it up!
---
yikes
---
I mean what's wrong with these ppl? we're supposed to be a team, on top of everything, it's just a game.
---
my team all have 2 kills and the enemy team has team damage, I thought it was neat :P
---
Oh I totally agree with you bud people are toxic assholes
---
Breh
---
I find the reflex sight easier to see whats happening around you (cover a bit less your screen) but i also think the holo sight is a tiny bit easier to shoot (more accurate).
---
So i usually use the reflex when i play a roamer and the holo when i play an anchor
---
Nice
---
This is why i stopped playing for honor. Fuck ubi reconnect
---
Someone fugged up my internet because I took their friends main. Omegalul
---
Hurb
---
Ngl, you ain't wrong, but bring a tryhard is good, even if you aren't *shrugs shoulders*.
---
In all seriousness, gold needs a redesign. Too effing patchy.
---
I have this as a nerf gun
---
I feel ya. Feels good getting an mvp.
---
Ban phase is nice but way too long
---
agreed
---
Report mass report
---
This gave me aids
---
It wasn’t on console tho
---
Ye PC gang
---
I need this
---
Yea that’s what he is saying, I think it would allow more variety in a counter to him instead of just IQ
---
I could see Blackbeard taking out his Deagle like master chief with the magnum in Halo CE
---
Still confused why he wouldn't just pop you.
---
or in killing floor 2 where pressing the reload button with a full mag plays one of three random gun-tinkering animations
---
Karma
---
Look at the icons in the top right, either that server is screwed or your wifi is committing sudoku.
---
No?! Says who?
---
Seconded, wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly.
---
Nah rework first. If it ain't possible, delet.
---
[Was added this season](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rpl2MtdWGxie2_jKbhdOPNDF5voOlZC7255fc3yZxG0/edit#gid=1786691949)
---
That would mean every other character need an animation at the beginning to balance things out, and it be cool to see what everyone dose
---
Because she's a thottie
---
The part when you're hiding among the Dead remind me of Call of Duty World at War when you're with Reznov
---
why you have a shotgun you can open rotates with like 4-5 shots of a shotty. barbed wire is the one of the best secondary gadgets
---
Her *T H I C C* rear posterior was too op
---
Remember that it was on the old Canal map
---
Bruh BTW
---
I do use his shotgun, but the shotgun doesn’t have much ammo left if you aren’t using impacts. I wanna pound people
---
I'm coming to that conclusion because they are telling me.  If you could read you would have seen that already.
---
And I'm not bad at the game, I can control my recoil perfectly fine, prick.
---
Damn that’s cool as fuck
---
What if siege had realistic magazine capacity
---
Exactly, especially with my sensitivity there’s no point
---
1. I wanna watch scooby doo now
---
2. I love your reaction
---
Oh. Ha
---
Chances are you aren't dealing with modded controllers, you're dealing with people running scripts. People buying things like strike packs at GameStop and immediately having rapid-fire, no recoil, and auto crouch spam. It is a sad reality of a competitive game on the platform that is out of focus of the developers. Currently, it isn't something Ubisoft can "identify" even though it is VERY obvious in most of the cases, and they don't plan on incorporating a system that could possibly identify it anytime soon.
---
Its a defender sided map chief
---
Yea, that was a little disconcerting about this year, basically getting 7.5 operators instead of 8, but I'm optimistic this trend won't continue into next year
---
Damn that looks so cool. WANT
---
Sorry, but if you're getting frags by holding with barbed you're playing in copper.
---
The operators are from Kenya and India, there has been a reputable rumor that one of them will be an anti-projectile operator like Jager's ability. We'll probably get a reveal in like 1 month alongside the pro league finals mid November.
---
But the mag is loaded in the top
---
First, ive told you i also mainly play ranked, second, just quit it, blitz is really easy to kill, he doesnt need a buff, he just need a better hitbox you are the one who doesnt know how to play him, and third, stop being a dick
---
That's pretty awesome!!
---
could be tabbing in by clicking the taskbar icon
---
I got clash
---
Yeah...
---
Is this real?
---
plat on pc lol
---
Slow motion bot?
---
bRuH
---
iirc the other team whooped us the rest of the game
---
God I wish I was around to get the tidal wave skin, that’s one of my favorite pieces of art and it sucks that I couldn’t get it
---
Yes, it's a famous painting on the Berlin wall
---
Dear Ubi, can you please fix barricade debris already?  Sincerely, everyone who plays Siege.  
---
Seriously, the debris stayed in both doors, potentially changing the outcome of the round.  It is so rage-inducing for this to still be an issue almost 4 years into the game.
---
You just contradicted yourself chief
---
That guy is wearing a Dio shirt. I approve
---
Like I said im not saying she is bad or people are bad at playing her. She has saved my life (and killed me when i was defending) but I hate crowd control. It doesnt belong in a shooter like siege where 1 well placed shot can kill you. Cc ruined other games and didnt help siege at all. Its a litteral death sentance when you cant move at all after getting hit with it. Seems cheap.
---
I’ve it on an external seagate drive. Backup plus desktop.
---
you sound like dio in jojo part 1. rip danny tho
---
And a little fox :D
---
You mean Tachanka's
---
Then you don't know what Central Europe servers are like. Every single round when i'm defending once the match narrator tells me that i'm being tracked. Way too annoying. I started to master the art of spawnpeeking to stop this bullshittery. Still, it's very rare if i kill jackal.
---
Some people are cucks who take custom games too serious. Like me and my friends act toxic only when toxicity is acted upon us. Being the bad guy isn't so bad every once in a while
---
Just why he’s good as he is
---
Mele is just them clubbing someone with it in box mode
---
I meant defense 
---
https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/Skyscraper/siege
---
I imagine you share the same opinion on Clash then? Or lesion too
---
I get what you mean— I’m sure it can be annoying, however when you have a game like siege that is honestly a little more biased towards the defending-side, I don’t see how balancing out Crowd Control operators for each side is necessarily a bad thing.
---
With operators like Clash, a lot of times situations where her utility is used requires multiple defenders to help her out. In the end, the game is more oriented towards the team, not just one player in particular
---
That's why barricades should always be shot
---
Lmao
---
Eh, he doesn’t really need balancing he’s fine where he is.
---
True. Vigil is balanced and strong. Needs no changes.
---
Fr :(
---
stupid title on my part. its more just a way to change around what he does. from the time I've played as him, he just seems kinda boring.
---
Cav. As a person who kinda mains cav I can assure you that lurking in a hallway and fucking spooking the life out of an attacker is a feeling you never get play8ng anyone else (other than nook)
---
I mean u can roam effectively with him since the opponent knows ur there but they can’t tell where exactly so you waist time and even more time the longer you live
---
Ima try that thx
---
Idk man, seems to me that's exactly how c4 works
---
This is so good. Great job!
---
Maybe whenever they switch weapons it could unfold.
---
Just to add, the drone itself can also destroy the evil eye completely by shooting its center once the shutter is open
---
Ubi soft club
---
Look at the kill feed, and look at the gun and ammonia count 0-0
---
Us older players called em the double fags
---
I’ve been part of the 4K from a nitro
---
.... vwhat?
---
I think they patched that
---
"N- no... Im not ready.."
---
ex csgo pro?
---
That's in Sandstorm, not in both source games, but your point still stands, an amazing feature that is really well animated.
---
There would be no point, the pump action mode is just for less lethal rounds, the only reason it's pump action in films and tv is because they don't manufacturer blanks that get hot enough to cycle the action.
---
no it worked with other symbols just needed different rates of spamming
---
Modded controller allow you to run scripts most of the time.
---
No recoil script for ela ... on console. 
---
Increased fire rate, yea. That is a thing.
---
Additional movement options , easier lean spam without having to get your hands of right analog stick.
---
If you think modded controllers are better than mk you haven't run into one.
---
i agree except for the part about it being a good meme
---
Dude, it's gas pressure that's enough to punch through metal walls. It's a contained explosion.
---
Like February 2018 I think
---
does it?
---
How to did you do that?
---
Then you got the game before the editions got changed at 12th of Feb 2019
---
wait...you can kill someone when it deploys then? thats uhh toxic af
---
I see you are active in the PS4 subreddit so that basically confirms it
---
i'm in this situation right now. What i do is i don't care that i'm playing bad. It's just fun to play with your friends

I'm more concerned about him aiming at himself.
---
They are all removed from casual for the first half of the season if I remember correctly, the next half they should remove other maps and reinsert these ones.
---
Theme park, on the other hand, has been removed until the rework or the Halloween event.
---
Anyways, it should be written on the embre rise patch notes.
---
ranked with a full party
---
&gt;because they don't manufacturer blanks that get hot enough
---
That's not true. The sound of racking the gun just adds sound to it, same as when people aim their pistol at someone and it sounds like they are cocking the hammer.
---
interesting
---
There's a video of a Mira tricking both Thermite charges on Clubhouse CCTV.
---
It's incredible
---
I remember playing on plane, tower, and yacht. So its there alright
---
Yeah or be able to use her sidearm while grappelin.
---
Why would they remove their own content
---
When somebody gives call-out that Ela is in the showers:
---
Thanks buddy would u recommend it
---
In the past month it has been gone, it was there before a month ago though so your memory is probably remembering before one month ago
---
Normally you cant. But there atleast used to be an exploit which allowed you to place them while prone. But you took damage from the mirror in the process.
---
Clash is bae and is the best op in game, no bais
---
I still have no idea why people forget that zofia can revive herself smh.

Hello Ashmainrape, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dho0j6/server_chnage_console/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What amazes me the most is the fact that you only have two deaths in a game with 9 rounds
---
Pretty dang detailed thanks! My friend really appreciates it *wink wink*
---
Oh and ofc the match also included the usual r6 crash in round 1 lol
---
Most of them did throw. Luckily, last guy was smart and just spammed flash grenades while holding the angle.
---
Listen, I play M&amp;kb. I started doing it for two reasons, I’ve got terrible wrists and had carpel tunnel surgery on both hands. My doctor said no more controllers. They’re shit for your wrists. 
---
So switch to PC right? He agreed it’s was better. But I have friends I’ve played with for ten years now on play station. Can’t do it. 
---
So I switched to ps4 M&amp;kb. I know, I’m a cheater. 
---
But I’m gonna be honest. It took 2 months to pick it up. It was like starting all over on siege(the only game I play now)
---
Yes, I won’t lie my aim has improved. My movement(left hand) has become shittier. 
---
My k/d has improved after the learning stage, but not so much you can attribute it to the mouse solely. A lot of it is just experience and game time. 
---
I play with guys who constantly out do me. They’re better players through and through. They use controllers all day. 
---
Before I was a high gold player, after I’m a low plat. You can contribute that gain directly to experience.  
---
My friends? Before low plat now high plat. That’s experience. 
---
My biggest point here is it just isn’t the advantage you believe it is. 
---
Increase your sensitivity bit by bit week by week until you’re at 100. You can beat M&amp;kb players all day. Watch videos, get a solid squad and beat ass.
---
I thought it was instakill
---
Dont ask me how or why but I swear I once saw Jager's ADS in the kill feed

It’s like 100 points damn
---
I forgot to say in post that my game crashed at start of round 1 and that this was a comeback from 0-3 and 2v4 clutch defuse with defuser planted😂
---
True, but it's still 100 points. Like, you're being punished for accidentally team killing and for lower ranks like me, it feels a lot worse than higher ranks
---
i never realized that wasn't always there
---
I feel like regardless of whether you team kill on purpose or on accident, there should be punishment
---
You had me in the first half not gonna lie.
---
It just be like that
---
Pretty good, m8
---
1.17. its bad.
---
Lol
---
Most of the ops are probably trained to be interrogation resistant too, but it's more fun this way.

Because it's a game mechanic

rainbow is magic skins are best for every map, that nice pink color is so hard to spot ;)

Does it say “Black minor deployed”?

Bloody oath mate!

go back!
---
U see from the controls on the screen if hes console or pc player bruh. I got salty from that crouch spamming on the end, pls end this.
---
it would be unfair to put it in the same league tho,  but i do enjoy secure as you mostly go for kills
---
r/ihadastroke
---
But hit face isnt changed. As in he still has his bike helmet on, with the uniform hat on top of that
---
Once I got an ADS kill with JAGER.
---
Wait did that doc just stim you rather then shooting up all three then running at the enemy like a junkie ?
---
Why don't they just throw a Nitro Cell? Come on guys. Not hard. Toss it into the hole and bam. Rounds over. Free ass eating for all players.
---
Don't buy it, all Year 4 operators are between ranks “meww operator” and “absolutly shit operator” you can unlock this operators with recknown and save real money for the next year pass if you want spend money on it
---
You know what I'd like to see? A Gurkha.  That'd be sweet. Give them a ww2 elite skin
---
"this isn't an adult small because I'm *definitely* an adult small"

While also killing your teammates

Well this has been posted multiple times . But thanks for the reminder

You saw 4 Dots

I got a kill with a Jager ADS once.
---
The only way
---
With the username right behind it.
---
ela’s elite literally fits her so perfectly, the whole rebellious aspect of it i mean.
---
Because I mostly spend time on anti toxic subs, but every once in a while I’ll still find toxicity.
---
But the ones you listed did show the characters history
---
Give blitz an acog
---
Operators over cosmetics in my book.
---
They're hated everywhere, even here in the Netherlands. Not all of them of course, but the ones in spandex suits who ignore bike lanes and drive on the road can go die in a hole.
---
Just give him an Emu elite skin.
---
Do it.
---
&gt;  (It is Polish and cringy af)
---
can confirm, that's why a timestamp would have been nice.
---
happens around 0:46+
---
Mozzie' elite skin: EMU WAR
---
Unpopular opinion: I hate the old style elite skins. The only ones that are cool looking are Valk, Blackbeard, and Twitch (Miras is alright looking). The other ones are either really really boring looking or just plain bad imo. Id rather every op have a lore friendly unique skin than a generic old times war outfit.
---
I’m really leaning towards that and will probably do it, thank you!
---
thanks man!
---
Yes if the skill level of the two players contesting are vastly different then it isn't bad. That's not how you balance maps though. Broken positions don't have a place in the game.
---
Ubisoft should release a load of WW1 skins for the characters.
---
That’s what I think I’ll do because I’m mainly interested in Mozzie, thanks!
---
Don’t think he needs a buff. He is a situational operator just like nokk.
---
Just looking for buffs on the man
---
Honestly his guns are just the final nail in the coffin for him. He needs more to be changed to a 2 speed. His gadget was buffed this season so I do not think it needs more buffs for now. Not all operators need to be as versatile as jager. He was made to deal with ash or ying that flashes the room and runs into it.
---
BMX bandits!
---
Everyone is siege goes through it. You’re gonna have bad days. There are some stretches where I get max 3 kills a couple days and then after that o get back up to around 5-6 (depending on the round amount) just power through it.
---
Vendetta, I remember that mission. It was nerve wracking on veteran mode.
---
Ubi gives blitz an acog for his shield just to spite people who ask for the acog on the bosg
---
The xim translates the inputs you give into controller inputs, there’s very few ways for devs to detect it
---
Lost some brain cells reading this
---
I want Stalin tachanka
---
Not sure it can be pinned down to ‘we want you to lose so here’s a horrid game’ but I somewhat get what you mean. 
---
Could simply be that you’re outplayed, try new things or play with more/different people
---
How
---
its a cas in my thoughts you were to slow but it is just a cas sooooo
---
Enough . 3rd time reposted already
---
Not sure if they're doing something for japan, but they probably will as it's the finals. But there isn't anything for watching the pro league games during the season.
---
The MVP animation screams super soldier.
---
Hé is smal making him real good in the trenches.
---
ohhhhh snap
---
They should make mozzie a Napoleon skin...
---
I've never seen the animation actually
---
If he gets the Calvary uniform could we get a horse themed charm, maybe a saddle or a horse bit?
---
It's a fairly realistic fps the first one is in ww2 and the second is in Vietnam.
---
I've edited the link, there was an extra line that shouldn't have been there, try clicking it again.
---
Then kamtom might be right and it is Amethyst.
---
Yea I play on the low/mid ranks so smoke plants and actual pushes almost never happen unless the enemy is a squad of smurfs But i can see how he is good in high ranks
---
How much is it and what platform? I'm interested
---
This actually seems most likely
---
I would like a elite uniform for mozzi that's based on the war against the emus
---
As you play your ranks just going to adjust, eventually mmr changes will be insignificant (mmr hell) but that’ll pretty much be your rank which should hopefully be manageable for you to both win and lose. But ye main thing is playing as a team that’s generally how you win most the time
---
why u bully me
---
Yes, please.
---
If anything jagers gadget needs a buff - either direct or indirect.
---
I agree but it won’t happen. 
---
Realistically I’d like to see ACOG removal and/or damage nerf. But a gadget buff to accommodate this.
---
In the UK some genius combined bike and bus lanes. The biggest and smallest vehicles in one lane! What could possibly go wrong? /s
---
Ok. GG.
---
Motherfucker I alreqdy strangled u if i had arm long enough to reach to your place. bitch
---
Ying is a ??? operator. Ideally, she is amazing with a good team. Completely flash a room + the next room and get a very quick plant off. However, what happens in reality is that somehow the candela flashes your entire team, the enemy is completely fine, they kill you trying to plant/entry frag and your team has no clue where you are. She works okay alone, but very inconsistent. You can easily clear a room with a roamer if you flash them, but may die if they are not. If you bring a teammate along, you run the risk of them becoming flashed and being unable to help/dying. Her gun is *okay*, her gadgets are meh since she lost her smokes and is overall, *okay*. Most of the time you play Ying, you would wish you were someone else.
---
not jager does his job right
---
That’s something he doesn’t need, in my opinion

 Na first you get TK’ed
---
It's cool but I feel like they're not doing the historic skins anymore?
---
Admittedly I am personally pretty tired of the WW1/WW2 elite skins
---
Oh right, I see
---
Honestly you should just be invincible to friendly fire during the defuse it’s ridiculous the amount of TKing that period.
---
Anyone else ever came across teamers? I’ve had smurfs (almost every game), mouse and keyboarders (also most games) but never teamers.
---
From losing this game I went from Plat 3 to Gold 1, I got Plat again the game after but still sucks to lose like this.
---
Game is game, life is life.
---
No thanks. No more WW based skins.
---
Still don't like it that Mozzie has a moustache
---
Then this might as well be a new operator because this isn't changing the meta for castle, this is making him a different character
---
YES

Hey congrats on taking the plunge. The game is hard to learn so you need to see what you want out of the game. If you haven't checked out r/SiegeAcademy you should. If you have any questions feel free to PM me or add me; I always offer to invite new players to my discord and provide tips. Good luck!
---
So it’s German Ash. 
---
(Good time Taken to think of counters too)
---
I guess, but this will make him more viable. And beyter players will just place ot on a window or something
---
your post is stupid
---
I play on xbox, and if you use shotgun you can literally kill him through the shield, and i dont even main blitz, i play with tatcher, its just that a i think community has a hate against blitz when he his right now, the most useless operator, because with the ads nerf is almost imposible to rush with him, and before you say me i want blitz to be buffed, no, im no on the side of the guy who do the post im just giving my opinion, and a way of how to counter him, plus there are more ways, nitro cells, impacts, melee him, trap operators are a counter to shield by themselves if they know how to place their gadgets, lesion is the best agaisnt blitz, becauuse then its imposible for blitz to run or rush to you for blind you with the shield
---
Answer this: Where's the harm in doing this AND more? Because you literally said this "isn't the way" and you want it "outside of the game", implying you're not ok with it being in the game.
---
That looks like Kaid
---
Bet she would be fun to play

Name checks out

You want them to censor their game to protest against China when last year the community complained they were censoring their game to appeal to China?

Thank you everyone for supporting me. You’ve all changed my life. 
---
I’m forever grateful for this community.
---
It sounds like a good buff in theory. Since most operators can easily destroy it.
---
Imagine someone famously loud and aggressive like Gordon Ramsey screaming that your a fucking failure for not defusing the bomb

Wait what but it takes more time to take out your phone and take a picture. you can screenshot in game with just one button.
---
Did you know that was the first idea for blitz? Near the beginning, blitz could "breach" soft walls with his shield. They took it out because it’s kind of too strong imo but he does have a bunch of counter. If they add him, no one will play him because all he does is rush, he brings 0 utility for the attack.

Love your work! Looking forward to many more years

P.S. Are you playing windowed?

Congrats

Love your work! Happy 2 years! 👁👅👁

Maybe like a locked door on it? /s

Thanks

I think there is a misunderstanding with what I meant here. By outside the game I just mean within the game itself, but having icons like say a character from the game representing HK, like with Overwatch would be a good way to support them. I have no issue if this was to be within the game, but I don’t think it is an effective way to achieve the goal of supporting HK.
---
I mean I think there's something there, I've always thought that is shouldn't be easy to use melee the barricade down, instead maybe increase the amount of times it needs to be meleed so that if attackers want to get in somewhere it's going to take some time
---
How would that work?
---
You really are convinced that jager is only picked for his gun. HE IS THE ONLY ANTI PROJECTILE OPERATOR HENCE WHY HE IS PICKED SO OFTEN
---
Sometimes screen shot doesnt respond for me
---
I was being sarcastic, indicating with the /s
---
How about just making it unmeleeable (i dont know if thats a word) you need skme sort of explosive or sledge to break it
---
Gg
---
Someone is salty that you are doing better than them
---
Oh, im stupid
---
Yes a retcon is censorship and will literally ruin the game for you if you don't watch out
---
Nah, but now you know
---
What do u mean.
---
Because the ranking change broke everything
---

Isn’t it a bit late, considering TH?

That’s petty lol. I get one persons opinion but all 3 other players really feel that way?😂

T-hunt is a separate game mode, I’m ta liking about not putting a AI in the multiplayer. Like rank casual and all that.
---
Ok will give it a go, what rank r u?
---
it’s because of those
---
players that are unranked. If you are unranked, you can practically play with anyone still. There’s a high chance that the unranked is a high gold while his friends who qued up with him are low silvers as shown.
---
Probably because the unranked players in that lobby are your rank or higher. Or more likely, matchmaking broke and they couldn't find someone the right rank to go into that match
---
Sometimes, it all depends. You have those guys who are laid back and know you are human and don’t give af, and then you have those bad to the bone think their badass by the book people, who get onto you for having hair 1 cm too long. So it all depends on who you get.

Maybe have it be an added benefit of Elite Skins? You get an announcer pack of the character whose skin you bought?
---
attack: torn between zofia and mav
---
defense: ela 100%
---
I think he should have something to do with emus to give him ptsd

Original photo btw

If they give mozzie an elite skin before Zofia I'm gonna be pissed
---
Nah I only play on the weekends I have school
---
No.
---
All guns in the game have access to Invitational skin except F90, Super Shorty, SDP 9mm, Commando 9, P10 Roni, so ya it's pretty much treated like a seasonal skin. But the other seasonal skins should also continue finishing up the whole collection since Ubisoft aren't adding any new weapons anymore (Assuming they really don't).
---
Yeah a fair point. My philosophy was that since the game has taken some creative aspects in the lore already (the operators for example still have the badges and uniforms of their origin CTU:s), it could somewhat fit to have voice chatter commanders from those CTU:s as well.
---
But yup I agree.
---
I will need to update the shrine
---
Defuze de fakin bomb kurwa!
---
I see him more as a mad max type of Ausi.
---
Personally i think he’ll be great for attack especially since he has smoke grenades, just pop one under the door and as soon as it pops rush through. To me the whole point of this operator is to serve as a distraction, when everyone is panicking over the shield busting in out of no where then your teammates can take advantage of the chaos and pick off the enemies
---
buy a logitech
---
Those are the OG ops, and u should not buy any of them right noow. They are hard to play, and take a lot of practice to play with (Excluding rook or Kapcan)

Ended up -&gt; past tense, so Im reffering to the method Ubi choose those years ago.
---
You can start tilting (up for example), but even if you jam on it, there is a brief period of increasing tilt.  That isn't there with keyboard, it's more like an on/off switch than a slider.  There is also a brief null period when switching to an opposing direction on your stick that isn't present if using MnK.
---
You can catch this difference.  As far as I can tell this is how Fortnite's anti-MnK worked.  Between 3 and 4 minutes into the game it looked for instantaneous change of direction and kicked players who had it.  The patch from Xim put in a brief null period between the directions--long enough to trick the anticheat, but not long enough to be noticeable to players.
---
If we knew we’d be dead
---
So easy and effective through just existing. Great operator design right there

What about shotguns or bandit's mp7?

If wish I could say the words I and aced in the same sentence
---
~ 10 seconds
---
most of the time they are unbalanced. 4v5 3v5
---
I just want to be able to hold my own while playing alongside my husband lol. Someone else suggested that sub and I’ve been trying to take in everything that I can! And I might do that! Thanks so much!
---
It' only valued because it's rare, but to be fair money is just paper without its human given value
---
1150 I'm pretty sure. But headshots are much less frequent than body shots. And you're playing one of the worst ops in the game Ela. With the only primary with pretty much random spray. It's not too great even with the fire rate.
---
No prob bob
---
More like 5 ways to be the first to die
---
This silly bug has been reported up. Thanks!
---
Cuz their supposed to look nice and their easier to make
---
Our name will be “One Taps”
---
Can confirm. I used to ride a bike everywhere for 7 1/2 years and when I came to England I thought "why. Do. The. Cyclists. Go. Right. Next. To. The. Cars. And. The. Buses."
---
Leaving gives you 30mins. Not a day. You get a day for being a dick and leaving often
---
Elas shotgun is the fastest firing shotgun in the game (not counting tcsg, it's pretty much a dmr), is the only shotgun with an extended barrel, is held by a 3 speed op, and does more damage than any other shotgun in its class (semi auto) (not counting tcsg again)
---
That's like ash running around with, well, the ela shotgun.
---
Plat and up is also terrible because most plays have a huge ego and think they are hot shit instead of just trying to be a teammate
---
Because you should get a penalty no matter what round you leave on and if you don't do it often the you'll only get a 15 - 30 minute ban. If you have a problem with being banned for a day than stop leaving as often. And if your internet connection is so bad that you'll get a full day ban every day than, bad luck
---
Why such dilemma when we know nothing about s4 nor do we know when its gonna arrive?
---
Id say go for dokka now. Wait and see if the new ops gonna even be worth it.
---
Well yeah, but i don't think the projectile actually causes a concussion on impact, and at least preserve the sound, and visual.
---
Y4S4 is in December....you can get enough recknown to buy the new attacker....buy Dokka now
---
French shotgun isnt semi, and the saiga is pretty much the 2nd worst shotty in the game
---
When the defuser is planted he'd just start opera singing until it gets defused
---
With additional voice lines telling us how beautiful the drones are after capturing them
---
Just to add, this is a known issue we are looking into! If you have not already, [contributing to this R6Fix report](https://ubi.li/uYwev) helps a lot.
---
NO
---
is it really an ace if you steal a frost trap kill?
---
Do something with what?

this only happened half an hour ago and its the first time, but when i returned after dcing the game wouldnt let me and said it failed to login and kept trying to connect
---
Anytime!
---
Amazing how you're only excuse for using it is "soft breach and mobile"
---
Cus it's fun dunkin on bad players
---
Ok good point. One question how did you get the Kapkan Main icon next to your username?
---
And again thank you for helping me!
---
Very aggressive. Well played.
---
It's on theme park
---
I'm no Ela main, but whenever I play her, the scorpion seems unbeatable, the recoil and that many bullets in so little time make it very easy to hit them even when you're not aiming that well, but that may be my luck(?
---
Imagine thinking spawn rushing is tactical lmao
---
Whatever you say, dude. All I know is that this game, in its current state, is a joke on console. Which is what I play on.
---
thank you
---
I love it!!! Haha
---
Oh nice
---
Damn thanks man I always rushed the objective and got an ace with amaru but now I know that I was playing her wrong thanks for doing this tutorial 10/10 would recommend
---
Meanwhile here i am a Copper V and i feel like i'm not good enough for even that rank.
---
Ubi should somehow penalize people doing this...  in case you play Caveira and you want to interrogate him, it should be real game changer
---
German recruit screaming announcer
---
exactly she can literally be out done by ant other gun. like you want a high fire rate weapon? use smg 11 that simple
---
trash af
---
Thank you for all of the art you've shared over the years! I enjoy every comic that I see on my timeline on Twitter from you. &lt;3
---
That’s actually really interesting and not a bad idea. Hell I like that. Maybe they can make it a different sound like Tuba from hell. And maybe his wrist gadget can be a grid of coordinates. You made my idea for an elite even better
---
Clash is very effective if used correctly when you’re with a full team - if you’re solo queuing she’s pretty much useless unless your team is communicating well.
---
What about shoes?  Can we change the operators shoes?  I know you're not about to leave the house dressed like that.  Or how about a proper ranked where I'm not going up against a team of assholes who have to buy new accounts just to get some Ws to make themselves feel better.
---
I'd say this garbage is getting ridiculous but we have gun charms.
---
Love the idea
---
Nomad, Zofia, Thatcher, basic teamwork, frags, Ash, flashes, Capitao, Gridlock, and well-placed smokes all counter her.
---
Edit: added some counters
---
You can, but it's sorta wonky with her PPM
---
No argument on the topic. Just saying your comment is funny. People enjoy the concept of killing for entertainment.
---
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT!
---
Lucky you, I don't play clash as often as I used to, I'm now what's considered a toxic ash and jager main but good job.
---
what do you mean siege know you well? you can just set what operators you want to see
---
I'm sorry
---
This is the weirdest comparation I have seen in a while...
---
You fucking muppets! The hostage is still raw!
---
Ying/clash mostly
---
Great idea but the big downside is Ubi will find a way to make us spend lots of money to get a simple voice line.
---
Capitao and gridlock
---
Fmg9 only has moderate fire rate and low damage at 35 and 33 suppressed and the desert eagle has low capacity of 7+1 and high recoil. Also I personally dont like the deagle iron sights
---
I wanna hear Lordchanka screaming in my ear that the bomb has been planted
---
Shotgun also #acog for bosg
---
K1A isnt an AR, its an SMG
---
A capitao bolt fired at around 3/4 bomb timer done automatically secures the win. (Which is exactly when you fired it)
---
Bolt damage time: 10 seconds
---
Time to defuse: 7 seconds
---
Total timer: 45 seconds
---
So bolt + defuse equals 17 seconds, call it 16 to be safe, so once you see it’s about 1/4 time left you’re golden!
---
More of a support player I see. Nice to know they exist still.
---
I have the same mouse and have no problem, what settings do you have? Do you have mouse accel and smoothing off, what's your dpi and in game sens? What FPS are you running at? When did this problem start occuring, have you updated your drivers recently; and if so, correctly? Have you done your windows updates, and has the problem started as a result of these updates?
---
finka is a bad op imo her boost is more hurtful then helpful
---
It’s mostly just a meme thing, nobody thinks it will actually be viable. Which is just another argument in its favor.
---
Yeah we need a sledge hammer missile skin
---
I dont know but I have NEVER seen a Buck do any thing that finka can't do.
---
Uuuuuhhhhh no...
---
Vietnam. Not world war.
---
Yup, forgot about them.
---
Well it's been happening for about 2 years now sooo
---
If only his helmet actually blocked bullets
---
Already explained by Rogue-9 that adding an ACOG will not solve the BOSG's problem as the gun is bottlenecked by its rapid damage drop off curve.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnCF5NgODNw
---
And the following is my perception of why people are so obsessed with ACOG.
---
People in Siege find an easier time to aim with ACOG than Ironsight/RedDot/Reflex/Holo, is because xFactor aiming is set at 0.20000 by default which is calibrated with respect to ACOG modified FOV, and that's where you get 40% sense reduction for Ironsight/RedDot/Reflex/Holo. You can't calibrate and have perfect ADS mouse sense that satisfy both ACOG and Ironsight/RedDot/Reflex/Holo with respect to both's modified FOV. If you calibrate Ironsight/RedDot/Reflex/Holo ADS sense to be 1:1 as your hipfire sense, your ACOG ADS sense will be too fast and won't align proportionally with your ACOG modified FOV.
---
Why would the finka boost be cancelled out. Isn't finka boost intended as a buff
---
It annoys me so much when people do this. They need to get a punishment
---
For balance
---
How do we make this happen?
---
It would be exactly the same.
---
Suppose thats fair, I wouldn't be opposed to it, actually I'm for it. But I can see why ubi wouldnt do it since its mostly fan service and not with a reason.
---
*laughs in emu*
---
sir im starting to think that you played battlefield one..
---
She has more optio s than buck too, like she can trade her life for around 3 other people's because of her drugs , she can stay on the floor under or over the obj. And be Fuse and throw frags into obj. To flush people out, and she can just be a support.
---
Bravo six, going dark.
---
December 1 2015 the good old days
---
How is it more hurtful?
---
Im 5'7
---
Use a Compensator my dude. It makes the gun go from stupid to amazing!
---
It hurts me that you put the Mira that way
---
Always looking for new people to hop on with, been solo queuing for a few weeks now just trying to get renown to get all my ops back lmao
---
The recoil is most definitely not too high. And if what you were saying about the way pellets work is correct, then you most definitely can fight effectively at 15m. 
---
Also, if what you said about pellets is correct, then the damage is not too low. At 12-18 meters with an extended barrel it does 29 damage. So 90 damage, in 3 shots of a shotgun at 18 meters away is ridiculous. Imagine if you were below 12 meters
---
Smoke has the most clean shaven legs known to man
---
What a load of nonsense. Clash is the most countered shield op. Clash should literally never win a 1v1.
---
I got a 1.2 i think
---
So all the times that your game crashed was at 4-4? All 9 of them? Your proposition has no point. It’s an unnecessary change that won’t help that much. Also the penalty is only for 30 minutes I don’t know where you go get your penalty of a day. If you end up at 1 day of penalty is because you leave often or your game crash so often that you end up at this point.
---
Not everyone uses the “meta” guns on ops for god sake I use the BOSG on dokk and vigil the g36 on ash the the aug on iq the p90 on doc and rook the shotgun on both lesion and nokk and the roni on mozzie just because it is a less powerful gun doesn’t mean people wouldn’t prefer it over others I use them because I do better with them over the “meta” options. I used to 
---
un-ironically use the acs12 on alibi. Just because YOU can’t do good with them doesn’t make them bad.
---
The only one of those matches where G2 lost by any substantial amount is against Empire at Raleigh.
---
Both BDS and Liquid only ever show up in Minor tournaments so they're not an issue, not only that, but G2 has beaten both teams more or equal times as they have beaten G2. So, not an issue.
---
And Empire has only beaten G2 once, whereas G2 has beaten Empire three times, and by substantially better round counts.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for G2's most recent LANs. They won the Invitational (the most important tournament of the year) didn't attend S9 Finals, came 2nd at Raleigh (2nd most important tournament of the year, lost to Empire), and then lost a Minor Dreamhack, at the hands of BDS and Liquid.
---
So in reality, they've only had one bad LAN. Which was a Minor.
---
So ehhh, na dude. Thunder-clapped is hardly the correct word to describe the reigning World Champions who are at the very least, the 2nd best team in the world at the moment.
---
And if you've been watching Empire, the only competition for that #1 spot, you'd also know that they've been having a rough spot as well. 4th in EU PL no doubt, one point below G2. So G2's grip on the "Best Team In The World" title doesn't have much competition atm.

Hello InfraredNSG, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dhx655/still_died_though/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Your comics and playful sense of humor set in the environment of a game as critical as this one has absolutely improved the community and *my* attitude when playing it, so thank YOU /u/SAU-SIEGE for sharing some of your wonderful mind and art with us!
---
Sounds more like a paid partnership than a carry lol
---
Well then by that train of thought, if a teammate lit someone up who you killed, that would not count either since you didn’t kill them by yourself
---
so you are admitting to putting yourself at a disadvantage. i hope you never turn up in my ranked game
---
I wish Ubi would add little Sau-Siege character gun charms into the game. I'd absolutely put Monty and Cav on.
---
It's a fear i've never experienced.
---
You know what this would actually be a good thing as it would bring another way for ubisoft to make a touch bit more money out of the game, and it doesn't make any difference game play wise. Also they could do pro voice packs for an extra revenue for pro teams and players to make a bit more money aswell.
---
that's fair.
---
That is a grear ide!!!
---
What if we could get the April fool's 2019 announcer year round with this
---
You're not the one to decide that. 
---
And yes, it's a known bug that I've put on R6Fix, which as a result has gotten me in touch with the team because I didn't upload recent logs. I've asked them to consider this change too. I'll laugh if they add it.
---
3 speeds will never have ACOGs again, but I agree it should have one
---
It could be one from the emu war
---
My favorite M870 skin &lt;3

---
Its not that I don’t like it but I don’t want to see Mozzie’s mustache
---
Laugh all you want I really don’t care buddy. If you’re game crash so much than you get a while day penalty you should consider than maybe the problem is from you, not the game.
---
Happy birthday love your posts
---
I think this says it best...his mechanics aren't even super fast but his game sense is nuts..if you watch that VOD in round 8 he clutches 1v2 as an attacker with 15 seconds left on the second floor site...he spots Mozzie killing his teammate by white stairs, but instead of attacking Mozzie he lets him reload and uses that time to turn on the player lurking in bunks--kills him--then takes out Mozzie who had just finished reloading at that point...it was awesome.
---
Im not I DO BETTER with those guns I use them because they are my weapon of choice not everyone uses the same weapons as you I get aces all the damn time with the bosg but not one have I got one with the k1a or mk14 it’s all based on preference you just think because I use it it’s the best and if you don’t use it your throwing
---
Huge fan of your work Sau. I’ve been following you on ig since you started it. Here’s to another 2+ years!!!!

Drone it out before you just bust through a window

Nope.

You’re the last one. Complete the mission.

yeah and im running for pope

For me it has to be a cool motor biker
---
Why is your PS4 so damn dusty?
---
I need Fabian calling me worthless for failing to defuse immediately
---
Flash hider since that gun doesn't have a lot of recoil.
---
Never use the extended barrel, it's straight garbage.
---
See, my friend uses a smurf, but that’s because he was close to rank 200 playing with 60-120 which made matchmaking a nightmare. So that’s a reason that some people have smurfs I guess
---
I'd rather fight the police than the lunchlady at this point.
---
You should consider doing legit animations. The quirkiness of your work is on par with modern cartoons like adventure time. You could maybe make a career out of childrens books and webisodes
---
I need the Halo announcer in this game. Triple kill! Killtacular!
---
In COD:GHOSTS you could have a snoop dogg pack
---
Its part of the game.
---
Okay so, I knew he was there cause i droned it out right, but I couldnt even shoot back till both feet were planted, so he/she even has an extra 0.5 seconds to shoot at me before him.
---
I feel like half the player base doesn’t know he’s immune to Lion scans.
---
But it’s only for burst shots?
---
“Died twice” may be user error?
---
They underestimated the power of a fo-12
---
Not only that. He’s one of the best roamer, has a solid weapon, solid secondary smg and impact. Also, the agog won’t magically make the bosg a good weapon.

Fun fact: In Kansas City, Missouri , you are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stop the more of these you have on your rear view mirror.

Well, you just described the TCSG12.

I’ve checked sound settings and made sure the right mic was set to default. I can’t find any game options that would help me :/

Exactly it can’t hurt the game by giving acog.
---
I was thinking that, thanks!
---
1.) TDM. nothing serious. the game, guns and operators dont need to be balanced around this game mode, but it would be helpful to get used to a gun by playing 2 hours of TDM with this gun instead of only getting to play with the gun if that operator is needed in a given round of Bomb. getting in 2 hours or so worth of gunplay with a certain gun in Bomb could take days, whereas it would only take 2 hours straight in TDM.
---
2.) Gun Range. where i can pick and choose my loadout for a given gun (especially barrels) and see what works best for me.
---
3.) Defuse or some name like that. Milosh talked about it today in Pro League. he said there is a mode in Counter Strike (or some other game) where the attacking team gets to plant in an undefended bomb site, and the defending team has to defuse the plant. so its good practice for defusing the defuser or retaking the bomb site situations. sounds fun and beneficial.
---
4.) Practice mode for operators. here you get to practice how to play an operator properly which many people struggle with. how to Bandit trick, how to Maverick trick, Kaid trick, trick Bandit to trick the wrong wall as Thermite, etc. obviously you dont need this for easy operators like Lion, Finka, Dokkaebi, etc.
---
5.) Ranked mode for Secure and Hostage. dont balance the game around these 2 modes if you dont want to, but at least let them be in ranked for people that enjoy them. i hate hostage and havent played secure in ages, but many people do play them and want to play it in a more serious environment than casual. there should be separate ranks for Bomb, Secure, and Hostage.

6.) Map veto system in Ranked. so shit maps like Skyscraper and Chalet dont have to be played again since Ubisoft are so slow to remove them.
---
7.) better matchmaking. 5 solos should not be paired against a 5 stack. its just not fair.
---
8.) so many more. i feel like i am barely scratching the surface and come up with more ideas.
---
That'd be dope no lie
---
That's exactly where I was going...
---
Monty  is easier, he does not even have attack  when fully extended
---
They were repelling when they died and their head got stuck in the roof
---
Isn't the guy who said Blitz here a pornstar
---
People would be angry at ela mains using them as pseudo flashbangs.
---
Because they left. And also flic
---
but valk and Frost are already dlc ops
---
BETA GAMER
---
Damn, this is actually a great Elite Skin idea
---
No, and it’s so so easily countered
---
I had this happen a few days ago and he was definitely not repelling - [https://plays.tv/video/5da1316e8c3fa6002f/docs-suicide-](https://plays.tv/video/5da1316e8c3fa6002f/docs-suicide-)

Man, I wish I had good shotgun control.
---
Look, I have never done this and hate that its in the game too. But you can't hate on the player for doing this. If you leave a game, you should not be able to join back. There is 0 downside to leaving a match when you can literally join right back before the next round starts AND save your kd
---
No thank you u r the best person for making me laugh😀😁😂🤣😃😄😅😆😉🤗
---
Because high rate of fire then wouldn't be such a disproportionately powerful attribute. DMRs, handguns, shotguns and slower automatics would be more viable. Matches would play out a little slower with less excessive twitchy spastic plays. No more lucking out in engagements by getting a fluke headshot.
---
Gemini??
---
B8
---
Lion at launch was a balanced operator
---
Yes pls
---
I have no evidence but I am Beaulo
---
You try turning it on and off?
---
Love your work so much gets me through rough days❤️😂
---
This will never happen all i can tell you is figure it out
---
Clash is much easier. If a Monty is blocking a doorway there’s really not much you can do.
---
If clash is blocking it however, you can counter her with one of the many operators that can counter her, or tire out her taser and knife her shield.
---
Nah bro, you're way to good for pro league it's unfair to the other teams
---
Wait is it playing the gif for you? It isn’t for me
---
No doubt
---
Nah man, I thought it's suppose to be an image lol
---
What amazes me is the team that banned Jackel also banned Cav
---
aaaand back to settings
---
For the elite skin sure I think they will put in the work but for every other gear I don’t think so, it’s a hell of a lot of work.
---
I really just want to get that good that I can just demolish my friends. I'm not gonna waste a month or two just playing siege. I just want a way to say to my parents that I really like siege and I want to improve.  my goal is to join a team, play regularly as I would with any other sport.
---
In that case, just set aside more time on weekends, not really much you can do.
---
Thanks my lad, {-}7
---
If you gonna. a be on in about a half hour hmu, locustsigil
---
Can relate lol, I used to main Cav and interrogating always hyped my squad up. The interrogation only kicks in when it's in process right? Not when you only down them?
---
(As long as you aren't the type to be pissed bc someone stole your kill or some other bs)
---
Didn't have a spoiler warning then
---
the fact that the Doc allowed you to enter site, didn't res himself for that entire time, Mira not even acknowledging the bullets being fired at her and Jäger not even noticing you......hurts me
---
Can I join in good at hitting the very last bullet and then getting one tapped
---
The teabag at the end was the icing on the cake
---
What is the point of uniforms? Hide you in "nature" or interior. Sooo, what's the problem?
---
No I never rage. I'm plat 3
---
Cool, I'm um, not that great 😅
---
Lmk if you find out so I can do it again
---
The reason there isn’t as much backlash on the same weapons is because more players understand that there are a limited number of weapons that ubi can get the rights to
---
I know I shouldnt have laughed but fuck thats good. Now watch some sensitive ass niggas whine.
---
So that's why he doesn't want you to know what's in the canister.
---
gimme dat pp-19
---
That's ok I'm kinda ass too lol
---
BOSGACOG
---
I was operating on pure instinct by the end
---
Y4 ops aren’t bad and so what if they got repeat weapons other ops have some repeat weapons and if they want to extend this game as long as they want to it can’t be standard to have new weapons with every new operator and you don’t have to buy the season pass to get the operators
---
No u
---
Awesome, lmao. I started playing right before ember rise so I'm still trying to learn. I'll comment here once I get my xbox set up
---
Considering Zofia's rifle I don't see weapon rights as a problem.
---
I still find playing her annoying though personally.
---
Never actually seen it. It's oddly cool though
---
Ha! None of these questions all over reddit are reasonable. NONE I TELL YOU!
---
Wish I had it
---
Once I learn what all the different operators look like I’ll make sure not to let the doc stay down that long, as for Mira and jager it just looks like they simply had better things to do then deal with me lol
---
*We lost the damn round! Muthafucka Muthafucka!*
---
When your team says one health just breath on him and you do
---
i love you man
---
Not new, just not very active
---
Too late for Vigil’s dad
