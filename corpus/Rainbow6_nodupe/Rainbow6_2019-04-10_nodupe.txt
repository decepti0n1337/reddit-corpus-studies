so basically custom settings on lone wolf

---
---
Okay. Thanks!
---
I will kick your ads
---
Are you speaking about run-out at round start? Just don't rush blindly! Are you talking about run-out later in the round to get lazy attackers? Use claymores or get a mate to watch your back...
---
No I don't think it's a bad map at all...
---
This shit would be better than black ice if it had a little more ice to them cause those colors go nice together
---
Honestly you’re just a softcock

As me being Chinese this makes me happy

I played it once, and I disliked it
---
Did... D-Did... How could he... Such a profanity
---
Tachungus...
---
The frost mat kill at the end with the grunt of pain killed me
---
I’m sure if you keep trying you’ll be just fine. This game can be quite punishing, especially when your not in a great mindset
---
Next step is porn i guess.
---
How do people make these? I have no idea
---
Thatcher: Where’s my fookin hot pocket
---
Before the non straight mods remove this, I want you to know I appreciate this post op :)
---
Just doin my job
---
really?
---
Awesome play indeed! But it's kinda strange that your opponents didn't went out trying to kill you when you are repelling.
---
ah, and i like
---
Man is that a new shield?
---
Imagine already bringing AIDS character but still lose
---
But still tho, good job for showing them who deserve gold!
---
Why is everyone ignoring the fluff flair?
---
Very detailed... Guessing all of that was leaked somewhere then.
---
Sounds like the best elite there's been so far besides Lethal Citizen Glaz.
---
Yes this is so fucking annoying. Every single post about this has to do with their internet. It’s bullshit that the mods don’t remove these posts
---
F
---
Be nice to me smolboi
---
I think she can be sexier
---
These clips look really funny, you should give streaming a try, or maybe YouTube, I’m sure content like this would keep people pretty entertained on those platforms.
---
Haha
---
I agree with you.
---
IK RIGHT
---
I can be, her shotgun can be great and can kill almost everyone on the enemy team at times but it's very situational and you better hope they don't know you're there which they always seem to do. Ela is just really in a bad state and really if you look at it is almost Tachanka levels of badness. Her gadget can help with information but it can't do it effectively Lesion since his mines have little marks above them and when one goes off you have a better knowledge of which one did and it also delays the enemy much more than a grzmot mine as well. Hopefully one day she can be somewhat decent again because right now that's far from the truth.
---
You can change a lot of weapons select fire to a three round burst.
---
i love it the drawing style is beautiful thanks for putting iq im her main like you ;)
---
Did I have to use the /s in the title? it was not a panic knife, I had no idea she was gonna fall in front of me, my intention was to peek right since I was getting shot from that direction.
---
How many hours do you work in a week?
---
If you kill about one drone per attacking round in average you complete the challenge in less than 7 hours of play time. It's only one hour a day...
---
same bud
---
ah, can't be bothered to properly edit videos or thumbnails consistently.

The title given to the m249 on both Gridlock and Capitao, its named "Scope" rather then acog

Rainbow *Sex* Siege
---
Indeed good sir
---
oh i have the money but im not buying an entire collection for the one cosmetic i actually wanted. thats the point. people buying entire collections for one item is telling ubi "hey put more of these collections in since im ok with buying everything even tho i only want one thing" id be happy to pay for cosmetics if i can pick which ones i buy and not just roll the dice.
---
That's why you don't open crates, but rather just buy the skins you want, which cs actually lets you do.
---
I’m about to do this for every map to learn vertical angles! This is so cool and never would have thought about it. Bout to get killed even faster lol thanks!
---
I was kidding cuz in labeled as clash main
---
Bro lemme explain why this is a horrible idea with a thought experiment. Picture a team with 5 of the same operator. Lion is a good one to send chills down your spine.
---
Which is why I think a lot of people are disagreeing with Pengu. Lucky headshots through walls are so random it might as well stay to reward the players that actually DO plan out their wallbangs (through callouts, drones, cams, etc.)
---
Well i mean W/L would still count for something, especially if its 4-0, but like it wouldn't be the only thing it looks at anymore. So being a full callout support player should be okay, especially if your only dying like a couple times, with a decently high score. No loss of rank score when you win, just no where near as much if you go super negative. So more reward for better play, whether support, attack, defense, anything.
---
All 5 pick Lion
---
Yes, I’ve been having the same troubles, but on PS4, and I’ve had to wait soooo long just to get into a game
---
damn seems like there’s some luck involved as far as not being paired up w shitty people
---
Pretty sure you seeing something racist in this makes you the racist. Its a bit far fetched calling everything racist even if its a joke. Just cause something is a stereotype doesnt make it racist. When you say italians are lazy or french people always surrender is that racism too? or a joke. Please learn the difference
---
Then what is the background noise of the mom and son
---
where is finka she is apart of the spetsnaz
---
I fucking love that art style. Real nice job.
---
My favorite version is:
---
The party went into a bar.
---
The bartender asked why they always carried weapons and the party told him "Mimics"
---
The bartender laughed, the party laughed, the table laughed, they slaughtered the table.
---
Good times
---
&gt;using the rest of your mag to kill a downed man when there's a BB hot on your ass
---
It's a yikes from me dog
---
damn i mean i guess it makes sense so ppl don’t just chase kills and actually play the objective but that’s kind of annoying
---
Yes tremendously. I think for me it’s nearly 60k xp for each level.
---
You forgot your /s
---
i gotchu thanks bro
---
i gotchu yeah i play on xbox thanks bro
---
Good news, I already have Twitch and Rook sketched down for the next page.
---
I'm talking bout casual but it would take a few games to start and pile up
---
Me watching the fork in the microwave sparkle
---
It was a buck most likely
---
I came up with something similar to this months ago with the same name and it got shot down. Still would be cool.
---
Most broken thing I have ever heard.
---
I agree, never knew you had a similar concept. It was something I thought of on the fly just thinking about flashbangs and shit
---
Never said it was balanced, just a thought
---
Well played
---
What did i just watch
---
Do you need it? No. It does not change gameplay in the least. If you cannot afford it, do not buy it. If you want it and did not get it, buy it. Personally I am duped into buying these limited time items a lot. Probably goes for the majority who get all of them.
---
it’s against the sub rules genius. it’s a repost and memes are against the sub rules. not my fault you and op don’t know the sub rules
---
read the sub rules
---
Uhhhhhhhh read what you said and think about why you would make up an operator without making it mostly balanced.
---
Give me that black ice
---
you mean for example the title of the season for example "operation royal venom"on their twitter?
---
so the end of May? when's the next big event for pro league like with invitationals and Rio finals?
---
I made this shit up on the fly without thinking everything through. I was just thinking of something cool. Hell, this is less broken than lion was when he first came out. Point is, I wasn't thinking about overpoweredness at the time. If I took more time to think about it, you would see a lot of counters and drawbacks to this
---
I fucking hope not Blitz and Clash are annoying as it is.
---
Bruh Sound Effect #2*
---
I'm also taking suggestions if you have any
---
The issue with that is how it can be abused. Start shooting your teammates down to low health, get yourself team killed twice, then leave. Easy way to fuck up your team. 
---
Plus the game just has occasional toxic teammates like that, it just is what it is. It happens rarely in high ranks
---
##i want toast
---
This is as broken or maybe even more broken than lion. You are taking someone’s senses away of being able to hear in the game. That would perfectly play in the meta BTW. Imagine having no sound, you can’t move because of lion, you are getting tracked, and getting called while finka is boosting her teammates.
---

Pls no:(

I see that banner in the background. Go B’s!

Really nice

I have just cause I teabagged a blitz after he planted I killed him. I Defused &amp; then got kicked ;(.
---
Since when do sub maChine guns 2 shot people???
---
The only 2 shot guns from 100 health are: tcsg12, bosg, OTS03, camrs, 417. That's it. Notice none of these are SMGs, and none are full autos.
---
 Oof!

Ruff, was going to say don’t solo que but I do all the time. If you don’t mind what rank and system do you play on?

i heard it was a bad combo so yea....lol
---
&gt;What is dog? Damage over guts?
---
Lol'd real hard at this.
---
sounds like you solo q lol

Shoot the guy who told you it's a bad combo. Nothing is a bad combo in siege.

I should've bought a lottery ticket because a few days ago I got an alpha pack at 2%

I solo queued into the ten matches into Silver One and it placed me only like 10 points or whatever they are away from Gold IV so may e you’re on to something. I might solo queue some more to see what my “true” rank might be. Or maybe I’ll just need to suck it up and tryhard every single match, but that will surely take the fun away. I also need to stop leaving so many games because I feel like there has to be some invisible system keeping up with players’ win/loss ratio and k/d ratio because in the games I don’t leave I usually have a positive k/d.
---
That's really good recoil control.
---
Wow, it's almost like it's running on an engine at least 4 years old, probably more, that wasn't even meant to be a competitve online fps.
---
They're probably in a squad?
---
Your first problem is being a casual player . Casual no one cares it's not serious.  Play ranked
---
It shouldn’t be allowed though
---
What?
---
[removed]
---
ela mines are minor inconveniences compared to gu's &amp; yokai's. very rarely will an Ela mine fuck me over at the last second the same way a gu or yokai will.
---
Yeah, I understand they don’t want reverse boosters and smurfs, but they should offer some explanation as to what may affect players like me who seem stuck in a cycle of impossible matches.
---
Nice cropping shitllord
---
Yes, you can. And they should. Otherwise were back to the good old days of dying 3 seconds before someone exists on your screen.
---
I recently played a match where everyone on the other team was plat 3 and one of them was silver 4. Needless to say, he didn’t play like a silver 4.
---
No
---
Its golds and plats, that should be perfectly fine. Its when plats and diamonds queue with silvers and below is where the issue begins
---
Its also loud, giving away their position so they spend the time checking angles. Not saying its better than Lesion or Echo but its not as bad as people think. At least it isn't Frost.
---
I swore you had links that didn't have the name in them when I saw your first mobile wallpapers...
---
I dont wanna get banned because my squadmate is An idiot
---
The problem is you lose double what you normally would because of the golds
---
'Nice, Your fruit killing skills are remarkable!'
---
Yeah that's kinda why I'm not playing ranked now
---
I think it's great that you can accept that, but on the other side you shouldn't just let everything ubisoft does acceptable, imagine you had a child, it's called quickleaning, but then you hear that it says bad things in public, and ubisoft simply decides to kill your child because of that, no that's not how it should work, you should teach your child that it's not ok, and then you try to change it's character so everyone is ok with your child again. But when your child evolves to someone who really harms everyone, it destroys your house and you can't change it anymore, *then* you should decide to let it go.
---
i feel u brother. i feel u.
---
Restart and check WiFi, pc or console?
---
The 3rd most coveted Black Ice.
---
The very first time I played this map I saw that tire and tried to do the same thing with my drone. So disappointed. I just wanna do some drone skate park/ motocross cmon ubi get your head in the game
---
If I'm honest I prefer it to watching the same damn animation of mozzie and gridlock just walking next to a motorbike
---
right??? it’s almost like in this scenario you had like a 50/50 chance of getting it. if you’re going to whine then at least understand how probability works
---
Her recoil on console is abysmal. It’s probably the only gun in the game that comically Zig Zags left and right. Horizontal recoil is so much harder to control than vertical recoil in my opinion. I think if they dialed down the recoil on her gun the low damage wouldn’t be as present because the shots will pull toward the head like they do with other guns.
---
[.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/MwaaqCl)
---
😂😂😂😂 Mnk is better but it's of no use if the player is garbage to begin with and would be OP if they had pre lean. 
---
But in the end it doesn't really matter cuz your going to still be getting smacked by legitimate players who use controller. 
---
I cant even tell if people use Mnk hardly anymore there either that bad or that good cant tell lmao😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
you can use custom matchs and learn the map by walking round and destroying walls and floors to see where they lead.
---
that's what I do
---
scorpion is pretty trash, secondary gadget is trash, handgun is meh. shotgun is limited to being just that. gu mines are just as good if not better than grzmots....yeah sure... seems strong.
---
I can agree but if there’s one more attacker left it’s hard not to go outside
---
if you really want to get good at both map knowledge and aim you should play terrorist hunt. lots and lots of terrorist hunt. there’s lots of baddies to practice flicking to and you can select which maps are in your TH pool in the settings in case you want to practice a specific map
---
They need to outright rebalance the scorpion
---
I dont see any issue with this. A squad who have some people who havent played as much as the others to get there rank up.
---
Yeah man I dont see a link anywhere bro
---
It damages the whole sub, others will think it's fine to repost, eventually, we'll have everyone posting the same boring shit.
---
Map knowledge comes as you play more, so does game sense. I'd recommend watching youtubers such as Beaulo or VarsityGaming's siege school videos to get a better understanding of the game.
---
Just be patient about learning and play the game. There's always something new to learn! I recommend warming up on classic t hunt, that will help with learning where the rooms are and the quickest way to get to them.
---
Should’ve had iq in there
---
I actually lol'ed at "Khaki Chan", I'm going to use that in the future!
---
Knowing the luck in this game it’s most likely going to be uncommon
---
Nah, you just bad
---
How does this make me bad? Everyone gets killed in the game 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I don't aim a ump9 at microwave tho
---
Made it to -300 on Xbox.  Was weirdly proud of myself.
---
Lmfao love it
---
You can walk around in custom games. Just create a new playlist, pick the map you want, and make sure you set the match timer to max (10 minutes). 
---
It might also help to mention I usually do this as attacker so I can grapple and blow up more walls. 
---
You can change the setting so that teams never change and you’ll always be attacking / defending. If you’re attacking it’ll help to lower the prep phase to 15 seconds so you aren’t stuck on your drone for too long. 
---
Whenever a new map comes out I try to just do a couple custom 1v1s against a friend so we can get the feel for it.
---
Nomad?
---
I’ve had a direct sight line on an enemy’s head and not gotten a head shot after unloading a clip into their brain so yeah. I agree.
---
The guy who wrote it definitely makes me mad.
---

---
Death can eradicate cancer
---
What I did with the new map (Outbreak) was walking 3-6 min on each floor (custom game) and tried to remember the rooms/calls. After that I just said what room I was going to enter to see if I knew the calls.
---
They’re both like level 70 accounts that’s the thing and I know the people who own them. They’re diamond players
---
Why?
---
I have many more clips of this happening and I have 5 ping in every lobby !
---
Yeah
---
Since theres no link, what i’m guessing is one week a year we get to buy old proleague sets/weapon skins? No thanks.
---
I'm actually bad at the game and is copper 4. Every match, there are people who just get 10+ kills. It's cancer- I'm bad enough without you people.
---
Yeah. I’d love a Classic mode obly featuring ops up to Dust Line. A simpler time.
---
😂
---
And offer black ice for all ops then it turns out to be a rick astley skin
---
&gt; Bungie
---
They haven't been good since Halo Reach.
---
It’s truly awful. Anywhere from copper 1- gold 3 is where you can be in any given season, and solo queue is awful there. There’s a distinct lack of comms and coordination that make playing there essentially a 1v5 every round.  I was lucky to briefly escape to plat with some friends but my aim count keep up, and I wasn’t able to pull kills.
---
Explosion radius on the outside has been buffed
---
Pick and ban comes out next season for ranked btw

OP hasn't specified how Pengu stated _he wants the one shot head shot to be removed when you randomly spray across a wall or barricade_ but dae pro players ruining game amirite

---
They stated (In a twitter post i believe) it would take too much time and effort to keep it up to date with new gameplay changes and the updates. 
---
It just wouldn't work. That's one of the reasons it took so long to come out in the first place.
---
Honestly, one of the reasons I quit siege was because all my friends didn't want to play siege and I ended up on the solo queue.
---
&gt; like attachments, positioning, distance, recoil of the gun, and whether or not one player is elevated over the other just to name a few.
---
Which all still play a factor if there was no headshot mechanic... This isn't an argument. In fact all of these factors is why 1SHS is overrated since it minimizes all of the other factors. You could've had the fight be determined by a multitude of factors but oh wait, the guy missed 10 shots but landed 1 on the head so he won the gunfight. Skill!!! -_-
---
&gt; If you're bad enough at Siege to where it's gotten to point that you have to complain about a basic fundamental mechanic then please go play another game.
---
Of course. The ol' "you're just bad". So fucking tired of the garbage. Ever thought they just dislike the mechanic, regardless of skill level???
---
Really impressive! Good job with them

They are detectable, Microsoft has created an API to detect that. Nobody is utilizing it.

I do that alot with ela gun . Like way to many lucky headshots.  But when I'm two feet away and aim at the head its 50 50 on potatoing or head shot
---
Tachanka is really good bait tho. Everyone goes for him full steam ahead and then get absolutely bodied from the side by literally anyone with a shotty
---
I don't see why they can't replace casual with the SI playlist especially with the newcomers one already out
---
Dude their highest rank is at your own level that's not boosting. Boosting is when your team are silvers and they have a copper and plat in there.
---
Realistically if u stayed there long enough u would be shot from below, but this could potentially work in secure towards the end of the round
---
Sry bro but could I have a couple of red circles more I can't seem to notice what's going on x)
---
Rip mozzie tho
---
I wish you could trade camos. I would trade Twitch F2 or Jagers 416 for that in a second.

Yo i gotta do that, that sounds awesome.

Idc how much you blame teammates if your not a smurf in copper.  You need to start hitting ranked 12 hours a day you got a long road ahead of you .
---
I'm not the best player but I solo que alot on main and hit play . Team played on second account hit plat soloed on 3rd hit gold bounced to sliver and back to gold . So if your blaming your teammates get a squad or look in the mirror.

Ya been trying to get her recoil down but tapping seems way too good compared to it.

Like I said I’m totally down for the idea, my only worry is with Ubisoft and the fact they would be implementing it. I think there’s a good likelyhood that they might be making a specific Q for people solo Q’ing and one for stacks
---
Bro you shouldn't care what others say. Play Siege your way. Just don't be Ash / Blitz main and you won't be toxic 😂.

Where can i find the original pic
---
I need this
---
Its quite urgent
---
Damn that looks like fun.
---
Just load the profile 4Head
---
Yeah but that's kinda necessary isn't it? I think her gadget is amazing tho atm. If you use it correctly you can get free frags.
---
Can we make the BL2 opening the new Skyrim meme?
---
Dont report that's our only way to not que diamond smurfs is having a sliver who is a plat .
---
0/10 misleading title - not pencils involved
---
My first and only is on bucks' CAMRS
---
**FUCKING LAZER SIGHTS**
---
Ty
---
The recoil should be left untouched, just there have been so many times where I leave an enemy standing with 1hp and would have killed him with almost every other gun in the game.
---
Go on Ubisoft support
---
when you post a meme but it doesnt get taken down
---
These just keep getting better
---
good to see something else than skyrim
---
Khaki Chan is actually the best thing I've ever heard
---
The difference is you added a swastika to a side of a gun
---
That's why I'm upvoting it. I hope the lil guy will make the fence before getting the neck shot.
---
Do people still not know kill cams are bugged

Now you can go in casual and trash talk noobs

Okay I'll try it
---
Strap a bomb to his shield and his little group can be isis
---
Just let the poor terrorist cry about his failures
---
maths 100
---
I agree with this.
---
Why can't we have Operation Trackmania?
---
:3
---
I just saw a pistol only ace clip
---
*ordnance
---
Kimber, 1911. 7 bullets for 7 million dollars.
---
And remember... you *owe* me.
---
when I first saw him doing it I didn't see crying I saw something else
---
Some say he’s still there to this very day
---
Are they printed pieces of paper which have been laminated
---
No I think he means the maps stay separate, but the map pool is made up of the past event maps
---
I agree, I would like to see a new shield op that doesn’t incorporate his shield as the gadget but as an option instead, and then also fix the bugs, me and my friend used to go shield bro strats but he hasn’t been enjoying it lately with all the clipping n shit :/
---
:/
---
Just saying there’s no more new maps this year, they’re purely focusing on reworks...
---
How long?
---
What exactly should I be doing?
---
&gt;Usually I do like 5-10 minutes of bomb defuse with Buck Acog. Is this enough now that I won't be able to play much else.
---
they spend probably even more developing TH so I don't get you point about replacement, but I get that shit shouldn't be removed, but let's be honest, main driving force behind these events is microtransactions
---
Stale for me too. I'm playing more Apex and less Siege for sure.
---
Bro. You good?
---
You said specifically said there’s no other music other than the menu music... in game music is not the same thing as menu. That’s why I made that explanation.
---
F if you died
---
GG for if you won
---
Then they vote to kick cause you didn't clutch.
---
Outbreak was by far my favorite thing to exist in siege. I understand it's an event and attracts people so that they can try the game, almost like "get it before it runs out!" But boy I'd love it if they can keep everything event map they added at least into custom games. They could even make a great map playlist out of it.
---
He's still called Six but they decided to give this one a little bit of character unlike Angela Bassett.
---
It's been really really bad these past few weeks for me. I try not to solo queue, but my friends aren't playing as much as they were
---
Assuming you were born in 1999, your writing style is atrocious for your age.
---
Cool story bro, nobody cares tho.
---
club house wasnt even changed dramatically the new herford is bad but its better than the old one because that one was severely unbalanced
---
Strapped and kapped
---
Try it on realistic, they will knock you into the next galaxy.
---
Its like the Skyrim memo but better.
---
Mozzie seems pretty cool, so I think I'll unlock him. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Yea fair enough lol
---
Hey good job you did good 👍🏽
---
za warudo toki wo tomare
---
ps4 eu is all mouse and keyboard. so it’s more like diamond tbh
---
Lol right before favela and yacht got taken away I got those two maps EVERY. FUCKING. GAME I’m not even joking it was the most annoying thing, but when they got taken away I felt myself missing those maps after a while so I think it’s good to have 1-2 season breaks of the less popular maps.
---
They’ll throw their own smokes and say “they’d smoked us out!!!”....

Well they do have infinite ammo ♾
---
only if she looked this good in game
---
mate, i’m asking for your opinion. not for some knob to come and put “cool” piss off
---
It’s casual tho why can’t we just have all maps, if you’re gonna remove anything remove tower
---
it was there before they introduce those charms in this game
---
 
---
This group is highly trained, well funded and has access to military grade ordinance yet still records vertically.
---
A lot could be done with it as well.

It's like a solid oof

That’s why he looks so annoyed and bored
---
We’ve been snoofledorked!

Sure they do. But you can only take advantage of that if you're right there. And you're limited in how many you have.
---
Maybe support could help
---
Noice
---
What did you bring to this cursed land!
---
HEHE
---
Exactly this reason, imagine doing this in ranked where it actually means something, it used to be 20 but now it’s 30 so people stop smurfing in ranked
---
interesting choice of picture
---
They will never fix it, and it happens all the time to me, higher rank more it happens
---
Source ?
---
yeah, even more internet points

Your lucky I have a tab open

This is the first season I’ve ever seen this, and it will only get more popular as time goes on just like MnK did. If they don’t fix it than in a few seasons the game won’t be playable
---
OH man this reminds me of the good ol' riot shield boosting in MW2. lol
---
You see her when playing the training missions
---
S P H A G G E T I T I M E
---
Lol yes.  I'm not making fun of you, I play on Xbox too, it's just this clip is like the polar opposite of mouse and keyboard aim.
---
I disagree with your first paragraph, (didn’t read the rest) you play ranked to get better ranked doesn’t matter.
---
What i did was PS4 to laptop to reddit. 
---
To start, format your thumb or flash drive to fat32 or exfat. Otherwise, the system will fail to recognize the thing. Then transfer it to your laptop, and upload to reddit
---
I haven’t tried yet uploading directly to reddit from PS4 by using the PS4 web browser.
---
You could also do PS4 to laptop to phone to reddit, but that involves extra steps so yeah
---
they are just gonna stomp more more casual players to get higher ranks tho, this is basically just a "nerf" to the casual experience, which is not very casual anymore.
---
Yeah that doesn't work on EU only toxic little kids that think they are pro
---
he should get his mounted lmg to the roof.
---
They have both been going on for years now especially mnk
---
Loool
---
Thanks dude, I appreciate it 👍
---
Who? Aha no Tachanka here
---
That’s ok any time
---
i know, but if tachanka is spawn camping in the roof that will be great.....
---
His testicles are going to get shocked. Poor boy.
---
Ah if it’s defence mode? That would be a good strat.
---
For real
---
No worries man. Looking forward to seeing your clips
---
In their defense, it didn't say they were well educated
---
Hibana
---
I was sure they were gonna bring it back last halloween, I was left disapointed.
---
1. No
---
2. No
---
3. Go to PC
---
Or maybe because people like you would find an excuse to their death as opposed to a far more understanding scenario that you can learn from. The game isn’t perfect, but this clip here is completely fair.
---
She’s actually not six anymore, Ubisoft released a cgi video with the last season that basically explained to us that the original six from the base game was promoted and that the unit now has a new handler (I forget what his name is)
---
I don’t know the gameplay looked really good to me and for every person who delivers a monologue like that to me there’s like 5 people who say the exact opposite so I’m inclined to believe it’s good.
---
Meanwhile the SUICIDE bombers walk around in CBRN gear.

They need to make it a community challenge where a player can do one to earn an extra pack and then a couple community goals to give at maximum of three more packs. So like a community goal on how many missions are successfully run 100, 500, 1000 would be the goals (or something realistic but high) in order for the community to earn more packs, while still making the collection buyable with money or renown (have each pack be worth 15000-20000 renown since regular packs are 5000).
---
Wait a second. I thought this game was based on realism..
---
#MANAGER PLEASE!
---
Because that's the only way they manage to win.
---
Sorry for vacuum sound :D
---
How the fuck did you find this out?
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
My best k/d is in the IS-6. I rarely encounter anyone that knows how to kill it besides the mantlet on the left side. HESH and HEAT are the only rounds that can reliably pen the ufp
---
I already do.
---
Same. I just play on PS4 too and I hate mousing. I'm plat 2 and that's everyone rn
---
Just pointing it out. It’s still very annoying
---
The game was a 2v5, you can tell because there’s no plug symbol next to the missing teammates names. If you leave in the post game rewards part, it shows a plug next to your name.
---
Harry
---
Finally, not House for the 99th time. Good job.
---
Unfortunately, probably nothing unless the community makes a significant uproar about it, which won't happen because the high level players will moan. And the high level players are the only ppl ubi listens to.
---
To me this isnt Toxic.. before lion was announced Defence was kicking ass and taking names. But when he Showed up it was a push back with * Its not your game any more* that's why Lion is my favorite op

if you bothered to read one of the 10000 posts on this topic you’d know it’s not a Ubisoft issue. crashing the servers isn’t something Ubisoft can fix because they don’t own their own servers

But ordering food to your house is bomb af

Your second mistake was thinking this game was based on realism lmao.

Here's Johnny!

Ahhh shit im stupid right it's TOM CLANCYS rainbow

Forgot about the Lil Tom I'm sorry

Oof..

They’ll be hearing from my lawyer.

Why cant iy be something for Lion and Finka
---
But... but they're both attack?

On god

there’s nothing Ubisoft can do about it. read one of the million posts complaining about this.

Then he steps away, only the be replaced by Blackbeard's SR-25 barrel.

once threw a drone from the roof into skylight, it bounced and I had to go get it back from the ground

The truth \^

This is just kind of a joke between my friends and I who play siege but if you are an ash main what gun do you use now that her R-4C lost its Acog?
---
Assuming you only kill one person per mag. I get rushed by more than one person all the time and have to fend off 2+ people with one mag.

You’re right. It is crazy.

Literally nobody plays fuze for that reason tho
---
Haha get it Aussie small but why isn't he upside down hahahaha
---
They should add it back with few more missions, those 3 just wasnt enough but i still enjoyed it very much. Also theres so many people who havent even played it and that is one of the reason why should they add this back.

Hello sebwassabi, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bbnioe/50_minute_asian_queue/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Went on Twitter and say all the reports, Ubi won't do anything. Dude had a 247 win rate or some shit I saw.
---
Whenever your aim is feeling off try and turn it down a little until you find your shot again and then turn it back up a little bit at a time. Trying to copy someone else’s sens won’t work well for you
---
No one wants that.
---
outsmarted
---
Fooking lizard sights
---
Ah yeah I never played the Vegas games. I'm guessing that would be Ding Chavez's son?
---
how do I delete someone else's post
---
Sony licensed a m&amp;kb that works on any game by emulating a controller. 
---
Ubi can't prevent the use of licensed devices. 
---
I don't see how anyone could ever be banned from the game. They might be banned from tournaments with specific rules, but that is separate from the game. 
---
I know that a lot of people that prefer to only use controllers don't like it, but Ubi can't do anything about it and Sony decided to monetize it. The trend tells me that m&amp;kb will only get more common.
---
They brought two of the worse ops in the game with outbreak.
---
It's not Ubi's fault. Unfortunately there are alot of 3rd party providers that have this technology that allows one to disquise their k&amp;m as a controller from the game or console's. Even if ubi came out with something to counter it, the companies or people will just come out with another update to bypass it. Therefore becoming a never ending cycle and waste of money. If you really want someone to blame, blame microsoft and sony because they have the funds and tech to deal with this problem.
---
Loved how smoothly you got your shield up again as Cav rounded the corner with her auto shotty
---
I would make it more like a box with the infos, sort like Top Trumps, which probably will give you more freedom to work with different weights for the type (bold, regular or light).
---
Also, usually you are not allowed to put any objects on the brand logo, like you did with the operators icons. Maybe you could keep only the operator icon on its card and then create a cover for all of them, sort like the back of a card in a deck collection, you know?
---
If you have any questions, lmk. I'm a graphic designer and I'd love to help you ;)

There was a twitch streamer recently that had a video Q and A with the Siege community manager. In the Q and A they asked about MnK. the Community manager said there’s nothing the can do on their end. The people using MnK are doing so with a device that emulates a controller so that’s all they see as far as input. It would be up to Sony or Microsoft to try and fix it. He also said that if Sony and Microsoft did patch the usagbility of the emulators, the company of the emulators can just push out an update and it would work again. It’s just a big cat and mouse game that will never end. I’ll post the link to the video if I can find it.
---
I love this for an Elite Hibana artwork
---
Honestly if someone is trying to be a bossy igl in casual on house of all maps, he’s getting tk’d
---
I feel you, I pretty much use her guns the same way. That Acog on the G36c comes in handy on certain maps or bomb sites but anything mid-close range I always go R4-C. You are a true Ash main lol
---
What? She just checking her nails
---
I will try to make it into a gif later on
---
Just get the idea 😂
---
They said that I couldn't make it more accurate.
---
Because it's shaped like a pp and that would be *Fiverooni has been banned by BattlEye™*
---
It's not Tachanka, It's Killa on Interchange.
---
As someone who somewhat regularly plays Monty, this hurts my soul
---
np my guy
---
I play a lot of thunt on house, I know all the possible room layouts and bomber paths. It was only a matter of time before I realised how ridiculously op shields were on solo thunt
---
Then people who are deranking can derank faster?
---
although if they did, they could implement seperate matchmaking for mouse and keyboard, wich would mean the people buying adaptors would decrease by a decent amount.
---
I never surrender
---
You dont need your friends.
---
the music is from Undertail right?
---
yeah but like, *4 years* and stuff like this still exists. It's a multimillion dollar corporation and this game has been an esport for all 4 years of it's existence (right?), problems like this should be easy to fix, I'm sure ubisoft can at least implement simplistic fixes to programs to reduce high ping for people. Obviously it's not the best, but it can still be much, much better
---
Like the way GR:Wildlands does it. I played that before R6 and the Ghost War is poor mans R6. You can vote between 3 maps/game-modes.

Some FPS that I used to play has a system to kick you out of the beginner channel if you reached certain K/D ratio and they have disconnect count such that you can't just quit the game right before the game ends to prevent your K/D going high.

So Ying

Does it, though?
---
Isnt ping your connection to the data center? I thought that was pretty much out of control for game devs, as it's based on your internet.
---
The point system is one of the worst additions Ubisoft ever made to the game.  It is one of the worst measurements of how you performed in a match yet feeds the MVP screen (which really isn't that important) and causes a lot of people to argue for MMR to be influenced by points.  Kills and assists can be highly influenced by activities that are never scored by any points system and many times points can be earned for performing actions that actually hinder their team's chances to win.
---
I agree that it is part of Sieges idendity, but operator abilities, operator interaction/combination, destructible map, Attackers VS Defenders asymetrical gameplay takes the bigger part here.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Furthermore, I dont want it to be changed.
---
Yah I feel ya. I’m personally gold, but when I play with my friend(plat1-2) we get matched with a bunch of them. I’m hoping to save up enough for a solid pc, but it costs a lot, and I would sacrifice playing with friends. You can’t beat people with higher accuracy and better agility than you because they just have such an advantage.
---
Better than the skyrim intro don't even u/ me
---
What was that jäger trying to do lol
---
Yea same title as well.

I play on a potato pc with i5 8gb and no graphics card

Jeez it's a joke that's been going on for 2 years, I thought you'd get it by now.
---
Best comment so far (:
---
I’m glad you got the reference.
---
Wow. They rollin' deep.
---
From a previous reply:
---
The ai is retarded and struggles to kill operators behind shields. When facing a shield you have two choices
---
1: flank the shield and shoot them in the back
---
2: mele the shield exposing the user (which the ai does) and then quickly follow up with a shot (which the ai fails at because it has to reload)
---
This is a wired loop hole in the ai behaviour that I found
---
Every shooter I can think of that offers map voting turns into the same three maps being played over and over again.  I personally enjoy having a wider variety of map choices.

Wow looks like another free weekend
---
Ok, if that is what you think though I still don't see why
---
Try setting the XFactorAiming to 0.028167 in the game files and put the slider in the ingame options on 100. That should put your acog sens on a 1:1 ratio with yout hipfire (but not holo:hipfire to 1:1). But I think the result will dissapoint you and will mess with your muscle memory.

This is literally a cross between my fave game lmao

Ye teammates always throwing smh.
---
How does removing OSHS through walls/barricades *lower* the skill ceiling? Most kills through walls or barricades are lucky sprays, removing those would, in my opinion, make the game more skilful as you'd have more time to react to sprays and prefires.
---
His original idea to entirely remove it is stupid, but removing it through geography definitely bears thinking about.

I hate this event

This is beyond laws

To be honest, it feels like people who post threads one way or another are trying to karma farm, especially the people who try to reaffirm a status quo that was never really in that much dispute anyway. Pengu knows what he's doing, but I thought it was common knowledge by now that he gets really salty, really easily. I can relate, but his hissy fits should not dictate the direction of the game because he's not in a rational state of mind during most of them. In the meantime, we don't need all these threads discussing the same thing and coming to the same conclusions and pushing discussion no further than we started. There are more pressing matters to discuss, like whether Ash needs further adjustments, what to do about Blackbeard, what maps should be next in line for a rework, etc. I'm pretty sure no matter what happens around here, one shot headshots are here to stay.
---
Oof.
---
so this is gonna be the new meme i guess
---
Hah! They tried to remove the meme feature of the breaching charge; looks like it ***backfired***.
---
True, but the uzi and the TS12 are iconic too. I should have done the Galil tho, that would have been cool.
---
If everyone posted their "omg this guy is so bad" moments on here, this community would be even more toxic than it already is. And there'd be so many we'd never see anything else.
---
Serious question: what constitutes a serious discussion?
---
I'm asking because while I agree i'm not a fan of his, and I think arguing about the one-headshot mechanic is a bit silly, I do have to state that anytime anyone in this community brings up a complaint, there is pretty much always someone insisting what Ubisoft is doing is fine, and that those complaining are whining/entitled.
---
I genuinely don't know how we can ever start a serious discussion about this game, if one side of this community constantly complains about everything, including things not really worth the argument, and the other side constantly insists everything is fine, and that those complaining are whining or entitled.
---
Again: this isn't an attack on you, I completely agree Pengu is being ridiculous here. But the use of "entitled whiney player", while fitting here, does remind me of that fact this community often falls into people calling each other Ubi fanboys or entitled whiney players.

I'm just not sure where the room for "Serious discussion" is.

Да товарищ да
---
Level 50 isn't nearly enough, I'm sorry m8
---
Idk about that but it's probably for the best since it's an acog
---
Well it seems like the only reking here today is the recking of my soul. I'll just escort my myself out.
---
Yup, it’s Twitch! I didn’t really add any defining features that made it clear it was Twitch so that’s an oopies on me
---
I know and with this season it said they would make a mid season event and I was excited cuz I thought it would be something dealing with nuclear stuff cuz of how much they hinted at it but nope. Just an April fools dumb mode
---
They team killed a lot. You should expect tks in ranked by now.
---
It was mediocre at best.

You can still fool people even when using a different skin. When people come flying around a corner they’ll still fall for the the hologram anyways. They just shoot the first human silhouette they see they don’t pause and say hey wait a minute this alibi has a red beret but the one in the prep phase had a black one
---
Well....

Banana...

Need I say more?

I saw a shroud stream and I remembered Pengu complaining about nomad and lion, yeah they are annoying but the video was more of him ranting then giving the community ideas how to fix it. I went to the stream thinking shroud was pengu and I hated him for a bit, but then I looked up the video and I realized it was Pengu and not Shroud. Now, I've loved shroud ever since, especially when he streams with friends in squad mode, it makes me feel like a pro league spectator
---
That last sentence is something that only EA sports can do.
---
My problem is still there. It keeps hanging when I start any match, casual or ranked. Not all matches though. And also if I invite someone or join anyone in game.
---
I totally forgot about the Finishers... especially when you jab a knife in the bitch that crawls under ground
---
It's coming out of beta next season lol, which will be end of may/early June.
---
*sigh*
---
Think i bought the game for 30$ and got 10 operators on each side, but I also bought the game before the February change went out
---
Should say field, not friend
---
From my experience, as far as the map goes. If you shoot some in the air you see them fly away until you can't see them anymore.

Isn’t harry the third six? First was from the book, next was the lady from outbreak/article 5, now we have harry

So was the enemy team, they just wanted to play with their friends

It stands for Mouse and Keyboard
---
Yeah ok buddy
---
Can blame him
---
Is the camera sideways?
---
Top right corner of the Rainbow 6 reddit page there are 3 dots. Click it and it's the one that says "change flair", then you can choose who you want
---
no because of the operator price reduction , so it's time to move on
---
Her DMR is arguably the best in the game due to its damage drop off staying flat. All other DMRs have a steep drop off after a certain distance. Her gadget is ok, works best with a coordinated team, and the SMG12 is still usable in closer ranges and depending on your recoil control. Who else are you considering? She isn't a bad pick, but maybe not a good one either.
---
It awful that pengu and it his little kid followers want this to go, but Blackbeard is in the game and despite his many needs, he is still broken as hell, solely because he doesn’t die to one headshot
---
Thanks :D yes, solo :)
---
That's kind of bizarre actually, because in other games test servers are usually where sweaties will try different things rather than their go-tos. Like in Dead by Daylight everybody is trying the new survivors and killers and perks, with only a small handful of those that try significantly harder than they should be on a test server
---
wait, how else do you play him??

Honestly, anyone who supports this argument is bad, plain and simple. Any logical, experienced siege player who spent the time to "git gud" easily sees this argument (if that's what you wanna call it) as entirely pointless, and the people who support it just don't have skill.
---
I mean try this game on console. I have, with over 1200 hours over the course of a little more than a year. -*I've never been ranked*, but I'm still decent at the game. I'm not God tier or anything, but if I had to guess I play at a Gold ll level. I simply played the game, occasionally watch a seige video from some seige youtuber, and that's where all my experience has come from. You can't whine and bitch because you're bad at the game, but that's what people do, especially in Siege, which has the largest learning curve of any game I've ever played.
---
Basically if you support the removal of a major mechanic in this game, than either you're bad, or you're plain stupid.
---
Huw is this ubis fault ?

And the bullet wounds

I'm pretty sure that won't be the case.  Only games published after April "X" 2018 will support name changes. It will still show your previous ID

I was thinking of saving up the extra 5k renown to get nomad but I just want someone who is fun to play and someone who I can use to improve my aim.

At least you admit it’s not yours. :P

I don’t tk ppl that use mnk (everyone does it) but it’s extremely scummy

so we can skip the first steps like get no rl and that stuff.
---
So we are comming to the hardest steps.
---
You have to spawnpeek every round with acog, you have to tryhard every casual match, you have to drone, crouch spam and that whole toxic stuff until the game is seeing your toxicity and let you drive the "Toxic wall driving drone".
---
I hope your minds are strong enough to handle it ;)
---
They have an updating coming to fix it, but for now try updating your graphics drivers.
---
The monty shield skin is really cool. Now if only you could actually buy it for like a buck, instead of needing to convert your money to worthless fun bucks, then buy a ton of stupid packs, and then pray you get what you want.
---
this is tragic.
---
This is the exact response I had and in all honesty the 30 minute ban was worth it.
---
I died so many times to the bait and switch shit before I started to really become attentive to it. Its definitely earned me a good amount of kills since I started doing it myself, especially since I play a lot of Ash and Thermite.
---
Yeah..... not sure where it came from. Found it on my phone from a year or 2 ago.
---
yes :D
---
People that care 😂😂
---
"Remove thunt " and downvoted you get idiot
---
The game is flipping it's understanding of the game on it's side every patch
---
I was expecting 400 German females
---
I'm sorry to tell you this but you need to stop buying all the packs if you want to be able to just buy the single uniform you want. Ubi sees you buying all the packs and says "Yep its working, keep screwing them over". I'd betcha there is a lower chance you get the good stuff such as the Tachanka bundle too just so you end up with your situation more often.

It doesn't need to have all ops available to the game mode. They could have only 5 ops for each side available to pick from (possibly more if there are any that I have forgotten about)

What makes it even better was this was the end of the whole match. I had 3 other guys, all went down within 10 seconds. I was the last one for the game. I really do love this game.

It looks cool, but it doubles the ttk and you don't get the low recoil from the muzzle break

you have to find what works for you, 61h/61v/26ads works really well for me

Well, him and John Clark.

Same here. I’m one person on defense which is mozzie, and I rotate on offense depending on what the game needs

Hacks?

And Sledge broke a concrete wall.

Just because he's part of the team that participates in whatever that is, doesn't make him best. There are thousands of people who play better and not even trying to participate in tourneys. If you look at his MMR, his highest was 4146, there are people with over 8k+. Just because they some people want to compete, play well and active on social media, doesn't make them best in the world lol.

so , where is it ?

online siege is broken af, plus there is no verification those people don't use cheats, plus, it actually does, being a back to back S.I champ pretty much makes you the best in the world as a factual statement.

Yup, he is from Without Remorse (his backstory), Cardinal in the Kremlin, Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears, Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, then finally Rainbow Six.

So that was a fucking lie

Awesome! I like your drawing. There's one thing bothering me. Fuze is aiming with the other eye, not with the right eye. Good job mate

I don't know who Pengu is, but I've always wanted the 1 HS mechanic to be removed or toned down by a lot, not everyone that likes this idea or agrees with it is because they're blindly following another players opinion

Thanks! :)

Seems like they really like that dude, I was just trying to be rational. But I believe you might be right.

---
Your recoil control is super solid
---
It’s a good thing none of us work for Ubisoft, so it doesn’t matter how silly or pointless something seems! I personally am in favor of the 1 shot head shot mechanic being removed for my own personal reasons, but I’m glad that I don’t ever have to worry about some of you and your rude comments being in control of my content. End of the day Ubi is going to be Ubi and listen to their pros. If that makes you want to stop playing then cool, but what’s actually pointless is name-calling and dick measuring about who’s opinion is right for internet points. Real classy Reddit
---
And how do I not make sense ?
---
You get shot in the head irl, you're dead. that simple.
---
Ok thanks man

Sometimes I just want the skins to be elegant and simple like this one. Why does it have to be legendary.

I personally really like the hot rod.

Your calling me different things every time I don’t agree with you.

This beast knocks a 4ftish by 4ftish hole through a studs and drywall including any wires in one swing of that hammer. Like we should post him to r/abosluteunits

Wrong OP

You missed the title opportunity “all my friends are dead, push me to the edge”

Come to think of it, Why can't they just remove friendly fire? , the feature is not even that important.
---
You don’t like people team killing cheaters is the same as you support cheaters.

Did you get the dm?

Imagine how pro league players feel every time someone complains about spawnpeeking, "BB underpowered," or cav though.

I purposely put kapkan traps up high because people don't look for them at that height. Works way too well honestly.

Half the operators are wearing pretty bulletproof helmets, that argument has no ground.

Ye but he’s using G36C

yeah, good point. i was wrong
---
Kinda reminds me of a USP-S Cyrex from Counterstrike GO
---
Yeah they took a poll of which ones are gonna be in the next batch 4 months ago and results were posted 2 months ago. So some progress from then.
---
My take is that it should be removed but only for most of the weapons. Pistols and SMGs should take multiple shots, ARs need only take a couple, while shotguns and DMRs keep one shot. Armour might also need to affect it, having 1 armour reduces the amount of bullets to kill whereas 3 armour increases it.
---
Where can I get that skin? I love the meusoc
---
  by Avery Monsen and Jory John
---
Yeah but this 209lb 6ft3 mf can swing a hammer 12 times though 2X4 studs and drywall making a 4ftish by 4ftish hole in the wall in the span of 3 minutes.
---
Best feeling in the world is having blood spray out of someone’s head and your teammates saying “ you just missed”
---
The amount of times I've restarted that game. EXPLOOOOOOOSIOOOOONS!!!
---
Doc because heal and acog
---
I'm very new to the game and quickly realized why people say if you don't have any friends who play it it's not worth buying
---
I can’t figure out how to set this as my background on an iPad or iPhone X.
---
Yeah but ash is more widely known for being more toxic lol
---
Who has better weapons
---
in the Tom Clancy Novels it is confirmed that operators do simulations, they even complain about head shot registration.
---
It isn't on any of the lists so we won't know until someone does it and reports back.
---
very good
---
And a few of them I was playing with friends like that ace for example was a full squad of friends
---
Haven't seen that one actually
---
yeah that happens. you don't have to force quit battleye, you just force quit the siege exe
---
Dang alright guess I'll play the waiting game then.
---
Be the guinea pig we need
---
White knight the status quo! That reddit karma ain't gonna farm itself!
---
If you use laser sights regularly you get used to positioning a little differently than without. You shouldn’t hold say a door frame, instead position your sight a touch to the side for example. Depending on playstyle, the extra hipfire accuracy is nice to have.
---
Stop giving them ideas, they need to fix the game first
---
I mean if you’re going for steath then Cav has a better weapon. However Doc has an ACOG and can self-heal which are both really helpful.
---
I bet this is the lithium AAA + tinfoil mod
---
Just come play with my squad
---
Doesn’t show up in TM :(
---
You cannot yet change your name on PSN, it's at 8PM EST, in 17 minutes. They have a current list of games that are in a critical state if you do change your name, R6 was not one of them.
---
Ok thanks
---
How do you reason
---
There's a list of games that you can permanently lose data on, I don't recall siege being on that list. It might sign you out when you first open the game after changing your GT but nothing more.
---
I tried telling that to people when I got a Mira helmet that was all black, and they tried to tell me that it was the best legendary they have ever seen.
---
R4C Black Ice looks amazing!
---
Just because your sights on his head doesn’t mean that’s when you shot
---
I play on PC and this situation only happened to me once, since the game release. I don't have friends, but still have a nice time playing, so that statement isn't true. It is unfortunate that you had to face these braindead children, but it doesn't happen every match, does it?
---
You’re a shitter.
---
Do you see the sparks behind his head , that’s where my bullet landed
---
For all we know your shot just kicked up because of recoil
---
Wow .... lol
---
Challenge accepted.
---
Do you see where the bullet landed
---
In most cases,Doc,again,lul.
---
Caveira has one of the worst smgs. Doc is one of the only defenders who can not have only one acog,but two. Plus a really strong pump action shotgun but i gotta admit that Caveira shotgun is better due to the fire rate since it's a semi auto.
---
Doesn’t matter. If he was moving his head could’ve moved in front of where the bullet landed. You need a video
---
I'm not making excuses? And hes not an actual copper, you should actually read what I'm saying instead of being dense.
---
*M870
---
Hey I Donno if you're aware of this little fact but there are multiple teams that work on different aspects of this game. Like an art team and a development team. The art team doesn't fix bugs and shit you moron!
---
I love it!
---
Im gonna try this
---
It’s a joke you fucking idiot
---
How to get it though is the question.
---
In all seriousness, you should be open to playing almost any operator.
---
You should put music over it
---
R6 wasn't tested apparently. It wasn't in any of their lists.
---
A week ago I opened a pack and got black ice for the Glaz's gun and I only had 6 minutes played on him and my friend was in the same call as me and he has 17 hrs on Glaz. Was my first black ice as well, kinda bummed I don't play him.
---
It wasn't a very good one then.
