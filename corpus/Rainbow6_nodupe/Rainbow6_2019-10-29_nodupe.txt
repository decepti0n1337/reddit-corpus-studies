Level play isn‚Äôt a thing because there‚Äôs no correlation. Level just means you‚Äôve been playing for a while, but that doesn‚Äôt affect your skill. I‚Äôm a Gold 2. By your logic I could make a smurf and just continually play ranked with other people around my low level, regardless of actual stats. It‚Äôd be awful, and you‚Äôd have even less fun. The MMR restriction makes it so you are always playing with people in your skill range. And I‚Äôm sorry to say that if you deranked to copper than that may be where you‚Äôre at right now. Nothing wrong with it, it‚Äôs just the way it is. Worst case scenario just wait until the new season and try again.

It's not a glitch, it's just timing. The animation was already in mid swing and part of that animation is when your cable disconnects, the castle simply blocked the path as that happened, works with regular panels too. I had that happen on house in a custom game once.
---
Your team has been humiliated.
---
The packs are a joke.
---
Real big boy move is suppressed 5.7 so you can get hitmarkers on cameras.
---
Only if you hit it twice before
---
Unfortunately not but yesterday was especially shitty so it was much more impactful
---
I‚Äôm unsure about the canister mode but the warmup mode was meant to be an aim training sort of map I think, not really sure what ever happened to them however
---
I had my game crashed on the last round of a ranked game. We were 5 against 1, by the time I relunched the game the match was over. And I got a loss for it.

Love Ubi

I thought for sure it was John Carpenter. John does the voice intro to a song called Tech Noir by Gunship and this sounds just like him
---
Are you sure its not a heat based throttling issue? with you playing on your alt on times before the computer heats up
---
Is this true? I can‚Äôt find anything online saying there are rules on bullet caliber for use against people.
---
No, I just happen to know that movie logic regarding guns doesn't apply to real life. It's almost like people have hobbies or something.
---
Wait, destiny 2 was/is for free?
---
Yeah don‚Äôt know if it still is
---
I don't know what disgusts me more, the fact that you were able to pull that off or the fact you are using a reflex and not acog
---
Movie logic is dumb I will agree.
---
Is on pc or console? (im from pc btw)
---
I see
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pc  too
---
Haha I never thought of doing that but I will for sure try it, this is amazing if it works
---
I'd offer to play with you but as you can tell, you're better off without me.
---
Better find a way to do that without the bucket making a mess because that's a biiggg indicator
---
you idiot, you idiot
---
That makes no fucking sense from a mechanical perspective its only got 1 reciever and no technology can magically transform the shells in the mag from slug to buckshot.
---
your comment made me chuckle
---
I play PC btw. Don't know if that factors into anything...

The only problem is that they aren't as viable by being 3 armor since they move slower and make more noise in a game where movement and positioning is key.
---
How much do they ask you to do shit?
---
Lol that man is dumb af.
---
I'm sure mouse and keyboard doesn't work on most games because they don't support it. I'm hoping Ubisoft can do the same.
---
I don't think the rules of war apply in rainbow as there isn't a war going on.
---
But if we are adding operators who could be war criminals, I'd also add Caveira as she is slaughtering personnel who gave her information while they are in a DBNO state.
---
Every hour or so. And most of the times I won‚Äôt be able to go back to the match
---
My dumbass has always wondered why the mag was dented like a fucking tin can lol
---
I think he thinks this is the YouTube comment section, where plenty of low-effort comments are posted.
---
hA hA hA hA hA
---
Nah I‚Äôd rather not thanks. I‚Äôm just curious as I can‚Äôt find anything confirming this. And like, explosives can do all of those things aswell. 
---
I had a look at the weapons banned under the Geneva convention and it‚Äôs mostly chemical weapons. But also weaponised rodents. Apparently bat bombs are a thing.
---
Sneaky smonk boi
---
I had the same problem so I adapted and played while they're asleep but that's because I had a laptop and I had to not touch it for 3 and a half months so they would trust me and believe I was responsible.
---
Ubisoft doesn't allow mnk, people use these expensive adapters to trick the console so it thinks it's a controller. It will trick any game.
---
Could you talk to them, explain the problem and ask if they can perhaps ask when they want a few things rather than every hour which just sounds ridiculous?
---
smonk: time to make world war 2 look like a tea party
---
Sounds like a good counter to Echo
---
New Kanal rework! I was walking on the street in between the 2 buildings üòä

Sounds to me like you just don‚Äôt enjoy the game. Try taking a break? Come back in a couple weeks?

Wtf.

just when i thought elites couldnt look any uglier ubi releases this??

At the top, it clearly says ‚ÄúInstallation still in progress.‚Äù  You can‚Äôt play until it‚Äôs done.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm connected to the internet and it‚Äôs not laggy or anything, it‚Äôs just not downloading I guess? I‚Äôm so confused lol I just wanna play
---
I know but when the operator can't use holding angles as a consistent strategy like Maestro or Echo, they aren't very well received. Granted they also have great utility but the point is that we've only had one 3 armor dlc attacker and probably because 3 armor attackers aren't great. Maybe in lower ranks like mid to low gold and below where there aren't as many headshots but as far as higher level play goes, 3 speeds are always going to be seen as better.
---
The game is still installing. It says so in the left corner.
---
No I think it's got to the point where you should give everyone the choice to use mnk
---
I say it like 40 times but I think it‚Äôs still you buddy.
---
Reason why it‚Äôs common.
---
Sad that im on the eas server where everybody cant speak english and forces you to speak chinese and says rude things about you

So that is right? I was looking it up and some people said it was a bug so I didn‚Äôt think much of it but thanks lol
---
&gt; there is no such thing as "objectively better"

&gt; less 3d rendered models

Oh, flamingo pink eye. You can get it at home. I got the old gear off my dad
---
I know I just thought it was a bug... big brain amirite
---
I am playing with a controller I don‚Äôt want to have and learn to play mnk so no they shouldn‚Äôt permit this. If you want to play with a mnk go on PC.

You know this would completely ruin the console version of Siege?

You only face plats and golds if you constantly win in casual. It uses the same Skill Based matchmaking system that rank uses. 
---
Any newer player will get matched with silvers or below when they start. If they lose a few matches they'll drop to copper like skill level in casual.

Does this mean that if a Zofia got onto the same platform she could pick herself up and be stuck down there?

I know I know... this guy was playing for his first time. But I‚Äôm just saying I rather be a melee lurcher than a recruit. The gun in COMPARISON to the 3 other ops, the gun feels useless especially when your hammers don‚Äôt need to reload and one shot enemies. Thus the guns only advantage is the range, which doesn‚Äôt matter when nearly all fights are one sided close quarters fight.
---
I don‚Äôt get it. What‚Äôs so complex about making the debris always fall to the ground client-sided? It has nothing to do with being in sync. I‚Äôm not saying all debris should fall the same way, I‚Äôm just saying make it never get stuck in the first place.

you must be new to Reddit but anyways take my downdoot
---
I didn't even buy it, I watched some other people play it and it didn't seem that interesting to me. It could still be a well made game with wide appeal but it's not what I am looking for.
---
It‚Äôs because the mags are reflective. If you‚Äôre out in the field you tape stuff that makes noise or is reflective so the enemy has a harder time detecting you.
---
Notice the first shot after the guy is a headshot too.
---
...zoom zoom....
---
I knew it was on the a lol idk why I put it on the o
---
I‚Äôm getting the cod soon, but when I played the beta and played a little bit of cod mobile. It felt like a breeze, like every kill was so predictable. I actually felt kinda bored, but I didn‚Äôt play the beta all that much. My brothers say it‚Äôs really good so I don‚Äôt know
---
I'd rather fuck a box of hungry piranhas instead of playing that shit excuse of a game it's one of the worst things I've ever experienced
---
not bad for controller
---
I have to go... My people need me
---
Honest question, you running MnK?
---
i honestly dont care if its fair or not, im just interested how it would look like.
---
this deviates a lot from what i see usually posted on this sub thats why i got curious.
---
SUre what platform and region?
---
Red dots make it easier to focus on the enemy. Unlike the BLINDING GREEN of the reflex
---
please give us the option to choose between the old and new style ubi plz and thank u also bosg acog
---
I split it with my friend that‚Äôs the only reason I got it and I don‚Äôt even feel like playing anymore. I‚Äôm just sick of the whole run-shoot-die-respawn-repeat formula. And the maps are boring as hell. I found myself instantly switching the Siege right as my friends got off.
---
We should have an option to just disable that, I also prefer to have an static image as a menu.
---
most people who have high ping can‚Äôt help that, and if your complaining about toxicity then quit the game. This game is extremely toxic. Other than that I agree with everything else
---
Bruh i tried this like 13times , ended up enemy shooting me in
---
It‚Äôs pretty boring imo. Ground war is sorta fun but TDM is just spawn trapping in shitty 3 lane maps
---
It's not realistic, because real thermal scope wouldn't lose its effectiveness when you move.
---
Usage of the word cringe is just as if not more so than this stupid article
---
Have you tried shooting the claymore in Modern Warfare? You die. Totally like what?
---
My brother showed me gameplay of a ground war match, and I already realized how exploited the spawn system is gonna be

This game isn‚Äôt one that you can pick up and instantly be good at. Getting shit on as a beginner is part of the intense learning curve. There‚Äôs so much that goes into each round that you really can‚Äôt expect to be good without learning from others

"I don't know what the fuck just happened. But i don't really care Im about to get the fuck up outa here, fuck this shit im out."

Ehh
---
I believe it is just controller. There are no quick micro adjustments to his/her aim. In places where the person is just outside their crosshair they move to adjust their like people on controller do. Like the last kill on the first clip, they crouch and move left to track the enemy while slowly dragging their aim down. This would be likely controller with them accidentally moving their right stick with the left. Someone on MnK would adjust their aim upwards to go for the head. Sorry for the long response, just wanted to give reasons for my thought. Basically they are good on controller or bad with MnK

No....

This is the best theory I've seen here.

no its on point of what i wanted to know. thx a lot for taking your time.

i havent played shooters on console since the release of halo 2 and i didnt even own a xbox so i dont really have much experience on that platform, thats why i got curious

I miss having this map in ranked.....

imagine doing this with the new kapkan skin lol

I'd have legit had an emotional overload of laughter, but angry sadness.

Lmao, i was cheerfully teabagging then the ash stopped revive that's when we all swarmed to get the revive. That's why i thought this video was funny, we were genuinely trying to find the revive prompt.
---
That headgear is sooo cool
---
Frost is too
---
I'm pretty sure Yokai/Mozzie drone cams become useless when outside similar to when attacker drones get Muted.

Imo the skill of an average platinum has increased a lot since then (also returning player)

What's it actually based on?
---
What mask is that? Mute wears a C50 and the airsoft equivilent is an M50 (but has square filters) so, I guess my question is where did you get that gas mask?
---
Came into a match and as soon as it loaded my team was down 2 people. Didn't even see the notification that they left the game. 
---
Now this is extremely upsetting cause that match should have been cancelled, at the very least don't take 50 points away from my rank.

They did it to apparently "ease the frustration".
---
The very nature and design of her gadget capitalises on bad communication and coordination. She's literally supposed to be a weapon against bronzes and silvers. Because anywhere above, the amount or communication and coordination increases and she becomes useless. Any coordinated team will watch flanks well or have enough utility to roam clear. She becomes instantly useless against stacks.
---
If you really want to make Cav better you have to redesign and rework her gadget from the ground up, why they are never going to.
---
E: getting team killed for no apparent reason
---
yep, but u cant use gadgets thru it then thats what i mean
---
Get over here !!! Ala scorpion would be cool

I hate my team getting spawn peeked after I warned them about a broken barricade sound
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have gone out tonight people

Guys I think there something wrong with my account I have 1 black ice I'm level 120
---
Playing ranked without a fucking mic/not giving proper callouts
---
Ok I have to think through this
---
A: See my main, and haven't really gotten the problem where one Jackal always scans me
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
B: Haven't come up against it but don't want to either
---
C: I hate it
---
D: I don't get spawn peeked anymore since i know the locations that people frequently spawn peek (and love to get that kill) and I do it myself only on casual, because it's fun.
---
So it's down to B&amp;C
---
Haven't seen B yet, so C?
---
Nope. Thatcher's only ability is to be spawn peeked no matter what.
---
And you want to shoot dogs because?

Looks like he layed down and sprinted at the same time thus giving him a speed boost, probably

Twitch is one of the best operators with alot of fragging potential because she has the best gun in the game, also she comes with a good gadget that can get rid of most of the electronics that the defenders have. Ubisoft: Ehhh we'll remove 5 bullets from her gun, seems fine

Make it so he has a separate weapon without reserve mags. This operator would be strong. Here is a suggestion for the loadout:
---
- Speed: 2
---
- Armor: 2
---
- Primary Weapon: Aug A3 Para, M1014
---
- Secondary Weapon: PRB92
---
- Secondary Gadget: Breaching Charges, Claymore
---
- Main Ability: SR-25 AMR
---
"a highly modified SR-25, uses Anti Material Rounds"
---
&gt; Damage: 80 (0-24m), 50 (40+m)
---
&gt; RPM: 200 (semi auto)
---
&gt; Magazin: 4+1
---
&gt; Reserve Ammo: -
---
&gt; ADS-Time: 350 ms (same as Yings T-95 LSW)
---
&gt; Recoil: SR-25 recoil, but 10% stronger 
---
&gt; Attachments (integrated, cannot be customized): Scope (same as M249), Muzzle Brake
---
This weapon can shot through reinforced walls, but the damage will be reduced to 25% of the original damage. A headshot through a reinforced wall will result in a DBNO for the defender. It will not go through two reinforced walls.

Thacher had some beans before operation time

Or the alternative bad call outs like "he's over there"
---
Even after all the nerfs he's sti one of the best performing attackers. He would be broken even if his shield had 1 hp. Ubisoft is right to keep nerfing him into the ground, with his terrible design it's a better alternative than having him be played more.

That's dope, now all you need is a blitz shield and you have a team blinding duo lmao

his u/ does check out

Its cool

True that
---
E: When you get teamkilled and their response is ‚Äòyou stole my kill‚Äô
---
He even spelt it wrong he's very confused
---
I got that on my second alpha pack
---
What about the droid attack on the wookies?
---
I only use him for the deagle and i rarely use his ar
---
Yeah but the next packs get bonuses to your technically out some credits if you do that.
---
Have fun playing R6 man u won't regret it
---
Still better than syringe charm
---
G E K O L O N I S E E R D
---
Yes.
---
Believe it or not. I do play tachanka, a lot. I end up using his shotgun more than his turret 9/10. But you're right people do underestimate it. I had 4 people try to push me from the front, in a ranked game
---
Hell yeah I spent 15 dollars on this game 2 years ago, prob best thing i could have done with the money
---
the music is better too. I think having static menu screens is probably a good idea as my XB1X sounds like its preparing for lift off in the menu.
---
Cosplayception?
---
I've never had a match where someone spawn peeks from bedroom. It's mostly on border where I get spawn peeked.
---
Divine intervention
---
Thatcher counters every electronic character
---
Mozzie should be able to hack it
---
Says who?
---
Evil Pumpkin so very ready
---
I feel like this would be more useful on defense
---
"He is in the building!!!"
---
Jackal.  Fuck Jackal.
---
Why not play nokk at that point then? She‚Äôs sneaky and she‚Äôs got a deagle.
---
Don't we all regret it from time to time 
---
_cries in Blackbeard nerf_
---
Ik it's useless....it may work if I put it through floors for a sight below but once the enemy gets spotted he can find and shoot it
---
Good point  i should buy her thanks
---
But do you expect garage murder hole spawnpeek though?
---
E: These low effort meme reposts.
---
When you learn to spawnpeak a ton playing doc you learn how to dodge other spawnpeakers quite easily, or actually get kills from them.. So I'd say C since spawn peaking is either im the one doing it or killing them.
---
Logic? Who would do that?
---
The medium pack is twice as big and a bit more pricier than twice, what stops you from buying the small one twice instead?
---
Spawn peeking is a bitch like play the game how you‚Äôre supposed to, at least give one team a chance to have fun.
---
B
---
well most of the legendaries are pretty good and have taken a lot of effort, the only one I can think of that maybe shouldn't be legendary is the pink camo. Yes I know some of them are one the lines of a base color and then a line or two, but that's only a few of them.
---
I‚Äôve spawnpeeked once and it was with doc shotgun, so if I‚Äôm spawnpeeking definitely not D
---
&gt;the counter is to shoot it when it appears through the wall so maybe it can be like the gu mine and invisible when it goes through a breakable surface
---
At which point you'd be better off taking maverick as his gadget also works through reinforced walls
---
everytime i get randoms with mics they just chew into it or speak spanish...one of the few times i had randos that talked one said he was muting me bc i was giving too many callouts ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I did fall victim to that actually, partially cause I just lost all ability to aim.
---
Meanwhile a completely new 3d model and texture for the Halloween headgear is epic. Lmao.
---
Still waiting for a refund.
---
I bought it from the shop
---
Dipshits who think it will make it easier to aim with.
---
It took me a minute to actually notice the glasses lol
---
I need it, stop pushing to not have it.
---
This was before that
---
E: no bosg acog &gt;:(
---
You forgot the Dokk/Lion combo
---
I've seen this same picture before... if i find it ill link it
---
Yeah, but if they feel it's too good of a spot they'll make it obsolete, just like they did with purple tarps and that little ledge over the stairs in garage.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of anyone complaining about skins being too over powered to the point where you can‚Äôt see the other player. 
---
You can make use of this ‚Äúissue‚Äù yourself, unless you‚Äôre wearing the ‚ÄúRainbow is magic‚Äù uniforms or something bright in color. 
---
Just drone things out or use sounds, it‚Äôs really not that hard to see your enemies. 
---
Up your screens brightness too if that‚Äôll help.
---
A. Hate it when I'm hiding in a dark corner but when I anchor obj it feels amazing knowing that Jackel wasted a charge

How to get the Operator emblems next to your name?  Like ela main for example
---
THANK YOU

---
Whoops, it looks like multiple other people had the same thing, but this isnt a repost. Sorry!
---
No it‚Äôs fine
---
I came, I saw, I nutted to IQ's THICC ass
---
Is all of the above an option?
---
You have to pay nothing more than basic game.  
---
The main basic operators cost 500-1000 and you can do whatever. Are very good. Then playing you get "points" for unblock more.  
---
Then , by wining you get customitations of skins, weapons,etc.  
---
Advice: in the ubisoft club there is a free booster. After playing a bit, do all training challenges with boost so you will beging game with a lot of points for unlocking operators ("renown" points)  
---
It's a great game. I recomend you  
---
Ah, and the topic, not at all. maybe a pay to loose, if you get a glowy skin. Basic operators and skins are the best. Maybe then you can unlock 3-4 more. but dont actually need.
---
Lol
---
True.
---
I don't see how LAN guarantees no ghosts but k

Was he currently plat 1 or was he previously plat 1?
---
Console gameplay feels so weird to watch bc of the movement it gives me an uneasy feeling

Seems like a good idea however the visuals would be a hard thing to do in a multiplayer game, a single player game itself easy to do but multiplayer would be incredible hard.

---
E. Kicking the last guy alive
---
If the kills weren't significantly impactful, they mean less than playing the objective.
---
If you want realism just remember the multiplayer that we‚Äôre playing is all a simulation. Meaning not everything should make sense, so the defusing animations are fine as is. It‚Äôs better than what it was before.

But I'm a 12 year old so it's good isnt it ?
---
Ya know, why is mute not immune to smokes he is wearing a gas mask

Well since I roam phones but on attack defiantly spawn peeking
---
I mean if you can have a sound and visual queue of a camera you are going to avoid being spotted on it

G: Getting Shot through my shield.
---
The one fucking time I don't prefire hookah window I get spawnpeaked. The one fucking time

currently plat 1
---
What the fuck did you just say to me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I joined the GIGN at 11 years old and have been involved in numerous anti-terrorist missions with Team Rainbow, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.
---
Isn‚Äôt this 17+?
---
N√∏kk.
---
********D********
---
Ur mom
---
It came out back when parabellum went live
---
Non-intentional teamkilling is bad too
---
How so? If they were placed before joining up, it could? Unless something changed drastically since last I played ranked.
---
i don't have enough for the elite skins so im not sure if i should get the jager rogue uniform
---
Sorry by pack I meant the jager uniform. Mb
---
Can anyone help me get a clear HD picture of all the ‚ÄúExterminators‚Äù icons ? I really want lions red one
---
ok
---
That‚Äôs within the 1000mmr r age so it is possible
---
because I'm pretty sure the restriction should still apply to stacks
---
You cant rush on defense unless you run outside or something
---
Man, you could not be more wrong
---
Kapkan, you lurk in the shadows until your edd goes off and run at the speed of molasses to get the kill
---
I like vigil, not the greatest gadget but good guns, maybe bandit or J√§ger
---
The MP7 has less damage at 32, making 480 DPS. This is not much for an attacker. N√∏kk does have a good gadget, but she has to make kills to have an effect on the rounds. Only being 'invisible' to cams does not make her useful.
---
The MP7 does not have an ACOG and lower DPS than nearly any attacker primary weapon. It will give her the True fragging potential she needs.
---
Also it will not be 'Twitch all over again'. Twitch is so strong, because she es great utility with her gadget, witch is always useful and her F2 is one of the Top 5 weapons in the game. N√∏kk would be good with the MP7, but she will definitely not be OP. Being invisible to cams is nice, but will only get you so far.
---
I would recommend mute or kapkan

ok that clears my mind

Its been ages since Ive played ranked, so I'm kind of out of the loop.

it‚Äôll run it but unless you‚Äôre traveling a lot and aren‚Äôt home a lot i would still recommend a desktop. also that cpu is definitely iffy

yeah but i already got the season pass once because of the weapon skin and i could grind in game and get more renown now that i have everything
---
RIP Monty
---
I know, right? I thought it was all over there, but somehow I slipped past him. Thankfully they had that hatch open, they probably would‚Äôve clapped my cheeks if they didn‚Äôt lol

Looks like you‚Äôve been blessed
---
I run mine with a 6700k and a 5700xt, get about 210 to 250fps. I have a friend who plays it fairly high with 120fps with a 6600k and a 1060. We bot run Asus VG248QE monitors
---
You can't tell from gameplay video.
---
Ok
---
Dude, and ping abusers from Asian servers, so aids.
---
I mean not necessarily, they do stuff like that for lesion traps alrighty with that border and other stuff, it could just be a flawed thinking on my part but if they can do something like that how much harder would hallucinations be?
---
Yep its still free, thank you too much, i always wanted to play destiny but i was definitely not going to 60 bucks for it
---
It looks like OP wants to have a IQ-like screen on the op's wrist to view the feed. If so, the engine won't be able to handle it. I recall the devs saying they can only render one camera output on screen at a time. If it were a placeable cam that you can check later, like valk, maestro, etc. it should work fine.
---
not to mention she is always banned in ranked i haven't used reddit in rainbow six for a while i only use it for advice
---
no point playing games like this maxed out

yea am still new to this.

This is amazingly done
---
i can‚Äôt tell you how many frames you‚Äôd get
---
Yea I see that, best of luck to you
---
Looks great!
---
You have no particular idea of how much it would cuck your CPU and GPU simulatenously
---
Well, most people with the high pings are the people who change their native data center to West Coast and connect from China or South Korea. If I have 9 ping living in California, and Canadians get a max of 50 with my east coast friend getting 60, people with higher than 100, (usually 150) are probably connecting from a different region. It's an actual thing.
---
In my old computer i have 30 fps, so if it runs at 30 fps its enough for me, but if it can run at more of 30 fps its good for me
---
That legendary is from the midseason event back in wind bastion, road to si.
---
They gave free packs like usual, maybe you just forget about it.
---
It's his invitational uniform from the invitational alpha packs
---
Best thing to do is to reach out to helpful players in the community. There are many (including me) that go out of our way to play with new players and help them learn. Biggest problem is getting over your own mental block and taking the time to learn the game and make good habits.
---
Already risky enough planting breach charges or yings gadget  (can't ever spell the damned thing)  
---
Having to place something and stand in front of the barricade is almost suicide .
---
It‚Äôs from the invitational packs back in February, maybe you got it and just forgot
---
You could maybe even do it with no damage and just the hallucinations, they're more likely to notice the damage than to notice the hallucinations and just pull out the dart, and maybe even have the effects last for a few seconds even after they pull the dart out as if the operator was just flushing the hallucinagins out of his system.
---
It really depends on how focused the enemies are. If they are focused on the game, they will realise their depleting health due to nothing and take out the dart. 
---
If your not focused, the dart can stay lodged for potentially 1 minutes. By then, it has to be obvious you are struck and hallucinating.
---
Make it for defense, it can snake through reinforced walls. I feel like at that point its useful.
---
He dodged to your left and knifed you. You didn't move.
---
1070 could do it. My 1060 can almost get  144fps
---
Who is this guy, has he a YouTube channel like Coconutbrah!?ü§î

---
Refunds made in game are not processed unless you were double charged for failed transactions. You can lock your account in future and let your friends or relatives play on a secondary account if you feel like their "retarded" decisions will be the result of your dissapointment.
---
So that explains why he can extemd his shield: The small one wasn't enough to fully cover him as he grew bigger (and thicker).
---
It doesn't decrease the size of your hitbox that's so blantantly false. If you so it slower that defeats the purpose of the spam.
---
Nobody should ever hit tachanka, intentionally or not
---
Got a legendary capitao headgear and it'snjust a different style of hat, but it looks the exact same.
---
Pn dude
---
And that's completely fair, if it's effectively a 6th operator it should be treated as such, I more saw it as a bit of a twitch but could also detect people but could only detect gadgets one at a time, and having some offensive capabilities by, only taking off 25 health when it attacks and when it does it stuns or holds on to the defender it attacks making them unable to shoot, but when you shoot the defender your dog is on you have to be careful not to shoot your dog, I could honestly see this as being a very viable op, maybe even taking away drones from said op in exchange for the dogs scouting capabilities, but that would raise the issue of him being shot in the prep phase, if you get one drone in the prep phase that self destructive at the end of the phase with exception of being hacked by a Mozzie, or Muted by a jammer, I think this could balance him fairly well
---
On pc, you can expand a menu on the box with the name of the sub and edit your tag here.
---
On mobile, go to the main page on the sub, click on the 3 dots on the top right and it should be there
---
Both maps are bad to play, does not matter if you are a defender or attacker. Reworks Next year would be nice
---
Click the 3 little dots on the main page then go on add flair and pick the one you want.

You sir seem to be a master baiter

Jeez thats so epic! There like soooooo different! They should honestly ban the head gear it's so cool
---
Plot twist Montagne is the name of the shield
---
If they do what they did this year I‚Äôd like a new map, those two reworked and another map, maybe Favela or something reworked. I would be ok if there was no new map next year as there are plenty available and a lot of them could use some form of a rework.
---
Instructions unclear, accidently broke the shield
---
What? Why is this on the siege subreddit

Montagne‚Äôs melee range was too short in several instances, so we‚Äôve given him a *fukin laser sword* to help balance him out

That's rlly fuckin good! But why does he have 2 visors lol
---
i have zero clue what you tried to say in your last sentence but i can tell you right now the hitbox decreases when activating lean. this is just a fact. and as i explained, he does it a tiny bit slower so it still works almost as good as pre patch. believe me i have encountered this shitty meta countless times.
---
Sick

Your response proves you're a piece of shit. Don't need you here get out.

My wife made me siege biscuits and a cake, not requested at all. Humans by instinct buy things for people based on their interests, in this case siege players like siege content. Either the items are home made or bought (based on the small amount of official merchandise available) its just much easier to make the "six" logo on a cake than it is to part ‚Ç¨100 for 5 vinyl figures.

IQ and Sofia should be moved up considering the current technology their abilities could be completely plausible.

maybe your drone could act as this kinda cam and could burrow into the walls and act like a snake cam
---
You lose all mobility and anyone over silver rank has the ability to aim. 
---
So imo. Just go for cover you‚Äôll have a better chance of moving to cover than returning fire.

The difference in velocity is extremely marginal, if any, however brass can expand quite a bit when hot and hotter brass can cause jams and misfeeds in a weapon with tighter tolerances. So it‚Äôs actually the opposite. Hotter ammo can cause poorer performance.

Definitely. That shotgun is just.....ok-ish. wouldn't mind that being replaced.

That is weird.

Lol. I always pay attention to the weapon shapes and points, so it only took me twice

I officially converted my flair to N√∏kk. I'm an official Nokk main! HEAR THE MATING CALL OF THE NOKK *uwus in spook*
---
No like to destroy grenades
---
Hear hear.....oh wait, I can't.
---
Randomly went into my inventory one day to find an f2 black ice.
---
Never put it on. Still don't.
---
why add more attachments when what we have is perfectly fine. maybe more optics but they already do. what they sure do is you can use any optic type on any gun that‚Äôll be cool but not needed. also most players don‚Äôt know what the barrels really do
---
Imagine that thing casually licking your ear when you wesr them.
---
I refer you to an earlier post of mine https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dodlx7/if_you_leave_while_down_in_a_match/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Oh weird. I hadn‚Äôt seen that.
---
Yes i want cav to sit on my face
---
I heard through the grapevine that it is actually getting an ACOG
---
Mutes smg, just got thermites gun yesterday
---
Yeah I get that, but at least let us report m&amp;kb players so they can manually check if they are actually using m&amp;kb. Yes XIM masks it but its so obvious when someone uses m&amp;kb so this shouldnt be too hard tbh.
---
I like this idea. No one expects bullets from below.

My Uncle spent 40 years in an industry he completely bullshitted his way into back in the 70's. Said he needed a job and heard that one paid really good money. Studied it enough to bullshit his way in. When he went for the interview the interviewer was in a big hurry cause it was the end of the day and beginning of the weekend. He got lucky and one of his first co-workers  took him under his wing and taught him the ropes.

Well the point of Castle is that you have to choose what to break and where to go, which is what the defenders want. For example if Zof breaks two barricades she can't destroy a Maestro cam. The same with Ash. And then defenders may have barb in a choke point. People don't value Castle as a team operator. They just look at the kit from an individual perspective. There are so many strats I run with Castle that are borderline broken because of him. His ulility is is crazy when you factor in impacts or the bulletproof.
---
Thats probably an issue with the wikia, which isn't affiliated with ubi and is edited by fans
---
We weren‚Äôt expecting special forces.

Oh shit he‚Äôs back

What muzzle is that? And What do you play on PM me your gamer tag if you‚Äôre on Xbox
---
I think that would make 9.

Some mains are luckier than others T_T
---
Where I started back on the days of source. It's a different beast and you need to learn the angles and peeks play in casual for awhile and learn the maps, some are not in rotation.
---
What?!!
---
walls and floors. wld be useless on windows and barricades obviously.

finally something small enough for my dick

That might not be UBIs fault though. This is from the Fandom wiki, not the official website. Can't confirm if the error is in-game or not as I dont have access to a PC right now.

Nonsense, the most under-18 conscription happened in the first year of the war, when trench warfare wasn't even a thing yet.
---
The society of the 1910s idolized fighting, especially fighting for one's own country. Past european wars had lasted a few months to a year or two and were very light in casualties compared to WW1, so serving in wars was seen as desirable by both young and old.
---
What if they add all the custom game modes to quarantine?
---
Get some friends that are on your skill level, do some custom games to get used to it again, and then play some casual. If anyone says anything rude through mic you can mute them.
---
But ours is ugly as fuck, guess I'll become a cab main
---
Sleep? Whats sleep

soft walls and floors. barricades wld be useless

I love Ela‚Äôs elite. As well as other casual clothing like Smoke‚Äôs. To each their own i guess...

Then it really was unexpected.

Reminds me of the Tuxbird playing with my dad video, he has like little baby cartoon rook in the thumbnail

This post wasn‚Äôt tagged as spoiler or anything. I turned on reddit and it was right there

Maybe respect the devs and stop leaking shit before they are ready to show it

try to practice in casual, not ranked, in ranked the times I've almost given up on this game are unreal, so until you get a mic (optional) just practice in casual, also complete all situations as they help with the core fundementals.

It‚Äôs labelled as leak

Ight Im gonna head out

Thats why i used the word often. These two arent mutually exclusive, both happened

I‚Äôve marked it as spoiler you happy, sir?

That is correct

Some dude did it to us one game. Now I do it every time.

Yeah... but yknow... gotta save that copper II

Guess i have a raging boner now :/

No

Well you could have a fuze put his cluster charge on a door and his snake eye on it aswell and when someone's close he'll know. Only good thing.

I love the outfit but I hate haircolor and the end of match scene, especially the end of match scene

Wholeheartedly agree

*screeching*

yes

Counterpoint: yes
---
This could be a nice alternative to just spamming terrorist hunts. Thanks for the suggestion.

My first black ice was also p9, i guess it's good for Montague but it could have been better.
---
No because I already saw it
---
And no because leaking stuff in general is fucked up
---
Ya latley I've been having this happen to me as well as being shot before my camera even rounds a corner so I don't have a chance to get a shot on them even with prefire
---
Play the game
---
r/angryupvote

I would keep my drones and place these in key flanking spots. Basically a way to watch your flanks kind of like nomad. Having it be able to go thru floors would be great way as well so you can get a cam on site from the ceiling.
---
What did I say that you don‚Äôt understand?
---
Lots of things are though, yet you dont see people getting arrested for them. Like piracy.
---
Sounds interessting. Only to clarify me comment to this: I wanted someone who works with Cav, not necessarily as lovers, but good friends. Would be interesting to ad Twitch to the mix :D
---
it's called Mutant Splatter
---
Yes
---
But then you‚Äôre standing somewhere totally exposed looking at the ceiling a roamer will kill you all day
---
Pulse isnt op you can hear him put away and get out his cam and if you catch him with if out hes screwed.
---
She's so nice
---
Yeah i saw you post that. I mean I don‚Äôt really care for it but I recognise the significance of an event like this.
---
There‚Äôs millions of players it wouldn‚Äôt divide it
---
 that much
---
I wondered at first why this was marked nsfw until like 1:30 in.

I mean they aren't trash. You're trash for getting slammed by an easy to counter play. Stay mad piss baby.

what does that have to do with being french /s

Looks like Chloe from the Uncharted Series.

RIP Hitbox

P90.

C4.
---
Done.
---
Super sexist
---
I mean with only 6 Rounds and a fairly long reload time compared to the semiautomatic sidearms, it would be a pretty cool feature. On the other hand it would probably be overpowered as fuck.
---
Not really.
---
Respect. Shoulder charge isn‚Äôt actually all that bad but bonus points if you don‚Äôt use that either.
---
Bring it on.  I play so much casual.  Having a way to get rewarded for all that playing would be great.  I'd pay for it in a heartbeat, but really it should hopefully be included in the season pass, which I buy every year.
---
That accuracy on the lion thoüëå

Why does it say unlimited time???

As I go to the gym I do try to take care of my knees and my joints in wrists and elbows

I personally don't like the army as I have problems with authority. But I respect the hell out of the people who are in there. Seems like a great way to discipline yourself.

AR 15.50 and M249

I prefer the M4 but the semi can be solid and has those classic carry handle irons.

It realy doesent matter as long as you have a silenser on mav. It takes away the shot marker things, bullet trail, and alot of noise. With thise gone it us going to be very frustrating trying to find your little peak hole. (Sorry for my bad english)

Actually against smokes he is pretty good. I know I‚Äôm stating the obvious but I play as a 5 man and say chalet garage we just hard push, smoke monty plant. And realistically the only way they can stop it is if their valk is already there to C4 us or they have a warden. So he is purely situational.
---
This rook has shotty, what would you expect?
---
T5 SMG I‚Äôd love to see it on another operator or Elas scorpion
---
Was this ranked or unranked? Because there‚Äôs no way the ranked system would have allowed this.
---
All game developers have roadmaps for the strategic announcement of certain things. Leaks fuck up those roadmaps
---
Bruh
---
Some people in the comments were considering that Twitch is just a friend trying to help Cav with her anti-social problems, and that they are not necessarily romantically involved, which does sound more plausible given that Cav's psychological report mentions signs of anti-social personality disorder.
---
Nah if anything it builds hype I feel like
---
Lmao
---
lmao. I'm a bit proud of that one.
---
Cleanse them with fire
---
You‚Äôll figure it out as you go. Knowing the maps is probably more important than anything. That and how different operators and their gadgets work is also really helpful.
---
Yea, I‚Äôm not reading that.
---
2 if it keeps its silenced damage it will deal 82 damage

Sounds more likely

Or you could stop whining and accept that the acog was taken away for a good reason

No... It can‚Äôt be...

Yes i totaly aggre. Doc dosent have the halloween skin!

The dates of the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure were  Nov 20, 1979 ‚Äì Dec 4, 1979 so he was 11

I wonder if I can get some art of this posted on the "other" sub before it's released.

Ah, I see.

It‚Äôs not a proper leak if the camera quality isn‚Äôt shit if you ask me.

Yeah I‚Äôm shocked they tracked it down so effectively. A+ work on their part.

Lol i was downed as attacker and instead of covering me, monty literally moved aside for defenders to claim the kill.
---
That works.  Jokes aside, the callouts you use don't matter as long as your team knows em.
---
My strategy was to go for a flank while my team had a shootout with them so I didn't really expect anyone to be on that Mira after my team got a kill
---
But she's so nice
---
Now I'm terrible but I'm no where near this...I hope
---
It was also unranked so I really didn't care what happened lol
---
What‚Äôs your uplay?

Yeah. Funnily enough, this is also the reason why Gandhi is so aggressive in Civilization. His aggression level is 0 so if he becomes more pacifistic it underflows into being hyper aggressive.

Reinforcing kids, the ultimate strat

I've only got ~20 hrs in this game and barely any map knowledge (this was one of the tiny pieces of knowledge I have) so using that breach charge to create a second entry point and essentially win the round for my team felt pretty good.
---
1st part - Scoping out area with drone, noticed there was the entire team in the same room  
---
2nd part - Sped up by 50%, carefully moving because I wasnt sure what I was doing  
---
3rd Part - Breach charge and killing 4 enemies, with my previously pinned down team mate coming in and finishing off the other one, wiping out the whole team in seconds
---
I think, and don‚Äôt quote me on this, but ubi said they wanted to do this

When Game Pass Ultimate (Gold + Game Pass) released, you could have upgraded your Gold membership to GPU for just $1. I had just bought 1 year of Gold like a month before and upgraded and have Game Pass as well for a year for $1 lol. The $1 offer is still there but I'm not sure if it upgrades your current membership like it did back then and just offers the first month for $1.
---
You can‚Äôt get tilted if you use the sweet business.

Seriously it‚Äôs so absurd you can‚Äôt be mad

I agree, but honestly mnk on console is a more widespread problem they have been pretty quiet about.

Where can I find a thing like this on thatcher
---
See you missed the point, he was helping them out lol

oh sorry ill fix it

Nothing they can do. That‚Äôs a Microsoft/Sony problem

Most importantly don‚Äôt let people tell you what to use and don‚Äôt feel guilty for using a certain loadout unless it‚Äôs LoW level bullshittery

Oh yeah for the altitude

On console,

Higher sens: more finite control (good for headshots)

Lower sens: more broad control (good if you have trouble staying on target at all, aiming for body shots)

The only time hes ever banned on pc is when there is a garage site coming from gold 1-plat 3 player bit other than that barely ever banned

This is really good especially for a new playerüëç

Ehh, 4

Elongated glaz

Imagine if he was using Hibana‚Äôs AR lol

Don‚Äôt remember them ever saying that but it would be a welcome addition.

Not without network infrastructure rivaling Cloudflare's, no - but Ubi is only trying to identify DDOSers and ban them directly.

NO NO NO NO NO STOP GET HELP

Will it be possible to unlock these skins with renown?

play super high sens and spray miss all your shots but one lucky headshot. seems to kill me every time

yes... yyeeesss... YYYEEESSSSS

Just like Jager ingame
---
When you load into ranked with no teammates and the enemy team is still worried about losing the match
---
Why would repost this?
---
I‚Äôm getting rainbow six Vegas vibes here
---
No idea how that second shot hit
---
Just ignore them. Unranked and ranked are less toxic.
---
Possibly but also possible to be good player, I had kills that looks "funny" because I learnt to just fire at sound ques, and it's will look like I'm using "soft walls hack" but I've just learnt to play from sound que, with a good headset and understanding how sound works and travels around a map, you can get some very questionable kills somewhat often.
---
Hard to say if you don't have any recording of it, sorry
---
That is very true.
---
what can you do
---
I was just looking for my business cards...
---
ik, but i cant even voice chat or send messages now
---
Grunting noises intensify
---
I'm confused why you're confused
---
I still stand by what I said, unless someone is literally in prison for this its just more corporate babble to make the players feel like Ubi cares about them.
---
How longs the ban
---
I'm a simple man...
---
I wasn't even looking at the gun or anything else in particular. But I saw stuff on the right give you a + score and the screen vibrated a bit. I instantly knew. "Kapkan"
---
Try 75 more times
---
I get called out for hacking quite regularly because of it, and the hilarious thing is, I'm not even that good at siege, I'm average at best.
---
I also wanted to get Mozzie lol

Go4 is probably what you're looking for. Some streamers host tourneys as well

that‚Äôs straight up incorrect. every match is played on a server in a datacenter

---
Because you used inappropriate language. You can't get tilted and overreact, it just gets you in more trouble. That ban is entirely your fault, js. The toxicity is one thing but you cant pin the ban on them
---
You never know someone‚Äôs potential
---
it is a crime though. people are being taken to court. look it up
---
When you eat the bait you deserve the consequences. You're basically doing what they want you to do.
---
Mozzie is sick I‚Äôll be honest. He‚Äôs a lot of fun and drones are like the best tool in the game. Have fun
---
would have been better if he didn't just kill his teammate though
---
Long range snipers have litterally told stories of putting their rounds in the hot sand to get the extreme umpf. 
---
Just like you said the performance gain (or loss in your argument) is so meniscal that no the hot brass is not gonna cause jams.
---
*Happy F12 raptor noises*

Because people working in Cyber Security will be fixing gameplay bugs, get the fuck out.

I‚Äôve heard Go4 is full of MnK, any word if that‚Äôs still the case ?
---
I can smell r34 around the corner
---
Ubi is better take my money and like it
---
so i get tilted and say fuck off, but they harassed me and called me poor and they dont get banned?
---
whos really in the rlwrong here

It just says "involved". Doesn't mean he was a combatant. Could have been a bystander

Oh yeah

That is what i meant, but people are paid to fill in back stories. If they somewhat arbitrarily picked GIGN events, that's fine, but if I'm going to insert a birth year for a back story, one of the easiest things to do is make sure the dates are reasonable. 11 years old is hilariously bad. You don't even have to do math to realize something is off
