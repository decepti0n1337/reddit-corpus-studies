I've got both, but that one just says "penis" to me. So I use the unicorn helmet instead.

I think the fact that tachankas turret could shoot shields would be cool and all but it takes a decent amount of time to set up the turret and by then the shield or one of his teammates could get the jump on you.

Okey fine take the upvote. :(

More of a reminiscence than a demand 😂

in the end it's a team game.

I had a very lucky shot too, where I shoot the camera and expediently headshots a spawn peeker

As a maestro main, my two showdown packs got me his yeehaw armor but not his yeehaw hat and I didnt want to support their shitty business tactics. So I will forever have my yeehaw armor without the yeehaw hat to go with it.

Shotguns have spread. If you're past a certain distance, you're pellets are too spread out to be useful at that engagement. An actual laser like the MPX can put a tight grouping of bullets at 25 meters.
---
&gt;  low time 
---
Manage time better. If you're pushing site with 15-30 seconds left, Ela mines are the least of your problems or one of the most unlikely things to actually cost you the round or the entire match if you're team isn't managing time.
---
&gt; it’s either thrown on you 
---
You must be getting C4'd a fuck tone if your reaction time is so slow to shooting an Ela mine that has to arm itself after landing on a surface is such an issue for you.
---
&gt; when you have to go through a door in situations like getting pinched 
---
All your examples are "I made a bad gameplay decision but I swear its not my fault".

Aim higher
---
Not the best gun in the game but I do think it's underated. Problem is that many people feel uncomfortable using DMRs. Especially on console, stuff DMRs on console
---
Fair. I still wish for 99 damage Luison but that’s dead and gone too.
---

---

---
My main concern with a fast setup time is that it would give the gun too much utility especially with the proposed penetration buffs. In this instance you’d still have to think strategically and place your turret in a spot with decent lines of sight.
---
Aim at a 45 degree angle and be moving forward.
---
Sadly Ela’s shotgun is overpowered
---
True Rip 😭
---
Use the turret less, his guns are absolutely deadly. Only use the turret in the last minute of the round or if you need it. If not don't just sit there on it

Defiantly, and I’m not saying that it isn’t a good elite skin but I feel other operators should’ve received an elite skin before him

shes pretty in line with the other 3 armor attackers. Fuze is W I D E as shit and monty is monty.
---
I love the 9x19 VSN, absolutely a lethal weapon. But his ability needs a buff.
---
Yea ok what u mean
---
Lucky for sure
---
Yoo whot maaytt?
---
LOL, this is the game where you get TK’d for putting up reinforcements in the wrong spot yet everyone here in the comments is screeching...
---
&gt; unless that change will only apply to console. 
---
If it were to only apply to console, which is the case with recoil then I'd be fine which is why I proposed that or like when Kaid shotgun had too much recoil for console players to use effectively. However, I'm not sure how often Ubisoft looks at these case by case basis or if they do something like buffing Buck across all platforms because his recoil is too much for the majority of console players while PC players are fine with him.
---
Im more interested in clashes face than this meme

Damn. You’re lucky.

Does aiming with a shotgun effect anything other than recoil?

---
I believe that the devs of rainbow should make elite skins for operators based off of seniority instead of just whoever is a popular operator at the time, and lesions elite skin is nice but agreeing with what you said it was unnecessary
---
For example operators like buck and I hate to say it but blitz, at least I feel, deserve an elite skin over an operator like lesion because they are an older op

There is a big difference with mouse speed it doesn’t matter on the manufacturer than that. 1600 will always be unsuitable for competitive play in my opinion there is no way to accurately aim

He's about to Cluster Charge the room with the hostage in it, which would have killed the hostage making us lose. Although I didn't realize till afterwards that he had reverse friendly fire enabled so he would have just killed himself, which you see happen when he opens the barricade and shoots the hostage.

Gems transfer because it's a PSN store product so you basically gameshare it with other accounts, with elite skins you're buying them with R6 credits

At some point no matter how low your sensitivity is you can’t achieve the same mouse speed you could at any 400 dpi sense. Nobody that has ever been good at competitive video games has had over 1,000 dpi. They’re are certain instances of pros who have high dpi(which at that level is 800 dpi with a high sens) but they are rare

IQ knew she was screwed when Cav was revealed to the attackers. It was inevitable

I just feel like her ability isn’t all that much helpful compared to just simply holding the angle or something. Her hands are also huge so it throws me off just a little bit. Only good thing though is her guns, she definitely has a really good loadout imo

I disagree, Monty isn't as fun anymore

I feel like the rest of the GSG9 would actually use this.
---
You can always achieve the same mouse speed. Even if you have to go decimal. 
---
And I just explained to you why most pro's use 400-800 dpi's. They are used to it and most still use old mouses, shroud's mouse isn't even in the market anymore for example, those mouses had native 400-800dpi, they never changed to newer models which have native dpi's past that number. Doesn't mean it's better. Most known pro's in quake use insane amounts of accelaration, does that mean you should use accelaration as well?  If you used 800 your whole life and it's working, why would you change now?
---
I remember watching one of the c9 players in siege that used enchance pointer precision in windows, which most of us agree it's bad. He tried to put it off, just to enabled it back after less than an hour because he felt "innacurate". He's just used to it, he won't change despite what's more accurate.
---
There's another reason, newer mouse models don't use interpolation anymore for dpi's other than the native one. My mouse is one of those examples, this means that technically it supports native dpi's in 50 increments. Meaning that 400, 800 will also be 1:1 despite not being native.

Lesion. He has one of the best SMG’s on defense, and has impacts. His ability annoys attackers, makes them vulnerable for a few seconds when they have to remove the nearly invisible needle. His gadget also provides intel, with markers showing you where your gu mines are so you know when one goes off and where it was.
---
I think he's fine where he is. If anything his bosg could get an acog and his K1A could get a small RoF nerf to make his guns more evenly viable
---
So you're saying because I play better against better people I should do worse and because that was not the case in hacking so there isn't a possibility that I played a lot of air booster and T-Hunt before I started playing ranked and having a 54% HS Accuracy isn't really good there are people that have 60-70+ and arent cheating. if you have ever watched me play I'm not super good but I'm good enough to expect what people will do since all people in high ranks almost all do the same thing.

Seriously, how fucking dense are you? Just because you use an exploit doesn't make you any better than someone who uses a glitch. You're still a piece of shit plain and simple.

Playing almost no one but Nokk in Attack made me realize her flaws. Almost every achievement I've managed could have been done by other flaking ops. I stopped picking her at all when playing with my team who were rather patient with me in giving up on Nokk as they all saw her to be quite useless within the 1st week. 
---
At this point, I only play her for fun as I love her design and overall concept. Unfortunately, there's no denying that she's very underwhelming and that unless she gets much stronger than her current state, she won't replace anyone in the team comp and will be a waste of space until more buffs happen.

Logitech Gaming mice supposedly have native DPI across the whole range.
---
let the man have fun? why have i seen this on r/dankmemes, instagram, and even ifunny weeks before now?
---
There should be a setting that limits fps on the main display screen.
---
It’s not because they’re used to it it’s because you can’t be as precise with higher dpi and that’s the fact. I’m not arguing in the technological basis that it’s worse but your wrist and arm can’t match the rate of the dpi. There’s multiple videos of pros explaining this. If you’re arguing that higher dpi is better you obviously are not playing high level in ranked.
---
My argument was that the Scorpion isn't at a disadvantage against most guns. I gave facts as to why that's true. You don't like being wrong so you make dumb arguments that have little to no effect on the accuracy or fire power of the weapon

---
Depends, if using an old sensor where non-native dpi causes hardware accelaration I'd recommend changing for sure. Unless that person has been playing for years cause as you said muscle memory comes into play at that point. 
---
Changing the dpi doesn't mean you have to change your 360/cm sensitivity tho.
---
I made an example somewhere about quake and ut pro's using a lot of accelaration, nowadays everyone agrees that accelaration isn't consistent, but for them, it's not worth to change ofc.
---
No it isn't. At long ranges it's useless.
---
Kardashians got nothing on Monty.

A fucking attacking healer. Basically an anti-spawn-peeker. Give him like... Incredibly shit weapons similar to to the FMG and like... The 45 Meusoc. Make him a 2-speed, too. 
---
The guy can give 100 health total to his fellow attackers. Either 20 to each person, 40 to one and 20 shared to 3 others, 60 to one and 40 shared to 2 others, 80 to one and 20 shared to one more, or all 100 health to bring a single person back from death one time. Once all 100 health is distributed, he can give no more. The health does not fade unless it overheals. 
---
That's all I ask. Just a way to counter spawnpeekers because it's getting out of hand.
---
But to balance out his incredibly good gadget, give him shit guns (and no faster than a 2 speed).
---
No it's not holy shit. Past 10 meters the fo-12 losses much of its range and you have to compensate for the recoil past there as well. It is very easily countered and is only amazing at CQC which is in its description as well. It's not over powered. And having it be good at CQC does not negate that the rest of Ela's kit is completely pathetic.
---
You really don't get what me and the other guy were saying do you? It doesn't matter if it's a selling point. If the engine the game you're playing has issues with it, or even windows itself, what's the point?

---
I would do this if I wasn’t so lonely and shy
---
How did you do it?
---
The G36 is a perfectly good gun, it just doesnt shred at close quarters like the R4.
---
Why are you using a shotgun long range anyways? You have to use her at a bottleneck where you know the enemies are entering. Going into a bomb site against her shotgun is basically suicide.
---
I started off with talking about the DPS, if you go back and look at the previous comment I listed every gun that has a lower DPS. So you talking about "you lost the argument that the Scorpion has the lowest damage so you changed it to DPS" is completely false. Also it doesn't have a set recoil pattern (no gun does) but it does have a general tendency to go one direction due to how the recoil diamond works. And even if it does one of the lowest damage per shot (now I'm not talking about dps just btw) it is still a one shot headshot. And going off that it is a head shot machine. Like roughly 95% of my kills with it are headshots so it's not like it's a hard thing to hit the head unless you have bad aim. I'm not saying my aim is like Beaulo level but it's certainly above average. And I'm almost certain I classify as "an actual Ela main" considering that I have a crap ton of hours on her (I'd have to look at my stats to see exactly how many) and on top of that I've mained her since the day she released to the TTS.

Quake is arguably the most difficult and oldest competitive shooter of all time, i'd say those guys have a say in competitive gaming. You think pro's are actively researching about mouses and talking to manufacturers about specs? You're clearly delusional, they are not engineers, they play videogames. Most don't even know what cpi means technically.

But if you still don't believe me, go into any pro's twitch. And ask them their bios settings. I bet 1000 bucks that they don't know it, and probably never even entered their bios. And fun fact, if they are not using raw uefi it can affect their polling rate in certain mobos, so it definitely affects their mouse among every other piece of hardware and peripherals.
---
Make the MOUNTED lmg have no recoil
---
Completely irrelevant to the matter at hand.
---
What’s the gamer tag
---
Big oof
---
It in the photo
---
Did he have them at release? I’m new to this game (relatively), only started playing last October
---
K
---
Well I just loaded it up and I’m starting fresh like no ops and I was excited to go on my adventure
---
I just want to know who im talking to whats ur gamertag?
---
I mean, I’m silver and never been higher and I get queued against more plats than anything
---
Oh I gotcha now. Good luck!
---
Because of their coding. There was a windows patch 2 years ago that made all wacom tablets stop working with pen pressure for example. I keep asking the same question, how can they mess up so bad, but people mess up, there's stuff you can't predict.
---
Thats what I thought but idk isnt it like easier on rainbow to play with a lower one ? Or do you think i just need to play more on 90 to get into it cause i pöayed like over 100 hours now with 60
---
Quake is washed up and not as complicated as modern shooters that’s why it has no player base. Yes pro players are involved in researching and developing better gaming peripherals. The g pro wireless I was talking about was the built with the help of hundreds of pros from rainbow six over watch and csgo who collectively determined the best sensor and mouse shape for gaming. And yes pros do use their bios I’ve literally seen videos of Jason’s and pengu working on their bios
---
Cause ranks are not part of the matchmaking in casual. 
---
Casual has its own casual mmr which it calculates using casual win/loss. 
---
Players that are normally high plat/dia tend to fuck around a lot in casual or just dont play a lot of casual matches therefore will have lower casual mmr. 
---
Due to this in casual matchmaking high rank players will sometimes be matched with lower rank players.
---
U better be a diamond mr pop quiz
---
Why do you need to know? You have in front of you everything you need to know my stance and supporting arguements. Anything else that you request is irrelevant to the discussion, and information I'm not willing to disclose to someone like you.
---
Well hope I was useful for that information
---
it's twitchy as hell and you won't hit diamond without it quite frankly. So if you keep playing at your skill level, you won't notice it. Diamond is a different game.
---
I understand what a dragged is my man. She's good at killing, yes, but her job is soft wall breaching.
---
Not say it is broken, but you can agree with me that the shots it her directly in the head, with the bullets going directly through her as you can hear it in the replay on the building.
---
I'm just getting back into the game and I've just been shooting them. Is there a reason to not shoot them on sight? Is not being location pinged so important that you would rather risk hesitating on shots?
---
I made it to level 150
---
Noice
---
Really when I use ash I use the G36 and it works very well at close quarters but definitely is better at a distance
---
I played as him on a smurf where I only had jager and had my friend pick him. I got three kills with him
---
oh I was thinking of a lot of things. You’re rank, you’re name, you’re profile pic.
---
1: you shot him in the head 3x, there’s blood behind him to prove it
---
2: he puts a claymore next to a frost trap
---
3: he steps on it
---
G what in the copper 2 playing on pc with control typa shit is that 😂😂😂
---
It took me way too long to figure out that you were missing Dokkaebi.
---
^Oh
---
Wait Ash doesn’t have acog anymore? I haven’t played over a month
---
I’d up vote but it’d break the 69
---
My guess is that during the open beta you didn't have to pay for attachments(?)
---
The reason why the current siege menu is laggy is because it's built to check Ubisoft servers for what attachments you have bought. But they're all free now so it doesn't matter. That check is what slows everything down because it keeps requesting data from the servers each time.
---
It's not relavant anymore more but it's just that they haven't changed it. 
---
As for why they don't change it now to a collective menu and without the additional check? Well, if it ain't broke dont fix it.
---
OK, I feel the need to ask: why are you putting off getting Dokki for so long?
---
Ash:ZOOOOOOOOM
---
I'm not an Ash main, but she should get it back. Jusg because Ubi are too incompetent to properly balance her, doesn't mean she should have less access to attachments.
---
Thermite makes bigger holes... &gt;.&lt;
---
Sadly I never got to play an operations before the western one because I got the game last month.
---
Oh my...
---
Does thermite wear a hood? I didn’t think so ...
---
RIP. My favorite is still Operation Chimera with the outbreak gamemode.
---
Me too 😭 Pretty in Pink uniform and I have the Racing Helmet to kinda go with it. Wish I would’ve gotten his entire fit

She gets bandit tricked every time and can even get kaid tricked
---
True true
---
Tf is Rook doin’ outside?
---
team rainbow is like the baby division of whatever the fuck army its part of they only get sent out to clear training dummies
---
You should of put “I bet you feel dumb now”
---
PS4 doesn't support universal plug and play? Couldn't you just block that with a firewall?
---
Hmm
---
Doc is better because we spawnpeek too gether while overdosed
---
AND he says funny swear word when he boom boom
---
Wait you guys play siege?
---
But my mom says I can’t say or be around no no words
---
Aren't like everyone but jackal afraid of jackal being their opponent?
---
Man, great clip, but seeing this just makes me go crazy. It should literally be impossible to flick that fast
---
If only it was that easy. I'm too stupid to do that
---
The true sin is the reflex on the deagle
---
Are you retarded or just being deliberately obtuse? People play ash for the kills, not for the soft breaching.
---
I would just play zofia.
---
Got sick of acog's zoom so slapped a reflex on my guns instead, been playing way better recently.
---
Chalet.
---
Deadass pathetic.
---
Hey! I'm in this video!
---
Wow. I mean.... wow.
---
I’m not supposed to give my opinion
---
All I can this of is **Boop**
---
Thanks... I just read. Thanks for sharing:)
---
“Blitz:chunk chunk chunk WRRRRRRRRRRR“ thats not Blitz sound.
---
No good ash player actually noticed the change, since they weren't using the ACOG on her in the first place.
---
The ACOG allowed her to quick peek long angles and get free picks, which was pushing her away from her intended role of entry fragging.
---
Recruits are useless basically
---
Nah not really. Whenever I turn off V Sync and uncap my frame rate, the CPU workload just jumps to about 100 percent
---
Eh mixed opinions on that. It’s what I did as a noob and eventually I did get pretty good. Only problem is I didn’t realize how much it would prevent my overall KD from increasing later on.
---
Montagne definitely
---
I don't want to cause any trouble but isn't that Rook ?
---
Aaaay, someone here has culture!
---
Wait, you guys?
---
Shhh
---
G36C is still a good gun compared to all defender weapons, except for Maestro's LMG and 416-C for Jager.
---
If you have to tell Ubisoft this, they are already to stupid to make a big deal and change this.
---
Uhh weird concedence, but I've been drawing the exact same thing as you!
---
idk if im gettin wooooshed but thats how it was supposed to be
---
Theres nothing wrong with running the cpu at high load. These things are made to run like that. 
---
As long as your cooling is fine (under 75c) running it at 100% is not going to damage the CPU or GPU.
---
Wait, you guys exist?
---
How would you prevent smurfing?
---
If ppl are treating you this badly, maybe your skills are weak. Try playing the situations or thunt offline.
---
Thanks, have a great day too!
---
They have already said smurfing is allowed. Sorry man.
---
You're comparing a laptop to a desktop system. 
---
As long as op has a decent cooler there is not reason not to overclock his system.
---
Not preventing smurfing, but Pro Players who livestream it should be punished because they are actively ruining the game and publically making profit off it
---

This is the spot where the first bullet hits and goes through to the other side and into the wall.

Why, it’s not like they play on gold or anything, they still play on diamond, and they don’t try at all
---
Rarely tho I feel
---
Nobody said anything about keyboard and mouse... universal plug and play (UPnP) is network related.
---
Okay cool, I don’t think it should be a problem then. Whenever I have my GPU running 99-100 percent, it never goes above 66 degrees C. So I do know that the 7700k does run pretty hot, and I have AIO Liquid Cooler so hopefully that will be enough to keep it under  75c. Thank you
---
She is fat not thicc
---
Probably my favorite sau_siege comic
---
Its running upto 4.5 since its not having any cooling issues and thats it's standard boost clocks. 
---
Mate there are people/offices that run these processes at 100% load for years non stop. Running the system at 100% doesnt in anyway damage the system.
---
Did Mr. Foster get a new skin?
---
I don’t really know, I think it’s just more of a bandwagon thing, and I personally really like it and really think the hate is unwarranted
---
It's good because every other shotgun has its trade offs. The fo 12 is the Jack of all trades shotgun. You may argue that it's a shotgun and it's only situational, but if you play close quarters and wait around counters and flank its devastating. I made a montage of my fo 12 clips if you want to watch it for proof. Everyone in those clips are high plat/diamond btw.
---
I get that, but he doesn't need to for siege. Especially considering that he has stressing issues, this might help.

I agree, I really like the red dot, thanks for clarifying😀
---
Unless you're playing in the middle of the summer or in a room with 0 windows, chances are your system will be under the temp limits with a AIO. 
---
it makes no sense to have a system that good and have the game capped to 60 fps unless your are having some other issues with the game.
---
You should watch where you are going
---
No problemo my man :D
---
&gt;he has stressing issues
---
What "stressing" issue are we talking about? Cause according to OP he is just worried about stressing the CPU, there is no issue.
---
This doesn’t help the smurf problem at all.
---
I don’t see how removing a handful of pro players smurfs does anything to the amount of regular smurf we have now.
---
All that does is force them on their main. 
---
Also, forgive me if I haven’t known about this, but, are you mistaking an alt account for a smurf? Or did George/Pengu actually make a new account for the sole purpose of staying in gold or below?
---
Cuz I know George has an alt to play on when he loses on his main a lot, or because a lot of people snipe him.
---
You know what nøkk means. Doye you dhd
---
I only see 4 elites
---
I overexaggerated it. my bad.
---
I switch these two guns between rounds because i can't find the one that i like, but they both have insane recoil (compared to some other weapons). Maybe i need to practice burst fire
---
My guy you didn't have to write an essay. I know. I was memeing to annoy that one guy.
---
Fuze uses an AK12.
---
As long as main traits are retained, i am happy.
---
I just aim chest and hope for the best. Would work way better (for me) than using the pistol.
---
Wait why would you possibly want 60 FPS with a 144hz monitor? Your specs aren’t bad at all you could easily push that. Also I found that turning your graphic settings up higher seems to take some load off of the cpu
---
Meh, same thing.  Too tired for accuracy.  If I ran the death star, alderan would still be a thing.
---
I know.
---
I looked up "arsole" and the second picture was an asshole lmao
---
Yeah.
---
Does not compute.   I switched to the pistol and never looked back.  I think I have more kills with smokes pistol than I did with the SMG.
---
Since they had to play at least one more round after this one, they might have won the game on def, so maybe it doesn't look as cool.
---
The tittle said crossing out for me
---
"Well I've done all I can do."
---
Nah, don't be sad
---
There is not one, but why buff her by giving her more smokes?
---
I couldn’t accept it at first until I got my first ace with his shotgun. Then it was set in stone.
---
Then be clear about your Damn sarcasm next time which is why /s exists .
---
Remember when they first added cosmetics and said "dont worry, we'll keep it realistic"
---
Mute is a counter to: jacal.lion.dokabi
---
I like using reflex on the gun tbh. I don't have to pull my gun down as much
---
Well we give her claymores then
---
/s is so cheesy though &gt;-&lt;
---
Lmaoo
---
Technically no, but you had to purchase an Elite pass to the event and get a code.
---
This is why RNG hipfire has no place in this game.
---
It's still pretty good
---
You didn’t say please.
---
I feel like the g36 is way better on consoles since nobody really has good aim and it’s more manageable but still on actual siege it’s a solid gun unless you plan on just rushing
---
Seems unbiased to me
---
Ubisoft is famous for doing this to have fun
---
On xbox you can use it. as far as I know i had blank in my gamertag back in xbox 360 years as well

---
If he could only track prints from action phase that would be chill. I’d still ban him but I like playing Vigil and getting to your spot to start checking cams for the flank only to get tracked by Jackal and have that plan blown up is weak.
---
Is it easy to use? If so I’ll check it out as soon as I can
---
Nasty
---
To be perfectly honest probably a bit of laziness, its definately possible, but requires some code in core project of uplay. Its much easier to just decide that your client wont use blank space than code it in it
---
Ubisoft: \*adds 6 new operators\*
---
In my opinion valk
---
I think just a red dot and a fore grip..I'm not sure, I would have to look. I hardly use that gun anymore.
---
Yeah both are airsoft guns
---
Thx I love using it ever now and then

I am throwing my bullets too

Isnt the lords turret an old ww2 gun?

OPFOR eliminated?

Makes sense, math adds up
---
I did yes. And I know.

But before I play with MnK on console I'd rather buy a PC. The point of a console is playing with controller. And just because some small balls idiots don't follow the rules you want to change how we have to play on console? Thats insane

The Siege community is the most toxic I've ever experienced. Do what I did and get a few friends interested so you can team up with them.

I can’t imagine something worse than adding MnK, are you trying to make the problem worse 😂
---
Well if they're gonna do that again next season then it will start being an issue, However hopefully an attacker with a grapple hook is good and is fine with re-used guns(it leaked)
---
"without some serious protection" xDDD
---
Oh yea, forgot about that one

R3 + L1 or kind of stuff

L1 + Circle etc

They'll do it again likely next season

People don’t agree because the majority of players in this game play and think around the high silver to low gold level (where the majority falls). Jackal isn’t an issue at them levels of play. 
---
Go to the higher levels and it’s a whole new picture. People don’t like hearing the truth, that’s the issue. 
---
People complained and never upvoted about Ash nerf posts as they didn’t think it would happen or didn’t believe in it. Guess what, it happened and was one of the best changes overall. Same with Jäger and Bandit ACOG. Same as Lion. Same as Dokkaebi. The community overall has zero idea of what the game needs. So much proof of where people on here that defend operators that are just too good, but no one wants to believe it
---
to balance out the other operator who can see through smoke.
---
Hench.
---
Don’t bother justifying yourself. People have a hard on to say that you are losing because you are bad, or didn’t help your team properly, etc etc. God forbid you have a large collection of games where your teammates are just fucking trash and go 0–7. It’s pointless to argue with the guys on this sub that don’t understand how that works. 
---
Usually they are the guys playing 5 stacks and going 1-6 but still winning every game because they have a squad. So they will always say that they are better than you.
---
I have the exact same specs but with the R5 2600x CPU and the Gtx 1050 ti GPU. I can play and record siege on 60 fps high settings 1920x1080 Res.
---
If you just wanna play the parts you mentioned are more than enough but if you're looking into recording/streaming I would recommend you to take a look at the Gtx 1050 ti, it's relatively cheap and performs really good. I also think the Ryzen 5 2600x is like 30 dollars more than the 1600 but it comes with the wraith spire cooler which I'm pretty sure is alot better than the stock coolers AMD gives you, not only that but the its faster than the 1600. Either way both CPU's are really good for gaming and multitasking as well. 
---
Maybe watch some videos on YouTube with your build and if you're satisfied with the performance I believe it's an okay purchase.
---
Im boutta head out
---
Have you seen the forearms on doc? They're as chunky as rooks torso.
---
Yes, another one.
---
Literally used the SMG-12 to headshot a BB. *Area 51 meme*
---
Well, ideas like lesions or ying or nokk or fuze do stretch this too, I see how you’re trying to look at it from a realistic POV, and although it’s nice to think of it realistically, it is a video game, where bodyshots don’t injure limbs or do more damage than really speaking.
---
So stretching it this far isn’t much of a big deal, considering mozzie and gridlock’s abilities are similarly unrealistic...
---
But I’ll take ur comment into consideration and try to work around it.
---
But the original idea wasn’t throwing the reinforcement, more like throwing a ball which expands and reinforces the hatch or wall
---
Yea no, that was her most recent nerf from skull rain midseason reinforcements iirc
---
Lost 2/3 games yesterday due to ddos.
---
It actually has been STATISTICALLY PROVEN that rook is actually not chunky and instead is in good shape
---
You opinions aren’t valid as a ash main
---
I’ve played both pc and console since launch and have experienced all the usual spawnpeeks or whatnot but again I rarely had ever came across a cheater. Now I may have not been as high as a rank to come across cheaters back then. And I don’t know where I was going with I guess I was trying to say that I don’t really see how a game mode could possibly affect cheaters or attract them.
---
No it’s
---
 Vigil
---
Lol
---
So we back in the mine
---
Thanks for your advice, It was very useful, I'll start using it more!
---
Currently G1 but used to be low/mid Plat. All my friends are either Plat 2 or 1 now because I've been very busy and played much less lately. 
---
I LOVE Nokk's design. I love the whole idea of sneaky Attacker and couldn't think of why her type of attack didn't exist before. 
---
However, all my teammates have been very heavily against the idea of me starting to main Nokk. I was little surprised since I usually play as the second Flanker as Mav and my teams were usually confident in my capability to play by myself little further away from them to do a surprise attack when maps allowed it. 
---
My team decided to give me about 3 to 4 weeks to play instead of Mav or Ash (our other roamer/flanker played IQ all the time) so I can come to my own conclusion. 
---
Things I found: 
---
1. Gu mines, Yokai drones, Mozzie drones, barbed wires (curse you), barricaded back entries, Ela mines, Kapkan traps, and even well hidden Valk cams can ruin her approach completely. 
---
2. Popular picks. Thankfully, Echo gets banned all the time. However, Lesion is not and I'd say he's a bigger problem for Nokk. 
---
3.  Anchors pay much more attention and often respond right away if I am forced to make tiny noise. Every time I make a noise (gu mines, barbed wires etc) or exposed to a hidden cam since I can't always hide from Valk cams or Mozzie drones, I'd check the obj with drone and 90% of the time I'd see an Anchor holding angle against me immediately. 
---
4. Nokk is the only non-shield Attacker who is outgunned by majority of the Defenders. Attackers usually have high damage and range to compete against Defenders. Nokk has neither. 
---
5. Most of all: every time I look back at my achievements and successful kills, I realized I could have done much better with my usual Mav or Ash. 
---
In the end, I still have fun with Nokk but only when I am playing by myself and against Golds. I stopped picking her when playing with my team since mid to high Plats all seem to react to her way too well. I am obviously not the best Nokk player and definitely not playing her at full potential. 
---
However, Ubi's own data shows her to be second worst Attacker in the game. It is not just me. People in high ranks all do terrible with Nokk. Pro player like Kanto called her a troll pick. Another pro said she won't replace anyone in the team comps in general. 
---
I think I can say that she is very underwhelming in the end and need some huge buffs to even justify in being picked over other Attackers in general.
---
That guy joined during the round
---
Ahh so it was a 4K
---
He’s not welding though....
---
Yeah
---
I don’t know if they will bring middle eastern servers. MS opened servers for Africa already but Ubisoft still hasn’t implemented them even though they have been promising for a year or two to do so.
---
Not an ace
---
Yeah I deactivated my old account, this is my new one
---
I think 5.7 works pretty well for mid to long distance engagement due to low recoil and large ammo per mag. 
---
I feel like if I have two close combat oriented guns, I'm restricting myself too much. Some people say that Nokk is close combat oriented but that does not mean she can avoid mid to long distance fight all the time especially if map forces her to be in those fights.
---

What you do is go in to that text file and just change the name of every server in it to whatever server you want to be put on. I did it and the game stopped putting me in Asia and has not since

It’s hard to get down the maps and to me especially this years like the map Mozzie and Gridlock came out with (can’t remember the name at the moment) it’s not a bad map but it’s big and takes a while to get down

only ones i use are an angled grip and a muzzle attachment since they're hard to spot and ive already shot you in the face before you're close enough to look at them.

Where did you manage to find an airsoft HK33? Great cosplay, would love to see more!
---
Is that Duncan Jones?
---
So you’re expecting a full squad that works like a well-oiled machine to be on equal level with a team where only 3 out of 5 people understand each other?
---
I don’t get why people always complain about not having people to play with. Just play with your friends or if you don’t have any just post saying you’re looking for people to play on 1 of like 20 places you can do that

You know I was just thinking about this today when I was hovering over the Club challenges.

Classic Army had one out for more than a decade and recently it was made into a second run. Begadi.com should have it for Europe, Airsoft GI should have it for the US.

It’d be hard to judge it so it’s not too ‘overpowered’ a reward. But I think adding to the pack roll % would be really helpful!

HEAT SEEKING BULLET
---
Ranked should be 50 minimum but realistically probably 75 would be better in terms of the knowledge you sorta need and how long it takes to get it. But 50 is fine. 
---
Really like this idea though. Ranked certainly shouldn’t be 30
---
Except when you drone someone out, the person relies heavily on sound to tell where the attacker is coming from, or at least in my experience. Anti-intel is a great gadget. She isn't played like any other attacker in the game. My team is in charge of hard breaching a garage or an obj from outside, while my goal is to sneak in from the opposite side of the map and clear out any roamers, then crip walk into OBJ like nobodies business and take out the anchors, because nobody was able to call me out unless they physically saw me, which would be rare since their attention is focused on the rest of my team.

---
Haha thank you kids room and that office in villa that has the door to balcony are the two sites you never fully reinforce it’s too much of a hassle to retake them if you lose them. 
---
Kids room you literally have one door and a window that leaves you exposed to fire/notification if not fast enough. You should blow open all of those walls besides maybe a Mira on closet and play in workshop, stairs, bathroom and bedroom. If defenders get it it’s pretty much a guaranteed loss. 
---
Same with office on villa. You should open map to bar reinforce the right wall of map and left of bar put Mira’s and then leave the walls next to the reinforced ones soft to be able to be blown open to retake since window can cover stairs door and balcony can cover maps door.
---
I know the point of secure is to reinforce and bunker down but some sites you need to play more of a bomb style approach to the map. I’m not saying the bronze and coppers are wrong if they don’t know this higher level map knowledge and op should have communicated with them better and other team should be more responsive
---
I like this idea! It'd be nice to get a boost on the alpha pack roll.

I know about this spot I use it to I dont know why I didnt check for spawn peaks but I didnt I was just mad about how my head perfectly lined up with where his gun was and how he couldn't see anywhere else outside

Which is fucking dumb, they changed the precedent for the sake of cutting corners. I thought they just wanted to be minimalistic or some shit not that they're going to start ripping content out. I was cool with Lion And Finka having reused weapons, because we got outbreak with them and a fuck tonne of stuff that season. I'd have rather forgone the Cowboy mode and had new weapons to play with.
---
Thought this was a in-game screen shot nice.
---
well I thought it was funny, but so /s so apparently I likely came across as an ass. Says loads about the state of the playerbase actually that since it seems like I was serious, the downvotes poor in. Interesting.

Lmao I was gonna bang but it autocorrected to hang so I just left it and wanted to see your reaction
---
I know
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but I honestly wouldn't care if they didn't add any new weapons. There's already a huge amount of them. The only games I can think of with more is Battlefield. I'd rather see more thought put into the operators themselves than added weapons that are essentially slightly tweaked versions of the ones already in the game.
---
Took me a moment but now I’m glad I didn’t keep scrolling
---
Meh. I would prefer getting an alpha pack each time I reach a new level since I'm in the 100s now. An alpha pack at select levels would also work. Just like League of Legends giving champion capsules and other capsules at select levels. I mean, what's the point of a leveling system in Siege when they don't use it to match people it seems.
---
were you bandit? was a vigil/echo yelling at you?
---
anyway there is a delay on the claymore explosion so if you run past it, it will explode and you won't take damage.

Not if your smart enough

The FMG-9 was literally made for the US Secret Service, crazily enough

r/subsithoughtifellfor

Nop. As i say only with my team Gold Elo
---
That fps made my nipples hard
---
i think the challenges would need to be tweaked, then. as it stands, you can get a challenge to, say, win 4 rounds as mira or jackal in multiplayer even if you dont have either, making the challenge impossible. the challenge system would need to be changed so td hat it only gives you challenges that you can complete because it would give new players a disadvantage otherwise.

This should sooooo be how it works, honestly. Anything that gets activated remotely should still work when downed. It would make for some super interesting moments!

Im on ps4 too. Just have to get good with using a controller to control recoil and find the right trigger rhythm.

Most times it .earns a room which connects 2 sites/rooms together
---
Thnx! I wasnt really looking back on the drawing as i was going so thats my bad xD

---
no, i don’t think you understand. it’s prep his drone gets sent out “you have 10 seconds (i think that’s how long) for you to get that drone inside before it explodes” it doesn’t matter how smart you are that drone is not making it inside
---
A room that usually is between or ‘connects’ the bomb sites. Think the room between the top floor bomb sites on Consulate. It is between both bombs therefore connects them
---
Rooms that connect
---
But i said your opinion isn’t valid as a ash main so none of this matters.

I wish they’d just rework it. I’d rather play at that dumpster fire than have to play on favela.

---

---
Rip
---
Imho they'd need to be on the general side of things because, as we've already seen, when you make weapon-specific or CTU-specific challenges, you're defeating the purpose of the tactical nature of Siege. I don't think people are thrilled to see someone pick Tachanka just because they're trying to finish Spetsnaz Active Duty and Kapkan was already taken. Nor do they particularly enjoy seeing someone pick Doc when the team already has Rook and 3 other anchors because GIGN Active Duty happens to be one of the weeklies. And don't get me started on the guy trying to clutch a 1v3 and failing because he refused to use anything other than his fucking pistol.
---
Also Competitive Gadget Master can fuck off. Caveira's Luison is pretty good for farming that one (free tip for those who were otherwise unaware) but it's way too situational for my liking.
---
I would be fine with buffing her primary if it meant nerfing her shotgun’s range/rate of fire
---
Took me a few minutes to get it
---
It looks really good, the acog is perfect except the things on the top that make the retical red but the amount of details non every thing else is amazing.
---
I'm confused on what you mean by the timing. What exactly was going on?
---
As a Thatcher Main, I approve. 
---
Next up: a long rope and maybe a helicopter :)
---
Signed: guy who just reached gold 2
---
Heh heh, time to report
---
You cant really judge that the vert makes it wider because the gun is rng based. You probably just got lucky groupings with the angled since vertical doesnt do anything to horizontal recoil.
---
a shot like that from the hip is only called skills in my book
---
God no don’t let people make you think that. Everyone learns the game at their own pace and you can’t start at plat 3. dDosing smurfs and shit make it hard for rank to be reliable. Just play man people try to flex I use to be one if those douches but now I just play and don’t worry about it. Especially this season
---
You know, there’s probably a reason you only have 434 comment karma.
---
We have a bunch of guns that are like the ak-47 but we don’t actually have one
---
IMO rank doesn’t matter. People have good days and bad days. Look at pro league teams some have gold ranks yet the others have plat/ diamond and they’ve beaten them. They should have the option to turn off k/d or switch it to casual instead of rank on player cards.
---
So you want some advice on how to get better at the game? If so if say keeping simple pick simple operators and learn them dont be too aggressive and take it easy dont be disheartened when you die this game has a big learning curve
---
Your skill is more important than your rank. My friend was bullied in one match by his “friends” just because he was like silver 3 and they were in gold. They didn’t cared about that he was carrying match.
---
Won 1 round so I’m happy
---
It still does 47 damage, which is not bad for an AR.

There should a sub for cursed rainbow six images and vids

It really gets me upset when somebody sees a specific hole blown up that leads to the other objective and just closes it up like someone made a mistake

Fnatic are currently in top 5 best teams, according to siege gg and seeding ranks.

I would love this but, if we were to implement this we would need exclusive weekly challenges based on our progress like say you needed to play an operator but you don’t have that operator. There would be conflict that wouldn’t allow you to complete all challenges. Since i complete all challenges available to me this idea would be awesome know i could get a reward for something im already doing
---
Tachanka - Power of the Lord
---
Jackal is more like smelling feet

man, he used to be but his content is more or less his friends making jokes and him repeating them

Watch him get super nerfed now and you no longer play him
---
That ain’t it chief!
---
I’ve been dropped quite a few times with it the past few days. Could just be a coincidence
---
So this might sound stupid but I'm a little new to this subreddit. How do you get the operator logo next to your username?
---
Eh I mean average is around 600-900 but it is on the lower end of the spectrum, sitting at 690rpm
---
Damn straight
---
I’m not sure that it is counted as an abandon. It may be that it depends how late into the matchmaking you quit, because I’ve seen evidence going both ways. 
---
I check R6tab fairly regularly and so noticed once that it had me down for a loss, in a game in which I had 0 kills and 0 deaths. That was a head scratcher, and my first clue that you could abandon a match in which you never played. 
---
I also had a game recently where someone left before character selection. I looked them up when it happened and they had 0 abandons on the season. I looked them up again a few days later and they had 1 abandon.
---
There already are weekly challenges. This is an idea for a reward for completing all of them
---
Oh, yeah well to detail nomad has an ability that is like lesion, if you trigger the trap it knocks you back and stuns you for a few seconds. I play R6 to take my mind off things but also cut when I can't. I don't care though if you want to talk then that's fine but I don't care.
---
One shot is death
---
That means no more extended barrel :(
---
That looks amazing
---
indeed
---
I agree with the first two, but the third I find depends on the player. Watch a youtube video of a console player playing siege on PC, their aim is just as bad if not worse than a pc player coming to console. My sensitivity on console is 67 vertical and horizontal. on PC, it is 39 vertical and horizontal. I cannot aim very well at all. When I hook up my controller and play pc siege however, I actually am able to get 2 to 4 kills per game with 1 or 2 being headshots. With mouse and keyboard, I am lucky to get an assist. Frame rates are a major factor though. I can run 4k at 60 fps no problem. But PC i am able to run 1080p at 270 FPS (not a super strong PC. A gaming laptop. not desktop.) Laning at the hip, while a hindrance for PC players to not have it, I find it useless. But that is a preference. Most likely an uncommon one too.
---
Rank is not a reflection of personal skill but instead a reflection of your win delta. Therefore anyone who says rank matters is talking out their arse... Only time rank as a general rule matters is in plat 2 + because you will struggle to get carried to a win into those ranks. Therefore plat 2+ is more of a reflection of skill compared to below that rank because you need to pull your own weight more in order to win. At least that's the only time rank matters to me.
---
(Obviously there are exceptions to this such as WingsOfRedemption who is completely shit but somehow gets diamond most seasons)

Otherwise throw an emp grenade or just fucking learn the game and common spots and you’ll find it. It’s not hard to find them. You’re the one saying dumb shit quit bitching and get better
---
Usually Conventions have rules so worth checking out. And of course, I change into the outfit on-site.

He's pretty good, been doing it 25 years so i trust him, he did a terminator too and it looks amazing
---
I never realized
---
Wtf... How?
---
The problem with that is it's literally not worth the renown at that point. The challenge doesn't give enough for it to be worth running 3 T Hunts, especially Maestro/Alibi since the defender t hunt takes longer.
---
It **was** a mechanic in the game's development stages where a player could "stack up" on a shield bearer and breach through soft walls..  **and was the entire inspiration behind what the shield bearer is doing in this artwork.** They did not keep this ability in the game for obvious reasons. So no, we aren't getting that.
---
R6 tab is a good one.
---
I ran into the same people
---
I’m sorry did they seriously switch it to the shit we have now?

thank you

That crazy bitch did it !!!
---
who says I play him haha
---
I honestly think Kaid would benefit greatly from a deployable shield. Especially the improved version.

Used to and still play him alot, love the design mainly

SMG's have a much lower DPS and TTK than every attacker rifle including Thermite's 556 which acts very much like Thatcher's and Sledge's L85. In a straight gunfight, Thermite's gun will win against any SMG. Considering the gun does 47 damage, you're 3 shotting every defender with the exception of rook plated 2 and 3 armors. Also, Thermite is a hard breacher and his gun is more than capable of fragging out, there's little reason to give an already balanced and useful operator the fragging power that matches dedicated fragging ops like Ash.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one with a brain on this sub
---
You can’t be talking about my operators. You’re a brain dead ash main. Cav is the shittiest operator, brings nothing to the team and is countered by having comms. Just a baiting operator.
---
I was confused for a second, then I realized I wasn't on r/ForHonor
---
Were you in a team with that « Mute »?
---
An ACOG to someone who can see through smoke (on the defender side) seems like extremely OP. He is fine as he is. He needs more mobility when using it. That's all
---
Finka's Spear ".308".
---
This makes me feel sick
---
Same i was wondering why this was happening
---
thanks, took 4 hours, Id get one if you want one, you only live once
---
That shit would be so funny
---
That wasn't a good or funny response
---
Vigil would just be nokk but better
---
They will never notice
---
https://youtu.be/mv3GK2R0dUo

Here is also a great video to answer your question. Start at 3 min.
---
I don't know what causes it. I've only had it once
---
You are literally too stupid to argue with. Good day to you. I'm not interested in arguing with someone this dumb.
---
I like the design though, even if it had nothing to do with the game, who says I'll be alive then anyway
---
I have no idea i think the most people i’ve had in a single push is like 3
---
username checks out
---
I wasnt the only one who though this!
---
Close enough
---
because your idea has no purpose
---
Yea me too
---
You were expecting something completely different.  But it is I, DIO!
---
That Caveira is a spy!
---
It has, a recruit buff
---
Thats because casual Is the new ranked, and ranked is casual
---
i wonder who the last enemy is 🤔

Hello jatt123890, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ckesdd/help_figuring_out_what_charm_this_is/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What you want is custom games.
---
Casual is for training strats for ranked, for most people who play as a team.
---
It looks more realistic than mute in the game
---
It isn’t latency. The interrogation animation is bugged. This issue has been pointed out before. The interrogation doesn’t count until after Cav has fully left the animation, even though the attackers gets killed about a second before the animation ends. This 1 second timing issue causes a lot of issues
---
But still managed to killed one
---
It's happened a few times for me, but it's not every game
---
I think you hit the nail on the head with "only Bomb has bans". Bomb being the favored child of Ubisoft really showcases how operators designs are skewed in terms of balance, and Echo's gadget is the single best tool in the game for denying plants and having intel on sites. It doesn't matter how many times you yeet someone around a room with your drone on Secure Area or Hostage from across the map, it's not going to win you rounds like it does in Bomb with a minute left on the clock, and that's entirely Ubisoft's fault.
---
Wish they added a setting in custom game where you could choose any operator at any round
---
Yep, it was a good place for a trap, i think it actually got me once
---
I agree. Also with Blackbeard being nerfed so much his shields are equivalent to a piece of plastic wrap
---
That’s literally my point. Why do you think the first word in the body of my post is “Fix”?
---
Memba 3 speed shield recruits
---
A pro controller isn’t a replacement for button mapping
---
Slap 3 mats there, that's how I got my first ace
---
Nøkk and fink 100%
---
That means he’s completely braindead.
---
Because the nitro cell is definitely the superior gadget and he was kind of underpowered. Not sure why they removed the wire and not the useless impacts but either way if your operator can run a nitro cell you should always be running it.
---
whats the gas mask model?
---
Very cool, keep it up. Would like to see more operators done in this style, maybe Mute next :)
---
dude just stop talking
---
Hide that shit from your fbi agent. Boutta be knockin on your door if they see that
---
Yeah but in those games you’re not nearly invincible behind a shield, with the capability of 1 shotting any enemy. That change would make shields completely broken.
---
If it's so much of a problem don't interrogate unless you know you're 100% safe
---
No but glaz needs one
---
Like i said, i joined last season, and it really isnt easy just starting off. But i raised by kd by 0.35 this season, so you are probably right.
---
Well...because it’s a video game
---
Nah, just block me
---
It’s not making the problem bigger it’s getting rid of it. The games meant to be playing with m&amp;k anyways
---
gj mate, well done.
---
nah
---
Kill the people shooting you.
---
So you don’t think it’s an issue that attackers can survive with a knife in their throat?
---
Well then I hope I get this map today so I can try this
---
"I'm gonna place you , sweetly I'm gonna shoot you gently I'm gonna activate it  descretly , IM GONNA BREACH YOU COMPLETELY. "
---
Well then i aint going to stop talking
---
Side side, to side
---
Thats not how it used to be before this skill based update and let me ask you if that is the purpose of casual i mean to tryhard ranked strats then why is it even called casual man cuz tryharding ranked strats isnt a very casual thing to do,when i hear casual i think of people there just for fun and relaxing and thats how it was before this skill based casual
---
I made a Facebook specifically for this purpose and upload my videos to there directly from my PS4, then I save the video from Facebook on to my phone
---
#MY EYES
---
Mute on attack.
---
I saw this same thing happen with caviera
---
Smart choice mate
---
so this is how Siege looks on PS5/Xbox Scartlett
---
Ez pz, just play frost and put trap there
---
I play on console and PC. My mouse has buttons that i just remapped. So i lean with my thumb on the mouse. Makes it easier for me but maybe not everybody.
---
I think it’s a pretty good idea but for balancing I would say decrease it to 3 total uses and decrease audible breathing to maybe like 5-7 seconds instead of 10 seconds.
---
Jager means Hunter in German you know that right?
---
I think it is a good change to it. Is there a suggestions subreddit I could crosspost too?
---
I understand why. But smoke still has his? It just seems like it fits with his gadget. He should have it. If your teammates aren't cooperative it can be frustrating.
---
Yup
---

thanks
---
Good just wanted to make sure
---
I would’ve pissed someone off if I did that
---
Dude I can't even play Minecraft with a controller and have a good time, fuck that.
---
This kid could accidentally hit someone through a wall and I'd be impressed.
---
Jammers for life
---
You just put it back lolll
---
then everyone would ddos when they're going to lose
---
what they need to do is get better servers/server protection
---
Mute them. And they're 12, and you're a grown man.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
In CSGO if you send too much information you will get kicked out of the game.
---
I never would have guessed TheJFKexperience would be so weaboo
---
Oh right, sorry I thought you were talking about the vents. I have never seen the solid wall places.
---
I knew it
---
Nice one tgat genuinly nade me laugh
---
Its tough to solo queue, if u wanna add me to play ur welcome to. My uplay is Awien.
---
He probably ate it
---
Better than losing elo?
---
Flawless loop
---
My guess as to why no one is talking about it is because the majority of the people who play siege regularly use aiding software of one sort or another, just go watch a random R6S streamer and youll see that they have no vertical or horizontal recoil at all, everything they use from smg-12's to acoged and silenced C8-SFW's is completely recoil free and thats the majority of streamers and youtubers  
---
Im guessing that ubisoft thinks its too big of a hassle to actually do anything about it, same with people abusing aiding software for the deaf to get unfair location awareness, EVERYONE fucking uses that shit unfortunately and its disgusting
---
clickbait btw and just a troll of Interro
---
#F
---
Not a valid excuse try again
---
They put the f in john f Kennedy
---
Tip: use jackal with the shotgun as the secondary. This allows you to bring smokes and still provide soft destruction. Also allows vertical play which is really useful on a good few maps.
---
I had a dream where I went to the John F. Kennedy dick museum, and it was just a guy's house where the walls were filled with framed pictures of dicks he suspected could be John F. Kennedy's
---
Lol, id recommend maybe switching to PC that helles for me
---
Ty!
---
If you look at the photo closely you can actually notice he did not claim the kill and rather an error occurred when the game registered it as his kill despite the real killer being a Glaz main on the grassy knoll
---
Let me guess . Military grade protection ?
---
Meant it could have decent detail
---
I saw the title, and I thought it was the For Honor subreddit. I got all excited, i thought we won the war!!!
---
Oh have you reached out to ubi?
---
each to their own I guess :P
---
Liverpool UK
---
Absolutely, I think it’s a beautiful piece of art and very well done, just not my taste.

Thx
---
thanks I think?
