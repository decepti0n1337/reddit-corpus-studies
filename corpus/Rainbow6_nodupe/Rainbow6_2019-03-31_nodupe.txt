---
If you get shot in the head irl, you‚Äôre most likely gonna die. Why would someone think it‚Äôs a good idea to remove that, especially since most shooters follow the same formula of dying in one shot to a headshot.
---
Well I mean recruit is the best op in the game 
---
oopsie
---
Yeah, I have some good friends that I usually play with when they're online, and my experience is usually fine. And I'm like the most inconsistent player ever, I'll drop 8 kills one game, then go 0-5 next game. 
---
Ash is a fragger. Fuze is almost useless, very situational
---
Your right
---
I can take a negative comment you comment is just pointless and takes away from the discussion.
---
The scorpion sounds and shoots like an a-10 warthog (look it up it sorta does)
---
If he had a Jager/Doc helmet the cosplay would be 110% the most accurate cosplay made.
---
It has become clear to me that you have absolutely no understanding of how this game is supposed to be played, and minimal understanding of the purpose of different operators 
---
?
---
If you spawnpeek too much ubisoft calls you home 
---
what that danish leek say?
---
A gun with bleed and blood trails would be incredibly overpowered
---
That's what I typically do but I never load into a game 
---
Zofia for pure utility, maverick for being a sneaky asshole, vigil for guns and clutch. Depending on which playstyle you use I‚Äôd go for
---

---
zofia for run and gun
---
Vigil for roaming and/or anchor with good guns
---
Maverick for slowly getting near objective and picking off kills
---
I heard the fo 12 is really good though
---
Same here, when I die, especially because of my trash aim, it tilts me really badly. Just laugh it off sometimes, it helps.
---
Dmrs will never be on defense because you have people come to you, exact reason why acog was removed. Smg doesn‚Äôt belong on attack because it‚Äôs long range pick offs with ars. Yeah yeah jackal has an smg but no one uses it realistically. Anything else you want me to point out that isn‚Äôt viable?
---
Well it's more of a suggestion just to kinda give and idea that the gun would be special rather then what it would actually do I'd love to hear if you got any possible idea for something it can do.
---
take a deep look at screenshot 
---
Does it have to do with the fps?
---
Oh lol nvm I figured it out üòÇ
---
lol "strat"
---
Where is J√§ger? And i love how Capatioa is the only planter nice
---
It is I'm just saying the scorpion does act like a-10 otherwise the fo 12 is good tho
---
damn. sorry man
---
What
---
From experience, there isn't. Though, I bought the game on PC when they made it so you had all base operators available for you from the start, so when I recently was able to play it I wouldn't need to grind as much.
---
Yea ik that's what it's supposed to be
---
Just practice, plus there is a lot more to it then just kills. If you go 0-5 but you were drowning everyone out then you are definitely the best player on your team. I know this may get downvoted a lot, but if you really need to play an operator like Blackbeard until you are super consistent. That way you always have an advantage and eventually you won‚Äôt need it anymore.
---
You on xbox?
---
No I'm on pc rip
---
Damn, I'm silver 2 rn but I'm pretty good I would've helped
---
Who your mains?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not a bad idea. To be honest I‚Äôm only gonna be buying a couple operators cause after 900 hours on PS4, there‚Äôs some I just never use. Thanks for the idea though 
---
Cool guess I should try throwing an impact at Maverick's blowtorch!
---
I said dbz :(
---
Wow.
---
Usually Hibana and Bandit but in ranked I go support.
---
i've had something similar happen to me. i saw a black-mirrior and a mira peaking through a hole next to it so i shot her. in the head
---
first shot: misses 
---
second shot: misses 
---
 i start spraying an every shot goes through the head. she then 1tapped me(i was pretty mad.)
---

Console has a lot of people who use mouse and keyboard who obviously dominate the majority of players who use controller. It‚Äôs not necessarily harder than pc, but at least pc is an equal playing field.

Has your sens stayed the same ? Maybe playing from pc to console is messing you up ? 60 vertical fov vs 90 fov is a big difference

This is cool. I don't know how maverick is a hard breacher. Also, why do people like roaming with Alibi? What are the pros of it?

Is this after patch?

right click on steam and select run as admin

Weird flex but ok
---
Yeah and that's a big reason why I think they need to really rethink spawn peeking and such. It really isnt a legitimate strat or really skill it's just if someone is paying attention and that's just stupid. And when there are ones you can do before anyone can react ots extra dumb. 
---
Adapt to it?
---
Like this was revealed in the test server ffs, you knew this was happening, learn to not peek know corners.

Can you put sledge in a category called smashing downed Caveria
---
If that's the National Bank of Bern then you'd have an exact match
---
cool concept, doenst work in reality. Theres a reason why shields are rarely used in counter terrorism operations once you enter the building. Limited mobility, shield needs constant support, and slows down the entire clear. Which in a hostage situation, or clear out situation, is what you do now want to happen. Waste time

Quality copypasta my man
---
Really has been a good thing it seems
---
Nice play but I hate shields so no upvote
---
&gt; Not every game should cater to a casual audience. 
---
So the 1 shot headshot mechanic is what makes or breaks Siege? Are people this deluded to think that this is such a great, game defying mechanic??
---
Honestly with all the defense ops people forget to check for the Kapkan and Frost traps these days especially the Kapkan traps
---
She's a good op if you know how to hide the mats.
---
noob question but how did you post a video on this sub? every time I've tried I get hit with "video submissions aren't allowed on this sub" 
---
Sniper 90 black ice. Nice!
---
That's all his vids, he titles them after one minute or so long section and then it isn't mentioned again
---
I'd flip their argument and say well clearly the game should function best for pros then. And I'd wager Pengu is not alone at all in thinking the 1 shot headshot mechanic is quite stupid.
---
F
---
Well pengu can shut the actual fuck up.
---
Frost is great. Just put them in completely random places and if it's under a window put 2 traps
---
This! Apparently "good aim" is just about hitting a head ONCE and then possibly missing every other shot, unable to stay on your target... but you hit the head once so best FPS player in Europe, bro!
---
I wonder how long until we get Sam Fischer as an operator...
---
They'd have to re-balance all the guns. All high RPM, low DPS guns would become useless overnight if they changed it.
---
This assumption is kinda weird to be fair since in theory if we had limited players in a game and everyone had the max friend list set to the game max players, it meant that no one would find a match since all them are friends.
---
In all seriousness, got matched vs a party of friends I met online that I haven't played for a year with, it was fun.
---
Thank you very cool!
---
impact grenade as hard breach denials..? is there something about those i'm unaware of? not sure how they stop breaching

This is probably a better solution for those guns than removing ACOGs.

Not really, all of the messages with banned words are not sent, and if you do it multiple times then they review it manually.

For the N word and such you will get banned since they will review it and will not think twice, but for others, I i doubt.

Good lord
---
Mains make sense
---
You got a clip?
---
oml you guys are so angry i‚Äôm just stating my opinion most people who complain about the one shot headshot mechanic usually complain because of an occurrence in a match where they are simply outplayed. pengu is entitled to his own opinions. i don‚Äôt have to agree with him. his playstyle doesn‚Äôt really rely on headshots so he just doesn‚Äôt want to be able to get headshot as easily
---
because shields in their current state are broken OP, why would ubisoft introduce more of them
---
You didn't actually argue against them, FYI.
---
I was thinking it could be similar to {|}
---
So yeah, kinda same thing
---
'DMR for defense'.
---
Kaid has TCSG, which is the closest you can get as DMR.
---
most people who complain about it usually just rage because they were simply outplayed I see it all the time in streams and games. 
---
This isn't an argument as to why the comment or Pengu are wrong.
---
You think Pengu just wants it to fit his playstyle... he's on the best team ever, winning everything... but him wanting to change a big game mechanic is only to benefit himself (or his team)? You're implying motive with absolutely no reasoning.
---
I always drop one crouch height and lean into it from the reinforcement. Then pop up from there. This, for me, makes it easier to c4 the other side through a shotgun hole. Compared to peeking my head out and getting domed.
---
I find people rarely shoot below when it‚Äôs at crouch height and if they do, then I see them and I‚Äôm already moving left/right and popping up to shoot. Seems to work really well in casual and I usually play high golds. 
---
The uniform was rare, the headgear was legendary 
---
yeah, but playing at more than 90 fov is useless so....

Just go ahead and play ranked. The game will que you up with people your same skill level after you finish your placements.
---
Yeah it's not like they dont "miss name" guns sometimes. Found out recently Mavericks ar15.50 is classified as an assault rifle in game.
---
Just something I think would be cool to have on defense one actually designated marksman rifle instead of shotgun.

Can we not downvote people just because they don't know a meme

thanks for being reasonable unlike everyone else that has a stick in their butts cause i stated an opinion

/s?

I can hear your laughter. and The rest of your teams laughter after the kill cam

I hope they stay that way tbh

U get that the c4 is very situational.

This is just what I do in my own, specific, offsite spots

If you buy the xim adapter and plug it into the Xbox you‚Äôll be able to use it on there

.... right. And I'm judging it. Why can't you take any criticism?
---
&gt; most people who complain about the one shot headshot mechanic usually complain because of an occurrence in a match where they are simply outplayed
---
Really? Can't AT ALL be because they watched kill cam after kill cam of a guy missing most of their shots but randomly hitting the head with 1 bullet and winning the gunfight out of luck???? Not saying your proposed situation doesn't happen at all but come on. Be real here.
---
&gt; i don‚Äôt have to agree with him. his playstyle doesn‚Äôt really rely on headshots so he just doesn‚Äôt want to be able to get headshot as easily
---
I'm not saying you have to agree with him. Just that you made no argument against his view or even in favor of your view.
---
And saying "well it's unpopular" (which you have no idea if it is or isn't) isn't an actual argument for or against mechanic.
---
I'm sorry, it's a bit complicated for a beginners guide, but you can do the "impact trick" in some walls and hatches. Basically some reinforces have still soft wall above them so you break that and throw the impact on the ceiling, it destroys thermite charges and hibana pallets (except the bottom ones). Similar with hatches on soft ceilings, if there's an object near the hatch you can throw it and destroy thermite charges and hibana pallets 
---
Got mine early on, season two or three of year one.  Placed a charge down on an outside wall on old clubhouse, got lazy when I wanted to plant another on a hatch instead, randomly blew it, boom, kill.  XD
---
Bruh imagine the faces when jackal kills somebody lol
---
I feel like native support should be added but then they get tossed in with PC players ;) 
---
also why would you take the ‚Äú99%‚Äù part so literally ._.
---
Why TF are you putting up a reinforcement in the middle of a 1v1
---
Your friends vs the friend who doesn‚Äôt know what Rainbow Six Siege is

Their censor system has the same quality standards as the SPLC, which once listed an entire town as a "hate group" because 2 neo-nazis once blogged that they ate at a restaurant in the town.

---
Note: I know it‚Äôs not really considered a nerf when it comes to talking about maps. My mistake)
---
Where‚Äôs the hostage hunter role? 
---
I get your point but seeing someone from anywhere after the interrogation just doesn't make sense.
---
So true, it‚Äôs just really lame 
---
It‚Äôs the power of god
---
Exactly. Therefore she deserves no nerf.
---
I'm not entirely against the removal of one shot mechanics for many guns. Look at how CS is right now, with only a handful of weapons being able to one shot kill to the head. It's used as more of a balancing mechanism. In siege it's practically universal, which means that all gun balancing has to revolve around it, rather than the other way around. Random one taps that happen by pure chance aren't fun, but it definitely is a way to punish people who make stupid moves.
---
The most critical aspect to me is the ability to 1v5 because of it. If you can get that first shot off accurately in time, then you have a chance. Having more than one headshot to kill means you've got so much more time in which the enemy can shoot back at you, do damage to you, and slowly take you down. It's why I hate playing Apex, despite it being a generally decent game. High TTK with low mobility just doesn't feel fun. I can't consistently take down an entire squad that was making bad decisions. The same would apply to an extent here.
---
That said, it's just not going to happen. The sheer amount of re-balancing that would need to occur is insane. Every single weapon would need to be worked on, as the little balance we have now would be thrown out entirely.along with the fact that it may end up driving a lot of the dedicated community away, which isn't what Ubi would want.
---
Cav has MASSIVE risk reward, git gud.
---
Here‚Äôs the problem, pulse doesn‚Äôt need a buff in any shape or form.  Yeah this is a cool situation for Tachanka to be in, but that‚Äôs a super specific scenario and literally any other operator could perform just as well.
---
Have fun man

Hey I‚Äôm coming back to call you a dumbass and say r/woooosh

How would he intentionally do this
---
It might be a yes and no, smurfs either
---
\-Mess around with low ranks
---
\-Be so bad at high ranks, they fill their ego via dominating the weaker ones
---
\-Boost their own teammates, usually this is imo one of the main reasons why people become so toxic, is because they cant trust  others after people start to boost their way up and ruin other people's fun
---
Throw games. But this might be photoshop.
---
That would be throwing like 200 games 
---
silver strats
---
Blitz feels frustrating to play against unless you start playing Blitz and then realise how often a Blitz player gets shot through his shield. Yes it sucks to be flashed by a Blitz, which is why Blitz is a punisher to deep roams. He needs two people to take down.  
---
Plane: Plane is a purely casual map, its not in ranked. And it has a BEVY of problems other than just Glaz. When playing plane, just play it chill, it actually is pretty fun

He's wearing American 6-Colored Desert camo 0/10 unlikeable
---
Shut up libtard
---
Ela's brother
---
Unless it is a glitch. Which I have never seen lol.
---
&gt; what youre stating doesnt really give a point towards tweaking the oshs mechanic
---
It does though. I mentioned what really makes a good aimer. Quick target acquisition, recoil control, and keeping your crosshairs on target. Just because 1 of your 10+ bullets landed on the head doesn't mean you're a good aimer. But if all 10 hit your moving target , it does. Does that explain it a little better? My problem with OSHS is while a lot of skilled players benefit from it, they also don't realize how many gunfights they lose to far worse players because 1 lucky shot hit their head. I'm nowhere near the ability of a diamond player but I've killed many of them. Not because I outsmarted them or they played recklessly but because aiming for just the head is impractical so while they aimed for mid &amp; upper chest, whether it was my inability to track them smoothly or control recoil, I landed headshots and won the fights. Didn't matter that most of my bullets missed.
---
^ The above is why. He knows he and other pros already have good aim and while they themselves benefit from some lucky headshots, they also die to bad, lucky shots because of it. And I'm not just talking about random wallbangs or hipfires.
---
I find a lot of people give Pengu shit for his complaints but he's not totally wrong. His main complaint for the past year at least is the sound in the game is trash and he gets shit in his own comments for saying it so often but no one actually argues against him because he's absolutely right about the sound in this game. Just like he was right about crouch and lean spamming.
---
How was I so oblivious :(
---
Getting into plat matches usually takes us about 5 minutes. But I can always get into a casual match in under 30 seconds if I don't feel like playing seriously. 
---
alright so how many games did you throw to get some karma 
---
No, there is no native support.
---
Jesus !!
---
You're saying that ironically right?
---
The score determining your rank
---
Thickbear
---
Haha the barricade is great

Way too accurate haha. Never even considered your point about boosting tho. That‚Äôs rlly ‚Äúeye opening‚Äù. That makes a lot of sense. Props my man.
---
No shit dude 
---
Absolutely Blackbeard. Even ive never seen people who use dat shitty skin. 
---
Them good ranked points you get when you win a ranked game.
---
That's the beauty of Outback, at least on normal there's no nitros or bombers. I wish they'd bring that to all the maps 
---
Not sure about bandit, but definietly jager (his gun was made for long range combat)
---
I mean, if the ping is on point (on the attacker himself) then heck no... it's like Lion... if its not on point then you can just ping yourself. Pulse doesn't need a buff to help tachanka, just rework the god 
---
Is the hostage naked? Lol
---
You should  add  shield category and place monty in the info gathering category cuz a skillful person playing monty can be a hell. To deal with for the opposite team also glaz can somewhat to an extent be used for info gathering cuz he can just stay far away and use his scope to find enemies
---
Also why did you not add jeagar (sry for the spelling) to the roamers?
---
Yeah why mix and match that is so tacky?! The lord oss_spy knows everything about this game! So I‚Äôd listen to him no matter what! 
---
[removed]
---
Yeah you cant do that. Because on console you play the game through xbox/playstation plis/live. Versus on PC you have to make a UPlay account, which isnt connected to your console platform. Sorry man. Shit outta luck 
---
I noticed that today seemed to be worse than most days, idk why. I normally only play casual to warm up for ranked but I didn't have anyone to play ranked with today so maybe I noticed it because I played a lot more casual than I normally do but I don't remember this much TK in casual lol
---
Yeah give him a sensor and make his turret able to wheel around. Then just to make sure he‚Äôs balanced toss in some explosive bullets

Yeah so you‚Äôre telling me that because the lion failed to kill the doc in the 4 seconds he‚Äôs shooting him, that the doc is less skilled for maintaining headshot level in panic and spraying? you‚Äôre forgetting the key here. The lion had advantage, and could‚Äôve used the same mechanic but instead fired chest level which ISNT the proper thing to do, especially in this scenario.

Good idea.

my group constantly finds those who tk for really stupid shit as well as constant message harassment. i dont find it that big a deal but it does show how toxic people are. i havent played ranked without 4-5 people team so i wouldnt know about ranked either

Drop the resolution. I had the same problem. If you‚Äôre trying to stream at 1080 there‚Äôs just too much for the stream to try and capture. Dropping down to 720 solved that issue for me.
---
What weapon is that
---
Getting 9mm glancing hit through 2 wooden walls into ballistic helmet is very unlikely to kill you. Taking 2x 7.62 shots to the chest or neck point blank will, unlike how it is in Siege.
---
This game is not realistic, it only appears to be this way to be more tacticool.
---
You most likely got put on the wrong servers it happens sometimes

Hello dtdt66, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7kjsd/a_former_rainbow_six_siege_developer_explains_why/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What program? 
---
Just Pengu asked for it though. The overwhelming majority of the pros don't want a change to it.
---
Who even has reown that tiny
---
If they rework it, make the hiboxes a lot better.
---
Actual head, insta kill
---
Ears, no insta kill
---
Upper chest, instakill/very high damage
---
getting shotgunned in the foot, not instakill
---
Just a tip, console or PC, play terrorist hunt to warm up. Dont play casual, because when you play casual, you're really just boosting your ego to think you're good, then when you go into ranked you think "oh I can kill these guys" and get absolutely raped. Thunt doesnt give you that, and is arguably better to warm up. 
---
And I care for what you have to say, so I asked. Please expand as I requested :)
---
Lmao. No they aren't.
---
I'd laugh if I wasn't too busy crying
---
ranked is not that toxic from silver 3&gt; below silver3 is a total shitstorm 
---
People are carrying out their pent up toxicity and teamkillikg before the changes come in
---
Is that kantoraketti 
---
Casual players actually love OSHS. It's a great crutch for poor aim and lack of recoil control.
---
understandable ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I used to do that but lately the frames have been god awful in Thunt like unplayable almost, so I just do casual anymore. Idk why but i'll do poop in casual then get into ranked and do really good idk it's weird, if the frames problem ever works itself out I'll probably go back to doing that though
---
You strived 
---
I‚Äôve been playing on and off since june. I started to get into it around Grim Sky
---
yeah until then their fuze killed me he ate up all mah bullets :(
---
Nice! It took me a little less but different for everyone
---
‚Äúlaughs in acog‚Äù
---
Xbox takes it shit seriously. You can get communications banned for a week if you say any form of swear words through messaging. So you can't talk to your friends/game chat and you can't send messages 
---
I don't do that
---
everytime I open an barricade there's some J√§ger standing behind it seeing me while I can't see him :(
---
Tuff, at least you tried your best.
---
You better hope I don‚Äôt catch you in the streets
---
they had a mission to help find cav's brother. twitch and valk were there too.
---
Actually they‚Äôre pretty soft
---
Xbox recording is just a matter of clicking two buttons. Haven't had an xbox for couple of months but I think it's still like that
---
Idk why this weekend was the time for the sweaty mnk kids to show up
---
Honestly I'm not sure, I've never noticed it before last night 
---
Thankyou for the knowledge I will now be the goddes of cheese kills
---
Well! Take recruit next time! /s
---
BB?
---
No worries Haha 
---
Lol american camo
---
mate you took some pretty obvious bait there, not gonna lie
---
Have you played lesion? Just curious because I think that will give a helpful perspective. 
---
this should be re functioned to reporting m&amp;k players since this is kinda the only way to cheat on console 
---
Reported üò§
---
My status? Well, I'm feeling a little [REDACTED]
---
Lol
---
üò†
---
btw the 12k match was cas or ranked?
---
So you don't bitch about their rank mid-game if they happen to die. 
---
its to reduce toxicity so people cant blame low ranked players for the loss
---
The aim was a bit questionable but I understand it's hard to aim on console
---
Casual 3-0 sweep. I‚Äôm fairly new to the game so I usually get out strated in ranked.
---
no way!!!
---
It's not too hard to tell a pc player from a console player.
---
Ain‚Äôt really new pros do it all the time since release of map
---
What is reporting even supposed to do? I have been reported a few times without consekvenses
---
You killed 3 people not looking at you üëè
---
Mainly because I‚Äôm silver 2 playing platinums 
---
Did you get an abandon penalty?
---
bruh that old pistol recoil
---
Makes sense, ty
---
watermark ur work!!
---
You're right J√§ger isn't on the list
---
Some people won't forgive you even if it is an accident. I've been tk'd after accidental tk's way too many times
---
yep
---
Mhhh the console I see
---
Yeah, thats what I thought but they still look undeniably similar to one another nonetheless
---
We all have our regrets in life. 
---
*Triggered after the first few shots*
---
True
---
Maybe just go with light orange?
---
Where is jager?
---
Sadly we can even chose our prefered maps, and we ask for a system like you suggest? Man, let's wait until Year 8 at least.
---
Cmon Ubi, you have a gem in your hands, give us map selection already.
---
Then why did you say not made by me
---
I don't get it?
---
I want to be his friend
---
Yeah, how was the burger? 
---
Lmao
---
I think this is just a start, they're testing the waters, and if it works they'll improve it and implement more
---
It does seem simple right now, but I can't imagine they'd put a lot more work in this system if there's no guarantee it'll work
---
GO CRAZY AHAAH GO STUPID AAHAHA
---
He send me his Instagram, all the photos should be on there @Pinambo
---
FBI is kinda light Orange, I can see them going with Gold or Navy blue 2 colors they have yet to use, Most the colors we already have and they can't go with plain white as we wouldn't be able to see their icons unless they put their icons in front of a white background but that's Vigil.
---
So you won 5-6 and lost once, today? /s
---
This is likely a Microsoft issue and not a ubisoft issue. The last wave of DDOSers got your ip from having you join a party, meaning xbox live exposed your IP, not the game. 
---
o good spot my bad.
---
*gets locked outside* 
---
Guess you'll die
---
sorry dude I was just messing with you... you can set your "user flair" on the sub page :) 
---
That sounds like a burn but I‚Äôd definitely take 5 wins to every 1 loss 
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because his gadget doesn‚Äôt help with roaming
---
Sweet guns
---
This is some crazy sensitivity in console! What are you running OP?
---
Everyone in this video is toxic and whats wrong with Rainbow...
---
He's on console??
---
add blitz and type "replacement for genji" as sub head
---
We need a new flair: door barricade
---
I ones got a ace with clash without using my secondaries lol
---
Always happens to me too. You either get carried and don't have to do anything or you play with morons, do work, and it still isn't enough 
---
That's exactly what I would like. They even said that they're going to add mid seasonal events every season. Then imagine how could it would be to get flying-healing drones, a foam launcher to block enemies/holes, or even a placeable turret which shoots flames.
---
SAWCON THIS DICK GADEEM
---
I would buy this
---
I disabled chat when Ubi gave us the option and have never activated it since. I like the game more.
---
I get the standard is transitioning to 60 fps but 30 fps isn't *that* bad.

wow that sub exists 
---
I think it is, didn‚Äôt work the last time i tried it.
---
Why
---
Looks better than in game
---
I believe almost every FPS game is one shot headshot... not just R6.
---
Wait what?? You can't transfer UPlay accounts? Like you can't just login on the new pc?
---
Do any universal skins pop up in the middle of the season? 
---
Yeah I made it simple for the basic roles 
---
That's why it's called begginers guide 
---
It can be completed only on defend the hostage game mode which is the least popular of em all. If nothing else it's mispriced for the time it takes to complete.
---
Its one of the things that make Siege truly stand out. Dunno why some ask to remove that. Its part of the core mechanic of the game. Its like asking to remove the tactical elements like reinforcing, gadgets etc. Every time if the developers listen to whatever the community asks and blatantly implement that, then Siege will become like a typical run and gun game.
---
Looks pretty cool, i would like to see the JTF2 ops someday 
---
It's not that simple but it has to be simple at first for the beginners. It's a "begginers guide"
---
Nope.

Sick af!

Oh I have bad internet myself, that's how I know high ping is a disadvantage haha

Slower rate of Fire what the fuck?! The Soviet Savior deserves all the glory of the Shpagin!!

I get put into 1-2 matches along with at least a couple more people

Like 840 lol
---
Quite common in plat/diamond games
---
The capacity of it like 41 or 51. And have it  medium high damage

Ok, i play this game After Chimera, i thought that one was given for free though

its been like this since over a year, so what on earth made you think this is reddit worthy?!

Ahhh, it was something like "always stay put when you're the last defender" right?

Well, I would like to point out that my age does not matter. I can still notice an error and point it out.

Why does me pointing out a grammar mistake via a joke make you look through my account?

If anything, this video is proof of your statement.

Time to use up your two teamkills.

Custom homemade legos.. I remember me and my older brother did something similar to make mortal kombat toys. Good times
---
It was clearly a joke. Only intelligent people know what those are anymore. 
---
Roger.
---
I'm basing my argument off OPs clip and the usual kit for Maestro which is always ALDA and the best choice, Bailiff. Now if you are going to run AA12, ofc take the Keratos because that best fits.
---
It's a matter of most suitable , not simply the best.

---
If you arnt having fun then why are you playing ;-\]
---
sometimes people just need to push to the limit
---
Can someone verify if it fits a grenade?
---
What the fuck
---
No. After this they all TK‚Äôd each other to defuse. Also it‚Äôs ranked and I‚Äôm tryna grind you know. 
---
Gun doesn‚Äôt have much recoil and I like long range engagements 
---
Headgear: pop art valk
---
Uniform: thicc forearms doc from the invitationals
---
Weapon : probably the one matching valks headgear 
---
Outstanding Move
---
Ouch.
---
Definitely would buy
---
I used a programm to determine the hex-codes of the colors used in each icon and tried to pinpoint them on the color wheel. Sometimes colors can feel a bit off (GIGN), because they have a strong color gradient.
---
Was inspired by this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7lmw7/ubisoft\_have\_ran\_out\_of\_colors\_for\_next\_season\_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7lmw7/ubisoft_have_ran_out_of_colors_for_next_season_we/) by u/WraithVoid.

Quite interesting to see which colors the future operator icons could get.
---
Teammate: ‚ÄúI gave you the best gift one could ever receive: Motivation.‚Äù
---
Yeah sorry mate
---
Yeah it was weird, she was complaining to me while was going off with vigil 
---
Best bet is to try and get into ranked. Just dont care abiut yout ranj and play to have fun, but still try.
---
You're toxic
---
Definitely border.
---
Yep.
---
Likely because the reinforcement wasn‚Äôt up to their head yet, or some form of lag. 
---
Ping enemies is important, but using mic for callouts is vital. Clash is an intel operator just as much as a distraction
---
Nonono. If you login with the same uplay account all your shit is still there. The problem is only console to PC.

If you thought any of those words make you look smarter, I feel bad for you.

Yeah that's the R6 goto insult whenever someone does something you don't approve of. 
---
Would work but people would be upset that games would last a bit longer
---
Alien Isolation 2 looks good
---
Y MY PP HARD?
---
You're right. I don't approve of locking my teammates outside for them to die. 
---
So yes, I will use the go to insult. You're toxic 
---
Nope. My average KD yesterday was around 2.0. I know how to play siege thank you. The reason why in this clip I look like lucky potato was because I panicked a bit (it was unexpected come on) and I rarely play maestro (pretty much only sometimes on this site). The reason I didn‚Äôt kill the fuze was because I was at what 6 health? And he was a full health 3 armor at range yet I still got him low. 
---
I once got a fucking Slipper as a Legendary Charm and thanks ubisoft.

If you say so, Mr or Mrs. CoDLiTe

What platform?

I do say so, thank you.

Wow these guys are assholes but if I can calculate anything correctly if you tried to crawl back in there you would have had like 10 to no health and that doc would end up wasting two stims in my opinion

He‚Äôs not respect outside of his play skill, you go tor PL reddit, he‚Äôs kind of a laughing stock.

CS GO has the same mechanics, I don‚Äôt see a complaint around that?

Yeah sorry for getting aggro lmao but yeah I zoomed right in and I think I shot his shoulder which was in the way of his head

Finka 
---
Console aim OMEGALUL
---
FUZE
---
I just really don't care for this kind of post.
---
Finka can be boring after a while but her ability and guns are really good. Ying has a mediocre lmg but her gadget is useful for bomb, or if you want yo clear a room. Both are best neutralized with a communicated team
---
In your next post, you say you've never played him. Which is it? 
---
Never have hence why I don't know how he works (should probably clarify that)
---
I draw with my feet
---
And ur flexing with that black ice I see
---
At the core they are both entry fraggers but i would go with finka because her load out is better. 
---
bruhh thats actually amazing holy moly
---
The thing is I main her, and she's my favorite character. Because to me she's the only one who has any resemblance of character in the game since she actually shows emotion. Sadly to Ubisoft she's just a trash bin to them.
---
yes it just check this guys video out  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7ge0i/maestro\_alibi\_floating\_evil\_eyes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7ge0i/maestro_alibi_floating_evil_eyes/)

White with black logos would be dope.

What happens if you put one or two in a doorway/window? Is it possible to block vaults etc?
---
Legit
---
A lot of people agree with this, Pengu is the one that really is the one pushing for it.
---
Lets take a look at other things Pengu has complained
---
about.
---
Illegal Spawnpeeks
---
Calls other people ‚Äúshitty ranked players‚Äù because they do a runout spawnpeek in RANKED saying that‚Äôs illegal in the ESL rules. 
---
Complains about people 5 stacking in ranked
---
Literally runs with at LEAST 2-3 PL players in his squad and in GO4s complains people who play ranked don‚Äôt play GO4s enough 
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/MaybeNotBadger/status/1109938360561426435?s=19
---
Nice little read
---
Now Pengu is a GREAT PLAYER and so are other who agree with him. They say this game isn‚Äôt about realism, and I agree, you care around big ass metal walls with you.
---
HE IS WRONG about headshot taking no skill, it‚Äôs very hard to control a gun with a moving target across distance. CS Go has headshots thru objects and 1 shot headshot, that‚Äôs been around how long? 
---
Its not wright
---
I'm oblivious what's funny?
---
Castle isn't meant to protect site. He's meant to obstruct avenues of approach and lines of site. Blocking off areas to funnel approach or to prevent long sniping is his main use.
---
With Ash, Zofia, and Sledge able to crack the barricades easily, it's uncommon for them to have major impact. Though sometimes you get lucky. 
---
toad, how did you add the 'operator main' to your profile?
---
Atleast for Bandit it's because he's 3 speed, 1 armor which is optimal for roaming. 
---
He also has a pretty good gun.
---
they are just invisible when you put it on here back it isnt possible to block anything you will just walk thru them 
---
Lol it's Gucci bro I do it all the time

And 3 kills for 1 death is always worth it.
---
someone didnt hear the audio cue
---
Same strategic skill as noob-tubes...
---
Just do it on the other side?
---
I shouldnt have to. If this client side debry would get fixed it wouldnt be a problem
---
Glitch?
---
I almost didn‚Äôt notice the loop
---
Well that's because you can't really hack on current gen consoles, if at all
---
All that time wasted and a c4 wasted when you could just walk to the other side and reinforce there

Meleeing doc is the universal sign for pls heal me

I shouldnt have to if this game worked properly.

Awesome

This post big gay

Villa is a little bit to square for me personally. I feel that there just is not too much variety, except for the trophy room site which I enjoy defending.
---
What the fuck is a borther?
---
True but it‚Äôs not like there wasn‚Äôt a way around the issue. Hopefully it‚Äôll still be fixed though 
---
"I am you but stronger"
---
I definitely see operators with Turquoise or aqua blue coming
---
P.S) OP this Post was extremely creative and interesting to see
---
I think Thermite is just out done by hibana.
---
Dinohype is my fuck daddy
---
So, you could replace "N" with it... Search me what else, but I'm not sure if the implications for changing "N" could just be an immediate censor
---
Now get 2 defenders to operate those cams
---
You should try aim at head level, you'll get more headshots, and you'll be able to drop more opponents. And yeah, definitely try decreasing your ADS sens and maybe even increasing your non-ADS sens
---
How do you do it?
---
That means in order for you to get mvp your teammates have to be extra bad, and the enemy team just a tiny bit better than them, but not as good as you. 
---
Obligatory thin your paints psa
---
It copies the rules over though. You just have to change the map 
---
Well, you are wrong then. 
---
Exactly. I didn't even realize I got the kill honestly
---
Eating ramen noodles would be pretty neat using feet. 
---
Both ops have poo guns, especially finka.
---
Finka is a lot more fun to play. Ying is more competetive when played right.
---
Always the slim possibility hes just way better than his buddies and he doesnt get to play with them often. Maaayyybeee??
---
We got a nice open dark blue at the bottom

I hope not. The map isn't perfect but I enjoy it a lot. It's miles better than Skyscraper and Chalet. And I personally like it more than Hereford, Fortress, and Kafe.
---
The only map that I think should be taken out of the ranked pool is Skyscraper. The wide variety of maps is one of the things that keeps this game interesting to me. I'd rather play some maps that aren't as good than only play on a tiny pool of maps.
---
Reveal? No, leak. It was leaked so probably Ubi will release it with the MSR
---
i mean with the invisibuff i disagree i would much rather have 3 enemies at 20 than 1-5 enemies at 90

Okay you don‚Äôt deserve to play the game
---
Maverick, Ash, Zofia, Sledge... so many ops counter it by now.
---
Can it block doors?
---
Ok thanks 
---
Same as well
---
I hate you guys 
---
Keep track of what exactly you get on a spreadsheet please! It'll be nice to take a huge sample for drop rates of each item. All you need to do is record the name, type (skin/headgear/uniform), rarity, and if it's a duplicate or not.
---
Black? Chrome? Transparent?

Circle? Triangle? Pentagon? Hexagon?
---
Lime green 
---
Most people don‚Äôt know that i am depressed
---
I will! It will be streamed on Twitch and posted to YouTube. Everything will be counted and broken down! 
---
Fuze falls under gadget denial right? You can't really put him under electronics counters cause he's blocked by Mute, but if you manage to get a cluster charge off (e.g. by playing vertically) it can destroy every gadget on site. 
---
I mean smoke is gone and he's a roamer
---
A dark blue probably
---
It's hard to put my finger on it, but personally I just hate both attacking it and defending it. They both feel hopeless to me. Whole on a map like Oregon, Border etc I always have a plan and it's fun to both attack and defend.
---
You don't want to or you could just not bear such terror?
---
Currently my favorite map 
---
It looks like the guy on the left in the black shirt is looking at the girls ass 
---
Well, let's see, they probably want to get some of the old and new ops an elite skin first, though I'd be curious, though, as to what they'd make the elite tho
---
She‚Äôs not one of the most used ops, but it would be cool to see one.
---
Nah just playing haha good shooting
---
Same here
---
Wow I like it
---
And then he moved?
---
Nah we know 
---
xD
---
Lemme guess, clay? Expertly crafted.
---
Is your xbox set as your home xbox? 
---
Why does some numbers makes yoi satisfied
---
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IVE SEEN SOMEONE REFER TO HIM AS LARDEX, FINALLY!
---
She definitely isn‚Äôt on one of the most picked, if you look at the pick rates that Ubisoft publishes it shows that she‚Äôs behind castle, mute and montagne in pick rate
---
No
---
Still waiting on the bandit one to drop
---
Black
---
1) it's exactly triple 0s
---
2) it's exactly enough 4 me to buy a Y1 op
---
downvoted for kb+m on console
---
Yes it's a problem. Yes do consider playing less Siege and/or not open carrying firearms. Fucking hell.
---
I'll run it by my buddies and I'll give you my ubi account name, at work rn
---
Remember the netcode? Dying around corners was great, it‚Äôs why I stopped playing for 2 years
---
Honestly I 80% of the time do it to castles who do that type of shit because with over 1k hrs of playtime I'm tired of that shit
---
Allright 
---
You a fuse main? If so put the gun down.
---
How about not open carry if you dont have proper self control you moron.
---
Ubisoft has been slow to do anything with the game.
---
Alright, I think I'm getting Thermite next, possibly Kapkan for defense, because of his nifty traps.
---
Jesus you someone missed the 6+months of \#buffblitz? And Bartlett literally has 2 entrances that arent a window, the front door and roof hatch it isnt balanced for PVP and Ubi said that dozenz of times but the community demanded the map as soon as possible bc they wanted a new map, then when Ubi released it, again after confirming people wanted it as is, everyone bitched it wasnt balanced and Ubi didnt do their job
---
So again I say Id rather Ubi not listen to the vast majority of players here
---
I think a dark blue would be best.
---
I believe you
---
I really hope there‚Äôs a dark blue/purple one 
---
That‚Äôs a lot of red.
---
some purpley blues and bright greens I guess. I mean maybe they will have grey aswell
---
Yeah but Trump's 6G team is gonna wreck them!!!1!!
---
/s
---
Also I full black and white could be cool
---
Very true
---
Thermite is also a pretty easy Op to play.  Just let your teammates tel you which wall to blow
---
Pink
---
This feature might was stolen from Minecraft.
---
Frost is my favorite op other than hibana
---
we need this post on reddit more to let them know the game is working with glitch strategy 
---
Mute and bandit are always good on defense bc there gadgets dont require your attention while you look for kids (unless bandit tricking but that comes later) this would allow you to focus on aim and headshots that way you could learn to frag in r6 a game where aiming is arguably the most important 
---
For attack I would say twitch or thermite. Twitches gun is amazing and can get headshots fairly easily and the recoil is easy in my opinion and thermite has a great assault rifle and a very useful gadget and is arguably the best hardbreacher. Thatcher is a really good pick to both of his assault rifles are really good and his gadget is the most helpful in the game l. I would run his ar33 due to its easy recoil. Also Thatcher never becomes irrelevant as you progress through the ranks and is always a huge help cant think of a game where a thatcher didnt come in handy but twitch and thermite are also good at higher ranks if mastered. DO NOT TRY AHIELD OPS they wont allow you to practice aim and become less relevant in later games in my opinion especially with new ops like nomad and buffs to ppl like smoke shield ops are just slowly becoming more vulnerable. 
---
don't open carry then lmao wtf 
---
I need me a deep blue i love deep blue
---
Who is the middle person even supposed to be?

I just got that one earlier this week by playing the situation where you defend the hostage as Smoke. I was on PC and it is considered a uPlay challenge, so I‚Äôm not sure if counts as a console achievement or trophy, but I got uPlay points and the notification in the top right for doing that.

I hope they do more purple and pink ops c:

Then I was like:

Wooooooooooooah wait a minute.

Ubi just needs to invent a new color. 
---
Floor evil eye
---
Alright, sounds good, I just gotta play one more round to get him.
---
Holy shit I saw a floating evil eye a few days ago and now I feel vilified
---
Ah sick brah I  remember doing this on the Nintendo Switch. But for real sick clip. 
---
am i the only one that enjoyed bartlett in casual?
---
well you‚Äôd be able to go past it. Ubisoft must have thought of that because you can place them in doorways without glitches 
---
Yeah, we definitely could. -A friend of Ians
---
Ubisoft ~~has been~~ is slow to do anything ~~with the game.~~ whatsoever.
---
FTFY.
---
r/WhyWereTheyFilming
---
So you‚Äôre saying you can‚Äôt replicate this on any system?
---
Yeah they should just down you 
---
Woah, there‚Äôs been 10 new operators since I last played? I swear White Noise came out like mid-last year...
---
D
---
Yeah, that one is better too, I just don‚Äôt like using it.
---
You're a degenerate 
---
That red dot offends me 
---
Delete this post
---
What about a blank 
---
Thats what they say when they don‚Äôt wanna play with you...
---
IMO they shouldn‚Äôt even damage you, just knock you back in the same manner nomad things do
---
Then it‚Äôs probably not for you lol. I‚Äôm not either, I don‚Äôt ever play the FBI on defense, although I love ash (rip acog)
---
I think I said it wrong
---
Cant upvote, sorry
---
r/ihadastroke btw
---
I‚Äôm upset her recoil is so god awful. Nerf her mines and buff her recoil please üò≠
---
LOUDER 
---
spawn-plosing
---
Yeah the attackeers for the FBI are one of the best operators but all I see in defense is pulse sitting on site and everyone locked up in the objectives while fuze smiles
---
Understood. 
---
Jackal is 100% an info gatherer and not a soft breacher

That doesn't even make sense. Are you trying to say BF level design is bad? Or that the netcode is bad? You realize BF has a better netcode than RB6, right?

I think it's just a hit reg issue. No way he missed all of those shots. 
---
He always does.
---
oOf my bad
---
Keep banging your head on a wall until the wall takes pity on you. Worked (somewhat) for me.
---
Fuze is a Electronics counter
---
Click on the sub reddit and then in the top right there should be 3 dots. Click those and then it should say something like ‚Äòshow user flair‚Äô. Click that and choose who you want. 
---
*spawnpeek
---
Go to the subreddit and tap on the three dots then choose change user flair. Pick blitz
---
Sure he hit the shot but people who play like this are nauseating as hell to watch. 
---
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT IANS FRIEND MADE!?!
---
If you slow it down you see that only blood comes out of his legs and no bullets leave the gun on the head you simply marginally missed the other shots.
---
Yeah its always been like that for me too, Ive just learnt to accept it 
---
"They said it could not be done"
---
100 hours is nothing. obviously you aren‚Äôt gonna be the best. 
---
Are you talking about people on console that use mouse and keyboard to play? If so then yeah I think it‚Äôs an unfair advantage that should be removed.
---
No it doesnt transfer
---
I'm saying the maps and netcode of Siege are better than Battlefield 1 &amp; 5, yes.
---
I never die after ducking behind cover in Siege.
---
Pink and black
---
Does this mean we need another operation health?
---
Just based off colors with more shading options, I doubt we'll see any more purples. But I would bet on a dark blue, a goldish color that is clealy different from bandit and blitz, and a lime green, unlike the dark green that's already used. 
---
I would also love to see a primarily black operator. Like vigil except less white in the frame.
---
I don't think so, but I want to make sure the Rook knows that someone appreciates their efforts, even if the defenders won't! 
---
ADSing with an ACOG at same sens as 1x is the same as using Kaid &amp; Nomads secondary, awful IMHO. IIRC there is a way to do it via the ini file but I do not remember how.
---
Me too bro
---
Put it this way, it ain't happening. Get used to it
---
I always thought it was the difference between Ubisoft accounts and Xbox accounts or maybe something similar.

Lol it's called a bot sliver smurf some one who stays in sliver ranks to boost my guy . He most likely plat plus skill level.

But I think everybody who plays rainbow has a uplay account, I don‚Äôt see why this could not be used to play on different platforms, unless the way they have specifically stored player data and progress prevents this

My RL folks know Burnt Sienna when we see it.

But your feet smell so good :(

I‚Äôm not sure. Is a uplay account the same as an Ubisoft club account? Or am I just stupid?

I believe they are synonymous with one another but I could be wrong

Shoot when I was putting in work one session on my main I was stuck in sliver carrying plats and beating a few diamonds here and there solo ones at least . But the point is there are slivers who are plats on other accounts. Like not fake under 100 plats just unlucky smurfs who deranked for who knows what reason.  Very rarely are there true slivers who can carry that weight other then playing to much rank that season making there elo move like 5 points a win .
---
The highest rank, sever doesn‚Äôt matter.

Just unsub

He just abandoned every game when he was about to lose

Not a bug, there are a fee people like him

Oh you're totally right! It's actually more of a Burnt Sienna (googled it) I was mixing up GSGN and SAS.

Its actually not, ran into him in casual tried to invite too, he didn't even try to hide it.
