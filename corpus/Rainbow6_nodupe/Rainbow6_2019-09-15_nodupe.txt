It‚Äôs a shotgun. If she‚Äôs far away then she can‚Äôt kill you. If she‚Äôs close then it‚Äôs normal to die fast to a shotgun

It objectively does something. Making the time to kill worse when it is already bad is not a good thing.

I don't know how good players are, you can enjoy rainbow six totally toxic game, where environment is dominated by cheats, where people use third party programs in a good way without having problems.
---
I know there are other games that also have hacks more in my opinion, there is no rainbow six, where bugsoft does not bother to do anything to end it, where once hackers give more money to the company than players who play the game without spending a dime on the in-game skins.

Wait what I thought u can't matchmake with people way lower than u on elo the unranked one their elo should be  between 2500 and 3000 and the champion rank u can achieve it after 5000 elo so it should be impossible to team up with them unless this is unranked playlist

If MW committed to long term content releases (at least more than a year), then I think it could be a serious contender for knocking Siege down a peg. Granted, the destruction in Siege is still A1, so that might be Ubi's saving grace.

You can destroy doors, different fences, wooden shacks without a roof, vehicles and it's tires. And a lot of how the game goes depends on how you play. I have a blast chasing sounds of gunfire and engaging both parties and hopefully snagging kills. Or even better when you ID a falling supply drop and take up a defensive position to engage players running toward it and out gun them with the newly aquired loot. I even love trying to out play the last several survivors by engaging and stealing their position and hoping that it gives you a superior position to defend and out play the next player. But you're right, there are rounds where everything stacks against you and you have to run to the next zone or your meds or supplies are abysmal or you only have a pistol and a shotgun and are forced to run through an open field for safety.

Here‚Äôs an explanation I heard, and would think is fairly accurate. They‚Äôre trying. It‚Äôs just more appealing to cheat in siege because of soft walls, one shot head shots, and the overall competitive nature of the game. The first two lend themselves extremely well to cheating, and the third makes it more ‚Äúsatisfying‚Äù (I guess? Idk, I don‚Äôt like ruining fun) to cheat. As soon as they patch one thing another comes up, there‚Äôs constantly new types of cheats being used. Along with constantly making new maps and operators, this all strains the devs, which translates to cheating being an ongoing issue. (It used to be much worse, but it‚Äôs still pretty bad)

---
The team was just terrible. You just got lucky with your bad aim.
---
I don‚Äôt get why everyone‚Äôs so upset, imagine you go against hackers in 3 consecutive games, you know they are hacking, like teleporting and what not, so just suicide every round to end the game as soon as possible, say you do that 3 times and now your down 50+ elo, so when you queue up again, your going to go against people of lower ranks, that is now your chance to push as much as possible, you get to go against easier people than you probably would‚Äôve gone against if you won 3 gam a without the hackers, and say you won 3 games now without hackers, in a  few days your going to get 3 games worth of Elo  back from the mmr rollback, which will significantly push your rank up. It would suck if you were paired up with a hacker and they weren‚Äôt hacking that game making you lose elo, that would suck, but with obvious hacks you can use it to your advtange

Nope. Since you traded with doc, you killed the last surviving guy on the enemy team while you had another person alive at the time. Also your team still had plenty of time for a plant.

the times you are lifting your sights to your face is still counted as hipfire im pretty sure, so its useful to have on certain characters, I personally think they are usable on attack, defense is mostly nogo, but in the end its just personal preference

I don't think that is true. At what point are we starting to count? Original females were IQ, Ash, and Twitch? Frost could be called cuter than them. Valk was ugly on release, but Cav is hot. Hibana was cute in game but ugly in her profile picture originally, I think (then they made her cuter). Mira, Ela, Dokkaebi, cute. Finka, not so cute, but then we have alibi. Nomad is okay, then the memes say Nokk is actually cute under there.

Maybe that's true. It's just, I've played playstation for 26 years and never played an fps on console before. The learning curve would be steep - but I know you're right; would be hard to go back once I'm confortable.
---
Only thing that's stopped me going for siege pc is that I'd need to buy a gaming pc and there also aren't servers in Middle East (I live in Dubai). Thought they would've sorted that out after 3+ years - especially with Microsoft Azure servers being added to Middle East in the summer. Maybe they are testing those servers as we speak..

I think it's also a regional thing too. I have never experienced a DDoS yet but maybe that's because I'm on PC.

I'm currently staying in apac right now and one of the more rampant/obvious thing that I encounter are afk bots in TH. In my experience, you could even get 3-4 bot teammates in a match 1-2 times out of 10 and 8-9 times out of 10, there is at least 1 afk bot. This is mostly on eas and seas. Then they sometimes migrate to wja.
---
But when I play (see: farm) with my friends back in NA, those numbers significantly drop. Only ever seen 1 in my months of playing TH in wus (and I think that dude was just genuinely afk and not a bot), only the two same guys in eus, and when going over the pond, only one same guy in weu, and none in neu yet.

See, they are DDossing other people, they are DDossing Microsofts servers that Ubisoft rent. That will be costing them money everytime a server goes down, so yes, they do care

So? Kd doesn't matter.
---
Bullseye!
---
Thats what I was trying to figure but not articulating. Gotcha
---
I'm glad I can help out.

The thing is they are losing money, and since it's Microsoft severs that Ubisoft rent, everytime a server is attacked they both lose money, so it's in their interest

Kill death has nothing to do with why they were placed apart. It's their previous ranks. Those factor in now. Basically you are placed halfway between your last rank and 2500. So if you were at 3500 you will start your placements at 3000.

It's your previous ranks. Those factor in now. Basically you are placed halfway between your last rank and 2500. So if you were at 3500 you will start your placements at 3000. (with maximum of 1500 and 3500 I believe.

I think it might have something to do with what you got last season
---
Still doesn‚Äôt really make sense if we were in the exact same games? Unless last seasons performance factors into it because I had a terrible season üòÇ

Yup

Interesting as to why they would do that, thanks for the reply tho. I still achieved gold 1 last season but my kd was probably 0.8 üòÇ

This season is quite bad with all the ddosing, crappy servers however I think this new mmr change has done us good in general and I have received my first ever plat this season after playing since November 2017

Why do they keep changing faces? Do many players care what their faces look like enough to want them changed? Seems like a massive waste of time to me

Despite getting a nice looking charm at the end of the season, ranks arent an ingame challenge to achieve. you can give yourself the task of hitting a higher rank, but for the purposes of the game, it's a matchmaking system used to make fair and better games. If you're good enough to hit plat, you'll end up there and if you're good enough to stay there you will.

Don't buy either yet, they might add a cool skin later in the season, I think they added the Chinese new year skin some time during wind Bastion, which is one of the best universal skins in my opinion
---
She went from an eel to a humang being. That surgery was too expensive.
---
Aw right thanks man.

They have added universal skins mid season before though, like the Chinese new year skin

It's 2 years old, it's from that bundle w the cassette tape charm

Bruther, there isn't a casual k/d displayed on your profile.

This is the quality kind of shitpost I‚Äôm in this sub for.
---
Good idea but I dont think that will increase his pick rate as:
---
1. Most bomb sites aready have enough soft walls for bandit to electrify, adding that ability will just make it a lot more confusing.
---
2. Its also the fact that castle blocks off both the enemy team and your team, so its essentially a double-edged sword. This will most often create blockages that will harm your team more than the other team cus often times the attackers will just make a hole in the wall instead of using a doorway, this means that you are blocking your roamers from retaking and they will have to adapt to enter through probably the only place to the objective and thus will funnel in the roamers into limited areas of entry.
---
OP talking about Diffuser, Comments talking about an Hostage... Pretty sure it‚Äôs a brand new secure area mode.

Fair enough

I believe they let you see the assets used in game and during design i.e art or scrapped dialogue/skins.
---
and you sound like a child of pedophilia victims

Lol bruh... I actual dumb laughed when I read this

Just checked, my bad. Still, they are probably gonna remove it because the no memes rules.

I‚Äôm still waiting on my Montaigne elite, but hopefully that will be soon

You can‚Äôt until Tuesday I believe, season pass holders get them a week before everyone else.
---
I know that I am talking from my own personal exleriences, I play on ps4 and am Plat, some days its a common occurence, other days it wont happen at all. Its frustrating when it does happen tho. I understand there are more important things for the devs to focus on, but I just like to complain sometimes lol.

Please ubi look at the agreement people have

Yes they are, they're only available to season pass holders though

Do not hit the fax/copy machine, I think it won't let you vault if it breaks. Leaning gives you a bigger angle but I was dumb and didn't showcase that.

Well, you got a previous response of pretty much how is everything, I only played the first day of the season 4 matches and got ddosed in one of them, usually on high plat it's unplayable. Last season got ddosed in 2 matches straight being 3-0 and like maybe 10 more matches about to win.

Hopefully they can do something about it.

I'll try to play today to finish mt placements and I hope I don't end frustrated again.

I'm the guy that gives callouts when he's died. When I see that a player is far away from the objective, and the timer has 30s left, I tell him that he has 30s left.

The way the defenders killed the other attackers makes it so much better. Ash and Blitz especially rushing through traps is tool real.

I agree. It would be nice to be able to counter a few more ops especially fuze and maverick. I think explosives, sledges hammer and  melee should be the only things that can break the barricade. Also make it quieter when defense tears it down

I mean the original tweet if from March so unless it was posted to Reddit really recently I don't really see an issue with it. I haven't seen it before so it's new content to me. That's why reposts are allowed by Reddit rules. Though I will agree OP should've posted the source and not made a commenter do it.

Just build one instead it would be a lot cheaper

Also if you have a squad you play with or single que
---
aight im bouta fuze the hostage
---
They just keep banning Shield Ops which sucks
---
Could always just bring a frag grenade op. Or any op with explosives for that matter. Most people in ranked stay away from hostage because it's generally where most hackers are so that wouldn't be an issue.
---
Love the death history... and... all in very quick succession. Boy oh boy must've been a depressing sight for Fuze.

Probably a ddos

He feels useless. No hostage

Yes sir. Happens al the time!

It would have been better if you said nothing

wtf

How do you even play a tactical shooter on a game boy? Or was it a different genre?

So he‚Äôs bringing an AR-15 chambered in .22lr? If anything it should be in .300 blackout.

It's recorded from console? Stop thinking that people must play only on PC.

I have a ps4 and a great PC, and I play siege at 144hz because I can since PC supports it of course, and I do enjoy playing on my ps4 occasionally, on the sadly locked 60 or 30 fps depends on the game.

Don't be a "PC MUsTard Race", nobody likes them, appreciate that you could afford a high end rig, while others couldn't or prefer something else.

Thank you

No problem

I don't think that's the problem I live in the USA and people in the same state as me still cause it to crash.
---
On what Device you play?
---
That's too bad. Just gotta get better internet I guess. Playing on console is already a lot slower and everything takes longer to load across the board so whenever someone slows down the game even more they will most likely get kicked
---
who is responsible for it?
---
Oh no pucci is taking the disc from tachanka!
---
as an ex blitz main I am dissapointed that someone playing blitz died to a fucking frost mat. You shouldn't play shield ops if traps can get you

I feel like it's not that people can not  become pro. I believe anyone can become pro at something. So long as you put the hours and practice in to perfect it. Those level 300+ are probably casuals that dont care about ranked, nor do they probably care enough to change what they are doing to better themselves as a player. I just wonder if it's me that's the problem.

Backseat gaming is extremely annoying. Don't be a backseat gamer. And definitely don't use the "Clutch or Kick" ultimatum.

[Y1S4 mid season reinforcements](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/redcrow/reinforcements.aspx) upgraded Tachanka's turret with shield, with the lore reason being that it was created by *"team of engineers led by Elena ‚ÄúMira‚Äù Alvarez Del Manzano"* who wouldn't be released until next season.

[Y2S1 mid season reinforcements](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/velvetshell/reinforcements.aspx) then upgraded Glaz' scope, with the lore reason again being that he received help from *"former Team Rainbow Operator Galanos, who represented Greece"*

So while not actually officially announced, strongly teased and name dropped, yes

Ddosing is actually illegal and can be punished with years of jail.

No it isn't. I have had the game freeze twice in 3 games played and there was for sure nobody ddosing, my internet was still up and running.

Hello Grav_King_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d4nmlp/rainbow_6_siege_video_on_my_channel_rainbow_6/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

idk then lol

I always thought Pulse elite looked the worst.

Lol maybe it means that my best rank projection during placements was gold?

I still haven't seen a single pic of this glitch can someone help me?

I feel like it already does to an extent, I always get autopicked into someone I regularly play fairly often, I‚Äôve only been autopicked into a random op I‚Äôve rarely used maybe 3-5 times. Same goes for my friends.

You‚Äôre super welcome. I love R6 but the community is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen, and veterans can be unforgiving of new players. I try to be as welcoming as possible because I want to see more players get into this game, and not have the same experience I had when I first started playing: the toxicity and confusion literally almost made me quit playing. I had so much anxiety over playing that I‚Äôd have to take breaks to unwind. I wish I‚Äôd had someone to drop me tips without hearing the usual ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù or ‚Äújust go back to Call of Duty.‚Äù This game is my favorite and I‚Äôll never pass up a chance to help someone new fall in love with it. 
---
If you ever need any tips just shoot me a message, for real. Me and my buddies have started taking the game pretty seriously this season and we‚Äôve got tips for just about every map and operator. If you want to win though the ultimate key is this: winning is 75% map knowledge (which I‚Äôll summarize as knowing the layout of the map and how the enemy team is going to play it with the operators they‚Äôve chosen), 20% skill (just raw aim and movement basically), and 5% luck. So the best thing you could be doing to improve your game is to play terrorist hunt to learn the maps really well (seriously, learn them. I know every map as well as I know my own house) and to take notes about every single strategy you see the enemy team run, because 90% of the time the enemy team will be running a meta strategy with their team comp. And play lots of Bomb- it‚Äôs the only game mode that matters
---
For you, you experienced that. Many people are freezing because the game is in a shit state.
---
I played the original RB6 competitively on Mplayer and The Gaming Zone for TFR - The Forgotten Realm.  Was a very fun game, and had some pretty amazing and competitive maps.  Oil Rig, AV to name a couple.  Bad part was on some of the rounds, you could get into a long stalemate.  I remember when we were #1 on the ladders, we had a 45 min round once as it was a 1 on 1, and neither really wanted to peek as the game and the #1 spot was on the line.
---
All in all, was a great experience and one I cherish the memories of.
---
Did u really just straight up steal this
---
I would just fuze myself
---
Why aren‚Äôt they free anymore? Was there a reason?
---
Crashing isn‚Äôt always the fault of the game. Are you sure you have good enough hardware to run it? If you have some parts that on the minimum spec list that may be why. 
---
What‚Äôs the error code? It could be linked to a lack of ram or CPU

This is where the ACOG for Ash, Jager and Bandit went.

I'm torn on whether or not I'd want skins for Mira. On one hand, the elite just came out and I love it, but on the other hand, it could include a vector skin.
---
Didn't expect to find animemes here
---
Mira. Shes more versatile in my opinion due to her being able to hold and create brand new lines of sight. And her Vector is a laser beam

Good use of the English language. How exactly do you think this will help Ubisoft understand the issue to solve?

I have 9-13 ping on pc, but this is us getting ddosed. It happened every season it‚Äôs getting annoying. Ubisoft should sue them but thy don‚Äôt care about us and we don‚Äôt even get our elos back
---
Can‚Äôt turn the screams off. Does your friend play with his volume really loud or something? Just quiet it down or get headphones. Shouldn‚Äôt play siege with speakers anyways.
---
Id say only use flash hider because otherwise vertical recoil is too much
---
I‚Äôve been playing r6 for over 5 seasons, (pretty competitive player) I‚Äôve never crashed this much ever since the update . I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just me since all my friends are experiencing this. But it‚Äôs pretty frustrating when you crash during a rank placement game and get an abandon sanction!
---
I think it's a little too far. I've been playing Monty since the black ice days and nothing has been this tough to play with since before skull rain. (when I think they added shield explosive resistance) The already existing hipfire nerf was good enough imo. Shields have always been fairly defenseless and this combined with the ludicrous hip spread makes them extremely difficult to play, even for me, while though I'm no pro player, I consider myself far better than the average gold. Ideally they'd go back t ok how it was and find alternative ways of doing things.

No since that changes only on rank not Causal nor Unrank

Whenever I'm playing as an attacker my teammates always scold me for not going for the defuser, when I'm just going for the kills which is way easier than planting a defuser with no cover for 30 seconds.

They should match people who have equally high ping, it gets annoying when PC players who have a good ping have to wait on others who don't have good ping.

I think they are struggling with this because they are using the Microsoft servers....but I'm sure  they are working on it !! But still you are right their should be some Fail-Safe for this situation!!

Same here. Could it be GPU driver related? I always get a message saying that my driver is no longer supported when the game starts up.

Had problems with it before the current patch. Now, while the recoil didn't specifically change, the visual animation of the weapon did, it's much easier to see where your shots go while adsing, meaning you can actually aim, so compensator can work really well now, but flash hider is still Superior for the cleanest first few shots, which is all you need to kill a guy.

If my guess is correct, the next elite skin after Ela will be Dokk or Vigil. They have given an elite set to one op per ctu from year 2, except for Dokk or Vigil (And ela, but its confirmed shes getting the next one)
---
So she can't bite people
---
I could not agree more. Also lately, Vigil has been my fav operator so this is incredible. Ubi take my money

The people who bought the exclusive skins had to buy them within a deadline which means that they couldn't buy other things such as operators or bundles just because they had to spend their money or renown on these skins before the deadline

Two questions:
---
Do you have 2fa active?
---
Did you purchase skins with steam wallet funds?
---
Buy operators first . Cosmetics can wait
---
How does it work with new players?
---
You‚Äôre fine, so. Operation Embers Rise is now out. The Vector has an extended barrel that does practically nothing. Kaids AUG got a damage buff. Kanal got reworked and it‚Äôs actually amazing. A lot of gadgets like impact were swapped out for shields and etc. Warden is still kinda bad but not totally garbage now. A new Rank has been added. Reverse friendly fire got some massive changes. And there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff that I can‚Äôt remember that also happened
---
Battlefield 3 had a great campaign, how was it bad?
---
I personally like Mira. If you include custom games, she is very fun to play. Her .45 is nice, her gadget is useful all around, and she can have a shotgun secondary with C4. I am a little biased though.
---
The servers are owned by Microsoft. Ubisoft can‚Äôt really do anything about the servers.

Goyo fire killing the hostage counts as goyo's kill, even if the attacker shoots it :/

Trust me dude, I had the EXACT same issue as you. It was only r6 where I couldn't hear of speak to anyone. What audio drivers do you have?
---
I can kick ass with the LMG-12, thank you very much.

You cannot play during  A ddos attack.
---
You can outskill a mkb user with a controller. You might not want to admit it but people have been practicing with these controllers for 10+ years and know how to use them despite their shortcomings.
---
Even if you use a mkb device on console if you‚Äôre shit at using it you‚Äôre not going to do any better than before.
---
I was wondering that too. It looks really cool, what is it anybody?

I really like the kanals rework its not s\*\*t like some others :I

Does she though? Her recoil is one of the easiest to control. Slap that on bucks shitshow of an AR and maybe...that thing hits like a train don't get me wrong but fuck me if it doesn't break your wrist doing it.
---
I don't have 2fa active, but only for few days, and I did not buy any skins.
---
Shit, you can outskill a hacker but that doesn‚Äôt change anything about whether or not it‚Äôs unfair. Just google kinggeorge or pengu beating hackers.
---
And you‚Äôre crazy if you think that a competent controller user could compete with a competent m+kB player. It‚Äôs just easier to aim accurately and quickly on a mouse.
---
Go in a custom game and change the settings to the suitable conditions. Once you are in, run around the whole map while looking at the compass. Every room you are in it will show you the call out (although some maps have a popular call out that people use and the compass won‚Äôt show it). When you run around the map, say the room call outs out loud. I‚Äôve done this to the new maps in one run and immediately knew the whole maps after that.

If you have a second monitor, having the map open on maps.r6guides.com on your second monitor can help you get the maps and room names memorized faster. It‚Äôs also helpful to go in to a custom game and go around the whole map learning it whenever a new or reworked map comes out. Obviously going to be tougher to get them memorized when you‚Äôre trying to work on all at once instead of just one new one, maybe focus on getting one down at a time if you think that‚Äôll work better for you.

So awesome!

ye, once in a year...

I guess they brushed her up because of faces Pilot Programm skin but I hope for a Zofia elite soon
---
I think the smg should be buffed slightly and the shotgun nerfed slightly just to balance her loadout. And the fact that it‚Äôs a very annoying gun to go up against when it‚Äôs so random.

Thanks man, I have never been a harcore anime guy as I only watch Pokemon my whole life, but sometimes I hear about this animes that look very interesting and I just need to watch them. Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagan are two of the other animes I have watched besides Pokemon and I love them.
---
I‚Äôd say like 6 or 7. The crossshair placement was off on the second kill and the fact that this is the clip you chose to share and it isn‚Äôt even consistent in this clip tells me it probably isn‚Äôt consistent overall.
---
Just to be clear I‚Äôm not shitting on you or anything, just trying to give an honest rating. I wouldn‚Äôt rate myself any higher and need to get more consistent myself, been working on it a lot.
---
Edit: If you deliberately chose a clip that was average and had some good some bad rather than choosing a clip you felt was really good, then I‚Äôd probably bump it up to like 7 or maybe 8.
---
I destroy them like that... but sometimes it doesn't work and still destroys the shield, also some players just shoot the drone because they don't know :S
---
Why? Because (outside of OF: Dragon Rising) AI‚Äôs don‚Äôt intentionally try to teamkill.
---
Sorry xbox one

hence me saying "sometimes". it most situations it isn't. The whole round leading up to this I only heard them on those windows, so I stuck the angle.
---
I noticed that the instant I saw it
---
I know
---
If you're relying on the prisma to trick players, you're probably using her wrong. Use them to cover windows and entry points, forcing attackers to either shoot and reveal their position, or take the time to find an angle to shoot the gadget, distracting them from you sneaking up behind them.

Ngl, her main use is the AA12 anyway.

Ah yes someone else has discovered it.

---
Yeah but the skill disparity is massive it's not fair for some golds to lose mmr because of an unlucky matchmaking and for some plats to win MMR because of an fortuitous match making.
---
Like the performance of the golds may make them the best out of the Gold 3 players but having mmr lowered because they faced a whole team of plats
---
Same goes for the plats their skill may make them some of the worst plat 2s but because of some lucky matchmaking they get a boost in mmr
---
For example, a while back I played a solo game with 4 guys at silvers and we were against a team of 4 coopers and a single gold 1 the guy at gold 1 tore us a new ass.
---
Situations are the campaign
---
Ayy lets go weebs
---
Got the same thing and uploaded it. Thought it was a random face bug but it seems to break consistently the same way. Boolin ass spaghetti code
---
I am hoping it works by taking your mmr and "freezing" it so that whatever rank you are, you will play against corresponding players, but won't gain or lose any mmr when you win or lose, so you can essentially just practice against people you would normally face in ranked, Without any consequences.

The bullets come out of the slim end, mate

That's what the green stuff he has on him is, it's fire-proof serum that he also passes around to his teammates so they're not affected by the gadget either

Meh, i never really liked it. Reminded me of the mpx too much. And yeah, the AA12 has a low af RPM, but it has like 40 rounds to dump on people, which is always fun.

I've been told to watch it by my coworkers because apparently I bear a striking resemblance to the professor. Looks like I'll have to give it a go

Agreed Ubi are hardly EA.

If you want to gamble on the worst recoil on a primary yes 
---
If you hate yourself add a suppressor to do even less damage

100% getting these. La Casa de Papel is a fantastic show.

I think the problem is less about aiming better and more about people running the Italia shotgun

I like it, hate joining ongoing and the time before i can exit again takes forever.

Its ping based. If you have lower ping you join the lobby first, and blue is the first team to get filled, so you're on blue team

---
Fuze

Her guns are honestly pretty good and her gadget can be used in a lot of different ways . Like for example you can place a hologram outside as soon as a round starts and for the attacker it shows up as ‚Äúidentity hidden‚Äù so they assume it‚Äôs an actual defender and shoot at it when it‚Äôs only a hologram . As well I‚Äôve seen people hid behind cover and have a hologram at where they are peeking at so when an attacker misses it shoots the prisma and gives away their location .

IQ mains want him to keep his hands away
---
Shot a downed player and made him bleed earlier.
---
And legitimately shot a gridlock 4 times with hibana‚Äôs primary at close range ( no finka)
---
Shit feels weird to be honest
---
*EXTRA THICC*
---
Tf are they supposed to do?
---
I've always thought 5 random maps from the ranked pool should appear and each team bans 2

Hello IHype25, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d4r4x2/new_glitch_while_playing_sledge_myers/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Firstly keep your distance a single mele will be your death, secondly don't be afraid to be aggressive alos communication helps massively but you can play her without its just guessing the best time to play aggressive.
---
And que ‚ÄúE-sports Ready‚Äù comment
---
No
---
It‚Äôs a shame that a massive company like Ubisoft can‚Äôt do things better
---
Share &gt; square &gt; trim video &gt; copy to usb or upload to youtube.
---
Holy fuck he is annoying.
---
How do you add your main to your name
---
You should be complaining about Microsoft, not ubi. They‚Äôre the only ones that can stop m+kb and DDOSing
---
Honestly this whole game should just be removed. Back to the drawing boards bc ubi ain‚Äôt got no clue what they doingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
shield operators. if for no other reason than making pick and ban interesting because at least 2 bans are going to be shield operators, one of the other two is going to be Echo, and the 4th ban is whoever. all this makes the game have less unpredictability. no matter what the bomb site, you know exactly how its going to unfold. if so many people werent so uncomfortable with facing shield operators, then different operators would get banned and that would make more rounds unpredictable and interesting.
---
They're not saying anything because there's nothing they can do.  Ubisoft rents the the servers. The DDOS problem is out of their hands.  They said in July they had a team dedicated to looking at the problem and seeing if they could solve it.
---
Jesus your aim confuses me
---
Oh the memory of acog bandit 50/50ing across the map on Kanal. Would go bottom garage and shoot down the docks. Good times...
---
I love chalet
---
Can you give me a reason why you think he should have one or are you just gonna be a snobby little cunt the entire time?
---
Blackbeard's. I love the Vietnam uniform look.
---
Do you have to verify who you are if you want to play Real Sports yes or no
---
I mean it said you would kill em
---
Edit nvm I just watched it like 10 times and I noticed it didn‚Äôt even say it til after
---
***KOREGA REQUIEM DA***
---
Wow you are officially a moron. Please go back to school. Or an insane asylum haha.
---
This isnt a fucking real sport now is it
---
i was fucking around with the enemy team once on fortress. accidentally knocked myself and one other off the satellite tower, but one of them hit the corner post and didn't fly off.
---
Yeah but they just took away a bunch of impacts and then shields would be god tier and close range
---
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The red and black uniform with the tan Stetson hat and he rides in on a damn black horse looking all majestic af.
---
Oh boi

Mormon*
---
Do NOT disrespect my religion.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a post recently that had an excerpt about how Ying once got pretty violent with Fuze because she believed his methods were too haphazard, and that Ash had to step in to calm her down?
---
My man, do you need help? Someone who is rude to others with literally no reason at all does not have everything together somewhere dude
---
Well aren‚Äôt we both disrespecting it by using technology and electricity??
---
Still waiting
---
I was speaking the truth. Maybe you need a nice 500 milligram dose of the back of my hand to your cheek.
---
Sounds bent.
---
He will he available next week for non season pass holders
---
THERE HE GOES AGAIN.....GODDAMN MAE....I SALUTE YOU
---
Amish*
---
That's not his point, and furthermore that's not true at all.
---
Plenty of ppl use controller in plats. My whole team uses controller in plat. Scums use mnk
---
cmon now, did the guy mean harm to you? he was just making a fucking joke bro chill out
---
Yeah no problem dude, you can watch mine to compare, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hFqUHsHgXcY. Yours is just much more aligned and well made. Don‚Äôt stop creating these man
---
Enjoy your common duplicate!
---
You know what you‚Äôre right I feel stupid
---
Euh no.
---
I assume by this wednesday, is his gadget useful? What I noticed was that he had a Vector with 2 speed, sounds insane if there wasn't a nerf to that gun yet.
---
You don‚Äôt
---
You either don‚Äôt know much about the white masks or you have no imagination
---
a week after they are released, so this wednesday
---
Okay address the other points then
---
They won't bring back last years halloween packs.
---
Do you know how many packs last event had? 22. This years halloween event will also have up to 30 packs as up to 30 halloween cosmetics have been leaked. We would be at the same amount of packs like Operation Chimera had,even slightly more. Which means also slightly more expensive. No one would want this and Ubi already had a lot of hate with the outbreak/chimera packs being so many and so expensive.
---
Most players will also hate it as they want the newer,better looking skins but will have a high chance of getting the old pack skins and ending up disappointed.
---
Plus,they said they want the packs to be limited time only cosmetics. Meaning if you didn't get the Ash Black Viper elite in Chimera or during Year 3(Digital downloads gave you 10 free packs),then you never had the chance to get Black Viper Elite. 
---
It's the same with SunSplash and last years Crimsonveil Packs. Rainbow is Magic,Showdown. Limited time only cosmetics,if you didn't get the stuff back then,then you wouldn't get them ever again.
---
The leaked halloween cosmetics for this year are already up to 50-60 bucks of Rainbow6 credits. Up to 60 bucks to get all ~30 items.
---
Add the old packs and players who want to get the stuff they want have to gamble up to ~100 bucks.
---
Nah man 100% straight
---
I know. But you make it sound like everyone has that or a similar opinion.
---
i mean it‚Äôs your first post so i‚Äôll ignore the flaws, have an upvote, also how did you post this since you play xbox. i‚Äôm curious because i want to start posting things in decent quality
---
sounds like that's your problem 100%
---
she likes it, and jackal can probably smell it
---
Yeah of course
---
Ohhhh that explains a lot, yeah I don‚Äôt play a lot of t hunt. I only play it before ranked to adjust my sensivity
---
i nutted
---
What?
---
I mean yeah but I wouldn't purposefully leave my team
---
lol
---
Do I really have to write out that it‚Äôs implied in a figurative way.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not the good but last night the game was running smoothly for me and my friends then like the third match my whole team started lagging but the other team wasn‚Äôt. We definitely got lag spiked. We still won though bc they thought they had a chance and stopped it
---
This was posted a few weeks ago. At least credit the artist, ya dingus.
---
How did none of you notice that? It's so blatant. Maybe I just got a bunch of them and couldn't unsee it.
---
watch youtube videos honestly
---
On what specifically?
---
I feel that. I‚Äôm a Gold 2 but it‚Äôs been like 24 weeks since I last played a casual match where I wasn‚Äôt facing at least 2 or more Plats or Diamonds who just *really* don‚Äôt wanna lose
---
Buck off
---
Step 1 pick blitz 
---
Step 2 rush into sight 
---
Step 3 middle mouse than v
---
Step 4 profit
---
Step 5 buy elite for extra skill
---
Watch coconut brah he has some great tips and tricks
---
Thicklock was without a doubt my best op last  season and the main reason i hit plat. She helps cut off rotations and can be useful covering the bomb.
---
Amaru is fun in any game mode if you know how to use her O_o
---
I like blitz but damn the face you see in the art looks nothing like the character model.
---
So cute! And looks way better than the chibi from Ubisoft
---
Blitz = best op
---
