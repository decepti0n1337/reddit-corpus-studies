---
Glad other people thought the same thing as me
---
Alt+F4
---
Good idea but I suggest a general area like 20 meter area around the jewel also people could prob hide it under a reinforced hatch or in a reinforced wall
---
Forgive me but what do you mean by fluff
---
Nah ur texting doc hun i seen you and him ;) how he's scared of you how you took Control of that suave french man
---
I showed u my fiery torch please respond
---
Nice shot!
---
разумный.  Я пытаюсь выучить русский язык.
---
No that would be glitching, I would hope Ubisoft has learned their lesson after what players use to do with the defuser in BOMB from the original seasons lol.
---
How  ?
---
I meant main, not name. Oops
---
Yea, I won 1 match in the past month and woke up yesterday to lose all the elo from it and now I’m both angry and even more depressed
---
[removed]
---
Yes it it bad, don't play hostage it sucks
---
no
---
Tachanka will always stand by you.
---
Lol
---
why tho? I feel like it's just a bandwagon thing cus a pro said it once or something
---
I don't know man.
---
Can I ask why?
---
For which one
---
I know
---
Depends.
---

---
Jackal is good for making the target you're tracking down nervous. Also has a shotty secondary for hatches and a big rifle or smg.
---
Sledge is a buff boi with a sledgehammer. A one man army. With frags. Must I go on?
---
My doggidy dowg. I wuld frilking cclap cheeks after cheeks if that wer a thing.
---
None of them have an AR
---
Maybe I’m just stupid but why exactly is it wrong to give a defender an AR?
---
Omg, 烏龍派出所!
---
Jager much??
---
She is fine as is.
---
She is still a almost must pick other than rooms with external walls where thermite is a better pick. She is a highly picked operator in both normal play and ProL. 
---
Her type89 is till one of the higher firerate guns on attack and was good amount of dmg if you dont spray your whole mag randomly. 
---
Losing the claymore is rough but the addition of breach charges made her a one girl breach team. I dont see her getting any buffs.
---
Heck yeah, like a $30 eight person league or something of the sort
---
It’s not just my point of view, it’s also Microsoft’s, Ubisoft’s, and the majority of console players point of view too. If a player really wants to use mouse and keyboard because that’s their preferred device then they’re more than welcome to play the PC version of the game where that’s the standard. The bottom line is that if it was supported then Ubisoft would allow official support like the fortnite and Minecraft devs do. There’s a reason you need a third party adapter to trick your console into thinking you’re using a controller. If it was allowed then they would allow it, end of discussion.
---
Theres something called cameras
---
Why can’t the launcher by under barrel? That’s how the company made it
---
I mean entirely up to stats but the basic idea is that an AR could outclass an smg in range and in damage. 
---
I mean Jäger has a rifle but it's more classified as a Carbine. And Vigil has a rifle but it's listed as an smg. And Mozzie's "rifle" uses 9mm.
---
But I doubt a Defender would get an actual normal rifle that uses rifle rounds.
---
repost
---
The average rank is around gold 3/4. Gold is massively overpopulated cause thats where you start and its hard to be placed outside of it, so everyone playing just their 10 placements is Gold.
---
yes I know it isn't perfect :)
---
Did some else post it here?
---
哈哈對啊兩津勘吉

you're the first one to get the reference congrats

Operation die every round on defense.
---
mw2 noobtube?
---
You think it could be done?
---
Hey big head
---
What's your role?
---
Locking down sites and acog? Echo.
---
Literally soft roam/lurk? Lesion. Doc. Rook. Pretty much any Op that can place down gadgets in one life without having to charge one (aka Lesion.)
---
Wanna roam?
---
Ela. Jäger. Bandit. Kapkan. Vigil. Caveira.
---
Honestly though you could bunker down or roam with any op in the gsme but depends on your playstyle and role to the game.
---
A normal dust mask will not stop chemical gas. There are different ratings masks.
---
Ah, a man of culture as well.
---
Check if ur tight enough
---
Let me introduce you to one of my friend who is now Lv700+ and has 4000+hrs of THunt on him... I myself am Lv400+ and have 1000+hrs too. Our renown rack up fast as well, though we've already bought what we consider useful already. Glad that there's still Alpha Packs.
---
There are true THunters like us, rare but there.
---
The velvet shell skins were by far the best
---
i mean i got placed in bronze , u have to win 5 lose 5 to get that. I hate how the mmr system in this game works at the start, you basically go up and down a rank for each win loss. I went down almost to copper 1 last season because i lost 7 games in a row after placement, and i carried my weight pretty much every game. But youre right about the placemebt thing, a lot of my friends who dont play ranked just did placements and are sitting in gold, and they barely play siege and dont even know half of the maps. Probably have the gamesense of a silver, i really wish they factored in how you perform in games into rank as well, i get that its a team game but 100% win loss for rank is dumb
---
Personally and I’ve talked with others on this, another grenade launcher would be kinda lazy character design on Ubi’s part and wouldn’t hurt to be more creative with the gadget
---
Its a nerf to cav
---
damn ture legends that dont care about the blanceing of pvp ops lol
---
so lion not broken?
---
Wallet Warriors
---
But isn't like any other operation screaming what they are doing?!
---
I used to wait till mid week so the try hards got theirs and the weekend warriors weren't on yet.
---
EAVN BRADDOCK
---
Is it bad i can hear mozzie saying this
---
"tachanka they keep nerfing my turret I don't know what to do!"
---
"Mount your lmg"
---
"What, that doesn't have anything to do wi-"
---
"*MOUNT. YOUR. LMG*
---
This was a casual game, my mmr is around plat 3 so idk id that applies in casual.
---
This is really cool? Their abilities sound great and i wanna try that shot gun so badly lol
---
Shoot his legs? I can't be the only one who thinks Blitz is pretty reasonable to deal with.
---
Fucking hackers
---
Thanks a ton!
---
My first time meeting a youtuber though so im pretty content with it!
---
Almost did this exact thing with Kapkan. The 5th guy killed me, this was on my first day of owning the game too, I was so mad
---
They obviously mean it in the sense that cosmetics from challenges are obtainable by all.
---
I just never enjoyed the map, I don't like maps on the smaller side they feel very cramped. Also the lack of breachable walls makes it annoying to enter, since the only options are windows or hatches.
---
When you have Adrenal Surge active you hear your blood pumping through your ears really loudly and it covers up other stuff.
---
My man asking the real questions
---
I see what you did
---
They could make ones that work to encourage certain *types* of operator that are related. 
---
E.g for Frost, Kapkan amd other Trap operators birthdays "Use 15 Trap gadgets" (EDD,  Welcome Mat, Various mines,  smokes things,  etc,  maybe even nitro cells)
---
E.g for Pulse or Dokkaibi "Mark 20 enemies"
---
Etc
---
Well if you want to learn maps just use custom match making, it should help
---
I showed you my mines please respond
---
his ranked kd was 18
---
Meep

Scum of the earth

Yeah, me and my friends recently played with some of them. God damn pussies.

Lmao why are people bad? Just click their head

This isnt just xbox, it happens on PC and PlayStation. Unfortunately people just think the other people are just bots or something, not real people
---
Now that’s just DaNk
---
I showed you what I saw last night, pants down, please respond
---
There should be like a three second counter between pressing leave and actually leaving
---
If you someone is TKing
---
You are the type of person that gets knifed for one of these montages.
---
According to the mechanics of the game, every audio from any gadget will be heard from both teams. Yes, there are thing in game that doesn't make sense, but there are also rules, such as how the propagation of sound works in the game.
---
imagine seeing shit like that on RED tho
---
F
---
You have to play ash without acog now
---
Is that what it is? I wonder if it was that or the "activation" sound
---
Looks good, probably the m1 could be changed but that’s just my opinion.
---
I’m not trying to hate but the icons need some work. Overall really good ideas though
---
See, I have this problem too. Not only toxic players, but fucking squeakers as well. It's on it's way to becoming CoD. I do this when I play CoD, and I'm gonna start doing this on Siege too if it gets even more out of hand. I threaten to track their fucking location.(Quite possible, given the right programs and equipment. I'm working on getting a device that will trace the signal of everyone in the match and give me their location. Probably illegal but it's worth it to get them to stfu) Usually that shuts them up, and if not, well, the mute button exists. I can't wait for the day where some idiot starts being toxic and I can go basically tell him to stfu, because I know that he lives in XYZ state/country. Also I swear that gaming companies need to do something about squeakers. Too young and toxic as fuck
---
How to make it all black ice and elite skins teamkill hibana

wait til you see Instagram

Tsar bomba
---
I will main any future operator who would have MTAR ( or TAR, doesn’t matter)
---
It’s N E R F or nothin
---
Damn. I forgot to say "no homo". I guess that was gay then. BRB,Im going to Fuze myself in the bathroom.
---
Somehow I've been killed by headshot shot directly throught the shield lately.
---
have the sun explode
---
is that a sneaker
---
Shields are legit broken as hell right now man
---
They are a requirement in shotguns, not super worth on anything else
---
Agreed. I can clear House on solo THunt using Bearing 9 and tap fire, but the recoild is just ridiculous in real multiplayer. From most picked to least picked.
---
Switched to the other breaching operators insead.
---
A fellow chanka main?
---
And because hes fun, not just for memes?
---
Uno
---
I can live with that. She looks hentai enough now.
---
no because people would purposely throw in casual or ranked to get legendaries. they’re free cosmetics. be glad you get anything
---
Damn is that how many kangaroos ya have mate. Ya only have a little more then me. But do you have some wombats didn’t think so.
---
If you are hiding the laser behind a wall, that means you're not holding an angle. Direct disadvantage.
---
Lmao the way you desperately search to find the last kill just gets me
---
https://what-if.xkcd.com/140/
---
The concept is nice but Bulldog might breed some new cancer strat wherein he's with someone like Ying or Blitz. One thing to mitigate this though is that his teammates also get affected by the tear gas like how Smoke is immune while literally everyone else isn't.
---
Shockwave's ability is great but it's a double edged sword. It can benefit either the attackers or the defenders depending on the situation.
---
I love this sub so much for all the fan made operation DLC’s, to me it’s the coolest part of the Siege Community. Thanks for another great concept OP!
---
as thatcher, help thermite :(
---
Get a full fucking team, honestly not that hard. I found a finnish discord for siege after playing 1 week of siege by my self, now I have hundreds of other people who are willing to play with me. As usual, cunts exist everywhere, so this shit happens. Thats why you always get a 5 stack when you play
---
Good one to get it on too.
---
The teargas seems to much like smoke or capitoa but shockwaves seems like hed be an amazing operator. Great idea man
---
Try out the GIGN shotgun with a laser on it, that thing can kill people on the other side of the floor if you got a good shot. 
---
Also you might know this already but for new players, adding a laser into a shotgun reduces the spread, ADSing reduces it more. Yeah gamebalacing &gt; logic.

Mozzie busting a nut to all that renown

Finkanka*
---
Avoid the G8A1. Commando is definitely the best one but AUG may suit some others better like me
---
did u make this?
---
Keep in mind, Blitz is one of the loudest and noisiest operators when moving, and you cant hear his stomping and shield clanking when youre behind a thin barricade.
---
Optics like the red dot is just ridiculous to use, its too big and bulky, as if its not using a reflective light instead just marked a red dot in the middle
---
Same goes with iron sights, in most guns, the front sight is way too big and it blocks everything on front of you, hell, you cant even know where the bullet is supposed to land since, again, the front sight is too big.
---
Sure, you can like siege, i like siege too, but the game feels buggy with "innovative" sound, which is buggy anyways, and the guns arent usually reliable when it comes to certain sights.
---
I should you my Mounted LMG pleas respond
---
Damn bro, no need to be harsh, I just feel like OP didn’t know
---
Gimp!
---
Not being harsh, more of an "oh, for real?"
---
Why not both?
---
I don’t know if you played COD Black Ops back in the day. Remember that equipment you could throw that would sound like gunfire and show on the radar in CoD? Would it be something like that? Or placeable like a Mute jammer?
---
Idea for shockwave: Make the sound her gadget makes contextual and make it a throwable. If you stick it to a roof it makes it a bassy footstep sound like someone's above you. If you place it on the floor it makes a regular footstep sound. If you place it on a wall it makes the sound as if you're meleeing a wall.
---
I found Mozzie!
---
Maverick Main?
---
You realize mouse and keyboard doesn’t work out of the box on the PS4 version right. You still need to use a third party adapter for that version as well. There is no official support on any console version for mouse and keyboard which makes your argument invalid. Ubisoft could easilier turn on official support for it since it’s their decision and they consider it cheating(their words, not mine) which is why we haven’t seen official support for the console versions and never will.
---
Did you just take a screenshot of another Reddit post and post it again?
---
Oh my bad. I thought you had a sarcastic intent.
---
What about Frost, Lesion and Gridlock?
---
How is it a bad weapon
---
I do realize it does work out of the box. I don't even know why you think otherwise. No third party adapter needed.
---
Okay, I've come up with a way it would make sense. The decoy radio would generate its sounds based on a private cryptographic key known only to the defenders (similar to how security tokens work). The defenders' earpieces would use this key to determine what sounds the decoy is playing in real time, and play back synchronised destructive interference to cancel out the decoy sounds à la noise cancelling headphones.
---
Jager is king
---
I gotta give it to ya OP this is one helluva an idea. I love it, it has a very urban vibe us Americans will get a feel of familiarity. The ability i think could be changed just a tad but that idea is probably the best i’ve seen yet!
---
The best part is when you play Mute and put a jammer by a door and then Bandit decides it's a good idea to put barbed wire down on top of the jammer and electrocute it without telling you. Dick.
---
Also going to point out that all of these primary weapons are used by another operator: Maverick has the M4 Carbine; Mozzie has the RO635, known to him as the Commando 9, and the Remington Model 870- GSG9
---
hehehe, thermie looks at IQ rule 34
---
Recruit
---
Slow rof, meh damage
---
No i didn’t the guys watermark is in the picture i can’t read it though
---
No i made it with the photo collage app
---
Don't want it to be impossible is the issue, could be overpowered if you couldn't locate the sources, you know?
---
Too many Americans in the game already
---
Maintenance update. Probably something very internal.
---
IM SORRY
---
mp5 for mute, but i use the shotgun
---
Also SMG-11 has even the SMG in the name... How does that make sense?
---
Wondering the same thing. Things feel really off to me all of a sudden. Specifically hit reg and audio from people sprinting not playing. Everything was working super well before this mini patch...
---
One of the top CTUs globally, also really want to have a claustrophobic map, skyscrapers and all. Very few cities that can manage. I'm also a New Yorker haha
---
I mean smoke haha
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
I think these are those secret updates where they change few stuff... Like few days ago i found out we no longer can hop up on the machine near window in front of garage door on Outback map...
---
Repost
---
Think of it's deployment similar to a valk cam!
---
A few days ago it seemed like a hatch blew in front of me but it was behind me. Good sound direction lolz
---
Bulldog would spread gradually, steps of five or something
---
But a static source of footsteps isnt gonna fool anyone. Maybe it just goes on a straight line until it hits something?
---
Seasonal skins are pretty trash since white noise
---
Yes would certainly need better design, imagine the floor similar to Bank's atrium!
---
You have described my exact vision hahaha
---
Mw3 and mw2 are two different eras buddy. Dont  come in here if you dont even know what your talking about
---
I'm with you, but for purpose of mass appeal would be more simple to umbrella it. It's all still "NYPD" and under a far more recognized brand, but I absolutely agree. The woman in the photo is ESU as a matter of fact!
---
I would get fooled personally, especially on the floor above me!
---
Thank you :D
---
That was a older update not a hidden change.
---
What do you need it for, may I ask?
---
I might have missed it in patch notes then...
---
This pleases the cav main I am
---
No it's separate from that. I don't know what it is either, on PS4. It kinda messed things up for me like hit reg and audio from players sprinting.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Wish you the best on your next match!
---
Those are my plates take good care of them 😁
---
I’m a level 108 and still have no black ice or it just got lost cause I prob didn’t have the op unlock at the time.
---
Oh okay. That‘s nice, дружище, give me a shout if you need any help in the future
---
Whoever your better as playing. I meet jagers that would place them around the hostage. I ended up shooting them and be got tked for shooting me. Fuze killed the hostage. Yea he got banned for tking 3 of us lol. But easy ranked after he left. Fire arrow on the hostage and his teammate.  This is why play people your good with and know how to play.
---
I fully think that just being friendly is the best easy to go about this m, I have made countless friends in siege by doing this, whom are really nice as well. And people like us are helping siege’s toxicity one step at a time. But like any game there will always be toxic people
---
Even a destroyed cam can give you Intel though.
---
They see me coastin'

Repostin'

Ha Someone watched a dank ass movie

They call it bugisoft for a reason I guess

Congratulations

You are being rescued.

Большое спасибо.  :D
---
I've always experiences this input lag in the customization menù, I thought it was normal
---
Tell me about it, lion be so shit now
---
Are you paying?
---
What strategies did you implement in order to get to platinum from where you were before? I’m bad at siege and I’m trying to improve.
---
My stuff always lags, thought it was just me
---
The recoil is pretty hard to control (or at least for me as a silver 2) without muzzle brake and even with it makes it just tolerable. Also, maestro doesn’t have as much of a fragging aspect on most rounds as much as an intel aspect since his cameras require him to be on his phone.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
For a dollar
---
I do have lags as well and the reason has to be the game itself cause I’m playing on an high end pc with a pretty good connection as well.
---
This has been here a million times. Putting two of those posts together won't double the chances of it being included
---
Just buy the season pass and Safe up to 90k to get the diamond skin
---
I am unaware of any auditory effects but I’m spretty sure Hibana pellets can bounce of the anchor of a reinforced wall so it may be to make hibana’s life harder
---
i showed you my CCE please respond
---
Well I was doing it on the side but it took ages to go onto every operator and equip a skin + charm on all their guns. Probably exaggerated but still
---
but i am broke
---
Simple but balanced. Both operators have counters from other operators which allows counter strating etc. The most balanced operator ideas I’ve seen on this Reddit in a while (I’ve seen archers, stealth assassins and a bunch of other broken op ideas). 
---
My only concern is the current sound issues siege faces, that would definitely have to be fixed before implementation.
---
Anyways nice idea, good work!
---
You forgot the most powerful ones:Jackal PDW9
---
#T H I C C
---
yes i had
---
As my friend would say a big fucking hole, coming right up
---
Tell me if you find it.
---
Ya thats what we need, more american operators!
---
The year was 1809 and the first meme settlers were going out west to discover what memes lay in this unknown land. Soon towns sprung up all across the meme-lands each farming different memes, some doge, some cat text even a few bad luck gingers but the largest and the oldest was the town of video game memes and in the town hall they have a copy of each and every meme mined there and this one is located so far back in the hall of memes you’d have to get 100 cows to feed your family and half of you would die of dysentery on the way there
---
tldr: it old bitch
---
I posted this but why did mine get tooken down?
---
I'm not saying it is bullshit, I'm saying it **looks** bullshit, hence the analogy (a bad one I know but was the first thing that came to my head)
---
My point was, even if the kills are 100% legit, they need to reflect that in the killcam, because I'm not going to believe it unless I see it that way.
---
Flashback to T-Hunt in Vegas 2 and the Spaz-12 jumpscares
---
dotpict :D
---
Miss the time when you were able to buy the black ice bundle and the glacier PL skin...
---
doesnt it need 2 rounds of pallets for a hatch now?
---
Miss that time as well especially at that time I thought who tf spends money on skins... I’m regretting it so hard
---
oooh that's exciting
---
No they just fixed the alignment of them. But I feel like it’s become easier to impact trick them in the last couple patches
---
Yea, I've been matchmaked yesterday with someone that had that old skins, they are so cool compared to the new one...
---
SURPRISE COCKFAG
---
I love the looks of the old Proleague skin and the old team skins as well it’s a shame you can’t get them now even if they would make them much more expensive I still would buy them I guess
---
Like what app it’s amazing
---
Team killing a friend like this would be funny but I wouldn't do it with randoms
---
What about the One World Trade Center as a map?
---
Enemy scan Inbound, starting the timer
---
Pouit Pouit pouit
---
POOOOOUUUUUUS
---
Edited it! that was not the intention. thanks!
---
This is a really neat app and I'm sure it took an absolute ton of effort. Good work.
---
Just one question. Why? What purpose does it serve to know what ranks they are? You're stuck with them anyways. And I've seen more than once where there's a team of Plats being carried by a Bronze or Silver. I know you've made this app because people want to know this information, but why do people want to know this information?
---
Very interesting app. will test it when i'm back from work
---
I'm ok with it. If I get spawnpeeked, regardless of the game mode, I know I f**Ked up. Even in casual.
---
Yep. This one's on me.
---
Ooh good one will keep that in mind
---
They are good but i think that one should have a different weapon other than the remington such as another assault rifle or even an Smg
---
Why is it there?
---
Then you shoot his hand, I feel like we've already gone over this
---
The best excuse I have is "my finger slipped" while in killcam, he's aiming in my head
---
I used to be top 100 on ps4 pretty consistently
---
No problem
---
I think they have better aim yeah
---
As I get it from the vid mozzie firstly shot ela and downed her to defuze the defuzer himself.
---
What I don't get is how ela can get up from dbno? I thought it was zofia's exclusive ability.
---
You'll still be over adjusting some of the time
---
I rarely ever play jackal, when I do I play his C7E
---
Perfect amount of thiccness
---
To team up with others does make the overall experience better but I doubt that you will get a better player just by that. You have to put a lot of effort in. maybe you know someone who is more skilled than u are who will show you strategies and stuff (u can also watch proleague on twitch)
---
Diamond skin is overrated

Name checks out... kinda

Go try it,With Focking laser sight is legit P90 from CSGO

Never! Tin foil 4 ever

I was talking to the randoms loads, we were all laughing about it DW. Funny thing is my ela mine stopped him defusing like an echo shot, that's all aha.
---
My main is 25 years older than yours!
---
I do oppose you!
---
Never played CSGO, but contextually I can tell you mean godlike
---
I dont get the point of the guy, but i see potential in the girl. However, the noise making device should be consumable by everyone in the team, so something like rooks armor but in this case it would be the noise making device.
---
Can someone explain the purpose of shokwaves ability?
---
Yes, I sadly don't have anyone to play with. I just thought it would be easier to understand the game if you play with someone, who kinda knows what's the game about.
---
I really like the idea of both of those operators. Adding the new guns is cool and all but I think with the most recent defense operator, mozzie, having an AR I find it unlikely that the next defence operator is going to have an AR. But really I absolutely love the idea of their abilities and the map.
---
Great app! Just tried it out with a screenshot I caught in March as I don't have the hardware rn for launching the game, 9 out of 10 general recognition, 7 out of 10 accurate recognition. However there're some problems with 'el' to 'd', '100' to 'IOO', 'on' to 'm' and can't recognize a player with name like 'X\_X\_X\_X\_X\_X'(X=any capitalized alphabet), I understand the font of R6S is a bit strange so am not really bothered with these..
---
Overall it's a fantastic job done!! Thanks a lot, will definitely consider the upgrade and introduce this app to my friends!!!
---
I've heard this a lot, and I think it would really punish those people who really do want to play with a lower/higher ranked friend. If there is so much boosting, why not just match them up against similarly stacked squads?
---
Pay 2 Win squad
---
She is caveira, not caviera -_-
---
Oooooh! That is horrible cheat.
---
i- we don't speak about that

Everytime I look at it the only thing I see is Raticate from Pokemon lol

If you want u can add me (The_Wolvegang) and we could team up sometime.

Sure we can team up, if that's okay with you. I'll also check out the discord server!

Just to piss you off

Idk man the highest I got was plat 2 but I really need a team that can actually communicate. Got a lot more potential if that were the case. Tag me in if you find some people and you're a man down

Ubisoft take notes
---
Two challenges that i've always thought were a good idea, would be
---
1. Silenced weapon challenges (can be done with any operator)
---
2. LMG and DMR challenges, as they are currently lumped under "rifle" challenges
---
What? In your example you would eventually be at 3950 because those two losses are gone. You literally described how the system works. The games you won counted and the other two technically won’t exist.
---
The best change imo is like the maestro evil eye.

The glass need to be really bulletproof so when the lord want to shoot, the glass go down to make him unprotected. He will have two role, as intel gathering and entry denyal.

Excuse me what

This^ people aren’t understanding that capping the fix is still a loss of elo
---
Then you didn't only play full stacks
---
that was extremely underwhelming.

Tachanka for the memes. Otherwise I'd suggest Lesion or Mira

Then level up or play newcomers. No need for the insult, buddy.

You must’ve beaten a cheater. They take elo if you beat them as well, which is stupid but Ubisoft is Ubisoft.

And you're assuming they've done this wrong

On the Year Pass questions during the Census; Year 3 it still says “Do you own the Year 3 Pass”.
---
Also I think it would be a good idea to divide the “How well do you think Siege is balanced at the moment” question (the one in which the top option is “Perfect or near perfect”; into 2: “How balanced do you think the operator roster is” and “How balanced do you think the game is overall (Attack-sided, Defense-sided; maps).

You cannot have been punished while both only playing with full stacks and yet having none of the people you played with punished.

Oh that makes sense,there was a game in which one guy was suspisous. It could be that

Well then get her account to level 30 for her and then squad up with her for ranked

But would it friend lose elo too?

---
I have a squad. I’m not talking about for me. I just know that these behaviors drive people away from the game and at the end of the day it’s detrimental for the person getting kicked, the match being played, and the community as a whole. It’s a lot easier not to be an asshole than it is to be one.
---
Monty is still *THICC*
---
I need a spoiler warning on that post, bastard.
---
I already have. 15 TIMES. I’m losing the will bro
---
The system doesnt really take or reward elo. Well it kind of does but I think that's the wrong way to think about it. It just makes it as if the game against the cheater never happened. It's just an adjustment to your season not counting that match, win or lose. Makes it so cheaters have no impact on your rank at all, and that's how I think it should be.
---
I got a deep tissues massage, don’t worry

If you have a problem just scroll by. Majority of the time the people that make the fan art here put a lot of effort into their work. They have the full right to express their love of the game with their art. The operator icon things fall into the same category.

I usually do scroll by, but sometimes there's just so much that it's hard to ignore. I get where you're coming from though.
---
Yeah, have you not played casual/bronze/low gold? The coordination is lacking at best. Making an op only useful to high tier players/stacks makes them useless to most players which shouldn’t be the case IMO
---
What the fuck is glaz sniping and why is fuze not THICC
---
Oh I don't dive. I'm too terrified to do so. I do love horror though. However I prefer horror films to games since I find horror games far more terrifying. It's just something about the imersio of a good horror game that makes me wanna shit myself, apose to something like the Conjuring
---
Oooh we got a high roller here boys
---
Play around in some custom matches with your friends.
---
The game tells you "All drones destroyed" when all 5 have been killed. In essence their drone has been destroyed. I feel like it'd have been reasonable for Mozzie's gadget to count. 
---
Because since it doesn't count you'll forever have people competing for drones during these challenges and some people will be actively taking them out of play whether they realize it or not and that's kind of stupid.
---
DMR stands for "designated marksman rifle" - it's the same category ;)

Bro, it has nothing to do with being a snowflake, but when people start throwing racial slurs and just cuss people out for no reason is the norm something has to change. Btw your point 2 and 3 just show that you are part of the problem not the solution, but it's okay bud stay behind your "diamond" rank brag
---
Overall I'd say the operator on attack that has the most overall usage and utility is hibana. She can open everything and her kit is well rounded and can fit various playstyles. However, I terms of raw fighting power I think Zofia is the strongest attacker. Shes essentially a beefier Ash with a lot more complexity and range of playstyle. I agree that nomad is strong but I feel that she begins to struggle at extremely close range fights, since her pistol has that scope and her guns are only okay up close, so I feel you have to have good spacial knowledge when using Nomad and while her gadget is very strong, the recent nerfs while justified, make her slightly weaker.
---
Yeah ik, but the assholes have fun with being an ass, that why they’re assholes. Some parts of the community are gonna be toxic af, just like every community
---
What type of play style do you commonly play
---
Now everybody will do this :/
---
Of course
---
I only have one friend who plays and he is on a different platform unfortunately :(
---
This and people jumping through barricades that look like they're still up.

That sucks dude. Best of luck solo queuing in Ranked, you'll need it.

Actually when I checked Ubisoft club, apparently it's down. That could be why
---
 Flair doesn’t check out
---
I think if one person is ruining the game by actively losing rounds, it should be up to the other 4 players if they want to keep playing with that person
---
which is why you run her LMG
---
When you open that hatch if they have the objective underneath you can watch the hallway and the double staircase. It's good because it forces the defenders to stay in those two rooms and the bathroom or go through the objective door which is risky because of people in train. It's a strong hold but can be easily fixed with a nitro cell.

Sure, if someone is throwing then they need a kick. But voting someone out because they aren’t good yet is some gatekeeping bullshit.

I thought u guys would talking about if mozzie caped a drone, could a teammate kill it and will it count, now i understand
---
Thank you lol I know I will
---
Details
---
Why does someone always vote to kick.
---
So...you remade already existing artwork? I don't get it...
---
If they had that objective and you had thermite it wouldnt be worth it in my opinion, itd be wasting half of his utility. But with hibanna or using Mavericks torch it's more worth it in my opinion.
---
I like it but it looks similar to a seasonal skin that i cant think of the name of

Fucking great dude
---
There is so much wrong with that rifle I don't even know where to begin.
---
More people would have to get this idea at the top of the subreddit for ubi to see it
---
Why would you ever think it would just work out of the box? There’s no support for it on siege... You realize I’ve tested this on ps4 already and it doesn’t work. You’re just making stuff up at this point since you have no ground on stand on. You’ve been objectively wrong in every point you’ve made so far so now you’re just resorting to lies to try to prove it.
---
Ubi pls
---
Depends on your previous ranks (if any). 
---
If it is your first time playing ranked and/or new to siege it is very good. Bare in mind there is thousands of players in bronze so count yourself a better player.
---
Dude right?
---
Well thanks!It is my first time being ranked so thats a relief
---
Same. I don’t wanna sit in t-hunt defending a hostage 100 times lmao

Glaz just protecting fuze from the hostage's family

Okay lol
---
This is what casual should be but unfortunately its just people teamkilling, vote kicking and leaving.
---
Its just the old ass engine siege runs on,  almost 4 years old now. But yet again bfv used frostbite 3 and bf4 also used it in 2013 so i guess that doesn't matter.

Awww thank you! I don't post here often but you can follow me on social media for more frequent updates 💕
---
how was year 3 garbage?
---
If someone ask what it's like playing siege this clip is a perfect explanation
---
This is not an official questionnaire, the developers have nothing to do with this.  You're complaining about needing to fix an operator to a dude on reddit trying to provide a fun service.
---
Yessss its the missing seasonal skin we have wondered where the fk it went. Thanks for this, sincerely a Seasonal skin hoarder whore.
---
Alright so my friend was just retardly lucky
---
I guess but to some extent there would be way less luck in alpha packs say someone was to open 300 alpha packs at once but through all there time playing siege already opened all the common and uncommon it wouldn't be fun to open a rare, epic, or legendary cause it will just be normal for them. The reason opening getting rare items out if alpha packs is just that there rare there is no possible way to know if you will never get it or if it will be in your 1st ever alpha pack.
---
I had no idea you had a reddit
---
And I bet you're a good commenter but this is a seriously low quality comment.
---
We really need to go back to making it clear this is not official and the devs have nothing to do with it.  Just looking through the comments it's clear people aren't aware of that.
---
It's like the "Birthday" challenges in game.  You don't need to be Frost when you destroy 20 attacker drones to get Frost's gun skin, you can be any defender you want.  This stuff isn't rocket appliances.
---
In comes Mozzie 360 no scoping my drone
---
If you let a shield get that close to you, you’re kinda silly.

It was neither the top right or bottom left but it was an attempt

\*Plays on console where there is a built in video record\* "Im GoNnA fIlM tHiS wItH mY pHoNe"
---
Make Casual Great Again
---
It was the alibi.
---
They should take the blizzard approach, if someone leaves withing a certain amount of time the game ends within 10 seconds and the person who left gets penalized. It isn't a flawless system but better than what we have now
---
The Templar skin for the revolver is pretty good.
---
Dumb question. Is Discord for PC games only?
---
I play casual almost exclusively because I'm just not very good at the game.  But I really dread most of the casual maps.  Favela is so bad I can't even take it serious.  Plane sucks even though it's a great concept.  House can be a lot of fun to play on but let's be honest, it's garbage.  Skyscraper? Tower? whichever the Korean one is that's not in ranked is the only one I feel like is actually a really cool map but I know it's hated for lack of vertical play.
---
Why are all of these on console?
---
i had made up an operator in my head and his thing is a tear gas launcher
---
I’ve played a few games where there’s a door barricade barely intact and people walk right through it, I on the other hand have to break it still.
---
It was just incredibly lame. Yes they made balance improvements and all, but the majority of the operators were pretty lame and I regret buying it
---
Why do you think Ubisoft is asking you that question? This survey has nothing to do with Ubisoft, it's just a guy on Reddit trying to give you something nice and fun to do.
---
1 alpha pack each 10 levels, 500 renown each level up
---
**ouch**
---
your ping was high so it might have been you
---
You're only getting against them cause you've won around the same and have close to the same "elo". If some peeks spawn just punish then for it
---
Give teammate call outs subtitles, the results would be hilarious
---
so 19 is a high Ping now?
---
You don’t have to buy anything. And idk what you even are trying to say about them being lame. Just take a look at the mainstays to the meta this year.

Okay this is epic

AltZ if you have shadowplay
---
By making the bullets come out of the muzzle, and not at eye level, what the player sees and what the someone else can see would be two completely different things, especially when you consider that hip firing and ads affects what height the gun is held at.
---
Having the bullets come from eye level is the best way to avoid inconsistencies between player model, what the player sees and bullet trajectory and crosshair placement.

As some pointed out it could been the Ping, you can see clearly I have a consistent Ping of \~19. Its visible in the left bottom corner.

I never said i had to buy it. I did buy the pass because year 2 was absolutely incredible. Year 3 was so garbage. Maverick and class were the only interesting characters. Kaid is a better bandit in someways. It just didnt provide anything that new or interesting
---
Why thank you
---
You mean k?
---
It's funny though, the skin appeared in the TS with the other 3 (total of 4) yet when the Burnt Horizon patch notes launched they only showcased 3. Everyone that noticed Austral in game on the Test server were curious to know why it was not listed as a seasonal skin, no answer was given and now here we are almost 2 months later and it is now in game and marked as seasonal. Odd, very odd indeed. 
---
I wont complain however as I haven't missed a seasonal skin release since day one. Here's hoping we get some nice ones going forward since they may not tie with the seasons ahead since the reworks will be of existing maps. Fingers crossed, I'd like some modern skins.
---
vpn
---
Yes! 27,000 without season pass, 24,250 with season pass!
---
Guessing it was just a lot easier to find a model for a Super 90 than for the 556xi.  Not even the right shotgun for Thermite, pretty close though.  Looks like a Super 90 M3 (based on body style and the fact he pumped it), Thermite's is the Super 90 M4.
---
You'd be surprised how many awesome and sneaky drone spots there in some of the maps you can get to during set-up.
---
Almost want to make a video to showcase a bunch.
---
I'm not a gun nerd so I didn't notice
---
Also I have literally never used the shotgun on Thermite
---
"please ignore the backround"
---
dude... i can't, i just can't
---
This is incredible. It’s pen and ink right? I am a beginner to drawing, but tell your friend that people like her give me inspiration to practice more!
---
I think it may have been a bug! A whole bunch of skins went missing this season (I'm sure you've noticed) and were later returned, Ubisoft did not comment on the case at all. The skin was features in the TTS, and was my absolute favourite, and I'm so happy to see it finally appear in the live version of the game. Let's just assume it was somehow bugged and didn't appear for two months, lol!
---
Was hoping carlow . Because a persin who makes noise for attention fits abiut everyone who lives there

No, you have to be 18 (at least in my state)
---
That brings great sadness into my heart. *cries in Russian
---
Dang
---
To be fair, he could be relatively new and just thought it was a failed runout. This is a relatively rare strat.
---
Make his armor actually work. His helmet which is rated for pistol calibers cant even stop 9x18. His armor doesnt stop 5.56x45, 5.45x39, pistols of any kind, etc. Give him GOST 5 armor which is rated for a hit from 7.62x54R SNB.
---
Give him a bigger lmg, like a kpv 14.5x114 anti air gun. (Ok this is a meme) But his lmg fires 7.62x54R which for comparison is the same calibre glaze fires from his SVU. It should do 70+ damage.
---
Oh and just for the memes give him a ppsh with drum mag.
---
I do know that the weapon specific skins for Big Rhonda and Mozzie weren't available due to some issues with clipping and some not applying properly but were fixed, those skins are never usually showcased in the patch notes. Perhaps and just speculating - it may have been due to the issues that the other skins had where applying them just showed the the weapon as white rather than said skin. None the less, happy its back. Now all we need is that Saharan bundle for smoke please and thanks Yves.

Not sure if this is supposed to mention guns n roses or not but pretty cool

You know, just because you’ve had a certain set of experiences doesn’t make it the only valid set of experiences. Maybe he’s not randomly exaggerating online. Maybe he has experienced this. Regardless of whether or not he’s right, pushing for a less toxic mindset in the community is objectively good and you’re opposing that. You’re adding conflict to a situation that doesn’t need conflict.

Sure what?

By then it’s too late

If they did would they give players that are already like level 50, 50 alpha packs? Because I'm level 350 and leveling up takes forever so it would suck for players who have been playing for a while
---
That’s cool
---
Castle. Anything besides a bullet destroys his curtains. They don’t stop drones. Defender blows it up it’s gone. Guns. Trash.
---
I play castle a lot especially on certain maps, there are certain strats where he shines and it works 9/10 times. castle is really good on forcing the enemy through choke points. or wasting the utility.  But higher level players wont mess with barricades unless necessary because it could help them (thus forcing them in a ambush/choke point you have set up)... For example I like Castle on Villa in the Statuary/Trophy site. I castle off master and the doors facing Games and 90 hall. which forces them to go for the wall in master where (i am impact tricking) or come through the castles and we have people watching their feet if they decide to hit the barricades.
---
I vote for twitch cause the drone skin does make her drone much harder to detect so the skin is useful.

You do realise console forms the majority right?

finaly some good creativity on this sub , well done man.

err... now i see its meme video , not into that much... but the part you shared here was great , should do more of that.
---
Both of them are facing right?
---
I understand the flow, but like, having them firing at each other, and towards the right part of the screen is a little.... inconsistent?
---
Is that what diamonds and plats do
---
You've mastered the art of standing so perfectly still... that you appear invisible to the human eye.
---
I semi agree for *defense* but we were actually talking about attack xD Even on Defense Castle has his place on certain objectives (Bank CEO for example) but Kapkan is truly awful in most situations
---
Yeah but they don’t do damage, they can be seen, and I’m not saying take it back to what it was, but I mean come on. If they’re not right next to you it’s like you’re using the smg 11
---
If you don’t have friends who play this game on I assume Xbox, find some, the group posts are a good start, if not friends, then at least people who aren’t toxic or bots, or both.
---
Great play! I honestly hate it when it is 5v1 and my teammates just trickle in. I legit have to yell at my friends so they stop trying to get kills and just play safe. Also that guy who tried to votekick you is an ass, he died without killing anyone and you killed 4 people already.
---
Now there’s alibi who has a hatch opening pistol
---
Clash is strong if you have a second person to work as a team with. That's where she shines. Not by yourself.
---
Really horny kid busts nut when he realises his parents aren’t home
---
Is that overpowered?
---
Of course I think it's not
---
The best part was that when he first cycled it he did it backwards
---
Everything is spot on but man my boi icon tho... hes taking L where ever he goes
---
I wouldn’t say over powered but definitely a stronger than average defender
---
Thermite with a shotgun lol, he was dead before he breached
---
I get kicked because of my name. My name on the game is SlightyPotato and as soon as I join I get kicked because they don’t realize that my name is ironic
---
Anime always sneaks it's way in
---
If you rush, haha. 
---
Happens to me all too much.
---
I don't think it is, it can't actually one shot at close range
---
Average is meant to be silver1/gold4, so it is decent. Try not to focus that much on your rank and continue learning. Find a team as soon as possible so you get to play the real game and get rid of the "solo queue mentality", which just limits your understanding of the game (please trust me, I wish I would have done it sooner).
---
Wow, nice job on Kaid. Clean, not pixelated. I wish I could draw, by hand or on computer.
---
One time I won the round in a 1v2 situation and they kicked me AFTER winning the round.  Casual sucks.
---
Lion is arguably STRONGER after his "nerf". Less time to react to incoming scans. Less time between scans. Another charge of the scan. Marks stay for the entire duration and tick twice. The V308 is still stupidly good and has too much ammo. Fuze has a fantastic AR but his gadget is still essentially only enemy gadget clear.
---
This is fucking crazy my dude!
---
the camera rotates is the way I saw it
---
I often kill people because I see their laser, some even accused me of hacks because I preferred in perfect head height, laser gave it away. The impact is imo barely noticeable and they have zero effect on shotgun hipfire spread. Sometimes I see people because they glow red when they look to your vague direction.
---
Only use them on shields so you can line up and quick ads people.

When you're the only one in the defending room and every fucking barricade explodes.

Ash has a hitbox
---
She just has a secret ability to fuck with your packets when she appears
---
I never said that anyway the thing i am saying is that people only care / cry about xim apex but xim apex isnt the worst the worst is cronusmax/+ pro rapid fire jitter no recoil auto aim and not forget the hori tech that playstation supports look sony doesnt want to stop mouse and keyboard they litterly sell their own one and dont fault ubisoft ubisoft cant do anything about it only microsoft and sony can but they dont want to 
---
Anyway sorry for bad grammar 
---
Lets hope normal controller players soon  can also become high plat / diamand.
---
I finally found you on Reddit :D

Theres no way that text is real

Yeah it's fine to answer this if you're new. It's useful to see predominant opinions. Some of these questions can force you to reevaluate how you see different things.
---
As for not being very informed of game mechanics, just look at this subreddit as a whole. A LOT of that going around.
---
P2W squad
---
That was fucking sick but what’s with the chick at the end I’m curious?
---
Upvote this comment if you have accidentally killed someone when opening a barricade
---
When you're slowly and quietly sweeping your way around the map in complete silence, focus is your number #1, you haven't heard anyone else move, no one has shot a bullet, the announcer is dead quiet, teammates have said nothing...
---
And then right next to you a teammate comes fucking flying through a barricade and surprises that absolute shit out of you.
---
Big lag =big throw
---
Holy shit. Nice work! BTW what is the source for the background clip at 3:30 "shining finger"
---
Kapkan is almost a required pick for defending some maps, but an absolute hindrance for the defending team on others. Whether that makes him the *worst* defender, I don't think so, but it still puts him above others.
---
GG
---
My bet would be jackals C7 with muzzle brake and vertical grip (45 damage and 800 rpm) and lesions SMG (28 dmg and 900 rpm) with a muzzle brake. Tho maestros ALDA 556 and vigils Main SMG are good contenders.
---
They keep trying to fix it and people keep finding ways to get up there.
---
That was my own gameplay. I was pretending to be alibi on Bank, so I wasn’t moving at all. Then blitz stepped into frame before I blew him away. I had the idea of using it as a plate for the effect while I was editing.
---
Lets also not forget modded controllers with extra buttons on the back wich is a big advantage and the rapid fire jitter no recoil .
---
I was playing when it dropped, stopped when dust line dropped, came back when skull rain dropped, and because of the toxicity i stopped playingg until grim sky cause the ultimate was 6 bucks on xbox so i said maybe its better and it was. There will always be toxic assholes in this game, but i feel its been slowly getting better than when it first started.
---
Thats intresting actally
---
Don't forget Cav
---
Are you wearing any type of outfit or just default valk?
---
shes actually a really powerful op she can hack cams and call the enemy which is great at clearing roamers and she has a great dmr and two good smgs (i prefer the c75)
---
Use it as you are about to push a room or plant a bomb. Then you can hear where they are or they have to stop holding an angle to turn it off.
---
Yeah, i just got the idea and thought this could be a well balenced usefull opp!
---
Would be very op
---
So I assume pairing her with jackal is great at counter roaming.. good to know:) anything else like strats you know
---
Black Ice without the blue makes me think of some of the old pro league weapon skins. They were basically just that
---
2500+ hours here. Has yet to happen.

---
Smh happened to me too. Ubisoft needs to actually look at the chat
---
I hop on my smurf when i do inevitably get banned( my irl team is called the heathens and we tend to defend ourselves against toxic people even at the result of a ban) but i use it to try and teach players the mistakes i once made and hope they learn from theirs as i once learned from mine( like not standing in a door way to drone or peek a hallway)
---
I think they could balance this pretty good
---
I just do something productive and come back to this
---
Run away as fast as possible
---
Nothing wrong with Asian servers, but nobody here uses Xbox, so I wouldn’t be able to find a match
---
A lot of operator ideas on this sub are crazy but this seems like it could make an interesting operator, maybe not exactly this but the idea is cool
---
bring dokkaebi jackal lion blitz and finka for ultimate cancer mode
---
hey no fair, i've been placed silver before due to solo'ing (i'd consider myself a plat+ player) and silver/gold is pretty much the standard for the majority of the community anyway.
---
and i'm stuck in low gold right now on my alt, and am I a smurf? no. i'm actually trying to win. maybe gold players shouldn't be gold and should be actually silver.
---
I just want jager acog back
---
Thx, and yeah mabey some things are to op about this but this is just the idea, if it gets really populair ubi has to work this out.
---
My fingers are just double-jointed, don't mind that.
---
maybe just don't be toxic &amp; turn off your chat
---
Can this be done on console
---
yes you are a bad person. those poor newcomer kids dont even know what to do yet lol you bully
---
I reload it then it’s work for a game or 2 then the same thing happens again
---
and what'd you type? lol
---
This is the best siege clip I've seen in a long time.
---
is it bannable tho?
---
Thermite for me
---
me too, congrats on your first karma lol
---
That’s an interesting way to look at it. I’ve barely played with or against him since his rework so I’m basing my opinion off how I think he is now in theory. Still, I don’t think the scans are more powerful. A full body outline is just ridiculously strong, even though it stopped outlining if you stopped moving. 
---
In a coordinated team then sure, I could see the new scans being quite good. But in solo queue and mid tier ranked, he’s basically worthless. I feel like half the time, you’re barely even gonna have time to find where the ping is before it goes away. That can be alleviated by communicating but overall I still think he’s in a weaker state, though I’m curious to see how he performs at higher levels and in pro league (I assume his ban will be lifted next season if it hasn’t already, I haven’t been following).
---
Why would it be bannable lmfao
