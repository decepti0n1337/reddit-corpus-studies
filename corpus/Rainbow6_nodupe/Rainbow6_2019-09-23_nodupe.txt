Yup time to play Seige on Minecraft
---
---
---
Oh fuck no
---
but yeah I guess you could bait them out in a 1v1 if you don't get walled
---
But I wound up doing it anyway.
---
Aspect ratio?
---
Even on PC that's not how it works pal. That knife goes in and you're stuck in that animation until the real interrogation process is complete. It's identical to what you described for console.
---
That ace tho
---
get fucked idiot
---
Me too
---
F
---
Those are pretty solid picks, nomad or jager are decent picks as well, just operators that lend themselves well to carrying
---
I love how he made this purposely trying to look bad but still hit 4 headshots
---
I love it when people ask what the exact parts are for all the cosplays.......most of this stuff is gonna have to be DYI.
---
19.7 years
---
Yea usually lesion for me
---
Please trim ur clips not being rude but please
---
What rank r u
---
Yeah what id probs do is pass through the alibi into the hallway and get tagged a few times then sprint around back to the outside of the stairs
---
I know that It also doesn't work on Vigil :)
---
Imagine that was the first thing you saw in the morning
---
i just like how it looks Christmas themed

The problem was that it was letting high ranked players into lower ranked games, not the opposite.  He was "benefitting" from it by being able to play with his friends, not climbing the ranks (considering he's still 1000 below them)
---
Extremely nice work, would make a nice album cover
---
As a guy who has Lion in his name he is permabanned even in unrankeds and if not some teammates that are trying to be turbo funny they pick him just cuz of my name.
---
Damn you guy's are real gatekeepers about this shit, let people post their videos in peace, there's a reason Reddit has up/downvotes.

That isn't just a potato, that's bloody multiple mate!
---
Well if you did you should have hit him lol
---
I dunno, I guess maybe I’m just seeing it wrong
---
Either way console animation feels slower
---
Cuz she didn’t kill me
---
Hitler?
---
I’m a console player too and have had DDoS issues. Just because you haven’t ran into the issue, doesn’t mean it’s not an issue on console.
---
Esports ready amirite?

What
---
Riperonis just grind super hard eventually you will be good enough to carry i solo que I know the pain
---
Your aim wasn’t much better, it just came down to you having more bullets. It would’ve gone down a a lot different if you had to reload
---
Nah that’s called him not being able to see you because he’s scoped in. I do that all the time. Not as bad as this but still embarrassing

BrUh tHIs iS FaKE!!!!!!!! ExPoSEeeeEEeEDdDD!!?!??!?!!!!

This is the funniest bug I’ve seen in a while and it doesn’t break the game so I’m chillin w it.
---
Bug fixes, bug fixes, and probably bug fixes
---
I never said that it was not a console issue. Pay attention. I said it wasn't that bad on console and that is from personal experience. If that offends you than I can't help you.
---
I have a feeling I played with you earlier.
---
I played unranked today and there were multiple tk’s lmao
---
I would like a game mode/map selector for terrorist hunt
---
LOL OMG 😂😂😂 same XD XD xd XDDD UwU owo OwO hahaha lol 😂😂
---
You and me both brother, XD
---
I’m sorry, I’ll show myself out
---
Then to actually fix the damn game and listen to its fucking community
---
r/countagiouslaughter
---
This is depressing
---
Lol XD cx
---
xoxo
---
If you want to play with low rank friends go to casual or unranked. Or just prioritize top player's rank.
---
Ye again I dont see how it happens that much. You may be ranked low ig and I onow its way more common in the lower ranks. All you can do is work past it. Had a team last night that wasnt throwing but none of them were trying but I was able to carry for a win. Just dont focus on it and dont let other control your emotions and you can have fun regardles.
---
Psssst! Use asterisks *

I didn't even realize that I already had rook armor until i rewatched this clip lmao

you can see me struggling to get the armor at the end of the clip and not realizing i had it on already

*Laughs in Sledge*

I’m heavily considering quitting for the same reasons.

barely anyone plays that but it would be better for causual.

But, that’s what makes this game so great! That randomness makes the game fun! They do this so people like you can’t just destroy literally everyone in the game because you’ve dedicated your life to studying maps and spray patterns. Without that randomness factor this game would get pretty boring pretty fast. Sure it might mean you won’t be the best player in the world, but I would rather be bad at a game and have fun, then be good at a game that’s boring. Try playing with friends mate. It changes the game completely and makes it way more fun. In the end, the pint of the game is to provide fun and sometimes fun doesn’t mean winning the game
---
Thank you ;-; &lt;3
---
This game is just shit, I'm ready for quarantine to come out so this game can just fucking die. I've wasted the last 3 years of my life on it and I want my money back. Fuck Ubisoft, and fuck siege.

Let's go play MW man, fuck this shit.

It’s because of cunts who main ops like Montagne and blitz. They don’t deserve high ranks, that and shitty maps, bugs , pay to win system, broken ranking system, toxic teammates and enemies, and so much more shit.
---
Every season, I place gold after my placement matches, because the placements take your skill into account, but after that, it’s whether you win or lose, so then it just goes down, I’ve started playing my placements and then just doing casual or unbanked to simulate a much more competitive environment compared to the fucked up ranked playlist. This games done, I give it one more fucked up season before it kicks the bucket for gold
---
not bitchy enough
---
What the hell over 7 thousand days
---
Kinda. When but my game would just crash after a couple seconds
---
When I'm walking the halls in school and see a camera I just have a sudden urge to pull out my suppressed sidearm and shoot it.
---
Perhaps they couldn't hear you.
---
My friends and I always play in a private party chat all the time even when we don't have a five stack. 
---
The rare times we do, the moment someone plays loud music, spews or goes off in an offensive rant, is a squeaky kid, or even has an annoying voice, they'd get instantly muted.
---
The "frost trap frost trap frost trap frost trap" in that voice would probably have been muted pretty quick if it was me.
---
Who's Joe?
---
But how did he not see the trap!!
---
happens to the best of us, you're not alone
---
She thick
---
My game doesn’t crash, fortunately. It just teleports people around the map at least from my point of view and always gets me killed.
---
Not bad! What LEDs did you use?
---
It’s not over til it’s over
---
Theater mode as in?.... Every platform R6 is on has a DVR built in...
---
What is gunsmith supposed to mean?
---
Why are you on this subreddit if you hate siege ?
---
Ill never get better being dead by teammates 247.
---
The cunts should be the Ash and jäger mains (plus 3 speed, twitch,Doc and Rook), who only play them ops for the weaponry. That’s why this game has become the way it is; because these retardedly strong ops dominate and the devs refuse the nerf them hard. It makes what Siege is, vanish. 
---
Siege is about equipment use, manipulating the landscape and getting kills that way. But no, this game actively rewards Ash players who just run in with a weapon you cannot beat unless if they have half decent aim. It’s pathetic now. 
---
This again is why this game is becoming so casual and low-skilled, as it’s becoming Call of Duty with destruction. Sad to see this happen but it’s the truth
---
Are we certain this is from the ddos bans? I’ve seen vans this high before
---
Yeah
---
Without doc, thermite would've killed you.
---
It is a massive problem on console. You're just not high enough of a rank to be experiencing it.
---
It's just her voice and her elite skin can relate to a soccer mom so
---
It can catch people off guard at any rank, I’m not saying her gadget is good, IQ is the far superior pick to her if you want the LMG. But her gadget just isn’t something I would want to see be good, like just rappelling in windows and killing one or two than dying instantly
---
And I’ve seen like Macie jay clips where he plants the defused and flies up the hatch and watches the defuser from above
---
Yeah but I’d rather go against an op who has to aim rather than one with a shotgun with insane range
---
*Fook
---
Ummm
---
I just looked at his account he has only 1 game (Siege) yet has 666 platinum wtf
---
K, and the r6 Community wonders why they’re known as the most toxic
---
This game isn’t shit, it’s just losing its identity quickly and needs some serious changes to help combat this, but it won’t happen as the devs are too stubborn to change these issues
---
It just takes awhile. It can run it, just slower.
---
Also my graphics are kinda trash
---
There's a difference between just putting it raping the shit out of your text with that
---
they can kill you one time. at tops one round you arent there. If you arent willing to accept that throwing teammates arent the reason you are in gold then you should maybe play another game.
---
I had to check the video a few times to make sure my phone wasnt freezing up lmao
---
What ranks would you say because if it's Diamond then no I wont see it
---
I kinda pulled some numbers out of my ass I haven’t played too much ranked so I didn’t know but that sounds like a smart idea.
---
Why would you spend that much money on a game you don't enjoy?
---
Your title gave me a stroke
---
I bought digital version on my ps4 and I have like 5 smurfs, you don’t have to buy it again
---
Why???
---
No I was joking that it was the website twitch
---
Don't even go there. It has nothing to fucking do with rank
---
Shotgun, frost, cav or vigil sitting in bumfuck nowhere
---
Twitch was trying to be fancy and get a claymore kill. Maestro detonated it in such a way so that he was outside the blast, but she wasn’t.
---
Not to mention I am always fucking losing because of griefing teammates, thats how it is. It aint me.
---
Is it set as your primary?  If so you’re good.
---
I hate to put it bluntly but you just won’t improve playing cas, yeah it’s fun but people don’t play seriously without the pressure. I’m only gold (given I only have like 100 hours) but I play with my low ranked friends because it helps them improve a lot more and quicker.
---
Also given the difference between bronze to gold is much smaller that let’s say diamond to gold
---
Ohhh that big brain right there
---
yikes, good job for you but idk what to say about the other guys
---
It's Diamond 22
---
The shotgun is good at the ranges it should be good. What’s wrong with that. I think more shotguns should be good where hers is. 
---
As for the Scorpion, it’s in a great spot, and she should become to staple comparison to how 3 speed should be handled in this game. The gun is fine the way it is, and forces her to use her gadget and speed to get her kills. Same with the shotgun.
---
Why does everyone who asks this question want a low recoil weapon so they don’t have to play siege the way it should be played. This isn’t about you per say, it’s just that players actively ask for this game to be less skilled season on season with balancing changes.
---
These posts are always so pointless, if you stop enjoying a game just stop playing it, it's not complicated 
---
I keep playing siege because I still enjoy it, if there I  didn't enjoy it anymore I would stop playing it. I wouldn't write a paragraph about how I feel like a POW to this game
---
Bring back old
---
Maybe you just suck? 🤔
---
Eh, only 19 years. I'm sure the game wont be dead by then.
---
Diamond camo is just Platinum camo but with gemstone texture
---
That's why I also said unranked.
---
It would be illegal if u know what I mean
---
Tf I couldn’t even see him,unfair gun play
---
I suck because I get TK'd? You're the exact fucking reason why this game is trash.
---
Can we get an F in the chat for that man
---
Better than the actual one
---
😂 bro tell me where I am wrong. You are literally asking someone to carry you out of bronze into a rank you dont belong. Whats your name/console?
---
Looks like someone said sp1cy
---
But them to correlate well. Harder skilled weapons require aim and so you cannot complain nearly as much if they kill you. 
---
Ash just strolls in and kills you with a gun that didn’t require her to think. They are worse for sure
---
Tbf it only does that when it loads in for a second
---
Lmao I love that it says how many days instead of just permanently banned, adding a little salt to the wound. Justified salt.
---
Not bad
---
He’s fucking break dancing like rook
---
r/lostredditor
---
We defend it because criticism for criticisms sake is counter productive if it is a valuable criticism then it doesn't need defending and we would support you. But criticism of re-using weapons isn't super necessary to begin with because again there are 80+ weapons to give ops. I wouldn't be mad if a new op had the g36c and pdw as primary because those guns are never used by their ops and it would be nice to see weapons that don't normally get used because their op has a better kit. So saying ubi is lazy and critising them because you want new guns just for the new look that is a pointless criticism that should not be backed up. Don't mean to be toxic but the devs get enough flax for things out of their control due to engine limitations and this shouldn't be one of them
---
Im hoping for rainbow six patriots
---
Welcome to the diamond club tho
---
i had actually gotten into a game with him and he was trying to flex his rank like wild
---
Bruh she's useful in literally any situation because her gun is so ridiculously strong.
---
This community loves ladies!
---
I am terrified they will ruin my man Buck's face when they release his Elite set.
---
Love how people have so much extra time.
---
Ofc its an anime avi
---
UBI PLS DO
---
No. Not at all. However, it will take at least 50-100 hours to start getting into the game itself. I do recommend playing with a friend who plays consistently, as playing with a better person will teach you a bit about the game.
---
I don't really understand what is happening with all this "DDoS" stuff. can someone please explain to me?
---
“OMJASdBDIHASBDIHASBD”
---
How about we fix the game crashes first...
---
Updoot for dat manz
---
Show the killcam pov
---
Stomp on people with superior peripheral.
---
If that somehow fails, boot them from the game.
---
Rinse, repeat.
---
Lord please tell me you didn’t
---
He’s my lover ;)
---
When is it not nowadays?
---
but getting to 290wl would take ages? do people like this REALLY have nothing better to do?
---
I've got 556xi black ice on 3 accounts lmao. XBONE, PC Main and PC Smurf.
---
I have close to 400 hours on tachanka
---
For legal reasons I am not affiliated with this person...
---
And its less frustrating with a friend
---
You have a point
---
34 days? Got damn nigga
---
10000 iq and ping
---
LMAO YOU RIGHT
---
Its because the obj cant be captured anymore due to no one being alive, so the defenders win.
---
This is literally me... https://youtu.be/gNtL9sw4mwA
---
Thank you, I wasnt expecting this much toxicity, but I guess I should have seen it coming
---
They kinda fixed boosting or at least made it harder you can’t play with someone who is 1000 elo below you
---
Thats still seems unfair
---
Your fault
---
I didn’t even know I was in ranked I was playing with friends
---
I agree, but it does make sense
---
The 417 is a DMR being used by 2 speed 2 armor that is Twitch and Lion with vertical grip only.
---
But the AR-15.50 is a DMR being used by a 3 speed that is Maverick with access to angled grip.
---
In the end, we are wasting time comparing because both are inferior to their full auto assault rifles counterpart.
---
Yeah I saw that, dude also plays WoW arena. Very impressive.
---
S T I L L W A R M
---
It wasn't the exact same time then. You are able to draw the round.
---
I seen a downed Kaid earlier, but I knew it was the Fuze's kill so I let him be and turned around and looked at the Fuze. The Fuze ended up dying so I killed the Kaid
---
Yeah, there shouldn't be AFK kicks in ranked. It's like you need to go pee, and suddenly you're banned for half an hour.
---
No one seems to notice there's also only 4 people on the other team lol
---
Blitz is looking at this post sweating. His forehead is moist.
---
Tower is your favorite map?
---
*what did it cost
---
God it looks like Sledge fucking donked his head
---
Yeah it is pretty bad. Best to get out quickly.
---
34 days as in total hours or 34 as in I got the game 34 days ago?
---
Yeah probably extra niche.
---
No it wouldn’t let me reconnect
---
I have yet to get my first one.
---
Because that’s what heroes do
---
Pshhh nah the 290.0 ranked win/loss is just his pure skill
---
It’s fun when it works right. When it doesn’t work right, it’s not fun. I’ve been playing since beta, I’d rather they fix this BS than just stop playing.
---
The fact that you’re so casual suggests you’re bad bub
---
Yeah but why did you afk?
---
Yeah it's an odd choice, but it's beautiful and it has a pretty interesting playstyle with the lift as a choke point
---
But it does to a lot of us. It gives us a challenge to strive for. And it sucks when you have people cheating.
---
the 20 year ban
---
Well it didnt draw and killfeed said they both headshot eachother so idk. Maybe because it was ranked?
---
That’s just fake.
---
It's not hard for the devs at ubi. That isn't the issue. The issue is that it's probably more work than it's worth.
---
And 99% of this sub doesn't work on the engine. So what? Hell, you probably don't either.
---
Still not as good as my lucky pixel peek on console. It wasn't even half a pixel and I just shot randomly and I messed that Ela's head up
---
You got kicked because your connection was bad enough that it could potentially negatively affect the game or more specifically how other players interact with you.
---
You got the abandon because you got kicked from unranked or ranked and didn't return before it was over. Both modes don't backfill players into the match so you leaving left your teammates at a disadvantage. Whether you left on purpose or because of your bad internet connection the other players on your team shouldn't be stuck with a teammate that can't stay in the match and help them win. That's why you deserve the penalty, use the time to fix your internet or play Casual where players can be backfilled to fill your spot.
---
They're just gonna milk this one till the whole series dies.
---
Makes me think of the Mime from Detective Pikachu.
---
"YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME ALIVE!!"
---
Nice
---
I feel that
---
Reminds me of the SpongeBob episode where SpongeBob and Patrick go down to Rock Bottom and the locals can't understand you unless you intermittently do that weird "thbptttt" sound.
---
Not much of a nerf when echo is still banned every game.
---
Buy what you want and will play. It will be most worth the money in that case, obviously. Screw the silly friend rule. That way you both can play whatever characters you want to play and have their elites.
---
did you know that now you can rappel into windows and kill people.
---
I feel like most of reddit is like this.  Hell, most Siege lobbies are like this too.
---
Toxic forums and toxic game communities really don't mix lol
---
Oof
---
I'd reccomend either frost or buck. Both are very easy to learn. Bucks c8 has a lot of recoil, but its manageable if you dont use an acog at first. Frosts gun is a really good smg, and her welcome mats work well with her gun. Well placed mats can do a lot of damage to a team
---
It looks like she’s holding a poke ball and now I really wanna see a Valkyrie x Pokémon drawing
---
I hope she gets an elite soon one that shows her face like this but withhout the hat
---
question is would ubi keep her silent step green? i hope thet change the color
---
This accounts for maybe 1/100 of my chat interactions, this is indeed a rarity.
---
It's siege, but with 64 player teams fighting over a town
---
I love this! I’ve been hating the acog ever since I started playing back in operation white noise
---
:(
---
OwO
---
"Sneaky"

Gregor and varsity are pretty good for learning, and Rouge9 is good if you wanna know the stats of new operators, weapons, and changes with updates
---
Wouldn't even complain honestly unless they were to use hacks that actually ruin the games.
---
I got Black Ice for the m590 shotgun, which I use all the time. My 2 friends also got a Black Ice skin... thought maybe it was a gaurenteed Black Ice. I'm sad for you, friend.
---
In 20 years..
---
Hibana looks great, I love her elite skin
---
They were also using wall hacks and aimbot
---
I got the universal fin winter camo
---
Hello JollyAstronomer, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d817pz/clicking_return_to_menu_crashes_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

or joined a consistent stack ?!?
---
Welcome back, oh and BTW blitz is still annoying
---
i got the elite of thatchers unmasked rekt
---
but seriously its sad these alpha packs were not even dup protected, luckily for me i have little to no items so i got some oil spill for one of the russian pistols
---
I really like the camo the guy was using
---
Looks better than the actual elite skin tbh
---
i can play halo, call of duty, gears, etc without ever getting booted from my game.
---
i've gotten booted from matches half way into a season repeatedly.
---
Oh well then yeah screw that
---
Perfect for halloween. Flash kids with the shield then take their candy
---
I think the non canon explanation is that she threatens the enemies over the radio and in a panic, they do a location report before realising that cav can still hear them and switches radio channels.
---
Apex is fun, sometimes it's not so bad if you play by yourself. The only time i had issues was because i had a daily challenge to use one of the legends (who i don't like nor normally use) and apparently it was someone else's main legend so that was toxic. And when i was the jump master and i landed my team in one of the main high loots areas. He was upset and almost siege level toxic lol 
---
I'm a console player so i'm not sure if the community as a whole for siege is toxic. The people i've talked to here seem really nice and make me want to play again but then i realize most are either PS4 players or PC players. Then i just get depressed
---
That's horseshit. Casual or not, just let people play their game.
---
I meant it ironically. It’s not my fault you don’t understand the basic elements of sarcasm. We all know this place is far from heaven
---
That reminds me, doesn't frost have an under armour hat?
---
I’m sitting here wondering how y’all won 3 games of Unranked! Played close to 10 matches thus far and half have ended with my team massacring themselves...
---
Damn straight
---
Ok Bro thankoyu
---
Join the club, I got a Duplicate M870 Leder skin.
---
Cave
---
No probs. Glhf and get well soon.
---
Np man Im allways here if you have any more siege questions.
---
Yo everyone about to comment I did mean this ironically. We all know this game community is far from heaven
---
I got the oil spill skin for the Brazilian pistols.
---
Sometimes you just want people to step in your Sticky Gu tho.
---
Says the echo main
---
I dont think you know what wooosh means
---
Screwing around is pretty much exactly what casual is for, especially now that there’s unranked. People are gonna troll, joke around, clutch or kick, etc. a lot in casual so if that’s something you’re trying to avoid you should just play unranked.
---
Also thermite with nade
---
It must be fake
---
Someone doesn't get a joke or sarcasm it isn't me though wonder who
---
Why must you assume that I mean come on give me a little faith here
---
Sorry but that shield still cant prevent headshots.
---
I remember I was getting tk'd by two assholes, managed to get downed, one of the guys on the other team let me bleed out so the "teammate" whod downed me got kicked and banned. Good times.
---
That's cool and all but ubi really needs to unban all toxic bans that dont relate to team killing. Because rules that protect emotions is libtard shit bro
---
I’m still salty abt this toxic 14 year old on my team a few minutes ago :/
---
Great times
---
Aren’t we all
---
Damnnn😂😂😂💀
---
i dont know how this was even possible.

Y’all f***ing removed my comment for saying “f***ing bot”... y’all just hate me
---
The mines she uses are very helpful to know form wich direction the enemies are coming from. And her weapon is nice. It has a little bit of recoil and it need some practice to get it under control.
---
Personally I don’t like vigil because I find his ability kinda useless.
---
"but the US doesn't have a far left. "
---
ANTIFA is definetly the far left. People who race bait like Jesse Smollet are far left. 
---
"Antifascists also aren't an organisation they're just people who are,"
---
Yes they are they organize monthly in various large cities around the US. they literally preach about proactive violence. 
---
you cant just talk out your ass I live here and know this shit
---
Well considering this dude messaged me saying "watch this" then the whole server crashed, I'm gonna assume it was him
---
Fuckkkkk
---
the Pistol isnt OP at all, 400rpm max, only good at close range as the recoil makes it so you cant do anything &gt;15m before you start getting fucked by ACOGs, and with no utility and a useless ability its fine.
---
plus the shields are basically not even there
---
Why is it when i post a meme here it get taken down
---
IF ONLY THEY BANNED IP ADRESSES AND NOT JUST ACCOUNTS WHICH THEY CAN MAKE A NEW  ONE. FOR ALL WE KNOW THE ACOUNTS THAT GOT BANNED ARE JUST SMURFS.
---
While I definitely agree with your sentiment, I think that's more of a engine issue at this point. Hopefully a Siege 2 could fix the weapon modding and other such stuff.
---
Yeah pretty much. Solo queuing is definitely a dangerous game to play.
---
youre reading comprehension is very poor. go back to my first comment on my thread and stop putting words in my mouth.

Nice job with the pistol.

90% of my interactions on PC are positive. I also like to try and be overtly positive to the Toxic Chat directed at me. (I'll report it if it's bad enough, sure.)
---
If you reply to negativity with "xxxx" or  "I love you too" it normally kills it off or lightens the mood and people start communicating more. At least in ranked.  Casual is a whole different ball game.
---
TF happened?

---
Outdated but still works on some maps.
---
Yes. Shields have it the worst currently.
---
Whats the joke?
---
Because downing them isn’t killing them
---
I personally use the ak because it has the pro league skin from the set, other than that I’d say bring the arx.
---
You can contact Ubisoft about it. I’ve had to do it as well. It’s a pain in the ass.
---
Real siege etiquette is letting him diffuse and then TKing him.
---
I once had a team where 5 were alive with defuser down, and it was just a train of ppl defusing, getting tkd and the next one hopping on. Pretty hilarious haha
---
Tbh permaban for talking shit in voicechat is a lil too harsh imo. Why would u permban toxic shittalkers that everyone can mute but temporary ban players that pay cheaters to boost them? logic
---
It's been almost consistently Clash for me. And it's always the people who are defending first who ban her, which makes no sense.
---
I guess everyone just hates her.
---
Ok so thatcher has a saw thermite has a m8 and fuze has a 45 muesoc
---
I would stand on clap but im on the toilet

Very similar but y2k was about displaying the change of the millennia and the 2038 problem is about storing the actually date so it might actually be harder to solve. Luckily we have almost 20 years thought.

If your teamate downs an enemy, don't steal it.

Also, big one people still confuse me about.. DON'T shoot the DRONE with the WHITE OUTLINE when you have a MOZZIE on your team.
---
I don't know how people still don't understand that.
---
Fuck you Valkyrie from 5:37 pm.
---
Fuck you.
---
That’s a lot of damage!
---
lol......yea, that's not enough evidence to permaban someone.
---
Yesterday someone in chat told everyone he just pooped and everyone congratulated him. 
---
So wholesome
---
At least someone understand that what I am saying is not political and more common sense of sorts.
---
look closer. one of these things are not like the others.
---
Depends on the map, tbh.
---
If its on something that has a garage, then yeah.
---
We got the vortex with mozzie and the Leupold with Gridlock so we can totally get more optics.

Looks great. Have you done any others?

Yup

Aliens running from Area 51 raid.

Why is Israel not allowed? It's one of the main countries in the rainbow six story and definetly deserves to be in siege.
---
Other than Israel i want Sweden, Greece probably too.
---
Just the USP45, or P12.
---
also not a joke. a real thing that happened in game
---
Uh, you know this isnt something that happens consistently, right?
---
What goes for their stats though? I feel as if a supposed battle eye type ban would completely wipe their accounts. If they are just putting "Perma" temp bans on them isnt it still keeping their account and stats in a stasis type position?
---

Weird flex but ok.
---
All the sights have their pros and cons, but you could certainly argue that the red dot is the objectively worst sight so a lot of little virgins take that way too far to the point of, well, acting the way you see about the red dot.
---
The red dot has a large casing(that’s big in all the wrong places), large reticle, and a large sight window... That means it covers a lot of your screen and takes away a lot of peripheral vision, but it also has a lot of area within the sight window before you get out to where things are blocked by the casing. However it’s going to be much more common that the large casing hurts you than it is for the large sight window to help you.
---
The reticle, the large red dot itself, is kind of the sight’s biggest pro but also one of its biggest cons at the same time. The positive is that it’s very intuitive. The first time I tried to switch to reflex I just *could not* get my brain to make the switch to “put it just below what you want to shoot!” instead of “put it on what you want to shoot!” The red dot is a nice, simple red dot that’s very natural to put it on what you’re trying to shoot without having to think about it at all. However, it’s big and that’s one of the worst and most frustrating parts of that sight. You might be holding an angle where you know someone might peek and you’re gonna be right on their head when they do and... Then you’re dead. They did exactly what you wanted them to but it meant nothing because the red dot completely covered their head and you didn’t see them. 
---
The cons of the red dot are pretty big ones and the biggest pro is that it feels so natural, so that’s why I feel you could argue it’s the objectively worst sight because you can negate the biggest pro simply by getting used to another sight but there’s no negating the cons.
---
If you plan to play a lot of Rainbow and be pretty serious about it, I’d suggest getting used to the holo or reflex. But if you’re only going to play occasionally and you feel changing would make you get worse before you get better and you don’t want to put in the time to get used to the other sight so that a change would be positive then don’t. Use whatever you prefer and whatever is going to be best for you.
---
Doesn't really work anymore

They were a group of 3 all dos plats.. every season my goal is to reach plat but I’d never drop as low as dos’ing a server to get it.. what is wrong with people
---
whats not funny about a bunch of reddit users getting their pants in a twist over a game¿ when 99% of them are in silver and blame MnK on them not being diamond? its hilarious
---
Ye I know, just find it weird how he returns after 3 months and already knows the exploits 🤷‍♀️
---
wasnt a joke? i dont have time to explain how wrong you are
---
Probably saw vids or his friends told him about this glitch
---
If it’s all you have to say, then yes, as you said, it reduces its meaningfulness. When spoken in moderation/when appropriate, it’s good/fine

If they can find a fix for KM on console that would really be incredible.

Lmao, imagine it legit spawned him in as Ash. Would be crazy.

Good point. I still don't like it.
---
Good to know!
---
 any girl ever will say that siege has a toxic community
---
The stupidity of what you're saying is astounding, it really is.
---
They are lucky that getting a 19 years ban instead of getting themselves into jail.
---
Same issue I had last season, got one win away from plat and got yoinked. Haven’t had much of an issue this season, yet at least.

shit tier guns, you will only get 1 kill before you get shutdown if you are above gold, no utility.

Not all people are bad. I team killed a teammate the other day who scared me, (still kinda uncalled for, I should've been more aware) and I apologized hut he just laughed it off and said "my bad, it's all good"

1. This answer was partially a joke (420:0,69)

2. Even if there are many female players they usually don't expose themselvels and i.e. don't invite ppl to PS4 parties or discord.

It's not matchmaking, it's a bug in that it hasn't actually placed you into a queue. If you bothered to google/search the Reddit it would be explained a million times. 
---
You also didn't give any context to 'I was afk and matchmaking in the background'. You deliberately left out you weren't physically sat there to try and paint the situation as more extreme than it was.
---
I don't get it. If a number is too large, why not just use a different type of variable to store it... When I'm counting small, I use Int, when I'm counting big I use double, when I'm counting even bigger, I save the exponent as a double instead of the number.

negative integers probably i.e. with 32bit you can go from −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 so I imagine that with 64bit (which is defacto standard already) you can from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
---
So I imagine that in 20 or so years we will upgrade time servers to 64bits and start a null second on that exact moment 32bit would run out. 
---
Then again, historical dates do not need to be measured so fuck those really. You can write down and use 1900s on computers today and those dates work just fine.

---
And, in the end, Mute was given an SMG-11 during Wind Bastion, so Ubi can pretty much change anyone's loadout when they want.

You can report that to our [Support Team.](http://support.ubi.com)

Okay so first off the win deltas are the most unreliable source to use to balance operators as it leaves out millions of the community.  Two the fo-12 wasn't ever buffed specifically. Nor was the destruction buff to shotguns a ninja one. It was in the patch notes and going off the ubi twitter the test to shotguns was announced.  The fo-12 is infact not a sniper as it shoots buckshot. Two does the lowest damage per pellet than every other primary shotgun. And three is actually the wprst primary shotgun for range as it does the lowest damage there. Every single other shotgun does more damage at both cqc and long ranges than the fo-12. So no it's not ridiculous. It's a good gun sure but it's the only good thing Ela has left which is pathetic. If you think Ela can spawn peak with the most mediocre pistol in game and the scorpion which is the only primary without a recoil diamond you must be joking.
---
That is a Subreddit rule by the sub's mods. Ubisoft/R6S team cannot ban anyone from Reddit.

1. if someone on your team has four kills that round already or says “dont steal my ace” you better let him/her get the last kill 2. if an enemy is down and the teammate that downed them is still alive, dont kill the enemy unless its a doc or zofia
---
Goyo’s Volcanos are pretty useful towards the end of the round. I forget how long they block the area but I usually pop the entry way ones with 30 seconds on the clock and watch whichever way isn’t on fire.

That’s been a thing since...like forever. It’s a really rare occurrence because the window has to already be cracked enough for you to enter or you have to catch someone rotating past an open window like a lemming.

Unfortunately, banning ddossers is almost impossible due to the fact that they can make new accounts in a matter of seconds and most likely they know how to change their ip in a matter of seconds too

---
You’ve never seen it? I’m pretty sure this feature’s only on PC. So that might explain it, i’m an ex console player and i don’t see these when i’m playing.
---
I would like to point out that with this pattern, we won’t see a day when all operators in the game will have Elite uniform. Ubi have to speed up the release of elites to change this.

Ok buddy sure, first of all seasonal skins vary season to season there were four in burnt horizon, four in phantom sight, four in operation para bellum. Do your research the seasonal skins vary. Also if all you are worried about is the cosmetics and how much new skins are in the game each season that's really dumb. Maybe they are working less on that to improve the game in areas that matter, cheating, ddosing, better match making, releasing balanced ops that don't take months to balance. That is one of the prime reasons fro weapons reused. It took 6 months to balance out capitao's para 308. At first it was op then they nerfed it to hell, then it was balanced. With warden, nook, amaru, goyo you don't have this because they have already balanced the weapons so all they have to balance is the ability, which is great because then we won't get a new lion situation. I would be perfectly ok with no new cosmetics in the game and them fixing the issues they have because cosmetics aren't important and there are already so many (and if they reuse weapons I can use skins I already have). Your point is very shallow and superficial and I really don't think anyone will take it seriously, least of all the devs.
---
Jackal, Buck, Zofia, Capitao, Gridlock
---
Just play Multiplayer THunt.
---
~120 renown in a few minutes if you only play Classic
---
Thanks
---
Sure maybe for boosting others I would agree with you. But for a vast majority of console players, they probably watched a video on how to do it and thought to themselves "Hey, this is easy and I don't see what they will do about it" and just use their main accounts so they can get that sweet sweet virtual badge that means nothing.

But you aren't wrong with what you said, especially on PC.

These are my stats not stunning but I have been a ranked Montagne main since I started playing. I play other characters very rarely. This makes me cannon fodder and means frags are low and death Chance is high. It makes it so difficult for me to find a ranked crew in group posts because everyone turns be away for my KD with out letting me explain I’m a support player. I play well on defense but I just can’t pull enough kills with Mr. Mountain to keep my KD up it’s starting to get in my nerves but idk what to do.  I love playing Montagne and don’t want to change.

Just pull down your stick alot and use compesator and holo cook grenade and wallbang people with grenade

The guy I replied to say Ela's was CONFIRMED when Mira's was, but she wasn't.

She was leaked around the same time Mira's was announced.

Don't listen to those fricks. Monty mains are bae and are probably the better side of the community. K.D means nothing.

2 minutes later....pass the plates around

That offended me because I’m a sweat but how isn’t pick and ban a good thing it eliminates thatcher a thermite on maps like chalet and makes garage easier to hold but than there are lower elo players I guess just banning jackal Monty and blitz
---
Flash is the best sight to use on it.

I use the angled + acog but most people use vertical ACOG

Wait wouldn’t sledge have more utility then buck cause he can sledge things like castle maestro and other things or am I dumb
---
Ok thanks my guy
---
I'll play with you if you want man. I'm a clash main, my overall and seasonal kd sucks for the same reason. I know how to play the game without her now, and I learned how to push in without a shield. I'd recommend learning new ops when you're having a good game because of monty being banned so often.
---
i should also say, i main twitch and ela, so good choice
---
Glaz for sure. Plus he has more armor sets to choose from
---
ranked multiplayer is the most efficient way to earn renown, maybe even the unranked playlist but can’t confirm, not tried it yet man
---
I feel for ya brother
---
Ayyyye
---
Playlist wise there’s not much you can do to increase renown rate unless you have a booster; however I would recommend finishing the Situations; each one gives some renown the first time you finish it. In addition to that, try to make an effort to finish daily challenges and weekly challenges. It’s a slow process but you should be able to see the renown grow
---
Yeah but if he's lagging he's standing still and if you kill him it doesnt matter what his ping is he will die. I play with high ping and I used to get killed behind cover a lot, because the server dictates what's really happening and if I shoot someone at the exactly time they shoot me, they have like 9ms ping so their kill will be recognized by the server and my shot (because according to the server it happened right after I was dead) will be ignored
---
&gt; Or free for money
---
Granted, having Season Pass is worth it to me since this is like the one game I play still.
---
But, she’s my mom.
---
Yes, obviously. He's saying he'd like it to be in game that you can see when your teammate is planting
---
You can pretend that leaking = partial confirmation though(confirmation that elite will be in the game, we just don’t know when)
---
Stop the queue after a minute or so and try again.
---
When shadow doesn’t match its surroundings
---
Yeah, that's not a great response bucko. Especially not for a competitive game renowned for having competitively unbalanced maps.
---
Those report buttons do nothing.
---
That's just statistically incorrect.
---
That is legit 11/10 play
---
If you have any sense in the game Maverick can be heard pretty well even if a distance away, he doesnt have a counter because his gadget isnt electronics based, its just hardware. Yeah he can be annoying to fight against but him and jackal have the same arguement essentially since there is no real way to PREVENT him from scanning you unless you kill him same with Maverick. Jackal is annoying since he shows EVERYONE where you are at, Maverick on the other hand just deals with reinforcements but takes way longer than hibana and thermite to chew through them. If you have headphones on the sound generated by Maverick is pretty decently loud, go test it in game if you want but its a hard comparing Maverick to Jackal since one is a hard breacher who can be heard and Jackal who can scan you a minute into round when you first went to get a hatch or move to a spot to spawn peek or something.
---
What do you mean? Smoke shotgun is his normal load out because you have the SMG-11 as your "primary"

**thicc** video game girls*

They should change the game name to Team America and friends.

How can they trace DDoS attacks back to the person? Don't you need concrete evidence? Sorry been out of the loop on this.
---
That would be sweet if they added crossplay for mouse and keyboard users across all platforms.
---
REEEEEEEEE

Besides if you complain about Maverick, a good counter is turning your volume up and just listen for him :)

Is it just people being banned for cheating

---
I'll make a post now.
---
Vigil really needs a buff soon, his ability is virtually useless
---
Shields should be strong but also have a super hard counter. So great you get an ace with blitz, next round the enemy team can pick a niche hard counter and that plan wont work again. Like you wouldnt normally run a warden but if the enemy team smacks you with a top teir ying 3 rounds in a rough i bet your picking jager and warden. They either need to make shields fun again but hard counterable or just remove them entirely. Just give monty the alda lmg and the ability to smadh through barricades when sprinting and give blitz the 416 and just give him the ability to have a blinding flashlight on his gun.
---
"Hit corners and shoot style" what is this you speak of?

Unless you are in pro league. You can pretty much do what you want. Bucko.

I'm sold at the gun and less recoil. Thanks for finalizing it for me
---
If it's pay to win, that's a problem with the developers, not the target audience.
---
I don't believe you!
---
I love how you checked his level
---
Good job! Keep it up
---
Black Ice &lt;3
---
So it's just to fix bugs and stuff and will only be down for about 20mins?
---
Well attempting to. In the US, UK and EU, DDOS's are illegal and result in actual jail time.
---
That reminded me of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air when Uncle Phil tosses Jazz out of the house.  In this case, from a building.
---
I would say play on normal and focus on getting headshots, practice recoil control and practice your overall movement. T-Hunt is also a good time to explore the maps and get to know them. Map knowledge in this game is huge!
---
ADS: This stands for Aim Down Sights. The act up pulling up your weapon to look down the scope.
---
Kills are also referred to as frags. So someone who gets kills is called a fragger.
---
A re-frag is when someone gets killed but their team mate is there to take out the person who killed them.
---
Any other questions just let me know.
---
Villa is balanced.
---
maybe try to add rust or dent on the sign idk like it not brand new  give it character  n for the background smoke  the moon  you know like  something is hidden in the smoke and the dark of the night
---
But can we get a fix on the audio bug, please?
---
"Hang on let me finish this level real quick and that's a gun barrel"
---
wait until the ela elite comes out then.
---
Yea you got robbed.  Didn't even have the yellow/red indicators either.
---
I've wondered that as well. Maybe because on a shitty tv or without headphones it would cause a severe disadvantage? Idk. I feel like this game requires headphones to be played correctly. 
---
Sound seems like a logical step in ops. It would make zofia, mav, and Nokk more interesting if they did a listening device defender.
---
im actually getting motion sickness from watching from this clip, holy shit. what the hell is this FOV.
---
IQ detects electronics.. valk’s cams are... *electronic*..
---
Locked together in an eternal embrace
---
I think he means iq taking out valk cams
---
Ranked sadly
---
&gt;If you have any sense in the game Maverick can be heard pretty well even if a distance away, he doesnt have a counter because his gadget isnt electronics based, its just hardware. Yeah he can be annoying to fight against but him and jackal have the same arguement essentially since there is no real way to PREVENT him from scanning you unless you kill him same with Maverick. 
---
Seems like you solved your problem.
---
Kill him.
---
He has to come to you. Is it that hard to bait him, considering that he know where you are only for the first split second of the first second of the 5 second interval of his ping?
---
&gt;Jackal is annoying since he shows EVERYONE where you are at, Maverick on the other hand just deals with reinforcements but takes way longer than hibana and thermite to chew through them. If you have headphones on the sound generated by Maverick is pretty decently loud, go test it in game if you want but its a hard comparing Maverick to Jackal since one is a hard breacher who can be heard and Jackal who can scan you a minute into round when you first went to get a hatch or move to a spot to spawn peek or something.
---
See you got it right there. If mav's counter is sound, produced by his own gadget, jackal's is the refresh rate of his own ping because of which he never really knows where you are. Easy to bait.
---
And like I said, if he was really that much of a pain, he'd either be banned heavily or picked heavily at the highest level of play. Clearly, from the data, he isn't. You still haven't given me your reasoning for this.
---
Annoyance, irritation and frustration do not count as credible bases for long term balancing changes. Those are personal emotions and need to be overcome by the person. You need data for changes, and for obvious reasons, data says otherwise.
---
I make my own statistics on my games, and this week was something else
---
I am high plat (P1) on PS4 currently and from my 67 Matches 23 got ddosed. 
---
I already made thease statistics last season and last season i only got ddosed 18 times, out of 274 matches. So nowhere close. 
---
I think it's due to the new MMR limits for Partys, so people no longer can smurf their way do diamond. 
---
15 times the server crashed, so at least i didn't lost elo
---
2 times I had ddoses in my team, so i gained elo
---
2 times I've beaten ddosers (very bad ddosers)
---
2 times I got ddosed with an additional abandon sanction
---
1 time i had ddosers/stressers that made me wait 20 minutes until they had won their 3 defenses. 
---
1 match I had a ddoser team vs another ddoser team (took them to round 6 until they realised, that one teams gonna crash the server anyway)
---
Best streak so far, was 7 games without any issues. 
---
Worst streak was 8 games in a row that got ddosed or stressed with an abandon sanction at the end as the cherry on the cake. 
---
Additional my game crashed 4 times in game (This is also very new, and has something to do with the UBIsoft center, as soon as you enter it, you can be sure, that you crash the next game)
---
I really really hope, that this is gonne get better, otherwise I have to stop playing, ur smurf my way down to gold and lose intentionally. Idk, but this is not fun at all.
---
Oh ya I forgot their gadgets I thought you meant iq literally blew up valks house
---
It shouldn’t even be a thing! Simple, ping more than 100 on this server? Yes? Can’t play on it find another. Region lock people. Idunno one of a thousand solutions. It’s absurd.
---
I wouldn't care that much about your stats but more about someone being that hard stuck on one operator. Being flexible is very important in Siege. What if monty gets banned (which he gets a decent amount). Monty doesn't work that well on every site/map.
---
I've done it lots of times with valk and ela. I think it's happened once or twice with attackers too, but that was at super long range through walls and such.
---
ohh
---
My 1st 2 elite skins I bought made me realize I have a type as well. *Germans*
---
Was that ranked or unranked
---
I am the absolute pinnacle of comedy
---
Shoes that got wheelies, fell on my back and broke all my feelies
---
Portable, but still requiring attachment to bars, counters, ledges, and shields?
---
There's jack shit you can do in a 1v1 against Monty. Fuck him.
---
You can have 100 ping going from east to west US lol
---
Loooooooool
---
T H I C C BLONDES
---
Nokk is in the danish frogmen corps.
---
your type is men that look like recruit lol
---
Then lock them from playing across the US. Today’s day and age internet is good enough to play eh servers from west coast US with under 150 ping. If you can’t play across the country with less than 100 that’s your problem.

TrUe 100

( ͡°( ͡° ͜ʖ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ʖ ͡°) ͡°)
---
That's why I play unranked
---
Yeah, but I’m assuming that they’re banned and people aren’t surprised that they were
---
karens?
---
Hot blondes isn't really much of a type...
---
4 3 2 1 0
---
It does count as griefing tho, its a term basically meaning, ruining something, so :/
---
the Apex game engine is much newer and better run. Siege's engine is old and it's not exactly great
---
100 isn’t even that bad lmao
---
Oh
---
I don't want to.
---
That's one way to announce defeat.
---
I am confused how everybody died 4/5 times even though you lost 2 times and won the rest 4,     what happened?
---
Nooperator
---
The only attacker ban that is consistent is Jackal. Blitz hardly gets banned because of how unreliable shields are now.
---
Plus (D)DoSing is illegal. You can pay up to $10,000 usd in fines and spend 2-5 years in jail

This is my exact same screen, its disturbing
---
he should get 2 of them, can walk with it but need to stop walking to shoot or aim BUT REALLY QUICKLY, he should be really really a supressive operator, this can be good
---
I don't believe Ubi said anything about that happening, though it would be cool
---
It's all good bro
---
Perfectly balanced... as all things should be.
---
This is the best thing ever. Sadly, no one will do that. It’s my least favourite part of new ranked
---
There aren't any servers in Africa for R6, they wouldn't be able to play then. Another solution must be found
---
It absolutley can, there is no reason why it couldnt. It literally does it when you open your operator menu. The only limit here is the time ubisoft is willing to dedicate to it.
---
Sry bro
---
I could only ever see warden being used if Jager’s banned, but that only helps him on site, not to mention frag grenades.
---
I got those also, money well spent
---
Server maintenance maybe?
---
Had a message for it on console just a little bit ago and it's still not back up.
---

I don’t think they are up atm the servers cause I’m still connecting so I would just play something else for a bit

Thanks for being level headed in your response compared to the other guy. I guess luck could be part of it, but for me it feels like any shooter out there. Luck is all part of the spray and pray life hehe
---
Their whole reasoning is to try to make you play the same maps to get you  more acclimated to play ranked for some reason. Not sure why they want you to play ranked instead of fun maps in casual, maybe people that play ranked more buy more cosmetics? idk
---
I ain't got no type, nah, bad bitches is the only thing that I like.
---
That's what I don't think people understand. It's unranked. It's not supposed to be super serious and thought out. Some people just want to have fun. And being stun locked in any game is not fun.
---
Don’t forget the p90 with no muzzle
---
Shouldn’t be a problem if you don’t team kill. Also stops squads from taking turns TK ransoms.

What does a professional cosplayer do? People like pay you to go to events and stuff?

Good you should be trying to retrieve it back before commenting on the internet with idiotic statements. Hope you get well soon bro.

I had this problem as well, it's because it's starting with a different resolution from your monitor, to fix it go in: explore files, documents, my games, rainbow six siege, gamesetting.ini and change the resolution from the one that's there to your monitor default resolution. Cheers!

0 speed 4 armor in turret

There isnt enough buttons, at least on console. It would be a pc exclusive thing

Oh sorry, it was me, going to take it back in a min.

that can be viable aswell
---
Should’ve teleported with the wonder pearl
---
It's a great excuse for ubi to not actually balance these ops.
---
It was the Jager who died to a grenade. Ironic.
---
I get notifications on my phone everytime i complete a challange, and the second my phone lights go on, my ps4 goes out. So i think you are right about the ubiclub
---
My reaction was more "whelp time to get a new main"  
---
Gotta say her Vector is the shit tho
---
You can kinda see the goyo thing through the slits if you look hard enough
---
I have multiple elites, and I think that it is worth it, many of the skins are good in my opinion
---
Was it worth it,yes if you use certain ops 
---
Why ?
---
It adds a cool Uniform and animation to the ops that you love using 
---
Do you need it
---
It’s totally optional if you want to buy it,But I highly recommend buying Elite for ops you use more
---
PS4 my dude
---
Compromise: remove Lesion's Gu wallhacks and force Lesion mains to get good
---
And? That doesn't mean that he would have Ak with bolt on left side. Like if it is a custom one, than maybe..
---
Sksksksk
---
Depends who you are and what you like. Personally, the elites are worth it for me because I mostly spend time on Siege, and don't often spend money on other games or hobbies or anything. Also depends if you like the skin.
---
How exactly does having a better play carry you to a higher rank gonna make you a better player?
---
Oh wow wow wow my friend! Ease up! I made a request, and I clearly meant no offense. You don't have to get so worked up over a simple "punctuations please". I could have asked you to f**k off with your f$ckwit f_ckery if I wanted to but that would be indecent and uncalled for. I tried to keep it as civil as possible and chose not to insult you one bit as I noticed that you were keeping it civil as well, making it purely about the discussion, and censoring any and every swear word as it is a safer practice.
---
But if you want it that way, I am happy to oblige to level the playing field and you can be damn well sure that you'll regret it.
---
Lastly....

Poor Noban!
---
Something interesting that I've noticed. If you look at Mira's model with the R6 Invitational skin she's flat paper. With her elite skin she's thicc enough to give IQ and Ela a run for their money.
---
Nope sorry my friend... I‘d also like to buy the skins i missed...
---
c'mon bruh. Just enjoy the game, ELO system is meant for giving you decent matches and not a rewarding system
---
I mean, they can. But that would be really mean and classified as physical assault.
---
You won’t be in the frontpage because it’s not a copper play
---
Yeah he did miss, but at the same time, I feel like melee kills are too hard to hit in siege.
---
Make her kiss to interrogate to get the positions of all attackers, and also reveal the positions for the next round of start.

Ubisoft said they increased the chance of a pellet landing in the inner ring of its spread diameter. This basically means if (like most people) you put your crosshair center mass of a target then the pellets are more likely to hit the target and are more likely to hit upper body instead of legs.
---
Ela cosplay is THICC!
---
Yeah it's happening for all Xbox players. They delayed the patch for Xbox which was meant to have finished an hour and a half ago and they haven't said anything else.

Thank you for your response. It makes me happy that positive feedback is 2/2 on my post and not negative.
---
Okay bruh, do i just hope to get better playing bronze matches?
---
In short, call needs no changes.

Mpx is fine. Warden is the problem. Valky is fine as well.
---
There was never a time when fortnite didn’t succ booty cheeks.

I’d probably say to focus on aim, leaning, and recoil control since those are the things you probably aren’t going to have a great feel for in Rainbow on PC. Terrorist hunt on realistic can help, but I personally think it only helps so much since they don’t really play and move like an actual person would. When I’m trying to work on aim I like a mix of realistic terrorist hunt, casual, and unranked and I like to use the SMG-11 a lot. It has a small clip and a high rate of fire so it kinda forces you to be accurate and get headshots. It also has a lot of vertical recoil so it’s going to make you pay if you aren’t pulling down. Plus if you’re good with it, it’s an amazing gun so while working on your aim you’re also honing your skills specifically on a gun that it really pays to be skilled with.
---
It’s okay mine is almost identical - weapon skins

This post makes no sense. First if a game is ddossed then it won’t count toward your placements. The only way for them to count is if they ddossed you and not the server and you disconnected. If you mean stressing the server then yeah that sucks. Secondly the season and rank reset just happened and it won’t happen again still next season. Thirdly if you placed plat 3 and are plat 1 right now then how will you not be able to reach diamond? I understand people will stress and hit the servers off but you have plenty of time to reach diamond as this is only like the third week of the new season
---
Last week I played against and with similarly skilled players. Started playing again yesterday and got matched with people that barely installed the game. Did they remove hidden MMR?
---
Been meaning to ask, how about the animation? Is that your next step? Or is the animation already there and I am just slightly rarted.
---
They made it less frustrating in phantom sight, now your bullet only travels through 1 wall before been stopped, before you could be headshot through multiple walls just because someone wanted to open a barricade

I wish :( Ubi, please love me.
---
A completely new engine only for this game will never be done, it's way too expensive and would probably be even more buggy than currently for many years.
---
But I can definitely see Ubi using this game as their cash cow for the next dozen years or so by putting even more dumb shit into it
---
There's no animation for now, as the software to design the watch doesn't have a feature to implement it. I would have to learn to use their more advanced tizen studio. I really want to do it, but currently my watchface isn't even being approved by the validation team, so I want to fix it. The problem is I would have to remove the R6 logo and the eagle in order to put it on the store, and that's what makes the watchface Warden's watchface.
---
his Vulcan shields are really annoying to deal with as well, not only does it give the defenders cover but it also deals huge amounts of damage to the enemy and grants entry and area denial, fuck a Kapkan and Goyo can one hit kill someone, really great for those last minute pushes along with Smoke

Additionally, she can jump up the dining room hatch while people push double doors, and the sound of her rappelling up, distracts the enemy from the real push and they get destroyed.
---
Pussy boiz be scared.
---
?
---
I'd pay for it xD
---
Why do you have both hands on the keyboard?
---
i want the ELA one
---
I think if the option to ban operators were there, people would use it. Doesn’t hurt to add a feature like that, even if used by less competitive players.
---
Do you have the original post for this vid?
---
Echo seems like a pretty easy one, lots of things you could do with him playing with his drone kind of like how Twitch’s is, maybe adding the sound and a quick/reduced version of the effect at some point.  Sure some would be better than others but that’s already the case, I mean Ash is just on the phone and puts her finger up for fuck’s sake. For the most part, the ones having to do with the gadget(like Jager, Thermite, Twitch, Sledge, especially Glaz) are way cooler than most of the others like Thatcher dropping from a helicopter for some reason or Doc just holding a flag and a pipe while music plays.

I don't understand why people don't use a mic. Do you really rather hear me tell you to put a fucking mic in you scrub every game?
---
You'll find a few different thought processes when people encounter them
---
* "Fuck that shit I'm out" these people see the mirror and flee, you kill them, or you'll never see them again.
---
* Some will try and gun fight you despite being severely disadvantaged. 
---
* Some will try to destroy the mirror, mainly hibana. 
---
* Some will creep in front of it, hoping you aren't actually behind that mirror.
---
* Very few will go vertical and effectively deal with you.
---
Wow, that's is amazing! Keep up the good work!
---
Im gay and i love both those skins cause they look beautiful
---
Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh noooooo.

I just skipped to the end.

So the skipping was definitely worth it.

Restart your Xbox, you shpuld see the update

Thank you so much!

She works well with a team and she has frags now so she's pretty balanced

This is why everyone needs to watch that siege school episode

Young Karens?
---
So you’re talking about casual? Most people, including myself, don’t try too hard in casual. I’m plat 2 and I have some really bad games lol
---
Ive been gaming for a very long time and SSD's aren't some lifechanging technology, its most useful for your OS really. All games I play load completely fine on HDD. If Siege basically requires an SSD then thats poor optimization on their part. I also highly doubt 9/10 players are using an SSD.
---
This. Other players must hate carrying me, I am SO shit at this game. But occasionally I just wreck shop and it's those moments that keep me playing.

I’m just pulling ya leg, there are good players out there
---
Driver issue maybe. Try updating or reverting to an older version.
---
For real? Server boosters are done for?
---
How brave!
---
This is the absolute truth. The Elite skins drop way too slow. We should at least be getting 3 per season.

---
Not good, but easy.
---
I just nutted
---
Who uses fuse with shield for real though
---
Clash is overpowered for one reason:
---
Let's put you in a situation. You're an operator with no explosive capability in a 1v1 against a clash. You've killed a few people, but you're at 25 HP now because they got a few shots off on you. You manage to get through all the barbed wire and destroy all the lesion mines in your way to the objective. You're in the site with the defuser, and you hear her coming from the other site.
---
Now she holds RT for a few seconds.
---
You're dead, and she can't take any damage from you.
---
Anyways, what I'm saying is, she should not be able to inflict damage with her shield. But that shouldn't be the only thing done to her. She definitely would need a pretty big buff to some aspect of her if the shield can't do damage anymore. Maybe multiply the "magazine" of her shield by two or three times. Maybe people are a bit slower when you attack them. Something like that.
---
Yo thx for the hot tip 👌
---
Man this is the worst thing they’ve done as far as I can remember. I haven’t played for a while but this sucks.
---
Ok sorry about caps but when you report them they will verify to ban or not
---
I bought it back when Elites were sparse. It's pretty bland TBH, and the camo is terrible.
---
Which drivers do you mean? Nvidia?
---
I was being sarcastic. So why don't you r/whoosh right back into your own god damn business.

The way server changing was done was by manipulating a custom game’s server location and then quitting, leaving you in that region (ex: changing from WUS to SCUS).  This was patched as it was never intended.
---
Fanboys.
---
Or just scroll through the feed, I've already explained it twice
---
Put the wall reinforcer pattern on it you know the red and grey horizontal pattern.
---
The hype from your team might be the best part of that clip
---
I agree completely. Have they ever modified an elite skin from a leak?
---
Dont think so sadly
---
They can’t detect Dossers bud. I just said it, you can use the report button, yet the game isn’t going to see anything.
---
This sucks... do you know if the rotation thing is temporarily or permanent? Casual should have access to everything and that goddam matchmaking preference should be working.
---
You like blonds
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
I can literally feel the thirst building up. Watch out
---
An ace is still an ace
---
So you’re 12?
---
I'm glad I don't have to play on most of those maps anymore but I do think they should have just left casual alone, especially since they added unranked
---
Why would you take the time to ask Reddit before restarting your game? That’s gaming 101 if something’s wrong
---
Here’s a snack.
---
No. Fuck clash
---
Is it possible Ela's elite may have changes? Personally, I'd like a unique hairstyle and either a different jacket, or no jacket.
---
Nah, I’m not really a cop. They’re too strong for me to be one.
---
Echo’s paid leave is finally over lol
---
They used to have a rematch option, which both teams had to vote for. It's been there.
---
Matchmaking preference should be working. I had this game since season 1 and they haven’t fixed that shit since then. I only like 4 maps I would like to just play them. Skyscraper, Plane, House and Favela.
---

---
Nah man I’m not a YouTuber
---
Edit: never realized there was a r6 YouTuber with a similar name lol
---
My type is short thicc girls with mental issues; also yanderes to an extent.
---
Nothing transfers between platforms mate, sorry.
---
Yeah literally maybe a few bytes of code is all it would take, the models are already there
---
Yo this is actually top tier. Usually legendaries suck. I want this.
---
Bah it's empty but I'd be tempted to fill it with a kno3 suger mix smoke bomb with some yellow organic pigment great for a photoshoot
---
What are you talking about ? Those are the real thing dude
---
It's me!
---
well you aren't the only on with that problem so you should be able to find similar teammates. you either need to gain rank or your friends need to drop rank. everyone knew this change was coming and everyone was asking for this change. not the game's fault that you couldn't keep up with your friends
---
Haggis.
---
It's haggis.
---
It's best you don't ask.
---
Doesn't sound smart.
---
Things take time, be patient with some of the fixes.
---
I've made both variants of Smoke's gas grenades; his regular one, with yellow tape, and his new Elite one with red.
---
I knew it
---
what are you on about? there isn't anything wrong with the game. just you
---
Do you 3D print all the pieces? Some of these are incredibly accurate
---
It's been constant aggravation so far. I recently got 4 kills in the first round of the match and then was TK'd by an Ash and then she killed herself. Following it up with another 4k the next round my team couldn't manage to kill the last guy. I try not to blame my teammates too much I probably should have been able to ace, but I mean... c'mon...
---
I do when I wanna be toxic, any other time it's the AK.
---
Play Clash then
---
Why annoy enemy with flashbang once when you could annoy multiple enemies multiple times, all behind cover?
---
Not to be toxic, but kick em
---
Omg ur dick
---
This. Ubisoft can't track what words are said in voice chat but they do ban people if you send proof of someone griefing.
---
I was just mimicking the format I was replying to. *asterisks*
---
It's a 4 man group dicking around. They also enjoy TK solo ques.

Sometimes it's toxic players.  More often, it's just that players don't know how long it's going to take you to load in.  If it's holding up a round, better to kick someone and get the round started than play "loading player roulette" and possibly lose much more time.
---
You cannot name an operatoer Bolt and not have him be 3 speed
---
not correct. at least pc doesn’t have a ddos problem
---
Yep! Aside from some electronics in a few of them, i.e. the LEDs and the control boards for the HEL, every part is 3D-printed and modelled by me.
---
I use mostly FDM printing on my Prusa Mk3S, but some have resin-printed parts that use UV-reactive resin. Much higher detail, but longer print time.
---
Good lord I would hate those pop ups after every kill.
---
He spawn peeked so yes it it
---
So it just people being asshole then
---
Yeah with the help of your teammates holding the common rotations near her.
---
I’m no genius but that doesn’t add up, you either didn’t have three aces or you meant a 3 not a 4 kill, but that would also mean that you would to have gotten those in 4 of your 8 rounds which means that you would have had to be killed without any kills for 4 rounds which is highly unlikely if you got 3 aces in one hame
---
Let's complain lol. I want different hair and a different jacket, or no jacket (possibly just remove the shoulder pauldron).
---
I don't use mic just cuz i'm about being yelled at for being young
---
Siege 🤝 Overwatch
---
Totally.. Nothing wrong at all!
---
Be prepared for the DDOS more than xbox (in my experience)
---
Fuze charges deploy 5 grenades in a fan pattern, from right to left (from Fuze's perspective). You ran across the fan to it's right, where a grenade had just finished detonating, which was somehow now the safest spot in the room.  What amazes me is that you managed to sprint that fast without being weighed down by the enormous balls you're clearly packing. 
---
Slightly unrelated sidenote:  the 3rd grenade pops out straight, perpendicular to the wall it's attached to, which I think is how Fuze put a grenade through the door to down your teammate.
---
I dont wanna be rude or smthn because you did a fucking great job but that snoke canister could have looked better if you would have matched the colors, anyway keep doing what are you doing. Btw try tachanka lmg, I wanna see that in a full size
---
Do that on a raptorstrike
---
Yeah that is a super good argument, and I agree with you on what you're saying, but in low ranks and casual, Ash is extremely op in action, even though she isn't on paper. Her easy recoil and really fast firerate makes for a gun that makes everyone seem like a pro. I would say that a good medium might be increasing the ADS time just enough to be noticable. but not enough to make her useless.
---
Keep up? We played all our placements together... thought we'd be at least close. I get it tho it is a good change for the game as a whole and my problems aren't the majority most likely. I'm glad it seems to be working out for the majority.
---
Haven't had any problems \*yet\*.
---
On the customs forms, when requested, I always specify it's a PLASTIC COSPLAY PROP. Haven't had MI6 knock on my door yet ahaha
---
I wrote that wrong sorry I got 2 aces a 4 man and 2 bombs not being defused
---
😳🤤🤤🤤🤤🤩🤩🤩🤩 sorry for the emojis but that’s freakin awesome
---
You actually model the 3D image yourself? That’s even more impressive
---
Tachanka turret next please!
---
Mr. Worldwide looks like pulse
---
Yeah it has really helped me and my group rank up as when you want to play ranked but not all 5 of us are on we play unranked meaning no unnecessary rank drops or anyone being to high to play with everyone else
---
Exactly it´s just a small indie company guys, they really don´t have the budget for trying to chance and work on the engine. I mean they barely get money from the ppl who are buying r6-credits or the game in generall
---
I main smoke and I have the elite, but somehow didn't notice that it was the elite canister.  
---
I might be retarded.
---
Great
---
I, got a shot gun skin. For twitch. That i already had.
---
Yo, what the fuck
---
Exactly
---
so this is nothing special like most cosplay
---
the game has a soft MMR reset now. so if you played all 10 placements with your friends then you had a huge MMR gap last season. this new system was made so teams like yours can't play together
---
Yep. Each one of my props I've modelled myself.
---
The first prop for RS6 I modelled was Finka's mask. Since then, I've began making more gadgets and props for fantastic cosplayers like Camcamzoro, Simon(Hanjosi), Aspira, AgentCivi, EmWhyt, Opal, etc.
---
First echo, cav, jackal and blitz, then the new ops, now nooperator
---
Two in one. The only thing that changes is length of the resulting ban. That way, if it truly was an accident you can still be forgiven. 
---
Not that its 100% your fault but for future reference, callout where and when you're picking, even if playing with randoms. Then you did your job and it's on them.
---
Ahh smart
---
she doesn't have an ar
---
Sure if you wanna believe that
---
How did u know it was him?
---
I was in the same game. I am denizkartal
---
You really think Ubisoft would allow the developers to do such a thing? That takes time and resources they would rather go into cosmetics they shit out every month.
---
you just summarized this sub
---
*stonks*
---
Do you sell the fuze one?
---
One life thing works in CS, but because the rounds are shorter. 1.55 + some time to buy weapons. Meanwhile in siege you have 3 mins of round + 45 of prep phase + 30 of op pick. And if you get spawnpeeked from 4 diffrent windows on consulate you just sit there watching drones for 3 mins. Also there are less rounds in a match, so it just feels like you get less action than in cs.
---
you can't witch hunt here. submit to R6Fix because posting this here is 100% pointless.

Probably. It’s also one example. I use her all the time to great effect with my friends. She just needs some coordination. I guarantee she will be played in pro league.

You realize "target" doesn't mean 100%, certainly, positively going to happen.
---
It was a 4K

I don’t get it, this sub shits on people who post aces but this is highly upvoted? I mean, happy you got it to work OP but this is a very common spot and I just don’t understand why this is so high up in the sub

Operators drop in price by 5000 renown every four seasons, to a minimum price of 10000 renown.

But, to avoid doing the math on all that, a moderator on the Rainbow6 discord made a handy graphic that keeps track of this stuff and gets updated each season! Which you can find here: https://siege.dangeraspect.xyz/operatorprices

What a band aid solution. Instead of fixing the real problem, the nonsense RFF which almost is never consistent, they opt to make the freaking hostage fire resistant. Too add insult to injury they made him universally fire resistant as they couldn't even be bothered to implement code that distinguishes between capitao and goyo. The amount of lazy shortcuts, baffling number of user hostile descisions and the bizzare number of bugs that re-emerge leads me to either two conclusions. Either Ubisoft is made up of wholly incapable people, which I refuse to even acknowledge because of their AAA status they seem to enjoy so much, or the game engine at use is exceptionally hard to use and implement features which leads to the tower of band aids we have today called r6 siege. With the amount of micro transactions and extra season passes and other frankly disgusting gambling purchases this game has, Ubisoft needs to get their shit together and fix their broken game, make Operation Health 2: Revengence and last it for a damn year if they have to. Anyway I'm pissed off and the bumpy bus ride that takes 7 hours might have something to do with it as well but my fine points still stand as sensible inarguablr truths posted on an internet board thingy.

Iv had 6 apple devices thank you very much. Each one of them went thru the shit of them sending an update to cap the battery percentage for "safety reasons"(which is bullshit cuz batteries degrade overtime to a point where they can't overcharge to cause a safety issue) not to mention the updates that they were caught on for purposely slowing down their old devices. Im sorry but i just cant justify their money grubbiness anymore...not to mention they are 2 generations behind samsung when compared parts wise and charging as if they were top of the line
---
Probably Ash. Unpopular opinion, oh no! I can't go a single match without someone going Ash. I need some variety. She's so overly used and I found a way to counter her. It makes the game boring when people constantly go Ash.
