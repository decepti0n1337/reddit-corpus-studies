It‚Äôs okay... check Hibana or Glaz pl sets for example

Very unfortunate timing
---
Rly nice spot

You killed him with your bad vibes

i played from op health until grim sky pretty much daily with my friends. after the recoil change we only got on the game to get our platinum, dont even care about diamond anymore and. we stopped playing the game once a season entirely after phantom sight. we miss this game tbh but  we cant get ourselfs to play with this recoil
---
Every seasonal skin is only available for the weapons in the game at the time of the season.
---
Imagine not using the m870 you have disapppinted recruits everywhere.
---
Yea, I'd like Para Bellum back

Daaaamnn boyyyy he **THICC**

‚ÄúWhy is it a competition‚Äù *immediately makes it a competition of frequency*
---
They didn‚Äôt bow down to Tachanka
---
oh, have they said they're going to be doing a battlepass? I missed that if so
---
I‚Äôve found a quick fix for it is switching to another drone then switching back right away. I agree though, it‚Äôs a fucking pain.

Hit Q then E or RB/R1 then LB/L1 for console and usually it will spot the bomb then

Nah, its 50 per bomb to whomever found it.

It looks like kingsman from spider man, and it is amazing

Why does it do that tho smh

---
Not here it isn‚Äôt and again, what freaking society are you living in? Because the human race is still pretty universally shitty when it comes to sexism and the like. Also the dictionary definition says literally nothing about biology so stop arguing semantics. Masculine is not objective. Maybe it has a specific definition within the field of bio-psychology, but that is not by any means the most common definition. 
---
Also behavioral neuroscience has precious little to say about the behavior of humans considering that the subjects of their studies are primarily mice and other animals. Because you can‚Äôt go futzing around in someone‚Äôs brain. So they‚Äôre going specifically for broad topics and basic behavioral patterns shared across many species of animal. Do I really have to explain why that isn‚Äôt incredibly applicable to any of this?
---
Also there‚Äôs literally never been a time when these issues didn‚Äôt exist in some form or another. So I guess we‚Äôve been failing since the day we started then. I‚Äôm assuming you also don‚Äôt believe that gender is separate from biological sex? Because with your line of thinking there‚Äôs no other option.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a huge problem before so they didn‚Äôt spend 5 years working on it. It should be fixed for Y5S1

I was just making a joke, mate. I'm not that thick.
---
That gadget name kinda doo doo
---
It is better with the current round rotation system especially for ranked, it allows for more consistency and strategic play. Whereas in casual it adds the same things if you want, but if you don't want more consistent and strategic play in casual then the rotation makes no difference as you have the same number of attacking and defense rounds.
---
Only Bad Thing about Fortress are all those Long halleways, Else i Love the structure and the feel of this map
---
Nah, you just seem to think women believe racism is less bad than sexism while it has nothing to do with that. It has *everything* to do with frequency. I know for a fact I'd get harassed less if I didn't have a female voice - better yet, if I don't use my mic nobody says shit to me at all. Interesting how that works huh.
---
Im in Puerto Rico, lowest i have ever got is in the 60‚Äôs. Yet people tell me ‚Äúplay in your own servers‚Äù

That happens to me too. I believe it's beginers luck or you don't know the exact capabilities yet so you don't know what your supposed to do.

ever heard of sarcasm? or better yet, a joke?

I miss the days where all you had to do was look at them to identify them. Even then it was more accurate than bomb spotting.

Omg carry me pls /s

I wish
---
Not in the ALL CAPS !!!!!!!! mark way but let's be honest he is tame clickbait. Titling videos the way he does and how his thumbnails are desinged it seems pretty clickbait honestly
---
yup that's the game.
---
the only fix to it is not to solo q lol
---
I'm not dissing him, more just giving information about how his videos are marketed and what his content is
---
It's always been kinda busted, but it got really bad when they reworked how spotting works (no more scan points, whole team gets +10 for an ID)
---
&gt;The concept is nice but I think I'd look better if the background icon rather than being hidden is like his arm patch or something more visible. That's just me tho you do you

Definitely these wallpapers needs tweaking ... that's why i want your opinion . i will try my best next time ! (and sorry for my bad english)

Altho no one have ever used it in-game

Thaaaaaaats what She said
---
That‚Äôs...why I‚Äôm here
---
Dont matter to me i have black ice for jager
---
Honestly, for me, the first picks should be hibana and valk (Maybe maestro). After that, you should just buy whatever you think would be fun.
---
Cannabis, Alcohol, Mushrooms, Truffels, MDMA, XTC, 4FMP, Benzodrine just to name a few, so I've had my fair share of drugs in my younger years :P Never did cocaine tho and I never will, not my shit. Only thing I do right now is some cannabis and very occasionally alcohol.
---
To me it is defenitely way different than drugs. First time on mushrooms was 10X more exciting than the times after that, not saying those were bad, defenitely not. But not close to what I experienced the first time.
---
With Siege, if I'm in a 1v4/5 situation and I manage to clutch out the round, my heart is pumping in my chest and I'm shaking as if it was the first time. That adrenaline rush is still the same to me and dependent on the situation can be even bigger than the first times I experienced that.
---
This is probably different for everyone, but I know for a fact the friends I play with feel the exact same way. That is what keeps me coming back even after 1000+ hours in this game :)
---
Acog
---
Its a placeholder image, its reflection is used yo light up the homescreens theatre. Its commonly used in games
---
Maybe you'd have people to play against if you weren't throwing so hard.
---
Probably I'll make this one later ... just wait !
---
I use Acog if it‚Äôs one of the larger maps with longer hallways, but if I‚Äôm playing more aggressive I switch to the Holo so I can clear rooms better
---
I came home after doing some acid to find this event going on and had the night of my life lol.
---
I second hibana and valk, maybe echo if you don't want to play valk
---
I mean they care ab pro league because it‚Äôs popular but like they were probably hesitant because of the backlash it got

With you on that, expect I don't like he's eyes on the elite we have.... they always seem off to me.
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs probably just the layout and the mask, the eyes look kinda...extended outward.
---
So *he‚Äôs* the cunt sending drop pods right on top of me
---
It‚Äôs not like the pros don‚Äôt know where the obj is
---
Ok so to counteract that glitch just switch from one friendly drone back to yours and it spots the objective.
---
You're about five weeks too late.

That's exactly my problem with it! I have him the brown uniform and the desert head gear for my version of ww1 smoke

---
Why are you copper five
---
Lmao depends on the player/team. In one of my matches I played with the most toxic 3-stack I‚Äôd ever met. My mic was broken but I could here them call me trash f*ggot, and n*gger, even though I out fragged all of them despite getting tked twice. When I challenged them to a 1v3 they said I was trash and not worth their time. Console btw
---
Still copper so getting a win off a 1v5 is *very* feasible but that's harsh so I'm sorry.
---
Please elaborate.
---
Outstanding Move
---
This is super accurate haha
---
Btw anytime your drone won‚Äôt mark an obj you can switch to another drone and back to yours and it‚Äôll spot it :)
---
The worst part is that this bug has basically been around since the beginning. It must be so embedded into Ubisoft's shit code that they don't even bother to address it anymore.
---
Zofia did, check the feed.
---
Unless you're joking.

So he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs neither it‚Äôs legit

Rails to add attachments and would allow for the acog to take up less space on the damn space.

Some parts feel a little overedited and although i haven‚Äôt watched it all yet I think that using using your voices more and telling jokes with friends like McNasty and less gameplay clips.

it was kind of and then he left and then it happened again

I really hoped it was real

Acog for big maps like bank and holo for small maps or when I'm in the mood to play super aggressive, obviously after I've breached.

how so?
---
I hate how you pc players get all the good clips and I have to suffer with my potato aim on controller
---
I've been trying to do it while leaving a part of it vaultable. Leaving a metal part below untouched. So that I can crouch and hide behind a part of the reinforced wall. Doesn't seem to break it at all.
---
No probs. Take your time. No rush anyway.

If only there was a way to safely destroy all that, Kali...

You could try bumping up your graphics to use more of your gpu instead of the cpu.

New theme park is new, every new map/rework is defender sided for a while.
---
That's nice but I am not planning to switch to pc
---
LMG mounted?
---
Technically it works, the problem is that for some reason a very small part of the reinforcement is hidden behind the indestructible exterior wall, making getting that part with the torch more risky, slow and difficult that it should be unlike in consulate for example.

nah nah mate youre pissin me off
---
I see, tbh I never tried doing that but at first glance I think that doesn't work because the required thing to break the reinforcement is the bottom part because it's the base of the reinforcement.
---
The inverse thing does work from what I have seen other people do, but not very useful to do.

Well wouldn‚Äôt another copy cost 130$ as well?

‚ÄúVictim of abuse‚Äù??????

How tf is she a victim of abuse??? She got made fun of in a videogame. She didn‚Äôt get beat in real life or harassed by a group of people at a party. Someone in a videogame said go to the kitchen gamer girl and that equals abuse in yours eyes? Holy shit stop playing the victim card and grow up
---
Oh how you‚Äôve massacred my boy
---
Sometime my drone is right in front of a bomb and my drone dosent spot itüòë
---
They changed it to 5HP because Zofia was too prone to having heart attacks in custom games
---
Then new maps simply shouldn‚Äôt be in ranked until more people learn them people just lose mmr, I don‚Äôt even like winning that way it‚Äôs dumb
---
aw mate you just *beaned* him mate
---
How tf are you Copper 5 are you playing with your toes on an N64 controller?
---
I'm just glad I'm not alone
---
There‚Äôs a separate queue for like 2 weeks, of people don‚Äôt use it¬¥s their own problems
---
Seems more like a demand then a rant.
---
Not everyone has time and no one wants to play the same map for two weeks and no one really tries hard in that game mode so you won‚Äôt go against the same strats and just won‚Äôt be the same level of gameplay
---
does this count
---
https://twitter.com/FullHxD/status/1206510209323143168

On that castle crashers type beat
---
Yup
---
I‚Äôve gotten someone through that drone hole too before the map got revamped, but it only injured them but then I finished them off with a Capitao bolt.
---
It's not too expensive you can buy Jager for 10$ and the entire bundle for 20$
---
Good to know, thanks
---
I said *my* perfect elite for him then Could...?
---
Technically not a rant, but not a list of demands, just suggestions for our boy
---
I feel like this has been happening way too often
---
Who said you have to play the map for 2 weeks straight? Do a couple of games and you will get the most out of it. You will know the new rooms and way to navigate the maps. 
---
If you are not prepared it‚Äôs your fault, they give us the means to learn the map ( discovery, customs)
---
which is the same excuse the community used to get the new maps into the rank map pool from the get go
---
After all these years... i'll finally have 150ms
---
could be the upcoming stadium map? those lights look like what they would use at a stadium
---
you forgot the og doc.
---
*Zofia*
---
Oh yea my bad
---
Learning the rooms is easy but not learning to attack them at their full potential I know the map from all directions but that doesn‚Äôt mean I know what to do against a team that‚Äôs trying their best on the map, and it‚Äôs not just mean considering I haven‚Äôt lost a defense on it either it‚Äôs just stupid
---
You can just press Q and cycle back to your drone by pressing E and it‚Äôs fixed
---
Damn and I complained when I went ten minutes

Ubi has literally come out an confirmed this themselves that this is nothing, and I know Rouge 9 and CoreRoss have had the same conclusion that this is actually a place holder image, But nice try on a conspiracy theory
---
Ok but if they put the map let‚Äôs say 4 weeks later. How are you more prepared? 
---
You just said you need to play it in rank to be able to learn it ( how to attack) but you want to take it out of rank. So when do you learn the map?

For me, best seasonal is a split between gingerbread and palace virtue. Gingerbread looks so stupid on guns that I love it, and palace virtue is just beautiful.

Best standalone skin is hot chopper. Could never get it before it was pulled, sadly. Looked so good.

Best overall universal? Hard to pick, but I'll probably say platinum, cause it looks shiny af on any and every gun.

they all just kinda pushed me at once but one at a time if that makes sense lol

So they can destroy low ranks/levels whitout having to drop theyr rank

The secret star seasonal camo from phantom sight works well with all the pro league sets. It's the only universal that is black/white/gold.

i mean when you play with high ping (150-100) you become more aware of stuff because either you shot them first and kill em or you are basically dead, also the games tend to rubber band with high ping which makes it even worst at times, also the skill lvl on Eu is not the same as in Na, i do believe Na players are better so

Honestly mate, if its rank you are worried about I would recommend T-hunt before you go and play. Focus the T-hunt on what you struggle with. For example, I struggle with recoil control and so I make sure to do about 5+ T-hunts before my first ranked game of the day, focussing on recoil control. I specifically pick operators who use high/unpredictable recoil weapons like buck and sledge (SMG-11). Hopefully that will help you. 
---
Learning callouts is also essential and having 
---
good ranked map knowledge. Map knowledge isn't just callouts and stuff like that. Map knowledge is knowing sightlines, attack routes and what operators are good to play on the map and also what operators YOU are comfortable with on that map. Here is a good example:

After doing my T-hunts I queue for ranked and get Border (starting attack) I know that the most common defender spot in my elo is going to be armoury. So I pick for armoury. Border is almost entirely soft floors save for fountain room so I pick Buck. I am confident in my Buck and I know the spots to go to root out the enemy anchors. Same for defence. If I was defending I know that armoury is the best pick and I choose Bandit knowing I can easily bandit trick the main wall into armoury. 
---
Final thing I'll add is team composition and adaptability. Make sure you have the right operators to get the job done. You could be the best Zofia in the world, but if there is no one to remove the Mute jammers on reinforced walls then your Hibana (for example) can't breach, making your entrance all that harder. I know it sucks, but sometimes you have to pick around your team instead of taking your comfort picks. Its also important to recognise when you're having a bad game and adapt to that. If you are struggling to frag up with someone like Vigil, consider swapping to a more passive role like Maestro or Echo and allowing your team mates to carry you a bit. It sounds cheap but honestly knowing when to let yourself get carried is going to save you so much grief. 
---
Hope that helps mate
---
Oh, ok.
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact you can stop worrying about grenades now
---
Last Christmas, a pack with a random op was given to every player who didn't have all them unlocked, 25K renown was given if you had every operator. The packs were legendary
---
Silver what? Silver 1 silver 4?
---
The only downside is that he gets banned super often :(
---
Not sure maybe 3
---
Yeah i agree but hey, that proves his worth right?
---
Ok, then it‚Äôs descent I guess. (Your kdr)
---
its probably because he continues playing while tilted
---
1.6
---
Hello J√§ger
---
I‚Äôve played since the middle of Velvet Shell. I didn‚Äôt really care for the recoil changes. I didn‚Äôt find it important tbh
---
No I actually mean attacker primary.
---
There are guns like the t5, 416, com9, and many others that best attacker guns, but the vector doesn't. It's only redeeming factor is it's ROF provided you hit the head and head only.
---
Oh come on mate, it's not that big of a deal
---
True!! And when he doesn‚Äôt get banned and your team defends first, basically 3-0 advantage guaranteed üòÇ
---
This post might get deleted for breaking the rules.
---
U think 1.6 kd in silver 3 is descent. Silver is a really bad rank and i should not be there. I wish id get better teammates. I was 1-3 in every placement match and mostly carried.
---
TrueeüòÇ
---
Your laptop probably goes into high performance when you plug in your charger. You‚Äôll need to check your power settings in windows
---
You can turn it off on PC
---
Wat,  just saying, having a 1.6 kid in silver means you more than half the time you get 2 kills per death, and that‚Äôs descent
---
If u have an acog, use the acog, if you don‚Äôt use the acog, you are a dummy dumb

Yup indeed

I love varsity man! Dead ass one of the best out there for siege
---
YOU ARE WRONG GET THE FUCK OUTSIDE.
---
Yer boys wearing a visor, of course nobody's excited lol
---
Like it costs Sony less money to construct a ps than for you or a company to build a pc
---
I kinda prefer the turret over that, cause it has a shield
---
Only reason I've gotten a 1v5 ace with his gadget is that damn shield protecting me from like 3 headshot attempts lol
---
Dope, but what pistol is that? It's not the Bailiff or the Keratos
---
It was developed by Rook using Ela‚Äôs butt
---
I can't. It won't detect the installation so it won't let me verify.
---
Use all the operators if you can to get a feel of who you like, in my opinion there isn't really a meta atm, accept jackal normally gets banned everytime so roaming is much more prevalent
---
I‚Äôm actually not using MnK. I developed the habit of lean spamming before it was even a thing and never got away from it. Even after they fixed it.
---
This made me laugh
---
I like your name.
---
Nobody can cause it hasn‚Äôt information from your pc
---
Sounds like a neckbeard breathing down the mic while you spam crouch teabagging the person you spent 0 effort on killing
---
yes he did. it's favela
---
Nice
---
Her rifle has a ridiculously slow ttk since its a one shot down unless you hit the head, which is easier to do with an automatic. Her gadget is also basically a worse version of thatchers, have a smaller radius, harder to counter bandit tricking with and doesnt work through unbreachable surfaces. Shes honestly quite balanced, maybe a little weak.
---
It's a way of life
---
Best what? Content creation? Skill? Personality? What context are you speaking of
---
i guess this is a good guide if you want to plateau in gold rank range and play casual only
---
You think their solutions actually help ?
---
The AUG is a rifle. Therefore deals quite a lot of damage.
---
It doesn't. You can open the file and see for yourself
---
I'm getting this as well, it's getting rly annoying
---
Have any proof of that? Epic tried in fortnite but the makers of the xim and such got around it in less than 48hours. The problem is it would lead to too many false positives.
---
Ubi should remove R6 from console altogether honestly... Real talk though, I think R6 should be a PC exclusive because that's where it belongs...
---
I feel like the whole R6 on console community is so unenlightened to what true R6 is like. 
---
Had to speak up, couldn't hold that shit in.
---
Yes, precisely. I'd just like it off period in ranked.
---
"interrogation"
---
A two minute video titled Kinda Long would be my sextape.
---
Fair enough. I've played since beta, and they always change something, for better or for worse. In any event, still gotta learn to adapt in this game.
---
Also, if you‚Äôre using the Bailiff 410 (Keratos is much better as a sidearm but the 410 provides insane utility) you can put a hole in some carpets and then throw your alibi prism straight into the hole. It‚Äôll open up and the ‚Äúlegs‚Äù of the prism will be harder to see in the carpet.
---
Look, I'm just telling you what Ubi has stated to the public. Other games can find it but they are fighting a loosing battle. Everytime they patch out the support the company goes around it. 
---
Just to be clear here there are two kinds of MnK adpaters. You have ones sold from Sony and Microsoft that are "offical" products and Ubisoft had disabled those from being used. Than you have ones from third party compines or "Native" adapters. The native adapters are the ones causing problems. They show up as a controller playing to both the PS4 and which ever game is being played. It can be detected but never truly fixed which leads to the "Patch Race" which some games dump money into while the adapter companies just updates the software of the device which costs them nothing. Its one hell of a loosing battle that would just bleed cash flow.
---
This  Post isn‚Äôt about that ......  take that insecurity to a pc master race sub !

Have you tried to ask for help?

Personally I enjoy Favela

is it finally out? or when do they be able to buy

Lol I'm calm I just legitimately couldn't understand what you were trying to say. Like learn English man

will do, thanks!

Just as disabled as people who play as her.

NOOOOO, THE AIRFLOOOOOOWWWWWW

If it makes you feel better, I've never tried in ranked. So I wouldnt know
---
Oh the queue sucks in copper, the last 3 years me and my friends have all grouped up and tried to get to 0 elo.
---
Sadly it's not, I just went there to on holiday to cosplay and watch the finals
---
You mean 2 years ago? Phahah will take another year or 2 probably.
---
but what if he places another one?

well the answer is simple: you place another one on top of the mirror

Thx for all of the feedback I'll try and use these tips ingame

While yes, she is, in a 1v5 situation, she isn‚Äôt that good. the prism as are pretty obviously not human.
---
No witch-hunting bro

You haven't seen enough self-builds if you think this is true

On a serious note, that could work, yes. Could thin the sub a little.

That's not bad, how many people did you have to make the film?

Really I‚Äôm not that active here I only occasionally comment on posts

Listen, every operator has there faults,  Strengths and weaknesses. That's the point  in the game. Also I'd like to add one thing, 3 speed Thatcher?! FUCK NO!!

I see Wamai didn‚Äôt do his job properly

Ok... When we gonna marry?

Whoa. Is this a This is England meme?

It would be great

That is a really nice skin. It's clean and subtle and will look sick as on his rifle

Nope. This is brought to you by the K O L O N I S E E R gang of The Netherlands
---
Ah ok seems fair
---
Gotta add that this post is obviusly a joke about how awful are the controls of the Dreamcast version of the first game, so many combination makes me dizzy...
---
I need to do this too. When the new operators dropped I already had stats on Kali when I logged on the first time.
---
I want it real bad
---
I saw you on this post
---
M870 is a beast of a shotty give it a try!
---
Damn that was a long ass time ago how did you remember that
---
They arent making new weapons, boo-hoo. Waste of time and money to design a weapon that will just be a reskinned version of another. I don't mind riding the downvote train, it's the truth.
---
Your name is *ahem* unique
---
Indeed it is ;)
---
I‚Äôve been lucky with alpha packs this season, only four, and I got two black ices and this, and a sick Ash headgear.
---
If you want to play like a cheeky asshole (me) who uses the outside position reveal as false intel do this.
---
1. Throw a clone outside an area you can run out to in ~2 seconds and is near an enemy spawn.
---
2. Make a few suppressive shots to show you are still inside the building, but keep baiting them to shoot the clone by dodging around it.
---
3. After they get marked and try to get back into cover, run up to the clone and take it's place.
---
4. Wait for them to peak again, get your flick ready, and shoot them ~1 second after seeing them.
---
Really cheeky as this is spawn peeking/rushing. But this strategy either makes you
---
1. Look like a big brain
---
2. **dead**

Toxic player could just run in front of you when you are shooting.

it would be the same, she's just more angry

5v3\* hence the (3K) in the title. Their player joined too late. Also this was pRo LeAgUe ;)

What reflection?

what am I looking at here?
---
Yeah, thanks
---
Thank you! Did you find anything weird?
---
"Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. Guys?"
---
That's is too good ahahaha
---
yes but with less recoil
---
Yeah I know....I just was making a joke cause it looks very similar and is bigger
---
Why tho, his cpu is watercooled, and his gpu is pulling air in from below. That extra 1 degree on his mobo won't kill him

---
&gt; Ela‚Äôs FO-12 is very strong and frustrating, mostly for console players, but on PC as well. She is targeted by Operator bans by console players and when she is not, her pick rate is very high.  
---
Also of note that the community didn‚Äôt receive this well at all because it seemed to target an audience who isn‚Äôt exactly competitive. And while I didn‚Äôt look into it much, I‚Äôve heard pros didn‚Äôt exactly agree with the change either.
---
And the cringe continues..
---
Had the same glitch
---
No the game doesn‚Äôt track bullets fired despite there being a counter for it
---
Ok boomer
---
And you succeed. Great art c:
---
That isn't really what is happening. I understand that it may *appear* as if the game is winding down, but that is pretty far from the case.  
---
We are actually in the process of growing the team. We have a few people, Xavier and Alex among them, that have been working on Rainbow Six Siege for almost a decade. They no longer feel as if their direct involvement is necessary for the game to continue to grow, and are going to step away from it to let new people take the lead.  
---
The people stepping up have been a part of the Rainbow Six Siege team for a while now, and have an exciting vision for where to take the game. Leroy mentioned briefly that he wants to focus on creating features and content that impact all players, and that is the direction we are headed.
---
Oh
---
You know that the concept of reusing guns mean no new guns into the game
---
They are not leaving Ubisoft. They are going to work on other projects within Ubisoft. Also, I'm not ringing alarm bells. This is just what is inevitably going to happen to any games as a service. The new content will naturally be reduced over time. Don't be surprised if we start getting 2 season per year some time soon. They talked about needing to do that in the future in the Hot Breach Podcast they did in Brazil.
---
You‚Äòre right of course but having this change 2 months before the invitational makes me kinda scared. If they don‚Äòt deliver there it could mean that this game isn‚Äòt supposed to last past the first year of next gen consoles. Another Siege game would be cool for sure but good sequels are always hard to pull off and I don‚Äôt really believe they could pull off another great and addictive game as Siege.
---
So before the game starts loading, you want to load another game to play while the main game loads?
---
Ubisoft is also a company, not a game. 
---
You do not need to pay anyone to put a gun design into a video game so long as the name differs. This is how pretty much every company has dealt with guns for the past 40 years in games. 
---
Fictional things are much harder to make because it just have it's own design, function, and look. Guns already have that ready to go if they're really guns. 
---
Eye candy? If you think different guns are eye candy I would love to you see your gameplay because each gun is vastly different from others in R6 even if they are the same platform. 
---
Nice ad hominem.
---
You only need one well placed shot
---
It's just a ubi thing, just restart the game
---
i unlocked it and i got a black ice...
---
Nice, rng Jesus has blessed you
---
It wont. It will see all the available files and just reload missing ones
---
Well, that's fine. i covered anecdotals already in my reply. thanks for the link, reading a bit more now.
---
This explains a lot with the drastic cut down in content in Y4.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean leaving Ubisoft I meant the game. And when I said Ubisoft might be trying to add something I meant the corporate side trying to please share holders, since Ubi‚Äôs stock took a huge hit after GR: Breakpoint flopped. With siege being their highest grossing asset, that is why I‚Äôm worried. And slowing content drops doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs dying they just may be taking more time to a) make better ops and maps b) keep the game alive longer. 
---
But I mean you‚Äôre not wrong at all the game will eventually die. And right off the bat people aren‚Äôt going to like 2 seasons a year
---
Cool thanks. Not wasting any more time here. The hivemind is real.
---
It literally went to a different number after it hit zero.
---
new monty buff . He can flash people now

Damn zofia went full

Good comment. Fundamentally all the guns do the same thing, aim, shoot, and eliminate. Adding a Tavor to the game that has bullpup recoil and rifle DPS won‚Äôt change gameplay. Complaints for no reason
---
no
---
I got it first pack of Ember Rise.
---
sorry
---
Because it was the end of the round he didn‚Äôt get the pop up, but I was playing with my mates anyway
---

That's why I'm suggesting to add Hbar.  It's literally just AUG with very few differences.

Would love to see other operators drawings in this style

There's a run down on the blog

I WANT A GLOCK 17
---
Shittly tides
---
How's that possible? Where are you from?
---
Cape Town
---
Yeah I thought about that, I was more or less just suprised. Don't need to be a brat.
---
definitely did
---
New to Reddit where do I find this?
---
Its the default refection for all headgear, idk why
---
What "way more resourceful things" could they do to make the player base happy? Give me an example
---
I couldn't imagine.
---
It's already hard enough trying to get people to communicate effectively as it is now, THAT, would be on a whole other level
---
I thought there would be more people on SA servers. It sucks man. Maybe they'll fix it somehow.
---
Cos the lighting and tone so the dev team can fix any mistake on the model.
---
The more ranked matches you play, the less elo you gain/lose.
---
on the siege blog, wait a minute I'll find it
---
Oh yeah, if you went in there without a full squad, you're asking for a bad time.
---
I would love the GRIS skin as a universal
---
Are you on the right servers?
---
the reason it wasn't working is because when you ask steam to install a game, it checks to see if it has enough space to download it first. Issue was that my ssd i bought only for r6 is only 120gb and since i copied r6 to it, there was roughly 30gb left and steam wouldnt even let me start the "install" to discover the existing files.
---
That would make more sense. It even happened back on PS4 during season 2
---
Thank you
---
EL EM TREE MOUNTED AND LOADED!
---
This is actually the thing I had just read and I didn't understand fully tbh
---
Yeah one word  crossplay
---
This is going to be my last comment for 2 reasons.
---
1.) I'm tired of this.
---
2.) It seems you guys are just using me to outlet your frustration at this point.
---
That aside, if you are asking for *my opinion*, I'd like to see some more map reworks. I obviously don't speak for everyone else though.
---
Agreed! üòÇ
---
It really is though
---
Well done
---
Maybe one day...
---
Ive never got to try it becose of that
---
People who have no experience on game development are calling out Ubi for being lazy. In fact, most of the people complaining have no experience in literally anything useful other than spewing hatred for others. 
---
Most common argument is "I paid for season pass. I demand new guns." Bro, never ever in the season pass they said new guns. They promised 4 maps (apart from Operation Health), 8 operators with unique gadgets, 1 season pass exclusive skin, 1 season pass exclusive charm, 8 season pass exclusive operator headgears and uniform, 10% off on Shop items and 300 or 600 free R6 Credits if you had previous year's pass. They delivered everything as promised. Just take a breather and calm yourself. 
---
Managing a game this size is hard. That's why we have so many bugs and glitches found everyday. Fix one bug and other shows up. Yes they are working their best to fix everything. Probably R6 is one of Ubi's highest earning game, and they are trying their best to make sure they can earn more by working hard to increase the longevity of the game. Are they succeeding at fixing all glitches? Absolutely not. But they are trying. Just appreciate their work sometimes.
---
Thanks üòä
---
Pls don't clip something like this
---
Why not huh üòí
---
Honestly I disagree in my opinion cause the gun is already ridiculous good and Ubi have already adjusted the C8‚Äôs recoil to be easier to control without a grip in Phantom Sight so adding a grip to the C8 would essentially turn it into a C7E.
---
Hello thespacetimelord, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ecgqiw/anyone_elses_game_crash_whenever_you_are_playing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Worst?
---
And considering the gun in the post is also already in the game, maybe people will start to understand why we wont be getting too many new weapons
---
Because Jager and Twitch already had a Pro League Set with the 416 and F2. They did a new one with alternative guns.
---
Me too
---
Degenerates like you belong in the cross

Who holds the M4A1? That is my favorite ar so far

This is my biggest worry, when new person comes in they may or may not be totally inline with old directors vision and may change things for the better or worse.

Yeah, I think i'll just start off with the deluxe and the year 1 operators and go from there. Thanks for your time!
---
Yeah but it won‚Äôt sell the Xbox option on the store only PS4 and pc 
---
Uk btw
---
Dude, solid edit. The song was a perfect choice.
---
If it was on a 1 speed it shouldn't be a problem. Statistically the Ak12 is the best attacker gun but because it's on Fuze nobody complains
---
Breathe. Sounds dumb but really. Don‚Äôt hold your breath and try not to take fast, rapid breaths.
---
Oh sorry my bad
---
Simply put, licensing fees. Borderlands just creates new weapons where Siege either takes inspiration or the copies the exact weapon meaning they have to pay fees to have the model in the game
---
No worries,  I'm currently watching a pro league game and it is always nice to have new players join the community.
---
Sorry dad...
---
Yeah, too much clutter
---
This isn't new though.
---

Not dumb at all. Ive thought since the round happened to breathe properly but not a stupid thing to say.

‚ÄúI once made plat 3 so I‚Äôm better than everyone‚Äù
---
Am I the only one who doesn't the find the conform memes funny? Just toxic
---
Aye I like her handgun too
---
They cant really punish people until they fix their servers. Imagine getting a long term ban because you couldnt connect to a match due to Ubis shit servers.
---
Yep
---
I would, it's an cool weapon with a surprisingly cool reload animation when reloading from an empty mag. And it has great damage and rate of fire.
---
Obviously cav is different. Every other player imaginable though the best thing for the team and win is to kill them, unless being baited strategically. I literally got team killed for killing a spawn peeker while attacking just now. Toxic af.
---
I thought that was Iq at first
---
Oof
---
Does it matter? If the teammate gets killed trying to finish their kill when you are right there it's best for the team.
---
For the next map rework I would like to see a tower rework, purely because it is my least favorite map. What we really need is an all new map though...
---
That's literally what I said are you dumb brother üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well she literally says that line so what else would it make it
---
Kill the deserters
---
Its so clean
---
Quoting another character. She says "As my friend would say".
---
Me and my friend also landed on Gold 3, recently, would love to grind to hit Plat, hit me up.
---
Yugoslav music lmfao
---
But the whole line together. She says it it‚Äôs hers lol
---
While I agree with you, I still say they should give us a rework to an existing map, purely because the newer maps haven't been the best, for example Fortress and that God forsaken mess Tower
---
How did you reply to this I thought this got removed?
---
They should change the map pool every month or so. Or maybe expand it. Its getting tiresome when the only maps I've played the past 4 months have just been coastline, kafe, and kanal.
---
It's not like Ubi needs money either. R6 alone made 1.1b last year.
---
I don't care about your form. Make me mod and I will be a simi-active and can deal with anything.
---
G2 suck ass
---
I am a mod
---
Jk
---
That's not what's best for the team at all though. So a teammate is going to put themselves out of position and possibly get themselves killed to finish off someone that another teammate may have a better shot at?
---
It's probably for the same reason reddit hates steam market games- if you're a fool, you can waste a lot of money on it, while in R6 you'd instead have to purchase the renown boosters and grind away. Overwatch and TF2 are my perfect monetisation schemes, yet reddit seems to absolutely despise them. I think I've spent  less than a dollar on TF2 and just by being smart with my trades, I came out with like 80‚Ç¨. In CS:GO, just selling new cases as they come out would easily get you at least 5‚Ç¨ - you're literally paid to play the game when a new season starts, and you actually own the items in your inventory, so you can always sell them back or gift them to a friend or whatever. Last month I've sold some old skin I purchased like five years ago (with a 200% profit, by the way) and bought myself a Steam Controller for what I've earned. People act like it's the worst thing ever, but it's a win/win situation, since Valve makes money out of the market taxes and the player makes money by selling his rubbish.
---
Thanks! I agree completely, it's given me a couple of thousand hrs of fun minimum!
---
Nah man, give us a 3 speed attacker with an MK18
---
Yeah that sounds good
---
Thanks! I am the YT Wulfe lol I play on PC
---
Same I already somehow had played Kali 1h and I just bought her.
---
Eh I don‚Äôt want to argue I was just commenting.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a glitch then
---
1. Bind the key you want to unbind to something that already has assigned a key.
---
2. Rebind the OG key.
---
3. ¬ø¬ø¬ø
---
4. Profit.
---
Bandit tricking the gpu, nice
---
The R4C and the gun maverick have are not M4's, bucks is the closest to the actual M4A1 youre thinking of.  Only difference is it has a more compact stock, and has a different gas block on the front than the traditional fixed front sight post gas block M4's have.
---
Someones salty lol
---
No app is easy, it's all practice and learning. Personally Id find a software and just learn the ends and outs of it.
---
I use Adobe products but Davinci Resolve is free and it's AMAZING. This video didn't require tons of editing skills. It was mostly sound design, retiming and storytelling. Ubisoft did the hard part and made beautiful cinematics!
---
True wasn't sure
---
Yaas plz
---
As a buck main I would love it but I probably wouldn't use it
---
For ranked they want to keep it as competitive as possible, in casual they are changing the map pool every month and a half.
---
Hopefully.
---
Oh no no no this ain't it chief. Where the hell is Chris Hansen?
---
Thank you Bruce! Kinda wanted to show more of my creative side lol
---
"Crossfire" to be exact! Thank you!
---
Loved that you loved it!
---
r/shittyshittyrainbow6
---
Even then, OW and Tf2 etc takes actual money.
---
R6 makes you buy special currency, which always makes you spend more to buy more than you need (items 1450, can only buy 500, 1200 or 1800etc...then you're left  over with 350, cheapest items are 400 etc, just ns example).  Legit the scummiest practice.
---
We need "Save the necks of the people" next to "Save the trees" as well
---
Oh thank you :)
---
On one hand, G2 shouldn‚Äôt have dropped one of the best Support players in EU, but on the other hand Goga joined Vitality, which looks to be a monster of a team, because G2 dropped him.
---
Ight thanks man and yea ubi has sick graphics but not rlly on my pc barely gets 15fps on lowest but your editing was sick asf
---
Notice how they cited aboslutely no legal sources with that? The guy above is right, as long as you don't put in logos and brand names, a company can't really sue you for depicting a something that looks kinda like one of their products. And plus, there are so many AR and AK knockoffs and variants out there, Armalite and Izmash don't really have a leg to stand on, legally.
---
There are also a whole lot of weapons manufacturers who have gone out of buisness, along with many governmental weapons designers for the soviet union, who no longer own the copyright on their weapons. 
---
The whole "we can't legally design anymore weapons" is a bullshit excuse, that covers up a more valid reason for not putting in more guns in the game, which is, it's easier to balance one gun and have it level out many operators, than to have to go in and tweak everyone individually.
---
Thank you! Really appreciate that!
---
I am all for an 7.62 rifle on defence. If we get an AR in 7.62 with similar dimensions to the Honey Badger it would be quite fun. I mean the recoil would be ludicrous and it would need a slow fire rate, but why not. Definitely an interesting idea. 
---
But in reality those rifles exist for the lols, they have no use because of the recoil. AR pattern rifles are just to light in most cases. Blackbeard SCAR H (MK17) is relativly compact but also heavy. Same goes for Capitaos FAL (Para-308) 
---
Both are around 8 pounds while the Honey Badger weights 5.7 pounds.
---
That's what I think too
---
We will be at DCC in march again. Saturday is Siege day for our group
---
In the top, the health of IQ went down as you were shooting, therefore you shot iq.
---
to my surprise!
---
Weird.. IQ‚Äôs health dropped. So it was either a skin that caused you to see her as- wait actually nvm it tells you about teammates.. Maybe it just bugged and the team name didn‚Äôt show.
---
Just one more question! Totally forgot to ask this. Is there aim assist in multiplayer on console?
---
I would love this TBH, same with Blackbeard's Assault Rifle
---
Srry dude don't like to sad bad news but his ban won't be appealed. You're friend was probably running a script altering application or hacks in the background (Even for a different game) and battleye must have detected it. Its you're friend's fault and not battleye or ubi's fault, specially after manual revision.
---
But how? I don't see any IQs on my screen, I'm pretty sure she was in the site like 10m behind me.
---
I want more AK variants. Why would special ops use an AK47 when an AKM or AK-12 is available? What would be best imo is interesting and unique AK variants like the AK-9 and AN-94 or even AK inspired weapons like the Vintorez or Val.
---
The ARX is on the Y5S1 attacker so we‚Äôll see what‚Äôs up
---
Tone down your pasive aggressive comments.... Sound didn't change. You could check yourself in all the change logs from every season.
---
Hello taibott, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ecjygm/battleye_not_working_r6s_not_launching_please_help/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I heard it creeping up in the background and got chills, love that song as well. Fantastic job
---
The idea is that by reducing the amount you get it gets you into your ‚Äútrue rank‚Äù faster. The issue is the system doesnt account for leavers and trash teammates. 
---
Sure the grind at the end of the season can be painful, but i always enjoy it bcuz it allows me to experiment with different ops, and try new strats
---
oh, didn't know this thanks for the info bois.
---
Nah that's obviously valk. IQ was on the other site behind me, and the valk ran around to the door on the other side and I died to her. Nobody else was even in that direction.
---
That's good
---
Well.... did you clutch the round??
---
Nope. People will still complain because we need another AR that has slightly better than average dmg, slightly lower than average RoF, or any mixture. We literally have every balanced type of weapon in the game. I get that people want more weapon models, but is that really necessary?
---
I was then only one on my team for a solid minute. Essentially it was the enemy team's fault. I get what you mean tho, when I see an enemy echo we try to get him asap.
---
Yeah I'm exited to see what new blood will do to siege. While the game has be improving each season it has definitely felt like 2 steps forward 1 step back.
---
Great video, I am so happy Thatcher got a lot of time as he is my main. Wanna go for a game ?
---
What was the song in the background?
---
Could balance by being on a three armor.
---
We lost and we didnt even get to play. Fix your shit ubi.
---
Ngl echo is kinda thicc no homo
---
Considering they did that with Wamai but in reverse, they can definitely do this now. I have been wanting this since seeing Wamai
---
** dial up Internet noises **
---
You will die in 3... 2...
---
Yes. But fix the fucking recoil, it‚Äôs still annoying
---
That was awesome!
---
I was observing the event and only saw you a few times when going to toilet or on the screen in the production. You guys nailed it. Awesome cosplays and this is an amazing picture. We'll done all of you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You thin kit went well pls it went amazing
---
I mean, Ubi has straight up said this is part of the reason so I'm not sure why you are acting like its some big revelation.
---
For example, they have talked about how making all the universal skins fit on new weapons is an absolute nightmare and takes way too much time (relative to the payoff at least) to accomplish.
---
They are cutting back on new guns because;
---
* the more guns the harder it is to balance
---
* legal issues
---
* its a time sink
---
* there is already more then enough in the game and many dont ever get used anyway
---
I completely disagree, it becomes much harder to balance ops when you DON‚ÄôT introduce new weapons. Take Warden for example, he sucks, a cool adjustment would be to buff his MPX, but that would also buff Valkyrie who is already really strong.
---
Even tho there are a lot of trash people and bosters i have faith in the community to know better and extra nice vid ceep up the good work!!!
---
Thank you ^^ we‚Äôll try to be there for most events like this in the future
---
Shit . they removed it in Shifting Tides then . It was there when Ember Rise was a thing
---
Are you saying you quit after it found you the match? Because then you're in the match, quitting was your decision at that point
---
No Silencer is trash.
---
Hopefully. I'm on mostly on german events or majors. I wish you all the best.
