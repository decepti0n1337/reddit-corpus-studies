Anymore? How long you been getting bans for?
---
Sir I'm going to have to ask you to stop 
---
What is the punish mechanic? 
---
This isnt new. Been a problem in high rank console gameplay for many seasons. Nothing ubi can do about it either
---
No, Ranked is to be competitive.
---
Casual is to fuck around, play and have fun.
---
&gt;pro league easier because it's closer to what they play.
---
That's CSGOs secret
---
For real.  There's  some  asshole talking shit  to   everybody  in almost every single match  nowadays, whereasI only recall  meeting two cheaters in my entire career,  so since Dust  Line. 
---
Cheaters  absolutely are  a serious problem and  shouldn't be ignored, but  let's not  act like  toxicity is a non-issue.
---
Gotcha

You can play games and not be an ass at the same time.

Hm, does anyone have a link to the original sword it‚Äôs based on? I can‚Äôt seem to find anything related to u/guizmo_0886 ‚Äòs response
---
Excuse me. *cough cough* BLYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAATTTTTTT
---
His gun is great lmao it has zero recoil, making it a headshot machine. 
---
If it moves i kill it, and i don‚Äôt get mad at others for thinking the same. 
---
Why lower the .44 mag's magazine size?
---
He's extremely situational and has very poor pick/win rates. As of Year 3 Season 3, his win delta was actually lower than Tachanka's in high-ranked competitive play. It's easy to see why - his gun is mediocre at best, his gadget only has three uses and isn't very durable, and he doesn't really have any utility aside from impact grenades. He has so little going for him, especially with all of the attackers now that can open his barricades. 
---
Blind player vs deaf player, who will win?
---
It‚Äôs already always day time and ranked is in beta so they can make changes to it like making ranked only day who gives a shit if it‚Äôs in beta it‚Äôs just a word 
---
Now in the distant future we need to repost these so people can get Uber-disappointment 
---
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got em.
---
All of these sound great except for the sexual harassment and fascism being ‚Äúmajor‚Äù issues apart from people saying nibba I encounter barely any racism and same with sexual harassment they are issues that need to be fixed but not major (I play on pc and ps4 so I mostly have both of the views)

I mean, its kinda hard to stop sexual harassment and racism when you're in voice chat... besides muting them.... which you can do.... And there isnt any of that in text chat nowadays.
---
Yes to all of them
---
Woah woah woah what's the deal here?
---
Probably the C8-SFW or the V308. Those are my 2 favorite guns in the game. On defense I love the Scorpion and MP5SD

The problem with pick/ban is that you can‚Äôt take away some operators from the player. I don‚Äôt think is fair for the season pass holder or the player who grind to get 25k renown to be unavailable to play that operator. The must be a better option. Imagine like in the pick/ban fase you limit the use of the operator to one winning round like the locking site mechanism. That would prevent the abuse of an op or annoying operator and players would still be able to use them.
---
And casual shouldn‚Äôt have spawn/site choice. The point of casual is that, being casual. Spawn/ site choice would make some sites unplayable since you would never choose them. Would you add the locking site mechanism? Or just choose the best site over and over again? Plus that would add extra layer of sweatiness. I believe it should just tell what site are you going to play because not knowing is just annoying when you choose an operator like mira. I totally agree with the 3 minute timer.
---
The solo q in ranked would be an awesome addition to the game.
---
The shooting range would be a great addition too but i don‚Äôt know how much data would that need. Probably a tips&amp;tricks loading screen would be a good addition for new players.
---
Seriously tho.
---
This whole super cool Christmas pack thing has just turned into a nightmare.
---
Ok on kafe you were right but on skyscraper some rooms like office got beams from west yo east :/
---
I believe that being able to see your spawn in casual was promised over 2 years ago. Sadly, if they haven't implemented it by now, I doubt they ever will. I really just want to play  Mira without playing Teller's on border. As far as maps go...I think they should make an option to only do the ranked pool in casual, and if you want just any map, you can do that. There are plenty of people who play that like some of the maps not in the ranked pool.
---
This again is just my opinion
---
Flair checks out
---
Oh my bad.  Thought he meant he was sick of picking him because enemy took shields. 
---
German officer gassing German soldier because of mistake 1943 colorized

I referred to grammar as I, not the whole enemy team.

But it was a joke so I don't get how it is important

You can't backfill ranked games. Nice story bro
---
still waiting on australians
---
i think Soc would be cool
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But how often is it actually possible to hit people under a Castle barricade? Personally, I've never had the chance to do it, either because the angle I'm at makes it impossible, the enemy isn't standing right in front of the barricade like a moron, or because there are far more important things to do than try to shoot a guy's toes. 
---
I love the work- and if this is the low end stuff, I‚Äôd absolutely love to see what you can mock up with better equipment!
---
well it used to work, was like close to a year ago or so
---
Not count a loss... in casual? That doesnt track W/L? Good news, it already doesnt...

How?

Oh lmaooo I‚Äôm late to this party haha

His stats say otherwise. His win delta is lower than tachanka's. 
---
It took me 9 months to get a legendary on console.  I switched to pc and got one with my 7th pack
---
where you crying?
---
Maybe dude was half afk. Or maybe lagging?....
---
Happened to me couple times, had to take my kid to the restroom while match was going on lol so I hid in the corner, came back were still alive, and right when I came back dude whips around the corner facing opposite way of me, and I got him. Finished the round lol
---
The massive issues are teamkilling and toxicity
---
How about a refund on the items that are now free for new players
---
Cubist house now
---
Is it bad? Yes. Should it be in casual anyway? Yes.
---
Imo every map should be in casual. It's bad, but was always a ton of fun to play. If we're going to have shit ass Favela in the game I see no reason not to have BU.
---
Thats cheating, even ubi said so
---
If Ubi won't nerf Lion, at least add pick and ban to ranked so I don't have to put up with the bullshit he brings to the match
---
No video game does dumb things like this, and it causes more issues with code.
---
It should be able to go through a simple melee hole or a pistol hole.

I dont wish that new Hereford abomination on my worst enemy. Lol
---
They never do
---
Ah yes thanks makes sense. 
---
I don't see nearly enough snacks. Looks like a great time though, hope you guys enjoy! 
---
I think they should fix the leveling system to the same that rocket league did. Make each level a fixed amount of xp, and reward each level with a very small item, with the possibility of getting a good item. Each game should give you varying amounts of xp depending on 
---
- points
---
- mvp
---
- win / loss
---
- join midgame
---
And they should hand out minus xp for 
---
- team kills
---
- abandoning midgame
---
- offensive language
---
Spent as much time on Maverick as i have nomad, here is my 2 cents
---
Maverick is overall a better operator. his torch is still damn near silent (even though ubi said they fixed it they did not) and his guns are better. He works as a breach if needed, but the best way to use him is still opening pinholes and killing unaware enemies.
---
Nomad is my preferred though, as she is amazing at anti roam, i love the AK as a weapon and when playing Bomb, she is amazing if played well. 
---
Look at it like this. Nomad is amazing late round, Maverick is best early round, but good the whole way through.
---
It would be, but there isn‚Äôt anyway to detect it so...
---
There is nothing different from Console to PC other than 2 main things I've noticed. First, you can't lean left or right without scoping in, the second one is that guns have a tighter hip spread reticle than console plebs like me, but that may be due to the fact you can't lean with scoping in.
---
They can just mute the people
---
I'm okay with all of them except the Castle rework.
---
As a Castle, I like to shoot people from under
---
With that rework, you'll need to get further to see more, which if you're like me, a guy who can't go past 1366\*768 resolution without frames dropping harder than me out of college, kind of a disadvantage.
---
Very true
---
Just to clarify a little, I picked maverick and this is what i got, then the next player chose maverick and he got him instead. this happened a few times today but this is the only time i screenshotted it
---
I play siege on all platforms, theres no assistance to recoil on console other than either selecting burst or single action and tapping to shoot or just get use to nature of the recoil, PC seems to have different recoil patterns than console and is easier to maintain with a mouse.

Imo not a necessary post, many of these things that most of the community has asked for. Also hot take but sexual harassment and racism aren't really that big issues in the community and they are much less of an issue than the other 3 things you listed in the post. Also what did you mean when you listed "balance elo earnings", I don't understand what you mean by that. Other than that I would just say I doubt that we are going to get many of these changes within a reasonable time frame, a tachanka buff is one of the teams lowest priorities right now and literally everything suggested by u/zampoodle are problems in every video game and will never be eliminated completely, not to say they aren't problems but I don't think its fair to expect ubi to completely fix sexual harassment, racism, team killing, hacking and toxicity simply isnt reasonable unless you ubisoft to pour all of there resources into completely micro managing there  community, which in many cases has leads to censorship and the very thing your trying to fix turning into a watered down shell of its former self.
---
No but please don‚Äôt put your teammates through that I hate losing because I have a teammate with poor connection and loses us the game cuz of it when he could‚Äôve won. Stick with casual till you got better internet then hit ranked. 
---
For defense, I recommend jager or bandit because they are fairly easy to play and helpful to the team. For attack,  I recommend ash and thermite for the same reason.

Sexual harassment and racism are not worst than teamkilling, you can silence voice chat and normal chat, but you can't silence a bullet to your face
---
The pizza boxes, sodas, and chips are all off screen
---
No. This was the issue that CS:GO had and it became a huge thing. Earn it, or buy it.
---
It's just really easy to do (once you know the spots and the timings), and more difficult to punish then it really should be. 
---
Mrs Obama, I've done it, I stopped racism
---
Could someone explain to me the purpose of always having maps on daytime? 
---
Is there a practical purpose other than map consistency?
---
I personally prefer nighttime modes. So I‚Äôm wondering if there is a practical benefit to having maps locked on daytime. 
---
There is no aim assist on console, unless you're in T-Hunt
---
It is much harder to compensate for recoil on a controller than it is on an MKB
---
I have enjoyed rainbow since velvet shell, though I'm very experienced with a controller.
---
It is easy to learn how to compensate for recoil etc via muscle memory
---
User flair fits
---
Ash, Doc, Rook, Mute, Jaeger, Bandit, Twitch, and Thermite... but Ash is fun and OP so hehe
---
Map sense and game sense improve with time, 1000 hours is generally average time to absorb everything unintentionally. If you focus on learning them through custom games and terrorist hunt you can probably halve that. T hunt on secure hostage house is generally regarded as quickest way to earn renown.
---
That's also very true, but it doesn't make sense to me why they'd remove a post game stat. Got to be a glitch.
---
That goes to any gun but cool stuff bro
---
Looks like a reskin of the Doc elite skin. 
---
Like the castle idea but no matter what they do there is gonna be racism and sexual harassment people will just find a way around it and people are just terrible not much u can do about that
---
This happened when I tried picking vigil but got bandit instead because someone else picked but I'm sure I clicked first :/
---
I suggest playing more casual before going back into ranked. You started ranked too early, without first having a basic understanding of the game it seems. This is resulting in the toxicity you face. While it might suck for your teammates to sometimes have a burden on their shoulders, it sucks for you too. Why? Because the more ranked games you play, the more the system believes you belong in a certain rank. So from earning 100 points per win, you slowly start earning less. Once you hit 10 a win, good luck ranking up. So learn and improve your game sense in casual first.
---
I was wondering the same thing, yes sexism and racism are bad, but there isn‚Äôt much you can do to police people being dicks other than Ubi actually doing something when you report someone for being toxic (which they do a terrible job at), maybe they should be like a normal games report system where you can specify why you‚Äôre reporting them other than just having ‚ÄúToxicity.‚Äù Things like TKing can be addressed with a feature similar to Halos Forgive/Not Forgive feature for team killing.
---
One time thing. 
---
Oooh, yeah. That's definitely nice.
---
It's still a slur if you change G's for B's.
---
When did they listen to us? They never did. Because there is no reason, why would they listen to us? They've already got our wallets. 
---
y‚Äôall sugandese?
---
Yeah, there should be a report system for that. (Report for toxic behaviour does nothing smh)
---
Not new
---
How is that a problem lol, I'm super confused. They are different variants of the same gun so of course they are gonna be different
---
In that case fuck me sideways and call me jerry.
---
Just ban all spergs and incels who abuse everyone in the voice chat. Yeah there is a mute button, but rainbow six siege is a kind of game that needs communication like in CS or any other tactical game. 
---
Hey some good kills there 
---
I know i picked first since i said in game, uhh, why do i have ash's guns but maverick splash art? and then the other guy said, ill pick him see what happens, then got this.
---
I miss lan parties, high speed internet killed them. Lol
---
Insurgency has a pretty brilliant way of handling friendly fire situations. Basically, after you hit a certain damage limit (whether you kill a friendly or just damage them,) instead of hurting anyone on your team any more, the damage you do to them is mirrored back onto you. There are certainly some issues with this style of team damage correction, but it's one of the better ones I've seen.
---
Looks awful 
---
Maestro isn't a base operator, but he's a really great operator that's easy to get the hang of. 
---
As for base ops, Jager and Twitch are really good.
---
What are you packing cause I want some?
---
Vigil is having a stroke.
---
I'm not saying they should be instabanned, they should get review and eventually deserted/banned, 
---
bro cav is a dude11!1!1
---
Sweet concepts and I love the detail you put into it as well 
---
Hope it gets fixed soon because it's irritating lol 
---
I think content creators have a lot to answer for actually.  ‚ÄúBald Genius‚Äù is actually just toxic af and always has been.  Funny once? Sure.  But when you‚Äôre affecting a whole community?
---
All of these guys are funny once.  Or twice.  But I see far less emphasis on real gameplay and being good at the game - so people are trying to generate the same ‚Äúfunny‚Äù content and moments.
---
 Can you post the video so we can see what it looks like?
---
I think that may make them to vulnerable when shooting
---
That could be something client sided. OP didn‚Äôt give us all the details of the clip
---
With fokin laser sights to make Thatcher angry so he rush into the enemy team and distracts them.
---
But the problem is there isn‚Äôt a guaranteed way of telling

---
Interesting idea! I'm not sure if lighting effects like this are something the team is planning on experimenting with, but I can definitely see the utility in how you describe it!
---
I could see this being especially strong for locking out a choke point or hallway, though it would probably need to be easily countered by a single explosive or well-placed shot. 
---
I like it. 
---
PS4 player here.
---
I almost never play solo. I 90% of the time get into a match on the last round that is 2-0 against my favour, and i see votes to kick way too often. its usually because someone doesnt want a random in the game and cant be bothered to get a full squad.
---
Also casuals dont like it when 1 man is alive with 2 minutes left. cuz they want to go to the next round. nevermind they died almost instantly and contributed nothing, stop wasting time man....
---
I want the hip lean mechanic to be added to consoles .. and maybe a button configuration tab and everyone assigns it whatever they want 
---
Can it be added that animations such as setting fuze charges be cancelled by taking damage? One might argue that deploying a fuze charge is a calculated risk and that therefore, it's your problem if you die trying to deploy one but while that may be true, realistically, you should be able to stop deploying one if you get shot at
---
Based on leak, new one is comming soon 
---
Shield ops or dmrs exist = almost Nero recoil kind of
---
I'm a girl and I play seige. It's my favorite game but I get killed just because I am a girl.  It happens more often than you think but people don't necessarily talk about it. If you want to see it first hand than I recommend watching one of spawntaneous' gaming videos. She shows how bad it is. 
---
I‚Äôm honestly a Zofia main myself... fuck ADS burning was easy.
---
I love how IQ is kinda underrated by other players that think nothing could ruin their strategy, but then IQ comes, kills Pulse and detects Virgil before he rushs into the team, and saves the day.

Bandit mains really are hating on Kaid
---
How about a separate queue for people with high amounts of toxicity reports? It's not even worth speaking in casual matches. Every time I queue my mic I have to listen to a kitchen joke, people screaming GRILL!?!? or graphic sexual statements and questions.

---
No
---
Really? Link?
---
Alright alright alright. Let's see what we got! Racism on the field
---
Explain?
---
Add map voting when joining a lobby. No one want to play shit maps like favela or yacht or kanal. Every time I join one of these maps people begin leaving. Add a vote system so people can play what they want. Or simply take the maps designed by 1st graders out. Or just make it so you can play the maps you want like in terrorist hunt. 
---
FUCKIN LOL ok. 
---
I've been playing since Y1 bruv. 
---
As much as I hate toxicity, nothing anyone can do is going to get rid of it. This is the internet where people are hidden by anonymity and that gives them free reign to do and say whatever they want with no repercussions. The only option you ever have is just to ignore them. Use the mute/block feature and your online experience will be leagues better.
---
This could easily be fixed by just making new operators unbanable upon the first few weeks of release. 
---
Yeah nah i understand what percentages are and how they work doesn't stop Ubi from being sneaky, i just thought it was fishy as i have gotten about 7 or so packs and every ine of them as been over 50% chance. It had never happened to me before 
---
Can we stop beating the dead tachanka horse already?
---
the problem with no.4 is, if everyone turn this feature off. and you happen to get a douche or even 2 teamate that leave the match mid game. Then you are stuck with 3 man .
---
the others im cool with it
---
YouTube mirror: [https://youtu.be/wEvPoC14iEQ](https://youtu.be/wEvPoC14iEQ)
---
Tachanka is getting a full rework. Only his name will remain the same, and Ubi has already said that they aren't making any chamges to him.
---
I like the idea but in speculative about tha forgive system. . .what if i accidentally tk a rando and it was his fault or a complete accident like i was shooting a drone and he skips the killcam and just punishes me?
---
When I was a noob I did it. Never fuzed the hostage once
---
When you hit like and it goes to 700 but then goes down to 690 I cri every time

Not official though.

I think your able to remove the starter edition from steam and add a diffrent one . Not 100% how to do it but heard people say it many times your able to.

Yeah, I use it all the time. I have to mute at least one person in most of the games I speak in. It also means I miss all the call puts they may make or whatever actual relavent information they pass on. I get handicapped and my experience is negatively impacted through no fault of my own.

Says the kid who knows nothing about IT. If you want new content you are going to get bugs. Quit bitching and go play another game.

It's casual tho so rly who cares? The matches are over in like 10 mins tops

I just typed in ‚Äúrainbow six‚Äù into the steam workshop tab of the program and it was mabey a page or two in 
---
I‚Äôm pretty new (and starter edition rip) so no pick/ban is actually beneficial to me at present, but it just makes sense for the game‚Äôs long term health. 
---
I‚Äôd also like for them to make it more obvious just how much worse the starter grind is compared to the standard. It says extended and they give a time estimate, but from my reading it isn‚Äôt clear how much worse it is compared to standard. 12.5K vs 2-5k for basics is insanely different.

ELO is rank right? I'm usually a gold 4. I usually don't play ranked that much cause of bad internet

Using bright ideas to win the round!

I would do that,  but I have only heard of that after the Christmas sale and because of that it is now far more expensive than my game store which is still having it's boxing day sale. I may decide to do this anyway though. Thanks.
---
Aight
---
I disagree with always daytime and pick/ban, imo that should stay in tournaments etc. Having alternate times of day adds lots of variation to the game which is nice.
---
dude, it's casual. you get punished for leaving ranked, let people leave in casual if they want

If she has a working gas mask, then smoke couldn‚Äôt possibly counter her

Lmfao it just happened to me too, but I got no ELO from it

I don't really care what others think. If this makes just one person's experience better then it's a victory for me
---
What's Fortnights streamer mode?
---
What engine is it
---
Tell him to use lower vertical sensitivity, just to control recoil. No aim assist, but I‚Äôd make sure he definitely wants it. Rainbow isn‚Äôt for everyone but most of the people who do love it play it long time.
---
Lmao they made SAS from Rainbow Six into a real thing
---
Top 10 sights seen before death
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you drops your /s or if you are retarded
---
I think they should add a new mode or something because having only three game types could become stale
---
Yikes I've always heard everyone try to steer people away from the starter edition, since you have it I'm wondering, do they give an option to upgrade it to the standard edition if you enjoy the game or are you just screwed and have to rebuy the game for the full price. If not they really should consider allowing players to upgrade to the standard edition for the cost difference. 
---
Obviously. No I didnt mis sread anything its always been a problem in every online game ive ever played and to say that Ubi as a company that builds games should channel resources and capital into something they'll never fix and isn't entirely their problem. I can't wait until some salty ass kids or other players start to ban everyone they dont like/lose to and now your pissed because you just wallbanged somekid and now your banned for (x) ammount of time, I agree if it was possible id be all for it but realistically I think thats asking a lot out of a creator and until then mute button might be the best option.(not that i agree with that either;)
---
If he becomes 1 speed with shield and 2 speed with everything else, he would he great
---
Yeah, that's pretty dope. Like if a random player just TKed somebody and someone else joins in, it could be nice to know if our team is weak or strong. Other than that, I don't see any other utility to this.

A bit more than a pixel but yes. Btw what skin are you wearing this season?

Not really. Game development isn't as easy as this makes it out to be.

How bad did you get beat?
---
They technically can use it, if you know Terrorists are sometimes able to lock on to you through walls and they'll start shooting, which can inadvertently cause this bug.
---
Fuck no it made some maps super attack favored 
---
People did for a while. but at the end of the day matchmaking was always broken but now they‚Äôre hiding some of the more embarrassingly bad ones. 
---
Bought one ;)
---
Then
---
Lmao they made bleeding a real thing
---
Means nothing. If you really think a rank made by ridicoulus matchmaking decides if someone gets into esports league, then theres nothing i can do for you. Loads of professionals are in Gold ranks.
---
You cant say the n word with an ‚Äúr‚Äù even if its the soft one. 
---
As my friend puts it "anybody caught roaming without picking their armor up first will be rewarded with a complimentary MP5 round to the face"
---
I don't think it's a bad thing you are trying to do, I just think it won't have any effect on the game. The proaffinity filter is a perfect example, people always find a way to be toxic as long as they have means to. By taking away chat and voip would be taking away the game mechanics etc. I'm not the one to figure this shit out but best of luck to the Gamers who fight for less toxic gaming environment 
---
It is the Watch Dogs Skin
---
No if I did there would be no point to this post lol, and to top it all off I lost that game and lost MMR for that game + the non existent abandon LOL 
---
I'm a network engineer by trade, I know more about this than you do.
---
Except we don't want more content, we want the game to work. Fix it first, then add content...
---
You arent getting a response from Ubi. They had this huge "transparency" campaign in Year 1 or 2 that lasted all of like, 3 seasons.
---
No that‚Äôs not why. The reason is exactly as I stated, this is pretty commonly known. Any game or service in the game that‚Äôs technically a beta does not require pre approval from Sony/Microsoft to update. There‚Äôs certain procedure that are taken by devs to make large updates to games and the beta tag allows them to bypass that
---
Tower
---
It's okay because "rAnK iS iN bEtA"
---
They have tons of games not one
---
Would it be like a DnD thing? I could see that working tbh.
---
The night maps are still on cas and they don‚Äôt belong in ranked do to some imbalances and just how night is generally more visual and not competitive 
---
Am Cav main. Can confirm 
---
Underrated comment.
---
Thanks

Somebody hit up Netflix right now
---
Yea I would agree, if there were a ela buff it be after castle and lion
---
I hope they don‚Äôt change lions guns cuz I love the v308 
---
Everybody gangster till fuse charge activates 
---
My only comments:
---
1 would hurt the overall meta with inexperienced castles trying so hard to deny drones that they lock defenders out of key areas even MORE often
---
3 would be v fun if it was a Nomad style knockdown rather than DBNO. Still gives shield opportunity to secure kill in 1v1 but requires coordination with team if they want to take on more opponents
---
I think he meant meant employees
---
Yeah hundreds of employees not thousands 
---
Older one. I have it. 
---
There are lots of fallacies in this game that take a backseat to logic due to its nature as a fps not a rpg. Do you watch porn and question why the pool guy never brings chlorine? No. You care about getting a headshot in the former and a money shot in the latter. 
---
I am a 23 year old female. I use my mic maybe once a day during a match because the player base is mainly teenage boys and every single time I make a call out someone says "are you a girl?" I wish I could record voice chat through Xbox, because people have said some pretty crazy shit to me. I've gotten everything from an innocent "I didn't know girls played video games" to "you should be sucking my dick instead of playing my game"
---
And even when people aren't mean/weird at first, every single guy I've added as a friend to play with later (except for a few former Marines that I befriended in a match) ends up sending me his number and harassing me to text him or add him on Snapchat until I eventually block them. 
---
Maybe this doesn't happen at higher ranks but I've played 6 or 7 ranked matches in the last 2 days and every single one has had players drop after a round or two. I haven't played a 5 on 5 game in a while. It's usually at best 4 on 4, at worst 5 on 3. 
---
what realism does it have lol 
---
Its annoying
---
Idk what they can do but its honestly one of the worse games community wise because of this. I cant use voice anymore or people go apeshit. It sucks and its a big reason I dont play anymore.
---
Replace the movie posters at the movie house with this. People will be wildin
---
Don‚Äôt give Uni any ideas
---
I was thinking about doing something along those lines, especially with characters.  If this were to come to fruition.  I've got a lot of ideas right now, I just need a good couple hours of spare time in a row to just sit and give it some actual thought.

Hello CrashBreese, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ad2dac/mid_banned/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
But then you get tapped if they aren‚Äôt crouching 
---
As of late, wether a ranked map gets removed depends on flow. There needs to be plenty of entrances both close and far from obj for attackers and plenty of rotations, hatches and flank routes for defenders. This all then needs to be done in balance in a visually pleasing way. Skyscraper does all of this and if you bring plenty if claymores and watch angles you can punish defenders who thought they could get a quick frag.
---
Why would I be complaining about that?
---

Just grow your hair out shampoo at lest every other day and trim your hair an inch every couple months or so to get rid of split ends

Long as he is making good elo and squadding up road to plat still possible 
---
Yes

It was mainly gold 1 or 3 but then my friends got bored of rainbow so I started going solo and you can probably tell what happens when you go solo 
---
When ela walk past
---
I'm confused I thought this was Indiana Jones?
---
But I mean the style, like straight thin, like not too much volume 
---
That was grim sky. He is plat 3 this season. 
---
Try doing a "rebuild database " on your ps4.
---
It's his hair type, if you don't have it you don't have it.
---
Well now we can‚Äôt stand still thanks to the crouch spammers
---
The reason is you dont have a mic and they weren‚Äôt aware of your strategy. Solution: Blame them 
---
I too hate how all ubisoft employees aren't machines that work 24/7 to fix every bug and glitch

*Little tiny holes coming up.*
---
Without ADS?
---
"It Seems my calculations were incorrect..."
---
I completely agree. And I said this earlier in this thread but muting your team in a game that requires you to communicate is a shit option.
---
That happens when anyone stands on a shield like that now
---
Play with friends avoid randos. No more tks. 
---
On console the best way to get kills is to unshield, crouch, aim the laser to the mid chest, and stand up and ADS relatively fast. This will put your crosshairs in their head. Just hope they don‚Äôt get lucky. Or ya know, I‚Äôve seen a guy dropshot with Monty.
---
That and the MMR you earned in the ranked game would be cool
---
I would love to hear your opinions when they make an Irish operator wearing Lederhosen or some shit because he's white. 
---
I'm with you til the whole always day thing cause nighttime has never really been an issue for me and only really adds a bit of aesthetic
---
Night time matches I think are ok, as long as it's only in casual and NOT Ranked. Other than that, I'm all for EVERYTHING in this post.
---
Why is kixtar?
---
Or maybe, just listen its his armor plates,  why didnt anyone think of that, silly berries.
---
I like the idea of a forgive system, but not the punish system. The punish system would very much get abused.

Nah but I try and enjoy this subreddit and it gets tough when all I see is people bitching. I did get some hate messages recently but we kicked their ass so it's not like I'm upset
---
She's still the thicccest. What's your point?
---
I'll always upvote people who upvote my comments
---
The current meta is playing ash, having impeccable aim and great flicks. Simply run into the room crouch spamming or strafing, and aim for the head. Defenders can‚Äôt do jack. Everyone hates it, even me, but it works
---
Basically. Boil down to which op you play or like the most.
---
There's a comment thread where a guy was making jokes and I joined him I couldve easily fixed it but just decided to post it anyway and if you were to look at my most recent post I just finished a weathered dayz logo that's much more refined
---
Yep It‚Äôs fake cause the real one is from the ottoman era in Egypt or something close to that time so it‚Äôs pretty old and it‚Äôs a beautiful looking artifact so yeah if the Moroccan vets were to hold these they probably would be something close to the real one but not it and if it‚Äôs a joke then I would gladly be woooshed
---
They both have horses on the handle
---
I agree that joining in progress matches a few times is fine but when you jump on for a  round of playing and you get 6-7 games in a row that are in progress it gets annoying. Then you get those that have toxic 4 mans that TK you just because and over time you've just had enough of it.
---
If casual is prep phase to ranked than tk should be taken out of casual. And also taking the risk of not knowing your teammates location makes ranked more challenging and more appealing. Removing ping would be a great idea and removing kill feed is a good idea as well. Casual should be a  scrub compare to ranked. I guess if been playing siege too long. Iv been playing since  black ice and finding it hard to keep playing due to the fact the only adjustment to the games is new ops  and new maps. When is the new game mode is going to be released. Iv  spent too much money on the game that it make me sick that I keep shuporting a trash game compare to most games 
---
Hmm... 
---
Sledge.
---
Walls are nothing to him.
---
*Nothing.*
---
really depends on what you want to do
---
Sledge can on play vertically on floors unlike buck and jackal but he has 2 good guns.
---
Jackal is probably the worst at playing vertically but he has the best gun and he can track roamers (he doesn't have frags tho)
---
Buck is the best at vertical destruction since he can swap the quickest between his shotty and primary. His AR is very good but can be a bit tricky to use
---
Lol, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt see me bitching‚Äù also known as, I‚Äôm blinded by the fun mechanics of the game, and won‚Äôt criticize ubisoft for their archaic ranked mode. 
---
Did it reset your graphic settings?
---
Looks like mouse and keyboard. Unless they have an elite or scuf because basic controller can't crouch spam. 
---
I am currently under investigation and facing a ban because I said ‚Äúretard‚Äù in an M rated game.
---
Thanks guys.
---
Maybe your PC sucks?
---
I want to die
---
As a frequent shield user at a high gold low plat level I disagree, I find myself getting headshotted and me actually getting a kill at a 50/50 split. 
---
Dokkaebi is modeled after a real Korean model I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Move on dude I also play since dust line and have 1500 hours. Casual should exactly be the same in my opinion they could change both or nothing but I would say ur just started with siege and now realized u want a more Hardcore shooter? Try out insurgency sandstorm, squad, ready or not(when released), or play arma if gives u what you want. In R6 they have to stay more casual to be viable for every player
---
For me they just have to fix the game itself and iam happy for the next 1000 hours as long they just add new ops and maps because for me the game fits and if not there are the other games I play on side with R6 so I have both and iam rly happy this way
---
This one time I got downvoted to hell on a post about harassment by a bunch of white knights cause op was a girl
---
If anything women are treated a lot better than everyone else
---
I'm going to have to disagree on this one. Team killing and runouts are different issues altogether and can't be lumped in together under the banner of toxicity.
---
Firstly, there's no way to counter team killing, but the same cannot be said for runouts. You can place down claymores, get teammates to watch common spots, stay vigilant while approaching the site, and leave drones to get alerted to runouts in advance.
---
Secondly, runouts are equal opportunity and aren't inherently against the spirit of the game like team killing is. It's a two-way street. You can create a level playing field. On the other hand, you can't force an opponent to start team killing once a teammate starts doing so.
---
I‚Äôm high and this sentence almost made me reboot like a middle school computer. 
---
How to solve sexual harassment and racism:
---
1. Grow thicker skin
---
2. Mute the people triggering you
---
3. Turn off your pc and go to your safe space so the rest of us can enjoy the game without your whining and bullshit. 
---
Simple fix really. 
---
Or, ***oooor*** I realized that there are worse things, took the loss, and moved on
---
Or you know, disable friendly fire in casual cause it‚Äôs meant to be a carefree experience and I shouldn‚Äôt get teamkilled for a dumb choice I made in a 1v5
---
I'll take a look
---
1. You either don't own it
---
2. You have not checked the correct operators
---
3. You're not looking at the correct section of the operator customization. 
---
Check those 3 then come back. 
---
Considering her Scorpion was nerfed to the point that it's her shotgun; I can understand why Ubi left her shotgun alone. You can still take her on with a rifle as long as she doesn't get the drop on you. 
---
Well, not only these 3 but any operator with a breacing charge or a soft destruction gadget(like zofia or ash) can play vertically too but I think sledge is better because you can destoy way more floors or soft construction with him.
---
Bandit is the next character in Smash, confirmed. 
---
No.
---
Go ahead
---
Impacts dont kill enemy's in one hit unless their weak.

R6 feedback is like fan fiction of popular franchises (Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and many more). Some great ideas, some not so well thought out ones. But are they ever gonna be adopted into the official release? Nopesydopsey

I am surprised you got friendly fire from two sets of walls XD 
---
Arabian stallions play a large part in Arab culture, thus it makes sense. 
---
Are you sure about that? Animals are seen as quite sacred in the Qu'ran
---
"There is not an animal that lives on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but they form communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they all shall be gathered to their Lord in the end" (Quran 6:38).
---
Muhammad said, "Do not use the backs of your animals as chairs. Allah has made them subject to you so that by them you can reach places that you would not otherwise be able to reach except with great fatigue." - Bukhari 
---
 A group of companions was once traveling with Muhammad when he left them for a while. During his absence, they saw a bird with its two young, and they took the young ones from the nest. The mother bird was circling above in the air, beating its wings in grief, when Muhammad came back and said, ‚Äã"Who has hurt the feelings of this bird by taking its young? Return them to her." - bukhari
---
Practice your aim on terrorist hunt (single player) until you fell comfortable. Also turn off aim assist in settings otherwise the single player will be really easy. Try and learn the maps, if you need to make your own custom game and walk around a map. Also, make sure it is a map which is used in ranked. Try to learn about the operators and how to counter them too.

To start with it places you against other horrible players, you should be fine

I'm starting to seriously think that S.T.A.L.K.E.R is much playable than Siege yahh

I mostly agree with crouch and castle problems, but also would like to mention that casual should have only 2 differences from ranked: no rank and less (but longer) rounds

This is mute
---
So far the only way to deal with it seems to be just dealing with it, after the game take a small break and then head for a new one hoping not to have these guys. Or play with a friend or two.
---
" inspired by traditional Indian and Hindu culture and art"
---
It was not inspired by Hindu or Indian art at all. It was inspired by Middle Eastern/Persian Islamic art which is the cultural origin of the Mughals.

Yup, they really do. I play on Pc and ps4, but I've noticed that tk and all that shit happens more to me on console that in pc.

Honestly I have put atleast 100 days in this game. I'm 19 and I am past the glory of getting the new call of duty and this is the only game that still let's me feel like a 12 year old. I have made some amazing friends in the community and I have actually made enemy's. This for me is the new Halo community, its standing stronger than any other as of right now. Pick up the game.
---
Starter edition checking in lol. Just bought S4 pass

I have 3 Ice skins and only 1 Black Ice skin and it's for the Frosts shotgun when you could get it in the shop

Happened to me the other day and it was the worst. Nothing like being terrorised by some arsehole and not being able to do a damn thing about it.
---
Should add me. Your_Alpha. Maybe play some games. 
---
if I get my account we gotta play some games this is my username  FriedChicken98 
---
Tho I'm pretty sure it must be an anachronism if it exists.
---
Do you have anything to back your claim? And are you seriously equating "toxicity" with rape and murder?
---
General reposti, you are an old one!
---
Maybe yeah, haven't played in a while.
---
Ranks and mmr mean nothing they are there and ranking systems in competitive games exist to calculate your probability of winning the match.
---
If you and your team are golds and are vsing plats the probability shows that your team is likely to loose since you are a lower rank.
---
The problem with ranking systems in these types of games is they HAVE to take the games outcome so if you carry with like 10+ kills but still lose you lose points they can't just rank you based off of how well you do.m, because then many people would be higher then they belong.
---
This community loooooves to bitch about the problem but don't realize that nearly every competitive shooter has the same problems in their ranking system. Look at csgo, that games ranking system is beyond broken which causes people to play 3rd party stuff like ESEA or Faceit
---
What 700h and lvl 134 ? Im lvl 135 with 500h
---
Another thi g they should do is when a new season comes out, the map that comes with it is not in ranked. Also, if you hit the normal button you press for casual, you cant get the new map. If you wanna play the new map press the button in the bottom right for it. Do that for a while until most people learn it.
---
Hacking: No
---
Bugs: Kinda
---
Ok so now im more confused than ever because I cant decide whether or not youre joking or actually being serious since I dont see a ‚Äú/s‚Äù anywhere. ill give you the benefit of the doubt that you left it at another sub and assume youre just trolling
---
Photoshopped lmao
---
I'll be honest with you. Yes, this game is hard and sometimes requires changes in your hardware/peripherals (necessary only).
---
Watch Serenity17, Get_Flanked and Coconut Brah. You will learn a lot.
---
First 100 Levels of this game would go in learning basics and set your aim only.
---
About the Hardware and Peripheral Changes, if you are not used to use Headphones or a nice mouse. You might need to get a headphone and a good sensor mouse.

"Thank you for scouting all those hostages for me &lt;3"
---
How many year passes did you buy? I bought 3 (and now 4) and I'm pretty close to this with 'only' 370 hrs. 
---
ranked should have pro league rules for sure, but being able to see your teammates through walls is not really and advantage.
---
Ranked is already quite different, there are less unbalanced maps and more rounds, you can choose your site as well. 
---
I don't know what the problem is with runouts
---
Don't worry that's basically two hours of Jeff bezos' time, I'm sure he will take one for the team.
---
The thing happened there can happen in Casual, Custom as well. This has nothing to do with Ranked.
---
rank stagnation. the more games you've played, the lower the elo you gain. this is because the game thinks that you are around that level.
---
this is also why the first few games of ranked each season is probably your best bet at ranking up since you gain more elo. 
---
I got that a while back and actually hate it. It just doesn't look that good on most guns.

Hi. You can certainly play this game on Uplay without using the Steam.
---
But for that you need to buy a totally new game with new uplay account.
---
You cannot use the same Uplay account.
---
Go, signup a new Uplay Account, buy from that Uplay Account.
---
(At the end, you will have 1 Steam + Uplay Copy and One Uplay Only with new Uplay Account).
---
its not that rampant mate, I haven't encountered a tker in ranked for quite a few month
---
In awe of the size of this lad
---
Then people are just gonna leave if the actually start a match.
---
I saying changing is hard, and I don't see the toxic part of the community changing because we told them to. But we can contain them with matchmaking them with other offenders, the same way as we contain the worst members of society in prisons. But you already knew what I wanted to say, and yet chose to make stupid oversimplifications. You'd have a bright future in Ubisoft. 
---
And Dogshit should become Casual.
---
No. 
---
And no that title goes to rook best op ever
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
There isn't really an issue in that clip though
---
They have an expectation to live up to with a product of this age. The point is that the game is not performing the way it should given the time span. Also the expense shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for ubi given their profits. It‚Äôs not necessarily a hate post for ubi‚Äôs employees it‚Äôs more against ubisoft‚Äôs project management than anything else.
---
Depends on your playstyle. If you can survive and actively help your team, get Nomad. If you die easily/spawnpeak/roam get Kaid as he offers a slightly more passive playstyle. They both serve greatly different purposes, so it depends largely on how you view yourself as.
---
/u/JohnDoeRow9 Hi, Contact Ubisoft and they will be able to help you.

Start using Authy instead of Google Authenticator as it can sync the codes between PC/Mobile/Tablets.

Hi, Try to record the incident and send that to the Ubisoft or Post here.

TKing back them isn't going to help much and it's as much punishable the same as they are for TKing you.

Barking back to dogs doesn't help you.
---
Moderately high ping (below 200 or so) can be an advantage if you play very aggressive. But what really matters is the difference between your ping and the opponent's, then it is whoever peeks that has the advantage. 
---
You forgot to put /s because people can't understand sarcasm smh
---
What was the meme there?
---
just mute him man
---
A humble redditor explained it, so I'll summarize it:
---
When standing still, your shots are delayed when communicating to the server, so you are at a disadvantage.
---
But when you are moving AND have high ping, BOTH your shots and movement get registered late. As a result, you show up on your opponent's screen later than he you see him. In the sense, you see him before he sees you, resulting in pre fires that make you think they are hacking.
---
I'm still confused why streamers like macie Jay and Varsity gaming say it's a myth and doesn't really provide an advantage.
---
Nah because it‚Äôs world war 1 uniform not 2

If you crouch spam In Battlefield V you get slow down that could also be nice

I can never unsee that now omg

I disagree with the No in-progress game option, as people will be abandoned in 2v5 games. There should be an incentive like a bonus renown booster for those who join in-progress games
---
Any time I've questioned people in game I've been tkd until the match was over. Didn't matter if it was casua lor ranked. Is there no punishment in this game?

I‚Äôm seeing a new meme format in this one.

I'm not entirely sure, try it out and see what comes of it.

Try a full reinstallation in that case.

Weapon, and damge excuses go out the window when you have the advantage of aiming ads'ing and shooting the other person on your own terms in safety and quickly unless they are fully dedicated to only watching you and pre aiming.

Thank you very much this helped find the answer to my question.  
---
Have a good day!
---
God damn man that clean clean af!
---
I would prefer them to allow people to disable it, then put a strong reason why you shouldn't. Not giving any choice is basically meaning that there is no reason to create an incentive for putting up with it.
---
it happened to me too
---
Just let people use him in Casual. They‚Äôve deemed him broken. Don‚Äôt force us to play him in ranked with zero ability to ban him.

---
It's too hot in Australia to wear something like that.
---
3 doesn't fix what makes shields cancer (lean spam and blitz) but nerfs 'fair' shield play. 
---
Nobody should be able to lean/crouch spam.
---
Shield ops should not be able to shoot through a doorway or window if their hand is occluded by a wall.
---
Something needs to be done to balance Blitz.
---
After all this shield OPs would be fair if a tad underpowered, as opposed to Macie's suggestions which do nothing about what makes shields broken but nerfs fair playstyle. If you are getting killed by shields at medium range who aren't lean spamming, the problem is you. 
---
She is boring, you hit middle-mouse and you already influenced the round, you had to do nothing to achieve something that can be life saving. Her ar is pretty bad, the lmg is great, the shotgun is amazing. Frags make her a bit more fun, but as an operator that is designed to be a support, you don't realy use them so often.  
---
Let's take a look at other operators that have to do something to influence the round: 
---
  
---
\-Thermite: 
---
1. You have to avoid spawnpeeks and get safely to the site. 
---
2. You have to avoid being Bandit tricked, Mute jammed, and wait for Maverick, Thatcher, Twitch, making you an easy target for runouts. I scarcely see anyone do that, but it's possible and usualy happens on some maps. Let's take Oregon laundry for an example. Laundry hatch can be defended from 4 angles that you have to watch out for and take gun fights if they try to peek you. 
---
3. After taking necessary gun fights and staying alive you can open a wall.
---
After all you did you can open 1 wall.
---
\-Maverick:
---
1. Again, you have to avoid spawnpeeks ang get safely to the site.
---
2. You have to get into breathing range with the wall, and you're an easy target for anyone that is near you. Bandit/Kaid can tickle you with their Battery/Claw. Anyone can nitro you, shot you or run out to you.
---
3. Make a big enough line so you're able to shoot out the batteries or enemies AND still avoid getting killed.
---
Now you influenced the round.
---
\-Blitz (I know this is controversial):
---
1. You need to be close enough to an enemy to flash them (4 meters) that they can \*easily\* snipe you out. If they can aim well enough.
---
2. You have to watch out for flanks, barbed wire, traps, and enemies that are infront of you, because you have a body shield that doesn't mean that they can't shoot your legs.
---
3. After getting close to an enemy and flashing them you have to avoid being blind fired, knifed or flanked.
---
You had to stay alive between 5 enemies that all could watch you from 5 different angles, just to get one kill.
---
The shield thing is just a straight up nerf. It nerfs it even in CQC.
---
Casual isn't just filled with people that don't know what they're doing. I play casual all the time and I've never once had a free hatch opening in office.
---
Smoke already has a plague doctor headgear; Pestilence.
---
Imo it's bad. 
---
Ubisoft can't solve "racism and sexual harassment", that's impossible. What they can do is look at other online games and try to introduce systems to combat toxicity, as racism and sexual harassment falls under toxicity, but it's not something separate they can deal with. 
---
Majestic
---

---
Yeah, Blitz‚Äôs design screams ‚Äúsupport op.‚Äù
---
Yeah the japanese font is pretty scary
---
Needs more static
---
It was fixed
---
Your's isn't?
---
If they are too OP, which most ops are when released btw, then you should be allowed to ban them. They aren‚Äôt letting pro players use them for months. 
---
That reaction. :D
---
And Rook's breakfast
---
Number 5 shouldn‚Äôt happen because then you can‚Äôt communicate with people
---
A corset? Gotta look good for the attackers.
---
What is Kixtar?
---
It‚Äôs just rhat running a compensator isn‚Äôt really that great at reducing recoil, the compensator is only viable when a weapon has really bad sideways recoil drift, or you are running an lmg, and you‚Äôre prefiring the shit out of everyone. Muzzle brake is by far the better option, as it reduces the recoil a lot better than the conpensator
---
The shield nerf would gut shields operators in general. We need a fix to the perspective issues before we do that. 
---
&gt;So what ?
---
If there are no backfills then it becoming a 2v5 would be much higher. 
---
well you even said it yourself it was in the game at some point...
---
Tachankas were originally horse-drawn carts or wagons with a machine gun installed in the back, so the horse could literally be dead.
---
Shields need buffs and nerfs. If you are nerfing something to reduce frustration/increase fun to play against, it needs to receive buffs as well. *cough Clash*
---
IMO, my biggest problem with shields is that too few defensive operators have any tools that let them deal with shields. There is a lack of weapons/throwables that let you get behind a shield even to do a small amount of damage. I usually find myself as a character with no explosives, no operator ability to deal damage and a shotgun facing down a Monty.
---
This is honestly some of the best work I've seen on here. How much did they cost?
---
I was blown away by these ‚Äúbulletproof cameras‚Äù that some operators seem to have, I have no idea how best to utilize them yet but they seem pretty neat.
---
Muzzle brake is only good for burst and tap firing , compensator is the better option if you‚Äôre running a weapon with a fire rate around 600 rpm or higher
---
&gt;on your own terms in safety
---
You only have safety in a xv1, as long as there are two defenders you are vulnerable in a shield if you are sitting crouched waiting for someone not to pay attention to you. Furthermore they can just close to close range and shoot over your shield or shoot your legs if you stand. If it comes to a knife battle if it's a lan you'll circle indefinitely knifing him until either has a teammate clean up, and if it's on servers you'll circle until you desync ahead of his rotation and kill him. The only shield that counters this is Blitz. 
---
Furthermore you are much faster than every shield except blitz, you can just back out of los and flank. When it comes to shields you can win by playing aggressively, you can win by retreating, and that is only considering a single defender. 
---
The only range shields win is mid range if you stay in their field of fire and don't pay attention to them, and literally any operator can get an easy frag on you in that situation. 
---
Ew no
---
Not funny reply take points hahahahahajajajjjajajaj
---
A1 aim my guy 
---
But I've been waiting for the past 3 weeks
---
NO.1 and NO.4 i hope never even come to this game. NO.1 due to it requiring so much basic utility to deal with 1 castle, add 2 more and it pretty much punishes your team if you have a bad comp. This makes solo q a lot worse if the team doesn't pick a wide variety comp to deal with most situations. Castle needs faster accessibility rather than having a 3-4 second break down of a castle that makes a lot of noise. This going between all operators. And NO.4 is just obvious, it limits matchmaking so much to the point we'll end up wanting the change reverted. 
---
Or zofias withstand ability to literally get the fuck off the floor. 
---
Her not being able to use something attached to her thumb, was kind of weird to her build.
---
Never thought to check. If his ping was consistent throughout the match we were both around 25-35
---
Hey what about my idea for a castle buff?
---
I just realized that Rook was born in Tours, when "The Rook" chess piece is called "La Tour" in French. Wow Ubisoft, wow.
---
no, i'd say remove more acogs from ops. even from some attacker guns. like ash's r4c, kaid's slug shotgun and any other gun with above-average damage or firerate
---
Not like we have any real-time reflections in Siege already. 
---
It was an incident in sussex
---
You already get a bonus by joining a casual mid-game - if you win it's an easy Alpha Pack wheel spin. 
---
I like to switch between the two whenever I play Ash but I come back to the G36 way more often than not mainly because I'm not that good at controlling recoil (I play on console) so G just works better for me lol
---
IDK where you've been because in this whole conversation when I said you can play claw so you don't have to take your FINGER OFF THE STICK
---
Are players really this bad on console?
---
Or with Sussex
---
I play on xbox and I use muzzle break, acog and foregrip with the r4c and I seem to do well with it
---
No, just youüëç
---
Well, it's definitely easier to explain with visuals. New players wouldn't even know the calls for each location in a text guide.
---
Seeing as both buck and sledge bring frags as well as the ability to destroy floors and walls it depends on what you need.
---
Do you need an op for ceiling destruction? Take Buck. Do you need an op who‚Äôs overall kit is the best? Take sledge.
---
I put sledge ahead of buck simply because of price as well as weapons. Sledge has a fantastic AR a semi decent shotgun and the SMG-11. Buck on the other hand only has a decent AR and then his DMR which is good just at long range. Buck is also restricted to a pistol secondary. Now why don‚Äôt I mention jackal? At least to myself I use his kit much differently than vertical gameplay plus he doesn‚Äôt have frags.
---
This has been a problem I‚Äôve noticed since Wind Bastion. It really needs to be fixed since Blitz is already a pain in the ass and now the one knife you get off doesn‚Äôt register?
---
2 words:
---
Angled.Grip 
---
ACOGs are overrated 
---
1 letter:
---
k
---
Check to make sure it‚Äôs installed 
---
Ask ubi support.
---
well not everyone has That mentality when they play the game, they may just want to chill and play some games in casual, not ranked. In which case it is nearly impossible to do so because people join and leave games constantly, that‚Äôs why I usually just play a few terrorist hunts if I‚Äôm waiting on someone. No need to ruin someone‚Äôs game by joining even though you know you will leave in the middle of it
---
Oh I hate you... Flash Hider is WAY better for that recoil with Ash. 
---
why? 
---
You said with your $30 controller 
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, he‚Äôs holding the L85 LSW. 
---
Wow, another LMG-AR mix!
---
Valk being docile as fuck, frightens and infuriates me.
---
WOW , never saw anything like this! GJ 
---
The best way.
---
IDK, but I've tested both, being a console pleb who can't control recoil that well and I just like the flash Hider way more for her recoil.
---
Where is there racism and sexual harassment in this game? I have 200 hours exclusively in multiplayer and have never experienced anything besides a rouge troll spamming the N-word, immediately getting banned.
---
Picture on the right looks like legit fake, badly photoshop made
---
Yepüëç, so you should probably do better than me my mans
---
The right pic looks like Bad cosplay/ photoshop lol 
---
"Bulletproof", that's quite wrong, since most of the weapons are automatic and/or with an ACOG on it, which makes quite easier to shoot at the arms or legs, Fuze... Is... The best example for that. People just tend to asume that when you have a shield you can't take damage or something.
---
"siege is dying", uhm no but ok
---
Actually cant come up with a stable arguement for this one fair enough point
---
Can‚Äôt lose what you never had ü§£
---
It kinda is, all my friends are not playing the game much anymore, we playing things like BF4, BO4, BFV, etc. Game needs  a big fix
---
Maybe enlarge the mute a little so the focus is more on his face with the finger on his mouth? That would be more movie poster-y
---
I agree on the fix thing but siege is def not dying.
---
That kinda destroyes the point of the DBNO State
---
Yeah but it was only during alpha the stopped using them in the beta and main game for the reason above
---
An knife can go though a bulletproof vest.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who can actually hear when and where he‚Äôs using his torch when I‚Äôm on defense. Killed many Mavericks who forget a hole can go both ways.

yeah last one was lucky asf, literally last second of the round.

Yup.

Wow ur dillusional

Thats the cutest thing ever. Good work OP!

Lean-spamming should be punished like crouch-spamming is being proposed here.

Last year i play Siege everyday. But now i throw it in the garbage. This Game has so many bugs and glitches. And this is for a competitive Game really sad and frustraded. 
---
That was nice
---
soloing back to plat , gold 1 currently . Thanks for the comment !

Yea speaking of client side debris, hey NOXN add thats aswell and fixing the heavy use of MnK users on console now i think of it. Those are just as annoying as the others listed
---
I was kidding

*delusional 
---
Siege has actually been growing. Not dying 
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/359550
---
where did you get that number from?
---
This is absolutely mind-blowing. 
---
&gt;Leaving a match mid-game should be punishable. If a person leaves matches multiple times per day, a timeout for matchmaking should be given, with renown penalties as a severe punishment.
---
No, it's literally called casual and it's a video game. People have other stuff to do in their own lives. Ranked exists in this game as well play that if you want to play with people that take it as seriously as you do.
---
&gt;Implementation of a mirror damage system
---
Also just no. You don't even need to test it, it would flat out break the game as it's designed. The inherent risk of doing damage to your teammates is part of the game at it's core but you'd have the teams be down 2 or more people instead of one simply because people made a mistake.  You'd make such a drastic change to how the game is played just to combat trolling which would still happen just in a different manner? 
---
You bring up the pros as inspiration for your idea but there have even been TKs from mistakes/being stupid in the pro matches that just goes to show how possible it is because of how this game is designed and designed to be.
---
You too man. 
---
I love seeing people with the red crow plat charm still on thier guns.
---
Just a friendly reminder - Using macros is forbidden in this game (Source - [Rainbow Six Siege Code of Conduct](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-326395-16/rainbow-six-siege-code-of-conduct))
---
It‚Äôs 5 kills. Literally defined as 5. 
---
This isn't viable but it is a lot of fun to run her fish rifle with suppressor and irons to play a game of paintball
---
This game is age restricted ?
---
Do you have glacier skins tho?
---
Take ela out of the equation here, 90% of the time at the end of the round all her mines will be gone, lesion may only have a few gu‚Äôs left and can be countered with thatcher, IQ and Twitch, and Echo is a lazy ass. The moment he dies, his Yokais can just scan which doesn‚Äôt do much at the end of a round when one person is contesting.
---
I can believe you earning 10 points per win after a significant amount of games, but to lose 90 per loss? You have no proof, and I doubt this is happening to anyone else.
---
You all have forgotten one very cute operator. I'm sorry but Monty is adorable. 
---
I think it's safe to say you definitely don't use a ruler, as none of your lines are straight
---
what the fuck
---
wait GSG9 or GIGN?
---
Yeah I never got how people couldn‚Äôt understand sarcasm through text,Like it‚Äôs not that hard 
---
Don‚Äôt you think a melee mechanic like that would make them even more underpowered? There‚Äôs a lot of people out there who can‚Äôt aim for shit
---
It‚Äôs all personal preference.
---
Then who will fill in the vacant spot when one of your teammates have left? I guess everyone will have it enabled for sure.
---
As other mentioned the best way to fix this is to give a player backfill bonus.
---
Based on that Maverick offers a lot of flexibility for sneaking up on your opponents, while still having the firepower in an emergency situation
---
No friendly fire is a necessity. Otherwise just have 5 guys firing nonstop charge right into objective 
---
Yeah I'll play. I can help tutor a little bit as well
---
Maybe clash she is a more support based character compared to the rest and is easy to relax using or meastro. Finka, Alibi, Maverick and Nomad I would not recommend because you need to be overly concentrated to play them 
---
That guy is literally copper IV
---
This is a strike pack, you cant do macros on mnk console because the memory wont support it unless connected to an actual computer. 
---
Gign

What i do after droning out the room is I break the bottom of the door with 2 melees then crawl under. This avoids the loud sound of the door breaking which alerts defenders. Even better, if you have maverick he can do the same thing with his torch with virtually no noise.

Once they fix blitz facing the wrong way he will be in a pretty strong spot again. Making it a knock down at that point would put him in a good spot. And if you can't aim... This might not be the game for you lol. I would wager they didn't include shields so that pleebs can get kills, it's to ad another dimension to the game play
---
Personaly i find the new toggle more (btw pulse main), but i think it should be like other gadgets that could choose between hold and toggle.
---
Well you pay for the advantage, so it's pay to win
---
All he had to do was hide to win, wow.
---
Usually i don‚Äôt leave a comment on posts like this but damn. That was a good shot 
---
Yeah I know killcams are inaccurate but bullets go around corners all the time in siege, just how it is
---
I get that, but why force those 2 particular operators to be locked for toggle. I mean they give you the option for it but those 2 are excluded? Like I don‚Äôt get it. 
---
Okay, ill add you whats your ubioft name?
---
I like it.  One of his voice lines should be ‚Äúif you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball‚Äù
---
Lookin at you
---
I have everything set to toggle and I really enjoy it, but it did take some getting use to.
---
Nowadays, you die the same way as if you got knifed
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they have a separate setting, if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
---
She so fun wit da shotty and nades. 
---
And doc has some magic drugs
---
hahahaha he‚Äôs moving so fucking fast
---
No need to be so hostile lol if you don‚Äôt like it move on don‚Äôt try to be an asshole.
---
In competitive overwatch and cod, matches where someone leaves at the beginning or you join halfway through do not effect your stats/ rank, and that should be a given.
---
Crouch spamming is seriously breaking console atm it‚Äôs not fun to play against at all and it just gives players with scuffs/m&amp;kb an even bigger advantage than they already have 
---
Okay thanks
---
It‚Äôs cobalt, I believe.
---
Acogs J√ÑGER, BANDIT, SMONK, SLEDGE, kinda MUTE?
---
Your the reason I'm a sledge main
---
Next stop. Yacht
---
Wouldn't it be too soon though, regarding they just released Blitz's?
---
Valkarie used to have 4 cameras. Blackbeard had 1 shield with 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999 health
---
It‚Äôs not that difficult to figure out. Logging in to Ubisoft‚Äôs website gives you the ability to do it easily
---
I can't I'm on console 
---
Also toxicity. As someone with a .99 K/D, I used to get harassed relentlessly, almost always by teammates too. I have too many hours that I think that stat is permanent too, so i'm glad they removed it lmao.
---
You can simply just run up to her and melee her shield away. Are you serious with this "she needs a nerf"? She's literally one of the worst characters in the game at the moment. It takes her forever to change to her gun so she's dead by the time it's out. Her electricity does jack shit. And it takes a while to charge back up. If you don't like Clash, play Nomad or Zofia. Stop asking for nerfs just because YOU can't handle her.
---
No I‚Äôm 13 and I play with about 7 friends that are all 13 and 14
---
MERICA
---
I fixed it, didn't have 2 step on the right account I feel so stupid!
---
It‚Äôs not a bad idea but sometimes it can lower your chances of winning a gunfight because of the lowered damage. Personally I won‚Äôt put a suppressor on the secondary if it will do more than 50 damage after the damage reduction. I also find it pointless to have a suppressor on defenders secondaries.
---
They had opened the garage and had control of upstairs as well. They also had a Glaz for most of this game and we forgot to choose Mira to help defend the plant. We had a Maestro, but I believe they ended up destroying it and getting the plant down shortly after this. 
---
Really? I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks!
---
This happened to me with a black beard icon on border, he spawned east and I went valley,a bandit random for a run out and bb icon was perfectly over his head,my mind regesterd it a second to late and I was knifed
---
Yo imma be honest I don't think it works like that
---
+10 points for honesty, I simply don‚Äôt know how to deal with her, My situations are mostly she‚Äôs is the last one alive in the objective and camps a corner, I don‚Äôt see any weakpoint whatsoever
---
yes
---
I use silence on Ela/Zofia pistol &amp; IQ pistol. IQ for getting gadgets, Ela/Zofia for pure preference.
---
I only have one account though ü§î
---
Literally anything you say does not help your case, you tried to kill yourself for no real good reason 
---
Cutest gay couple in r6?
---
I would do it but only if you have a solid none shotgun primary, especially if you're on offence and need to take out cams, bandit charges, and all that other stuff. Of course, if you're a shield operator dont surpress your pistol
---
This happens to me but reverse. I‚Äôll be playing Blitz and try to melee someone but I get melee‚Äôd instead 
---
A true meme man who runs the Auto shotty like a badass
---
It's fine if you have difficulty with certain characters but doesn't mean they need a nerf. Learn how to overcome them. If she is sitting in a corner, you can melee her shield and it'll expose part of her leg so you can kill her. She's not Monty where you can't kill him if he's in a corner. I believe in you!
---
LMAO!
---
You won the ban. Congrats, play stupid games win stupid prizes. 
---
I was just thinking about this yesterday. And be able to have tactical flashlights and what not. I think it's an awesome idea 
---
63Kg what does the shield weigh
---
It shall be called: The Boomstick
---
That‚Äôs how angles work 
---
You did better than i evwr could. You have my upvote
---
Play with friends, use looking for group. 
---
Hell yeah
---
I used to play Overwatch before r6, I had the same problem with characters and my assumptions is: ‚Äúhe/she needs a nerf‚Äù
---
Happy Birthday to my main and husband. May all your playes be picked!

This post has layers

How about shooting my squad?

Can ppl fucking stop saying this even if you are playing with friends it can happen 
---
Or just renown cus alpha packs give you commons 11/10 times 
---
Ive is lighter blue
---
With a little more turquoise.
---
no, just older people dont have time to draw meaningless shit like this. only kids bored in school.
---
My question is how do you aim when you crouch this much?
---
Oh, excuse me I thought you would have been more of a beginner :D
---
No way. Being able to smoke a location super easy is really useful. He can also deny entry through doors by fire bombing them. He's also a hardcounter to clash
---
League has voice chat now lol. 
---
No, damage system in siege.
---
Ubi being lazy ?! Who thought
---
Secure area, yuck
---
I know right? I kinda wish he had no voicelines. 
---
There were 10 people total, 3 people to a table and one person got a personal table. There's a coax cable in the room so brought the router down and hooked up a 20 port switcher in the middle. 
---
For teams we split the room in half, mixing teams every now and again.
---
Ok. Thanks
---
Yea?
---
Little tip: If no one is going to anchor the corner (for good reason, that room is a deathtrap), blow up the hatch. Stops the Monty from sticking to the only safe corner available. Also allows any defender who recaps OBJ to retreat &amp; rotate in a safe manner without having to stay in the room because they're trapped.
---
Literally Ashe minus Boston
---
Not like that 
---
I personally think it's a bit too tall, but other than that great job!

Very important issue

Thank you!

Everyone has given you what you asked, so Im going to recommend Teo. He just has fun and doesnt do maps or strats vids

Left after white noise and came back after they nerfed drop shots. Long story short I went from plat 2 to copper 1

Holy shit don't upload aids quality videos please.
---
Graphic settings should be persistent. If not please make sure you don't have software like GeForce experience that optimize graphic settings for you, and Uplay cloud save is working.
---
Not gonna lie, Finka having frags still doesn't want me to play her. I never liked Lion or Finka from day 1 and still refuse to play either operators willingly.
---
I was using the 5 ghz Wi-Fi that sits in the other room and sometimes its range isnt good enough
---
I want to see a crouch spam nerf because on PC everyone can do it regardless if it's okay or not. The problem on console is MnK already is an advantage and this just further widens the gap. At some point you just can't play against MnK. 
---
They look really good, tho in my opinion the sledge could be more like maybe his hammer ?
---
That‚Äôs a lot! Thank you!
---
Chat mutes for individual players are a thing you know.

No way. that's trash dude.

Finka's gadget makes shield more viable, have your shielded teammates line up their laser sight on an enemies head, and the ADS time is instant.
---
We have tried to explain this to him but he doesn't seem to comprehend. I am just glad everyone else knows this lol
---

Stuff like that is why I use a power-line adapter instead of Wi-Fi.

---
Holy shit you must be a god at your prime
---
In this Special case I think you are wrong. I think Headshot is something around a x30 to x40 factor.  
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact math but Headshot (factor &gt;1), Penetration (damage&lt;1 even two or three times maybe), and also damage dropoff (rouge9 has a beautiful Chart there). 
---
He doesn't know...
---
Exactly what I was thinking 
---
very nice very ice

It‚Äôs like countryballa, but siege... neat!

And the Monty was oblivious as well

This woman in the video is a character of an old Brazilian soup opera, and I watched it when I was a kid (I‚Äôm brazilian). It‚Äôs so funny to see her in memes everywhere. Haha
---
Cause the enemy may have just been moving back for a re peek or maybe moving to go downstairs it wasn‚Äôt guaranteed that the enemy would go there just highly probable 
---
Thanks! Black Ice has always been my favorite skin, but I didn't start getting into the game enough to buy skins until after it was removed from the store. 
---
u/its_epi why does Ubi not care about even the easiest of issues in the game and not doing anything about the toxic players?
---
We already have diamond and plat skins.
---
I understand this, but it doesnt make any sense why there are false bans from no racist words but people can literally just N bombs in games all the time with no punishment
---
But it *sounds* really cool with a suppressor, so which is really the best gun?
---
/s
---
Well time to start flexin on them 
---
Wait, black ice was available to purchase? I‚Äôve been playing since there was no DLC and I don‚Äôt remember being able to purchase black ice skins 
---
One of the first things I told my friend upon introducing him to the game: hey man, welcome to Rainbow Six: Pixel Measurements.
---
Yeah i will always remember my first ranked game. I wasnt a good player and was 0-0-3. My team was getting a bit pissed but were still supportive to me. This round i was the only player alive on my team in a 1 v 3. They were still nice and helpful, giving callouts and i ended up clutching the round. The feeling was fantastic and they were congratulating me. We went on to win the game, i dont really see that much of the toxixity everyone complains is ruining the game

Oh? I just assumed it was. How else did you get the skins? Were they always only Alpha packs?

that‚Äôs strangely common, I‚Äôve got one from like belly button height. Must be to do with someone‚Äôs ping as the enemy crouches or something

How does he control his aim while spamming crouch button? Lol thats not scuff thats mouse and keyboard on console.

My only source for this is my old art history teacher and [this Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniconism_in_Islam)

Had a teammate down three people and he got kicked.

18 rated game get over it. You wouldn't even last in an MW2 Xbox 360 chat Jesus Christ why is everyone sensitive. People are more concerned about a word rather than the plethora of bugs and matchmaking issues that plagues this game. Grow a pair of balls

Then since she left it would kill the teammates and she would get banned

So can you like put this on Wallpaper engine cuz I'd love to have Cav dancing for me when I start my PC

How often do you team kill? It may be a visual glitch. I've gotten banned for "63 days" before and I went to support and that fixed it.

Thanks, friend. I‚Äôll give it another shot.
---
What system
---
Well if its the first time you're getting banned enjoy the 30 minutes of silence.
---
**LITERALY UNPLAYABLE**
---
People who smurf get carried to a rank they can't play well in and go to low ranks to feel good about themselves in reality they are just barley decent at the game
---
Probably over multiple games probs solo queued too, I know some the pictures going around shows that on console it will be one diamond and the other 4 copper smurfs to get easy diamond 
---
Just insert a *YEEET* in there

He means the fourth year lol.

oh i know that i meant like it seems like a never ending wait once you select it

I can't even tell you how annoyed I was that you just kept running with a lesion in your foot

Thank you!

I don't know.  Who?
---
Welp. I had teammates line up in front of my shot. 
---
Wait my teammate?
---
Eu boi here to help, dm me if you need me
---
Not in*
---
So in my opinion the only operator not worth using is Tachanka unless it's for the memes.
---
I think what you should do first is play anchor on defense. What that means is your basically the last defense to the objective. Play Rook or Doc, put on the MP5 with ACOG, and use impact nades(Rook) or Bulletproof Cam(Doc). If you play Rook, put down your armor immediately when the round starts. If you play doc, make sure to keep an eye on your teammates health and heal them when you can. When a teammate is down as well, you can revive them with your stim pistol to 75 health. You can also boost teammates and yourself by shooting them with the stim pistol when they're full health. Your job as the anchor is just to defend the objective, hold angles and choke points that enemies might try to go through. 
---
For attacking, I think you should try Thatcher or Thermite. Thatcher disables electronics and has a radius that can go through reinforced walls. You destroy Mute, Bandit, and Kaid gadgets so thermite can peirce through it with his charges. Just follow the Thermite or Hibana so they can tell you where to throw your EMP grenades. Thermite's job is to destroy reinforced walls so you can have another entry onto the objective. Usually people tell you where to put your gadgets on PC and can be helpful. I'm not too sure on console though. 
---
Siege is all about experimentation, this is just my opinion on what you should start with just to get a feel for the game and plus learn some callouts for some maps. Also if you dont know a callout, just call out the compass direction and where they're at. For example, "West Stairs" or something to that nature. Try different operators frequently and dont be afraid to just experiment. If you really want to get good at the game, I'd reccomend watching YouTube videos from Rogue 9 or Get Flanked. They have a bunch of videos to help on what operators do what and best guns. I hope I helped man and welcome to siege. 
---
Apparently not.
---
Probably just balance reasons, it‚Äôs not the most viable bomb site but having a spot like that to sit makes it‚Äôs slightly better 
---
why tf did u keep walking after u got hit by the lesion trap
---
no, they changed it a while back because attackers would purposely run into electric wire or kapkan traps to kill the hostage and win the round
---
I thought it was. Good to know they have a bullet proof desk

I won't disagree that the map can be convoluted. But there are several maps that have these issues. Up in the dorms of Oregon, for example. There are FOUR bedrooms. How do you distinguish those four, without learning the official name for the room, or making up new names that you can only hope and pray random players you encounter also understand and distinguish?

That was a bad ex4mpl3, and it's "negro".

Ok.

So I think they're giving the base OP ctus 3 elites then doing a dlc character. They've given all the base op ctus 3 with Blitz and Glaz filling them out. I don't think we'll get Bandit or Smoke for awhile. I think they'll do the dlc ops first. 
---
Wait nah, my bad, Sledge is the heaviest, I just checked.  Cav is the heaviest *female* op.  Sledge is built like a fucking fridge lmao, he's 6'3 and 209 pounds.

Rook is just barely heavier than Ela, he's only got 9 pounds on her lmao.

So if I turned on Bartlett u and turned off everything else apart from bomb would it count as me completing article 5 and would I get the skin for the aug

They‚Äôll be on pc in diamond games and they‚Äôre not that common

All the operators are realistic, especially someone who can wall hack- scan footprints to figure out the pinpoint location of someone

Sadly lol. I just really want a Bandit elite to go with my main, Jager

More often than not, though, you‚Äôre joining a losing or desperately unbalanced match, so the alpha pack isn‚Äôt so easy.

When climbing, you use 4 limbs

When rappelling, you only use 2

Make sense, right?

It is one hundred percent real , I was in ranked , a cav downed three of my teammates and got removed for team killing as soon as she downed the third I had to go and revive all of them and she couldn‚Äôt join back

They think it's too strong that you could shoot it and it would explode in midair instantly making them go down

the answer is no, because it takes time to move your legs from one step to another, same with arms.

Nah lol you are tilted trying to reverse the roles I'm actually the one trolling you being "big mad" over nothing

Personally I use 4 man ace since it is not a technical "ace". (Forgot to put this in the original comment) no problem

You can't even equip it shut up
---
It seems to me that the appropriate penalty is a 15 minute ban from casual matchmaking.  If they‚Äôve genuinely got to leave to do something, they lose nothing at all; if they‚Äôve ragequit, they have time to chill out; if they‚Äôre looking for an easier match, they have a mild punishment for screwing over their team.
---
&gt;not that hard if you play claw
---
Ok so a weird ass hand position that 90% of gamers id wager dont use just happens to always be used by the type of people on these videos
---
I'd say the best thing to do to get better is learn the ops and play often. Ranked is good to play to when you start, it is hard at first but I think it's the best way to get better.
---
loved the video but i wished there where more ops shown you used only 3 ops for the who time maybe switch it up a bit
---
Lol no ranked (especislly below gold) has serious toxicity issues.
---
Are you aiming or using hip fire? It actually makes a huge difference.
---
I really hope we do get some Aus ops and they better be good cause I've been waiting a long time

Of course it's sarine gas.

I‚Äôve been playing the game since release. Nice troll.

You're very right, but a full team of trusted friends is best.
