Yeah I agree, you do need to fix your video quality.

---
---
Yeah but when you think about it even if you see someone on the sonar its tough figurin out where they really are 
---
It was pure luck. The enemies all came through the same window on that one map that has a open fireplace on the  objective ( I'm bad at remembering map names) and I had thrown a yokai in there 
---
I was wondering the same thing 
---
It‚Äôs interesting and I‚Äôve never seen someone with one 
---
Yeah true
---
Yeah, exactly what i had in mind
---
Why don‚Äôt they just add a one second/ half a second delay between the time you can crouch?

---
 Think of how much harder it would be to kill someone. Every game the attackers would rush.
---
 Fucking dumb cunt. Further down the tweet comments he talks about worse player favoured mechanics. Theres no such thing as that. Theyre just mechanics in a game. I stopped watching king george cause of the amount of bitching he does when he dies, not gonna watch pengu anymore either. Snake is more fun to watch and has music. Hes like a mahvel movie while everyone else is DC. Macy is the batman trilogy so he is still good
---
His laugh sounds like Matt Damon sobbing.
---
The only thing is how fast you can kill someone in this game. They could crouch/lean spam for even a quarter of a second and you could still kill the other person 
---
No. You can't pick and choose. They both abuse peekers advantage and bad hit reg to win gunfights in a game that's supposed to be about strategy and positioning. 
---
I agree. Though I don't think it's THAT important. Apex is a high TTK shooter, shouldn't compare to it. That's like saying HALO doesn't have 1 shot kills except for Snipers. Well duh?
---
The wallpaper? üòÇ
---
The whole "turning it around" works both ways, if you get shot in the body twice from behind you may be lucky enough to turn around and one-shot headshot your attacker.
---
I game at Ultra 4k 60fps so the HD texture pack looks amazing on my PC. Watch some videos online comparing the differences. They change the landscape on some maps. Of course it's better to game at a higher fps but if your PC can handle it then why not? It's free..  
---
Well this shows you did a very good job aha
---
What buck skin is that?
---
Look into Hibanna,Buck,and Frost! Hibanna has a good amount of recoil that goes up a ways and to the right. Buck has a little bit of recoils but is a great breacher and Frost has little recoil with her 9mm C1 and her Traps  are annoying 
---
hah. He used the measurements that people who didn't put a man on the moon use.
---
I guess we have wildly different ideas about what is interesting.
---
Villa I think.
---
They saw NEGAtive I guess.
---
Lol he's only asking for other peoples' opinions and y'all are attacking him like he has the final say in this decision.
---
But when you get 5k with spawn peek, then you have spawn peAked.
---
And I have legitimately spawn peAked in my life before back in R6 Raven Shield days in a map called "Peak".

I don't think pro league players get that much money. I remember King George estimating a while back that maybe the richest teams were getting only 2k per month salary, if that.
---
Streaming is most definitely giving him more but R6 is not CSGO/Dota/LoL money where pros get anywhere from 10-100k per month. I think if r6 keeps growing though it will eventually get close.
---
Lol I was just joking hope I didn't come off as rude

Banning someone for spamming crouch even if an exploit would be dumb as hell.

R6 was a much smaller game back when King George played in pro league. And now R6 is a HUGE title right now so I'm assuming that Pengu gets more than 2k a month from pro league.
---
I like this sight better, fuck that triangle green sharpie bullshit.
---
I hate that the enemy team has guns and explosives. Pengu says the dumbest shit sometimes and if you disagree with him he'll give you the "you're a brain dead player you don't know what you're talking about" i've seen him do it to people in his stream. just let him express his opinion nothing will come out of it.

Deleting thins comment so I don't have a -12 comment

I thought the title said nerfed again
---
I think its be cool if i only detected them while the were moving un-crouched.
---
Granted , in the tweet people who say no to him get an ear full and get shot down were as people who agree get praise , not really asking for opinions imo 
---
I ALMOST agree with him, but if you can hit your headshot before the enemy can, you earned the kill.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks!
---
Game still crashing from something as simple as checking my teammates by pressing tab. 
---
It sounds logical, kind of, most helmets will block pistol rounds, though if this was implemented it would cause issues where half of the head would be invulnerable while others are an insta-kill.

Run into a father and son combo that was obv fake  and they made jokes and stuff and apparently the son hadn't had the talk yet and so the 5th person in our lobby have it to him and they both left the game

Well it's called Karma Farming, but I digress. People can like what they want... Hentai is common for a lot of people and just another kink some poeple enjoy. Just because somone hasn't posted in the Siege community a lot doesn't mean they aren't active, he said he's Copper, meaning he either sucks, isn't very active, or is new, and thya would explain it.
---
The only comment I could find related to him trying to pedal this as real was this: he scared me shitless
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/anpg8m/stop_this_please/efv19me?utm_source=reddit-android
---
And while sure, seems like it, he's not overtly going out of his way to sell it, and this could even have been just a 1v1 with him and his friend that he wanted to share as he had video proof of it for once and hadn't seen it in-game before.
---
There's nothing here to even suggest Karma Farming as it's a legit bug that needs fixing, staged or not and it being  real has nothing to do with core message the post was trying to convey. 
---

I had a similar experience with discord overlay, for some reason it set itself to shift + q and turned itself on after the update so everyone I tried to lean left it would activate the overlay but for whatever reason the overlay didn't show so I had no idea what was going on and it was really frustrating. 
---
Eventually I found out by chance while looking through discord settings, but not before wasting my entire weekend reinstalling and everything trying to get it to work. Have to say I was pissed and dumbfounded at the same time. Which dev sets the default command to shift+q? I'd have expected better for from a app designed with gamers in mind
---
Obviously you've never played on xbox or solo qued. Or you're just blatabtly stupid, either way, you're not worth the oxygen. You probably have 2 hours in siege acting like you know everything.
---
Here's a list of things I've done/issues on my PC which have gotten rid of my freezing, maybe one can help you:
---
- not enough RAM on your PC
---
- using the wrong graphics card (my laptop has come with both a GTX 1050 and a crappy default card, and I found out that rainbow was using the slow one)
---
- try turning off game overlays (discord overlay is the WORST offender)
---
- I've also heard that turning off Cortana can help, but I'm unsure if it does
---
- a startup program could be interfering
---
- a firewall could be causing issues
---
- turn off Windows game mode
---
I just did all of these and so far the freezes have stopped. Try em
---
The problem is that devs need to do so much for nothing. Many people like headshots and many don't care. It's much easier to write a tweet than make a complete rebalance of the game.
---
Ah, good ole memories
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** Kimbli13! ^(hug)
---
Helmets are purely cosmetic because every operator would be forced to wear one if Ubi decide to phase out the 1-headshot-kill mechanic. It would be so weird to see Echo, Valkyrie, Ying and Maverick, for example, being able to tank a round to their skull with their default headgear. In real life some rifle caliber projectiles can be deflected if the angle of impact is not favorable to penetration, but these are very specific situations and even if the helmets were capable of stopping full size rifle rounds hitting with the tip, the energy transmitted to your head would probably knock you out. Letting RNG decide if it would penetrate the helmet or bounce off it doesn't sound like a good idea at all.
---
Picking the weapon base damage as a parameter to define if it would be able to 1-HS-kill or not is also a bad approach. Although dealing only 32 damage compared to most ARs, Bandit's MP7 fires 4.6x30mm rounds, designed to defeat ballistic vests and helmets on Siege's range of engagement. Same to every 5.7x28mm high-ROF low-DMG weapon, like Five-Seven and P90. Making these guns capable of 1-HS-kill while firing that fast would be unfair to any other "non-AP/non-PDW" pistol-caliber weapon. But making them uncapable of it would be ridiculous as well. Changing these weapons ROF to balance them would further decharacterize Siege's weapons.
---
1 hit penetration headshots through multiple obstacles are only possible in Siege with very high damage weapons. Even some rifles ingame will DBNO a defender landing a headshot through multiple walls. [After searching for "HS Injure", you can find lots of threads complaining on these rare, but annoying situations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/search?q=headshot+injure&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).
---
Sorry, but in my opinion, adding these changes would make Siege's gunplay more gambling than how it is now, in which at least my slow 670 RPM intermediate caliber (5.56x45mm) L85A2 is able to reliably kill at close range a Smoke with a 1270-RPM blazing SMG-11 with a single hit to his dome.  [Not to mention my post on how removing 1-HS-Kill for any weapon but DMRs would turn it into BF4 AEK/F2000/FAMAS/G18 meta](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/antbog/well_here_we_go_againpengu_dose_not_like_another/efwdmrk/).

on a real note though I have not engaged anyone like this yet and I've been playing plat 3 half the season now. If you consider taking a break atleast sign up for Invitationals though, might be good to hang around for the reveals and their known issues and all that. From what I saw I can't blame you for being upset, these binds look absolutely ridiculous.
---
That fake streamer laugh though. I‚Äôm sure he found it funny but laughing out loud at a computer screen never sounds right. Think about it. Do you ever laugh out loud at memes even if they are incredibly funny?
---
If this change were to happen guns with slow ads times would have an almost impossible time killing her after they melee her shield. Clash is not supposed to be able to solo hold off a 3 man push thats just absurd almost like when they wanted Ela to be able to take on multiple people at the same time....

It's an issue because there's a very limited number of hard breaches available to a team and having a window be unbreachable can be dangerous. I'm specifically thinking of Oregon's dorm site. You could Guardian the windows of [Kids'](https://imgur.com/a/xkQ43O). That spot would:
---
1) Give extra security to the Mira player watching over A site. They'd no longer have to focus on anything other than the people attacking site directly.
---
2) Create a space that defenders would 100% never have to worry about being attacked from... that happens to watch over both sites
---
3) Be very difficult to remove the Mute jammers from, as EMPs wouldn't be able to remove them from the outside. Twitch drones would have to make it through the [narrow doorway](https://imgur.com/a/mDdIcm9) which has a bomb blocking line of sight to the mute jammer.
---
Or, you could spend that Guardian on the [big window](https://imgur.com/a/LO5hmOB) which has fewer problems but would slow the round down immensely. 
---
1) Thermite would have to spend [~40 seconds](https://youtu.be/_LHBC7563QM) to open the first window before moving onto the second, more risky standard location. And that's a perfect case scenario. (Sorry for the weird mic pop thing)
---
2) Hard breachers would be open to a relatively easy peek from Small Tower while they open that window, and if you lose that hard breacher or the Thatcher / Twitch you're kinda fucked.
---
3) The defenders can *see the hard breachers doing it, and would know they're vulnerable*. Anyone on site watching through the window could ping and tell their buddy in Small Tower when to aim at a predetermined spot (Assuming the attackers use Thermite)
---
That's the first site that came to mind as having important, easily defendable windows. But you could find other sites in the game just like this, I'm sure.

We get it, it's annoying now shut up and deal with it a fix is coming soon.

---
Remember though, on TTS she had no delay on the activation of her gadget. Which means if someone droned for you, you could run around quick peeking, lobbing one in the vicinity of someone, and just get handed a free kill, 3 times a round. If that was kept unchanged, I'd honestly say she would have been stronger than Lion. At least you can shoot back with a Lion.

Behold, the eternal glory of BB-800 the unkillable.
---
His point about helmets was not that the cosmetic helmets (or deflection spheres) *should* dictate headshot resistance, but that's how it would have to work if Siege was truly "realistic" like everyone claims in defense of OSHS'. It *would* be a crap-shoot to have truly realistic damage mechanics, so in short, using realism as a measurement of how good mechanics are is bullshit, and a waste of everyones' time. All games, even ones that claim realism, have to make concessions for gameplay and fun's sake, everything after that is just up to taste. People need to understand that before defending anything for realism's sake, especially in the context of talking about Siege, since it's generally speaking, unrealistic.
---
In that same vein, he's not arguing that weapons should be OSHS-capable or not based on their caliber for realism. Also, as you say, basing it off of their damage would require a lot of damage tweaking and re-balances, and we're never going to see a core mechanical change like that half for this reason and half for the fact that everyone would screech their lungs out at UBI to change it back if they did (even if it was arguably way more balanced). Looking at the game not as a perfect version of itself but as a diamond in the rough, like it has been since launch is something people are very polarized about. You either hate the game or you love it, no in-betweens, as far as everyone here is concerned.
---
All these criticisms can really be is fuel for anyone that wants to make a Siege-like, since I assume pouring more operators onto the pile (instead of tinkering with core mechanics) will likely be the devs' M.O. until the game dies or gets a sequel.
---
Is that a Macro? It must be a pc issue, since on console it would be near impossible to lean spam while moving and aiming
---
Hey, anything to help the Bretheren, and constantly remind them that there's a term called "balance" that people need to pay attention.

ICE defender: AR-10 full automatic primary assault rifle : 45 damage a shot or a Ithaca 37 with slug rounds: 110 damage a shot but has 5 rounds in a clip.
---
Secondary: Browning Hi Power: 65 damage a shot 10 rounds in a clip or a full automatic Beretta 93r with a vertical grip.
---
Ability: Any attacker that gets chosen gets deported and is no longer allowed to be used in that entire match.

Well, it didn't work out as intended

It‚Äôs the map. Theme park for some reason is overly bright since grim sky

nope boomerangs they stoe in there belly pouch

"id suggest checking (physical) TV settings" implies your TV setting will show up in your recording. Your wording isn't suggesting he should do that.
---
Where did you get that info? He's still one of the most used ops. Even in pro league matches, he's played at least 60% of the rounds.
---
i met some on ps4, didn't know they can use a macro to go this fast but this is just ridiculous

I have a question though. 
---
Why is this video only 1% of the RGB spectrum.
---
most things i do go that way
---
This was great. Well done!
---
Like that does anything lol
---
See that doesnt physically doesnt work. In the lore castle barricades are made from a kind of bulletproof plastic which is not electrically conductive. Which is why they can be rolled up and such. Sorry but it just doesnt make sense
---
Road to copper and no its not common.
---
This dude man....
---
So... remove the feature that makes the game more realistic, and that makes it more high stakes? Also, the feature that sets the game apart from most other non-milsim shooters on the market, a feature that the game has been based on since launch... sure, sounds smart.
---
The fuck. That‚Äôs a new concept of physics 
---
Who said that getting rid of the universal OSHS meant that high-damage guns would have to lose their lethal headshots? Needing 2 headshots with the Vector at range, but only one with Thermite's Sig or Fuze's AK at the same range would merely serve to reinforce better positioning and lessen the reward for using high RoF in every situation you can. Hell, who said that getting rid of universal OSHS' meant that you'd even have to change lethal headshots in most situations?
---
Also, lucky penetration headshots would be less rewarded, in turn increasing the importance of destruction and soft cover.
---

I hope they add  Ding Chaves from the older Rainbow Six games some day.

Find him a different game that features all of Siege's core mechanics but without OSHS and then you're allowed to say that without sounding like a chode.

they are basically ubisoft's spies for reddit. they develop ideas to piss of the community
---
Yeah, maybe someone should just make a new game that's almost like Siege, but re-examines the core mechanics that are flawed or disjointed and improve upon them.
---
But until then, criticizing Siege as it is is all he can do.

May tachanka have mercy on your soul

When you Lion starts his scan, your phone starts buzzing, Jackal starts tracking you, you see Finka pop her ability, and hear Blitz sprinting towards you.

Oh. That sucks.

Custom Games may also work.
---
Really, how will you learn a map if you don‚Äôt play on it?
---
I reported you 
---
The Canadians won't be proud of you
---
Ubisoft should just do what valve did for csgo and make the crouching really slow and laboured after the first 2 or 3 times a player crouchs 
---
Let us know!
---
I had a crouch spam moment last night, which was irritating on its own, but what pissed me off more was the instance where I got two chest shots onto a Sledge with Maestro's ALDA before he killed me. 
---
It wasn't the fact that I died that bothered me, I'm not great at the game so I can live with constantly dying; what irritated me was that the Sledge still had roughly 97 health left...
---
...and no, there was no Finka on the other team.  
---
Apex is dope!
---
Do Monti and Call it Montag(n)e

It doesn't need a recoil reduction, but more consistent recoil would be nice. At the moment it can go straight up one burst, zig-zag to the left the next, and zig-zag to the right the next. If horizontal recoil is going to come into play, it should be consistent - Hibana's Type 89 pulls off to the right consistently, I see no reason Ela's can't do the same.
---
Didn't spam crouch enough
---
Rhis is how you do legendaries ubi
---
DO **NOT.** ATTEMPT. TO BOARD. THE HELICOPTER!
---
I still never saw her as bad as Lion. Lion forces you to remain still, unless in a mute jammer. That was his only real counter. Nomad is a made flank watcher, and in tts, was crazy as the dart thing activated mid air. That did make her broken, but not as bad as a launch Lion. 3 charges, 5 seconds each, was nuts at the time. Ruined pro league for that whole seasons imo. Still ruins ranked to me.
---
I just feel the knockdown on her is what makes her so strong. Especially putting one above a doorway into site, there's no way to destroy it without triggering it. Like, ela mines you can still shoot, nomads traps, you're pretty much a free kill once knocked. Nobody should be a free kill in this game, unless they're dbno.
---
imo at least.
---
From border speaker
---
The loudspeakers on the map play a guy who screams this on repeat the entire match
---
Til the guy speaks in english
---
Why cant I just play ranked without that map in the playlist? You're saying people shouldn't play ranked because of a map that could easily be taken out of rotation?

- You play Ranked without that map
---
- It gets added later
---
- You still suck because you don‚Äôt know it
---
- You are at even greater disadvantage since your enemies played that map in Casual and know it
---
How would it help you in that situation?

No blackbeards scale skin is worse lol, i still use it though because ive never seen another person with it

It's the big 4 coned speaker on the outside corner of the building nearish tellers. Gotta shoot its twice I think.

---
&gt;Learning a map in an hour? Teach me your method lol.. Sure you‚Äôll know your way around, but learning a map on a competive level takes atleast a week of raw gameplay, strats take longer. 
---
How are you going to learn it at a competitive level if it isn't in competitive? Meaning, how are you going to learn it if it isn't in ranked? Don't tell me you want to learn it in casual. If you want the complete competitiveness of a map, you'll have to start at ranked straight.
---
&gt;I like it how they did it with Fortress, didnt add it to ranked for a while, had the playlist for that same period. (Not sure if it was intended but I didnt mind it)
---
No only on PlayStation it wasn't added. It was a bug. On PC, it was there directly.
---
&gt;That gives you the chance to learn the map since obj picks are still random so you are forced to be creative. 
---
And where are you going to learn that? Other than ranked?
---
&gt;I would prefer the ESL map pool only in ranked tho just like the road to SI playlist, a man can dream!
---
If you are going to add the ESL map pool, then yeah, I'm all in for that. Ranked should mimic PL 100%. If not, then the current system of adding them directly is the best.
---
Happens.
---
why didn't you just shoot him?? your own fault.
---
Feedback: You should not skip Math Class.. or School in general.
---
The lean speed isn't exactly the problem so it's unlikely that that's what they will adress.
---
More likely is that they will either add a short cooldown to leaning or an "exhaustion" mechanic where a cooldown is introduced after doing it two times in a row (or something like that).
---
I dabbled in photo editing, video editing and 3d animation, so I have a lot of macros mapped elsewhere
---
Gotcha that makes sense, always thought they were the individual rank like how the old system was.
---
Smoke main, smg-11 broke, understandable.
---
But why? His 556xi is one of the best guns in the game. So imo I don't really think there is much of a point in giving him one of the weaker guns of r6.
---
Replying because i want to know aswell 
---
I got one reinforcement left, and saw a place my teamates didnt reinforced so...
---
Even if they left it out of ranked for a month, you'd still be playing ranked, since you refuse to play casuals. They'd still release it after the month passes and you'll be once again complaining about how unfair it is that the enemy already knows the map from casuals, while you, a dedicated ranked player haven't even had a single match on it. Your complaint makes no sense, making it irrelevant. 
---
I play ranked as seriously as you do, boi, but you aren't going to learn the map competitively unless you PLAY IT COMPETITIVELY, which HAS  to be ranked, unless you want to go scrims first, which isn't going to work for those below gold, so it would be unfair to them.
---
The best place to learn a map competitively, IN-GAME, is ranked. So you'll have to develop your strats as your enemy team develops it, or you go into customs with squads and develop it. But you'll never find a better testing ground for it in-gane than ranked. So, yes, there's no other way than trying it in ranked asap.
---
I was talking about the triple kill koobe, weird flex but ok
---
I dont want to learn it in casual, but it is better than directly in ranked, but that is probably a rank difference. I prefer to scrim the map a few times but unless its added to the ESL map pool, GL finding teams to scrim ranked maps. 
---
It was the same story on Xbox, idk about PC tbh. 
---
Sadly, a casual playlist. 
---
I agree 100% with you here, ranked should be 100% ESL Pro League settings, including Map bans, Pick &amp; Ban and 6th Pick. 
---
I do this at the start of every attacking round on that map. I don't think I've ever seen anyone else do it.
---
I think that echo hacks 
---
Thats good to know, thanks man. I basically thought the longer the video the better. I can imagine how hard it is to produce consistent content that is long enough to make you a good living. You just have to look at Macie Jay who switched to mostly streaming because its clearly making him much more money. I do like your videos and I respect the effort and thought put into them. But like i said I have trouble watching several in a row and often find myself skipping through. But that may just be my personal experience. Hope that comes across as constructive rather than me shitting on your content. 
---
Nah, he was shot with a Glock. We all know it roughly deals the same damage in real life as it deals to armored CS players on range.
---
I mean the game it's self is good, it's just the terrible community. If you play with friends it's still good, assuming you have enough for a 5 man squad. 
---
Not against macros, but against the speed at which the in game character can crouch
---
I've never seen it anywhere before.
---
Do you still Need some? We Are 3 and searching For 2 more
---
You didn't get vote-kicked for clutching, this clip is fake and gay.
---
&gt;Pengu is asking it for the whole 1-HS-kill mechanic,
---
I don't really care what exactly he seems to be asking for; his question prompts a discussion around the topic, I don't have to 100% agree with him to want to indulge in conversation on said topic I've happened to have thought about since the game's launch. His bad proposal in particular shouldn't poison the well on any concept of a non-universal-OSHS damage model because that's bad for discussion, but most people don't give a shit about that so I don't know why I still expect that amount of civility.
---
&gt;High-ROF weapons are always better than slow-ROF weapons because of their TTK on bodyshots.
---
Couldn't you just adjust the damage to make the TTK comparable? That's a really basic problem to fix mathematically, and by no means a fundamental trait of high RoF guns.
---
&gt;Also, the point of soft cover is not to provide ballistic protection, but only to conceal your position when there aren't better options to take cover.
---
That's all fine and dandy; the effect of any damage model change(s) would completely turn this usage of soft walls on its head, and whether it would be for better or worse is completely up to personal preference. If the current 50% (last I checked) damage reduction makes headshots too un-rewarding if they ever tweaked that damage model, they could always tweak the wallbang damage reduction from there.
---
Personally I just don't enjoy having headshots be the "ignore soft-walls" condition, when there's a pretty steep damage reduction for wallbangs otherwise. I also don't think that most wallbang kills (including my own) tending to be from lucky headlines is a healthy thing. It'd be one thing if you needed to fire at a specific position through a wall for a moment to guarantee a kill, since it would reinforce doubling down on your guess and/or having good intel on their positioning (and still rarely give the recipient a chance to react), but just spraying into a room, and even having a moderate chance of landing a kill that way isn't really high-skill gameplay.
---
&gt;Being able to 1-hs-kill puts everyone on a fair spot.
---
Except for those with guns that are easier to get headshots with, or operators that move slower and in turn are easier targets to headshot. 
---
The fact that damage falloff is such a secondary consideration in the gunplay is just something I don't personally agree with. The fact that high armor is almost entirely a counter-balance and a burden instead of an interesting trade-off mostly due to the universal headshots though, is something that I've been vehemently against for a long time. I don't consider that an even playing field, and I consider the balancing acts they've had to do around the current, flawed system to be somewhat convoluted and unfun for anyone that prefers a slower playstyle.
---
&gt; According to a infograph released last year, Siege's range of engagement revolves around 9\~10 meters. Nerfing SMGs and pistols to not be able to 1-HS-kill at any distance up to this range would greatly put them in disadvantage.
---
This wouldn't have to be the case. Damage falloff should dictate engagement range (imo) so having lethal headshots in optimal range for SMGs and pistols would be fine, I don't think anyone would want otherwise.
---
Needing to consider that range limitation when taking potshots at a distance with those guns would just serve to balance the guns that are easier to use in general. Of course with the game not being balanced around this sort of shit, it would either take an incredible amount of math and general damage and falloff changes to have the intended effects, or it will never happen (which is more likely).
---
&gt; Pengu mentioned the fast-firing guns, especially Vector and SMG-11, but choosing the ROF of a gun as the parameter for 1-hs-kills or not is bad as well. 
---
No-one's proposing this, it's just a general rule of thumb that high fire-rate guns have lower damage to compensate, so the change would occur naturally. Not all would have to be stuck in this form of judgement; guns with higher RoFs could still have greater recoil and lethal headshot potential at most ranges to diversify weapon playstyle, Hibana's rifle comes to mind when I say this.
---
The ideal is to have a combination of all of that in the model, not to have one specific parameter arbitrarily affect lethal headshot potential. Damage falloff, general weapon damage, penetration values (if added) and armor values should all interact to determine if a headshot is lethal, just like other games generally do, just skewed towards lethal headshots instead of non-lethal headshots.
---
These year 5 ops are getting insane!
---
i have one but you can't make it so that it is this fast, this is probably a Turbocontroller
---
Imo it does not. The game is meant to be handled via communication through mic to give callouts etc. and not spam everything with pings. I know this sounds ignorant as hell, but Ubisoft is not responsible for your inabillity to communicate via basic callouts through mics.
---
That makes no sense whatsoever. Why cant we learn the basics on casual for a season and then play it in ranked once we have it down? There are some solid players in casual if you're a solid player due to skill based mm. The benefit of playing a new map on ranked are far outweighed by the negatives, such as losing games because your opponent gets lucky as neither of you know the map. You act as if there is no other option than ranked which is totally false.
---
Umm... OK. Yeah. I'm sure the entire rest of the map's murder holes will mourn the loss.
---
When are ya'll adding Vsauce Michael to the game?
---
When you knifed, you clipped through the window and she had the chance to knife you and kill u..
---
I‚Äôve tried too. Haven‚Äôt gotten it yet 
---
Yeah makes perfect sense especially if the game is not loading for him, and not by his fault. While annoying, and yeah he should have left a long ago, bottom line that it happens to my kid (playing from the same house, same wifi, both on SSD drives, and I load instantly, and he loads one or two minutes later). It happens to me all the time each time I got backfilled because someone got vote kicked or simply left the match... 
---
My post got removed the other day for being a meme? How come this is ok?
---
Do you even play this game????1?? Xd I‚Äôm so good I never make mistakes Xd le epic. 
---
Don‚Äôt be an a headass for a moment and think clearly: you are running into obj and someone hits you in the head because they saw a cam on the other side of the map and didn‚Äôt realize he was moving into you as he shot. It‚Äôs not his fault then because he was doing the necessary and you should have moved away from the guy with tunnel vision behind you which you could have not seen otherwise. Imagine being this defensive because you can‚Äôt take 1 second to make sure you‚Äôre not shooting anybody. 
---
Not gonna lie. It‚Äôs late and I thought you spelled Daves instead of devs...
---
We mallus are a people of culture I see

I have this, i tried to make some thing like toggle-tbag but every Time i Press is it cancels when i want to pew pew the funny thing is even if i could crouch spam i not gonna do that you know why? Bcuz i have skill (said blitz Main) i play from the begining of the gamƒô at ps4 and i started dropshoting when they removed it with ta Hanka SMG to meme on those noobs.(i Main him on Def.) i even have a fucking m&amp;k adapter i mu closet but i not gonna use it bcuz i not a pussy that cant win with controller on ps4 So he uses m&amp;k same thing with trigger finger only hip fire (i use it for fuze with shield) But na on has a shitty cable that can be easy destroyed. Dear People who use m&amp;k on console please commit die and learn how 2 play this game GG ez

I've seen it but i can't remember where. but i am 100% sure that that it was already made in other concepts this year and the previous year.

Macro or not, he still hit you first. So likely even without it he would've killed you.

The algorithm of a Platinum player in casual is the following:
---
- Play a round die regardless of how many kills you have: Leave
---
-Doesn‚Äôt die and gets loads of kills: ‚ÄúEZ NOOBS!‚Äù Which for the record really pisses me off and demotivates me.
---
-Dies and insults everyone‚Äôs gameplay and blames the enemy for being stupid for their death
---
-Doesnt play casual

Tachanka is getting clash's shield but with the lmg mounted into it instead of zappy Bois. He's also so heavy the airjabs don't work on him and he's wearing a fire retardant suit so capitao can't burn him.

Lmao why not add hude ammo pools and health regen and turn it into a generic fps
---
Ur actually a retard if u think thats not hitbox abuse, u have to prefire him if u want to kill him because thats how fast the leaning is, u obviously havent been on the recziving end of this

since its a official ubisoft application I'd say pretty accurate

Sure

---
YES 4 Weeks because i only could work on it Thursdays for 2 Hours
---
Nah not really. 
---
Now in almost all games toxic community. There is always an idiot who will spoil all the sensations of the game. So, if you leave R6 to some other competitive game, nothing will change. The only games where there is no toxicity are single games
---
I haven't play her, but that sounds fucking fun, the luison at long range was like throwing sticks to the enemy 
---
Nope. I drawed it free. Thats why it looks a bit "Unprofessional" 
---
I don't get the point of waiting. There's no financial benefit to buying 50 Alpha Packs instead of 1, and it just means you have less time with whatever you unlock. What if the first pack was a black ice but you waited 6 months? 
---
today probably or tommarow
---
Lol I know right, shit was great back in the day, I remember do slayer in halo reach and the same thing happenin lol
---
No, it just depends where the enemy killed, was positioned and it also depends on what‚Äôs around the person that was killed.
---
I needed like 47gb of free space, but it's only 2gb
---
sounds like a casual.   but if any changes chanka should be able to do dmg to shieldies. like montagne takes 1hp a hit from his turret bullet while others take 2.
---
any update on fps drop ? 
---
Still has an acog
---
You do realise that's the main reason anyone picks them?
---
&gt;low recoil
---
&gt;basically all acog guns
---
you sure m8?
---
I agree, I find casual either insanely hard or insanely easy, because of the awful matchmaking. Just put casual elo in, and make it so that it doesnt show. You get placed plat in casual, and you play against people of the same rank 
---
At 30dmg, it's a 4 shot
---
At 27dmg, it's a 4 shot
---
What is the big problem here? Did Lesion's nerf to 28dmg from 30dmg do anything or change anything? No.
---
Bruh just get good, you have to synchronize the crouch to his 
---
&gt;step on gu mine = 90hp
---
&gt;90hp = 3 shot kill
---
Pffff what's a hitbox
---
If you didn't know that then you haven't even reached 60% of her potential
---
Stop whining you‚Äôre acting like they increased the recoil and reduced the damage, and they‚Äôre both viable ops so your point is irrelevant lol.
---
Exactly. That‚Äôs why the change is fine.
---
If you can easily get headshots, then what‚Äôs the issue. It could do 2 damage but still kill in 1 shot if you can dome them. 
---
Plus, people play Doc and Rook as pure fraggers. Easy gadgets that assist with getting kills, especially Doc. This is now harder and instead you can focus on healing and supporting the team.
---
Funny thing the other dude posted the same thing but in his perspective
---
&gt;at 30 damage it's 4 shot kill
---
&gt;at 27 damage it's 4 shot down
---
So youre saying that glaz dmr doing 80 damage is pointless because a 50 damage gun is 2 shot?

I guess you're going to ignore the first part of my comment as it completely dismisses the point of your temper tantrum, correct?

Yeah when casual starts to get like that then I go to ranked gust to play a more casual game than casual can give me. 
---
Is that why they see almost 0 pick is proleague

Not with the full body shield 
---
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt say jagar has the best one is dumb

But thats not the fault of Dias having fun in casual, its the fault of a fu...ing bad matchmaking system...

Dont blame the players to just play whatever mode they want. Blame the developers to dont care about fair matchmaking!

Wow (insert operator here) gun has no recoil because I move my mouse to counteract the recoil pattern. PlEaSe NeRf!!!
---
Yup, sometimes it really do be like that. I still remember as a lv 30 something, I played against a 5 stack of diamonds all lv 400+ and I raged, I dont think any of them even took damage the entire time. That's the story of how I stopped playing for a week
---
Because they bring no useful utility. 
---
So you dont think they will release a hot fix today?! that would so stupid
---
I‚Äôve been buying pro league skins for two years?
---
Woah.
---
So nerf them?
---
Doc gets picked all the time...
---
The most dangerous threat is your teammates after all!
---
You could play proxi-bp ops on defense in a way to be in fights early in the round and to have the possibility to go back on bp if you are under too much pressure. 
---
And on attack you could play versatile ops like Zofia and according to your feelings you will know how you prefer to play her 
---
Don‚Äôt tell I don‚Äôt know map knowledge, listen here bud I know the maps matter and there‚Äôs some shit ones in the pool right now, but they‚Äôd have to add fortress at some point and someone will have a disadvantage. And if it was out for a while before anyone who plays ranked exclusively would be at a huge disadvantage.

They added a bit of recoil to her pistol to the new update to make chaining shots at a longer distance harder.
---
Very cool  and very legal!!! Thanks ubi 
---
Yeah but not on console.
---
Hence why the last sentence of my last post is there
---
If I had to guess I would say that most of those top ranked players run with the same team and maybe their role on the team isnt fragging. 
---
Check where it says Edit: !
---
You do make a good point, but in that case I sat bring back his 3rd. As he is rn he can electrocuteonly as much, sometimes less than bandit. The idea of a disable isn't bad, but I feel like there can be more approaches.
---
What? The update goes to both platforms.
---
no. 
---
I think it was intentional 
---
This kind of bullshit is why I don't use shield operators very often.
---
The P90‚Äôs better anyway. 
---
I mean i dont do those really toxic peeks but this one is just like watching an entrance, thanks for the asshole, really apreciate it :)

---
Through god all things are possible, so jot that down.
---
Or they're getting the best possible ranked experience and can learn the map in a different mode? Who exclusively plays ranked? They could literally play in customs if they hate casual, and thunt if they hate playing alone. By the way, keep talking down to people, it really makes you seem mature. "Listen here bud", ha.
---
You ever have those moments when you realize- *shit, I'm too old for this*? Well shit, I'm too old for this.

*Oh sorry my Iphones, Nintendo switch and my stack of money was in the way*
---
I dont like it the slightest. I dont do it either.
---
But it's a game mechanics that's make you win more games. Cant really bl√¢mes the players for doing it. Yes it's toxic. Sad and ruins the game.
---
But it's ubisoft fault for lettimg it comes to this
---
I agree. Kapkan and frost are balanced at delaying by making an attacker have to focus on more things. Lesion just gets free 10+ seconds of delay.
---
Thatcher because I absolutely love the SAS and Operation Nimrod was such a badass event.  
---
Also the animation is pretty cool :)
---
True that :)
---
The only change I don't like is the mag cap reduction.
---
I always run Cav with the shotgun, cause I never use my primary anyway and a shotgun brings more utility in prep phase.
---
The other changes are fine, but taking away bullets from the Luison is just bullying people that don't want to run the SMG.
---
I mean, with the new recoil and damage curve, how op can having a "normal" sized mag be?
---
Under half...
---
If you want, i can send you screenshots on discord. I wanna see if the recoil is different on consule.
---
Ill DM you my discord
---
Yeah but even though the update went through cav has no recoil on her pistol.
---
If he shot is lmg into the air instead of that pistol it would be 10 times better
---
I don't see the kill.

This is plat 2. No doubt it would be harder with a controller but it looks like their reaction time is low. No idea why as I‚Äôve never played console. 
---
Totally agree. It's just a thought that I had in mind that requires some more thinking. 
---
oof
---
Maybe because kills aren‚Äôt everything in this game shocker right
---
Do you play on pc or console
---
I hate spawnpeeks too, but you cant really call this a spawnpeek, as an attacker you can easily aim at that window before the defender can see you, the problem about this working is, the people think they are save when the door is closed but they dont think about other windows
---
look at king George's profile, that's what a real every season diamond looks like
---
A few things to note:
---
* I understand how you feel, the game clicked on me after almost a year after buying it, and I dropped it for entire seasons before getting the hang of it. You did point this out but it is something you really should consider: **It really is just a game**, if you really dont have fun with it at your play level you could drop it for a while (or forever) and that would be perfectly fine, or try to improve yourself, watch youtuber videos, check out Pro League, it does open your head a ton. And another thing, your rank is just a matchmaking tag, you are placed with people similar to you, and if your teammates are so good themselves they will have no problem climbing up after playing with you, its understandable to not wanting to "ruin" other people's game but at the end of the day you paid for this game and you deserve to play it just as much as they do, besides, in this horrid community you will get called out for absolutely everything, eventually you grow numb to those arses.
---
* If fragging on defense is not your thing, you can try becoming a full support player: Lesion is good but you need to stay alive for almost the entire round to get the most out of him, Valkyrie on the other hand can be just as powerful (intel-wise) but as long as you threw your cams early your job is done (ideally you want to stay alive for that C4 tho). Pick up Maestro and check some useful spots for his cameras, at this point its your teammates job to keep them operational. Use Clash to ping enemy locations, slow and damage them as much as possible before you inevitably kick the bucket (thats basically her job). You can use Echo's drones to assists roamers and the site at the same time. Learn to Bandit-trick and protect the site's main wall, or stay on-site with Doc to actually heal your teammates.
---
* Not sure about your attacking rounds, but in a similar vein you can use other support characters, like Jackal, Montagne or any of the Hardbreachers, help your teammates to get kills or intel.
---
Ash has no hitbox
---
Think you end up *just* missing
---
Yup. 
---
Kaid‚Äôs gadget is a one and done gadget that you place down and forget. Bandit is the same but has the option to be active with the gadget. 
---
Bandit would still be hella viable if Kaid got 3. Kaid is slower, has worse weapons and doesn‚Äôt have a Nitro cell. 
---
All the 3 speed lovers would always play bandit still, as his gadget is still plenty good enough on its own. 
---
This is why I‚Äôd be perfectly ok having Kaid with 3. 
---
Yeah Blitz is weird for both defenders and attackers. Really irregular. Monti has been really weird for me since the last small update. Been getting shot and stabbed right trough my shield many times
---
I know I said that in the post, I‚Äôm asking what do they do specifically that insures a lot of wins 
---
That was at least three hits 
---
Yo they nerfing cav again or what?
---
^jkgoodace
---
I personally think that Maverick should be able to breach it (being a hard-breacher) but it takes him half of his ammunition of his torch to break it. this would allow 3 people of the @20 attack characters to breach the window. Because just Hibana and Thermite is way to unbalanced even if Hibana can reach it from afar. (Castle has at least 5 counters i.e. Buck, Ash, Sledge, Breach Charges, etc.) Even if you can frost it by shooting it there is still the problem of it being a hard breach that only two can breach through. (I am a Maverick main so my opinion is a little biased.) but Guardian is a little too unbalanced as of right now in my eyes.
---
Forgot that, thanks
---
game isn‚Äôt horrible. i‚Äôm just unlucky enough to find bad players only. i love this game and everything about it right now. besides crouch spanning ofc 
---
at first i thought it will be no scope
---
Its annoying as hell, I feel like blackbeard when I play blitz, just minus the rifle 
---
Kapkan used to have 3 EDD's that insta-killed but had very visible lasers. He was also 3 armor/1 speed with access to barbed wire. Now he has 5 EDD's that have scaled damage and is 2 armor/2 speed with impacts instead of barbed wire. He is very versatile and less anchor-oriented now.
---
Mute Now has the SMG-11. I shouldn't have to explain that one.
---
Blitz is 2 armor/2 speed and can Sprint with his shield up. Blitz was exceptionally weak at the beginning of Siege but now he is arguably one of the better shield operators (with varying levels of infamy.)
---
Tachanka has a ballistic shield to protect his face.
---
Echo now has two yokai drones that were reworked to remove disorientation spam but provide Intel for the entire time.
---
Glaz has a thermal scope and went from being very underpicked to a very strong bomb-mode operator.
---

Glaz seriously has the worst hitreg ever.  Pause at 5 seconds and you can see the bullet go straight through OP.  
---
Both. You hit her 2 times and missed all the other shots, but still hit those 2. 
---
When is this wallpaper getting nerfed/reworked REEEE. Great work dude!
---
I mean use both. Depending on the map, you‚Äôll want something for longer range shots and something for close boom boom. The M12 is fun to use with a silencer! One thing I always make sure of is keeping either nades or the spas-15 in my loadout so I can get through hatches/soft walls. 
---
Never apologize for the bag
---
I'm unconvinced bro
---
Because they're stupid children
---
Not alone completely agree. I had a 17 kill game yesterday where I had to do absolutely everything, from planting to fragging. The closest person on the scoreboard on my team had 5 kills, nobody was droning, no call outs other than myself, no map knowledge. Solo queuing out of silver is impossible and I mainly blame my teammates who dont know strats. Either stay in casual or watch some videos and actually propel yourself towards gitting gud. 
---
An attacking pulse, huh?
---
Me likey
---
I meant when bb and ela were OP, the standard response was 'just outflank' or just 2v1 them. Spraying at the legs does work, but playing with pea shooters on defence does little, and the moment I shoot at legs, they ads for a split second and I'm dead. And playing trap meta just to counter one operator is boring. If blitz were 1 speed + penalty that's all I could ask for. Because he couldn't outpace 1 speeds on defence back then. And the Lion Finka cancer meta made Blitz even stronger.
---
Yeah! Ill make smoke next. I want to learn the "smoke effects" 
---
Thanks man. It‚Äôs true they were kind of awful.
---
Lmao fair enough 
---
I never hip fire not even with shotguns aiming for me is muscle memory 
---
The recoil right now is a straight line up. Start low if you‚Äôre having trouble controlling the recoil or try pulling down slowly while ADS and shooting.
---
And so it begins 
---
I personally agree except I‚Äôd swap mute out for J√§ger
---
I can't hipefire anymore this was a long time ago lol 
---
Support players. They probably use shields like Montagne in particular on the attacking side and for defense mostly Echo. Ik Maestro is similar to Echo but he has a lot more fragging capability.
---
Why? You know what's gonna be on it. Does it really matter what country the operators are from? 
---
You know if there is a drone nearby bc of your points. 
---
I genuinely dislike using shields anyway because it takes away any stealth I may have had and having underpowered weapons at range isn't great either
---
Thanks Kanye, very cool.

---
I was starting to think they weren't going to be doing teaser at all this time.
---
Depends on your play style. If you play medium to fast pace go for the 3 speeds. If you like to play slow buy harder hitting operators. In my experience iq is very good for lower level play because the trap operator count is pretty high. Blackbeard personally isn‚Äôt very good. He is slow with the shield on and if you get into a gunfight it‚Äôs very hard to see if the bullets hit your shield. Buy the ones you feel most comfortable using.
---
It could be that they were previously lower skill level and have improved during their time in the game. Its very hard to improve your k/d when you have 1000+ hours in ranked.
---
The road map doesn't only tell you what country the ops are from lmao.
---
It's also that you have subhuman reactions and hold a fucked angle like that smh
---
A tip for next time when you tea bag go over the enemy when you have the chance and look at him and look up and down when tea bagging also shoot at randomly while teabag especially at the end

Going on their pattern, Buck is very likely to get one soon. The current likeliest (in no particular order) are Bandit, Tachanka, Buck, Smoke, Castle, Montagne. Though I wouldnt be surprised if they hit us with a Mira or Hibana elite either.

Why should Kaid get more utility than bandit? He can already protect hatches and get multiple things with one claw. If it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a dlc op then you‚Äôre out of your mind. DLC ops should be new and interesting, but shouldn‚Äôt be better or have more going for them. That makes games pay to win. Every op needs to be viable.

Compared to the current system? It would feel like it. You'd need to do a lot more math than just make a 2x HS multiplier to make sure guns stay on a relatively even playing field, and that you don't completely disrupt the flow that makes Siege's gunplay fun and rewarding.

Pretty sure that it the duble shot from titan fall 2 but still think that would look awesome on maverick or nomad/kaid

You can see their mic icon when they do speak, just can't hear 'em

‚Äúneed to rely on gun skill and aim‚Äù
---
so you‚Äôre aim isn‚Äôt any good? you can‚Äôt hit a shield users hand? shoulders? legs? 
---
The standard game itself was 60GB when I got it, so you ain't that far off. If the test server is a difference based download, I think it's the right amount.
---
The majority of the space goes to the excellent map textures works of different quality settings.
---
Edit: When i said bring it back, i should have said rework it. its been so long since i played it, the fond memories i have of it where when i was a new-ish player playing against a playerbase of people that didnt take full advantage of the map. it definatley would need changes to accommodate the new operators and more experienced community.
---
that is a wacky system lol
---
Civ 6, turned base chill game.
---
I think frost is still amazing to play as.  As far as her frost mats, while I would love them to be unshootable, that's a bit OP.  To play as frost effectively in higher rank games, you just have to be more creative with where you put the traps.
---
Thank you, the devs sometimes use these concepts as inspiration. I think Mira, Jackal and Finka were based on fan concepts. It's really fun.

Pfft who cares I‚Äôll take nerfs like that everyday.  Hey you wanna nerf my interrogate to only be limited to 3 per round but make it instant?

Ironic

Game is very CPU hungry, most likely will 100% it all the time while gaming. Dont put all low settings, try to mix it up and go mid/high to put more stress onto gpu instead of cpu.
---
Way beyond too op.
---
Naga isn't even bad. wtf
---
the 360 at the end made me think it was but watching it again its slower than with a mouse 
---
Is it against TOS? Yes, automating gameplay like this with an auto clicker is definitely against TOS.
---
Will they ban you? Probably not as other people will tell you, the BattlEye plugins to detect clickers are not active on Siege
---
Theres a bug in ps4 tho sometimes you cant even hear chat when your mic icon is like blacked out.
---
The more you play the less you will win or lose
---
Just checked and can confirm the correct desk is inserted

This is obviously a ping issue. There's massive ghosting

Ok, thanks

Ok. I heard from a friend that Battleye doesn't care about offline games. Idk whether to trust him or not
---
Gold 2 is above average so good job on that!
---
Nice work! May I suggest you use the eraser tool to smooth the smoke around lion with brick wall
---
Well usually we wait for a thatch to go down to throw the Kaid when it comes to Therm, since Therm always puts his charge down right after in our experience 
---
Yeah. I saw your end was fine. This happens a lot to me when I play on EU servers with some of my EU friends and it annoys me so much
---
Well, it actually was a good argument since you don‚Äôt have a response ‚Äúbuddy boy.‚Äù I also rarely use shields, I just think it‚Äôs funny when people like you cry and complain about a video game, retard.  
---
Thought you were talking about yourself the whole clip.

3 stooges music has never been so relevant 
---
There should be a mechanism that the match gets cancelled if the loading screen is held for more than 5 minutes.
---
I can still buy it though :P
---
Maybe a little bit, but it was more of the slow lean walk that was used most. I mean it least on xobox at the time you knew everyone had a controller. Plus I felt like the community regulated itself pretty well at the time. Not even close to being as toxic as it is now. 
---
He is extremely strong atm in my opinion. 
---
Plus they removed smokes from operators like Ying, because it worked too well with her gadget and she became a one man team. This would be the same as Glaz. A teammate would have to smoke for you to utilise this. 
---
It‚Äôs too strong that he can place a smoke where he wants when he wants to use his gadget, as you can‚Äôt counter him through the smoke.
---

Yup. Was watching an ad for one(NV, rather than thermal) a while back, that basically turned the scene you were observing into daylight colours at normal detail/resolution. I think the price they were asking for such was about $30k USD.

One shots headshots make this game extremely casual?
---
Anyone can pick Doc with an MP5 acog and spray at heads and luck into a kill. Siege is a good game but it's gunplay is terrible. If aiming was actually important in siege it wouldn't have taken 3 years for them to fix your reticle not pointing where your bullets went.
---
If it's any consolation, your video was way funnier than theirs
---
i already have the charm, but can hop in for couple rounds if you need 1 more player to complete it
---
Whether this was you or not it still came across as you promoting this kind of activity. Long time players of this game have had their fair share of getting team killed, and it's why the community reacts so negatively. It's why people think Siege community is so salty and people struggle starting up this awesome game, people like the ones in the picture are the reason Siege isn't the best game. 
---
I do think it should be brought back, however I feel it needs an overhaul.

More ways in, less spawn peakish windows.  Better objective sights.

You can‚Äôt buy the year 1 pass anymore bud.
---
I want blitz to be nerfed as much as anyone, but that‚Äôs why I said that‚Äôs he‚Äôs subject to a shield rework, whereby it would inevitably be a big nerf to blitz. 
---
P.s. Vigil change is more of a buff in my honest opinion
---
what the crouch spamming fail?
---
We don't have those here.
---
I'm talking about the Hood *Ceifador*
---
I feel your pain. I almost always run into high pinged players on West Coast NA and there were a few on their team but I think this guy was local. Still could've been a connection problem on his end at that given moment I guess. We all have those "how was that not a headshot" moments but this 1 grinds my gears lmao.
---
Says the clash main. You literally need a fucking shield blocking your entire body so you dont die. In a game with a 1HK, you need to rely on gun skill and aim but you cant do that if someone has a metal barricade blocking their entire body. Having ANY type of shield gives u an advantage of some sort. This means that you can crutch and win ALMOST every gun fight. This is why a lot of diamond players have problems with shields.
---
So it begins...the suffering...

The wind is always moving. If you do not budge and let it carry you you will quickly be left behind.

Probably just the usual 8 ops a week early, the alpha booster, and maybe some season pass cosmetics like they always do.
---
Yeah it's been said, or just find a way to limit the speed you can do it at making macros worthless.

Buck already has the flannel suit (either with flannel beanie or hockey mask), which is better than 80% of the current elites anyway

---
This probably won‚Äôt work on console without the auto clicker right ?
---
She does, but so does Frost
---
Yeah this isn‚Äôt a bad idea, the only difference is crouching in csgo is instant, especially before the spam update you would get headglitched into oblivion from behind a box, in siege people don‚Äôt spam for that kind of thing they just do it because they think it makes them harder to hit, Ive personally never had a problem destroying a spammer but I can see why it needs to be nerfed
---
That doesn't allow for this behavior, and especially in casual there are times you are waiting for people to get on for ranked, and you want to talk to your friends. The frustrations you feel are valid, but you don't get to kill people for it.
---
Nope, pc only
---
Get all the bells and whistles you can. Grinding 25k renown for each dlc operator is not worth it.

I got dropped into a match of three kids that were trying to 360.(And failing) So I'm glad this worked out because I know I wouldn't of herd the end of it if I would of failed it.

Needs more upvotes

I'm sorry what gun shoots bullets that small in the game, from what I know the smallest round fired is 9mm, the average attacker round is probably 5.56 and 7.62. So yes, .22lr and smaller probably won't go through the helmets used, but doesn't matter because no round is that small. Imo the best solution would be a lower multiple where ars would still 1 shot, but high fire rate smgs would take 2.
---
Nope. They "are looking into the issue". Means will be fixed when Ranked leaves Beta. :(

If you use your ability during prep phase instead of  using your reinforcements then you‚Äôre a fucking idiot.

If we are getting Favela back we should also get Bartlett back in the rotation too!

Shields are the toughest operators to balance because they work in a fundamentally different way than everyone else. It's why a lot of people would happily see them removed from the game. The most balanced shield OP is Fuze because his gadget and shield are separate. But they can't really do that with the others. 
---
Someone on the other team is holding the lobby. I don't know if they're playing with lag or something but it happens when butt hurt children get smacked and decide they'll just get an easy win by making everyone leave. I've had it happen several times.

B: You're low rank and think he is OP. C: Both. If you don't have any more arguments and you can just stop arguing or admit you're wrong, you don't have to make yourself look stupid by insulting a character you don't like.

From what I could gather from the reddit community , squad mates can‚Äôt join a game together only solo , I‚Äôve noticed a few kill cam glitches from me playing . Some people can‚Äôt download the update its kind of a mess
---

---
hmm interesting its pretty balanced and it fits the fbi theme i say ubi should try

I'll think about transferring it into Google Speedsheet. :) Right now the MediaFire link contains JPG file and Excel file, :)

A and B are wrong but doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt still annoying and isnt op since ubi arent gods, second it is proven there is de-sync for shields so sometimes it genuinely is hard to kill him

RIP
---
I'm not... If somone is in a window doing that it is impossible to hit them, and in a hallway you have to hit their feet, this giving them the kill - does it look like I'm getting any Karma arguing for no reason with you - I have 9.7k I don't need anymore, nor do I try to get massive amounts, I just had a post or two that blew up. 
---
And I never said you couldn't get killed - headshots are unlikely and if you're juts standing there doing that it's going to be easier for you to spot and kill somone coming for you if you're in a hallway as they have to hit your feet - macros are the most common use of this, it's not like they're only able to do it then have to stop to shoot, they have full mobility. 
---
The first operator that can jump!
---
 As always: Your background would be interesting.   Hours played, competitive experience, SoloQ or squad mostly, Casual or Ranked. Secure Area/Bomb. Thank you.

yes

It was still nerfed. Its nerf or nothing bro
---
That could be fun but I almost want their dialogue quips to just be so heavily accented they sound like gibberish. 
---
Lesion rework confirmed
---
Whats that skin?
---
Do a massiv alpha pack opaning and live stream it
---
Frost and Rook are also why you have Advanced Gadget Deployment on.  Lesion was just deaf.  
---
Jager on the other hand must have gotten into Bandit's stash.
---
Why didn't you show your equipment???
---
So that Australia lobby screen was real
---
I ignored them the first round but didn't work out. usually i don't use comms if not needed as i play mostly in causal, but sometimes ignoring just won't work.
---
This and the fact they can just shoot through the shield sometimes, and it just doesnt face the right way.
---
Is this common duplicates?

YEEEEEEAH STRAYA MATE
---
Ok this is epic.
---
your main aim, doesnt really want to be operators and gun, while some are easier, to use, or have better or more managable recoil, these things are all muscle memory and learn over time, what your thinking is good tho, you want a operator where you team dosent rely on you been alive to make use of it, so you want ops like   
---
Def; Rook, kapkan, frost, mute, bandit, jager these all have gaget you just place, and they do there job, out of these, id highly reccommed Rook, jager, and kapkan, Rook and Jager have amazing team gagets, Rook can get a Acog which is very powerful on defence, Jager have one of the best defenders guns, but not acog, kapkan, isnt amazing in any means, but his smg, has low recoil, and his traps can net you a few free kills    
---
Atk; Sledge, Ash/Zofia , Blackbeared, Lion, Jackel, attakcs a little more complex as alot of the gadgets, are more impactful when used, sledge is amazing to learn on free destruction for moving around, and a good all round AR with the L85A2, Ash and Zofia, i listed together because they are pretty simlar, you wont be missed too much if you miss used the gadget properly or die, but are good simple picks, Blackbeard has a shield on his gun as his gadget, and this makes it harder to get 1taped to the head, and gives you a free gun fight basically if you aims is okay, his gun has a small mag, and fair big of recoil, but is a headshot machine, Lions gadget, scans the entire map, showing you any enemies who are moving, this is pretty simple why hes good for learning, dont use it right at ther start of a round its a waste, and his smg, is half decent to say the least, and jackel, has a gadget that can track enemies if he finds there footsteps, and his AR is amazingly good, and his smg is pretty good too, also has a shotgun secondary, so can open soft hatches.   
---
but as i said about you main aim doesnt want to be learning ops or wepaon, you want to be learning the maps, and objectives on each map, as your main aim, map knowledge is probally the most important thing to know in the game, nexto been able to headshot, the ops listed above, all make learning maps and objective on both sides easier, as you dont have to worry about staying alive, or using your gadget well.   
---
like you mentioned thacher, you take thacher to take out enemy gadgets, exspecially bandit battiers, so a hard breacher, can breach a reinforced wall, so now if you pick thacher and die right at the start of the round, your team can no longer hard breach, and have a much hardr job attacking the obj, so always pick a op your team wont miss if you die.   
---
some ops become more powerful as the rounds go on, like lesion on defence, he has little gu mines you can throw out, that recharge over time, so the longer your alive the more of these mines your can place around the obj, to slow eniems down, so you have to stay alive to make the most of him.   
---
but heres my biggest tip of all, just please have fun, and enjoy your self, playing this wonderful game if your on pc, feel free to message me your seige name, and we can play sometime, im pretty new to seige too

Steve Irwin confirmed for Siege?
---
Yeah, but how often down the revive thing work for you?
---
I can tell you that in my experience most fights end in deaths and when there is the event of a down they are quickly picked off or in a welcome mat (cannot be adrenal surged).  
---
As for recoil after time you get used to all the guns to the point that finka, while still providing a benefit, isn‚Äôt necessary and can even throw people off sometimes.  
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt know it made adsing faster and I‚Äôll admit that‚Äôs a good thing that can‚Äôt be practiced.  
---
I‚Äôll even give her bonus points for having frags because they are great utility. 
---
However, in most situations, you would be better off with a buck or a sledge for the frags as they provide a more versatile ability that would provide the team with more options, like new angles of approach for example. 
---
I just got that book a couple days ago, I need to find time to read it

I once saw it happen on KingGeorge's stream last season. Some kid was hacking and the KG's team started winning and the hackers team started team killing the hacker. Well, the hacker kept disconnecting and reconnecting when he died and then 3 or 4 rounds in he ended up joining back when they were picking operators and the hacker just started indefinitely loading.
---
KG waited about 10 min, then finally left to play some casual and queue for custom games. About 30 minutes later, KG finally got the leaving penality for Ranked. This asshole hacker broke the lobby for 40 minutes.
---
There needs to be a 5 minute timer on loading in ranked. If you take longer than that, it boots you automatically. Maybe even a suspension if it happens multiple times a match, but that's getting iffy.
---
You can boot in casual, so it can stay as is there. (Also, you can leave casual with no penalty)
---
i agree it was very hard to get into the building on attack but i think its a perfect candidate for a rework. more so than kanal. the theme and setting just allows for lots of interesting ideas for room layouts and map design that i think ubi needs to look into redesigning it
---
Just shoot their harness. Then they'll fall into the sun
---
It is only active on the weekends.
---
I used to play on console and I never played against people this oblivious 
---
I have the choice to either play casual, and TRY to relax a bit after a day of hard work, or play ranked in soloQ, where i would be met with insults and a shitshow of curses because i "didn't play as they think i should play".
---
I really like the gameplay of this game, hell i put 926 hrs in this game, i just don't like the competitive side with crouch-spamming, meta-abusing, rage-inducing mess that is ranked.
---
I just want to sit back, play 5-10 games in a night without getting tk or having 2-3 players leaving first round because they died or worse kick me because i didn't die rushing in with them and they don't want to wait for me to play
---
Lmao thats fucked üòÇ
---
Honestly finka really fucks me over as cav. I'll down someone and check out around the corner to make sure they're alone, come back and just get fucking blasted
---
Wow we have our first BIG GAY person :D
---
because thƒ±s new update fuckd up. same problem. normaly +144 fps but now 80
---
I don't think we are able to know that yet
---
I think it‚Äôs cause you said ‚Äúneg-‚Äú and anything containing that‚Äôs an auto ban. Funny though cause you can say nagger without being banned? Better ways to fix the toxicity issue in chat smh.
---
RIP bother u ll be missed
---
Nah, he‚Äôs PC. You can tell by the action prompts. 
---
I think it's a glitch because I have a good desktop that loads first every time, but rarely it will infinitely load for no reason, sometimes right in the middle of a match when selecting operators. I would like to get an answer for why this happens.
---
The sequel

If Twitch zaps them and they don‚Äôt scream ‚Äúooh ya bastard‚Äù what‚Äôs the point

Heres a pass to the front page.

Yeah you get those coins from achievements
---
This must have taken ages to put together. Good job B) 
---
I feel like the range on that is insane, I will activate it on one corner of the map and make a thousand points ez. I wouldn't even attempt to use it to find drones
---
I don't feel like that is true. Because words like negative exist that are definitely not offensive and are a part of the in game dialogue. Do you have a source for words having "neg" being an auto ban?
---
It's getting rather annoying not hearing anything from them about this. My game has been **unplayable** for the last 2 days. Everytime I drone, it crashes.
---
Put me in the screenshot but it's jammed by mutes jammer
---

Didn't you post this from your view? Could have sworn I saw it from your view
---
Yes, but still it does not let me play and gets frozen when the game just loads
---
lego man sucks if you run down the clock.
---
But at least you‚Äôve played the round out and haven‚Äôt spent the last 2 minutes replaying how blitz smashed you 15 seconds after prep.
---
I remember reading about one of the devs saying that really early on, Blitz‚Äôs ability was that he spawned during the prep phase but they quickly scrapped it because this right here probably happened too much.
---
I wonder if other racial slurs concealed in other words is banned
---
Hey, i met "THE REAL ASIANO" yesterday. He was ok (as an enemy, didn't talk.
---
Because you were blinded and it doesn‚Äôt show on death replays
---
It's quite common practice in every esports subreddit and sports to have a rule against it.

I'm fairly certain it's the same speed.

Annoying 
---
if you write it enough
---
No, only if it doesn't apply to shields.
---
Yes but there is a cool little thing called context that they don‚Äôt understand, and even so calling someone a raccoon is not the equivalent of calling someone a ‚Äúcoon‚Äù
---
I don't, keeps my guard up so I'm ready to shoot every single fucking corner.
---
Now a pulse or a lurking doc? They are what keep me up at night

Fuck you.

The only time when it‚Äôs legitimately appropriate to press F without intending it as a joke.

Press F to pay respects üòû:

Oh I also hate tower. It is roaming heaven for defenders.

Typed raccoon in chat. Not banned.

Cunt is auto moderated, why would it be a speech line

Hello ryancheung2003! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

Oh god please.

Well i can win easy without valk, but everytime we miss a bandit we get shat on

I mean...they could do something simple like a bounty board on clubshouse or a leaderboard on one of the cabinets on Theme Park
---
It used to be, thats a step in the right direction 
---
Who is israeli?
---
I hate it when I see people say ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù or ‚Äútry hard‚Äù in casual. Running out and being ballsy isn‚Äôt either of those things. Being a try hard is being in a 5 man squad and running strats. 
---
If you aren‚Äôt a child, then clearly you won‚Äôt be banned.

I wish i could get all of them, i like the look of the copper ones but dont want to stay copper for a season
---
I am having the same problem. After a few minutes it drops down to 3 GB again and then the update fails and it starts over with 40-odd GB to do. In one sense I'm glad it isn't just me.
---
Honestly hope that it's a mountie uniform.

Dude, you decided to argue a topic you self-admittedly know nothing about. Don't make a fuss when you get called out for that.

Not only the damage indicator, but he was at 82hp. MP5 would have had to have hit him 4 times to kill; Doc got 1 shot in as he was transitioning into the DBNO state for the ks.

Lol you mixed the two lines. It‚Äôs scanning for electronics and the other is scanning for devices and traps

How about a team rec one? :D

Now this does put a smile on my face

You'll find for me a m&amp;kb is more comfortable, when holding controllers my hands get cramp, and fingers, while I a m&amp;kb I don't, saying a controller is more comfortable is outright wrong, it's down to each person, if I was playing on my console with a m&amp;kb I'd be using the same monitors so doesn't matter if I could sit in a chair as my pc chair is alot comfortable than my sofa for me 
---
Still not from MOSSAD
---
Not cheating and all good now USB port on my ps4 died that's all, happy I have another 
---
Are you playing with coppers? That was the worst timing possible for everyone involved.
---
There‚Äôs this thing called the ‚Äúprep phase‚Äù...
---
Followed by a "Oy bugger off will ya"
---
How did I admit I know nothing about it? I see it used everywhere, online and in real life. I've never seen someone get upset about it. I see people get upset over cunt in my area, but that doesn't happen in Australia. Different places have different feelings on words.

It is cheating... It literally is the console equivalent of using aimbots and wallhacks. GGGP cheating plague.

Yeah you're definitely a bronze

When i encounter such players (which i very rarely do) i leave. Usualy i play with critical mass (4 stack) so we can kick the 5th if he/she acts toxic

its cool

So mute them. Report them. I'm against toxicity, but the thing is - toxic people will always find a way to be toxic. *Dead by Daylight* has no way for survivors to communicate at all, only 2 gestures, and they still find a way to be toxic towards each other if they want to.  
---
So yeah, toxicity sucks but censorship solves nothing. Since they banned certain words I've been seeing a significant rise in their usage. IN VOICE CHAT. When someone is talking shit in chat, it doesn't affect gameplay and fuck your game up. 13 year old screeching slurs into his $2 microphone definitely fucks up your ability to play.  
---
So I do believe the game would be more enjoyable if the censorship never took place. People just chose other avenues of toxicity and, frankly, those hurt us much more. Teamkilling, or even worse, bringing you down to 10 hp. Destroying your gadgets. Refusing to help or give info. In a game with so many ways to be toxic, **TYPING** no-no words is the least problematic one. Wouldn't you agree?
---
Dope
---
Just report them and move on.
---
so is Cyka for some reason
---
This is what differentiates Siege from any other FPS, there's literally no time to react, it's about information, whoever controls it and executes on it better, wins.
---
Evilllll

But R6S mostly focuses on the special forces police not the actual military.

And sometimes you die as him through your shield. Desync just makes everything way more inconsistent and annoying for all sides involved.
---
"Can we start the next round yet?"
---
"I'm on smoko, so leave me alone"
---
You are so naive thinking that this petty attempt at censoring of words has done anything to improve anyone's attitude or general toxicity.
---
All I can think of when it happens is "Get off the camera you oaf."
---
Same for me on pc
---
It's not even close to being equivalent to hacking such as walls
