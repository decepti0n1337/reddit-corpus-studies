I'm pretty sure they removed or at the very least toned done Twitch's makeup since her model redesign in Red Crow. For reference, [Red Crow](http://i.imgur.com/RRWMKM2.jpg) and [Current Build](https://i.imgur.com/6jwjbtm.jpg).

so its not that ash has got no hitboxes but she spams dodge roll?

On the 1 year birthday of Alpha packs they had weekly challenge, 20 headshots you got an epic pack, 40 you got a legendary pack

There is sorta a solution to that problem. Once you press the leave game option in ranked put in a requirement to remain still for like 10 seconds before allowing you to leave.
---
Hmmm...  ._.
---
Holographic might be the best one though. Used Red dot and Reflex but Holographic is solid. Trust me, I have an easier time killing drones when my aim is a bit shaky. Try it out.
---
So this is how mista feels when he uses sex pistols
---
I'm not saying boosting and smurfing is ok. its not. But if you are playing with freinds in a stack and cant coordinate enough to avoid being destroyed by ONE guy, then the problem is kind of on you as well.
---
18 kills in 4 rounds means he got damn near an ace **every round**. I dont care what rank he is, that should not be possible against even a semi coordinated team.
---
&gt; You're mad as hell over getting chat spammed,
---
?. Could you be any more mad?
---
That's what I assumed they meant.
---
I actually dont see anything wrong with this even if it is a bug.... just implement the same thing like Nomad but more delay on seconds of changing from ability usage to primary weapon.
---
Double negative, so I guess you are sexist
---
Seems like you got most of it. I play on console and the Anticheat doesn‚Äôt work. Friend of mine went a legit 107-2 cause he was in a bomber the entire time and no one shot him down and he got banned for it and I played with him for a bit and he was good but he got lucky in that plane. And the game did feel rushed. I was pulling kills with my tommy and sten that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. Like 8 people in 30 seconds. The game had balancing issues. Personally I‚Äôm all against issues that cause micro transactions but at least with them they made it possible to play to win things and earn them. Though they should‚Äôve focused on polishing the game before they added a BR (which if you ask me is a horrid idea and was the idea of the guy wanting money and rip people off)
---
He's a gamer guy, so it definitely works. Thot üòç

That's oddly wankable.

That's why you just spray and pray with the smg-12

It doesn't take a huge leap of logic to conclude that a game that doesn't have m&amp;k support requires some kind of adaptor to work with m&amp;k.
---
That's why I prefer he other secondary, the one I'm too much of a retard to remember the name of
---
I literally only have ONE contributed headshot lol I stopped playing as soon as I got it. 
---
I think I got it on a downed guy too ahah 
---
Mode is fun but headshots when you can two tap people with revolvers is unnecessary to say the least.
---
Furry????
---
4 times more than me lol
---
He's technically glitching. He's does it every game this season. Went from a gold 3 to plat 2 . Has a negative kd every season.
---
Outbreak was good

[I witnessed almost the same thing a while ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOGE0WaqGC0)

No
---
My squad has not touched Diamond and only a few of us touched Plat 1 because of cheaters. The current highest ranked Diamond's have near 100% win rates because they cheat. It's so obvious but Ubisoft has done nothing about it.
---
why is this guys ping 134?
---
There was a way to do that actually, but I think it was under specific circumstances.
---
No this is just perfect
---
Just because they usually act sleepy doesn‚Äôt mean people should call them out, don‚Äôt accept that it‚Äôs bullshit fight it.
---
How effective do you believe lion is for a team composition?

Can this meme die like the people who are gowing to area 51 thank you in advance XD JK this meme is amazing can't wait for the 20 I hope somebody streams it beter let Logan Paul stream it XD he told a dead body might as well live stream this than.
---
The damage and its range, although it still feels busted on hatches.
---
Recruit, rush ‚Äòem.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take a huge leap of logic to conclude that not everyone knows that the game doesn‚Äôt have m&amp;k support.
---
Again, It doesn‚Äôt help you to act like a smartass when you have the reading comprehension skills of a toddler.
---
Does it still function?
---
The way people get heard shots is due to the amount of bullets you spray at the heads using the fully auto guns. The second you have a bosg, revolvers or dmrs,
---
It's very hard to get headshots without the other guy just going for body shots.
---
Maverick doesn‚Äôt count as a hard breacher, though.
---
???????
---
Smart man
---
Yes
---
This is actually very common nowadays suprised ubisoft havent made any comments yet
---
rly tho
---
u/its_epi this one has been in for about a week now.. do you guys already end the whole disabling ops thing
---
May I ask which one are you?
---
is for friends who do stuff together
---
Someone in orange team
---
So you don't play the game and have nothing to contribute to the conversation. Well you successfully got me to feed a troll so congrats I guess?
---
Nope.  Sure, he‚Äôs capable of ‚Äúbreaching‚Äù a reinforced wall, but breachers are determined based on the damage they can do to said wall.  Thermite and Hibana are the two hard breachers in the game and are dubbed as such because they obliterate the wall.  That‚Äôs what breaching is.
---
All you gotta do is hit em in the head with the first bullet and then you‚Äôre free to just keep firing in the general direction of your enemies.
---
wait till he sees the replay
---
It‚Äôs an official Ubisoft video for warden. He just put memes on it lol
---
Had to look at this for 5 minutes straight then I finally noticed.
---
What's the strategy behind this?
---
"A really big Massacre coming right up!"

meh probably be a 10 mill side arm head-shot challenge

What

I got it on defense. Yes really.

yep nevermind. the other times it was legit server lag we were just getting ddos

I actually enjoy this gun :o tho I haven't used smg11 and bearing that much since only on dokk it sometimes makes more sense to use the secondary instead of the ar or bosg

Apparently it is... I wasn't expecting that tbh

Jackal. His gun is amazing.
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
Commando better
---
was thinking him too, tracker was my favorite perk in cod and i know these 2 games are not the same at all but i think i'll go for him, thank you :)
---
I consistently spawnpeek with warden‚Äôs SMG-12
---
That‚Äôs amazing,great work so far
---
It depends whether you play ranked or not. If so go first the 9mm is alright, if not go jackal as the pdw is a solid mid range rifle.
---
"I can see no enemies in that hallway, it's clear"
---
They are on the lowest possible settings
---
I have like 32 hours on him alone lmao. 
---
His scan is pretty nice as well. Scares the shit out of roamers.
---
I can agree with a decently sized basement it‚Äôs weird that it has no basement.
---
I am currently Plat 1 almost Diamond just a couple more points and I never encountered those bans. Jakal, caviera, mira, blitz, montagne, those are only the bans i get. My point here is the shield operator can kill you with 1 melee.
---
remember how Ying's headgear from Burnt Horizon on TTS was bugged ?
---
It's cause it's an okay skin for a meme gun, and no one wants to play the game mode since we already got our 1 free pack. And it's not worth the money it costs to get all the event items, so I think people have already dismissed the whole thing.
---
holy fuck way too many people are worked up about calling it "RB6". NEVERMIND THE CLIP, LETS FOCUS ON THAT!
---
He should have laid off those big macs like Doc told him to
---
I envy you deeply. I just got the game and learning the maps is more daunting in this game than any other FPS I‚Äôve ever played. 
---
I only know Chalet, Bank, and Consulate because I got to play them over and over again in Newcomer. I love the game but I really wish there was a way to pick maps to queue for like in CS.
---
Of all the high recoil guns I got them all to a acceptable level except thr SMG-11. My Scorpion aim is better than what I can manage with the SMG-12.
---
Exactly
---
Agreed. This should have started with week 1, not week 2.
---
They are now meant to be called"smol bois" as they are one of the lightest male ops in the game
---
How do you find this?
---
Oh okay. Maybe I didn't redeem it then.
---
Skill rank = MMR
---
That's sick
---
Yes, if you have the system to get 144 fps
---
It‚Äôs nice to see people that are playing clash, 180 like it bo2. It gives me hope as a clash main that one day, she won‚Äôt be instabanned in ranked
---
Just lost 2 alpha packs somehow? Marker lands on it and... no alpha pack.
---
Yeah I have no idea why they put the damn gun too close to your face when ADSing. IRL the slide would hit you square in the eyes and be terribly awkward to hold like that anyway.
---
Any idea why you got downvoted for this lol. Gave you an upvote though &lt;3
---
Just wanted to respond and say thank you. I've had your Jackal, Hibana, Caviera, and Valkyrie wallpapers on my pc screen rotation for a solid year now. Honestly some amazing work.
---
Oh no. Don't remind me of that!
---
How the fk did this ugly skin get to be so popular. It matches very few operator skins. The Phantom Sight seasonal skins are miles better than nearly any prior season... and goes well with every skin config out there.
---
Also the skin doesn't even seem that epic lol
---
Platinum.
---
Thanks man, idk either &lt;3
---
Who? What?
---
Put tachanka in there you filthy pleb
---
Oh
---
**FUCK OFF! STAY THE FUCK BACK!**
---
Wym it has no recoil
---
damn bro I need the pic. That's pretty dope; I never knew.
---
As Thanos said "All that for a drop of blood" Basically we're putting in so much effort for some crap class camo lmao
---
I think switching to the pistol fixes it, at least it did for me
---
You over denying everything, and thats fine. Thats your opinion but something is about to change.
---
Thats really the only option on console. The recoil is simply to high for almost anyone to control, not that I'm complaining that thing was rediculously OP on release
---
Rook spawn peak them
---
Nice
---
Tried that. I have it set on toggle, so when I tap my gadget button, it should stay on, but it would just pop open then go back. And if I held it, nothing happened.
---
Thanks
---
But its causual
---
Oof the cringiest thing here is definitely when people do characters from the game.
---
Why tf does ps4 have a goal of 7 million thats bullshit.
---
I would have to disagree both side dropped 35kills together, and if I remember correctly I had to clutch 2 rounds. (I‚Äôve a clip of the game if you like to see üòÅ)
---
Were you using a local server?
---
This had destroyed my will to draw, I will never be this great.
---
Wait then why r u cosplaying a female character sorry not trying to judge
---
if you say so.
---
Smg11&gt;bearing 9&gt;smg12 imo. Smg11 still feel like a sniper rifle, Bearing 9 at least is controllable, but smg12 is so random after the nerf. Untill ubi reduce the horizontal recoil on smg12, I wound prefer cz/pistol (warden) over smg12.
---
I like red dot and I am playing on plat :&lt;
---
Ehh. It's whatever. But if love to see the clip tho.
---
The guns are kinda so-so but the op abilities are strong.
---
This is why you always blast the wall before hand
---
Gotta have that thermcher
---
People have reiterated that before. Making the turret movable seems out of the question though.
---
Piqued* /s
---
I mean we only have a bosg and a revolver. Not as easy to get headshots.  Also they should have started this at the beginning of the event
---
Yeah, but if you're qued with the cheater then you should lose elo.
---
Does that mean I'm special?
---
Yo, Angelo
---
Sure, being boosted is a whole new thing, but don‚Äôt boosters get banned along with the cheaters ?
---
I personally prefer Zofia‚Äôs ability and guns to Ash
---
You coils get 2 alpha packs, one that guaranteed an Epic and one that guaranteed a Legendary.
---
Total of 40 kills were needed.
---
KILLER QUEEN'S FIRST BOMB!

No there's operator birthday challenges 
---
Holiday challenges and various other event challenges
---
Oh nice! Thanks.
---
I guess it's the same reason Mozzie's Commando is labeled in game as an AR despite being an SMG (because it's converted into 9mm). It's just that I thought it was a DMR since his release.
---
There are minor ones every week, but big ones like that are kinda rare.

Hello Luscious_Leonard, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cddsyk/maestro_or_clash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Grabbing rook armor perhaps?
---
If its 3rd party software that hasnt been officialy white listen then they stand to ban.  
---
The likely hood of a ban happening for it... unknown.  Probably never happen but if its not officially whitelisted then technically they can. 
---
  
---
Its always a case of use at your own risk.   
---
Could contact them and ask them if its whitelisted.  Usually though these type of 3rd party applications wont see you band but they dont whitelist because if you know your stuff you can manipulate things to gain an advantage.  Kinda like why SweetFX isnt officially supported by a large number of multiplayer games.
---
Wait what are the minor ones? Are those the super easy ones like "get two kills"?
---
Power Puff Operators

Cant bring myself to use the acogs when they have such a great reflex.
---
Instagram Normie
---
12 days late but it really sucks they didn't just give her a F2000 or some other high fire-rate low damage, no acog weapon. Instead they just slap on the FMG-9. Too bad she's from a throw away season so we'll never see her reworked/changed.

Hey

They should CV lear the confusion by adding full auto
---
are steam and uplay people playing together?

yeah but doesn't explain why this happens, the effects are pre-baked, hence why the game is LOADING.
---
Yeah, caliber and RoF mean little nowadays when barrels and mechanisms can be modified for convenience
---
One time I played 1vs5 in ranked whole match
---
Yeah. that what I use too but there are so many tactical moments Id like to have an acog advantage rather than a reflex.

Crikey that may be a bit beyond my ken, but I‚Äôll check it out for sure!

Gun knowledge bud.

Try putting the gadget away. Pressing it while having your primary out makes the glitch happen, so I fix the bug by pulling out the gadget and putting it back away.
---
I just thought of deployable shield idea for attacking shield ops, and wanted to see if someone else had it too. Looks like you were first! Here is how I came about this idea:
---
I feel like shield ops should only work well when pushing with teammates. Currently, they are also very good on a 1v1 occasion, the reason being their ability to shoot behind the cover of their shields. My (and a lot of other people's) solution is to disable hip-fire behind shields. I also want to disable ADS behind shields. For me, the only time shield ops should be able to shoot is when they put their shields on their backs (like clash), or after they deployed their shields like you described. When you are holding the shield in front of you, you can use left-click to deploy the shield, since you cannot shoot anyway. I feel this way would be more intuitive because it resembles the advance gadget deployment method, but I totally understand why you would have "switch firing mode" on your version (which I think is the best way to do it if you allow shooting while holding shields).
---
Hopefully Ubi takes this idea into consideration!
---
Ubisoft IS my dad
---
I‚Äôm hologang
---
I have plenty of gun knowledge, thanks
---
That's tragic lmao. I have it for the ump,Fmg, and the fbi m45 pistol
---
Yes we should totally make it so a bullet only sometimes kills you when you hit someone in the head...
---
This is official subreddit, typing here is the same as typing to ubisoft.
---
Justified? No. Understandable frustration? Yep.
---
There you go. üëç.
---
&gt;!gotcha &lt;3!&lt;
---
I see you're a man of culture
---
Yeah if you squint your eyes you can pretend the P10-C is a Glock, but the reflex sight kinda ruins it. The FMG-9 is a cannibalised Glock, it‚Äôs upsetting
---
Well, it doesn't exist on shotguns but why should they take it off of pistols? These are the hardest headshots to hit (yes, this case was luck).
---
 Basically, to get rid of draws, they implemented a system to stop draws. Example like a draw in secure area if your securing the site on attack and u trade , attack wins , if its off site defense wins. For bomb its the same concept if the defuser is planted and u trade attack wins, if its not planted ,like in this clip, defense should win.
---
Why is it upside down?
---
Yes, horticulture, ripping out those weeds
---
I get that but in normal gaming circumstances(without the plant going down); the round ends when all players are killed. Technically, all defenders died first. I'm not saying it's fair for anyone to be robbed of a round but if we follow the process of events, twitch killed frost first, so the attackers won the round. It would be nice if ubi clarified this as a rule (rather than the exception) so we wouldn't feel as cheated but the best we are going to get is what they've already told us.
---
That‚Äôs why you model it to look like a knockoff airsoft Glock without any logos engraved and call it a G17
---
Pistols point of aim is the tip. But using the circle in center mass might get a lucky head shot
---
Then stop playing this stupid western mode and restart your game, your settings should be restored...
---
Even in airsoft you run into issues with similar looking models. Most airsoft glock replicas are done by Umarex who has a license with them.
---
I'm 16 so it's good lol
---
 „Å®„Å¶„ÇÇËâØ„ÅÑ !

No, there is always a good pick. Look what your team has and pick accordingly.
---
I got a Thermite charge kill the other day ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Yeah we definitely aren't making it, not sure what Ubi will do i think this is the first time they've miscalculated a challenge this badly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Then again, short rounds, less players, weapons that kill quickly with bodyshots, no accurate sights... why the hell make it a headshot challenge? They could've gone with like 8 million bodyshot kills instead.
---
We? You have 0 contribution lol
---
you watch a video to learn the ops? what youtubers are you watching? faze yumi and bikinibodhi? watch pros play, watch high ranking diamonds play

If you add me in the game I can tell you how I familiarized with the normal settings in less than 100h of gameplay, 'Steam: N4meless24 uPlay: N4meless24."

It's not like I'm asking them to make some significant meta changing fixes, just 30 seconds of unnecessary animations. That's it.

Pretty far away but shouldn't be a problem

Lmaooo this shit is dumb af good work bud

I assume you are 7-9 and never saw a tities :D is this your first time?
---
I love mav. Just being able to make holes while the team makes noise, and then pick the defendres one by one is awesome. And he can breach no matter what.
---
BB is also a great choice. But he'll be spending a lot of time hanging out the windows and doors. 
---
As a defender, I'd recommend Lesion. Great gun, great gadget and has grenades. Alibi too, but her gadget is maybe a bit more technical to use right.
---
For me that doesn't work. The audio comes back on the main screen even when I quit out the match but even after that if I go into another match the audio goes again. Fuckin Ubisoft games

Anytime! :D

I've seen videos, must have been a shitshow back then lol, i started in blood orchid so the only acog I lost was the R4C's
---
I mean it's kinda subjective though, also you could have said something like: i don't like it or just nothing
---
In bomb mission, plant the defuser and put a breach charge near the defuser. And then tell your friends to stay away.

Rook is my main do not take him plz

I‚Äôll use other people for specific things, but I usually know what I‚Äôm gonna be doing/using
---
Justified. Been there done that. Poor newcomers

Thanks for the workaround. Unfortunately, this doesn't solve the problem as you need to be very attentive to this.
---
Ya

Sights are actually one thing in this game that really are fine and balanced so no
---
Randomized horizontal recoil is not that simple...
---
Fake, that operator doesn‚Äôt speak fluent English
---
I usually stare at the phone while doing it so nah, not so complicated, hope it helped anyway.
---
Better safe than sorry especially when there is amazing options like the 552
---
Except the 552 Commando‚Äôs isn‚Äôt really random at all, try spraying like 6 mags on a wall without controlling it and you‚Äôll see it goes for almost the same pattern. I like muzzle brake so try that and if that doesn‚Äôt work try flash hider.
---
Yep
---
If I were that defender, I would stare in disbelief upon seeing that kill cam.
---
just restart your game this always happens and its annoying asf

Huh. So it's one of those guns. I was being universal with my comment, since every gun has also ramdomized horizontal recoil, with some guns having actually noticeable amounts.
---
I wasn‚Äôt downed I got the final kill as you see at the start
---
Yeah, for vets. It's not meant to be for everyone.
---
Reported for toxic behavior
---
Honestly? Siege has a steep learning curve, but I think that‚Äôs mostly down to what you‚Äôre playing and who you‚Äôre playing with. I‚Äôm just coming up to 200 hours and I still feel like I‚Äôve just started half the time but I think that‚Äôs down to when I started. There‚Äôs now a newcomer playlist that‚Äôll really help and my advice is try and find at least one other person to play with, having spent most of my game time solo queuing I think it‚Äôs probably tougher to learn when you have to deal with it all yourself. It‚Äôs a solid community though and once you get into it you‚Äôll love it. Good luck and  have fun.
---
TL:DR 
---
A steep learning curve but it‚Äôs made better by friends, play with a couple others in newcomer and you‚Äôll love it.
---
Good for you, luv. I was talking about that reflex in general üòÅ
---
I haven't played hostage In a while but I remember there was a part where fuze on the roof makes a suplex to throw him down.
---
My thinking is that he‚Äôd only be able to see the camera feed, solely using this to help himself. Fuze is the most effective by playing vertically with the cluster charges so this would help a load with that. 
---
With the vertical play, this works perfectly. It also allows the pre placed cluster charge tactic to be alot more effective overall which is nice.  
---
Yes you can theoretically achieve this with a drone but there‚Äôs a lot more work that goes into it and potentially you‚Äôll destroy your drone at the same time, with also having the delay between getting off the drone and popping the charge. 
---
I think this would definitely allow Fuze to have more options and more creativity overall.
---
True
---
The randomization in horizontal recoil isn‚Äôt that significant with most weapons (with the right barrels), I‚Äôd say it shines in ela‚Äôs scorpion and the F2 after the recoil nerf, Maestro‚Äôs ALDA, fuze‚Äôs AK12 and the G36C can be annoying sometimes. Other than that it‚Äôs just a case of knowing the direction and angle it‚Äôs going and dragging in the opposite direction by muscle memory, there‚Äôll be slight dislocations but they don‚Äôt matter since you should hit the head first thing anyway.

Buff them cheeks

His elite skin and animation is about his past as an undercover agent in a bike gang, it's to tie in to his background.

I personally think hes alright. Slow dude with a gadget that if not deadly can destroy plenty of defender utility of placed right and a god tier assault rifle weighed down only by the Russian optics.

I'm not sure but i know we have some really good players here... maybe they are too scared we would become involved in their "international" competition? but yeah it doesnt matter in my opinion i always laugh when i win then matches and people call me a ping abuser.

I mean... my season started (after I was on a looooong break purely because of this dogshit of a community) to having 6 phenomenal games and 4 games of TK and "yo mama" bullshit in placements... needless to say that restored my faith in this game.  I tried to play for a while and did, had some good times, met some good people but 90% of the players I encounter in this game (regardless if it's casual or ranked or showdown or even fucking t-hunt) are complete twats. PC EU btw.

"They will bigger boards with biggar nails!"

They need to add this into the game.  There are only 2 maps i can play in thunt to warm up that i dont have to worry about bombers and c4 rooms

\*ominous jurasic park theme sound in the distance\*
---
Look at it this way, if you didn‚Äôt know not to reinforce next to your teammate then that reinforcement is probably going to help your team more than you would have being alive.
---
All of us that have been playing the game since release have been teamkilled a million times while we were learning. Probably way more than a new player will ever be. 
---
I‚Äôve tk‚Äôed so many people that hog the defuser and refuse to plant, don‚Äôt respond in game chat and just hold an angle while we control site. You deserve it if you‚Äôre hurting your team, take the lesson and learn from it instead of crying about it.
---
area 51 turns people gay?!

Best thing you can do is clip it and send it to Ubisoft support.
---
It's called Secret Star . But bare in mind . The next season you wont be able to put the current seasonal skins on the next seasons weapons . Unless they will do another cycled guns...
---
Glaz is dead and Ubi killed him. He is almost useless and you better of use Blackbeard with DMR.
---
Lesion best defender imo

And just because Im so frustrated with this problem new ram's should arrive in next couple days wich are 3200mhz. Hopefully some of these fixes this because siege is almost unplayable with this problem.

At this point if I get purposely tk‚Äôd in casual I just leave because more then likely it‚Äôll happen again in that match so it‚Äôs better to avoid those players get a different game out of it.

---
But in all seriousness, actual newbies who die to a spawn peek and then try it, probably dont have quite the map knowledge to get it right and land the kill so are a rare minority. 
---
So yeah, it'll be mostly smurfs spawnpeeking. I don't know about low self esteem but it's a special kind of toxicity where you want to ruin a game for the new people coming in that will keep this game going

Maybe the leaks are true

Too many hackers atm for them to do that

you've obviously never played league of legends

I‚Äôm pretty sure it is

I got an idea, play ranked

They could have just...y‚Äôknow...put it in the packs.

I hate when people do that, especially when I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt do it and they still do it.

Are we just gonna ignore the fact that he dodged most of that Sledge's bullets before got TK'd?

WOW HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

If you are reinforcing a wall next to one of Mira's black mirrors you absolutely deserve to be teamkilled. *Especially* if Mira is obviously hitting you or the reinforcement while you are still putting it up. Honestly, at this point just give Mira something that blocks a soft wall next to her mirror so it doesn't happen anymore. I don't even care that a Mira could abuse it I'm just sick of this shit.
---
If you reinforce right next to a standard Mira spot (basement, Oregon). You getting domed.
---
wow you're really fun at parties
---
Give him 1 drone.
---
Im glad they changed it because I spent a good 100 hours on T hunt trying to get head shots and kills.
---
Sorry my nigobable translator broke,can you say that again?
---
Good luck. Calling it now you‚Äôll get like 35 grey packs
---
People bitch and moan about this way too much the.
---
So I dont get it. Lol. You are posting this like it's a shock to you?
---
cant lie this sorta thing is justified when you're setting up a Mira but someone reinforces the wall next to the softwall you were gonna use for shooting
---
[Anyone who bitches about spawn peeking.](https://youtu.be/vla0TT5mbBc) If new players can‚Äôt get used to it early then they should just uninstall the game. It‚Äôs a game mechanic that must be learned. It‚Äôs never going to go away. Get used to it in newcomer because it only gets more prevalent.
---
Happy Cakeday !

I would call this luck since usually you have a 4 man trying to TK you and not just one.

When you finish put some shaders on and it will be lit

I was scratching my right ball while watching this.
---
A blitz that can back step like a god?
---
I mean, he's got a point
---
No, play Alibi and customizing her character is sub optimal use of her character - because if the enemy team is aware that the character model is customized, now the holograms can be more easily identified as the decoys. 
---
This is not true for any other operator in the game. Customizing Rooks outfit does not negatively harm his character unless the customized outfit itself is sub optimal (ie bright yellow CBRN suit)

Spicy Italian anger

Capitao. Or as I like to call him "Spider man with an LMG" because he's who I first discovered repelling as and I had an lmg.

Yeah dude

Isnt that what makes them valanced tho?

The crossfader skin, Y2S1 Skin
---
Yeah I thought it was a seasonal, thanks

Yeah its not awful its just bad at translating back to what it meant

I think they should make it so you can have your primary out but it has more recoil since its one handed
---
If jackal and blitz combined ;)

*just siege things*

Where the shaders at!

It be like that man.

Worth a try. Ubi would go bankrupt if they had to give everyone that killed cav $4,500
---
She brings several knives, but none of them are her's. They're all trophies.
---
Why is it a bad thing that they made something easier to get after you got it? Also, it's not like the trophies on ps even give you literally anything.
---
If you like roaming, pick up another roamer. Mozzie, bandit, Jager, cav, valk, Ela, mute. Jump from one to another
---
Reinforcing next to someone is an inconvenience. A major one, and it's annoying. Don't do it, unless asked. But it's not game breaking UNLESS, you're mira...don't fuck with your mira, she will kill you without hesitation, trust me. But otherwise people need to not be dicks just for convenience sake.
---
Don't you dare say my showdown hat + proleague uniform Alibae is wrong.
---
Personally I love both games, and they're both equally toxic in different ways, in my opinion. Siege has less toxic people, but they tend to be more toxic. In For Honor there's a lot more toxic people, but usually it's just emote or thanks spamming, maybe a toxic dm.

We are not in the that it's easy for anyone, especially not for people with setups they need to do. I'm saying it is easy for the person saying 5 seconds doesn't matter. If it doesn't matter to him, but it matters to the people making setups, shouldn't he be the one looking for some other wall?
---
They really should have just made it 2,000,000
---
It doesn‚Äôt look good. I wear Elite Uniforms and completed bundles with matching Headgears and Uniforms. I wear weapon skins that have charms that were bundled, specifically designed to go together. Mixing and matching different cosmetic items looks like there‚Äôs no good taste and looks like you‚Äôre just wearing whatever you get from ANY alpha pack. It looks cheap.

And now I regret not buying the pass instead of letting the sales bully my wallet

Can't play recruit in ranked

Mx4 + Baliff is better and more useful than the ACS will ever be. That loadout locks you out of the Keratos though, which is the single best sidearm in the game.

There are people who say they will TK or injure because of this in this thread

At least put some dirt on her face to make her a bit spooky,she also has a swamp themed headgear with dirt.

It's a carbine rifle, it's close enough to an smg but it is a rifle

I understand, try not to do that if you can, but no not justification at all

Do you have any cases of add the Glock in game with UBIsoft?
---
But that‚Äôs not entirely accurate. Let‚Äôs say your playing valk and you need to get cams up and the cams you want aren‚Äôt all near site. Every second you waste is another second ash gets to rush you while placing cams

Also literally everyone goes "What the fuck" when I play with this outfit.

The average r6 player is extremely toxic

---
Cool cool cool.
---
What the actual hell? How did that even happen?!
---
Let me preface this by saying this isn't worth a teamkill over, but it is an etiquette thing and you really should never reinforce next to someone.ot is easy to see why people get aggravated over it. When you are a roamer or have other shit you need to place and set up the last thing you want is someone reinforcing next to you, and forcing you to waste time looking for another wall that needs to be reinforced. Especially in ranked every second of prep time is precious, and you never want to be caught out reinforcing or placing a gadget, in addition to roamers need get off site as quickly as possible.
---
What do you mean? I honestly want to know.
---
That's disgusting
---
&gt;or high rank
---
Thats why
---
I believe I've seen this video
---
I always TK if someone does this. I always ask them to stop too, but if they finish I TK. What's worse is when I TK, then explain why you aren't supposed to do that, and the ( usually a group queuing together ) person goes bonkers saying how it doesn't matter blah blah blah. Yea fuck you bitches.

---
Bandit gave IQ too much speed
---
Sorry for the delayed reply. I play ranked every season without touching casuals. I am a competitive player but yes I do play on console. I do find everything else unnecessary but if you are going to make a remark like that, isn't it important you provide a counter statement as to what you find necessary that i mean see unnecessary?
---
So yes to answer your question I did read, and seeing the points I assume you do not know how to counter state - rather just disagree.
---
There is going to be unnerfed Lion, Blackbeard, and Ela in their with blitz
---
I feel the need of proof I will test this unless someone already has a clip
---
It does its job as being a way to warmup before going into mm.
---
Yeah that's what really helps. Even a 2 or 3 man squad cuts out toxicity tremendously. This game is at it's most enjoyable with a full squad of friends
---
Is this still a thing? I just play casual so..
---
Can you like not repost this again
---
Sledge should been breaking the screen after swinging his hammer
---
This is absolutely pathetic. No, it is NOT justified. There's no "wall etiquette." Never in all 1300+ hours of me playing this game have I EVER heard anyone whine about me reinforcing next to them, unless it was a Mira wanting to place a mirror, which I would then stop reinforcing (because that's a VALID REASON). I'm beyond glad that I finally realized how absolutely toxic and garbage this game is and uninstalled it.
---
Sorry that you have to listen to all these basement dwellers and neckbeards down there white-knighting this toxic kid. You were doing just fine, OP.
---
But muh etiquette and my individual importance.
---
Right and proper way to IQ
---
&gt; Echo and Lesion are easily countered by IQ blablablabla
---
I didn't say they're OP or tough opponents, I said playing against them makes the game miserable for me and others - it's just not fun.
---
It is common etiquette to never reinforce next to a Mira or anyone else unless it‚Äôs a four man wall and it‚Äôs a common spot but if not you never reinforce next to someone unless they ask you to
---
You can search on YouTube but yeah that would be better &amp; easier
---
Sorry I'm not a True Gamer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
Yeah probably won‚Äôt do much.
---
One gives you base operators and the other I think gives you year 1 operators
---
I dare you to do that with Ela's smg
---
I agree, however I understand that there aren't a whole lot of new concepts that they can add to the game anymore. I dont see ubi releasing any new ops that have the impact of Mira or Lesion without breaking the game anytime soon
---
same here
---
it's honestly worse than I thought, I've almost always been a silver/gold player in previous seasons, but I just cannot get out of copper due to people like this, it's kind of why I refuse to play ranked unless I have 4 people I know playing
---
Try it. Use ur friends. YouTube it. Idk. I used my buddies way back after they changed the laser sights from a beam to just dim dot. It turns off when you ads

I experienced what you call sight punching with her aug yesterday also on Xbox. Didn‚Äôt think much of it til I saw this post. Didn‚Äôt have the HEL glitch tho
---
People who play this game are so fucking toxic honestly. Like it's a fucking game just get over it.
---
But I don't want to sweat, I wanna mess around!
---
How is that possible when they don't respond to in game chat? Leadership requires communication. If the person with the defused is not doing anything and not listening to anyone, it's perfectly justified to tk them.
---
I've faced this back in time is cs:go. Damn those ddosers
---
Big brain
---
You'r a bit slow, but other than that you are good
---
No dominance
---
The importance is that that guy just wasted 10 seconds plus of my time, which he will continue to do to other people. By tk, I have just saved countless time for his future teammates, as well as expending my annoyance towards an idiot, and a game that doesn't matter in the long run.

---
Description: Players are losing control on their Operator and then being disconnected and presented with an error message. 
---
Status: We have dedicated a team specifically to these connectivity topics, and have identified a couple of issues that are sometimes interpreted as a ‚ÄúDenial of Service‚Äù attacks. These issues are a priority for us.
---
SMOKE GAS CANISTER PROPAGATION
---
Description: Gas from Smoke‚Äôs Gas Grenades clips through walls. 
---
Objective: Our goal is to rework the propagation so it is similar to the new Capitao fire bolt, and use this as an opportunity to revisit the visual. 
---
Status: [Target: During Y4S3] We have encountered an issue and will be pushing this change to Season 3 to ensure that it is released in a more comfortable state.
---
WEAPON SIGHT ALIGNMENT
---
Description: Weapon optics are a few pixels off center in some situations. 
---
Objective: We want to implement a system to prevent most misalignment issues in the future. At the same time, we are improving the look of the guns in ADS by adding secondary motion, which is now possible due to the tech that keeps the scopes aligned with the reticule. 
---
Status: [Target: During Y4S3] Feedback is currently being gathered in internal play sessions.
---
SHOTGUN WALL DESTRUCTION IS UNRELIABLE
---
Description: Shotguns are inconsistent when being used to destroy wooden beams. 
---
Objective: We want to ensure that the destruction of wooden beams is reliable, for both player comfort and ensuring we do not force players to spend extra time attempting to destroy wooden beams. 
---
Status: [Target: Y4S2.3] We are assessing the initial results of the change, and continuing to fine tune the destruction..
---
OPERATOR/GADGET KILL SWITCH
---
Description: Operators that are disruptive due to exploits being removed from play. 
---
Objective: When an Operator or Gadget is disabled, provide players with feedback on what/why. 
---
Status: [Target: During Y4S3] We have a bit of programming work left, and some UI work as well.
---
DEBRIS STUCK IN WINDOW/DOOR BARRICADES
---
Description: Debris sometimes remains stuck in the barricades on doors and windows, causing players to have different sight lines. 
---
Objective: Provide consistency for all players for barricade destruction. 
---
Status: [Target: Potentially Y5S1] We are currently in the design phase to determine how we want to approach this topic. We are exploring and prototyping different options.
---
ECHO YOKAI CLOAKING
---
Description: With the deployment of the Y4S2.2 patch, we implemented a fix for Yokai being seen through the glass sections of Attacker‚Äôs shields. This had the unintended effect of making Echo's drone invisible. 
---
Objective: Our balancing team‚Äôs intent is to make Yokai Drones more easily spotted in a later update. 
---
Status: [Target: TBD] We will address this issue in a future patch. Once we have more information, we will provide an update.
---
OPERATOR BANS
---
Description: We have seen a high ban rate for Blitz, Jackal, Echo, and Caveira in Ranked. 
---
Status: We are discussing how we want to approach topic of balancing around Pick/Ban in Ranked, and the Operators that are affected the most by it.
---
SMOKE
---
Description: Adjustments to the damage curve for Smoke‚Äôs Gas Canister will move Smoke further towards an area denial role. 
---
Status: [On Hold] We are satisfied overall with how this is developing, but but need to put it on hold until other dependencies are delivered.
---
he yoinked you so hard
---
Frost: angry as fuk
---
You can see who are trash players. Have to glitch the game to win üòÇ
---
That makes them usable especially on console imo
---
G O O G L E  
---
PS4 has an entire button on the controller to take screenshots, videos, and other sharing options
---
Xbox is just screaming XBOX RECORD THAT at the screen or something, it's been a while since I played Xbox
---
I'd help but I refuse to play until they can keep stupid glitches out
---
Scammed smh my head
---
Bandit's animation should been for mozzie's future elite skin
---
yeah cavs paintball gun.
---
That‚Äôs the thing, what defines an op as annoying or miserable to deal with? Shouldn‚Äôt the idea of picking an operator is to make it harder on the opposing team to do anything? The attack is supposed to put pressure on the defense and push while the defense is supposed to play for time and do whatever is necessary to stop the attackers from completing their objective. Not trying to argue but that is just something people seem to forget. You are supposed to make the enemy, no matter what side they are on, uncomfortable. They have to be cautious and weary and use every single bit of utility they have to bring the round into their favor.
---
416 is all you need
---
Thanks for not being a whiny asshole lol. Everybody here is hating on me for staying my opinion
---
Or you could do that
---
+acog duuh
---
At least his looks cool and is relevant to his gadget. Definitely A tier.
---
Just don't let downed people leave. If they disconnect, their model stays in the downed position until they bleed out.
---
p10c is I think the cz p10c, so no it's not a glock,
---
But the micro-roni is likely a g18 in an mck conversion kit.
---
Ahh ok. I was mad confused
---
Jewbisoft weaseling their way out of giving free stuff.
---
Although I don't like the general looks of polymer-frame striker-fired handguns, the Borchardt C-93 is the undisputed champion in this category.
---
Definitely not Gridlock, gravity wouldn't let her go.
---
Play with ppl who u can easily communicate with.
---
I got ranked as gold 4 and was really excited aa it was higher than any of my friends, every day after that I would play 2 games and I would always win one and lose one. That was until yesterday when my friends convinced me to play "one more game" 7 hours later i was silver 2 and had lost faith in my life. Dont listen to peer pressure kids.
---
this.
---
Man, why did they have to fix raptor legs? Such a hilarious bug.
---
Got the same problem on PC.
---
Tf did he do
---
who cares
---
I read that wrong and thought you meant session as in one game and I was like WHAT no way you jumped that many levels in one match lol
---
Activate as primary and restore licenses.
---
I could be wrong but ain‚Äôt Smoke‚Äôs FMG basically just a Glock with a conversion kit slapped on it?
---
Would‚Äôve been epic if you shot and destroyed it before he detonated.
---
I never said I was good, however you're bragging about your rank and your stupid mentality and bad habits.
---
Exactly. A game. If one cannot be patient for 5 seconds in a game, they are going to have issues out there.
---
And yes, 5 seconds is a lot of time "once the round has started". Prior to that, unless you are a streamer that plays 16 hours a day to earn a living, it doesn't matter at all.
---
Lastly, yes, clearly, we are on opposing ends and can't prove each other right or wrong. 10/10.
---
JIBOIA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
---
God damned inflation.
---
With a coordinated team, both of them are very powerful and tactical bans
---
Just realized this posted 3x sorry mods and those who care
---
&gt;1.he's meant to be long range support, not an entry fragger (that's why they've changed the optical scope to the way it is now). I will concede that his damage is way too low and that having a drop off at all is stupid for a supposed sniper. 
---
Your point isn't much of a buff. Past 10m, it is pointless regardless of your damage, and within 10m, your change makes him worse. You are only reducing his effectiveness in an attempt to buff him.
---
&gt;2. That was my whole point. At the moment you see the helmet and any pouches (or backpacks) as yellow, even though they don't count for the hit box. Removing these from the yellow highlight will cause less vexation when shooting at enemy players, because you'll know that you're shooting at the hit box and not the edge of a helmet or something.
---
After a while, you'll eventually learn what's the body and what isn't. You CAN do this as a QOL change, but this has to be the last priority.
---
Which map you playing?
---
Im not going to comment on aim or reflexes because its console and I dont have the experience to critique you there, but for silver you have good crosshair placement. At the beginning of the clip you spent 12 seconds shooting a default cam while 3 of your teammates died on the other end of the map to one person. After that you got a free kill on someone who got greedy, which is good, but then you spent over a minute baiting outside of a window which will not work once you start playing against better players. The quickest thing that can carry you into plat is purely making proactive plays rather than letting the game play itself and relying solely on your reflexes. When you droned the site you cpuld have jumped in and started making a play or rotated towards K9 or even to Library to get defuser. You pick up anorher freebie on the frost and then forget that you have a drone that you can check in site to see the jager and candela his location.  TLDR: besides training aim and reaction which everyone should be doing, you need to mainly work on making proactive plays rather than reactive plays and using your utility whenever available. Let me know if you have any questions. :)
---
I mean, this has been suggested to combat boosting for the last 4 years.
---
Good to know they have time to reply to this but not to try to fix the CPU glitch or even acknowledge it.
---
Clash is a wasted ban, should have been Echo.
---
There are a few maps that don't have bombers on them. Is this happening on all the maps you play on? It could you have the map pool limited to those w/o bombers?
---
I have recently come to figure this out but I do not own a pc
---
in US lexicon any way a carbine and a AR are only different in barrel length. All Carbines are ARs but not all ARs are carbines rule in effect also.
---
Fucking hilarious dude hahahahahs
---
He did it to em. Cause you know, he had to.
---
How about Cav sledges her way to victory.
---
Happened to me too
---
You don't need a computer to do this. All I needed was a cellphone, which you obviously have as well. Sounds like you're all set.
---
yall know this is a dead meme right
---
We never saw anything like this before, the squad was confused.
---
I'll dm it to you in like an hour or so when i will get home, if you'd still like to play
---
How many times did you post this?
---
I‚Äôm just not a huge fan of it. Nothing particularly wrong but not a fan of the layout and stuff like that
---
Why do you only hide the names of your own team but not the opposite team ?
---
So what did you plug a USB into your phone or something because I do not know how you got on your phone
---
I wonder what kinds of decisions gold 4 players make when they ‚Äòtake the game seriously‚Äô but then achieve gold 4 like ?
---
I usually do (I‚Äôm on Xbox)
---
I‚Äôve got really good fibre optic WiFi so most of the time the ping is low but sometimes my lag goes up to 300 for a few seconds then goes back down. I guess it happens to everyone regardless of the quality of WiFi. Hopefully Ubisoft fix it
---
short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: i agree.
---
Except for Kaid's shotgun, which is basically just a dmr
---
I found this yesterday and it was the first day I'd played her so I thought it was normal
---
Yh since Operation Health 
---
You should keep up with the updates smh
---
Jk basically your connection was weak at that time
---
yeah i didnt clarify that did i?
---
BB out here spreading intensive love
---
Looks like heart beat sensor attachment from Modern Warfare 2
---
This happens if I have specifically google chrome open tbh.
---
Please don't thank me, I'm one of the people hating on you.
---
Ive tried thay numerous times but somehow the bullets always miss me. But i still get one tapped through the wall as the enemy blokes are shooting at my teammate tho.
---
so another guy tried to claim the cav reward which is $4500, and they said the exchange rate was .5 cents. So this means that under that math, the reward for kaid is .0111 USD. So you could get 1 cent, or a little over 1 r6 credit.
---
Bruh what about the recruit m870 rush tho. Shield team 6 all shields? I mean come on
---
bruh üëèüëèüôåüòÇüòÇ

Walked into Goldmine 51?
---
Mira is a waste of a ban on Club House
---
"sUs aF" ya think im a smurf? if i was a smurf, i wouldnt  be bitching about spawnpeeks in newcomer.
---
bruh moment
---
The game runs worse in windowed than fullscreen, there is significant difference.
---
Not that I would justify teamkilling, but NEVER EVER reinforce next to someone. Varsity Gaming‚Äôs reinforcing episode provides good reasoning. It gets really annoying
---
Honestly, I have no words...
---
I'm beginning to believe Ubisoft's mission statement is something along the lines of "Always remain incompetent." They'll probably give everyone the skin anyways because they don't give a shit.
---
 Kaid was the one who died. So what the fuck are you talking about.
---
thanks dude
---
My ping was really high, lightning storm outside. Maybe it was a client side error? I was on the balcony outside sunrise bar rappelling up to the window area. I cancelled mid rappel animation and was knocked. No clue man. But I'm one step closer to getting that iq dinosaur chibi üòÇ
---
I posted it several times but it never showed up on my feed. I‚Äòll delete the other ones.
---
AKA Commando 9
---
Report them. Take their names, report them to Xbox Live and Ubisoft. One if not both of the platforms should take action. No mercy for hackers.
---
0 fps, but what the fuck is that ping
---
Lord Chanka is proud of you
---
I can‚Äôt stand them
---
Oh yeah, that‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt upload my clips to Xbox live automatically.
---
A strong professional scene helps any game thrive alot. If you're talking about balance, it's best that games be balanced around professional play because they know how to get everyone out of everything. You can't balance on op based on someones play who doesn't know how to use said op.
---
Dat aim
---
Looking a little more, I see that this is actually a thing now. Great, another reason why I have stopped playing the game
---
Ofcourse it had to be a thatcher main who said that
---
How does one get this wallpaper?
---
The only reason a glock ain‚Äôt in siege is that Glock(or the company that owns it) is really stingy when it comes to licensing and I I would probably get sued or something if they added a glock
---
I allways learned 0.4 = round down. 0.5 round up
---
Also I just want an bank slip saying ubisoft payed me a cent to kill caveira. ;P
---
I would print it and frame it.
---
It would be the operators responsibility to not do stuff like go on weekend benders or unannounced vacations, so they are always ready for when shit goes south.
---
Why? There's literally no reason to not reinforce those two walls, you really wouldn't even need that angle if you're defending.

Ok so if my mic is only picking up my party and one of my other teammates talks to me through game chat it‚Äôs easy to hear them? I think you‚Äôre ass backwards. I don‚Äôt care what the reason, teamkilling is fucking ridiculous and automatically makes you a scrub with the rest of us. I‚Äôm fine with apparently being scrub if setting up my reinforcements in a certain place makes me a scrub. Every single match I fucking play there‚Äôs idiots in my way as I‚Äôm trying to place my gadgets, but do I kill them? No I wait and then I put my gadget down. I‚Äôll tell you how it goes anyway. You TK me and I don‚Äôt know why then I‚Äôm screaming at my buddies to go get you back so there‚Äôs two of us dead, then someone TKs my friend because he TKed you and now it‚Äôs 2v5. No wonder its so fuckin easy getting out of siege, like a person can‚Äôt even play a full round of casual without someone just deciding to TK and it ruins the entire fucking game. Instead of having 3 guaranteed rounds of playing time now you have to wait five minutes for this round and then you can play the next two. I honestly believe what siege does know with the ‚Äúintentional team kill?‚Äù prompt should lead to potential bans if it was intentional. Don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs being an idiot, point of the game is 5 on 5. You TK then to me you‚Äôre automatically a troll, no coming back.

Also heads up for ps4 players if you see someone named johndamndoe on ranked you‚Äôll probably get booted and by probably 99% percent
---
Lol
---
Yeah the one crouch is still a problem, especially on console with the kbm/scuff warriors abusing it.
---
He fucking flew üòÇ
---
Wow some nice new fuckery
---
I only built my computer 4 days ago, so that is all foreign to me. Originally GeForce Experience had recommended everything on ultra, but I lowered it regardless, and then the frames went from a consistent 120 to like 85 constantly even after lowering the settings more.
---
Is this possible to learn this power
---
He did get a rework, Tachanka originally didn't have the turret shield, and when adsing you would look in the turret sight, he also used to be able to spin 360¬∞ while on the turret, so they added the shield and took away the 360¬∞, and made it so that when you aim it makes the crosshairs really tight.
---
blitz doing the stanky leg
---
What blitz mains?!
---
No doubt. just getting back into the game.
---
Plat 3 is like the 'I've finally learnt the maps' rank.
---
Considering they‚Äôve probably been messing with her mechanics and animations to try and prevent the claymore glitch, I‚Äôd bet that‚Äôs the reason this happens, not because they want to add it. Just a glitch
---
yeah but R6S looks odd too?! What's the most common acronym...?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bond5s/what_is_a_good_headshot_percentage/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

There‚Äôs a difference between playing for 105 hours, and playing for a year and a half on console and then switching to pc. Getting Plat 3 is a feat you should be proud of but don‚Äôt try to make yourself seem bigger than you are by stretching the truth.

This just reminds me of the KISS video for "Lick It Up."
---
Thats casual for you.
---
That‚Äôs pretty shit, not going to lie.
---
That is great, the only thing my amateur eyes could pick up on was no freckles on Ela
---
The zoom helps for long distance gunfights. You can be more accurate at long range. However, this game is primarily close quarters and if you avoid long distance gunfights, you don't really need to use ACOG.
---
Actually i like that shotgun more
---
Ohhh fair enough. It did look a bit weird seeing three in a row. Sorry if it sounded mean
---
I was just wondering why someone would downvote your comment,but upvote the same one right below it lol
---
thank you, I figured.
---
You know the PS4 &amp; XB1 have built in gameplay clipping and sharing functions
---
I solo que. Placed silver 3. First season, first time playing ranked. Got addicted, lost 7 matches, ended up with copper 3.
---
Honestly it's quite easy to tell them appart
---
Holograms have no eyes
---
Besides if they looked diffrent people would not panic more if it was widely known that this change exists
---
Dont get too excited. They were tram killing me and being toxic the whole time. That's why the last one left
---
It‚Äôs such a good feeling
---
Will you be playing Ash?
---
I usually need to reach 40 to 60 percent to get a pack. I was extremely lucky with this one.
---
That‚Äôs because when you‚Äôre a noob and ask questions or talk you get tk‚Äôed half the time.  I have a friend who got tk‚Äôed just for saying ‚Äúhi.‚Äù  People feel like they‚Äôre walking on eggshells in this game and anything they do will set one of the psychos off.

In the map their is a poster of Caveira saying:

I suppose I understand what you're saying. I'm just annoyed by the fact we have to wait until next year in general for this debris stuff to be fixed.
---
What's worse is that you're running iron sights on a gun clearly made for holo

they be hiding jager acog there

Yeah I can understand that. We‚Äôve made it this far with the debris issues so it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to deal with it just a little longer.

They need to make flashes do an effect to hearing if you just look away

Casual yes I play it often and every now and then ranked.

Let me get home and I'll share you all the info!

I got my first legendaries after 300+ hours last week.  They were very bleh.

Doesn't really make it that hard, you can register multiple accounts to the same phone number.

Also, I wouldn't appreciate having it made so I'd need to get another phone to have a smurf.

More noise maybe

What the fuck where they doing lmao but good rush you beautiful Maverick.

It takes place in what would become Truth or Consequences, New Mexico.  Judging by the delorean, the year is 1895.  Adjusted for inflation, Ubi owes you 137,219.46$ USD.  There is a legal principle, Promissory Estoppel, that, according to investopedia, states that ‚Äúa promise is enforceable by law, even if made without formal consideration, when a promisor has made a promise to a promisee who then relies on that promise to his subsequent detriment.‚Äù  Now obviously the poster in game holds no legal weight.  Until an official arm of Ubisoft acknowledged the post and entered into a legal agreement with you (even without formal consideration) that could feasibly be enforced using promissory Estoppel.  Lawyer up, my friend, win it for all of us.

I‚Äôve played 1k+ on pc never had someone banned in game

I wish :(

So new wow omg haven't seen and heard this one before.

What on, ps4 pc or xbox

Do you solo queue?

And shouldn't be able to track footprints from a minute and a half ago. Ridiculous.

Finally another person that plays xbox

GKS variant in bo4 concept
---
Yeah but you said it in a nicer way
---
How do you get up there ?
---
Stop that thing gives me nightmares.
---
I'll take that as a compliment.
---
All I did was offer to let you see what my rank is? You‚Äôre the one freaking out over the internet about someone doing something you don‚Äôt like
---
I am, as you can clearly see.
---
Honestly, Blitz is just straight up poorly designed. His high ban rate is because he sucks to play against, regardless of if it's too difficult or not. It's just not fun.
---
Actually they‚Äòd have to round it up to one cent.
---
I hate such a capitalst behaviour.
---
yes.
---
They are busy making skins to sell.
---
 **Description**: We have seen a high ban rate for Blitz, Jackal, Echo, and Caveira in Ranked. 
---
This means that morons will nerf them soon. But there is no problem with MAVERICK beeninng slient when using his super balanced gadtet, for how long now? And what is the counter for him? C4!!!! (words of devs)! GJ!
---
Soon BAN system will be useless - because of ideas for operators will double. (kaid-bandit, hibana-thermite, nokk-cav/vigil \[i know that they are not the same\] - but soon we will have Echolike op in attack. Dont even bother with changing this system - you will break it more, as we all know, you will - dear devs.
---
Rampart hacking glitching boosting and more. These guys are wakeing up once in a season - posting info like above and they are thinking that this is awesome. FFS no!

Is R6 is in need of Operation Health 2? YES in my personal opinion. Bugs and glitches are unbearable.

It started as a bug but they left it in as it didnt bother anyone as people knew to just check corners but then new players joined complained about how this was abuse of the shield and they nerfed it (still in game just got corrected by another guy)
---
When he gets banned, it‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt know how to counter it properly. The character in defense is pretty useful.
---
Rage. It happens to the best of us, the trick is not to get disheartened. Maybe you can say ‚ÄúThat Guy was shit I shouldn‚Äôt have lost‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat was my fault I died there‚Äù and that‚Äôs ok, the next step is learning from those experiences.
---
Maps. There are a lot of them, all maps are in casual and I think there is 12(?) in ranked, try learn them as much as you can. It will take you a very long time and it is trial and error but you‚Äôll gradually get better.
---
Sound. Sound is very unique in this game, there are videos on YT explanations how the sound works, I would highly recommend watching them. This takes some getting used to and even the best players make mistakes with sound so just try your best.
---
Operators. The characters in the game all counter each other directly and indirectly, certain ones work well together and certain ones don‚Äôt, as you play you will realise who does what and who plays certain roles. You won‚Äôt be able to get all of them immediately but the basic ones you can get are what the game is based around so you are not missing out that much.
---
Enjoyment. It‚Äôs a game after all, while it can get tense and frustrating you‚Äôve got to remember that it‚Äôs for enjoyment, if the game is stressing you out there is no need to carry on playing, just stop for a little while or maybe for the day. No one will judge you or look down on you! I made this mistake a lot a few seasons back.
---
Best of luck!
---
He's French, of course he did.
---
No it doesnt, it depends on how much you have played
---
Wow this same thing again. I haven't seen this exact same spot posted 30 times before
---
Impossible, cav isn‚Äôt banned
---
They should nerf the concussion effect, it‚Äôs ludicrous how long it lasts. That‚Äôs my only gripe with him.
---
and other games work just fine, don't know whats wrong with siege
---
Is this it? [https://t.co/PEkrMb9kiJ?amp=1](https://t.co/PEkrMb9kiJ?amp=1)

Yup, I started ranked in Gold 4 this season as well. Decided to play it somewhat regularly for a few weeks. Now Casual players bully me for being Bronze 3. Help me guys.
---
Yeah I know, but I just hate that guy's attitude, I know I wom't convince them, but maybe someone else reads that interaction and changes their viewpoint before they end up too far gone as well
---
Hahahah you actually took me fucking seriously holy shit
---
Ikr that‚Äôs rare but cav is a pain in the ass
---
I work in Software Development and do game development for a hobby. 7 months sounds like a system rework or major overhaul. My suggestion could be coded in a work week or two (depends on their tools), QA'd within the month and tested in the next season.
---
Both quick and right. Even if it pushes their planned changes back or this fix would be removed in Y5S1, it's solution for sooner rather than later.
---
But I obviously have no idea how the Ubisoft's internal workflow and systems functions, nor will I pretend to. I problem is this isn't a "7 month" issue, it's been a problem for over a year and will be closing on 2 years by the time Y5S1 rolls around.
---
It depends on how many matches you've played. It's part of getting to your "sweet spot". The more matches you play the closer you are getting to where you belong so you start gaining and losing less
---
You have the best username on this sub
---
That's what the 2 frame option does, yeah. If you had a 60 fps monitor, turning on 1 frame vertical sync would limit your fps to 60, turning on 2 frame vertical sync would limit it to 30. That should consume far fewer system resources. 
---
There's also an option to limit your fps in menus, I think. That's usually where the gpu starts going wild in some games. Just poke around the graphics and display options, most of them should have descriptions of what they do.
---
Actually none whatsoever besides the fuze elite skin I use on the PMM. I just got extremely lucky with alpha packs
---
I also noticed Kaid ‚ÄúThe Moroccan Cobra‚Äù has a bounty in his head as well.
---
That's what I'm wondering
---
I‚Äôm sure if he stood still, he still would have dodged your shots.
---
The insane amount of discipline to not fire at them is very impressive. Shooting the breach charge broke me lololol
---
WHEEL he take home the win? Find out next time, on terriblepuns!
---
Ikr i have never seen anyone do that
---
nah its se√±or sin casa
---
At least he didn't surrender üòÄ
---
Because it is abuse. Allowing people to glitch into unintended locations is a slippery slope. How long before players start finding walls they can clip into again if they left it completely untouched?  
---
And they didn't nerf it, they "fixed" it by making the shield collapse immediately on detection. It still being possible is still an unintended bug. It was never changed "Because people can't check corners", it was because it's a bug.
---
I believe there was simply no debris. Not like the current one anyways.  
---
Which is honestly preferable, I'd take less eye candy over dying to bullshit any day.
---
Blitzraptors!! I knew it!
---
I potatoed of course I‚Äôm going to miss
---
That‚Äôs what she said!
---
All we wanted was another alpha pack that‚Äôs it not a skin for a gun most people prob don‚Äôt have
---
Ayy lmao
---
You weren't in the game...
---
The Legacy operators doesn't cost much . While the DLC operators are pain in the ass . Thanks to operator price reduction . it started to become easier to gain for DLC operators
---
Do they have ninja defuse award
---
It‚Äôs not bad but rather you were unlucky that happened. 95% of the time I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs solid in terms of stability.
---
So if you buy the base game you get the basic 20ish ops off the bat then you save renown(in game currency) to get all the other ones. I've been playing a year and a half and had to spend renown on all the base ops as well and just got all the operators. It's a bit of a grind but Atleast you get time to learn each operator instead of a bunch of operators you know a little bit of but it not much of a chance to master each. Also now it's way easier to buy since when I started buying dlc ops it was 25000 renown but since February it costs less for older ops so shouldn't be too bad

Really demoralizing when 3 teammates suddenly get the urge to role play JFK.

Find a squad . problem solved

In other words it's not too bad now. Was a little annoying when I started November 2017
---
I mean with Ubisoft's track record I believe the concern is that it will be neither.   
---
7 months is also outrageously long for a huge issue, especially one that can be easily be disabled in the meantime.

Super sick dude

No scopes gives you better view, acog takes up tiny portions around the ports that you could be using for peaks, plus slap a grip on and that bitch is unstoppable, acog prevents room sweeping, iron sights makes long distance and room clearing that much easier
---
If you want to get there you gotta prove you can make it
---
How did it go, did ya ace
---
are people deaf?
---
For some reason I was under the impression the Starter Edition had less than 10 playable ops.   20 is a decent start.    
---
So a DLC op is at most 25,000 renown?   And whats the renown acquisition rate you guys would say?
---
Lmao, ‚Äúmaybe in lower ranks‚Äù it‚Äôs definitely jackal, I‚Äôm a plat player btw, it‚Äôs going based off the most common ranked bans which are jackal, blitz, echo, and caveria
---
How dare you underestimate his power
---
Yes we know you're retarded OwO
---
But it's still finka...
---
&gt;concussive cameras that are **99% invisible** are very difficult to play against without an IQ.
---
Maybe on consoles or PC players with small screens, but I have no issues spotting and prefiring Echo drones. Its glowing effect is a big giveaway, especially in doorways and such.  
---
On the contrary Lesion is a bigger issue than Echo with how much he gets rewarded for his 0 skill invisible mines.
---
Every time i seeing post like this, i always have question: What about start doing something? We don't need to know how much info on some issue/problem you got. "Less talking. More action". Stop this "We know about this issue we have a plan to fix it", just fucking fix it. Then you finally start fixing something , this game will lose a lot of players. What is your problem you armless lazy bunch of a-holes? You are fixing release problem for 5 years, fixing small problems for months, lol. And we have to do is struggle and waiting. For years.
---
How did you get this
