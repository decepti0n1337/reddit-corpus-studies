How about the blonde woman who shoots them down?
---
---
---
Which cosmetics? 
---
The only known free cosmetic(s) I am aware of for Pulse and Castle is the Division 1 Weapon Skin.
---
Same thing happened to me except I didn’t have a friend to help me stay in

Affected services:

Buying downloadable items, My games &amp; apps

Latest update:
---
Our engineers and developers are actively continuing to work to resolve the issue causing some members to have problems finding previously-purchased content or purchasing new content. Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience.
---
kinda fresh doe
---
Oh, thats like, 3 of my favorite attacking ops.
---
Zofias gun is super fun, and if you want to still be one of the most active fraggers in the team, she is a good choice, esp since she brings some good utility and her withstand feature can come in very clutch.
---
Dokki has a good tool to push and not instantly get peeked by a roamer, since you hear their location. The hacking of the enemy cameras is also extremely useful and pisses of Valkyrie, which is a huge plus. Her gun does good damage and has basically no recoil, but you are probably going to die to headshots if you aggressively push with it, since it is a DMR and single shot. It still can delete enemies
---
Gridlock is good in coordinated teams and/or in some maps. Like Dokki, she has smoke grenades, which is awesome utility, and she can close of common flank positions pretty effectively, allowing you to replace flankwatch. Her normal rifle is a headshot machine laser, but with bad damage, so you want to aim for the head, while her lmg is pretty controllable and has extremely effective suppressive fire. Awesome sight and decent dps make it a pretty well rounded gun.
---
So, it all depends on your playstyle. Active fraggers that want a bit of supportive power should go with Zofia, if you hold angles and hate roamers, Dokki it is, and if you tend to play more support and utility, Gridlock is a pretty good pick, esp in a coordinated team
---
Ehh idk usually it's either a 4 stack or people are just doing it to be mean. I ended up in one of those lobbies and got tk'd for not kicking the 5th person.
---
No more.
---
Absolutely untrue.
---
Noones been DDoSsed.
---
Why comms should be a requirement to play.
---
Hmmmmm....HOLY HECK HES FLEXIN
---
Been noticing it to.
---
Plz help Ubi there's an IQ main
---
Uh... okay, does that mean the fixes arent live yet?
---
MP5 is a far superior headshot machine though.
---
Elite skins are the only skins with art on the background
---
Or a midget Australian ginger who takes over their minds.
---
notifications don't mean shit in this game..
---
Yeah usually my ping is about 40 but these days it goes up to even 1000. Lost many matches in ranked because ping
---
Xbox devs communicate with the game developers such as Ubisoft to resolve the issue on both sides and ensure everything is working. I assume by the time it's ironed out the page will be updated, as per usual.
---
I got one on 2% yesterday it was a shit legendary
---
Yeah my stepmom inspired me after we fucked while my dad was at work
---
Too true lol that’s why I switched to pc it’s still there on pc but not as much
---
More?
---
NGL probably me. Little kids trigger me, winning or losing.
---
Losing 0-2?: No worries m8, just a game.
---
However kids going "I WaNtED aSH, i BeT YoU sUCk WitH hER", chip noises, mumbling and laughing so loud at a PewDiePie video, is an instant TK.
---
I am
---
*tips fedora* m’lady
---
Hmm that's wierd, me and my friend were messing around in a photo editing app (not photoshop) and found this cool effect so we added it on the poster.
---
i shoot my friends in the leg sometimes and if they afk i will TK them is that ok ?
---
Man I miss the Necrochasm. I don't use auto rifles in Destiny 2 but if they brought that gun back I might just start again
---
Jackal is great. Amazing guns, great gadget if you know how to use it, waste of an operator in the hands of noobs.(they often die because of how they use it) but I'm not sure if you'll get use out of him in ranked.
---
Happened to my friend the other day
---
A free player who has Jackal?
---
F
---
Acs 13 op? I see you do not like walls very much
---
Invisible you mean? Well on console the invisibility is bugged currently so they are completely invisible while on pc it should be normal.
---
Whoa
---
Out of those 4 for me, I would choose dokkaebi and maestro.

Unfortunately you’ll never be able to play him given that he’s banned in all levels of gameplay in ranked
---
I need to delete those
---
You uploaded three pictures of yourself with this costume. You the one you uploaded on our twitter of you outside you clearly don’t have muscles and your abs are less defined
---
That would be a good idea you might get ban for spamming or some shit
---
Shhhh... lets just say Ubisoft is the problem so that we can further push the over used scape goat that the game is broken!
---
Nice
---
Guys the servers are down what’s the deal have you heard anything if I don’t play rainbow I get angry and my mom will make me leave her basement
---
If this was xbox everyone would have 9999 ping except for one guy named check wifi because hes losing in casual
---
cool
---
I think xbox is killing itself right now.
---
Yea I think you're right that lesion may be the best choice for me
---
Or go on an LFG and run a 5 stack
---
Yea I play a lot of casual, I just prefer it over ranked since I’m not super good.
---
She is usually a favorite to release a bundle for.
---
He is a force to be reckoned with if your a good solo player who kinda roams.
---
But for over all value to the team he’s meh
---
FR went from crap gun to melting gun.
---
Sheesh! No idea what the blitz was doing but nice job
---
[removed]
---
You're correct. The lighting outside was not in my favor, and I had just ate. Lol neither was I flexing every muscle I have. If you think abs are just there, all the time without flexing, you're very mistaken xD unless you're the Rock or extremely fit, which I am neither. I have abs, and if you need more proof so you can just appreciate the work I did on the cosplay itself, feel free to dm. Lol
---
Maverick just knifed our lord out of existence
---
I wonder what they are talking about.
---
I was like that too at one point but, after I started to really play ranked is when I started to improve the most. Try giving ranked a shot, and don’t worry about your rank, you’ll eventually get matched against people your skill level.
---
"Mods do your job" aw fuck they get paid for this fan community page now?
---
nice and creative imo
---
*cries in copper 3*
---
Do a recruit cosplay next
---
Is there any statement saying how long it'll last?
---
No
---
I can’t even get in the game
---
the person who picked castle was castle
---
You're welcome
---
Yeah Is it just on xbox
---
OH! for some reason i thought it was a from a limited timed event i missed or something. thanks
---
Worst is when you go ranked with a full team, the enemy starts TKing, get everyone with reverse friendly fire and still end up losing to them
---
Can I buy these?
---
I had this happen to me
---
Woah!!
---
Maybe he is not a free weekend player but I recorded it at the last free weekend
---
*Spawn in*
---
Reverse friendly fire: I am inevitable
---
Yeah Overkill\_. and YUNG\_ZOOT\_CAT are pretty legendary guys.
---
Oof
---
i’m not even ranked yet so don’t feel bad lol. my psn is toolivefn .
---
Lesion
---
Random I believe. Luck of the draw
---
They aren't instant kill. They do 60 I think
---
that’s gotta be the smoothest killcam in the history of r6
---
Fuck man how many times does Blackbeard gotta be nerfed before this game is fixed
---
Siiick
---
He said nothing about you being a girl, there’s no proof you edited but he didn’t say anything about you being a girl...

I contacted they say that the suport is not avaliable now.

I think you mean win

Servers at ubi are down

This was from a long while ago, I havent been on Xbox for awhile.

Exactly!

how long until the fortnite fans arrive and say "YOU RIPPING OFF MONSTER FORTNITE REEEE"

I think it depends on ping. Also, if they touch the very end of the laser I don't think it kills them if they're at full health.
---
ethernet cable
---
Aw dang
---
doesn’t her gun have loads of recoil?
---
Ye
---
Xbox live is down trying to fix a faulty bug across their services. All online content is down.
---
It's still pretty good, I've kept winning with her cause how good it is, and if you don't like her smg then you can use her shotgun
---
Maybe don’t say dumb shit like that and you won’t get banned. Poof.

true that

I do not agree with the guns but they should add an operator like Goliath that can block a window

Ya they do, had one happen to me a couple of days ago

It's just Xbox servers, Microsoft never does anything right

see I had a similar idea for a defender called patch. they would have a small reinforcing plate that could be put over windows or holes in reinforced walls or normal walls to stop attackers from coming inside. basically like a smaller reinforcement to cover things up

He's not new, this is some megamind shit

secure the rear

Maybe stay outta the discussion if you have nothing useful to contribute.

Meanwhile I’m here choking games to save my copper 4 ranking

Another good spot close to your  Evil Eye is on the wall above the hatch, then open the hatch below.

But muh angled grip

all i can say is keep on contacting. Eventually they will hear about it. Good luck

People in my discord server are saying it's fixed now
---
Yeah headshots are a one hit kill, so sometimes you die immediately with no warning and you’re almost in disbelief.  No matter your rank or experience it happens to everyone once and awhile at least.  T-hunts helped me with my reaction time and aim, and like MegaNUT said its all about finding the Ops and abilities that feel right and fit the style you want to play with.
---
how old is this? the m249 has a different scope now
---
So you didn’t ace.....
---
r/IMeantToDoThat lol
---
for me on Xbox in the morning the game is dead, but at evening it's easy to get a match , might be the server your in but..
---
I like how you assume courtesy as wanting sex or favors. Really says a lot about your personality.
---
Chaire stranger...
---
what if you can't afford a keyboard
---
My teammates most definitely did not like that
---
I thought clipping was only a battlefield thing
---
No ubisoft dont care
---
Warden wants one
---
IQ, she can see yokai, although it can be annoying to shoot them if they keep moving
---
Well coming from a Valkyrie main I’ll take Jäger you guys already have it hard enough I’ll stop the grenades for you
---
They're working on this next season.
---
Then you wouldn't have a pc
---
The game is very different for silvers and below lmao
---
You ever see screenshots from people playing where the focus is on something going on in front of the operator but all you can think is “What in the name of Odin’s ball sack is that loadout?”
---
Happened to me.
---
&lt;3
---
I read this as ayy bee game, and was like the fuck is that, maybe it's like a shorthand for a muscle, look back at pictures, o it's just abs I'm stupid.
---
I kind of feel bad for his teammates.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I figured.  Ela’s a monster on defense when in the right hands.
---
Me and my friends haven't had any issues
---
What happen
---
w-why
---
Because it would cost much more than a keyboard
---
You made my day man. Thanks.
---
You must work out a lot. Abs and body type looks really lean. Looking good !
---
"Coming right up, fucking one big hole"
---
you could have spent all your money on your pc
---
I love playing recruit, and not just for the German shotgun. This one time in casual i was able to "persuade" my team into a recruit squad, this lead to beating 3 diamonds and 2 plats in a casual game.....It got so much better when the enemy team went full recruit and that was the most chaotic/fun match ive had.
---
No one does that
---
Yo, Angelo
---
It's the same reason why people think smoke and mute playing shotgun SMG11 is bad. It doesn't matter that they're bad at long range, because you don't play those ops when you have lots of long gunfights to take. 
---
You gotta be a special brand of stupid to take smoke with shotgun smg11 to play banana on bank CEO defence, for example.
---
The mp5 May be better but nothing beats the feeling of getting a p90 headshot
---
G2 Raleigh strats leaked?
---
apart from the people that did that
---
He's just mellowed out from his pirate days and gotten a glass eye
---
the one tachanka tho
---
No one would buy a pc with no monitor, keyboard, and mouse
---
Headshot problems are a thing. They just started popping up a few weeks ago (at least on Xbox they just did).
---
Also just realized, flair does not check out on the original comment
---
Its pretty spicy
---
First ace is on a 1v5. Now you have nowhere to go
---
Isn't meek mill dead?
---
wow so funny
---
Lol I would never clickbait anyone here
---
Let's Fuze the OBJ
---
Dude you should play smoke or mute, they are both easy to pick up and also very helpful
---
Im staring at a doorway, no ones there. I look away for one millisecond, the entire fucking team materialises there.
---
Mr.pit is dead that is a fake doot tell that juden to upload more, we want more vids and memes
---
The shields absorb a lot of the damage
---
“Lonely”... how tf are you going to assume I’m lonely. Lmao
---
What’s this song
---
were they rushing?
---
For me it was down to a 1v4 and I was pushing the site and just as I took down one that rushed me the other three all poked their heads out of three separate angles.
---
yea i am aware of that,that the steam version still uses uplay,problem with my region and a few other regions is that ubi changed the stores in game so people using the steam version arent able to buy skins,its been 7 months now and they still havent fixed it yet,not ETA nothing,so ive just decided to get the Uplay version,would be alot better if my accounts merged,even though theyre both run off Uplay.
---
*evolved warden*
---
Sad to say my flair outranks yours, and it does count
---
I remember my last game as level 69, it got me platinum. Never forget
---
I used to play smoke a lot but shotguns are very inconsistent in this game and I don't like smg recoil. If I'm holding an angle on the objective I'd like something that works from farther away. 
---
Alternatively I choose to roam and caviera is good at that.
---
*I see you are a man of culture as well*
---
Just starting is horrible, get a team fast
---
Nope, just plain bad luck
---
I'm with this guy
---
Zofia with the lmg 3. 150 rounds
---
I think Zofia with her LMG (can’t remember the name). I believe it’s 150 rounds
---
That’s a pro move
---
Time to sledge that obj.
---
oregon, fuck that map
---
Nice. I made a smurf named after him back in the day.
---
true, but for context everyone was being toxic in the op screen at start of round
---
It still counts because he still killed 5 people. Dont be  completely ass hole
---
Hereford base, fortress
---
Mediocre cake day? :l

---
autoban no. but if you have something that ubi doesn't like and you get reported, then yes
---
It terrified me when I first heard it after killing a blitz. I freak out and start panic firing where I heard it lol
---
The name would have DlCK or DICC
---
Yep, but I still want to find screams and yelps if I can
---
That’s when all the no lives play cause all the casual players go to sleep like human beings
---
*+10 Penetration*
---
What a waste of time get a life instead of putting skulls on operator icons
---
He’s silver...
---
yeah and? He still is queuing with lower ranks. Of course, it’s not as severe, but he’s still doing it
---
oil painting in digital drawing program unless its just a filter lol
---
Nah he’s leading you into a trap
---
Then of course bandit must place a battery to charge them
---

Maybe your ping was higher than him lol

---
horizontal sensitivity 60 
---

---

---

---
Looks like a filter. Please stop.
---
I actually liked the idea. While playing hostage or secure area it might work if I can place it in proper place :-D
---
Not really but ill try these out
---
Well that just confirms the screenshots of the characters not their names yet; also Ubisoft does need to upgrade their engine for Siege
---
Well it's easier to move the mouse really fast and slow when you want it
---
imagine actually taking the time out of your day to be a pc master race troll lmao, your community is the sole reason i don’t play on pc, not even the hackers. 
---
pc + friendly community = doesn’t and will never exist
---
thank you for your time i never needed nor wanted, bye now 😄
---
Right so then by ur logic he can be countered by any operator because any operator could bait him therefore an extra ban wouldn’t even matter.  I’m thoroughly enjoying this argument haha
---
As toxic as this game is in general I do feel very bad about our gamer sisters in arms.
---
But what im saying is any kind of ban limits options.
---
Thanks I appreciate the long comment, looks like you really picked me apart and comments like these from experienced people really help, so thanks for the time
---
I cant read rhis so that doesnt apply to me
---
it was actually ranked, but the other 4 got booted right when the game started but i didn’t know that until it was 3-0 and they rejoined
---
Ranked has always been made to be played properly - polishing and improving is not the same as not playing properly. Ranked is supposed to be the mode where you have to actually do the strategic part of Siege and that, at least in my experience, happens in the majority of games past gold. 
---
You can add/remove ideas without testing based on concept. There is nothing strategic on banning specific operators and then randomly loosing one that you were planning to use. I'd rather in that case get two extra bans.
---
Siege is a tactical game, and while you can't get rid of all RNG in a game(e.g. bullet spreads, explosion radius hits etc), you shouldn't, imo, add more and remove the strategical parts. 
---
Of course just my opinion, but I think it'd be dumb as hell in ranked. In Casual/Non-Ranked, it'd be fun for a bit of extra challenge, but not in ranked.
---
Well that’s where sensitivity comes in. Yes a mouse can move faster then a stick but that’s why you can adjust sensitivity to increase your speed. There is a certain finesse to it. There was a rotation curve added that allows you to be more accurate with the speed at which you are moving the right stick so aiming and moving your crosshair can be more flexible.
---
Ok well as a pc master race member i will allways find a mouse way better but thank you
---
Yeah been getting that a lot, I’ll keep it mind next time
---
But not really because now almost every operator has a twin and that’s how siege is going to go down these new seasons I bet. Like there’s two hard breaches (hibana/thermite) and two tracking operators (lion/jackal) and two shield ops and such
---
I played siege while it was on those smaller rocks, if you can control the recoil P90 is way better. Bigger mag and higher rate  of fire just make it better.
---
Dont main anyone. Be a flex. Nothing worse than someone who mains
---
Ok then? I guess you’re welcome. Console isn’t all that different to PC Siege you know. The only difference from my experience is the ability to pre lean. Were you under the assumption that console had no recoil?
---
And yet, objective is somehow found.
---
No worries. Make sure to have a reference for it while you're drawing, you want to keep in mind the distance from shoulder to arm when a stock is pressed into your body
---
I was not sure it was something i imagined possible
---
Can I get info or discord link I’m interested
---
But the 'twin' works in a way that makes them suiyed for different tasks. Hibanas betyee for hatches lion is not really a tracking operator he is more of a support
---
True
---
Because people seem to always upvote low-effort content and the mods aren't really the most consistent ones.
---
Time for some serious protection
---
Nah, he's too good, he has 20 jammers and wants to be sure noone passes by
---
Both, pick whoever is better in the situation. If the enemy defenders are on a site like border, armory pick Buck because he can nade and shoot through the floor with next to no trouble, at the same time a Thatcher who throws an EMP att the armory wall could easily get onetapped from the very hole he and his buddy has made

Yeah I believe so
---
well I mean technically....  the butt is a biohazard container
---
Is this 4k or real life. I cant tell the difference
---
If your running the six-12 and expecting to be competitive your dumb. Not many operators have guns that are all 100% viable. FMG isn't strong but it's not awful and the newly buffed deagle is one of the better secondaries in the game now.
---
the risk of him fraud / scamming is high since in germany the most known Youtuber (Gronkh) has about 5 million suscribers and each video of him has about 50 - 200k Views 
---
I don't know he is a fraud...
---
Looks kinda like the cover of Uncaged V7
---
Awesome cake day :D
---
Yeah! Something like that! Now the train of thought i went with is if some enemies were pushing the point, and taking their time, then you go full fucking cool aid man on their ass from behind and shoot them up like an American public school
---
dayum, they probably accused you of cheating after?
---
I'm not expecting to be competitive, and the only way I'll use the SIX again is with ying and a flash grenade
---
I'm having a ball
---
Well then

If your RAM runs on 3200, it's already overclocked

Yes

We need more unique guns. I vote for literally anything Ian talks about including poacher guns.

I play also EU and in playing ranked right now no

It doesn't have an acog. So use the holo or reflex. The gun has a much better dps than the g36c

Yeah the boys
---
I dont think he should get pings at all. It doesnt make any sense that he knows your exact location based off a single footprint made 2 minutes ago on the other side of the map.
---
Instead I think he should get 3 uses where he activates his gadget allowing him to see footprints for 5 seconds (No leaving it on all game) He can then scan a set to see even after his gadget wears off until he chooses a new set or the owner dies.
---
This is a rendering. I modeled everything in Cinema4D and textured/rendered it using Octane.

I do this in casual or ranked games where we are winning 3-0 it’s fun ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

and me opening so many packs and don't get shit, congrats man
---
Well this system will work only on some levels of the community, and really forces the teak into communicating instead of encouraging or rewording it
---
Also in a round that is 3-2 minutes the pings go a long way to make sure no side takes it too slow
---
Why do you even do that?
---
I had a phase were I would only get common/uncommon then **BOOM** black ice for days

Reminder that console players still don’t have the FOV adjustment option

I don't know anything about guns, i just looked it up and saw one mag contained 30 x 5.56.
---
I don't know about the bottom. I think im changing it when i get home
---
Nah, he's doing it wrong. It has to be elevated to stop the drone game above.  Best to put all four on a table. /s
---
They really ruin the game. I went in ranked solo like a dumbass and every round they'd spawn peek and die, then scream in the mic till the point I couldn't hear.
---
Also moving around has your gun bounce with each step. Currently we're robots on segways with absolutely zero deviation while we rapidly strafe side to side (add momentum based movement to stop the sudden direction changes too) while being shot.

the skins started this season. so the ops this season didn’t. every other op has one. why would they give the new ops the old type of birthday reward and give all the other ops the new one. it’s pointless.

You can look up and see if your case or motherboard has software to go with it and use that. Your bios might also have it, but idk. If you can't find it through either of those methods download this. It's what I use for my PC. https://www.nzxt.com/camapp

In the game they do not show milliseconds.

If it was milliseconds it will be this Mint : Seconds . Milliseconds = 0:0.00

You should certainly do this with more operator icons. This is brilliant.

Some people have difficulty processing satire, esspecially the children of video game subs.
---
There is no limit, But!!! Keep in mind. The system works like this. For easy math let's say you have 5 people together. They then add all the ELO of those 5 players and then divide it by 5 to get an average. That is was you will play against
---
how did u get so many claymores?
---
Honestly, I don't like micro transactions but if you're looking for a skin that's worth it get the cobalt skin (Ruby and Emerald are seriously good ones too)
---
oh cool i'll probably check his songs out
---
As many others have said. Dont simply main one op. Be flexible.
---
That said however. In ranked Thatcher is the top 1 op to use when your teammates are already hardbreachers and you need to take care of bandits or mutes. With Buck you gotta rely on a nearby drone hole or a lucky lobb of a grenade. Or know the map well enough to be able to shoot the batteries/mutes from above or below. 
---
(On Consulate) there is a drone hole beside the garage door you can get charges from) with grenades for example.

The MPX is super good. One of the best SMGs in the game. Deagle isn't good enough to be used as a primary, it's good, but only really at close range
---
Weird how you haven't heard of one of the biggest rappers out but go on
---
I guess so
---
I dont see it

it does work if kaid has ears and enemy thatcher has 10 iq

These fuckers are trained to have that much toxin put into their body. Then they can just yeet it out and keep on going like nothing happened. Fuck that. I would either die or be MIA for like a week
---
Wait! Are Nick Fury and Capitão the same person?
---
That's just it, casual is meant to be a casual experience.  
---
The ability to leave a match is one of the few good things about casual compared to ranked.  That means I can team up with a friend immediately instead of one of us having to wait while the other finishes a match.  It also means I don't have to waste time on a map I don't like.  And that I don't have to quit because I'm not sure I have time to finish another full game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A better fix to the backfill issue would be to spread it more widely.  Have a check that prevents you from getting placed in consecutive matches in progress.  You would likely play a similar percentage of matches (although it might result in a few more for duos), but since it would be spread more evenly it wouldn't be as annoying.
---
I want to say "console aim" but at the same time I don't want to be mean
---
Put Murica on that hat and you got urself an ash
---
I'm more surprised that the Defuser has physics, looking at the way it tumbled down the hatch.
---
Well to some they didn't waste it, since they already bought everything in the game
---
AutoCAD cinema4d is better suited for modelling something photorealistic then autocad. He probably made the textured (materials) himself. Idk the last one
---
Then I'm afraid that just like me you are mostly subject to fortune's whims. Sometimes matchmaking puts you in games where your team is ace and enemy is dumb, some other times the exact opposite.
---
In my case I suck, actually. I got a lot of luck this season and made it to Plat 3 (Gold 2 now).
---
PC/PS4/Xbox?
---
Wait... Is that a gamer gRiLl?

Y’all ever just wanna sit on one of these

Why was the other version hypodermic needles but this one is just spikes?

Either way, they both look amazing.

If u want a pc that actually runs the game above like 8 frames then yeah. Smh console noob

I love the amount of detail on the turret

Don't know why, but this pic reminds me of little Keanu Reeves meme.

Of course I realize deranking is a thing, I just hate it. I'm trying to climb and some greedy bastard is going to take myself and 3 others down with him because he wants to go troll people in copper.

i would uninstall and cry myself to sleep if i was that bandit

I think that’s a lot more refined than what I was thinking and looks really good. I really like the look of the loud-out too.

Counters?

Hey, looks pretty good .. is this a legendary ?

Wait it’s not real?

I guess the chance is pretty low xD.
---
Ty for sharing :). 
---
Im curious tho, wich ranks were you guys? Cause i qued with 2 lower rank guys.
---
Looks cool.
---
Yes one of those... Good legendaries
---
Ah you're finally awake,  good.
---
Damn you complain a lot
---
I agree with this, his videos have helped me learn quite a few strats/angles
---
Yeah, that was a sad time. They did mess up some exotics on occasion, didn’t they? Like the SUROS Regime. When the game first started it was hands down the absolute best gun in the game. But then they nerfed it and it was just never the same. It just didn’t feel like an exotic anymore at all
---
Also just watching YouTubers/streamers in general can help.
---
They don’t have any other ops
---
I get chunky kid at the playground who needs a base in tag vibes from this
---
That’s when you know you play this game too much, amirite? 😂
---
Ty for the feedback
---
I guess we are low plats mostly. Been some rough games lately
---
console in a nutshell
---
If all their operators are selected they get recruit. Or if they left and join in as the timer is gone they will get recruit.
---
the title of this post :
---
#Am i a joke to you ?
---
Yah it is but apparently there is a way u can force the game to give u recruite
---
That is what happens when that player doesn't have any other operators to pick
---
i wonder how many times this is going to be posted
---

---
Thank you very much. She has a few counters. Iq can detect it, thatcher can disable the sound and the cloak for a few second. And it is Bullet prove like an evil eye. You need teamwork to destroy her gadget. An iq to locate and some one like zofia ash or sledge etc to destroy it.
---
don't read this calm down bro
---
Trojan horse operator coming out?? Who knows
---
It’s not, the engine isn’t optimized correctly so, even with a nada computer, you get shit frames
---
This is a game?!?! 😱
---
"Holy shoot you friking killed him dude"
---
Except you get all the base operators unlocked now so he should have someone to pick
---
I have a $600 pc and play r6 on like 110-130 fps at 1080p and with the same settings as Pengu.
---
This made me laugh so hard
---
They should .. all vanilla ops get unlocked when purchasing
---
Take it your new around here
---
and people call the siege community "toxic" smh
---
Yeah even cheaper if you buy used parts
---
This game was from 2 weeks ago i think ? Because that was the last time i qued with them :D.
---
Im not playing it that much lately. Like, maybe 3 games a week? :D
---
Not if he played r6 before that update happened it's possible to have a really old account to not have any operators
---
Put ur sens up lol
---
To me it feels like it’s become ranked without the rank. I get flamed for not using the meta operators all the time. I play casual to play around with other operators that I don’t get to use all the time in ranked.
---
Or she could grow thick skin, shut the wankers up with smart banter, and learn that she doesn’t need a movement to determine how far she gets in life.
---
Then it’s an audio bug because you missed
---
That one is almost as cool as the toy smart skin. I love that one...
---
if I'm doing the best on my team and they start a vote kick, I'll just leave because its just not worth it even if you don't get kicked
---
Oooo gotem
---
I kaid tricked the same spot on chalet high gold early this season and the enemy thatcher got tked. Fucking lol.
---
Yeah I'm the only one of my friends on pc, but I miss being able to play all the ops, as well as my elite skins that I bought on xbox
---
A true gamer.
---
Wario
---
Lol, the big brother of the Chameleon skin?
---
Yeah it’s really shitty they should have that be a cross platform thing. That’s just another way Ubisoft drains money out of us poor gamers
---
I want this charm
---
Imagine being that flexible...
---
i always try this but I can never do it
---
The one that makes it look like a toy gun? It's bright orange and green.
---
It sometimes depends on the server. I play in South Brazil and feels like Chernobyl.

Always wondered how these worked.... So they spin a high speed drill and it explodes to create the hole?

Hello meet_uzumaki, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cn90gp/new_gamemode/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I thought Rook was a fat woman.
---
Nice ace
---
Imagine that going in your leg
---
My guess is that it works like a proximity mine and shoots one in all directions, so the operator gets hit with one of them.
---
You are either insanely unlucky or can't win a game
---
Ubisoft: "You werent supposed to do that!"
---
My first ace was 1 retarded round with blitz
---
They are propably summoning day 1 blackbeard...

No, a human

His name as well...
---
Or cover it with a wet paper towel and place in microwave. Risk getting the paper towel stuck to the food though :/
---
she's probably one of, if not the most balanced defender. her loadout is very good (the aa12 is a fucking meme so idk) and her holograms are powerful. ubi can't allow her holograms to mirror your loadout due to engine limitations
---
I feel ya. I usually play with a friend so we can laugh off incidents of people being pointedly unfriendly but he's been out awhile so I've just been solo queuing till he's back. It's been nice.  
---
I made a a confusing call-out and apologized and everyone was cool about it.  
---
Another time, I lost a 1v2 and someone asked what attachments I was using and I was thinking, "Oh, he's going to be super critical," and that didn't happen. He literally just wanted to know and we discussed attachment options for the gun. It kinda blew my mind.
---
Just showing off the 4k lmao
---
Best way to do it buddy! Gotta do some experimenting with ops. I'm at a point where I actually enjoy using about 90% of them!
---
I see, I just think telling people to solo que is the worst advice you could give, but that's just imo
---
Yeah, well at least I don't rush towards a Rook when I could shoot him from afar.
---
Absolutely styled on
---
Yeah im struggling to get my gf off too.. wont cum to her senses
---
Well that's how I went up. Maybe just me then
---
You are totally right! I am a very aggressive player normally, but I know when to change roles and fill in as support. I really enjoy the teamwork and coordination Siege entails — so I’ll never shy away from playing support. 
---
What is your platform?
---
At copper four I highly doubt that
---
You can tell this is the real deal because your team tried to kick you
---
Even at the shittiest rank, I do have some amount of chromosomes to not do the dumbest shit.
---
*Like this*
---
I've grown to absolutely love aggressive defending. I don't spawn peak but force attackers to play a hand most of the time!
---
I'm PS4 too, ID is the same as my user on here, feel free to add me if you wanna play sometime!
---
made a perfect lock screen, thank you.
---
Still hope you can reload two shots at once instead of one by one.
---
He got 420 renown
---
What you think you can do and what you actually do inside of a game is completely different,they were in a 1v5 and thought it was gonna be an easy win
---
I have been a roamer for as long as I remember. Ironically, I used Frost alot as well. (Ela, Frost, and Ash being my top 3 operators.) And used to roam with her. I simply enjoy having the element of surprise on the attackers! That and it’s so useful to divert their attention on you. You make them waste time and they try rushing to site in the last 20 seconds or so. 
---
I will add you right now! We can definitely play sometime.
---
The best would be to grab a team and play in a queue. Solo queue a lot of the time is a gamble. Although, if you truly belong in gold 2, you would not be stuck in copper I, you can just get unlucky in solo queue. Another indication that your skill range is \*Probably\* below gold 2 is the fact that you are bottom fragging in copper. You might have top fragged but that's only placements and placements are a small portion of your overall games. You can definitely put some blame on your teammates but not all.
---
In the end, just either stick it out until you can top frag and get out of copper, or just queue up with friends. Playing with friends makes it MUCH easier to get to a reasonable elo.
---
What in holy hell is that
---
Yea, that's an issue I have too (from Plat down to Gold). I think the players in elos lower than you were can often surprise you with the nonsense they decide to do. My best advice is to not underestimate them.
---
The sound in the game is fucked either way...
---
Or Area 51
---
Okay I'll admit the peak was fucking dumb but if you expect me to use the proper your on Reddit your asking too much
---
Kaid tricking is better cuz you just need to listen for it instead of also listening which wall
---
Ooh
---
I have had a 56 minute wait
---
Exactly, it's all about running that clock down! If you can't pick off an enemy or two, do your best to waste their time and play objective B)
---
I may be on PUBG this evening but if I'm about I'll send you an invite for sure!
---
Like engine limits?
---
I would consider that Maestro's 4K
---
Looks amazing to me
---
Slow down speed racer let's buff defenders that actually need it first
---
“Errr all guns are the same”
---
back in my day this was NORMAL. Like good even, fuck I remember installing an entire OS once before finding a match. You kids these days have it so easy with your 1-3 minute match times.
---
I wanted to ask if you could consider ever making a model 3 design. I've been trying to find something and to my surprise, nothing. I saw your other concepts and fell in love with your style and wanted to see if you could do something similar with Tesla's. Your work is amazing!
---
I'm just trash at siege
---
I did have my eyes closed
---
At least they’re not boosting
---
I like this one more that the last one xD the last one was shitty af.
---
This idea is cool. And I still like the icon.
---
Car modeling is a bit beyond my skillset currently but I find it hard to believe there’s no Model 3 models available somewhere online ?
---
The one they made you buy in this season. This game cycles characters and has a trend of OP first drop characters.
---
BTW an mp on attack is shitty af
---
No free ops, u gotta spend some cash or grind like me :]
---
YYeah, sadly
---
Hey mine was the same way. When siege was on sale for 12$ deluxe I bought a new account to play with her. Last night we played together in newcomer play list for like 3 hours while she was learning the game. It was super fun.
---
One of the cooler things I’ve seen in this subreddit
---
Yeah you were playing with guys who are Q up together and they kicked you, dude probably didn't want the wall reinforced but instead of him saying it in voice chat he just did a dick move, happens to me sometimes
---
Yeah this is big brain time
---
I bought the base game last season and I had to unlock all my operators but IDK if that has changed.
---
After you finish a game you get "renown" which is the yellow currency. With that, go to the operators tab, click on the ctu and you'll seedifferent operators. I recommend watching a youtube video on who to unlock first but id you just wanna yolo then feel free
---
Im thinking giving him an new gun, the HK416 auto,  what do you think?
---
The lord is, and will always be the best op
---
Warden tho 😂

Nice job

So because y'all rage quit other people shouldn't be allowed to see stats?

Hello GunserkerMarcia, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cnb8l7/recruits_state/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
My understanding is that each pellet uses a small payload of thermite to weaken the wall section they’re attached to before detonating a high explosive charge to clear that section of wall
---
Ok, thanks. I was really confused.
---
You were probably playing against a 4-stack. Happened to me once for no reason
---
Isn't that the carbine that Jäger has? I like it
---
You and your friends are the problem. And you don't know if the enemy is having a bad day or you get some good timing it etc. Rainbow is as much about luck as skill. But yeah, you shouldn't use it or just stop playing competitively outright if this is how you handle it.
---
I thought it was a pan party until I read the comment.
---
No ok so when u look for rank, before the match starts u r in a lobby, with the app I can see everyone’s rank and if the other team is good then they leave
---
Yeah Lion was ridiculously OP at release it took him a year to be nerfed to how he is now, With Ela it took 6 months for her to be nerfed.

Alright, what about a Glock 19 for the handgun?

Done. Thanks

Shouldn't be an issue, I can make em ready as long as it's obj. But it's alright if you don't wanna share :p
---
What?
---
Did they win?
---
This happens every time I clutch
---
are you able to crop it?
---
Agreed. I do hope that Ubisoft considers a player commendation system similar to Overwatch. Imagine if getting a commendation for "Good Teammate" or "Good Callouts" gave out a tiny bit of renown. I think we would see good results.
---
Amen

---
you're using re-used guns and are the first person to do with a concept, At least you know there possibly may never be new guns again.
---
is this supposed to be like tear gas?
---
and the FMG-9 is shit on an attacker
---
Thats the first time I've ever seen someone use the ACS-12 in a ranked match
---

Practice, practice, practice. I have 100's of T-hunts played, I may not be perfect but it helps me keep in practice to hit shots more accurately, and to retrain myself for headshots. Sometimes I get frustrated too, I understand. Find a comfortable sens and just get comfortable with it. My sens is probably too high for what I should be using, but I like to be able to whip around on enemies now that I can actually hear them with a new headset. Controllers that don't feel gunky also help

Echo is hands down better, there is a reason he is banned almost every game (i feel a large part because no one wants to play iq). But that's also why you should pick Mozzie. Echo is rarely left available so you'll end up wasting renown versus I have never seen Mozzie banned, and his ability is still very powerful. More powerful than mute's actually when it comes to drones because they can't jump through the spider vs the jammer they can. TLDR get mozzie cause echo is always banned
---
If I crop it it’s gonna take stuff out so I was thinking maybe you could just like elongate it or something
---
On pc or consoles?
---
On pc
---
I can't agree with that. Secure and hostage are both unbalanced, I can maybe understand enjoying secure sometimes. But hostage? Nah.
---
This game is a competitive game, what's the point of playing in a gamemode filled with bad maps, modes, and toxicity?
---
I actually find Ela's shotgun impossible to control on PC, it jumps so high with each shot I cant get it smooth.
---
I think that the reason why the recoil on the smg11 seems better on PC is because people *can* learn to control it.
---
The average PC player can't even begin to use it, but it's possible with enough pratice.
---
I think that guns are easier to pick up on console due to the inital lower recoil, but you can't master the control to the same degree.
---
This is purely based off observation by the way, tell me if I'm wrong.
---
What are you current settings? Hoe big is yoir current mousepad? Are you a wrist or arm aimer.
---
Because it's fun
---
I mean it coule be cool if on the other side it was invisible and camouflage into the wall behind it
---
[deleted]
---
That’s fair lol
---
Idk what I'm looking at: daughter? girlfriend? random female playing that likes PC shooters?
---
Ranked is fun

Too sweaty in my opinion

How big would it be exactly? Would it be the same as a black mirror?

It's a good thing you killed them all since your teammate with the defuser was doing nothing at all
---
You can unlock them all
---
Try the shotgun is OP!
---
Oh yo, you lead me to something. Maybe it could be like an X-ray cam, so it doesn’t drill into the wall. You would be able to hear it on the defend side
---
I don’t think so
---
Idk cause I've played alot of both platforms, and I may be wrong but it really feels like the recoul is different. It could just be graphical differences tho, such as fov.
---
I’ve got a carbon fibre hockey stick so maybe stay back with that metal chinesium bullshit you got there huh? 
---
Like yeah homing missiles with quad force enriched uranium with tetrahydrofluride control rods are like kinda overplayed right now bro, like ngl it’s got power but it really ain’t a match for my   Default bot with mega ton bollocks attached.
---
Just sayin bro..
---
Ya the would be cool
---
So you also can buy any operators from the updates?
---
This post actually got me to 420 karma
---
Not as big as hers, and it would be a circular design. So take a submarine window size
---
The only reason she isn't more popular is because of the current 'strat' meta. You simply cannot afford to have a pure fragger on defense these days, except on a few niche maps (or if you have a players that's just insane).
---
Even beaulo will pick a bandit/jager over a vigil/alibi, simply because the utility they provide is so important.
---
On attack you can generally afford a pure fragger, but even then I play maverick/hibana/capitao more than Ash these days.
---
Literally the joke. Lol its an m3
---
Ya boy Roy is good and The doo is funny too
---
So jealous. I couldn't get my wife to game if my life depended on it.

Bruh

Yup!
---
Look at my name, I've been shadow banned from this sub, TWICE.
---
They (Mods) don't really need or wait for a reason. Obviously any attempts of asking for a reason fell on deaf ears, even in the r6 Discord.
---
So yeah, they wanna silence me, perhaps this time they'll actually do a proper ban with a REASON.
---
Not to be harsh or break the mood, but I only see two things here that are related to Hibana:
---
1. The Japanese flag
---
2. Her name in the title
---
What counts as a cosplay at this point, seriously?
---
P.S. The comments baffle me.
---
Queue up with at least 1 friend and it will help significantly
---
The problem with clash is that, if the Clash player is really good, she is super easy to counter if you have the correct ops and nearly impossible to counter if you don’t

Says no kids... can't even spell season correctly...
---
Wut
---
Technically you can. But it will take a very long time. Unless you know exactly what operators you’ll like. Even then it will take some time.
---
People who do this need to commit die
---
No screen shake options, it sounds like good recoil control but it would be better if you could drop a few links.
---
Currently the worst defenders are ones that suffer from inherently poor design (such as tachanka, where he will simply never be viable), ones that are just outdone by other operators (lesion is literally just a better kapkan since he can get more intel), or ones that will never be balanced (frost is too binary, if her gadgets work she is OP, if they don't she is useless).
---
Was it the one with buck?
---
Why post this twice? And an hour apart?
---
Maybe they have them again this year

Thats sick

what is your set up like. are you running siege off the imac or are you some how using it as a monitor? i notice that it has windows on it in that pic
---
I actually packed my pc up to go away for a few weeks so I can't get the exact settings currently. I can go grab my mousepad and measure it, and I currently use wrist but want to switch to arm once I start using a bigger desk.

Rip they already did

I'll try that Tomorrow when I get the chance, thanks for the reply.

People will just say "JUST DONT DO THEM HURRR DURR"

The challenges are awfully designed. You have to play in a way that isn't organic in order to complete them. Shotguns are awful and are only used normally to create holes, not to kill people. Getting kills with melee or gadgets makes you pick shields or fuze. The challenges are just infuriating. I downed someone with fuzes cluster charge and someone finished them off.
---
lol... "I've been banned twice, it's a conspiracy not my fault!" 
---
what possible gain is there for them banning random innocent people?
---
The difference between 8 and 8.3 on a 100 point scale using the same DPI won’t really mess you up. Maybe the first few flicks will be off but your body will get used to and correct fairly quick. I’d recommend just setting it to 8 and run a few terrorist hunt missions to get the feel for it. Then if you want to raise or lower from the you can.
---
How tf u get up there
---
Yeah, he's great :D
---
How/where did you get the straps?
---
When you start reloading it doesn't untoggle your ADS, so it'll go back once the animation is complete.
---
Don't play with toggle ADS though, it slows down your ability to aim and react.
---
If you're having hand pains then you should get a larger mouse and/or lower your senstivity, you shouldn't be having hand cramps.
---
It wasn’t so I could play against lower level people. My friends insisted on playing ranked on my main account, so I wanted an account to use on my own without my friends.

Ela's shotgun is nowhere near overpowered. Just very sophisticated. It does a max of 38 damage and is very good for close range. It also has a nice fire rate making CQC the place where Ela is usually finding herself as she's an aggressive operator who needs to be mobile will usually be. But going past 10 meters that 38 damage heavily drops off and the damage becomes how you'd expect an unslugged shotgun to work. Also at that range the recoil which already is a bit high becomes too high to just spam fire, less damage less frequently. It does wonders the Origin 12 or FO-12 known in game at close range. But going past mid range it heavily drops off. If you think it has range that's wrong the M950 and every slugged shotgun have much much more damage per pellet at farther ranges. The SAGIA to be fair is much better than the FO-12 as it has a better fire rate just more recoil. It also does more damage. Giving it even a better edge at close range. The FO-12 does shine above the others due to its controllability but it is nowhere near overpowered. If it was to be nerfed it'd make Ela completely useless. Her scorpion is already the worst primary in game due to it being the only primary with random stats. Her pistol is very under average, her secondary gadgets are completely useless to her in the jobs she does as she's a mobile and aggressive operator but given stationary gadgets. Her mines are also very lackluster, but that's pretty much every gadget. if her shotgun was nerfed she'd be the worst defender or even the worst defender by a long shot. None of her kit plays off another part of it unlike every other operator. She's very limited her roles and the roles she can play she's out classed most of the time by her fellow defenders. Nerfing her shotgun would make her already 8 nerfs even worse. With pretty much 0 buffs as the vertical recoil buff was heavily negated by the random horizontal recoil, nerfing Ela's shotgun would completely make her pointless to the team and the game.
---
You have 8gig of ram? 
---
That's going to be a problem, siege can utilise 9-10gigs for me some times.
---
But what does uPlay actually say between PVP and PVE times. That time includes all loading screens and main menu time.
---
You can push it outside of the planting area (resulting in attck losing the round) using alibis prism or smokes beauties
---
Literally no one
---
No, the stretch is the whole point of the aspect ratio.
---
r/R6STeams. You can find a squad there so you don’t have to suffer from solo queue.
---
sorry we don’t say “LMAO” here
---
Huh
---
Are you actually complaining about 30-40 ping?
---
New zealand doesn't even have uplay servers, all trafic is routed to sydney; meaning 40 ping is standard.
---
A ping of 40 is not getting you killed, you're just delusional.
---
Fellow echo main! Nice clutch
---
Restart it dipshit
---
Brooo why do PC player throw the c4 so far?
---
Just be glad I didn’t use an emoji.
---
Happened to me today. I went 14-4 and lost 4-2, I just can't clutch. Getting down to a 1v1 is ez but I always fail the 1v1
---
The imperfections on the metal make it look more real, good job!
---
I just wish they would change the likelihoods of getting rares and such.
---
Cannot remember the last time I got something that wasn't common (and usually a duplicate)
---
Does it go invisible
---
I only have it for Glaz but that’s perfectly fine with me. At least it was but now he’s unplayable lol
---
What happened? IQ saves you from ruining that round. The smoke didn't help your team at all, and you didn't block Bandit even slightly.
---
Worth
---
I did not know what mnk meant. You could easily make it to diamond with a mnk by your self,
---
I call this tactic the rotation wall
---
So you're smart enough to know about something you admit to knowing nothing about?
---
Electrons/photons can only travel so fast, and the travel medium (either copper or fibre-optic) really doesn't make much of a difference.
---
The only way you can lower your ping at this point is to either:
---
A.) Move closer to your nearest exchange.
---
B.) Ask ubisoft to put uplay servers closer to your house.
---
A ping of 30-40 is completely standard regardless, you can't expect to literally have LAN levels of low latency when you're playing with people all across your country.
---
Frankly you are incredibly entitled and fail to realise the insane amounts of development that has been put into making modern connection times as good as they are.
---
Just enjoy what you have any stop complaining.

That list you made of what you’re good at is a lie lol, that list is a diamond player, you’re bronze so likely don’t tick any of those boxes, just practice and actually get good at all the stuff on that list am you’ll be plat in no time

No problem, it just helps the system divert all the internet and processing power into installing that, instead of audio, rendering, controls, ect

Stand inside that as a vanilla alibi haha

Ive never heard someone complain about loading screen times being calculated in play time. That is some gatekeeping right there.
---
I think she acts as a better learning operator rather than a main, shes taught me how to flank better, aim better, and flash better to maximize the use of her gadget and sub-par weapon (fmg-9)

Still learning the D-50 tho, damn thing is unwieldy but I will tame it

Can I step on it please so it gets propelled into my ankle where I then have to yank it out
---
I have several questions
---
Are you going for the achievement? Mute on plane, take the front room. Reinforce as much as you can first round. Should have darn near every wall reinforced by the second, mutes up on each wall and they can only come in one door.
---
Cubemaps.
---
Got that the other day too. Guess what a got
---
A common duplicate

yep! thanks again! i'll owe you a match :)

Don’t mind me, just scrolling to the bottom to see all the cringy neckbeards

Wait why can't I see the gu mine?

you're not on ps4?? daaaaaamn

Plot twist: Tachanka is jewish
---
Ya pretty nice.
---
And that’s why I sit in blue and just wait for someone like you
---
I reinforced kids bedroom, your turn
---
Yeah its nothing wrong with the strat, the enemy team just sucks ass
---
&gt;If it's just good recoil controll, than I have much to learn.

You have much to learn.

Now where is the hostage :)

Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.

I was going to say that that's out of character for the game,  but then remembered we have a pink leopard costume...

I have 2000+ hours...still trash...help

That’s a clean ass mirror

So you made a comment that makes you sound like a 12 year old that just discovered sarcasm and now wants to use it in every conversation he has.

Yeah, you just have to lost 49 casual games or 40 ranked games in a row. My highest percentage is 71%

Still bettet then lesion's

Funny enough this account was banned 4 days ago. But for separate reasons.
---
i got interrogated the last defending round thats why
---
Glaz someone said it.
---
*sigh* unzips
---
It's only an ace if you kill 5 opponents and yourself simultaneously
---
I made this as an easy cosplay to go along with a group that had pool party operators as well. Ex. Rook was wearing a life jacket, blitz had a shield made of pool noodles, everybody in beach gear. That is all. They're kind of joke cosplays that no one seems to understand unfortunately.
---
If the defuser stops working when you make it fall, why can't we just hold the defuser and yeet it out

You shot to her right first then only hit here with one or two bullets the second spray
