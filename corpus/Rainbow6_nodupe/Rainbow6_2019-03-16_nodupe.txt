All these meme videos are the same with meme music played over someone getting kills while it plays sounds from other games I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs so popular

New Hibana is a change much needed, I was shocked when it popped up in the patch notes! looks amazing.
---
Broke ass
---
I was 1 match away from silver and I got 2 games in a row with these ass holes in them. Just play the fucking game!
---
Yeah I tried the LMG on the test sever and it was good and the scope is good as well
---
The weapon skins made specifically for that gun are just not worth it my opinion. Just use a universal or seasonal skin.

You guys are no fun

Mozzie is great, especially when twitching twitch, but maestro is a great anchor. It really can be down to intel vs defense, which you‚Äôd prefer

I played the yugioh mobile game and they just drop you to the next tier down every season. That way if you leave for a while you'll have to work your way up. But people in silver dont get stuck against plat and diamond players during placement matches every season. It wouldn't be perfect because they just start you off at the lowest rank and it's not a team based game but still having to redo your placements every season is just dumb.
---
Both are good but I just fell in love with the F90, its also very efective opening barricades

It's "mostly" working. I had so much problems for years with that, mostly fixes itself before new weekly challanges. Probably they can't track all of the community's challanges at once. If you miss a special challange because of that you can ask to support btw, they are helping as i heard.
---
Callouts are also very important. Be precise with your callouts if you're going to give them. (Ex: Mira red stairs 25 hp). Dont flood mics with random shit. 
---
Doing that could very likely break all the skins you have unlocked for it.
---
Still a better approach than "Is tHaT a GrIlL gAmER? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
---
Odd, are you running chrome
---
yes and it usually ends with me getting my toes shot off one by one (on that exact f\*cking obj too)
---
when I play alibi I play with keratos only because this shit has more damage than BLACKS DMR, and using it like taptaptaptaptaptaptap reload is insane. BB's shield is one tap and his head is one too, but why would you click the head if your damage is 73/78 per shot( i don't remember exact number lul)
---
I started enjoy doing this kind of stuff and wanted to do some more but had no idea for next interiors etc. so I started project where I make rooms inspired by SIEGE operators, taking some stuff from their bio and adding something from myself
---
It was literally just you guys saying "they have a hacker" so idk
---
I would prefer to see them at dmrs because its seems like a 8x scope. LMGs needs something different and special to their class.

I think Whitehall looks the best with her guns. Also fits with her no nonsense commander persona.

Please explain to me how an attacker killed Valkyrie during drone phase then.

I think it's still in prep phase lol, that's why it's obvious hacking

Yeah. DEVGRU is so similar I omitted them as I wasn't sure how familiar you might be with them. Not everyone is an armchair general!

Holy fuck you people are the worst. Can't you just enjoy the game without shitty memes and fan art?

I'll survive,  but to say I wasn't very disappointed would be an understatement.   This was all after Burnt Horizon had been released too.  So seeing all this new cool legendary stuff is a bit of a punch in the gut when I compare it to what I ended up with.

I just want to let you know jackal is the most underrated operator in the game. Maybe you may want to take a look at him.

It's the second best pistol in the game right? Its  obviously better than the other secondary but that's only brought for breaching on Maestro usually

Jackal is such a little fucking bitch. Stop following me you whore.

certain guns do more damage than others. the shield isn't based on bullets taken, it has a hitbox and health points and when it gets to 0 health, it breaks.

Yeah, because the is unplayable without that feature!

Wouldn't be as bad if they didn't ruin the Halloween headgear.

The addition of more emojis does not add any emphasis. One is enough we get it, any more makes you seem really juvenile, or ironic.  It might sound conceited but personally I ask, what point do emojis serve? They don't really convey anything words don't and if you say Lmao, the laughing emoji isn't really needed because you get he thinks it's funny due to context. Im not some old man btw im 19. I just dislike emojis. 
---
It's ok I don't wanna talk to them anyways
---
I think that Fluff flair just got a little bigger.
---
i'll go post it there I guess
---
I was in same boat as you bud, i say you practice and coordinate with your teammates in realistic terrorist hunt often. Thats how me and my team got into plat
---
I don‚Äôt think so, it depends on what your getting shot with, (smg, pistol) and what distance your being shot from. I have never seen any notion of a spot on his shield being weaker than another.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to them Zoro, Doge = Best legendary 
---
The shield has 50 hp, so 2 shots from almost every defender weapon will destroy it, depending on the range. AFAIK all parts of the shield take equal damage.
---
In no feasible circumstance will the shield be able to take 5+ shots. Maybe if you're shooting it with Ela's Scorpion at max range and through a wall. But in 99% of engagements scenarios it's going down in 2-3 hits.
---
Go ahead
---
Hmm never heard of that, will definitely try it out. Thanks for the advice!

I feel like defusing it right in their face is pretty dominant too

I am with this 100%. Played on and off since launch, really got into siege since chimera. I‚Äôve also noticed sound bugs where you can‚Äôt hear people behind you, and I mean loud 3 speeds sometimes. And suppressors making no gun sound what so ever.

Gridlock seems the strongest and most fun

Lion is ok but will probably get nerfed next patch and is cancer for the ennemy team.

Finka is weird because she boosts the team but it makes so much noise you can't hear anything.
---
Thanks for the constructive criticism!
---
How do you download the season pass? 
---
get a fuze and a lion. fuze OBJ while lion enables tracking and then pick off those who avoid the fuze

Finka if you rush Gridlock if you play slow and cautious

Well I hope for you that Ubi won't address the toxicity cause you would be the first banned

I‚Äôll agree that vote kick is more of a detriment at this point, but teamkill raises the skill level at higher ranks. You have to be cautious of your teammates so you don‚Äôt kill them, which makes for more methodical gameplay. Maybe reduced team damage for casual?
---
they fixed this in the new update pretty sure

Lol yes my life is sad but not to the point where I come crying on Reddit to feel better. Ahaha

Yeah I was top of the leaderboard and carrying us 2-0 and my teammates thank me by surrendering.

To add on to what 540Kicks said, there's also an Uncertainty value in the MMR system - I'm not exactly sure on how it works or if Ubi has even released the specifics about the Uncertainty system but to my knowledge the more you lose and the more you win the higher your uncertainty value is, thus when you stagnate in one rank around the same Elo (MMR points) via winning a game or two then losing and going back to your original rank, the lower your Uncertainty value will be and the more certain the MMR system will be about where you belong in the ranks. Basically the more you return to a specific rank the more certain the MMR system will be. 
---
TL;DR   "Ranked" „ÄãBeta„Ää has an MMR system, win and it gives you elo, lose and it takes elo away. The more you return to one rank the less elo you will gain or lose due to the Uncertainty/Certainty factor represented by a ¬±
---
Um not to me
---
Why would anyone do it?
---
He‚Äôs an intel op, people will learn to counter him like they did with frost and Kapkan. I already have people in ranked being more careful with drones, and it being the point where I have to go to them to tag drones 
---
What??? If you're talking about the one I think you're talking about then never reinforce that wall. From the stairs you can see the window vault to cover the OBJ. Then the window vault has to worry about workshop AND stairs.
---
They are all pretty good ops. Buck has a lot of recoil tho, and always use long on capito, para is asking for death
---
Most operators are balanced, so yea, they‚Äôre good
---
Well, yeah, but it works good enough right?
---
OMFG IS DAT RELLY BWAHNANA BWEROLL OOO YESSS BROOOOOOOOO!

FWIW I haven‚Äôt seen it and found it hilarious. Thank you

I know many white people and europeans named "Yumiko Imagawa".

I hope the next American op is from the Space Force.
---
You have to really fuck it up now for it to happen, they've definitely fixed it for the most part
---
I also forgot to mention that my region is eus. It had always been eus before burnt horizon, so it‚Äôs either Ubi recommending me somewhere else, or the servers itself are trash.

Hereford
---
A cool charm depending on your rank
---
I completely agree
---
Thanks

Well it‚Äôs less lethal (a bit higher damage but a lot slower firerate) but more useful otherwise

Why do you want ACOGs removed, what is the reasoning.

It's based off how long you were actively playing during the round.

Early Siege decisions were kinda weird in regards to points lol.

Do you want a link to the archive? This is in the source.

They will literally never do any of this because they want you to buy more Alpha Packs.

It would be nice to have, sure, but it will not happen.

What happens if we use 100% of our brains?
---
#*Fuking drinks that too*
---
Which is want I highlighted in the beginning 
---
Yea, that's a gud one. But, there is something similar already. 
---
What I would ask them to do is, if both pellets are a little distant, same as the gap shown in above image, and if the pellets are blown simultaneously, then the gap should also be blown up. But, the gap can remain if the pellets were individually activated.
---
That's what I think of a buff to her.

Nah, they are joining quickly. 
---
As if someone is reading a fairy tale.
---
I can not get in a match at all

10000000000000000000
---
What would even be the harm in them doing something like this thought. Alpha Packs have no monetary value so they would lose anything.
---
Good idea but think of the trolls spamming every operator so it‚Äôs useless 
---
Pretty sure this posted once every couple of days

Yeah I see what you mean but I don't agree with the large amount of US operators, I would much rather have a wide variety of national CTUs

What's the point in that? You get half the renown / R6 credits from operators and then you're gonna buy what a cosmetic? You have this character you can play in game and adds gameplay value. Why refund that?
---
Data center says cus so I'm assuming Central United States. I figured somebody would be playing T-hunt on pc..
---
I would say frost, mute, and valk in that order.
---
"I have 6 kills, you guys are NOT helping!!!!! Idiot team!"
---
-guy who has died within literally 20 sec of every round. 
---
I dont own frost. But what do you think a smoke elite skin should look like 
---
**TCSG-12 + SCOPE = OP?**
---
Look it's a gnome
---
And you've been gnomed
---
It'll probably be him doing something with his gas cansister
---
I only have 1 elite skin and that is Frost - it‚Äôs amazing. 
---
If you don't wont to commit to a defense elite I'd say buy some operators with the r6 credit.
---
I dont have frost, although the welcome mat looks badass
---
Castle deserves an Elite skin! 
---
I personally like Mute or Rook, there pretty cool. 
---
TOLD
---
Yours is a lot more to scale than mine was lol
---
Kinda
---
I have this problem with a-symmetry, I must split my time equally on all ops that i love, so buying new operator is a torture at the beginning and of I have an elite skin on attack and not on defense i will go crazy
---
New upcoming Japanese operator: "You know I used to be a CTU operator like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee..."
---
Hibana: "Just who is shooting arrows these days üòÖ"
---
You're dating your hand? How does that work?
---
Mute and Maestro both have very different play styles, you can play Maestro like you play Echo, and Mute can when in good hands, act like Bandit. It‚Äôs mostly the playstyle you prefer, and who said you can‚Äôt use both depending on the situation and map?
---
Literally lol
---
I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for those meddling GUs.
---
I dont play him a lot but I admire people who do
---
I‚Äôm really confused here because your flair says ‚ÄúMira Main‚Äù but you say you‚Äôre a maestro main? hmmm
---
That's right. Just watch the videos on youtube and try out the strats in casual. 
---
Everyone pings Tachanka because they think they are funny.
---
Care to show your rank?
---
How bad is the recoil on his LMG?
---
This was a awhile ago, I‚Äôm only Gold IV now lol
---
Please that sounds good (no more sneaky cavs hiding in the dark)
---
Not that bad if you fire in Burst, even in full auto it‚Äôs pretty good
---
Alright thanks man. This is lots of help. 
---
This is patched now 
---
Oh sorry not a rework I will change the title
---
Would you recommend him for a below average character?
---
If you‚Äôre in a squad yes
---
Ur probs like silver IV
---
There‚Äôs already so little ops on defense with acogs and now you wanna make it even less
---
Just remove guns, boom no more op guns
---
Get the outside cams first so someone spawn peaking doesnt know which side the enemy spawned on 
---
Got 'em. You probably would get more help tho...
---
Then the next part should he gets headshotted from a camping rook who can see through the wall 
---
I can rarely get on with my friends 8/10 time I‚Äôll be solo queuing. Is he good for solo queue.
---
Cool idea, unless the person doing the pinging was just hot-picking the same attacker and defender every time regardless of situation because it's their 'main'!
---
I usually don't get angry at Siege but that would've pissed me off, definitely a time where I'd go get a drink of water then come back.
---
Would server side not be the same for everyone, as opposed to client side being specific to each player. I haven't read into it just guessing here, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Yes but when they‚Äôre at 200 ping it‚Äôs not just plat players
---
Hello official_niek, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b1rjqs/literally_unplayable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
idk, I've always been for higher damage guns rather than higher fire rate. Also I think one youtuber called it good and he's the guy that makes those silly like "best weapon" videos. Some character do have objectively better guns but Mozzie is definitely not one of those.
---
Dude, sah
---
then why the Tachanka main flair lul
---
you are correct. 
---
Tbh you should get punished for shooting the team drones like -10 points or something like that because it‚Äôs a pain even in gold ranked
---

I'm surprised I haven't seen the usual "yOur TeaM avErage rANK was way HIGHeR THaN THe EnemY'S" I thought I had shit luck getting 13mmr for winning a 4v5 round 9 game....
---
I‚Äôm not a virgin, my hand has been doing a great job for years now 
---
Nice, pixel art, like tho s style and hope of more
---
Oh Ok then
---
what about concussion and flashbangs?
---
Dumb.
---
Damn, this scares me I hope they detect that I immediately left and even tried to votekick.
---
This is the best elite skin idea i've ever seen, great job, i really hope this is gonna be the e.skin
---
I peaked when I got an ace with an M870 recruit on favela, my second and last ever ace
---
Right !? People already paid for it they should be able to do what they want to the stuff.  I  do believe there was a glitch also during the first week they added the pick and ban playlist for these past invitationals . Operators were doing the elite animations even if you were wearing other uniforms. So definitely easy to do.  
---
Mira:"You know you jinx'd and they are bringing a Twitch now right?"
---
Teammate:"Nah it's fine they won't even expect it.
---
Mira:"Alright if I see a cam get popped I'm popping your shit."

*Cam pops*
---
This is a commonly occuring problem with the burnt horizon build, but alo not uncommon in general in gaming.  if it does this for other games, there may be a fix. if not, then just wait it out and install the patches
---
Quick question: I‚Äôve been playing this game for years now and used to play ranked when my mate was playing. But now that he isn‚Äôt, is it worth solo queuing in ranked or should I stick to casual?
---
Drone and camera. Intel is key. Good headset. And if you play with mic callouts is essential.
---
This is, by far, the best startup screen with RAINBOWSIX SIEGE tagged on it. Nicely!
---
I don't think they're gonna care. My friends didn't even know when or whom they got squadded up with to cause the ban.
---
Or maybe like Sofia you can press B to change rate of fire. Then you can fire two at once which stick together.
---
Your team had a hacker. So everyone's mmr rolled back at that match.
---
Hmmmm four year competitive beta sure.
---
Hm 
---
Hahahaha happens to the best of us
---
Ive just given up on ranked. This year i aint playing ranked since Im a casual player and got silver I last year and everytime i went to play casual i would be playing against plats. I kust dont want that this time 
---
M870 is loud as an elephant. I need someone to show my dogs what its like to be woken up at strange hours...M870 should do the trick.

---
caveria low key looks like pennywise
---
She looks high or something 
---
depends. if you are a fragger then i would opt for maverick, but if you go for executes then go for dokaebbi
---
Yep. I hate what he/she does. I do fan arts and there are amazing fan artists out there. We use watermark too and our effor is much more than datamining. Like i'm working on a Mozzie pointillism art and mozzie's t-shirt took me 6 hours to make. Just the t-shirt. But i'm not gonna cover the whole picture with watermark bc it destroys what u're trying to show. Doesn't matter what it is. In this case it's a leak but come on. Put it on the side or something. 
---
Yeah, I generally think leaks suck. They don't make the content/changes/whatever it is come any sooner and they often ruin any hype around the content as people get to know about it so early that hype dies down by the time the content is released.  
---
In addition, it also baits people into getting higher expectations than they should when a leak only gives partial information and people start speculating, often starting rumours that's spread as truth that then needs to be corrected every time it's brought up when the rumours end up being false.
---
It's what everyone says when they lose lmao
---
Goddamn these birthday skins really suck
---
Doc would still have a place. Rook May be affected, but just buff his gadget a little then. Gadget should always take precedent, not the weapons. There are some easy buffs that they could give to Rook to make the gadget better. 
---
On another note, Kaid should get an ACOG on the AUGA3
---
Hello jeekoxd, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b1s76g/head_glitching_is_a_real_issue_in_this_gamehow_am/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Yup 
---
Class üòÇüòÇ I just went through a period when all I did is play casual m870, was the most fun I‚Äôd had in a while
---
I think she's great, she's amazing at stopping retakes in late rounds
---
yep maybe if i knew where
---
I wanna see new scopes added every season like for example Gridlock and Mozzie I like how the scopes look
---
Kaid should get one. I also think there is enough in the game already. We don‚Äôt need loads of ACOG‚Äôs on defence. 
---
So this is what people mean when they say they play on streched.
---
Siege servers trash. Happens to me too 
---
Lol me too
---
Yes this game gets more and more trash every day. 
---
Display, calintation on game settings
---
When will it suggest Recruit? 
---
Don't you dare disrespect The Lord like that!
---
He has one, and there‚Äôs only 5 ops on defense with acogs
---
No, we should get new countries, be happy that yours is already in.
---
People who shit talk are easy to deal with because you can mute and ignore them. People who purposely sabotage your game by leaving or teamkilling are a lot worse. In casual at least you get new players when people leave, in ranked you do not.
---
Sherlock Holmes be like
---
So even dumber that the attacker flashed himself before vaulting in hahaha
---
The fact servers aren‚Äôt region locked is cancer enough. 
---
I absolutley hate players like this. Is he thinking that if he yelling louder multiple times its gonna work?
---
nein,im guessing something is with the Windows, it switches the screen gamma to 0

Go in the main page of this subreddit then go for the 3 dots in the upper right corner, there you can change your "user flare"
---
‚úåüèª
---
Nice. Palms got sweaty watching it lol
---
Mute has an SMG now? I‚Äôve been away for too long. 
---
Just the stereotypical gender roles are reversed. Normally it‚Äôs the male who is playing games and the female who has a problem with it.
---
But this is assuming you are in fact a female.
---
Only if it‚Äôs a kill assist for you 
---
He is seriously good on a few locations, a lot more useful in Secure Area as opposed to Bomb, since there are fewer lines of approach. Got a 3k with him defending office on Outback in my placement matches yesterday holding the angle from office, past the mechanical bull, and into the area above the restaurant.
---
i always run a 5 stack with my team and no one is banned. hmm
---
This whole time 
---
Stopped joining people‚Äôs parties cause they just try to tell me where to put all my shit(on defense) and it almost always comes back to shit on us. I like call outs, I do listen. Don‚Äôt tell me where to put all my welcome mats at mf. I main for a reason. I was conceived into a welcome mat. I know welcome mat locations you had never even thought of. Little rant but yes suggested operators would help me in crucial rounds.
---
I wanna know too
---
Watch this taken down. Its a meme
---
I like ur dedication 
---
That flick. Unheard of in the console realm
---
What?  I can't hear you over the sound of all these bullets.
---
Those are so annoying. I wonder how much fewer of these rage inducing moments there would be if kill cams got fixed and were actually accurate.
---
Door kickers action squad is pretty close. 
---
That‚Äôs bad design though surely, if they‚Äôre picking them for the weapon only, even after how statistically poor the weapon is. To me, that‚Äôs not good design. The damage nerf changed nothing in terms of its usage or effectiveness. 
---
The P90 ACOG is fine. Yes it does have a lot of kick, but it should when it has the mag size it does. That‚Äôs why the Alda on Maestro is so good, as it has low recoil, fast fire rate and large magazine. I think it would be fine. Use it if they want to, but doesn‚Äôt always mean you need to run the ACOG. 
---
As for not picking them otherwise, just buff them elsewhere. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do ‚Äî&gt;
---
Doc
---
- Loses ACOG on MP5
---
- Standard revives performed by Doc, heals that teammate to 50HP (Passive ability)
---
- Stim shot heal reduced to 35 (from 40) but he now gets 4 of these so he can spread them around more across the team. 
---
Rook
---
- Armour vests also provides teammates with 20 additional HP (which is shown on the health bar)
---
- Armour vests now have 20% explosive resistance
---
- Rook now has the option of a Nitro Cell (replaces Deployable Shield)
---
Changes like this would be nice to see, and keep the emphasis on the gadget. They‚Äôd still have decent weaponry and the option for the longer range engagements, just will have to use a slightly trickier weapon

Basically calling you out in the pc pricing lol, more like 500-2000 for anything realistic most people will use.

Overwatch is not even that bad for girls, probably the best. Tell her it‚Äôs okay more girls play Overwatch than you‚Äôd think. Siege, however, :(. 
---
I had a similar idea when talking to a friend. A lot of 50cal weapons can fire a bullet that essentially fires two projectiles, one ‚Äúhole cutting‚Äù and one lethal projectile, commonly used to take out enemies through brick. I‚Äôd like to see an op that could literally shoot through ANY in game service a limited number of times, perhaps only 5 bullets with whatever long distance rifle and a usable MP9 secondary? 
---
that's so they can hear the phone ringing and then rush you,and if you try to move the ones who are outside the room can wallbang the fuck out of you
---
Does not work for me either.
---
Please don't say anything else. Just delete reddit. Too scary for me.

Ahh, my bad. I don‚Äôt shop for PC‚Äôs at all, and the one time I did I saw a really good one for 7000 so I just thought that was average price. Cheers sir
---
Please consider googling it.
---
I would recommend watching get flanked and king gorge Mira game play they have the best set up tbh
---
that‚Äôs not a bad thing. there gadgets take a lot more skill and have strategy involved.
---
rook and doc should still be a thing because they are simple and new player friendly
---
Np brother, prices can vary wildly cause it‚Äôs so customizable, but yeah that aside aiming on a console is difficult
---
Ik but they tend to release 1 to 3 elites a season so within a year we could have all OG + All year 1 or  only 3 but I reckon we'll have smoke by Y4 S3 or S4 at the latest 
---
It is a very terrible rework.
---
Damn I can‚Äôt decide. At this point, either of them. 
---
Deep down in my heart, i want a remaster of the original Rainbow Six. Even better if it were a rainbow six remaster collection: original, rogue spear, raven shield. ü§§

Obviously alibi because she is extremely underrated as a roamer, primary with high fire rate and low recoil, secondary that can be used in some soft destruction, and impacts
---
Matchmaking isn't dependant on rank though. You will still be playing with the same people you are now. The matchmaking system is blind to rank. Just the numerical value of your mmr. Adding an extra rank will make plat 3's become plat 4s but you will still be playing with the same group of people who have an mmr range of 3300-3700. Your experience wont change.
---
This hasn‚Äôt been posted 1,000,000 times
---
*Because we haven‚Äòt seen this about a million times*
---
that are all, next season there will be a new one
---
The system has confidence in your ranking 
---
Still though. Like yeah it‚Äôs toxic of them but no need to TK. In the end it‚Äôs nbd
---
In ranked yes, in casual no. Ranked gives you a renown penalty and a temporary ban from matchmaking
---
this patch feels horrible for the fucking hitboxes. I have like 10 minutes worth of headshots not registering as headshots. 
---
ubisoft pls patch i keep getting killed when this happens
---
I feel like ubi is trying to T-pose on PETA.
---
so what. it‚Äôs a video game. if her being big has no impact on gameplay then it should make absolutely 0 difference but it still gets posted about 5 times per day. 
---
Yeah I've been wall banged before
---
Might be that reload animation for the Commando 9
---
What makes you think they're not diamonds? Hummmm
---
thank you
---
Como voc√™ n√£o viu isso antes? est√° no Reddit todos os dias desde que foi encontrado lol
---
Me and my friend have discussed this a lot they should release it and with every purchase you get a renown booster code similar to how monster cans give you double XP in cod
---
okay and the answer to that is not removing the core mechanic of the game. if you paid any attention you‚Äôd see that they‚Äôre implementing a new TK system for next season 
---
if you want play, buy yourself a copy. problem solved.
---
But if you put the ACOG on the shotgun you're just a Moroccan Glaz
---
Yeah you aren't getting the point here
---
repost you twat
---
nice job being the 100000000th person to repost this 
---
It's the Crow
---
If only ash got both her elite skins in there
---
Oh  did you renew it 
---
I am of the mindset that if you use a mic and communicate you shouldn‚Äôt need this system. Nice QOL change but not necessary at all. I‚Äôve never had issues with operator selection personally (because I only ever queue up in groups and I use a mic to communicate necessary OPs)
---
That seems more like a buff
---
Just don‚Äôt die. Yes I‚Äôm serious. Just improve your skills at the game, and try again later
---
nothing concrete, I'm not a mind reader
---
To begin kill cams aren't accurate in any game. 
---
But I do know what you are talking about. The game with the new animations, sometimes doesn't have players facing the right direction on the other person's screen, which makes it so that your head shows on theirs but on your screen you were facing the direction you were supposed to and only your shoulder should have been showing.
---
I'm just irritable because there are all these dumb asses on reddit who think that the camera is set around the entirety of ones head. "If i can't see them they shouldn't be able to see me" kind of shit. 
---
I'm sorry.
---
Seige and the games before it took inspiration for the lore and characters from the Tom Clancy novels, of which at least one is titled Rainbow Six, as it was a fictional team of the world's best to combat terrorism and threats the average military can't control. The game Rainbow Six Seige is a simulation or practice for the operators, and T Hunt is like their actual operation. Now, the inspiration for the actual mechanics is entirely from scratch
---
WAIT! I WILL TAKE IT
---
How? What‚Äôs toxic about recommending 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre literally the worst ironsights in the game

Personally I think people are really over looking the single second warning before the ping, from the previous 3 seconds. I say at worst it's too early to say.
---
you aren‚Äôt getting the point here. these posts are so damn annoying. especially because you see 100 a day. the point here is her size has no impact on gameplay and that‚Äôs all that matters. 
---
I tend to IGL so usually I recommend a placement or two but I don‚Äôt force them all. I just have my own set ups that I use on defense. 
---
nice
---
Noob blitz, doesnt he know that there is a flash on his shield. 
---
And her upper sleeves, the gloves in 1st person on that outfit you are using, balaclava on the Thistle and Frostbitten headgears, Hood and gloves on the Splittermuster and Lilac Splinter outfits, gold trim on her Wren headgear.... Shes pretty fucked lmao, but hey at least they changed Hibanas face am I right.

Probably. I was thinking it was 4 but might be 5

bro this shit has happened to me like 3 times this season, idk why they're even gonna bother with a glaz nerf when his gun won't even work rn

A bit of an *ackshuallie*, but in case anyone cares, it's apparently an NVG mount from the Ratnik program.

I feel like it's done on purpose, her ability isn't designed to make entrances, it's designed to make holes you can shoot through and create new angles. 
---
I putting a comment to save this for later thanks
---
I understand It. It‚Äôs just frustrating. It‚Äôs seems tho that the beginning of every season there is always a shit load of new bugs that make the game hard to play
---
Bullet travel time?
---
looking good 
---
Yep, just like they keep fucking up all IQ's cosmetics and never fixing them.
---
Of course my dude 
---
Tachanka just got an extended barrel
---
"that's all that matters" to you
---
You made the statement that they were so I was just curious to know how you knew? Did you check then out on an R6 tracker or just assume that because they beat you they must be smurfs? 
---
Maybe they were just having a bad season and ended up in gold. 
---
Cool idea, but then, you must have an operator to make his elite. Tachanka right now is a joke.
---
Smoke better look like a plague doctor

Absofuckinglutly!! That‚Äôs exactly how it is.

Yeah i understand that bomb thing, i just have all modes enabled and Play bomb like 95% of the time, this clip just happend to be on secure. Thank you for the kind words tho :D
---
I'd rather have the charms tbh. They didn't look as cheap and where just pretty cool, showing the DOB for the ops and all that. 
---
When this meme will end ?
---
K
---
Tachanka is too close to getting his rework, so he'll probably have to wait. Castle is also a likely candidate for changes, so he might need to wait as well.
---
Idc
---
Np for the apology. If you only play with that friend like 30 percent then still go for him but if not and you play with him like 90 percent of the time and you're a fragger then save it for y4s2 because you have jackal and zofia akf all year one and default ops. If support still go for dokkaebi or ying

Reeeeeee
---
This is still the meta? I though we moved on to defense meta
---
THANK YOU!!!!! sorry for the late reply I don't usually use reddit
---
No, they should be From the Irish Army Ranger Wing. And fuck no for the corner shot....plz fucking no. But yes, I really want Irish Ops.

The defender idea is cool but what is the point of the attacker?

The language is Dutch and the kd is 12.59

If I twitch the cams are the last thing to go lol, it also irritates me when twitch shocks players. There's a more important job to do here lol.

(BUZZ BUZZ) YOU ARE BEING TRACKED (BUZZ BUZZ) DRONE SPINNING UP, STARTING THE CLOCK (BUZZ BUZZ) *blitz rushes in, no brakes on the pain train, finka surges*   10 seconds later,   OPPFOR HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. MISSION FAILURE.
---
Technically an infinite amount if the teams keep drawing
---
yes, its kinda like an old building with gargoyls and stuff.
---
Everyone's going to ping the Lord tachanka like in Apex with Mozambiques
---
I agree, the corner shot would be so ass to play against and they'd have to nerf it really hard to the point where it'd be useless
---
Upvoted for undeserved downvotes
---
Looks likes  gift wrapping pattern you would find at a dollar store 
---
I could go either way support fragger doesn't matter depends on what my team needs i can be either of these roles
---
Agreed, the corner shot would be way too overpowered and it'd have to get nerfed to the point where it's useless
---
Have you tried reinstalling the Year 4 Pass?
---
I‚Äôll check that thanks.
---
They will anyway.
---
As soon as I hear it I start running away as far &amp; fast as I can. It freaks me out.
---
Dang I must be the only one who thinks the elite skins almost all look bad. Wish there was a way to turn off cosmetics because some of them are really bad/distracting.
---
Thunt is supposed to be relaxed
---
I'm stressed until the bombers are gone. And even then, their blue lights still haunt me
---
&gt; thus when you stagnate in one rank around the same Elo (MMR points) via winning a game or two then losing and going back to your original rank 
---
It should be noted that Siege's system does not use Elo. Elo is a ranking system for 1 v 1 games (created for chess).  Siege uses Microsoft's Trueskill ranking algorithm, so a player's ranking is just their rank/MMR.
---
Can use them as a bait
---
If your on PS4 add Kreamy0 we can play some
---
Noice
---
Can confirm I got shot in the leg once and it instantly downed me. Meanwhile shes sitting on full health because my smg apparently only hit her once and she's roided up
---
Then he can hit people with the doctor stick as his melee.
---
Not everyone I know has Rainbow 
---
Just pulled the same black ice about a week ago 
---
It‚Äôs a glitch 
---
True, maybe thats the problem
---
Yeah I know right?
---
I think it‚Äôs overrated.
---
(I use red dot)
---
I've had it for almost a year now
---
Thanks for correction, cleared up my own misunderstanding :) I thought Elo was just the name for the numbers haha
---
Capitao is beholster. Confirmed.
---
They can't without breaking something. Weapons attachments are handled per-weapon, not per operator. So giving Tachunk's SMG an Acog would also give it to KapKan, who is a 2 speed. Replacing TaChunk's SMG with a different one to give him an Acog without also giving KapKan and Acog will break all the non-Universal weapon skins you had unlocked for him.
---
The only buff/change I wouldn't mind to see is to have the recoil pattern be the same when the shield is attached and when it isnt
---
holy aim!! that flick was insane
---
No it isn't actually for example: In the span of blood orchid and white noise we got 3 elites Fuze, Jager And mute. That's just and example. If you do the math there has been 13 seasons and 19 elites (yes I miss calculated it's 19) but my point still stands. If i remember elites came out in year 2 so around velvet shell and operation health and we got 5 that season they're not rushing  but we get 1 - 3 mainly 2 a season. So no your wrong. And I don't know why I'm getting downvoted : (
---
Laaaag
---
I am pretty sure we played together that game... 
---
I do too. I use mostly red dot and it works fine. I honestly laughed when people lost their shit cause Ash lost her acog. 
---
"I keep trying to jump over this deployable shield but I'm so dummy thicc the clap of my taser cheeks throws me back to the ground"
---
Ya know, that‚Äôs the most reasonable answer I‚Äôve heard.
---
u/Cousin_Nibbles
---
What was your uplay?
---
Yeah I have a feeling that the red dot is more precise 
---
My solution for you would be play casual and ranked not only1 meet new people that play good and have a friendship with them that was how i made my party for ranked since none of my friends play this game
---
second üò≠
---
The same thing happende to me 
---
I find it's more a lack situational awareness. It take's 5 seconds at best to look at your teams line-up and change your tactics. I know when i see a mozzie on my team, i make sure to only destroy drones once the attack phase begins and point out if there is a drone nearby for him to steal. 
---
Alex\_Tsak 
---
That actually looks a little scary.
---
You're right, it's a shit map. It is in ranked though.
---
Anyone else able to replicate this? I'm not having any luck.Making me suspicious.
---
No, you weren‚Äôt there.
---
Exactly. That shit pisses me off when someone does it, especially after I got a Shock Drone. That being said I've never been so mad that I TKed because of it though
---
They should ask the pros to help in some ways. Remember, Devs have to work on the game and don‚Äôt always have a lot of time to play and are usually not highly skilled. 
---
It is for the engagement distances in Siege. 
---
t h i c c
---
I had some purposely hunt and kill Al 3 of my drones I was so livid it's been my to for burnt horzion
---
Why can't they
---
Well for a little while now it seems to be 1 a season, but it seems overall I could have been wrong. But if they continue with the current 1 a season, it will take almost 2 years. 
---
Thanks for breaking it down, though. 
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you, btw so sorry if you got downvoted
---
Shotguns or shield?
---
Oh well 
---
When they busted through that wall, it opened up a place for the claymore‚Äôs laser. The way claymores work is, touch the laser, there‚Äôs an explosion which I believe happens right on the point where you touched the laser, hence why it worked through the wall.

Oh, I always see "meh" as ok or average.

Yeah, our enemies were so good that when they tried to c4 me it caused my game to crash and when I got back all I could see was this lol
---
Ok, enjoy your racecar bed 
---
Yeah and still ubi shills are mad at me because i tell them the game is fucking broken, and the devs dont fix them instead they release new lootboxes. 
---
Ok but the problem is is that they're shit like literally nowadays pistols are more effective than machine pistols at every range except maybe like if their right next to you so i'm just saying that they probably need something to make them more viable than what they are now
---
Yeah but that's not it lol VAC is only PC stuff, try customer support
---
I can't do shit with glaz for some reason the reticle seems unaligned from the bullet
---
A boi and a friend 
---
Any idea as to how? I kinda like castle.
---
If they are trying so much then the players themselves need to take action. Some kind of community where only controller players could match up would be nice. 
---
dude im sorry man but that sight is too awful imo
---
It‚Äôs astonishing that you were able to read that from this perspective...
---
I had understand that all the weapons were one shot = one kill
---
They reverted it so now editions dont come with base ops anymore
---
The shotguns hasn't a big range. Also no shotgun has a headshot multiplier, means it won't one-shot an enemy, when you shot an enemy in his head. Every other weapon has such an headshot multiplier, and this multiplier enables one-taps. So its legit
---
So true played rs6 yesterday for the first time after 2 months didnt enjoy it like apex
---
Same
---
Can attest to the lag switch in Siege as on PS4 three players cost me my Plat' match on Skyscraper *this week* by lag switching during a 1v4 til 10 seconds were left Round 1, and Round 2 when we all disconnected except for the 1 controlling the lag switch on the opposing team. Lost Elo and teeter-totter between Gold I and II til I got Plat' a day later. 
---
It's fucking disgusting. I can deal with stuff like the Valk Cam' glitch on Bank awhile back or even a mouse and keyboard in my Plat' matches because I have a chance to fight and win; I have no chance of control to win against something flipping a switch an playing disconnect roulette. Haven't dealt with that pathetic bullshit since Modern Warfare 2. Childish.
---
nah, but runouts are free kills
---
Not anymore
---
Lmao so true I just got use to using the smg 12 a vigil main 
---
What about buck fam
---
They release 2 elites per season
---
Glaz is a strange Russian man.
---
Base ops need to be unlocked just like on launch, the change occured when they took out the starter edition
---
Can confirm, is broken
---
I will thx
---
honestly tho
---
Grow up hahahaha R6 is an anime you dirty weeb
---
intentional
---
It‚Äôs better than them literally not adding anyone for 3 straight rounds

They didn‚Äôt change holo sights to black. They changed them to fit the base gun‚Äôs color.

Fristly i don't said it was easy.  And i understand his being proud of his work. And like i said we do watermarks and he does watermarks and it's completly normal. What i'm saying is doing a watermark across the picture with a bright color is a bit overkill. But if he want to do that he can. No body except him can change that. And secondly lol why would i hate somebody that i really don't know of? And i didn't steal anybody's leak and shared it without the credit. I even shared one obutu leak. And at least that one was somewhat clear. So i don't know what you're talking about. Maybe you could be looking another feed.
---
Dang it I‚Äôm jealous. Been noticing how they are releasing fewer and fewer skins for ops each season but are consistently adding the best skins to alpha packs. Agh just let me buy these. It makes me want to switch to pc even less because I know I won‚Äôt get my legendaries twice 
---
We gon ignore our Lord tachanka who also dosent have an elite 
---
The base guns color is tan, your skin is black though
---
Not sure I would call it a "counter" if they droned you first then you're screwed but at least you have a chance to shoot back if you got your angles covered. Mute jammers also counter this effect but the radius is small so it's very situational, say there is a couple small pieces of cover close by you could potentially move. Or link mute jammers lol
---
I‚Äôm plat 3 and I don‚Äôt have a problem (Xbox)

Cod sucks.

I‚Äôm just waiting for more people to realize how good the g36 is. It‚Äôs been a secret for so long lol 
---
i just did it last month for the trophy and got a full team in 40 sec i think i did it around 4pm cst 
---
Psst you can chat with Ubisoft Support saying you havent got the skin and pre ordered before March 4th and showing them a photoshopped date of purchase
---
Color of the Holo Sight is based on the Default color of the weapon.
---
Alibi's Mx4 is Tan by default so it gets a tan holosight.
---
Crouch spamming is kinda toxic and unrealistic. However from run-outs are realistic. And it's not like the attackers can't fight them (claymores and air jabs). And as much as I hate spawn peeking, it's okay because attackers can usually fight back. 
---
IT Was posted here few days ago
---
it could be super bad luck with the fire rate/interval at whoch you shoot and when your gun is over her head

Why recruit lol

I did this to get the Damascus Steel from Year 3 Pass

Same happened to me during my Plat' match the other day on PS4; lost fucking elo to 3 cowards who blocked their settings so I couldn't even call their scum tactics out. Got my Plat' a day later after winding down.
---
Is the lord Chanka skin an elite I forget if it had that yellow frame 
---
They're hit or miss. The Pro League skin for Vigil, more specifically [his mask](https://i.redd.it/d0cnndu732n11.jpg), was fantastic. 
---
I didn't even notice the Montagne part. Thought this was just a commentary on casual
---
Yeah I'm not a leaker I can only predict based off prior knowledge
---
NO the system is flawed you can sabotage the game without consequences
---
she is thicc as fuck 
---
U need glasses? I'll buy you a pair for an upvote
---
But that means they'll never have a full set of ops each with their own elite skin. Eventually, when they stop updating the game, there will be a few (8, I think), who wont have elite skins.
---
This sounds fun af
---
I have glasses, I just need better ones, the prescription is getting dated
---
But they have masks üòÇ
---
Been playing for only two months and your in silver? Yeah that‚Äôs good. Silver is what‚Äôs considered the average player. Gold means you‚Äôre slightly better, better aim, map knowledge, stuff like that. And Plat means you‚Äôre good at teamplay and coordination.
---
that's fucking eüÖ±Ô∏èic
---
Not new but looks dope
---
Some day smoke my main boy. Someday
---
You sure tried :)
---
The current one isn‚Äôt too bad, at least the face shield is down again
---
She looks way better than before what are you talking about?
---
Ah sweet. Not a cocky player at all but the last match was a complete team carry( even though we lost) where only one of my other teammates had a kill, and he had 1. I was like this should count for something lol
---
Operation red crow
---
Please take the time to read the million posts and responses explaining that Ubisoft *cannot* (let me repeat that) *cannot* do anything realistic about this.   
---
Epic games (Fortnite), a multi billion dollar company, tried to program around M&amp;K adapters to separate them into lobbies of their own.  It got patched by M&amp;K adapters in only 24 hours!   
---
This issue is up to Microsoft/ Sony to either integrate or fix, but this issue probably won‚Äôt be addressed until the next consoles come out.   
---
Oh i like this, i like this a lot
---
Not really. NO ONE wants Bartlett back in anything and old Hereford was definitely very unbalanced. A lot of people found it fun for casual though myself included. It was a lot more "fun" than new Hereford though a lot worse as a competitive map. 
---
Old Hereford was bad, but NOWHERE near as bad as Barflett was. Old Hereford had a basement that was extremely defender heavy, a top floor that was borderline impossible to defend and had 1 internal staircase and like 2 total hatches which made rotating a nightmare. New Hereford is actually better if you put effort into learning the layout.
---
Ha, yep
---
Don't TK, then you won't be banned. 
---
Easy solution, you also recently posted that you were in Platinum now you're in Silver and that's somehow the game's fault. 
---
You don't seem credible. 
---
Looks like a rockstar can to me
---
Every special force has done some bad shit and shady activities for their country. Israel is no exception (I'm Israeli) but it still is frustrating that people can't put politics aside to enjoy a game. No matter how much you hate Israel I could say that I hate another country as much (I don't really) but that wouldn't make me try to stop their inclusion in the game.
---
Example: turkey isn't on the best terms with Israel rn but I would still be extremely hyped to get their CTU in game.
---
Stop being political and start being human! We are all shitty people just sitting in our chairs and playing video games! No need for politics!
---
P.s. if you like my comment help me bring it to ubisoft's attention.
---
This is exactly why the Dev‚Äôs gave him massive recoil after his shield was added.
---
Yeah it was pretty bad. Complete aids to try and rotate around. It's the kind of map thats good fun in a thunt now and then but shouldn't be anywhere near ranked
---
I can relate
---
Yeah I played mostly overwatch since I got a pc. And siege feels so much different tracking wise. But hey man I‚Äôm a 2nd shifter so I play mainly at night 11pm EST my names SirJonnyBling if you wanna link up
---
always depends on the enemies you play against
---
I mean hes got a point, before gridlock came along cav was the ~~heaviest~~ thiccest female operator 
---
I know how you feel. I‚Äôm a Plat player currently in Gold because I‚Äôm having to solo queue. I‚Äôm constantly on mic giving calls but when solo queueing it‚Äôs hard to find teammates with good teamplay so usually we end up losing even while I carry. I honestly don‚Äôt mind solo queuing tho. I honestly don‚Äôt care about my rank, I‚Äôve gotten the Plat charm so I only really play ranked for the way it‚Äôs played and solo queueing enables me to meet more people.
---
I think most people think Mute is underrated, but he‚Äôs really not.  Dude‚Äôs been getting some serious buffs.   
---
I‚Äôd say Jackal PDW-9 and Kapkan are pretty underrated.
---
Is Monty doesn't fast a middle finger on his shield we riot!
---
That fucks me up
---
I‚Äôve actually been waiting to have a reason to use the g36. Everyone always says it‚Äôs bad. I really like it, so i‚Äôm glad they made a reason for it to be used.
---
Give me karma casual noobfag 
---
Smokes used to come in 3‚Äôs back when they were crappy quality and Glaz didn‚Äôt have a thermal.   
---
I think 2 is still a healthy number.
---
Only ugly ass commons...
---
Ying - the only weakness is the ROF, everything else is very well-rounded
---
Alibi - IMO, she's better than Vigil, her gun DPS is slightly lower than his gun but, the RPM makes it up, and the hologram can be used to block potential shots from window
---
Capitao - also weakness is the ROF, need to wait and see the crossbow rework, right now his crossbow is slow when you hot swap the darts
---
Best of luck brother.  I hope it‚Äôs on a gun you like.
---
I wish they would change them up a bit like they did with vigil. Ik his mask gave them some flexibility and it would be harder to implement something like that on other ops but they look bland as is
---
Base and canadian
---
"we don't need our 5th"
---
Yeah I've been playing ranked because as a season pass owner, i want to play the ops that ive payed for, and people love to kill me for that, and ranked just feels right. People take it more seriously, there is way less toxicity. I just enjoy the ranked experience more
---

Nice ace, man. Idk why the kapkan wasn't aiming at the door though. Gj

ooooor just give everybody the same scopes. I honestly wouldn't mind a Vector with a russian reflex tbh

Thanks friend! Yeah, there are some toxic PC players that act like console is garbage, but at least most people just enjoy playing rather than trashing other players. 
---
Thought he pulled out an actual pistol and was about to shoot Grid in the face cuz she was taking too long to fix his bike
---

---
Yes I have the same problem. I was playing before year 4 but am level 47 so can still play newcomer. When I seek a newcomer match it takes about 2 - 3 minutes before a game is found. Where as a casual match only takes around 30 seconds
---
Literally what I do at every opportunity

Happy cake day!

I...agree.

Thanks, and exactly! We did end up winning, but that was my best round by a long shot haha.
---
It has happened to me before.. I blame the internet connection. Eventhough I didn't get removed from the game, somehow when the whole match finished I was sectioned same as u  . I remember that during the game I got a message saying I was getting banned but I thought it was a werid glitch that ended up been real. ü§î

They defeated you so bad they blew you back to year one

Can only be a good thing.

Instead of new maps for the next 3 seasons, we are getting map reworks.

Kafe rework will be with us soon in the next season. Patience my friend.

Why team kill in the first place?!?

2. there are certain instances 2 is ok though

Wow! such siege, much breach!
---
IT‚ÄôS PIKACHU!!!

It wasn‚Äôt on smokes shotgun because usually the gun that is available for more than one op doesn‚Äôt get the skin
---
I‚Äôm a montagne main and EVERY time I am killed, in the kill cam my shield is completely sideways ( which I didn‚Äôt have it ). It‚Äôs been pissing me off like no other. I Aced with Monty all the time before the update, but not it‚Äôs garbage and am forced to actually be good at the game :,(
---
is kanal going to be put back into the ranked pool? and thank god theme park is getting changed
---
inb4 everyone reccomends le tachanka xdd cannot wait for the funniest meme of the millenium

I would have loved those dog tags if they didn‚Äôt have the plastic around them tho, even if they were repetitive 
---
Hmmm where have I seen this before
---
Dont quote me on this but im pretty sure you get kicked after teamkilling twice in the same round and get a matchmaking penalty if you do it 2-3 times. Sorry if this is inaccurate
---
The game can't tell the difference between losing connection and just flat out leaving
---
Might make me play smoke again if so

They‚Äôre reworking Kanal, Theme park, and Kafe
---
Give me my MONTANGNE ELITE!!
---
Oh fair enough, not on random people 
---
Strat roulette?
---
Two things, either they will just throw Kanal Rework into the Ranked pool once it comes out in season 3 OR considering how they've been improving player feedback with the TTS and such, wait for reception if the Kanal Rework is good and THEN put it into the ranked pool.
---
All good
---
It‚Äôs the meta teamüòú
---
Console makes me cringe
---
Fuck yes dude I feel exactly the same way. Especially with the new operators. 
---
Knowing ubi, they‚Äôll proably throw it into the ranked pool and then alter it based off feedback
---
Less people are queuing in newcomer. Since most players are over level 50 and many people prefer ranked over the other game modes. Since there is a smaller pool of players to pick from the times are bound to be higher

Yeah it would look like it was trying to be hacked but I‚Äôm sure someone would give up once they realise there was 2FA, plus after changing your password it‚Äôs still doing it, I dunno maybe there‚Äôs a bug somewhere. Perhaps you could contact Ubisoft support directly and see if they know anything 
---
Got 380 hours on the game and got Black Oce for two of IQs rifles, the german pistol, Frosts smg and FBI shotgun, Epic skin for Echo smg, Epic skin for german pistol and lots more, like got atleast one epic/legendary for half the guns in the game and 41 charms... that much? 
---
Can you send the splash art? I am very intrigued now.
---
Try 3 alpha packs in a row, without the Year booster. Two 2% alpha packs and a 5% after two losses. I got black ice for the SG-CQB on one of them, bought black ice for Frost's shotty (when you could, it was a bug) and got black ice for the R4-C recently. Very happy as I'm almost level 150.
---
I don't like that one either. I wish they were all more like thatchers where it's lore accurate and modern and militaristic.

Nice. I got one on 4% the other day. 
---
New one still looks fine, elite one just looks better.
---
I disagree,  because every so often you get coastline
---
I half expected it to be iq‚Äôs butt
---
That looks amazing,these updated alpha packs are turning out to be very good!
---
Maybe she is testing the strength of the wrench?
---
Tiny Cav and Tiny Mira.... 
---
And that face on tiny Dokkebi
---
It's tactical af. I love it
---
I like how intensely smoke is doing it 
---
Less realistic? I feel like in the previous one she looked anorexic and now she looks more normal.
---
What? 
---
Doesn't look that bad, i'd take it
---
i'm jealous, i like it so much.... 
---
I'm a nobody, but the sub was very dismissive towards anyone who said that Siege has a fundamental problem. Specifically if you said to slow down on new content. Glad a pro final said it.

I really feel like there should a QOL change for the drones though, sure I can spot them as friendly no problem but the sound being identical to enemy drones makes me way too paranoid when I don't know where it is. I always assume I'm being droned out. 
---
There needs to be an icon similar to Echo drones, that was a great QOL change so I know where the drones are stunning opponents. 
---
i also had some crashes. It didnt brought me back to the game. I had to use task manager to get out of the freeze :(
---
My boi without recoil by playing on console thats not too great
---
First shot missed and two shots that weren‚Äôt headshots connected, don‚Äôt see the problem 
---
Not counting the outbreak packs and the summer whatever packs I got black ice for kaplan's SMG, p90 and mutes SMG.  I have a legendary grand inquisitor for docs and rooks mp5. And I have the plasma pink legendary. Have a few epics for the French shotgun. Aaaaand that's it. Been playing since launch. Idk how many hours o have tho. 
---
My guess is a knife battle to see who starts and attacker‚Äôs or defenders is my guess
---
Jackal. Both of his guns are really good, has a secondary shotgun, smokes. He can fit a lot of roles, entry, support, roam clear. 
---
He thinks he discovered something that hasn‚Äôt been posted on here for years but to some it up, ash + Jewish = concentration camps 
---
Id up your horizontal to about 45-50, your vertical  20 and you ads at 30 but when it comes down to everything sensitivity is subjective and can change from person to person 
---
I love it when ranked games end up like a casual match 
---
Hah!, id love to see a tiny Gridlock
---
The thing about dpi is, the higher your dpi and the faster your mouse movement, the harder it is to do smaller adjustements, pro's don't have this issue because they've sunk hundreds to thousands of hours into perfecting their aim with a sensitivity they felt comfortable with. 
---
I suggest going on T hunt and lowering your dpi bit by bit, until it's between what you feel comfortable with, and what most commonly is in use, and see if that's something you can roll with. For example: you could set it to ~1200dpi, and play through about ten Thunt games, see how it feels, if it doesn't feel too intrusive, go for a couple casual games. If something bothers you, like your shots are off, change it  bit by bit, until you're set.
---
Personally I settled to use 800dpi, I've found it a great in-between.

Hopefully everyones favorite doorblocking thiccboi Monty gets one soon ive been waiting for a long while.
---
Ik but blitz still broken
---
just noticed
---
could be bc shotguns have no headshot multiplier 
---
the second hit the head and third hit the neck which according to Ubi is counted as a headshot

Hello craigcollier, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b1yrne/anyone_else_having_this_black_menu_screen_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah, they have modified their controllers
---
Monty should have a Roman Centurion outfit with his animation extended his shield and charging toward the camera
---
Smoke should have a Plague Doctor outfit where the animation ends with the screen getting covered in smoke
---
Tachanka should have a classic Slav outfit: Topless, Addidas Tracksuit, and shoes along with warpaint of the Russian flag on his face with his animation have him spin his turret as the camera comes close, the camera hits the turret and falls to the floor and Chanka Squats and looks into the camera.
---
But it's fun and balanced, and let's face it the pro players aren't always right either
---
Excuse me?? Isn't she always?
