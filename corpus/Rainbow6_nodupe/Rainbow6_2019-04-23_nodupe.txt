please educate yourself a little, and look at the specs and pretty much only look for what kind of video card, and this has a "Intel¬Æ HD Graphics 620"
---

---
don't get anything that says intel hd graphics for any "gaming", at the very least, get one with a 1050ti, or even better a 1060 which are now a lot cheaper than they used to
---
---
---
Better than the alternative. At least its democracy.
---
Whats your CPU?
---
Headshots have a x40 multiplier they're not programmed to instantly kill.
---
Really? Heard good things about cloud 2s and astro 40's, just seen a pair at ¬£120
---
I love the use of the Bearing perfect example of how to use the weapon
---
yeah i‚Äôm looking for a 500 dollar one it doesnt have to be fancy, you feel? if you could find one i‚Äôd be so grateful
---
Uh why? I can understand the Twitch changed but why make a Hibana a better Rusher than Ash? The only difference between the two now would be the ACOG. Since their guns are pretty much the same
---
We removed acog on GSG9, so we decide to give them pre dust line super 90
---
I would if they had a mic built in
---
ü§´
---
Lol
---
Well i do think your idea of buying cloud series as a good idea at that case.
---
I think the map itself is solid, and only needs to be changed a little aesthetically. Just color the rooms/floors differently and make it a little less gross looking and it will be a fine in ranked. However, unless they bring back the OG Hereford many people like myself will never be satisfied no matter how great the new map is. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All the devs need to do, is put "Hereford Classic" in casual, and ranked can keep a cosmetically retouched version of the current map.
---
Wow, you took someone's design and slapped a red filter on it, very impressive.

Yea, I feel if they gave her a special sort of scan or something, it will keep her moving towards pings.

Or maybe sound queues that point in the general direction.

Be interesting if it was a secondary gadget, and not an operator gadget.

You're being sarcastic right? I'm never sure with this community.

Hmmm what colour background should I choose for this red coloured weapon skin I made that would make it stand out and accentuate the details.... I know! Red!

Its' a Casual match where both teams were obviously fucking around (you'll notice the Attackers shot each other a ton too) and not trying.

Had they not been shooting each other its' highly unlikely he would've gotten the Twitch/Ash/IQ before they killed him. The only person he "schooled" was the Sledge.

Yup. Sounds like you've been inducting properly. Will you be staying with us awhile or will you be leaving shortly? Ubisoft thanks you for your money.

The game has been out for years, I don‚Äôt see how this glitch is even possible, literally lost 3 rounds in ranked before anyone spawns in.
---
I like it, but they won't be doing it for the same reason they nerfed lion- it makes him too binary.
---
Huh, can you link me the original? I didn‚Äôt even know there was one

Definitely not me.

Still enjoying it. Even with my garbage level inconsistency and at bronze.

we don't do that here

How do you guys get hibina main next to your name?

For sure. My biggest thing is, crash the servers because you can‚Äôt win? Whatever. I‚Äôm mad when I get banned and lose elo, all from just playing the game, and winning. Sucks

 Just plug in your DSLR in front of your monitor, use an Elgato to capture it and display it on your other monitor with OBS or you could just plug it into the monitor and switch to the HDMI input.

Good shit bro
---
Thanks, its a Nikon D3400, nothing to special but still a great thing to have.
---
You could call it special for sure
---
People have said it before but i'll say it again, 14 isnt always a good idea. I use deployable shields and let a teammate put traps like welcome mats behind them, so the enemies either have to get up to the door and get shot, use a grenade to take down the shield, or vault over and get shot/trapped. There really is no downside besides the possibility of them not using the entrance or missing another useful item; its situational.
---
No nead to teach bad habits from the beginning. Show and explain the possibilities a deployable shield brings and let the player decide what he / she wants to do with it.
---
It's just a fact that sometimes you'd rather choose a deployable shield, over let's say barbed wire on J√§ger
---
Lesion, too frustrating
---
Next season with Ash and Rook sets. :)
---
HAHAHA sorry if I ruined it for you
---
I feel u

I'm a lower ranked player, so I'm just expecting Cav to be banned a lot of the time
---
 I recently bought lion and that set me back to an even 666
---
you could have bought a decent pc for that much lol
---
That's why if you don't reinforce the hatch above the objective, you play from above.
---
What bothers me about this post is that you narrow down new players vision of the game - oh a hatch above site? Let's reinforce it!
---
What if you're playing kitchen/bbq on skyscraper? You'd rather open the hatch, reinforce geisha, open the wall between sites and defend from above.
---
You don't want new players to just do one thing over and over. Let them discover how they wanna play by presenting different options from the beginning.
---
No

Echo because he ruins everything.
---
Thatcher to be obnoxious.
---
Do u realized how broken he is I can name one thing right now a 3 speed with a LMG
---
How long have you been playing for? And how many Elites do you have?
---
IQ has an LMG
---
&gt;1: make master bedroom and office more defender favored, too hard to defend and too ez to take as an attacker; if not, get rid of the site and make a new site in trophy room and main garage
---
Seconded.
---
&gt;2: change games room by getting rid of the left side(from bar perspective) window and making it easier to defend, leave bar untouched
---
Agreed, but bar is bad as well. It is open to both kitchen, fireplace and that hallway.
---
&gt;3: reduce amount of run outs
---
Not needed. Run outs are easy to counter.
---
&gt;4: reduce spawn peeks, especially glitch ones(stair rails)
---
Could you elaborate please.
---
&gt;5: make trophy/kitchen site easier to attack; limited entry points are also hard to enter
---
Not bad, but I think this should be last, depending on how they buff the other sites.
---
&gt;6: change ladder on balcony with five windows into a staircase
---
The k9 balcony? How would this make a difference?
---
&gt;7: move ladder leading to library 2nd floor away from the window and closer to the little room( the one that leads to the blue room stairs)
---
Which one exactly?
---
&gt;8: external stairs need a grate on top that prevents you from falling off balcony and down to the bottom of stairs, which injures you
---
Hmmm...... interesting....
---
&gt;9: adjust the entrance to bar so that attackers can‚Äôt watch more than half the site from outside in backyard
---
Clarification. This does contradict 2.
---
&gt;10: double doorframe possibly get a doorway to the other door of bar, making entering dining room as an attacker trying to get to kitchen site a little easier
---
You want to make another entrance to dining **from bar**? How though?
---
&gt;11: untouchable window in trophy room either remove or add a balcony you can rappel onto to peek it as an attacker, but also make it so defenders have more camping spots in trophy to counter the window being too effective
---
This should be the last change. In fact, avoid. Can heavily compromise the literal only Mira strat in trophy on the wall facing the stairs.
---
Shields are useful for the Italian operator the female one
---
Yes, because Australia has border problems.
---
is there two air lines? i don't paintball, but what'd you need 2 for?
---
At least headshots work
---
On attack I'll ban Nomad, Jackal and Blackbeard a lot.
---
On defense I'll probably ban Echo almost exclusively till he gets a much needed nerf.
---
&gt;/s
---
Thank God.
---
Stupid investment. You‚Äôll grow up and realize it.

Her LMG doesn't have fast ads. Still stupid 600 Ms like Cap's.

The bottom one my the pistol grip is the main line, the other one was there because I thought I had all the pieces to put the air through the rear, so I went to fit all of them and I got the wrong size, so that airline is stuck there until I get a buffer tube without the line or get the last piece (which has been sold out for +3 Months)
---
They didn‚Äôt gain enough points throughout the season, they were just beaten by LeStream and Empire
---
These aren't rules for every siege player.  These are guidelines for brand new players.

Nice.  I just wish I weren‚Äôt a bad slut.

Mira wants to know your location...

Lol how does he know it is a siege building?

What are they actually getting weaker now I mean I‚Äôve only started to pay attention to them
---
On #14, or Mira*
---
#15. Don't fucking reinforce kids bedroom
---
You, good sir, are a magician.
---
Best looking ones to me are : Smoke, Doc, Kapkan, Valkyrie, Vigil, Buck, Hibana, Ying
---
Good looking ones to me : Caveira, Echo, Lesion, Ela, Maestro, Alibi, Clash, Blackbeard, Zofia, Dokkaebi, Lion, Finka
---
Average looking ones to me : Castle, Mira, Kaid, Glaz, Capitao, Jackal, Maverick, Nomad
---
I play 4:3 stretched.
---
How? Just how? In what logical universe is it even good, let alone comparing?
---
It had 1 viable site, near 0 vertical play, **a single staircase, taking control of which you can cut off any retake**, pathetic layout because it had an L hallways
---
 at the top like the new one does as well? It was the very personification of garbage, and whatever nostalgia I had was evaporated by the utter cabbage waste design that the map was. Common sense that it was removed from ranked and PL.
---
As said by pros, Hereford and Fortress both have a huge disadvantage in the form of L hallways, but that's it. At least it has 3 viable sites (though 1 is defender favouring), godly vertical play, and **finally 2 staircases**.
---
The new one has issues, but is in any universe better than the old one.
---
Thankyou for saying that I mostly pay attention to them out of Borden while waiting for the new hyped dlc I guess bow I will watch space station and empire out of bordom while waiting to see the new ops
---
No clue why nobody understands this.
---
They even defend it. Oh Lord.
---
This is bandits thing since he has a motorcycle and probably a mirror to spare
---
Question: What exactly is "peak" in the bottom floor sites?
---
It‚Äôs more of the other teams catching up to G2 than them getting worse, by a long shot in fact. Take secret for example, they were very dominant in S8 but now find themselves in 8th place in S9. Teams are constantly getting better and if teams can‚Äôt keep up, there‚Äôs a higher chance they‚Äôll end up falling behind. That‚Äôs why G2 are so good. Despite their current place in the standings they are still one of the most consistent teams in the world, thanks to their adaptability and many strengths
---
That was an April fools event
---
Agreed. Mira locks down top floor.

They already did
---
It depends on what make of marker you get/want. It‚Äôs very niche, but the base gun was about $259.99, new upper for magazine feed was $149.99, rear stock piece was $49.99, tube was about 15-20, and the 3-D printed parts were $140.00, and that‚Äôs not counting the acog $40, angled grip $13, and mags for a two pack $35.99, which I have 4, and plan to get more. Overall, at about $800, and will be close to 1K in USD when I‚Äôm done.

I see what your trying to say but Ubisoft decided to give this man his own sight and flaming arrows that destroy most people in a corner and any clash mains

you grind your "career" until you become famous enough that they might contact you

Ban echo or maestro

My point is that his load out isn‚Äôt the issue

It's a tk unfortunately

Fuck off faggot with your fake leaks.

Black Ice but it‚Äôs actually a uniform camo

I've seen this countless times and I still find this funny.

I got the black ice skin for frost‚Äôs 9mm C1 and I don‚Äôt have her yet. My friends have all had frost since she came out but have never got a black ice skin for her. üòÇ
---
not sure what the problem is, for me it's fine. it should automatically open up steam still even if you have nothing, and steam only does the tax thing if you have more than 200 sales transactions in a year
---
Echo is like AUG in CS:GO, no one use him much before the buff, but when he gets 2nd yokai, he became problematic for the game.
---
The operators that I will ban are : Blitz, Dokkaebi, Caveira, Echo, Mira (depends on the map), Lesion, they are just not fun to play against
---
Iron sights gang
---
You had 3 gold ones and a plat? They had one good higher rank not that bad üòÇ
---
I had to figure this out on my own cause i figured out most of my friends were bots
---
I think it is more kill centered than tactically centered. Bomb also offers better retake, separate sites at one time, you aren't notified when an enemy is in the room. It's just a bit harder and more tactical in my opinion. I remember when my friends and I exclusively played secure and then I accidentally cued us into a bomb game and it was the most intense game I've probably ever played.
---
Another good one would be saying they're going to remove the glass pane on Blitz's shield.
---
Ya there is mag fed and drum fed paintball markers out 
---
Limited ammo games ftw!
---
Obviously.
---
You wouldn't want your worst eneny to have it big and steal yo girl.
---
I fucking hate it when docs spawn peek. Like, cool you‚Äôre able to heal yourself but your entire purpose is to help the team. Not to get kills. Most of the time the teams I‚Äôm on, the doc is either immediately killed or goes to the wrong window and comes in last second to get killed
---
F

I didn't even know this could happen

Oh no that's excessive. That's taking #NerfBlitz too far.

Seriously
---
That 200 sales per year is only a thing for you to trigger to fill out some tax form thing, I'm talking about steam tax collected based on the state you live in.
---
Skill based? How would that work for people like me, who can get an ace on the first round then get 0 more kills
---
Yes. Idk if they have to be reported but I report a hacker.
---
frost/alibi are great with it too. they have to jump over the shield and land in the trap (or shoot it), alibis thingie behind the shield in a doorway and any drones or players who jump the shield get spotted
---
Big F, she‚Äôs fun to use; or my friends say she is
---
Okay so 14 had some exceptions
---
Paintballs wash off crazy easily, and I'm just guessing OP put a clear coat or something on this to protect it even more.
---
That was my biggest gripe with that map, same as kanal, but they didn't have to change the whole damn thing.
---
if they try to kill me
---
The g36c is NOT a terrible gun. That gun has a lower time to kill than ALL defender primaries except the ALDA. It has a better TTK than the para, l85, 556, 552, g8a1, m762, 416, all defender pea shooter primaries, Aug, most considered s tier weapons.
---
Get your facts right, OP. 38 damage at 780 RPM is VERY good. Numbers don't lie.
---
What about one with a self driving drone
---
Damn, never thought about it that way
---
Ugh, I'm tired of all these Ash/Twitch fraggers I can't wait till they remove Twitch's acog so that she stops being so OP
---
You can say that once they actually do it. They haven't done it yet.
---
I think they'll go the Nomad route, and just add a super loud fog horn sound effect if it gets within the map distance of you.
---
As a BB main I dream of this skin
---
Imagine having to wash paint off your gun after a game. This was made by airsoft gang
---
buff ur mom aahshhshahsaasashahahahhha
---
Alright will do, can you send me the link to your account because theres allot of accounts with that name
---
I had always thought Mavs gun looked more like a glock than a 1911 and I was disappointed but then I looked at the elite force 1911 and thought close enough
---

Wait till you see the non existing recoil. This this is basically Op
---
16:9 21"
---
He doesn‚Äôt need a buff, he‚Äôs a strong roamer but not to OP and he does his job.
---
I assume this happens in other games too now?
---
I think you were hitting the shield
---
It‚Äôs probably in the rules section of the subreddit homepage
---
I've found that capping the games framerate to my monitors refresh rate prevents it from using unnecessary power. Even in the main menus the fps can go up to some hundreds of fps and my card gets loud and hot because of it. It stays more stable after capping the fps.
---
Quite a few people are arising issues about fps drops on solid gpu's this season. It may just be a bug, but It wouldn't be a bad shout to have a look at you GPU for dust build up, which would explain the high temperatures and lacklustre framerate.
---
Fan art, downvote
---
I assume he is talking about the hostage/lesion glitch to make the hostage bleed out.
---
acog mira? something has extended but it wasnt my shield.
---

---
most of these "tips" are horrible.

he literally just got one
---
Isn't that the point of a meme....
---
That‚Äôs depressing, I thought I‚Äôd be one of a kind. I‚Äôm the steam pic of Tyler the Creator, my profile is in japan
---
The defender can be like castle tho and fuck your team more then help, that‚Äôs the problem with castle that it takes a while for defenders to break it, and now this that‚Äôll take longer it would be like castle and a person that doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing would fuck your team more then help them
---
Oh yeah i guess thats a glitch,although id call it an exploit but i completley forgot about that
---
Well, if you get into the situation to shoot blitz' feet in distance to kill him, then he is just a really bad blitz player.
---
Counter to lion/glaz? Just shoot him duh
---
It‚Äôs a game üôÑ
---
Is it really? Shows up fine on my end. Had a friend check it out too
---
Ye it‚Äôs stuck on 1:19 until it gets to a 4v2, at least that‚Äôs what I saw
---
Agreed
---
Oof
---
1- your English is fine.
---
2- he counters the Intel of 20 of the 23 attacking ops in the game, the exclusions being jackal, Dok and lion. Why on Earth does he need a buff? He is a high skill cap roamer that is regarded by pros as "very powerful". Why should we reduce the skill cap for no valid reason?
---
He's fine. The lion buff itself was not asked for. He needs no changes whatsoever.
---
What kinda Facebook crap is this? ‚ÄúShare if you love Jesus, ignore for satan.‚Äù
---
Have to add something
---
Never, ever, ping with valk cams. Use your microfone for callouts.
---
Pinging in tense moments when the enemy is to busy with holding angles against the defenders is the only exception.
---
Or recruit
---
The people who pick J√§ger and bandit for their guns are dumb. They have S tier gadgets, and J√§ger is irreplaceable at the moment. Don't pay attention to them.
---
Depends on playstyle and squad.
---
What you got?
---
Glaz loads blanks into his gun. It‚Äôs a little game he plays, we all just gotta put up with it.
---
This is sad,alexa play the main theme

Could you do a small walk through or a guide on how to paint/customize a gun like this? I wanna customize my airsoft guns but I'm not sure how to approach it.
---
It is west Japan, and depending on what platform you play on, it will either really help you or dick you. Ps4 and PC has a very good playerbase, but Xbox is virtually empty
---
*begins screaming bullshit callouts*
---
I got that charm
---
Wtf is this abomination
---
I use the scan right as we‚Äôre attacking.
---
Thats actually a huge fucking nerf for him.  Part of his play is to give misinformation, not just hiding from cams.   
---
Go on  a different floor to objective and run around with it on.   
---
If your team communicate you can actually leave a few drones up and have them call out their location to you, Go 1 floor up or down and use the ability.  The attackers see the interference and suspect you are near the drone and now they have to either push slowly or go somewhere else.
---
Paintball has spent years trying to get away from the "realistic look" then Airsoft came along and now paintball seems desperately like it's trying to jump back on the "realistic" bandwagon

toxicity on bank? lol is that a way of saying how expensive it is haha?
---
TFW you spend 1K on a Tippmann 
---
In all seriousness good job man! I cant judge I have spent far more on markers that dont deserve the effort! The X7 will always have a special place in my heart
---
I agree with getting solid teammates most of the time but when you get bad ones they are BAD lemme tell ya. Honestly I wasn't going to and didn't to even post this but it has happened twice in the past hour and it really soured my night. Before they could kill me for the final time at the last round I Dead Man's Handed the spawn and got banned for 30 minutes. It was going to be my last match anyways but still it seems kinda backwards that I got banned for TKing when 3 of the other people has already done it to me. And they got No repercussions other than the -100 points.

---
Agreed, a shield operator on defense was completely unnecessary.
---
No, it's not too late. There are lots of resources to let you catch up and new players are always joining so there'll be plenty of people at the same level. Have a look on [R6Guides](https://r6guides.com) for things to learn.
---
I dont think they changed it at all.   
---
endlessly killed by someone holding an angle  without exposing themselve at all. Not even an elbow or an ear.
---
Some guns feel like shit.  Doc‚Äôs feels good
---
Wow I didn't know......thx
---
Give Clash SMG-11 as secondary
---
I used to only play Ela. The nerfs kinda went too far in the weong direction I think.
---
He dodn't need the body outline. I think that was the most overpowered part. I still think they could tweak him just a little more. Towards a buff I mean. (Tiny buff)
---
Exactly
---
In the past you were allowed more customization
---
Not really.  If they are willing to roatate who kills you then reverse friendly fire isnt going to change anything.   
---
Take it turns to shoot so you dont take enough reflected damage to die, and rotate who kills every round. These people arent going to care if they end up on 50hp.
---
The shot leaves a trail doesn't it?
---
Only coppers think lion is balanced
---
No they don‚Äôt, they changed lion because 99% of the player base complained about him
---
Thanks for this, I‚Äôve played on and off for a while now (lvl 70) and I‚Äôm starting to really try and improve, this helps a lot üëç
---
contact xbox support
---
Meh
---
This game ain‚Äôt tactical anymore
---
That would probably look like 10 people spamming ender pearls for 3 minutes
---
Most of those maps are fine in casual, all im saying is if you hate half the maps in the game just stop playing. it's not just 1 map, it about 8 or  9 you said which is half. if you have a problem with the maps stop playing cause if their boring then why are you playing siege? also if you hated some of the newer maps whats gonna stop you from disliking the ones that they would make? NOTHING! so again if you want new maps then make them yourself, cause no one has got time to  Change half the map playlist.
---
I am a plat player and carried my friends account out of copper easy. Aslong as you dont get teamkilled its easy to win if you are good.

Thats the black hole they found
---
The problem with Fuze is that everyone uses him incorrectly these days. His gadget is best used for area denial, pushing defenders out into lines of sight of you or your teammates. Using him for kills rarely works.
---
No screw this suggestion
---
I did that in a casual in chalet as well
---
I got a spot on clubhouse that almost always makes it a 5v3
---
Im still sticking with "White Lava" as the name
---
Shoot it, hoot him while he's placing it, if you're not a soundwhore by now I can't help you
---
I don't play stretched
---
Yeah this is super frustrating. But you were probably a little too late and the server rejected your shot, because in server time he downed you before you shot.
---
There isn't any one spot for Fuze, with Fuze you are capitalising on the enemies mistakes. Where is this spot?
---
I said they should remove 5 maps,I'm fine if they dont remove hereford, and I also said that they should either remove it or lower the chances of them being choosed
---
Did you even read the thread?

---
That‚Äôs pretty inaccurate. There is literally no benefit in the absolute slightest to playing 4:3 in CS:GO, R6, or any kind of FPS game. None at all. It‚Äôs the same perception as 16:9 just with much less peripheral view. 4:3 STRETCHED on the other hand (what I play) add the benefit of stretched enemies so they are effectively easier to hit. I can switch between 4:3 &amp; 16:9 no problem, but seem to always fall back to 4:3 stretched for some reason.
---
I don‚Äôt know a single soul in the hundreds of people I have played siege and CS with that play 4:3 non stretched.
---
How in what world did that hit her shield and not her leg
---
u/BasicallyHomeless you mean?

I feel sorry for you dude oof if it makes you feel any better I‚Äôve got like 700 and have 7+black ice however I now only get commons.... so sad

In the Russian-speaking group. They often show content a few hours or even days before the official release.

For casual they are just fine. Tower and Theme park are worse in my opinion.

Yeah you are pretty stupid for giving anyone your account info but for sure contact xbox support and try and provide evidence. I knew a kid who scammed another kid out of his account and he actually got perms banned on his account for it. When it comes to scamming and stealing someone‚Äôs account Microsoft actually will look into it and possibly ban him it‚Äôs defiently worth a try.

That does suck and I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. But it should only happen rarely really like about 10% of the time. Even then though that‚Äôs a high number. You‚Äôll just have to power though it until next season because that‚Äôs when they are implementing the new toxicity system they mentioned at the Six Invitational. Basically there will be a forgive option of it was accidental and if it wasn‚Äôt it will activate a reverse friendly fire for them so if they attempt to kill you they will take the damage instead. They will still be able to kill you with explosives but at that point they will get kicked like normal. We should know ore here in about 3-4 weeks.

The problem is more or less Ubi is helpless against it. If they put in an anticheat software to detect adapters they can ban people, but again they can make a new act, and companies that make adapters constantly update them to make them harder to detect. They could also put in a case by case review system like overwatch in csgo, but people will surely be falsely banned. You can also do ip bans which are ineffective because sometimes there can be multiple people playing on a single ip and one person screwed all of them. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure using a vpn can get around ip bans (idk if that‚Äôs true don‚Äôt blast me if I‚Äôm wrong). Even if they do separate lobbies for controller/MnK it wouldn‚Äôt do anything. The adapters will still trick the console to thinking its a controller. These people already have the adapters, they‚Äôre gonna keep using them to feel good about shitting on kids on sticks.

I just hope they see this post and maybe give them an idea on how to change him up a little

Dont worry, i have played about 1200 hours since the beta and i still havent got a single black ice, i only have it for the p12 and IQs commando as i bought them during black ice.

Ive heard that valks smg is kinda bad tho

Yeah man I'm all for this. It may be necessary to lower the EDD damage, or give him 3-4 instead of 5, but I think it'd change the way people would play him.

I know right. I really hate the new version. And i kinda stopped enjoying the game because I only get the same 6 maps. Hereford base, fortress, villa, skyscraper, tower and coastline. I do like skyscraper and coastline but they get old when they are the only maps you play. It seems rare when I get a map different from those.

"why I'm frustrated with Rainbow 6" you're frustrated with the game because you can't understand the basic and obvious reasons the devs are doing things you don't like. The game is changing and you're simply unable to adapt to it. "Too futuristic/unrealistic" there's only so many balanced operator ideas that ubi can come up with that are realistic, plus Siege takes place in the future. Ubi isn't going to alter the game because of one person making ridiculous requests like yourself. Your IQ is room temperature.
---
In real life, your teammates watch your back. Pretty crazy stuff
---
I think you are asking for way to much fro Ubi. Soinds like something that they would attempt and then it would somehow break a completely different part of the game.
---
But great idea though. üôÇ
---
call him trash, let the toxicity consume you
---
i dont get it
---
I‚Äôve found holo has a smaller middle sight and the other circles helps you find the middle faster when and makes it easier to hold really tight angles compared to reflex and both have a good field of view while red dot only has the center of the holo and has a much bigger size which makes FOV small
---
have you tried not sucking?
---
Thanks dm me
---
Oopsie woopsie, atleast im not that cuck who ear rapes his teammates
---
Wot?
---
This will make sense when the post reaches hot
---
I would‚Äôve repelled right into a frost mat.
---
bruh i heal my team whats wrong with that
---
__Hehehe thats what you think__

I don‚Äôt rape people and I‚Äôm not into cuckholdint either... not to kinkshame bro but this is getting to sexual pls don‚Äôt reply anymore it‚Äôs gayüòê

Last season i pulled off a finka sausage/recruit m870/ash rush with the squad in plat 2
---
I get accused of using MnK all the time simply because I play on a high sensitivity. It's ridiculous how salty kids get when they find out someone might be better than them and a video game
---
If you want to lighten the mood for your team, i recommend leaving the match and jumping from your roof
---
I got mine, and I will help it reach 'hot'.
---
Weird. When I report people to psn, even the smallest thing makes them take action.

Creeper. Aw man

Oh, I thought you were one of the ones that only buffed your own health.
---
The red dot is just a pretty meh sight, Its benefit is that the reticule is just a single small dot but the housing of the scope is what makes it the undesirable choice for most players.
---
Got mine thanks rook
---
I know this is commented a lot but seriously 
---
Why cant my enemies be this incompetent.
---
Yes of course! However, we do not consider those types of matches 'competitive'. You can go to many paintball fields in the USA and they'll have 'situations' like these set up where you can bring some friends or play with people already there waiting for others. However, in these scenarios the field typically bans full-auto fire and some fields ban the 10.8 balls per second ramp fire mode since many casual players enjoy bringing their semi-auto mil-sim markers and automatic paintball markers would have a significantly higher advantage.

It definitely depends on how you play her. She can be boring if you let your team dictate when you press the button, because then it's not you really, but if you say when you are gonna press or get your team positioned then it's much more fun. Or if you just play selfish your team might be annoyed at you but then just imagine your ability having no effect on anyone and try to just frag out.
---
I'm literally playing the fourth game of today on coastline right now

Thanks rook

Honestly I just leave when I know they are premades, it's impossible to do anything against it unfortunately

Unless ur squad have cav

Lmao perfect timing.
---
There are plenty of players to match you with it‚Äôs just that Siege can‚Äôt do it very well.
---
I will definitely be doing that
---
I get the last one :)
---
How many miles does it take to get to hot? I actually have no idea
---
I'm level 85 and only have 2 aces so it just takes the right scenarios how good/bad you're playing, and how bad/good the enemy team is
---
My pleasure keep them poisoned
---
Oh wow completely missed that thought it was a kill not a down the first time. Nice play man!

No, but you are interrupting them. Give everyone a chance to play...... Also dubstep and heavy metal are usually very disturbing, so if you are enjoying it do it somewhere else. Blasting is not a great choice m8...

seems like a lot of m&amp;k kids got mad lmao
---
This isn't a cheat, this is an exploit, someone found this out recently, and I can confirm that it works (tried it in a custom game), I'm not going to say how it works, but it involves lesion and someone damaging the hostage
---
Please don‚Äôt flame me for being console...
---
This is why I hate playing hostage and ranked. Because people always use shitty exploits to win. Just play the game normally and actually get good at the game instead of using exploits.

We were a 5 q and lets just say he has many bad days.

Macie has always been more popular than Sergio. Sergio was just making noise in the background with his toxicity.

&gt; Sergio was really growing up in the community from his ‚Äútoxic‚Äù gameplay

Ubi acknowledging Sergio would be like Ubi acknowledging toxicity in the community. They wont do it.

Hello Ant_903, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bgkhwj/glitch_mozziehacked_drone_glitched_up_to_the_roof/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

he should be featured in Flash....
---
[removed]
---
I actually went back and checked some settings as I've been needing to myself.
---
Recommened changes to regain FPS in order:
---
* Anti-Aliasing to Off or FXAA, no other setting is viable.
---
* Shading Quality to Medium (High enables an effect called Relief Mapping which is a decent knock to performance)
---
* Reflection Quality to Low (Disables the reflection technique entirely, saves a decent amount of FPS)
---
* Ambient Occlusion to SSBC or Off if you still need more FPS at this point.
---
* Shadow Quality to High or Medium if you really need FPS boost.
---
* Texture Quality to low is the last thing you can lower for a boost, but I'd do this as last resort.
---
Obviously Lens Effects and Zoom in Depth of Field off since they are annoying and save FPS when off.
---
concussion or not being able go out side itself gives defending team too much of advantage

Thank u ubi!!!

Supressor

Lol probably

It's how Microsoft's system works. They implemented it. If your rep is bad, you get matched with those players.
---
Psn and of might be different. But that's how xboxs rep system works and affects your queue.
---
Y?
---
They just jealous....
---
Well your gun does alot of damage so you dont loose a lot of damage plus the recoil is easier to control with it
---
I‚Äôm on PlayStation though. Plus I‚Äôm not toxic at all.
---
&gt;  that way all the Smurfs/hackers were kept out.
---
lol imagine. i can't speak for smurfs because i've only ever seen supreme/global mm. But prime did nothing to cheaters. The anticheat is still completely worthless. VAC does nothing, it's just a module that scans for known signatures. Just do what 99% of cs cheat "devs" do: paste some garbage from the front page of UC, change a couple things and enjoy your 'private'.

Sounds like you‚Äôre not trying hard enough. Ranked is for hardcore gamers. Casual might be what you‚Äôre looking for
---
I knew about the forgive option but I had no idea about the reverse friendly fire change. I am pretty stoked now. I think I might just take a short break until they implement it if I get put into a TK lobby again.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA BEU
---
You better not do that again
---
So much misspelling XD
---
Your saying that you don‚Äôt flex the black ice skin on plebs in casual?
---
Muzzle break
---
Funny cause the people who did it sounded really southern and one of em said they lived in Georgia while he was hitting up a 16 year old girl who was in the lobby for her phone number
---
We debated whether I should or not but with 30 seconds left and the defuser outside, I just went for the kill
---
Gonna hit F5?
---
My settings are 45/100/25 and I really recommend those
---
And also type it maybe?
---
He obviously had a better gaming headset, chair and mouse.
---
Man I‚Äôm unranked in casual and go up against even diamonds sometimes it‚Äôs so annoying
---
The jetpack just sounds terrible for a game like Siege.
---
Like you've seen all the bugs that happen after seasons. Lmao how are you gonna expect a jetpack to function normally in this game?
---
Wow, actually beat that with my old email by 3,000, jesus.
---
Maybe if the game weren't populated with 5 yo it would work
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like, idk hat casual expects but it certainly shouldn‚Äôt expect an someone of a lower rank then diamond to beat them.
---
Gosh. Has it been that long already?
---
I've ask, work 1/5. At least 1/5 is better than 0
---
It‚Äôs kinda shit
---
This just proves how short Mozzie is.
---
I do the same on yacht
---
Yeah I‚Äôm always up against sweats and I‚Äôm only a casual player I don‚Äôt really do ranked so I‚Äôm not really that good but I‚Äôm not bad either have played a good bit
---
It actually works better without the bomb when the obj is in the room below, can't remember its name
---
disortography... im just gonna copy paste it :P
---
Would this be considered an ace since there are only 4 people on the other team. I've heard from people even streamers that it is.
---
Because that moderation is left up to Sony or Microsoft to enforce. Instead of pc, where ubisoft can. They've flat out said this. Google it. It was in the same press release(or around the same time) as the ban for hate speech announcement.
---
Can you link it?
---
People will get triggered no matter what ranking I give so.
---
Still not even used to the new Hereford

Cursed delete it

This community is salty
---
Hey man you tried and that all that matters
---
Valkyrie looks like a goblin in this
---
For attack it varies between ash, maverick, and capitao. 
---
For defense always and forever tachanka cuz say what you want his lmg is amazing and so is his smg. And if he‚Äôs taken I play Kapkan for the smg cx
---
What is this supposed to be?
---
Fuze the obj.
---
Rush Blitz.
---
Recruit M870.
---
Ela is very limited right now. I would go with Lesion for sure, he‚Äôs probably the best all around defender

Our skin *crys* it's beautiful

Nah it's just preference. Maybe haver throw an acog on or two, but other than that just let her be

And the lowest K/d. That‚Äôs who he‚Äôs talking about
---
180‚ÑÉ???? That would be reaaaally hot, should be at 70‚ÑÉ
---
180‚Ñâ is fine but not desirable, it should be lower
---
The most important thing would be the GPU temperature
---
Totally understand ya. 
---
Just skip the games with toxic people (be sure to mute and block em).
---
And never "feed the trolls" - never play their mind games.
---
I never take them seriously.
---
It's the games where you find friendly and team-players, and play great matches where you learn and build up.
---
Give R6 a chance! - just skip or ignore the toxic players.
---
Finally nerfed him
---
Ranked too lmao. What the...
---
Oooooooooooooh good find
---
yah the point is OP wants mozzi's drone to work out side. so I said then make yokai work outside too.
---
Yeah it's like "light mode users" vs. "dark mode users". iPhone vs. Android. There's nothing wrong with the P90. I love that rate of fire. Love the clip size.
---
Its honestly not the bad anymore. The DPS is only a couple points lower than the MP5 and the recoil is easier to control imo.
---
Its just a trade off, if you want more ammo in the mag you get slightly less damage.
---
nope. both had good ping. lag is not an issue, also she saw me for a solid second, the lag can‚Äôt be that bad
---
WraithRodent
---
My bad, it's in Fahrenheit.
---
Why do you thinks it's terrible? Especially when users such as yourself would still benefit from aim assist because the device you use tricks the game into thinking you have a controller, would you honestly sacrifice that advantage if you paid that money to have it in the first place?
---
You should be getting around 150-200 at 1080p ultra settings. Make sure you pc is clean and temps are fine.
---
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes
---
WraithRodent. I know we see thousands of tags, just tickles the memories
---
Oh I thought he was talking about chankalanka because that's what the post was about. Yeah I like using echo, hes super fun and helpful but you do sacrifice a ton of action
---
It used to be the obviously inferior gun. It still is inferior in most opinions. But since the MP5 got nerfed it's not a bad choice.
---
Very expressive and colourful
---
what
---
That
---
His dad left him
---
Eh maverick is in a really weird spot, also I don‚Äôt think ash is broken, just she is the operator for the VERY average player
---
If I‚Äôm playing seriously I use the mp5 with acog. If I‚Äôm fucking around I take the p90 and put a laser and suppressor on it and hip fire peoples heads.
---
I think it depends
---
If they down someone and start trying to chase the kill, and getting shot themselves just do it yourself
---
Kills don't really count for anything though outside of your K/D stats
---
I‚Äôm good thanks
---
The only issue i see with this is if you allow MnK those with the adapter that is considered a controller would also get aim assist. I don‚Äôt know as if that‚Äôs a big enough deal or not though.
---
Unless you're doing this with a five man, please don't throw matches. Some people are actually trying hard to rank up.
---
I‚Äôm doing rather well thanks for asking
---
Ummmm... I read a reddit post. Good question though.
---
and suppressor
---
Yes for Tachanka, No for Turret :(
---
your cpu is between 80 and 90 ¬∞C, not too ideal, are you using an intel stock cooler?
---
your cpu is maxing out (95%+ utilization) so your cpu is holding back your GPU, in this case I'd say try to OC the cpu but that is a locked chip, you could try BCLK OC it but since you are already between 80 and 90 ¬∞C that will make temps worse and would not help that much either.
---
Personally I think lion is still useful. Not as useful as before but still useful. His pings still give good info and the scan is still a good crowd control tool.

I‚Äôm fine with leaving her in the same category at tachanka. Although she could be tweaked to make her viable, I don‚Äôt think she is good for the game.
---
I (in silver 3 before this match) just got put against a (what I think was a five stack) of gold 1s and 2 of them had 11-12 kills (this was on ps4) they were definitely using mouse and keyboard+on smurf accounts

Gotta love the matchmaking

didnt know they added the krummlauf into siege!

*claps in gucci*

I mean, I got gold 2 duo queueing and I just started playing in December. Gold 3 rn, and on Xbox it‚Äôs mostly people boosting above gold 2. I got into a game with 4 coppers and a plat 2, while I was gold 3 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. People wanna ruin it for me, why can‚Äôt I do it to them? 90% of the looking for group posts on Xbox are: bronze and below free carry.
---
What did I say
---
Not too bad, it‚Äôs the thought that counts.
---
I‚Äôm still over here struggling to draw a straight line
---
What about weighing the highest rank on the team more heavily to create the average MMR?
---
Either way something needs to be done. I Soloq often and just finished a game in Plat III playing against a diamond , "Unranked",  Plat 2 and two low golds. My squad had myself , two other plat III's and two TRUE low golds. To soloQ into plat you literally have to play at a high plat/diamond level  and carry to overcome these cheese tactics because your teamed up with people who are ACTUALLY  the skill level of the rank they have.
---
All maps I don‚Äôt have a problem with with. They‚Äôre gonna massacre them like Hereford base
---
It was actually a gift for a friend. I got him addicted to siege and he likes Doc probably more than I do. I made it for him because he officially played siege for a year. (Yes I kept check because I had a feeling he would like siege as much as I do and I knew from the beginning I wanted to do something cool for him.) He said he likes it a lot, even though it looks like ‚Äúa really nice kindergartener made it‚Äù of course he said that with gratefulness lol
---
exactly how my chanka looks. scary
---
That‚Äôs gaming for you.
---
They could just balance it that way then
---
Now that‚Äôs bad..
---
And to make it even worse, the rook looks like he‚Äôs an EU region hopper (or NA if OP is in EU)
---
P90 is good imo one of the first guns I actually enjoyed
---
Yeah it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm not gonna expect for this game to be perfect and toxic free, but shit at least fix the matchmaking system for platinum and low ranks queueing together
---
You live a risky life

Nice you edited it.

Yuck, but oh well what can I do? have fun train man

No dlc ops challenge?

Wacc. But seriously the shield desync is really bad
---
you died thats wat happened
---
Not a woosh and you spelled it wrong.
---
I only have it for the revolver. All I need.
---
Usually end up plat 3 (or around that) on console while solo queuing. Not the best, not the worst
