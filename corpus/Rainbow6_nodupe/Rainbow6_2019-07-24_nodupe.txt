So basically we’ve learned that ash is a master baiter?

Flair checks ou - oh, oh wait, no it doesn't... Hmm
---
Literally in countless games the same thing happens: where the game freezes and won't fix it self until you back out. This exact same thing happens to me and my teammates, and other randomers we party up with. If it ain't a ddos what is it? Because I've posted on this issue on r/siegeacadamy there's multiple youtube videos on it?
---
You can play on the one one I’m custom games
---
Oh shit, thanks for reminding me, i gotta add him real quick :)
---
Cheers N0tAMuffin, means alot.
---
What is this, an overwatch cue?
---
Did you have too get at least 1 head shot my friend wants to know and I havent been able to play
---
That would be interesting, removing disorientation would make him way more palatable in ranked but the plant denial is exactly why he's hated in PL. I think removing plant denial would shift him into more of a fragging role which is where I think he belongs but we can agree to disagree.
---
I was watching and Im like “Thats rook what are you talking about??” *Watches again* “Wtf thats still roo.....oh shit a flying recruit”

No you cant

Disable them for Kapkan's traps. There's no way a Kapkan can intentionally use them to TK.

i wish i had that black ice for her shotgun cause it's my favorite, right now i've got it for the 9mm c1
---
Let’s agree to disagree ;D
---
This is the one black ice I want, and I despise Ash
---
k/d doesn't matter, especially when you're in bronze/silver. as long as you're winning and doing your job you're fine
---
... Wait, but then my reply won't make sense!!! Aaahhh
---
Because then the whole sub would be memes and it wouldn't be helpful to anyone. I'm sure there's r6 meme subreddit somewhere. If not you should make one
---
I feel like kd doesn’t reflect skill in r6. Its more team play and how you strategize and work with operators and their gadgets. This isn’t cod where kd matters. But ya i would say bronze and silvers have around .7 to .9 kd. I have been playing since beta and been plat every season since velvet shell and I have a 1.1 because it’s hard as shit to get my kd up after playin hundreds of matches
---
But we don’t have to live with it. Push back against these things and they go away. Like cash machine charges and needing a minimum amount of money in a bank account or be fined. We pushed back and now we have a better life
---
i'm not gonna lie. I prefer old hereford

In a related previous comic, someone posted a comment that the tub should be filled with shock drones instead. It also could have been another similar comment involving shock drones too.

I dunno how to make a reddit page that’s the problem

It doesn’t look like you were attacked with denial of service of service. It just looks like your internet cut out. A denial of service attack would cut out your internet for a while. If the server was attacked you would not have got a ban.

Maverick

Imagine leaving the house
---
Pro-gamer move
---
Great name my guy.
---
But that’s a fight not worth fighting since there are much more drastic problems which need to be dealt with even limiting that on siege
---
Ah yes I remember about that one.
---
In the original post the OP said he stood in that pose for less than 30 seconds.
---
Still not a smart thing to do though.
---
Aw shut I was away, was this a new universal skin?
---
Can I still get it even though I don’t have the ops?
---
How is it not worth upvoting and saying. I agree. 
---
For them to change it is deleting a page :/
---
just know he was probably top of the top people being toxic. and that's probably why. granted there might be some accidentally banned, but that's almost impossible to repeal unless you're a popularly known in the community.
---
Not enough people hate on Consulate and I won't stand for this.
---
What is this sub I love it
---
I’m gonna love getting rushed by this /s. Jokes aside it’s not a bad bundle and the uniform has decent colors.
---
Bandit also doesn’t have much bundles
---
nope not a troll its stupid fun
---
Nice
---
There is currently no way to hack or mod Rainbow Six on PS4
---
[removed]
---
depends what you like to play. they all have nice guns
---
but from those 3 i'd go mav
---
that's looks real good. Not sure if you care at this point but you may be able to get the colour you want if you stain it with some regular tea bags .
---
Yeah I would go Maverick. Nomad has a unique ability but Maverick is the most useful

I just had this happen on coast line but was stuck looking at wall. After that round it was fine but the whole round that's all I could see

This has happened to me as well

It’s called shitty rainbow 6

People are gonna bitch blitz into the ground ;-;

Fuck

What??
---
I haven't played in like 3 days, what was the challenge?
---
Is it you? Are you the DDoser?
---
I like the idea personally, but I do think it might offend some people. But what do I know
---
I wish I could experience the silver days, I haven't been above bronze 3
---
They never made it on mac
---
He's right.
---
He's obviously joking xD guys chill
---
Some times I get no audio for shots or lions scans or fuze’s Launcher. Sometimes I get no audio for reinforcing walls or barricading.
---
Quick question how long have you been playing?
---
I have it on thermite's AR
---
please remove club house, hereford base, skyscraper, oregon, and theme park. Absolute trash maps
---
I-3 shots doesn’t mean crud whenever people shoot an automatic weapon at your head lol. Honestly think about... you usually die as BB anyways because if you stay in a spot just to try head glitching a window you’ll die, due to being stuck in place for two seconds after your shield is gone and two seconds can make a difference.
---
The vent goes into the bar in the room next to 2F Billiards site.

Recently I've been experiencing a lot of "clans" on xbox. There'll be 3-4 people on the team (both mine or the enemy's) with matching gamertags, and they'll team-kill the people who don't have a gamertag like theirs. I know there might not be any solid ways to fix this, but it's been a frequent issue for me.
---
The fact they haven't fixed this stupid spot speaks volumes of how shit Fortress is.
---
Thank you
---
The rising of the German Hero
---
then why bring it up
---
Tell that to the 416-C lol
---
I knew they'd at least give it to the people that participated, so I got 1 headshot and never touched that mode again.
---
You ain’t got the answers!
---
I mean i got to mid gold solo queue soooooo idk, playing with friends makes it a lot easier though.
---
Pretty sure my last 10 packs have all be white, with skins for ops I dont play, or weapons I dont use
---
Thanks man.  Idk where the downvotes came from but there sure are a lot of them...
---
What's the answer?
---
But then when you knife someone and seem to hit them dead on it just doesn’t register
---
If you can make it to mid gold solo queueing, you’ll make it even further with mates, trust me.
---
fortress is way better than shit like border, oregon, skyscraper, and club house
---
If you don’t play the craft you get the shaft
---
It's absolutely fucking ridiculous that it took them THIS LONG to fix rank disparity in ranked. I'm not going to kiss their ass for something that should've been done a long time ago. Coding is hard and all but surely this wouldn't be too hard to implement?
---
Ok awesome I was just wondering for these three days in specific. But yeah I did my part :)
---
Oh i know, i was in plat 2 with friends, gold is just where i sit when i solo q
---
Chalet is one of the best maps in the game
---
Just people bandwagoning on downvoting comments, same way “lmao” got a hundred upvotes lol
---
You use the Irish charm, a fellow man of culture
---
Something like that, the Beta youtubers/reviewers got early access to still had the Raven/Spear and old icons. The open beta most definitely used the one in your clip.
---
Oh i know i was plat 2 with friends but gold is where i sit when i solo q
---
Sorry. You’re gonna have to sacrifice or you’re friend has to improve. The gap between Plat and Bronze is so astronomically large.
---
Really i checked and its not for free i participated
---
Today i queued up into ranked on destiny 2 and someone started naming off everyone's location around the world and literally asked if he wants us to boot anybody off the servers and we all asked him not to respectfully and he actually listened and as I'm typing this I know it sounds ridiculous but I swear to you he was a really nice dude but he's only downfall was being a ddoser. 
---
He was good enough to be on the top of the leaderboard at the end of the match and even told us the process to being able to ddos and what we can do to avoid it and honestly it was a wholesome experience in a really dark place of time. 
---
Imagine sitting down with a monster and being able to ask questions about how the process works that would more likely then not usually effect you?
---
It was surreal but also a good experience to learn from.
---
I don't want to explain how someone would ddos anybody but lets just say its surprisingly stupid.
---
Oh, take Black Ops 2 or Minecraft. They've been cracked open in literally every way possible.
---
I think you could redo this without bringing the whole diabetes thing into it as it seems like you are inadvertently insulting people. The concept seems interesting but the delivery of the concept seems inappropriate, at least to me. Nice idea though, and if you have more ideas check out r/r6operatorcreator
---
That happens a lot to me. 😞
---
I always love me some dRone porn
---
Well i just looked  into the winrate in pro league and the only site that was really defender sided was aviator also i dont see what is unbalanced about the map, you have enough places to breach enough places to hide on site and i never really have any problems on attack or defense
---

---
Halloween 2018, no longer obtainable.
---

More like the whole community defends a broken ass game. I'm not saying that this is the case with every video but hitreg doesn't work sometimes and that's just a fact.
---
Ectoplasm or something like that. It was the Halloween exclusive, you can’t get it anymore
---
thanks
---
Do you know if it's a glitch or something?
---
That’s how balancing works tho. If something is balanced at the highest level of play, it will be balanced for the rest. Not the other way around. Pros/Diamonds know way more about map balancing than the average player.
---
Afaik this has to do with who fills the team first, meaning players with bad connection always get sent to blue team, which attacks first and fills last.
---
This could actually improve his shield, then you won’t have to worry about the enemy seeing your shield before your face due to the shield length.
---

I thought about this as an elite skin but hey, a 18 yo jacket on a 50 yo man that makes graffiti Is better.
---
Oh yeah I had that happen the game before that bs with thatcher. Should've got Monty but noo
---
wtf are you on lol
---
border clubhouse and oregon are some of the best and most competitive maps in the game, even though oregon got removed from pro league this season. fortress and skyscrapper are shitty maps 
---
are u copper lol idk how u can dislike border and clubhouse
---
No u
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the loot system was prng and compensated for recent drops
---
How slow your prone sensitivity is
---
Smh my head
---
That made me have 0 kill to finish
---
I feel like siege attracts a lot of toxic people. I remember way back when I first tried the game how I would just get teamkilled or votekicked for being a noob every game, which actually led me to not play it again for a few months until a friend forced me to play with him. So I agree toxic people can really ruin how other people experience the game.
---
That is very depressing
---
You can build it to scale. Every block in Minecraft is 1 meter so go around the map in r6 and ping from one wall to the other and it’ll show how far away it is in meters.
---
Idk if you did it already or not or if it’ll even look good but it’s just a suggestion for future maps.
---
I like Gridlock.
---
Good utility for watching your flank
---
Strong weapon with lots of ammo
---
Good sight
---
Super Shotty for opening walls
---
Breach charges
---
Ik 😥
---
Not from a balancing standpoint.
---
what challenge?
---
Honestly
---

The arcade machine had the season pass. I don't have all year one ops on my acct but when I play on my grandpa's Xbox( he got season pass)I get the 3 I don't own. Plus a ton of skins and such.
---
Yay? Except I don’t even play the Korean ops let alone own one.
---
Nope i started being bronze 2
---
You get there
---
Probably so it wouldn't completely obscure your peripheral vision/give better head cover since real rifle shields have that gap in the middle.
---
True.

That would be what a 4 stack is, 4 people stuck together in a party

That’s when you have to break out Lord Tachanka. It never fails

I mean warden is better at higher level of play assuming they do a smoke and flash rush but there are spots where warden works like server stairs on bank or basement and white stairs on Oregon. Nokk is a joke she don’t even have an AR and her gadget can be useful assuming any cam ops are played.

At least use some damn high heat paint.

I didn't paint it lol, it was the previous owner. I wanted to get a normal black Scar H, but this one has a black upper and tan lower, so I'll probably just end up having it cerakoted like you said, although it'll definitely a hell of a lot more expensive.
---
And if you take time out of your day to respond to said response even though you clearly know it’s a waste of time to respond then I consider that a win.
---
Checkmate.
---
What does "participated" mean? I got 1 headshot. Yes, yes I know. You're welcome for the contribution.
---
No. He's just someone who is pissed off that Ubisoft developers can't seem to do their jobs correctly and 4 years later we still have endless glitches and bugs. I agree with him.
---
My whole life is a waste of time so I’m not wasting any extra time to respond technically. It’s really just math tbh

Bug, restart and it should sort itself out.

I agree with that, Cap in S is a fat plus on this list. One of the few lists that properly recognizes him as an incredible operator after his buff.
---
Would it be a crazy idea to give some admin abilities to community leaders/streamers so they can insta-ban cheaters like this on the spot? Obviously their use of these powers would be reviewed and insta-revoked should they be abused...
---
“No rushin”
---
Kd doesnt prove how many kills you get, of how good you are. Kd proves how long you stay alive essentially
---
The biggest event you missed was operation health. Seriously though, isn't the Lion Finka event the first real event in the game? I can't remember any that were before that.
---
4 months 200 hrs
---
Nah I play in the states
---
I personally like them a little but I do agree if they would make small changes to some sites but kept that main flow of the map I think it would be great.
---
But his gadget is literally a squad/gadget killer. He’s the only attacking operator with a gadget that can destroy all traps and gadgets in a room. Plus he can take out a squad by himself with just 2 of his cluster charges.
---
At 102? Bad luck, hopefully you've been getting better skins
---
Maybe you should have read the rules before posting?
---
If you want a non competitive playlist play casual.
---
You lucky son of a bitch
---
I know, just still in the shocked phase of how different the games are. I’m also going to have a problem of balancing playing on PC, and playing games on my PS4 as the PS4 is where my friends are. My one IRL friend is on PS4, but he is looking at building a PC like me. It’s going to suck leaving all my PS4 friends behind though.
---
Remember, no Echo
---
Nah mines twitches auto
---
Yeah I didn't like it. Every match played out the same.
---
Oregon and Chalet were primarily cut from the ESL map pool due to the site rotation rule, you are almost forced to play either kitchen or tower in Oregon for example by current rules, which isn't the case in Ranked where the amount of matches with those bombsites played is minimal. I'd agree for a small rework ala Club House to make these bombsites more playable, but the map isn't bad at all right now.
---
Bruh
---
fuckin hell, man. every time *I* play casual it's against a 5-stack of plats warming up for ranked.
---
Lol .... im that ash 😭😭

Thank you!

Hello HuddywitaHoodie, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ch31wz/us_west_xbox_rainbow_6_siege_custom_matches/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Just “Bruh”
---
I'm sure the anti-cheat should be smart enough to differentiate between "oops I accidentally did a glitch" compared to "many everygame, this glitch is hunting me."
---
I agree with gadget clearing but it’s kinda canceled out by Jager being like a 90% pick rate in high levels. The squad killing ability dies out and I find kills unusual. I think a C tier would be better as of now, but I just don’t think Fuze is anywhere near as good as he used to be after his gadget and shield nerf, and players growing with time played.
---
G36 skin is actually pretty cool.
---
It was kind of hard to just leave some friends behind and I still do get on my ps4 just to hang out but I am in high school and built my computer and realized most of my IRL friends had computer and didn’t realize it until then. I also met a lot of people in rainbow six siege just to have a full group of chill people so I don’t have to deal with all the toxic teammates.
---
BLYATTT

Rip meme got stolen in 3 mins

Montagne sucked at the start of siege. His shield was smaller so he couldn't sit in corners. Also he couldn't tank a nitro back then, he would die as gf he was any other op.

u shot left of her head, only hit her once
---
There was a few small ones before that but there's was definitely one of the biggest that 1 was outbreak the 1 I wanted to play the most but about a week late to buying the game and I ended up missing it
---
First three I’m considering buying besides base ops
---
I got a total of 1 headshot :)
---
Very nice 👍
---
i hate the way you play. unless it’s casual why would you peak that and roam with doc. 
---
actual explanation: you hit his back/shoulder and the bullets go above the acog so it looks like you headshot her but you actually aimed all around her head. nothing to do with ping or anything just recoil. 
---
edit: it’s night time so it’s cas. i forgive you
---
Yea. Just get used to the controls and start playing from there. Find out who you're good with (even tho you should prob know that already) and start taking it seriously (if u want)

It was a hellscape out there, but I pulled through.

Hahaha thanks. I still have a long ways to go
---
I'm not sure about Nokk replacing anyone overall esepecially when she doesn't provide any utility for her team. Nokk doesn't replace other anti-roamer ops and Pros don't pick them often to begin with. Lesion is a pretty hard counter and he gets picked pretty often. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Warden, I feel like I can see him being picked to counter the smoke/flash planting but it's hard to imagining him being picked over the other Top 10 Defenders.
---
wdym prohibiting me from speaking
---
I have 3 friends who either have, want, or are planning on building a computer. 
---
One has a computer, he just has a life and a gf.
---
One is planning on building one, he just needs a job.
---
Another wants one, but he also has a life and idk what he does in his free time. He earns a bunch of money, but idk where it all goes. 
---
I am also in highschool.
---
No. You could literally hit a headshot from a million kilometres away (if the game engine allowed that)
---
The chances would probably be 1 in a trillion or whatever, but it could happen.
---
oh
---
It's decent. Three perfectly playable bombsites, different attacking alternatives, good roaming capability but also not hard to counter if you coordinate a little. Good vertical play but not overwhelming for defenders, good rotations with 3 stairs, it's at the perfect point regarding size where it's kinda big but not as big as say Villa, Hereford, Fortress or Bank. There's way worse maps to get rid of first.
---
you shouldn’t have played aggressive on defense when the bomb wasn’t planted and you could have used jackal’s location to figure out where he’d peek you from
---
Oh my f**king god did not know that im ps4 thats amazing news
---
You'll get to play it when you buy Quarantine next year! :p
---
Castles skin is sick, what do you mean?
---
Sounds like aim bot propaganda, but ok.
---
I’ll look into it.
---
Yeah I’m annoyed that Ubisoft hasn’t even looked into this type of stuff.
---
like how do you know you just don't
---
I bet you're a fun person to be around
---
Jesus fucking Christ ubi fix your
---
they’re LITERALLY cheating first which is the reason to my dumb logic that I use mnk, you can’t ban smurfs who ruin the fun for us golds so why tf not ruin their fun and every other player in this toxic ass community. yep I’m hurt
---
I play with controller though. I just don't get why you're having a hissy fit over it? Just deal with it and move on
---
Haha yeah i dont know how i did it
---
Does it only not work for siege?
---
Fuze kills hostag xd gib updoot
---
Oh gosh, this happens to me too! I plug in my headphones with a mic, the PC recognizes it, but I can’t talk through it. It really pisses me off.
---
I would also like to mention you are the definition of the R6 community. Being an asshat to everyone.
---
I literally had a convo telling the other team how trash they are and they just responded with lol and so and MnK is harder to use than controller 😭😭😂😂
---
Hahahahaha fuze the hostage bro hhahahaa
---
This stopped being funny over 2 years ago
---
Well, "this type of idiot" got a free kill, so  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
*laughs in you’re welcome*
---
meh, I can buy new seasonal universals and new ops with renown, I'm ok with that.
---
Loved it. Great soundtrack. Rotten tomatoes 98%
---
How convenient.
---
Just tired of it a whole TEAM of MnK on console it’s just sickening people pay money to get an edge on console because they’re are honestly so bad. It’s cheating🤷🏻‍♂️
---
yup I don’t care, smurfs ruin the fun of this game. the fact that people are completely okay with plats slaughtering real coppers and silvers show how pathetic this community is. in return I went mnk to get to my plat 2 (: y’all can try to find my username and ban me but I love what I do!
---
Wait, defenders attacking Area 51?
---
I don’t get it. You just got outskilled. Like your honestly horrible at the game to let him do that to you
---
22 with pre nerf ela and blackbeard on bank, I literally just ran around and killed people while all 4 of my teammates sat back and watched.

Yeah happens to me very often goddammit

Hmmm weird

Silver 4 uses m&amp;k to get to plat 2. You’re dog shit
---
Let me introduce you to something called the Snipping Tool my friend.
---
sounds like me
---
I don’t get it..
---
I mean their not necessarily wrong only certain people are good with mnk that's why you see so many more potatoes on pc
---
There's literally nothing they can do.
---
Now you will... No, but seriously. Great skin!
---
Oh I didn’t realize I was the one bitching lmao
---
I've been trying to edit some other ace but the editor is fuckin weird.
---
You seem incredibly defensive for some reason. You should calm down.
---
there's nothing they can do. 3rd party adapters aren't detectable, deal with it &amp; move on like the rest of us or find a different game.
---
They have. It's not that simple. It's an adapter that mimicks a controllers input. Basically you plug a keyboard into the adapter and your controller; from there and input you send from MnK is translated to the corresponding controller input... The software is also kept updated so that it can remain harder to detect.
---
Hoes mad

LOOK MAN MY AIM AIN'T GREAT SO IF I HAPPEN TO LAND A HEADSHOT IN MY BONER PISS SPRAY THEN IT BETTER WELL FUCKING COUNT
---
this post was sponsored by the copper iv gang
---
nice
---
Well I have it on ur dad omegalul
---
Waaaaalll offfff teeeeeeeeeeext.
---
*I'm in this video and I don't like it*
---
and I see you’re a smurf yourself pathetic. I deserve a cookie while smacking you good ol smurfs!
---
Well when I see you in ranked I’ll be sure to t-bag your dead body
---
facts
---
I can't handle these mental gymnastics.
---
JUST BECAUSE A MINORITY WAS A DICKHEAD TO YOU DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD HOP ON BOARD AND BE A DICKHEAD AS WELL
---
19-3 in a ranked against golds, I’m silver 1. Good job though ;)
---
Do I get it for getting headshotted instead of getting a headshot?
---
That dude should be diamond
---
restarting the game works for me...but yeah it has been happening more frequently now, very annoying...
---
DEJA VU I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
---
Did... you actually just upload a 3 minute round?
---
You choose the most viable sites. By picking an awful objective, you put yourself at a bigger disadvantage. There is a reason those sites are not favored.
---
you do that while I’m on my road diamond 👍 pathetic ass smurf
---
Bruh the fact you didn’t reload gave me anxiety
---
bruh 💪💪🙌🙌🔥🔥
---
Unlucky.
---
It’s what I do, I just upload awesome stuff that happens to me in the game
---
Rank doesn’t determine your skill, it determines the skill of your teammates
---
Who the fuck doesnt like coastline?
---
Favela: Has too much soft destruction, especially when you add 3 hard breachers and 2 soft breachers like buck and zofia into the match. On rooms with split bomb sites the team physically doesnt have enough reinforcements to cover the two rooms.  Spawn runout(not peeks) are fairly easy and short compared to other maps. 
---
Yacht: Not enough vertical play, similar to tower most rooms have hard floor and rotations are limited to long hallways which can be easily ambushed. On release it used to have a lot of performance issues due to the snow effects.
---
New Hereford: Its only the top floor. The other floors are fine. It just needs more access for the attackers other than having to attack from either windows or stairs.
---
My smurf is for playing with my friends who suck, sometimes I’ll use it to solo queue and see how far I can get. The fact that you take something that’s done in every game as cheating, even though smurfing has been deemed ok by Ubisoft, makes you a loser.
---
This man out here flexing with his duplicate black ice meanwhile i still have none after playing since launch
---
Why would you want it on the g36c though?
---
so I should let myself get smacked by those high plats and not have fun with this game? sometimes you gotta do what’s best ones self
---
You start out with a condescending and mocking tone coupled with a supercilious attitude, and then get offended when called out for acting like exactly what I stated? Say what now?
---
That's literally how you're supposed to play Ash though. If you are unironically using the g36c on her you're retarded.
---
Me and my Xbox squad used to do the recruit rush 4 from the front 1 from the back used to work like a charm I miss those days before fortnite ruined my life
---
Sad man 🤦🏻‍♂️ people have to cheat in order to win smh
---
*son of whore*
---
Would the operator be fat? Lol sorry I'm a dick. Downvote me into oblivion :(
---
get better instead of cheating. You’re what’s toxic pal. If you’re not diamond already using m&amp;k you’re the embodiment of trash.
---
Lol “hoes mad” that’s originalbud
---
If you think I'm going to watch a 3 minute video of nothing happening you're delusional.
---
An HK416 is piston so that might minimize the possibility of a jam. But the issue is rate of fire. Shooting ~600-800 rounds a minute means only at the very best your doing 400 in 30 seconds, so unless you have a 400 round mag it is not happening.
---
You cheat but still, STILL you can’t get diamond, lol get better 😂
---
Elites: allow us to introduce ourselves
---
Hahaha!
---
Alright, so who the fuck made his gun only take in 5.45mm.
---
I prefer some of the originals better just because they are better structured maps 
---
I hate house btw and I hate new Hereford 
---
Year 1 dlc maps are all good except yacht 
---
Year 2 all good except te spanish one and tower
---
Year 3 all good except new Hereford 
---
Year 4 is good so far but the Aussie map feels not so fresh
---
Level 69. Nice.
---
good job for admitting you boost. I know it’s done in every game that’s why I can’t enjoy any games without these toxic players mopping us non expert players. welp another reason why Ubisoft is shit!
---
That plays a significant part in coloring your opinion. PC has better recoil control and accuracy over all. Playing on Console like me shield ops are a nightmare to play against unless you have a Nitro and even then its not garaunteed that you can kill them.
---
Vector: a villan
---
ight
---
awesome
---
The thing is.. Po ur in the wrong. Why tf would you take the opinion of a 10K hours pro player when cjthereadheaddj is telling you something different. It really disgusts me when I see people like you comepletely discrediting the opinions of a random nobody and instead supporting people like Pengu. What has Pengu done besides been on the team that has pioneered the meta? Exactly. Learn your place.
---
What about the construction?
---
Oh that is horrendous.
---
Are you saying this is undeserved?
---
great work
---
I used a cement texture I found on wikimedia commons and a badge from the r6 wiki. I could probably do a Spetsnaz one if you have any ideas for a background texture
---
Look at his last ranked session for example, if he played Fuze he must have stomped, cuz he went 9 in 15 and lost. Yet you have the audacity to call Fuze bad?
---
Do you really want lose assoult rifle in def side?
---
Please don’t trust everything u see on the Internet
---
I feel like the same texture would be good
---
No casual has different rule sets,  less rounds,  and also not all maps either way, so its pointless.
---
I mean it's true. I am that bad teammate
---
i'll try, i basically just centered the badge and cropped to 16:9.
---
&gt;Either I pop off while my team just acts like they’ve never played before or I get hard carried by some suspicious players.
---
That pretty much describes the whole gold rank on ps4. :D
---
Suspicious player being either a) legit good or b) Mouse/KB user (especially in Gold 1)
---
Fuck you, OP, for making me think there was a hair on  my screen for like, more seconds than I care to admit.
---
Yes because it’s not balanced to give jager a already good defender a amazing gun.
---
Or give Nokk the Honey Badger with no access to an ACOG.
---
Your friend seems charming.
---
"Did I win?"
---
Putin is the one who told me, I don't use the internet.
---
Thanks a lot
---
U trynna throw hands with me or something
---
No, personally I think this is what sets apart good players from shit ones (so long as the anger isn't excessive and is channeled into a productive effort to improve). Posts like this make me laugh when I go into the comments to see so many people bitching about hit reg. 1500 hours in this game and I have never had a headshot that was on target miss unless I was getting excessive lag, because hitreg isn't actually broken and people just suck and don't want to accept the fact that maybe they made a mistake. Every time I die in this game I blame myself, and ask myself what I could have done differently to prevent it, and I think I've been able to reap the benefits of this mindset.
---
can tell it's before phantom sight because someone's actually using glaz
---
[it's definitely broken for me](https://youtu.be/oDuY9VPg5f4), my friend told me he has same problem with AK12
---
Idk the fmg seems like a good gun for nøkk because she's meant to be a sneaky up close and personal operator. So a light weight high rpm gun  seems like a perfect fit.
---
P.S. and the holographic is neat
---
Burn
---
I can't even find what you're trying to say in the urban dictionary.
---
Patch notes: replaced bullet proof glass with plastic wrap
---
I like Nokk. There. I said it.
---
Her guns are fun and her ability as well especially while soloing. I really don't think she needs a buff right now.
---
when you know that you've play too long and have almost every skin XD
---
How it works. I only gotten maybe 5 legendaries and 2 were Rook's hat. I like it though, so can't complain, it's the only cosmetic I've ever had people message me complimenting too.
---
I get where your coming from but it just feels lacking in damage
---
I always go no ban just so everyone gets to play whoever they want
---
Yea but 9000 ping that drops to 28 will move you too fast. Same with ping issues on teleport bad pun can be a "teleport".
---
I'm positive that I used 0 slurs ever in my life.
---
As for toxicity that depends, I TK people who pick Tchanka in close games if we lose a round and they keep picking it, I stuck up for myself in chat to people who are assholes.
---
Given context I'd say I'm 1000x better behaved than him, without context if you just saw a chat log of things I've said, yes I'm better as in no slurs but you'd see arguments and banter.
---
Cant because possible glitches in the game could give false positives.
---
Do you watch pro league? I strictly play casual and for fun but will sometimes tune into the pro leagues when they're on YouTube. You can pick up strats from there. Also build a team. Communication is key to winning at siege, I believe.
---
I play ps4 and this happens to me all the time. I have a clip of me getting fully kicked from the game because I got 4 kills. I didn’t steal any kills, hurt teammates, or even take out any team gadgets. I don’t know why this is going on but it’s a problem for me.
---
It is true sometimes
---
Especially on console
---
There are a lot of people who get boosted to diamond and the since they already for sure get the charm they just solo queue and they are completely terrible.
---
Aim. My aim is very bad for my ranking. I just spray and pray and it works. Any tips on how to reliably aim well?
---
Probably end of Augustish
---
The only way what you’re saying would be true is if they blew the opposite wall on karaoke site and flanked stepped back to be the same distance as his friend at drum door.
---
King George : why are you booing me
---
WAS.
---
Hereford too was, but even the new one isn't in PL. Sh*t is always removed from PL.
---
tbh the gamemode wasnt that bad. i really enjoyed playing it, got like 50 headshots.
---
Add the window that leads from showers to outside, it's just a wall right now
---
Well a pack is 5000, and duplicates give you between 300 and 1300ish, and a legendary something like 4500. Would take a lot of duplicates for it to give you another pack.
---
It's funny that way
---
It's a shame. The map looks beautiful but has a lot of balance issues.
---
My people need meeeee
---
Thank the Lord.
---
Only 1 viable sure, bad layout, too many hatches for basement.
---
&gt;However, I came to realize that she is underwhelming at the moment and Ubi’s own data supports her being the second worst Attacker.
---
and you already deliver the reason for it.
---
&gt;every other Attacker offer more for the team in general
---
I'm with you here. I'd rather play IQ when it's getting serious.
---
Maybe she'll see more play later. In our cam meta she ain't the worst to begin with.
---
Okay, I’ll check it out. I love seeing other players and interacting with them. And when I can help out someone get recognition for something then it’s the best feeling.
---
I have some tips on how to improve your KD in ranked. Some of the tips will apply to aim as KD requires aim which leads to kills. I can pm you the link for my channel if you feel like that would help.
---
I don't know if the topic of diabetes is the way to go but tampering with operator stats is actually something that would be cool to see in a gadget.
---
Lord tachanka I’m assuming.

Hello PoundcakeR6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ch57zw/so_i_did_the_weapon_skin_swap_thing_for_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Pretty sure ubisoft haven't given them the permission to operate and distribute the 1.0 version of the game.
---
Thanks so much dude!
---
Nope. Enlighten me.
---
Me
---
Anything that will help. I’m trying to get all of the achievements in rainbow but I need gold rank and that’s not gonna happen without good aim.
---
He took away mine and my brother's acog, so, no. Fire Lord Capitão is my lord and saviour.
---
Isn't it a mobile only thing tho?
---
Probably, yes.
---
No problem. I love helping out people. It can make someone’s day and something’s it helps me out too!
---
Around 9 or 10 am depending on what platform you play. They haven't announced the times yet but its always around those times.
---
This shit always happens when I'm repelling from the coastline penthouse window...some guy always runs out and either gets shot or dies to a claymore.
---
Fuckin agreed
---
It is toxic mostly because morons think it's funny or trashy people think it's normal.
---
.......said nobody ever.
---
I love helping people too, seeing their gratitude over something you’ve done is so satisfying to me.
---
Yeah, I stopped using the Skorpion after the recoil nerf.
---
Also, her shotgun is pretty nuts and her pistol is a headshot machine. So I guess Ela can be used in the short-est of ranges.
---
I hoped they would make the skorpion kind of like the P90 (low recoil but also low damage) and instead went with the idiotic recoil nerf. Shame.
---
Called a joke, you’ll learn
---
I am very curious how (if) Pros will use her though. 
---
While it’s true that couple of pros seem to call her a bad pick, I can see her being picked as a surprise at least once. 
---
If not, I guess that means she might get more buffs since Ubi probably won’t let her stay that low in win rate.
---
Fun Fact: The Area at the very front of Yacht is actually titled "King of the World"
---
“pathetic” - all Recruit mains ever.
---
I mean.......the data actually shows her to have the second highest win delta despite having the highest win rate....so.....idk.
---
“Pathetic” - all recruit mains ever.
---
I feel the same way, though I do like the Secret Star skin from this season.
---
You have 3 options! 
---
1) Don’t play siege or any popular FPS game.
---
2) Mute everyone in game and turn off chat.
---
3) Deal with it without complaining like the rest of us.
---
What about the whole online season? 
---
Only the PL finals are LAN if I remember correctly
---
Everything on Cav looks amazing but that suppressor though!
---
Damn I only got nøkk and smoke black ice
---
That was a big brain move
---
Lmao this guy got more valuable stuff in 22 seconds than i got in 2 years
---
The room is more commonly known as Aquarium
---
Legendaries should not be duplicates
---
Wait has she been brought back?
---
From this year, yes. For ops released in previous years you’ll need to buy those separately:
---
LoL wtf
---
In this year yes
---
ESL has a ruleset for R6s which you can see here for Challenger League, PL should be the same: [https://play.eslgaming.com/rainbowsix/europe-pc/r6siege/major/challenger-league/season-10-qualifier-1/rules/](https://play.eslgaming.com/rainbowsix/europe-pc/r6siege/major/challenger-league/season-10-qualifier-1/rules/)
---
About Ping it states this:
---
 1.1.3.4. High Ping 
---
The ping limit for an ESL match is 130 ms. If a player is over this value please try to do a re-host first, before a protest is opened and make sure a dedicated server was created. In case the player still has a ping over 130 ms and it's not possible to play the match without there being problemss, a protest can be opened. It can only be counted as high ping if the ping is continuously over 130 ms and the necessary evidence is provided. When opening a protest due to high ping the match must **not** be finished and the team must submit at least three screenshots of the scoreboard which were taken at different times over two rounds with the high ping visible from the same player (in the action phase!).
---
I know both variants, depending on the field. I'm usually speedsofting so running only a pistol doesn't make too much of a difference. That's where you're usually out with weapon hits, becaus you'd otherwise wouldn't really be at a relevant disadvantage. Also who cares, 30 seconds in spawn and you can go in again
---
Yeah just for this season. So you’d get mozzie, gridlock, nokk and warden and the other 4 when they get released.
---
Common he is Gold and antoher one platin, maybe he had a few bad days.
---
Copper, bronze, silver fully acceptable but Gold should be OK and nothing to cry about.
---
Ok thanks I meant this year.
---
In my understanding, the whole point is to be able to brag about it to others.
---
When they tell they're the equivalent of grandmaster in those games, they typically don't mention how the rank was achieved.
---
No its hacks /s
---
I really love this game
---
I am HongKongese, I can do lesion better 😂
---
Waiting for echo and vigil
---
I first thought this is ROBLOX in 2007...
---
Red foot?
---
alt + enter... literally all you have to do to change it back into Fullscreen
---
Yes every gun is
---
The Hostage, that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.
---
Could be worse, you could have gotten Birchwood.... Twice..... A day apart.... Like I did 🙃
---
That reverse corner push was evil
---
I was playing with friends.
---
Found out one of them was cheating apparently
---
Well you should've backed out
---
Same then you even watch the kill cam and there is blood spurting out of their face.
---
About the question.
---
Do you know anything?
---
Canister ?
---
*Smoke wants to know your location*
---
And they are about to get worse with the melee down instead of kill and increased hip fire spread.
---
Gonna start just jumping through windows as my new method of cluster charge denial
---
I see no barricades, utterly unplayable. 10/10 would bitch about again
---
I don't remember a nerf.
---
Charms such as those are reserved for players who play other ubi titles and  I think it should be that way. No point to get the charm somebody else got when they put in the time to play a different game. Even if they only did it for the charm or what be it. I also disagree that no duplicates should be initiated. I think crummy people will just sandbag games to play the losing percentage because it’ll net them higher. They still get renown doing it and they still get percentage with less effort. I’d say they should rework the percentages entirely and make them more transparent.
---
My first one was a legendary
---
It’s still ugly as shit. I didn’t participate, as I didn’t have access to my PC.
---
Enjoy the ban!
---
So that's at least 3 months for a shit-tier Operator to possibly become useful? Yeah, sounds nice.
---
They could just invite two good PL teams and have them play againts each other with Warden in use. Sounds better than waiting 3 months for him to appear in PL.
---
I honestly think it won't change anything. The community is mostly toxic and will probably stay that way.
---
I will thanks!
---
Impressive!
---
Really? I feel like the increase in IQ play makes him harder to use.
---
&gt; hereford 
---
I hate new Hereford with the same passion I used to hate Tower until it was finally taken out of Ranked.
---
A: sharpened pencil
---
yesyesyesyes
---
The lies, omg the lies.
---
 whats the actual video called? asking for a friend
---
Just set it as low as possible and it’s not a big deal
---
*inhales*
---
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
---
I agree with you, the secret star skin is the first seasonal skin ive bought in 2 seasons. I just feel like the ones we get now look decent on only a few guns but the older ones looked great on almost all guns
---
The fraggiest of fraggers
---
Now I need a Limited Time Mode that actually does that. Shit would be hilarious and change up the Siege-formula for a while in a big way.
---
teamkill, a double kill by hibana, and a kill by a Buck
---
thx bb
---
4 years late but better than never I guess
---
you're being toxic
---
OOF
---
No, I usually get a headshot
---
Fucking bullshit, I paid real money for the engraved skin pack for the SAS before you could buy them with renown and they happily changed the look of it completely and made it go from awesome to garbage (IMO)
---
why 250
---
Foxtrot

Fuze is the royal advisor. After all when one Russian isn't enough bring another one to even the odds
---
I've had every pass
---
I do it myself, but to be honest I don't know why
---
definitely. his gadget is easy to use and satisfying when you get a kill.
---
Oof. Guess its too late for the /s
---
I'm plat 3 and I still play fuze most of the time. His gun is just so amazing and his gadget allows me to easily dispatch of defender gadgets and clear obj for insertion. Fuze's gadget also allows for a lot of creativity
---
No just the big ones afaik.
---
Just like i did with my family
---
I just lost a ranked match because someone Tkd me for stealing their kill when they were on the other side of the map and downed. (Got killed the next round p)
---
Please allow stricter bans on people abandoning and team kills
---
btw sorry my photoshop skills aren't that good
---
Lol
---
Drop you ID bro
---
Hibana
---
I got a black ice pistol and I have 9 hours on the game.
---
nope only the ones coming out bro but its for a year not a season
---
oh, thanks. ... shit, that got away from me, i believe. :/
---
That gun at least has the ability to destroy a wall quickly
---
lol make a challenge, realize that the event is not as interesting as you thought it would be! fail the challenge yet give it away anyway. 
---
I'm not complaining about getting it for free,  but maybe make more interesting events with more unlockable cosmetics through playing the game. 
---
As a season pass owner who purchases it mainly as a support and appreciation for the continued support from dev team, i see very little "give back" from Ubi.
---
Good point, still has horrendous dps
---
Dude I the same thing but with 21 it's SO satisfying and also used Nokk and Valk for the degal  1 bangs
---
Honestly he is fine, the majority of ops have a much higher kill potential. He is slow slow, his gun requires a head shot to kill due to the DPS being so low, that most SMGs will out dps it.
---
It may feel kinda cheap that 'his shield is the only reason you died', doesnt mean he is OP. Look at blitz annoying to fight but overall a weak pick.
---
1 week ban sounds like this isn't an isolated incident. You may be out of luck.
---
Im sorry to hear that, at least you can still get damascus steel which is pretty much same skin
---
It makes sense, ash will probably sell the best
---
That seems like too much. Right now they clearly just want to throw garbage at us and I’m fine with it. Bundles won’t sell if people have a chance of getting parts for free

I'm on PS4 and it says press any.
---
Garage isn't very defender favouring. Hell, it is doom for defenders unless attackers are bad. The bar hatch, the big garage facing walls, trench, all expose the site too much and can be easily opened up for sightlines. All are also a Maverick's free real estate, so contesting is a huge problem
---
It has absolutely no free, protected rotation between sites, so because the only rotation between sites is blocked by fireplace stairs and bar hatch. One month and that safe planting zone near the garbage bins near the snowmobile is a guaranteed safe plant.
---
They desperately need to rework them.
---
No, that is much.  Well done!
---
It is much tho, don't downplay it. Great job!
---
Be careful, my friend had a shield too, but he dropped it and it broke :(
---
This is a feature where if you try to open an alpha pack in matchmaking, it won't let you (so you don't lose an item).
---
Defence boils down to "run out or lose" basically as attackers have outside walls/windows into every objective and multiple crossfires, even on the better defender sites.
---
Bruh no matter if we won or lost they gave us a skin, that’s dumb😂
---
Thanks, I'm so happy that I forgot to clip it with shadowplay
---
Good to know that you are trained in gorilla warfare. I'll call u next time my monkey escapes.
---
Or MCX Rattler with suppressor. 
---
Either way, I'd cry a tear of happiness.
---
I’m not very good with Mav either but he’s fun
---
Foxtrot. I'm not too worried because I have another 7 in the works and they're pretty cheap to make.
---
You’re not smart. They make a shit tonne of money from season pass and seasonal events. Giving one pack away with a blue reward every few weeks for a birthday challenge isn’t going to bankrupt ubisoft.

Siege has a great DLC system.. Any content you'd get in theost expensive edition cam also be obtained in the cheapest edition by playing the game. It's just a bit of a grind is all, not that bad.

All these posts about shit hitreg, broken shields and these fucking maps. And they call it an e-sport game. I was playing a lot of 3v3 with my friends lately, and out of at least 5 headshots the game registered 0. I ragequit and started playing Starcraft 2. Best decision of my life.
---
Fair point
---
YES PLEASE. Current birthday skins suck ass.
---
Tried it, it worked, suprisingly.
---
I'm playing on a Samsung Evo 960 SSD
---
To be fair, they have tried many times to fix teleport, but have always found new ways after a "fix".
---
We get there, but not yet.
---
same exact thing happened to me, I know for a fact I shot the head 2 times like it was close-ish range I had acog his head was dead centre, registered nothing
---
2 months of multiple reports, nothing...
---
As a hibana main, I approve 👌🏼
---
Yh man
---
thatcher does counter it but yeah usually you can play around that as the warden since you’re mobile. 
---
honestly I thought being immune to flashes would be a lot more useful than it’s turned out to be at least in my experience. Ying has a very low pick rate despite being one of the strongest attackers imo and the secondary flashbangs you can turn away from in most instances. Warden is best as a reactionary pick in the second round after a ying main decimates your team. He isn’t anything more than that imho
---
what happened after burnt horizon? new player here
---
Yes pls
---
teach me how
---
Hopefully you're not reacting to someone shooting you but rather seeing someone. Regardless, without the face shield you would just die to 3-4 mp5 bullets to the head anyway. BB doesn't need to block 10 bullets to the face to be balanced...

---
And people still trashtalk you if you are lower rank than diamond. Sorry for coming here with my gold, but I cannot do shit if the game decides to hate me.

Innit fam

Thought this too mate.

Exactly what i want, time for some fooking lasah soights then! :)
---
Jesus. That’s some damn willpower right there!

If voting was removed or changed with addition to team kill tracker would go a long way to stop it. The main reason people are being so toxic is that nobody is gonna touch them there and they have free reign over that team if they are at least a 2 or 3  but especially a 4 stack. I cannot tell you how many times I been kicked or team killed since the launch of the game. I think out of all my hours I have had two multi hour session of playing where I didn't see any toxicity and those were back in dust line and skull rain. Now I could never manage to play the game like that not have to worry about clutch or kick or people just being assholes to inflate their ego.
---
I don't feel cheated, because I don't care about it. The point I am making that the "goal" and "challenge" is fake and useless because you still get the reward whether or not you reach it.
---
I’ve got a pack of chocolate hobnobs if you want it
---
Damn i’d be mad if i got that. Im level 115 and i have a black ice for iq’s Aug and for GSH 18 and my best black ice is for MP5
---
20 black ice? Dude. I’m level 93 and just got my second one ever.. He’s lucky if he gets 1 in all of these packs!
---
C8 sfw or sasg take your pick 😂 not flexing I promise
---
haha yeah but i figured maybe some people did because it would be technically possible
---
That thing straight claps
---
Why there are guns floating in the air? WTF?
---
Hey guys! Let me share with you pic with my precious friend from Area the Fox with Echo cosplay! Unfortunately he doesn't have personal yet reddit account but you can find him in twitter/instagram :)

---
Well you have to download it on all phones
---
skyscraper its ok, they hate tower
---
old Hereford maybe?
---
LUL thanks
---
Lmao
---
The skins are better than the charms you used to get
---
They removed it because EVERYONE hated that map.
---
At that point I would imagine there's a lot less solo queuing
---
There are only map-preferences for terrorist hunt, and bartlett has been there since the rework if not mistaken.
---
So no, not gonna pop up in normal multiplayer
---
not what i am saying, and your comment sounds like you never have had somebody quick peek or rush you. 
---
if somebody does rush the shield counters peekers advantage
---
Exactly.
---
White*
---
No it says tachanka OP
---
They say you can’t hear images
---
The birthday skins are all bad in my opinion, this would work out alot better
---
I had a match where everyone had 3000+
---
You obviously deserved it, I mean Hibana Pistol Rly?
---
Nuh ubi is way too greedy
---
Hey ubisoft i'll give you an advice, instead of limiting matchmaking between different ranks what about try to do something about server booters? 90% of the ppl that play with smurf is because you just cant go higher than plat 2. If this keep on u wont reach year 5 on console.
---
That’s exactly the reason why i said that:D
---
You should livestream the openings when you finish it. Keep track of commons/uncommons/rares/dupes etc. And then post it here for unlimited karma
---
Oh that would be brilliant
---
I really don't see why this is not as simple as making barricade debris specifically have no collusion so it just falls to the ground 100% of the time for every player, or have it not exist at all until the issue is fixed.
---
I'd consider both of those enormously better than having such a large and annoying inconsistency which determains who kills who.
---
I'll be honest, I kinda like the skins they give us.
---
His heels are not no the ground... THIS IS NOT A TRUE SLAV SQUAT
---
Sorry for the low quality!
---
So why not put that in Cyrillic too, it would make it a better easter egg cause it would take more work to find
---
Elite skin confirmed 👌👌👌
---
*vote to kick initiated*
---
Killa
---
Did none of them see you? lol
---
*sound of barricade being ripped down*
---
*sound of barricade being put up*
---
&gt; Remove the client sided buggy debris that you get when you melee/shoot out the barricade as a way to 'FIX' the issue untill it is resolved
---
thats not how it works... physic animation and stuff like that is a bit different from setting the amount of gadgets a player has to '0', dont you think so?
---
69 upvotes noice
---
Yes please!!!🙏🏾
---
Looks good!
---
dewds, how do you get those wicked cool black cross hairs? I need them in my life
---
I had this issue too (and now again idk)
---
Right click on your network and click on "Netwerk en internetinstelligen openen", click on "Adapteropties Wijzigen", on the"Netwerkverbindingen" screen, right click on your network and click "Eigenschappen". Then disable the Ipv6 thingy (worked for me)
---
*Bill Gates Sounds*
---
I still use them to this day. But none of the dog tags or skins. Luison charm on cav's primary or nøkk is just the best.
---
Jagers gun under the game files and in his profile, is classified as a Assault Rifle. This means that his gun ignores the classic defender SMG fall off of close-high med-mid/low long-low damage. His gun has high damage all around and not only that his recoil is nearly neglectful so if fall off is your worry you can always run extended barrel. If we’re still on the point of Mira vs Jager, jagers minimum damage is 34 assuming he’s from the farthest distance in the game on a 3 armor. Not only that but his gun is chambered in 5.56 caliber ammo so that means that fall off damage through walls is minimal too. Mira’s gun has by far the lowest in the game with her minimal damage being ELEVEN (11). That’s wild. The only other assault rifle on defense is held by Mozzie, that is how you make a proper AR on defense (personally I think it should remain where attackers get ARS and defenders get SMGS but I digress) Mozzies gun does 36 damage MAX which means that Jagers gun at minimal is essentially performing at Mozzies best. Not only that but Mozzies gun has the same recoil pattern as the 416-C but has a lower fire rate 720
---
God I love Marley and all his videos😂😂😂
---
I would take an alpha pack over a stupid skin . That looks like 6 other i got
---
Early September most likely.

Shit tier operator with a rehashed loadout and ability concept*
---
Nobody:.......
---
Echo: YOKAI OUT... 
---
Nice coseplay btw 🤔🤔👍👍👍
---
&gt; and client side debris.
---
Which shouldn't be in the game.
---
Honestly, i'd be okay with shit just disappearing the moment it's destroyed if it mean we'd no longer have to suffer client side bullshit.
---
Hello somerandomlegend27, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ch90fw/ps4_sound_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Actually I do live stream sometimes but I don't have the best bitrate so when I actually go live it's all fuzzy also what does karma do?
---
Yea it totally sucks earning free things.....
---
Of course you would think that he keeps taking your drones
---
K
---
Well if the attacker sees the prisma/alibi from the side, he/she would know whether it's the real one or not
---
Simple, give it a cooldown
---
Why can't I ever find these players? That guy didn't even drone you!
---
Lul
---
Should they? Yes. 
---
Will they ever? No
---
I like the concept. He's basically a lesion but on attack, I feel like 3 grenades would be more balanced but that's just my opinion.
---
Ah. That explains it. Pretty much anybody who played buck frequently before the buff called it easy mode after the buff, but those who started playing the game/buck after the buff had to start from scratch, since his recoil is tuned to be higher due to balance issues, but still not the highest on attack (Maverick and hibana's are higher but a lot more consistent in the jump, but Buck's is inconsistent due to the lack of a grip).
---
You'll get there. Don't worry.
---
Yeah no idea what was up with that haha. You can see the pings at the end the connection was fine that game.
---
I play casual cuz I’m shit
---
Expect the unexpectable!
---
And there was a team kill... so mad over so little
---
you even down the ash without aiming for her
---
Region?
---
Totally lmao
---
It's casual and the whole team clearly had no interest in playing on site, they were all upstairs ready to win or die right there. Tachanka was on his turret in lobby lul.
---
So Jager is useless now?
---
Damage is crazy high?Lmao Smoke's shotgun has more damage than it. If you want to complain at least complain about the crazy high firerate. Btw it doesn't need a nerf. Ela is designed to excell  at close range and suck at long range. If she gets a nerf to her shotgun, at least buff her smg and maaaaaaybe add her impact back pls.
---
it's super toxic, i think because it's super competitive. even now, casual is super important to people for some reason, even though the game mode is literally called 'casual'. 
---
like others have said, most of the people spreading toxicity is because they think it's funny.
---
often times too, they don't bother to check people's levels, for instance when i was a level 7, i got bombarded with messages saying i was trash. i had only had rainbow for like 2 hours.
---
rainbow is super toxic, the best way to deal with it is to ignore the bad and focus on the actual game.
---
They've nerfed Jäger a ton over the years.
---
The only way I see them lowering his pick-rate is to introduce someone else that can block projectiles.
---
I solo queue on Xbox and get stuck in gold 3 as it usually goes win,lose,win,lose etc
---
OwO what's this? UwU
---
Yeah i fall from silver 2 to bronze 4
---
I decided that because lesion is really good and it would be nice for a attacker to have something similar
---
He didn't even stand a chance.
---
Okay just tell me if u win
---
Lul. It's a bit of an inside joke regarding our gay friend and buck. Most people who see it in game and understand ask about it
---
“I keep that thang on me too and you come this way you will get clapped!”
---
the attackers mastered the art of standing so incredibly still they become invisible to the naked eye.
---
I can’t be the only one that’s pissed at the team tryna steal it?
---
Shocc_dron_eater777
---
I’m not sure but a damage nerf on judge can change it and when he shoots it makes a hole as big as a maverick hole so defenders have a chance to fight back
---
piss of with your low-effort post
---
The only way this would be reasonable is if they released new gear for the operator because what if you have all the outfits and headgear for that operator, then you're just screwed and you wasted your time
---
Yeah I know and that's the part that I don't like the most but realistically I only averaged about maybe two to three packs a day if I'm playing for around three to four hours a day so yeah
---
We didn’t make it. My team was all below 90 but over 65 and the other team was well over 100 on each player
---
In my opinion Nökk is pretty good, But that's my Opinion i do pretty good with her but idk lol pick one that you'll do good with or maybe save up
---
1. Console/PC?
---
2. Play style?
---
Maestro is a must pick, he's a fantastic defender on most sites and even if you can't zap people, his intelligence gathering is amazing.
---
Aaaah thats the explanation for the bans yesterday lul it was rare so many boosted
---
Upvote for bliss.
---
Or make an weapon skin that doesnt look like shit.
---
This season nailed seasonal skins. Something like those (not the ice cream one) would be a nice birthday skin.
---
Does anyone know how big the Xbox Update is? Asking for a friend.
---
The hatch wasn't registered as open on the server. So every time he moved through the hatch and relayed his position to the server, the server rejected the move as invalid and sent him back.
---
A desync on the hatch might happen if there was packet loss when it was broken.
---
They've just been for guns that no one uses though
---
Not a bad idea
---
this is a cool concept OP
---
Dunno then, sorry
---
Why are 99% of Ash's bundles for the G36c....
---
they're nearly EA levels of greedy
---
I personally enjoy the Aussie Ops (Mozzie, Gridlock), they have the shorty as a side arm and both have two decent main weapons to boot as well as their abilities which are both really useful across all maps.
---
Yup! But there are only a handful of maps that everyone comes together and doesn’t like them in ranked
---
Hibana's shotgun isn't a slug. It's a regular shotgun with pellets.
---
Birthday charms where far more high effort than the skins.
---
Time for double trouble
---
The only think people didn't like about the old lighting was the bloom. Idk why they got rid of the realistic lighting too
---
The ceiling beach was reinforced. What else really needs to be reinforced at this point?
---
zapping is very enjoyable with newer players. i find myself getting full knocks and kills with him more than i should
---
Exactly
---
Absolutely brutal. And the train station is perfect for any defender that hides
---
Or a party hat...
---
First team to fall onto the water loses
---
Lol would be even better for chanka if they just put the party hat on top of his normal headgear
---
Im a Console player, Im a bit of a Allrounder sometimes im more of a rusher and sometimes am a bit sneaky. Im playing using my brain and look for the weakness and the best for the team. 
---
Sorry for my bad English
---
Read the rules.

Hello WordBearersXVII, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/chb3qt/fix_this_bugs_ubi_start_work/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I never understood how people can call spawnpeekers or rushers or such „tryhard“ oder „sweaty“ in this game. Like it‘s literally the opposite of tryharding to risk being dead at the beginning of the round by peeking known peek spots. 
---
Tryin hard in this game means playing absolute non-agressive, cautious and methodically, which is lame in casual.
---
Back then it was unbreakable
---
Yes
---
If your going to make complaints about maps being taken out your first thing shouldn't be you dont care about the ratios. Ubi does care about them so what they will take out will likely be done due to ratios and other statistics. just cuz u think they suck isnt shit. maybe you just suck on them. Some people can do well on those maps. sure they arent the best but we make it work. being a b!tch about it aint gonna solve anything.
---
No. That was a straight up furryfest. *Never again.*
---
Yes, but it is incorporated with fuze and a hostage, that's why I put it here, "to be exact
---
He just said it was 2-2 match point so casual
---
I think you saying those maps suck is just your opinion cause I fond them pretty balanced, outback ecspecially. Plus the whole point of ranked is for it to be something worth playing for, and if you get a shitty map that sucks for attackers and lose the game because the defense had it easy that'd be pretty damn frustrating if you ask me. If you don't wanna have maps removed just go play casual
---
YES! Completely agree with this. Hence why im having trouble understanding.
---
1th
---
I just meant that time wouldn’t have anything to do with it. If he opened a legendary on his fifth next pack then it wouldn’t matter whether that pack was opened today or in a year.
---
You should kill her with her own drone
---
How so?
---
Team mates shot the shock drone. I wish I had a pest left over so I could kill her with that
---
Funny how you want to make a point about it not being important how good a map is objectively because YOU like them and then proceed to tell us they should remove maps because you don‘t like them lol.
---
I do possibly agree with the damage change, but definitely not the amount of ADSs he has.
---
Wait to you got the game and just jumped right in to online 😑.  Didn’t do the situation, learn the controls, or know anything about anything.  Couldn’t even be bothered to do a solo terrorist hunt on some maps to learn the lay out.  Sounds like ur the dick
---
Because Chalet and Skyscraper are even worse than the others you mentioned. I like skyscraper myself, I play well on it, but I realise it's an absolute garbage map that shouldn't be in ranked. Skyscraper and chalet are the worst of the worst. And p.s. outback is actually a pretty good map, many pros think so too.
---
We call him furry smoke
---
My question is why are they all underpowered and still getting nerfs?
---
It could be and I’d be interested to know. Because with all the uproar about loot boxes being gambling that could be illegal.
---
It always bogs me when I‘m called a tryhard for dumb rushes or peeks when the guy complaining holds a long doc angle for 3 mins lol
---
They should add something like in apex legends where your guaranteed a legendary every 30 packs or something.
---
This screenshot was taken recently not then the shield had 800hp
---
Then you wouldnt have to pay for it, not gonna happen.
---
And apart from the other defence sided maps, Hereford feels almost choking to attack, particularly the top floor. You have to try take 1 on 1 gunfights whilst hoping the enemy doesn't peak your behind. The only other options is rappelling in the through a window (haha considering how the windows are positioned) or pushing up the tunnels of multi angled-easy to flank garbage that is the various stairs.
---
What if we have elite though?
---
I had a pretty fast ace once, I hot-breached a window into the objective and killed everyone with the 590A1 (S.A.S Shotgun). It was so fast and so stupid.
---
Pro League strats right there.
---
Go back to the dog tags
---
Lol what. Trust me,  these aren’t big nerfs. Small weapon nerf and small ADS nerf. He’d still be one of the best.
---
Why don't alpha packs give outfits
---
Please explain how this would make him useless?
---
I have it for every Russian primary except for the 9x. but my favorite that I have is MP5 or P90.
---
Haha ikr. Calling someone who rushes/spawnpeeks a try hard/sweaty is such a mindless thing to say. I think they say this as they are salty that they were not paying attention and have nothing better to say.
---
Yes but like the dream team tag.
---
I don’t know if I got lucky but I noticed a lot of noobs picking up IQ and getting killed instantly or not looking for traps outside of the points so it usually isn’t a problem
---
They nerfed monty blits echo maverick and jackal
---
I don't think you exactly understand what we mean by sweating, it doesn't exactly have to take effort to sweat. And I'm not even saying that sweating is bad really, but it is when people do it in every single casual game they play. It's not fun for low level or new players who just want to have fun with the game, but they can't when a level 250 doc main is clapping them everytime they step out of spawn or into the building
---
Kaid the rest apart from ting and alibi are banned a lot
---
I got it before I saw this and it just, wow
---
😎😎
---
it was just meant as a joke mate :), as your main is echo in your flair
---
Major jej for that Zofia 50 seconds in.
---
People just mad they get outplayed by being spawnpeaked therefore blame the spawnpeaker as their excuse
---
Apparently poor hit reg, unbalanced weapons/ops toxic community, doesn’t listen for shit for 3 years are the devs that’s gonna save this game
---
now moving forward no one is going to try...
---
Yes Ubisoft said they wanted more natural light in the room
---
Right it’s also an issue, but I checked the scoreboard and like 3/4 of their guys had over 200 ms ping.
---
nice, my vigil setup looks kinda like this
---
Are you a shotty kind of a guy or do you like semi/ auto weapons. Or do you like to lurk/roam/anchor?
---
Try playing operators that can do all playstyles very well, mute, Jager, bandit, lesion, etc. Then just play with these super flexible ops and note what your behaviour typically is when you're playing comfortably/how you typically play in the match. Take mental note of that and play operators that you think match that playstyle. It takes time to find a 'main', especially when all ops are relatively similar compared to other games (all high DPS hitscan operators with roughly the same size, speed, and health).
---
Very unlucky for you then. Maybe friends playing across regions
---
I say yes and then kill everyone with my gun
---
not me then. but i was once 2v5 on chalet and i asked for knife only because who tries in a 5v2. they accepted. my teammate died to a knifefight while i aced clutched with a knife
---
They absolutely can make the theme of a turret operator like tachanka fit within the core of siege. Look at Maestro, who is basically just that. He’s a 3 speed anchor who has to remain stationary to use his turrets, but can whip out his LMG if he needs to reposition. 
---
I’m not sure why keeping everything that defines tachanka’s character seems to prevent reworking his shitty mechanical implementation. He can still be a screaming Russian thiccboi even if he uses his LMG as his primary and his gadget is a quick deploy bipod.
---
STILL no mention of DDOS on console. It is absolutely rampant. Please Ubi, address console concerns!
---
It’s happened almost every match.
---
I want the dog tags back! I had them all on Xbox but I switched to PC and now I have nothing
---
Still doesn't make PC "Superior" console is Easier and better for people who don't want to go all out with bindings
---
No
---
Just a casual 25 missed shots
---
I didn’t ask what map it is and I’ve never seen that before. Goes to show what happens when your whole team roams
---
Ooh I like it, I recommend cross-posting/posting to r/r6siegefashionadvice
---
If I were you I would stay on the safe side and keep the username. I wouldn't want to risk losing everything as there have been reports of people losing saves in other games. I have no idea if it would affect Rainbow though.
---
op is for shooting.

I mean if your sneaking up on people and droning shooting them in the head gets easier.

Ye playing this season of Siege makes me never want to play again. The community is dying and there's a reason.

jackal would actually be useless with this, mute would be a must-pick and jackal's pick rate would plummet. there wouldn't be a great roamer-counter anymore
---
Yes I'm aware I'm a dumbass and I was shooting that wall rhe whole time Lmao
---
actually that makes since. each sight has there own vision changing it up every so often can offer a refreshing perspective.
---
Depends what rank you are tbh. Kaids probably the only  one you'll consistently play without being banned lol
---
That’s my problem I can’t decide weather I want to roam or anchor

I have never gotten a uniform from a normal alpha pack I only get it like in the showdown packs

Dude, you’re not wrong about all of it. I play on console so there’s no chat but the toxicity is just as bad as it ever was. The report function doesn’t work and I agree with all of what you’ve said. I’ve had the game since a couple months after first release and it was great back then and was good for a while. Once they started getting some of these gadgets that are from things like sci-fi, nano-machine, holograms, the game felt different. Like I love alibi and how she plays, finka is a monster but something felt off.  And I can’t put my finger on it but you summed up most of the issues perfectly. They act like they’re China trying to sensor all of it, I honestly would like to have to put in some sort of age check so I can have the settings taken off.
---
so high plats smacking real coppers and silvers is okay? making this game no fun? you smurfs can say all you want. I’m happy for ruining the game for you pussy smurfs and plats who have smurf accounts and the whole community who supports them!
---
Standard kick vote when you're about to win the round too...

North roof gang for life

Diamond and platinum look no different

Yes! I know there is an YT video that fixes this. You just change your dns, and for some weird reason it works. Worked for a friend of mine. Ill try to see if i can find the YT link
---
That’s causal for you!
---
yes. especially against toxic people
---
Yokai's humming
---
That’s a small sample size. You can’t generate accurate predictions on that.
---
No I told you why everyone was roaming, Oregon is a great map for roamers that when spread out can and should win every time. They were way too bunched up and that’s obviously why they all died.
---
Very well put my friend
---
I somewhat agree, but I guess those screenshots may not do the charms justice. Will try and get in game screenshots to show another look.
---
it would have been more realistic if he first agreed only to proceed with shooting him
---
When this will end cus i want to get dat skin but am in england not home so i cant take it
---
Well you see, this game is made by Ubisoft.  That's basically the reason for ever issue.
---
Nokk, Warden and IQ are next.
---
Plats who smurf to verse coppers suck, dont associate them me with them. I only play on smurfs when my friends dont want me to play on my diamond account. My smurf rn is a plat 1 so I dont get put up against low ranks. But, mouse and key sucks, dont use it. You preach about toxicity amongst the community, yet you're the won that wants to cheat and actually be toxic
---
Thanks who do you recommend between bandit and jager

Some serious words on this. If you are one of those people who unload their entire mag as soon as they see an enemy, Finka should be your choice. Personally, I hate Finka because the surge messes with my muscle memory and makes you pretty much deaf for the duration it lasts. If you happen to play as a team, go for Lion. Imo he's the better choice.
---
I think they should just take the rank of the highest ranked player in a party for matchmaking.
---
I play with 5 stacks so we play strats and not as solo fraggers, having a pinging MnK Ash rushing at you isn't ideal.
---
No not at all only a 1.4 kid right now if I'm right
---
But for me, I can aim so easy with its iron sight that I main vigil now
---
I mean bandit can be easily countered by Maverick, has no acog, and can't electrify hatches from below. Argument invalid.
---
That’s funny because yesterday I was smonk because I wanted those gadget kills and I was standing right behind a Monty that was looking at my friend and I had no idea that Monty wasn’t in my team. My friend had just gotten his gadget kills and he was all “dude kill him with your smoke or I’m just gonna nitro him” and my response was “what I don’t see anybody where are they” I died in a 1v4 soon after
---
Sorry haha, my screen is so cracked i couldn't see the details, but damn youre mighty fine with a controller. Take my upvote :)
---
"He's over there"
---
Positioning is very important. Remember as a defender? The attackers have to come to you

Zofia and Bandit

High sensitivity so that means your mouse and key, boom busted

That I agree with, even though they weren't deliberately malicious in their party, picthing a plat 2 against a bunch of gold's isn't the best, and not as fair as ranked should be, but stuff like this will get fixed next season so it's all good
---
one of my mates had a 8-hour wait. His graphics card failed to load the game, so it was stuck, he just went to sleep and got an autowin
---
For whatever reason each shield got different nerfs to the hipfire with Blitz being not so bad while Monty got the worst can barely hit anything from 4m away. His hipfire was already very inaccurate and would usually only land hits when he was really up close. And it doesn’t even fix the problem most people had with it which is the lucky headshots which still happen quite a bit.
---
In the stream they will reveal the next operation?
---
Most relatable shit I've seen all day
---
You mean the Pro 90?
---
I changed my name and nothing happend to my trophies or my in-game purchases so you should be safe aswell
---
The only thing you need to know is that your "slightly above average skill" means absolutely nothing. You are going to be rusty. Play the game, warm up and have fun.
---
I told. See above
---
But has a better weapon and is a 3 speed, while having more gadgets to place overall (which is a benefit overall). Goes both ways
---
That was 100% Bandit. Watch the top bar and you'll see him die as she shoots.
---
Watch the top bar, it was Bandit.
---
Because they want to blame each and everything else rather than admitting that they were not paying attention.
---
You were correct, Doctor. Since I'm also trying to not shit myself I figured it had been stomach flu.   
---
Unlike them, I dont have dysentery
---
"Where'd you die?"
---
"The uhhhhhh.... the room! On the left..... from uhhhhhhhhhh..... the green... uhhh... thing..."
---
*morale of the story - glance your compass*
---
"North room, second floor" is at least a bit better
---
You're not playing him right
---
&gt; well hes 51 so theres one thing he wont be hammering....
---
Can confirm this is false, I've seen 51 and raised it.
---
So you are saying that if you met a player who was good but not perfect, drops maybe 12 kills and 3 deaths, you wouldn't want to queue with them? I'm not saying that they are aim locking and doing blatant shit, I'm talking about accidentally queuing with a good player who turns out to be a cheater.
---
There still needs to be somebody that creates those skins, he is getting paid and spending the time he could invest differently.
---
Obviously, those skins are minimal effort. Doesn't change the fact that somebody has to create them.
---
did you end up buying R6? If yes, what edition did you buy? Seems like the basic one requires a ton of grinding.
---
20
---
The shield nerf would make them even worse than they are and make them completely unusable after the nerf coming up next patch. Why have to worry about that Monty in the doorway when you could just put two bullet in his face shield, break it, and blow his brains out? Even if it took an entire mag to destroy the face shields, it would make all of the shields useless.
---
It is at least easier but sometimes even your teammate has  a brain fart and forgets THEY TOO have a compass.
---
He’s getting the shield anyway. 
---
I think he needs the same treatment as Glaz with the movement leniency when seeing through smoke. 
---
Should also be able to see attacker equipment when standing still with glasses active, within a 10m radius. This gives him a reason to use his gadget once it’s off cooldown, without hoping someone throws the occasional smoke and stun.
---
Lose the barbed wire and keep the impacts. Will help with the new glasses buff
---
"Illusions are fatal"
---
Ok thanks for the help. Keep up the good work! Siege is life 🤙
---
I don't think that it's a engine limitation.
---
They said that during Alibi development prismas were essentially extra players, and at least they changed how they work, I think they could do this.
---
(Sauce was a Ubisoft video)
---
No smoke trails and no bullet direction indicator is better than most people think, especially in casual non-pro play
---
you seems new on this sub, right? It was stated by Ubi long time ago that it's engine issues as to why Alibi's Prisma don't copy her outfit...
---
I thought you could spend r6 coins on them
---
Oh
---
Oh, didn't know
---
Smurfing is using a brand new account to intentionally circumvent matchmaking, so that I'm not put with people of my skill, instead I'm put with people that a brand new player is out against 
---
...until about level 20 when the game levels it out. 
---
if you got to r6tab.com and search for "has nice ash" and "homm e phobic" on xbox, you can see the stats of a couple of my smurfs. You'll see they have a high general K/D and a high general win rate. That's the result of the game essentially being easier for me.
---
One time when I still played Secure my friend downed one guy in site and killed the last guy but the other guy was still downed and I killed him and stole his ace
---
Uhh.. Fuze AR, Jackel AR, Jackel SMG, Twitch AR.
---
If you don’t mind recoil and reloading.. Hibana AR.
---
oh? weird. it's this⬇️, anyway.

HAHA I honestly thought it was just gonna be you messin with cav, but damn sledge you dog
---
18-3 but still lost 4-5...
---
That plus I'm not good at relying on crosshairs to aim instead of a reticle
---
Face looks like Tom Cruise.
---
It actually came from r/dank memes, by me, posted over an hour ago, so they stole from me
---
Aiming without aim assist is different. If you want to try to talk about who’s better at console FPS in general you can 1v1 me on hang em kid.
---
I did but no one was there
---
no
---
knife is so bugged in this game
---
5head?

Nope, get to work!
---
I have the full tachanka outfit
---
7, I think... mostly because of either luck or simple killstealing from my dead teammates.
---
Never
---
19 and 5 but I coulda had 21 AND won the match if I wasn’t a potato
---
My best game ever was  22-3
---
Shotguns don’t have headshot damage bonuses
---
Aiming with a controller is one thing, aiming with a controller without aim assist in an FPS is another
---
I couldn't stop laughing when it happened because we weren't communicating, i didn't have my mic on but it still worked out that way
---
I can’t find the skin, did they take it down?
---
5 min ago, dokkaebi got banned too
---
I dont know how well this would work considering how few uniforms and headgears there are, there would be a lot of duplicates
---
Like I said, I just bought it on console.
---
Yeah, people don’t tend to advertise that their a/into furries in Siege.
---
Next level distraction
---
Pretty bold statement from someone who doesn’t know shit.
---
thats only 20.
---
US server？
---
Blitz op
---
I’m a console gamer. Have been my whole life, but I’ve never played siege on console, and I probably won’t again.
---
It comes with all the operators that came on release. But no buck, no frost, no Valkyrie, no Blackbeard etc.
---
bruh
---
22 - 3. we lost a round because they planted and i gotta SAVE THAT KD
---
It’s not that bad, people do it allllllll the time. Just because you aren’t used to it doesn’t mean the game should change around you.
---
I keep getting that as well it's very annoying. Plz Unisoft fix this
---
The “rank” of these specific charms is based solely on how much of the r6 major you watch on twitch.
---
Then run it boi, nothing scarier then a giant yellow Russian on a turret spraying you down.
---
Nah
---
Good choice in music
---
This is why you can’t aim lol. Toxic.
---
People constantly Ban Clash and Tachanka. 
---
Dokkaebi is one of those Operators anyone rarely plays and seems like a waste of a ban.
---
It’s still a skill that’s honed, but without aim assist you’re encouraging people to hook up KBM.
---
My best is 8%

I personally liked it a lot. It was on of my favourite maps and I still play Thunt occasionally just to be able to play there.

I really hope it comes back.

1v1 me on hang em please, then we’ll talk about who has better aim on console in general.

Ubisoft: We decided to nerf Mozzie

Smh no honor

You reminisce, I have Flashbacks. I hated Ela back then. There was this old clip where Canadian was just prefiring every possible angle from Tea to Main stairs on Skyscraper and when he finally killed them he just said “I’m Ela”
---
The Boondocks Saints.
---
They admitted to it being a problem with Witcher 3's development and they said it's been improved for Cyberpunk 2077

22 in blood orchid, with ela/blackbeard every round on bank.
---
It was kinda silly.
---
When I stopped playing because I cannot get out of fucking Bronze rank.
---
Yeah, this reads like a hate wagon you tried to steer into Ubisoft cause you lost your ranked game.
---
The difference in plat on console vs PC is insane...
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
And his friends aswell lmao
---
They wanted you to know.
---
All this does is fuck over people trying to play the game tactically and drone.
---
Do we really need to make this game less tatical?
---
They have proved themselves a thousand times more than any developer, just look at any of their interviews, you can tell they want whats best for everyone, even if it means CDPR getting less money.
---
Almost all games are downgraded for consoles sadly, thats nothing new, everyone does it
---
Where are these bundles?
---
We’ll see here’s the thing. They can still drone windows and door ways and the gadget would only have say 5 projectiles before its empty
---
oh fuck no, then what? jump jets?
---
Now this is how you know that the game is in very special state atm.
---
I was talking about for other players...
---
They should be accessible through the bundles section of the store although they may have been removed for Ubi reasons.
---
What?
---
A bug or they must have changed it.
---
His ads is deployed and ready to go
---
That Apple Watch tho 😂
---
I see this as a absolute win
---
as a low gold console player, i've never seen this tradition anywhere, except for the occasional 1v1 "we wasted all our primary and secondary ammo, and it's too scary to try to run away and reload before the other guy can, so we must duel" moments.
---
The worst attacker primary is probably Hibana’s Supernova and the best is (overall) Twitch’s F2.
---
This idea would just be annoying and far too niche to be worth it regardless. He would never see play, and when he does it would just be obnoxious.
---
Don't we all love Siege despite it's many many many flaws?
---
Ash OP
---
If you don't like siege's home screen then say it but no need to hurt its feelings
---
Because KD is more important than rank
---
We get it already . No need to repost it .
---
One big team kill coming right up.
---
We most certainly do. It's like the little brother that freaks you out, but you still love him
---
The pinned post on "Hot" page :

#Am i a joke to you ?

I'm lost

I roam with frost all the time wytb
---
he was holding the phone to check cameras
---
“How to play lesion: get 18 assists 3 kills and be at the top of the leader board, even if you have zero kills”
---
mostly stems from counterstrike
---
Unfortunately, this isn’t the best idea for a few reasons. First and foremost, there’s isn’t enough time in a round to make that worth while. I can see your point to even the odds or whatever, but honestly, just how often is THAT specific operator going to be last alive with bodies that are safe from lines of sight (which more than likely will be)
---
I can see it in the middle of the rounds, but it’s way to risky, you’d need to be 100% sure your safe to do so, or your both hecked up.
---
Didnt look at hot, sorry lol
---
You may roam all the time but once jah starts roaming its over
---
That poor thermite
---
you have been DDos'd friend. on your defense they cant DDos unless they get a plant down cus timer wpuld be in your favor. on attack they just turn it on and u lose at time. it happened to me last season on Theme Park.
---
Lesion 101

He was a copper I’m sure he’s used to it

A really big fucking team kill coming right up.

No need to post the same stuff , Dude . Like really . We get it
---
Good job man 👍🏻
---
If it’s an Anchor who is pressuring entry points, he will have much easier time going for Nokk’s head than the other way around. 
---
Their advantage of angle and range is more efficient than Nokk who only had her stealth which gets easily countered.
---
A single barbed wires or a barricade puts her immediately at disadvantage more than any other Attackers. 
---
There’s a good reason why she’s the second worst Attacker in the game right now.
---
Once i banned blackbeard
---
Well, I did. So, there's that.
---
No, please, he's already dead.
---
Are you doing callouts as well and coordinating? 
---
Communication is a two way street. 
---
What about setting up killzones and crossfires? Have you practiced thoses ?
---
Watch siege school on yt and play with 3 or more friends or it playing solo use game chat

Don't worry, I have a wet paper towel replacement.

Hello britockatron, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/chf8fj/true_love_was_formed_on_this_night/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I don't know, it's a theoretical system that you thought of.. so you decide if the leaver would still get penalized. If so that would make it better, but I just think it'd be used for trolling as well.
---
I think the solution is very heavy punishment for people who leave frequently.
---
The game has not started the bomb was just sitting there
---
It’s like a command line for the game.
---
You got banned for an unknown reason. Just because you don't know why doesn't mean Ubi randomly banned you out of the blue.
---
Cheers mate
---
Haha. The point is the game is an FPS, and like any other FPS gaming, aiming should be pretty natural. And it is across every FPS I play. The problem is that siege takes out the part of aiming in every single console FPS game that makes aiming with a controller feasible. My point is that it makes sense to me why console players try the game and think it’s too hard. I personally never understood that until I tried it for myself on console.
---
It might be that someone hacked your account and used hacks. If not then be the squeaky wheel, keep contacting UBI and get a proper answer.
---
To be honest mate I don't know what most of that means😂I appreciate you trying to help though thanks 👍
---
Hmm okay
---
ah, don't play much cs but i could see that making sense.

OP you are fuking genuis

8 commons in a row, with one being a reroll, broken only by a rare.

Lol, thanks.

They should get penalized but it really isn't a strong enough penalty.

Hey what platform do you play on? I'll teach u myself if u want.
---
I would be 100% ok with it if it replaced tower.
---
THANK YOU
---
For callouts, I callout what I'm doing, when I hear people and where they are. However I struggle doing so as I don't know maps yet so don't know what places are called. Sometimes struggle with knowing where to peak when attacking and stuff like that.
---
Yes he is.
---
I'm actually really sad they removed recruit from ranked because on attack, I only ever played recruit and Jackal. I bet you can guess how it's going now.
---
How do people even get in those ranks. I started playing tgis season and im gold 2
---
Gg 👍
---
aah. Jeez. This Vector Skin is fucking siiick.
---
I'm on Xbox. I play with a mate who's pretty good. What's the best way to learn?
---
The additions are a bit cheesy, either make the more realistic or leave them out. Other than that you got a lot of skill, I hated showdown.
---
I have wanted an all for one mode (everyone is the same attacker/defender) ever since I started this game.
---
Thought I was on r/shittymoviedetails for a second
---
Im a fuking idiot that tipyes like a 4 year old and don't know what a paper towl nor a wet one are
---
And the pros opinion matters why? They're a very small overall percentage of the playerbase. I'm really tired of Ubisoft sitting there prioritizing the "pro-leaugue" over what actually matters, keeping the normal players so the game grows. As of right now the assenine shield patch makes it totally pointless to play a shield character.
---
Happens quite often to me. Honestly i got no idea what causes it or what fixes it. It just randomly fixes itself, either later during the day or the next. Manually restarting the game, the client and the pc never helped me tbh.
---
I mean, with the state she's in right now her shotgun is her only viable weapon.
---
Well either you can just play the game yourself and realize what you could do better and take advantage of enemy mistakes or you can go over into a custom game and your friend can teach you things.
---
You guys dont understand the meme smh....

I was 1,000 upvote

nah its too much of a hidden gem

---
what
---
For map knowledge and call outs, would you suggest I head into custom games with my mate and have him show me around maps, common push spots, names of rooms, stuff like that?
---
Sad to see a Diamond in that lobby but to be fair if you’re gold 1-2 and are pushing to platinum, you can’t say it’s unfair that you’re getting matched with platinums because in the end if you want to be a platinum than you should have to play against them to prove skill level. Then again rank really doesn’t really mean much.
---
I’m completely lost on who to play now that he sucks so much ass.
---
I think after seeing this, I will check every inch of the map

EA BAD

---
the thermal sight will completely lose its charge after 6 seconds of moving now, was previously 2.5 seconds
---
Nah, they are accommodating the platinums and diamonds who hate dealing with OP Montys. I met a platinum a few weeks back who absolutely RAGED when I was 1v1ing him and chose Monty. I settled for no shields in exchange for no ACOGs, and with that he literally left the game.
---
I completely understand your frustration, but the fact is a competitive game like Siege __*should*__ be balanced around pro play. That's just the right way to do it.
---
You don't balance an operator around a gold 2 who doesn't know how to get the absolute most out of said operator.. in a comp game you have to balance it around the people who know how to get the absolute most out of every operator, gadget etc.
---
So what if people think it's hard? That's the point of the game, to be a tactical shooter, not a run and gun where you aim vaguely in the enemy's direction and let auto aim do the rest. And with sieges ridiculously high damage model, adding any element of rng or handicap to the aim (which aim assist essentially is, as if you move your joystick such that you would land on the head, aim assist can overshoot you). The game is an Fps, yes, so shooting should be a skill based mechanic, which rewards players who take time to learn said mechanic. Battlefield, and cod, and so on are advertised as casual FPS games, that's why they come with aim assist, same with fortnite (and maybe pubg). They're not built with the intention of rewarding skilled players as much as possible. Siege (or at least the gunplay) is, with a high damage model, a 1 shot headshot mechanic, and recoil that whilst nowhere near as bad as csgo for instance, is still intense. And yes, I do play on console, so I know what I'm talking about in terms of playing with a controller, I've played games both with and without auto-aim.
---
It's suggestive. I want Chibis so not very good. I have a handful of black ice ^(but I'm the only person in existence that dose not like Black Ice so it doesn't even matter.)
---
Didn’t even want it
---
Good play but why are there TWO unused sweaters ?!
---
Yeah and all their excuses are: “I’m platinum from console.” Yeah right you are dipwad let me learn the game.
