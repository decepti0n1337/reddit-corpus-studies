Im trying to take a shit and now im fucking laughing to death

---
---
Exactly
---
I love it. I love getting killed by people who don't even aim my head but just hipfire spray and pray around it. Veri unique, muh skill, we are esport bois. This plus the worst hitreg I've ever seen creates majority of problems R6 has.
---
I know that he ranks with friends, but also solo cues in casual. To be honest theres nothing bad you can say about him. First time i saw his stats i was like what the fuck. But watching him play showed me that he put thousands of hours into Siege to become such an amazing player. Hard work pays off. His aim is another level. I havent seen another player on ps4 that is so precise yet. 
---
I take it you didn’t read the edit
---
this is all good however they will likely add esports to the home tab no doubt as other games do this
---
I’m more memorized by your rank than the gun tbh
---
i mean if i tried to do that i'd somehow be the one dead
---
I know. 
---
You know I’m a big deal in the resistance

Nah, I read it.

they could have been better ops aswell aha 
---
It’s actually not. At all. You would literally have someone show you what to do rather than tell. And there’s no guarantee that the people on here know what they’re doing 
---
I mean, yea but then you could technically count any ace as a 1v5 even if your whole team is alive
---
Using fear to get what you want
---
Clubhouse (pre-rework) with frost. Hid on the balcony and got 3 in the traps and picked the rest off when they rushed in. 
---
How come
---
“Take the stim, you earned it”
---
Or mute it and just play regular but yeah that would apply in real life situations
---
Oh
---
But now we have oversized stages thanks to updates that made the game smaller. The optimal way to play is 4 room 1 roamer for defenders and attackers open murder holes to hold angles until defense is in too awkward a position to cover room. Gameplay just feels cramped since it mostly takes place in a single room through peepholes instead of roaming an entire map plotting and trapping.
---
One time, MD invited me to Casual and a certain player in our team is really toxic to the others. This player TK'ed me on the next round because I failed at "easy" 1v1 clutch. MD immedietly pulled me out of the match and apologized for letting me see that.
---
Guaranteed to work against *some* humans!
---
Ewwwww red dot
---
Jk that’s a great costume
---
You have to give some more info like a map or operator. 
---
Whenever one of my friends get mad cus they’re doing bad I just tell them to click on the enemy’s head. 
---
lol
---
Where is the acog?
---
And this, children is why mics are important

Exactly. They already have an actual range built and rendered. They could just have it launch that small portion of the map to reduce load times.

Playing with toxic players just puts the whole team in a shitty mood and is probably the reason you guys are losing.

Exactly what I was thinking. Like if you want to use a shotgun just equip the fucking Deagle. It probably has more damage per second anyways

---
So how do I send them in? (Btw bad editing is better than no editing) i'll send you the clips tomorrow- I was just srolling reddit before bed and don't have the energy to get back up to my pc
---
just looks like a skilled player to me
---
It’s a dick community of babies that use the game’s mechanics to punish their teammates when things don’t go their way 
---
I meant aren't shooting drones. 
---
teammates trying to have some fun =&gt; kick over their sand castle =&gt; post it on reddit =&gt; ???
---
Oh ok 
---
*throws popsicle stick* has me dead
---
That's even less reasonable. Team damage is just a necessary evil. Sometimes you may have to fire at/past a teammate to kill a couple enemies, or there may be an instance where a C4 could kill 2+ enemies at the expense of a teammate. 
---
Plus, Ubi is already addressing the TK concerns through the upcoming options to pardon accidental/justifiable kills against teammates, meaning that any un-pardoned kills can result in bans. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My only fear is that any sort of system to "back fill" will result in more people quitting matches. Plus, this isn't really an issue at higher ranks, which means it's not worth putting the effort into creating some ridiculous system where some users come in to back fill and risk receiving the same elo effects as the members who were already losing when they joined. 
---
Back when shotguns headshotted
---
ESPECIALLY Monty, given how he can spam hipfire in CQB.
---
He just domed you lol
---
Alright. If this works to send, I'll PM you my method.
---
*hardest choices
---
The majority of players dont play at the higher ranks. It's definitely a concern for most of the playerbase. 
---
Btw i would prefer rock music
---
It's a joke of a game with fluffy unicorns, furries, a teddy bear, "princess" Blackbeard, confetti guns and comedy.
---
Tactical went out the window on April 1st.
---
And guns are still involved
---
You've just been served by: ☆☆Blitz Squad☆☆
---
Any song specifically? I find it hard to just search "rock music" and find something good 😓
---
This is so bad. Alexa play twinkle twinkle Little stars.
---
Guns are pink and shoot confetti.
---
Yes, but whatever fix/correction they implement impacts the entire playerbase, including those high ranks. By creating this system, you risk higher ranks getting infected with the same quitting behavior as the lower ranks, and making ranked in general worse for everyone. 
---
How do you propose they do the back fill without unfairly harming the player that gets brought into a losing match mid-game?
---
I got it and I love it, I just never play pulse or castle 
---
I already mentioned that in one of my above comments. 
---
Killcams are glitched
---
Not until they fix shield desync.
---
Yeah they should definitely fix that
---
Oh Fuze is currently destroying PL because of his stupudly accurate hipfire accuracy.
---
Shoot out lights, hide in the dark, shoot the flashlights. Shit would be broken as fuck. Or you’d have 2 teams both not shooting each other because it’s dark and they don’t want to give away where they are. 
---
Defenders are already at the advantage because you have to come to them and they have crazy amounts on intel. 
---
The way the maps look too, like the lighting and shading has changed. It feels now like a TF2 map where everything is bright as fuck without any realistic light source. I remember the old siege had more darker themes
---
Straight up broken.
---
Deployable cover on attack and full auto spray gun. Won't be balanced.
---
Smoke and sledge should be there
---
You should in a practical scenario not use a liability. Iron sights on any gun other than shotguns, ARX and Mp7 are a straight up disadvantage, and in a tactical shooter where any Advantage is used, you would he basically putting yourself at a combat disadvantage.
---
Why tf would you buy a dlc before the base op. 
---
Drink LOTS of apple juice.
---
Fuze
---
Then the player is very good.
---
I actually would love this. I hate having to click through each attachment tab and take 5 seconds to load. 
---
Don’t show the drones fear and they won’t see you. 
---
When I was new to the game my friends said shoot me and I had my stims out but I switched to another weapon and capped his head
---
Agree, you should be able to start 5 ops and it picks one out of the 5 (therefore if 4 are taken you have that other one)
---
*pushes up glasses and inhales. "Ackshually it's 180 not 360". Nice frag tho.

Lol the MW2 hitmarker sound on the C4 
---
ESPECIALLY IF THEY SHOOT MY FUCKING DRONES
---
Jackal is a weaker lion IMO, BlackBeard is constantly getting nerfed. Buck is a versatile op with a shotgun barrel allowing him to create holes for hatches and ceilings.
---
Jackal is good, but go for buck
---
Why bother when you can just shoot?
---
Pro tip: reinforcements and castle barricades are not bulletproof until fully deployed. In other words, you can shoot someone who is putting a reinforcment up until their animation is complete
---
Inventory?

Seriously though,  8 heard gunfire so I ran back and just did what I didb2ithoutbreally thinking. For a split second when I stand up and stare at twitch I thought it was teammates,  till I realized it was twitch...

I said he same thing to my friend. I told him if it comes down to it, bungie might as well take over.
---
I half see you. I do wanna see more shield ops but the desync for the shields in the game already makes it hard to say yes. In a perfect word if they fixed the shield in the game already i wouldn't mind seeing another attacker shield op. Not even like monty or blitz but maybe more like fuze. They have a shield and some other gun maybe a shotgun as a primary and some gadget that works with the shield.
---
Yeah and you can set the level of preference among them

Also don’t forget the first rule of survival 
---
So instead we upvote him for rampant toxicity.  Then in yet another thread we complain about toxicity and teamkilling, and yet right here, the entire subreddit is glorifying it.
---
1. Outfits don’t change hitboxes
---
2. Not all of smokes standard gear counts as his hitbox. Hitboxes are smaller than the models for all characters. The hitbox is based on a normal human shape. For example, the headphones worn by the gsg9 isn’t part of their hitbox. Mozzie’s helmet isn’t part of his hitbox. The SAS gas masks aren’t part of the hitbox. 
---
All clothing is not part of the hitbox
---
No they changed that a while ago actually
---
He should have something similar to Mira, a little Mira you can see through but enemies can’t. Would make it more dangerous to breach charge as C4’s would kill you and Impacts would expose you
---
Exactly. Anyone but Ubi. They cant ever fix shit. There are changes just now being worked on that should have been year one changes. Team killing fix and such.
---
You had a ddoser on the other team. 
---
That's a lie. If that's the case, I would've died everytime a Monty tried to cap me. 
---
She is missing alot of the components but she is getting there. I'll make an update in the future. 
---
Iron sights should be viable. They offer an alternative to using a 1x sight and said sight getting turned off by Thatcher. Situational? Yes, very, but they should at least be viable. Siege has some ugly fucking irons on a lot of guns.
---
So tosic 
---
yeah you don’t know what you’re talking about 
---
Whelp, you acted like a dick, now you get punished. You were in a squad of 4 and you made a teammate suffer. Now you suffer.
---
You just turn your back to them. When you think you’ve flashed the enemy they have probably just turned the back too the flash and baited you.
---
It’s pretty good not gonna lie. She can do more tho! Good luck 
---
Iron sights offer nothing but a liability other than those 3 guns I mentioned
---
And honestly, after enough practice, you'll know exactly where your reticle is, and a Thatcher throwing his soft ball shouldn't make you shift to a liability. No offense, but that is a very, very hollow argument.
---
When you have an advantage freely available, you use it.

First one was today! Killed three with shotgun as Kapkan. Then got killed. The last two were a blitz and another. They walked through one of my traps together and I got em both.
---
Not as impressive as some, but I’m still proud af
---
Yes, aimbot, wallhacks, speed hacks, teleport
---
Same for me, a skin for a gun I know I will never use.
---
I don’t care
---
how about no duplicates after three times? better yet, how about no dupes at all?
---
I do not care
---
Less coding work I'd bet though. Overall the event has got a decent amount of work - custom cosmetics, and a new skybox, all new textures, voice acting... But the menu probably requires more coding to replace the current one.
---
Still no excuse though, it's not that much work
---
I use it on most guns that allow it
---
I know this a overused comment but it happens to everybody. Welcome to r6 siege
---
I don't know why they do it like this, its across all of their games that are pretty much online only.
---
I can say jokingly "Data Limits", but then, I might even be not joking, because it's ubi.
---
So many bad design choices that make our life's harder a little sadly.
---
not bucks c8 thought right?
---
and what about on Jaeger ?
---
Should get his and his friends usernames and report them to ubi on Twitter 
---
Nope, only op I'd consider is Frost since she has nothing else. Not worth the reduction to damage falloff when you can have better recoil management IMO. Plus, I've killed more people because their barrel poked around the corner than people because of their lasers.
---
Why is his holster on the left? Is Blackbeard a lefty?
---
Appreciate it my friend
---
But it's funny as fuck
---
If this happens to you more that once it’s honestly just natural selection 
---
what about suppressors ?
---
I know it’s just annoying 
---
I use it on everything pretty much because more damage and range is always good.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
The lord tachanka bundle
---
Lol, I'd take capitao over fuze but I prwfer the AK12, as fun as suppressed laser beams are
---
Nobody:

It'd be nice if you were able to turn on the option to be placed in an ongoing ranked game.
---
By kiboshing his own team.  No different than teamkilling four people.
---
I saw it and showed it to my friend... we laughed for a good 15 minutes. Best laughter I’ve had in a long time!
---
Honestly, I feel the same way, I just took a full month off playing because it was making me feel angry.  Games should be played to create enjoyment not distaste.

And it takes 3 min to turn off

Ahh I see. Still hilarious tho
---
That's fair enough but you gotta remember, the stakeholders nees to be given a reason to throw money and resources at the problem. Unfortunately the dev team, as much as they would like not to, is constrained by resources and budget set by the stakeholders. 
---
Rule #1?
---
It's part of Berlins East Side Gallery and based on a photograph between Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker taken in 1979. 
---
Start up top, immediately someone runs out and throws c4 on the roof
---
That was some skilled sledging
---
Never reinforce walls between the two bombs
---
Well Shit..........
---
Everyone finds team-killing funny, it's a good way to make some new friends in the game
---
wtf why isn’t the plane in pink and green and yellow
---
Stop adding to the spam. 
---
Lol. That's how I found my ranked team. 
---
Don't reinforce kids bedroom unless ur looking to get tked. 
---
Rule #7
---
Here is the best tips what you should take: delete the game
---
Ubi doesnt care about: broken hitboxes,unballanced operators, mouse users on console,10years old kids with no brain and teamkill all the round,unfair matchmaking
---
But they care about: pro league players, your money, stupid skins, unlimited unneccessary new unrealistic operators...
---
In what way do you think they’re bad? 
---
The point of most aces is that your team has no part. You wiped the squad solo. I don’t think this is a 1v5 but really well played nonetheless.
---
awesome video :)
---
Definitely. I'm sure a lot of the developers in-charge of the UI is aware that the loadout menu needs to be fixed or possibly restructured, but if Ubi isn't giving them time to do so then ubi bad, ubi shame
---
Cav is good for roaming obviously with her being 3 speed and her ability. Mozzie I find good for being an information gatherer. It depends on your play style. If you like to run around and be aggressive than I'd say Cav
---
i dont it removed, but i want it to be more consistent. doesnt work sometimes.
---
Personally i think that cav can affect the match a lot more, but she is very high skill cap
---
**Pocket sniper was OP**
---
L M A O
---
Thats how it feels like when you try to punch a shield with a hammer
---
For a team none of them is good.
---
person disconnects during loading i dont know how it works but essentially you are stuck in the loading screen your only choice is to quit or wait it out most of the time they wait until you have 2 players then they reconnect and win 
---
Lmao 
---
Like in the middle of a match? That's fucking whack 
---
Her SMG has literally the lowest DPS of any weapon in the game
---
Sometimes I forget that I’m doc, and think my teammates just want to be friends teabaging all over the place. 
---
None of them brings much to the team
---
Maybe cav but she is so easy to counter
---
Agreed man
---
Ok thanks
---
It deals damage, so yes, it distorts his vision if EYENOX is active. 
---
But it also makes noise if you don't electrify it... 
---
They're not looking into shit, if they were the thousands of cheating players they promised to ban and adjust MMR for victims would have been done already but Ubisoft hasn't done a goddamn thing except for fixing the MMR of a couple pro streamers.
---
Well.. if theres a aggresively engaging clash on me.. i guess i dont need my visor to find the enemy anymore :) 
---
I always thought Roni also had an angled grip?

This message has been brought to you by the silver shitter gang 😎😎😎.

Are you a mod? Because that’s....ya know 
---
I mean, it's recoil is fucking jacked, otherwise it's not bad.
---
Mozzie is super helpful what. Being able to have a mobile cam on defense is huge. Especially if they don't realize its been captured.
---
But if it is electric drones can't pass through them, it will cause damage to the enemy (granted hardly any) but in my experience at least, people seem less likely to rush through electric barbed wire vs non-electric. And kaid can more easily than bandit hide the device that causes it.
---
but at least you got the stim amirite
---
So you basically don't have half of the ops

FLASHBANG THROUGH THE DOOR
---
apparently you can shoot the detector and it won't go off
---
Yeah my fastest by far. Thanks!
---
Tell me about it man I’ve dealt with it on Xbox and it’s so annoying. And reporting them does absolutely nothing. I’ve been in a full squad and we all reported him and nothing happened
---
One thing I notice is if someone messes up people instantly go on voice or text chat and mock the person. I mean sure if you want to be angry do it in your room towards the screen not in-game. 90% of the time it ends up in TK’s.
---
I don't like this too be honest, it's messy if you think about it.
---
I would rather see all the broken things get fixed and the general experience (ranked, matchmaking, ...) improved than introducing a new mode that will break even more stuff.
---
Hotkeys are possible on console? I know that quickchat is possible in games like Rocket League but not that I know in R6
---
I really enjoy playing with g36c. At least give it a try!
---
both guns are very much viable, doesnt matter if the gun has a acog or not
---
TANGO SUCKA!
---
Im close to getting close to catching 800 people in frost traps.
---
7+5=12?
---
I am experiencing lag issues I've never had before. All of a sudden my game goes from 70fps to 20. And my drivers are all updated. I tryed closing not needed programs in the background and cleaning the RAM but barely any difference. This happened only after the update. Never before.
---
People shouldn’t be able to purposefully drop down to face easier opponents. 
---
Yeah it turns out helmets don't count as part of the headshot hitbox... actually super annoying. I understand ops like Jaeger with his cans not being part of it, but come on...
---
Little bit of both. 
---
“See into the eyes of Zanzibar”
---
Same issues. My fps drops too. And all of this is happening after the update 
---
Buy all basic operators first.
---
Fps drops? 
---
Fix boosting
---
Change the map-pool to the ESL one (dont even bother putting new maps in if they are bad like hereford and fortress, LIKE ESL DOES)
---
Operator Bans
---
Thats all I need :(
---
2 apex games 
---
I like some Esl maps but do like some are in Ranked that dont wish to go away like Chalet
---
I'm glad it is not just me. Like all of a sudden in the middle of the game the fps dropps to 20 or 25. So wierd.
---
Albeit distasteful i feel like a simple block would be sufficient just because the dude is (I'm assuming using dark edgy humor? (Not sure) does not mean ban him from siege) just block him and you'll never see that account again
---
Indeed man. I was worried too. I thought it had to something with my hardware. But it’s happening in siege only. Also, I can’t send invites and get invites via uplay 
---
Plat 1 mate
---
damn how long have you been playing?
---
The only time you don’t have one is when you need it right? Lol
---
he looks dirty
---
Yet, SJWs are fine with the name "KillAllWhitePeople" and a profile picture of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.
---
well I don't play the game for the lore.. besides i always thought ash is an american like the other 95% of the FBI
---
i wanted to see how it ended :(
---
Why?
---
You cant use aimbot on next gen, but MnK you can, and it’s annoying as fuck, but ubi doesnt care:(
---
Uwu mr. Bajur 
---
If the world was a bus, I'd want off at the next stop. Shit like this is getting ridiculous.
---
Difference between banned and blocked, people are saying TO BLOCK him which is literally not hard to do then THOSE THAT ARE OFFENEDED DON'T SEE IT WOW 
---
Microphone?
---
Awesome.
---
Im a level 211 and I have never seen a collateral 
---
Hold up, what?? How?
---
Not one day after there were kids typing "subscribe to pewdiepie" in chat then team killing everyone. I reached out to ubisoft but got no response. I dont think they care even if I think it is literally as toxic as you can get. 
---
So yeah while I think its wrong I dont think ubi gives a shit. 
---
I can see how IQ and rook in the flat.
---
Flair checks out.
---
what if it was the fortnite bus and ninja was driving it?  
---
nevermind just made it worse
---
I got a legendary for my smoke and that pink camo
---
Hold up, toxicity is kept away? Have you ever played a match on console? I get messaged by someone on the other team almost every other match lmao
---
Who gives a damn, honestly. Her gadget is highly explosive, and so her name is fitting. 
---
It was probably underplayed for a reason 
---
A draw gives each team 1 point
---
Very weird how the fucking auto mods dont flag you for posts like these. But when i do the exact same shit. It instantly gets removed 
---
Gnarly invention called the microphone. Wowzers 
---
Since the end of blood orchid, so a little over a year, lol
---
There’s a full set on this skin , including headgear and uniform
---
A good flex hidden in a redditpost
---
pack exclusive?
---
well yea I agree i'm not mad or anything.. Just felt like pointing it out AS A JOKE so hopefully no one takes my post too seriously
---
Mozzie
---
Yeah only in packs
---
Just go get some raisins, most stores have them. Problem solved! 
---
Operator named Racoon can fit through droneholes. This is his special ability.
---
ooo, guess I'm special
---
Someones trying to act cool for karma, lmao

Hello KlutzyCounty! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

Should you still have any unanswered question, [let the moderation team know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRainbow6 "Click here to compose a modmail message") so they can improve the guide for future buyers.

That would be awesome!

Because you never reinforce kids bedroom.

Cracking into it

Wait a minute that's chalet and not house

This. Buying a lootbox is your decision. You know exactly what the odds are for the items you want.

Rename the skin don’t reinforce

I feel you, I don't think I could have waited the 30 mins either...... :&gt;

^^^^
---
There will be so many days when you deal with total bullshit, you may even take a break and come back and the first game back is more bs. 
---
but if you can deal with it the majority of the time, you will find fun in this game.
---
So is he
---
Shhhhhh
---
Guess I'll just r/wooosh myself then
---
What i wish ubisoft would do is ban ddosers on eu. ban the hackers that can crash your game with the push of a button 
---
What about crates? They're where (almost) all items in the tf2 economy come from, and they're WAY worse than alpha packs.
---
I suppose so, but I got those levels over a rather long timespan, rarely playing bc toxic teammates keep stressing me out
---
Higher expectations are understandable, but I still feel like its straight up toxic to kick a teammate just for not meeting those expectations.
---
is that ella or sofia?
---
No I didn't
---
Zofia then
---
Maybe a consolation. Anyone who was born at the time of Modern Warfare being popular, 1,2 and 3 know to check corners because of Price. The young ones who were born into fortnite or MW series not being popular don’t check corners. Maybe coincidence but what do I know
---
Yea #DroneLivesMatter

Yeah I got this too. Great skin for vektor

I honestly didn’t know that was a thing, thank you

Someone just shot up a mosque full of 50 Muslims with an anti Muslim manifesto and you’re telling me Islamaphobia is hardly a thing
---
Console players have access to the TTS-build on pc, IF they have a pc ofc.
---
LOOOL
---
Its Pc exclusive tho
---
I don’t need to explain why his name insights violence to you when his name is “kill all Muslims” and his profile picture is a mass murderer. I don’t care if you believe in hate speech on a human level I have the decency to hope this guy gets banned for toxic behaviour for how disrespectful they are to the victims of the shooting. You should never hate someone because of their faith and shouldn’t judge so in no way is islamaphobia “warranted” just give up 
---
That would be interesting. Prob as his main weapon and maybe a shotgun/ smg as secondary. Could also work as his ability.
---
no. accuracy is key and dual wield is wildly inaccurate compared to normal 
---
most do it in casual only, because they dont want to spend 10$ on a R6 account (in order to have access to the mail and avtivate 2FA) and rather buy a cracked one for a few cents
---
damn, I'd hate to be that guys who died\\
---
Awesome. 
---
You’re full of shit that was white noise
---
or you can focus on more important things other than what cosmetics others are wearing. it’s a limited event made to be different and to be fun. nobody is making you use the skins but the problem is you whining about what others are using

Islam and Muslims are a different thing let’s get that straight and over 99% of terror attacks are performed by Islamic terrorists therefore it’s not an irrational fear, you take away someone’s speech then what do you have? Other than fascism 
---
Very nice, but did you ace
---
It doesn't work because hipfire isn't viable.
---
Wait... Really? He's one of the only animated things on the map, and he also talks and makes a ton of noise. Surely everyone who's played the map once knows about him.
---
It isn't. Just wait.
---
I just thought I was special. I was camping near that statue and it suddenly started talking. I searched for siege Zanzibar but didn't get any results online. That was when it first got released .. maybe that month. 
---
It is fully installed the whole 58 gb and all the updated 
---
How can you tell his sens is high from this clip?
---
oh god yes... this is the best idea ever
---
Looks good
---
Mute can jam/stop a lot more things than drones. Mozzie can’t do that. Mozzie can steal drones and use them, mute can’t do that. Mozzie is an intel/intel denial op whereas Mute is a straight up denial op. You have just highlighted one similarity and stated because of this, that Mozzie is Mute V2.
---
Excusé me bitch?! xD
---
No, please do go on
---
Yea I'm on ps4 idk if it's better or worse on pc
---
Alt + f4
---
Which platform? The game is not 58 gb.
---
Ps4
---
Wait, that illegal 
---
look how the crosshair skips pixels instead of being smooth, thats a really wide skip
---
For two weeks after I started playing I didn't know you could peak.
---
It's now a running joke whenever I make a bad play my friend says 'just peak bro'
---
Yeah
---
It has the april fools stuff and everything but i cant do online just situations 
---
PS4 isn't bad sometimes but in any rank there's a very good amount of purposely tk'ing 
---
Only reason I am an ela main is cuz Ela is hot and used to be OP and fun to play.
---
Happy cake day
---
That sound like a great idea, however that would mean the user needs to sign up so I can send specific notifications.
---
An easier approach would be a section where you open the app and see how your stats changed to yesterday. Does that sound good as well? 
---
I played with a 4:3 monitor (2006/2007) until September 2017 xD
---
Don’t worry that was my second account. Work on getting comfortable with a few OPs first, then get better with the individuals as you buy them. It actually makes you better to learn each operator individually and slowly.
---
Lmaooo, how? did you stretch the game to. 16:9 at least? 
---
Yeah no let’s keep siege cancer free 
---
Fuze: Come to me my THOT

Alt+F4 resets the game and fixes the problem.

Have you tried switching it off and on again
---
More stuff Fortnite can copy from other games? 
---
To be fair, 90% of the clips posted here are either nothing special and boring, console casual clips or both.
---
I'm not trying to spread hate against console, but as a PC player I can not stand watching bot-like casual players on console.
---
Yes, but i have no clue how reddit formatting works so it removed the middle slash
---
I got a double kill with a shotgun last night 
---
One word. Mozzie.
---
Hey, that name doesn’t make me toxic
---
I feel like "UwU Pwesidential Pwane OwO" would've been way funnier
---
Why are you on this sub? 
---
But Blitz is an attacker
---
Bye
---
from alpha packs im assuming
---
i got the plasma pink universal skin, grand inquisitor for doc/rook mp5, mack daddy skin for the DE.  recently got the billiard stick skin for frost's smg.  and that stupid fkn little angel chibi i got a few weeks ago.  
---
u/confessions has been kicked from Realism
---
It's a joke my guy
---
It depends on what color it would be because this and the last season would make it look like shit, literally. It's not bright like her other ones which go with her and her petsonality pretty well. But it'd be nice to see what it could look like,  but it's ubisoft so they'd still fuck her up when more than they already have. 
---
This actually looks cool, I would absolutely appreciate this change. Imagine how much easier it would be instead of having to wait for the screen to load just to see the different attachments.
---
For me that hasn’t been working in months
---
That’s why I posted it on the Subreddit so Ubi may see it 
---
*u/confessions has been erased from existence, banished to the nth circle of hell where copy pasters are forced to create original content to escape their torture but can only recreate known content* 
---
I haven't encountered any this blatant. But I have been noticing a lot of people who seem to always know which side of a building is safe to enter and when to peak when someone isn't looking a lot more lately. I feel like there will be a big ban wave coming again.
---
Oh Shit haven‘t thought about that you must be right 
---
&gt;This is what one of my friends had discussed with me. He expressed fear that not all maps will be played enough. I think this wouldn't happen. The only maps that won't be picked are the maps that are bad, which in turn makes it clear to Ubi, what they have to do to improve.
---
CS:GO, COD, Battlefield, PUBG are all games that offer some form of map voting (sometimes the first map is random and then voting is allowed) and every one of them has the same characteristic.  Certain maps become auto-selects and other maps are avoided like the plague.  In the end, a very small subset of the maps are played a vast majority of the time because as players experience more hardship getting the off-meta maps they eventually acquiesce to the meta maps.  After several weeks/months, Siege becomes a game where 80%+ of matches are played across three maps.
---
&gt;Also, I value much more the ability to be super familiar with a map. Variety is very good, but I don't want forced variety where I have no input on the maps that I will play on. Instead, if I don't know a map well, let me pick it and play it until I am comfortable with having it in my repertoire.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree on the first point.  I would much rather have variety personally.
---
On the less subjective front, allowing teams/players to pick and choose their map will have an impact on the meaning of ranks.  Teams who specialize on a single map will be compared against teams who are playing across a larger collection of maps which isn't a fair comparison.
---
Ho no
---
r/woooosh 
---
I don’t want to play with you anymore. 
---
Nobody said its new
---
I play console and I know it’s shit
---
Or just use your mic lol
---
40 drone is not hard? Youre delusional. Ok then tell me, why should i hunt down more drones if the most ill get is some forgettable rare charm? Im sure youve got all the answers. 
---
Sledge mains be like
---
I thought this was some college football thing
---
Well, you don't know what exactly is in the canister.
---
Maybe not universal it seems to detailed for that

Why do you use pounds and meters in the same context?
---
'Doors and corners kid, that's how they get you.'
---
Where's da bloody sauce!
---
They should be banned to them lol
---
Is this his new buff?
---
Actually no. I figured you just go to the sub, change flair, then select the defensive main, but apparently not because that didn’t work. So, u/sunnglases help please?
---
Well... Yeah. An ace is actually 6 kills in a single round. L2p.
---
\+20 HP if you have the sponsor skin.
---
I only like meme characters/cosmetics in every game I play, so this was the first set of items in Siege I instantly wanted. I'm planning on mixing and matching the Bacon Blackbeard set with the Princess set to make an abominatoon.
---
It only means that they are no longer obtainable, but you can still open them.
---
Any other meaning would be pretty assholeish. 
---
Yeah that sounds good
---
"Haha my gameplay is just like an action movie, I'm so cool"
---
That is one of the most underwhelming legendaries Ive seen
---
I started playing during velvet shell.
---
It just happens, it happened to m as well with Sledge when I began the game (but in Oregon).
---
He just activates ultra instinct out of nowhere
---
I'm sure there is some but it may go largely unseen.
---
Mother if God...
---
It was easy for me. I just had a common spot where drones would come in and I’d sit there waiting, get 2 or 3 drones, and run back to OBJ or wherever and setup defenses and stuff 
---

Ubi: makes a legendary skin that doesnt even change the default
---
Me: why are you gay?
---
Depends. Some pros play with different sensitivity for ads to be more precise. If you come from CS, then you are right... It should be easier to handle if the sens is 1:1, but later on, it might come to a disadvatage as this game more often than not involves pixel peaks.

---
This is not true btw.  Operator models are scaled to the same height and so is the hitbox, that much is true, but the hitbox isn't the same on all operators (although some operators with almost the same build have the same hitbox). Clothing shouldn't be part of the hitbox since operation health (so earmuffs and stuff doesn't count), however in some cases this seems to not be the case (for example on kapkans hitbox some parts of the baggy trousers on the side are part of the hitbox somehow). Gridlock does have a bigger hitbox and Ash's hitbox is actually relatively small compared to others but overall the differences aren't that big.

Yeah but then nobody would really use the chat, because not many people are going to buy and hook up external chat pads or keyboards.

When my mic broke I used my phone with the PS Messages app and it worked surprisingly well. Though I guess an R6 app like that would be hard since you're always in different matches

Lmao, you’re saying I’m the lucky one for playing there game &amp; supporting it? They’ve done these shitty drone challenges so much, so I’d say they’re getting more out of it
---
Still an ace if you kills everyone in the single round.

Condom? Did you mean condone?

Client-side bs why can't they just upgrade their potato ass servers so we can play server-side

Oh yeah, I think it is worth it. I will be like Beaulo!

So it's a Lover Lamp? 😂
---
Seriously most players just don't bother to clear the map before moving onto site. And if they do then they do it way too slowly and waste time. 
---
If you can keep the enemy hunting you down for a minute then you've done your job. 
---
How is baiting cancer in general lol, it's intelligent gameplay
---
Wheres the sauce? This needs to be more Italia!
---
I wish they would but I don't think it will happen as it hasn't happened so far in the nearly 4 year life span of this game.
---
Thank you very much, if you like it - consider leaving a rating which helps me alot!

Clash is worse, IMO.

I agree he can be good for holding an obj but he is immobile, and on top of that he really doesn't do anything for the team

The irony lmao

An Ace is 5 kills (the entire enemy team) in a round. 
---
Even though it can be useful, ability wise, I think Finka is the worst. Don’t get me wrong, it’s saved my life but when its active it makes that adrenaline sound which can cover some noise for defenders unfortunately
---
It used to be that way but people complained too much about getting stuck in a bad situation so ubi changed it

If you re post this please credit my IG @i_am_sledge_

Yeah siege is 4 years old and still supported but cs go is 7 years old and is still more popular. Tf2 is still somewhat supported and is more than 10 years old. But yes a little more atmospheric parts of the game that can add to the characters would be nice, because whats the point of new characters when they're done nothing with them for story.  They can make everyone a recruit with a different gadget and it'd still feel the same since the game even at full price has no story mode which is really bullshit since the offline modes are fucking boring as all hell and I had to sit my ass through all of them on hard and play for almost half an hour trying to get a smoke grenade kill.

Don't forget the professional gaming clothes and glasses.

I just wanted you to paste this particular link cause of this part:
---
&gt; The Germans were delighted with this outcome. They were happy to give up  a provincial rail centre to Poland; it was a small sacrifice indeed. It  spread the blame of the partition of Czechoslovakia, made Poland an  accomplice in the process and confused the issue as well as political  expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) – a charge that Warsaw was hard put to deny. 
---
It wasn't colaboration, it was a trick that nazi germany used to make it look like poles are their allies.
---
There are so many things wrong with this. The grenade not going off, the barricade not breaking. Siege is getting worse and worse as it goes on. One time I shot a Smoke in the head, almost a full clip, he took no damage and I got one shot by his shotty :v
---
But since it just makes them slow,
---
IMO it would be interesting to see the time of the wall reinforcement animation changed to the Outbreak one, but I think that Prep Phase should then be adjusted as well. But if you think about the attackers at the same time, they are at a huge disadvantage with placing the drones, so I'm currently fine with the one in place.
---
Thanks.

I agree. I could clean it up. I did it for a friend and posted it here because why not! I didn't expect it to get that many upvotes lol!

The grenade broke the castle barricade but debris is client sided so when u didn’t peek as if broke the screen probably didn’t render it.
---
Thank you forgot the word
---
How many upvotes are there? For me it just says upvote button but i cant see the number of upvotes. Little things like that bug the hell outta me please someone tell me.
---
No need to be rude. I intend for this to be an actual question because I didn't know what happened. But thanks I guess :/
---
Nothing like that is available to the public. Maybe one day. but not now
---
You've clearly never spawnpeeked as Tachanka
---
The handle of a shield cuz who rly runs fuze with a shield
---
This is actually ridiculous. It's been how long since this skin got accidentally removed, and it's still not back yet? How much work could it possibly take to put this back in, or even just give us a refund on renown? I really want my skin back, but if they're not going to add it back, give me my renown back.
---
No, I'm 11, I'm not used to drawing digital
---
As others say, it’s likely just a placebo effect. Although I agree with that, for some reason I just like the iron sights on the SMG 11 more than the reflex holo or red dot.
---
But if you didn't hit anything with the grenade then why did you get 100xp? I can't tell there is way too much jpeg in this.
---
I would like to also create an addendum to have every voice line predicated with "Wow."

"Wow. Got us a drone!"

"Wow. They're reloading!"

How many fps. I play R6 on the console so I am used to 30 fps. Thanks for the reply :)

Sledge. Not because he's terrible. But Buck is just him but better
---
is it still available in the shop or has it just disappeared for those who have already purchased it AND in general?
---
Dude as much as I agree with you, if you want to criticize shield ops this is the wrong place to do it lmao. The silvers in this sub will defend shields till the end of the earth.

Duh, of course! That would be very foolish to do indeed!

Hello Cool_Soft, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/baw26d/after_updating_to_windows_10_my_game_is_plagued/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Choosing whether you reload or not is part of the strategy. It can determine either you kill the other one or not. Quick thinking is a part of this game. 
---
So choosing the right moment, or at least the one we choose, to reload is very important.
---
If you look I got a kill with the grenade which shows where the co comes from
---
had to check the kill feed just to make sure this wasn’t me
---
I think he means his personal most played my friend.
---
it's kind of a fast paced close quarters game. more than likely you'll encounter someone and you want a chance to counter that person just in case. it's a just a chance to fight back when possible. imagine reloading your gun and force to complete that animation while someone round the corner? there will be way more complaints.
---
If you look I got a kill with the grenade which shows where the xp comes from
---
I hope ubi and we are on one *line* a spaghetti *line*

---
Woah bro I play on console too but I average 50-55 FPS , heck on some maps even 60
---
Ubi: good suggestion, noted.
---
*Y6S2
---
Ubi: We are adding priority/preferences to random operator selection.
---
5 kills (not counting TK) is an ace no matter what.
---
Even if you’re bomb gets defused but you kill all the attackers you get an ace.
---
If you lose the game 2-4 but got an ace on the 2nd round , you still got an ace. The fact that you lost the round is irrelevant
---
Only meastro knows how to make italiano spaghetti “italian accent”
---
I’m deff learning man. But I guess I’m just frustrated. Idk. The game is so fun and I’m so bad. I have super sick moments but mainly I’m maybe 1-3 kills.
---
Change the bullets in the game to shooting pizzas

3 words: Aiming with controller
---
I'm guessing this is a laptop since I can only find a GT 540M. The 540M is massively slower then the minimum requirment for rainbow six siege. The GTX 460 gets 30-40fps on all low settings 1080p
---
1.3K
---
Yeah that looks pretty cool dude
---
R6 is 60 (or targeted at 60) on console.
---
Yeah I mean I like far cry games but I just didn't like the ancient setting
---
Of course it doesn't excuse Poland, that wasn't my point. However stating that they were on German side is not true, that's what I'm talking about.
---
I did look, but as I said there is so much jpeg in this that what you got the xp for is unreadable. That's why I asked what it was for.  
---
  
---
Now I'm convinced the xp was for breaking the castle baracade as you have exhibited very poor reading and comprehension skills.
---
Not as difficult as people say it is. I've never had a problem with it and neither has anyone I know. People used to accuse one of my friends of using mnk when he was on controller
---
Idk how I could get my CS sens to be the same as Siege, or if that would even be a good idea.
---
My CSGO sensitivity is extremely low. Like if someone is behind me, I can’t turn around and shoot them - a lot of people run sensitivity like this. 
---
It’s so low so I can keep the crosshairs at head level at all times, and always be ‘aiming’.
---
This wouldn’t work so well with siege because CSGO really only has 3 head levels. Standing , crouched, prone. Very rarely are people on top of things, and if they are you know the location of those objects before you enter the room / area they’re in.
---
In siege there may be some common pre-fire locations, but there are way too many variables for you to run a low CSGO-like sensitivity
---
*DOC COME ON MAN!*
---
Just trow a emp nade and rush
---
wow this is everything i’ve been missing in life
---
I went around the corner so he wouldn’t kill me because the claymore was too far to detonate on him. The original goal was to corner him, claymore and move behind it with him and get us both. It’s part of many of my Ying clips doing the same exact thing.
---
I think they're future proof. They only recently started doing this kind of thing, like with Halloween house, so they'll probably just recycle content each year and maybe add something to it like more operators/outfits.
---
The shields flash can melt reinforced walls
---
It isn't. These events get people playing the game and more importantly for Ubi gets cosmetic purchases. Events also act as advertisements as streamers will play event playlists especially gimmicky ones like this. By artificially limiting the event it also boosts cosmetic sales. I guarantee they make more than enough $ with limited time events to justify the resources spent creating them
---
Good work mate
---
You fucker
---
I say we have mnk allowed in game and if you use mnk you match up with other mnk users it wouldn’t entirely solve the problem but it would significantly reduce the issue
---
recruit elite is all we need

the first post not complaining abt toxicity?? fuck yeah op! keep this up
---
Sigh, still only seeing what you want to see. 
---
&gt; Funnily enough that is what my first reply to you explains. I said that the xp was for the kill.  
---
 
---
Yes, and then you went on to claim I couldn't clearly read that even though I had already told you I could not clearly read what it was for and that's why I was asking. I literally just said this in the previous comment. Is it really that hard for you to full read people's comments?
---
When they want the last kill instead of planting. They deserved to lose.

You will never EVER Convince me that isn't ramen.

Toxics are everywhere
---

---
-Laws of Siege
---
the only solutions add more problems that are worse. 
---
if they add native MnK support on console and they DONT queue controller users and MnK users then the problem is worse. unless you buy a MnK you won’t be able to get out of gold. ever. i play console with a controller and do not want to have to buy and learn a MnK just to keep up. if you want to use MnK then go play PC. 
---
if they queue MnK users separate from controller users then it solves literally nothing. people use a Xim to have an unfair advantage over controller users. native support will stop no one from using their Xim adapters. the problem stays the same here. if you want to use MnK go play PC
---
Okay extended it but PLEASE return the menu and soundtrack to normal Burnt Horizon PLEASE!
---
Sooooo looks like that might have been an old feature, changed it and now cant add a second one back...thanks guys...

lol in what way would it reduce it. people use Xim adapters to have an unfair advantage over controller users. why would they stop using them to be matched with controller players
---
Just think “fancy barret”
---
great positivity unlike a good amount of people
---
It wouldn’t solve anything. The way the adapters work is by tricking your console into thinking your MnK inputs are coming for a controller. These types of split lobbies would still put these people in controller lobbies

It’s what I do best

3. these posts are so obnoxious. nobody cares what you got from your alpha pack and people care even less what you think about it.

people like to isolate incidents so it makes it seem like they get nothing but toxic incidents  but in reality the ratio of normal to toxic moments are  pretty normal.

Holy crap that's a lot

I thought he was killed by buck, not frost. Since buck is an attacker and he was killed by an attacker I thought he must be a defender

It feels a lot like it did that last time there was a huge ban wave. Just a lot of shady games where you question everything about yourself. Then they banned them all and suddenly the game feels normal again.

I can not believe it's just me that I'm loathing that pink home screen and stupid skins for a 17+ ESRB game that was once focused on being the closest to the real.

You'd be actively recording your point of view only. To have the flexibility that theatre mode offers, they would need to keep a record of every player positions, movement, actions and destruction for the duration of the match. Theatre mode is something you think about while you're making the game, it's usually something you'd implement from the ground up.

If you bought the starter edition it ONLY comes with those ops. Ubisoft gave the base ops to all the versions above the starter edition so it makes sense you don’t have them

Do you play with friends? Instead of buying r6 credits, my buddies just use a booster so we have 3 or 4 boosters activated at once (x140%). I get almost 1k renown a game. Do it on a weekend and before we know it we're rich.

Same with me, when you have all ops the only thing left for you to grind for is next season’s ops, who needs the season pass??

It’s still fun when it does go down. It’s been a great opportunity for me to make new friends and reconcile with some of my old friends (that and I’d like to not have to throw away something that costs 60$ and I spent another $80+ on).

---
Now you're repeating yourself, if you want me to send you a video showing you the difference I can. You can see in the video that the smg-11's recoil only raised the reticle to about the balcony, but on pc a full magazine will raise the reticle above the roof of Chalet, which is more than double the recoil.
---
How’s your internet been? Because I can say with my experience that you can magdump into someone and do no damage. Just a week ago, I lit up a jaeger for 0 damage or blood coming out (I have a clip to prove it) and then I was killed by a frost I couldn’t see because my internet was being stupid.
---
I hope they add another challenge at least and this time I don’t get the cats paw charm...
---
Bruh should be taking note unless in study hall or activity
---
I just tested it, dumping a whole mag of an Smg11 on console will do the same, if you want a video i’ll gladly upload it too.

Slap a drum mag on it.

Nice Idea but I dont really think it *looks* nice

IQ didnt lose her nandos cause she was out playing Thatcher, she lost them because she was out playing everyone. She had the full package, everything. And that wasn't right, so she lost her nandos. Besides, on a coordinated team she's still extremely viable.

Google the problem or search for it in the FAQs on Ubi. Otherwise, open a ticket with the support.

Oh  you’re not the only one

Ever see a smurf with a .6 k/d?

Just imagine a 3 speed blitz with an extended monty shield and you can shoot out through the glass which has the original Blackbeard shield, the pistol is also a 40 round machine revolver which does 70 body shot and has a fire rate of smokes smg that is the siege we want
---

---
Todo List from all the feedback:
---
1. Make it for iOS (will take a while tho)
---
2. Daily progression feature
---
3. Seasonal k/d w/l
---
4. More detailed stats page
---
5. Less intrusive ads (I thought I managed that well, but oh well the user is the king)
---
6. Maybe split up the subscription fee (so all future features will be available for my lovely supporters) and one time ad removal fee (have to think about this business wise)
---
Thank you everyone!

Hehehehe

boi yoh came at me real sideways at the end, it was simply a suggestion, they literally do plan on reworking thatcher, i was saying how they should have done it, giving him 5 emps that disable things for a short amount of time would be much more preferable to defenders than 3 that outright destroy the gadget, if theyre disabled, they can still work later in the round, and i said 4 or 5, we wouldnt know how balancing should be until it starts getting tested so i threw a number out there
---
and they said it made IQ less team- oriented  well, without grenades, i feel IQ has a way harder time of getting gadgets, like, way too hard, thatcher throws an EMP at a wall and destroys everything, yet IQ has to walk above or below an objective or just CANT DESTROY THOSE GADGETS AT ALL,  i feel IQs gadget is really weak without the nades, if they like nerfed her in other aspects and gave her back grenades i could see her being balanced
---
im obv not a dev, and saying is easier than doing
---
but thats what i use reddit for, to SAY what im thinking, and one guy giving me attitude for using my head to come up with an idea for adjusting both ops isnt going to stop me, i use reddit to spitball ideas, and i wont stop just because you are annoyed that i even attempted to talk about the game when not holding a dev badge, its a theory or at least a half-baked idea, calm tf down, im one guy coming up with a reddit post, youre acting like i tried scribbling in the dev bible

No need to be rude, just want to report what seems to me like a bug. I got hit in the head above the shield by the enemy, but on the killcam it broke my shield and killed me instantly. Maybe it's a TIL, but I want to be sure.

I don't know but I can definitely send you my steam profile hours as proof that it took that long
