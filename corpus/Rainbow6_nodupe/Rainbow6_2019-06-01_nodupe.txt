No, you are clearly being a douche. I‚Äôm new for reddit, I don‚Äôt use it that often so I don‚Äôt really know what ‚Äúkarma‚Äù is. Also you contradicted yourself. He typed it by accident the face because he didn‚Äôt know that typing the face was against the rules apparently. Idk why you are defending the fact that someone got banned for typing 3 slashes in the chat. You are super dense and there is no reason to argue about it anymore because of that reason. Good day.

Question: why does no one use a scope on Bandits smg?
---
Listen dude, people are dumb. It had like a 75% success rate.

BattlEye monitors applications running on your PC for things that look/act like hacks.  It does absolutely nothing against people who exploit glitches or act toxic toward other people.  While it's not impossible for hacks to exist on console, at this point if there are such hacks they are so rare that it certainly isn't worth the cost to try to put something like BattlEye into the console version.

The most significant factor would be the 144 Hz as opposed to the 1440p.  The extra resolution is nice to have but is unlikely to do much for your performance, but a faster refresh can help with how quickly you receive updated information on the game state.  Getting both is the best of both worlds (provided you aren't accepting a ton of input lag to do so), but any performance boost you see will come from the higher refresh and not resolution.
---
Holy shit I never even realised that.

It's obvious you didn't

Not really, on ps4 at least. The touchpad is also a directional button. You could just uses either side to lean in either direction.

I just started the game 3 months ago and its absence was one of the first things I was surprised about.

I think they said something about completely removing the system we have now and would implement a csgo like system where you can play with lower/higher ranks only if you 5 man squad. Hopefully we get it soon

Again, literally just a quick glance. Less than a second.
---
Misclicks.
---
Did you manage to fix it?
---
No scope no problem
---
Again, just gonna copy paste this here right quick:
---
Yes you can purchase them with renown, however the option to purchase it with credits exemplifies the issue as someone with a large wallet could just drop a certain amount on the game and get every op, whereas someone grinding it out has to wait for a much larger amount of time. 
---
This same issue was present with the battlefront II launch and it was called out as pay to win. I'm confused as to why it's not called out for this game
---
That's your fault. Ubi cant magically make you not misclick.
---
It‚Äôs all gone now. Hahahahaha
---
Battlefront II is no longer pay to win btw. And yes I'm not defending battlefront for what it had at launch but what I'm talking about is purely playable characters, such as Vader or Ela
---
ik you are trying to be funny but you just seem cringy as the dude with the r/woooosh joke

BRUH. JUST RESTART THE QUEUE AFTER A FEW MINUTES.

I don't really have a main anymore, I just picked ying when I discovered the option on reddit, I'm not good enough to be a toxic ying, I mostly take advantage of the 81 rounds mag and that's about it.. I just love the LMG.. gridlock's one is very cool too.
---
How about this? Added ability: If a defender kills attacking teammate, John wick can walk over to his/her body, cries in pain, feels the urge to get revenge, then becomes a 3.5 speed, and sees a lion-style outline around the defender who killed said teammate for 15 seconds.

Oh okay I see. I hate the idea of maining ops like Ying and Blitz until the counter (again, Warden) comes out. Gridlocks LMG is amazing. Love the reload rate although the recoil isn‚Äôt amazing but I mean you can‚Äôt have it all üòÇ sorry for being so aggressive
---
I guess it just looks a bit different because it's on a different gun? Maybe it's something to do with the model of the gun, It's shape or size? C8-Sfw with black ice does also look a bit different from other black ice skins.

---
Pay to win is any system where a player can purchase something that is not superficial or cosmetic.
---
I want this to be categorically broad because I believe that things like owning multiple accounts in some MMOs is a pay to win aspect if the accounts award a game play advantage that was perhaps not intended.
---
For example, owning multiple accounts in EVE improves your horizontal character progression by being able to do more things more quickly. This provides a player with multiple accounts an advantage over a player with just one.
---
Or in FFXI, having multiple accounts allows you to quickly earn more gil due to certain dungeons being on an hour lockout. By having say 3 accounts a player can reduce their down time to 0 instead of being stuck waiting on a timer to grind money.
---
So, I got about 18 duplicates and 3 legendary. The duplicates amounted enough points for me to get two more packs.

I bought the all red skin with the (rainbow currency?) i got from buying the game and haven‚Äôt changed it since
---
Wow lision trap =LEGO
---
Well to do that they would have to get ride of the deployment effect, and allow you to quickly change the position her prisma is in. That would be kinda broken. I guess I just don't think she needs a change and the kinda skill gap she has is really necessary
---
Ah yes, Power Rangers VS Super Sentai
---
Fuck ranked.
---
It would make retakes on a lot sites basically impossible, especially ones where you can plant right inside a window. It would make BB crazy OP. Windows are already a really strong position in the game, but like most things it comes with the risk that someone is going to run out and deal with you. Lose one fight to a window player then suddenly one or more of your rotations are gone because they can literally sit there staring at it while you have no idea at what height they could be at.
---
Probably.

Why do more objectives need to be viable to defenders on plane? If we removed made it so Monty couldn't extend his shield then there would be more objectives viable to defenders but what's the problem trying to be fixed?
---
Ment to add it was all his idea
---
It's been a part of the game since release, so as scummy as it may seem, it's a legitimate and common strategy that you, as a player, would be expected to adapt to. The only big issue is when the peek is too OP and cannot be reasonably countered in any situation.
---
Could ubi make the common / uncommon skins in pristine condition. Thank.
---
That was the most console firefight ever

Late game then the match continues, but for the first minute or so if someone disconnects the game would end. Can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve had a teammate get spawnkilled round 1 and leave. Yeah it sucks for the team who was ‚Äúwinning‚Äù but it‚Äôs better for the community

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
depends on what the enemy team uses :) 
---
if you see that they consistently use valk/echo/mozzie on defense nokk might work pretty well, although she will be really useful against a team that uses cams and communicates = at higher tiers (plat+)
---
warden should be a little bit easier to use tho - his ability is also very situational, but apart from blocking flashes, the glasses also allow you to see through smoke, so basically he's countering two of the defenders gadgets.
---
Buy a booster, get a friend, play yerroirst hun classic on house. Easy 6 to 10k renown per hour.

When you shoot a teammate and deal 20 damage u lose 20 damage, if u shoot them in the head u get shot in the head

No I am saying bullets should damage and pierce the hostage just like players
---
You‚Äôre spectating. That window is likely already open from ash‚Äôs POV. This happens a lot.
---
Why are u using red dot and nice
---
I dont think you're playing ela right. 
---
1. The mines are best used to counter shield ops and should be used as more of an alarm then a weapon.
---
2. Her SMG is one of the fastest in the game (second only to the SMG 12/11. And along with the angled grip you can rush an attacker, get up close and use the angled grip to draw Ur weapon quickly enough to melt them in seconds.
---
3. Her pistols damage doesn't matter, the reason its good is the red dot sight, it's great for spawnpeaking, 1 taps, actually seeing shit when U ads and won't let you down if you can hit your shots.
---
4. The barbed wire and shield are also both great against shields, it either slows them or forces them to expose themselves when they vault it. Basically she's the ultimate shield counter.
---
It looks nice
---
Any1 know what date season 2 starts
---
hahaha i get ya man, hate shield bums. its poo poo no skill play. if ever i get them at random, its shield on back and pistols forward. have some sense of honour hahaha
---
Go read another comment I did as a reply that literally gives you every bit and detail as to why she really is bad.
---
Not a bad idea. But let's separate it from normal t-hunt. Then it'll be fine.
---
What‚Äôs your gamer tag?
---
Right
---
Just me or a bunch of legendaries are bad
---
I believe that lil' sign says Izhmash, isn't that the Kalashnikov concern?
---
Would highly suggest Zofia, Lesion, Ying, or Dokkaebi (not sure if she costs 20k now). All of them are highly flexible for most team comps and easy to use.
---
Ooh this is older gameplay. I just love the way the reticle shakes when you shoot. Too bad it was the cause of recoil misalignment :(
---
He was above you
---
Um yay?
---
This is what happens when you take Jager‚Äôs ACOG!!!
---
Am I the only one that thinks this looks kinda cool. I totally understand that frustration, but this pretty clean.
---
Best charm
---
That is because he had no kills  3 assists and I had 2 kills no assists
---
Might've been ddos'd, did you and your team's long jump up beforehand
---
reminder that [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9hha9a/docs_legendary_headgear_tavernier_bleu_is_nerfed/) exists in-game
---
Better than fixing a motorbike for 3 monthes
---
I don't remember why but I usually don't use it
---
Sounds like you can't control recoil
---
I remember there being a spawn peek on chalet where the enemy team can see you spam in and kill you before you can even move. Some spots are still pretty similar to that(construction spawn on Oregon). Hell, even the newest map has some of the worst spawn peek zones in the entire game. This isn‚Äôt at all an issue that people should be expected to adapt to. This is a problem that Ubisoft should do much more to help combat since it‚Äôs an objectively bad strategy that is only used to get cheap kills. The closest thing I can think of to spawn peeking in Siege is noob tubing in MW2. There were spots where you can shoot the noob toob in the sky and kill the other players from spawn and infinity ward fixed it by making it so explosives don‚Äôt detonate after around 6 seconds or something like that. It‚Äôs been almost 4 years and Ubisoft still hasn‚Äôt done anything to fix this issue besides apply bad aids to some of the really bad spawn peeking spot but the problem still plagues this game and Ubisoft needs to address it.
---
They would've modeled more but D A T A L I M I T S

*thatcher has entered the chat*

---
Things I disagree with you about:
---
Thermite, IQ, Mira, Nomad, Valkyrie, Smoke and Blackbeard all should be higher.  Ying, Vigil, Kapkan and Jackal should be lower.  Zofia and Echo should be lower.
---
I'm not sure what tier your'e playing where Kapkan could be considered a better defender than Valk or Mira.  Mira's obviously situational but on the right points she's easily the best defender.  Valkyrie is insane in the right hands as prefiring people you've scouted is how you win past silver.
---
Nomad's gadget can't be countered and with the right placement is one of the best counter-roaming devices around.  That's huge.  Blackbeard is the best peeking OP in the game and is devastating, being able to survive a headshot is super strong.
---
Im more pissed off about the price/rarity relation, that makes even less sense.
---
Same rarity uniforms but one cost 12.500 and other 25.000 renown lmao
---
Legendary means you can only get it from alpha packs you mongoloids

I like the idea, but it should drop off at range to keep them suited solely to close range. We don‚Äôt want the pre-nerf Super 90 situation again.
---
I only put her there because without a team she's not that great and she's very situational.
---
No, if you have a friend who plays on the PC and you play on the console .. you can play with him but will play against PC gamers.
---
I don't think people seem to realize that any skin Ubi puts into alpha packs is going to be legendary, we have yet to get anything (besides some charms) new in alpha packs that isn't legendary. There is no choice needed, it simply automatically fills that slot.

You must be new here if you do not remember the horrors of the shotgun era when you could get outsniped by a super 90 or valks shotgun. 
---
*shivers*
---
Shotguns are in a good place right now, they don't need any changing in my opinion.
---
I wouldn't consider the bosg or the tcsg 12 to be true shotguns, they're closer to rifles due to the headshot multiplier and the single projectile nature
---
People of different ranks can get into games of ranked with differently ranked people as the person who sets the match the opponents will have that ranked as well

YESSSS

And casual bases you on your skill level the higher level people you are around means the better you are basically

Yeah, i know.

Notice you got the Hyperx Cloud Alpha.

Have you used the Hyperx Cloud2 before and which do you think is a better buy?

(cuz my cloud 2's leathers all peeling off)

nah, shitty players (notice that the people who say that stuff are usually low ranked) just get pissy over that stuff for God knows what reason, and don't understand how team play works. this is a team/objective game not a killing game. keep up what you're doing chief you're fine
---
Fucking seriously.  My first skin was one of those for Ying.  Shit is barely noticeable as a skin.
---
You should post on this reddit more often. Great work
---
I play a lot too, so I'm not trying to say it's happening every match because if it did I would not be playing. It's just something I noticed. It is annoying but I'm not angry cause theres really no fix. I have seen a lot disconnections I was playing with a friend yesterday and she disconnected 3 times in about two hours.

Ah, ok.

Black Ice doesn't exist for her AR because Black Ice was a Year 1 skin. Her AR didn't exist.

Well figured out what to do. There‚Äôs a chance I could get it on this account because of the rewards can possibly link up with the account, which giving it the skins and such. But not a guarantee.

Check Shadowplay's mic settings. It may be set to the wrong mic. Also if you set Shadowplay to record mic and audio and game audio on two different tracks/channels, you'll need to merge them with a video editor (or just set it back to single).

To clarify, this went on for the entire ranked match

Interesting..

Seing thatcher gadget could turn off light only for a mere second

Aside from that I just usually End up playing against a lot og sweaty players in casual.   Constant Run outs, spawn peaks and rushers

Warden is 2weak. Give him smokes or make his smoke vision passive or reduce him to a 2 armor so he can actually get in place fast enough to counter peak or give his MPX an ACOG.

What would be the point of FMG-9 then?
---
Do you mean slug? I always wondered why it had the acog option, good to know!

Fans would go Crazy if they saw Sam Fisher in a Rainbow Six Siege trailer !!! Just like when Fighting Games add Guest Characters to their game. It would be to hype!!!
---
Yeah sorry autocorrect you can hit headshots on plan from the far door to fire truck by front entrance with ease  recoils a little high but not to bad if you don‚Äôt rapid fire it.
---
People value kills more then obj and winning which is sad, because this isn‚Äôt cod, and people say you‚Äôre trash just because you have 1 or 2 kills even though you‚Äôve been playing support the whole game

Never: How is the canister :,(

I got this about a month ago,and I fucking love it
---
Holy shit, I did not know collaterals are a thing in siege.
---
That stuff happens figuratively all the time in CS:GO, but maybe its rarer in siege cause only the OTS-03 can do it?
---
Are the legendary skins usually weak or something? I've never got one.
---
congrats! I'm like level 119 with 700ish hours
---
Confla what now?
---
Nope.
---
Get used to playing important operators like thermite and hibana. By that I don't mean see if you enjoy them, get used to playing them most the time. You need to be hard on yourself to stop playing the same operates every time
---
Read the title dude
---
Random chance to get a random item,wow
---
But then how am I going to make a reddit post with 600hrs queue time?
---
I played hibana for a while and got sick of the secondary smg when they got hit with terrible recoil, i used to have hibana+Mira instead of iq cause iq sucks but frags came and went.
---
WELCOME TO MY MINE

I've had this glitch before. Restarting the game fixed it for me
---
Use pistol

Only Legendary i've ever packed was Ash's FBI outfit.
---
Yep. Sexy

I‚Äôm on xbox, which has a pretty toxic community to start with. It‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôve been here since end of year 1 and have no plans of leaving. This season was just a rough one. Here‚Äôs to hoping next season is better!
---
I could play her again but that doesnt change mira and the time ive wasted on so many other ops i no longer play :/

As a Maverick main I'd love to have this skin
---
Then there is Europe ranked 
---
If I get teamkilled by a Spanish 8 year old one more time for not roaming as doc...
---
So we're back in the mine
---
Yup even I got this one and it's good enough to make me play with mavs AR instead of M4
---
Ah a typical disgusting lion main.
---
Reflex , red dot and Holographic : are we a joke to you ?
---
Ikr?
---
*loads PEST launcher with malicious intent*

Payday 2 already did it
---
Jackal too
---
What's the "smonk" reference to? (Not trying to be sarcastic/rude, just curious)
---
Yeah. Pretty accurate
---
i never said i dont like those, i love the reflex but i only got to play ash ACOG twice and i want more
---
*chucks girzmot mines at random people*

Oh wow, just looked that up; pretty cool. But even so I feel like R6 would be way more interesting.

But did you win the round?!?!?

Seem a few pros accidentally flick on the hostage, the reactions are hilarious, or when they are hiding behind the hostage and end up killing him/her cus of their movements

If you say stuff that makes it seem like you don't know what you're talking about/straight up don't read my replies I'm going to judge what you say. It's the internet, these comments are literally all I have to base everything about you on.

Yes esports ready.
---
If they aren't clearly marked with Red Crosses they have no protection.
---
There are rules for this sort of thing you know. Medical personnel are required to wear marking distinguishing then from combatants
---

Reminds me of spy crab
---
I would pull ela's nose ring.  üëÄ
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
good cosplay tho
---
If you really believe they weren't marked, then good for you.
---
I think that this discussion has moved way past the original content poster's intention. I agree that it is on the defenders to make objectives viable, where possible. But Ubi have to do certain things to make the game work overall. This is a good move towards that.
---
I literally got this yesterday, I was so pissed.

100% agree, it's better to have an underpowered operator for 2-3 seasons than another Ela 1.0.
---
I only get ones legenderi skin, doc shotgunü§¨
---
Now put on frost trap and kaid's electric claw.
---
Were they? Got a picture? When it happened I don't recall seeing any Red Cross markings on them in the pictures I saw.
---
I‚Äôve never seen someone get banned on xbox
---
You guys are so fucking thirsty, God damn.
---
Give him unique guns, recycling old guns is kind of lazy in my opinion, especially since there are so many
---
Sometimes I feel like Lesion‚Äôs gat is attracted to heads. Yeet
---
Every time they're dorms, I do exactly this. Hang out and tap fire for 5-10 seconds. Since I first saw it in. Macie Jay video a while back, I've probably go 15-20 kills with this
---
Petition to change ela‚Äôs appearance in game to match this pls
---
i've heard of it happening, I actually sent off an email to support asking how to prevent this from happening, and if i can sell some of my licenses back to xbox for a refund to mitigate my risk. (doubtful but im chatting with support right now)
---
Yeah is this csgo?
---
Changing cosmetic items can anger lots of people because they might have liked the previous look of those charms. Also they're past season charms which use the old ranking system so no point of making them "up to date"
---
Ha! Got'em!
---
Don't forget they're in casual too
---
I tk a lot with my friends and my solution is just remove bans from and hostage team kill if there's 5 of you.
---
XD
---
I'll check now when I play... lol
---
Jesus Chris this is bad
---
?
---
Damn I didn't know they buffed ela
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
Miss Malteser
---
Oh so like the new raid in the division 2's last boss? How all those annoying drone pop up
---
\[REDACTED\]
---
I love their faces, haha
---
Well...
---
That makes a lot of sense actually, appreciate the insight.
---
Not my best work
---
I‚Äôm so sorry. In my wood shop class my shit always gets stolen, so I kinda know how you feel but nothing this bad has ever happened to me. From the pictures of it it looked really cool.
---
Which wall is back wall to you? Because mine is the one across from doorway.
---
trash
---
All ot needs is an smg 11 stock and its good
---
r/hmmm
---
The facts, too, seeing as the 15-.50 is literally the worst dmr in the game
---
Have? What lvl are you?
---
well that‚Äôs silly isn‚Äôt it
---
Awh man, that Castle.

Dang you got to play with Nokk early
---
This sub doesn't allow memes.
---
Black Ice
---
They aren't now and operators don't need a rework to be buffed or nerfed. But even than as long they fix the game before releasing more and more mediocre content iam happy
---
You aren't guaranteed that either way
---
June 11th m8

that looks fucking sick
---
Cum bucket*
---
Yes I am but You can‚Äôt just say something like that without backing it up
---
Or paint a Lint Roller... It's already got the similar shape.
---
No.
---
Why
---
Ubisoft is just gonna recycle operator ideas like Nokk.
---
He was about 12 month old. But i guess we were pretty lucky... a 2 year old from some friends still wakes up one time during the Night.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlNEm9az9DI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlNEm9az9DI)
---
white knight bitch
---
That doesn't mean its bad
---
Also once they release the new ops they will nerf them.
---
I'm not talking about buffs or nerfs, I'm talking about a full rework m let's say for a new season they announce they will rework Tachanka and Castle and also rework and existing map.
---
So that would be fine in your opinion?
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Hmm a legendary skin thats good?
---
June 11: Conflagration is taken out of the game for unspecified reasons
---
Sledgehammer*
---
Wow you really tried with that photo didn‚Äôt you
---
Yeah when they told us before. Like they did with the map reworks. The problem is a map can always be reworked an operator is way easier to balance and not a problem at all
---
The girl you like vs her ugly friend
---
That happened to nomad in the middle of a game a few days ago.
---
Well if they decide to release an operator that has Castle's ability but on attack, it won't be bad either. Does that make it okay?
---
I've had things like this happen back when I was in school.  I even got blamed for it,  falsely.  People are all douchebags, man.
---
Sometimes it's artistic, sometimes it's to cover something up, and sometimes its for the fun of it. Things are not always looks!
---
ü§™
---
Also you have to get any final project approved by the teacher first.
---
Great work detective.
---
I'll be happy if they add doc on attack
---
But not like finka
---
we could be arguing all day lets actually let ubi balance their operators
---
Ok
---
Is that an invite?
---
imho supernova is the worst
---
I have bought finka
---
MMR and/or ELO adjustments over the years. Ubi are only feeling comfortable taking out of beta now. So next season you'll have the "true" ranked experience.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the ban system
---
Glacier is much more awesome

I swear I'm not normally that good

---
How are incels born?... They can't reproduce themselves, but they exist...
---
The white doesn‚Äôt really match the flame though...
---
Gridlock (more commonly referred to as ‚ÄúThe lunch lady‚Äù) is an amazing operator with amazing guns and a very useful gadgets. She is a three armor so she can tank some bullets. Capit√£o‚Äôs gadget is cool, but not that useful
---
Shhhh...the people don‚Äôt need to know that. Really incredible though
---
I agree with you at the beginning of the round. But, if I‚Äôm pulse 1 minute in and I see 3 people outside, it makes perfect sense for me run out and get them all
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks man
---
Ok!
---
Wakanda sh*t is this
---
Agreed. While there is always still a chance to win, that team will always have the most disadvantage. Not to mention if someone else leaves because of it.
---
The other day I got stuck doing a 2v5 in Ranked. Wasn't great at all.
---
A wise decision.
---
Thanks üòå
---
Looks hella accurate, just lose the ring and then it‚Äôll be complete
---
Oof, that's unlucky :( How often is often and for how long?
---
Np
---
Deprived. But also depraved now you mention it.
---
He said his teammate is lvl 170 so no
---
You mean to tell me he got 2 legendaries in a row and they were the same?
---
What? Uh hi how are they going to keep track of everyone doing it?
---
You're right. Cheers
---
They trolled smoke.
---
Sad.
---
Some game breaking glitch involving her, a claymore, and a deployable shield.  Those have been removed as well.  It was supposed to be for just a week, but Ubi hasn't gotten back to us on the subject.
---
This is for his dmr correct?
---
Please don't, it's not worth it, think about your future kids.
---
So one of his teammates where level 170
---
I think both are quite good capitao is good as he is 3 speed and I think his guns are pretty much laser beams,also you can get cheeky with his gadjet and can get people through drone moles or underneath them just ,where as gridlock is good to lock people off,very useful when you are inside of an obj as it helps to slow down defenders rotating back to obj
---
I mean.....*somebody* had to cover for the absence of castle over there.
---
They get swelled heads over the odds and just act careless. They think it means they'll automatically win, but that's not always the case.
---
I never was a very big streamer but had one follower that would do that to me and it was hilarious
---
Whats this got to do with incels?
---
Get nae naed
---
I think you need more barbed wire.
---
‚ÄúTrue?‚Äù
---
Wholesome &lt;3
---
First game of ranked yesterday the other team only had 1 guy left after the first round.
---
Imagine walking in the street and u find so many drones. u ve been spotted 100000000 times fuck
---
That‚Äôs gay
---
I use the m4
---
Now that's spooky
---
Siege toxicity leaking into real life. Damn man.. sorry this happened to you
---
 In case anybody want this tees.
---
To get any use out of the gadget you have to know how to push with it and when to use it which can be hard for some
---
Seems legit
---
Looked at my steam DLC section for this game...3 years of season pass...I wondered is it worth all the supports? We can't even get a basic function for a smooth and fair competitive game...I'm so tired of this.
---
One of the easier ones to do.
---
The experience Ubi wants you to have
---
And it only costs 24 diamonds
---
If they just removed her barbed wire it would have been fine, but ubi seemed to think removing the entire operator was better.
---
Weeb
---
*distant fapping*
---
All ten players recruits. All attackers running shields. Yeah, this video wasn't staged.
---
if that‚Äôs the case then restart your game. that‚Äôs also common sense.
---
28 Std die Woche? Da muss man ja schon Hartzer f√ºr sein :~~)

You really sat there for 56 minutes?

This is so gamechanging thanks buddy

I have a friend who I introduced to siege, ( female ) and she gets team killed or told nasty things to Everytime ahw talks in game

They‚Äôre also bloody weirdos

Causing straight mayhem out in these streets!

I needs that mf banana charm fam
---
Well pre nerf lion doesn't exist anymore, and they learned their lesson from him, mav and nomad, and released 2 sets of balanced ops, so you can be rest assured that the horrors of extreme advantages won't happen again.

You gotta sell the realism. Should have taken the picture under a desk. Great job anyways!

I hate having to use shit guns on good ops and good guns on easy ops is basically what it boiled down to after conversing with everyone and my operator choice, i play whats needed thats more difficult to use than everyone else :/
---
yes
---
I want
---
f
---
They are clearly able to change an operator‚Äôs gadget on the fly. See the test server taking away N√∏kk‚Äôs claymore and Warden‚Äôs deployable until a fix is found.
---
Also, if the invisibility glitch is only a problem with IQ, why not remove her claymore and swap it with frags?
---
We just gonna ignore those massive angles from this hardcore parkour? Hella damn
---
I don‚Äôt have deployable shields...
---
Be more subtle.

a bug , the floor in that room should be unbreachable but it isnt .

We all still appreciate the hard work you put into it. The lord would be proud
---
If you had a real deagle you could actually do that

Totally agree but ubi doesn't seem to understand

Yet another piece of evidence that shows Siege is just a horror game with guns.

slowing them down is good for teammate to shot them or lure them to a trap, the damage need alittle buff, right now the damage is max 20 before need to rechage.

Yes

Oooof

Are we blind? Deploy the downvotes

You‚Äôre obviously uneducated on console siege. Maybe 60% of anything higher than plat 2 is mnk.

Shut up man I‚Äôm high as balls

it's not like i'm trying to hit on her you complete reddit cuck so you're saying that as soon as guys compliment a girl it means that they're trying to hit on her ?
---
A man of culture I see
---
I cant lie if youre going 2-7 and 3-4 against golds and silvers as a plat2 player, and were stuck in low gold for 3 months, you sound like a shit player that somehow got luckily carried in soloqueue.
---
I had to do a double take on which Rainbow 6 subreddit this was.
---
Why? Just out of curiousity.
---
Mhm yeah but there's also Mute , also Thatcher punched Lion and that's in his biography , I'm trying to include the story if my fan arts when I can
---
My best skin is for frost, black ice smg.
---
We seem to have similar specs, though yours are a bit better. (I have an fx 4350 and a gtx 960). Does the problem exist outside of seige for you? Mine does, and I'm thinking it could be an old hardware problem (might be my keyboard).
---
Your so wrong dude i have met 5 mnk players in the last 2 years maybe at most and diamond isn‚Äôt that hard to hit
---
Nobody‚Äôs gonna read em there to damn long
---
I don‚Äôt think so bc of retro compatibility. I mean if u have the digital copy on your library u just need to download it and I think u will be ready to go. Same with disc I guess.
---
Maybe they could use a security cam from across the street and zoom way in, then use the HD filter to make the pixels magically clear. That would be a super easy way to identify the baddies!
---
Karma whore reposterino
---
It's rarely actually handy, the slowing down at most is just making the kill extra secure.
---
Yeah that's a tournament where everyone is using a controller so it's a fair game. But you use a XIM online where people are using a controller vs your M&amp;K. btw That's cool that you are trying to get used to M&amp;K but PC has a  different feel to it. Don't get used to the XIM.
---
Cool!!
---
Should be an achievement
---
Nice editing skills. Also the gameplay was great.
---
that second one tap was what i uploaded this clip for i was like, ‚Äúomg i just one tapped a shield op‚Äù
---
Hey gun is better without the acog anyway
---
Oh nice, though I think most people don't pay attention to the bios. That's probably why he suggested vigil as a more traditional 'counter' to lion.
---
What a throwback! Miss this show. Just downloaded it to watch it again.
---
 lol the music in the background though
---
I like putting my drone on the window and looking at the scenery.
---
Bandit: *Heavy breathing*
---
I don‚Äôt want to have to buy siege again, also I have all the ops, so that would just be horrible having to unlock them all again
---
Thank you! I'm new to editing, so hopefully there will be more to come, thank you again!
---
Plat lobbies are fine for me though
---
that does make sense but i do go to friends houses and travel a lot, so i‚Äôve tried to take that into consideration too... but i guess it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard to move a desktop

You go to the home page of the sub Reddit hit the setting button in the top right corner and pick change flair

How to fuck do you identify an anime characters age just by their face, every singe face in anime looks almost identical accepts for color of hair and eyes lol
---
Iq opinion is blatantly wrong. For example, if the enemy team is in drug lab, you go to the room above them, you can see basically all of the traps and electronics in the room and help out your team by shooting them out, her gadget is easy and helpful. Also smokes smg is good. Call and Mira are helpful support ops. You can‚Äôt or nomad low because you hate her this is a tiered list not a like rating. A couple of seconds from BB might be all you need
---
Thats because in plat lobbies you respect the people and dont do a bunch of risky shit and probably try really hard. In gold you figure ‚Äúthese guys are way worse than me im just gonna pick jager and go terminator mode‚Äù then u realize alot of gold players are actually easily plat bound players stuck with the trash elo system and thats why u go 2-7

All of the smokes teammates ran into the smoke so he got killed with the reverse friendly fire.

My voice is deep. Time to get a girly ingame and disappoint both in my shots and in the comms.
---
Sure, but it's slower and you still get some sort of warning, unlike not having it barricaded. I'm also speaking in general terms. Everyone but Maverick will give you a clear warning if the door is reinforced. And if you are in a firefight or are rotating back, may not have heard the breach in the tunnel. There is just no good reason to not barricade the tunnel unless you plan lurk inside it.
---
Dokk is ok. Helpful in certain situations but has a dmr.

I would imagine people don't enjoy sitting around for half an hour while the last guy stares at one angle then pushes in the last ten seconds to die. Thats simply not fun.

Jackal and Lesion fit your playstyle. Other ops that fit your playstyle are Maestro and Maverick

I still think that even with the load out being strong the op will still be a bit lackluster because I do think the gadget is a good one just very situational but you never know cause the Pros could come up with some crazy strat with it but even then is that all this op has to offer?
---
Test
---
Of course a hibana main would say that
---
&gt;Save
---
Realize that they're arguments you've started? When you were the one complaining that they just start them.
---
Why did they waste their diamonds on hoes
---
DAMN. THAT'S AMAZING!
---
Nah, I work outta da home.
---
Personally Gridlock, she might be slower but I find much more use with her, especially when you use them on the objective doors once inside.
---
Yeah and people do like being more that support which is really good but obviously you won‚Äôt need to be that support every single round and when pick and ban comes next season that maverick is going to be a key breach operator
---
Her lmg is also banging.
---
i appreciate that! thank you!
---
Oh how bandit mains hate maverick
---
On defense, considering your playstyle, I'd recommend Maestro or Echo. Both are great operators that are very annoying to deal wtih as an attacker, and they both have good guns. 
---
For attack, I'd say you might Capitao, Buck, or Nomad. Capitao is good for blocking off lines of sight with smoke/flushing out campers with the fire arrows. Buck is loud, but he is great for scaring off anchors with vertical play, and also taking out roamers while doing it. Nomad is extremely good at watching flanks and getting info from your airjabs when they go off.
---
I agree. If the teacher is understanding, they would totally get the situation and at least give him the grade he deserves.
---
Geez, that‚Äôs so practical! Thx
---
Bruh imagine siege but like LEGO Star Wars the complete saga
---
They only started because you followed up
---
I won‚Äôt lie that I‚Äôm desperately waiting for Halo MCC on steam as my main shooter, but man, you gotta just let ELO go and just play. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs the only way (for me at least) to enjoy the game. 
---
I‚Äôm stuck in Copper I cause of players like you mentioned, but honestly doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore.
---
So you would remove RFF because you're too bad to not shoot teammates
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
I used to despise it in the beginning but now I'm neutral towards the new one. 3rd floor is still the most defender favored bomb site in the game imo.
---
IQ looking *thicc* even in LEGO form
---
I see then if your looking to play a bit more conservative then maybe maverick or Gridlock. I would say Ying but she also is a bit of a bum rusher with her gadget. You also don‚Äôt necessarily need to rush in with Zofia as it just depends how you play the op and that is the same for all ops.
---
Hello _roadography,
---
For attack I think you should buy Dokkaebi, it's a very good operator if you know how to use it
---
For defense you can wait some days and buy Warden, is so useful if you don't like to roam
---
No one except you complains about the dlc mechanics in Siege.  Spending real money doesn‚Äôt grant u an advantage.  It‚Äôs just to safe yourself time u‚Äôd have to spend playing thunt in case u feel like u need to some ops.
---
Every night I can feel my leg... and my arm...
---
Definitely saying this when I play with my next gamer girl just for that laughs üòÇ
---
I think nomad is more useful but both are very fun so you really can't go wrong. Nomad' s air jab is great for covering flanks and run-outs.  I feel that gridlock is a great OBJ op with her spikes and smoke nades.
---
Either one you pick you'll be happy.
---
Whats that pose
---
What is origin of this gay pose?
---
Play BO4.  You‚Äôll slay and come back around to it in R6S
---
Except that leaves the rest of their team at a disadvantage, which is not fun, which is why I think there should be some punishment for people who do that. Nobody would care about this if the game consistently found new players quickly but it often takes multiple rounds for this to happen.
---
Also I'm really not copper.
---
All. Of. Them.
---
i‚Äôll try but call of duty players make no sense tbh
---
Yes I also want see what will happen with soloQ this season because bombs the only option.
---
I dont mind backfill but being kicked for no reason is the reason I only really play ranked lately.
---
So maestro?
---
This is really good!  Are those peltor Comtacs?  Are they real, or a reproduction?
---
Yes dad
---
I need the background irl
---
Jesus. Gruesome. But I like it.

BTW Yours is a series 2, mine is a series 1.
---
I think mav vill  see more play as hibana back up. I odnt think ppl will pick mav as main breach unless we see therm and hibana banned in the same game.
---
Yeah I basically main jackal and lesion, thanks for the suggestions.
---
One squad member is to high of a level one is to low
---
I think votekick should be reworked slightly, and if you backfill, you should get some bonus renown
---
looks like a bot. checks it‚Äôs post history
---
Source?
---
Cav can be pretty useless, get lesion if you want him. Most of the non-dlc def ops are really good as well if played correctly.
---
This is the only true flair^^
---
2 interesting things to note:
---
-it counts you as injured

-it also counts you as prone

Nah I know, I‚Äôm not really in a bind bc I play Jaeger, Smoke, Bandit, Frost and Kapkan really well. It‚Äôs more a thing of ‚ÄúI have too many attacking ops in comparison to the number of defensive ops I have‚Äù.

I once downed someone with kapcans shotgun through a fuze hole
---
Hm, I was thinking about her but it feels like the opportunities to use her effectively as opposed to other operators is kinda low

Potentially already done but, make sure you have vsync off and turn on low latency on the input setting within r6? Other than that I'm not sure. Monitor your pc next time you play, maybe it's running to hard? Good luck man

The old hereford base was not balanced. But it was way more fun to play on
---
That is should be tagged as "usefull", I guess . lmao
---
I have this and love it sooooo much, its so clean and has a texture that is similar to Hemorrhage form OB but is tuned more to a burnt flesh look. Only thing I would change is the barrel, but it's mostly the gun's problem, the muzzle attachments shorten the actual barrel, and cover the skins put on it. I think the muzzle should be longer w/ attachments but that's beside the point. 10/10 Legendary skin and should be the standard for other legendary skins in the future.

Honestly and his is just my opinion, I don‚Äôt care about fun maps when I play ranked, sure house is fun to run around and play like it‚Äôs COD on, but the map is cripplingly unbalanced and in that regard it‚Äôs not fun to play on in ranked. So I agree old Hereford was fun but I still hated it every time I played it because I felt like I was destined to lose every defensive round
---
that's a good question
---
i guess peoples never change i'm still the same guy and tbh i dont even know why i posted this 
---
and yeah here we are again.
---
but u know u can always try to be a better person . i just feel like as this guy said every single time that i tried to be nice to ppl they something bad happend and at the end i got banned but the 4stacks that tked me every round 3 4 matches in a row what u can do about . the only thing u can do is just sit and curse at least it's better then silence u know.

It counts as teamkilling and (I might be wrong here, not sure) but I think it‚Äôs a more strict ban because it makes you lose the round automatically

I don‚Äôt know anything about Lesion‚Äôs weapons, but I certainly like Cav‚Äôs. I really like the idea of Lesions gadget and I know from experience how effective (and annoying for the attackers) it can be. I‚Äôm good at both anchoring and roaming, although I do more anchoring than roaming. Are Lesions weapons good? I‚Äôm starting to lean toward Lesion based on what you guys are saying

He‚Äôs very situational in my opinion newer players might not have the aim to shoot the head and will shoot the body anyway, in those circumstances he‚Äôs terrible but if your in a sweaty ranked game and they‚Äôre gonna spawnpeak you then he‚Äôs great

You seem obsessively focused over him *specifically* for some reason. The fact of the matter is that Ubisoft *should* be changing the game for the opinion of pro-league; unless they want the competitive scene to die. Every other E-sport does this, why should siege be the outlier?
---
It doesn't matter who is the one making the game, if they want it to be good, they should be changing to based on what the players think. In this case, Pengu represents the very highest echelon of the player base- meaning his opinion rightfully weighs more than any average player.
---

And as I stated before, they're fundamentally different games. It's your logic that's flawed. You're the one asking why no one is outraged. You moved the goalposts and then ask why no one else lives within them.

America üòâ
---
This is my biggest fear, and a big fear for my gaming friends.
---
I always worry about my friend's where if something happened to me, they wouldn't kbow, and I wouldn't have gotten the chance to give final goodbyes. 
---
As for my friends, I couldn't ask for a better set of people to have known. While friends I've known in life have just abandoned me, I can always count on the ones behind the screen to be there, even if it's just to talk to or a match of some game to get my mind off feeling shitty, sad, or pissed over something.
---
One friend is particular has got me shaken. He's been in and out of Suicide Watch programs, always getting into fights and just being in harm's way. As violent as he sounds, I've never met a more caring and generous individual. If it's not annoying and time consuming help on a game, he's staying up late hours and going days without sleep just to talk and comfort a friend. He'll make jokes just to get you to smile if you're upset. He checks on you in the mornings to make sure you're feeling better if you had a rough night or if he noticed you were online on a school day, perhaps to see if you were sick. He would always work you through problems and give the greatest ideas for advice, and I really couldn't ask for a better friend.
---
As of now, he doesn't come online often. He's slowly subcoming to rock bottom and it's beyond painful to just watch the process. We lived close, but I missed my chance to meet him as he moved across the country months ago to escape terrible friends and abusive people, including his parents. He seems stable from when I do hear from him, but he's struggling more with anger issues and depression. Suggested therapy doesn't help him and while I try and talk to him, he seems more closed off now.
---
When he does come online, he's still him, and he still cares about people and offers help and makes jokes to make people laugh, smile, and enjoy the game more. It just hurts to know what goes on behind the scenes and not be able to do anything about it. I really hope one day he finds peace and fully enjoys the things he does and finally understand how much he does for others and how much people want to help him feel better as he does for them. Any message, whether a day or months apart is a relief when I get one from him.
---
I didn't mean for this to be a sob story and sorry if it is, I'm just glad to see other people built amazing friendships with others through games and online, as well as share the fears and losses you have to face in the end. The never knowing is what really gets me, and the acceptance is something I don't think I could ever come by. While I'm usually straightfaced at funerals for people I know in real life, it's oddly the ones I meet through games that make me even the slightest bit of emotional.

It's more or less to show off that you have nothing better to buy that's all no need to apologise. But I'd recommend you get some operator bundles for your favourite / most used operators.
---
NANI?!
---
Just wondering why you‚Äôre so salty against Cav for no reason. She‚Äôs a high risk, high reward operator, an interrogation can end a round pretty quick.
---
Wow. One of the few old operators who doesn't have a legendary skin

I swear youre a fuckin geenius
---
finally someone who's not an asshole
---
Thank you, kind stranger!
---
I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but I do know for a fact it doesn't mean MnK. MnK isn't detectable by Ubi, therefore they couldn't possibly have an indicator for it like that. If they could do that they would just ban them for MnK.
---
Too OP I guess, ash was already really strong before they removed ACOG on the R4C which had a 99% pick rate
---
No but I do need some friends that play siege my gamertag is MrM0ustach if you want
---
Smurfing is extremely prevalent in this and all other competitive games because people get ego boosts by bullying lower ranks. Ubisoft and other developers SHOULD not allow this because it manipulates the matchmaking system but they wont because as far as they concerned they just sold another copy. Corporate greed will always be prioritised over having a truly legitimate and fair matchmaking experience.

Any coordinated team will shit on her every round. She's literally a throw pick past mid-gold elo, or even lower if they have a 5 man.

Cav is only good if you can pick off retarded players with bad comms, if the enemy are communicating and have somewhat decent aim, you're completely fucked.

That commando looks tasty af
---
If they stopped making cosmetic sets (bundled cosmetics via direct cash payment) because they were not selling as well as cosmetic bundles (bundled cosmetics via renown or r6 credits), why not just transition them over to the bundle format rather than removing them fully from the game? 
---
I could see where the players that bought them as sets would feel that transitioning them to bundles would be unfair since they had to pay out of pocket with no alternative transaction, but if they were given the equivalent or some percentage amount of r6 credits that they invested in the sets, I think that would be a fair compromise since distributing r6 credits costs virtually zero dollars for Ubi.

There are A LOT of dickheads in this community, good people are few and far between. This here is just fuel for their ever burning fire.

I understand that you wouldn't of thought about this when you gave it this title but LGBT subject (I'm not adding the other 7+ odd letters because ffs that acronym just keeps getting longer every day) it's still not how do I phrase this, fully integrated into society and it's not something that can be forced like it has been the last couple of years. You can't just Thanos snap and boom everyone is happy with it, like people of colour that shit took decades for it to be integrated and there still is racism everyday.

I don‚Äôt know if you are an experienced player or not but if you aren‚Äôt you will get what I am trying to say later on

(Don‚Äôt get triggered if you are a level 700 doc revolver main)

Hello dkrocksmith, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bvr3pm/oofed/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

###Caps lock title
---
The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.
---
Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
use regular weapon sights not acog to start out with, then once comfortable with your weapons move into acog. 
---
Learn every operators ability.
---
The best advice anyone here can give is just watch videos and play to get experience. 
---
I advise once level 30 just play ranked. Casual is pointless unless you don‚Äôt want to get good at the game. Because there‚Äôs too many maps (most boring and shit) where as ranked is a smaller map pool with more interesting and balanced maps (mainly) but map knowledge is HUGE. 
---
Drones are important use them to scan a room before you enter. But don‚Äôt overuse you will learn eventually how much droning and how much listening you need to do before moving around rooms.
---
As an attacker if you see a frost on the enemy team, ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS (unless you drone or know there is 100% no trap at that door or shield barricade) look down and shoot the ground when vaulting in a window or over a shield barricade.
---
If a echo stuns you, don‚Äôt panic stand in the same spot for a second then quickly move back a bit and prone aiming at the most likely place you think he will come from and he will most likely be pre-aiming your last known position and then take him out. (Same goes for ela traps but you‚Äôd need more experience to do this as she‚Äôs a roamer and could be behind you)
---
Pick characters like rook/kapkan/doc/smoke/jager ones that have simple gadgets that won‚Äôt affect the objective room until you learn everyone‚Äôs abilities as operators like castle can not only hinder your gameplay but your team mates
---
Don‚Äôt just crouch around everywhere, run around sprint do 360 jump no scopes. You will know when to crouch and when not to by playing the game. You won‚Äôt ever learn if you are always crouching around the map. 
---
Have your crosshairs always aiming for head level if you are roaming and if you are anchoring watching a door way it‚Äôs situational well it goes for roaming too but in anchoring most people will try to crouch peak you if they know where you are in the room but they will be standing up straight lean peaking if they have no clue where you are
---
The game can be frustrating so just be patient it‚Äôs not very forgiving but is very rewarding when you get good! 
---
Have fun!
---
Download AimLab on steam and mess around in that. There‚Äôs also a website called something like same aim different game for transferring sensitivities. 
---
For my settings I use 16 horizontal and vertical and 35 ADS with 800 dpi and 80 FOV

*weird stuff*

Definitely talk to your teacher about it. You have pics showing you were working on it, and it sounds like he knew all about your project anyways from your other responses here. No teacher anywhere is going to look at this situation and say "Well you got fucked over but deadlines are deadlines so that's a complete failure". Not unless they're literally the worst teacher alive, and if they did I would just go directly to the principle/admin office and explain that your teacher is failing you for something completely out of your control. 
---
Most teachers aren't mean, they're just sick of dealing with lying asshole teens all day long. Competent teachers tend to suss out pretty quickly which students are the trouble makers and which ones are engaged and trying their hardest. If you've been working diligently and not causing problems in your class all year, no doubt you teacher is going to recognize what happened and give you an extension or work with you some how to get a different project or way to finish you grade. 
---
Teacher don't want to fail students, they will work with you to help you pass the class. The only reason teachers start being shitty to students is when they think the student is trying to screw them over or lie to them or scam them in some way, which unfortunately is a common occurrence among high school students.

I loved limited ammo in The Last of Us' multiplayer. Obviously very different game but I wish more games would try it.

I main Nomad now because of this.

Great drawing!

I'm perfectly ok with people making comments disagreeing with this. They are entitled to their opinion and are entitled to the ability to say it. I don't really care if they hate it or love it, I just wanted to share some art I made with a community I enjoy (to a certain extent). 
---
I'm not trying to force anything on anyone. It's a simple pride picture to celebrate pride mkmth with a personal opinion on one of the characters being gay. I'm not syaing she 100% is, I'm not saying anyone who disagrees is wrong, fuck man I'm not even saying people have to like it. I'm allowed to share stuff I made for rainbow in the rainbow community. No one has to like it and they can downvote it or ignore it if they don't. 
---
I don't think I'm going to add a background this time around, too much extra work for me and I like the simple white bg in contrast with the shading and colored bits. 
---
You don't sound like a douche lol you're just trying to be helpful and I appreciate it. I don't mind getting hateful comments though, because there's always the possibility someone else might really enjoy seeing this.
---
Well I mean fortress and Hereford are really fucking bad along with consolate
---
i want to know also

Looks like baldis basics

Oppa!

You think yours is the only true one?

Claymores are currently disabled due to a glitch with them
---
I would actually not even have the mp5k, I would pick something like the UMP45.
---
At the absolute worst it should be an automatic C grade to ensure a pass. Like, it *should* be a wash, the teacher should just remove the project from their grade entirely, or come up with some other project they can do instead, but at the very least you can't fail a student over something like this.
---
 If they did then my next step would be contacting the principle or even superintendent, because that would be a major PR nightmare for the school if it got out.
---
I agree with you last couple of operations had very bad maps too
---
There are surely more maps that needed a rework other than kafe 
---
Consulate for example
---
Reply to this comment when someone answers I'm also currious
---
1. Claymores are disabled due to exploits with them, so you don't get any
---
2. Majority of the players in siege use full auto, and not semi. So there's no need for goobisoft to add a pre selection. Just manually do it every round
---
I thought i'd snoop at your comment history, maybe it was 3 days ago when you said Anime Ash looked like a pedo, which I'd have to agree.
---
r/whooosh plz no downvote
---
so practical
---
much tactics

wow

I think it was a seasonal skin and you cantvget it anymore

Spot on. Must have taken weeks of work!

Yeah, it‚Äôs a shame everyone seems to be getting hung up on the LGBTQ+ side of this.
