Looks like Kapkan stole Fuze's AK

---
yeah its my first. liked the style of pixel art so I tried to go with one of my favorite operators and this was the product
---
Ur aim sucks
---
What are u gonna do about it

The people doing the animations are not the people in charge of the sound system or networking. One team could be twiddling their thumbs while the other is doing what the community wants for all we know.
---
Heck
---
Judge you
---
Cue saying the other team is shit and various insults
---
Thing about Rook, more so than any other defender, you rely on your teammates doing something for your gadgets to be useful (picking up plates). Blessing and a curse I suppose. 
---
CHEEKY
---
 I can kind of find my way around fortress walking around, but I’m still completely lost on my drone. Outback, however, I find very straightforward and easy to understand.
---
Wtf do yo u think this is Epic Games? No it's Ubisoft they are litterally doing things because they want they add new ops with access to ultra instict and then they nerf weak ass ops into Oblivion like look at blackbeard
---
r/MadLads 
---
Imo this would just be a worse version of Zofia
---
Console gameplay
---
That finka isn't using the right gun 
---
I think they potatoed more than you
---
You missed tho
---
Some of you may die...but its a sacrifice..im willing to make
---
Not known enough to be fixed apparently :p
---
HD texture pack?? 
---
no, i have her elite skin
---
I don’t know if you are talking about the ones in the big room but you used to be able to go in them
---
Me too lol!
---
And you're sure it wasn't custom?
---
More like excellent 
---
py hday
---
Blackbeard literally would be op if they just got rid of the movement penalty
---
cmon no need to flex on us
---
Wut
---
Also looks like a bug that would need to be fixed on more fundamental level than most other bugs and considering the rarity, probably isn't high on their list. 
---
This is it chief
---
Blackbeard has never been weak, he's still not weak

---
I have a group of 10 guys that I normally play with. The problem is I'm at least in the top 3 (I'd like to think so), so when I have a bad game, unless someone else drops around 12+ kills, we tend to lose. This puts so much pressure on me that I focus so much on trying to perform, and less on actually enjoying the game
---
drip too hard
---
👌 if you have questions I’ll be happy to answer
---
Haha y’all remember when the SMG-11 had an acog? Thems were the days. 
---
I see your point and I'm glad I'm am not the only person who has think about this before. Btw, what's the name of that subreddit? 
---
The game is a 2019 release and in 2016 we got a gun skin from div1

Is Jäger a mist pick? He stops utility
---
He is used maybe too much but that because of his utility and guns 
---
Wonderful isnt it? It almost makes it feel like the leaning wasnt an issue to begin with. I'd much rather take a slightly modified hitbox due to movements than playing a bullet curve simulator. 
---
Exactly, so what's the issue with attacking jäger?
---

---
Shush cheater, you got banned because you have been HWID banned on previous accounts so when you play the game battleye picks up your HWID and bans you again. If you were an actual non-deficient human being you would know to use a spoofer when you cheat and I am also suprised how brain dead this reddit community is for being so gullible. 
---
That should be fixed in all honesty, that bug has been in the game from the very start and it is so dead
---
#IT'S OVER 9000
---
No lol 
---
Personally I don’t want an inspect weapons key. I don’t like or use it in other games. And to be quite frank, I feel like inspection keys are a psychological ploy to have people spend more money on cosmetics. 
---
Rip :(
---
Why does Lion have an iPad for a face?
---
well your first step should be to go to ubi support, not here.
---
Wtf why did he call you a noob then 😂
---
If they added  it it should be a passive traits and if so they should fix hit boxes first lol
---
That's odd. Did you open the folder with the numbers in the name?
---
Pacha Marchi!!!!!
---
You should have fucking tked or votekicked him wtf
---
Also twitch drones, nades, c4, -- anything that does low or proximity damage
---
Its personal preference. 
---
What's wrong with the sound?
---
So? If they know they would have something important come up (which a lot of times they do), then why start Ranked if you know that you can't leave? It's not a valid excuse. 
---
If it makes me toxic, then so be it. But I'm done putting up with the VTK shit that's only used for toxicity. If you're dead with 0 kills than you should kick yourself before anyone else for not winning a round.
---
As for the 3rd random who didn't vote kick, shit luck. I knew killing 2 would guarantee me at least 1 of the people who kicked me and then a 50/50 on the other. If I got the wrong guy, shame shame. I guess he can thank Ubi for not showing names of who's vote kicking like they should.
---
Yes I realized I made a typo
---
stop to download porn

Yes

I just heard the bass boost in the back of my mind

if you don’t restart the queue after 3 minutes then you’re just wasting your own time. not Ubisofts fault you have minimal common sense

Theres always some kind of weird thing happening on my stream, so heres one of them I guess :) 
---
Gah had more ammo and less recoil, good for fuze shield imo
---
Found the gold 4 
---
lollll you’re going to respond to toxicity with even more toxicity? and get yourself banned in the process? good move genius 
---
GSH*
---
The second person could have voted no. 
---
2142 did it better, with the exception of the Voss being OP but that could balanced out.
---
any recommendations though?
---
What A Gamer
---
Looking back on it I should’ve but I was just so angry that I thought just getting off right then and there would calm me down and would be the best thing then add unnecessary fuel to the fire
---
For the Commando the thingy that reduces recoil on single shot fire works like pure gold, and if you add a vertical grip and a reflex the recoil is almost inexistent (tho the ADS is a bit slow, if you want faster ADS get an angled)
---
This happened to me and and random filled my spot so i couldn’t reconnect
---
Don't worry man, I do the same thing.
---
Its not Chinese its Digorno
---
That looks interesting, what game is that?
---
console
---
tis a dark place
---
tk'ing is way more toxic than two dudes voting you. in the end you are the problem, not them.
---
#what a gamer
---
Found the guy who never got spawn peeked o bartlett.
---
wind bastion is over though
---
You are one of the problems with rainbow. Yes the VTK is stupid because people do use it for toxic purposes, but TKing two players doesn’t help and honestly I think you deserve a longer ban for that. TKing is not the answer. Put up with their shit and if they TK you for not clutching then report them and leave. If they don’t TK you they probably dont care about you. 
---
Yea I was thankful that the Hibana flashed herself lol.
---
You forgot blitz
---
Jackal definitely 
---
Escape From Tarkov
---
escape from tarkov
---
Yeah I agree, people with bad internet shouldn't have fun
---
this breaks rule #7 of this sub
---
Nah unfortunately you can't transfer your account. Sorry mate
---
Unfortunately, you cannot &gt;.&gt;
---
Blitz you can work around with operators like Mute and others
---
Without an ACOG and especially now that DBNO revives only to 20 health, there would be no reason to pick Rook over Doc. (Of course if one loses the ACOG the other will as well, but still.)
---
what a gamer
---
Blitz sometimes (when his shield actually works for him)
---
Echo
---
I sense you go 0-5 and vote people out lol
---
Yep.
---
I haven't been able to play the game ever since the new season update. I play from the middle East, get 70-100 ping so I don't know if it's a restriction or something but anytime I try to join a game be it casual or ranked I get a "Connection Failure" after I connect to a game and get to the operator selection screen.
---
very much appreciated. have an upvote
---
Hackerman he's the most powerful hacker of all time.

Small jackal main request, custom voice line: shaking sniff* I sMeLl ToEsIEs(gremlin voice) shaking exhale*
---
VTK has been a toxicity issue since it was introduced, if Ubi refuses to do something about I will myself. I'm not going to sit back and be a bitch that let's people fuck w me.
---
I don't encounter jackal enough to consider him at the top of the lists. For me it's blitz and Maverick. That silent blowtorch is hell when you're anchoring in a corner 
---
jackal has a foot fetish confirmed
---
Specially the new dlc, the gas station peek
---
:D
---
Is this restriction a thing? Literally can't play since the new season update.
---

A buddy of mine got up to 16k ping a few days ago. He had to shut off his router for an hour and it still hardly works properly.
---
You can downvote all day, isn't hurting my account. I'd rather see you try and have a logical discussion to prove me wrong or change my mind.
---
Disgusting
---
I’ve played outback maybe 10-15 times and understand it better than tower. I hate tower
---
That bait dear lord 
---
I’ve been getting the exact same thing only in siege since the new season started I’m not sure how to fix it either 
---
Director of photography : Michael J Fox
---
I do the exact same thing most of the time... Just play around with attackers and improve your aim eventually it won't matter who you play you'll be hitting headshots with everyone... A good starting point would be sledge or thatcher with their AR... I personally run it with holo but thats just preference 
---
r/engrish
---
Nah, a lot of the sites are just not fun
---
Maybe gibe Zofia a try, her AK is pretty good + she has a green laser on her pistol and her Granade launcher is pretty good if u learn how to use it
---
I was expecting Skyrim, glad to be wrong lol 
---
Definitely one of the best pro leagues to ever come out 
---
thank god im not the only one on this, i have no idea how to fix it and i feel like ive tried everything
---
update: not the monitor
---
YES BROTHER GOOOD... good
---
r/wooosh I was making a joke about the above comment’s English 
---
wait how did they do that?
---
This is what happens when someone “stresses” the servers, basically they can pause the game at will
---
All of them?
---
It’s som kind of graphics glitch but it’s definitely not my graphics card or monitor, glad to see someone else is having this issue also 
---
*The Deatstroke*
---
zayyan?
---
just wait 5 mins u impatient
---
I like this one a lot, I'll take simple skins like this instead of over the top flashy ones.
---
Then why are the kill cams fucked? Ah wait, they've been fucked for *years* why even bother
---
I like Thatcher for his AR33💪💪 btw fuck da L85A2. I probably’ll go Hibana but now I’m leaning more towards thermite cause I just got black ice for 5-7 and I also have black ice for his AR. I play Twitch a lot and got good but I’ve grown sloppy/inconsistent with her. 
---
My first legendary was a head for Valk just after I bought her elite skin 
---
Ah that makes sense 
---
Like a god damn fiddle 
---
Sry bro. But I’m a level 125 and no black ice tho
---
Same. I knew the drone hole was there in the basement, but never took the time to find where it came from.
---
Oh i thought you mis-typed boosters and got confused, i see what you mean now
---
*soviet national anthem starts playing*
---
Yea but why was the comment calling out the repost downvoted when I saw it (by 3 points) 
---
The only site I think isn't good is the top floor which is defender sided. The rest is pretty good
---
that is so fucking cheeky holy shit lmao. 
---
Amazing, unfortunately I'm not good enough to execute this lmao
---
I guess if you don't like the gun there's not much to do about that but if you've grown sloppy with a  character just run t hunts... Put your preferences to house and just repeat them until you're confident... Btw are you on ps4 by any chance?
---
Main sub page in the options
---
Yeah but that’s honestly just the green universal skin.
---
Just search for ranked. It puts you back in the same game.
---
Idk 
---
I think it has something to do with how visually homogeneous the map is. It's hard to learn a map when everything about it looks and feels the same. Not only does Outback feel more compact than Fortress, but it's specifically designed to have distinct areas so you can quickly gauge whereabouts you are. I don't know about other people, but Fortress doesn't have enough personality for me to remember or reliably call out locations. Legacy aside, it's very telling when Counter-Strike's Dust2, a map with practically the same color scheme as Siege's Fortress--or hell, even Border--is more a memorable map.
---
5 second timer for defenders running out
---
Actually, the Battleye kicks let you rejoin now. They used to drop a fat abandon sanction immediately but they fixed it at some point 2018.

3 weeks ago the issue was not fixed. Unless they fixed it this season 
---
Exactly
---
Bro I got toil bleu or whatever it’s called for rook thats the worst
---
Also having that issue or every graphics setting. It's not my video card or monitor cause both of them are new. (Radeon frontier edition, and Asus vg240q I think) 
---
Laughs in Commando Pro
---
I gotcha
---
Omg I’ve seen that it look no different sorry bro.
---
I got a Battleye kick a few weeks ago and could rejoin. Did you search for ranked immediately after being kicked?
---
Helllllllll nawwwwww 
---
Yea I kno right 
---
The mighty chanka is ur name. But ur a bandit main
---
Do you have gridlock and Mozzie?
---
Haaaaaaaacks
---
I got kicked a total of 6 times. I tried searching for ranked immediately with no success, I looked for a casual and then a ranked, I restarted my game and clicked reconnected which didn’t work, I also restarted uplay and my game, and I additionally restarted my pc. Nothing worked for me. 
---
I see..  thank you for the reply. But frames above the refresh rate doesn't cause input lag when fresync?
---
Would you prefer a few really solid maps, or a larger number of mediocre maps?
---
Personally I’d prefer few but good. For example I really enjoyed the invitational playlist map pool, but I know some people like much larger map pools.
---
I have like 5 black ice I’m level 106 been playing From the time alpha packs came out and all the stuff I get is crap I got another legendary from outbreak packs but it was for finka and I don’t even have her 
---
incredible
---
Yeah.... No. Mine Runs on high fine... At over 144fps all the time (capped)
---
just shoot them in the head with frost! (I use it still anyways) 
---
This can’t be real?🤣
---
I've playing this game for almost 2 years and didnt know that drone hole existed.
---
I know about this hole, but never got anyone through it. It's kinda like that drone hole in bathroom in Coastline.

This drives me crazy. My squad keeping going up to gold 1 and 2 and dropping to gold 4 because after a successful cycle of wins we start playing smurfs and then there’s a cycle of losing lol it has happened 4 times now. I just want to break the cycle! Lol
---
I personally think that leaving matches should removed from ranked rather then banning people who leave.
---
So people already knew about this!? Man I felt so clever when I notice this. I legitimately didn't know.
---
Unpopular opinion: your team has a big part to do with your rank....you can be a silver 1 and know callouts and have better situation awareness that someone at plat 3....the only time I rank high is when i play with my team because we all put in the same amount of effort...and somone who went to plat 1 on ps4 to gold 1 on pc i would say to get a team

Well done!!!! Keep up the ace coming!

Real Thermite mains find a way.
---
No vertical play.
---
Yeah I somehow already know outback better than probably any other map. Just in terms of the way it plays. 
---
Fortress confuses the living hell out of me still. 
---
Wish it was
---
I asked this once with a group of randoms who proceeded to tell me if I wanted a particular operator then I should play them..
---
it was consulate, I was thermite and the defenders were obviously were going to pick garage bomb site. But hey I should know to just play Thatcher and thermite at the same time so it was my own fault really
---
Cav be the thiccest

This dude on Jupiter

Cav up there, but Valk, Finka, clash, and nomad are the thiccest

yeah the old had too much movement, on the new map i can just hide in a corner with my ACOG and wait for the attackers to walk into my crosshair.
---
It's so great, i barely have to use my brain anymore.
---
I swear it's because 60% of this sub is echo tank and if they see downvotes they just click it without reading.
---
Made the box taller so that it is no longer vault-able for spawn peeking defenders

As a non-spawnpeeking rook/glaz main this scares me
---
Usually I take the role, and whenever something goes wrong I blame the others saying I did my part lol
---
How do you know he got carried it doesn’t show his stats

You can assume they’re being carried by the fact that they’re unbanked and playing against diamonds on both teams.

But... In the killcam nobody is there? I don't think your video is going to explain that at all....
---
BTW the weird noise is my friend juggling 
---
That was sick as hell, I haven't seen small flicks like that on console in a while
---
Is this not seen as a problem? Nothing is more frustrating then getting shot "around a wall" and it hasn't been a problem until the camera was changed. Only thing more annoying is how bad audio has become this season. Hope its being worked on 
---
Pretty good reaction time considering it's console

Yep. I almost can't believe that the position of the viewpoint is even being discussed as a possible cause.

No, I'm twenty
---
And you must be, like, 60 year old virgin?
---
Find out what works for you. Playing site or roaming. Learn from your enemies. Play everyone you have. 
---
Just start with any operator and enjoy the journey!
---
If I were a virgin, how does that prove anything? And if your really don’t see how this is sexualized in anyway, you need to go look at Ying in game, then at this picture, or you’re literally just blind.

I don't think it will either. I'm just kinda tired of these bizzare off the wall ops. I have been playing since the alpha, I'm never putting the game down either way.

I don’t like the picture but I’m okay with the in-game model.

Y4S1 EVENT LEAK! \*NEW* 5V5 FUZE ONLY! CRAZY HIGHLIGHTS AND FUNNY MOMENTS
---
&gt; but fuck is it boring 
---
I like how Villa has vertical play. Same with Chalet. While Chalet is unbalanced, at least it isn't a boring map. Tower, Fortress... they're so dull because every attack has to be the same.
---
One of the oldest tricks in the book. Nothing special and certainly no "hacker".
---
Trash.
---
Check out some videos, they send dogs into buildings first on a regular basis, do you have any idea how intimidating it is to know there's a 150 lb fur missile with titanium capped teeth that can jump 9 feet and run 15 mph waiting for you outside?
---
There's some amazing pics of a Seal dog after he killed an enemy combatant that was attacking his handler.
---
Just do some research, dont take my word for it. It's probably the msot realistic CTU tactic NOT in this game right now except for maybe night vision. 
---
I hope you're trolling.
---
Too true tbh, I have a 1.8 k/d but 0.3 win rate because I am HORRENDOUS at everything but aiming and movement. 
---
Yeah
---
Huh
---
probably because he doesnt have one
---
same. i think my problem with villa is that its frustratingly small. it's designed to have two floors but functionally it has 2 and one for rotations and hiding. i'd definitely like it a lot more if there was a site for bomb in basement(there's one in secure area and it's hella fun to defend on). i also wish there were more than 1 or 2 useful hatches on the map

Jeeze. I thought I was awful at the game! Glad it's not just me.

The BF4 AEK is honestly the most broken overpowered piece of shit gun I've ever seen in any fps game. My god, the flashbacks.

It really takes me just a round or two to get to.know the entire layout, i dont seem to have problem with even the more problematic maps such as theme park, tower, etc.

ok, didnt see you there

Idk whether to upvote this or act like I never saw it.

Fuck yea! More dollars to spend. I've been literally waiting for good Nomad skin forever

Thanks Captain.

I always thought you could spectate players trough ubi interface, maybe i was wrong

Not useless, it be a way for people to turn stuff they don't want into renown and a way for people to get items they want but haven't got in packs.

"Here's Johnny" is all I heard.

Maybe something like hereford 1942?

Yes but really only on 1440p and up.

This would probably be as cringe as the last US Nationals LAN ceremony. Way over the top. In the end it’s just a Game. That’s my opinion 
---
Anything but keyboard and mouse if you have any type of morals.
---
what are your attachments for Nomad?
---
What. Not like you didnt thought the same
---
That's useless because the game it self has some problems

But you did saw. Oh yeah this and MUCH more

Another thing I like about R6 is the renowns you get from duplicates are really good!
---
Ubi deffo put a server on the mars rover, 10/10

Are the match times not published so you can see the order?

Yeah that is true!

I didnt wanna show it, because then people would be afraid to peek it, and id lose the free kills.

Yeah what happened to them? Haven't seen anyone mention it
---
Yeah but Fortnite sucks ass compaired to apex, and is completely dwarfed by siege. Adding a br would ruin it and bring all the annoying and worse toxicity that comes with a game that is very easy to die.

He is just a kid, don't bother.

Very cinematic
---
Rogue 9 did a full damage drop off chart for every gun and updates it with each change. I’ll edit this comment with a link when I find it
---
Yeah, 500 points could be a temporary solution, but not for the smurfs. I think that besides some major fix that the game needs a good rework on how the ranked match works.
---
Looks like classical console FPS gameplay.
---
Thanks for being the only person to actually like my idea
---
Is that pc only? 😂 because i have 100h on Tachanka so 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
bro what the fuck
---
im in a thunt squad that plays on realistic only
---
Yeah but if ubisoft sees my post he might change his mind so upvote it 
---
Sledge is pretty good for attackers and Rook for deffence is also good for begginer. But IMO you can't be wrong, just take any ops you like and play with them lots of hours till you get hang of it. This game is so complex so any ops will have his unique place in the game. Also, you can try all ops for free on TTS when it's up, so you can try before buying them.
---
But when a person at one hit point walks over one... that was my best kill so far
---
Ok, thank you I’ll try
---
You seriously just said Blitz is underpowered? How do you stop him from getting vlose to you when its a 1v1 and hes pushing the site?
---
I like valk on defense because I like seeing where the enemy is coming from. I feel naked if I don't have drones or cameras
---
Personally I think  good voice callouts will always be better. Maybe have pings disabled or something in ranked would be interesting and add more skill to it. 
---
Mute and Twitch. The MP5K and F2 are amazing for people who are new to the game, they have really simple gadgets, . Another tip, there's always a way around, and if there isn't, make one, you'll see what I mean eventually.
---
According to what happened in EFT after inventing a Auction House, no!

Please dont give cheaters a possibility to grind credits and then resell them for real money..

The first comment said if they send you a mask with one fan, implying that hes talking about smokes mask, I said he's probably making a mute cosplay so the mask with two fans would be what he needed. Now somehow you interpreted his comment as him saying mute dies from smokes canisters (not sure where that came from) to which I said no, one breathable fan would be smokes mask and then your last comment was about only one of the fans on the mask working when I was saying the mask would only have one fan on the mask itself. Therefore your comments have been off topic and in consistent with the conversation I had started.
---
144hz for Siege will feel butter smooth. You also probably won't require a whole lot. Though the 144hz monitor might not be very cheap. Honestly that thing will be the only significant price you might may. Otherwise I have a very good 1000 Dollar build here.

Thanks

You can’t lag switch. you were probably being DDosed or someone was trying to ping lagout. Which is attacking an IP address. 
---
Can...can we get bug fixes instead of new cosmetics? Like it's nice to spend money on something that makes you stick out like a sore thumb but I just want my headshots to register instead.

No it doesn't. They were bouncy as hell and akin to ela's scorpion

CLAYMORES AND C4!!!!

Been playing siege for years and I don’t get it. Does Ella really die in awkward positions more than other ops?
---
I agree I think mute is a good counter or maybe just a small gadget tone down like make it 4 pings instead of 5 
---
Yeah I started the season as a gold 4 and now I'm down to silver 3 due to spawnpeakers and rage quitting teammates.
---
That’s just 3099 ping

If it’s stupid and it works, then it’s not stupid :)

Same. I paid rl money and still haven't heard if they are working on a fix or not.

So much hope in one clip

It’s not, boosting is actually a big problem especially on console lol.

I feel ya, last season i was 1 game away from plat 1 and now i almost couldn't get out of gold due to leavers, teamkillers etc

It is for you know, when someone wants to know the result of another match while watching the current one. It is for people who watch the matches live
---
God that was painful
---
Even with the slowere fire rate the l85 does more damage in one second. I did the math. Plus the fire rate only harms how fast the bullets run out
---
That is pretty good
---
Kill cam fidelity and readability is something we can improve on, and you're right that without seeing the POV captures of each individual player it's not a great feeling when what you see and know doesn't sync up with what the kill-cam is showing you. We definitely want to improve the player experience for these types of things, and kill cam improvements are a part of our goals for that in the future.

I'm not wellversed in the world of cyber attacks but Ddossing is just sending so much information that it begs down a server and boots everyone out but the dosser so that's basically the lag switch but a lagswitch doesnt kick everyone out and since only one person from both teams was removed I'm positive that it was a lagswitch

Since we've overhauled DLC operator pricing with the start of this year, we're still deciding on how Operator bundles will fit into that equation - so no news on that just yet.
---
yeah, also gonna miss the free ESP wall chams
---
Try different operators out, find the ones that suits ur play style and just roll on from there mate, the sky is the limit :) 
---
Wiggle with the vigil
---
I got you buddy. But this can't only be used as trolling. This is a preventive mechanism. Let's assume I'm playing with somebody a casual match who is clearly new to the game and he/she accidentally tk-s me. After checking the killcam I see that he/she is cleary  unexperienced player. So there is a high chance that it might happen again. I can choose not forgive him/her. Why me and others in the team should take the damage instead of him/her?    
---
"When had that person just hit forgive, because it was an obvious accident then accidentally hitting a teammate wouldn't be that big of a deal. " - &gt; It's also not a big deal for him he/she just needs to be careful or will take the damage :) Again theoretically why is it better to have "innocents" suffer from somebody's mistakes?  
---
The cav example is actually a good one each operator interaction should be evaluated and treated individually.

Compared to Mute or Bandit. His guns do more damage and have greater range. Sure he doesnt have a nitro cell but he can hold hella angles and two tap if you're accurate.

Dude you are preaching to the wrong choir. R6 is one of the most toxic communities you will ever come across. Accidentally steal someones kill? You're dead. Choose an operator someone else wants? You're dead. Ace a round? Get kicked from the game (legit happened to me) You have to either accept it and laugh it off or don't play. You'll never find logic in an idiots actions. 
---
Wait for real?

I can draw on paper well though, i might try and do that instead

Just click on his name on the post, the guys who posted it

I agree with a lot of the things you said. However, kaids shotgun is really good it takes more shots than the bosg but less recoil. It takes some gun skill to get used. Also, i hate to bring this up but the pistol is one of the better weapons to use for spawn peaking which is something not fun to go against. I think kaid is preferably used for like first defending round so that attacks dont know who they are going against. Plus it would be more handy to have someone who mains kaid to plqy him so that they are already comfortable with the weapons. Also sometimes forcing someone to pic a specific operator is also nice to have tepending on how the enemy team plays.
---
TLDR: you have to be good with his guns and he would be better used as a situational mindgame which should be how an operator should be used.
---
Impacts, kapkan traps, frost mats, positioning and aim, C4.
---
You bragged about... going negative?
---
Well im not saying literally rn... Do you play on pc? 
---
Maybe u don't now, 'drink more hot water' is a joke between chinese guys. In China, people think  if someone got ill you should say some kind words. But some boys always say 'just drink more water (多喝热水). ' Chinese girls think this is male chauvinist. It is now a famous joke in China :D

Yeah I do. I probably can after school.

---
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more uncoordinated team. Good job man 
---
People on the internet are gonna be so honest about their age. It's gonna be great...
---
So is this a new callout? 
---
u/Its_Epi or u/UbiNoty, any insight on this issue?
---
My Damascus Steel skins for Maverick and Clash are missing, and it looks like it's not just me.
---
His shotgun has high recoil? 
---
"good"
---
Lol Thermite is thoroughly white, my guy. But I appreciate the suggestion. 
---
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds
---
Not only will developers take no action, they can't.  This is particularly true on PS4 where Sony has a licensed m&amp;kb. If the developer tried to do anything, Sony would force them to reverse it. 
---
People are allowed to do it. It is very easy to find videos of people using the Xim, Hori TAC, etc on YouTube. Nothing can or will happen to these players. 
---
You could cosplay as my man vigil 
---
u/Its_Epi or u/UbiNoty, halp. We want our skins back!
---
I appreciate the follow up response!!
---
That first kill hurt my eyes lol nice one though! 
---
I was gonna reply “you didnt have to pay for that ACOG” but if you are an OLD player then chances are you might have. I forgot all the renown I spent on attachments.
---
Rip R4-C ACOG
---
I just get a bunch of new players when I queue it
---
Let’s do it. 
---
Cosplay jäger or thatcher
---
Ah indeed
---
English doesn't look like the language for you though.
---
That shit happened to me too pal
---
Impressive 
---
Nut targets
---
I think we can call this scaffolding at the fountain
---
$30 a month for 20mbs with spectrum 
---
you ccan do kapkan or a facepainted operator
---
Red for the blood of all the people he spawn peeks. RIP
---
Idea? Place a mode where it's headshots only just to annoy 
---
Sorry for 30fps I don't know what went wrong during the video export...
---
Man you’re epic. Can I be you?
---
You’ll still only lose elo based on how likely they thought you were to win, so I’m guessing you didn’t lose much?
---
200%
---
Haha
---
Ima be hinest, I got no clue about that map and that callout would probably have worked for me lol
---
Yep, sorry, I made a strange mix with the M249
---
It happens every game for me.
---
You have angered the Ping Gods
---
You can’t hack on console you can use keyboard and mouse or ddos
---
border is the worst map 
---
or clash but that would be a commitment
---
It's a guy
---
That’s actually amazing, nice to see some talent on this sub.
---
Nooooooooo
---
Ya, the only nice thing about lone wolf would be unlimited claymores
---
Bartlett University is not longer in rotation for casual or ranked. You can still play it in terrorist hunt but that’s it. 
---
Guess so, just say "valk cam in thelessia's spot" for short. 
---
I did this last night, thinking it would stick to the tarp on top, but instead it went through the tarp and stuck to the rail behind. I only had view of the of the ground directly below, everything else was covered by the tarp. :\
---
i had a 2.0% it was a dupe
---
That dosen't make sense in the slitghest, his gun was pointed at him with 1938% accuracy.
---
So are they fixing it up and it will be put back in the rotation at a later time?
---
It's like right in-between, Silver 2 lol
---
nah I like it
---
Ddos is technically a form of hacking 
---
I think it has to do with upping the RPM, don’t know either
---
I wouldn’t have much if problem with the one on the top right if they just didn’t change their stance.
---
I don’t believe there is any official word of a rework for Bartlett yet. But it’s possible after the maps that they are already reworking that they bring back Bartlett. 
---
Top left she is a turtle.
---
Top right she is Asian female #3
---
Botton left she is Hibano Destroyer of Worlds
---
Bottom right she is generic Asian female main character #1
---
Can you teach me some Mira strats ?
---
Nah still lost more than normal elo because of the gold 2
---
‘MERICA! 
---
M4 mags can go on any firearm. I have one on my lever action .30-30 as well as my over/under 
---
Well fuck. Oh well. 
---
I have a 1.5 1.5 split and I agree. I come across too many people in casual who want to pretend that stats don't matter at all, and will shit talk based on casual performance. However, i see a lot of low gold players with decent win loss. But if your KD is low it 100% translate to clutch potential and holding your own. I think the best players obviously have high stats in both
---
Only in specific instances so yes and no. 
---
They did fix it. It still has more recoil though. Use a DMR and then Kaid’s shotgun and you’ll see the difference. Isn’t huge but when you can only fire one shot at a time, it is fairly high
---
Or an AKU-12
---
I really dont care if it gets implemented or not. Voice chat is always the best way to communicate to your team. I only use pings to show people what wall im talking about needing reinforced or where I saw an enemy, the color of that ping changes nothing
---
Corsair k63 and Logitech g502 or razed deathadder 
---
Server population for one. Something people overlook all the time
---
You haven’t seen me play though, so how can you even judge whose better? Also I’m on console and I’m assuming the other guy is on PC. 
---
Me Four.
---
Once again, doesnt mean to make someone feel bad. Just to show them wrong... fucking mongoloids.
---
Me five
---
(A Joke)
---
Why does the bottom of it looks like balls?
---
Because vote to kick enabled toxicity. It does not fight it even though some people believe that it does.
---
I have had an 98.50 for my 8th alpha pack and I was so upset
---
in da openin thing ya know
---
How so? Voting off players that cause your team more harm than good doesn't seem that bad
---
bruh this epic asf
---
Me six
---
If you can hit the inital HS the SMG is always better in every case.
---
More bullets down range, more chance to hit head. :))))))
---
But we aren't getting any more new maps [this year](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rainbow-six-siege-year-4-roadmap.jpg).
---
Wot a gaemma
---
Now I can be toxic AND brag about 10 dollars 
---
Lmao
---
r/thatHappened
---
This game is insanely competitive, communication is such a high factor. Pings aren’t going to call out ‘hatch drops’. Voice communication is what makes siege so good. No ping systems change 
---
I use the shotgun, it’s quite good. It’s pretty good long and short range as well as for opening hatch and sightlines, I much prefer it to the smg
---
That’s the only thing the gun is good for, and even then the DMR is better for headshots because of the acog. The aug doesn’t even have an acog, so another disadvantage. I guarantee if you ask any pro player if the aug is better than the dmr/shotgun they will say the aug sucks ass. 
---
lol
---
Kinda hurts my eyes by looking at it. But i guess thats just me

Hello AustenWithanE-, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b5sp3s/this_only_happened_to_me_one_time_so_i_dont_think/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I’m pretty sure everybody with half a brain prefers the dmr/shotgun over the aug. it has the destruction of a shotgun, the range of a dmr, and is one of the best shotguns in the game imo. 
---
I like that is the last kill of the round so everyone gets to witness this
---
Also remember that Siege is just them training with each other so they'll probably be wearing their own equipment
---
Copper4. Rook mine btw.
---
haha, was going to ask the same thing. Literally just watched his video. 
---
I play in EU but I’d be down to play since work means I play at odd hours, which means I can’t play with that many friends in my area, let me know when / if you wanna play my uplay is Skyz-.
---
Also, kudos to you for not letting that stop you gaming.
---
Ill add you when im home! N ty! Means alot
---
I don't think the Apex pong system has any place in siege, lots of situations can only be called out in voice chat
---
...why? 
---
i like the game but honestly i felt 80% of my obstacle of winning was either getting people to play a role, getting them to play that role properly (ana not healing properly, rein just charging away, etc) and then the biggest one was actually getting teamwork done. "save your ults for next fight" is something that apparently is impossible for people to understand
---
i had 500+ hrs in overwatch and got up to gm when i quit because of those reasons, and came back to siege. despite what people say, the community is better here imo and getting teamwork is 10000000x easier. "watch my drone/cam" and people will actually do it
---
and the fact even if you have a leaver or are 1v3 its still pretty winnable , overwatch if you had a leaver it was gg
---
Just switch to pc then, not like there are any cheaters on there.... rook mine btw
---
...i didn't even realize there was a cut scene... I just beat it to finish that whole thing
---
Really!?
---
Honestly, a bit horrifying. I would've easily been shot from that window while being completely entranced by that nonsense, glad you made it out. 
---
True I did forget about that. 
---
I dont have the money...
---
Oh, stuff like this happens every once in a while when I'm facing Coppers
---
Me: he's in the connector.
---
Ally: what's a connector?
---
Me: sorry, I don't know call outs for this map.
---
Ally: neither do I.
---
For real tho, what's the name for that red room on the second floor of Skyscrapper, between tea room and office sites? 
---
Old
---
General Kenobi
---
dude what is this pls explain...
---
If you want a workaround as long as a lobby of thunt had more than a single person you can press to play again and still get boosted rewards. If you can have someone join your lone wolf lobby then just have them leave so you get boosted renown. As for the easier part, is it really easier to have level 15s picking your spawn and getting 2-3 kills max? Doesn't help you or them really. 
---
Odd flex but okay
---
OMG! Wow! What a toss!
---
Is there a way I can join your games? It seems fun!
---
~~But can I not be on the same team as the guy who threw the C4? I've had bad experiences with him and smoke cannisters before~~
---
I like that the first 60% of this video is irrelevant. 
---
Would be funnier if fuze got a kill.
---
The map pool in competitive CSGO is much smaller than our ranked pool, and the maps are much simpler, so maybe the reason people are bad at Siege is because they play bad maps too often, badly.
---
If they played good maps, well, maybe we'd all get better at the game and I wouldn't load into lobbies where people don't know basic rotation holes.
---
found the unranked causal player, who thinks it’s funny to call people copper. 
---
On their bath tub
---
When they announced a remake of the map I was like "oh nice, I bet it's like move some stairs, change up some rooms and windows. "
---
Then they removed one of my favorite maps and replaced it with a twice as big and shitty looking map (I liked it because i like small maps)
---
Henlo comrade, would you like non alcoholic water
---
Set pack as in for the 4 brand new elite skins for clash maverick nomad and kaid? Because if so, yea they work. You just have to validate the dlc into your account once you purchase on uplay and you'll be all set to go. All you have to do is start your game after purchase; it'll ask you if you want to permanently link the set to your account. All you have to do from then is just click accept.
---
Unless you're talking about a completely different thing and i'm getting this wrong.
---
Yes, i once did that and my ps4 crashed and restarted.
---
Haha jokes on you I wanna die
---
Bold of you to assume ranked will leave beta
---
I hate to be "that guy" but this guy has baffled my team of level 400/level 500+ players. We are fairly certain he either has multiple people playing on his account, or AFKs/AFK'd for a long time while being carried. His stats simply don't make sense, especially compared to a legit level 500. Don't want to witch hunt or degrade the guy, but take ALL his stats with a grain of salt as they are most likely inflated/deflated.
---
Its leaving in season 2
---
so many people crouch walk because its a crutch and theyre bad at the game.  they crouch walk because they rely on the extra second it takes for an adversary to change his aim to crouch level.  it has nothing to do with sound its not difficult to hear people crouch walking if youre actually paying attention.
---
Who needs pinpoint accuracy when u have a large magazine
---
Heck yeah

Yeah ive seen the joke... only in this subreddit have i ever seen anyone take offense to it
---
Tbh I barely see anyone crouch walk at my lvl, the people I go against usually rush in with a teammate droning for them, hold tight ass angles, and use peeker's advantage on every corner, if I do see a crouch walker they're usually lvl 50 and below and have no clue what the fuck they are doing.

When you want that free upvotes

Yea that’s always a bonus
---
Lol 20 kills, that's sick dude
---
One on her main gun and the other when she uses the pistol
---
I agree with this opinion. Bartlett was a great map. For casual. 
---
Technically everyone is one shot away supposing it's a head shot
---
Peeked*

Drivers license
---
Well it’s basically a cosmetic attachment so fuccboisupreme has the right idea.

Welcome to siege I’m fairly new to siege as well (been playing since Christmas) but I’m ranked as a gold 3 and  such (ps4 btw)
---
Both of you... 
---
Remember when putting Bartlett U in your T-Hunt playlist would trigger A5 queues?
---
That was fun.
---
Oh... I was confused. I'm 15 but I think I'm fairly ok on that point. I use push to talk, and never rage on mic. I make efficient call outs most of the time. So I don't think dl is necessary, just to not be toxic. Don't be an idiot, essentially

It's for exclusivity

Oh hi mark

Umm ok

That’s better you can destroy barbed wire by shooting it

I only have it on IQs Sig. Refuse to use that gun until they fix the model or change it’s mag capacity to 20.
---
Still need help lol
---
*Art team strikes again!*

6 if you count Kaids pistol (don't know if it counts since you don't get a choice in the matter).

Isn’t this thing a semi? Or am I thinking of the FBI shotty?

That last bullet was a gift from the gods.

On pc he would die immediately after showing one mm of his hat

Nice
---
where was this explanation given? definitely not in game, because I received no notifications about it.
---
regardless, if they take it from me, the refund should be given immediately.
---
I'm not talking about millimeters. I'm talking about this video. Full auto firing at point blank range, and it was like what the 48th, or 49th out of 51 that randomly clipped lesion in the head? Guns don't do that. Video game developers seem to think all guns behave like a shotgun. As in once it leaves the barrel, the bullets path mushrooms out. Which is ridiculous. The bullet will go dead straight from the direction the barrel was pointing when it was fired. 
---
Maverick looking like chef Boyardee
---
I’m turned on 
---
Buy Maestro. As a Ela main myself I know how much she sucks to play. Her guns are pretty bad unless you use the shotgun which is her best weapon. Her Scorpion is manageable but the horizontal recoil is random and quite bullshit. Her gadget is sub par and her pistol is just standard. She out of any roamer is the worst roamer in the game most likely but I still love her... Sadly Ubisoft never will.
---
A I think ban is unnecessary, but this definitely should be fixed
---
I know. I hated it that I bought other headgear and uniform, but after they fixed it, I couldn’t do anything but equip it right away. It loons amazing now.
---
Copper six this isn't how it works fucking idiot

In my general experience, the high ranks do like to ruin casual. I’ve started going against higher ranks when I play casual (which is what I mainly play because of how try-hard ranked is) and I will get runouts on spawnpeeks done to me against plats &amp; high golds. Not saying all high levels do casual to destroy low-levels, it just feels like they go way too toxic to “warmup” (my first match as a lvl 80 a lvl 300 plat 3 jumped out a window in casual and now I don’t like high ranks anymore)
---
No. There is a reason that Rook is picked a lot thanks to the added benefit of the armour. The fact that only go into DBNO with armour equipped and the fact that the one extra bullet you can catch can go a long way. This idea adding on that is pushing it, and Rook isn’t in need of a buff anyway.
---
You could not be rude JV.

But that elo though
---
Its for scale
---
Why does this subreddit circlejerk over black ice skins? They look pretty mediocre at best.
---
Mute
---
Aside from the face that article 5 is available in the hunt, and the fact I hate it, it's ment to introduce the player to the multiplayer aspect of the game
---
And for most of the clip the barrel is bouncing around and either to the left or right of Lesion, so there you go, your wish has been granted
---
Glacier is way harder to get. To get Black Ice all you need to do is to have enough luck. Glacier is only for R6 credits if I remember correctly.
---
They might just have a show network connection. It's not right to ban someone for having a slow network connection.
---
Ubi have been told plenty of times about the no abandonment bug, but they're choosing to ignore it. 
---
I mean Mute can also get some hatches like laundry room on Oregon and completely cover garage door on Chalet with one jammer as opposed to two batteries AND doesn’t destroy every team gadget on the wall/in the barbed wire
---
im indebted to the devs for making the newcomer playlist. having only 3 maps to learn is a godsend. I hope the game lives on for many more years!
---
I have that too. Switching to windowed and back to fullscreen is a temporary fix.
---
When peepee not standing. That’s ruler for

Does anyone know what causes this stuttering in the menus? It happens every game and the only way to fix it seems to be changing in and out of full-screen.

That just seams that you accidentally pressed a the swap button twice because that never happens to me

_what?!_

Stealing a kill isn’t that serious that you have to make someone sit out of the game for 2 rounds.
