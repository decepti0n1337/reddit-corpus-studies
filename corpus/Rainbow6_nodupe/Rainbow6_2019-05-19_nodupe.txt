Have a strange feeling this is fake...would love to be wrong though.

Should be! Most of the figures I ordered from eBay came from Russia, haha.
---
If you had let him continue shooting teammates reverse friendly fire would have kicked it. A certain amount of friendly fire damage will start it.
---

---
The new system is to stop teamkilling. So by deliberately teamkilling him your just hurting yourself. 
---
Don't tk.
---
there is currently no known max level. if you mean person, then that is I believe fikealox, and maciejay and kinggeorge are also all over level 500. and there used to be a "glitch/exploit" but those people are banned now years ago and one of the guys levels was 600+
---
huh ok
---
i would say Ubi needs to give Nokk an F2000 or Tavor or even another AR15 rifle variant. i dont mind if they nerf her ability in exchange for the stronger primary, i just want at least ONE single new gun in the new season! i cant believe they went lazymode and just reuse existing guns
---
this looks amazing, have my upvote
---
dont forget the glaz rifle barrel
---
Alrighty thanks,I just found it and was wondering where it came from
---
All games are repetitive to an extent, siege can be depending on what level you play. Each update brings a rework of existing operators or maps which are requested by the community or introduce a new map and 2 operators. These are fairly common and pre set time wise.
---
Thanks a ton, man!
---
I just want a picture of a god dang hot dog
---
Wait which one r u, i thought u were the copper??
---
So no counter?
---
When is the TTS live?
---
Fuck you reposting dickhead
---
Idk what they were thinking with that one. MPX shoulda have never been given to another op. Why would anyone want a second operator with an MPX. Why would anyone even want the MPX on an operator. I only use it on Valk because I have no other option. Which is also the reason I never play Valk. Because her only full auto is complete trash.
---
I'm that case, why not just have her use the mp5 rather than the fmg9? Then you'd have the extra element of apparent realism

It's a power move, pull out your camera mid shootout to assert your dominance. He may kill you but he'll always know you did not fear for your death.

That’s cool as shit I hope Ubi rips of off big time
---
I’m 1000% on board with an update to make defenders who get killed trying to spawn peek look embarrassing.

tightening and loosening the same bolt that shouldn't even be there lookin ass

Spider web = catches stuff | Magpie = catches stuff?

This one isn't straightforward like most others ex. Sledge or Rook where it literally shows a hammer and armor case. Those give you an idea that one has something to do with a hammer and other with armor. Good example to Jager's icon is IQ; gives you the idea that she can see something extra or Bandit and his icon which tells you he has something to do with electriticy which relates to his gadget as he electrifies reinforced walls. 
---
And now compare those icons to Kaid's diamond with sword or Mozzies bike helmet; no relation whatsoever to his Rtila / Pests, their icons don't give you a slightest hint.
---
Thanks very much, I can only hope!
---
I can’t remember the E3 trailer, I wasn’t following back then. As far as I’m aware it’s the most tactical shooter out at the moment (apart from milsims) and is incredibly team oriented but this also depends on the level you play at. I agree with the doors thing but I’m not sure wether that would work out. More breaching options would be nice but realistically what more could they introduce without going too far from some kind of realism. Not sure what you mean by peeking underneath. This game has an ungodly amount of destruction available, if there was anymore the map design simply wouldn’t matter as you can destroy the whole thing if you feel like it.
---
I think at lower levels it’s a horrific game to play but the higher you get the more enjoyable it gets
---
u rite
---
i wouldn’t be piping up with unicorn main as your flair. not funny at all. just gay.
---
Variance, justification for the vortex sight, because ubi has extra chromosomes. I've given up trying to understand what they do and just hope for the best balance that they can muster.
---
Looks like I am a Pulse Main now

Who cares about clash..or claymores....or deployable shields...or iq invisibility glitches...or cheaters...or ragequitters...or getting stuck after vaulting outside a window into a airjab... or tons of other messed up stuff

To troll on casual I guess

The truest entry denial device
---
A direct counter could be implemented for balancing purposes (e.g. using two Brimstones.) The idea is more about the trade off of having one impenetrable reinforcement rather than two semi-impenetrable ones.

Pretty sick

Love some of the creative abilities like the paintbomb and shockwave

Then why u main him if he sucks

Take that up with blasio6.

Thanks for stopping by! She is definitely situational, geared towards ops like kapkan, being first entry into a room and suppressive fire. She would probably be better with a shield option similar to Fuze honestly. Do you have any suggestions to make her more viable?
---
Bro I would love that. Fo-12 is one of my favorite weapons in the game.
---

Yeah, a few subs for games I'm in are really toxic about subjects involving sexuality, gender, and race. It's really disappointing to see so many cheering on gross speech. Worse yet I got a app on my chrome that let's me see certain groups they might be apart of. They tend to all come from the same dumpster fires.
---
The thing is, it doesnt. They're just both white guys with facial hair and headsets.
---

---
Yes, creating the ability is much more time-consuming but, as I said before, that's the most important aspect of an operator. They concentrate in the ability first and then they think about guns, secondary gadget, name, logo, etc. New guns are more work (and more things to balance). They probably didn't had time and they just recycled old balanced guns.
---
Was having this. Now I'm in an 8 minute wait for a rank match.

The high-contrast area around the skull and name indicate some shenanigans.

As per FotoForensics, "Error Level Analysis (ELA) permits identifying areas within an image that are at different compression levels. With JPEG images, the entire picture should be at roughly the same level. If a section of the image is at a significantly different error level, then it likely indicates a digital modification."
---
**tl;dr**: Unaltered portions of a jpeg will have about the same level of compression as the rest of it ([like this processed picture of Castle's 'Velvet Shell' headgear](http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=8d7ce79b59a69067694b3c8f9ad67437dfef1542.90786)), but that "Doom Skull" one seems quite more sus than the real headgear.
---
Here are the same pictures through Forensically (has more options and stuff than FF, but both do the job perfectly):

My thoughts are wait until it actually is revealed and I can play it, then I’ll make a decision

I like the game, so I play it. Sounds as if you don’t like it though, so probably just best to keep playing whatever you’ve been!
---
The in-world laser is a downside meant to offset the benefit, which is improved hip-fire accuracy. In 90% of cases, this trade-off is not worth it. However, it is *always* worth it for the following two weapon classes:
---
**Shotguns**: Laser sights will tighten the hip-fire spread of the pellets, and because shotguns are close-range ambush weapons it's easy to hide the laser sight.
---
**Pistols w/ shields**: You are already so fat and loud that the enemy will know your position long before they see your laser, and you will be hip-firing often with a shield up.
---
How do I gotta get any of them
---
Ultimate edition is 55 on ps4 right now it comes with all the operators including year 4
---
How do I get one

The one you play the most, or get more kills with!

I’d kills for a thumb thumb in this game.

wow. truley epice.

Love the operator ideas. The last two not not so much, but they are still interesting operators. The other six are great ideas though and I’d love to see them implement at some point.
---
NOW THIS. IS EPIC.

This isn't real.

New Phantom Sight weapon leak! Jk, we’re not giving y’all any new guns
---
hit the dab like mia khalifa
---
For all the jokes Siege players make about "thicc" female operators, they don't even make the jokes about the right ones.
---
Thanks very much! Anything you found specifically disappointing?
---
I didn't open any of them until a month into burnt Horizon. My target was 230 but I stopped at a 213. When burnt Horizon began I have about 170. Maybe the fact that I accumulated many more after burnt Horizon led to this but in any case I would wait just to make sure yourself. What's the worst that could happen you get The Usual Suspects. And if it's a winning scenario than hey cool beans. But I'm optimistic and I believe patience will be rewarded. Good luck!
---
The background of the store is new though, so unless someone else edited the background in, this could be a community inspired skin of sorts
---
I’m buying cav after watching this lmao
---
Actually sometimes I don’t use a laser on smoke. I open up a lot of stuff with his shotgun and you waste more ammo with a laser
---
Lord of the rings?
---
Ay that's pretty nut
---
Would the weapon on the bottom be called a desert 90 or super eagle?
---
Of course you'd fatfinger with all that sweat dripping off of your palms
---
Honestly I think it’s a tie between gridlock and maverick
---
Also I forgot to mention...DRONE. At lower ranks people use their drones incorrectly, once you know where the objective is there is no reason to keep your drone in that area. Take it to the spot you know you want to enter, or a spot that is common for spawn peeks. Learn good static drone placement so that you and your team can gather intel. Also, you should be droning during the round, far too many players rush in a room without droning it out first. My team keeps someone on drones that clears ahead of us until we gain control of the part of the map we want to push from. Knowledge is power has never been more true in a video game than in siege.
---
For me buck or zofia
---
Maverick because he pissed other people off and his guns are good
---
Looks great
---
repost
---
That wasn’t me who replied; I got them from the Ubisoft store online.
---
Just y1 and current year
---
MP5SD with no acog? They seem to be moving in that direction and her ability gives you the opportunity for closer fights.
---
Use the shotgun
---
I actually really like where she is right now; situational, but strong in the right situation. Giving her a shield and her explosive resistance would be a bit much in my opinion. With this year adding 6 more ops and her coming at the end of next year, ops are going to become more situational overall, so this is a great design.
---
Less development....? It’s ubi’s most successful game and has been growing steadily for years now. It’s one of the most active fps games. Ubi absolutely has the resources to put in at minimum 2 new guns. They contract out companies to make entire temporary, seasonal event game modes. To add 2 new guns to the game? That’s got to be the easiest thing. I honestly don’t understand why they did this. I’m looking forward to them giving a reason tomorrow at the reveal.
---
I honestly thought the same. First time I saw their loadout I actually thought it was fan content. Like, it just feels weird to have new operators who don't have a "signature gun".
---
Quick, buy the R6 charm!
---
Holy hell this is actually pretty good.
---
is fuck you a valid reason?

I really love Barbero. Covering up the holes is what we will need next! Good job.

---
These are really cool, some of them are similar to ideas I've had before though you've presented them in better detail and better looking than I ever could. The oil rig map in particular would be a cool setting

Likely just farming karma to sell the account or use it for something else.

It's taking so long because whatever nut she is attempting to tighten or loosen is just being rotated right and then back to the left... That tool is not ratcheting... She is waiting her time lol.

Mozzie will get on it and wheelie was then he’ll ride across the background, attempt a sick jump and then just eat shit, gridlock’ll sigh as she grabs her tools and starts walking.

I heard some people say that it may go on sale because of pro league finals; doesn’t seem too likely now though.

I know they aren't expensive I just feel it's kinda tedious and that I feel like I got ripped off slightly.  Idk man I feel like ubi just og lioned me while I hear blitz coming and Doki is calling me im being tracked by jackal and buff capitao is shooting bolts at me and im hiding in closet on first floor consulate looool

God damn you now I see it too. [MY PAIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfN3A5DnaTM)
---
That would be rad.
---
oh fuckin hell I thought it was like a Nathan Explosion thing...yikes.
---
I would honestly just go on terrorist hunt and learn how to control the recoil. When I practice recoil control on something that normally has crazy recoil I'll fire the entire mag through it and learn how to that way. That's about all I can suggest for you.
---
No problem
---
What other operation didn't have at least 1 unique gun per operator? Oh, right, none.
---
And people seem to be fine if Nokk even had something like the MP5SD. The problem is the operators aren't going to do their roles well. Nokk should be 3 speed, especially with no ACOG available (the only non-shield attacker to not have access to it). Then there's Warden who has the MPX, 1 of the weakest guns in the game, and he's a 3 armor with no ACOG (Tachanka &amp; Clash being the only other cases... the 2 lowest picked operators in the game). Then you have his ability which works better when standing still, but he doesn't have access to an ACOG so he's at a huge disadvantage at holding angles.
---
Good title.
---
A yes, Doom Skull, Red Skulls cousin.
---
Buck, maverick, nomad tbh.
---
The fuck is this post? Plenty of shotguns have grips like that.
---
I would have rather had an algorithm for matchmaking instead of wannabe pro league but to each their own.
---
EVERY. TIME.

Ever heard of TF2? Even isolated from it's oversaturation, I'd like a better chance at older stuff
---
What is wrong with clash
---
you mean you DONT want to pretend like you are in pro league? Come on now. /s
---
you are,and this is evil!
---
Aww shit here we go again.
---
Well they don't all need to be featured is my argument to that. Rainbow is a mainly multi national force but just how reflective is it of that when theres 4 U.S. units now?
---
Ubisoft is a Canadian company. I expected at least 2 Canadian units but apparently there plan was to release Buck and frost of the JTF2 and forget about those two characters entirely cause if you've noticed those 2 have not recieved any kind of buff or rework what so ever since I dont know. Year 1?
---
When compared to all the other operators what does bucks ability really bring to the table? Oooooo an under barrel shotgun that sucks. Uhhhhhh cool?
---
It's an underwhelming ability that has very little use now. They should either rework it or put in a new Canadian unit that's more techy and up to date.
---
They get hated for it because they are perceived to he good players, right? So, if they play something *casual* instead of a sweaty gamemode, they are hated on as their skill is being used on casual noobs.
---
The paintbomb is a really cool idea. Shocked Visage to me is literally a perfect idea: map and operators both. I'd love to see it and ideas from other seasons in this image actually implemented. Great work, cvardy1998!
---
Just because his gadget doesn't directly affect your team doesn't mean it isn't helping out. E.g. Vigil, his gadget doesn't seem helpful but it's perfect for burning time, which helps your team. Warden's gadget doesn't seem helpful but it pads down aggressive plays, which helps your team.
---
Took it out because of exploiting
---
I have trained in split screen all my childhood for this!
---
I mean in the news section on the main screen of the game they warned abouut this
---
Issue is ranked can be tough we arent pengu so when you don't perform you get shat on and if you play cas then you also get shat on. 
---
Lose lose really
---
Nice
---
i think your mother dropped you on your head as a baby, or are you just this dumb?
---
It was in the 90s and 00s
---
Shields just aren't as fun as other operators that's why they don't get picked. Not everyone plays the game just to win. On their own shields are pretty easy to deal with, slap a guy behind that shield and gg.
---
They can't remove it. It's an indicator of where enemies are. When walking over some of them operators tend to move them. This is especially true now that Nokk is being added. The best way to fix it, is to add more physical force to the debris.
---
How do you 3d print these.. I really want todo this with all operators
---
Thanks so much!

Hello I-am-pleb, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bqct0l/who_should_i_buy/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

&gt;SEAL units with Desert Eagles
---
Yeah I dunno about that one.

I really appreciate it, thanks so much!

Haven't we moved past the books by now? I dont think the book should have any bearing on what units get added.
---
Check out CoreRoss's video about it.

That's what I was thinking, miss that game
---
It is bound to change at some point.
---
It's cool. I think most people forgot that one Delta guy was even American.
---
YES !!!!!!
---
That's a very good looking weapon skin! Nice pack opening
---
lol you have played in a few days it seems.
---
Could do but unlikely. There was an official player model from Rainbow6BR and it shows Nøkk holding a suppressed deagle. It's no coincidence that in the R6 Developer Notes they are adding a muzzle brake and suppressor to the D-50.
---
Not from spending renown on operators.
---
I like the concept lol. I would totally cop that operator
---
She was?
---
People expect them to play ranked, since they are good at the game. They want to see competitive gameplay, and that's what people expect when watching a pro.
---
They are used. Guy I know out of the 75th was on a FOB out in Bumfuckistan, had a group of SEALs come through, and he asked what all toys they have at their disposal. One guy from the team he remembers specifically mentioning a Desert Eagle, that he used one on an OP and kinda likes the weapon. However, in most situations, he goes with a "regular" sidearm. Reason? "You don't really need that much firepower in a handgun. If you're close enough to use a handgun in our operations, chances are you're meant to be quick and quiet anyway. No sense bringing a hand cannon."
---
But yes, they *are* used.
---
That's got to be some insane spaghetti code honestly.
---
Feels bad man. Did your kills get stolen?
---
You need a good team that’s all, because I have the exact same problem. So we both need a good team lol.
---
Appropriately named as well. I applaud.

There’s way to many common and uncommon items

Same as a kid I thought they were gonna eat me
---
I can’t remember the last time I opened a pack that wasn’t a duplicate
---
That's what makes them common.
---
This needs tk stop.
---
It isn't anything fancy. You just lean in and out without aiming to see if anyone is there. It's unlikely that the other person will react to you fast enough to kill you. And if you're talking about how he checks the room so quickly, that's just how he is. For some people, including myself, noticing details it's very easy so we are able to scan rooms in 1 lean.
---
I use frost all the time but never saw this!
---
Clean gameplay! Killing corner campers have always been my thing, lol.
---
False title, you got a teamkill

My guess is that it's used mostly for disrupting their silhouette and maybe preventing the water from being disturbed as much as possible as they emerge.
---
I suddenly miss tekashi
---
Yep.
---
Solace in knowing that we aren't the only ones.
---
Delta is strictly police, while the operator you photoshopped in is that of FSKs Jegertroppen. In rainbow six siege it would make more sense to add an operator from FSK. I wouldn't know about the other countries.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I also disapprove of the weapons you have selected on a bunch of the operators, but some of the ability ideas are quite nice. Your editing isn't bad at all, its above par really.
---
Absolute legend
---
nice spam is unfunny.
---
nice
---
Lol. I'm bored. I can reply and still not care. If you have a problem then block me.  You seem more bothered by this than anyone else.
---
Laser on: Shotguns for the spread, pistols because if you need to switch you're past stealthy, and some select weapons that get an insane hipfire with them (eg pdw9 and miras vector)
---
There are so many smurfs on R6 these days lol.
---
Of course the Matrix caused the issues on purpose xD
---
I would play pulse if i had this
---
What do you mean “has very little use now” I see buck every other round along with him being one of three ops with frags, he’s also quite common in pro league
---
Nice.

Recruit elite skin

Tachanka approves

Reddit will freak out like they did about Lion, Alpha packs, Hereford, China server changes, the shit events, and any changes that effects their main. But they will still login the next day and they'll still buy the elite skins. Its reddit, a home for dev white knights.

Exactly so she could have had a new gun but it wouldn't have been able to have an ACOG attached to it because she can ADS while using her ability.

BTW this confirms they only get 2 weapons

I have made a couple so I can sneak into the new comer playlist and message new players tips and tricks for the game to try and help out new comers so this game can build strong and skilled player base

You are not the first one with this joke but it is still good xD
---
Pretty much.
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Shoud be put in regular dictionary so it gets out there. Because this is a really fancy term.
---
Most often I see it is because people wanna have a few easy games on a new account, occasional people get a smurf to play with some lower level friends so they don't drag all their level 50 silver friends up against level 200 plats
---
Literally fake
---
1: Smoke is an S tier or high A tier at the very least, he is almost picked or banned in almost every pro league round, regardless of region, as he drains more time from enemies compared to every other op in the game, besides maybe clash
---
2: Castle is a core component of a ridiculous amount of strategies and without a castle you are limited on what strats you can do on certain objectives. He's a B tier at the very least
---
3: Ying is a B tier at the very least. If a team knows how to abuse ying, she's capable of being high S tier. Like every single team bans her against Mouz and Penta. Because if they don't, it's basically an auto loss because Slebben and Hungry would destroy your ass with Ying.
---
4: Buck is not an S tier. However, on border he is an S tier, as he can single handedly win the attack round if the team is defending armoury
---
5: Jackal is ridiculously good and gives the attackers a massive advantage on certain maps such as Villa. Which is why a lot of teams insta ban Jackal on Villa. I would say somewhere between B and C tier, as only because Jackal isn't as useful on some maps
---
6: Clash is nowhere near an F tier. Certain teams on certain maps can use clash so well. Mouz really loves to use the clash
---
7: Montagne falls somewhere between the B and A tier. Take G2 for example, they steamroll with Pengu on the Monty and this is why Monty is the most banned attacker against G2.
---
There's more questionable stuff but these are all I have time for right now
---
Bro the guns are fucking backwards, 
---
-  give warden the fmg and give it its fold out animation.
---
- give nøkk the MPXSD instead since shes a sneeky bitch
---
Still no operators from Balkans
---
Honestly, I don’t care if they do only get two, it doesn’t bug me. You’re kind of proving my point on how salty this community is though. And if you’re trying to argue or debate about it, I’m really too tired for that shit, or don’t care enough. 
---
I’ll still play both of the new operators, regardless of how salty everyone else feels about them. Not to mention, there’s no way to make people always happy, and no matter what they would be complaining. That’s Siege. 
---
Have a good evening and happy Sieging.
---
Perfect for those players with zero peripheral vision!

I was a top player in RS3BA and RS Lockdown. This game is shit anyway. At least you could easily carry a team of AFKs in the other games.

# IIII NEEEED IIIT
---
I agree
---
I’ve been playing since the beta in 2015 and each time I get on hoping for my first non-frustrating experience, but nope. This is the only game I don’t ever enjoy.
---
correction: HOLY FUCK ITS THE BENELLI FROM REAL LIFE WAT
---
well, if it works it works.
---
I live in a country where actual guns are rarer than smart people.
---
This one headgear alone looks better than the whole elite set.
---
But I... I like clash
---
That's just how it is. It's an unspoken rule, if your team Recruit rushes and you are the only one not to, you should expect to either get TK'd or kicked. Learned that the hard way lol.
---
You should try recruit rushing, it's a lot of fun. I hate playing recruit unless I'm Recruit rushing with my team.
---
You're the hero we don't deserve. Thank you.
---
The algorithm used. Rogue 9 made a video about it. They use microsofts true skill algorithm.
---
You get and lose more points depending on how high your uncertainty value is. The more you play the lower this value gets.
---
That’s the dumbest algorithm I’ve ever heard of it’s should be points rewarded dependent on the mmr of both teams, like overwatch
---
only 40 upvotes wtf, that's almost 2 hours of work mate I feel like you deserve more
---
Why would they make it a fake headgear for Pulse? It would fit Vigil so much better.
---
Of course
---
Do you always record just these moments
---
more like nice x69
---
What is that laugh
---
They've forgotten about the random player who takes out your friend too
---
But why? Why would you do that
---
There is one thing I don’t like you don’t say holland because then you’re only talking aboud north and south holland the province not The Netherlands the actual name of the country
---
That’s absolutely right, y’all just goofing off in ranked while I’m out here fighting the real battle in casual terrorist hunt 😤
---
I've had the same problem, I uninstalled after the whole China fiasco, and after all the glitches that have been around lately, I don't plan on coming back. Also, even in Gold back when I played it was just constant teamkilling and other horseshit.
---
Toxicity: they got us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Furry here (raccoon fursona) that's cool as hell
---
Thankyou and was thinking yhe same i mostly drae from the front orsid enad thought id try over the shoulder :D
---
Legend
---
Yeah that's on me, I have always used them interchangeably as names for the country, will certainly be adapted! A couple of Dutchmen have brought it up. Hope you enjoyed the rest of it
---
Can I high five your wife
---
You’d have a full 30 seconds to get ready before his head came around the corner 🤣
---
Epic gamer
---
oh sorry.  i didnt see that
---
Plays! Plays are what happened!
---
Let's wait for the reveal. For all we know they are placeholder weapons and the true loadouts are yet to be revealed.
---
Yes thank you I’m Dutch myself but apart from that .... love it
---
oh hi mark
---
By counter I mean that there's finally someone who cav actually has to be a bit worried about, cos right now Cav pretty much has free rein of the map (btw I'm talking about soloq so coordinated attacks are non existent)
---
His abilty is just garbage. He is gamebreaking if they make him better, and he is too bad if they nerf him. They should just rework him or remove him. He is the most failed operator in this game (same with bb tho)
---
Oof
---
It's been too long XD
---
&gt; Feedback,Personally,I want it Remove from Ranked,as it's a "Unbalanced" Map in my Perspective
---
Gonna need some elaboration on that, since it is considered the first balanced competitive map since villa, and is built in the buffed clubhouse's image, which is a balanced competitive PL map.
---
This looks like a really bad comedy show in a un know network
---
there are 50 ways to make her show on cam
---
also, most (important) cams are dead by the time planting happens, so again, useless.
---
Why do some legendary items become unavailable, are they all time-gated?
---
This happened to me on Hereford. I was using the drone, and suddenly it was just outside, and I could ping enemies and they couldn't see the drone
---
Mute would probably be the introvert friend of thermite(I think of him as a core of some clique) and they would blow up the school by accident...
---
🤡
---
They did a bit but yeah it's a reuse and that's because this makes way more sense than giving nokk a new effect
---
You have what the clip can hold but since it's at the start you have the clip + put one in the chamber. Max efficiency
---
Warden is 3 armor? Are you kidding me?
---
Peripherals man
---
Yep, and if they catch mute, he wouldn't say a thing. For obvious reasons.
---
Hello spider-san, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bqepr3/oh_thanks/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
When you edit so nicely.
---
Aren't they a French company?
---
Nope it will never come back - like seasonal skins they're limited purchases.
---
This is a season made while Ubisofts focus is on GR:Breakpoint. They likely has to push out this season with less overall Dev time being on this season, yet we’re getting two cool operators with gadgets that will have an impact on the game in a positive way. 
---
Yes they have reused weapons but so what. As long as this is only for this season, instead of becoming a trend, I can understand this for Phantom Sight. 
---
Yes if they added new weapons I’d be happier but the operators and their gadgets are what this game is built on so they’ve spent most of the time on building these ops. 
---
I see no issue with this season and it will actually be a breath of fresh air to not have any obvious meta defining operators. 
---
Plus Overlap is fine and acceptable and needed. Keep that in mind
---
you need to cite "ALL" instances of glitching to make it legitimately a cheat.   Which, in life-cycles of games is nearly impossible because continuous development give rise to these glitches and you can only blame play testers for not being thorough in their job to prevent them from happening.
---
The best developers can do is what they are doing right now, which is patching the system as soon as possible.    Punishing players because of using or performing the glitch is *poor form* on the part of the developers cause, sensibly, it was placed there however unintentional.   Your have to admit,  all is fair in love and war.  Until it is deemed a "feature" or "glitch" it's fair play.
---
They are a multi national group but also a multi ctu group that uses many different strats and the US has a lot known units that fight in various ways. And the most important part is every one knows them plus most players come from the west and especially the us
---
I saw this and in new. Your welcome.
---
The smg 12 is awesome? And there gadgets must be balanced out
---
Doubt it was for ‘weapon balance’ though, more like they had less dev time with Breakpoint being a big focal point, so they had to reuse weaponry as they couldn’t make new ones this season. 
---
Shame but I get it and it really doesn’t bother me....as long as it doesn’t become a trend
---
Too much effort
---
I’m not saying the background is fake, I’m saying that if the skin is originally from someone else which was posted a year and a half ago. Then either this background was edited in, or it is a new skin coming out as this white background was introduced recently
---
Uh huh. I'd expect the guy testing it out would know enough to do that, though it's not confirmed in the video.
---
Yeah because those needles are really hard to see. They’re loud though so if someone is close they can definitely hear it but they are almost invisible to the attackers.
---
What maniac does vertical split screen?
---
My whole team had reverse friendly fire on us and still won 3-0
---
U can Team up with Mira and make nice C4 plays when the attack is smoke planting? Pls think first
---
I respect, and the dude abides.
---
#9:16 aspect ratio rise up!
---
i thought it was an oil painting from that quality
---
It’s missing a fortress rework. 🤔
---
the maniacs who put cardboard between the two sides of the screen so you cant screencheat, aka me and my friends
---
Ohhhh thanks guys I wasn't aware of that 
---
Thanks :)
---
That's fair. I'm hearing alot of dissapointment from the abilities.
---
How about a microphone operator that can deploy microphones here and there as defenders and gets a ping when it picks up on something
---
I don't care that you broke your elbow
---
been doing this for 3 months, its an absolute power move
---
yeah, it's not just grab pre-existing weapons and bung them on there, for sure
---
With that headgear, I would thing I'm RICARDO MILOS!
---
She could still be cute under everything ;)
---
Just take my upvote lmao
---
There's one glaring issue in my opinion though, when it comes to an attacker not having an acog.. A defender without an acog is doable as you're a defender, meaning you have lots of options when it comes to picking your engagements. As an attacker, you won't have that luxury as often, since you're fighting on the defenders' terms unless they screw up. 
---
I'm not saying that Nøkk not having an acog has made her useless in advance, but coupled with the FMG's already low damage - especially at range - you can very quickly get in trouble. Sure you can try to use your gadget to flank by hiding yourself from cams, but that doesn't help against a Doc or Maestro holding a long angle on your way towards the objective.
---
Thanks! Yeah but I often forget out of panic, stress and caution as if I turn it off, the enemy will instantly show up and kill me before I could ready my weapon. :c
---
Thanks! I sometimes stream as well and capture these clips. I might as well do full matches at some point because some deaths are quite embarassing. :D
---
They don't even look like they are from the same game
---
don't tell her I said that
---
only ubi knows :c
---
maybe she is, and this is showcased with the season pass headgear? either way, I hope there is a cosmetic so reveal what she looks like
---
You definitely can be.
---
Buing a new copy of the game is not illegal
---
More interaction would be neat but at the same time, the process sounds very time consuming and distracting.., and you already are on limited time. It also sounds like you'll be taking a big risk with very little reward.
---
I feel like Lion is fair now. I'll compare him to Cav to prove why. With the nerf, you now get points instead of outlines, which makes it less easier. Lion does have the ability to just press a button, but there is a warning to defenders beforehand, where with Cav, Attackers really don't get one. You also have to wait for the cooldown, Cav doesn't have this issue. The drone is about 1.5 seconds long where Cav's time is much longer. 
---
The hold Cav has over Lion is that she's able to see all operators in real time. Lion merely gets an idea now. 
---
Like I said before though, Lion kind of needs to be a run and gun operator for when you're solo. He's absolutely perfect for these situations, and frankly changing something might leave him utterly useless. 
---
I play Lion very often, he's probably my Attacker main, but I think he's fine the way he is. He's good if you get stuck solo, he's perfect to help out your team, and he's really not over powered anymore. I do have an advantage in having the idea of where my enemies are, but that doesn't guarantee a win. If I'm not right there ready to strike, my scan can be seen as a waste, and that's the risk I run all the time.
---
Enough with the American ops though!
---
I wanted an attack Italian operator :(
---
Restarting the game is the only solution I found to work.
---
Its never too late buddy. But the next season is shit so its up to you.
---
That leak got everything right except for Nokk being "cute" and "fan-favorite", especially now that a lot of players hate the guns that both operators have.
---
One in the chamber moron...
---
It's not rare anymore. It was rare before they put it in the alpha packs.
---
Yeah did you not know that
---
Like the old 44.mag of nomad
---
Go to your matchmaking settings and turn off hostage
---
Because every new map and operator are designed and balanced for bomb mode.
---
To have 100+1 in the chamber she will need a 101 round belt,load it with 100 rounds and then reload it,because belt cant physically have more than 100,because it is always one in the chamber
---
Hell yeah brother
---
I have it lmao
---
*yet
---
I like this idea. Maybe a little popup will appear in the bottom?
---
No and yes
---
No cause a youtube did it in the og cs
---
 
---
Yes cause no one does it in the last 9-11 years
---
Lol I also do this
---
So satisfying to know you can get those headgear free from alpha packs ☺️
---
*Never
---
I've actually lost weight so  ╮(╯▽╰)╭
---
is this sarcastic? cuz i don't see how disabling items, to prevent exploits is so bad?
---
I'm presuming they probably will, I don't see why not
---
I've always felt Ubisoft needed to address the fact that there were three distinct game modes with wildly different strategies.  First, holding a certain rank in a single mode doesn't mean the same as holding that rank across other or multiple modes.  Second, a team that specializes in a mode will have a distinct advantage within that mode against a team that plays multiple modes.  Now perhaps Ubisoft should've added a separate rank for each game mode rather than removing two from the set, but that would've come with its own challenges as well.
---
As others have pointed out, Ubisoft balances the game around bomb first and foremost, so if they were going to pare down to a single game mode, bomb was always going to be the choice.
---
I know you're joking but anyone else reading this - there is no evidence to suggest Ubi has reached some limit with adding new weapons. They are either A) "Experimenting" or B) Being kinda lazy.
---
That black ice for frosts shotgun is there for months (if not for years), and paying 765 credits just for one black ice is to much imo
---
I know it's fake but I would definitely pay money for this.
---
A count down
---
Downvoted
---
These are amazing!
---
You're*
---
Does it come with Wi Fi?
---
Always one..
---
Idk, glaz is OP.
---
Had the exact same problem, always 130fps and then it drops to 5 fps for a  few seconds... i fixed it by playing borderless window, i hope that fixes it too for you!
---
Wow so many people in comments section think u should be punished for things u never asked for. 
---
Adjustment is ok for people who lost to hacker team, but winner shouldn’t get punished just because it happened so hacker was on their side
---
Why is that?  I have no idea how it works
---
That's anyway gonna happen, seeing as recruit has literally nothing and the enemy had..... everything.
---
The face is just....so stupid. That mask design gets a 0/10 from me.
---
They are bringing new things like pick and ban into ranked. And I think there will be a rework of a map coming
---
Again you must be talking about in game, because a belt can have more than 100 rounds. All you need is the links. Do you think they just come all made with 100 and that's it?
---
Agreed. Newcommers in an organization don't need to look stupid at all.
---
You will still get stuff from last season, it doesnt matter when you open it, the rewards are already decided
---
3 weeks after it coms on TTS
---
I definitely approve
---
Thanks for clarifying that.
---
Ik?   or 5 kills on terrorist hunt, how am i supposed to do that?
---
Maybe he saw a hostage in the painting.
---
*PTSD triggered*
---
Jokes aside though, from what I saw it's literally like the PMM.. Just bigger and harder hitting.
---
uhhh, Her playstyle is definitely closer to Cav over vigil whithout a doubt and to be honest it might have been overkill to not only give her the ERC but a hyper buffed version of it.
---
No not random pictures. Since Velvet Shell they are doing this new operators hangin style menus and its been like this for 2 years. They are changing it and its shit.
---
I don't. OP gave examples: Gridlock's M249 is modelled differently with a fast reloading 60 round mag, as opposed to the 100 belt of Capitao. Mozzie's P10 Roni is has the same damage and RoF as Alibi's Mx4 but with an entirely different model and mag capacity to offset the strength of his ability vs Alibi. 
---
This is along the lines of what they could have done with the FMG-9 and MPX. Although I don't think the FMG in particular is a good choice to be in this game at all, especially since it's already statistically identical to the MP5K.
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
Fortnite also makes over a billion USD a month so... 
---
Money talks...
---
.... honestly I don't know if Ubi would do this. Many many games have an option to even migrate an account or 1 time copy your account to a different platform but I feel like People would find a way to bug it out and get infinite R6 creds or something
---
love that the first picture is basically rooks operator video
---
Yeah, Smurfs can get quite annoying, but you can't avoid them. Your friend searching will bring the skill lvl of teammates and enemies for both casual and ranked

Then why did you say "you look like a new player" as if you know what you're talking about? You're the new player here.
---
Shit, that’s all you had to say
---
When we getting these operators again??
---
I got a mini stroke when i read this
---
yeah but you cant transfer accounts anymore on GTA V
---
Judiging by normal release for the TS, it is either the coming Tuesday or the one afterwards...
---
I'm glad I could help
---
I don't think it would be that popular to be honest. But there is the Flex-Que on Faceit where you can pretty much do what you have in mind.
---
Irish operators!! Someone give award now!
---
It's just a bug.
---
Year 5 roadmap: "Data cap reached"
---
You can’t even see his eyes like you can with vigil
---
If the light blasts you just activate Warden’s ability
---
Amen
---
If you are toxic which i doubt don't do it un ranked cause then people Acctulay try and its mega difficult I'm level 105 was play 3 but should glitches took me down to silver 1
---
R6 good, shitnite bad
---
I get why it’s there for specific cams it’s just the effect I’m a bit disappointed in. Maybe they could’ve added a yellow wavy hue around the camera that gains this effect, as this fits with her character. This would look different but achieve the same purpose which would be better. 
---
I understand why they did it though
---
me too
---
This is like the opposite of stretched rez
---
Give the Swedish operator a Swedish name and not a Norwegian / Danish sounding name, please &lt;3
---
It happens every time I boot the game up. Oh well thanks anyway
---
Getting major mw3 vibes from a few of the maps
---
Yep
---
then why are you stating something that the post visualizes? like, the post is about that
---
you do have a point there
---
And it be better of they did
---
Earning your skins on pc after leaving the childhood console is a right of passage. It something like that
---
But the belts she’s carrying are only 100 bullets long. So no, she can’t hold more than 100
---
holy fuck man, especially with like a semi 😍😍😍😍😍
---
I think the point is another company has has launched this kind of feature successfully with little to no issue. Even if GTA has disabled it now, the fact it existed in the first place is the only proof you need. It doesn't take away from the point, and in the case of Siege, there couldn't be a way to exploit anything currency wise, due to the fact you can't earn R6, only purchase it.
---
Sad to not see a single comment saying this, but this isn't a Ubi thing. I had my PC die for a few months and swapped to PS4 and basically sent in a support ticket asking about just this, even as a temporary thing. It would violate their contracts with the consoles even if they wanted to do that. At the end of the day the consoles want their own cut too so they wouldn't let Ubisoft make their games purchases transfer cross platform.
---
SAME
---
Thanks for correcting. I were confused due to Kixstar stating in one of yesterdays matches that it is only 1.5 magnification.
---
I know about the 10m kill range average just thought it would be interesting with 1.5 magnification if it would have been real. Your idea is intruiging tough.
---
But how about the reverse, I have so much on PC , but got the game on PS4 after. I still bought season passes for both, but the PS4 account lacks in the skins and charms department, but also has some which I missed on PC. I still mainly play on PC, but it would be nice to see some unification.
---
Ya but then I'm jus playing John Flanders
---
but it's not W I D E
---
We are getting a defender who can see through smokes and cant be flash banged. You really dont think that will be game changing???
---
Te secabo big homo
---
Yesssssss plzzzzzzz ubi
---
r/gamingcirclejerk
---
Practice headshots and aiming at head level. I was terrible until I started actively trying to improve that. If you know the maps, start thinking about flanking routes that the other team can take at any point in the game. If you are with your team, watch those routes, I was surprised at how many times I’ve saved my team just doing that. Otherwise just practice as much as you can on learning good peeks and using them.
---
Just bought clash last week, can i get my renown refunded???
---
Those where some bad misses
---
#GiveTheLordAnAcog
---
oof, I live and breath this game, spent more time and money on it than I'd like to admit, I even know what ops the attacking team jabs brought based on a single bullet used to destroy a camera yet I'm still in fucking gold
---
Just like u/mistercage4 said, and you can do it with any shotty but bucks skeleton key is really good at destruction.
---
This is so dumb, quit spamming the subreddit with this shit
---
Me too. I keep pulling out my gadget
---
He should get an 16x scope
---
If there's anything I've picked up from watching the cycle of game companies for about a decade, they're trying to buy your goodwill and trust, so they can cash it in at an opportune time.
---
Appreciating good actions isn't wrong, but don't let that blind you to excusing bad behavior in the future. Don't become a fanboy.
---
This is more directed at everyone than you specifically, but your comment was a convenient springboard.
---
On his turret and be able to Walk around with it
---
Idk for me my performance depends on the map. That probably sounds like a dumb excuse but there’s just some maps I do really great on and maps I do terrible on. For aiming I suggest playing terrorist hunt at the highest difficulty. That’s what I did and I saw an improvement
---
Lower sens, practice aim in THunt/Casual, get surround sound headphones, lots of things. Hard to say what you are in need of doing. Could just be the other teams going from bad to good and throwing you off.
---
oh damn mate thats a real useful tips! my eyes wont bleed again from that controller! thanks
---
I think they should let you carry over old skins/uniforms that are no longer available such as pro league and the such. 
---
But stuff that's available still have to be earned. I caht see ubi doing it any other way as they'll be losing money that could be spent again
---
Thank you Ubi for, partially, fixing this annoying glitch. I can actually play ranked again now.
---
He just needs to put it on wheels and roll it around
---
Absolutely. I have console friends that want to play PC with me, but they don't want to migrate because they won't be able to keep all their skins. Cross-play isnt exactly an option for siege because PC players have an inherent advantage over console players, so I would really appreciate Ubi making the game's content transferable from platform to platform.
---
Why else?
---
My brain works as slow as steam haha
---
Yes
---
Supposed to be Need Flanders crossed woth James Bond
---
No.  He didn't.  Do I actually need to show you the freeze frame with his head knocked back?  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/o3gUmV3)
---
If you scrub through, you will clearly see 2 shots.  One that sprays blood that could potentially be a hand shot, another that knocks his head back.  Do hand shots also pop your head back like a pez dispenser?
---
Vigil if he was Mute
---
Hot as hades
---
Those run outs are easy to counter if you have an acog
---
I wish more accounts in games were, once or twice a year, transferable to another system.
---
Its totally possible and this is largely why I dont even try or bother to play Destiny 2 on PC. I started rainbow 6 on pc, but the amount of games I play that would benefit from this would be immense.
---
The only reason I didn’t start playing on pc. Didn’t want to spend another $200
---
let's riot in the streets of LA so we can have a Roof Koreans part 2
---
Actually this is possible. I’ve played matches on Xbox where people have a keyboard connected to their Xbox. I consider it cheating but the r6 devs don’t care
---
You bought The game for one system, so you cant complain to much for wanting to start play on a different system.
---
But, yes they could make it sonyou van get your skins and such.
---
GTA removed that feature almost a year ago due to people using exploits on one system and transferring to another.
---
Hmm interesting
---
I submitted this exact idea to both matimi0 and get_flanked but neither seemed interested
---
Put the Glacier skin in alpha packs as a legendary.
---
Rip old Hereford
---
aight
---
Great ideas, very creative. Shockwave is my personal favorite, I always though some sort of decoy sound gadget would be cool
---
Double oh diddily
---
At least you have a girlfriend who forces you to play ranked.
---
Perfect plan, horrible execution
---
I had all ops and everything for PS4, played since day 1 and when I switched to PC was completely deactivated to play because I have barely any operators. 
---
I understand why they say they're unable to cross the platform's progress, but seeing as UPlay works on the same account across platforms, I'd like to see it happen for game unlocks.
---
I really dig Klapstuk, but i think he should have an ability to run trough barricaded doors when he uses his ability.
---
So you are afraid to play ranked huh?
---
Or didn’t see. Fuze just saw a surface which he can use. I mean that simple for Fuze mains
---
Yup.
---
I would love this.
---
Why are there no mags?
---
No it's nok
---
My last season would have been Austria/Switzerland
---
The context behind this is in the first half of the PL Season they saved strats for the invitational.
---
Yeah you'd defintely need to buy the game again and the ranks should be reset. But everything else should stay.
---
I also agree but rather than getting free or discounted games, I’s rather just maintain the items I chose to buy on several consoles/pc
---
We can only hope.
---
I hadn't even realized haha
---
Level 59 on PC from PS4 rn. Sad bc I had like 6 black ices and 3 elites and all of that means nothing now even though cosmetics could be easily transferred.
---
None of the do except smoke. You can’t use chemical weapons. Interrogation isn’t a war crime. C4 is just a game mechanic
---
Yes because I'm planning to get a PC at some point in the future and I'd really like to keep all the stuff I've gotten over the years. Although I doubt Ubisoft will ever do that because there's a lot of money in it if they make you rebuy all the skins
---
Also ops. I don't want to spend money on r6 credit again
---
Flair checks out
---
I think lesion also cause his mines poison people
---
Well thanks very much!
---
OH NO SOME SIMILAR THINGS LOOK SIMILAR!??!!??!? WHAT????? but seriously, don't be fucking delusional. They even added in some new animations for the guns you fucking mouth breather, jesus lmfao. OH NO THEY GAVE US GUNS WE ALREADY HAD!!! THE SKY IS FALLING? People sound so fucking cringey in this sub lol.
---
Ubi would never release such a beauty without it being part of an event, and it would probably end up an epic and swapped with some dumb charm.
---
Don't we all
---
No lol that’s your bad
---
Looks ce
---
I got so much cool skins on ps4. Including a legendary warrior helmet charm that I never saw on other players weapons. It would be nice to get that and 3-4 black ice skins on my pc account.
---
Uplay has games for free quite often. I have 2 splinter cells, far cry 3 blood dragon, 2 assassin's creeds, steep, and more I've forgotten. All for free
---
But if they'd sell old seasonal skins (real money only), they'd have a lot more money. I would gladly paid for great seasonal skins prior to when I started playing game.
---
What I find most interesting is how you found the time to sit through the whole animation.
---
Caveira, to make her scarier than the new op again
---
manly gay niggas
---
True won’t be shocked to see G2 Win the Raleigh Major pretty easily only team that has a big chance is probably Empire.
---
Because cross platform is cheaper for the consumer. No one would take the hit to profits for  the good PR. 
---
I'm sure there is a team which decided that it would be better to just take the hit than miss out on millions
---
It would certainly need tweaking! I'm not a game designer but I can hope that Ubisoft likes some of these! Shield on him and Ballerina I would buy. Thanks for stopping by!
---
We don't talk about Fortress.
---
The dot is a bit big plus you can’t see through it like holo. Plus the casing covers a lot of your screen. Makes it bad for CQB fights. The only gun I might throw it on is frosts gun
---
Idk the use of the word ‘wasted’ kinda makes this post null and void ya get me.
---
nO iTs nØkK

Nah it’s more like a bet

---
I think it's easier said than done. There will 100% be some issues. Like sharing DLCs and other purchasable items. Someone will guaranteed find a way to duplicate using this.
---
I wanted to move away from digital tracking, with Alibi and Jackal and Lion and everything it feels like endless pings, would rather some more hands on gadgets that affect the player rather than just GPSs, you know?
---
what about pixel gun battle royale
---
I dont like it myself,i simply cant control the recoil
---
[deleted]
---
Hey it’s a team game
---
Wtf did i just watch
---
Lmao
---
I was talking about this like yesterday because i am going to pc in the near future and i messaged epi and obviously he won’t answer it was worth the shot
---
thats for transgender gay niggas
---
It'd be nice if OPs and cosmetics were shared on an account, but rank, level, K/D, and W/L were exclusive to their respective platform.
---
I understand the criticism, but I think NY offers something special with the SE and could be the first truly urban map. Outside of that, made Shockwave Irish for that reason and the NYPD is one of the most experienced CTUs in the world, I think they warrant a spot!
---
In my opinion, it's always better to adjust it as you go. I've gotten some sick plays because I heightened my sensitivity. Go bit by bit when rising it, like maybe .5 every week or something like that. And if that's too fast of a change, slow it down to .3 every week.
---
Wait about an hour
---
I can only dream. We got four with Year 1 after all!
---
Willing to take recommendations!
---
Thanks a ton!
---
My accounts not sharing progression is part of why I didn't hop over to PC yet. I'm 1000% in support of this.
---
this worked for me, i also changed the language to my home region in the uplay instaler, idk if that made any difference
---
Yeah but there are a lot of countries and they keep making Russians, Americans and British ops. 
---
Plus I'm salty I can't play an Italian in attack
---
*surprisedPikachu.jpeg*
---
I mean what about Lession he uses spikes and something toxic. Plus a solider only needs to name there rank name and platoon. Plus Fuze gadget I forgot the name of the explosive is not allowed in theater of war. Because it’s too random like in the game
---
When should I stop raising and should I have both horizontal and vertical equal?
---
I hope they poach a little haha, thanks very much! I used Gimp for everything!
---
Whipped
---
Pretty butthurt about it tbh.
---
A lot of bad air jab placements and some kill hungry enemies
---
I will say this though. The team probably didn't move on to GR, but you have to consider that its all but confirmed that new consoles are coming out next year. Maybe not a problem for PC, but that will be a loss in revenue as people move off their old consoles and stop buying crap for Siege. The team is most likely smaller than it was, as most were moved to work on the new title. Thus making them cut corners, otherwise it looks bad that a AAA studio can't work out a manageable workflow in 4 years. At least this is my hope.
---
Hey, my name is Rob and I like to ruin reddit threads
---
Agreed! I spent so much money on limited time skins on PS4 but moved to PC.
---
I mean in the general context of war and their gadgets.
---
Yes, all my own work, I have posted the Dutch and NYC ops before! Thank you for your concern though!
---
But why should the game die in the next couple years? It is just growing and games like cs go showed that it is possible.
---
At the moment they are working on fixing the game while still adding new content to keep the game alive. Or why do u think they reuse weapons don't make a new map, fix glaz, capitao, lion and the deployable shield?
---
Iam sure they do exactly what u want while still adding content to keep the community together and interested in the game
---
I agree with this. I feel like pushing for the 100 OP idea is only going to make the game stale instead of keeping it alive.
---
There isn't an option to pass accounts on GTA 5 .
---
I got an ace with just shield bashing yesterday
---
Haha well thanks very much! I tried to find a good balance between toggles, personals, and deployables (Shockwave, Maler, Spymaster)
---
Only in consoles
---
America is the only continent.
---
I don’t think the game will be “dead” in 7 years. Who knows maybe they will release a updated for next gen consoles. Plus look at how it started. Really low player count and pretty unknown. But they didn’t give up and it started growing a lot. I do agree they should take some time off to fix bugs, optimize some stuff, etc. Which I think they might do. Look at what they recently did. They disabled a OP ,claymores, and shields to stop a glitch. Something they had said before was not possible. They also made a section/blog where they will post all known issues and update the community on how they are fixing it. It shows Ubi is actually trying now to fix up the game and communicate a lot better with the community
---
Nice lol
---
Why is the SMG larger than John Wicks whole chest
---
She would definitely need some work! I just love the icon! Thanks a ton!
---
I mean ... its Ubi, cmon.
---
I just slowed it down and he definitely hit some shots right before he hit ash’s head. Idk how it wasn’t registering
---
What's about capitao it's also a gas and not just a fire bolt?
---
Yeah.
---
we'll see tonight
---
Lmao, only in Cas
---
When it's deleted but you still comment repost
---
How long did you watch for diamond?
---
You could, I don’t have him unlocked since I switched to pc so I don’t know how many he has currently but I’m not at all a fan of global abilities so I’d rather him be vaulted. Or be able to move his drone and scan a cone on the map that you could disable like we discussed
---
😂😂
---
LSE weren’t that bad tbh but they were 2-0’d
---
Hello Silent_Ech0, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bqizq9/my_idea_for_frendly_fire/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They said expect news Tuesday.
---
He has 3 quick ones that can't be stopped and ping the enemy if they move
---
I thought the 3rd was the last?
---
I coulda used this 4 years ago when I still remembered my xbox-live info lmao. RIP glacier bundle.
---
OW has a leaving penalty. Loss of ELO and scaling ban (if you leave too often it can be weeks and maybe even permanent)
---
When devs figure out how to fix her
---
The magazine looks like an SMG one, the gun looks like it’s based off a Sig Sauer MPX which is an SMG although that can is extremely out of proportion even if it was an AR
---
Most likely Capri sun packs that happened last year.
---
Maverick &amp; Valkyrie
---
When she stops being so *angry*
---
Why? You a clash main?? 😏😏😏 clash main, GLITCHER?!?!
---
Yeah I knew the ability didn’t know how many he had. You could go to 4. But again I would rather have him be where he is now. He was only meant for PvE
---
Yea i have a modded account with 300mil but if they keep releasing DLCs like that where buying everything costs 70mil+ I'm gonna have to start doing money glitches or something.
---
Yes because this Is what happened to me I only play r6 now because I have nothing on PC and dont want to waste the time to get two high level acounts
---
No peoblem. Only the castors of pro league i know check.
---
Dont know bout the rest of ubi
---
Makes you wonder how old this kids really are, if they've seen John Wick, unless this has a lower rating in the USA bc. where I live it's 18
---
This will not happen for sure because of the size of the community and the mass amount of profit they will make because of that. Maybe if we had a community the size of smite a year ago maybe?
---
How dare you disrespect the king, this is blasphemy I say!
---
People will start selling accounts and people with get scam
---
I get that.
---
What i meant by it was just that the video has subtitles. 
---
It's my first video i ever made so i'm okey with you criticizing the video as long as you keep that in mind.
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
Then don't buy 2 copies of the game? I swear some of you just expect ubi to give out free stuff for no reason whatsoever.
---
Lesion Defense, zofia offence. Lesion is more beneficial the longer he survives, zofia can do the job of buck, ash, and sledge, but also has concussions to find out if someone’s in a room (I rarely use concussions honestly)
---
Instead of making new guns, Ubisoft just recycled ones that already existed, added some animations and 2 new animations and then called it a day.
---
I don't understand the point you're trying to make.
---
If it means I can get my plasma pink back, I may start playing again.
---
My fab part is he only edited to Gold 1😂😂😂
---
Unfortunately, they aren't :/
---
I'd moved from console to pc. I didn't have my seasonal skins since they're limited... so that's my reason
---
They are skins. And they were seasonal.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Ye this week was probably correct at the time it was released, but devs are always testing and changing ops, and over the course of a whole season, they drastically changed the weapons and some of the abilities
---
True but there’s the strong chance that they could be the first big company to realize that if they start being consistently consumer-friendly, making awesome games, and not being total shitbags, there’s a bigger chance of making more money in the end since everyone will support them. For Honor is one of my favorite games ever, I really am starting to love Siege, *and* The Division 2 is god-damn killer. 
---
I would happily continue supporting Ubi for their work on For Honor alone; the rest is just a bonus. But either way they have a strong customer in me, and I hope to god they see the best path is to keep the fans happy so the fans are more willing to sink cash into their games. FH and Siege are the only games in the last 2 years that I’ve bought season passes for, for a reason.
---
Mate, its classified as an assault rifle in the game.
---
&gt; extremely out of proportion even if it was an AR
---
Are... are you new to fortnite?
---
Thats kinda the purpose of the art style.  disproportionate angles makes the style look cartoony.
---
Thats why the Scar has a tappering barrel.
---
Any more information?
---
Honestly, that's probs why I got downvoted
---
Yeah, if Ubisoft at least grabbed a pre-existing gun *and also* gave it a bit of spice, like what they did with Gridlock's M249, then the new weapons would be *somewhat* interesting.
---
Preach
---
Yes or something like schiphol would be awesome as well!
---
Was the team kill really necessary?
---
Definitely!
---
the vz61 is a nice machine pistol, wish it was available in the game
---
Really hope this is a standard for every game next gen, given Windows play-anywhere between Xbox and PC continues to grow.
---
No prob, have fun and don’t quit, you and your friends will get better.
---
Wtf is wrong with your eyes?
---
Omg yes and operators aswell so basically linking accounts between then
---
TBH though it bugs me sometimes that they add more into the realm of sci-fi when there's some really good suggestions here and there.
---
I know a few people who've been waiting for a shield that can charge through a wall since release lol
---
Should be an alpha pack legendary
---
Really like the idea of the last defender, there are so many ops that can poke holes in reinforced walls, it would be good to have someone who could plug them back up. 
---
If it works like Mav’s torch like you’ve said in previous comments, the defender could probably plug a thermite hole but it would use a majority of the reserves, and plugging a hibana hole would cost maybe one tank to fill completely.
---
No
---
Yeah no you dont
---
Hibana and Valkyrie :)
---
Yep! Would definitely be highly situational but I think it could lend itself to some cool counterplay! Thanks for your comment, I appreciate it!
---
And it's so fucking stupid. A normal day for Fortnite having 10k fewer viewers than Siege during a final... That reflects better on Fortnite than Siege.
---
Yeah still think Ash should get banned from the game entirely.
---
Maybe take the perspective that it's just a game, and having fun is the most important!
---
Fool around, try different weapons, different strategies, etc.
---
Find good friends and ignore the toxic players!
---
which is such a shame, the weapons in the leak would've been so cool to see, who doesn't want the galil in the game!  
---
and everyone was also excited for that ksg
---
Good pick!I love them,and I choose them constantly
---
They probably gave nokk terrible weapons cus the devs might think she’s gonna be pretty op, a silent attacker that basically hunts the defenders
---
so does it for us all
---
It's denser because there's stuff there you fucking nonce. You have no clue what that software does lol.
---
Sure seems like it, I actually think warden might be pretty good with that gadget, completely negates smoke/ying pushes

It literally surpasses it everyday of every hour lmao
---
**Hello realpbc, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
Not so much the fact that it is a SMG but the one they picked.
---
I'm honestly surprised anyone paid for a season pass after prerework lion went live and stayed that way for a year.
---
Giving her an underwhelming gun makes sense because her gadget is very strong.
---
However, giving Warden an underwhelming gun when he's already slow *and* his gadget is very underwhelming and situational (and requires you to stand still to use effectively...) is a really bad decision, IMHO.
---
the girl?
---
Thing is, if they wanted her to have stealthy guns, there’s literally a suppressed smg they could’ve given her
---
If he goes against anyone but glaz he is game and meta changing. People really need to get over the gun thing. It’s one of the dumber things I’ve seen people on this sub complain about
---
**Hello Hossbaby, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
Exactly
---
we knew that
---
I can see it in pro league to counter specifically Ying. But the disadvantage of having to stay stationary for the Smoke is absolutely massive. Also remember that Glaz will get basically removed from Pro League with his rework anyways (probably)
---

**Hello VersatileR6, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**

Same :(
---
Did you really think they were going to add in the 100+ ops they strive for and give them all unique weapons? All the while keeping everything balanced? I think this is more a YOU issue
---
Any news about the seasonal uniforms and headgears yet? I hope they're dark blue
---
It's also unique to Jackal.
---
Why?
---
**Hello ithrewmyselfnow, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
Meh
---
Is wardens speed and armour undecided or is it just not there?
---
r/decreasinglyverbose
---
Yepp
---
You are missing my point.  
---
As I said, Warden might see play or not, I don't really care: underpowered stuff is fine.  
---
But this is wholly recycled all the way. Especially the weapons
---
So no new map ?
---
Its live in coreross's channel
---
Keeps it fresh and interesting.
---
maybe in 3 weeks at season release they release the new elite to be bought
---
Nokk is from the Danish frogmen
---
Cringe fest
---
Will there be a sale?
---
This so much, idgaf if it's a SMG, just not a recycled one lol
---
It would be sick af. And if we cant get john wick at least we got a sick ass new operator idea
---
Bruh Nokk is basically [an scp article](http://prntscr.com/nqlx8r)
---
As they should be.
---
yea lol she's asking some really wierd questions and not as a desk host
---
Yes please
---
He's a 3 armor
---
**Hello TeJay02050205, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
I really wanted new weapons.
---
Has it been working out?
---
With an ar, not only with the worst shotgun in this game
---
Smoke plants will still be a thing. As I said, low ranks who only think about things 1 dimensionally
---
im so happy the devs actually listens to the community! loving the kafe buff! well done!!
---

---
I think she's fine. 
---
Justin was cringey. He just had a good rep with the community so everyone gave him slack.
---
You should also be allowed to keep unlocked operators that you got by farming renown. That's a lot of work wasted for those of us who can't/don't buy the pass
---
I entirely agree, Warden has nothing pretty much nothing going for him when compared to Jager, who can help the entire team against flashbangs, instead of just himself.
---
**Hello is0para, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
Operation: Reuse weapons and mechanics that are already in the game
---
He is 1 speed, 3 armor, it was shown in the reveal.
---
Ubi isn't Activision or EA. They're better than that
---
So I  , a paying customer , get "punished" ? So far you could always "count" on new operators having fresh loadouts. 
---
Also I think on the panel (awful panel btw , I watched it to get confirmation of my "biggest fear" and not to listen to people guess who "nokk really is" and what not..sure it might make for interesting character background info but I thought the Panel was for the "Meat and Potatos") they've said that these are the "first comissioned" Operators ? Which would explain the complete asset reuse...its a shame tho.Really dissapointed.
---
 PREACH
---
So if a new gun comes out with the same stats as an old gun that’s better? You are essentially complaining about not getting a new skin
---
I think its because most lower ranks don't really know how to effectively use gadgets, so they rely on fragging out which means they rely on the guns
---
Hey, he at least has new weapons. There is creative effort there!
---
Actually, with how many weapons there are in the world, yes I did expect them to give us unique weapons for each of the operators. At the very least, I didn't think they'd just start recycling weapons this fast.
---
My only issue with adding an extra mine is the time. Getting 2 reinforcements up, getting armor AND putting up 6 mines not in the same area is nearly impossible
---
[Probably not the best clip to use for setting up a rotation.](https://clips.twitch.tv/SilkyFastToadTheThing)
---
the only thing i think of when i see this is:
---
im a barbie girl, in barbie world. life in plastic, its fantastic
---
I can see that. Most of them don’t know how to use utility effectively at all. New guns are cool and all but hardly necessary to new ops.
---
Don't worry guys, the weapons are just placeholders *wink*
---
SMG12 getting angled grip?
---
Map rework happens long time ago. Your comments aren't that valid
---
We all did, even one weapon per op would be nice like lion and finka
---
**Hello PixelSpaceShip, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**

And Operators. And Money.
---
**Hello Fzkraken, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
Yes, why not? They have kept it until 40's, why couldn't they keep it up to 100 ops? If it's the data problems, just delete old, under appreciated maps like favela and bartlett.

---
Please stay on the fucking topic. Jesus fuck
---
Boring reused gadgets, boring reused weapons. Strength is not even a factor when measuring how fun or exciting content is for most people, and your comment is insanely condescending. Grow up and learn to accept others opinions instead of looking down on them.
---
Okay what is vigil better than nokk at? Nothing. They just mixed 2 operators from defense and made it 2 times better on attack.
---
**Hello Asiimov_Orion, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
&gt; Thing that players only benefit from.

About as stupid as every petition ever made.
---
"Its just skins" yeah and all the dlc ops that i have to rebuy
---
YES I JUST SWITCHED AND IT SUCKS!!!
---
And they will lose my money because I‘m not going to spend any on buying Operators after switching to PC and am not going to financially support them anymore.
---
This season had my hyped with the really cool designs, but everything else after that has just been disappointing, the abilities are just amalgamations of other abilities, and dont even get me started on the re-used guns, thats the worst part hands down
---
This is basically what I was typing just now. A 5 stack really helps (especially if its always the same people so you know how everyone plays). Warming up does help, as well as just every now and then taking a break :)
---
**Hello BlackFalconJ, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**

not everything is circle jerk mate
---
**Hello XeRoXayuki, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
You could use that same logic literally every time they add weapons until the game becomes unbalanced. Inherently it has to happen.
---
These hosts are terrible. Master the language dudes. Zero chemistry.
---
So Nokk is pretty much a Vigil in attack  
---
And Warden is pretty much a Glaz in defense  
---
No new loadouts  
---
What is happening?  
---
Also the reveal was so cringy...
---
Can't have fun when you're shots don't count for shit. " Oh you got a head shot? Jk you missed!
---
I totally agree with you, they could have just reskinned the weapons and give some sights differences or recoils like they did on spear .308 for finka and g36c.
---
Ah shit
---
I wouldn't worry to much. This seems similar ti when lion and finka came out. Ubi introduced a new concept to the game. The community showed that that was not the direction to go down and ubi went a different direction. 
---
There is more reason to believe this will not be the norm imo.
---
Literally neeko and zyra is the only one I've heard in the last year, and they play plenty different.
---
Exactly!
---
Proof?’
---
Please remove yourself from society if this is your way of thinking. Thank you.
---
I moved on to Hunt: Showdown.
---
Take a look at the Discussion tread, people are raging "Give them Acog" 
---
"Give Warden MP5" 
---
"I'm okay with gun reuse but why this shitty gun!!"
---
Are they not doing map buffs anymore?
---
I already made two comments clarifying the existence of prior event skins amongst the possiblity of why it will be tied to summer packs.
---
What makes you say that? I’m genuinely curious.
---
Of course but like what would be a cool thing in your opinion
---
They already made they're money at that point they're double dipping and being greedy call it what it is.
---
Strike force looks good.
---
Agreed, she did pretty well. I liked how she made questions about countering new Operators by putting herself into a Blitz, Glaz etc. main.
---
I was joking. Can't blame you though. Sarcasm isn't easy to detect online
---
So you'd rather have less map and variation? You'd rather just play the same shit over and over and over and over and over. AND ONLY BOMB! Jesus, what the fuck is Ubishit thinking. Soon we will only have 1 map and 5 operators on each side, "because that is the optimal approach and everything is balanced".
---
That isn't evidence. That's taking your word as factual
---
Imma need more renown.
---
i get your point but it would have still been nice to get a new gun that may be statistically identical to existing SMGs but just looks different. in my eyes, just reusing existing guns is extremely lazy and heavily devalues the Y4 pass overall
---
No1 promised you new guns my dude. Get over yourself
---
I had a lot of emotional trouble upgrading to pc and letting my blue nebula skin go.
---
They are so underwhelming and dissapointing at the same time. The only good skin we ever got was Grim Sky's Spitfire skin with Hereford, planes and amazing colour combination. Yet here we get into some minimalistic bullshit.
---
Yea
---
OH OK SORRY FOR UNDERSTANDING YOU WRONGLY. YES MY COUNTRY IS COMPLETELY BULLSHIT.
---
If you want to find people quick the discord could work
---
I use it to see who is left even though I could just look at the top of the screen, it’s just a habit
---
I like the idea of Warden but I’m just not a fan of Nøkk, seems a bit of a lazy character idea for me, and I feel like she’s gonna be OP at first.
---
I mean, you bought it on the Xbox. Why should you get it on PC?
---
What do you mean by LGBT friendly? Should they not make gay jokes or what?
---
I think that is an early logo design for Nokk, if you look closely it is like two glowing eyes behind a something like a curtain, which is exactly how Nokk's theme looks like.
---
I think they look cool. No sweat off the backs for the people like me who think these look cool and paid extra to support the developers.
---
Wasted.. this skin is perfect for our lovely spanish friend Jackal
---
\+1
---
Good. Crutch operators have no place in Siege.
---
Lol maybe the arms but those legs are straight fat.
---
So they're not leaked
---
You're right, many wouldn't buy it. My earlier point is wrong to an extent, as the sales from the season pass do go into funding development. But I do think my point still stands to an extent. Those who pay for the season pass make an investment based on the hope to get something they want, but they don't know what it is in advance, so unexpected disappointments are absolutely possible. I don't think that it's wrong to complain, a lot of people are disappointed by the lack of new guns, but the fact that people refuse to just accept that they PAID for something unknown and were disappointed when everything came to light is really frustrating to me.
---
Why throw the EMP as the thermite charge is going off?
---
In everyone's behalf, please commit suicide
---
At the very least, they know they won’t be breaking the game balance with these weapons. So in the long term, it won’t be an over powered gun that makes these operators OP. I prefer game balance to possible new guns that break said balance. ‘Cough cough’ Ela ‘cough cough’.
---
Again they don't play off the same rule set. Lion doesn't make it where you have to perform an animation to move. Warden doesn't have to set up in awkward places to use his gadget. Stop jamming things together to fit a narrative you're making.
---
Yeah you lost me
---
Lmao asking for a bit of realism is that horrible?
---
Blue-painted tinfoil with hotglue over it?

I wish the board park tricks weren't just click and it auto does it .  It's like timing doesn't even matter... But traversing the slopes is fun

Damn the things people do on reddit for karma. I seen and upvoted that post too. Thanks for exposing these fraudulent redditors!
---
If in her “lore” she’s muscular, that’s one thing, but her playermodel is that of a cow. The playermodel itself is literally fat, not muscular. Valkyrie is muscular, Gridlock is not.
---
The fact that I put a question mark in the title proves that I am not 100% sure but I can however make it clear that the points you made are invalid. If you want to be arsey do it elsewhere. Thanks :)
---
I miss my pink plasma :(
---
genius absolute legend
---
Just wondering how you put your main op next to your name? (New here) and a zofia main
---
Yeah but Ubisoft most likey won't do that, because that may cause others to want them on there games too.
---
she doesnt need it
---
He didn’t come together at the end.
---
Good place for it if he can reach that far. It’s like how people put swords on their back but it’s a knife.
---
I think alibi's shotty is the best one to use for this simply because of the fire rate and reload speed. At least that's what I've tested.
---
i didnt buy the Y4 pass and now i am very glad i didn't. reusing existing guns does not cut it for me -- not to mention, we only get a map rework, not even a new one this season
---
He *hoped* they were placeholders
---
Yeah that would be nice I bought every pro league skin since op velvet shell and had a few nice universal skins on PS4 and I kinda miss them on PC
---
Maybe I’m old school, but if you got the skins and camos on console, why do you think you should be able to transfer it till PC? It’s two different things.
---
Secure is my favorite mode so this game is dead to me if ranked is seriously bomb only.
---
Pacific rim
---
Yeah
---
Yeah cause they released like 3 champs last year lmao.
---
Darius: Just a reused Garen, Riot is running out of ideas!!

And so on and so on. People are constantly trying to create some sort of "issue" that isnt there cause they like complaining. Thats why theyre usually not taken seriously.
---
Jaegers ? Lol
---
Those seasonal skins look so bland. Not worth 27000 credits
---
I was just asking this yesterday but it wouldn’t let me post for some reason lol but I definitely agree. Only reason why I don’t play Frost is because I hate red dot and reflex
---
Barbed wire is way more valuable than clash
---
That’s perfect placement. For cqc.
---
Yeah, the most competive mode.
---
On behalf of the subreddit rules, get your comment removed.
---
Did anybody get the diamond one yet?
---
I bought it which is why am more annoyed that I should be since I paid money, definitely gonna skip this season if they don't give a good reason, and will probably not buy any more season passes.
---
I have enough Renown to buy every operator for about 3 years and can happily wait a month to play the new operators if 1/2 of their promised gameplay content isnt included.
---
Where are the shorts disgusting
---
muh black ice
---
Fairs
---
I’m glad I’m plat lol it’s looks cool
---
No the pilots. They have like the same suit as lesion
---
I don't get it
---
Yeah, Canada's got huge mountains and wild nature a wildlife hunter'd thrive in, right ?
---
I mean, what kind of representation do you think would fit ?
---
Fuck that. The super competitive crowd is like 5-10%, I don't know why Ubishit keeps listening to them only. Most people, like me, play Ranked because we like the ranking system and want to feel some kind of progress. There's nothing in casual. 
---
This culling of ranked is so retarded. All kinds of randomizers are being removed, only the most optimal approaches are allowed. It's retarded, but I guess it represents current society very well, where everyone expects to have absolute control over everything. I expect soon there will be 1 optimal map and 5 optimal operators on each side left, and the 5-10% crowd will be ecstatic because the gameplay is so optimal and competitive.
---
Yeah I know
---
His name is deathrice
---
On behalf of Reddit, please get your account deleted
---
Are you kidding me? You're not even gold, you don't play ranked and you're talking about balancing? Why? Know your place, please.
---
I forgot about them. I just said Jaeger because, y'know...Jaeger.
---
I haven't done this but I fully support this on ALL games not just this one. I know because I want my bf4 progress to carry over to PC I really don't see why that shouldn't be allowed.
---
Proof?
---
Guess I win then :D
---
when are they giving us the the yr3 season pack?
---
He could definitely sue if they were using his likeness without his consent, but there is a whole cross promotion with Fortnite x John Wick 3 including ads and in-game content, so he is definitely getting paid for this.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
How many people still play for honor I’m just wondering
---
Every time you die, do five push-ups.
---
No he doesn't need it and slapping an ACOG into someone's loadout doesn't automatically make them a better op. People put way to much weight on having a 2x zoom.
---
Werent you the same one telling me to go outside?
---
they changed the standoff stiuation. if players wait too long, the round goes tie. but in all the time i played siege since year 1, i encountered only a handfull of rounds, where ppl took their time in such a situation.
---
having a smaller area to defend, just concentrates certain frontlines, but in all honesty, they dont differ to much from bomb.
---
as i mentioned, i know all maps are designed with bomb in mind, that goes hand-in-hand with the operators. castle is in my opinion not as viable in secure area as he is in bomb. but im okay with that. skip such an operator and pick someone else, the choice is big enough. especially nowadays
---
Imo Kaid. With the new ban system being introduced, if Bandit gets banned, he will be even more valuable.
---
He is not a good fragger but he brings so much utility to the team.
---
Valkyrie is also 12500 i believe instead of the 25k of Kaid.
---
highly doubt but you can never know lol.
---
I think it's a valid question since Nokk has a claymores and Warden has a shield.
---
Likely a new round of summer packs. There's an ice cream cone universal weapon skin and well that was leaked.
---
Yes?
---
Thanks, good eye! Definitely gonna get it, usually Ubisoft takes their sweet time on nice customisations for new characters.
---
Go outside
---
Lacks an acog and the MPX is the worst of the 3 armor weapons. Because of that I can't see him being used except for the forementioned scenario
---
I seem to remember there was a leak that suggested a nuclear event backed up by the outback map lore because it's about a nuclear convoy being hijacked
---
Please for all games!!!!
---
Well why going inside then
---
Heresy.
---
This is so funny. They should put it in the game.
---
yeah I put over 200 levels into xbox and then switched to PC and had nothing :(
---
No, don't do that. I don't belong in PC ranked yet even though I was [slightly above average] on Xbox.
---
Keeps the heat out.
---
Or at least a heavy discount!!
---
Yes, but when we are back to on/off. So players that really care about this stuff, could play in bomb. And we other could still have fun in the other gamemodes. Still. not a good argument for removed the other gamemodes in total. Just really sad about it.
---
OMG yes!! Poll!!!
---
Ops seem fun. But the weapons make me wanna cry.
---
If they take away Secure and Hostage, my Siege disk will be up for sale on OfferUp right away.
---
They feel kind of lazy tbh.....
---
Because?
---
Rainbow Sims Six
---
Call it Lord Outbreak and turn it into a meme like tachanka
---
Can we stop pretending that an acog is nessasary for everyone? I mean we thought Vigil was going to be bad
---

Confusion?
---
Where the hell did u get 40 euros from
---
No news weapons...  No problem i dont have lesion ying clash or valkyre so basically...
---
I mean they could have simply given her mp5sd with acog unavailable (make it a variation or whatever)  for her, its not really a good argument that it has acog.
---
I would love this so much just skins and charms cause I had so many on Xbox, the rest of the stats or renown I don’t really give a dam about I just want my cosmetics
---
Got em
---
I quit that game once they launched the new clan. I couldn't take it anymore.
---
would you rather having new shitty guns or having already existing good guns?
---
You forgot to mention that Casuall MM system is broken too. Why i am supposed to play against Diamond player when i am Gold???? Or at least, why there is no Diamond player in my team to balance it?
---
An ACOG wont help the peashooter that is the MPX
---
Cool birds
---
Vigil isn't a 1 speed and his weapon isn't the MPX
---
These games are always fun
---
You feel bullet proof
---
Good job dood
---
I agree with the OP.
---
I have been fairly disappointed in the lack of night vision  skins in the game (only one i can think of is Blackbeard’s that looks like a phoropter)... Hope they it for other ops!
---
Vigul doesn't have a slick looking suit and rad shades
---
I mean just right away, you can literally look at the Wikipedia entry for what weapons the jægerkorpset use. Don't need Danish-manufactured weapons.
---
Alibi and Vigil, Ash and Twitch
---
Plus what about if people don’t like Dining as a bomb site. That’s 2/4 sites meaning your forced to play Dining at least once if a you don’t win every round. 
---
But frustrating but ultimately a small irritation that could be fine. Bit petty but it confused me
---
r6 can be very toxic at times. I recommend playing with atleast 1 friend so you cant get kicked (unless that friend is an asshole)
---
You never know
---
Vigil: I don't use recycled weapons though
---
Just fix the dumb fucking facial expressions she makes when she kills you. That pisses me off so much for some reason.
---
There was the option to in the matchmaking preferences. It never worked though.
---
At least you don’t have to unlock the original operators again because of the switch. Rip me
---
Prolly like a smaller battlefield
---
Seasonal skins Are never worth getting anymore.
---
If only Dining is found it'll change how your team attacks if you can't figure out what the second point is. When bomb sites are unique there's no chance of a teammate thinking they have to attack Mining when it's actually Reading
---
This ain’t cod buddy no sniper with 99damage lol
---
I just wanna have fun in a game
---
Oh shit!
---
Btw the new ops ability’s counter the meta right now so it is good
---
Allegedly one of the considerations for the devs is game file size: they don't want Siege to turn into a 100 Gb game too soon (i.e. before they cana dd more operators).
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK

---
What happened?
---
I just bought the pass, it was on deal. Like £25ish and unlocked all season passes. Otherwise I would not have even bought the standard edition
---
yea man, the announcement was just a bait and switch. Once they finally release the update, it will surprise everyone with new weapons and unique operator abilities and it will shock everyone amirite?
---
I'd prefer them to focus on cross platform progression for their single player and coop games personally. Having to complete Wildlands on 2 platforms with 2 groups of friends and doing it all twice was a ballache.
---
Same way I wanna go between my Xbox and PC when playing things like FC5 etc.
---
Skins from other platforms would be nice don't get me wrong, but I'd prefer other stuff first!
---
An acog would fit his playstyle though. He is meant to play as an anchor as mentioned above and hold angles since the thermal doesn't work while moving (according to leaks). We will just have to see in tts.
---
Bingo
---
They should give Warden an SR-16 rifle (that Secret Service teams use).  Pretty much a slower but more steady version of Jager's gun.
---
That way, it makes him the "Anti-Vigil" in that he can anchor the room with a powerful rifle.
---
Nice going!
---
Solution: Don't spend your money on skins
---
As much as I wished this was accurate but someone like Tfue gets like 100k viewers just by himself when he’s streaming a tournament, that would be more comparable to R6S having an event like Milan.
---
I like the idea, but it's more likely that she'll be a member of [Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsvarets_Spesialkommando) than Beredskapstroppen, even though it is more R6 lore.
---
I was thinking the same thing, a basically 1 tap defender sniper would break the game.
---
You never know they could change it
---
"broken hitbox" how is it broken? This video looks perfectly fine and you can see that the hitbox wasn't hit
---
F.
---
It should be brought back in custom games at least.
---
Can we get Black Ice?  
---
We have Black Ice at home
---
Black Ice at home:
---
I'm so sad I missed it... Bought the game November or December of 2017 then quit because I was trash and started playing again at the very end of chimera
---
I’ve got a follow up question. I recently purchased rainbow for PC, previously playin on console. And I’ve noticed that fairly large portion(if it a majority) of people i queue with are also transfers from console. Is there any reason why such a vast amount of the player base is switching platforms?
---
For defense; Doc, Jäger, and Vigil.
---
For attack; Ash, Nomad, Sledge (maybe)
---
This is just my opinion, correct me if I’m wrong
---
NGL the copper charm looks kinda nice
---
Is it me or do the seasonal skins always look underwhelming? I never feel the need to spend 27k renown on them :\
---
Well damn. Your right
---
**lowers glasses**
---
That's a disconnect
---
S2 end
---
Did you read the post?
---
Then play with a team if you want to play at the higher ranks after the change. Casual still exists for those that want to be able to one man army it in secure area.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Hell yeah we should u have no idea how much money was spent on my console
---
Finally some decent content with this new season.

Yoy guys serious sound like children saying  "if they can't play without cheating they can't play at all" this isn't elementary school. It's a glitch and that's all, and it's temporarily solved now.
---
You shouldn’t have to go through support for a report. They need to change that.
---
&gt; It is impossible to control and defend if you are not playing with a team. 
---
Exactly, that's what I already commented in this thread. Game doesn't give a single flying fuck if you are playing with 2 braindead kids against a full premade, and Bomb gamemode is a perfect choice only for PL where interaction is trained 16 hours a day.
---
Realistically if you mean it is dangerous considering others can grab it it doesn't matter as if someone is that close next to you(BEHIND YOU) you are pretty much dead anyway😂 but considering Lesion's using it I hope he did gymnastics wh n he was younger
---
for cosmetics yeah, level and rank should be unique
---
Alright, whoever replaces Warden's black suit is seriously fucked in the head.
---
I couldn't care less why theyre giving them away. I'd only created my uplay for siege anyway, so if they want to give me free games why would I not add them to my library?
---
The Swedes surname sounds more Norwegian than Swedish. What are the lore implications of this?!?!
---
I like how he edited his rank and increased his renown too
---
 Lmao
---
Apparently you are blind if you think these shots hit
---
Warden looks just like Jim Gordon from The Dark Knight trilogy.
---
Won’t happen all Ubi cares about is money
---
I think it's similar to the issue with Jäger's earmuffs, they're part of his head, but not part of his hitbox, the Warden was moving as the bullet was fired so i'm sure it only just missed an actual headshot by millimeters
---
And Warden only has two primary choices, so they still could have given it to him as an option as well as Nokk.
---
61.6GB tho
---
Nøkk’s headgear looks like she has a sack over her head.
---
FMG-9 and MP5K do not have identical recoil stats.
---
I think this season is fine, though I agree the weapon choices are weird. Nøkk not having an AR or LMG is fair considering her INSANE utility - she’s also unable to move quickly if she wishes to remain undetected, and almost any instance of damage or slowdown also distorts her camouflage and makes her stand out on cams. Pair that with her 2/2 status, and she’s a great counter to roamers and a great flanker but is NOT designed to be standing on the front lines. Imagine giving her a high firepower AR with an ACOG? People would be SCREAMING for a nerf within a week.
---
Warden’s also still unable to contest Glaz in smoke because he has to first move INTO the smoke, then allow his gadget to stabilize - whereas Glaz will (read: should) already be on that angle and able to clip Warden as he peaks and waits for proper vision. The only thing Warden will be REALLY good at is holding off a singular push or a last minute plant, he doesn’t stand out as the BEST operator, and neither does Nøkk - they sound well balanced and curated to a certain role, whereas many operators in the past have been very well rounded or too powerful.
---
You’re right in that they don’t sound INCREDIBLE, because every operator who has sounded incredible in the past has been incredibly overpowered. This is a GOOD thing and won’t completely rule the meta.
---
Thank you! Spent half an hour doing my hair!
---
It seems like this season is still going to be good. It’s going to change the meta. Although I don’t really see much use for warden I think nokk is going to be game changing
---
Siege needed to slow down a bit. We've gone from "This new operator has an attached shotgun for soft breaching" to "THIS OPERATOR HAS HOLOGRAMS OF HERSELF"..
---
Sometimes old is good.
---
You're not adding the update bringing it to 128GB.
---
In order for it to be done intentionally someone has to figure out how to do it in the first place, nobody just decided that there would be a deployable sheild bug and they woud find it they were just fucking around and happened to find out there was a bug, what people do with that knoweldge afterwords is entirely irrelevant; my point is that it IS possible to do a bug accidentally.
---
At
---
By having the fuzz only appear when it’s a few feet away would be literally the complete opposite of hiding him better. It’d be “oh shit I can’t see him but I know he’s directly on top of my drone.” That’s not counter intelligence, at all. It would require the complete opposite. If you see the fuzz, he’s within 100 feet of the drone. Then you just know his general area, but no clue on which room or floor.
---
&gt;I'd only created my uplay for siege anyway, so if they want to give me free games why would I not add them to my library?
---
No reason not to. That's not what I'm saying. But you just explained yourself why this is a marketing tactic and not a generous offer. One that worked pretty well, I might add.
---
Not saying you're in the wrong or anything. I just think it's smart to be aware of these kinds of things as a consumer
---
I’ve heard people saying she’s gonna be underpowered, we will see what happens.
---
There is that option??

I dont play on consoles or with randos lol
---
I sincerely doubt the next update us going to double+ the size of the game.
---
Really depends on your play style. Nokk would be most useful hunting down roamers or sneaking to an area without any problems with intel knowing where you are.
---
Spent 0 dollars on anything except the base game for 7
---
Epic Games announced couple months ago that they’re willing to give away their coding or program (whatever they used) to transfer all of your progression and purchases to different platforms for free. So I would assume it’s ok for Sony and Microsoft.

Yeah

# Nøkk

De buff coming in 1 month

Then your point is invalid.
---
Is this the first season to have rewards?

Let’s be real what time was this lol  shitnite had like 300k yesterday

I still don’t get why the Nøkk has the Fmg-9. The gun was specifically designed to be used by the secret service.

Where's the official source? Like another source than "u\\ said that they did"?

How much r6 credits are the new operators going to be
---
I've watched both times Fabian was on Pro and the Potato. Doesn't change my point of 1: He admitted in a pro league interview they had just been playing bad. 2: You can tell they were just playing bad because they'd lose easy 1v1s and mess up basic stuff that every pro team does (you're not "hiding" anything when you drone someone in). 3: Every caster knows this was the case to a certain degree. They watch G2 play all the time, they're not obvious to the difference between not doing anything creative and just losing a ton of 1v1s that they should be winning (like a Blackbeard rappelled on Consulate).
---
Thank god. I hope they don’t. I like playing 14 maps.
---
Whatever happened to Jagers splinter cell skin?
---
They do that with a lot of their games. Assassin Creed leaks happen A LOT.
---
She won't read this because you spelt her username wrong.
---
It's "UbiNoty" with a single T
---
Warden with an Acog seems extremely powerful. He would be able to hold tight angles or long angles, or both, and see through smoke.
---
Oh wow, this would be amazing. Great how Splinter Cell is also a thing in this universe too, could make for interesting mozzie backstory
---
Probably y4s3 but I'm just guessing
---
username checks out
---
seriously though the people doing the demos are slightly sped sometimes
---
A couple new guns is definitely not going to hit data limits. Ffs the rework of the map has got to be more data.
---
It took them 3 years and a half to release a ban system and an interface to the ranked. Honestly they could've done both.
---
Wtf is that John Wick?
---
Just add more batteries lol
---
Operators are $5 USD a piece, and the year pass (8 operators plus skins) is $30.
---
But the Wick collab doesnt, it breaks character
---
worst skins ever
---
Will Microsoft is willing to do it with PC. If Ubi did it for Xbox and PC. Sony would be under pressure.
---
Yacht is beyond repair. Definitely excited about Kanal though.
---
guys, a ubisoft dev said that nøkk had an AR early in development, but it was removed bc too OP.
---
where is it written down from any dev that claims, secure area isnt competitive?
---
where did i say, i dislike bomb? to clarify: bomb is a great gamemode, but i dislike that they are forcing me into this gamemode, once i want to play ranked matches. going 5-stack into bomb is a great experience in it self, regardless of winning or losing. at a 5-stack, its always fun. im talking of the typical dickhead random teammates u will encounter when entering a match not having a fullstack. those guys, ruining strategies and forcing you, to iron out their mess they leave behind. 
---
by having secure are into the mix, you are not forced to this
---
that is the only complain i have
---
See? You are trying to enforce what *you* like on other players and think it's totally fine.
---
I am not interested in casual since it's a leave/join shitfest of toxicity, it lacks objective choice and people treat it like it's training mode (which it is).
---
I don't have 16 hours a day to look for decent (not just in terms of skills but also human interaction) team and train with it to reach some kind of synergy.
---
I don't want my game be a second job for me where I don't have a right to do a slight little mistake without impacting whole round just because some autists in PL are doing that.
---
Really, just make another matchmaking type for all PL worshippers so other people could play something like Tower without whiners who can't adapt to something new so all they do is play Consulate/Bank bomb, it would be a win-win for everyone.
---
Looks like a filter
---
A weapon to surpass Metal Gear

wow you hit me with the EPIC r/woooosh, also keep downvoting the posts I make in this discussion since it probably makes you feel good instead of just coming up with valid points to counter when I say: this will happen, whether it's with friends or not, and it doesn't matter, you won the round and he cannot TK again (since RFF)
---
looks good
---
A rank cap it's just a placebo and it can obviously hurt matchmaking and general quality of life of the playerbase.
---
"Any other game with ranking system" still have problems with smurfs and MMR manipulation, 
---
&gt;clearly it's not their priority since it doesn't make them sweet money
---
Or maybe it's not that important and they can think about it after they solved other issues with this game?
---
The screen was red so he charged it. Should probably rename him to Bull though.
---
I mean with those new skin they might aswell hire people from the reddit, they are doing a better job and some would even do it for free if they get some sort of shoutout / exposure.
---
This post didn’t age well..

Next season, early June I guess.
---
How is try harding in casual fun? Ever watched  [u/BikiniBodhi](https://www.reddit.com/user/BikiniBodhi/)?
---
it’s literally not even out yet but ok
---
They never added that to the game
---
They listen to community very well. It's just stupid.
---
So you want them to start making up firearms then? Like what do you want? If you want a realistic game based in reality which all these units are for the most part except for their special ability, they don't really have a wide variety of weapons that they pick. I don't know a SOF unit today that still issues a standard 9mm submachine gun such as the MP5, it's also why Sig Sauer's MPX didn't sell well. Using a 9mm firearm in a active engagement isn't that wise of an idea. It's great for a side arm when your primary jams of some shit, but guys want stuff with more knock down power, and the 5.56 offers that while not over penetrating the target. The SCAR for example is hated, it jams a ton, like 3 times within 2 mags, it's extremely bulky, and it has a reciprocating bolt catch, meaning that every time you fire the rifle, the bolt runs forward.
---
Renown is beyond worthless
---
Why did they not even add 1 new gun
---
Yea... it's definitely me... but the F2 and the 417 are bomb as fck!
---
I'm pretty sure the fortnite world cup is going on rn too though, so who knows
---
Well technically he is a collector of old stuff iirc, so him having an MG42 isn't too far fetched
---
I like that it's not another retro WWII style uniform.
---
I don't understand the question, there are gold 1's in every gamemode.
---
Oh gotta get my flexing before therm and the new guys get permabanned
---
He lost all his dad vibe and I hate it
---
halt i will do it if you walk one step closer
---
How did you feel about operation health?
---
Can we expect the results of this survey to be released soon?
---
I thought it specified “old Soviet era guns”
---
I had to buy GTA5 3 times. For ps3, for ps4 (needed that 1st person mode), then for PC (got boring, needed to mod) so rockstar got me 3 times I got 3 different gamesaves. PITA
---
I'll make them for you in a bit :)
---
I don't mind twitch mains \*kind of am one\*. But you can tell which ones are mains and which one is playing for the gun. Why get gadgets when you can zap one guy and lose a drone
---
I want it
---
most of the community plays secure
---
That’s literally the two things that has been said lmao
---
Yea exact thing happened to me, I had a good 30+ skins on console, some of which included crossfaider and Dimond and 50+ charms, would of been nice if I could of kept my skins when I crossed over, but luckily I have no life so I got Dimond camo again
---
When you say barely remasterd map what do you mean it has soooo many new elements to it and there is gonna be so many new changes what do you want like a hereford kind of change where you barely recognize the map. The new operators  brings alot of new elements to the game aswell to stuff you gotta be aware of
---
Canadian had too big of an ego and it fucked him over good
---
Or you can buy them with renown. Not even that hard to grind renown for it or passively play and save renown.
---
I mean I have to wonder how did you feel when Operation Health or Grim Sky came out.
---
I'm usually at a gold 1 or 2 rank
---
We should be able to Link PC to PS4 to
---
Dude, ofc ranks affect who you will be matched with. My point is that they DO NOT represent the individual's skill meaning that two separate people could both be gold 1 but one would be lvl 200+ with 1k hours and the other could have bought the game a week ago a had some good shit on their placement matches. And this is an awfully frequent occurrence in Siege.
---
Looks like archer
---
Idk.. Had match point for like 4 rounds on Oregon and still didn't capitalize, then the whole not showing up at all on Clubhouse.
---
That’s what I’m thinking it was a way to nerf them while not making them unbalanced
---
Dude Justin was fucking awesome, I think he's miles above the new one(don't even know what her name was).
---
Real garbage season incoming
---
Hitboxes are not broken, killcams just don't display everything correctly sometimes
---
has Overwatch done this yet?
---
I actually haven't bought a PC because of this reason. I really want to make the switch to PC and I don't care if I have to buy the game a second time. But after investing so much time and money on regular and limited-time cosmetics in For Honor and in this game, I can't bring myself to do it.
---
Ubi's losing out on easy sales.
---
Just because they say it's 128GB doesn't mean it is. I looked it up on my pc and the game is 60.8GB without the hd texture pack.
---
I saw this happen to a streamer a few weeks ago but i don't remember who it was
---
Increasing the radius of Vigil fuzz would be the ideal buff, not decreasing it. 
---
Also when considering buffing or nerfing any characters in a game, you must consider every single aspect of that character. Excluding weapons and certain parts is a poor decision.
---
The game is becoming more and more competitive.
---
Seems like every new operator experiences a radical patch at some point over the course of a season or two
---
Valks/Frosts Shotty, Black Beards Shield, Ela’s SMG, Lions Gadget, Valk going down to 3 cams, Echo/Hibanas SMG being nerfed, Nitros being removed from half of all Defenders/Impacts being introduced..
---
Maybe with these, they’re trying to eliminate the need to balance from the get go.
---
I agree 100%, we may see a Buff instead of a Nerf.
---
if you answer one question, with good points, then i won't bash Ubi: What's the problem to add 1 new gun for each new operator this season?
---
It’s not true. Why do people think this?
---
IT HAPPENED! 
---
In a video put out officially, by Ubi, Nøkk's callsign was pronounced like she's a relative of our favorite raccoon shopkeeper.
---
Alright, still doesn't explain the pointless original post
---
I know for sure Alex has been on the panel before, and he was fine before. It was more the main panelist being unable to keep a decent flow, unlike Justin.
---
This. I don't know how much play time Warden will see in ranked or casual but I can see him being used constantly in pro league.
---
All new ops always start off costing 22500 renown, or 540 R6 credits.
---
Change “would” to “will”
---
YES PLS
---
I actually really like these! But I'm in that camp that likes my weapon skins to be more subtle. I don't really care for the flashy or fancy skins.
---
I have slight issues. If they were doing less content and cleaning up the game and making less bugs, I’d be okay with it. But now that they have separate parts of development, and they can’t even keep guns respective to the ops unit, it bothers me.
---
Go into the subreddit and click on the 3 dots in top right corner and it should say something along the lines of "profile flair" and you can choose from there
---
Too many games have no save migration because every game is full of microtransaction
---
Well I guess since I don't have all the ops yet it means more to me. Sorry, forgot.
---
It's coming in season 2
---
I really hope we get a splinter game. It's been too long
---
seriously dude, what the fuck? how is that even relevant?
---
I would LOVE the Skorpion as a secondary.
---
Also when I see him I play like I have a stick up my ass :/
---
So sweaty.
---
Glaz first shot is a headshot!
---
the concept is good but it did not do much
---
It got removed 3-4 days ago cus of a invisible glitches same with deployable shields and clash
---
Those people are just idiots. The R6 community is so toxic these days. Just try your best to play with people you can talk to, or find people to squad up with in the R6 discord.
---
They announced it on twitter
---
They said it was the 21 st for the tts not today what are you on about
---
The full patch notes will have all the changes for ranked , they obviously didn't go into everything during the reveal. I want a better ranked as well, lets hope for the best on Tuesday...ESPECIALLY people boosting each other.
---
They basically disabled them, clash and deployable shields until they can fix the exploits in the game.
---
Bruh, I wish they didn’t leave us on such a cliff hanger ending.
---
They removed it to stop the In Glitch
---
Of course. That’s why they had a John Wick looking character before with slightly changed facial features with a different name, before they got actual permission.
---
A thin ray of light into this shithole. 
---
Exactly how it should be. The game should not revolve around some moneymaking show, it should be fun and accommodate everyone playing it.
---
Is that a folding stock on the handgun on the right?
---
Welcome to R6.
---
No its a Lesion elite skin that Ubi announced on Twitter
---
Lol I’m sorry normally they release tts the day of the stream
---
He wasn't created to counter anyone in specific, but to be an anchor alternative to Jäger's utility. Blitz generally isn't good for pushing point anyway.
---
uPlayS4
---
I feel the exact same...
---
I just like the idea cause we know the guns are balanced unlike new weapons. The guns also balance out the op kits. I don’t care too much about the “realistic” part.
---
Because there's no Palestinian civilians in the game for them to kill
---
The most popular Ops are getting Elites = more money. Next one would be something like smoke or mira.
---
But it was lazy.
---
Season 2
---
It takes roughly 40 hours of regular play to get 25k renown. Wtf you talking about.
---
Hopefully this forces then to look at the hit reg
---
Dude if I could get this skin on Caveira Vigil or Nøkk that would be insane
---
r/lostredditors
---
You were toxic. That's how it works. Fuckin suck it up and finish the match like a good sport don't but a pussy and kill the hostage to end the game.
---
holo on P90=tallest thing ever
---
#  the concept is good
---
Yes it can??
---
The power of Christ compels you
---
You pick that shit up quick
---
If Ubi could make it the real Elite Animation. That would be perfect for it.
---
We'll never see him in game anyway #HostageGold4Player
---
No. As far as we know, R6 and Ghost Recon share a universe since they had crossover DLC for Wildlands. Also, anyone who is a true fan of the Splinter Cell series would know that it could never be Sam Fisher.
---
Actually all of ubisofts games are in a single universe. For honor, for example is a video game they have there.
---
Yeah I’m just going to see what looks better on my mains
---
What were you going to suggest, just out of interest?
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
Yeah stuff like stopping exploits would not even be possible a year ago. You don't know you lost something til the moment you lose it. It's kinda like managing money, the more pay you get the more your used to spending. Ones you get a problem and money runs dry, it's hard not to spent money and let go of your previous lifestyle.
---
Omg yes. Noobs, please learn from this.
---
Shit I didn't even know I did that sorry
---
I see. I tought they were different universe even tho they are all in Tom Clancy. Thanks for the info!
---
i personally dont wanna say they are lazy until we get an actual response
---
Nah too many legs
---
If twitter has shown us anything, it's that it will come sooner or later.
---
Coppers the nicest one lmao
---
ohh. yeah, the MP5. and the mp5SD (echo) and the mp5k (mute) all have the same damage model. I've heard some people talk about the fmg's recoil as being worse than the mp5 tho. personally its whatever
---
Hopefully because it would break the game frl
---
You’ve confused content for creativity. We get two operators every single season; they’re slowing down on making new maps because so many of tge older ones have have serious problems to address.
---
There’s two different sides to sieges player base.
---
 One side is the casual player base that only plays this game when new content comes out. They play for two weeks and then don’t play again until the next season.
---
The second side is the more hardcore player who plays pretty much every day and understands and cares about the game far more than the casual player. Undo that the core of the game and gameplay in general has to keep being nursed and is far more important than constant new stuff just to appease the casual player.
---
Ubisoft has a hard task trying to keep the game competitive for the veteran players but fun and appealing for the casual player. All things considered they do a good job of both. Put all the game breaking bugs aside and Ubisoft does a good job of maintaining a reasonable balance for siege. As a day one player I don’t give a shit about new operators or weapons. I care about the crappy maps being more competitive and bugs being fixed quicker and stupid op operators being more fun to play against.
---
First time I've hated new operators being added.
---
What do you like more roaming or anchoring
---
I understand your point of view but platinum (the metal) itself is literally the color of silver so I don't understand the change. It doesn't have the consistency with the other ranks anymore.
---
every season they let streamers/youtubers play the new season at a event same time as proleague to kinda promote and tell people about the new season
---
*more popular overall everywhere
---
In Ghost Recon Wildlands, they’ve had two crossover operations. One that features Twitch and Cav, and one that features Sam Fisher
---
As bad as the Skorpion balance was on launch, it needed to be balanced but as a gun the gun is really unique, with its high fire rate high kick, Ela would probably feel really different if she just had an Mp7 or something else, when you think of Ela you 100% think of her gun.
---
Lesion has his T-Shirt Cannon, Ela had the Laser, The R4C Ashe Run gun, The M870 pocket pick, even Jagers Accog is a meme, you can clearly see the guns aren't as background as some people in the comments here think, Jager, is 99% his gun, give him the UMP45 and the meme wouldnt have developed.
---
depends on the circumstances. But i lean more toward roaming.
---
I've always found the FMG recoil to be great, or maybe it's just because I've been using it over the shotty since day one
---
Honestly I’ve stopped playing siege that much since blood orchid, I’ve personally moved to for honor after that and I have never felt that there is a shortage of players, its player count gets bigger and bigger every season
---
People have become pampered with this 4 seasons a year system, this game is complex enough that it could stay interesting and fresh with less frequent updates. Look at counter strike, game has hardly changed at all from its original form for 20 years and people are still crazy about it.
---
Probably alibi then but that final decision is up to you
---
Well you have to tap fire with it at medium range don’t bother using it at long ranges, the smg 11 has a crap ton of recoil but when you get used to it it’s quite good. And it’s lethal in close ranges. But I wouldn’t rely on the smg 11 on sledge unless you have to reload or are in a very close range fight the L85 is a great weapon.
---
Claymores cause invisibility
---
Deployable shields are bugged
---
Clash shoots while covered
---
New breaching animation
---
Ubi: Oh yeah, it's all comin together.
---
Git gud
---
Good lord those are some ugly ass weapon skins.
---
This is sick as hell. The other's in the gallery are as well. Out of curiosity, how long would it take to do the combined wallpapers for the remaining CTUs?
---
Exactly. Hopefully once it launches people will warm up to it
---
when the other team are a 5 stack all on 150+ ping it’s highly unlikely that all their internet is bad
---
So i did some digging. Sam Fisher had a girl child named Sarah Fisher. But they don't have any history in denmark.
---
You might be right, sadly lol
---
A camo suit... Not sure how i feel about it
---
Iunno what you're saying about the rework, it looks like exactly what kafe needs without pulling a hereford.
---
Warden nor nox need good guns. The game is ran by an intel meta, and both operators are looking to shake up that meta.
---
You can't give either of them good loadouts because they're so mechanically strong. Besides that the mpx is honestly a great gun, and the fmg-9 is a bit of a laser.
---
Yes, we've seen the abilities before, but we have 3 hard breachers that have similar abilities, ash and zofia, every trap operator accomplishes basically the same task
---
The only BS thing about this is Nokk getting silent step, *and* vigil's anti-cam ability
---
They are airsoft.
---
Please please please ubi
---
emm, no
---
What rank do you play at, alibi some times struggles at higher ranks because players can avoid triggering the decoys. 
---
Kaid is like bandit on steroids so I’d chose him but it’s your choice.
---
Yet he has the lowest win rate on attack. But he does feel really strong somehow.
---
I'm personally no fan. I like to play with all 3 modes activated, just to have a bit of variety and fun. Sure, i can play casual, but we all know casual can't be compared to ranked, where people leave after dying 24/7 f.ex..
---
We already had the option to disable whatever mode we didn't like. I'd like it to stay the same way. By all means, implement "pro-league" into bomb version only, if it doesn't suit the other modes, but i'd love it if we could keep all modes for those who don't wanna do bomb-only.
---
But a big plus for actually doing something with ranked mode (Y).
---
huh, i thought it was a mask like vigil. TIL, thanks op!
---
maybe this could be the pro league skin for next season, but idk
---
The previous armor system was fucking awful. Newcomers to the game didn’t stand a chance against higher level people because they had specific armpits which gave them an unfair advantage. The new perk system ensures that the only way somebody has an advantage is by skill and not stats
---
ok?
---
I'm not a true fan of the Splinter Cell ceries but i did some digging. Sam fisher had a child called Sarah. But she never got involved any military thing other than kidnapping by some villians etc. And she surely never went to denmark.
---
I get what you mean but personally I have no problem with them reusing guns if their gadgets are really good (which in this case I think they are)
---
Exceot hes the one defending so he can just hold and algle and force glaz to push
---
How does his ability work? I havent looked at gameplay
---
My man looking like a Gundam pilot right there
---
As a computer scientists: those programms only could check editings on JPEG files, due to the compression.
---
If you take a screenshot of the game with a lossless codec (eg. PNG) you couldn't detect any editing in that regard.
---
Exactly. Bunch of entitled bitches.
---
do them for starter renown and to get a feel for the game
---
Ranked is literally coming out of beta next season. They announced that at the invitational in Feb. They have said many times that they are worrying about the long term health of the game. I.E all of the map reworks this year. With all of the reworks the map pool will become better, they'll have more time to fix issues quicker and general game balance choices. This year alone they've made necessary changes to ash, glaz, ying, blitz and lion. All of those were very strong and contributed to the ranked toxicity. They've changed the game a lot recently and almost all are for the better(looking at you twitch buff).
---
he was on the Pro Potato a third time, idk if you've seen it. If you have he agreed they were playing badly but he also said they hid as much as possible before six inv. They played oregon every other week just for that.
---
Which platform are you playing Siege on anyway?
---
They'll hopefully be able to use their sidearm to defend themselves hopefully.
---
Bro you enjoy other videogames
---
Bro that's kinda cringe bro
---
They’re working on possibly making his gadget louder when using it.
---
It’s going to be in alpha packs :(
---
(I may be wrong but I don’t think there is a legendary headgear that you can buy for any character)
---
Me
---
Wow great post man
---
I love it. They look simplistic and realistic.
---
if you are just sitting still wide in the open and you are in a position where smokes could be thrown on you then youre already dead from being in a shit position. You talk like a gold. It's really not that hard to wrap your head around and at this point I just suspect you're more interested in being right and "winning" the argument rather than finding the truth.
---
they removed they because they are literally game breaking and was fucking with the ranked results so they took them out to fix them
---
The comment I was responding to literally only mentioned BB, I was pointing out the others.
---
she's holding a gun she doesn't even use damn
---
is Nokk the only operator we don't know their name?
---
I play on pc and I didn’t even know you couldn’t hip lean on console 😂
---
Hereford, outback, and fortress still staying in the ranked playlist *sighs* 
---
Just because it’s new doesn’t mean it’s balanced or even fun, cause those maps are pretty much shit
---
I WANT MY FUCKING EXCLUSIVE LIMITED TIME EVENT SKINS AND WEAPON CHARMS!! I REMEMBER WHEN THEY HAD ASH MEDAL 🏅 I NEED THAT BACK TO ASSERT MY ASH MAIN DOMINANCE! ALSO I WANT MY HALLOWEEN HEADGEAR BACK, ALSO MORE CHARMS LIKE THE BIRTHDAY ONES AND THAT REALLY COOL CHARM THAT WAS FROM THAT ONE CHALLENGE BACK IN YEAR 1.
---
It’s been over 4 years now and I’ve had a lot of good memories playing siege on my PS4 but now all thoughts hard earned memorabilia will be forever on my console. Please give us the option to transfer the gear onto our PC account. Or perhaps switch up the accounts? I have my PC and PS4 accounts on the same email so yeah.
---
because the bug was only a problem on clash since it allowed her to shoot through her shield, and none of the other defensive ops have shields
---
I know I was just joking about how fast he made this
---
But letter means it has to be tied to an alphabet, fucking blueberry. (My imaginary racist term for blue people.)
---
That is actually exactly how it works and also why it's such a hassle for Warframe for example to migrate profiles.
---
the MP5SD2 is a good fit for her too
---
Anything doing better then fortnite puts a big smile on my face
---
I mean they did when they weren’t expecting to be in combat (like climbing stuff)
---
Seriously though.  It is sad people can't take the game seriously enough to play fair all the time. Cheating and glitching is crap. This is an esport. It's supposed to be a fair game to prove who has more skill not who cheats better.
---
Awesome thanks for the input and info!
---
Fortnite also has crossplay and it made the news that Sony saw themselves forced to allow it.
---
Lol all of them...
---
