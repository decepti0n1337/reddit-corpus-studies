Frost for me. I have a soft spot for her shotgun, plus it's always satisfying to nab someone with a Welcome Mat where they least expect it. 
---
(On a PC standpoint)
---
Kaid for denying hard breachers and drones with the barbed wire. He's an Anchor with a good gadget but subpar guns. His TCSG Slug Shotgun, however, is hella fun to use (but console recoil for that gun is still broken from what I've heard)
---
Frost for roaming and fucking over rushing Ashes and Blitz's with her Welcome Mats. Her guns are heeelllaa fun to use, both the Sterling SMG and the Super 90 shotgun. If you have good map knowledge, maybe Frost is for you.
---
But of course, personal preference is personal preference. Have at it with whatever op you wanna buy.

And we traded afterward xD

And also totes a LMG

God dammit Sam

Sorry, but

Just don't get flashed lol
---
I honestly feel bad. I made the mistake of purchasing the starter edition first. I had no idea what I was in for. Eventually I just bought the advanced edition.
---
Siege is not in a poor state, every game has it's faults, but siege is relatively ironed out.
---
I know, the bullet just looks like it is in the death cam
---
How is this furry? And why are furries stupid?
---
Its weird seeing all your videos but never seeing your Toothless poster and plushie, its cute tbh. is he like your good luck charm? 
---
LMG. MOUNTED. AND LOADED.
---
He'd be able to move a lot quicker and be less likely to be detected.
---
It's a rifle IRL, but in game it's designated as a SMG and I don't understand why. 
---
this remembers me all that cat art that was done a couple of years ago , awesome too.

It's a carbine, but [the Korean Army calls in an SMG](http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=4089). I heard it was supposed to be a replacement to the M3 Grease Gun, so maybe that's why the SMG term stuck.

I have over 800 hours in ESO and over 1300 hours in Siege. I can say for sure that ESO has almost no major issues and bugs while Siege is almost unbearable at some times with Ubi doing absolutely nothing until the cash flow is interrupted.
---
And while ESO has cheap base game with optional reasonably priced chapters and a premium subscription granting full access to the DLCs, Siege is sold at a full AAA price, has annual season passes and seasonal paid lootboxes. 
---
No it is not

I don't get kicks from annoying people but I certainly don't get kicks from "art" like above. But yeah I hope you get kicked as well.
---
Fortnite uses Unreal 4 engine which was developed by epic itself and they have already spent over 10 years on it from the beginning. While Siege uses Havok and the original dev team didn't get sufficient support from Ubi, for this game was the substitute of Rainbow Six: Patroit, and nobody thought it would succeed then.

You should probably get it checked by a doctor, then. 
---
Somewhat new player here: why is lion cancerous?
---
Most of the top ‚Äúart‚Äù is memey art that shouldnt be there so that means that there is an even smaller amount of allowed art at the top which proves its not that popular. And i would say that most of this art is not directly related to siege like game suggestions or clips which isnt allowed also

For u that is. I mean look at the map u got matched in.

Did you die?

They hate you because you look up when flashing
---
Attackers won, great :D 
---
okay but your point still makes no sense
---
Literally same thing happened to me and the whole team rushed me every round 
---
Yeah my friend and I got into a 2v5 and by the time it was 0-2 3 guys came in it‚Äôs a major problem that has been existing since white noise
---
Hammer to face ftw. 
---
Yeah, it's awful. I kinda gave up after reaching plat 2. MnK just got out of control. Even when your casual MMR is somewhat high there's just too many MnK users. 
---
Sure, you'll have games where there are just genuine players, but the amount of MnK players is increasing and it's indeed killing the game, at high ranks at least. 
---
Ubisoft can't really fix this though. It kills the game but I think people are getting angry at the wrong people. 
---
When there is ten seconds left just leave
---
Its literally impossible to play

This is gold

Specially when she is leaning and crouching at 10x the speed of light 
---
That explains a lot. Fuck that game lately, they've just been doing the stupidest fuckin nerfs and buffs and there's still a bunch of buggy stupid shit with sound
---
Making the game overall worse 
---
It happens to frequently (literally every match) for it to be an elite controller 
---
I‚Äôd think that elite controllers are more accessible than KB/M
---
You okay?
---
Neither did he. 
---
So why does this happen?
---
? What?
---
Meant Reddit gold 
---
I just got really pissed that I cant even play ranked because I we get massacred by someone using KB&amp;M. I don‚Äôt really know how they would fix it or if it‚Äôs even possible but Fortnite did it, so hopefully ubi can too. 
---
My friend gave me this 3D printed charm so I decided to see what it looked like next to some of my toys. Hope you enjoy! 
---
Terrorist hunt 
---
Idk maybe 
---
It is blocked, there's nothing Ubi can do about adapters that trick consoles into thinking a controller is connected. You can crouch spam on controller with paddles too
---
Oh. Cant believe anyone would spend money like that. Might as well just burn it.

I hope to see a g2 v EG or penta I

"It's my special breaching tool"

How long did it take to print?

Yeah i heard pkaying TH can help. Might need to just speend a whole day or so playing it.

I just quit playing. Tired of dying to these people. Im only playing siege again after they block different inputs on console. 
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm mostly talking about when you like play a 4-4 ranked game and then you type in chat and no one responds.  I get ur point tho
---
This is similar to what happened with me and my friends. The game became less fun so we meme to the point where I went from gold 2 to bronze 1. Those were the best games of my time on siege. 
---
Get a 5 man together, more communication means more callouts
---
I don't blame you man, as long as I don't encounter too many more of them I'll play a little while longer
---
Cool but I don‚Äôt main any of those lmao
---
Both are great alternatives 
---
My quality-of-life in seige really improved once I got a mate of mine hooked (We play PC now). Even as a duo, you come across toxic players less. Once we found a discord server/Group, the game really opened up. But still find smurf players or toxic opponents who just spawn peek. 
---
Where are you buying it?
---
So this was just a quick video, celebrating the days of COD4 montages that populated YouTube back in 2008 and onwards. This video is just supposed to be a fun throwback, nothing too serious. Hope you enjoy!
---
Not interested, cause not a BI fan.
---
But that's just me tho.
---
Why does the chair look like it's killing your spine
---
Yeah. As long as you know them a little bit. Then there‚Äôs no toxicity
---
When taking it off he had the option to throw it at an attacker stunning the momentarily as 50 pounds of armor hit them in the fucking face
---
True 
---
If you played it often, you'd know it has just as many bugs as Siege. You just don't notice them cause you don't play it as often. 
---
Not in your og post you didn't.
---
You've got serious fps issues, mate.
---
(Please tell me how to solve it, I too am suffering this)
---
How is the success/failure decided?
---
Yeah but 50 pounds of armor probably couldn‚Äôt be tossed that far
---
Sky isn't balanced. Kafe is pathetic. Chalet is garbage.
---
Hereford and fortress are epic, but they have too many L hallways, which is what they aren't in pro league.

I suggest version 399. It's been more stable for me.

Hey i argued with varsity over pizza on stream once.

Ya I did that 4 times today and it would not let me on eus and its also been happening for 5 months 
---
ah! well see about getting one for the new op then! :D
---
Its happens in a 1v1 in obj as well. Lion is just annoying. He's easy to kill for me. I have roamed with other operators though and I know what you mean. It can be a pain, but after the 2 nerf, he's just easy to work around
---
Look at IQ there, flexing on people who said she wouldn't be picked because she lost her frags. Shows how people just don't look at the big picture.

So happy to see cap going up the charts. FeelsGoodMan.

hm... i'll see what i can do! :D
---
I started seige on xbox and it seemed fine until i started playing on pc, and i wondered why i wasnt being TKed, then i decided to play on xbox for some reason but the first 3 games i joined in progress matches and got either kicked instantly or tked... easily my worst gaming expirence other than playing against a 6 stack crucible clan in destiny 2.
---
I never said i'd block you lmao. I just proves my point AGAIN, and this time you ran out of shit to say so you refer to that. Everything you've said during this argument was "I'm right because i say so", and you ignore everything i say. Every time i win the argument, you come up with something else to argue about. I'm not changing the subject, you're starting a new one whenever i beat you. You're an ignorant loser, and don't know how to argue. I win for the 6th, and last time. Goodbye, dumbass.

Also send me a PM if you want to deal with 3 shitty teammates instead of 4
---
Did the Twitch win that round or if not how did he die?
---
1v1 against lion is nothing great. He needs a team to get it to work. But in  team, he's cancer OP.
---
Like I said, you probably had the good fortune of playing against bad lions and bad cancer stacks that didn't exploit the ability well. But all the way down to bronze, cancer is well coordinated, and mute just enough.

and i did just send this video in to them thanks for the link

He's utter garbage, had a crappy attitude, doesn't show any great gameplay that you'll definitely find in pretty much any other streamer, and has a huge God complex.
---
He flaunts team kills as if it's an achievement. "19 kills and 4 team kills!", And laughs at TKs.
---
No wonder he got kicked from rogue. He deserves to die.
---

Most people say Invitationals. Most people forget that Roadmaps were shown in Nov/Dec, every year. They showcase the newer ops in detail during the invitationals, but the roadmap itself is always shown earlier. See the roadmap for Year 3: [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-306359-16/year-3-panel-recap](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-306359-16/year-3-panel-recap) posted on  11/20/2017 12:00 PM. I mean, if this year they decided to change the format and make us wait until the invitationals, then it will be shown there. No way they won't show it there. But I would expect it earlier to be honest...

No I‚Äôm new to playing on pc and wanted to finish all of the situations I just wanted to say that I have experience on the game to show that I understand the situation.
---
That's fuggn creepy
---
All modes, which is best for what though?
---
I like to be aggressive most of the time
---
I wonder what happened to my game in this moment . I restarted my game and it‚Äôs gone 
---
I'd recommend lion or echo both are very good.  
---
I didn't even have to read the name and I recognize that setup
---
Valid point. I feel like Lion was much more powerful/broken than Maverick. Especially in pro league play. Im rather glad they perma-banned him. 
---
They cant do anything unfortunately. For some reason while in a casual match, I got an abandon sanction when I never queued for ranked. I provided evidence and everything to ubisoft support asking why this happened. Long story short, nothing could be done 
---
I mean im new to pc man i dont really know much about it
---
Operator idea: boof master 
---
‚ÄúPlayed since release‚Äù (only 175)
---
You got an abandon sanction, they won't do anything
---
It‚Äôs literally the most satisfying thing to do as sledge. My favorite thing to do is if it‚Äôs a one v one and I‚Äôve down the last person is to slowly walk towards them with hammer in hand and laugh menacingly in my mic for my whole team to enjoy. 
---
Got the R4-C while my buddy got the SASG-12 at the same time. It was mental. Congrats on your new (old) skin!
---
Thank you! 
---
If you get TKd, most of the time there is likely a reason behind it involving you.
---
Playing since release doesn't mean you play every day or its even your most played game
---
Sure thing! 
---
I can hear it being reinforced
---
His m4 is similar to ashes r4-c in my opinion if you like her gun you will probably like his. Unless you want to go with the semi-auto route then id suggest him over the others, his sar is one of my favorite ones in the game. And like one of the other comments said "if you play sneaky you'll like him" 
---
What platform
---
Message them kindly and talk reasonably until they apologize or reveal that their life is a depressing mess.  It‚Äôs the greatest joy you can get out of that situation.   
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many of them are just people having a bad day and need a few kind words to get them to calm down.  There‚Äôs still a lot that are worthless people.
---
Snuffles....? Anyone..?
---
No thats the 2nd thing. The most scary thing in siege is finding caveira behind you when you are hiding in a dark corner and her face becomes demonic, then you find yourself telling the live position of your team while they are dead threw walls and floors with your human wall hack.
---
I didn't say Ubisoft. I said PlayStation 
---

by barely played I mean the spots aren‚Äôt used, not the map. I really don‚Äôt see how those two bathrooms mean flashes are useless. This doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre inconsistent, it means that two rooms are glitched and tbh I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just taking your word for it. 
---
claymore can be completely pointless depending on the site you‚Äôre taking. Overrated gadget that sits unused in most rounds, and even if they are used you can always shoot them out, unless it‚Äôs in a window. I know it‚Äôs not always used to get a kill, but I‚Äôd rather take the ability to blind 3 people or burn out ads‚Äô over a claymore.  
---
Wait, all I had to do was stand still to not get detected? This just made my life much more easy.
---
I very very rarely play Blitz so today I just learned that you can use your gadget while ADSing as him, just made me think he‚Äôs even more op 
---
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

You are an insult to all Maestro players

Whent they are in a party chat they are doing it to be dicks. My life has been hell and I don't behave liek that. Look through my Reddit history. From my parent ocking me in a bathroom and starving me thus getting them 15 years of prison to discovering you got hsv2  from someone you used to love.  I can keep going. There's no excuse for toxicity. 
---
Platform?
---
It's not even a nerf, just an adjustment.
---
Today is the first day I've thought about it but I won't.  It's not THAT serious.  Just sad I don't enjoy playing anymore.  As bad as the bugs were in previous seasons, I believe this season is the worst collectively.  The game has completely changed and I guess I'm just an old man yelling at the clouds.
---
that was... that was beautiful

Toxic cause I said ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt clutch‚Äù not like I said he‚Äôs shit at the game or anything. And y‚Äôall acting like I‚Äôm Cancer on the community.

Can you stop with this "Bring back &lt;insert trash map name&gt;". people like you brought favela and yacht back in the rotation. people like you cried for ubisoft to add Bartlett.U and then cried until they removed it. all those maps including old Hereford (and even new one) are trash they should not be up in map pool. if you want them that bad play custom games. 
---
It was casual. Are you ok?
---
**WIDE**
---
Literally, all of your posts are just disagreeing with people, go join a debate club.
---
Console (PS4 to be specific)
---
However, my problem is that you still have to wait, join a match that probably is ASS, leave it, re-queue, probably  wait for the same thing to happen again,

I'm about level 220 on ps4 with bad aim, even for console standards. After the last few months I've reached lvl 115 on pc using only gamepad, (playing in silver/gold soloQ) and I have been enjoying the game even more tbh. Sure mouse is better but gp still works good enough. The aim advantage gap is not wide enough that you can't outplay people with strategy and smart plays. With 2400 hours worth of experience and a 5 stack you should have the capability to hold gold against laggy mkb adaptors.

Once you buy whoever you are getting take em into some t-hunts and try em out so you get a feel before you go up against other people with em too. Any time I get an operator i just do 1 or 2 games to get a feel for the gadget and recoil. Its good practice.

I play Kaplan a lot and recently stary3d playing mute regilarly. All it takes is a couple pings and some reassurance that yes that IS what you want teammates to do. And if they're not responsive or straight up hostile tumhen realize the enemy team has an extra players and change how u play. 
---
I don't think making it so that 2 people can "properly" reinforce makes anyone any better at the game but would instead just make it so that people who are already well versed in the strategic aspects of the game come even more on top than they already do.

And hackers arent even that rampant on pc. They of course exist but in the last 3 months of playing ive yet to see anyone whos clear blatant hacking. Some people that were suspicious but to point of 50/50 either hack or just actually really good. But 0 people where i could say for 100% sure that that person is hacking. Playing in mid gold-low plat.

You can do that but the game servers still won't register your headshot

you are right, it was a duplicate.

Is this a custom game? Why are you 4 - 1? Why is nobody else asking this is it just common knowledge and I'm dumb?

Ive shot nomad jabs mid air, the physics in this game are surprisingly good

I feel like this is a good idea so you wouldn‚Äôt have to take the time to look at ur drone before entering a room. More importantly your op wouldn‚Äôt give out the sound que that he‚Äôs checking his drone

---
I was looking for the not so detailed icons, you know the old ones before operation chimera but tank you for the help :)
---
Thanks for the info. But I'm strongly thinking to get Jackal just because of his C7E and pdw, what do you think?
---
Speaking from my subjective experience that has not been the case.
---
(PS4 here) I don‚Äôt really accuse people with good aim alone. I myself play on a very high sens and I do own a scuf. 
---
What I see a lot in plat games is continually crouch spamming and jiggle peeking which is pretty unlikely for anyone to do without a mnk. It could be done with a scuf, but you still don‚Äôt have the necessary buttons to pull it off easily, and the big part is these people never ‚Äúpanic knife‚Äù when adsing and leaning which is impossible to do on console because of the way the controls are mapped. 
---
Have fun man! 
---
#YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
oof.
---
Why can't they do it like fortnite? Console KB/M play with PC only
---
Oh, I see, didn't notice. I'm sure someone made a high-res version back then but I don't have a link for those. 
---
Thanks for the explanation buddy.
---
I play on PS4 and I do use a scuf, but it is by no means equivalent to mnk. For one, you can crouch spam a bit but not as good as a mnk. Also, you can‚Äôt jiggle peak with any controller on any console because of the way the mapping of the controls is. Trust me, at a plat level of play you see mnk every match. When you add up jiggle peeking + crouch spamming + no recoil you get a mnk on console. Sony and Microsoft are the problem here because they allow it to happen. Ubi is not at fault here. 
---
His c7e is an amazing all rounder like other ARs you are probably used to, and his pdw is amazing at taking heads off with little recoil, lastly his ability is great for pin-pointing anyone, just use it at any chance you get. He's a good buy, you will like him
---
In 75% of the time a see cav trought walls while shes interrogating, in this case i have 0% chance to get ready to it. And ill say it again, its not happening that many times to get all this things

It‚Äôs okey and tank you for help me my friend
---
gimme it gimme it

It seems...smaller than I would have expected..I guess I shouldn't have assumed the operators were people-sized.

It's custom

I rarely panic knife these days. I can jiggle peak too. People can remap their controllers to have crouch on a button that lets them spam it while aiming too.

If the video doesnt work for you: [https://clips.twitch.tv/TubularPleasantSeahorsePeteZarollTie](https://clips.twitch.tv/TubularPleasantSeahorsePeteZarollTie)
---
You don't need 128 fps to see the benefits of 128 tick servers.
---
Sure it's nice to be able to see every update on your screen but even running at 30 fps you would still get shot round the corner less, have more accurate hitreg and just generally feel more receptive.
---
At the end of the day your monitor has no bearing on how the server runs the calculations, it doesn't matter your fps. Even if your GPU is dogshit your PC can still easily send/receive 128 packets of data a second and calculate that. Rendering it to your screen quickly doesn't matter
---
Maybe. I've filled up about half of skyscraper with razor wire and you have to bug out the terrorists to do it and it stroked out before I could record anything, so it's going to take yet even more commitment.
---
Ash. She's fast, her weapons generally have low recoil, and her breaching tool is nice. Jackal is the same with low recoil and a tracker so you can scan for the Cavs. Just get used to looking down when entering rooms. Just a quick peek down to the floor to counter the Frost traps. Best way to counter spawn peeking is to pre-aim windows and get to the building ASAP. 
---
Also, invest some time in terrorist hunt to get better map knowledge and aiming. T Hunt saved my life.
---
But what about new operators 
---
I take it back, you are indeed correct (screen recorded reddit and slowed footage down) man thats impressive
---
Can confirm hits wall, record the footage and slow it down frame by frame
---
I literally spent almost 40k trying to get all attachments just to test them and week later this news. No refund. 
---
I get why people say that this is nothing much. I play rarely especially after things like this. It is hard to collect enough to pay something good.
---
Did I see glass shatter or what?
---
If Thermite was the only hard breacher he would have a high ban rate 
---
Thanks for the input. Though do you have any tips on how to control recoil other than using certain attachments? Because I find I usually just inaccurately spray at an enemy and it's near impossible for me to get headshots.
---
Vertical play, some increased Twitch play, bandit juggling, being able to burn ADS‚Äôs, and IQ can handle the camera ops while also tracking Vigil and Pulse gadgets. You‚Äôll likely see him go up as mute continues to go up in pickrate and once Kaid is allowed in. 
---
That just killed me
---
Please dont bother ive seen your work previously ill know when you make something new
---
"Their full rework" no. He leaked tbat they've changed him, he never stated that it's a final design. For all we know it could still be a simple concept they are still flushing out. They take their time with it because it's a lot more complex than adjusting some stats for a gun. 
---
I'm not disagreeing with you entirely. It's still idiotic to assume that the Lion rework is 100% complete from two sentences Pengu said, and that the devs are just being lazy. 
---
Crouch, lean spam. Operators that inhibit behavior instead of destroying devices and creating lines of sight (looking at you Lion and Dokkaebi). The roaming, frag happy meta.
---
It killed my hopes of playing Go4s or even Ranked. I'll just stomp away in casual til I get tired of playing and hang the game up for a few months.
---
I would rather go back to the un-stoppable long range shotguns, Jager/Bandit/SMG-11 with ACOG days where strategy still mattered.
---
Maestro is typically dealt with by Ash, Zophia, Buck, or Sledge.

Did Team Secret get eliminated?!

I mean, just because people are actually good in the lower ranks doesn't mean they are Smurfs, I've seen alot of plat level players stuck in silver &amp; gold just because they solo cue or don't have a good team to play with all the time 
---
A lot of clubhouse has been played lately and he completely breaks the top floor sites. Same with Villa. If you have a match on Villa with no mira and a maverick on the board, the defense is going to have a tough match.
---
Xim4 or any MnK adapters are undetectable , they trick the console into thinking that the input is coming from a joystick , that's why they can't fight it unless Sony does something about it 
---
(But they won't because they gave a license to the Hori adapters)
---
I did it on a casual match once, and I felt so dirty I had to go take a shower
---
Elaborate, please. (Legit, do elaborate)
---
Yes, but ELO changes for however many games have been played. If his friend has played a lot, his loss would be minimal while OP is still going to lose full ranks in placement.
---
People think so too.
---
I'd like to know how it would be better.
---
For me, just track damage over multiple matches. Someone can already run in front of your gun and die to your gun fire. The idea is to track damage. Let the allowed damage parameters start high, resetting and accidents do happen. 
---
Once players do more team damage than allowed they get kicked and for their following matches their threshold is reduced. This shouldn't be a problem if it was an accident but if it's a troll they will get kicked sooner next match. 
---
Add tracking over time, so that someone doing 100 friendly fire damage every round in 10 matches in a row is tracked and banned. Don't show the exact threshold of what's allowed and let it vary for everyone based on their history. This way people can't play the system like some are currently (1 teamkill on 2 different players without getting kicked). 
---
True.
---
Though his guns are trash. 650 rpm is simply not competitive.
---
/u/Fiendir posted this: https://i.imgur.com/HL95okN.gifv
---
Having a direct counter isn't necessary. Only room for counter play is. And that is sound.
---
Cav doesn't have a direct counter either. Yet, Look at her.
---
CAKE! MOUNTED! AND FROSTED!
---
Glory to Fuzetotzka.
---
She's not. She's going to get one. In a coordinated team, she's broken. She'll get a nerf soon. Pros are demanding one.
---
Minus Glaz, a lot of the Russian ops aren't really useful in pro league. Fuze is meh, you'll see him picked a bit but mostly to burn an ADS from above or clear barbed in a long hallway. Think of the basement hallway on clubhouse.
---
Chanka doesnt need an explanation. When he is picked in pro league, it's a meme match. See G2 vs Supremacy on playday 14 last season if you need proof. Kapkan has actually seen a bit of play as a 6th pick, but usually it maybe works once, then you can't expect it to work again. Again, check G2 vs Secret (I think it was playday 2 this season) for proof of that.

Nope. Not this.
---
We'll just go with what the pros and streamers are asking for- a timer for the ring. Not an infinite ring.
---
It's called volcano. Not lava.
---
A lot of people watching this and still giving it shit. To me, it's amazing that a game can even really do this. It's a super rare occurrence but when it does happen arent you happen it can?
---
A quick chat selection might be useful, but outright text chat would probably cause more issues than it solves. It's rare for a meaningful callout to come via text chat on PC. Most times it's used for toxic purposes or not used at all. Then even when players who aren't on mics choose to use text chat, most times it's so delayed that whatever information they're sharing is stale and not reliable. And that's with players who have a full fledged keyboard to type out the message, not trying to type with an on-screen keyboard and controller.
---
It's volcano skin, btw.
---
Can you find vods of specific operators in the games? Like for example a site which shows when mav was picked or buck and where to watch it? 
---
Tank you very much my friend, I looking for this icons a lot of time! :‚Äô)
---
You can do that normally 
---
&gt; Especially since all of my friends also have ps4s. 
---
Don't feel bad about sticking to PS4 if it keeps you with your friends.
---
The ultimate truth about gaming is that it's like a bar. It doesn't matter if that bar is a dive bar, a strip club, or that fancy new gastropub downtown. As long as it's the place your friends go to, you'll go there too. 
---
It goes to owners pockets
---
Didn't even know you could blow that wall up...

Not sure it is from my friend‚Äôs screenshot, I am Tachanka.

---
I am thinking the same, 2 turrets are pretty powerful.
---
Nah your an obvious thread derailer your post record is clear proof you have an agenda of making sure ubi does not respond to ppls posts regarding mnk on console you say the same 1 liners at the exact time on EVERY SINGLE POST regarding mnk, and im going to expose you and other paid shills on this sub reddit
---
that's completely wrong
---
the visual player mesh is almost always larger than the hitbox/bubbles.
---
Block 100
---
The adapter is an issue on hardware level and API can‚Äôt help there. If the console itself doesn‚Äôt notice anything suspicious, there is no other way to track the problem. Only possible solutions can be implemented with next console generations, not any sooner.
---
The Six Invitational starts on the 11th of February. Don‚Äôt know the exact times right now but I guess the first matches will be around 11am local time (Canada, Montreal). But as I said I don‚Äôt know for sure, just guessing. 
---
Depends how much effort you want to invest. From a technical point of view it should not be a problem for Microsoft to provide the information needed to detect it. I do not know how much technical knowledge you have but every usb device that is sold has identifiers that can be read when you connect the device. I am not sure if they are legally allowed to block all xim usb devices in general but at least the can pass the information that there is a xim connected to the xbox. 
---
But you are also right, there must be a reason why it is not standard to prohibit it. 
---
All those simulations with top tier operators teaches spoopy lady how to do top tier interrogation, that or her way is extremely unconventional.
---
The console thinks that the MnK is a controller due to the adapter, so that's not really working.
---
When a company like Epic Games with their billions of dollars can't detect it I doubt that Ubi could do the job. Maybe Microsoft and Sony will some far day find a solution
---
You mean crouch spamming isn't possible on controller?
---
You clearly haven't seen the original face.
---
plenty of games do that, just most AAA shooters have oversized hitboxes to make the game easier. See battlefield
---
http://i.imgur.com/smkFEiQ.png
---
he's right, the hitboxes are just made smaller.
---
Ubisoft already made the statement on this issue. I‚Äôm only saving them the trouble of repeating themselves 30 times in a row. If you have any further questions, I suggest you contact my supe-... Ubisoft instead of cluttering the forum.
---
Kinda sad i'm level 98 and just got it, but atleast I have one lol
---
Yeah, but by giving victim too much power, you would also be able to do it with added benefits.
---
He‚Äôs best used with another OP tbh, someone to shoot to nullify the sound of the torch whilst you use it or use it with Blackbeard and have him peak after you‚Äôve made the hole
---
see my last comment below, it is very simple to check the vendor and type a a device that is connected. the xbox is running a windows kernel. so it is not very difficult for them to block certain devices. 
---
The xim is connected via usb right ?
---
If the votekick fails, you can bet the target will frag the initiator when the game starts.
---
the acog glory days....
---
I'm amazed at how Smoke has made it this far without getting significantly nerfed (less canisters or less damage or range or duration of the gas, etc). I hope he stays untouched!
---
Buy the real thing, it's called Gerber Ding Dong, you get some exercise as well. ;)

All the while I thought those crouch spamming players were just being happy - they look so happy as they bounce up and down as they walk around - kind of like an emote.

Most of them. I believe I‚Äôve seen some connecting to the controller.

I got my first and only at lvl 151, I was lucky enough to get it for the c8 so thats amazing seeing as I only play with buck but still
---
Got my first one with level 150 lol
---
Fun fact: The first alpha pack I opened on my smurf was your unlocked black ice for the british shotgun ;(
---
I already proposed a system:
---
Make friendly fire off when the player is outside a certain radius of the enemy. Turn it back on when they are within that radius. It's like grenades. Grenades don't injure you or damage you if they're outside the radius, and will if you are in it. 
---
They could also use the Insurgency system, where I heard if you hit a friendly, you suffer the damage instead of them. 
---
There are solutions here, I have seen some interesting ones. However, whenever they are proposed everyone here acts like as if you insulted their mothers and said you don't want friendly fire. 
---
Friendly fire is a very delicate thing in an FPS, so it needs to be handled with a lot of care. How Siege has handled is anything but that.
---
Once i was in a 1v1 and got killed trough the shield kinda like this. 
---
Did you buy a game somewhere between Blood Orchid? I did, and also have something around 173 lvl and recently got all ops. Of course, it's not like I grind through all of them - 1 Season Pass plus bought few operators using money.
---
You can click on his head and he will die most of the time.

Lol at being accused of a ‚Äúcorporate shill‚Äù when simply stating facts. You are dealing with a delusional level of intellect, its best to just carry on your merry way. No conductor on this train, one way to looneyville. 
---
Would you have to toggle back to sprint? 
---
Just refresh the lisensing
---
That what they already do? Tachanka has received one buff already at the end of 2016 and is slated for a rework, Castle too despite being in a good spot in my opinion is on the table for getting buffed. 
---
Hell, look at at Glaz. He was rarely ever touched in professional play yet received an absolutely absurd buff with his thermal/IR fuckery scope. 
---
I see, thanks
---
Lol just get a better gun
---
 Can we get a video of these guys you accusing of mnk?
---
One yes you did say that dumbass. Two no that doesn't mean it's balanced for the lower levels. That doesn't make any sense at all.
---
Just one thing, on console, people can create unlimited accounts... so smurf or starting over is possible, every day!

So why not on PC?

try setting the polling rate to 1000hz via synapse or go into your settings.ini file in documents\my games\rainbow six and change your mousesensitivitymultiplier from 0.02 to 0.002 then tenfold your sens in game
---
Don't feel bad I have played the game since the beta and had not reallly taken seriously up until operation white noise ( I believe thats a season) and I have always felt like they penalized you the same when you lose even though you carried your team. Plus I do not like how they only factor in your rank and level when matchmaking and not your kd and win/loss ratio.

Add me @DivergentOwl0 I'll try to join up with you in an hour or so. As for your post, don't stress it, everyone sometimes drops below where they're supposed to be. You aren't bad.

I tried searching what he said he got but couldn‚Äôt find anything about it, Does anyone know?

yeah it'd be nice if she could get a notification on her screen or something.

Thank you so much!

I will try to do my best!

Never knew that was her name

Yeah, February 17th will be the soon.

Maybe some turning on options in steam ?
---
Rush and intel (jackal, lion, dokkaebi, etc). Rush isn't all that prevalent, although it's still there. With a rush, one would probably pick Blitz, Ash, a hard breacher, and a whole lot of boom. Intel's also popular, where you pick all of the ops that can gather info about the defenders, like Jackal with his foot fetish and Lion with his drone and so on. Defenders, roaming is the most popular, with Ela, Caveira, Frost, and so on being common picks. 
---
This glitch has lost my countless games 
---
How about two auto turrets place like maestro cams that do 3 dmg per hit? 
---
By bruteforce, a software that test all possibilities 
---
You should probably switch, other ops can do it better
---
I dont know if im just lucky or what but I have 1200 hours and have never had this glitch happen to me, certainly have had other glitches happen to me so im not too skeptical though
---
or maybe not using steam..
---
Did you logged into uplay website or application? 
---
There are no smurfs! Ubi added two factor authentication it must just be you being bad! Ubi would never allow this behavior

My best Finka Rez was on an Ash that proceeded to ace. Never said anything though... hurt me deep down.

Operation health 2 : electric boogaloo
---
You mean the system that CSGO has? It would be very cool in this game as well.
---
Conceptually, yes, but practically, no. Native MnK is better enough than most console inputs (at most levels of play) that this just wouldn't work. I'd like to play R6 with my buddies on PC, but it would suck. 
---
None at all, dumb people who main recruit or think it‚Äôs funny to play him would whine for like a day then everyone would move on, if everyone had all the base game ops there would be no reason to play him. 
---
Sounds like a good change to me
---
Well they can make a full rework like they did with Hereford : a new map with the same spirit
---
Is that Jackie Chan's grandfather in the passport picture?
---
It did blind me that time. I just got lucky and hit him while blinded
---
The most prevalent attack mix I‚Äôve seen lately is Ash, Jackal (mainly cause I love Jackal), Hibana, Maverick, and Twitch which is honestly a really rush oriented team.
---
As for D.. Lesion, Jager, Echo, Kaid, and some other operator this usually changes.
---
Gives you info, breach prevention, and a foamier, and a hard anchor.
---
I don't think that really fits. Especially if their one shot kills. 
---
Oh man I remember how wonky Captiaos recoil was, and yet I still mained him. I miss old Siege quite a lot
---
are you telling me that this game isn‚Äôt shit lately?
---
and sure, it probably is just fucked up hit ref
---
Also on PS4 you can use a SHARE button to the left of your sensor panel to make a screenshot.

Castle is an American in America

Praying for more maps &amp; less ops so I can get back into one of my favorite series. 
---
Yeah I went a long time without it, at first it was only I couldn‚Äôt hear my gun being fired, but with each update it gets worse and worse. 
---
I‚Äôm also on console, so maybe that has something to do with it 
---
Honestly I mostly play a reserved patient playstyle but let me tell you this, recently as soon as I complete my weekly challenges I play WAY too aggressive. From my experiences it does seem like the game favors aggression a hell of a lot more nowadays. Last few days Ive had my best matches all month. Well until someone leaves and the shorthanded team loses but thats not important right now. 
---
I like the V308 and I'm surprised Ubisoft hasn't considered reducing the magazine size. It's not going to compete with the likes of the R4-C, F2 or C7E, but it's very controllable with a Flash Hider and Vertical Grip and has reasonable damage and RoF.
---
Yeah guess so ^^ I dont know the system and it seems kinda redundant as there are no different operators or do you mean the perspective of a player? 
---
They'll do 3 dmg per hit maybe have a slow fire rate like maestro laser cam. 
---
Comparatively pubg  made over 1 billion and that game is just an absolute clusterfuck on console.  Frame rate problems, de sync issues, falling through the map. I stopped playing months ago so it may have gotten better. Also this year insurgency sandstorm (which is a direct competitor) to siege is scheduled for xbox ps4 release in first quarter so hopefully that will up the onus for ubisoft. 
---
also on defense, spawnpeaking will get you at least one round win probably. Unfortunately its dirty but effective.

Dude, I'm 16 and I have one of the shittiest rigs ever made. I work at McDonalds and work 20 hours a week which comes out to about $175 after taxes. 20% of that goes towards getting a better car. 75% goes towards car insurance and a phone bill. The other 5% I use for spending time with my girlfriend. How am I supposed to pay for a microphone? People like you will just bitch me out for having a shitty mic saying "Get a better mic they're only $20 on Amazon."

I don't think so cuz in thunt ur gadgets doesn't change so he will c4 and barbedwire only

You mean you don't have it or its fine from your inventory?

Exactly! I mean the game isn‚Äôt even THAT old yet...
---
They made voiclines for every op and different gadgets 
---
Depends on if you want people to call you shit at the game for using Blackbeard. You get used to it, but it kinda sucks at first.

What do you actually propose be done?

Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Bro, this is as litty as titties. High-key want to download it lol
---
I support the idea and it should reduce the current problems.
---
On the other hand, look at what they did with Hereford... It wasn't a good map, but it quite possibly got even worse after they reworked it... Not sure if that's the way to go either.. 
---
Love it man, I bought that headgear recently since it's one of my favorite looks I've seen in the game.

Drones are so cute.

i want a buck headgear where it's like a hockey mask but like the newer version

Doesn't matter. It would still be fun and in the process, Ubi might find a solution.

* Let him shoot in 360 degrees around him.
---
* Let him be able to duck on the turret.
---
* Make his turret have ZERO recoil.
---
* Give him Fuze's LMG.
---
* Give him an ACOG.
---
* Let him carry two turrets so other teammates can mount them.
---
* Make turret disassembly faster so he can reposition better.
---
* Make the breakable shield cover his body and legs too.
---
* Let him use the LMG as secondly (replacing the handgun).
---
They didn't talk about op health 2, ubi spoke about doc because he said roadmap abstinensis like it's a disease
---
An old seasonal skin 
---
completely agree.
---
This happened to me in a ranked match before, it is very frustrating. 4 v 1 on bank.  Three of us were waiting to breach the garage.  Thermite took it down and we had 5 seconds left.  Our 4th player died, and the 3 of us literally could not enter site to plant because as soon as we walked in it would teleport us back out.  We ended up losing the round because of this stupid glitch.
---
Okay, but everyone has different tactics and stratagems, and different operators work better or worse with them. Operator choice isn‚Äôt objective, it‚Äôs subjective. And yeah, there‚Äôs always the meta, but the meta is a bland playstyle for a person who wants to have fun in the game, not win every time.
---
I want them to make operation vitality and have it be basically the same but hopefully more successful. I think calling it health 2 brings bad luck :P
---
Locking new players at lower levels would only make it worse. Smurfs are bad at low ranks so forcing them down where they do the most damage would only make things worse. It would also defeat the point of a ranking system, as good players would be locked down to play against worse players. Making the original problem worse and also making it less fun for them as they won't have competition.
---
I had one dude trying to shit talk me while I'm the last one alive and leading the team. Next round, shit talker TK'd me. Before I quit, I mentioned to the other team that our team was a bunch of morons and same dude tries to tell everyone I "said the N word and he had to do something."

Why are we still here? Just to suffer?

Zofia
---
 \- I would wait on Lion until his rework is announced officially, no sense in getting used to him and then having them change him up.  
---
 \- Zofia is the best general purpose op out of those listed.  Soft breach, plus concussion grenades.  A claymore to protect your flank, and she can get herself up after being downed (granted with only 1 HP)  
---
 \- Dokk is great if used properly (and in coordination with a team), but RIP her claymore and true primary...
---
 \- Finka is a good op but non-essential  
---
 \- Ying can be very powerful if used properly, but she's not a favorite of the community (not the best guns).  
---
That shit was hype as hecc

I was talking more about the competitive OW subreddit, and their normal sub isn't really much worse than this one. 
---
I missed op health and I am not saying they didn't add the ops but how did they catch up in year2?
---
It depends how big the gap is, if you have 1000 more deaths than kills you‚Äôll need to go positive loads before it climbs, not saying you have that gap just thought lol
---
no problem

Hello HyelloWorld, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aiefhy/game_keeps_crashing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I've had this happen all the time, absurd..
---
Guess I have to stand up to make the kill official somehow.
---
Depends on nature of the message, its more harsh for racism and hate speech. 
---
They're responding to a comment about a fake medical condition. They're just playing along, not giving hints. If they commented independently about doc then I would think it's a Op Health 2 hint.
---
How big the map is would take so long to make, I'll probably just do one floor. 
---
They scratched the polish map but added Ela in Blood Orchid and Zofia in White Noise as 3rd ops.
---
The way the video end..... just barely a second to feel relief and scared at the same time
---
Lower your sensitivity and between 3 -5 days depending on how much you play you will be back in the gist of things. 
---
Yeah. Enjoy getting second place in the +50 points race then.

Ah ok

Thanks!

They already said that there would be no Operation Health (n+1). Plus, it‚Äôs not needed. Probably something big Doc-related is on the way.

Or (most likely) Ubi were just making jokes on one of the commentators being ill or something. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention.

Times it is acceptable - When someone TK's, when someone is being really toxic in chat (especially if they have a fortnite icon on PS4), when they're the only one who doesn't go recruit, when somebody is hacking
---
Times it isn't - randomly, when someone is a squeaker and you can hear their family in the background (as tempting at it is) and when one person goes recruit and nobody else.

Oh, sorry, wrong one.

It's going to take more kills to rise it the more you have played.

I haven't played all that much but i'm so consistently inconsistent at the game (and life).

For real I can have 10-0 and 0-6 games in the same play session.

Dude just hop into casual
---
heh, ironically they only did that after caving to people asking them to allow them to purchase it sooner during Christmas season. 
---
But you can still buy ash elite with the rest of the elites
---
lol you are not a true plat player. u destroyed low golds congrats. 2 of them literally stood with their whole bodies open to get shot without peaking the corners like a plat would. This is borderline cas play. Hitting plat and staying in plat are 2 very different things

Actually ubisoft did respond on twitter recently saying they were looking into it.

Chankas as well

I wouldn't mind Year Health with just balancing/reworking of both operators and maps.

siege.facts said it could be Operation Health 2.0

You might not be expecting what you get.

Literally only used this for reference

Ok cool. When we used the drones to locate the container the enemies would be in the room with the container and then as soon as the match started it said ‚Äúenemy detected outside‚Äù and they were all under the map 
---
No, we don‚Äôt need anymore maps removed. Learn to play the maps.
---
If this aint skyscraper im eating my balls off
---
I've noticed if you click on an operator just as someone else claims them you'll get bounced to some random operator. Maybe that's what happened here?

uhm, boathouse?

Its pointless glitch they were just trolling

Yeah. I never realized her pistol had the sharp falloff persinally so i always struggled with her as i never umderstood why i didnt down them lol. I think this change will let me play the way i like. Should be a lot of fun. 
---
That's some next level shit

Thanks I'll try it out. I think I'm going to get maverick and use the m4 with the suppressor as I think it fits his stealthy style.

Once I played Thermite on Bank and they were in Archives so I went to blow into objective through the Open Area office. I placed down the charge then detonated it and all that happened was the reinforcement disappeared and it became a soft wall. We lost that round cause we didn‚Äôt have time.

Wow such legend, much alpha pack. Good charm, lots great

Idk, Tilted Towers?

Doesn‚Äôt matter to me

which one is the free and which one the lootbox one?

i have both and i dont now which is which

Lol, I must admit I've been playing buck more lately and I can only think of the CAMRS but I hate dmrs
---
No you idiots it‚Äôs clearly house
---
It sure is nice when a fuze cluster I couldn't fucking hear hits me in the bloody face
---
Completely agree on the smg 11. Need to try out the Bering. I miss that gun
---
I can understand that, I'm the opposite. I prefer droning, being patient and holding angles, I like the strategic side of siege. Also it all depends on what map you use him on, a map like club house he will be very ineffective but a map like border he will be effective 
---
I like dmrs, but only blackbeards... On house... In treehouse... That's it... 
---
I think I‚Äôve seen attackers win like 4 games total on fortress since it came out. Shit is so one sided it‚Äôs wild
---
In mine &amp; my friends opinions there‚Äôs way too many operators now. We absolutely LOVED this game year one &amp; two, but something about three killed our favorite game for us. Now we barely game together let alone play Siege. We all agree ther s just way too many unnecessary ops &amp; not enough good maps. We all wish there was a season 1 playlist for us to actually have fun again. I‚Äôve bought every year pass &amp; completely wasted this year‚Äôs barely playing. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll push the button on the Year Four pass if it‚Äôs the same format of dlc. 
---
But house isn't in ranked :'(
---
Exactly 
---
God, fuck tower. That map is such absolute garbage
---
Isn't it something like C8?
---
We need more Latin American Operators either Mexican, Bolivian, Colombian or Argentinian. 
---
Also I hope to see Belgium operators
---
And the silvers became coppers...
---
This art style is so much better than sau-siege. Please keep this up

Listen to my flair. His gun is the second hardest hitting gun in dps, first is Fuze ak. But jackals gun is very accurate and a decent 30 mag, if you're bad at aiming then his pdw is for you, same recoil and rate of fire, 20 more bullets, less damage. His gadget is decent but isn't that useful
---
ya they are merchandise from the Koyo store
---
ACOG w/e

I thought it was something like C8CRS but I'm not sure

What movie is this

There are sites that you can use as a 2fa, Sites like authy.com or Lastpass will work.

Jokes on you, I'm just a Finnaboo.
---
That's because hands have the same damage modifiers as the torso now. They used to block damage to the chest, back when the damage was lower, but they didn't feel like/have the budget to make the hands penetrable like in CS so they just made them 1x damage instead.
---
I didn't know the situation could heal people

King George is the most well known black beard hater. He has expressed his feelings about black beard any chance he gets

Not that good for 5 people tactical squad, but still good.

One of the best gun? True.But you will be spotted due to that long barrel.

Gadget? Smoke is important for planting.

Shotgun secondary? Perfect.

Ability?it actually have long rage that you can open the floor and scan the foot print on it.
---
Yeah, I see where you come from. I must admit I love a good blitz ying rush but I do drone thoroughly 
---
True but the r4 has trash irons and is good because ash has no hitbox. R4 is actually decently mediocre statwise. Can‚Äôt argue the f2 but big difference between the Alda and the f2
---
Came to the comments looking for this, was not disappointed! GLORY GREATEST COUNTRY!

You are have a big stupid not mute main &gt;:(

Give Ela impacts again,

MEGA
---
Thanks 
---
Ok thanks
---
Oh no
---
C8-SFW, just had a quick google
---
Because then you can get active information on your drone. If you have a drone watching a flank route and non of your team mates are dead to in order to be on active cams / you are playing solo. You can see if anyone has taken out your cam without having to check your phone yourself which can leave you vulnerable. 
---
I‚Äôve wanted this for a while
---
People like that are my worst enemies, but a well placed C4 or good angle always finds a way to shut them down 
---
I switch between them every few games. I like both quite a bit. 
---
I found it. Name is reprisal. But like I said it‚Äôs horrible 
---
Ummmmm tower right?
---
Magnum. Less practical, more satisfying.
---
Calm yourself Mr Peanutbutter!
---
Yikes
---
I love getting those one taps with it 
---
Ahh, you just saved me and the other guy like 2 days trying to think of it
---
Remove theme park.
---
Kafe is good, even pro league plays it.
---
and the easiest solution is to make it so siege supports M+KB natively and has cross play for consoles would allow console players to play on PC with their friends and it would get the M+KBers out of consoles matches
---
The Alda also has trash irons but this is all opinion based so some people may like someone‚Äôs irons and some people might not. I personally don‚Äôt mind the R4 irons 
---
I think it's referencing Ready or Not as their ads all say "Soon" as of now so it's a bit of a meme.
---
It‚Äôs quite a hassle to recode things to be server side from client side and vice versa 
---
Mag because you ain't no bitch!

Is it R6, thats what it says in the top left at least

Yeah, they're a bitch to defend against but so funny when I get a message saying I'm only good for blitz

Hello stripyachtzee, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aiftlf/chex_mix_plays_rainbow/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Not gonna lie, when I realised I forgot it, it really bugged me. Had to find out
---
Yep it‚Äôs awful apart from the bank scene.
---
Magnum, but you have to yell "I'M A COWBOY, BABY" every time you get a kill with it
---
I can only agree. On an individual bases no operator is truly bad or imbalanced. But all combined it turns the game into soup.
---
Don‚Äôt be silly
---
god what a hunk
---
FFS, no Ela, thats enough. Ubi needs to give Ela impacts again,
---
Make ELA GREAT AGAIN
---
It‚Äôs awful apart from the bank scene just type in bank scene and save yourself the time 
---
HAHAHA it's house lol u guys just guessed wrong no one plays this for real except me I'm the only one that knew what map it was
---
acog is 2.5 on this game 
---
It‚Äôs clearly house. Do you not keep a boat in your garage??
---
Pro League isn‚Äôt just the teams you see on Twitch every league. There is a massive amount of teams out their playing competitively on a weekly basis hoping to maybe make it there some day. 
---
Plus these are the people who play the game more than anyone. They understand the meta better than anyone. They were the ones screaming that Lion was broken before we ever saw him. They are ones telling the devs that their new maps like Hereford and Fortress are ass. I wish they‚Äôd listen to them even more tbh. 
---
Yep, you add a lion into the mix then somebody going to leave eventually 
---
Scrolled through all the comments and nobody said where it actually was lol
---
#basement
---
DeyCallMeSplashh on youtube
---
Probably a keyboarder 
---
He's one goodlooking son of a gun.....
---
They gave you Toilet Paper because you got shit on!
---
Only the best Montys (and co) use the swagnum :)
---
I very rarely have a 3 man
---
C is the least competitive group. Mockit have been playing terrible this season and MantisFPS is still not caught up with the META. 
---
I do. And just 5 minutes snippets is fine.
---
Nah its de_dust 2
---
Yeah, I'm always on my phone when I'm on redditüòÇ 
---
DBL Online, but I thought anything can be done to his channel. I think he is the most popular one with glitches, but its always good to have something to report to ubi and make memes
---
Dust II
---
I'm still doing my placement on the Smurf. But Gold 2 on my main, I usually float around Gold 2 and Plat 3
---
It‚Äôs that DBL Online guy
---
having a primary gadget and attachments is much more viable. recruit needs removed 
---
Try and find some friends to play it with or find a squad on an LFG because it can be hard to have fun solo queueing when you‚Äôre first trying to learn 
---
oi dickheads pick up the shrimp you fat cunts
---
'course Rook is the first one you lumpy piece of shit
---
Ahh, if you're eu/xbox do you wanna play some time? 
---
I can tell you don‚Äôt like having fun
---
P9 for winning, Magnum for laughs
---
Repost
---
Guess you never mrit huh?
---
Hibana
---
then take IQ and shoot the drones. he has plenty of counters. just because you can‚Äôt kill him doesn‚Äôt mean he needs a nerf 
---
Use Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt to memorize the layout of the game's maps and learn the locations of hatches, objectives, and soft walls.
---
I'm EU but Ps4, would of otherwise 
---
Heres hoping it gets hot patched soon
---
What happens in the dark side, stays in the dark. 
---
I hope this is a joke
---
Not cab got nerfed
---
Then how don‚Äôt you see these MnK guys all the time?
---
Oof, nevermind that then, I need to go to sleep cus I got a long school day tomorrow XD. Good luck on siege man! 
---
Wtf
---
And I swear that I don't have a gun
---
I‚Äôm not sure right now, but the outbreak one will have the outbreak symbol in the upper left of the operator card, and I think it‚Äôs the tan themed one
---
do you really need to ask this question. it‚Äôs obviously only for developers. so be a developer to get it. this is just dumb 
---
This is an amazing animation/drawing. And it has to coastline right ???!?!??!
---
It‚Äôs been doing that for every new bundle lately. Just reboot the game. 
---
Woosh
---
Do you have a image of the new logo ?
---
I probably do, just dont know they are, which is why I figured video would be able to tell. 
---
And you

Rubber banding is the act of moving forwards and then getting teleported backwards again as if you're being pulled back by a rubberband. Whether it's client/server desync or ping issues is irrelevant.
---
i can tell you don‚Äôt like helping your team or understanding common sense 
---
Same, i hated bfV, i love Bf1
---
Wrong
---
Just quit being a pussy kid
---
How tf do I send you a video
---
I‚Äôm not complaining because that was a PC exclusive and not I can have cool gear for thermite. 
---
Thanks senpai
---
It kinda sucks having to hear this in a response to one person who is basically an influencer in the R6 Community, rather than the actual community that had been vocal about this topic for awhile. 
---
Bell‚Äôlavoro
---
I was gonna say exactly this. 
---
Just edit the post to add video. 
---
If you purchased Starter Edition in the early days you had to not only buy ops but also buy attachments. I'm assuming that is where the difference lies. I ended up purchasing the standard edition through G2A for 24.99 so I ended up paying 40.00 for the full regular version. Not too bad.
---
I have soviet flag for months now ü§îü§î
---
One of the houses in a Sims game?
---
No rubber banding is connection issues...
---
It's very arcadey
---
get lost 
---
No
---
I only play recruit in cas when I have friends. The idea of the shield with 5.7 doesn‚Äôt use attachments and you can bring any kind of gadget.
---
Its not really that hard to understand 
---
Holy shit this is so good
---
neither does how fast that pistols shooting XD
---
happened to me the other day.  kept picking ash and it was only giving me black beard and i got stuck playing as BB.
---
