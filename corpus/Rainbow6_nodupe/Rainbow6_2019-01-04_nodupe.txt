But that's what makes it fun

All ping is good ping. 
---
Ying ripping them phat clouds. #VapeLife
---
Sorry, that's just what an offensive retreat looks like, not gonna turn my back on the enemy!
---
I believe in the past this has been due to reused faces between ops (which were previously covered in all other skins, hence it makes little sense for Hibana). But that might have been a lie
---
Nah this was long ago when I started playing r6.
---
That is exactly what I was proposing. 2 maps and one option labeled random (so 3 total options for the lobby to vote on) The exact same as COD. This issue has been figure out by every game except siege, for decades lol
---
A REALLY BIG FUCKING HOLE COMING RIGHT UP
---
Oooh
---
That’s the biggest cheat I’ve ever seen
---
That's $35,791,400 if you buy 357,914 credit packs at $100 each. 
---
*dies*
---
*Gruff voice* Big fucking onee-chan coming right up
---
Go to xboxdvr.com and search for your GT. There's eveb a 'post to reddit' button ;)
---
I'll explain this from experience of playing on SEAS and EU. Both are completely different servers and have the following differences.
---

---
1. SEAS players are absolutely brain dead and will meta spam every game above Gold 3. I used to play roamer and I  quit because I'd have to deal with Lion, Jackal, Dokkabi, Blitz and some other operator everytime I try to rotate. I switched to anchoring and it's even worse when Ying just walks in after Lion already has our asses grounded.
---
2. Hit registration is absolutely broken every day. I look back on recorded footage and there we go. Blood from the head but zero damage recorded. Meanwhile I get one body shot and die as a headshot with 100 health.
---
3. Sound is even worse. Oh you head them to your left? Wrong! They're right of you, except it's already too late. You heard them above you? No dummy, they're right behind you. Except it's Blitz and you're already dead.
---
4. Silent dropping is still not patched and might as well be a feature at this point. Watching a hatch to take a flank? Later you're team mates scream that they're on site (Kafe Red stairs hatch on 3F best example) and you didn't know because you can't hear them drop.
---
5. Client side debris and destruction. For fucks sake, when I tap a barricade I want the part to fall down or disappear. Not just balance there like the fate of the universe depends on it. But hey, my opponents perspective 95% of the time is a clean hole while I have a broken board balancing god knows how.
---
6. Rubber banding is still prevalent and you might as well add Tracer at this point. The number of times I've walked into site across a hole only to get rubber banded back has me vexed. On one occasion I couldn't plant on time because I kept rubber banding back to my previous position. Explain how that isn't broken.
---
7. Cheaters and macros are back in business again and Ubi can't even afford a decent anti cheat inspite of running a Pro League and being a AAA studio. 
---
8. Ranked and casual have been in the same pathetic stale state for over what 3 years now? Ranked hasn't seen any improvements. Casual still doesn't have site picking but hey I'm sure chat filter Mk. 3 will solve everything and make the game better. Nice move hiding player stats to disguise your broken MM system by the way Ubisoft.
---
9. Servers take a piss every once in a while and hurr durr my net is bad. No. My internet is fine. Your game just cannot handle loads during firefights and intensive moments. I could play on EU with ping below 100 in CS GO, but the minute I run Siege I get booted for having 40 ping in my native server. _lole op you have red icon bad internet lole_
---
I'd love to expand on all these points with proof from popular streamers and Pro League games but it's 5AM and I need sleep.
---
If the above isn't enough to showcase how bad Siege is currently and how it's utterly broken for a competitive game, man you're need to pull your head out.
---
I have nearly 1k hours, don't have them all.
---
This
---
NOh.
---
If you encounter another toxic player, record it and than send it to the mods or support team 
---
Instead it complaining about trolls maybe complain about them not fixing the game. 
---
Oh thanks, that is very helpful
---
Agreed. Even the Discord is a fucking nightmare. Going there for games is like purposely trying to find toxic players to play with.
---
Honestly this video is why i prefer to 5 stack and avoid solo q at all cost on here. Especially with my experience on EU. It's just toxic. I generally can cope with Solo Queuing, the wild side of it. 
---
However some people just act like apes when a female voice speaks up, or shit goes south and they are looking to play the blame game.
---
Some people will go ahead and throw in fact Ps3/XBL cod days was even meaner and rough and it was. I was there for it all of it, was real great being called hard R every time i spoke. 
---
But does that mean we should keep these shitty behaviours up? Not really. Just watching the sexual harassment was cringe enough.
---
It also makes the experience of watching big streamers who are trying this game out unfun, especially with xQc right now. While he can be toxic there are times when he isn't people just throw shit at him, TK'ing or just being rude towards him. 
---
Would really love to see UBI do something over time. 
---
John McDonald has said himself that it takes into account how you interact with Steam as a platform as a whole, not just within CSGO. If you're an asshat in general, they know and match you with other asshats. It's a wonderful system. Ubi would be hard pressed to do it at the same level of granularity due to only having game data, but it would be leaps and bounds above what we have now.
---
Yeah i got 2 packs as well. 50k in the bank. Weird. 
---
Not complaining. 
---
Everyone needs to upvote this to the top of the subreddit. People need to see!
---
Agreed. Great book.
---
Can you explain how to do it please?
---
this is why we need a ww3
---
I've been playing for 10+ years, so back it up there kiddo. Just throwing your hands up and saying "gamers will be gamers" is part of the fucking problem. And its not about ruining my mood, its about literally being unable to play the game. If 1) speaking up gets you team killed because you are a woman, and 2) not speaking up gets you killed because you aren't communicating, its not about having someones feelings hurt and is literally about being unable to play the game, (not even getting into the fact that people pay actual money for this). Again, why is team killing a bannable offense? Why don't people like you rush to defend team killers unless the person being affected is a woman, in which case ya'll come out of the woodwork? Like sure, posting this video isn't going to change things overnight, but the reluctance of people like you to even having a conversation is part of the reason things are as bad as they are. Showing R6S to people is a fucking embarrassment.
---
The one time I tried showing this game to someone, people were spamming racist bullshit into mics. I don't show people R6S anymore. Yes its an 18+ game, and yes its just words and it doesn't change anything, but its still a fucking embarrassment.
---
And again, all the non-sexist non-racist things you mentioned are also complained about, but why does no one ever defend the griefers there? People just say it sucks, UBI plz fix, then joke about how Ubi sucks. But as soon as its about a woman or minority, the "man up" police shows up.
---
And please don't strawman this, I'm not and almost no one is saying that its just about people's feeling should be protected, if so, people would be posting videos of teammates saying mean things, but that isn't what is happening, people are complaining about a systematic problem that both negatively impacts certain individuals disproportionately while also making this hobby worse. The fact that I can't go to certain game shops with female friends to sit down and play a board game b/c of creeps, the fact that I can't in all honesty show a co-worker certain video games without worrying that someone will shout "nigger" while I'm showing it to them, the fact that I can't play certain games in common spaces without headphones, etc are all problems worth addressing even if I am a selfish asshole. Yes, its always been a problem, but so was polio, maybe its time to start fixing it rather than sticking our head in the sand.
---
When I try doing that I get sniped from some window/angle I didn't even think about, always a 50-50 chance to die to something.
---
It's a huge ass map but no line of fire longer than 1m lol For me it's the worst  map, even worse than Tower. Yeah Tower had many rooms as well but you not too many hiding spots. Here in each room you have tables, chairs, etc  
---
Everybody wins defense and the deciding factor is who gets it first on def again.
---
Sounds a lot like Pengu tbh, he got told off by ubi for being toxic and have him an ultimatum iirc
---
Its caused by getting multiple people to shoot an unreinforced wall and the fix is to change any graphical setting and it will go back to normal.
---

I only play ranked, its all i ever played.

Win eight rounds with rook on the team

For me, it look a lot like "maréchal, nous voilà !" the national anthem during the second war 
---
I wanna fuck the absolute hell out of Hibana if you catch my drift fellas 😎 
---
Also Dokkaebi, Ash, Caveira and IQ
---
Worst part is there’s no repercussions on Xbox

My guess would be with the first year 4 op

Hello rook_rikk, your submission has been removed as it appears to be a question about the Holiday Pack issue.
---
The issue with redeeming 25,000 renown has been resolved, as per [@Rainbow6Game](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) on Twitter:
---
&gt; The Holiday Pack has been fixed!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If you own all operators, you can now correctly convert the Holiday Pack for 25K Renown. If you already opened it and received an error message, your pack will now work as intended. [^Source](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1080919098157031429)

It's a shame that so many people are abusing this glitch in ranked, we only used it rarely when we were messing around on casual/private and would never have done it for personal gain. 
---
Buck, Hibana and Echo are all very good

For me, it look a lot like "maréchal, nous voilà !" the national anthem during the second war

you know the collaboration and all of that ...
---
Eh better I suppose
---
No more Americans please,neither do i want to see more French,Russian or British operators,i want actual new countries my dream Y4 content would be Australian SASR (Most likely gonna happen) Czech URNA or 601 SkSS,Slovakian 5th SOR,Finnish  UTJR,and lastly some Balkan country,if at least 2 of those get confirmed ill definitely buy year4 pass
---
Yeah I understand this, its just that back then I aasnt aware of that and I decided to just let it slide.

I believe as my man Russian Badger has also been one to and I quote “Micheal Jordan” in an FPS game. It was one of his BF4 videos.

#Same problem different developers???
---
Yeah I’ve gotten lucky on PS4 and found a couple people to play with. It still happens though. Bullying has always been bad on online shooters. I’m just glad we’re past the days of having to find some clan/guys hosted server and playing on it. I do not have fond memories of some servers in CS 1.3
---
Just own it. If they can't interact properly then mute the fuckers. Nothing like radio silence for stalking. 👍

I main cav too. I wish i could say scary things in a girl voice when I land an interrogation. I also wish the intero'd person could hear the cav on mic for that second. Haha just out of no where "gonna get ya peanut butta" 
---
looks like a monster from the Dead Space games xD
---
Yeah the siege community is pretty crummy but we have to be there for the girls who get harassed and the people who tk randoms. But if there’s any girls who play r6 on Xbox and want to squad up just to have someone in there game, don’t even have to speak that’s cool. GT: FourFire650061
---
You're lucky to have a friend with you! I have been playing for over a year now and this still happens to me so often that I usually only play when my dad's best friend is home from work so I have a vote to keep me. 
---
In my opinion, return team killing doesn't do any good. It is basically feeding the trolls. If it happens all I say is "at least wait for someone to place their gadgets and reinforce before you team kill" then I report for toxic behavior, report them through Xbox for unsporting behavior, then leave. If I'm not the one who was team killed I still  report the team killer. If my teammates are constantly harassing one person, I send that person a message and tell them to exit to lobby and invite me to a match and I go play with them. 
---
Try to spread kindness instead of letting the assholes feel like they're winning. 
---
She’s like one of them inflatable things at car dealerships that flops around all willyknilly like
---
As all things, umm, could be
---
That’s a lie but ok. No one would consider pro without having played ranked for many seasons. No one goes pro from playing just casual or being plat 3 lmfao.
---
Rank really means nothing lol. I have achieved Diamond 8/12 seasons and I'm nowhere close to being a good competitive player. The closest I have gotten to actual competition was subbing in for scrims against then Ferocity eSports and then IDK (now Secret). Got 1-5'd and 3-6'd respectively. 
---
A lot of pros avoid Ranked now too simply because of how different it is from the PL settings. Just cause players like Pengu and Canadian grind Ranked doesn't mean all do. 
---
If you look for players LFT in the semi-pro scene and up (think cusp of CCS), rank is a non-factor. Experience playing comp and how well you perform in a team environment matters so much more. I remember people were giving Nicks on ExG shit because he peaked plat 2 yet he's better at comp than most diamonds including myself. 
---
Ja Blitz ist ein Problem.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Oh shit
---
I actually disagree with you on the clip linked. He's not doing anything to promote toxicity besides being funny. He's not insulting them, or t-bagging, or teamkilling. He's just playing in a ridiculous way. 
---
Is downranking to play with newer players a shitty thing to do? Sure. But this isn't new for any game and if nothing else, the ones killed are going to learn from it as to not let it happen again. 
---
Elite operators having fucking seizures to dodge bullets.

I *strongly* believe that this glitch improved the game

tbf XQC is a toxic little twat tho, his opinion shouldnt matter here
---
&gt;I'm glad that this issue got resolved! I thought I wouldn't get my renown lol.

Jackal and Dokebai are both good anti roamers.  If you're looking for defense Mira and Maestro are good anchors.  If you like roaming Caviera and Vigil are super good.

Yeah I see. It's bs
---
Toxicity is part of online gaming culture since the dawn of time. If you don't like someone, just mute them.
---
Sad but true
---
My dad made me a deal and said 8f i read the book first then he'll buy me the game.
---
What is your rank? Also, i agree that it is a big problem on console. I think they should make it so the search for a game wont start if m&amp;k is detected.
---
I really don’t but I don’t think it’s that big of a deal this game has terrorists in it

The ash charge still blows up. Whether it's on a surface or not. 
---
“Dude what the fuck”
---
Yep
---
Maybe if you were able to locate it but if you shot at it with a shot gun wouldn’t you just be putting a hole in the wall just like ash was about to do?
---
Would be interested to see if you could wallbang it tho
---
Honestly, there are so many assholes who think that because they themselves aren't the target of toxicity based on their gender or race, this game doesn't have a problem. A lot of people who have accents or with higher voices (girls/younger players) are verbally assaulted because they decided to use voice chat for call outs. The game seriously needs a system to address voice chat toxicity.
---
It still isn’t fixed on ps4
---
The charge falls to the ground and blows up there 
---
I just love how Siege and RL are the only two games I’ve heard of on that list. Being an Xbox boy it sure does make me proud to see Sony not promoting their “decent” content rather promoting games people don’t actually take much interest in.

He probably turned it off in his HUD options, just as he removed team member names

My friend and I use steelseries. He has a lower end one and mine is mid range but both are great.

&gt; uplay accounts should be closed so they can play the games they already own but can't add any new.

Ubisoft would never implement that, they'd make no money that way.

Most of Clancy's books and many of the games are in the same universe
---
The Jack Ryan and John Clark (which includes Rainbow Six and the games) books are linked, as is Splinter Cell and HAWX.
---
Only thing that isn't IIRC is End Game and The Division
---
R E A L I S T I C
---
It will be the most sovietic thing i've ever seen
---
Oh yeah, and play some t hunt (turn off aim assist if it isnt already, cause in multyplayer its automatically turned off)
---
Try to stop making aim adjustments with your left stick.
---
Do more with your right stick.
---
And as someone said before, turn off vibration
---
Well TKs usually occur with a person aiming in on their head after correcting their aim to do so, I never do that on accident
---
You might just be unlucky, Whenever I play Casual and come up in tower, It's always a fun game because you know a lot of people miss it from ranked, and by miss I don't mean they used to love it. I personally absolutely hated it, but just like Favela when It returned, It'a great experiencing the map back again
---
No, he means for all ops, like if it was kaids birthday you wouldnt be able to get the charm bc you didnt have the op

Dota does well too, with mandatory low-priority games.

Capitão is Y1S3. Also you didn’t reply to me.
---
No my bad the way I read it was he was being payed to boost
---
And the third guy has 0 kills and 8 assists because he mains Twitch and Lesion only
---
I got the game when it was in Pre-Builds and my version says Standard Edition.
---
I dont even play this game any more cause I'm so over the toxicity. It doesnt happen every game but still frequent enough that it ruins my mood. I use to play for hours every day / week. Now its once a week, the games already plagued with other issues and then toxicity raises its head and I shelve the game.
---
I'm over being killed cause I took "your operator", or cause I want to "flex a new elite skin", or cause I failed to clutch. Fuck this game.
---
I think an operator with incendiary grenades and or a dragons breath shotgun 
---
They also let you assign extremely racist names, you can say whatever you want in voice chat and text chat and try to make people's ears bleed without worry and cheating so fucking rampant that it even makes it to a professional level.
---
Trust Factor doesn't mean very much.

Still trying to finish Red October, Tom Clancy certainly doesn't write short books. But I have made tons of progress in the last couple of days and can attest that Tom Clancy is a great writer.
---
Hermano! Usas el :v nice
---
Mine still doesn’t work 
---
Huh, still kinda new to the game so I didnt know that was an option.
---
But on top of that with that logic YouTube’s can’t play ranked with friends lower ranks then them because they get payed
---
Keep in mind that people who say that apply the exact same thing to racist murder and rape in real life. 
---
Do they even give the full amount that it cost in the store?
---
I would agree but it takes Ubisoft a decent while to fix stuff. If they could add all these things during an actual season that would be dope but I personally don’t see it happening. 
---
I’m not a console player but I fee for you about the MnK stuff, shit must suck.
---
Last week there was a 11yo boy in my team insulting like :"tachanka you son of a ..." and telling me the n word and i was like :"did you just insulted the lord tachanka??"
---
I don’t understand how you can group this to one race though, EVERY server is toxic, and you’re always going to have your teamkillers, if you don’t like it play in a squad it’s that simple.
---
you mean you have a macro set to spam crouch or just have a button set to crouch
---
The R6 PL chat is actually a joke. They have practically no moderation unless it's an absolutely massive event like the invitationals, and even then the moderation is sporadic. They'll pop on, do a banwave, and then leave chat to fester for 30 minutes.
---
In addition, half of the moderators are just popular streamers like Macie Jay, or casters who are actually working like Interro, and they either don't have the time or have no reason to care about how bad chat gets.
---
It's embarrassing dude, you'll have the finals of one of the biggest LANs in R6 going on and the chat is just dominated by a thousand morons insulting the players. All because neither Twitch nor ESL nor Ubisoft give enough of a shit to do anything about it.
---
Wrong or not, still the only one to say something, should of just been quiet.

It basically is. I’m forced to use his SMG but it’s very weak so overall he has super limited fragging potential which is why I think he needs a third claw. Maestro is awesome though so get him 
---
Do you consider yourself a good player?
---
Do you know all maps (or most of them) good enough to know flanking routes and spots?
---
If both is yes, hop onto some ranked. Thats the best way to get better. 
---
Best is to never play casual cause its cancer. 
---
And always rmember: rank doesnt fucking matter. But a little bit of combetativenis is always better. (if you know what i mean)

Twitch drone against a downed defender or someone low enough

But that gets rid of all communication with teammates with is pretty much vital for good gameplay

In theory the bullet proofness moves with the animation. In practice, it’s very inconsistent

If you like intense firefights I would highly recommend reading Matthew Reilly books. I haven't read R6 so I cannot compare, but I will say that the action is exciting, albeit over the top and a bit video gamey. Reading it will get your heart pounding like you're 1 kill away from clutching a 1v5 with the defuser down.
---
Jaeger is alright but lion is ridiculous 
---
Guys who act like this are the most basic bitches ever. You’re not masculine, you are sad and pathetic to treat women this way. 
---
Unfortunately, without better ways of reporting this type of player we’ll be stuck with these morons.
---
Also, I’ve played quite a few games with female players in NA and don’t seem to experience the severity that I heard in these videos as often. However, it’s definitely annoying sometimes.
---
In alpha he spawned in prep phase, hence his name.

Alright, I'd like to thank you for your advice. I will try my best to put it to good use!

No it doesn’t stay forward to avoid clipping, it is supposed to face where you look, when it doesn’t it’s the game buggy, go into a custom game, and have a buddy shield vault in you’ll see it face the right direction 9 times out of 10
---
Although I'm not a girl I've seen many female siege players get harassed in similar ways, anyone including myself who try to stand up and make the round less toxic get shit on just as much. It really is a messed up community.
---
Just change your shadow quality and it fixes it, cheating bastards
---
MnK is cheating bc people use adapters (XIM) but xbox has full support for developers to implement mouse and keyboard and thats what im talking about. 
---
Don't throw people like me in the same group with him. I might lose a lot (mostly due to shit teammates not watching angles to cover me), but I'm not a little bitch that hacks to feel better about himself. I try to get better and I admit when it's my fault when I fuck up.
---
I love Ubisoft games because of how non broken and nearly unhackable games
---
Nope.
---
My favourite is when I'm playing with my group, one of us gets TK'd and I give a "Mate, did you just try to bully a 4-man?"
---
They don't tend to stick around for long after that.
---
Wow reported
---
I think there is also a bit of confirmation bias that comes with this. The times people are shitty and team kill are the most memorable but most games are fine. 
---
Not saying it doesnt suck when people are shitty but it's not as common as everybody says.
---
That’s BS. 
---
A female friend of mine got so tired by these comments that she sold her Xbox, I feel you.

Hello cmstrength, your submission has been removed as it appears to be a question about the Holiday Pack issue.

The one thing is that MnK usually has quite a delay so it actually possible to beat them.

Of course this gets removed my god
---
Try joining the official rainbow 6 discord to find some nice people or alternatively play with friends or check out r/R6STeams 
---
Just my 2 cents on the subject. 
---
Toxicity is much worse on console. Coming from xbox to PC, I haven’t played on PS4. 
---
I agree with what people are saying, it’s not just ‘immature/young kids’. Its also grown ass adults who should know better. 
---
Smurf accounts are a big problem I find, people buy another account to smurf and they are *Typically* very toxic. spawn peeks, abusive language etc. They don’t care since its not their main account. 
---
Smurf accounts are by no means the entire problem, just a part of a larger problem. People suck. 
---
Or maybe one of the largest game developers have some intel on next gen consoles.....

And? Shouldn't shame people based off rank
---
No, they act in teams. Whenever I encountered them, it’s always four or five 
---
That’s the point of the statement. 
---
It's pretty clear the issue by and large are younger kids who think they're funny. 
---
Also, bullying/harassment whatever you want to call it 101, is just rolling with the punches, or learning to take a joke. 100% of people let them know they were getting annoyed, which only adds fuel to the fire. This is the most basic form of dealing with people who are bugging you regardless of gender.
---
It won't. Remember how long the Ps3 was still a thing after the Ps4 got released?
---
To be honest i think it will definetly bite the dust on console one day. While on pc it will live on for eternity.
---
All just ideas, we will see what will happen.
---
Fact is: The game is amazing. The idea is brilliant, and the best thing that could have happened to Clancy's work. So even IF Siege, dies one day, it wouldn't be the end. It would be the start, for more games with better engines and more complex possibilitys.
---
I posted a Youtube video with more depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWnjmId0WEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWnjmId0WEY)
---
You're attempting to argue that Ubi can't do a single thing about teamkilling? Are you acting stupid? 
---
It's funny I've recently been thinking of installing siege again and playing a bit. I always un install it for a reason and this reminds me to not even bother
---
all you siege rejects encouraging toxicity, no wonder why your game is dogshit competitively lmao
---
If Ubisoft wanted to do this originally, it would have happened upon release of the game. I see casual as a form of warming up or if I'm waiting for my friends to 5 man but one is AFK for whatever reason. I leave once all are back.
---
the reason i asked this question is because everytime i play with a white teammate they always bring race into it whether its a race joke or blatant racism i kno every white person isnt racism but it has happened way too many times for me
---
Unfortunately, the report button doesn't do anything about cheats and hacks.
---
Girl here. I used to play Siege religiously every night for two years. My squad fell apart after I had a baby, and I couldn't get back into solo-queuung because people always said this shit to me and it wasn't any fun. I haven't played the game for two years now. Makes me really sad. I even went from xbox to PC to play with my OW squad, but I was annoyed all my progress didn't transfer over to the PC account, so I just stopped. :(
---
Met who
---
God damn. Im a pc player and im lucky if i get 4 kills lol.
---
Using racism as a cause for racism bold strategy cotton
---
Owen 9
---
Its casual chill bro. Its not important
---
&gt; everytime i play with a white teammate they always bring race into it
---
Where are you from? 
---
Very true. You've given me hope, kind sir.
---
“You at all my mf beans ni🅱️🅱️a?!”
---
u/flame45888 
---
Yeah, I've only seen this 'barcode name' phenomenon in r6, not in any other online game. I'm sure its not so people dont statcheck them or anything, that'd be too logical.
---
Cry me a river when was the last time millions of whites bit the big one because of their whiteness. 
---
Bottom text
---
Potentially, idk.
---
Ubisoft needs to take Action in this situation, it angers me so much that people can just walk away with these things with little or no consequences. 
---
can you mark this as spoiler? I haven't gotten to the part where Santa is revealed as a fraud, so you kinda just ruined the game for me. Thanks asshole.
---
Mine sits above my tv where I play siege 😁
---
So what’s your play style? different operators work better with different play styles.
---
I’m an anchor so operators like cav don’t work for me. And I’m a support for attack so good with operators like thatcher or thermite.
---
Depending on how you play it could be beneficial if you chose an operator depending on how you play the game.
---
I feel really bad for you. So much toxicity because of something like gender is ridiculous. And the fact that all those people just say there and let you get harassed is even more ridiculous
---
It's a texture hack someone on the other team was using.
---
“We need to secure the hostage”
---
“Secure this, bitch”
---
Legitimate question, why didn't you get a score notification when you shot out the cam?
---
FeelsBadMan but Go agane
---
I tried to get into this game but the community was so fucking terrible 
---
I never even got my rank high enough for ranked 
---
Why does that even matter in a video game? Why do white people feel compelled to ask in the first place?
---
Pretty sure It was shroud who did this on stream
---
It's a brand new glitch if you change the shadows in your options it should fix it. Alternatively here is a video which explains the glitch and how to fix it skip to about halfway to get the fix for it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0XW-xJDR88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0XW-xJDR88)
---
Confirmed for me.  I got my 25k.
---
Whatever man, I have never claimed to be a good person or even better than anyone else really. Just that I believe in honesty, consistency and for the internet to keep its libertarian or even anarchistic-style identity and general philosophy of not letting corporations or governments have too much authority on how people express themselves or their speech even if it’s really ugly and distasteful. I’d rather let individuals sort it out amongst themselves... but I also don’t really care enough about this to debate my personal values on the Rainbow Six siege forums of reddit lol. 
---
Yes
---
Varsity gaming would be my number one pick. Matimi0 is another. 
---
They aren’t boosting the copper they’re using him to get better ranks than they deserve
---
Csgo has a complex and in depth machine learning program to determine trust factor
---
Well, few days ago I had a guy in ranked that picked only kaid/nomad and messed around with them instead of actually trying to win - had 0-0-5 stats. I finally blew up on voice and told him to pick sth he can actually help the team with and had the urge to TK him (i did not follow through). After that he actually did something in the next rounds while playing older ops. Since you are pribably tlking about casual, I only encountered TKs for nomad and kaid in the first week of new operation so no idea why it is happening.
---
idk, biohazard for the FMG-9 is okay
---
???
---
Even hacking he still has to use Jager. 
---
Keep down voting me snowflake. 
---
It's like a bad flashback to when the attachments and base operators became free. 
---
He beat it with a hammer until it straightened.
---
\*nods, tears running down\*
---
how he's even allowed to reconnect to that game is even more inconceivable.

---
I've experienced it with someone else's drone.
---
Yeah they will fix the game only when no one will play this shit no more.
---
Fuck i left my Counter Strike Global Offensive for R6S for almost two years. Is fucking unbelievable that every season this game have issues. Also seems that Ubi doesn't listen at all the community, because what is the purpose to open #R6FIX if the game it's still broken?
---
After Rainbow Six Siege, and other games, i don't think that i will buy their games soon. They sell just a bunch of Early Access games packaged like a final product. 
---
Oh great. 
---
Now fix the rest of your broken game ubi 
---
Killing the hostage once won’t result in ban
---
Hope this helps
---
It just did
---
What about if someone keeps killing teammates or purposely kills the hostage to throw. How would they be ‘told off’. It would be difficult for Ubisoft to tell if it was accidental or not.
---
The only side
---
You seem like a pleasant person 
---
That’s tuff, glad I can’t afford a pc
---
If you guys are on xbox, I've got a group of good folks that I play with that you would be welcome to join. 
---
Watching the video and reading comments like yours makes me remember why i left this game a long time ago. In the end this is a video game and it should be fun, not hurting people. Siege will never ever fulfill its potential, because Ubi won't do shit about toxicity. 
---
It shouldn't be that way though ubi could be doing more to combat it but they aren't and it's absolutely abysmal. Most of the times I want to go play siege I have to decide whether it's worth the headache and if im willing to risk this toxic community getting me pissed off for the rest of the day. I never have this problem with other games.
---
I asked where he's from, because I solo queue frequently in EU and everyone has different accents and trying to figure out who is black or gay or whatever is impossible through voice coms, so I was trying to understand how he is getting harassed over being black.
---
Here is a bit of advice. Don't trust anyone on this reddit when it comes to game balance, map balance or operator balance. Everyone here has these wacky, plain ridiculous views of the game due to only playing casual.
---
Oh hey if your joining make sure you read the welcome channel first!
---
Well it’s not fast enough to have recoil 
---
Its my fault that ubi wont do something about tkers? Lol csgo halo cod all have systems to punish tkers. But not r6. The fact is ubi values the tkers money over your enjoyment of the game. That will never change because ubi worships the almighty dollar. There will be no tk fix ever because ubi is a greedy trash studio run by fianance. Stop complaining and either play or move on.
---
Well i dont know what to tell you. I would say to report them but that usually doesn't work unless you are on pc. Which platform do you play on?
---
No I like abusing exploits for precious elo
---
It’s an exploit, you can fix it by changing one of your graphics settings, I think texture quality? There’s probably a YouTube video on it.
---
I understand that but maybe when the hostage is being carried they could implement a more forgiving system. 
---
Oof, ya got me. I forgot
---
No honestly you probably got a higher chance of getting shit items,(not really but for me that's how it feels)
---
Unless it works for ALL setting changes, it's only Shading Quality from Low to High or High to Low.
---
Am I the only one who thinks elite blitz looks like Macie Jay?
---
if you wanna play w/out getting hated on, i usually dont barricade anything until prep phase is done. honestly, just do your own thing while relaying sounds you hear (enemy positions, holes made, etc.) and personal position (if you know the map). If someone is still angry with you even after all these callouts, they’re being unfair and frankly a sore loser. I wouldn’t let their negativity cloud your mind. 
---
It's Shading Quality. But I'm willing to bet ANY Graphical Setting change will fix it.
---
Yup just found out the secret. Find a 3 wide soft wall , have the team dump A.R's into it for about 2 clips after round starts. Shit is a plague.
---
Apparently you've never seen weeb merch, have you?
---
There's some body pillows of the male ops too
---
I’m your 1k upvote :)
---
I bought it. Just waiting forbit be delivered 
---
the rule 34 artists are going to need a fresh pair of pants
---
If only there was a mute option.
---
no i didnt but i did get attempted with the dabbing backwards 
---
Lol people playing fps on console complaining.
---
You're totally right Haha. I forgot the first "season" was all the original operators, so I just went in order of releases. You'd think I'd know that considering I've been playing it since mira and jackals release in Velvet shell, but nope Haha. 
---
Yep pretty much, I play on ps4 was interested to see if this works on there might get a few friends to try in a custom game. Either way ubi needs to fix this asap. Like the castle glitch from last year...
---
Eventually, yeah..
---
I have, but r6 is not a fucking anime 
---
This is the most accurate thing I’ve seen to describe the Siege chat. 
---
I was within that range and he wasn't flashed at all so *shrug* game too inconsistent at times.
---
Appreciate the fix.  I've had this happen twice already in my ranked games.  
---
there's another way but Ubi needs to get off their collective asses to do it. 
---
Doesn't videos like this just encourage people to do it more?  
---
# Today I played 30 matches and about 75% of those matches there was a Purposeful Team Kill. I attempted to play Ranked but everyone who I found were too concerned about why I wasn't ranked and Several of those players were very Toxic after a lost in casual. I really enjoy playing this game but flying solo 90% of the time gets annoying after a while.
---
I'm sorry not everyone can afford $600+ gaming computers, so we have to make do with what we can get :/
---
At a convention you appear behind people asking "where's cav?" 
---
OH FUCKING HELL, NOW I FOUND BANDIT AS A FUCKING PONY
---
Always report barcode names and TK them for good measure if they’re on your team. 
---
It's generally a wooden wall with a large span. Best done with LMG users (Lord Chanka does work also).
---
From my experimentation with the glitch, it seems to be fixed by changing ANY graphical setting. But I didn't check ALL of them (Just Shading Quality, Texture Quality and LOD Quality)
---
This has been an on and off issue since Operation Health.
---
Add something like "come look, the SMG-12 recoil is back to the old recoil"
---
I miss that shit :(
---
You can barely see Zofia's face though? Unless I'm missing something
---
Completely understand but then expect to be disappointed.
---
It's like expecting to win a motorbike race on a bycicle.
---
It’s okay! How else do you learn!
---
Literally first round it started happening and I’m level 50 I think I understand the game fine thanks.
---
Try the solve here: [https://steamcommunity.com/app/359550/discussions/0/135508662495861213/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/359550/discussions/0/135508662495861213/)

Hackers on console 😂
---
i hope your karma tanks
---
Level 50, how cute.
---
I think with that kind of attitude it's no surprise you are getting killed.
---
No I was just wondering because I really don’t see it that often and then 3 games in a row out of. Nowhere 
---
After he masterbates vigorously  
---
Really? Always thought Maquis Twitch was beautiful, reminds me of Agent Carter
---
I think you're misinterpreting what I'm stating. I'm not arguing that a PS4 Pro should go toe to toe with a gaming PC. Obviously not. I'm just stating that people who use XIM are really killing the FPS scene on console
---
I hate to say it but a bandaid to the issue is playing ranked. Not so much for the descrimination aspect but for the team killing one. People are far less likely to kill teammates if it means losing rank. 
---
Also.... I have found that after getting into gold the siege community on pc is a bit more friendly than Xbox. Sharing the hell out of this video though
---
Did you fart? 
---
Oh man I hate that, at least he got a gold, I literally always get common after common!
---
Dude what?
---
Now you are being an asshole, sorry that this is not the first video game I have ever played so it doesn’t take me years to learn it.
---
A game becoming popular among mainstream audiences is a blessing and a curse. 
---
Believe it or not, my friend. It's not impossible to get modded discs. I mean, just look at GTA V and you can see people that are level 3000+, which unless you literally played nonstop since the beginning, even then I doubt you'd get to 3000 legitimately. 
---
no.
---
Take some solace in the fact that ranked is much better. It's not great, but it's better. Casual is a cesspool. 
---
Flippin dummies not wearing their ground harnesses *SMH* 😤🤬
---
I’ve seen it since the beginning of online gaming. And guys wonder why they don’t get gamer girlfriends 
---
So lucky!!
---
You can flash your teamates. Thats fair. But I don't think it makes sense for Ying to get blinded by flashes when she is wearing specialized goggles. Also the candelas are an "explosive device" - rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Ying
---
So...scifi then?
---
I love comments like these because this is also the kind of dude who refuses to accept the fact that this is how it is and will always be. It's literally as they say, get thicker skin. I couldn't play some games before because I couldn't handle the shit talk. After some time I've grown used to it and now I could give two fucks what a loser on the other end of the world says about me. Even the TK shit doesn't bother me since that's what I expect from these types of games. Surely it might not be written out on paper but these things will always get abused by people like the dudes shown in the video, and all you can do is refuse to play the game or accept it. I did the latter and now I myself barely rage. It's all just a game, it's not like I'm being shanked. Maybe that's just me getting more and more used to this. Anyway, downvote me if you want, it's not like I can control your opinions nor that I would like to, this is just my two cents on the matter. 
---
In casual? I barely understand hacking in ranked but in casual of all places?
---
Vegas was amazing
---
I didnt think it was shitty. Was it unbalanced? Yes. But as far as maps go I still enjoyed it quite a bit. I cant say that about the new map at all. It feels big for sizes sake, and the room layout feels less coherent. It all just blends together and makes it harder to tell where things are. 
---
yeh nah fark off cunt

---
Same

I cant believe some people even act like that to women just because they're gaming. Like who gives a fuck everyone games
---
how about not be a bitch and tk them back or tell them to stfu
---
You can’t get mad about team killing in casual, it’s casual. 
---
Yep.
---
This might sound stupid for video game logic but hear me out: Maybe flashbangs have more incendiary power packed in one device and explosions from the device are so powerful that it deafens you too. Candelas probably don't pack that much power so it can be light enough to become a projectile that's launched from the Candela itself. Ying's special goggles can probably only protect her from bright flashes of a certain intensity.
---
I have 2k hours in csgo and it would be the biggest joke If I would say I have never encounter someone voice spamming some bullshit or calling me boosted or trolling/throwing and what not.
---
Shit like that doesnt bother me in the slightest but I have never meet so many griefers (aka throwers tking me for being low lvl or making a noob mistake and squads taking turns tking me, or ppl who just straight up deranking) in such a short span of time than in siege.
---
I'm glad you linked that because it explains why she is blinded by both the things you are talking about lol. Also I saw no mention of a candela as an explosive device. Either way she doesn't need a fix since she is exactly how the devs created her and how her original and load out is planned, it is all logical and makes sense.  
---
You can’t mention an exploit and not explain it lol 
---
This is really fucking cool to me 
---
I’ve still never gotten a legendary
---
And it only took them what, a week?

Is there a sauce for your OC ?
---
It just shows Tachanka is already elite!
---
They are really rare and it looks fantastic. Get them out of standard alpha packs .

Is that xQc?

This happened to me today in ranked. Killed 3 games in a row after the first game I got 2 kills. It was clearly a group of 4
---
So I invited enemy team into a party to tank us. We were up 3-1 and lost. 
---
Felt so good. 
---
time to be nicer
---
Yeah nah
---
Rule34 artists: allow us to introduce ourselves...
---
Xerces isnt even near the same race what the fuck are you smoking
---
Dammit dizzydrain!
---
Maybe because they are just playing ranked ‘casually’ for fun since they have to try hard in scrim and real matches. They could just use their aim to play with relax while streaming.
---
Maybe one day you'll be lucky enough to find the tower stairs white light. Almost an unbelievable tale.
---
I can hear their kid's voice line now...
---
"You can stop worrying about cocaine now"
---
&gt; It shouldn't be that way though
---
I mean, it is what it is. People are assholes. A percentage of the population is assholes. They act like assholes because they have the freedom to, because it's hard to stop them when they aren't breaking any real life laws. Ubisoft can try and stop them, just like other game devs do try to do, and games like overwatch or league are putting a lot of work into trying to do that, but every playerbase will be toxic regardless of that, because they can't hire 1k people to sit in a room reading every single chat message and voicelog in the game. 
---
But it would most certainly improve the game if their report system meant jack fucking shit. 
---
You will understand when you start paying for these burdens through taxes. It doesnt help that there will be no social security when you retire. Your paying into benifits for other people that you will never receive ie a ponzy scheme. Thats why europe is importing third worlders and trying to tax em. Gotta keep the scheme going at all costs. Or they could just make you work till you die.
---
Sell your console 
---
Lion - Global ability that influences the match at the push of a button
---
Blitz - Shields balance and design wise don't really belong in the game where the others are annoying Blitz is OP from his ability to sprint and flash
---
Blackbeard - Love the character design and his DMR but the dudes ability doesn't belong in this game no matter how nerfed it's been
---
That’s what worries me
---
/tp Thermite Thatcher
---
Lol
---
I remember having a bad run where I lost like four matches in a row, and then my very next match these pre-teen sounding kids are on my team and I just think, "screw it, not my day today, imma log," then I remember "wait, when I was 12, I was fucking awesome at Quake because I was an obsessed maniac that would spend all his free time reading strats and downloading pro-league demo files."
---
So of course the kids carry, and then for the final round they're like "pistols only!"  And they freaking wipe the other team.
---
Bless!
---
I never put the blame on them. How is it ignorant to say you shouldnt give them value? You should care what racist and sexist have to say? Well alright than...
---
Yes we have laws but as you can see, that still doesnt stop people. This is what im trying to get at. You can minimize this issue but its not fully goimg to be removed. So its a good practice to not let it bug you. I never once said that nothing should be done.
---
And why did you assume im not a minority? You dont know me lol. 
---
I've started to read it as well but it's so long! 
---
They dont auto kick? I hoestly never team kill so i dont know. I thought they did at 2 kills?
---
When I got tired of this,I usually go to Overwatch "to relax" (obviously it's not a real solution) solo queue in this game is a nightmare.
---
Just run Fire like a real boss
---
How did you got the " sledge main" in your post!? 
---
u could probably use your time more wisely than contemplating drawing things in regards to a fucking shooting game 
---
Yes.
---
That's literally the point 
---
Agreed would be interesting to explore whether Caveira had a future as a contract killer 
---
You must be new here
---
You have to account for the fact that people can't grow a thick-skin or grow it at a different pace, a way different pace. Yeah sure, you can say "You get used to it". But isn't that just speaking for yourself? Sure. I'm super used to TKing nowadays, it matters if the person that TKd me trades another kill. That way we wouldn't be held back. But that doesn't stop me from thinking about something. No matter how thick skin can get, something will manage to crawl under it. My philosophy behind it is that nothing can go through thick skin, but it doesn't have to, because it grows under it.
---
People shouldn't have to get a voice changer so they don't get harassed.
---
i disagree i reckon ubisoft just needs have a bigger focus on the esports and competitive side of the game aswell as fixing the above issues dont get me wrong always gonna have issues its an ever evolving game something is gonna always go wrong but the amount of time it takes to fix and patch major issues is stupid. i dont think basically removing a whole season from the game is gonna do anything but make it stale and dry and besides last operation health was one of the worst seasons i can remember (personal opinion) for balancing and hit reg. esports scene had a 300% growth at six invitational but patches are far a few between yet i constantly see new charms and skins and uniforms and items that cost money aswell as them raising the price of the game last year i understand that balancing and skins department are 2 different ubisoft teams but like invest more into the balancing side of things and just spend more money on the balancing side of things
---
Solo Q vs a 5 stack isn’t objectively unfair. If 5 people solo q and all use their mic’s, make calls and communicate, then you have just as good a chance against 5 people in discord. I don’t see the logic here, either get 4 other reliable people to play with, or become good enough in your rank bracket to carry unresponsive teammates. How is a lack of player communication Ubisoft’s fault?
---
I really want a Cav elite 😭
---
Idk man she has a [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/alex_zedra) and for the rest I'm not to sure but watching her channel and stalking IG might help?
---
I agree with you, use voice chat all you want, you shouldn't have to stop cause of idiots.  If someone is being a dumbass, just mute them completely and keep playing.  If there's multiple people being dumbasses, just mute all of them cause communicating with them wouldn't matter anyway.  
---
*hey
---
If on PC I would high recommend valk, hibana, and buck as I own them. On console, cav and buck are solid options as their gadgets are easy to handle.
---
[deleted]
---
Well, most people in his team seem to think I am right though.
---
What's your twitch I'll check you out!
---
I can't discuss about fantasy gadgets. That's the lore. And the balancing explanation as well, which is the most important. 
---
I don't like the dude. But if he says siege is a toxic cesspool. Then that's saying something.
---
Exactly. 
---
I've been playing for quite some time and I've never found any of these on Asian servers.
---
Pretty cool Idea u/Beebjank had was a Caveira elite which is like a lion cloth kind of a Stone Age theme and has like a Saber tooth as a knife or just a stone knife which I thought was pretty cool.
---
Just a heads up, in case someone doesn't know, starting the interrogation makes sure it goes through regardless of them leaving.

As an 8th grader who is bad at reading, I did

**Ubisoft never gets on that.**

To answer your question about tking before even judging the team, this usual occurs because of a feedback loop. Imagine this. You are in hell for all eternity and being tortured every single day on the rack. You hate it but your stuck there for whatever reason. After a while the devil comes by and says buddy today you dont have to go to the rack. Today you get to send people to the rack. After so long of being tortured you finaly get a taste of melancholy. Your gratefull that your no longer mad about being tortured. This new view as being the torture has warped your mind and you start to enjoy it and cant stop. This in turn creats more tortures. This loop is extreamly hard to break if left unchecked. Tking in a game like r6 is very hard to fix. If you try to punish tker than tkers will just walk infront of your shots and make you take the punishments. There are only 2 solutions to tking. One is implementing and overwatch csgo style system were offensives are reviewd on a case by case basis and punishments are severe. Another is eliminating friendly fire all together. The first one is hard and expensive but keeps the games integrity in check. The second one is easy and cheap but alows the tkers to change in body blocker for the other team as a form of torturing you but atleast you get to play instead of spectate.
---
Because he is compelled to find something wrong and it's a very good costume. So it's easiest to just say it's edited. Still a great pic.
---
Sure, if you want to knowingly break the rules, then prepare to have your post removed!
---
A team just did this to my buddies and I. For anyone wondering if you change so graphics settings such as shadows off it should fix it for you. Anyone using this exploit deserves to be banned. 
---
Finka's mask doesn't cover the back of her head and neck, therefore she'd be a little exposed.
---
Nah yellow ping is best
---
Almost like there isn't a way to remove a fellow player!
---
Reward isn’t worth it . If they would release camo for operator , or gadget charm - gladly would do Operator specific challenge . It’s just a dog tag 
---
Then vs me on control and complain after that? Hb that
---
People always say the community is amazing and I'm like "why?" It's fucking horrible! The forgive system mentioned in the video is an amazing idea
---
We‘ll see
---
Things like this shouldn’t even be in a game like siege. Especially since the game has been out for such a long time already. 
---
😂 I bet be did.

Imagine 5 attackers with flashing capabilities and  one that can see when every defender has white screen 
---
Ok. So you’ve somehow done worse than the people spamming the same cookie-cutter argument and giving terrible advice or suggestions by giving neither. Don’t you think the Rest of R6 has to deal with this Bullshit? Difference between us and you is we don’t let it get to us because this whole “waaah Siege toxic Ubi fix it” is shit that takes Siege from a complex, realistic shooter to another COD/Overwatch Clone.
---
battleye HWID ban on second offense I believe. 
---
Reported for toxic behavior
---
Something is up when they decided to postpone proleague
---
Ever need chill people man for Xbox just hit me up. My squads laid back but we still know the game very well. 
---
Can you hit the crouch key as fast as your macro is set while playing normally? While shooting? Does it slow you down doing it without the macro?
---
If you have any negative effects while doing it normally, you have your answer. You are using a separate program to do something you can't normally.
---
Aimbotters cant aim that well normally.
---
Teleporting players cant move as fast normally
---
You can't crouch that fast normally.
---
See how it's cheating?
---
Brorsjan he has an acog, the flip sight is zoomed
---
His flip sight is the acog...
---
how about you use a controller like the rest of us OR go to PC?
---
on xbone btw
---
Sorry, I didnt knew they changed how the starting round looks like. I didnt play the new season because of ps plus
---
He's using a hybrid sight. 
---
Was not expecting that lmao. Thinking outside the box 
---
Ok I understand 
---
I agree with blitz
---
Mine are bb, lion and maybe valk
---
I want to know why are cav and pulse bad for the game ?
---
It would negate the flip sight? 
---
But he’s not destroying them with skill. For example. If a 5 stack of diamond have copper smurfs and then shit on everybody to make t do diamond, that’s toxic. 
---
I wish I would have seen this before my friends and I lost a match due to the whole enemy team doing this to us. This really needs to be patched as it is game breaking and anyone doing it deserves a ban. 
---
Hello modsdeletingmyposts, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acgi9v/the_dream_that_is_health_2/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Don’t deserve silver
---
Im onboard with this, you sir got my vote
---
They can take the solution from Bf1. If you crouch spamming, you start doing it more slower. 
---
As an xQc fan, I can confirm that fullscreen is the way to go when watching xQc.
---
Nah they haven’t touched crouching only drop shotting and lean spaming which is also still a thing
---
Any low level that is doing just as well as a diamond, excessive accounts from 1 ip, any streamer or youtuber using any of their 5 smurfs.
---
There's a difference between "trash talk", and toxicity. There's nothing wrong with a humiliation kill. It's like a touchdown celebration. Sometimes it's to gloat, sometimes it's to acknowledge that you've overcome a nemesis. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Toxic is chat spam, voice spam, tking, voting to kick for no reason, intentional downing, hacking, exploiting, and the like. 
---
Good point about the time to kill, PUBG has armor whilst R6 does not. However, without armor the time to kill doesn't differ that much between these games if players have an assault rifle and are fighting indoors, headshots will Insta kill in both games but in PUBG it is much more of an accomplishment to get the headshot due to the amount of recoil, same goes for Insurgency Sandstorm.
---
You are a piece of shit and you deserve to burn in the deepest pits of hell. Go to pc servers and see how which rank you get placed motherfucker. You ruin peoples games
---
It’s not, you just want easy games from smurfing
---
Or they way CSGO did it where you’d have a crouch cool down if you spammed to hard
---
It's Alex Zedra
---
Wow. Are you joking?
---
Tk forgiveness. We've only been asking forever lol
---
A group of people in casual killed me every round until I left because I wouldn't join their Xbox squad.
---
How to break the matrix
---
Crutch
---
The game is rated M. You can't just take away everything that refers to something bad that happens in the real world and expect it to have the realistic theme they are going for. The neon stripper isn't the only thing, they would have to change so many cosmetics and such for one country's laws. 
---
1000+ IQ play if that was the intent
---
Go to any gun and go to skins while in the operators screen. In universal skins you should be able to find it. 
---
&gt; Any low level that is doing just as well as a diamond,
---
But as I said, This was me, I reached diamond before level 50 when I transferred. There is no way of knowing whether someone is using a second account or coming from another platform. You can never ban someone for that. 
---
The other 2 options are more viable. But that would first mean Ubi needs to declare smurfing against the rules. I'm fine with people having an alt account, I have one. 
---
My main is diamond and my alt is plat 1 but I have my alt when I play with say lesser skilled friends. It sucks to first win amazing matches with my skilled group of friends to later lose because someone after 1500+ hours of playing still doesn't understand the basics of the game. 
---
Probably higher than you’ll ever make it on console 
---
Yeah, and I also remember a post and someone from Ubi responded with a link about MnK users to report them. You had to show proof tho.
---
 A new joker in the making XD

Is he actually on drugs? He really seemed like it. I couldnt understand him half the time

Hello NemesisSTYLES! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!
---
Should you still have any unanswered question, [let the moderation team know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRainbow6 "Click here to compose a modmail message") so they can inprove the guide for future buyers.
---
Csgos hacking issue is literaly the worst it's ever been. Even streamers like shroud have said this.
---
Running into hackers in siege is rare as fuck compared to that hack infested game csgo. 
---
Concentrate in your aim. When you are aiming, put all your concentration in following perfectly the enemy. Try to pinpoint their head and to follow them with your sights. Terrorist hunt is not useful, as the enemy doesn't move. Also, in PC essentially everyone has very good aim, so your best bet is to catch your enemies off guard. Try not to get into direct firefights.
---
A tip for sensitivity is to see what you are comfortable on. There is no magic sensibility, some people prefer high ones while some prefer slow ones. Start in the middle and try different ones.
---
Only 399 for these skills
---
Stupid fucking not
---
You will most likely have every operator at some point anyway, so does it really matter...? 
---
Then it would be QQEE spam and it would be worse as it actually impacted on the hit boxes.
---
Mouse and keyboard on console is for pussies
---
If you don't want an operator, choose one you do want...
---
Don't listen to the reddit outrage. I have over 1600 hours in siege am diamond and have only seen maybe 6 hackers in my time. 
---
Yes because some of them are not as good as others
---
How is it frustrating? I was so happy when I switched, better frames, way better controls.
---
Some of my binds:
---
Primary gadget - Caps Lock
---
Secondary Gadget - G/side of mouse button (side of mouse button recommended cause it's very useful for cooking grenades and lobbing C4). 
---
Spot - Z
---
As for sensitivity my general tip when going from console to pc is LOWER THAT SENSITIVITY. I started with 2400 DPI, 20-20 sens. I'm now down to 400 DPI 12-15. Use your arm for larger swipes, wrist for micro adjustments. 
---
Conclusion: Ya all use the AFK pick to troll rather than how it's supposed to be used.
---
I depends on your play style to be honest if your aggressive maybe a 3 speed like Hibana or ying but for instance if you play a little slower and less rushy buy someone like Blackbeard or buck or jackel 
---
Steroids.
---
I dont smurf, but thanks for assuming things. Your artitude towards any opinion other than yours really shows how strong you idea is. Meaning its trash. 
---
candelas are made in china
---
thats it
---
If you buy a operator you don't like just buy a different one later... In the long run i does not matter anyway
---
 Come on mate at least credit the creator 
---
Are you new to PC gaming or just new to this game on PC?  For me this is just another shooter I have adjusted in game settings accordingly.  
---
Very cool! I can imagine having a neon light like this 
---
Wtf, that’s a new one.
---
Or just like pengu said, most of them are women and they dont want to talk or they get harrased
---
This has to stop. 
---
We want operation health 2.0
---
I’m gonna go interrogate that moose...
---
I would like to met you in a match so i can kick your m&amp;k sorry ass
---
I piggy backed on someone else's idea that changed the damage rating for defenders ONLY during prep phase. I added that TK forgiveness options should be available immediately on death. If you aren't forgiven twice in a single game, the kick and ban cycle begins. But if you go two matches with an unforgiven tk in a row, the ban cycle also begins. Every unforgiven TK should also be counted and displayed on your character card, but that's just a fun little thing for me lol. 
---
The video game logic behind yings goggles is that her candelas are customized flashes that function differently to regular stuns and the blue tint on her goggles stops her being effected by her own gadget and in turn why she can be flashed by regular flashbangs and blitz. 
---
As player it isnt, but ubi just cant ban some players just because they are low rank and are good players. 
---
I’ll turn the controller on just for you :) and still slap that ass
---
Hello TK115, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ach2um/rainbow_was_broken_for_me/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Most women gamers I know won’t even wear a headset unless they’re in a party with their friends just because of how horrible gamer dudes are.
---
A lot of people have also been suggesting systems like these long, long ago, but ubisoft still hasn't implemented anything except the 'Report for toxic behavior' button
---
thank you?
---
They can if they are smurfing
---
Mute em you don't need backseat drivers 
---
That moment when you get angry over a TK and then you look at the death cam and he said sorry is a beautiful thing 
---
It's more baffling that they aren't doing this now, because if all the team drones are destroyed during prep phase it actually shows you where u are spawning (this didn't happen during previous seasons)
---
Thank you for your answer. The Rocco cobra rescue harness looks a bit different on the back piece.
---
Thank you Ubi ♥️
---
A real stealer of virginity
---
Yeah also I really lile their designs but the paint is at some parts of the figures terrible and low quality... 
---
Because people think it's funny. There's no real reason
---
there's a couple of bomb sights where the defusser can be placed on a hatch (work office - tower for example) if you shotgun, impact, c4 etc the hatch then the defusser falls out of range
---
how to interact with the defusser still isn't that clear when you're on the timer
---
Noo, the thing is that it's not cheating after all even when it does indeed feel like that. Don't get me wrong I absolutely hate smurfing and would never do that, but still, it's not against any policies as far as I know.
---
If your main account gets banned and you buy another one to play the game then it's against the policies, but simply purchasing the game for different accounts is not against any policy. 
---
Smurfing isnt breaking the rules... Do you fucking get that. You just cannot ban people for no reason. 
---
I once got 48 messages in a row from someone that team killed me right at spawn of round 1. They team killed me and I asked "Y?” They said “hahaha you're trash" So next round I tk’d them. They legit sent me 48 messages in a row. Blowing up about how dare I do that to them and do I know who they are” For the first time in 20+ years of online gaming I felt really really bad for someone. 
---
Met exactly these guys yesterday, they're all hacking except for the Ferro guy in their team I think.  
---
Then they start trying to make us pay them and they will surrender, this is fucking bullshit
---
And to the left is a jäger with no elite skin... what were you trying to prove again?
---
I feel you, I am a high gold/low plat player and if I'm not with at least with 2 friends the game is just a dice roll, no matter what I do really, it seems that my teammates can't carry their own weight nor they try to help me carry their own. It is just a fuckfest.
---
I know, we heard this a lot, "Matchmaking is broken" but think for a sec, how many matches were ACTUAL good matches? Keep in mind for a match to be good you don't need to actually win, or how many matches were 4x4 where both teams were on the same skill level?
---
Can't answer for you but in my experience these are few in between.
---
As for the toxicity problem, I have **TEXT chat disabled**, if you want to communicate **voice chat** it is and if people start playing songs/screaming/coaching their sure  as hell are getting muted, plain and simple I don't even need to waste a word with them.
---
How ubisoft can fix this? I don't have a proper answer but maybe make toxicity reports worth more? Get reported a lot? Play with people who been reported a lot, or maybe implement some good behavior "report" button, like in Overwatch (Shoot caller, Good Teammate, Communicative) and use the same logic as above.
---
It's all about the angle
---
There is still room for abuse. I personally don't mind having a toxic player/s in my Casual game, I'm not going to leave for that reason because it's just Casual. Leaving room for error wouldn't fix it at all.
---
Yeah the community is fucking horrible. I turned chat off on pc and it improved my gaming experience for like 150%
---
Yes, now fix it
---
No, I’ve gamed online for about 20 years (PC, OG Xbox, PS2 etc) 
---
Hands down IME siege is the worst community I’ve ever experienced. I love the game have nearly a 1000 hours in it. But holy hit show man, the community can be sooooo bad.  
---
Slow to load/open mic?

How is he not banned yet? I’ve seen several videos featuring him and his hacks
---
The thing is, it is a small portion and a perfect example of conformation bias, but yea you do you. However casual is casual it is just there it's worth nothing as long as someone isn't greifing the shit out of their own team I don't see any worth while complains.
---
Never they stopped making seasons
---
You can literally google if smurfing is considered cheating and the answer will be yes
---
It is, it’s considered cheating
---
lol nah
---
Already happened to me
---
Because there is always a cheaper way. Thats all i wanted to know. As you can see i edited the post because one kind person already helped. 
---
It was a damn gift they didn't have to do in the first place, you entitled ass.
---
I think the K1A is still a strong option compared to almost every defender but I agree that Jagers carbine is for sure a better weapon but it all depends on what you prefer, The K1A is a solid pick if thats more your style of gun. 
---
Yep, logged in after I saw they fixed it and had 2 holiday packs, assumed it was a visual bug, but it converted into 50k renown.

Dont worry about it, you put more effort into this than 99% of the shit post's that people slap together in photoshop. Got a chuckle out of me.

Because casual is becoming a toxic wasteland full of 4 man premades that insta kick or 4 randoms that think its funny to just vote kick people. 
---
We've been gnomed lads
---
Mrs. Obama, it's been an honor
---
"Fookin holes, right up"
---
I personally do prefer the K1A but part of me is unsure why, knowing that there are statistically better options like the carbine. But yeh personal preference overrules anything I guess.
---
I know it sucks for players at low ranks but smurfing is not against any rules and therefore cannot be banned outright by ubisoft. 
---
Well this was a shit gift which was broken for 2  weeks, (just a stupid pack) which is a shame for a big company to fix for so long. Anyway it’s ubishit, everything is broken in their games. 
---
P.S fck you liberal cunt 
---
Yeah over christmas you are aware that Devs need holidays too.
---
GUYS DINT CLICK THE LINK ITS A GNOME

Ding, Weber, Loiselle, and some others from the main games. I don't know why but even though I know nothing about them and they basically had little story, just by playing the old games as a kid I loved them as characters lol.
---
*Visibly Gnomed*
---
I ask my teammates to unload mags while I place a fuze, I then go to another place pop the first fuze and lay another one and pop it right away. This method catches so many people cause they run from the first fuze into another.
---
YES !! by god i was thinking the same aahhh !!!!
---
Low plat, the cheater is diamond
---
Incorrect. I hate it. I want the recruit pick back. At least you can plan for a recruit pick.                  Example:
---
My internet decides it wants to cease functioning and I miss the OP pick timer... But I have already setup my recruit to be the guns/grenades I want it to be, I know that im getting that recruit with those guns.  
---
In the same situation today: I randomly get picked capitao who ive never setup a single gun for nor know how to use him/how to use his guns.
---
I would have done better just getting a recruit.              
---
I think they should change the system to be the player gets to choose what op gets picked if they run out of time. EX: I miss my timer and I want my pick order to be        1) Buck 2)Nomad 3) Ying 4) etc etc...           You pick a list of 5 ops in the off chance that the other 4 players pick your number 1,2,3,and 4. This system becomes the best of both worlds. 
---
You can buy these Season passes but the only good version I know is farming in terrorist hunt with a booster activated which however is grinding. obviously you can just play the game until you get ops,
---
It's all situational. honestly if you cut out the second airjab then you could be more efficient. More likely to get a claymore kill and have an extra charge to set up another trap with team-mate's claymore or just an early warning system.
---
I think maverick should have to get electrocuted to open the reinforcementif there is a bandit battery or an electroclaw on there.
---
this is giving r/SuddenlyGay vibes

WOW...just, wow!

Lesions SMG
---
&gt; my duty is to make them the best at siege
---
How is preventing them from playing and thus gaining experience going to helping improving ANYTHING at all? What benefit comes from having it?
---
Ironically, by making your entire team lose so the person you are bullying also loses ELO, all of your buddies and you are losing elo and going into lower ranks, where there’s going to be more players that aren’t as skilled
---
If you don’t want bad players, why don’t you just go into a five  stack?
---
Nah! They enjoyed “getting us rekt!” At least typed as much in the chat. All of them were level 150+ too. A full Round 1 YouTube video of same match is here: https://youtu.be/E02Yu1fYpps
---
Barricade wasn't popped for his perspective it seems so he was just watching the angle.

---
Yeah I get sound drops from my character every other play session or so. I don’t hear any of my footsteps, my gun sounds like it’s been fired from quite a distance with only the ambient echo making any sound, and most of the time I only hear my reload animation. 
---
Occasionally this happens, but instead of my character, it’s either a teammate or an enemy player, which makes it super not cool when they’re close by and I can’t hear anything.
---
I completely and totally agree. I have had a multitude of matches where someone says "they're in the kitchen" after they had died. A kitchen is a common thing to know what it looks like, and that had legitimately helped me kill the person that got my teammate. In other circumstances, it's like "he's down the hall", and we're playing on clubhouse. There's so many damn hallways, which one?? If he would be able to specify "basement" or "bar", it would be a lot better. It would also help people to actually learn the calloute instead of "over there" like you had said in the post. I think this would be a great idea, too bad they are never gonna do anything with kt
---
Yeah bad.
---
I do what i do to help the communinty as a whole. A trash player will be angry that i tked them. This anger will build up over many tks to the pointbthey quit the game. A true gamer woild not care that i tked them. They will only focus on becoming better and attaining the level that i attained and hopefully joing my crusade in clearing the filth that has infected ranked. The weak shall perish and the strong will survive. I do not care for the emotions of those that are trash for they are trash. It is not about being insecure or that other mumbojumbo that you are trying to defelct to. It is about clensing a filthy system.
---
A good solution to this issue is to just tk the tker next round. An eye for an eye and you both only have one tk left. They do it again and they get kicked, and you show them the same thing they did to you. Relax and enjoy being a spectator for the round.
---
Id love to see  many of these hackers got banned. Uninstalled siege yesterday after a lot of rounds lost in ranked. Plat 2 to gold 3. Saw anything... Teleport, aimlock, aimbot. Also crouch and q e spammers. But there must be an other method. Maybe a mix of IP, hardware id and maybe a drivers license number registration. Here in Germany the IP address changes all 24h and/or if u restart ur router. If anyone has to register his/her unique ID number of a real passport/license/ID card, that would be hard to "spoof". 
---
There is. It’s the Jaws music.
---
People in this game are so salty, you kill them and they automatically assume its hacks. Smh
---
With the how much space you need to actually vault in the game, even a small patch could fuck a thermite or hibana hole.
---
Silent Siege 6
---
Ouch
---
i don't know, my DPI is broken or something, when i turn it down to 400DPI i actually cannot move and its about 15 mouse pads to turn 30 degrees
---
What level/ rank are you? If you are low chances are they'll kick you regardless of how good you are. Can't be helped unless you squad up with friends because you need all 4 votes.
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of companies reward people for finding bugs in their game/program but (correct me if I'm wrong) I think they do that to get people to actually try to find bugs, which does not apply in this case.
---
The anonymity of the internet makes people say rude things? In other news, water is wet. Mute the offenders and move on. 
---
No? So why didnsome people get 50 000 then?
---
I got this one once. I thought it was cause i joined the match late but it required a full game restart.
---
It's not like you were firing close to a wall, or already firing previous to him walking in front of you. It's prep phase. Like other's said you should've gone to another room or loaded up terrorist hunt. He probably didn't expect you to start shooting because #WHAT #DUMBASS #DECIDES #TO #SHOOT #A #WALL #DURING #PREP #PHASE #FROM #THE #MIDDLE #OF #THE #ROOM. Oh wait, you.
---
Yeah but why would you censor their name
---
Maybe you're right and it's not the most toxic ever, of course i can't know that for sure.
---
However the reason why i'm saying this is because unlike other games, this doesn't have any system to deal with toxicity or any other similar behaviour. Sure, we sometimes see a few banned for toxicity but that has no real effect on the problem and is not a solution, also not automatic and doesn't work fast.
---
I think it is unprecedented, that a huge game like this don't deal with these things at all. And we are more than 3 years into its existence.
---
I've been playing multiplayer games for more than 2 decades now and I've never seen anything like this. Not even in those times when these things were new and no one knew how to deal with it.
---
That's no way to talk to a stranger
---
Doesn't matter.   Both should get banned.
---
If it was up to me, the second someone cheated or hacked or glitched in any way, shape or form they'd get hardware banned.  There wouldn't be a single glitch, hack, or cheat if I was in charge, but sadly I'm not in charge.  Instead we have devs who cater to cheaters and hackers by not giving a shit.
---
Lol alright. Since NONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS seem to get the whole point of the post. Lemme explain. **I didn’t mean to team kill my friend, but I did on accident. The scenario was kinda funny though. That’s it**. But all of you wanna be like “REEEEEEEEE YOU’RE STUPID AND TOXIC. YOU DESERVE TO DIE” and shit like that. Like seriously, fuckin calm down lol
---
Changing the Texture filter also works.
---
I can totally see a hive mind recruit leader who tells all his spawn to rush M870s
---
:(
---
the people saying this isn't a problem because "I've seen worse" are basically saying "I saw a dumpster fire the other day so this pile of trash on the floor doesn't need to be cleaned up because it's not *nearly* as bad". just because it isn't as terrible as something else doesn't mean it's not fucking terrible you empty headed apes.
---
No man. We get it it. We’re also just calling you an idiot because you’re wrong and your “defenses” are garbage.

Because Ubisoft is too busy banning people for saying dabbing backwards.
---
What do you play? Console or PC?
---
right. basically anything but what this guy made.. lol
---
Jackal is an attack operator, same as IQ. Would be pointless. 
---
they're incompetent game devs not the fucking illuminati
---
That's irrelevant. OP claims he knows of a bug which allows him to win rounds but he would rather exploit it himself than help in getting it fixed...simply because he isn't sure if he will be rewarded. 
---
Well it's a toss for me, but I don't do it in r6, I play ranked and I only troll complete jerks at this point people are just trying to play the game. Much more fun trolling youtube comments
---
next time just kill him
---
Rip, on console i saw this thing (dont know if glitch or hack) where they teleported their selfs on the roof and there was this one Guy that reinforced all hatches there (was on coast map) so yea there Goes ranked 😂
---
The airjab mechanic sounds awesome tbh.
---
Aaaand why does this one have negative votes too?
---
Actually, this rule is to protect innocent people.

that's like saying "everyone else I know's house is a dump, so why should I clean mine?". even if it's a common issue, people can and *should* bring it to light to try and fix it.
---
idk seems a bit Defender sided.
---
Ahhhh spooky lady

Exploit, not hack.

No 3rd party software was used.

Dead meme format in a nutshell. 
---
First things first, Ubisoft is not Epic...
---
It is fully supported by Sony on Playstation so it is down to Ubisoft being able to detect it. Not sure on the whole logistics as to why they can't detect it or why they aren't doing anything about it but the problem lies with Ubisoft not being capable of stopping it.
---
Thanks for that picture, now I can enjoy that moment.
---
Why did they all have thick accents and the victims didn't? Felt like I was watching a Borat 2. 
---
IIRC barbed wire used to do damage but it was too OP. They're perfectly balanced as is and are one of the most powerful secondary gadgets in the game. 
---
How do they do that?

It was casual

I feel like a smurf on PC. I'm level 60 already, but have played since the beta on PS4. Recently got a PC worth a damn and decided to give it a go, maaaaan it's fantastic! Much better with the mouse, I don't feel like Steven Hawking trapped in Steven Hawking's body anymore like I did with a controller. 
---
I still go back to play some matches with my friends once in a while, but PC is where it's at! Plus, there's this correlation between people that have PC's and good internet. Most people I play with on PS4 have 6 torrents going on or K-Mart quality internet, playing off Wi-Fi tethered to their phone or something. PC players are usually hardwired, and waaay less irritating with lag issues. Anyway, I didn't mean to devolve into a PC rant, just that PS4 also has the same problem with smurfs, and it's annoying.   
---
Some say this is why people celebrate Christmas.

They scope actually looks cool they should change the diamond skin so your whole gun looks like that scope 
---
I get the season pass so i get all ops that way. Maybe i will see what the next seasonals are. Thanks.
---
You get better with experience. The best tips are listening and communicating with your team. 
---
Needs more Lion. Yellow Meta

I play with a full team and I can carry or get shit on I'll still get 10 points.

He’s obviously talking about a ping (yellow ping) in game and not ping referring to connection.... don’t be silly lol

Yeah that looks really good! Great work!

Maverick needs a counter, nothing stops his blowtorch.
---
What do you mean you can’t use it? What behaviour does it give you 
---
Sorry I'm a bit slow, bear with me )
---
The guy behind the deployable shield was already injured by someone else. That's a stolen kill that petty people that aren't good at the game get mad about because that was probably the only kill they could've gotten that day. Because they're miserable trash.
---
I get these texture exploit yesterday, but it isn't so crazy full screen blocked like this, only have these crystals around my weapon view model, is it because I'm AMD GPU?
---
&gt;This shit was annoying as fuck. You're acting like it doesn't still happen on the Xbox One tho, when it actually does.
---
First of all, your entire argument revolves around you simply saying "this happens because I say it does". I've been playing Xbox since the original big black VCR box, and believe me I know the types of hacking that went on back in those days. 
---
I have not seen a single person or heard of a single person being able to fly around, have one-shot kills, shoot through walls, etc. in a game on Xbox One. The explanation provided explains why that is, and also why it was able to happen on the previous generation of consoles.
---
&gt;Ok, but you can do the same exact shit on the newer CoD games, too, so clearly the Xbox One *is* capable of being hacked.
---
Except you clearly didn't properly read what you quoted. It's specifically talking about an in-game glitch that could happen that appeared to be a form of hacking. Again, **glitches in the game that are exploited are not hacks even if it is still cheating.**
---
&gt;I didn't play Halo 2, but I played the old CoD games and holy shit it really was a fucking nightmare
---
To reiterate, I played on old consoles where hacking was a legitimate issue. If it's so possible on the current Xbox One, then why aren't people doing the exact same things that they did before like flying around or things that would literally be impossible within the structure of the game?
---
Haha
---
Well team communication is a biggy but I rarely have coms cus plat 3 team mates are just assholes most of the time. Try to improve relations and aim. And if you don't have map knowledge, that's another biggy cus siege is big on tactics and map knowledge

Normally id say its personal preference except with this single skin, seasonal skins are a much much better choice ;)

You act like this is amazing gameplay. Are you copper? He didn't even rush in while his Candelas were going off which is the whole point of Ying's gadget. This is like silver 1 / gold 4 console gameplay.
---
Not shitting on him for not being a god. An ace is an ace, but to pretend like he performed some miraculous play and that he MUST be smurfing to gain an unfair advantage is absolutely ridiculous.

By the way HUGE fan of your vids :D
---
Well I don't know much about pc's so what ever is good but not like top notch.
---
To can my certainty go up?
---
Same here. My friend is lvl. 10 or something and mops up MVP's with Doc lol. Has zero map knowledge and no idea what all the operators do, guy is just a beast with the FPS's. And that's when he's in the party with me getting matched against golds/plats. Sometimes those noob strats are the best too, seeing things from a fresh or strange perspective is greatness.
---
Not sure wym
---
That’s so coool! How long did it take you?
---
Oh don’t get me wrong, I’m not naive with the situation, of course it’ll cost a ton of money to make a decent system. But if they truly want this game to live as long as possible, then they must bite the bullet and figure out a new system. Otherwise, this game will eventually be grouped by the entire video game community as a CoD Like game, where everyone knows it’s a toxic cesspool before they even buy it. 
---
Thank you. I have those sometimes. I don't think you'll believe me but few days before blood orchid I had a concept for an operator who could hack the defensive cameras. I was so confused when they added Dokkaebi 
---
Honestly there is 1 thing this game should do. Remove team killing. Seriously its such a dumb idea for a game. I understand it existing in mil sims like arma and squad and a few others, but R6 is supposed to be a fun team shooter where ppl have incredibly advanced gadgets, removing teamkilling, at least from matchmaking i guess u can keep it in pro games, would be a great way to stop A LOT of the griefing that exists. 99% of teamkilling is on purpose and the other 1% is just dumb mistakes. I mean keep self killing and self damage, but remove team killing and dmg altogether, its not needed and the game would be better without it than with it. 
---
Maverick is blatantly broken, but ubi won’t fix it any time soon so we gotta deal with it
---
Also can we please add that you get points for getting teamkilled? Like -100 for the team killer and +100 for the guy that got killed, atleast it compensates a little for the potential points you lost, and reduces the fustration of getting teamkilled atleast
---
Yeah that was also a popular idea for a while. Same with the holograms with Alibi. 
---
Smurf in casual...? 
---
Hi
---
It’s casual.. 
---
Yes, ye they did

I didn't know Thatcher for a buff

I could also play the game of completely misunderstanding your comment. Smurfs suck, and its easy to see whos smurfing. This guy is obviously not, but i wasnt commenting on that fuckface
---

---
I fucking knew it lmao

Bexause they want to? They like the characters
---
Everything is so expensive in this game!

i cant play this game like 24/7

How would Sony take legal action when they sell the Hori Tac Pro (listed as "Mouse and Keyboard" directly on their site) and license it as an official alternative controller? [http://stores.horiusa.com/tactical-assault-commander-pro-tac-pro/](http://stores.horiusa.com/tactical-assault-commander-pro-tac-pro/)  
---
The official stance from Microsoft is they will not ban users of Keyboard and Mouse: " We could but there are helpful scenarios with these devices  (accessibility for one). - Mike Ybarra"
---
According to Jeff Kaplan at Blizzard, they need the permission of MS and Sony. From both posts above, they do not have the support of either. The fact that they have to go to these companies for permission basically states, they cannot ban players using them on consoles without Sony or MS allowing it. Don't expect that to happen with both Sony and MS releasing support for M/KB or similar devices. They would have to ban their own support and products.

Plus third party controllers are as old as gaming systems themselves. They are not going away anytime soon. Their is a 3rd party controller clause, that allows for them legally as well. 
---
You can’t kick in ranked. 
---
Mira
---
you could couple that by taking into account how much dmg each player does to their team. Heroes and generals does this and it works perfectly fine. 
---
The lengths that people will go to do this is sad...pretty messed up one can even do this.
---
Good point, this is also true of staircases which tend to get nicknames based on their dominant colour e.g. blue stairs, white stairs etc.

Could say the same for the new Rook elite, I can't tell the difference from new to old

How do you turn RTX on I have a 2080

Maverick should just have an animation where he strike a Flint in one hand while he holds the torch in the other. Keep the torch sound where it is, but make the striking Flint loud and sharp.

No. It was nice of them and all but annoying that they released it fucked up. I’m not asking for more.

Uh I play on console thank you very much.

Your point is that Chinese have a certain look which Hibana also has/d, and Japanese have a distinctive look which Chinese don't have. 
---
I get what you're saying, and I'm not offended (sorry my word choice probably gave the wrong impression); I just think to say that Chinese eyes aren't Japanese eyes is ridiculous. I live in Beijing, there are tons of round faces and round eyes--my wife included!

Either way the new splash art still looks Chinese. Rip

Maybe Devs need a trip to Tokyo? Haha
---
&gt;I've even tried running Monty so st the very least I would survive the round.
---
Aight, yeah if you use Monty just to avoid the Tk it's just annoying.
---
I've had randoms tk me for no reason then go Monty or Clash the next round so I can't kill them back.  That just pisses me off even more, to the point where I will go Capitão, knowing I can't play him for my life, just for the sole purpose of fucking killing the troll.
---
Ik that some randoms just go Monty to avoid the TK from parties, but as a person who plays with groups of people I can say that all it does is annoy the people in the party and then it causes the party players to make killing that Monty their life mission, even if means they'll lose the round.
---
I only tk if you provoke me, but there's people in my group that will tk you for being a random, and choosing a shield to protect yourself only gets them even more annoyed.
---
Your best bet is to probably ask them for a party invite.  That way, you can communicate, and they won't try and tk you anymore.
---
Well yeah, you can use macchanger programs or change it manually through Windows settings however, I believe that's just the broadcasted address. It would be interesting to look into the registry to see if the actual MAC is changed there. 
---
I don't get it either. Their account is just going to get banned and any wins, XP, K/D and renown they earned are just going to be gone.
---
I lost like 3 matches a couple weeks ago from this before the counter was discovered.

Could be worse, you could have paid for the valk skin, got new cameras, and then have them take that skin out completely and now your elite black eyes are the exact same as the normal ones.
---
Blitz throwing him the middle finger was the tipping point
---
i didn't realize lmao but imo i don't mind, it still looks nice to me
---
That's good.  That should keep you alive, when I play with my friends we'll sometimes invite randoms to the party and if they don't join, the rest of my group will tk and vote kick relentlessly.  If you join the party you're normally safe tho.
---
Tbh. If it annoys them any more. that just makes me feel better. If they lose I feel better

I did that last week to someone on bank alley window 😂

This game is only playable with 4 friends, no way around it.

You were going to get mad because anyone who does that glitch is a total turd, right? Right?
---
They removed it 
---
there are very few operators i would say are good on one platform and bad on another. i guess the best example of this would be both Glaz and Blackbeard, who are both incredibly powerful on pc but less so on console because of less precise aim. but in general i never have a problem with underpowered ops. imo, if the devs didn't have to account for console balance, both bb, glaz, and probably sheilds, would prob not be as strong on pc which i think would be better. but in general, i would say meta ops, with high fire rate guns, are even stronger on console than pc. I think 3 speeds are better on console than pc, with frame rate capped at 59 fps. i think high ammo capacity guns are stronger on console than pc. smoke is not as powerful on console because shotguns are less viable on console without the ability to lean while hipfiring, and the smg 11 being a difficult gun to reliably anchor with. it's small stuff like that. but ya hope that helps

Well, yeah I guess.  
---
&gt; If it annoys them any more. that just makes me feel better. If they lose I feel better
---
Well, why tho?  When it happens I gotta sit there for the next half hour hearing nothing but everyone else in the party screaming "wow what a faggot" cuz some random stole an operator or chose a shield to avoid the tk.
---
&gt;If they lose I feel better
---
Well, yeah, I guess...but normally that's not the case.  They'd probably rather just kill you than win, so loosing doesn't really annoy them, it's really just the shield that's annoying, more than the loss itself, since it blocks them from tk-ing you.  Lol
---
the guy blocked your internet access? Report it through the ubisoft page
---
Teaching people how to do the glitch is terrible and just spreads it, and pretty much, yeah, anybody who does the glitch in a RANKED game is bad, but I thought he was showing people how to do the bug, his game kinda started bugging out towards the beginning and middle and led me to believe he was trying to activate the glitch and show people how to do it.
---
Yes he did and alright 
---
Same...I wanna commit the non living

AND IT DOES!!! IM GONNA MAKE STUFF INTO OTHER STUFF!!!

You're completely misunderstanding what I'm saying. If you reread my original comment I stated that I agree that renown does not matter and my examples weren't intended to have anything to do with renown or the christmas packs. I was stating that saying that they don't matter for the sole reason of them being pixels isn't logical in today's world as matter.

I can tell by the fact that you looked down at the floor after like “wtf” haha I would be too

That honestly makes me question why anyone would even play the game. But I guess people just love being assholes these days.

Also, he doesn't have to be "way too close" since he's not even within electricity range currently.

Damn. Caveira in 4k. Ha!

I already have sledge should i get him nonetheless.

It’s somewhat common ground that PS4 is the most toxic community of the 3 but I have no PS4 so I can’t be the judge of that. I’ve played on PC and Xbox (mainly Xbox) and as I said the community I interact with is pretty friendly. Best way to counteract toxicity is to find people that are chill and add them and play as a team. 
---
As a 27 year old man I can take a joke. I just don’t enjoy the racism, homophobia, and the general mother fuckery. 
---
My group has a running joke of when someone gets tk'ed to send the victim akedent

you are

PS4 has a much higher player base atm so would that not effect how competitive it is?

Really? I find way fewer toxic people on PC than PS4.

My mate hit level 20 and wanted to play ranked with me, he played all his placements with me and placed gold 1 while I was only at gold3 (bad luck in placements) we then played 2 matches and he got plat with a 0.1kd, i was gold 2 with a 2.7kd.
---
I never hit plat that season 😿

Much surprise

Yo WTF that is some bull he's level 59 and he still has 0.6 KD and somehow he is plat 2

Yea those good friends are me lol

I know it's a game and it's not real and the drone can cloak and whatnot, but those little fans are not gonna lift this thing.

On a side note, I'd love one of these as a game room ceiling fan. 
---
Good Job.  Accurate.
---
I played on ps4 before and i play now xbox.
---
Xbox is more competetive. I once carried all my teams on ps4 and got downranked to bronze 3 bc my teammates were toxic or dumb. My first ranked match on ps4 was a french kid tking me because i took Twitch.
---
While on xbox one,I've seen many silvers and bronzes,infact even coppers,trying their best. And i saw rarely as much teamkillers in casual and ranked on xb1 than on ps4. Terrorists hunt? both platforms are terrible.
---
Is this due to the Jäger Himself video..?
---
Just curious, because everyone is referring to it on here. 
---
I'm not saying there isn't issues, but those types of videos only highlight the bad, what the editor wanted to get across, his narrative.
---
There are definitely issues, but it's also like that with any online game in general, I'm glad the community is highlighting these issues, but the "content creator" is making money off your outrage.

Operators always. But if you have them all save for diamond skin, people take you more seriously.

Dude, this is a game. Tell me about Gu Mines that are invisible or a drone that can do the same? We aren't based in reality here.

She's a hidden gem.

How about they fix the general sounds before we start asking for individual sounds to be changed. Operation Noise Bastion has been hell. I have A50s and havent changed any settings. New season starts, cant hear half of the game sounds (rapelling, dokkaebe calls, etc..). Such BS, this game is about sounds too and I have gotten killed so many times to sounds not working or being incorrect.

Always the french.

But then what if someone is being toxic in chat or comms? There is no reasonable way to fairly detect that.

Ah yes, it's as if nobody can pop out to shoot you while you stare at the ceiling.

Come on man, give better tips than that.

---
League can be a little heavy handed with the bans sometimes though. I do know people who got chat restricted just because the trolls on their team decided to report them and whatever algorithm is not very smart. I think it literally just surfs through the chat logs and bans you if it finds the right keywords.

I have solod and got with women. and never seen this happen. though i know it does. but i usually get the opposite. if a girl gets more kills she mocks you for being beaten by a girl in frags. so it goes both ways with toxicity.

I used to be a twitch main and there are 3 types. Ppl who just want to get a ton of assists and only use her drones for points. The trolls who just shock one or two ppl to annoy them.

Had a game the other day where two guys who sounded like they were around 18-24 were railing on women and ni**ers, saying how the country has gone to shit since they got rights.  Tried to call them out for trolling, get them to admit they're not being serious and quit that shit but they just doubled down.  I'm a white dude so it made me uncomfortable enough to leave, but I can't imagine how that would have felt as a female or a person of color.  There needs to be some way to report toxic voice chat.

A lot of people seem to pick Maverick more than Finka. While Maverick is indeed a good operator, Finka can change the outcome of a fight. When you decide to pick up Finka, I suggest you use the LMG simply because her assault rifle, while having almost no recoil, is shit.

You can buy the 6 charm that costs 1 r6 credit :)

"You're dead already, laddy."

My most is 17 in a 8 round ranked match. Also one tk. So call it 18. Very nice work on the 20 piece
---
They are training

Use shotgun. Ez Clap

Hello CantThinkOfAName6979, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acn8s2/the_weirdest_glitch_i_have_seen/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

why the hell would you wait in a queue for 15 minutes?
---
Im a plat 3 but I’ll play with anyone. Just worried if that will mess with matchmaking because I’ve heard diamonds can get queued with you
---
I like how you can always tell a repost by the garbage quality of the image.  I mean obviously this is Rogue9, but its really a common thing with reposters that they don't care if the content actually looks decent. Even simple infographics are made to look like crap. So good job guys for making it easy to tell you're post someone else's stuff. 
---
Been playing since beta. I couldn't agree more. The game was perfect right around the time of the first major fix. Then it devolved into a CSGO-like toxic cesspool. Team kills, toxic and racist in game chat, and all around shitty behavior. I can't even say GG and mean it nowadays without someone flying off the handle.
---
What glitch? I'm not asking how it's done, I just don't know what glitch is being referred to.
---
Trueeeee
---
Make r6 great again
---
Flash hider
---
Bandit's drugs are crazy
---
Yes please
---
Had back cancer 
---
I believe you could buy a standard operator. But if you have them all then pretty much nothing.
---
mine stays at around 9-20ish but that time it reached 2000, and everyone else was around 1500-1700. that was crazy to me. &amp; thank you i’ll try figuring it out lol
---
I’m level 120, been since alpha packs release, and still have zero legendaries.
---
Although the training Sim in the book is hated by Ding, I'm sure he would still be raging about hit boxes lol
---
Chronicle back pain
---
Because I play early in the morning like 2am sometimes and it's hard to find a match
---
That skin is gross tbh but congrats
---
yea got all ( i am on xbox) no starter
---
Your welcome
---
This has been a massive issue for 2 seasons and what does Ubi do? Fix it?? Not a chance. Make a blitz elite? Let's do it makes sense. Fuck you ubi
---
One time I legit stood in front of obj for a solid 10 seconds and nothing happened then the other person just drones in and scans it right away
---
At least 2 ops need to have a secret love child. Up to you who however I think Tachanka and Ela making a kid would be quite the thing.
---
So sledge with shield? 
---
Oh my bad, saw it on his insta and he didn’t Credit I didn’t think so figured it was him. Will change
---
I thought you were gonna say the 200 were spend in queue 
---
I swear I'm trying my best , even though I love playing alone it makes me focus more , I guess I just have to ..
---
Kinda depends. Like don't scan on Twitch's or Echo's drone. Callouts are better than scanning. Enemies don't know they are being watched so they don't suspect a thing.
---
This happens to anything that becomes big. Idk why people are simply attributing it to Siege or just gaming. This exists in everything.
---
People are shit. Always have been and always will be.
---
No, please no more shield ops
---
I just opened my pack less then five min ago and this message popped up saying, "You converted 0 HOLIDAY PACK. 0 (then theirs a big space almost like a tab) have been added to your account. You received 0 (space thing again) per pack." I looked to see if I gained the renoun and I didn't I have been saving up 180,000 and currently have 179,001 and it didn't change. I don't know how to upload a picture but I did take a picture of it if you want me to send it to you somehow. 
---
Thanks for the info, changed the credit!
---
What do you mean never load in? Like at all?
---
Do you mean it isn't a copy pasta yet? Haha. Impressive.
---
Haven't played in a while. What is the crouch spam and lean spam?
---
Uh did you read the post
---
First, they never issued bans for using glitches. Second, they most likely can't track whoever used this glitch as it's completely client side.
---
Is it something to do with it being broken for you but not others?
---
Or Kapkan and Finka
---
Probably flash hider or compensator is what I would use on it
---
Ikr happens to me all the time

If they're too far away or there is a lot blocking the character model, i guess it can glitch out. I haven't experienced any extreme cases of it tho.
---
Thank you. Ya lol when ever I tk I add it on to my total kills

Thanks man
---
Lol no I would've uninstalled at that point
---
Yah maybe make the bash 1 hit kill ppl too 
---
Appreciate the response 
---
i corrected it
---
Like every other shield you mean
---
Boost their ego cause they probably cant hold their high rank. 
---
Basically people bind their keyboard or elite controller in a way they can spam the crouch and lean buttons, this can also be done with mouse and keyboard, but it essentially makes it to where your character is wiggling around while shooting, making you hard to hit, while letting you get kills. 
---
It’s been a big issue recently, here’s what it looks like

Hello WORLD_OF_ARMY, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acnb9s/please_patch_this_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Breaching Charges. Not all that useful because so my operators primary gadgets outperform them. Not to mention lots of low levels use them when they shouldn't.
---
All I can a imagine now is a baby tachanka gurgling LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED
---
Yeah YouTube guides are great! I do have pretty good aim from the csgo transition so that's nice. Thanks for the peak tips that's something I usually do and I need to be more patient while on defense.
---
All I know for you to do right now is practice t-hunt until you’ve gotten accustomed to the gun mechanics on pc. After that, slowly increase your mouse sensitivity when you feel comfortable with your current setting. Only do this when you feel *completely* ready with your current sensitivity though
---
Fair bro, that's just what works for me😅
---
Sure just saying what results my experience got me, he's my main since day 1,but without headshots I'll just continue stacking up assists and losses
---
General Repsot
---
I'm saving up for cav, which will be my first bought character 9ther than jackal (which I got for free). Hopefully her pistol might do some good for me and my aim. 
---
except the french revolver has trash irons AND low capacity so what’s the balancing there
---
I love watching clash get destroyed. Hate that operator
---
Happens to me a lot 
---
She's fun, try her shotgun so you'll always stay in range that gets you max pistol dmg
---
Thanks for the tips dude! 
---
What does this mean?
---
Yup, I'm clearly a dumbass for suggesting trying out a fast paced arena style shooter to help get your bearings on a KB&amp;M.
---
Np, and good luck 
---
It's an old repost. 
---
Ah yeah, that one. That’d be pretty useful for R6, I agree.n
---
I’m yet to come across any real toxicity on PS4, those with mics in my teams are whiny kids from around Europe, I’d rather have someone toxic on the mic instead of a 8 year old...
---
I did this on oregon basement took site in 1 minute 
---
Not what I mean. I’ve been multiple operators over the last few days I’ve played and every time I’m flashed only my HUD disappears and leaves the enemy thinking they blinded/disoriented me and they rush and die because I can see. 
---
8 operators is fine keeps the game fresh. R6S is a game that you cant learn overnight. You can learn the basics and whatnot within a few days. To master the game you need well and truly over 1500 hours or more. 
---
Ubisoft has said it many times before each new season the new operators should be stronger than the previous. They analyse how strong they are and balance according. Tbh lion is the only op operator since then no operator has been this game changing. I believe ubisoft are producing well balanced ops but just tweaking them down a bit in areas where they are too strong.
---
Same for you man! 
---
Hahaha. I agree fully haha. Squeekers kill my game.
---
give this man an award for the sacrifice.
---
Yeah that's pretty much how it would ideally work but I feel like your karma shouldn't automatically come back on days you aren't toxic. While this may be harsh your karma should only be able to increase at the end of every season by a fixed amount depending how toxic you were. That way if trolls wanted to ruin other people's fun they would have to wait a long as time. In this time they would most likely get bored and move on to other games or try to be less toxic on siege.
---
Ah ok lol.
---
People ignore that lmg. Like why it's literally the same as the rifle with a 150 round magazine
---
Nada
---
is it just on the main page when you open it? I can't believe I've missed this. Also how long is it gonna be up? 
---
I don't even know why G2 hasn't signed me yet.
---
Shield ops require the least, playing Montagne you're main job is intel and gaining ground. 
---
But if you're really worried about your aim then work on your pre firing. It doesn't matter if your aim sucks if you shoot everything 
---
You basically had connection problems when you were watching the replays. Thats all.
---
Ah, so this bug is back. Haven't seen it for a year or so
---
I was in a game with someone with 9989 ping
---
Or when they forget they are not online and it’s by a person 
---
Join g2. let pengu carry you to the champion. 
---
I quit like 2 months ago, I got tired of all the bugs every update and the toxicity
---
Or give the joining player a reason to stay, a increase in Renown or Extra percent towards alpha packs. I will always leave a ongoing match. I want to play not spectate a 2:0 game then re-queue just to be placed in another. 
---
I did see more luck when playing blitz, and prefire doesn't work in the long ranges that I die to a doc or a rook 
---
My win loss ratio. 
---
I'll carry Pengu, he's nothing compared to me.
