This right up there...

---
---
If you get carried make sure you say "ez".
---
I think by utility he meant like if he’s banned someone could just run hibana
---
E
---
It took me a few looks to figure out who the chicken was in the top right corner.
---
It was in sure or it might of beeen Montagne but was decided to be too powerful if I remember correctly
---
Reporting a player doesnt help allow the support team track down who DDoSed their servers unless the dude typed it in chat saying he will DDoS you using X botnet at X:xx time. 
---

---
people dont use their personal devices to DDoS servers, these are 3rd party paid services that are anonymous. 
---
&gt;I'm not able to understand how they can DDos a server based game, 
---
Thats the only type of game you can  Please put more efforts into fixing the problem. I'm sure you will be more focused on a PC fix before console players like myself, 
---
This is also a PC problem. Also the only reason it looks like PC gets special treatment is because its a lot easier to patch things on PC. These patches also get to the console version of the game a bit later unless its a pc only issue.
---
&gt;Suggestion for escalation team for reports - If 1 Siege player is DDosing and gets reported
---
Doest matter, Its next to impossible to connect a random player online with a DDoS attack cause its technically not even them doing the attack. Its paid botnet services.
---
Sorry all, just trying to help but I deleted how to preform the glitch and have attempted to reach out to Ubisoft support directly to report the issue.
---
yeah him getting banned is why I started playing finka in ranked
---
I play console, see it every day
---
What
---
Ik but there would be a downside to it like health loss or shield goes down making you vulnerable
---
Mav is good for making assholes in a wall to get a sneaky pick on someone. Lion is good to keep someone from killing u/ur teammates while planting. Finka is nice cuz of the little boost she gives to people but isn't really game changing
---
Right, but the game can’t tell the difference, if you’re out the game and the game ends then you get this hours ban, doesn’t matter if you are out intentionally or not because the game can’t tell them apart, your idea is good for those who leave on purpose but it has too much collateral damage for those who are made to leave unintentionally.
---
So now anytime you accidentally shoot a teammate they take damage? Just as bullshit lol. 
---
When I'm playing with friends and I accidentally kill one I tell them to turn on reverse friendly fire. That way if I mess up again I'm the one punished. Seems fair to me.
---
That would be so hard for them to do
---
It is not a pc problem, it is horrendously rampant on PS4
---
It happens about 50% of ranked games
---
Wow thank you! Now I fee like an idiot for playing this game for three years and never noticing that.
---
Inhuman reactions
---
lmao my core i5 is physically 4 cores. go back to school kids
---
That wasnt for spawnpeeking, ubisoft has no issues with spawnpeeking. 
---
Its was because they were 3 speed operators with good guns and also good equipment.
---
They used their equipment and them run all around the map taking on attackers long range and then rotation around due to their speed. Thats why only 1 speeds can have acogs now defense.
---
How tf did he hit you? Is the accuracy that bad?
---
I find c4 to be most effective
---
Plus elite
---
Ok nice thought but that's enough of that.
---
God, that's so annoying.  I've had that happen.  This needs to be fixed.
---
Right? And I don’t know anything about game development to be fair, but I feel like transferring an assassination animation from AC into siege probably isn’t impossible. A hidden blade assassination as a replacement for the normal interrogation would be a dope version of a cosmetic change like the other Elites have.
---

Imagine Jager squeezes the face wash on your face and says "you should not worry about the acne now."
---
Est-ce que t'as oublié la vidéo ?
---
You're telling me 6hs after my 5 stack from different ISPs lagged out from our rank lobby that DDoSing is not a PC problem? 
---
DDoSing started off as a PC problem
---
You have a great point but I’m just fucking triggered that all teammates I get are little kids who decide we lost one round and they decide let me fucking leave this shitty ass game since we lost one motherfucking round
---
How about everyone after Operation Skull Rain?
---
Lmao could you image two/two blitz’s fucking kool-aid maning it through a wall? I would shit myself.
---
What are you on about? You said it wasn’t a console problem, I’m pointing out it is. Re-read what you said bud
---
Lion is total ass, he doesnt get good until you have high plat or diamond/pro players using him. Blackbeard is also useless in copper and bronze cuz nobody down there can hit headshots. BB gets really good in silver and gold, then weaker in plat, then better in diamond/pro. You see, operator's abilities and weapons are useless unless you know how to use their gadgets, so an operator's skill is determined by the people playing that operator
---
Why would you ever want crossolay on siege?
---
You can lean left on console, as far as you know he was being sarcastic
---
&gt; I Meant that DDoSing on PC isn't even an issue
---
Then just say that instead of typing ambiguous claims like "it isn't a thing". Obviously it is otherwise we wouldn't have prominent community figures like Macie, George and Pengu speaking out about it, nevermind their numerous rants about how toxic the community is. No offense but I'm going to trust the word of a diamond player that has several thousands of hours in this game over a random armchair server expert on reddit lol.
---
&gt; You're putting words in my mouth, and saying absolutely borderline retarded shit like
---
You don't really need any help saying retarded shit right now.
---
Wasn't he nerfed not so long ago?
---
On console people get the IPs for individual players off the party system for voice coms. Thats a console issue.
---
The server DDOS is attacking directly to the server which is a hard thing to stop when you dont manage the servers.
---
Is that a Mother Fuckin Jojo's Reference
---
It's so uncommon to run out of ammo and 20 damage is waaaaaay too much.
---
This shouldn't be in the game.
---
How did he kill him? Wut...
---
He was on mouse and keyboard and the only way to lean on console is by adsing and clicking left or right stick
---
needs to be fixed
---
console Beaulo, change my mind
---
“He then proceeds to lean left” nothing sus about that
---
Lol yuh ik
---
Do you even play console?
---
That's basicly what my third idea would be. Basicly remove the turret all together and give him the backpack o'bullets and the Russian LMG as basicly a third weapon then when he switches he gets a movement penelty for having the LMG out
---
You mean 6k?
---
Yeah i dont have any plaid like it :(
---
Im askin a bit but can you draw ela in an Adidas track suit thanksss amazing drawing lmao
---
Can you send a photo?
---
Alibi or mozzie are really good at anchoring or roaming depends on your play style.
---
Did you not place down your armor?
---
I've only ever smurfed a few times, but I always do it when my buddies are just starting off in the game. And if I smurf, I deliberately play like a fucking idiot because I know I can't hit anything with a P90 ACOG+Supressor, so its funny to just fuck around without forcing new players to play gold/plat with me.
---
Don't know, but it has happened to me before. I had to close out the game and rejoin
---
Hey this happened to me today and no one believed me!
---
Borderlands 1 2 TPS, cod, battlefield, overwatch, need I go on
---
Mozzie has a Commando that is ridiculous in a good way and a shotty for a side piece.
---
Counter idea: Blaine/Defender

Can levitate which causes no vibrations in the rooms he inhabits

"**SHeeeeeeeit**, its a *George foreman,* break out the bread and lunch-meat I wan a **sammich**!"

What does the hive mind think of MY comment?

Yeah, I like Mozzie, but I heard his shotty is really bad for damage
---
Vigil

Is that intended? Sounds like a glitch.

I mostly use it for breaking walls. I have killed a couple with it

The community is toxic. You'll get TK!d if you shoot at the person a friendly is also shooting at and get the kill, you'll get kicked if you don't clutch, it's just not epic.

Rook mine
---
i usually can get a few friend requests in ranked if  we win and they have a mic

His shotgun is trash. It basically has to be in their mouth to kill, and sometimes not even then.
---
Using black book of communism and victims of communism foundation as your sources is the same as using DPRK and USSR government statements as your sources.  They're pure propaganda without much truth behind them.  The authors of the Black book have even said that before they started research that they decided on the hundred million figure and then made everything else fall in line with that's.  I've never heard of the other books but they sound like the same unempirical drivel.  
---
There's been atrocities committed in the name of communism but there has been for literally every belief, people have slaughtered in the name of Buddhism.  It is important to distinguish between inherently violent ideologies and the rest of them.  There are plenty of lil communist communes just chilling on the fringes of society that don't interact much at all with the rest of the world.  Compare that to something like Nazism where even when out of power it still advocates for and works towards violence because it is central to the ideology that the "lesser" humans should be eliminated.
---
some\*; old and/or low power Core i5 are dual core processors.

I ment to tell you that perhaps yours was actually a dual core and it may be the reason why it didnt work.

That was out of place, but well. Not many friends uh? Can't help it i guess, some people just act like assholes instinctevly.

Yes

Let's make another meme format and get it big.

Happy cake day
---
You think or are being told there is no evidence that he is cheating but clearly he was. You be surprised how many people casually wall without being obvious and won’t be banned for while . If glassy can blatantly cheat for over a week while being on numerous streams r6 streams, top of the leader board for pc for Elo and ranked , and be reported by HUNDREDS of people, what makes you think a smart cheater can’t pull that off and lie to his “friend”. So yeah he must of cheated during those games and no it’s not a punishment because those games were unfair to the other team because they had a disadvantage against a cheater whether they knew it or not. If you were on the other team how would you feel if you were in that predicament ?
---
Ok thanks
---
I mean, been a thing for years with no changes to it
---
Ela has a good shotgun
---
I also forgot to mention that I really designated marksman rifles
---
Not my idea of fun but you do you.
---
You geniu
---
Welp if you ever wanna play please dm, trying to meet new people to play with.
---
As soon as that vote to kick banner pops up, suicide and leave. Fuck toxic casual kids bro😎
---
I think you can also do it in TH if I recall
---
Bruh he kept going after that last kill and was killed as a result, if they down and you’re surrounded, leave them and focus on the ones that can still shoot. It was a good play till the end.
---
bruh 😂😂😂😂👏
---
All good, enjoy your next operator!

Not everyone can afford a PC good enough to run rainbow

Yeah we tried reporting to ubi and it’s so sad because this is on console too
---
Could be either. Any way I can know who has been in?

It’s funny how people even do this in casual. At that point... why?
---
But yeah, it sucks and is becoming super common.
---
yea usually if we lose the randoms just leave sad and move on

The art style is originally from Tom and jerry for those who don’t know

I had a 4 stack run into my thermite charge once. Killed 3 of them and I got temp banned for team kill. Don't know if I'd get temp banned with the vote these days, but it's still easy to be a toxic dick if you want to be.
---
I think you can check who's logged into your account on your Microsoft account page (if you're XB1) to see if it was a different system but from your system I don't know of a way
---
That’s where the problem is, I have both a VPN and a networking system ran off of switches so I’m protected for the most part but apparently I’m better off then ubi cause they still haven’t fixed it
---
I would be willing to play casual with a little less renown for a non team killing mode.
---
Uninstall and reinstall bc trying to install it again will make the little hamster that runs Ubis servers have a stroke

Go up hatches? Seems like your just gonna be super vulnerbal . Go places yiu currently can’t? Like where?

If you want to report, report it yourself don’t share to everyone...

I'm interested in why its that three out of anyone, It seems like the weirdest combo of characters and not by gadget but by personality and appearance

Ying and Mira. Mira is one of the most powerful defensive ops bc she gets that sweet sweet information and her guns are bomb. Ying is a meme and a half when going for site takes and plants

That’s where Alt+F4 comes in

Or atleast I should gain ELO for *my* skills instead of ELO being judged on my *teams* skills. I lost almost all of my fucking placements and didn’t gain ELO because of this retarded system of gauging skill based on how well your **team** does, not *you* as a single player. I get this system for 4 or 5 stacks, but for solo queuing players? This mechanic **Does Not Work**. If you loose a match, sure, remove some ELO, but depending on your kills and assists, give ELO back to Account for **the individual players skills** instead of just out right loosing ELO. Fucking hell.
---
thats great and ik that but I was wondering if someone has more in depth the differences
---
I mean... We know the definition of intentional, right?
---
I played my first placement this season and after the second round two of my teammates left and we lost 2-4
---
Yikes 0-8
---
Found four. I’m telling you right now that is incredible. One of my favorite game inspired art pieces. Highly creative. Great execution. Thank you for the post!
---
Maybe try out for Fnatic if your so good. That way you'll have reliable team mates all the time.
---
Even if he did mind, how is he gonna know? I love mingo though and hopefully he makes a thermite one someday!

Thank you u/I_wana_fuck_Twitch

Oh ok

Press no, the team is left with the player that can't shoot properly.
---
2 points, and if u have already initiated the vote kick once
---
Yea and it works on fortnite like that
---
I'm playing pretty much casual only this season and I haven't seen any sort of toxicity tbh  
---
It seems that people still make callouts, coordinate and overall play seriously without sweating too hard, which is heaven coming from Overwatch's QP.  
---
I'm not sure if I'm just getting extremely lucky with the teams or is it a meme at this point to go "siege community bad and toxic"
---
Servers crashing on Console isn’t very common, players start dying on one team and the server becomes laggy, I’m pretty sure you can tell and outside source is interfering with the game. At least give the MMR back
---
Yes that is very true. I like gaming very much
---
Play ranked on your own, learn the maps, the more you lose the closer you are placed with people with similar skill, and eventually the more you play the better map knowledge you have which then leads to more wins. Etc etc etc
---
When you lean right it’s still kinda there but when you lean left it’s just fine for some reason lol
---
This just makes it so frags are all that matters. You can get 2-3 kills every round and not have any meaningful impact on the round. Cool, you killed Valk and Cav, wall still has a Kaid on it and can't be opened, your team probably still loses.
---
Siege is a team game. If ranked was based on the individual then team comps would never exist and everyone would run a 3 speed roamer.
---
Ubi has to use Microsoft and Sony servers, so they have to have ms and Sony let them know when the server crashes/lags. A lot of the problems with fixing console is bc ubi is running their game on other companies’ hardware and interfaces
---
Yeah I agree but the only problem is that the abilities of some defenders wouldn’t be so good on classic.
---
I mean, if you are playing a fragger operator is dumb to crouch walk, if you are playing a roamer counter such as jackal or nokk then is dumb to ask you not to do it.
---
OP sure didn’t
---
Is it?
---
Till you hit it with a drone 😂
---
Could have been MMR rollback if you played with/against hackers, but that shouldn't set you back that far
---
With a kill like the one above you really think it would happen three times?
---
Yeah it set me down really far and I might just be forgetting a few games, but I saw an Xbox logged into my account that I don’t recognize
---
You get treated badly in CSGO?
---
İf you guys play mordhaue just played it with degault ultra i get 20 to 40 fps im suffering
---
Can hold a man... but not a 2 pound drone
---
If there’s a ps4 companion app, u should try that. Idk for sure but that’s how it works for Xbox. Make sure the clip is actually uploaded to psn and not just saved to the physical ps4 memory
---
What's better; possibly happening 3 times max, or possibly happening 2 times max?
---
My apologies!
---
A fair point, though I’m sure the values or somethin’ else could be adjusted to make it so they don’t fully matter.
---
Rarely, but only if I choke at the end of a round or something. Like I said, I can deal with banter, but I don’t understand why I’m constantly getting kicked or TK’d. It’s ruining this game for me.
---
#YOUR POSITION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED
---
You must not be very good then eh? Cav is good against people who go off on their own. And cavs pistol used to do 99 damage up close, she got technically a buff a few patches ago where her damage drop off is now more consistent with other pistols but her pistol is still 2 shot down at close range. But her gun got reduced ammo capacity, bigger recoil, and the base hipfire spread increased. She punishes players who go on their own, if she downs a player and goes for an interrogate by your teammate saves you, your now at a 5v4 advantage. Cav is a high skill op, knowing when to interrogate and when to give up the interrogate. So tl;dr git gud
---
i play on xbox and this has happened to us before, they lagged it when we were on attack and were forced to push the site with 40 seconds left. sad thing is, the kid who was doing it was proud to reach platinum but only made it from pure cheating.

Someone please add a mortal combat fatality to this
---
Honestly. No matter how ypu look at it....its kinda like trying to say bubbles angry. You just cant be mad at that
---
A: its a team base game, you can carry your team but end of the day the results of your teamwork will show on your rank/mmr.
---
B: Kills dont mean anything in the game, How will this new system of yours help a support player that got the key walls/hatches opened, got rid of most defender equipments and then planted the defuser. 
---
Should the guy going in after all this and getting a few kills get more mmr than the support player cause they got more kills ?
---
I don't see the point of going up hatches, it makes you vulnerable, can't either think to go on strange places.
---
Yeah I play a fair share of online multiplayer games and my friends and I agree that siege has the most toxic player base

You can camp there with your c4 out and once you hear them break the barricade twice just yeet the c4 and blow it, it works every time
---
Personally I feel like it’s fair. Because in most circumstances, on most maps, the defenders have an advantage just because they’re defending. Now this is assuming both teams are evenly matched but because of that distinct advantage, Ubi decided to give the attackers a little advantage as well
---
They might be less legendary than you think. Higher ranks is all about teamwork. 100% communicating through microphones and all have assigned roles. Watch some of Pengu's videos with team comms to see how they communicate.

 Essentially the 5 players act as 1.

Aoe is much bigger, and it has a concussion effect now.
---
I didn’t get carried. I didn’t do great a couple games but also had an ace clutch (with Mute) 2 games before I got plat, and last man standing in all our wins the game right after the ace. Not bad gun skills but just not consistent compared to a lot of the better G1/plat folks I see.

clearly you need to get some defenders to balance your list ;)

It was so nice back when you could carry multiple at a time. Just resupply -&gt; plant like 30 times then mine the entire map
---
Can I get an explanation of what Hi-Fi is?
---
&gt;everyone starts at 2500 elo flat when placements start, 
---
Not since the last season, its a soft reset now. You start in the middle of your last season's mmr and 2500 mmr. unless you didnt play last season or are a new player. 
---
OP didnt say anything about throwing any games after getting their wins so thats a lot of projection on that reply.
---
So you barely play the game but still actively participate in the community, a little weird but I fuck with it.
---
Apparently in some sort of background info, Pulse and Lesion are moved into the CBRN (and is the motivation for lesions elite) so they might be characters in it as well.
---
Why would he need a ACOG when he has a big ass sniper with a big ass scope? New buff looks pretty sick.
---
Thank You Thank You!!!! I love It!!! May i use her as a profile pic?!?’b
---
Anyone else see the writing I deadass just shit my self
---
I play here and there. The games not like it used to be so its tough to just jump back in and enjoy it. But always loved Siege so, yeah I peep this sub lol
---
Would happen every now and then on Xbox when my squad would play. Ddos the game server and everyone gets kicked out. I get that it isn't a lost but it's just a waste of time. We would be high plats. It was always easy to see when it was gonna happen. The players are really bad and you get 3-0 reallll quick. Then you wait for the kick.
---
lesion
---
that means you’ve had hackers/cheaters on your team more than once
---
Get nae naed
---
I've had it for the whole lobby on Xbox. There's also individual too but I heard the person they want to kick has to open a message from them like a chat invite or something. My team doesn't accept anything from the other team. We just so get boooted.
---
How do you know thats for the hacker you reported. You can have multiple games with hackers on it, even games you won.
---
Is it blue or orange?!????
---
This is the best art I've seen on here no cap
---
Because he IS black
---
Never happened to me and my friends ever

“Dude I’m not gonna be able to do shit with you in my ear stfu” works pretty often and if it doesn’t the L is officially on the form it shutting up

I feel like I'm watching a documentary on Recruit's in their natural habitat, honoring their fallen brethren.

Jerry is in big trouble

They also said they are tracking the stats across all games now.  So they'll be able able to identify the habitual assholes.

No worries to my girlfriend LOL

good point, that's the only one i was aware of, it would be really shitty if he didnt get cough as it was really obvious

I’d count that as an ace (if I counted correctly)

That would be waaaay too exploitable. Trolls would make aly accounts that they don’t care about, get to a high rank and just constantly leave to lower people’s Elo. And before you say anything, yes more than half of the siege community would do this just to fuck up peoples elo.

I've been playing the game for a couple of months now, but when I started I got around bronze 2. But Rainbow is a really challenging game. I'd say if you have history with fps games Siege will be easier. For me, I would play survival, roleplay games and such, and I'm still around silver 1. But my friends who have history with fps games are higher (gold 2). But yeah, if you just started playing the game, I'd say Silver 4 is a good placement!
---
Yo, you right, homie. #UbisoftListenUp
---
How did you acquire that information?! That was a black op!
---
Why lol
---
I agree. T Hunt sucks ass and the situations are boring, but this is pretty much a strictly competitive game these days. If you play ranked with a good team, it's a lot of fun.
---
I use reflex, vertical, and flash hider. I don't fire full auto for long periods of time so the compensator doesn't help recoil as much as the flash hider does.
---
Scopes on shotguns are mostly unnecessary as you can just hipfire with them as long as you bring a laser sight.
---
But if you want a good scope I'd recommend the russian reflex
---
when in doubt comp, but depends on the gun. rest is preference and just no to red dot
---
Depends the gun

Why isn't this in hot yet, best thing i have seen in weeks
---
Drone a lot. Droning saves lives, especially against Caveira and Vigil. Even if you can’t see Vigil you may spot his ability being used and know it’s unsafe to go that way.
---
Can't say the word crash or exploit or the bot removes it. People need to know about this so when they see someone spamming chat with macro, they know the enemy team is trying to kill the session to avoid lost MMR.

Good advice. I only have like 3 friends who play the game and we've come from csgo.

Thanks.

Musta flicked a little too fast

Whenever i see a security camera, i have a feeling to shoot it
---
It’s called data limitations. A game can only get so big before it can no longer expand, so things have to be cut to save room for content years to come.
---
But the glitches.
---
Having a glitch in a game for 1 and 1/2 months is unacceptable

I mean make the good callouts if people aren't gonna listen they aren't gonna listen, regardless wether 2 most likely higher pitched voice (based off their age) people keep "yelling" at them. I know when I'm playing I prefer science cause my headphones are awesome and I can hear everything.  That said a single call out is fine but more then you are back seat gaming which imo is as bad as being intentionally toxic.

I get your point but you can’t be mad at them and expect to receive compensation for something that was out of their control. If anything you should be mad at the dumbasses that used the glitches that took her and shields out of the game. I’m not a programmer but I’m sure it’s not that easy to fix something like that and I for one am happy that she is out of the game because I play rank and it would completely break the game.

Or even better be obviously facing the doorway but wait to let the server tell you you're facing the other wall.

It's either that or make it so colourblind people hair can't really play, if they do the changes strategically and one by one it can work

An important bit left out, Doc's stims are not hitscan like most of the other projectile launchers in the game. If they're moving, point and lick will result in a miss. Make sure they stand still.

the amount of people leaving when downed by cav is way less than 1% compared to the amount of people that just d/c cause they d/c from what i've seen when playing.

i'd rather have the devs code if the person is downed by cavs weapons and leaves within a few seconds then they should be banned
---
I like the map rework. While the new OPs’ gadgets are mixed/recycled, I think they bring something new to the table.
---
I’m personally very disappointed with the gun choices and how not a single new gun came with them.
---
Nokk is a very unique Attacker and she deserves her own gun so she can be buffed/nerfed without hindering other operators. Just not the folding glock. 
---
For a 2 speed operator, whose job is to enter obj and take out anchors, her gun feels inadequate for the job. 
---
As long as anchors are keeping their job of paying attention to site entries and holding angles, Nokk’s only chance of taking down anchors who have more armor, range, and sometimes in damag, is to get a headshot immediately upon entering the room.
---

They could make it like Paladins, where there **is not any “Leave Game” button**.

To leave the ranked match, you have to unplug your router or close the app. Both of these options take more time than instantly leaving the game and rejoining.

I think you could in Grim Sky, but not anymore... :(
---
7. Also: There is no escape, your position has been compromised
---
not to forget the electronic parts, for example, the receiver for the detonator
---
So the simple answer to this is yes, we will see more skins and/or sets added to the game to express individual teams. The Pilot Program last year was a success for all parties, and Ubisoft announced that Step 2 would be underway some time in year 4. There was an application process for this program, and the results are already in for the teams involved. The community will just have to wait until Ubi deems us ready to receive them.

Ah yes almost forgot

And at that moment he knew he fucked up

I knew about this wall and have only used it while defending but for some reason never thought about using it on attack

i can use u/uwutranslator cuz hes banned ;---;

There are some mouse and keyboard users and DDOS hackers on console, too.

And then you lose a gunfight because of that BS.

Its a great gun with high rpm good damage minimal recoil and an angled grip. Just cause you need an lmg to hit something doesnt mean its the guns fault. learn to aim.

How can you answer so fast?

If you’re using PS4 Pro it might be worth turning off as you’ll have a slightly better response time and more stable frame rate. On PS4 it probably won’t make much difference

Don’t think of it as a shotgun, it’s pretty much a dmr it’s range is huge because it fires a slug

Fair, I assumed so

WOW

Bot, i'm going through its comments right now

He will lead everyone to victory.

It's a slug shotgun, so the range is nearly unlimited. Just test it out in T-Hunt
---
Caveira is coming
---
You can clearly see that the first shot was below, and the second above her.
---
yes please
---
It’s more like griefing to me. And they do it within the first round. Ping abuses and shit. They want that sweet 3-0 victory.

Because there are Bugs in this Game? I had multiple issues with the VOIP Bug or just a random framelock on 30 FPS where i need to restart my Game.

I never knew about that, learnt something new to use in the matches.

Thank you! I made many more, check the links I posted !

Ok thanks i was guessing something like that.

Yeah or atleast a notification or a little sign saying it doesnt work would be nice.

How frightening would it be to see this pop up instead of 'your position has been compromised'

there is a minigame with a new "western themed" website

Too overpowered imo. And it basically deletes the teamwork you need to push. But it would be fun to try for a while

Depending on who you ask, it was either really funny, or really crap. The people who believe this game should be taken 100% seriously and be 100% tactical are the same people that play MnK on console and brag about just barley getting into plat 3.

Personally in was refreshing to play something silly and just screw around.

Tell the other team to know how to use comms and hear a sprinting german trackstar right next to them
---
No.  The effect is the same whether they surrender, you win 5-4 or you win 4-0.  The only things that matter in calculating how much MMR you gain are that you won, the likelihood of that result (i.e. the MMR of the two teams) and your uncertainty value (which starts high and goes down as you play more matches).

Ddosing isn’t solvable without seriously affecting how fast and smooth servers run. Even then, it’s not up to Ubi to solve it since they use Microsoft servers. I would assume it would also be very difficult to be able to determine if you were Ddossed or just lost connection from normal ping issues to regain MMR. Coreross better explains this:

You never stopped moving and running, is the other team just noobs with no headset? Holy.

I'd recommend you don't constantly move, they can hear you and you can't hear them. It's good to find a spot, listen, then either wait or attack.

Lmao it even affects the advertisement screens in swiss train stations

People have been complaining about DDos running rampant lately but I personally have not experienced it at all. I just believe it's Ubi's servers dying and people are just looking for an escape goat.

No one is brave enough as Fuze

Ubisoft can't really do anything. It is up to Microsoft and there cloud service Azure to fix this, but if they would fix this there would possible be more lag and micro stutters

Calm down. Stop moving so much

Really? I started playing like 2 weeks after this monstrosity!
---
I personally think that front lobby area is a bad place to hide. If the attack would of droned properly you would of been toast.
---
Yeehaw!
---
I hope so. Wasnt that also the way they did it in the last event? 3 packs for free max?
---
I saw rank a long time ago, like a hacker. Our delay is very low, but the situation is the same as yours.
---
I only want something for Maestro and Alibi. Since I have 1200 credit from previous 2 pass purchases, I guess it doesn't hurt to try.
---
Got 3 gun skins and Rook's outfit, which looks pretty nice but I don't play him much nowadays :/

You need to calm yourself dude this isn’t fucking pro league.

I wouldn’t be surprised if Ubi made the in game one actually LEGO 🤣

1.9 percent?
---
Would’ve been fun if they made this revolver only somehow
---
Event?
---
Foreshadowing?
---
You can Check it under collection at the Alpha pack menu
---
How did you get a 1.9% chance
---
What event is it?
---
God I can’t wait to get homr
---
Depends really on what you play. Different companies apis are both integrated into different products, hence anything on UE4 and games like seige will run better on nVidia, while others running Vulkan will run better on amd.
---
Either way they are both a good pick. I tend to find the build quality of the AMD cards to be better then nVidias. A lot of 3rd party vendors like msi and saphirre usually use sub par capacitors and vrms on their nVidia cards I find, whereas the cooling systems on AMD for some are really questionable.
---
I recommend either a 2070 or Vega64. Just don't fuck around with xfire or sli... They are basically pointless for 90% of games. 
---
Also note that if you want to do 144hz at 4k you are better off waiting. The cards we have now are more optimized on the end of 1440p graphics and don't do so well pushing out 4k above 60fps.
---
Yes. Kaid shotgun is so broken it might as well be a DMR.
---
You can’t buy just a single operators skin? I’m trying to Jeffrey Dahmer Twitch

The pricing for the packs are so dumb...
---
This is really pissing me off too. They used to be insync

By reset you mean it just removes all your att. And skins, or literally takes away your skins?

I once played a ranked match against no one
---
Nope, it's random, and there's 31 items so the chances of you getting what you want first try are slim.
---
unrealism? Outbreak happened, and now Quarantine. That's more unrealistic than a space ship.
---
Oh damn. Didn't know you found it first. I found it naturally and i just posted it on reddit
---
Nah I was making a joke, I know eho psycho mantis is
---
I feel console is better when it comes to hackers. Idk if it’s a random thing but everytime the server get ddosed I never lose mmr, kinda suck I don’t get the win but rather lose nothing then have someone teleport to me and kill me every round
---
Didn't even notice they did that, but this has made up my mind. Ranked sucks now
---
It should be but I'm not sure, I'm on pc
---
So the update did bring the event lmao
---
I don't think the compensation should be expected. It's renown, not money, you got all that renown playing the game... They don't owe you more. They might give a booster for everyone but not people who play Clash a lot specifically ffs. It's a game, do you enjoy playing it, or do you just enjoy getting free renown for not playing it?
---
I do the same and just play through the same Steam but with different Uplay account.
---
Don't really need to do anything but log into solo queue Uplay account.
---
Its from Outbreak.
---
The event came out days after this patch so yes
---
Hmmm sounds like someone’s  not shooting people in the head  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Knifing, don't even bother.
---
REEEEEEE!!!
---
The gun skin for alibi is pretty dope

This isn't even your picture. In yours you see holding a revolver and in this it's the bosg.

The sad thing is it’s only a limited time til that voice goes away...
---
Can we just get the game breaking bugs fixed instead?

I've got glaz' and rook's uniforms, both of which I already have the elites for. Not complaining too much though, I'll definitely use them for a while
---
With the new event you only get 0.7% per victory and 0.5% per defeat, I assume because the rounds are shorter.
---
*m'lord*
---
Curious...
---
Im literally not going to sit here and argue. But youre wrong. 100 percent wrong. The files for this event were released alongside the Phantom sight patch just like rainbow is magic. The proof of this is that the event was leaked at the end of may when the update was added to the test server. The update that came out recently fixed bugs.
---
##THE EVENT WAS INCLUDED IN THE PHANTOM SIGHT UPDATE. THEY PRESS A BUTTON AND CAN ACTIVATE AND DEACTIVATE IT WHEN THEY WANT.
---
Yall notice how Maverick looks just like Arthur Morgan
---
Copy pasta
---
Shift +f2
---
I don’t even have maverick but if you don’t use the fifty cal then why even own maverick
---
I think they just did something fucky with the damage models and it feels like a hitreg issue
---
He couldn’t handle being banned in ranked.
---
How do you know? You don't work for Ubisoft lmao and this happened last season with Air Force Cute, a update came out and 3-4 days later the event came out.
---
You can earn (a couple of) them, though. There'll be challenges on Thursday
---
How do I get this skin?
---
If you are talking about the BOSG skin it mentioned, I think you will get it through completing a mission
---
ok
---
This thing happened to me too on Oregon it sucked cause the other team just picked toxic ops and rushed
---
Lol ok :D
---
HOW DID YOU DO THIS WHAT
---
In case someone doesn't have the ops, or the ones they do own get picked
---
Do you know what mission by any chance?
---
😭 dont spoil my dissapointment ok? Lol
---
I actually heard that they hired a lot of first-year developers so they gave them fewer things to do so they weren’t overwhelmed.
---
And a 2 hour ban
---
Absolutely but I’m antisocial and don’t wanna talk to people. I play while my fiancé coaches me on by sitting next to me and telling me I’m trash when I miss my spawn peeks and what not and my headset doesn’t have a mute button and I don’t wanna bug everyone with our chatter so I just solo queue and hope for the best.
---
U/I_wana_fuck_Twitch
---
They were leaked duh. :) the main patch doesn't come with the event the mid season patches do. Only the audio files were in the main update. If the whole event dropped with the main patch then maybe we would of seen all the content other then the cosmetics and the audio. :) You're not very knowledgeable are u?
---
my bad, didn't see that button
---
fuck thats sad
---
Have you ever seen Back to the Future 3?

Let me know if you find out! I love the new skins but i wish everything showed on the loading screen

Do you think they just whipped this up? They didnt have this all set to go weeks/months ago, my lord you people dont think before you comment
---
a young lad are yee?
---
The Ubisoft club challenges are from last week and haven't been updated. Or at least for Xbox they haven't
---
how much do i deserve then hhhh
---
This is actually amazing
---
Nah he couldn't he had reverse friendly fire
---
I think they are doing this to test for a TDM mode which I think would be cool because I love the gunplay in siege
---
They typically have a challenge for 1 or 2 additional event packs. With the change to how they set up Ubisoft challenges, I think it will be available starting Thursday (take this with a grain of salt).
---
It is a neat event idea. But with the lack of destructible stuff, limited choice of weapons, and no operator ability, it is already seeming kind of repetitive to me. Still thanks for the event.
---

Take your upvote and get back to work

you'll get two of them for free(one by logging in and one by completing the challenge that will be available on thursday). If you want more then--&gt;$$$$$$$$

---
Just so I have this right...
---
Instead of working on this over the past months, you think they just threw this togther in a few days therefore making them not able to work on bug fixes?
---
Thanks community, it amazes me some of you are even able to turn in the game with the lack of common sense I see here
---
What map is that?
---
You didn't even notice, meaning it had no impact on you up until someone mentioned it? That's like a kid seeing that he grazed their knee 15 minutes ago and then crying
---
How good of a shot are you
---
I've already invested a shit ton of money and I've spent plenty on elites and other small purchases. The fact that I have to gamble for these (actually great looking) cosmetics is infuriating. Make it a collection we can spend real money on to get complete sets and literally every complaint disappears. It can still be limited time to push for purchases, just the alpha pack system is fucked.
---
To be honest, it's so damn hard to aim with the hand like this.
---
I'm on vacation and won't be back until like the 15th, so I'm not gonna be able to play it really :(
---
How
---
I agree.
---
Naw man I must be blind because I can’t see either
---

It's called a joke dumbass

Its cosmetics and literally affects the game 0%

Different recruits where different armor depending on ctu.

How much does this cost in USD?
---
I have multiple questions and I would like some answers if someone is kind enough 
---
When did this drop ? 
---
How long is it going to last ? 
---
Did this drop out of nowhere ? 
---
Was this announced beforehand ? 
---
Is the game mode fun ? 
---
Are the skins cool ? 
---
( I’m crying inside cuz I can’t play the game until next week or more )
---
?
---
 No problem!
---
He's having a falling dream
---
THE FUCKING PRICE TAG IS THE DIFFERENCE.
---
Dude, you have to pay REAL money to get these and you still can't choose which item you want to get. Sure, you can spend money on renown boosters to get more renown to spend on Alphas but it doesn't affect anything whatsoever. 
---
Paywall predatory mechanics is what's the difference between the two. Too bad you don't see that. 
---
And before you say 'b-but you get two for free!'. It's like a dopeman who gives you free first-time shit to hook you up and make you a regular.
---
Perfect
---
#Great #scott
---
What does that have to do with the subject at hand? Are you just going through the thread to shit on people who are concerned with the gambling system?
---
There's an event goin? Is it on PS4 yet?
---
There’re only two types of men in this world.
---
Wait so you are mad that the western event doesn't have a prep phase, but you want a mode that has respawns?
---
I'm aware, I just don't care.
---
He still would only have like a day to play
---
#Obviously skill
---
the mode doesnt have 3 original operators on each side, so when they are picked and someone doesnt have a dlc op, they get recruit
---
I understand, but a little cowboy hat maybe ?
---
Its real ??
---
I read him wrong, thought it said "whats' the delorean
---
The title is you just activated my trap card
---
Welcome to every modern aaa game
---
Started playing during closed beta and its crazy how many things have changed, from recoil control pattern, hit reg, map reworks and operator balancing. And of course everything in between 😂
---
Capitao makes me laugh so hard
---
A 6 inch blade and bear traps never lose reception
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Lmao 90% of the outfits are just recolors. The hats are the only worthwhile things and even then they looks vaguely similar to each other. I don't think this cash grab could be any more blatant.
---
Cool so have I, doesnt make you special
---
And you dont have to gamble, you spend money you get an item 100% guaranteed, thats not gambling at all just because it isnt the one you want doesnt mean you get to throw trigger words around and act like a child
---
The way that the game runs, you can not load maps if they are hidden, unless you have the dev panel which no player has access to. Players can access cosmetics because they are image based and are accessible by placing the event file into the folder that shows inventory (owned cosmetics). The map itself is over 2gb in size with the recent patch containing 75% code and actually being smaller than that. The latter of the recent patch actually fixed some clipping issues in walls on fort worth and missing textures/colour on some uniforms for ash and maverick (new collection cosmetics). But what do I know eh!
---
that's happened to me before except I launched Siege on my laptop screen, was real annoying to fix
---
honestly I don't even think they look different depending on which ctu u choose. Maybe I'm wrong but idk I haven't really notest any difference in design. Ik that depending on which ctu u choose will make ur armor and speed different
---
Dropped today. Lasts until 16th July (it’s in the thread title, come on dude, there’s lazy and then there’s LAZY :) ) I don’t think it was initially announced before but the cosmetics were leaked and an event was speculated. Not played yet. Se of the skins look cool (and it’ll be random allocation so you may need to buy them all to ensure you get the ones you want).

Not denying it. They can easily maximize their profit because tons of people buy the whole collection. Not defending it, but they do it for a reason.
---
smh bruh the real waifu is thicc boi rook
---
Bend over or drop the GG

I really only selected the original ops because their intros are consistent graphics-wise. I might give the other ops a go if I could find some decent clips.

Thank you :)

It's an issue with ReShade. You need to enable an effect or remove it from your game directory
---
I was so excited for the western themed cosmetics then I remembered they’re shitty packs and you can’t buy what you want and all my excitement went away.

yeah if the sight is like 15m away from u

Ok NOW I want to know what's in the canister.

 Why did not they do a Thermite skin? He was born in Texas...

ok bro go back to r/teenagers

it would probs increse amount of people playing casual nad people will ask for the rework to be revoked cuz they wll like th eold one more
---
the new one is too dark for me
---
I mean, yeah, 100 people buying a 20 dollar pack will definitely net them more money than 100 people buying a 5 dollar item. There isn't anything to argue there. My point is that if 100 people can just buy the 5 dollar item they want then they will. But, like in the case of these packs the total is what like 60 dollars or something to get enough credits to buy them all? How many of those same 100 people that just wanted one item will buy 60 dollars worth of currency to obtain the singular 1 5$ item. It turns a lot of people away and with that wasted time and effort into making those items, and loses out on the cash. I guess sure it only takes a handful or two of those 100 people to spend the full amount to get everything to make up for those who didn't but any due to it being a lottery but that does not annoy me any less. They choose to do this lottery thing in an attempt to cash grab as much as they can. It might not be a major fuck you to the buyers but I'd be more willing to spend money on the game if I knew what I was getting vs it being random and I'd assume the same for many others.
---
I assume there will always be fanboys that drop money into R6 without thinking about it, and yeah hard numbers would tell one way or the other but if the 5 at a time people would lose out to the few that buy everything to get what they want, I don't think its much of a loss either way, just one way appeals to the players more.

He is an anchor this makes no difference. Making his shield bigger is better. You could also boost him by making it so he can move his turret slowly(without firing) when also holding his primary or secondary in his left hand with low accuracy.
---
Hmmmmm somewhat racist lol
---
My source is the game being unplayable for two seasons in a row showing that not enough resources were allocated.

what should i be grateful for xdddddddddd

this actually made me laugh thank you buddy :D

---
Console gang
---
But can you *BLAM ker-chunk BLAM ker-chunk*?
---
Ubisoft doesn't need easy money, they are a multi billion dollar company. They'd make enough money just from events generating more interest in the game and people spending money on the regular microtransactions without adding in extra shit to pay for in a AAA game.
---
tell me how can you be salty over a gamemode xdd
---
Teamkilling is really bad though in the 4 games ive played ive been tk'd twice
---
I honestly think part of the problem is how the new version looks, just from a visual point of view it just is gloomy and dark and it makes it look shit, if they make it a little brighter or vibrant and people will slightly like it more despite the design flaws.
---
But doesnt it always start at 2%?
---
They dont want too many fraggers on attack. Every time they feel another character is fit to have frags, they will move the frags from another already existing character.
---
I completely agree, I’ve played like 5-10 times
---
And I’m enjoying so much the map is awesome the guns are fun to use, the whole thing is great
---
Awww you looked through my profile to think of a comeback. Thats so cute
---
Sure it was. People like you are the reason this world is the way it is. Ugh /s

One word ...... how

Stahp!
---
are the challenges even out yet?
---
And I’m not “allowed” back in
---
I do however find myself playing a lot of recruit in casual now because he isnt in ranked. SAS on defense (mp5/smg11) and GSG 9 on attack (commando 556)
---
Recruit is **QUIRKLESS**
---
Ubi is a company. A company's goal is to generate revenue. That's basic economics. It doesn't matter how much they have, their goal is to make money.
---
She would be way to versatile with them. She has a good gadget, 3 good guns, and 3 speed. Frags would push her over the edge and make her a great pick literally always.

Its a cool concept to have a map outside

List do the overwatch way and add an arcade mode that changes weekly

Fun, but I wish it was TDM and you could respawn. I think that would make theses events a little less sweaty and more fun IMO.
---
Why does smoke have a upside foot as a hand
---
What chapel
---
Sigh. Ubisoft went VERY VERY wrong somewhere. I mena just why? It started with ridiculous skins and now it goes on with ridiculously and completely unfittingly themed events? They act like it's Overwatch... but in Rainbow Six I want them to be... less over the top. I mean seriously... a Cowboy Event?
---
While i agree 3 frags out of 24 ops is really low
---
It's incredible luck.
---
Chapel?
---
Was it ranked
---
Bait? If so u got me

Is it gonna have the glass slits in it?

New showdown gamemode
---
 
---
For everyone asking questions about map/ guns/ gamemode, this is the new event. [Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuvhoniB8l4)
---
3v3, 1:30 timer, no special gadgets, no drones, no prep phase.
---
You spawn on opposite sides of the map. It's very comparable to COD Search and Destroy.
---
Are your seriously been a scumbag about a dead guy he was classified as one of the best that’s what was said

This why it needs to be server side

oh that's really cool

yep

Thank you! I honestly didn't think anyone else had noticed, especially if you only want one thing but have to pay rw money for a gamble at getting what you want, its bs
---
I appreciate the new content. I’m not crazy about the game mode or the skins but I generally don’t care for cosmetics. It’s still not the most generous method they are going with. You know well that people obsess over cosmetics, especially LIMITED TIME cosmetics. (that’s a sales trick itself) Getting 2  new random items is great. If you want something specific you’ll gambling for it or playing inhuman amount of hours.
---
This. I got stuck in copper because of throwers and boosters/smurfs

Recruit Moment
---
Event was pre planned months in advance. Shields were one of the defender gadgets that were selected. Probably cant activate them in the event playlist without making them available in ranked and casual.
---
well I mean, what defines anything nowadays? It's only been how many years since becoming a weaponized battle toaster became a gender.
---
nice
---
i found some others too. I got it in a reddit post of mine.
---
Win 10 showdown Matches
---
It’s showdown, pretty sure it just came out
---
Hmm, i fail to see that. It’s not strategy if the same ops get banned on different maps. It’s just a waste of time in my opinion, it delays the match and takes the fun away... either just remove those ops that get banned 80% of the time or don’t do it at all.... i guess that’s just my take
---
I saw this happen also, I was like what the...
---
I didn't say they are new . 
---
And I am hearing about 2-3 weeks now that clash is in TTS . How long do they need ? One more month ? They introduced her again with the new season and almost in hours they took her back again
---
Where is it exactly?
---
I'm bitching because I'm borderline OK with paying, I think an entire fucking $30, last time I checked, but now if I spend that, like triple the cost of the actual game, I'm not even guaranteed anything, it is bullshit.
---
Oh my god

Yes, I am on PC. I'm pretty new to reddit, how would I dm you?

Correct. I took a break and im trying to get better

Don’t spend money then. They can choose to price things however they please. It’s your choice if you buy it or not. I personally don’t spend a dime.

---
Tachanka
---
Durning the Calgary stampede?! Thank you Ubisoft very cool.
---
She hit TTS last week.
---
And blame no life exploiters that look at every known summon of cthulhu to find a way to break the game in their favour, this is also why it went to TTS this time as it means players can probably find any remaining issue that couldn't be found in live testing.

Its in the mine. You have to break a certain wall with the letters on it
---
Buying items directly is all I ask for. They’d probably make more money because most people refuse to spend money on a gamble and definitely not forking outcthe dough to buy everything.
---
Oh thanks I haven't been on r6 today
---
I mean it says end by a gentlemen...
---
All you have to do is reboot your game
---
*laughs in shipyard*
---
bRuH
---
&gt;don’t roam   
---
Do you understand how important roaming is to a Defense? I don’t you’re gonna hit diamond playing 5 guys on site...
---
Credits only. One pack for free by logging in, one via Ubisoft club.
---
I was thinking of something like that but with more players
---
I'm not sure about earning them or buying them, but  you can view that challenges in the ubisoft club app. Open the app, click games and select r6 and go to weekly challenges, they should be there.
---
The shield is literally reactivated
---
When did I mention anything about him being toxic?
---
No he’s still alive it’s just a joke
---
_I‘m uncomfortable_
---
Get these shitty ass loot boxes out this game it's already stuffed with micro-transactions
---
Really? I havent checked. This is like the second time it happens
---
Just played. Can confirm. Shield back
---
Nah, it was a glitch.
---
The only issue with that I think would be outside of bank, fortress, Hereford, outback most maps might not be large enough once the map gets destroyed. Who knows though.
---
Its the western event
---
*asterisks you say*?
---
Can we get de calling cards?
---
I aint too fused its boring anyway just want packs
---
Maybe you just can’t play with guns that have low ammo but big punches.
---
Same I cant buy r6 credits for 3 months since rainbow is magic event every time  I sent a ticket they say " We are aware of the issue preventing you from accessing the store tabs and are investigating it"
---
kind of useless.
---
whoa it's almost like this game already has multiple avenues of monetization
---
Clash is almost useless anyway
---
Why are there no shields in the new event?
---
It’s still in situations
---
Well there’s a lot of issues with your comment.
---
1) This isn’t ranked its casual you can clearly see the Favela map name
---
2) Most pros do care about ranked as it’s great practice (obviously not as good as level 10 FaceIts) but pros still care about reaching diamond and performing well
---
3) Where did you get the statistic that 90% don’t care about ranked? Or did you just make that up?
---
But you're forgetting D A T A  L I M I T S
---
That's what I'm saying. The mask, the weird arm thing the gat - it's just Twitch but again.
---
Why the friendly fire tho?
---
God damnit what have I done.
---
 Nah, we need frag grenade skins
---
this nibba jelly of your flix
---
I'm sorry but that battle pass in Fortnite is one of the best ways to accrue currency in that game plus it pays itself off plus some
---
It’s not a scam oh my god. I’m sick of people saying paid cosmetics are a scam, it’s ONLY COSMETIC! If you want it, pay up, otherwise you don’t get it. Nothing scammy about that. Although I’d agree that the loot box system is pretty annoying. But you still easily have the option to just not get any.
---
Oh cool, thanks for letting me know! Have any idea of there will be any other challenges?
---
how bout the end screen posts? i think those are worse, right now.. lol
---
What happened if you won? He survives?
---
Smoke i dont know why
---
My chance is at [0.70%](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539808777780723722/595688159275384853/unknown.png)
---
Ah yeah I forgot about those lil icons.
---
Still, I feel like they would specify in the ‘collection’ part of the pack menu, if the player cards were included. Seems like too much of a selling part to not include in the description.
---
I’ve done some thinking and (not that you care) £79.99 which is the only option if you have near to no credits, is kind of ridiculous for what you get. At least make it 50 or 60 pounds ffs ubi. 
---
Gambling and not getting what I want is too much of a risk without going all in.
---
Sorry for the waffle this is last part is mainly internal monologue.
---
Really? I’m bored of it already. Too vanilla.
---
And fuck those skin prices
---
I’m away from home and I can only play this on a slow non-gaming laptop can I get an F.
---
I saw Ash run into the church with a cooked grenade and take out people just as the round started.
---
I’ve had this issue loads.
---
New revolver extended mag looking good
---
Fun fact: I was able to get recruit by joining the game as/after the pick phase timer ran out.
---
I haven’t hoped on Siege yet, how many packs are there this time?
---
Nice try siege but I'll stick with this new apex update.
---
At least, make them available for purchase after a year or something.
---
Just completed the challenge and didn't get a second pack? :(
---
Have you tried blowing into the cartridge?
---
Sites outdated engine already has enough the handle with bullet physics, destrution, improved lighting, etc... rendering a whole character model, let alone 3, is pushing it. It's easier to make an asset with fewer polygons and less taxing on the game. Plus who knows what kind of exploits would start showing up if Alibi worked that way. If you want to play mind games, go ahead! I started using them as peek bait to flank with her shotgun
---
Clash isn’t available in this gamemode and it would make the most sense that this is referencing only operators in this mode.
---
31, all of the skins are amazing in my opinion
---
eh, good warm up
---
I’ve been playing for almost 3 years and never heard of it
---
There are
---
Where?
---
Playing house 1v1 for 2 days really taught you good
---
Nah, we need bullet skin
---
No. I don’t think i will.
---
Goddamnit I want everything for Maverick
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Because I’m joking.
---
oh
---
Honestly it’s insane how good it is.
---
Yeah, he gets a ride in a helicopter and recovers. I’ll see if I can find a clip
---
It's odd because Division 2 does exactly this. Either grind out the keys or buy the keys during the event. Once the event is over the event items are then moved to the regular loot pool in the normal apparel caches so you can still earn them after the event.
---
And Division 2 gives more free content than Siege does, yet their monetization is very tame.
---
honestly the thing i love the most is that there is only one charm
---
Er is not actually the same than before with only banning chars?
---
Restart the game
---
100% agree with you! I would fork out money for the Twitch headgear and uniform if I could just buy them instead of gamble. I definitely think it would bring Ubisoft more money to do it that way.
---
I'd be fine with paying money for it. But im not paying ubi a cent for a chance to get a cosmetic.  Either let me choose or earn it for free in game.
---
Get this suprise mechanic shit out of here.
---
Okay this is super confusing with the skull because it’s a parasite that would take over a human body. If it died and decomposed it would just be the human skull left.
---
Well, Cav is the only woman in the game that doesnt rely on technology to get by, I can see the old guy liking her for that.
---
I’m in America and it for some reason keeps connecting me to your servers
---
That was fucking epic! Well done!
---
They gave rook the worst skin possible
---
The gamemode is around for two weeks so I'd guess there'll be a challenge or two in the first week and another/more in the second
---
Just in this mode
---
In the time it took you to grab your phone, open camera, hold it up to your screen, check the sections where the pack should be, open reddit, upload the video, make a title, post it, wait for a response - you could have restarted your game within 60 seconds, open your pack and continue playing... but you didn't.
---
Hey the US west servers for showdown are broken currently
---
I miss it):
---
"Trebek, are you selling Penis Mightiers?!"
---
It’s a fantastic mode and theme and I want it fleshed out as a permanent game mode.
---
Account hackers: “nows my chance!”

Yea.

---
Matchmaking seems to of broken on xbox. I just got the sheriff's hat and trying to unlock him.
---
You diabolical bastard
---
I'm not even mad, dumb shit like that just makes times events like these even more fun and memorable
---
😂 Nah, The hitbox detection is a joke
---
Even if there is no evidence, Ubisoft does not care. I can give you a driver which has nothing to with cheating. If you load this driver while BattlEye is loaded, you will get banned and Ubisoft won't revert your ban no matter what.
---
I only have an HDD.

Here is the *official* blog post from when they undid the change your outdated article is referencing:

---
I got into a game sometimes but mostly it does kicks you out of queue or sends you to end of the game.
---
I won’t get back home till the 18th :(
---
I..........agree
---
Some people just enjoy an operator who doesn't have to be all business. He has MP7 with iron sight which is an amazing gun without a sight.
---
Of course as soon as I go away you have this event. #ThanksUbi
---
More than you I reckon, I don't spend my life going round begging game companies for free skins
---
Yup, montagne is insane with a coordinated team
---
Ah check it out its pretty good
---
only at oregon
---
Melee?
---
Can’t you just straight up by them in overwatch though?
---
Yeaaaah......
---
Just have some damn FAITH Ash!!
---
He tried to curve the bullet a little too hard
---
didn't know.  When i bought the base game in 2015, all there was were the base operators, and they cost 200, 500, 1000, 2000, on a scale for each faction.
---
Can’t wait for them to be gone in 3 days

Hello amarthehummer2, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c8eejg/showdown_modes_matchmaking_is_broken/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
garbo casual console player
---
It should be there now.
---
Ubisoft can't do anything, the servers aren't theirs
---
Yeah man. rip in peace
---
Haha you serious? Have you been around while the castle glitch was a thing? I think it was the whole season of Para bellum where you couldn't play one game without the most game breaking bug in siege history. It took them far more time than one week. So we should be glad, we got those temp character bans.
---
wish i had friends like you  :)
---
same its happening to me too
---
It’s coming this season, no confirmed date though
---
Stop spreading fake rumors
---
Lmao I where did I say I want them for free? You're ignoring the topic just to shit on people who arent on board with the gambling system.
---
To melee it... Much easier than shooting from the side..
---
The only skin I bought with renown was for lion to get rid of the banana suit.
---
Looks pretty redundant if you ask me.
---
Idk, sometimes I feel like MMR should be based on people's performance as well as which team wins or loses.
---
Now makes sense, but still, I disagree about putting him in ranked
---
Jesus Christ, would you have some FUCKING TASTE? ANY OTHER FUCKING SONG WOULD'VE BEEN AMAZING! bUT YOU CHOSE THIS! JESUS FUCK GET THIS SHIT AWAY FROM ME
---
It’s high noon 12:00 bell
---
This is by far the most fun i've had in any official matchmaking gamemode in a long, long time.
---
I gotta disagree, as a kapkan main that uses the same kit as tachanka, that SMG is like a damn laser,  its won me countless fights
---
No, the changed cards are only within the event playlist
---
Yes and im lovin it
---
But do they also issue you an EE-ONE-D 🤔
---
Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuw
---
There was no reason to take him out. It was like a fix to a problem that did not exist.
---
Didn't know that. Thanks.
---
You know that when they add something like that the invisibility glitch is going to come back
---
It wouldn’t let me use them
---
Some people like to melee it. The grass is deceptive!
---
Next step is unlock the R6 credits for some regions.
---
Anytime
---
It’s 60$ actually and I think once a year that’s fine
---
agreed
---
They may well end up extending it like they've done in the past
---
you don't have to buy it
---
Big boy edits just getting more epic
---
Jup
---
It wouldn’t let me use them and I had the update
---
I'm proud to be most of the sounds in the music
---
I don’t bother, ppl are usually annoying
---
Oh, so I don’t need a SSD and a HDD?
---
That would be nice.
---
But, I don't see it happening.
---
Otherwise the people who spent a fortune to spin the wheel 50 times just to get that one item they actually wanted would be burned.
---
Nooooooooo, she is my worst enemy
---
Wayyy better than the magic event
---
No it’s because she’s a cancer concept, it’s bad for the game, like black beard, yeah he can be countered many ways, but he’s aids
---
Thats another thing but i feel like some times you help in a way that the game cant track like doing good callouts or smoking a room for the player with defuser
---
So outbreaks have been happening since cowboy times, then how in the present, the millitary didn't had a clue what was going on? I would understand if it was a gouvernement secret but if it was, the gouvernement  indhered the military operations to eradicate the outbreak wich would of destroyed the world, just to keep a secre(it may mean that there is something more to the outbreaks then zombies cause if there weren't ,why indhering the eradication of the outbreak and why isn't comon knowledge in the world of r6. so in my theory there is something more to what we thought was just a zombie outbreak) (and also since it's a crusher skulls it also mean that the virus developed to the same state as we saw in the first outbreak and that might tell is that it isn't a virus cause it would of evolved. so it might spiritual,alien mumbo jumbo that isn't a living thing cause if yes, it would of evolved but the skull is praticly he same from the first outbreak.)
---
For attack, I would choose Buck, as he is almost the same as Sledge, but slightly better. Hibana is a  good pick, but a player with more experience can use her better. For defense, Doc and Rook are my go-to beginner operators, but if you already have those, maybe Bandit, Lesion, or even Frost.
---
No just this seasons operators
---
Each season is individual and has 8 operators each
---
If you would be willing I would be really appreciative 🤗
---
It’s underneath the normal challenges.
---
Where are the three dots and where's the homepage?
---
Is it me or is the brightness or gamma seem messed up?
---
Hi, any idea about the locked R6 credits and store for certain regions? It's been like 6 months since they've been locked.
---
Agreed
---
idk I guess its just up to player, if they like it or if they don't
---
amazingg
---
The good thing about that strategy is players learned the strategic value of artillery bombardment
---
I’m on vacation. Again, thank you
---
I am 100% convinced that's what they wanted to do, but they couldn't program it or figure out how to make it work.
---
So they put it out as a balance feature instead.
---
Yeah same me and my mates jumped straight into ranked and lost a round due to it and ended up losing by one round in the end
---
Just restart your game / uplay.
---
Same here can't play Showdown or casual even. It just brings me back to the main menu
---
Server is messed up right now.
---
Or hereford
---
Yeah
---
Kaids hat and capitaos uniform. Wish I had kaid unlocked now
---
Yes is there is a reason like you missed your 2 shots but if they just act like they dont know what the bosg is they shall be more then just crucified
---
Awesome! Thank you
---
you cant enter casual either?
---
Yeah same for me and my friends everyone of us aren’t getting anything
---
Finger guns are the deadliest
---
Underrated comment, I heard the whole theme play in my head
---
Thanks, it did. Probably should have thought of that earlier
---
Same came to reddit just to check it out, nothing is working not even casual.
---
The sad part is that ubi spends most of it's time making skins (rather than improving the game. Even if they did indeed fix the shields and clash) so they won't give them for free.
---
Once
---
They already said they wouldn’t do this. 
---
Use search bar before you post.
---
I got 2 weapons skins...
---
Rip.
---
Same issue here
---
I need cosplay photos!!!
---
*200 IQ'S*
---
Because stock bosg is garbage.
---
2 shots.
---
big iron sight.
---
plus the inconsistency.
---
I’m getting that on pc
---
Thank god for pick &amp; ban
---
I got into one match after trying for about an hour.
---
No but people complain like Ubisoft can fix it in a instance . It’s like beating a already dead dog. I’m pretty sure Ubisoft doesn’t need another edit post to conclude they need to start worker on server protection along with the hundred of thousands already complaining about it .
---
It's got to be like 10% of the worlds population that can pull off the moustache look.  You're up there with Mr. Selleck my friend.
---
If you want to learn to play with a super high sense, don’t work your way to it.  What I did was maxed it and just played a booty ton of cas till I felt comfortable enough for ranked.
---
I can't even fucking play it. Everytime a join a game it kicks me out.
---
I got the charm from my free pack. Anything else is a win at this point.
---
No neither casual or the new event were working last I tried. Hope they release a fix soon.
---
I was going to say. But then again that would explain his Halloween head gear.
---
The map is named Fort Truth, theres a mine called Consequences.  
---
(Outbreak took place in , City of  Truth and Consequences) or something like that

---
Showdown: Get added into a game, black screen, can chat with others but that's it. Can't even exit unless using Alt+F4
---
Wait till I get done with this match
---
I love the revolver in the normal game but it feels cheap in showdown
---
Rooks headgear looks like it should be part of the Halloween event

How is it garbage its litterly a beam machine iron sights arent that big either

You wanna know why it's garbage?
---
Ok.
---
You shoot a one armour dude at mid range and they only lose half the health but you get shot as a 3 armour at the same range and get downed,while having full health.
---
Shotguns are inconsistent
---
U could buy pack after pack and see how many it takes to get what u want (I know higher amounts of credits are cheaper but that’s what I’ve done with the SI packs and got the universal skin after 2 packs I bought)
---
yea ok its giving me the same thing for casual matches as well, like the few times its put me in a showdown game, its already ended and im at the stats screens, like wtf
---
It doesn’t matter everyone has the same loadout. I don’t even get why we are wasting time in such a quick game mode picking OPs, just let it be random and go shoot each other
---
❤️️
---
Lol, or you could get better at the game. There’s a reason the Broken/OP ops get banned
---
"cringe"
---
Does anyone know if rank is working? been playing it but games arent counting up
---
Haha, were people actually saying this to other people? The one season I sit out and one of my main gets a solid limited time outfit!
---
I just restarted my pc I’ll let you know what happens
---
But wait, you CANT!

Unless you were being literal and mean work harder irl in order to afford the 60 dollar price tag

I cross map 3 armours with 1 shot idk if its just a console thing tho
---
Ubi
---
Game be broken
---
From what I've seen this post has 2 responses, either someone saying "Yeah lol" or people getting up in arms about how I'm a dumbass who doesn't know how to play Alibi.  I want to address the latter since damn are you all a rude bunch.
---
1. I don't play Alibi competitively, or most operators for that matter.  Primarily because I find that Siege is best when the people you're playing with can have fun and fun tends to diminish when people get all serious.
---
2. While I'm not a serious player, I do know that Hall of Mirrors is a dumb strategy.  Of course it is.  But that's what makes it work every now and then.  "Nobody would do that, let me shoot this hologram" and then BLAM.  Of course, this does not dismiss the fact that the strategy is dumb and often doesn't work.
---
3. I fully believe that of you equip cosmetics with Alibi, one way or another, you are at a disadvantage. The fix is simple, just make the holograms reflect the player model, but until Ubi does anything, if you equip cosmetics you are playing at a disadvantage.  Because doubt is a powerful force.  Anything you can do to increase someone's doubt in what they're doing will make them play worse.  And having a distinguishing cosmetic eases all doubts about Alibi's holograms.  Sure, they have other more effective uses, but it doesn't dismiss the fact that they are worse when they don't match your actual model.
---
Ok. I restarted the game already, but nothing happens, just lyk
---
What's that from
---
Ubi can't even release a two week event without fucking the game
---
This event is what happened during the black water job
---
I sent it
---
Also In the Division 2 you can find his name on the side of the A-10 in the air and space museum, for my D2 players out there
---
Lol you really think this event is specifically for ddosing protection ? No, but I’m pretty sure some of the mula generated from these for sure go towards it
---
Can’t help that pardna
---
What event?
---
Why have you posted this three times?
---
The new event
---
Agreed! It’s either they kick you or team kill you
---
You play on console yourself....
---
shotguns are just shit in the game and inconsistent.
---
Plus then you have all those m&amp;k plats being sweaty with the revolver. So bosg is even more useless
---
Ranked is often less toxic than casual
---
First thing I did too. OP OMALA!
---
smoke costum animal
---
Its just annoying at this point
---
oh god she's even hotter with the hat
---
MW1 and MW2
---
I want this so bad
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure it's that
---
Yup
---
Assuming you got the free one, is there one for completing the challenges? 
---
If you finished the challenge and it did not drop, email Ubisoft support and they will get it to you.
---
thats not ps4 or xbox controler and I dont think hes plaing on pc...
---
Holy hand grenade
---
To the place I belong....
---
NO! You are breathtaking!
---
Also in tight spots by putting shields like stairs
---
haha sorry mate lol
---
Yes and there is a challenge for another
---
From now on I’m just gonna call warden Ron Swanson

Why though? It's a beast with or without 1x.

Ill certainly pick mozzi up for defense, but is lion good for a newer player? He seems to have good weapons and i reall love the playstyle of knowing where my enemy is before they do. I havent found success with twitch because i cant use her drones to their potential and they seem quite lackluster to me.
---
No, people want ubisoft to make the holos match Alibi's outfit
---
He posts lots of cool stuff on TikTok so unless you hate that app. I'd have a look if I were you
---
yup, name checks out

I laughed so fucking hysterically
---
No, that is the mobile one.

You got 5 players

So bad luck trying to play dis
---
Nope.

That is some hard work

So many times I see people shutting on “Console” accuracy. Love to seem them try it.
---
It’s like this exact image was around 6hr+ ago...
---
I didn’t ask you to credit him, all I did was credit him my self
---
Yeah, he is the "southern gentleman". In his bio, in the paragraph starting with "he knows how to manipulate..." it says that warden plays the "southern gentleman around women"

Do we have to spend money to get a cowboy skin? I fucking love anything western themed but Im afraid Im gonna have to spend $20 to look like a cowboy.
---
Every new event you guys extract the file 
---
Fucking nice
---
Sometimes it be ya own.
---
No division 2 you idiot
---
It does have skins tho
---
Too bad you used Fortnite, now all of that impressive editing is worthless to 90% of the people here.
---
I agree
---
I don't know what you consider high ranked, but I see her getting banned quite a lot (every 2-3 games) around plat II.
---
Fuck that’s a nice mustache. Props
---
and noobs still use a skin on that op
---
C-Clash... BBBack? No-No this can't be!
---
She insists
---
I was just thinking earlier after I got my pack and saw a 1% chance that someone was gonna get a 1 roll from this event lmao
---

---
Your welcome brah
---
Laggy bullshit mode. And a nice gamecrasher. thx 4 nothing
---
Why would you reply just to tell him to look at the other reply?
---
I know right 😅
---
&gt; 1.	⁠I don't play Alibi competitively, or most operators for that matter
---
So you’re acting like you know how an operator should be played and buffed because? 
---
&gt; fun tends to diminish when people get all serious.
---
Ok, but that doesn’t change the fact that lots of people do take it seriously. 
---
&gt; 3.	⁠I fully believe that of you equip cosmetics with Alibi, one way or another, you are at a disadvantage.
---
This only matters if you’re actively trying to trick people. Most good Alibi players don’t do that. The model matching doesn’t matter. 
---
Her Prismas are there to deny sightlines. Windows, doorways, a flank. The pinging and identification is there to actually make them a deterrence. Matching the actual alibi doesn’t play into that. 
---
And even then, you’ll still be able to catch players that are hasty and don’t look before shooting. 
---
 Even without the uniforms, you still have to actively go out of your way to imitate the prismas. No one who’s good at this game is going to hold an angle by standing straight up and not ADS. The holograms themselves don’t mimic you that well. Maybe from afar, but that’s about it. 
---
Even if you are trying to trick people, it’s entirely dependent on the other team relaying that information and remembering it. Operator uniforms are a pretty rare call out, because they’re generally inconsequential, outside like Wind Bastion suits.
---
Soo, wanna talk about the non-drawing-person in the foreground never having a pistol? That seems quite odd in a duel if I were to be quite honest
---
That wasn’t the hostage 
---
That was fuze that was hidden as the hostage and the hostage was in a fuze outfit
---
Probably their real names
---

Yes... wars have been fought with sharp sticks, my dude.
---
Drone skins are a terrible idea for comp play
---
Exactly me but I die in 0.5sec upon contacting the opfor and at 20 frames/sec
