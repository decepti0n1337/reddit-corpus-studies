Why does this look like she's about to make a Hitler speech (it's a joke fuck off with your criticism)

All these S.I. backgrounds show the ops in their Default uniform.

Peeker's advantage exists, and its exactly equal to the ping of the person you are peeking. So if you peek someone with 30ms ping, you get 30 milliseconds of reaction advantage over them. It also means that if you have 300 ping and someone peeks you, they have 300 milliseconds of reaction advantage over you, which is a fight you cannot win. If you have high ping, you have to play aggressively otherwise you will lose almost ever engagement.
---
Because we can only have two stickies at a time and there's more important stuff to pin. I wouldn't mind having 10 pins right now actually.
---
Caveira dominatss at low ranks since most people there don't use their drones. At higher ranks, people WILL use their drones because they know it's power. Vigil basically counters this, because you may know where he is, but you don't know exactly. 
---
why is the /s there?

Can you not buy them individually? 
---
Yup, i think it's 600 if I remember 
---
sorry what does VTK mean? 
---
Yeah I kinda like the simplicity of it sometimes it just goes overboard with all the traps and counters it could be a good change of pace
---
I think the characters look just fine. I like Mozzie's helmet. I hope he's a 3 speed so I can play as him 
---
45 mil registered not active.  Still good sales for a 3+ year old game. Im proud how far we've come, it has to be an anomaly in software development.

The 21:9 version is cropped from the 16:9 version. In the 16:9 version the top of Kaid's hat is visible. It is cropping the top and bottom of the image to fit your 21:6 display.
---
Yeah. Its a great concept but with too many ppl
---
nah its good, ever since Apex came out i've won a LOT of games and i even got to plat (solo queued)

I know its great but its too many ppl for me

Knowing roughly where is enough for some Ops like Fuze, Lion will dig him out and so will Dokkaebi, it‚Äôs not enough imo to give Vigil viability but I do see what you mean at higher level play, perhaps he needs a buff not a rework
---
Happy microphone day!
---
A clan of 15/16 year olds were giving me shit the entire ranked match. I'd been doing pretty well, despite their best efforts to fuck me off. 
---
Match Point, all but one of them dies. I pull out an Ace and they start showing me some goddam respect.
---
Me and the last of the little fucks went to the defuser, he started defusing while I cooked a frag. I calmly say never to fuck with a random again.

*apex legends lol
---
lets add zombies next
---
I prefer the M249 due to its recoil pattern, in my experience it's usually better at long-mid range. Mostly just personal preference though.
---
Fuze and Lion are only 2 ops out of the 22. There is a higher probablity of the tram consisting of other ops than Fuze, Lion and other sets. Yes, you can find him with Dokkaebi, but only if you sound whore the fuck out of the room.

this pic is when the event started early friday morning, and the tickets are for passes for the whole weekend.  The VIP tickets, which seem somewhat empty there, most of those guys aren't there yet, and will be there for the weekend.  Also the content creators that'll be there watching, aren't doing their bits until the weekend as well.

If you have an Ethernet core try that. I am in no means an expert but I think your download upload speed is slow which leads to packet loss which makes you rubber band so I would suggest going on a Speedtest and telling me what your upload and download is. 
---
what editing software do you use? This looks amazing.
---
Fortnite still beats apex imo. Siege still my fav game tho
---
Are there FHD resolutions of them? I need these for my desktop wallpaper!

probably lol but they are actually hand warmers

Is that, ACOG ON ASH???

now that right there is some serious heresy

Oh no, you have to scroll a bit more, the travesty!

Exactly. I didn't even bother contacting support because I knew they was gonna inform me with bs. I just want to help everybody that have the same problem as me

I love this editing style so much.

Was really waiting to get Ela but something about her looks off?
---
Also what decides who gets the gold?
---
Thats true, plenty to be learned from watching the pros. Just not sure how an obsession over esports became a thing.
---
And using Twitch as a metric of success 
---
Idk why they complain when you don't even use a boomerang as the Australians. Like wtf ubi? Since when do Australians use guns?
---
Hi
---
I dont know but that game was fire
---
IRC, The Operatives that join Team Rainbow are the best of the best in their respective Unit, Joining Team Rainbow Allows them to be more lenient with their uniform, While still be distanced enough to represent their country
---
You're usually gonna get a bunch of empty seats early on in such events. A lot of people go to these for sight seeing on top of the event, so they use the early stages to do that. Probably won't see nearly as many empty seats come grand finals. 
---
Well I can certainly see your point but theres time constraints and fatigue to consider.
---
Also I personally think that single elimination adds a bit more of a thrill to it all.  Sport is about underdogs.  
---
Look at the football world cup last year.  Should Croatia have been in a final over Belgium. Absolutely not, but there they were.  It gives people a chance to see the sensational happen.
---
Double elimination just seems like a distillation experiment rather than an epic journey of unpredictability.
---
Agree to disagree.
---
He does not
---
Her hit box isn't broken, that was fixed a long time ago lol
---
And that's fine. The original comment was complaining about having to see Fortnite streams everywhere. Don't like it, just scroll on by.
---
But also just saying boring... uh... okay. Is it boring because you dislike how long the matches can be? How you can rarely see anyone all game and then die quickly, making all the looting pointless? Is it boring to watch? Is it boring because you don't have a squad of friends willing to play? Is it boring because you're not that good so you die quickly in any fight, no matter how early or late it is in the fight? These would be descriptive reasons. Some are personal experience and others are definitely facets of the game.
---
Take Siege for example. If you chose to just solo queue casual and never do anything else you'd get pretty damn bored of the game. But that's a boredom because of personal experience. But if you play ranked with a squad and get bored, you're at least experiencing the game how it's meant to be played.
---
That sounds like a pain, sorry to hear that
---
Time... Time, Time and Time. Find more sponsors so we there are money for it and then i'm on. But as stated many gigantic sports events do it this way with the quarter finals and forward. There has already been an extensive qualification and group plays beforehand, and with the extremly competetive nature of siege the last 4 teams all should have a chance at beating each other.
---
yeah, try it on snowmobile garage on Chalet. thatcher it, fire an airjab, &amp; let thermite do his thing
---
Who is he? 
---
Lmaoo
---
Ela has a helmet legendary headgear and with that it looks pretty similair
---
Twitch definitely can be useful but it‚Äôs incredibly deceiving. Also, why would an obsession over esports be odd? People turn anything into a competition. Professional eating for example. Or just sports. Why are people obsessed with sports (don‚Äôt get me wrong I love my College Football)? It‚Äôs because they want to see the best. Just like esports. 
---
They started to cross the line with some of the Skins though like Top Hat. And the Australian Operators in my opinion cross the line when it comes to  their standard skins.
---
Is that Gordon Ramsay?
---
Yeah. I saw someone in chat questioning it and I kinda felt the same, but it is still a fantastic gun 
---
"This does put a smile on my face"
---
I hit 1k hours on PC a couple of weeks ago; I can personally say I've seen more hackers in casual than in ranked.
---
Forgive him disciple of the Lord for he knows not where to cast his gaze...
---
Because he blinded himself.
---
The major downside is group continuously downing each other and throwing with no penalty. That said, they should be able to make so you cannot forgive people you are grouped with.
---
And now Mozzie lets you take control of attacker drones so...
---
Who‚Äôs to say pro league stuff can‚Äôt be posted here ?

Norick
---
Good irons, low recoil, high damage, extremely fast reload.
---
Siege is a cartoon now but it will sell more to the masses this way 
---
Half right. You need the Elite ticket for that.
---
I think it's march 11th. The playstation event told us when WB started and ended, so one can only assume it's when it ends.
---
They took away ash‚Äôs r4c acog for no reason, are needing blitz for no reason and nerfing maverick for no reason. Ubi is shit and for now, until something changes in management, nothing will change. I‚Äôm going to assume any and all game devs who look at the reddit page have had the ideas shut down long before put into testing, and have given up. I would also like to say that this would allow people who knew each other to teamkill each round with no negitive side effects. 
---
Hope he gonna take a fly back soon when he gonna get rekt from rec 
---
Obsession is not good in any manner.
---
No one has ever said "its good to be obsessed"
---
They normalize it as ok but thats for a lack of wanting to intervene or create problems.
---
Obsessive behavior has always been "not good"
---
Yet Monty wasn't banned.

Yeah. people like marley would probably constantly TK for memes, and then get no punishment, which might encourage people to be more toxic. But if they don't get the right to forgive their group members like you said, this crisis will be averted.
---
ADS, don‚Äôt have a capture card nor was I recording when it happened 
---
Me who has been playing since before there was dlc ops (black ice) think the game was generally more fun back in the old days. I feel the Community was less toxic by far. Back then you walk up to someone on the enemy team and start t bagging. You just made a new friend. People didn't try as hard back then either 
---
Codename kids next-door, is that you?

That stuff happens all the time, I've seen people lag thru walls

You‚Äôve been gnomed!

Blyat
---
So make him overpowered?
---
You have to attend the invitational and u get a code when u do
---
You might not be able to, but I‚Äôm sorry the vast majority of people will. Especially if you have a high refresh rate monitor. Which I can guarantee that people in the higher ranks on pc will have. And the vast majority of console players won‚Äôt. Most play through their tv. No console player can beat a pc player playing at 144-240 FPS with a 144-240hz monitor. This game is simply not that kinda game you can do have pc vs console players and have it be fun and balanced. The advantage of frame rate and higher refresh rate monitors is not PCMR bs. It‚Äôs a scientific fact
---
Want to test it, play one round or game a 60 then do another and drop to 30. You‚Äôll play worse and get owned. Then imagine a console player coming up against somebody with a setup like mine or better. 180-240 FPS pc and 240hz monitor. I see you before you see me, I can respond quicker than you can, and my response is sent faster thanks to lower input latency. Hell, console can‚Äôt even lean without ads‚Äôing to my knowledge. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the game files on console.
---
I‚Äôm not bashing on consoles. I have a PS4 and a PS4 pro and I‚Äôve been playing them since the ps2. Love them for what they are and offer. But they can‚Äôt compete with pc for performance, as they‚Äôre not designed to. Thusly a console player can‚Äôt compete with similarly ranked pc player.
---
I know this as I had to adjust coming from console. I was diamond on console for 1.5 years straight (I think) and that is about equivalent to high gold low plat on PC. 
---
that's crazy 
---
watching this made me think imagine if when in a downed stat you had the ability to use your sidearm 
---
Kewl
---
You should definitely give it a go if you havent, being able to ban ash has made it the least toxic few weekends of siege ive ever played
---
From the Y4S1 patch notes.
---
It‚Äôs a joke chill
---
Lol no i moved mouse across my whole desk
---
Early march
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Swapping operators without restarting a round probably isn't feasible from an engine point of view, though they could definitely make the process quicker
---
Just flash the shit out of them and hope theres no jager
---
thermite looks like gru
---
Why do people even care? It‚Äôs a fucking video game; people really will find any excuse to complain and hate, it‚Äôs embarrassing. 
---
Its amazing how a character with probably the least technologically advanced tool is one of my favorite to use and is considered one of the most bad-ass in siege's roster.  
---
You're way happier than he is!  At least you have a cool hoodie on.
---
Now I‚Äôm going to have to learn to git gud with G36C now that ACOG is about to begonith for the R4-C. Guess I‚Äôll have to be like you and get black ice for the G36C as well. Btw, Congrats on Black Ice!
---
Honestly yeah that‚Äôs a neat idea!
---
Frags &gt; claymore definitely
---
I don't think anyone was upset with the uniforms, most Australian's that I've spoken to so far (including myself) are more annoyed at all the inaccuracies in the map
---
That‚Äôs what I said...

No this is Patrick

I‚Äôm Sydney but we always called it Tip. Not even plural

The groan Kapkan made in the YT video was fcking hilarious

Im not seeing enough movement

Idk why but gridlock reminds me of Jesse Pinkman 
---
gotta go to r/rainbow6 hompage and look on the side for edit user flair
---
Fps drops in the game is pretty common even you got a decent rig
---
Thanks!  Glad you like them 
---
Damn why you guys gotta be dicks I was just explaining that I know how to code
---
Only xbox and pc. Ps wasn't agreeing until now
---
No, but if you‚Äôre bad at shooting guns and are a bit lazy then use echo. Capitao is good for flushing out enemies on site and good for rush planting, plus the Para .308 is really easy to control if you can shoot okay. Blackbeard is good if you hate getting one-tapped when peeking corners. Frost is good if you like trap operators, and if you‚Äôre cheeky about your placement you can do some real damage. Caveira is hard to get used to and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre just starting the game, but if you enjoy creeping around and spooking the enemies she‚Äôs great. Valkyrie is good if you‚Äôre okay with call outs and can give good info. Hibbana is basically ash mixed with thermite, but I can‚Äôt give a good review because I don‚Äôt have her. I hope that this info is useful and you‚Äôre satisfied with your choice.
---
It has an acog why not
---
Between echo and capitao, what would you pick? Can't choose between them. 
---
Ever since apex PogU
---
This is the reason people are starting to argue against 1 shot headshots not saying I agree but..
---
I thought I was smart baiting clash into a claymore
---
You can confirm that they were hackers? Pc is perfect idk what you‚Äôre on about.
---
Rip ash lol 
---
I played with Mozzie, and his gadget is like Kaid, in a way where there is an area of effect and if a drone goes in there it get hacked. Also one of his primary weapons is a Colt Commando 9mm.
---
That usually works for me. Sometimes I have to resort to a power bomb off the top ropes. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing r6 since release, and as soon as alpha packs came out my luck just shit itself. It‚Äôs all just luck for the alpha packs man
---
Nice! I love that I keep seeing these posts so I even have you an Australian upvote! :)
---
Sounds like someone went back on their own claim. And let me reply for you ‚Äúoooh man you just got pranked‚Äù

I still don't get how fortnite is this popular...
---
No. You can‚Äôt control how often you get something. I know it sucks but the same thing happened to me. I‚Äôve been playing for a year and have only gotten 6 legendarys. It‚Äôs just some people are lucky. 
---
Where's my drugs bandit!!!?

---
G2‚Äôs worst enemy possible
---
Gridlock has a net that stops or slows movement sorta like a traffic gridlock and Mozzie I've heard is slang for mosquitoes in Australia and he's rather twitchy and his gadget takes over drones which could be annoying and small like a mosquitoe. Once you understand the names they make sense for this season at least.
---
Israeli homeland security have a penchant for excessive force and violence that would make American cops blush
---
You said that there were hackers in a previous comment and what‚Äôs with the we‚Äôre? Are you being serious about how pc is perfect?

Yeah it's been pretty low, will ramp up with semi-finals and finals. But it's Canada in the heart of winter at the end of the day.

 I always feel the choice they made for this season Six Collection was meh, Cav and Vigil are both a fine choice and design. but I remember seeing a reddit post of someone making fanmade figurine for Mute and Mira. They looked great.  I was kinda hoping for the operators they would do for Season 3 were; Mira, Frost, Maybe Buck, Lesion, Echo, Doc, Thatcher or RECRUIT (Because WHY NOT!?) since there was more variety they could do. but Im just not feeling it with Twitch, Bandit and Ela Figurines.  I might call it a miss  for getting Season 3 figurines. Missed out of Season 1 (Although I plan to get Tachanka and Smoke since its the lord and Smoke looks decent), Fell in love with Season 2 (Got the collection), Might not get this set (But will get Cav and Vigil).   
---
If anyone can link the mute and Mira fan-made figurines that was posted on reddit a while ago, I would pay for that more than this set.
---
will it be like the year 2 bundle at 2400 credits or will it be like the pass where its 40 bucks

So long as your twitch account is connected to your ubi account it should be fine.

Honestly, yeah. All games are. Most, if not, all games go through this with the first moments when it‚Äôs released can be a blast and super fun to play, but people are always gonna find a way to hack a game and ruin it for others.

Ok thanks

Exactly why I don't watch invitationals until youtubers post them without this shit.

I just said they were rare. Yes pc is perfect and has no flaws nothing. Also pro pc tip flash your bios during an electrical storm to overclock the cpu.

Maestro is the strongest op, but if you don‚Äôt like his play style, Kaid next best. Finka and Alibi are also great. They will probably mention the Lion rework on Sunday, so you could wait hear if he sounds like he‚Äôll be good.

They are quite similar but at the same time slightly different, it's hard to put my finger on it

Y3S3.1 PATCH NOTES 09/17/2018 12:00 PM
---
[2018-09-17]Y3S3 The first patch after the season launches is generally a much lighter patch. As such, you will not see the same level of fixes as a Season launch. Patch Y3S3.1 deploys to PC on Tuesday, September 18th, and Console on Wednesday, September 19th. &lt;-AGES AGO
---
TEAM KILL BANS &lt;- Right here 
---
The team killing penalty for a first offense will be adjusted from a kick to a 30 minute ban. Initially, if a player was team killed in Casual, the offender was kicked from the match. The same situation in Ranked would result in a kick as well, but also triggered an abandon penalty. This was confusing because it seemed as if the team killing punishment was different between Ranked vs Casual.

Notice how the horizontal recoil and spread on the [556 xi](https://gyazo.com/1d800649dccccc6b3b57340dcabc0ca7) are worse than the [G36C](https://gyazo.com/24808ab0dc2d29509ecb157822cb8bb4) by a pretty clear margin.
---
Oh, and I can run reflex or acog on any weapon and do just fine. Holo sight is gross because it obscures too much of the screen, reflex all the way.

Hard to gauge how well you control recoil when all you use is crutch weapons like the R4C and FO12

it's back to the way it was before. which is buying every single operator with renown. first 5 of different ctu's is like 500 renown I think, in total those main 20 come out to I believe 20k renown which isn't a lot.

Comp is often better because it controls horizontal recoil better than flash hider, leaving the player to be concerned primarily with vertical recoil, which is much easier to compensate for. Flash hider only does a little of both, definitely not the "best of both worlds". This is why many pros use the 416 carbine without a grip at all.

Ok yeah fair enough. But there‚Äôs just a few things that players can change to seem less hostile . Also things like when someone kills you and there whole team of friends decides to kill you every round sort of needs to be solved. Something simple like a team (of friends like a party) can only kill one person once then anyone gets banned.

She is very good for rushing as well with breaching charge and a team full of 3 speeds you can easily take over the bomb with adrenaline charges

What cake day??? 
---
I agree but I‚Äôve been playing finka lately because she has frags and in my opinion best acog because of how little it takes up on the screen plus low recoil on her spear even when suppressed making her very lethal in combination with decent aim
---
Once you‚Äôve tasted heaven
---
Link?
---
Doesn't make sense though based on vigils ability and the nature of how the drone works. Vigil doesn't disappear he just removes his image from camera systems. Lions drone uses some form of sonar sound based detection system. 
---
She throws like a gurl 
---
Also why is it only for one operator per team? What happened to G2? 
---
Lmao no its not its the opposite im on ps4 evin i know that
---
Aussie here, it really do be like that sometimes
---
She‚Äôs wearing a man suit. 
---
Because it was out of the frame.
---
Why am i getting downvoted when its the truth??????????????????????? I thought reddit was better than this...

Yeah, i would say Finka got very different play style options, she is like a hybrid of some sort

Revolver is  infinitely more fun.

It peaked at 113k AFAIK. Beating DotA2 as well

Ok so this basically confirms that the biker, overly energetic guy is the defender named mozzie and the woman is the attacker named gridlock

Nice to have confirmation now

No it's a revolver

Crouch spamming...

  y
---
I don't really know where you found that, but as far as I know and as far as the internet can tell me, they're both fixed at their respective resolutions, they're not dynamic like BF1 or so.
---
Revolvers may be double action but that does not mean they aren‚Äôt semi auto, semi auto means you pull the trigger one bullet comes out, just like burst is usually 2-3 bullets per pull, and fully auto means it fires until you let go of the trigger
---
didnt crouchspam while shooting just holding the shield idk what you're on about
---
Ok
---
Valk, Hibana, Frost
---
Kinda hijacking this but. This game was honestly so much better before the addition of many new operators. Blackbeard, Lion, Dokkabi, Lesion, Echo, are legit cancer and are absolutely no fun to play against and has ruined a lot of the gameplay for me. Like honestly who the fuck came up the idea for lesion anyway. 
---
PS4 is by far the largest single community on Siege. 
---
Last estimates i saw put console combined as having over 70% of the playerbase. 
---
IIRC, PS4 has roughly twice as many users as XBox, which has just slightly less players than PC. 
---
After I heard about her nerf I started running the R4 with a holo. I love it 
---
Ah I can't even read
---
Instructions for setting up lg tv not clear enough got dick stuck in the fan
---
Yeah, i have that weird feeling that wit wont change much. I doubt that the pick-rate will change much for her and i doubt many people start using the g36c either. Its easier to just adapt to the new sight and play Ash more aggressive.

Hello Rendar1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ar8cnn/strange_r6_launching_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Some of these opponents of yours are proper braindead, goddamn.
---
Lovely edit.
---
If i remember the skin will come in season 2. Ubi said they are working on it.
---
Alibi, Kaid, or Gridlock when he comes out. Seems like you‚Äôre not missing that many operators on defense. If you like to roam Vigil is pretty good at roaming. Better than Cav now since she got nerfed into like a C tier operator. 
---
uhh
---
this why u stupid
---
Outside valk cams?
---
Run outs?
---
Stopping fuze?
---
If you hear someone rappel and want to prefire?
---
 You cant just make outside barricades invincible for defenders.
---
Mozzie is the name of the defender mate.
---
#*OPERATION HEALTH INTENSIFIES*
---
They look really nice, although I'd like it if they had a bit stronger expressions
---
Everyone says cav got nerfed into oblivion but she was intended as a stealthy charachter to sneak around and down people to interrogate them. Ubi made her too powerful and people just ran around downing people so now she has been nerfed so she is played as intended and not insta downing  rambo so people think the nerf is into oblivion.
---
A lot of the Y1s are good but its just down to playstyle and prefence
---
Ela evades paying taxes 
---
Well it depends, are you support (opens walls, gadget helps oithers; ie Thatcher,Thermite, Rook, Kapkan, Mute) or a fagger (aggressive, Ash, Jager, Blitz, etc)? If support, I'd say Frost or Valk for Defense or Hibana or Capitao for attack (but I'd say Hibana over Cap). Otherwise most of season 1 ops are more aggressive play type. If aggressive I'd say Buck.
---
Oh. They confused me with the names since no one knew was who for a while. Im still confused 
---
I like a bunch of Death metal and some thrash with a bit of black too

But he‚Äôs also the most underrated shield operator.   Also then Monty would be the only 3 Armor on attack, rip chunky attackers.
---
Holy shit that would be soooo fucking cool
---
&gt; Normally I don‚Äôt play rainbow six like that
---
You don't aim for the head?
---
Good to know thanks for catching me up and clearing my confusion 
---
Can someone tell me the name of the song thermite was playing on piano
---
Okay so basically this guy and 4 others on the enemy team were somehow picking recruit in S.I? 
---
Amazing
---
No problem my man.
---
How don't you realise that throw was ridiculous and the way it was before/is now is far better?
---
I like it lol 
---
I don't, I always miss but I let recoil do most of the work
---
Bandit looks more like Echo in this TBH
---
As a high Gold PC player, I believe it. See people do it all the time and it works for them just fine.
---
Did you ever figure out what server you were on. Tell me the three letter abbreviation and I can tell you what the region is and tell me if it matches up with you 
---
I can't aim on PC at all 
---
Its not better I can‚Äôt even reach the ceiling in chalet 
---
Complete edition
---
In all seriousness, is Ela any good?
---
Is it really worth? 
---

---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** maxcarty15! ^(hug)
---
God 
---
Hey brother you're not alone. I'm definitely not with you, but you can't possibly be alone!
---
I agree with u I think Fuze is underrated but can be very powerful if he's gonna be 2/2.
---
Nice weapon and stuff (smoke/breach charge) and his hability can be very good if use with brain 
---
Tommorow
---
yeah, but now imagine 40+ ops with a realistic design like doc and rook have. it would be very hard to recognise them.
---
*dances furiously in russian*
---
7 days before they originaly release them, the release date is unknow but will be announced tommorow at six invetational
---
thanks, so excited 
---
It kinda fits them because in the trailer it sounded like he is the young boy and she is his mom lol
---
Aaah the typical 13 year old 
---
thanks 
---
tuesday on test server ( pc )
---
march on all platform
---
K thanks I‚Äôm not new by the way just started new account on Xbox I play mostly on pc 
---
Yes, my sever is weu.
---
Sort of, her shotty is like kapkans (I think tachanka has it as well) but with more ammo and her smg has a high recoil, if you good at recoil, then yeah, she‚Äôs good
---
It was 10am on a workday when that picture was taken.
---
Your meme is cool and all but why did i use the same format but they deleted my post and repost  and also someone commented no memes on the sub   im annoyed by the owners
---
Im surprised no one pointed put the old Tom Clancy logo, guess a lot of people here didnt play the PS2 games.
---
You ever heard of suicide its real EZ
---
Win Bastion? More like Nerf Bastion? AMIRITE FELLOW 1337 GAMERZ?!?!?!?
---
It‚Äôs Anchor-MAN not Achor-Lady!
---
And that‚Äôs a scientific Fact
---
No don‚Äôt listen to this guy. They get officially ANNOUNCED tomorrow. Then we will get a release date
---
Well people hoped the same would be the case with Blackout. I certainly won't be burned again. PUBG is still the only choice if you care about realism
---
They both stupid thicc 
---
I have literally saw a meme with alnost the aame format andbit has 10k upvotes  can yu explain this ? 
---
Ela use a compensator for the scorpion 
---
IQ use a red dot and also a compensator for the commando 
---
You can buy them individually 
---
oh rip 
---
Thanks looks awesome
---
I thinks it‚Äôs when new people play and either have no ops or their only ones get banned they‚Äôre given recruit
---
How?
---
A trench teacher*
---
Jackitao
---
The fastest hand in the west
---
wow this is epic
---
I thought gridlock was the helmet guy and mozzie was the other one
---
Right now, you can only get the year three operators through renown, r6 credits, and through the ultimate edition. The Year 3 Operator Pack, which is what I assume you want, will come out either tomorrow with the Invitational Finals, or around March, when the new season starts.
---
They will announce new prices for the operators this sunday, stay tuned.
---
Bandit needs more drugs
---
And also they said to watch the invitational because that is when the new information will be coming out.
---
Real question will a hammer protected the hacked drone from be rehacked by Dokkaebu
---
He isn't getting needed at the start of next season unfortunately
---
buck has a pet moose
---
Problem with her recoil isn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt really in a set pattern. It basically jumps from left to right and up to down when you shoot, making it nearly unusable 
---
it's a trap bruh
---
If you join a game of SI partway through you can use recruit
---
But don‚Äôt you get all the ops free anyway(yr1s
---
Looks like Elton John 
---
No they reverted it 
---
Calm down, edgelord.
---
At least you got a player skin i got a doc charm
---
Bank, Border, Coastline, Consulate, Clubhouse, Oregon, Villa.
---
Thank you
---
You wont realise how mamy bullets you eat as fuze until he's made 2.2
---
Being that tanky on attack gives you so many options. His gadget is best used for pushing enemies into your line of sight. So you dont need to be fast for that. 
---
I would recommend Hibana or Echo. In some situations Hibana can be much more effective than a thermite, and echo is almost broken on bomb
---
I wanted that damn doc charm lmao
---
Dude Doc's Humanity is a sweet charm wut u mean boi
---
Is there any way to find the other chibis from last seasons ?. Other than the ubi store, i'm from Latam.
---
Do you not have the y3 ops etc?
---
Maybe he can sing away my sadness
---
IDK IF THEY'VE UPDATED IT 
---
a couple of months ago whenever a meme was posted it would be removed 
---
Also these mods are inconsistent 
---
Not gonna be a Dick but a simple search couldve found this out. But eh, this is the Siege subreddit anyway
---
So unplayable üò°
---
thanks bro:)
---
It wasn't on the rainbow 6 website so I gave up there
---
Wall behind him soft too
---
Bill is fucking dead
---
A e s t h e t i c
---
Aim assist
---
An infection that liked to kill instead of infecting 
---
Pricing changes to DLC operators will be announced tomorrow.
---
ur damn right 
---
It‚Äôs not a ranked game if I don‚Äôt spend my first twenty seconds of the match rubber banding in stone 
---
15 headshots.
---
Thank you :)
---
Use IQ‚Äôs aug, much better than the commando IMO
---
"CQC" 
---
Angled grip + reflex, and muzzle brake for the 552 makes it more consistent
---
Or having a stroke while trying to place gadgets down
---
Rushing has always been a tactic in siege since the early days, you just always need to be prepared for it. It has gotten more popular in the last two years with operators that facilitate that level of play being introduced. 
---
They‚Äôre taken from a different image, so the brightness/colour/saturation is different. When you see the chibi‚Äôs side by side, the skin tone is identical. 
---
If theres a hole, theres a way 
---
Mozzie means Mosquito, which is probably to do with him hacking enemy drones which makes them pests. Whereas Gridlock would probably mean the webbing trap she deploys locks the person into place.
---
#Don't try it. 
---
[Haha, hilarious and original](https://youtu.be/-1yzoiUIGGs)
---
I think taking away her acog is a start.
---
Ah don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôve found a loophole!
---
Same here. I‚Äôm an American and foreigners think we‚Äôre all fat, redneck, idiots. Every country has their stereotypes.
---
stUpid ThicC
---
Yeah tbh i struggle to choose a sight for them, ACOG is nice but I think it‚Äôs a bad fit for the AUG. I‚Äôll try the red dot. Ty
---
I agree 
---
Ping is not an advantage anymore, for the love of god recognize this one day.
---
Now I‚Äôm not completely versed with a ps4, but I think that unless you get a physical edition,‚Äôyou can‚Äôt upgrade. Digital Upgrades like that are only on Steam I believe. But I would recommend getting it if you figure out how.
---
Yeah but they wont, why? because they dont care that no one likes it, they make great money from it
---
Alright, thanks 
---
People who make SVGs of images should be Knighted on the spot.
---
I need more chungus ops on attack
---
That‚Äôs not how it works bud :)
---
I can't agree with any of your decisions. Honestly. I mean, if that's how you want the game played then I can't take your opinion away, but I think the devs are doing just fine. They didn't want to nerf ash into oblivion like you do with all of your nerfs. The devs were in a tough place with ash and I'm sure removing her acog was not the first thing in a long line of suggestions they had to weigh in. These guys have been doing this for years on a game they made and they get paid more or less based on how well they do. I'm gonna trust them.
---
FORTNITE REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Smoke: What the fuck is that white stuff in my     canister?
---
Bandit:
---
This is a joke right?...
---
Found the 12 year old
---
copper?
---
ya this game left "operator" territory a long time ago, now its like overwatch meme characters
---
Goobisoft
---
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
---
Can you please make like a wallpaper
---
At the minute I‚Äôm torn between alibi and ela
---
just turn off chat and mute everyone on your team, test 2-3 games and you will see that it really improves game. no more toxicity and no more bs.
---
"bUt wHaT aBOut caLLOuts"
---
just buy a headset and learn how to listen.
---
Yeah because the red dot is more precise 
---
I know that it's way too trap heavy for defenders and I'm not disagreeing it's just some of your ideas are a bit extreme
---
I like the methodical approach, and I usually win matches because of it. I don't enjoy rushing in but playing strats since my aim isn't anything to write home about. One thing that I enjoy a lot is that people don't watch their corners when rushing, so i can just let them through with my cav on an off-site spot and get them from behind
---
Yeah I know but his shield has almost nothing special but only the pmm. I think he's the most underrated shield op because of this in addition to the fact that the ak12 is a really good ar. In general he is underrated as an operator and I think that the main problem is his speed.
---
leave her acog 2 speed 2 armor = still great fragger, zofia becomes more valid again and ash pick rate will slightly drop w hich brings her in line with 99% of the other operators
---
Exactly 
---
honestly just play more to get better PvE is not that good for anything.
---
8 operators for free: Blackbeard, Valkiryie, Hibana, Echo, Buck, Frost, Caveira and Capitao.
---
Are they any good? 
---
Yeah I know but anyone knows that speed is the most important stat in the game. The best operators usually are the faster ones. I think being a 2 speed would give him more flexibility.
---
Thatcher, Mute, Smoke, Blitz.
---
Probably the new attacker will be one. I mean, if it's the female one, look at how big she is.
---
thats not true. still one of the 3 best guns, awesome gadget, small hitbox 
---
https://r6tab.com/265e02be-a4fc-4aa8-9a1e-5e0e845bc229
---
What really happened in this video, is that we saw genuine bad defenders. 
---
Those 5 guys were playing Overwatch or fortnite and hungry for kill.
---
Five Cooper players can handle any single plat in defense if they play the game the way it should be.
---
WhAt ThE fUcK?
---
Yeah xd
---
Yup that‚Äôs elite Glaz on bottom and Maestro on too
---
Lol
---
Oh well I'm just stupid apparently :D  
---
Thank you. 
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôm glad you like it
---
Thatcher/zofia. Lesion/valky 
---
Seriously? This just took a turn for the awesome!
---
No please
---
Jesus christ... It's Jason Bourne
---
How didn't they land a single shot on you?
---
a discussion usually works that you dont write a butt hurt comment  without anything useful. if you have counter arguments I m open to talk otherwise c ya
---
the older ops have to get a reduction as its old adn i dont think they are gonna do the step by step price reduction.  
---
like its not going to be %25,%20,%10 for price reductions.
---
Took me a while to notice the red dot sight
---
Last ping was 492. That's a good day for me
---
Local delaers?

*Cries in HGC*
---
It might be if you have the starter pack for the game and all the ops you have bought are already taken you have to ha e recruit
---
Listen man... this is a good lesson for you to do something I‚Äôve done! We got the game at the same time by the by. I found a lovely group of three others with whose friends i play with. These guys were casual randoms, and I‚Äôve been playing with them for more than a month! I suggest getting on voice chat and communicating as much as possible!
---
i get that but thats what the test server is for. I ve been playing since alpha, so I ve been around all the announcements and failed balancing changes. We have the trap meta because they desperatly tried to slow down the game - the game is faster then ever and now we have 3000 traaps on the field = fail.
---
What happens in those cases is that the translation team doesn't have access to context, or possibly the game itself.
---
So in the case of "set device", it really could be one or the other, and the translator has to make a choice. In a military themed game, it's not stupid to imagine an order being given.
---
The other thing is that translators are paid by the word, so taking time to figure out wtf secure window is only doable for so long before you literally lose money, because you could be using that research time to translate something else and get paid.
---
What normally happens then is that someone at Ubi check that it works well in-game. What probably happened it that for languages like Turkish, they don't do it very thoroughly, or not at all. 
---
What could *possibly* go wrong?
---
cant believe how big this game got
---
What hell have you created
---
Aaaand a drone hacker is coming... Hmm.. 
---
You missed a spot
---
Christ... how long have you been playing the game for? Three days?  None of these would work, and would just break the game further.
---
Just wish iq had at least stuns it smokes but claymore and breaches are alright 
---
I got the uniform. To be honest I don't use pulse that much but might as well start playing with him.
---
I Also use her 1√ó optics, bit Thats when i Wanna rush. I use her ACOG when i Wanna plat save
---
Which pro league bundles
---
Shit... I thought I'll be original at least once... 
---
Okay, you completely lost me with the J√§ger argument.  What does that have to do with anything?   
---
Also if you‚Äôre gonna argue that people will take her for fragging, Twitch and Jackal have better guns than the R4c (also can still have acogs) and they all bring better utility to the team than Ash would.  Also IQ and Hibana are 3 speeds with pretty decent guns (not to mention hibana‚Äôs a hard breacher.)   
---
Ash as a 2 speed 2 Armor is outclassed at every corner.  Yes this nerf would lower her pick-rate, but it would lower it to that of Tachanka.  I guess I‚Äôm fine with that, I don‚Äôt play Ash, but Ubi probably wouldn‚Äôt want that.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it took very long
---
It was for finka not him
---
I ground 15 for a charm
---
It‚Äôs ok, thanks for trying. I‚Äôll figure it out
---
Nerf Ash : make her gadget a Buck like
---
More recoil
---
Less ADS speed
---
Yo imagine fuze with frags though
---
Lol I'm not an Ash main, yes of course she's my most used operator, but I'm level 305 so the gap between the hours spent with my operators is really low. The fact that she's my most used one doesn't mean she's my main. I started with Fuze, I always liked his gadget and how it works and I use him today, too. The only thing I'm complaining about is the fact that he's too slow for rotations.
---
The team ones
---
Instead allow players to set a tag than the game forcing it upon them.
---
Oh, that helps a ton!   
---
Sorry to insult mods in general, there‚Äôs just some times where the disconnect can be frustrating. 
---
I got that one last week. Its such a dull skin and isnt much change aside from his ear peice and the frame of his glasses. 
---
Just ew.
---
just like a simple bullet or explosive))
---
That looks awesome!
---
r/titlegore
---
Wait, how did OP get caught with an airjab? I thought it only affects defenders.
---
I though the same, it might be acting on his own in a certain area where you shoot it.
---
Thank you Kanye very cool
---
Yeah, but I'm installing the PC version right now and will probably end up giving Ubisoft even more money because I'm a crack addict with this game.
---
Australia.
---
Good lord, I need to start watching Kix's stream! That was glorious through and through
---
In this case i give you a late gg
---
Is it still getting updates
---
Should have unlocked him first now hes mad and will never be yours
---
I play on PC and Im on level 245. And I played a hell a lot casual until like 6 months ago(thats a reason why my ranked kd is pretty bad 1.0). And I met a few teamkillers in the past. Even about a year ago one of my friends was enjoying doing such disgusting things. But when we were playing ranked (about 20 in a season) he was not toxic. (Before you spread the hate he stopped playing after operation Chimera and restarted like 4 months ago, and he stopped being a toxic kid.) So in my opinion go play ranked, there will be teamkillers, players are going to leave your match but not even nearly as often(the probability) decreases by the highness of your rank) ... With the main 3 person squad of 2 gold 3s and a gold 2, we usually dont get these kind of a people.(a lot of them left, like almost every 5th match, but only had 2 matches with teamkillers, from my 109 matches). I hope so that if you play ranked you wont encounter such small brained kids... 
---
I switch between them if I play bank or coastline sometimes. I am gonna miss it 
---
I just found it like 8 months ago and I binge watched pretty much the whole thing. I love the story and the fight scenes
---
Xbox here, people are very toxic. I had a dude try to tk my friend for not clutching a 1v4 as Monty. 
---
Only defenders can trigger it, but if an attacker is in the range of the airjab at the time of the explosion, he is knocked back as well.
---
Yeah I think you can upgrade w/ physical edition
---
When did this community become such dicks?
---
Pretty sure he brings a turret
---
I fell u
---
I am awe the size of this valk
---
I have Tatcher and Pulse Elite.........and I got both headgears fml 
---
It's just like a claymore, it only reacts to a defender but both defenders and attackers are affected by it. Defender walks into airjab range and an attacker is also there? They both go flying
---
No tachanka, no point.
---
That was a satisfying 5 minute monty montage. Loved it
---
I think you mean transition lol.
---
Anyway, just be mentally prepared that PC needs 10x the skill on console, imo. Oh and you'll meet several tryhards. Ignore them.
---
I think the goal was less on console. And on PS4 I believe we actually have more players. Don't quote me on that though.
---
yuck
---
...in another trailer where they are driving along she throws traps along a road and he shoots out a hacking shot thingy so I‚Äôm like 90% sure she‚Äôs the defender and he‚Äôs the attacker.
---
üòÇ
---
No you didnt it was posted on this exact same sub yesterday, you just cropped it LULW
---
Hmmm
---
And it was Friday for this, people are working
---
Oh okay, I use 11 and feel pretty comfortable with it, thanks.
---
You werent wrong
---
Yes, you could derank to copper, charm is just for highest rank reached
---
It'll get slower once the crouch-spam fix gets patched in, don't worry.
---
alright thanks. btw happy cake day!
---
If new people place welcome mats in open places, which they will they will be rendered useless.
---
Traps require map knowledge for effectiveness 
---
You cant circlejerk Ash as hard to be effective with and act like losing all you Kapkans to a Twitch is effective for beginners.
---
I live on xbox servers, trust me, i wont argue any of that LOL 
---
Girl: *Come over*
---
Mozzie: *I can't, I'm protecting the hostage*
---
Girl: *My parents aren't home*
---
Mozzie: *On my way*
---
Jesus Christ
---
Holy sh*t!! U are right!
---
Yes but it can be completely useless if used at the wrong time. When used at the right time it can win the game.
---
Thought Gridlock was the attacker. Isn‚Äôt he supposed to have a net to counter roamers?
---
Not necessarily. From my experience beginners put their traps near sight a majority of time which isn‚Äôt bad
---
American army and Air Force wears berets.
---
Well it is apart of the game mode 
---
Like this, but in the Siege format,  and animated.
---
ugh yes i did
---
I‚Äôm gonna do it. I‚Äôm gonna say the N word.
---
15 headshots ain‚Äôt shit
---
Yeh but i mean she has a decent gun / 3 speed / "no hitbox". It isnt hard to get kills with those kind of ability its all up to the user to get the frags (aim).
---
Its nothing compared to the buck c8 recoil ( acog ).
---
daily reminder that the guy that used to voice big the cat was also the guy that voices duke nukem
---

---
i think a short tutorial on what the gadgets are and how they work while also showing how to effectively use them would help new players aswell 
---
he drives a bike
---
Same problem:(
---
They fixed her hit box and aim isn‚Äôt easy to learn in this game for a beginner 
---
Damn good bro
---
i feel you bro that was my 2nd event pack too , i was staring at the screen like im sure you were too looking for diferences from the original headgear.
---
talk about low effort.
---
Looks like he will spawnkill you if you start talking smack
---
I agree but the thing is that there are really an infinite number of ways to use each ability effectively 
---
Not the 16th of February? They wrote 15th of Feb for Wind Bastion. 
---
I guess they said some delay announcement which I missed.
---
&gt;shitgun
---
That‚Äôs either a typo or accurate
---
Hey man don‚Äôt end it all 
---
I‚Äôm gonna go on a limb and say it‚Äôs probably not a real song but one of those ‚Äúambient‚Äù noises they use to add detail to the world building. It‚Äôs probably just a 5 second recording that‚Äôs been purposely static‚Äôd out to add affect to the game. 
---
To ban ops yes, itsrwther boring to know that either blitz or lion have a 99% chance of being banned outright yet unless I have 2 friends we can not ban an hibanna because no one wants to play against any of them. 
---
You gotta make sure they can't go to town with the Lord himself.
---
In that case most people will place all three Alibi's anyway so she should be green.
---
Again. Base on effectiveness or ease of use. Not both
---
Ash is green by ease of use, Red by effectivness same with all the traps.
---
Lol ikr
---
Ban phase without a banned ash its not a van phase simple as that ash main lean and crouch abuse yay what a nice game! Waste of time ubi 
---
Sorry F√ºhrer 
---
Yes border workshops
---
Wrong invitational. You're looking at 2018, not 2019. 
---
Note the "chimera" and "year 3 reveal" 
---
But alibi is more of a roamer which isnt usually something thats easy for new players as they dont have strong map knowledge. The green are anchors mostly or ops that can play in objective 
---
I dont think id be able to go heavier than death core. Ive got a playlist all the way from crazy on you by heart, to lost in the static by after the burial. A7x is my favourite though
---
They made the black lining around the reticle thinner so you can see more ads
---
If you use the internet theres no chance in hell you missed any news on the games. Especially when it has been known for months that it starts on a friday. 
---
then wouldnt dohka also be easy?
---
Yeah the same thing happened to me on console but not on pc for some reason 
---
Maybe people should stop giving out opinions in regards what new players decide to play as 
---
They're not gonna learn if people say they shouldn't play them 
---
sure but you gotta start somewhere right? i think its important to get the very basics down first so you can progress as you play.
---
LOL
---
yes but its a game, it doesnt have to be ultra realistic
---
Bruh it's a game.
---
No because of her limited gun selection
---
True 
---
None.
---
 i feel you i had 4 other guys that i played with daily sadly one of them died and the rest quit fly high Ethan üòì
---
Yeah haha, thats because i copy the eye and forgot to adjust it. Sorry for that!
---
Cheers!
---
Yo thats the lego technic thingie!
---
ah but see twitchy beard is part french so she gains +20% Enemy Surrender Chance. that's what makes her OP
---
Soo.... 4th wall break inside of a 4th wall break? That's like, 16 walls.
---

PC - Better overall kinda, it‚Äôs always been more fun on PC to me
---
PS4 - If you like toxicity and people talking mad shit then PS4. Personally I like a little shit talking and toxicity in my games so I play on PS4 mostly. That and I have more friends on PS4 
---
Angry?
---
Youve completley shown youre not "Open to discussion" despite acting like you are.
---
Im not angry i am hungry though. Ill go eat a Hot Pocket and enjoy Ranked.
---
Goodluck getting anyone to take you seriously
---
A twitch drone with a shield that shoots cameras and bullets. 
---
Yes this is right I mixed up the names
---
Yeah fuck that soccer dad. Echo I'm starting to hate a lot as well. Poor blackbeard is made of paper now, so he's no longer a threat. This new patch is going to fuck dokkabi mains in the ass as well as ash mains. 
---
I fucking hated the alpha packs, I ended up getting some gun skins (Which were mildly terrible) and a charm, I usually play with shotguns so headshots were moderately difficult cause I‚Äôm on console and can‚Äôt aim for shit and I‚Äôve been thoroughly disappointed 
---
White genocide of course. Gamers rise up 
---
Just an FYI as someone with a very common form of color blindness (10% of males supposedly have it) the green and yellow are indistinguishable. It just looks like most are green and a few are red
---
Buddy we literally discussed our opinions and you are a toddler 
---
She has some, ive seen some of her fanart with freckles, and her character model does have too. And i kinda like girl with freckles so i guess i draw that a bit too much hehe
---
so you are both judging gadget and guns on a operetor to decided if he is easy?
---
&gt;be me

&gt;go to Canada every year for fishing 
---
&gt;ask dad to take me up to the international this year when he said he would if I get good grades 
---
&gt;says no
---
I'm on PC and in NA. PM me your name. 
---
You are right -- it can be difficult to find other girls to play with. I have attempted to make friends with plenty of females, but a lot of them are streamers it seems, and they only want to play with other streamers on average. I usually just play games with my SO and his friends.
---
I recently bought Siege while it was on sale on Steam, so I won't be even close to decent for a while lol I also am not in the habit of using a microphone because I don't like anyone knowing I am a female, but if I had some girls to play with I'd probably be more comfortable to do that.
---
I won't be able to play too often because of work, though, but if I do play it tends to be nights and weekends.
---
Will do!
---
Noooo, my eyes.
---
I can't unsee that.
---
Um im sorry?
---
Crouch/Lean spamming are being fixed ASAP as said by ubi
---
Yes 
---
What did you expect?
---
She watches him? How did you get that?
---
I have both the invitational headgear and uniform for Ash, but I hate the head gear so I'm using only the uniform.
---
I see, I like to use him with the CAMRS, in this case what's the color? 
---
I don‚Äôt really understand how clash is red?
---
Oh no not my video game toy
---
I think 4:3 Instagram videos on reddit are toxic
---
It‚Äôs his pp protector 
---
Id still say red because for a new player marksman rifle is harder to use plus his ability requires map knowledge
---
I‚Äôm here all weekend and looking to get these. Can you tell me where In the venue they will be? Merch was pretty sparse tbh didn‚Äôt see these at all. 
---
Big Think 
---
Nomad shouldn't be able to manipulate a gun...
---
Like I said I don‚Äôt know much about ps4 or Xbox, I play on Pc, so I can‚Äôt really help you with that
---
then how did both j√§ger and bandit and up yellow when both those gadgets are pretty straight foward and their guns too
---
Good point. 
---
To really use her effectively it requires team play and strategies
---
**F**
---
That would be awful. Someone grinding from Plat to Diamond FINALLY hits Diamond and stays in it for the last 5 days, they get a Plat charm because they played more games in Plat? No. 
---
Ah, now the name calling.
---
The true sign of someone who is validating their opinion by any means necessary.
---
Your username would be Lucifer because this shit is fire. 
---
The way I remember it is that gridlock has that spiky web looking trap for the attackers that slows them down. So like gridlock in traffic the op that steps on it gets slowed down. But that may not even be what her gadget does 
---
Have my upvote
---
Because roaming is harder for new players thats why all the greens are anchors 
---
Ok buddy have a nice day
---
Yes
---
I want to get six collection chibis especially the bundle one but they are expensive üòÇ I think even more than Elite skins.
---
Thanks, kind sir. What calls?
---
This literally fits the narrative too, he is very hyper active and i cant wait to see the story and what kind of obstacles he may have had in life
---
I suggest marking Castle as red. He's highly situational and takes quite a bit of experience to use properly. If a new player picks up Castle, chances are this player is going to castle off rotations and frustrate more experienced players on the team.
---
Glaz definitely does have his thermal scope in the situation. I was letting my nephew play it 2 days ago and it worked just fine.
---
Don't know if they will be for sale but if you have something good to offer I might trade Tachanka to you. Thermite is my original main so no go on that
---
üç∞
---
Oh.
---
Cheers *^*^
---
No,'it is a real song....It is on a radio station in on of the fallout games.
---
It's not really a grind, is it? Three matches average I'd say.
---
Yes your right that ash's use use is for fragging.
---
But it is an independent attacker which doesnt interact with any kind of different attacker ( like thermite &amp; thatcher ).
---
You dont need to have map knowledge like sledge / buck to open from above.
---
All you need is aim/no brain. And after couple games of ash you will get kinda used to its recoil.
---
What im trying to say is to use ash you dont need requirments ( from ingame ) but rather own personal skill. 
---
Trying to monitor toxicity is only gunna work against them. 
---
I would agree but even with the ump alone id say hes easy to use 
---
Maybe it is the same ? If I don't find out, I'll probably buy it anyway, it is a great deal.
---
R6 Twitch : [https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6](https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6)
---
Ah sorry I said or instead of and, soif you finish a season in plat but spend most time on gold you get that plat charm. The time thing should only be used if more time was spent in a higher rank than what you finished.
---
Hope that makes sense lol. 
---
Because on the PS4 events section, whenever the date they list is the date it usually ends. So for example, for Grim Sky it was say October XYZ - December 3rd. December 4th Wind Bastion was released. So for Wind Bastion they wrote 4th December - 15th Feb, so that's why I assumed it was releasing tomorrow or very soon, but clearly I didn't know that this is not the case this time.
---
As Always üëå
---
Tachanka's gadget may be simple but to be effective he's not an easy op.
---
I'd say that the season will end somewhere around march 4th-the date when buying the season pass doesn't get you the skin
---
Dude tachanka cant be effective i considered just crossing him out completely but he‚Äôs still an anchor with easy gun 
---
here's the question, what's your playstyle?
---
That was very satisfying to watch. Especially the red markers for when you get a kill
---
Thank you so much! I was worried that I would have to to try to get to Plat again.
---
Dude needs a custom dpi setting üòÇ
---
Maverick. 
---
Who is the guy in the middle and what is the context of this picture ?
---
Didn't know getting headshots in Siege was *Grinding*
---
looks like a new cutscene or a developer tbh, but i dont know
---
I got the same thing... still no universal skin in 5 packs
---
I wanted five pieces in total from the pack. Didn't get any
---
Okay thanks for the help! 
---
No problem, also if you want to roam or lurk lession is a great start
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
Mav, he‚Äôs so sneaky right now. If you learn the right places to use him you‚Äôll be almost unstoppable 
---
They have been leaked like a month ago, even with a picture of the spike trap. And the exact names and gadgets were leaked
---
Depending on who you take with you and how much stuff you break on the way, I wold say so, yeah. Definitely better than taking all round then having to do the same thing anyway with 5 seconds on the clock. That and if you get to the objective fast enough you‚Äôll probably catch a defender or two with their pants down. 
---
I believe a 30% - 35% headshot to kill ratio is the average 
---
I was doing it a bit slower to show how to do it but if you practice this a few times you can get it done fairly quick.
---
Hmm I wonder if you have enough cams??
---
I thought I showed gridlock driving a truck in the preview
---
I live in Canada but I got no one to go with. This year wouldn‚Äôt be the year for me anyways though as both EG and SSG are out from the quarter finals. Booo :(
---
I only see a 4k
---
Your name alone gives me PTSD
---
until yesterday I thought they had each other's names so I really feel this post. 
---
WE HAVEN\`T ENOUGHT TIME!!!!!!!!!
---
Damn, I wanted to go to the first pr leagues but I was like 14 lmao or whatever 
---
she looks like spongebob‚Äôs grandma
---
I‚Äôve never heard of lurking before, is that like another word for roaming? 
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve got him unlocked. He‚Äôs the one with the toxic needles right? I guess I know what I‚Äôm saving up my renown for :) 
---
I clearly wrote 5v4
---
Probably looks cuter this way 
---
I still cant believe the amount of times that glitch happens where mira is holding a depl shield in her hand and if I shoot at her torso where she is holding the shield, the game makes it look like I hit the shield and then I get killed afterwards by a gun of hers even though the killcam shows she was using a weapon to kill me
---
Forget about ur kd no one knows if u play ranked
---
Echo too right? 
---
Yeah that happens a lot, dont put too much stock in the ranking system. Its kind of garbage. 
---
I just received my Copper and Bronze drops. they should appear on your notifications now
---
&gt;level 6
---
I think it has to do with the fact that Ela [was hired by a PMC](https://i.imgur.com/0ORE2i9.png) and therefore her uniform resembles a mixture of both styles of uniform (considering the fact that PMCs are usually much less strict on uniform usage).
---
It's from the Six Invitationals stream, it flashed up for literally 1 frame.
---
Yeah i mixed them up on accident, was referring to Mozzie
---
Yeah I got complete shit for my first four packs but I finally got the invitational skin I wanted for the last one
---
I think before the Patch in Wind Bastion the P9's iron sights were changed (I personally liked that changed design alot more because its slim and makes seeing around the sights easier) and  after the patch it got its old  design back from the looks of it
---
You should also use colors that are associated with the specific faction. FBI (Orange), SAS (Violet), GIGN (Sky Blue), etc. It‚Äôd be another way for the presentation to look more crisp. 
---
Maverick
---
So the point of a rush is to get to the objective before the enemy team is ready to properly deal with enemies, or at least caught off-guard?
---
Comparing a trade at the start to the end put things in perspective for me and I can definitely appreciate that logic. Looks like I‚Äôm gonna die a lot before I get this thing down lol
---
"Wow" - Owen Wilson
---
We're kidding around goddammit
---
I disagree. He is an operator whose gadget doesn't require you to be in a hurry, and he is tanky as hell. I actually hope that they add more 3 armor attackers. From the looks of it Gridlock might be one and I am happy.
---
Who is the guy in the middle
---
It's bugged for his operation.

His **THICC**  forearms protected him
---
I also wonder!
---
they just said on the stream *"if you're interested in the lore, you should keep watching"* 
---
**(On the schedule it says 6 Universe at 3pm EST)**
---
No, but it costs a ton to pay the salaries of dozens of people that create new maps/characters/balance changes/new assets/coding/servers/maintenance/Etc.... they fund all this with those little vests.
---
Thanks. Maybe he replaces Angela Basset as Six
---
I just don't want to be in constant fear of being tked
---
You need to get at least one headshot in the S.I. playlist to collect the prize.
---
then it‚Äôs not an ace 
---
I also got it. I was really hoping for his uniform but apparently not.
---
Would you even be allowed in since Siege is rated 18?
---
oh shit, sweet, just got my copper, bronze and silver drops :D
---
I mean, leaving the stream open isn't rocket science. Let's say it was and someone didn't think of it. I doubt someone would want to watch it for more then three hours unless:
---
A) They bought tickets and are at the event. But since we're talking about Twitch, this point is invalid.
---
B) They have a serious addiction to Siege.
---
C) A diamond charm is the only way they'll ever get diamond.
---
I've had to read this at least twenty times since Gridlock was revealed and it's never been funny even once
---
i got the Vector skin :(

No clue man but if it's like ee3 r cod xp you can be accompanied by an adult.

Bandit looks unusually expressive in the actual screenshot, moreso than his weird-ass op portrait

No its a short movie feature that will premiere during the siege universe segement today at the invitational.
---
Considering this is a screenshot and not a video, I'm assuming you did.

\*duplicate\*
---
I'll be honest, I saw this table and was like "there's going to be so much debate in the comments..." and I wasn't wrong. xD
---
Feel lucky I‚Äôve gotten 4 shitty ornaments for ops I‚Äôve never touched.
---
No shes hard to use effectively 
---
Minor criticism... I'm a bit colorblind and the yellow and green are indistinguishable.
---
What? No.
---
meh, so no r6 for me then. sadlife.
---
&gt; I'm I the only one
---
probably not.
---
Does anyone have the "I'm the best player in the world" clip from this Guy?
---
It doesn't
---
He chooses to live life as a gay man. 
---
Got the same thing 
---
I saw that photo getting taken can't believe you're still alive!
---
Yup, with most operators their gadget continues to work after they are dead (mute, bandit, rook, Valkyrie etc), with echo he can‚Äôt shoot from his yokais, which is what makes him so valuable, it‚Äôs same with Maestro. 
---
OI MATE..... MY FOCKING DRUGS YOU SWINE
---
Thank you a bunch!
---
i feel that except i've bought 5 packs other then the two free ones i've got and 4 of them were charms

hey,happy cake day

Blackwashing them one by one.

Manufacturing chemicals is probably a lot more than just mixing shit together.

3 speed blitz would be terrifying

True, although it's a little dodgy as to whether it will time you out or not. I refresh my stream every half an hour or so.

And she has throwing baguettes

and it wasnt even OP

china

i feel like it's a anothonypit1 reference because of the outfit he chose

well you still try to get their defining characters into the chibi

You get used to it.

You're.. great
---
She looks so cute! 
---
His ADS time will probably decrease as a way of making him less frustrating to play against, as well as some future changes to his ability :(
---
Yes but they hardly ever utilize the gadget, many times the rounds end with both charges unused. 
---
You know what my grind gave me? A frickin rare charm.
---
will the short film be uploaded elsewhere? because i want to watch it but i'll be at work when it releases

Holy shit that‚Äôs a reference I haven‚Äôt heard in awhile but you‚Äôre totally right

---
Howe many games is a grind?
---
I was going back and forth between xbox and pc at the beginning of year 3 after playing only xbox since red crow (even though I had it since launch but none of my friends played it so I played call of duty with them till red crow). After grim sky I switched over completely to pc yea it sucked to basically lose all my skins and charms you can't get anymore and the money I spent on them, but it feels so much better to play on pc that I really don't mind bc my experience overall is better.
---
Maybe lurk a bit but never a full roam
---
How many games it take you? took me 3
---
It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm from Quebec, therefore, a relative of Buck
---
they all seem super chill, nothing but laughs &amp; fist bumps even when they lose a round
---
Pretty sure it's [@chaiveon](https://twitter.com/chaiveon).
---
Awesome! Great shot of ma boy
---
mhmm...who's the guy in the middle?
---
IQ, Thatcher, and any op that has a frag or explosive.
---
I see this topic come up a lot. It's not that the gameplay had changed, the core loop is still there. The only difference is that the game has aged, and its players are more comfortable with being aggressive. Roaming was unheard of in the beta of Siege, just like how feinting was in the For Honor beta. 
---
The game's not changing, it's players are just getting better. 
---
I think someone said what the song was in the comments, I‚Äôll go check.
---
Looks great but also ow my eyes
---
Im hoping he's the face of white mask. But again thats just a theory, a game theory thanks for watching 
---
And he‚Äôs such a good coach on top of that. I really hope Nora can take this next map from empire 
---
You wouldn't. It was just a thought. Jesus Christ you guys are fun
---
I assume so. At the very least, the full VOD will be made available after the stream is over.
---
this gets commented daily and daily people are told it can‚Äôt be done. 
---
Damn you, beat me to it
---
If you play in a team, lion could work great for you.  His rework is announced tomorrow so if you were considering wait to see what it is then and his guns good.  Other then that, you‚Äôd love Blackbeard if you like to stay back( I think you mentioned) and peek corners/windows, you almost have 2-3 lives with his shield when peeking. 
---
what software do you use to animate?
---
Thanks for sharing! Love seeing credits where it is due!
---
A siege theory
---
The 552 is better honestly. The ttk is almost the same between the 2 guns but the 552 is faster at killing 3 armors. Also, the 552 does more damage per bullet so if you don‚Äôt kill the enemy they will be left weaker. Also also the 552 has an angled grip.  Also also also the 552 doesn‚Äôt take up as much of the screen.
---
Lionman has left the game 
---
That IS somethink you should be announcing even if it will be you're last day on life.
---
Best elite skin in the game if released haha
---
Mixing things together, eh?
---
Username checks out. 
---
Idk why...but I love this so much!
---
During that freeze time, do you look to the upper right corner and see something? Like two cubes merged yellow or red? 
---
Montagne main what do you expect lulw
---
When I transferred to pc I downloaded a few free to play shooters to get aiming down. Also t hunt would be helpful as well.
---
Have a pair of fuzzy crocs, can confirm, the comfort I get from them outweighs the fact that their crocs by a considerable margin.
---
One OP that can get the clothes of one OP after kill him, and put it on,  To deceive the attackers. 
---
Why would vigil be easier to play than ela?
---
If you have an ad blocker, then it must be fun to play siege like CS:GO
---
Indeed!
---
So I think you should use some ops that reward teamplay
---
In attack it's more thermite thatcher and in a second time capitao and montagne.
---
In defense you should use echo maestro doc.
---
Lots of t hunt 
---
His guns 
---
Does anyone know if the year 3 ops will have a $30 pack when year 4 drops??? Plz tell me.
---
Leverage. A shield. If you go through the process of taking a hostage you aren‚Äôt just going to shoot them as soon as the police arrive
---
I WANT
---
At least I got a doc epic uniform.... Also I see my Mira uniform as epic Everytime I win but I do not seem to have that skin. Bug?
---
Happened to me on a 2 v 2 I was attacking and asked for a knife fight. 3 out of 5 did it and I gunned the last two and won.
---
I'd assume so, there's no confirmation yet though.
---
If your at the Invitationals I'll trade Tachanka for food.
---
Bold of you to assume I have skills of any kind
---
Assuming you already know maps/game/operators, try for getting a confortable sensibility, good keyboard config (example i really like to match for all games the same config like alt to crouch)
---
After that, train, aim, that is fundamental to go to ranked and of course, unlock operators.
---
Nice. I was looking at getting these a while back, but forgot about them. Now I am gonna pick up a set or two!
---
Was his other primary a shotgun or another rifle? 
---
Cuz of his ads
---
Tons of retailers and ither people do it to gain publicity and so they can sell more. It's simple marketing.
---
Don't take my word for it, but i was thinking it's making a frame around their face: "headshot"
---
&gt; So they probably wanted her to look less spooky. 
---
while giving her a sawblade 
---
You could do it last summer. Not possible anymore. Sorry
---
Thanks man,
---
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy tho? 
---
This is an enamel pin. Poor artists, musicians and just people make them easily. 
---
They literally said it's a limitation of the game engine though, and anyway, even if it can happen eventually, spamming it daily isn't helping them.
---
Sadly is how it works and there is no look to change. If im not wrong you got a 15min ban.
---
I'm new, no understand Engrish.

Why is Mavericks picture split? Is it just another one of him?

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre salty about the banter, it‚Äôs just an old worn out joke that hasn‚Äôt been funny for a while.

Sneaky sneaky.

I just feel like the bosg alone would negate the scorpion. And then the smg-12 and cz. Personally the cz was harder for me to use than the smg-12
---
No bambwooshle
---
True! More accurate wording would have been that I love his subtle antics too, in addition to the rest of his ‚Äúperformance!‚Äù
---
 1.   No his batteries only electrify one was reinforcement at a time. 
---
2.  Place jammers on door ways drone holes and on reinforced walls because the also stop breachcharges/thermite charges
---
Tbh siege is shit compared to the old games. Sure the multiplayer can be fun but it‚Äôs so goofy and every game plays the same on ranked. Not to mention terrorist hunt is a joke in siege

Stop. Playing. Casual.

I wonder how many people actually get this?

I though the same as well. Happy cake day as well!

She literally looks lik someone who's trying to disguise as Ela but sucks at lying ahahahah
---
No, nothing like that, but my steam frames counter disappears halfway through the freeze then reappears shortly after
---
Yes, I agree, 8 traps is so much but I think that if he will have 4 traps he MUST have them at the start of the round and gu's are so small, they also have to make them bigger. (I'm Spanish so I maybe have some ortographic errors) 
---
It's an unofficial stat so, no, likely will never be implemented

Uhhhh he‚Äôs the new Six I guess 
---
I find many many many rounds end with a last 30 second push for the objective.
---
It's Harry
---
The guy in the middle seems to be "Six" according to the small cinematic they just did.   
---
Call him Harry,  
---
Harry Potter in siege holy shitttttttt
---
No but really I don't know much about Rainbow 6 lore so if anyone can explain what happened at the end that would be great.
---
Six OMG
---
i dont get it.. i mean i know there was six as the operation director or whatever, but how is harry relevant?
---
Is this a story mode? 
---
**Steven Ogg** (Trevor GTA) would be perfect in a real action movies as **Thatcher** 
---
I got argue, ps4 [for me] is not toxic as hell.
---
Shure you might stumble upon one in a day. 
---
Well don't you feel dumb
---
So much new potential for story, I love it
---
You nailed it 
---
Oh no :( im so sad
---
Just because he leans to the left doesn‚Äôt mean he has to have his left eye to aim. If anything it should make him a bit more exposed, but this is a video game and nothing makes sense so I can‚Äôt call it. 
---
The hairs on my arms are standing. Fookin 'ell
---
Guy in the middle might be the 5th german op
---
Finkas kinda does
---
Being a fresh Thatcher main never felt better... 
---
Somehow I joined an ongoing s.i match and got recruit, even though he isn‚Äôt playable?! ü§î
---
The moment I heard Elephant by Tame Impala I instantly ÔΩéÔΩïÔΩî
---
The old Six stepped down/retired, and now Harry, the man in the photo, is replacing Angela Bassett as Six.
---
Apart from Dokk and Thatcher, who is everybody else?
---
Yup, that's Harry.
---
SIX is the codename of the director of Rainbows team,  Originally it was the girl but i guess when she passed away a year or so ago canonically they made Harry the New SIX
---
He is the new Six. He replaced the old one, which gives us so much potential for new story.
---
Quick, congrats on all the future karma on this post.
---
Yeah, I saw that too
---
Single player this year??
---
CGI lore essentially 
---
I know right! When I saw this I couldn't believe my eyes.
---
He said something about how she (Six) left some pretty big shoes to fill, I think he replaced her. 
---
Zofia and hibana should be green...
---
I guess but Seige's optimisation is much better and covers a wider range to systems just because Ubi isn't a small Indy company.
---
You only need to do a cursory glance at Insurgency's forums and steam discussions to see the variation and complaints about the games optimisation. I don't doubt it'll get better overtime but the team working on it are small. So it'll take a while.
---
The first game turned out pretty great.
---
On "Six" shelves, there are a bunch of helmets, and they look like the a character helms from "For Honor" 
---
yeah i know, but i dont get it still how it is relevant? are they releasing a movie on it, or what?
---
*Grammar Nazis
---
I know is dumb but I really want this to be a way to introduce a training facility in siege, "supervised" by harry..
---
They said there's more aspect to fill with "rainbow training rainbow". That's what they've said on stream.
---
The guy in the middle seems to be "Six" according to the small cinematic they just did.
---
Call him Harry,
---
&gt; But what happened to Six???? 
---
to expensive to get Angela Bassett back 
---
OI HARRY lad.
---
Good Luck!
---
What‚Äôs happening I‚Äôm bowling and can‚Äôt watch?
---
It doesn't add anything that peeking to the left of the mirror to fire doesn't let you do, also means you can't set up a mirror on the other side, very much wasting mira's potential for this site.
---
Holy God, yes, this is amazing.
---
Listen, I know the multiplayer Is the part we love, sure, but after playing these characters so long, I am dying for something like this. Some lore, some characterization, a glimpse of these people and their lore. Overwatch does it right with all their short-films and character snippets.
---
If Siege plans on doing some of that, that is amazing, and props to Ubisoft. As a longtime player, this is something I've wanted for a while now, and it really adds to the experience of this game as a whole for me.
---
I dunno if we'll get more co-op based stuff, like Outbreak or something. I hope we do. I wasn't a fan of the zombies/monsters thing, but I do love the co-op and mini-"story" aspects of that kind of event.
---
Did you have some type of conversation or indication that you were into Siege, or did they just Dole them out indiscriminately?
---
funny considering it was likely meant to represent the fanbase as a whole. 
---
"What are these fucking holograms? back in my time, we had sledgehammers and we were happy"
---
Was good but little disappointed the video called hammer and scalpel didnt have sledge and doc
---
I was making a joke kid. But her throw is weak at least for me it it imo 
---
For real! The first 5 seconds with Thatcher in uniform made me question whether or not it was actually cgi
---
I believe that Ubi has just teased the operators of Year 4 with the yellow pins on the map in 4:45. What do you think?
---
That's how brazil works
---
We either:
---
Pretend we know what we are doing
---
Or
---
Don't do anything at all
---
Need more of these
---
Its obviously smoke
---
Hol up
---
Thatcher with those muthafuckin hands
---
It's confirmed by Polish Ubisoft dev that map will feature boats and a lot of water
---
Watching the invitational, i see players frag half the enemy team in a split second and get lost.  
---
 They play the game basically on hyper mode, extremely shorter timer makes it feel like a fiesta in some engages as everyone is dropping and being dropped left and right, looks fun, but not slow at all.
---
I wouldn't call it better, it was just more comfortable to play, ironically the new map looks all the same when compared to a killhouse XD
---
you would just light up every door that moved. 
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs where they sleep, just where they have all their gear. 
---
lmao canal
---
We‚Äôre talking guns, and the two I listed are better.
---
Dokkibae üòç
---
Blasphemous
---
Whats with everyone anti Fortnite bragging every time it gets over thrown by a game holding an event for a few days?
---
in the game yes, in the book series I highly doubt it. 
---
Wow mozzie looks like a normal female here 
---
If they breach the building they are not complying. Also, why do the cops win if the enemy downs the hostage and they prevent them from reving him?
---
I mostly play casual at a lower level but it‚Äôs not a common thing at all for me.
---
And? Doesn‚Äôt make the gun itself better
---
Who needs a red dot when you have all that clout!
---
The rule 34 people are gonna have a field day with this
---
Few things I've noticed about this image.
---
On each side of the main map, there are collections of images of both attackers and defenders. Each side has either the attacker or defender icon, as well as large notes that say either "TL Attack" or "TL Defend" (not sure what TL means, could also be TD or TO), surrounded by three images that are substantially larger than the others, Ash, Dokkaebi, what looks like a young Thatcher on the left, and Doc on the right, with pictures I'm going to assume are Cav and Castle, due to their names being on Harry's recording device under Dokkaebi's. I feel like this might be a hint towards another co-op mode.
---
In the top right corner of the board there is a note with the words "Project R6 Vision" with 2 photos of what looks like the Acropolis. Greek operation? It could also be connected to the large amount of notes above it, of which there are easily 100, so it could be a reference to Ubi's "100 operators" thing.
---
There is a picture of Tachanka with a note that has "The Lord" written on it. I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually find out he's the last in a line of Russian Tzars or something. Also our memes are canon.
---
Most of the smaller operator images on the board seem to be accompanied by a scrap of map signifying their place or origin/current location. Ying is in China, Tachanka is in Russia. Doc is in France, The BOPE operators are in South America.
---
The blueprints and images to the far left appear to be early concept art for the game and the gadgets for the 20 original operators. Jaeger's ADS, Mute's jammer, the defuser, and an early prototype for the bombs can all be seen. A piece of paper in the middle of this pile have the letters "R &amp; D" on it. Research and Development.
---
Smoke and Clash can be seen on Newspaper clippings around the board. R6 has been making the news. What for? No idea.
---
Each operator image seems to be accompanied by a note giving a core value about that operator. Capitao is Dedicated, What looks like Blitz's elite skin is Resilient, Tachanka is the Lord, Hibana's picture is accompanied by a note that looks like "Terrifying", but I must have misread that. Another 2 notes that don't appear to be related to any recognisable image also say "Resourceful" and "Intuitive". Ash and Doc's pictures are accompanied by notes, but I can't make out what they are.
---
Maestro, Mira, Echo, Valkyrie, Ying, Capitao and Blitz all appear to have wallet portraits on the board, of their official images. Ying, Capitao and Blitz are the only ones which have more than Just what I assume is a name underneath. There are more wallet portraits on the board, but they are unrecognisable.
---
Tachanka, Lesion, Hibana and Clash all have images that are larger, and not of their official artworks. Tachanka and Lesion have theirs taken from cinematics, Clash's appears to be concept art, and Hibana's appears to be that facial rework that was leaked here a while back.
---
Ash, Dokkaebi and Doc, along with what appears to be a young Thatcher, Castle, and Cav, have the largest images, as detailed above.
---
For Honor Lore is weird. 
---
Dok is sexy af 
---
r/FunAtParties
---
I would appreciate it if it had better grammar tbh
---
Are you just now noticing this? lol This has been a known thing since day one of Cav lol
---
He's to awesome for that weak drill shit
---
sledge hammer
---
Word to 21 Savage
---
It can't be done anymore. So your way is the only way.
---
Hopefully! They have Denmark on the map, so I'm hoping :-D
---
Makes me wonder why they're not in game.
---
Best thing i‚Äôve seen all day
---
What did they do?
---
Looks like Mira
---
Nobody likes you Dokki, go away
---
Is this for an event?
---
Who is Harry
---
Where is the croisant boi?
---
x-post what I said elsewhere:
---
With finka 
---
You know jackshit about kids if you think they dont play FPS games. The fuck do you think Call of Duty is lol?
---
Ohh, really?
---
So it's like 'remake' of this map and the old version will never come back?
---
Honestly, I'd just love something like how Overwatch provided exposition to their characters
---
Obviously Rainbow isn't as fantastical of a universe as Overwatch but I'd love to have more and longer videos just like this
---
It's a joke bud. Relax.
---
being the last one alive and dying due to a trap is allways a good contender but the most common is being killed by an interrigation and seeing your team get slaughtered due to your incompetence.
---
Its just lore.
---
9001 IQ
---
Only discount you can get for now is with ubisoft points 100points=20% cut, on uplay store.
---
Harry was 6's right-hand man. He did most of the psychological reports you can find in game
---
He's just trying not to get interrogated.
---
G2 won first map
---
Second match hasn‚Äôt started yet
---
Denmark flag at 0:45 in the background, I bet denkmark will get 2 ops this year.
---
That's a super common style of outfit where I'm at. Overalls + tee shirt is all over
---
Sure, that's the obvious IRL reason. But I do appreciate they didn't just kill her off and not bother elaborating on why. I prefer this explanation.
---
&gt;omg i really hope thats true, crazy if they would choose us over Norway and Sweden first.
---
*cries in Finnish*
---
Don't afk and ruin the game for others, that's just such a ads game. 
---
Just play the game, get a 5stack and it's not that bad. 
---
If you truly can't wait you have 2 choices, buy the passes slowly as you get cash, or upgrade to the complete edition. 
---
I know it's annoying I wanted to play siege for a really long time myself, but I did research and saw how much grinding there was to unlock everyone, and the complete edtion was ¬£99.99 and I refused to pay that, and In games like this I like to just be able to own every character, but i got it on 70% sale over Christmas, I still wouldn't be playing if that sale never happens 
---
Ubisoft said they have been working on lion and blitz for months now and waddya know, 90% of the population of this game agrees they are way to op
---
Can Ubi please make a movie already. Thanks.
---
Balancing
---
Yeah, same with Sweden. If a CTU related to Sweden is going to be released it's either SOG (special forces) or S√ÑPO (the police's counter-terrorism group)
---
"youre Six now Harry"
---
"no, im just Harry"
---
"well Just Harry, youre Six now"
---
A shame we won't get more Angela, but i'll be excited to see what kind of a character we give the new Six. 
---
dude she looks fuckin blasted
---
I recently got the game on PC,  and i simply can't lean with E&amp;Q, i wanted to set thoes on the scroll of the mouse but the game wont let me do it. Is there any other key to lean instead of Q&amp;E? 
---
P. S: Yeah, i know that is dumb, but lean on scroll would be easier for me
---
Yes its so good. The kits are so awesome.
---
Reeeeeeee
---
It seems like Basset was directly addressing Harry in the 2015 White Masks reveal, then.
---
On six's wall of pictures theres a photo of a Greek building. 
---
INCREDIBILIS!
---
Considering the time he takes to ads he gonna take a while to send that ryme with his arms
---
But is he  gunna be a new operator? Why should we care about him.
---
Lol what are you even talking about? You're still 100% wrong about Ash's hitbox. Excuses, excuses.
---
Not sure why everyone is assuming something happened to her. Angela Basset is probably really expensive to get back so she could have easily retired or been promoted. 
---
I thought they were impressive when they first played in a lan final. First kill was a spawn peeker on black dragons(?) on bank. 
---
Game had to be reset after that round because of a disconnect. But they have tightened their game up a lot since then. 
---
count yourself lucky they actually had a reason most of my TKs are literally pointless.
---
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. I got the notification when it got released and I can‚Äôt stop watching the fight scene. 
---
*For Honor is Incredibilis*
---
FTFY
---
I think he‚Äôs meant to resemble the average player 
---
Probably since we all know Ubisoft are cheap bastards.
---
What do you mean ree? I started a discussion about the stupid shit that these idiots at ubisoft do, and how they cant mod their own game.
---
Not only that, he's the CEO of the organization.
---
I‚Äôm saying that i wouldn‚Äôt trust ubi‚Äôs word on the fact that they have fixed it. 
---
I have a 12 year old cousin that has never played COD or any FPS in his life, so that‚Äôs where I get that thought from, he basically only plays Fortnite. I don‚Äôt know how typical that is, I‚Äôm just speaking from experience. 
---
My buddy got a 24h ban because people kept getting in his way. Like c'mon at least review a little bit of video.
---
Just get the guy who did Hoxton from Payday 2, also punch him in the gut a few times, nobody could tell the difference.
---
He is becoming the director/leader of the rainbow program. He will not be an operator, and he will mostly just exist for the lore.
---
2 teams kills equal a kick. 
---
I mean, does this look cheep?
---
That shit pisses me off. If you're not gonna ban, go play casual.
---
One of the comments for the video has already mentioned SFM R34 "Casual attire"
---
Personally I think the PDW9 is the most underrated gun on attack.   
---
Try thy thing with an acog and a laser sight and you‚Äôll never wanna go back, I promise.   (It‚Äôs got the most accurate hipfire in the game!)
---
Not allowing 4 queues isn't the solution. A better one would be showing an option to the victim after a tk asking whether it was intentional or not.  If the tk'er gets too many intentional tks on record, then they would be banned for a certain amount of time.
---
Besides Ubisoft would probably never ban four stacks anyway, that would be a step in the wrong direction for the already bad quality of life of their game.
---
Free to play weekend üôÉ
---
that was so random, what does it all mean?
---
Fookin brilliant this
---
There's  to hope   they do  more  of these,  I'd  love one  for  Montagne!
---
Don't buy them they look awful and we demand better product if you buy they won't learn
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you but this is much more situational than most. Like I said I don‚Äôt have the idea I‚Äôd love it for blue hatch or basement in bank but I don‚Äôt see it being viable on every map 
---
It might be able to be countered by a good nade 
---
Some RGB gamer socks
---
Cant wait to see more.
---

---
lmao so you're not allowed to care when playing a game now? 
---
Maybe you should get some friends instead of crying.
---
And she  was    so good  at it,  that   it   got her a promotion.
---
Hi. While this aesthetically looks similar to what he is talking about, it is incorrect. While the external vest is utilizing MOLLE, it is not shaped correctly to fit ballistic plates nor is it meant to. He is wearing it correctly as intended OVER the ballistic protection. This is a holdover a lot of police agencies and tactical teams who are generally less funded and as such use systems from the 80's and 90's before MOLLE was popularized and multiple layers had to be worn to do the job that one modern plate carrier does.  
---
As such, there are two vests in play here.  
---
There is an older-style flat surfaced ballistic vest with a groin, and there is a modern, non-plate-carrier type MOLLE vest being worn over the ballistic vest.   
---
The ballistic vest  is being worn for obvious reasons. Think almost 70's vietnam flak vests, but not quite and obviously not all tiger striped up. This is what most agencies around the world are still using or have just recently gotten rid of in favour of more modern systems. ([This](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT3-EuAq1YfPbeT8p6r7cJRPCSja9hgjXfl6Ygy1Par0PQ9T2EC) is an example)  
---
The external vest is a non-plate-carrier type vest that is fully webbed in MOLLE so that the use can configure the pouches and features of the vest to their liking with modern attachments such as magazine pouches, medical/radio-comms pouches, ect. This vest offers no ballistic protection, only user comfort. ([This](https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g7-M00-67-80-rBVaSluGGHCAGKQnAAKJmWm1rrM549.jpg/outdoor-durable-molle-tactical-vest-900d.jpg) is an example.)   
---
Hope this helps.
---
Or you could, ya know, play with 4 friends?
---
Definitely Yorkshire, similar to mine and i'm from Leeds
---
Because he is in his own home? He was probably doing paperwork when Dokk showed up. I work in business and you'd be crazy to think if I was gonna wear my full suit and tie if I was working from home.
---
Capitao's next buff
---
I wouldn‚Äôt think that much if they just got the original actors and a studio to help produce 
---
Now this is the type of stuff that needs more posting 
---
What? I thought that was his son. I guess I read wrong.
---
Plus mosquitos are annoying and Mozzie looks annoying lmao
---
The trailer basically confirms Denmark, Mexico, Peru, an eastern African country (can't tell if it's Kenya or Tanzania), Belgium (? again, hard to tell with the pin), and India as potential future CTUs
---
If you‚Äôre genuinely solo queuing in ranked you needn‚Äôt be surprised
---
Ubisoft did  mention that  they want  to be more active when  it  coems  to  the  characters and lore, guess   w e're   starting to see the  effects   of this resolution  now. There's to  hope that this  leads to story  missions  similar to Article 5  or  Outbreak.
---
I've heard it both ways. 
---
I do agree with you but yeah, ubisoft really doesnt care
---
Even if they  have cheaped out, truth  be told,  I like Harry better.  I'm  looking forward  to see what  they're  going  to  do  with  him.
---
Maestro is always good on any site. Mira is only good on certain sites, but those that‚Äôs she is good she is insanely good. It also comes down to personal preference, I hate being on cams so much, so I never play Maestro. But I‚Äôd still argue he‚Äôs a top 5 operator.
---
Do you play mostly ranked or casual? 
---
If ranked, I say Mira, because you can know what site you‚Äôll be on and if she‚Äôll be useful or not. 
---
If casual (and like his play style) get Maestro, because he‚Äôs great everywhere and has the best gun on defense. IMO 
---
In the very end scene.
---
'She left some very big shoes to fill didn't she'
---
Unless the banning is all done simultaneously and any overlaps are wasted
---
{-}7
---
Lol this man is gonna try this
---
Why do you have a water pistol 
---
Wouldn't it have made more sense if instead of insisting Dokkeabi calling him Harry, he said "Call me John". 
---
More of this please
---
I would kill for a TV show. The characters are *so* well thought out and I don‚Äôt think a shooter campaign would do them justice.
---
I can't seem to get the right mouse sense, I set everything to lowest mouse sense possible, but it's sensitive as fk, it's even worse when I play at modern day resolution 1920x1080. Playing at old resolution only helps a bit.
---
Whatever makes you comfortable is best. If you have a 5 button mouse you can put the lean keys (default Q &amp; E) to the buttons on the side. A lot of people do that, and put ‚ÄúE‚Äù for your primary gadget - as it makes throwing grenades easier. 
---
Danish flag sighted, Danish operators confirmed.   
---
But where the HECK is mah SWEDEN!? &gt;:( 
---
Honestly, an arrow would be worse than a bullet. Pulling it out would hurt like hell and if it's serrated, pulling it out would do much more damage than leaving it in.
---
Who needs ops when you can just have taco
---
Saaame
---
Finisht it my dudes
---
Dead meme. Devs are normies.
---
Because daddy told me not to play with daddys guns \*Squirts you with a watergun\*
---
Should've been John Clark, especially when you consider Micheal B Jordan upcoming movie Without Remorse. 
---
Theres an amazing drone hole on commander‚Äôs office which is really easy to get kills through it
---
Who is Six? Is he the leader of the rainbow team?
---
Honestly being able to crack open doors would be great. Would also give environmental tracking even more options if all doors start off closed. 
---
But with F you can pay respect to the opened or destroyed door.
---
Well that's just a flat out lie.
---
its a joke. its just taking a bit of piss at new players to the game.
---
I personally hate the middle mouse click, except that, the default bindings are ok
---
How hard is it to see the screen?
---
Thanks!
---
Press F for chanka rework
---
It‚Äôs really up to you with what feels most comfortable. I‚Äôd suggest loading up a T hunt and playing to see how the standard controls work. Then, if you feel like a certain key for a certain action needs to be easier to access, you can start moving bindings around. That may not help much, but that‚Äôs what I did when I switched. And I use those same bindings in every similar game for consistency. 
---
FUCKING IRENE
---
C7E if you‚Äôre going to be longer range engagements. Pdw is a beast for a faster attack strat and closer up. 
---
That sounds like something that the Joker would say to Harley Quinn 
---
PC has far less team killing and VTKing. Especially VTKing. I have been TK'd my fair share but its not too common. Most of the times Ive been TKd is either by accident or me and my friends fucking around. Im just about at 500 hours minus maybe an hour or two. Its just the age difference. Everybody I ever hear talk in the game is either an adult or damn close. Still some shit heads obviously but they *usually* keep the shitty behavior to the voice and text chat.
---
Sounds like you're the problem mate. Get the headshots yourself
---
As ridiculous  and unrealistic as it'd be, after the Far  Cry   games, gameplay-wise  I'd absolutely love a compound   bow operator.
---
i hope
---
Not on Siege directly, but Paramount is releasing *Without Remorse* which is an origin story for Rainbows original leader John Clark. 
---
And Harry has the For Honor helmets in his office right?
---
Who?
---
Phat
---
That reveal made me so happy!
---
Perhaps its actually cav using her outfit
---
They  did sort  of  bring   them  back, they'rejust not in-game  any  more.
---
Yea it‚Äôs cav, you can see the makeup
---
Idk, i hope its a seasonal skin, that would be dope
---

At 2:20 he is hammering a screw... 
---
I think we should get those as a headgear and uniform. Be nice to see more no mask thatcher without having the elite. We have the si one but I want more 
---
See I pulled a sneaky one on ya

Rated M for mature means the company / publisher cannot take responsibility.. Basically it's an Anti-Sue measure against parents who don't like violence.  
---
Officially it's just a recommendation, so anyone can buy it.
---
I never knew I wanted this until now 
---
As an Australian with Greek heritage it would be so sweet to get them both in the game this year, maybe asking for too much though haha.
---
but 120 is better than 75
---
I asked the same thing and lost 100 something karma lol
---
What downed you?  2 shot from that range scares me
---
Maybe I'm dumb but why do they stay in cages?
---
tOmMoRo!!!
---
How did you get so high up tower? Drone?
---
Foreign legion?
---
no
---
Imagine a scene like in black ops 2 where you shoot a ‚Äòtarget‚Äô with a mask on his head and then it turns out to be fucking thermite or some other operator from rainbow
---
Or for example two ops are abducted by the enemy forces, BUT you can only save one (depending on your choices)
---
That would make some really fucking powerful scenes
---
Minus a few weird and awkward parts, it was pretty darn fun to watch
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs illegal for anyone under 18 to buy a rated M game.
---
May I suggest another?
---
ClashBanditkute
---
Clash+Bandit+Kaid+Mute
---
I kinda wish it was marked as a spoiler. I love keeping the faces of operators a mystery. Up until elite sets obviously 
---
Looks like they changed their handle in the last two weeks.
---
We need more scruffy fisherman
---
Again, how does that make him not canon? He is canon now.
---
Rainbow Harry sounds like a prominent member of the bear community in San Francisco 
---
I'll have you know that they got the colours of the English flag wrong.
---
Not really, we're probably getting some Danes.
---
Looks like we need a new sub. Who's down for moderating /r/RainbowHarry
---
Not angry just really fucking dissapointed in this game.
---
Fine.
---
&gt;Tachanka's sense of humor, Ash's strong leadership, Doc's reason to be a doctor; to save, Thermite's fascination with explosives, etc.

* A dude with a sense of humour?
---
* A woman with leadership qualities?
---
* A doctor wanting to save lives?

* A dude who specialises in blowing shit up... Likes blowing shit up?
---
How fucking groundbreaking, oh yeah, Chimera brought sooooooooooooo much character, I really know the characters now having watched it. 
---
&gt;  Dokkaebi likes to whine, and Thatcher "faces" his demons by betting up people who his brother owes. 
---
* Dokkaebi feels horribly undervalued and underappreciated, also likes to whine.
---
* Thatcher is defensive and protective. Also very harsh and blunt.
---
How fucking groundbreaking. I reaaaally feel like I... Wait... I've already done this speel. It's almost like neither cinematics give you a deep understanding of the characters that you claim Chimera gave huh?
---
As for the Bartlett one. All that really tells you is:
---
* White masks = bad
---
* CTU = good.
---
So really I'm 3 for 3 in ruing every cinematics so-called "character development".
---
It's not exactly a difficult task when you actively try. 
---
It's a fun cinematic... They all show a little bit of character but in reality, it's not much from either. Frankly, I don't see why that's a bad thing. If you're playing R6S for the character, I think you're in the wrong place my guy.
---
I rewatched it and im now 99% sure it is valks basic helmet. If you need to watch after the fight scene and you get a little closer look
---
Plus the explosives sign in Japanese on the locker door.
---
I love this! Please more Ubi! After playing as these characters for 3 years I've grown way too attached and would love some more characterization for all of them. I really hope Ubi releases more ‚ù§

An M-rated game is like an R-rated movie: there's no law requiring minors be forbidden to buy a copy/ticket‚Äîand in fact laws of this sort have been struck down as unconstitutional‚Äîbut game stores/movie theaters voluntarily prevent minors from purchasing material meant for adults, since parents might boycott their businesses otherwise, or find creative ways to regulate them anyway.
---
Because it's not actually illegal, businesses can make exceptions to their policies if they want. For instance, when a controversial documentary about Edward Snowden was given an R rating, some theaters allowed teenagers to buy tickets anyway:

Wait ... Thatcher didn't check his corner lol ...
---
What if there is a guy camping behind the door lol
---
Someone else here mentioned its probably Hibana's bow for kyudo
---
gonna go full sicko mode and say nah
---
kill me
---
I say whole team
---
I would a Nora rengo op. They might be my new favorite team after what I saw at the invitational. 
---
An ace is 5 kills. If it's anything else it's a 4K, 3K, 2K or just a frag.
---

---
Which video were you watching? None of that is right 
---
When I saw "The Hammer" I automatically assumed it would be about the guy with the hammer.
---
People also say house is on Los Angeles and bank is disputed because you can‚Äôt really know. The plane could be anywhere really. 
---
5 kills on the opposite team. A 4K and a team kill doesn‚Äôt count
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
This makes me want a story/campaign even more.
---
It wasn't meant to be at all and was never designed that way until ubisoft's wallets dried up and decided to make it Rainbow Colour Dash Six: Siege
---
Invest in headphones. Otherwise good job
---
IDK, they look different. The one in the picture definitely looks like a nail. I for one choose to believe he's hammering a screw. Because it's funnier and life is more fun that way. 
---
They will tomorrow 
---
I never understood these stupid charm events. I literally had the stream on the whole during the paris event I only got Gold. SOme of my favorite charms in the game. I wish they literally sold them. I get fucking shafted because twitches stupid all detection system. I had the stream up the whole time for the brazil one and I only got Silver. I can't wait seeing as I've watched every second of being up and have literally none of the fucking charms. I wish we could just buy them or anything. I don't want to watch this event. 
---
the whole enemy team 5 kills
---
I'd love that but I think it's because unlike G2 and EG they aren't mainstream and are only an APAC team.
---
I used my drone!
---
Yeah but Dokkaebi when she was in that outfit with Harry (Six) she was hella cute 
---
[excitedibillis]
---
Man this makes me want an actual Rainbow Six Single Player Campaign
---
This is way better than the one they had for clash! That one looked like a mobile app lol.

Hello RAINBOW-SIX-ARCHIVES, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/areqif/rsd_model_1_src/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Ace = 5 enemy kills by 1 operator in 1 round. 
---
...If you kill 5 people... You killed the whole enemy team anyways. Guess I don't get the question. 
---
This was so fucking cool
---
Most definitely. Can't say I noticed any awkward moments, if you mean when pengu got emotional? Then im glad that happened, we may be adults but men should be allowed to share their feelings in any way they wish and I respect him a lot more now than I did to be quite honest!
---
So how does he know there will probably be danish and greek ops?
---
I got into FPS's cuz my dad played that all the time when I was a kid. I was never allowed to play because "it was too violent", but I'm fairly certain he just didn't want me to fuck up his K/D.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought was the teaser.
---
Yes, yes, and yes again
---
I hope Ubisoft and Netflix get together and do an animated Tom Clancy series, I would watch it. 
---
Jeez take a break mate and relax this is for entertainment
