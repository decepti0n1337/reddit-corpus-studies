My entire point was that the Bearing-9 and SMG-12 and very much usable at close range. Either learn to use them or don't use them.
---
Alright thanks
---
I don’t know, it just happened
---
I clicked it. I hate it even more. I'm stuck having to die/lose 3+ rounds straight sometimes.
---
This if from the Fuze x AK-12 from girls frontline hentai doujin, eh?
---
Probably not, I mean Montagne means mountain so you could see if there is something like that. Nøkk is trickier because of the ø in her name, looking up how to pronounce ø/ö would help. Most players just say Nook (as in nook and cranny).  If you have any specific questions I could try my best to give you an answer.

Mira more like Milf

I mean could’ve been a recording and OP didn’t feel like posting it on pc for whatever reason, it’s unlikely but I was just stating possibilities
---
This was happening to me today lmao. Thought it was my shit being broken by ubisoft.
---
just saying that that shottie with dragons breath, which can do damage over time would be annoying to go up against or even a lever action rifle would do him good.
---
It’s (in my opinion) the number one problem in all platforms. I know it’s sucks, but there’s nothing Ubi can really do Without also aiding them.
---
It's the latino mom of 7 kids whose main weapon is a flip flop
---
played with a 3-stack yesterday. They took turns to tk the remaining to players (me and another random). We lost that round. Obviously. The next round i get the same 3 people in my team again. Their excuse for teamkilling was: "It's just a fun little challenge".

So yeah. That's my casual experience

Yeah, I was mainly looking at the complete lack of recoil on the shot more than his movements; he's got typical high sens mobility but even the best console recoil control has *some* kick, and dude had literally none.
---
But I'm just Plat 2, I know at the higher end people are just nsane.

But maybe

EVEN BETTER THAN A CAR!

Based on jow they've managed previous events...One and done. Doubt that they bring it back.

Yes

Just cue for ranked you'll be put back in yours.

FUCK OFF JOJO! LEAVE ME ALONE WITH YOUR STUPID FUCKING FANDOM

Does nøkk even have a silent step type ability or is just cause you have to walk to not make noise
---
Personally I have the in game sens at 17 and my mouse dpi at 600.  I know it’s not much but you could try it out and see how you like it and make some adjustments with it.
---
Honestly I learned to never use a drone if there is an entry fight about to happen.

Then thy probably care more than the majority of players.
---
Never cross 800. As you are new, you need to experiment and find your sweet spot, so start at 800 and vary your in game. Ideally, the entire length of travel of your mouse on your mouse pad should show up as 360° rotation of your character, but that too varies with person.
---
But NEVER go wrist. You'll only damage your wrist muscles and induce carpel tunnel syndrome.
---
Most use around 400, and 8-12 in-game. It takes quite a while to move from quick and easy wrist to long and slow arm, but the returns are worth it.
---
i've seen higher. try better bud

Used to main Echo before pick&amp;ban

There's no reason to ban cav at all.

G36 for the acog

alright awesome finnaly someone who actually answers me instead of just saying "YoU sHoUlD bE bAnNeD aNyWaY" and yeah same i done it like 15-20 times trought 2 casual games but i never actualy crashed the game i just lagged it technically but as i said it was only casual which doesnt excuse me but it does make it less worse because i was messing about with it but i wasnt using it for a competitive advantage
---
LOL alright buddy
---
Ela shot gun is so good.  There are so many times I've gotten out of 1v2s,3s,4s and 5s because of it. It's a shot gun so the range is limited but it's shreds at farther ranges than you might think.  I feel like the scorpion gets a little better each season. Not sure about that though. Doki I use for hunting roamers and when we are about to push site.  The calls also help  if you are solo droning or solo queue. As with all global ops they are very strong with a coordinated team.
---
get a mouse and keyboard then
---
what?

Exactly. The mode isn’t exciting enough and the skin isn’t good enough for people to try to do this by playing.
---
Probably because it's full of scuff superstars crouch spamming and sweating. You either can't hit their lagging head, or you play a few matches and have to get away from the cancer.
---
Not really, no, but I still wouldn't prefer a floor specific drone as it would make his scan more effective and more precise than he is nwk.
---
Did they add two more days to the event? I feel like I had seen it say 4 days and whatever hours left on Wednesday. When I hopped on early this morning it said 6 days left. We all need to start farming headshots!
---
thanks
---
Found the M+KB user.
---
man, it’s casual, no one should really give a shit what goes on in there, it’s a good way to find exploits for devs to fix and a good way to practice the game
---
the people calling you out for doing it are just being plain stupid and not reading your post
---
like hell, if you did it in ranked i would say “hope you get banned” bc that’s a competitive game mode and you should try and play that legit
---
Not with headshots at least, kills in general would have been a lot closer by now, surely.
---
But now found that Mira and Frost work wonders

Lol

Well if you run the more you show up on cams

Thanks, sorry

restarting the game completely maybe
---
Ah a man has moved on, I can respect that
---
Had this happen to me today
---
ikr it’s far beyond our capabilities if it was 30 headshots or 50 for each player would’ve make sense
---
But still can't take Echo once in a blue moon when it is not banned. Someone always take it first.

I have wanted this uniform forever, I get black ice more than any of the cool skin I want. Not complaining but still
---
Honestly this problem your showing here, just how toxic the player base is, is what caused me to lose most of my interest in the game.
---
My point is that while I say I am “disappointed” I use an emoji to add some sarcasm. It seems you have a very different type of humour compared to me.

That guy should be very proud of his 4k

Nostalgia is LYING to you.
---
Look, sometimes people get upset when they spectate a teammate and they witness some awful gameplay. They get frustrated and take it out on you, the person they were spectating.
---
You being in denial about being trash at the game won't make things better. If you are honest and genuine about it, things will be way better. Just tell them you know you are bad and you are working to improve yourself. They will be way less toxic if you tell them that.
---
I love how you're trying to talk down to me like I couldn't possible be running games at 144fps. I can and I am little boy.
---
let me give you another reason I'd never go back to console.....playing an fps on a controller.
---
3===D
---
Yea but I’m just saying it doesn’t make sense
---
U dont want them to be better?
---
are you high? I easily get 200fps in r6 its not a hard game to run.
---
I assume in ps4? I'm on xbox lol
---
Yeah
---
Its a feature
---
Thanks bro I really appreciate it. I’ll take your advice and put it into practice.
---
You can’t adjust mic level on Xbox?
---
Imagine John Wick pulling up on you :O
---
And they fell weird to me also. And you should get a PS4 just for Spooderman and god of war
---
You mean other than an amazing band?
---
Old Hereford was my least favorite map after plane. No thank you. And acogs are overrated. If they do anything with acogs it should be all or nothing, and by all I mean every single weapon including sidearms.
---
I might be oblivious but as far as I know, no. You might be able to but i never struggle with loud mics
---
i'd rather see a tachanka rework than this
---
I’m dead
---
&gt; Misleading Title
---
🤣
---
You arent getting those frames. Lol. You people are retarded. You are capped at the games max. You could open Doom and it would say you are getting 200fps.
---
I didnt day it was hard to run. I was saying that the fos you see is what your PC is processing it at even though the game itself is capped. Lol
---
I do if I wanna have max volume so I can hear maverick
---
Shes mysterio now, deal with it.
---
they should just enable kbm for everyone on console
---
*Laughs in Caveria*
---
Then Sony releases PS5 next year, and you’re sat there pondering your decisions
---
Rating system for determining player rank.
---
"The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor."
---
Each life obtained
---
If your PC said you were getting 1000 fps you still arent getting that. Lol.
---
I run max game sound, lower chat volume (I have this little adapter thing with buttons, none of which change my mics volume) and I have mic monitoring so I can hear if I'm being loud
---
so what? that means he's plat 1/2 in skill then but not diamond? lol he's still beating the crap outta gold 1/plat 3's it seems
---
this is so satisfying to watch
---
Really.....
---
Don't worry, just keep your spirit up and never let down. Cheers mate.
---
I actually had no idea about that, thank you!
---
Pisses me off so much. Had a bandit that would purposefully break them with electrified barbed wire. Killed him and his buddy killed me.
---
restart the game before posting
---
Yeah yet no one answered including you
---
It would be beautiful
---
Same same, there was once I was busy with something during a ranked match and I was constantly AFK for 15 seconds during prep phase. 15 seconds. And my whole team blamed our loss (4-1) on me, just because I was afk for 15 seconds in prep phase. Idiots like them ruin my R6 experience.
---
On what platform has 7 mil?
---
Thanks
---
Don’t spend more than 2 hours on the game though. I don’t know how long it’ll take for you to be unable to refund it I think like a week?
---
Yeah that's not how it works at all buddy. If you have a 144 hz monitor and your pc is getting 144 fps you are seeing 144 fps.
---
People suck.
---
Give her another trap maybe two.
---
I was like wut 200fps? If the monitor is compatible with that It will be interpolating the frames which means there would be a lot of innacurate frames and artifacts on screen. As far as i know games are still made for 24-30-60 fps targets. Inly VR games actually hit 144 I don't even think our eyes would notice the difference above 144. Heck I've been out of the pc games so long i didn't even notice 144hz was the standard for good monitors now. It was only like 4 years ago everyone was saying there's no need to go above 60. I missed the whole freesync craze still don't quite understand the technology but i get what it does. Im still happy at 1080p 60 on my old ass pc or 4k checkerboarding on console. I wish they would do a pro and x patch for console for siege though. Looks like theyre going to 'remaster' it for next gen
---
Nokk :

#Am i a joke to you ?

How about the korean smgs?

Nah, this is inaccurate. What actually happens is I go into a psychotic bloody lust and murder the people who shot my babies and then see a "you are banned" message.
---
Yes very
---
I mean if I saw a 300lb beast of a woman towering over me like that id shit myself
---
Very much joke
---
Some people don’t belong on siege. The guy your describing is one of them
---
&gt; You being in denial about being trash at the game won't make things better.  
---
Ohhh, I get it. You're one of the toxic people. No matter how fucking good somebody does, as long as they're a certain rank, you'll call them trash. Double ace-clutch to win the game? Pfffft, you're still trash, sweating in casual.
---
Fuze a teammate in the last round, also killing two enemies? Yeah you TK'ed me though, I was going to rush in and frag out (without any callout whaztsoever). 10-2 overall for that match, it doesn't matter, though, you TK'ed me, an S2 who went 2-4!
---
With the way that you're arguing this perspective, I doubt you've even read the post in its entirety. You saw the first line and decided that this was the best move for you to make, even though you're seriously talking out of your own ass.
---
Can't even quote me right
---
ps4, is it deferent in pc and xbox?
---
bro why does she look like a 40 year mom
---
Yup, people who use mouse and keyboard on console are in fact the biggest pussies.
---
Console lol
---
Then request something better my dude . Giving Dokkaebi an FMG would make things worse
---
Except then the only used weapon would be smg 11 or c75 at least mk 14 and bosg pack a punch
---
Do you want me to ban you in real life too?
---
PC is 6 million and I assume Xbox is the 5.5 million I've seen.
---
It is a comparison about the games. If using a Controller on PC in For Honor is not cheating, why should using M+KB in Rainbow 6 on console be cheating? For each respective type of game a different input device has an advantage over the other. In For Honor that's a controller, in R6 it's M+KB. If you want one to be cheating, the other needs to be cheating too.
---
Furthermore according to your argument having 7.1 Headphones would also be P2W. After all Stereo is cheaper but worse. A better Monitor is cheating too then. Better graphics card on PC with more frames? Cheating. Buying a PS4 Pro instead of the normal one? Also cheating. You are seriously stretching the definition. If you want it to be cheating, you need to be able to make it a general rule. With your current arguments that is simply not possible as they have a lot of holes.
---
And obviously you can't compete with them, because M+KB is the definite input device for shooters. That's not point of the debate. That doesn't make its users cheaters. You just want to use an ill suited input device and stick with it. But as I said: That is your personal choice. And you get upset about it because your choice is not the best. But it's you who needs to adapt here. You would need to answer the question why you should be entitled to use a controller so much, that everybody else should be forced to adapt to your choices instead of you adapting to the situation which is problematic or annoying to you.
---
I will also simply ignore everything you are saying which has no part in this argument. Meaning you trying to discredit and attack me personally instead of trying to find a point for your argument or against my argument.
---
They dont miss for me, if they did, I would probably get them. I dont want anyone thinking that I never kill Blitz though, it's only when I am saving a teammate or today on yacht, shot up the ladder by the command room. Its just when hes coming head on that I really have trouble.
---
Using MnK on console is blatant cheating. There is no argument against it so stop attempting to make one. I’m honestly shocked that people can’t understand that it’s cheating.
---
You have never played on PC, do you?

You can’t deny the fire rate of the FMG-9

Maybe hes plat 1 level, and hes playing with golds so he can get higher in diamond. Also he uses a cronus
---
I can't wait for sau_siege to stop making these
---
Yeah I do too, you can't always plan how your going to kill him and nerfing him wont help either. Either you luck out and kill him or ya die. That's that.
---
Dude, I'm just trying to help here. Put your ego aside and just be the better person. Instead of getting tilted because your ego is bruised when someone calls you noob, you could just be humble. Recognize what you did wrong and strive to do better.

MnK on Console: FUCK YOU CUNT CHEATER

Does have a point matchmaking is shit. I would rather make these people have to play higher competition no matter what. We know exactly why they are playing with a bronze.
---
I know but still she looks creepy
---
Doesn’t really mean much when it depends on DPI as well.
---
I replied before you edited, went back and saw it.  I never claimed to know more, i never said i knew legal definitions, i called you out for talking urban definitions when we were talking about an account ban, i never said i was more civil, i said you were being uncivil, critique isn't the same as selfgloryfication. You can't seem to understand you're being critiqued, are you that stuck up?
---
First time you know ?
---
I would prefer PC over my damn console any day. But right now PC is a ELO mess. So many cheaters and people that have worked hard for their rank getting ELO taken away. Sometimes I lays off for people like this guy but it fucks others pretty hard.
---
Run up to her and knife her shield if it’s a 1v1. Grenades if you can’t run in. Flashbangs work well too as she can’t run with her shield. Thatcher disables the shield. Running up to her is the best way to deal with her as long as no other enemy is going to kill you
---
Ok so you said getting killed by a key and mouse on console is like getting killed by a hacker on PC. Yea fair enough. Before this you said that we should just get a key and mouse to use on console.  So in turn you are saying that people should hack back

Oh, I know. Fortunately we have 3 of them right now. The thing that really pisses me off though is that Warden doesn't have the 5.7, even though that is the standard handgun we give to our secret service.
---
When i use Ela, her recoil is manageable but if it really is hard, slap on a laser and hipfire. The strong verticle kick means that it will fly straight up into a headshot making her a nightmare.
---
Here I’ll make it really simple for you, look at the kill cam, see where the end of the right side of the visor ends.  Hint: it’s the wall

Better chance of getting Alpha Packs in ranked due to higher % every time you don't get an AP compared to casual, but modes make no difference as to the rewards in the packs.

[Big Thonk 🤔](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333)
---
**Soviet famine of 1932–33**
---
The Soviet famine of 1932–33 was a major famine that killed millions of people in the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union, including Ukraine, Northern Caucasus, Volga Region and Kazakhstan, the South Urals, and West Siberia. The Holodomor in Ukraine and Kazakh famine of 1932–33 have been seen as genocide committed by Joseph Stalin's government; it is estimated between 3.3 and 7.5 million died in Ukraine and ~2,000,000 (40% of all Kazakhs) died in Kazakhstan.Between 2.4 and 4 million ethnic Ukrainians are estimated to have perished as a result of the famine. The exact number of deaths is hard to determine due to a lack of records, but the number increases significantly when the deaths in the heavily Ukrainian-populated Kuban region are included. Older estimates are still often cited in political commentary, According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kiev in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficit.Stalin and other party members had ordered that kulaks were "to be liquidated as a class"  and so they became a target for the state.

Ah the days when she had impacts

That’s how I learned he can only have 9 out at a time
---
Lol, why do you say that? He looks epic.
---
Flash hider makes it so your aim comes back down faster after shooting, so it helps with burst fire only
---
Muzzle brake helps with single shot fire, so the first shot of every burst or fire will have reduced recoil
---
Compensator reduces recoil overall
---
The f2 used to have a very big second shot recoil but that has been reduced but overall larger horizontal recoil. So your best choice is full auto fire and controlling the recoil after the initial first 2 shots or burst firing your weapon. So either flash hider or compensator, don’t use the muzzle brake
---
Is this possible?

All you have to do is just click the "Text" option on the very right whenever you make a post.

Once you hit around 4000 ELO console siege is absolutely fucking aids. I just intentionally stay in low plat 2/plat 3 because it's so unenjoyable otherwise.

He also doesn’t have the p90 which is also standard issue for the Secret service, I’m so upset with Ubisoft &gt;:(

I wanted him to be better now I’m hear they are nerfing him, poor little guy needs a buff so bad. 
---
His gadget is a good idea but they messed up hoe it should be to make him fun or useable and I personally dislike the MPX and believe he should have a stronger weapon and it not at lest give that weak weapon a Acog, he’s a 3 armor slow boy.

I miss the old hibana

But I can't afford a pc

Im on the next round if it happens again, its gotta be more than a visual glitch

Well it's pretty much like hacks on PC, everyone can buy them to get an advantage but that's not the point in PC. So the same could be said with consoles as you are using a third-party adapter to play with a third-party m&amp;k. And you can't really compare headphones to m&amp;k as headphones wouldn't get you out of your rank
---
I don't think it's just PS4, I think that's the whole rainbow community collectively not being good enough
---
Deus Vult time
---
Lol golds
---
And queue
---
Headphones plug into and are designed to be compatible with the console, MNK, except for on certain games that have allowed it (fortnite, warframe, etc) requires a special adapter that tricks the console into thinking MNK outputs are through the controller, MNK is infinitely easier to aim with (for someone experienced with it) and Ubisoft has openly stated that MNK is cheating. If the developers were ok with MNK they have the means to do so, and in a way that is fair for everyone (like how fortnite has done it, with special servers). Good headphones are an advantage, but nowhere near as much as the higher level MNK can perform at, and do not require special hardware that deceives the console.
---
I mean it's an official Sony licensed controller, produced and sold by Hori. So technically it is an official ps4 m/kb "controller".
---
Vigil and boring should not be in the same sentence my dude. You must not know the thrill of hitting a headshot with the BOSG or flanking to get a 3k with a car(Kia haha). If nothing else you’re playing Korean Batman, that in itself should be enough 😂
---

No you don't

Too bad Ukraine and other Territories under the, you guessed it, Soviet Union, starved.
---
I wish I could play with you too thank you.
---
You are probably the chillest person I have met on reddit
---
Bruh in order for an adapter to even work you need a controller AND mnk plugged in. They can just move their hand over to the controller
---
It’s suppose to but when you get someone with copper 4 on your team it uses theirs. It’s a glitch
---
I did know you need an adapter, but the Hori comes with said adapter to my knowledge. Just did some preliminary research and it looks like that is in fact the case. Also, I wasn't complaining. I was just pointing out that Sony officially licenses the controller.
---
Or 5 of the custom AR-15 I built myself that has good quality 2.5x32 prism scope that has the same reticle as an ACOG but only costs $200.
---
Yes I know.
---
Ok I know this but technically couldn’t pro controllers with the paddles on hair triggers be considered cheating?  They do offer an advantage especially the triggers.  We all know modded controllers are cheating, but what about pro controllers or those analog sticks that are better and allow for more precise aiming?  Where do we draw the line?
---
It isn’t tho
---
And yet you can’t afford a proper pc
---
I feel like the set goal limit was stupid high
---
I think this could qualify for a meme
---
Oh damn, 2 more than that guy, I bet you feel pretty good about yourself. I have a friend who got 32 kills in a ranked game before
---
So little effort in this season
---

Congrats on the communism
---
Yeah people can be dicks on reddit. Not all people are bad tho. Keep up the good work and have fun. Don’t let anyone discourage you. Always try to be the best you can to everyone. You never know what they are going through.
---
Did you think maybe that people have **preferences and that they just prefer to play on console?
---
Lol gold
---
Why
---
Yeah you are right thanks again for bein a nice person. Maybe someday we will get to play rainbow with each other
---
No I play on PC and I still think you’re an idiot

Ah so they still have it limited

I look forward to it. Have fun!
---
I don't have discord otherwise I'd totally chat with you. Also, if I had known you were a PC player my advice would be totally different. I play on Xbox where gun skills DO indeed win the majority of matches, but I hear on PC it's totally different.
---
Some suggestions I have: if you like to play aggressive, play aggresively in a smart way. If you're trying to get a spawnpeek off, do it in a way the other team won't expect. I saw a video the other day of a pro league player who did a double angle on a common spawn and the attackers didn't know what hit them. Aggressive gunfights require you to be unconventional in your mannerisms. If your opponent is expecting one thing, surprise them by changing up your stance or positioning.
---
FPS does impact your gameplay largely. From my limited knowledge of PC gaming, having below 60 fps severely impacts you because the lag makes it harder to be precise in your aim and movements are thrown off. I don't quite know how to fix that other than buying a better PC/parts, as I said im not the best with PC play.
---
I wish you the best of luck and feel free to PM me if you need more advice!
---
Because m&amp;k is a ridiculous advantage that shouldn't be allowed on console. If you use m&amp;k, you need to play on PC servers and play against people on an equal playing field.
---
One taps are the most satisfying kill you'll ever get in ranked. Having people stand still because they can't shoot me is all the better
---
I stopped playing competitively on my PC for just less than a year. When I came back, every game was unplayable because the sensitivity was sooooooo high. So I lowered it to a tolerable level. Less than a week later I was thinking “how can I possibly play with sensitivity so low”and had it cranked back up again. 
---
I felt like an absolute noob for a few days, then I was losing because my sensitivity was so low, then I started losing because the game started matching me with players of a similar skill level.
---
"why are we even here, just to suffer?"
---
It goes down when you keep playing a ton of games. So unless it was like from 50 elo to like 20 elo in the next game idk
---
Gridlock might need a snack
---
lmao rad!
---
er... I mean.  uh, boooo
---
Maybe...
---
I believe that falls on Sony/Microsoft because it’s a software thing, that being said the companies that make these adapters will just continue to find ways around it. This leads to an expensive back and forth, the players that want the adapters are still going to buy them even if they get pricier.
---
Yes i too pull out my gun in the middle of school and start eliminating my fellow classmates one year one
---
It’s like 1.6 out of 7 on ps4 after friday night, ain’t lookin good, also it’s hard as fuck to get hs’s here, more luck than anything
---
How do you receive these I have checked my email several times for them but still don't see them, do you have to sign up for them?
---
Well on PC the best device I can get right now is hacks so it's only fair if I use them cuz they're "the best device" i can get. Do you realize how stupid your comment is?
---
The thing is that I'm fairly certain the Xbox doesn't recognize it as M&amp;K. Like, the whole point of the adapter is to tell the Xbox "hey, I'm a controller."
---
It's not new, it's an old flame.
---
Couldnt they just sue the company?
---
I think that when given the weapons we have with no sights, headshots are a rarity
---
I was honestly expecting a nitro cell throw off of the top windows at the end
---
It kinda was like that
---
Only on console lmao.
---
So take a break
---
I know, they're just defensive and don't want to realize how dumbed down the meta is on console. Ask anyone, hell just watch a pc pro match and look at the ability to play. Console is limited by imprecise thumbsticks. It makes for slower and less pinpoint gameplay.
---
It's objectively like this.
---
Hewwo! UwU
---
I have 2 proper PCs.
---
I would say no. She looks conniving and judgemental. Like someone who would have no qualms using a one way mirror to spy on people.
---
Potentially but it doesn’t mean they would win. The adapter just tricks the consoles it doesn’t actually alter the equipment so Idk what they would sue for.
---
A 12 y/o with an aimbot would get cooked by Shroud any day of the week first of all. Second of all, its borderline impossible to beat a mouse with a thumbstick. The extra precision you get is immense, and no anyone with even just a few dozen hours on m&amp;k would destroy pretty much anyone in an aim off against someone on a controller. I'm not saying its the exact same thing, I'm saying its the same leap over. A controller to m&amp;k is the same distance as an m&amp;k to an aimbot, not that an m&amp;k is on the same level as an aimbot. You can beat both an aimbot on PC and an m&amp;k on a controller, but the relative distance to climb is the same.
---
Im broke
---
Why are they peasants?

---
Just their hopes. I bet this number was achieved last week but now people don't care as much for the event.
---
Could be one of Vigil/Dokkebae's secondary SMGs. Can you see the weapons in the Operator unlock screen and match it up?
---
I like the second suggestion. But nullifying team damage while in prep will make killing drones a lot less complicated.
---
I was 1-9 in placement with a 1.5 kd. My teams were awful. Plus, every game I was about to win we got ddosed.
---
Mouse and keyboard on console is literally cheating because you can have better aim and recoil control. If you continue this up and tell people that you will play ranked and get tk’d. STOP now or pay the prices
---
For hacking the software maybe? Surely thats not legal? But im not sure how that exactly works
---
I shoot the cav and my teammate it's a 2 for 1
---
Aside from me (Zof) or my friend (Alibi) i have seen less than 3 of each in the past month and a half
---
LOL
---
Because PC is master race.
---
I do agree the whole squad getting rev.ff would be an excellent fix
---
some of us came back most were shot down but we got the alien armor hell yeah
---
yeah
---
shut
---
And call it toxic Rush?
---
Is it cheating if Sony officially licenses the mouse and keyboard set up?
---
https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/accessories/specialty-controllers/
---
Under Keyboards. It's an official Playstation product.
---
I think it's a dick move to use it, but I don't know if I'd call it cheating if Sony endorses it.
---
Edit: the Hori does NOT require a Xim adapter or any other third party adapter, and it WILL work on games that don't allow M+K.
---
https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2016/11/21/hori-tac-pro-ps4-mouse-and-keyboard-review-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/#6e6c687748e7
---
So again, since it's officially licensed, either Sony endorses cheating or it's not cheating.
---
It doesn't tho
---
Feels bad recruit main. No recruit in ranked
---
Just curious, are you aware of what an aimbot does?
---
Man, imagine being this pathetic lmao
---
With the Hori, which is the controller I linked, you don't need an extra adapter to my knowledge. Games will stop someone from using a regular M+K, but not from using the Hori.
---
Source: first paragraph on this review
---
If Ubisoft classifies it as cheating, great, I'm glad they do. But the average consumer isn't going to research whether using the Hori is considered cheating on a specific game or not, especially since Sony licenses it. If I bought a licensed product, I'd expect to be able to use it on anything.
---
Ubisoft has litteraly said it's cheating themselves
---
The best visual representation I've seen for the state of the game.
---
Holy shit dude I think I was in a match with you earlier, pretty sure I rage quit too lmao.
---
I did know you need an adapter, but ~~the Hori comes with said adapter to my knowledge. Just did some preliminary research and it looks like that is in fact the case.~~ Also, I wasn't complaining. I was just pointing out that Sony officially licenses the controller.
---
Edit: Just did more in-depth research. You don't need an adapter with the Hori, it's built into the thing. It will work even on games that don't allow M+K. 
---
Honestly not sure how it works exactly but I doubt Sony/Microsoft care enough to sue. It’s not effecting their sales so they have no reason to take action against them. 
---
It’s the game companies themselves that consider mnk cheating as it creates an unfair advantage. Mnk to Sony/Microsoft would be more of a accessibility issue, some people can’t hold/use a remote so they would need mnk to be able to play.
---
Excuse me that’s PLAT 1!!!!!!!
---
I'm gold and I don't have a problem with clash.
---
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
They'll probably alter the numbers and add some generic explanation stating that the system wasn't updating the headshots.
---
Lol at facts
---
From the title I thought it was going to be a toxic player apologizing to the masses after a moment of self-actualization. But instead it was an apology letter written on behalf of noobs everywhere. Thank you for blissfully capturing my r6 experience. I know it won’t happen, but I wish you eternal immunity to tk’s. Good luck my friend

There will be lots of Tachanka laughing at 550 rpm

Make sure to burst it though.

they all show that it dosent seem to help you can see two seperate ones there

Yea i go double shotty and its hecka fun

Not relevant but does Ela really not have nail polish?

I also main glad in for honor so yes i got a massive toe fetish
---
I mean, u died because you lost a gun fight. You weren't even close to hitting the dude. He got you fair and square, just because there is a little bit of latency issues (maybe due to a storm/ or high load on the ISPs) isnt going to change the outcome.
---
Ash
---
sorry if this sounds like a dumb question but what exactly is the problem? the data center?
---
Get good

Jäger with arial support and Tachanka running some AA turrets to assist Jäger
---
Their next pve game might have more
---
Hmm, I like it!
---
im not sure it says i have negative ping sometimes(like millions of negative) and other times its like 200k ping. i cant load into games and when i do get into one i cant move
---
ive tried reinstalling resetting router hard booting nothing is working. i can play other games fine and it didnt happen till after  the last patch
---
You straight up missed
---
And still no answers...
---
ok
---
Does it affect your gameplay at all?
---
It’s just a visual glitch
---
I once had to explain in VIVID detail that no when the emp is going off is when you put your charge on the wall so he cant bandit trick you
---
he then waited until the charge had gone off and wasted his two thermites, then we lost the round
---

---
One thing people never do with Nokk is drone ahead, find their angle. Find a softwall close by sneak there, consider snealing back or another entrance depending on what you drone out. Then pop the wall and use the distraction to get the drop on them. Though she can also hunt or lurk around rotation points on the map undetected and eliminate roamers and second tier defenders. Though with coordination she males for a scary sandwich, in 1v2 situations.
---
...yes i cant move at all and disconnect symbols pop up like crazy
---
I MAG EM A CRO?
---
nook isnt useful, and is outgunned in every gunfight. 
---
change my mind.
---
I hope they give it since it has barely gone up since it came out
---
Yeah you can stop worrying about grenades now
---
Thanks brother
---
Most likely it’s just a ping timeout
---
No
---
Does anyone else want to lay it flat and try?
---
its been going on for days now like thats not normal and if it is the server timing me out why is it doing it? im not banned so wtf is going on
---
I use the 417 acog and muzzle break
---
Get her she has high frag capability and is easy to play
---
Shotgun shots spread even when ur aiming right? If they do the buckshot should have killed them and they were lagging anyway which doesn’t defer the point. Correct me if I’m wrong
---
just mad ig
---
I think it’s spread is tighter if you aim for some reason
---
Damn straight
---
I honestly don’t see the downside of this.
---
If 400k people showed up to Area 51, what could the government do?
---
Fuck I’m losing brain cells even clicking on my inbox now.  I can’t

Hit box error, good show of it, Ubisoft your answer?
---
it
---
Winston aim LUL
---
you might have a firewall that cancels the icmp requests, but even then I’m just grasping at straws
---
What's the problem?
---
Dronning and finding angle is even more important to Nokk. I do like using breaching charge as a distraction from time to time. Using quiet footstep to sneak in while Anchors looking away gives me a massive satisfaction. 
---
Doing this and Mav hole kills are most satisfying for me lately.
---
Doesn’t every operator make the team change their play style?
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
That’s how I always explain Nokk to friends who haven’t played siege since the newest update
---
The mag for that gun looks like a dick
---
I played the hell out of r6 and the last one was doing 100 defense terrorist hunt missions and a month later they removed it I can’t tell you how pissed I was.
---
Best you can do is try to focus more on strategy. You're not going to beat them in the fragging/aim game, so you got to out strat them. Would also roam less, take less riskier gunfights than you would against non cheaters.
---
Basically just try to force them to beat you by obj and strats, don't give them gunfights you don't have to.
---
Good job
---
Lol ok.
---
This sentence physically hurts me. 
---
I heard about the Centurion problem but I didn’t know the game still has problems in general. 
---
I remember liking Peacekeeper because I liked her fightstyle but didn’t get to play for long to have a concrete grapes or opinion on this game as a whole.
---
They are actually the guards mowing them down, all stationed on their cozy little turrets, spawnpeeking from all directions
---
She has the shield out for everyone else but can still fire normally.
---
What happens if a player doesn't pick an op then?
---
His gun is very easy to use and is pretty good too, as well as being 2 speed he’s super balanced. Personally I always ban lesion. Love playing him though
---
Lol ok
---
The doxxer becomes the doxxed
---
That's an idea. Thank you.
---
Nice
---
😂💀
---
Me too
---
nope. there was a sale once on credits..but then again that was 3-4 years ago...and never again
---
If u cant afford robots, use bio-robots
---
its pronounced khool hwhip
---
No it wouldn't have, been in dozens of communities where they don't reach the challenge goal.
---
Area 51 is privately ovened so they will probably just be arrested for trespassing. But....... they could all get shot by area 51 armed guards.
---
His nerd basically made him less useful that n ant OP with a dmr
---
I can’t put glitch in the title without it getting taken down, Ubi? What is this? You just fixed her... like cmon guys
---
Tell a friend
---
They arent going to massacre civilians lol. They'll shoot wax tips, bean bags and CS gas.
---
So this is gonna be what brings the government down huh
---
Yeah but queing with low ranks (low rank on purpose) is cheating to then.
---
Asinine.
---
Take my upvote you godly human
---
You want a cookie?
---
Agent Smith is just too OP
---
*Interstellar theme plays*
---
If you were credited with all 5 kills, then yes, no matter how they were obtained
---
yeah it technically is
---
Delete this!
---
Probably the worst I've seen in any game I've played
---
Seems like u got spawnkilled
---
Do you know if there is a buck one?
---
He can fight the entire Area 51 guards.
---
Yes, I would. Lol
---
Good idea
---
Great for beating dissenters.
---
Lawbringer rework. Peacekeeper beinG ridiculously bad. Centurion. Not to mention the god damn input lag BUILT INTO THE GAME. The whole Wu Lin being sub par. Most of the Viking heroes having a really narrow skill gap. 
---
Yeah, it's bad.
---
Nothing has been as bad as centurions release thankfully (Because it is almost impossible to be that bad lol) but their balance is still pretty bad. They are just so slow with balance changes and when they do update characters they hardly ever get them right so everything either feels really under-powered or super overpowered all the time.
---
downvoted cause fuck you
---
Kick ass.
---
I was actually running Ying as a response to their ying, blitz, lion combo in the previous round. They were going cancer, so i didn't think they'd use an anti-cancer operator like Warden.
---
Ah yes the best gun in the game.
---
thank you. that is adorable. sadly my current mains aren’t there :(
---
And i hate you also
---
When we played they banned cap so we just brought nades/nomad. They brought us to overtime match point but we pulled through. It sucks cause we were absolutely smacking them 3-0 and it took us far too long to close it out. GG man
---
Do you see how stupid you are by saying something so stupid? “Hacks are the best device”. Hahahah thanks for the laugh, moron. Welcome to the blocklist, but thanks for the amusement.
---
Also, ik I'm going to get a comment about "there's only 4 people on the other team, how could it be an ace" but someone left right as I spawn killed him. So please and ty for reading this and hope you enjoy my video :)
---
que someone ddos'ing the servers
---
OOOOOOOHHHHH....
---
*Loads 5 rounds into a two round barrel*
---
ahhhh lol. bronze ftw.
---
Talk about THROWING a match...
---
I'll show myself out
---
It always be those 4 stacks in their clan that start the kick as soon as you join the game
---
Or even worse it’s those 3 stacks and the other rando wants to be “cool” and then they end up kicking him too
---
It’s not terrible. It’s not great, either, though. There are a few glaring issues, which they’re trying to address, but it’s getting there, I think. There are a lot of people who don’t really know what they want out of the game in the community, though. You’ll see a bunch of posts complaining that defense is too strong one day, and a bunch complaining about a character actually being allowed to have offense the next. The community is kind of a shit show, for the most part, so it’s hard to get clear answers on stuff like this.
---
I just took a break before Lumina came out.  
---
and with even 10,000 people you would have effectively infinite supers after the nerfs.
---
If I were you, I would contact Ubisoft support about this. I believe it shouldn’t take this much time for the credits to appear.
---
thank you
---
Np.
---
Wtf. Another glitch??????
---
I did I saw, bad registry.
---
I never vote to kick unless they actually did something. Whether I’m part of a 4 stack or not.

---
\-I saw a thread on this subreddit about the kevlar vest and the tactical vest, the closest tactical vest imo is the 5.11 LBE, for the kevlar I still haven't found anything apart from photos of real GSG9 operators wearing that ves in black.

My main problem is the jacket (I mean finding an identical one)

Not sure that's possible.
---
You can apply a weapon skin for all weapons. If it was that you meant 👍🏻
---
No its like. When u spam pistol, lets say a opponent is holding an angle. You can only hit his head, so if u peek him and spray the bullets, the jump of pistol(including iron sights) will cover where ur aiming.
---
Thus this makes u unable to see if opponent crouched in-between or strafes away. 
---
If you have habit of aiming head/neck evel then its frustrating to die coz enemy peeked u crouched.
---
They nerfed the hipfire aswell so u are forced to ADS alot of times too
---
I hate you too lmayonaisse
---
True, even if it was in I would still have 100 completion
---
Oh I see what you mean now thanks for clearing that up
---
Lucky, I was still 72/100 done, so much applaud to you in that case
---
Yea I know that, I just thought that if you could apply it to attack or defence you could have it like it matched how some people have all of defence Red weapon skin and like blue on attack
---
Yes but without it being their gadget and on a full auto weapon.
---
Should have used a wire
---
Ah.. that is a great idea though. But I don't think we are able to do so
---
Copper 4 and diamond are the least populated ELO’s, best ways to avoid queue times are ranking up, and queuing with your friends. A 5 stack squad will queue much faster than someone solo queuing (typically) but this would help a lot at your level. I recommend LFG on Xbox, it’s a tab for people looking for games and siege has one. You can easily make a post for teammates or reply to someone else’s post.
---
You are scum
---
Coming through:)))
---
Glaz is balanced now imo, before he was basically broken op. Throw smoke push and kill everyone he was annoying to play against now his an actual sniper
---
That would be too strong, there would be no reason to use another sight
---
Yea, but it would be neat concept :)

OH MY GOSH VIDEI GAMES CAN DO IT TOO!!! Yeah
---
Also just hit level 30 any advice for ranked

Ahahah very funny! Those numbers are real funny numbers! Ahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhaahhahahah!!

People In The R6 Sun : Is this a new legendary?
---
Brilliant
---
I now like you just a little more than the average person
---
I find British people bit more communicative, also as they tend to rage bit more you can calm them by doing a simple 3k
---
Thats why youll always be a recruit main
---
Bring a towel, it can get pretty sweaty
---
I hate you as well, but in a way that belies the fact I love you.
---
I feel like you might as well stick with ranked. Playing casual will help you a bit, but it’s so different with ranked that in a lot of ways, casual will only develop bad habits when you go back to playing in ranked. 
---
Learning the maps and communicating are the easiest ways to get better and rank up. Also, there’s nothing wrong with being in bronze or copper when you’re starting out. You don’t want to be in gold or higher when you’re new to the game, because people will get pissed off at you for not knowing exactly what to do.
---
Coming from cs:go, I'm guessing call-outs and knowing the maps is important. Is the gun play comparable or will I need to relearn a lot?
---
They don't IP ban on PC
---
Just ran into it again tonight :/ got wrecked by floor IQ
---
Only thing I'm not on board with is the one-hit headshot mechanic you have, that some pistols will do it and some won't.
---
Adds another step of stuff to remember when it comes to making loadouts and probably won't be properly noted, leaving many players playing a guessing game on what pistols kill on headshot, and which ones down.
---
Well you're the one who started talking about PC so I don't know what you're talking about
---
Those are pretty long....socks
---
Oh we will nerf him alright
---
just try if you can change your name, if not the 30 days are not over
---
I probably would've panicked and played like an idiot as soon as the defuser went down. Crazy how you stayed calm
---
Wow ur really going to talk that much shit about serenity he is better than you in every way. He is more succesful then you will ever be. Its pathetic that you disrespect him that much plz just leave. Serenity is my God he is your God bow down to him u worthless scum
---
The PS4 controller battery isn’t that hard to swap out (if it’s actually the battery and not just the cable).

Wow ur really going to talk that much shit about serenity he is better than you in every way. He is more succesful then you will ever be.

---
we need Caveiras for interrogations and Vigils and Nøkks to sneak in
---
I disconnected and rejoined the ranked match and I got recruit right as I joined I thought he was removed, no?
---
very useful tip . thanks
---
No worries.
---
Here is proof that this was a ranked match  https://imgur.com/gqQ0r8a

What genius at ubi even had the idea of making it "Showdown headshots only".

This guy had a lag switch or ddos’d you lol

The walls in boat storage on Kanal are particularly bad about this.  I've found that it seems to be picky about two people trying to reinforce the same wall-if I move away from the wall, let the other person finish putting theirs up, then walk back to the wall, it will let me reinforce.  I've not really experienced it anywhere else regularly, though.

But she kicks the wrong direction?

Can you do that but without her clothes, its uh for a friend👍

Serect ur cur

Honestly i think fuze needs this

its u internet lags
---
Isn't that how this shitty subreddit works?
---
Best one so far
---
Makes sense seeing as
---
1. No one cares for the BOSG outside of memes
---
2. The event got very boring very quick. It was a dread just winning the 10 rounds for the second pack.
---
Made me audibly moan
---
Oh okay, thanks.
---
Happy cake day.
---
You said you can 180 just as easy and peek just as good and you can’t. You just can’t
---
Since then Siege has become way more popular thus having one of the most toxic and dumb communities ever. Throwers, team killers, cheaters and just toxic people are common these days. Oh, and the current season by far has the most cheaters alongside with ddosing so expect half of your games unplayable with 4k+ ping. 
---
No, it's not worth playing this game anymore. Don't come back and remember the good old days when Siege wasn't a toxic shitshow with operators from Overwatch and garbage predatory lootboxes that cost $60.
---
Fuck this sub
---
The mira one was literally a day before official release
---
Oh dang dude that’s a shame I’m actually on Xbox not PS4 :(
---
It's all about the ego
---
reason #24 of why Secure Area was removed from ranked
---
Damn no need to flex lol. My others were as Ying and Ela, hopefully when I get back from holidays I'll be able to get back into Siege and catch up on amount of aces
---
Well if your looking for a dom ;)
---
It makes no sense they boot to get a high rank to brag but never play legit cause they’d get clapped makes no sense
---
Oh RIP. I thought you were on ps4 from the video. Oh well.
---
What would the mvp animation be?
---
(Very nice drawing btw. I like it a lot.)
---
Happens to me all the time.
---
Oh wow. That's cool. I got a 4k as ela when she got rando picked for me. I couldve prob gotten the ace but a teammate took a kill.

queuing times will be longer
---
Breach charges as defender?
---
this way is dirtier
---
It word for me, thanks
---
You won the chalange
---
Didn’t think about that like maybe him hitting his chest and bullet shells come out
---
Yea true,  But my opinion is that u need to pick atleast 4 maps to queue. Then queue wont be too long
---
True I'm sick of getting on Hereford and challet I want to be able to choose maps that I like and get to practise some strats on maps I like, like consulate or house.
---
This can't happen to me anymore because I play with a Razer Wolverine. It's wired 😏
---
Que times would be the same, it would just take longer for the game to start because and picking in the map. Like in BO4.
---
Believe me dude . This game is one of the best games i've played in my life
---
No. That’s skyscraper

See your body into the Kafe

Ubisoft, the servers

---
Can't you see now
---
Illusion
---
Right into your mind
---
No... It's not. 
---
You're comparing a 5v5 competitive flick shooter to a 100 player free for all battle royale. 
---
Fortnite is far more casual for the most part. It doesn't have killcams so you can't see exactly how you died. 
---
It has the same amount, if not more, people using m&amp;k but the game also has about 100x more active players.
---
I think he should come out with a fat ass flame thrower. Jokes. But I think his appearance should be a delta force marine appearance.
---
Yes because they are electronic
---
selecting maps during ingame might be a better idea . But there will be a chance that you will meet the same players you had in the previous match
---
Not having that would mean every client needs to sync up. Having one wall blown up and sending and syncing every piece of debris to all clients would result in an enormous amount of network traffic. 
---
There is no workaround for this. Everything else would be ducking bonkers.
---
It's because she has a toggle gadget that causes her to do a unique animation. I wouldn't be suprised if similar things could be pulled off with Glaz since his gadget is also a toggle (however it's for his weapon instead of his character model, so that'll probably cause a difference)
---
Just like Iq says
---
Anything that has batteries she can track
---
Fair 'nuff ;)
---
Definitely the worst part of Nokk is her weapon selection
---
Only of two ops that dont have an acog as well on attack
---
Cause I follow a fuck ton of free runners I've seen this challenge so much, I feel like this is honestly the best addition so far lol
---
😟
---
I don't know either
---
Smurf account is my way of doing it. I also just don’t care about rank because it doesn’t show any level of skill. I’ve seen silvers that deserve plat and diamonds that deserve gold. Find a team to play with and play scrims. Thats the best way to get better because they usually want to play with strats instead of just running and gunning.
---
Sometimes I solo-queue, sometimes I play with friends. I'm playing to have fun.
---
Btw. I'm not OP - I have nothing to do with the post ;-)
---
_12.6k upvotes, gold and 2 silvers for a guy flicking a bottle cap._
---
Perhaps. But i don't think he has any secondary gadgets that would allow him to cause the glitch in the first case. With iq it was because of her claymore. And glaz has a claymore ad well. Pulse i dont think has anything that would allow him to trigger it.
---
I’ve tried the language but I haven’t tried the country yet
---
YOU ALREADY NERFED HIM ENOUGH!! I WANT OLD GLAZ BACK! PLEASE!
---
So we should be rewarded for getting shot by a teammate? There are times a tk is equally both players fault.
---
M1A2
---
Download it again sometime soon and try it out. It’s pretty fun again, with a cool looking expansion soon. Maybe you can convince your usuals to play if you like it
---
Then don't follow him ?
---
I guess i can understand upvotes BUT WHY FUCKING GOLD IT'S SO LOW-EFFORT
---
The absolute chonk on this lad
---
First sry didnt know that was a thing im only a month into reddit
---
There’s no need to be a dick dude...
---
Can you give me a reason? Telling me they suck isn’t really useful
---
Well I can see you probably will like breakpoint and quarantine but rainbow six siege will sadly never have absolutely massive maps with only five players because it's supposed to be like realistic tatics and actual strategy which always makes me sad because most people are gold 3's that got a 30 minute ban on ranked for rage quitting that spawn peek and get their head blasted by my xbox lvl 70 and pc lvl 71 finka main
---
All of them. Ubi just puts every tank in existence into just one big ass tank.
---
The hardest part was winning a match.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
I agree, top floor is really frustrating to attack
---
Second because the Finka sent my Friend Attacker whos in the game a message calling him clash for not clutching a 1v5 and Shot gets mad easily so thats why
---
it is . but still possible from the side
---
There’s a rank above diamond now. How long has that been a thing?
---
Yea true, I have an Esl team but I’ve currently put Tourtaments on hold because I either get people that bail last minute or just aren’t dedicated and play with me just to do the tournaments don’t get me wrong I am a great player not to flex or anything but people just always choose there diamond buddies for s free route instead of practicing
---
Thats my favorite spot to go.
---
Why the downvotes
---
Huh lol. Most of the ops you'd run that combo on have a secondary SMG lol
---
Clever.
---
"A six inch blade never loses reception"
---
Actually utilise TTS as tool that allows to find glitches and gamebreaking bugs before launch of season ?
---
Outstanding move.
---
Not really being anything, just proving a valid point. Too many people arse licking ubi.
---
Worst part is it's not even film horizontally, it's vertical
---
Luigi
---
How long have you been sitting under a rock?
---
It's alright my man. It got deleted by moderators for not being instant karma anyway. :)
---
both guns has the same ads time as the other ar which is 450ms, but your point of ash being unbalance is great.
---
about that site, i think i have about 100% wr on atk and 1% wr on def :)) i try some anchor hold but the stock is so easy to lose control, i think i might try some run out to scare the attacker next time i have to defend that site
---
I hate her first, because whenever an user picks her it's just for the aspects, and proceeds to 0/5 every match.
---
Secondly, basically every roamer is better, gadget isn't useful and weapon is hard (I can use it, I'm used to high recoils), but still.
---
This is off topic but what op seems the nicest to be around im gonna say maestro
---
What's worse is when someone goes thermite which you assume is for garage so you go thatcher but they still push thru upstairs instead
---
You should love yourself. That's awesome
---
Yes because you can't get any point s that round cus ur ded
---
It won’t actually do anything as long as they are not cheating
---
It's not. Purple color is now diamond and blue color is platinum. They just switched colors around :)
---
We out here defending, the amount of hatch play you can do with a shotgun primary is absurd
---
I mean... I want to help make bad jokes. So technically I do
---
Great job, dont be afraid. Very good cosplay. I love playing Ela in game.
---
r/R6STeams might help you out. Explain the situation and I’m sure someone will join ya
---
Oh I get it, I have friends who get mad easily too.
---
And next time tell that Finka to stay alive so they can clutch the 1v5 😅
---
 smh my head
---
Oh? I didn't know it, that sucks.
---
One time I was about to plant defuser because I had like 5 secs left and it was a 1v3, and my controller died. My team kicked me after that in a casual.
---
I think there's a possibility that you inspired the devs to create Ying. Mira's icon is just too specific and I don't believe it, they normally just take inspiration with concepts but that design and colour is almos the same (same with Jager).
---
The only thing that I believe about the post is ying because something similar happened to me (i also create concepts), I think i inspired them to create finka but the original concept was really different. They don't want to get sued for copying a concept so they just take the general idea.
---
They prob just dont like video games
---
Yeh, the drone spot in the roof is helpful though
---
If I find her again I will
---
A Castle for walls?
---
Yeah thatll never be fullfiled
---
Portal gun would be bangin
---
Not my favourite, but after the rework, it's night and day how much of a difference it is to play on, balance wise (Although attacking the top floor is pretty difficult in comparison to the rest of the map). Aesthetically though, it's easily one of the best as well - the gritty, stormy atmosphere looks and sounds so great to me (Probably biased since I'm British...)
---
Old Hereford was ok, but similarly to Favela (and I love Favela), just felt so unbalanced to play. One staircase in the entire map and the basement was impossible to play. I didn't really enjoy the old Club House or Kafe either- but after their reworks I enjoy them now.
---
I should say "thou shall not pass" insted of gign
---
Anyone playing on Irish/British servers that don't mind playing with somone who sits on 165 ping from South Africa... Will totally be support operators if it means speaking English to someone and doing call-outs, instead of listening to mom's screaming in the background in some middle Eastern language and then getting voted and kicked when I don't speak their language😂
---
Smg (cant remember name) with holo scope and angled grip with deagle suppressor and laser and for gadget i use breach charge
---
This is by far the best cosplay of Ela ive seen so far, looks exactly like how i would imagine she looks irl. nice job
---
I thought a lower DZ was more suited for subtle movements? So a higher DZ would benefit someone who is a heavy stick user.
---
A for ass... Ash.
---
Sounds like Plat
---
Ye
---
I think there might be ones that would be okay. My only issue is that it would have to essentially be a minor thing, because anything major makes balancing an issue. My first thought was “what about an operator who can put up something like a deployable shield that stretches across the stairs and has to be vaulted. But then it came back to: that’s too op. To force someone to vault means they are unable to do much against someone holding an angle, waiting for the vault. 
---
I think something like a sensor might be a good idea though. Something like a mine that reveals your location every time you move on stairs standing up or running. That would be a fair idea.
---
LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED *says in Tachanka*
---
Yeah but glaz needs a buff to then i think. Or am i wrong?
---
You are welcome. Obviously trying a new way of droning won’t work all the time but see if you see some improvements 👍
---
It sounds like we might be getting an operator who can climb hatches soon if the leaks are accurate, so that might be an option.
---
I once threw a grenade and it bounced off the window back at me blew me up along with two enemies that ran outside and we won the round. Siege is weird
---
He’s not a true pro 😡  4/10
---
you already stated some of peoples toxic behavior there would literally be no point in adding more junk to fill out while in a game and getting tk’d by the toxic person
---
I would say the same with smoke though.
---
it's not unfair if everyone can change it. if it's unfair then they should change their fov and stop complaining.
---
Oh my

The caption is perfect xD

I've tried but I can't stop freaking seeing these stupid cartoons it pisses me off. I've blocked his posts and I always choose "see fewer posts like this " and all that stuff but I still see reposts and posts on Reddit and it shows up in my feed and my recommended I hate them so much gosh darn it
---
You got me there, in that case, Do Se7en “What’s in the Box!” With rook armor on the ground lol
---
Better than Kanal
---
Fmg has no angled btw. Prepare yourself for removal of breach charge on her :( i myself carry breach charge but it will be swapped with claymore
---
AD PROFUNDIS
---
#BOY 
---
THIS IS SOME SERIOUS GOURMET SHIT
---
FMG9 with vortex sight and angled grip.
---
Deagle with muzzle break because suppressor is damn terrible on it,the recoil is high and then you have small mags and you also lose damage due to using suppressor. No laser sights.
---
I also like to use the shotgun,just laser sight on it.
---
How do you know? You can feel it?
---
This is dope! I love the Cav one
---
Short.
---
I dont think fmg has angled grip does it? If yes then means i run fmg 9 without grip '-'
---
We are in copper 4 territory, ladies and gentleman.
---
Her gadget is good at covering flanks and her weapons are average, her pistol is good though.
---
Already lost :(
---
i mean,it has an angled grip.
---
Haven't played for long but i believe it has one and it's the only grip
---
Posting on the official Xbox Looking for Group. The worst part is, he will never get banned
---
r/imsorryrook
---
Ah no, it is grip-less actually. It is held in similar way u handle angled grips so it must be false memory. Had to open game to see if i actually have no grip on it
---
Outplayed
---
That’s awesome
---
I think that should be a limited time mode I don’t think that siege should keep that as a game mode but for a limited time I would defiantly play that
---
Oh i havent been on in a bit so i forgot and thats what i normally run on guns and that sucks
---
I like Nomad but the only map I regularly run her on is Skyscraper. Her guns and gadget are both decent. Very average operator imo.
---
Only takes a shield to prevent that, though.
---
I am pretty sure overwatch also has that feature
---
hes still got a few minutes
---
Oh yea true. But a brand new operator should come with a map maybe?
---
SMOKEY!
---
I run suppresor on Ump for some reason
---
then no grip since it has none
---
MPX+ACOG? 🤣
---
This is incredibly stupid. You can't just make up some images and slap dates into it and expect us to believe you made those on those dates.
---
Just saying the sight on the PR15 or Ragun 15 in real life is what makes that pistol unique. And truly it's one of the worst pistols anyways as it does the lowest of any pistol in game. Also being combined with very short fall off distances. It doesn't help either that Ela's kit is one of the worst in game only shining where her shotgun lies which is quite pathetic.
---
At most that little vest is 12 pounds or less. I'm sure that bulky blow torch and extra fuel would add up to around the same weight
---
I don’t know how I feel about outplaying myself
---
Restart the game
---
They messaged me after and said “if you’d had a team you would have run a train on us” 😂 but they also said they only got +1 MMR for the win
---
Why wouldn't he?
---
Too OP. Maybe 2 breaching charges to break them and more punches to open them would be better.
---
Training of a ghost and A division agent
---
And to the Warden who teamkilled me at the start of the first round of a game and then got your four stack of players to vote kick me, I'm sorry for existing?
---
On xbox the only thing u can get on multiple accounts are year pass and paid skins/sets
---
ns
---
Or get good without it forehead?
---
I agree, her pistol is indisputably better

You’re missing my point; if you feel like your content is worthwhile and unique, then you won’t have to advertise yourself on some random forum, people will find you on their own, regardless of advertising. I know YouTube algorithms suck, but advertising yourself makes you seem less worthwhile to watch, due to you sounding full of yourself. If ya really wanted to advertise, get a bud or an alt account for it, and talk about your content (no lies of course.) it seems way nicer not coming from the creator, ya know?
---
It's your choice truly but I'm just warning you that Ela really shouldn't be your first pick.
---
Yeah I know what you mean :)
---
Jesus I main ela and I only have 24 hours on her
---
When you try so hard and get so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter :'(
---
But I’ve been playing older versions and it’s so much fun. I’m thirsty for the damn acog
---
Nyet
---
My thoughts exactly. The mode gets boring really quick. I played it only for the first couple of days, never touched since. And I got the hat for Ash from my free pack. The best item from the whole collection imo, don't want anything else. If the challenge was for free pack I might have tried it though, cause why not.
---
What do you think it would take to convince Ubi to make this an official skin?
---
Yeah lol. I can't use it.
---
That would have been amazing, it would have given people a second chance to get what they wanted to in the alpha packs instead of a sucky wrap for a gun you don't even like and the challenge would be completed easier
---
Pros (who play the game as a profession) are seeing it as an issue as well. The problem is that you see the operator for a split second when a quick encounter happens. During that time, you can't really distinguish between a Rook and Doc who have the same outfit with a small difference in their headgears if they have customized cosmetics. The new Cowboy skins are even more problematic. Yesterday, my teammate killed a Twitch in Laundry on Oregon and called out it as a Maverick because their cowboy skins looks extremely similar. This almost cost us the round since we'd earlier spotted Maverick in Armory, so we ignored Armory  and thought no one was there (since we thought Mav was dead), just to be surprised by a Maverick there that popped my head.
---
Yeah they’re pretty slick. I have the Brazil one for Cavs smg. I like it, but I hardly ever use it just because it’s a little too flashy. There are some ops (Cav, Vigil, Nokk) that I tend to run the plain black skin on just for stealth’s sake. The rest of the ops I just run whatever on, 140+ hours in and I can count on one hand the number of times a flashy gun skin has gotten me killed. I just use fun cosmetics
---
You can also walk in front of them while they're both shooting if you both have RFF on.  Bling them with blitz or ying when they're in a gunfight,   follow them around with an echo drone and shock them at crucial moments.  Creativity is key and a lot of fun.
---
You can’t use the acog? His recoil was atrocious back around black ice-Red Crow
---
The only way to build
---
Ha he loads into a game?
---
no only his watch
---
Ok I don't understand the flak I just started playing the game awhile ago and wants to buy an acc from someone who got bored of the game I'm just tryna get a good acc so just chill
---
The better question is: why should it not be viable?
---
I'mma just say this rn the magazine just isn't on it but otherwise it's a good buikd
---
Use punctuation. It makes your post easier to read.
---
Try to forward ports through your windows firewall and if that doesn't help try to also do that on your router. Here is a good article I used to help with issues with matchmaking when I first got the game.

This should include the list of ports that you would need to port forward. There are videos out there for different types of routers that should help you forward the ports on your router and your windows firewall.

2 diamonds 2 coppers and an unranked vs 4 golds and an unranked...yes more time but out of all the others complaining about tge ranked system...this one seems the most balanced

It's based on playerbase size for each platform.
---
Those who care about boosted people, should keep playing casual. If you're with a good team, you can demolish those boosted plats/diamonds with ease. It's when you're in an actual plat/diamond match, that Ranked actually becomes Ranked and competitive.
---
People will still pay for them I assure you. Those who care about cosmetics, will not disable them. Only those who don't give two craps (like me) about cosmetics will enable the feature.

Wait cav has a flag skin? I have not been able to find it when I look in the camos on her guns.

&gt;If the word begins with a vowel sound, use *an*, such as in "an honorable man," and with spoken acronyms like "an FBI agent." Words like "historic," with a pronounced "H" can use either *a* or *an*.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;*Some people feel strongly that words like 'historic' and 'historical' should be preceded by 'an', not 'a'. We recommend using whichever article suits your own pronunciation. Just remember that 'ahistorical' means something else entirely.*
---
Wow I didn’t think the rumors were true but iFunny really do be better than reddit damn
---
Who do you main?
---
Quarintine?
---
DrewskiBTW found and shared this glitch, I met him in a casual game, I now queue ranked with him. He’s a pretty cool guy, just a lil sketchy and scummy for making this
---
Buying Accs ruin the purpose of the game and is bannable because it hurts developers
---
Other guns have better muzzle attachments.
---
They’re probably gonna give us the skin for free or dirt cheap to make up for their shit challenge
---
Yeah, for what the ask his here, it's too excessive, and the game mode just isn't that interesting.
---
Kinky
---
Shit, those are really good. 
---
Honestly? At first I thought you bought them and we’re showing them off, but that’s really good work.
---
Ranked hasn't meant anything for the entire lifespan of this game. Its such a shame that a great competitive shooter's rank system is so easy to abuse.
---
If you can't be bothered to post a proper video then I can't be bothered to watch your crappy cam recording...
---
If he plays on pc i can help. Im pretty patient with new players, i helped a lot of people to get used to this game, im bronze now bc my friend was a lvl 30 and really wanted to try ranked but he is still kinda bad and we got a toxic team but i still went with it bc he felt proud whenever he got a kill. Good bye gold this season lmao

*You're welcome.*
---
**Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte**
---
The Landkreuzer P. 1000 "Ratte" (English: Land Cruiser P. 1000 "Rat") was a design for a landship for use by Nazi Germany during World War II, proposed by Krupp director Edward Grotte in June 1942, who had already named it "Landkreuzer". Submitted designs and drawings of the vehicle went under the names OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1, which were presented in December 1942. The tank was planned to be 1000 tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII "Maus", the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes).
---
This was the end of the kill cam but I didnt capture it. The whole enemy team was doing this weird switching to their primary and back to explosives/flash bangs for some reason and killed us while switching. It was a mess.
---
She's pretty good overall.  You can silently rush the back door of the objective and take out one or two people before they notice you, so she's a great rusher.  Her main downside is her lack of an ACOG but it's not a huge deal.
---
No there werent this was the 3rd round. There were rounds before the match started and I was here then.
---

---
Stop picking stuff up incorrectly and you won’t have this issue.

Short answer: 300k people wanna narotu run to area 51. 20 sep
---
You look like you're about to blow up earth with that grin in the left picture .
---
Basicly, some 250k, 300k Americans plan to storm Area 51 demaning answers and seeking truth about aliens.
---
your next line will be: is that a motherflippin JoJo reference
---
it was a joke... i didnt actually downvote.
---
Good. I hope all the 9 year olds that tell me everytime I should and shouldn't breathe are going

My guy, look at the top of the screen at the first second of the video. You can see thermite and 3 others banned. When there are bans, you cannot pick recruit. You didn’t have to show it was a ranked match with the picture evidence, there was visual proof there were bans in the video.
---
Can I copy your homework?  Sure bro just change it a bit so the teacher doesn't know you copied.

Because the game chooses the one person that pays $5 for their internet to be host

Wtf I literally saw someone do that exact same thing but with Ash on another post about 10 minutes ago.
---
Siege 2? They are working on THIS siege throughout 2025.
---
The other team was using third party tool to lag servers
---
I donr know, maybe research it yourself? There have been countless other posts about this with the same advice - restart your game
---
They didnt.
---
You can still get paired with those bad connections though.
---
Really cool mate!
---
It's called shock wire.
---
3000 or 300000 people are going to go to area 51 to try and see if aliens are real or something but they're all going to die
---
Ok. The MPX has a higher DPS than the mp5, and statistically the mp5 is a garbage weapon, so if you have the MPX, then the MPX would be one of the best defender guns in the game. So if they five warden an MPX with an acog, they might as well give it to bandit again. Please give it to bandit again. Give the acog to any roamer please. Just give pulse an acog or something. Ubi please i beg. Ubi goddamnit please.
---
Close game reopen it
---
I actually enjoy it.... I’m a fuse main so bombing the obj is always fun

Never seen that skin before

I like my beats fast and my base down low

So I have tried all steps and the one that worked for me atleast is verifying the game files. As the issue is related to battleye when we verify the game files battleye gets reinstalled so the problem gets fixed.
---
Poor mans gold?
---
I don't play Showdown, and it doesn't happen to me. My friend does, and it happens to him. Maybe don't play Showdown?
---
I try. But also I just want the fucking acog on a damn roamer. Give Beaulo his child back.
---
Oh right yes I didn't notice that I provided evidence to prove it was the same lobby and ranked. Also idk how it picked recruit for me I thought he was completely removed from ranked.
---
Don’t forget the hard breachers
---
nah i def feel that, i used to have the same situation, i tried to emphasize like an intentional disconnect as in like only when people press leave game in a casual, i pictured just an extra warning screen when you leave that just says this action costs 100 renown and shows their balance, or maybe just for repeat offenders? idrk i just figured id put the idea out and see if others wanted to expand on it

Imagine if they actually made LEGO figures of the operators and had real LEGO sets of the guns and stuff 😂
---
Low key better multi colored

1.2 million

I like it better multicolored, this should be a skin
---
Thousands of glitches introduced by the lousy developers and also failing to fix them. It's been three years and there are glitches every season, not normal glitches but game breaking ones. It's a fact by this point ubisoft can't do their jobs properly. I enjoy playing the game but there's nothing wrong with pointing out simple facts.
---
It’s not 100% LEGO unless it’s rainbow colored
---
Would take me a decade or two
---
You say that as if reporting manually reporting does anything
---
Don't forget the sneaky Nøkk.
---
Talk about getting played harder than the game itself
---
In the sense of who I enjoy/ very effective
---
Offense: Sledge or Maverick
---
Sledge is the embodiment of thanos (Perfectly Balanced) and Maverick may not have the same effect as Thermite or Hibana, but breaching through walls is still useful
---
Defense: Maestro
---
Evil eyes and an LMG is what makes him really strong. 
---
What I think are actually powerful and need nerfs
---
Twitch: she is a diet Thatcher, but with a bullshit primary weapon that you cannot challenge
---
Defense: Rook or Doc: MP5 is also a very unfun weapon to go against, and I can add Echo to the mix as well.
---
You don't know how to use them
---
Why do you care so much even if you drop out of play it won't matter you'll still get the plat charm at the end of the season
---
Dying because your teammates do not help you ?
---
Put it in reverse Terry!
---
damn I thought it was one of those glitches everyone did, I'm new to the game I hope that explains it
---
not necessarily a tip for placement but use ur mic to tell ur team where someone is because she is intel
---
This is up there with that Ricardo edit in terms of the best OC I’ve seen on this sub
---
The pictures should be reversed. Cargo shorts are the future.
---
that's beautiful
---
Oh no
---
I literally say that anytime me and the boys play hostage.
---
That’s a DDoS attack, not server degradation.
---
the revolver frags also count i believe.
---
Why'd he tk?
---
So is it actually happening tho
---
Even a Bullet Proof camera might be nice
---
T.hanks
---
Thanks for the in depth reply. I can’t use maverick personally I’m shocking with her but I do like sledge
---
It’s the best rank i’ve ever gotten. And I’m proud for getting it too.
---
Where do you find the number?
---
*67 enemies flashed*
---
Oh really? Not as scared anymore
---
It warms me to think about the lightbulb lighting up in your head when you saw my comment and thought to yourself "oooooooooh I can tag another subreddit"
---
This was fucking awesome man!! Loved it.
---
That and impacts to add more utility to her. As one of the main reasons I see the shotgun as being her most viable weapon and as good as it is, because without impacts the only way Ela can soft breech walls is her shotgun. Which makes it have even more of a reason to be picked. Not like you should pick the Scorpion anyways with it being one of if not the worst gun in game.
---
I want the YC9 in the game
---
Man thats fucking severe! If you do requests, could you make the AR 15.50?
---
But seriously dead honest really good work.
---
doto best game, you only can stack with ppl at same rank
---
Zofia wouldn’t become obsolete, she still has her concussion grenades.

I once got in a game wit two people already missing, one of my teammates dropped no kills at all and I had to drop 17 to win the match 5-4
---
But why does this need to be on Reddit. Nobody is going to care about it and it's unimpressive
---
I don’t care about it either so why do you

What about my boy clapitao, he’ll have split screen gameplay  24/7

Then why post it?

Want him but he’s quite expensive

Its a joke,  but we all know like 10 people are actually going to show up.  9 are probably going to leave out of embarrasment and the last is going to get arrested 
---
trying anyway.
---
Ooh a toxic lesion main. Interesting.
---
Favourites? I’m saving up for vigil
---
Because I can wth can just not care about something that doesn’t involve you?
---
Sound streaks fun mate
---
Nobody cares about Grammer as long as the point is made.
---
I got the 7 day booster and grinded ranked for like 9 hours
---
Honestly, I like it 800% more than my two least favourites (Tower and Favela) because at least in Hereford I have somewhere to be cheeky and hide around as Mozzie
---
Haven't changed my flair in forever I don't even really main him anymore
---
On your screen he was definitely able to hit you, the killcam was stupid but I'm assuming he was *JUST* close enough to hit your shoulder. 
---
Either way I hate the way melee works in this game, the swing animation is entirely irrelevant all that matters is where your crosshair is at the end.
---
This actually opens up so many strategies
---
Just buff castle?
---
Ok I’m on the way
---
Also says the greedy Jager main
---
UWU
---
maverick kinda cute tho ngl
---
Lmao what’s ops did you use for attack and defense ?
---
Nice skin.
---
Someone started a facebook event. That's bacically it. And now 1.2 million people are signed up for it.
---
It’s not toxic it’s just a clip
---
Or just remove his thermal and give him 140 damage again with a lower ROF. Nobody ever complained he was OP before the thermal.
---
No he’s not
---
I agree, whenever i try to shoot out a window (or barricade for that matter) its just a bit of a bruh moment when i still can't see shit
---
frags were way to op for IQ, they should at least replace claymore for stun or smoke
---
I think it'll be more like 100. All 17-23 yos of course.
---
There bud I deleted it just for you
---
I mean I’ll use any 3 speeds on defence. I guess to narrow it down all use Cav or Alibi
---
This happens to me sometimes, definitely needs to be fixes
---
Our when the lil peice gets stuck its so bs
---
Not your clip, the guy telling you there's no point in posting it. Post what you want. He just think his opinion matters because he got carried to plat 3 once
---
What’s this post trying to convey?🤔
---
Doesn’t Sledge have a Bane mask tho?!
---
Or am I getting whooooshed..
---
I had an image but it didn't pop up
---
Then you shoot it again to get it out and before you know it there either is no barricade or the entire enemy team is spraying you, usually both
---
Which people?
---
Haven't seen a comment regarding it being rainbow colored...
---
Typo in your flair?
---
I'm sure your comment helped op out a lot, they must be so grateful.
---
No witch hunting
---
I literally had to zoom in to realize it's a photo and not in game /an animation. Very nice job
---
p10c clash and warden.
---
Actually don't play ranked enough to care .
---
Lol you must be playing with a wii remote if you cant control the mp5’s recoil
---
Is IT just me or do you get also Offended every round?
---
For example you have a Name and they make Jokes about your Name all round Long. Or just Scream into their mics. Or just randomly call you a f*g?
---
Clutch or kick
---
Lmao you only play casual and you wanna say shit is unimpressive. Go play hostage normie
---
i usually do but im surprised i didn't.
---
Same with claymores I believe
---
Instability is randomized , I can laser fire with the vertical recoil .
---
Claymores and why not
---
Ubi literally doesn't care, had a match with two diamonds just now. You can say it was pretty bad for me
---
And also everyone is posting about the attachment missing.
---
Yikes console
---
r/HuntShowdown would like a word.
---
I think he should have a barricade that you would shoot from a special gun at the top of a door frame and then it would fold down into a castle barricade
---
This makes me happy. I think you'd get a gold if you put black ice on the gun. **smoke happiness noises**

---
Mate I totally agree. My mate and I played a game of ranked on ps4 and we were the only ones ranked on our team, the rest of the team was unranked whilst the opposing team were all gold. Matchmaking needs to be fixed or re-worked so we get to play against people our own level and rank and not smurf accounts and boosters. And they say ranked is "out of beta".
---
are you blind? the match didnt even start sometimes games are launched with 4v5s or in this case 2v5, once i had to do a 4v5 in rank due to the same bug
---
Why you gon a reset people they get revived with 20hp guarantee this is you getting annoyed at it saying that when you tk and you tried to write it in a way in which you wont get any backlash for

It might do that even if you’re holding corners and even fast peeking

Ahh yes, the 21st Bulletproof camera.
---
Bullets hitting if I aim at a thing? what kind of black magic is that?

What did you get

*sees first kill* 
---
"But that's not a one tap..."

*does not see the second kill, but sees the kill feed* 
---
"Wait... what the fuck just happened."
---
I don’t like how he’s pulled up like this in Kids Room
---
Wow, suck unlucky moments, probably because you're using a PlayStation controller
---
If the camera was actually in the eyes instead the neck I probably could've had her.
---
Chemical board for the ump
---
It’s super annoying when you expect it to be there when you’re playing ranked, then it’s all gone and you’re a basic bitch for a round
---
I'm using a ps4 controller on a ps4...

Blitz.

Mine was that low because I had gotten a pack from a  showdown match prior
---
That, and it’s really just subjective too. I know plenty of people who like Secret Star. I’m not a big fan, myself, but I really like the Tarot Card skins despite the fact they’re common
---
Seems like forced diversity but idk
---
11/10
---
Yes really.
---
I agree. I would only add favela to your list. All those maps are ass
---
Sounds suspish as fuck, I'll pass.
---
Acog *Jager wants to know your location
---
Yeah I totally get that. The only problem is that all those games you mentioned are only on pc. It seems that it can be hard to find a truly tactical game with a large playerbase on console.
---
my prefered tactic involves getting on site, planting, and knowing I can suppress the general area infront of me for the next minute or so without blinking (or reloading)
---
not sure about the first guy but I was joking
---
I just meant like one that isnt toxic but doesnt get mad if someone says Nigeria
---
You’re not wrong. Glad to see you representing the toxic side of Siege
---
Like some sort of "if we all walk to areas 51 they can't stop all of us" kind of thing? Wow
---
Lmao understood. How do you pick more than one flair?
---
no sadly pc appreciate it though
---
Favela is 50/50 for me. I like the map since it's good for trap ops, but the objectives are so terrible.
---
It’s so common on console that I’ve stopped playing this game that I love so much.
---
That is what is known as a "***typo***"
---
Fuckin' hell, there was me thinking *I* was fucked in the head.
