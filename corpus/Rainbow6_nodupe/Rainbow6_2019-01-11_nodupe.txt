Looks 10x better than the elite

Csgo implements movement inaccuracy and it's a game that requires immense skill and aiming precision. Adding moving penalties makes the game more tactically dynamic and raises the skill ceiling. If rainbox six is a tactical shooter, I think this is a good thing. 
---
Where is the asian Frost ? 
---
Tachanka isn't anywhere as bad as people say, also the meme had a 2019 revival and i'm hopping on that bandwagon, of course that backfired and boom i lost like 16 karma
---
This is great! I have to do pointilism in my art class and you just inspired me.
---
*cries in bronze*
---
Having "more content" doesn't mean shit when said content is terrible.
---
Well they both play more supportive roles with their gadgets (unless you’re SASG rushing with Finka). I guess it comes down to wether you like to attack or defend more. Personally I would choose Finka because I love her .308 Spear. It’s a good gun and I’ve won a lot of close gunfights because of it. 
---

---
For Kaid, his Aug isn’t really that good imo. If you’re on console, his shotgun is pretty hard to control with the insane recoil. His pistol on the other hand is really good if you can hit your shots. And obviously, he good for securing hatches or 4 reinforcements. 
---
Can we please mark this meme format as dead already? It's really only getting worse and worse at this point.
---
Aww nice 
---
Wow you really are a casual plebian are you? There are exactly zero viable sites on Chalet.
---
Welcome to the r6 community :)
---
Hopefully you take a break and come back. People never treat new players with the patience that they deserve to be treated with. I promise eventually you will see the greatness in this game. Once you push through the heard learning curve, it is so worth it. The tactical teamwork element that siege brings is like no other game.
---
Yeah that’s a very fair point. But personally I don’t think that’s how siege should be played and to me it’s not fun and I’d rather have fun than always ty and win 
---
Play with friends avoid randos ragers and squeekers. 
---
Nice vibrator lmao

---
Yea, I saw a guy with 5 pc accounts. He said he had them was so he could take bans without any real consequence. When one gets banned he just switches to a different one.
---
The single shot has a higher DPS and I play it like Mavericks 50 cal
---
Sadly, that's what the Rainbow community has come to. You get plenty of high ranked players playing casual and playing with ranked stats, expecting their teammates to do just as well as them. That, and toxicity amongst players is just on a rampage lmao.

It's about a time to say it loud - blitz is overpowered, only thing that balances him now is common desync.
---
STOP PUTTING OUT UNIFORMS COOLER THAN ELITES.
---
You name gives it away that you are a salty defender. Explain what's broken. Everytime some one ask they never get an answer, just he's  op or broken
---
The elite is mostly cool, I just don't get the hair.
---
Plus I've never been a fan of the constant unmaskings with the elites.
---
he was definitely crouching of your bullets didn't even hit him chief
---
I'm very good with both but personally Jackal seems like a better experience. But what can I say considering YOU DIDN'T GIVE ANY GODDAMN INFO ABOUT YOUR PLAY STYLE
---
What do you think Ubisoft actually knows how to program? Why do you think there’s so many bugs and hackers in this game still xD /s
---
I don’t have a dedicated main on either side but I do love Doc, Valk, and Jaeger on defense and I enjoy playing Jackal, Thatcher, and Hibana on attack. Fun times :)
---
People tend to hate on anyone that doesn’t do what they want in this game no matter how good you actually are.  Just ignore them and keep trying to get better    They aren’t going to stop anytime soon unfortunately 
---
Mira for actual competitive play, jackal if you're just casual and want to play for kills 
---
Only thing I can say is play with friends.. this community is terrible and there’s not one good thing about it
---
Nah , a few of the vocal pros thinks the bigger maps are shit. They are made for casual because of the 4 minute timer, things like Tower are not playable with 3 minute timers.

Damn dude what an amazing observation.
---
I know that talking about the nitro cell not exploding 
---
From experience, I know this is not true. 
---
I apologize for the others in this community of toxicity. I enjoy playing with new players as long as I know you're new. I sincerely hope you'll give it another try in a while and get to experience this game as much as I have with the same amount of enjoyment. If there's anything I could do to make the experience better let me know! I do play on PC though so that might hinder my offer a bit. When I get a new player in the lobby and they're willing to listen and learn (I've got over 1k hours in this fucking stupid game) I enjoy it because I can help them get better and learn the map we're on. May be just me but I love the idea of new players in Siege if they're serious. Free weekends really suck though.
---
It's a non-elite, and they haven't started doing remodels for non-elites yet so camos and palette swaps are the best anyone's going to get for old-fashioned uniforms until that changes.
---
I don't know if it helps but I play buck a hell of alot?

Are you on PC? If so, you can hit me up and I could show you the ropes sometime.

---
The marks on alibi’s gadget aren’t exact positional marks like cav’s or walking outside as a defender. It’s really close to being exact but there’s just a small delay. Unfortunate timing and mega moves made by that thatcher is what happened. Better luck next time my guy.
---
Well jackal can be played many different ways but his C7E rifle is godlike
---
How about, the maps aren’t terrible and haven’t been, so your point is moot? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Blitz is in a good spot as is. Up close, if you play smart, you’ll  always win. He has a lot of his body exposed behind his shield. While he’s running he sounds like a freight train so you can have the element of surprise and flank him, if the enemies do a poor job of droning. His biggest counters are Kapkan and lesion it makes him a sitting duck more or less. The flash on his shield is inconsistent and while up close you can slap his shield away in time if you’re in a tight spot and shoot him. End of the day there are more ways to beat a blitz than you think just use your head a little .

Don’t worry I have over 900 hours played and I still struggle to get past BRONZE 1. They still all hurl the Same abuse at me as they did when I started (OP : Black Ice)   Just mute the negative players you’ll get there eventually 
---
Tfw you realize too late the person you downed was Doc xD
---
This could be the worst answer ever
---
Monty will not be nerfed or buffed because she is very basic, and does not require adjustments. That being said, a really good Monty player is very scary. Being able to bait out greedy defenders or deny a doorway is extremely useful. 
---
Zofia is very easy to use if you use her amazing lmg. She shoots impacts and concussion grenades from her gun
---
That's ridiculous. I just messaged this guy asking why he was being so toxic and he called me a couple of "choice" words and then immediately blocked me.
---
These people need to be perma-banned if they aren't going to apologize or take any consequence for ruining other peoples experience. 
---
I guess I could be over-reacting but a lot of people paid full price for the game and have played since day one and are still stuck in the pits of this cause they don't 5 stack or play really high level.

These have all been problems since day 1 and the game is doing fine. R6 is not the only game plagued with these issues, the game will survive with or without those that quit.
---
The reality is the majority of R6's playerbase are casual players that stick to only casual and are likely entirely ignorant to these types of problems. It's just a different flavor of COD for them.

I’d like to see you prove it.

It's a community flair. Are you on mobile? 
---
Well I did not know that I could get a draw on casual
---
I am moving down with my dpi for a while. But the step from 800 to 200 is very high. You saw in the first kill, that I am not at all used to this and I can’t even control the Scorpio. That’s not too hard usually. 
---
If you're on mobile go to the main page of r6 subreddit and on the top right theres 3 dots and you tap that and tap set community flair

If you're close enough to shoot his legs, you're already dead. This may not apply on PC, but console Blitz is easily the most OP operator on offense. And once again, you can say "shoot him in the head" all you want. But need I remind you when BB's shield had 800 HP, people were saying "all you have to do is shoot in the body".
---
Anyone know how much it is?

Terrible all day for me and my friends on PS4. Not normal at all

I dont play on console so I dont know. Just plug in mouse and kb lmao

yeah, can cover drone holes breaches and the bottom of barricades with castle and stuff would be fun

oop yayy thank you :)
---
I'm presuming you used [Edich's Artwork of Frost](https://www.deviantart.com/edich-art/art/Frost-635506478) as a reference
---
Some of the shading and lines are a bit messy, particularly on the hair and neck.
---
In the original piece there was no indication of all the strands of hair, which you might've been trying to create.
---
I like that you used some dark lines and light lines on the hat but I think more of them together would be better. For example there's more shadows on the left which you could've given more indication to give more depth
---
Face is not too bad, but it's slightly off with the body.
---
I think you're focusing more on the complex forms rather than the ***simple forms*** 
---
I.e building your forms from simple shapes kind of like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=hand+construction+lines&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi085mfzOTfAhUB9YMKHXtzAKUQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=938#imgrc=NxGC52KlViKAcM:)
---
Line work is fairly clean, not bad.
---
Your version of the reference is not to stiff in form.
---
Facial features such as eyes are not bad.
---
Texture on her coat is  soft and gives good indication of feel.
---
Other than that, not bad. Me likey. I think you just need to draw more, if you don't know how to do something there's always resources online you can use. I'd personally recommend watching [Draw with Jazza](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrawWithJazza) and [ProkoTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV) as they have both helped me a lot (Although there are plenty other good ones).

How much do u want for it?

Is that supposed to be a joke? I seriously can't tell.

You can draw an infinite amount of times in ranked or casual as far as I know. Though they are very rare.
---
Because he'd be a lot faster than Monty.
---
Then fix your internet?
---
Yes? 
---
They flash multiple times blinding enemies, she can’t get blinded though. She can also place them on breakable walls/barricades and they’ll shoot in like fuze’s gadget.
---
bad bot, no one likes you.
---
I'm glad I was able to bring discussion to the table.
---
yes , its boring to play against and its harder to win against, if they bring it out on attack i expect my team to do so aswell... i dont want to be in a bad spot just cause something is broken, BUT if i dont care about the rank I wont play it
---
Think of them as flashbangs that don’t affect her, but they do affect everyone else. They can also be used as a fuse charge on a window, brocaded door, or castles door/ window. They can be charged to 3 different timer levels when thrown and they do a cool thing when thrown at the floor towards a doorway, they stick to the wall and go through the doorway. Ying is a good character when played right. 
---
haha fuck no
---
Are you serious? That's ridiculously childish.
---
There is no need to kill yourself because you got an operator that you're shit with.
---
Arniox first off, he isn’t a 2 speed he is the only non 3 speed gsg, he is a two speed, second off all of the things you mentioned can be countered by teamwork, the whole point of blitz is to confuse and destroy the communication of the defenders, the only nerf I could possibly see for him is downing with the melee instead of an outright kill, but even with the hitreg issues with his shield I don’t think that is appropriate.
---
Blitz is one of the most underpowered operators in the game lmao. 
---
Yes

Most of the Operators have been covered on the link except for Zofia who didn't have her render released with the asset packs.
---
i suspect this is a meme... might i add to the post, ubi cant do anything bout it , talk to sony.
---
You aren't going to get what you want. Your just mad you got outplayed, no gun needs nerfed. No map needs removed. And cosmetics are just fine. From the way you sound, you dont play well, which is probably why you got team killed❤

Hell yes

Haha what?

Welp there it is, the dumbest R6 post of the day.

Excuse me bud. Monty provides no fun in casual and is a useless operator.

I have to kill myself when he is picked because of the deal made with my friends. I hope you understand 
---
I dont know if you know this but you can pick blitz too
---
Nice.

Ahem, lion, jackal, dokka,and nomad would like a word
---
i’d rather have drop shotting than this bullshit
---
Okay I know this comment will get negative karma because people disagree with it because that's how reddit works but who cares? It's funny. Why do people on Reddit have to be so elitist about what is posted and if it conforms to their standards? 
---
It means.. "A chunga chunga chunga.. CHUnGa cHUnGa.."
---
The problem isn't Lion alone. The more ops that push with Lion or as a team the exponentially more effective it is currently.
---
Don’t give up it’s a really fun game the community however is the worst I’ve ever seen. 
---
I did the same exact thing and got the same exact chibi lol 
---
Saying you got an ace as blitz is like saying you fended off a vicious dog when you actually just kicked a puppy

It’s doing the same thing to me and I’m on Xbox it’s really annoying it doesn’t happen all the time to me though

I would argue the opposite, year one attackers you get Buck Hibana and Capito which have really good utility and Hibana is a hard Breacher, although Valk and Echo are good they are probably worse than Mira and Lesion, or even Vigil with his op ass K1

Yes. Like maybe a console ban. I mean like if u tk how every many times, then u cant just go onto a Smurf account. It should be across the whole console. Not a whole console ban where u can't play online for anything else. Just for r6s. Only situations.

That actually does look really cool , to be honest.

Doesnt work for casual or ranked. That is only for T Hunt.

looks better at an angle. when looking at it in 90° it dosent look as nice.

I agree with the other comment. Lion, jackal, dokka, nomad and even the upcoming attacker with the spider webs are hard counters to her.
---
They can easily spot any roamer and both a lion and dokk hard lock down a cav. Jackal warns of nearby cavs, and nomad slows her down.
---
She is, infact, in an extremely weak position right now. Especially with the current lion dokk blitz meta. And with the new attacker she'll be even harder countered. 
---
I know right, shits mad potato
---
I think youre one of the toxic peole op is talking about
---
I expect great things, if you become famous don't forget about me

exactly like you queued me in a match that is full and then tell me it's my fault and you don't even queue me for the next match. Just revert back to Main Menu.

I honestly thought she was going to take off her blindfold in the rapids and get the kids to safety, but becoming infected in the process. Earlier we saw the other pregnant lady resist killing herself for a moment to hand off her baby. I thought that this would become relevant again as Sandra would power through it and sacrifice herself for the kids, showing visually that she can actually be an amazing mom in her own way and give everything for her kid. What they went with felt too forced IMO.
---
Why would you run thermite with anything but a shotgun? 
---
Can I use this as my uPlay avatar? It's already Valk, but from some Japanese artist that I could never get ahold of. I'd be sure to use the whole picture so that the signature gets in there somehow.
---
Huh, people remember when she was strong by 6 months but don't recognize that is almost a year after they destroyed her with Chimera launch. (no wonder, Lion was no.1 hot topic)
---
Nothing else plays like Siege. It could be so much better without all the bullshit Ubi resorted to because they largely don't know how to make compelling new attacking operators. 
---
It depends. Her biggest weakness is a team that communicates. If your going against a squad they counter her easily. She’s best against players who go off by themselves.
---
Why you gotta disrespect the Lord like that lol. Nice ace btw.
---
Usually end of Feb, beginning of March 
---
I agree with you 
---
True that about the gadget. I feel like if his gadget got buffed to be viable, he'd actually be a good and balanced operator.
---
But about the armor not being a disadvantage I disagree. As an attacker it is very disadvantageous to be a 3 armor without a shield (of course Fuze has a shield too but it's way worse than Monty or Blitz), so basically Fuze is a 3 armor without a shield. Being heavily armored limits your movement a lot, making you an easier target and also easier to hear pushing. And of course a lot slower.
---
Think about Ash for example. She is only used for pure fragging. Arguably Fuze's cluster charges help your team more than Ash's launcher. But Ash is a 3 speed with a good gun which makes her a fragger. Fuze's gun is a lot stronger than even R4C but yet he hasn't seen much play due to being so slow and noisy.
---
There is a reason for Ubi not having added a single 3 armored attacker after launch. And there is a reason for Fuze's pickrate kissing the dirt even though his kit is nearly overpowered level.
---
But yeah, I feel like his kit is so strong that even as a 3 armored if his gadget got buffed he could be a viable and balanced operator. But we'll have to see I think.
---
All I know is that the ps4 version of siege has 15 outbreak packs with it right now. Like a deal thing 
---
I work in the industry and this is exactly what packet loss looks like. Packet loss is 99% of the time on the user, &gt;0.1% of the time on the ISP, and almost never on the company itself. 
---
Okay........?
---
Great.
---
If you can't get out of bronze after 900 hours, you have more problems than toxic people
---
for real, this has been on EVERY siege youtubers channel
---
do you even go on this sub or youtube? lol this isnt new
---
I can understand that, just know that their accounts might be younger, and they've recently have a few good games or something. Sometimes they are just truly fantastic players but everybody has off games and the 0.6 top frags with 12-4-3 and I'm sitting sad ath the bottom 2-2-4 but we won. 
---
damn it! how didnt i thought that way before?
---
\- im the one playing cav duh.
---
Why? i mean,  you need to reduce vertical and horizontal recoil, but ill try it!
---
Breach Charges on barricades?
---
What universe is this?
---
It reduces both of those..
---
I personally think year 1 is a lot better than year 2
---
You really love kapkan
---
Ya I quit after 3 years. I got about 15 people to buy the game and play with me, they’ve all quit at this point. This will be the first year I don’t buy the season pass, they don’t get another cent from me. 
---
Nah cav will just spam hipfire and clip my shoulder, then instantly down me with 1 bullet
---
Fun
---
It looks like you burned your leg
---
It's getting worse lately.
---
You really love working at MacDonald’s 
---
Oh god no. I do not miss the days of her sniper 90
---
I recommend starting off with the  operator sledge and using the assault rifle. It has minimal recoil and strong damage perfect for a player starting out .
---
Operators with an easy one place gadget are easy like rook u are helpful without needing skill
---
IMO its hard to say which is the "best" operator, and what their most "optimal" loadout is (there are people willing to throw themselves into a fire for their GC36 while others regard it as an outclassed weapon). All I can really say is mess around with operators you find interesting, experiment with their loadouts, and get used to their gadgets. 
---
bad title
---
It would be cool if it was a free to play standalone title. Launch with the same ops it had before, add a few months later maps for a wave based mode and add from there. I think it would be really cool to see what crazy things they could do with a pve siege. It would be like killing floor but way better.
---
Tried r/r6steams? 
---
I give that clip a 2 out of 10.
---
Nah give it wheels and a shield in front to protect him
---
That’s kind of normal for me. Depending on my attack situation I’ll use: Fuze(my actual main) if I want to play serious, blitz to cyber bully in casual, and Monty if those two are taken. On defense I use Vigil and Echo about equally, but vigil a bit more because I really only play echo when I have a squad. I think that being good with a few ops is great. 
---
Pick Thatcher on attack, Jäger/Rook on defense. Their gadgets are easy to use. Muzzle brakes on all weapons, if possible use ACOG when availible.
---
You can get the hang of it in Terrorist hunt.
---
Do you mean:
---
M870 Primary
---
M870 Secondary
---
M870 Utility?
---
Hitting perfect headshots is difficult for everybody on console. Most of the time it's luck. Find one pro who can easily pick up a controller and hit non stop headshots with just a couple bullets of the Scorpion, the gun with probably the most horizontal recoil in the game.
---
Ah yeah I guess we can't compare our experiences then. In that case, I still see Ela picked regularly on PC, so maybe it's just a console thing.
---
maybe because of shit like you see in the video?
---
givE THIS MAN GOLD
---
Yeah, Ela is pretty rare on console now. Seems like half of the Elas run shotgun too.
---
looks great just needs color so it doesn't look like ... That
---
“pleb” PS4. Why do people have to compare them? Being skilled with a controller is one thing, being skilled with keyboard and mouse is another. I play both, all that’s different is what I’m using to control. 
---
This is good
---
Very thoughtful and cool idea :) mind if I steal this idea for my friends birthday? 
---
Why are you saying this to reddit and not the fucks saying clutch or kick to you...
---
Ola... I had the same issue while ago and solved it. This is only if you have bought the game from Steam.
---
First activate Steam overlay in Steam Settings. Then, set Steam to Run as Administrator. Now, get into the game, Store and purchase R6 Credit, it will ask you payment option ( I had balance in my Steam Wallet thus used Steam Wallet as payment option). Step 5? Profit... Steam browser popped up, it says Thanks for Purchase and all but you have to wait for good few moments for the credit to load into the game ( you can see it behind the Steam browser itself).
---
I hope this help... it must. Let me know
---
Too bad the gameplay itself is worse on console.
---
I have 5 (SSG and AUG for IQ, pistol for JTF2, P225 for GIGN and Fuze AK)
---
The ones in the video are not that rare, even though they're black ice. The rarest, or most prestigious anyway, are the Ash R4-C, Buck AR, Jaeger AR, MP5, MP5-k, Thermite AR etc.
---
Is it me or aces with Blitz just fucking happen? Like, they're not even that rare

There's a specific way hackers can bypass 2FA ranklock. In fact you don't have to be a hacker to do so.

Thank God you said robo dog.

I have a clip of this (im on holiday so I cant post it atm). It was on plane and I shot at the cargo door. It didnt break and I changed my mind and droned. After like 5 seconds of droning cargo I die. Cav had run out through the door that was closed on my screen (seen in the kill cam too). 
---
what the actual fuck
---
Console is definitely better. Less hackers, smurfs, drastically harder to do that lean crouch shit. Honestly the only things worse about console is no text chat, which can sometimes be a good thing, lower frames, but after playing on console for a while it's honestly no big deal, and it's harder to aim. Which doesn't really matter considering it's the same for your enemies.
---
Legit my same reaction, what's your rl rank 
---
I usually do it to my friends to be an ass, but I don't actually kick. That's just fucked up
---
Wasting the attackers' time is a huge component of playing defense in Siege. The nature of attack vs defense means that the attackers need to make the first move.
---
If roamers do their jobs right, they will make the attackers afraid to move up and force them to spend more time trying to clear outs rooms. Whether or not the roamers got some early picks or just simply dealt a bit of damage, it doesn't matter. They've effectively made the attackers worry about them instead of getting to the objective to plant the defuser.
---
I've been having that since Chimera.
---
Did a fresh install. Got worse.
---
At least the Scorpion doesn't suck as much as those attackers!
---
well one I wanted to post it to shame those fuckers, also this is what Reddit is for and they don’t warn me before they do it . I suddenly see vote to kick in the corner 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
Did they mention fixing crouch spamming or the sound glitch? 
---
well i gotta do 50 situps today
---
It's stupid because shotguns are statistically always worse than an smg in gun fights 
---
If they're looking at them, they get flashed. If not they don't. Doesn't need a buff. If you want them more effective use Ying.
---
The reply was sarcastic

Or you could just avoid words like "bug" "bugfix" "r6fix" without automod this subreddit would be even fuller of garbage than it already is

Very nice!

Ill rate it 3/3 emp grenades.

If you buy an upgraded version of the game (advanced edition for example) you get the benefits of that version, so you get 10 chimera packs

You called for development team members to be fired despite not demonstrating any knowledge of how software development works. My reaction to such a suggestion is not a matter of losing some context due to the wording, it's that I could not possibly disagree with that suggestion more. You are putting the blame in the one place that is likely the most gamer-friendly in the entire equation.
---
Hell, just look at your own list. What does the development staff have to do with adding microtransactions? Mouse and keyboard on console? Server locations? Policies for toxicity bans? People using Scuff controllers? Even if the rest of your list was the result of incompetence on the development team, at least half of them are clearly the result of management decisions or issues that are completely outside the control of Ubisoft entirely.
---
The only thing that makes me sad to play blitz is that i always get killd trought the shield or wrong server position. If i play against one, he is unkillable (no hit registrations).
---
I miss the old Blitz.
---
It's great fun when roaming
---
Same here, I do only the qualification rounds of Ranked, and in the last before Wind Bastion got deployed on my qualification I've had three matches with 2-stack teamkillers, and people intentionally throwing matches, like on attack its 2v2 against 2 anchors, the dude and myself are the last, he got the defuser and he climbs out on the window, from the objective room goes up to the roof and jumps down to die. I go after him thinking he was just trying to pull some messed up tactics and fell, so I revive him and he shoots me in the back for my trouble.
---
I can't leave, and the since this guy is part of a 2-stack troll brigade, kickvote will never have enough votes to get rid of him. So the best solution we could come up with is downing the trolls at the start of each round, so they could not teamkill us and do the rounds 3v5. You can imagine the results with 1 silver, 1 bronze and me being unranked yet on my qualification rounds.
---
Lol the Scorpion does not suck. The little bit I’ve used Ela I used the Scorpion and was very accurate with it.
---
Fuck House

Bad map
---
That is actually amazing 
---
Good job but you need to work more on the face
---
Nooooooooooo! shield ops are already nerfed into the ground, what they should do is put the crouching mechanical thing from csgo into leaning, and maybe crouching, but toning them down a bit. Pre-nerf blitz main speaking
---
Because it's not a call, it's supposed to be a hack. It's sole purpose is to make noise
---
There is already sign language in game

Killing 2 people per round on average is good, considering he is carrying his weight and more. What do you want him to get 3 kills per round on average in a 9 round game?
---
I mean in comparisant with his AR it’s not too bad of an option for holding long angles.
---
Of course I picked up on that and didn’t scour the comments looking for an explanation...😅😅

They have 200HP, so it's gotta be a custom game. Probably increased the lean speed to do this.

---
&gt;The bolt action 
---
There is no bolt action.  By bolt I meant a crossbow bolt.  Huntress' regular crossbow bolts do not hit through walls, but the barbed crossbow bolt *does.*  It hits through one soft wall or barricade because it's sharpened and serrated.
---
&gt;I don't think that the last operator works when it's something to pick up it must be like vigil or cav
---
It could help them quite a bit, tho.  Lion basically makes both of them useless since he prevents them from moving.  This might help, sort of.
---
Wow that's expensive. I bought mine on Aliexpress and it was 1.50€ each so I paid 10€ for 6 keychains and the shipping was free. ( It's the same quality because my Ela has a green color too instead of the blue color in the game )
---
lmfao NSFW

Yea shields are in a bad state. Inconsistent af.

I used to be a it's main like you, until I took an "operation windbastion" to the knee. They added headshots

I thought the sniper is a bolt action because it would explain the slow rof
---
Just think about it from a new player's perspective. Not all games have soft and hard walls. And even if they do its not as prominent as it is in rainbow. So i guess the wall bangs are designed to teach players about the possibility of being shot through a soft wall,  but rooms of c4s and barbed wires are retarded and i dont know what the use is tbh
---
You could've let them tattoo a smoking server on it as well. 
---
I'd love insurgency sandstorm had it not regularly drop to 30 fps on my more than powerful enough rig, I promptly refunded after trying every performance fix and trying to run the game lowest settings to no avail.

Yeah it's pretty expensive, but I've seen some for around $12 or more.

After Cav I want Glaz and IQ then I'm done(Those are all my mains lol.)

Honestly the scorpion is okay if youre able to manage the recoil
---
What happened to it? 
---
A full health year will make some players leave the game because the lack of new content.

I personally prefer a year with less new operators than a last year with 8 new operators and a lot of bugs. 
---
legendary is 3%
---
Nah, it's a semi auto.
---
It's a semi with the fire rate of a bolt action lol.  That's how it is irl, too.  It's got a *very* slow fire rate, whereas the Barrett *can* be shot in rapid succession irl(though you'd need to be incredibly strong to hold it down, and the recoil would probably fuck up your shoulder and your face real bad.)

Of course it's an abuse. Ppl who are dropshotting using the server tick rate to their advantage. The server can't handle the fast switch from standing to proneing. So while on your screen the enemy is still in standing state, on their screen they are already prone. You're basically shooting a ghost while they kill you easily. How is that not an abuse? 
---

The issue is both of those things are pretty essential for this game. If you remove team damaging then Monty becomes the strongest character in the game.

kinda is bc you are the only reason the round was won

Because now you have retards throwing themselves at you to make you kill them while shooting at something else.

Dude the shotgun is within the top 3 best shotguns on the game! This dude just didn’t have a laser on for some reason, that certainly doesn’t help with this shotgun 
---
I will again reference the rogue 9 video from about a week ago. This belief is a myth. You can’t move fast enough to actually break your characters hitbox in such a way. He actually made a second video on it where he tested to see if lag/high ping had any factor in it, and when he and his buddies ping were both over 150 he found that hitboxes could be up to 11 frames off (at 60 FPS) that’s about 1/6 of a second. Expecting any less variance than that is ludicrous, also that little variance isn’t going to noticeably effect your gameplay

Filters:
---
can be abused easily
---
can be bypassed (putting a space inbetween each letter of the n word).
---
They only did one thing to prevent "toxicity", and that was to implement a filter. So yeah, "nothing" was said at all on their part. 
---
Each piece took a little over 5hours. 10 hours 21 minutes total

Do you play pc?

How come it shows the red icon for you consistently even with a 17 ping 
---
You can argue that the tablet is targeting phones using bluetooth or mac address to tap into it so she has to be near enough to hack it. Be that as it may realism is kinda negligible in siege and this change is to balance her and to make her less easy to use.

Hopefully, fingers crossed

There's a difference between using the word fucking hell and nigger. I'm all for using fucking, shit, etc, but when you constantly spam n i 6 6 g g e r all game long, team kill, spam voice comms, down the hostage, barricade things you shouldn't, block doorways intentionally, and shoot teammates, theres a BIG difference. 
---
Is that Pagan Min in the bottom mid?
---
I see a pit of pink there.
---
Actually it depends, if you encountered an enemy off guard, you can 1-2 tap him really fast, while the SMG might just tag them.
---
But you are also right. Most fights are taken in range which makes shotguns a niche choice usually.
---

&gt;They only did one thing to prevent "toxicity", and that was to implement a filter. So yeah, "nothing" was said at all on their part.

Sorry is something the same as nothing?

So having this operator would make IQ basically OP, no? She could see every defender through walls while being able to shoot them? Does not sound fun.

Pretty retarded reason but its just me being a weird guy and wanting to enjoy games that I can't hit above 60. My eyes are really sensitive so I will always feel a difference between fps ranges when on high refresh rate , and going back to single player games was unenjoyable for me after 144hz.
---
So decided to play on 30 for a while and then up to 60, so I can enjoy most of the games again on an even ground, it will never be the same like 144hz, but better for me atm.
---
Either way I am weird and also really competitive, so I see myself giving up and turning 144hz on again.
---
That is why, literally every FPS doesn’t have toggle for that exact reason

I think another issue is that it takes too long for the server to update where your shield is compared to your end

Does the cam harm your team? Destroy it.

Doesnt it? Leave it as it is and you my still gather some intel.
---
If it happens you are able to relocate cams go for it.
---
This should be obvious, but set up your turret in common peeking spots and always run deployable shield to cover your feet. Also don’t be afraid to set up your turret somewhere else. Tachanka’s biggest weakness is that it only takes one drone to completely destroy him. If you feel like you’ve been in a spot too long, set up somewhere else. Don’t be afraid to get off your turret because sometimes it takes too long to set it up somewhere else. His guns are good enough where you don’t need to be on your turret.

Not sure if it would be very useful. So you would drop your phone to counter a dokkaebi, losing access to cameras, whilst you dont know if the other team is even running dokka? Maybe if you could drop it mid-call, make it like 1/3 of the time it takes to turn off and you could pick it back up afterwards but still had to turn it off.

Yeah, I dropped from gold two to gold three. 
---
&gt;It is NOT a statement.
---
I've asked you why you think that twice now...
---
&gt;Saying "We are implementing a chat filter in season 2" is different from "We are currently investigating new ways to combat toxicity that includes team killing, microphone spamming, etc."
---
And yet both fall under the definition of statement.
---
&gt;Yes, but there is NO direct recent statement on Toxicity, especially since it is going to kill off the playerbase.
---
And goalposts once more. We've gone from "nothing being said" to "no statements" to "those posts aren't statements" to "NO direct recent statement on Toxicity". It's a pathetic dance.

I'm saying your claim that there haven't been any statements regarding toxicity is patently nonsense. That says nothing about the community, toxic or otherwise.

&gt;Once again, you are contradicting yourself.

I doubt you even know what that means but sure, how have I contradicted myself? I guarantee this will be your comprehension ability coming into play again.

This is why I love the Reddit comments and community. It's always so much more mature and kind. If this was posted on the Rainbow Six Siege community FB page, the comments would be so toxic. I for one love that you did that for your friend, and it looks awesome!

DPS is the same, recoil is awful and very hard to control after the first ten shots or so.
---
...the Yokai doesn't cause any damage.

It just doesn't my guy. You have to damage or be the one to kill the target.

16:10 best ingame ratio. i run 75hz monitor 1080p 16:10 ingame resolution, 16:9 hardware/monitor resolution

At least SOMETHING would be nice, like saying "hold on, a fix is on the way" or SOMETHING of the sort. but as of now, I see ubisoft employees commenting on meme posts instead of actually fixing the fucking problems in this community. 
---

It's the best advice you'll get

2-3 kills per round or per game? I honestly think an op like ‘Chanka is going to peak at 3-5 kills per game, depending on what type of team you have. Chanka is a support/anchor op, and unless all enemies are somehow coming into the entrance you’ve got your turret in, you might not put up huge numbers.
---
With that said, I’ve seen some good players roam with 3 speeds and do very well. If you can learn/teach yourself to be more mobile with Chanka, you might be on to something. 
---
I’d recommend using the intel you get at the beginning of each round to meet the enemy where they’re entering. Check cams or get intel from your roaming teammates. Maybe get an early kill, then move to OBJ where you can deny from there and get some additional kills. Maybe even get a kill in transition. 
---
My apologies, that’s what I meant, drop it mid call so whilst it is ringing you drop it on the floor. That’s what I mean, you risk losing cameras but you could hold an angle on the phone to prevent a hack or a kill on yourself when an attacker rushes you
---
China
---
because not everyone is obsessed with score or kda
---
Vigil, Maestro, Bandit, Alibi, Lesion on Defense
---
Zofia, Ying, Hibana, Dokkaebi, Buck on Attack. 
---
Matimi0, easily my favourite.
---
Ubi pls fix
---
Go play ranked with ur 4 mates and think you are a good player because u got plat by exploiting this shit system. Good player!
---
Not necessary
---
&gt; (Edit: Tips other than use another character)
---
That was the only idea I had, sorry
---
You mean gambling? Cool. Cool cool. 
---
Two (2) to three (3) kills per game with Tachanka. Also, I’ll try to be more mobile, thanks for the tip.
---
&gt;This sub used to be a really nice hub for information and discussion,
---
See, this is where you're wrong. I agree with you on most other parts, but this is just false. 
---
I have been a member of this community since early beta, when we all dreamed that this would be "the next big thing". Apart from a few posts about various information about operators and game mechanics in the beta, this was a cesspool of shitty memes and low-effort karma posts.
---
I even remember ubi stating a long time ago that they "would not nerf or change operators gagdets/weapons to balance the game". As soon as they changed weapons and gadgets this subreddit was FILLED with shitposts about that.
---
You’re not alone

I'm sure this happens all the time but I just started T-Bagging next to a team mate and he joined and then 1 by 1 the whole team was just T-bagging in a circle until one of us got shot by the attackers.
---
One Elite. I don't care for the shiny gold. I like the Elite MVPs anyways plus the skins.
---
Meta abuse as in lion, dokk, etc? Because imo yes there should be a ban system to stop that 
---
Just as well the technical term for that kind of overhang is a shade sail.
---
Since Grim Sky. Also I just want to clarify that I personally don't think it sucks but it's a complete bitch to use. My friend u/Torbadajorno (this is his clip I posted with his permission) on the other hand hates the Scorpion.
---
The detailed versions of their icon have always existed, they just weren’t used as often previously.
---
Blame u/Torbadajorno
---
u know wuts ironic?lots of people like tencent for it made the mobile version of pubg.

yet its been always a company like THAT

i just dont get it why people cant see wut tencent really is.

answer: its bullshit

I can’t help in it, i’m not the writer of the article.

Inb4 massive Kapkan nerf
---
Wait wait wait... so you're telling me that rushing with Blitz, Lion and Dokk DOESN'T take skill? Well, this is news to me. 
---
Joking aside, fuck this game as of late. Congrats you can press a button each on two operators and run at people with Blitz and someone behind him for backup. So much skill required to sprint with a shield and flash people when all of the defenders are being wall hacked and giving audio cues to their whereabouts. 
---
I agree with Get Flanked that this doesn't seem intended so I don't want to sit and flame Ubi, but the idea of global abilities and how they "combo" with others should have been a concern from day 1.
---
Hey guys for our next update we are going to fix the toxicity of our game by releasing a fix that will simply remove it entirely my mind controller the players 
---
Literally unplayable ubi fix this 
---
If by "shit at recoil" you mean "doesn't even remotely attempt to control recoil", then you are absolutely correct about u/Torbadajorno.
---
I have a pretty nice projector and I never have that problem luckily!
---
Perfection 
---
Xbox One is what I use 
---
Yeah there's no real medic on attack, Finka I guess you can class her as one but she's more of boosting really and for pushes.
---
Yes by year one OP means year one dlc. Nowadays all base game ops are unlocked as soon as you buy the game.
---
You can make any gun look good playing against people like that

AMAZING!

Fixed it

Push to talk voice chat was not working for the last two nights for me or my friend. Also started to experience terrible rubber banding which was not just me but most of the players in my game shared the same experience. Annoying issues like this need to be fixed, but time and time again still happen.
---
They can, it’s not a difficult thing to block, XIMs and peripheral devices are technically against the terms of use since they trick the console into thinking its reading a controller, but it’s a keyboard and mouse. 
---
And I hope they do

---
When u get a three k and you put it on reddit.
---
Of course she was the most picked operator in the game. She had the best gun in the game by a *large* margin.
---
Then you have a very broad definition of exploit.. An exploit is a game breaking thing that gives a player an unfair advantage. Considering that it has been proven that crouch spamming doesn't actually affect anything, then it is not an exploit, and simply a good use of game mechanics..... in the case of crouch spamming, the only "unfair advantage" it would provide is if you aren't fast enough to react and aim lower, in which case; git gud.... 
---
I Think recruit thought it was a revolver because reflexes
---
I dont really care so much about how this affects my gameplay, the problem i mentioned is rather that my brain mimics these habits in other situations as well. Until now i didnt think siege would keep me apart from reaching my real goals, but now i fear that just that might be the case
---
Yeah its ridiculous how little patience people have, especially in Casual.
---
Also, *niiiiice*
---
Only one of many AC easter eggs. Its almost like both games have the same publisher...
---
Clearly u are not very aware of the issues with shields at the moment. Go do a little research then make assumptions. They are too good at getting kills and callouts, and theirs no reason not to use them and they not fun to play against.
---
Fucking stop.
---
I was new to the game when OH so I can't give a good opinion on it, only with what I've seen and heard. I never wanted a blitz buff, I'm not sure they the hell they added that bullshit. I miss Bartlett :(. And I think there's a lot of hypocrisy because the community isn't getting exactly what they want but I don't want to go into that. That's a nasty argument. Hypocrisy is ABUNDANT when it comes to COD too. I just the game to be in a better state. So much potential.
---
Would be cool. In one of the Rainbow Six Siege trailers we get to see bandits face complete win a beard and bruises
---
And that's when you "mistake" your revolver for your stim pistol. 
---
Let's just ignore the fact that he can infinitly heal which will make rushers even more deadly and roamers less
---
also the fact that he doesn't need to bait like with bomb as the attacker can still shot (for what ever fucking rason, can't remeber last time a solider was top focus while his leg is being reduced into the socket again)
---
First, you take the dinglepop, and you smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches.
---
My general rule of thumb is your reticule has got to be directly on the enemy to provide cover effectively. Doesn’t work all the time, but definitely helps. 
---
Im new here i just posted it to know how it works xddd and its a friend clip not mine 😂😂
---
Sounds about right
---
First thought, can you decrease the POV scale on that panning camera? It’s a bit offputting
---
There are more rounds as its best of 7, so first to 4, with 3-3 resulting in overtime which is a best of 3 instead of a single overtime round like casual. So a match can be as short as 4-0 or as long as a sweaty 5-4.
---
 The rounds themselves are actually shorter. 3 mins instead of 4. This aids the defensive side alot as wasting attacker time is more valuable.
---
The other main difference is you get to choose your site/spawn instead of it being random which as a new player will at least help you learn the names of the objective and get a feel for the ones that are picked first because they are the most viable. 
---
I agree that it’s in a bad spot but I think the devs are doing a great job with the operators. They just need better systems, like TKing and the fact that I can’t run through a blow up wall without rubber banding back though it, and broken hit boxes, and unbalanced maps, and the hacking, and the glitches, and and toxicity, and a bunch more things that I won’t get into, but otherwise a great game that I play every day. 
---
Athens, Ohio.
---
I don't think you should've posted this. 
---
How?
---
It's exploiting a mechanic. Just like playing lion is exploiting a broken op. It's an unfair advantage.
---
I don't think that the overheal should be permanent, because then he could just place it at the beginning of the round and all of the attackers would have a permanent 140 hp for the rest of the round. The passive ability would be nice though.
---
never thought that thats causing the issue, i realised that the cinematic looks a bit weird but didnt know how to change it. Thanks bud!
---
Yeah it's nothing against you it's just that this subreddit lost its great content and now it's just filled with complaints and mediocre gameplay.
---
I would love a delay in new ops and maps if they dedicated a whole season to fixing the game. If they don't devote then they will SLOWLY release fixes like they are now because they're so caught up with adding new content.
---
But what if it happens in Prep Phase?
---
Crouch walking needs some actual sound too!
---
Haha the only reason I mentioned rank at all is because you brought it up as if it meant anything. I refuse to believe you’ve NEVER seen any shotguns while playing this game, that’s a weird hill to die on. But it really doesn’t matter have a great day man! 
---
Compensator reduces vertical recoil too, is my point. But hey, whatever attachment works for you.
---
maybe make it a slow heal so it will be less effecitve in the moment and it will push for roaming, maybe give him 5 banages each heal for 40 (don't give you down back like doc and rook) but heal you 1 hp a second
---
Think about it from the crouch spammers perspective.. crouch spamming is gonna destroy their accuracy, because they have to multitask with aiming up and down and crouching. Realistically, any half decent player can react to a crouch spammer faster than they can properly aim on you.....

I am very aware. I hate shields. I hate playing against because of how hard it is to win a fight against them and I hate playing with them because sometimes it's just too easy to win a fight and other times you're killed through your shield. Although I would love to see a shield with no utility but meleeing. I'm curious to how that would play out in the game.
---
Better than Reddit serving to show you that you have no friends q_q
---
The community gets EXACTLY what they want, but they will never be satisfied. 
---
I want the game to be in the best state possible, but another Operation Health is not the way to go. 
---
Damn.. This clip must be like atleast 2 years old.
---
The memories, wish I could go back and have the same experience with my friends, I remember I started playing with a group of dudes around my age in the beginning of 2016.
---
Three years later I'm still playing with some of the same muppets, thanks to Ubi I guess.
---
It's not illegal and it's an easy way for good players to make money. I hate it myself but as a business model it's pretty good and that's why there are so many.

Everyone is always talking about toxicity. I solo queue a lot in casual and in ranked and I can't even remember the last time someone was toxic. PC tho.

I play it every day too but the devs are working at the slowest pace I have ever seen compared to other games. The worst part is that Ubisoft has the resources to fix this.

A whole lot of running, and screaming
---
I want the game to be in the best state too man. And the only reason I think a whole season should be devoted to fixing the game again is because without it, they will continue to SLOWLY release patches and continue to focus on adding new content. Love this game tho.
---
Again, it's been proven that it doesn't work the way you think it does.. crouch spamming with a high ping puts the crouch spammer at a disadvantage because it makes their hitbox easier to find....
---
u/battleye
---
I know that they have the same publisher... Its just because many people are wishing a Japan setting for years and it would fit well into the series so this made me curios. Wouldnt have even asked if I didnt know it was the same publisher.

Low key means that you aren’t making something a big deal or want to bring attention to it. In other words, being inconspicuous. 
---
“Let’s low key sneak into this movie”
---
=

“Let’s sneak into this movie, but don’t bring a lot of attention to yourself.”
---
As much as I hate the term, it does have a distinct meaning. 
---
Shoulda been tachanka
---
On an elite controller you spam crouch with your middle finger on the back of the controller so his thumbs never leave the sticks. And you can lean spam with your thumbs on the sticks while aiming and moving. Hes not even lean spamming in the video though. He leaned like 3 or 4 times. This is totally a controller dude. 
---
Does it vibrate ? 
---
To simulate the concussion i mean
---
Even if OP is guilty (not saying he is)  the system is flawed, the  support employee can’t make an informed decision whether to allow an appeal or not without the contents of the supposed offence or offences. 
---
It’s probably designed this way so ubisoft don’t have to answer for their own or their systems actions.
---
I’m unranked but suck at the game and I get matched with platinums in casual :(

Moar bagur

It should come out with new ops, then i would be okay with it.

geez get a room you two
---
Exactly!
---
Or maybe like a regeneration for like 20-30 sec. Maybe like 2hp per second? 
---
It was taken out of the map rotation as it only having one door entrance (the rest being windows) was considered unbalanced. Funny they decided to throw Favela back in without any reworks tho. Wouldn't be surprised if they give us Bartlett back late this year or early next year without fixing it at all.

Alternatively, Ubi can just maintain their game like everyone else, instead of, as you suggest, reducing the content of their season passes so they can make a big deal out of basic game maintenance.

Yeah doesn't he have a thicc drum mag gun?

---
I'm level 140 and playing since launch and I've only ever gotten one black ice and it was for ash and thermite's pistol
---
It'd be a waste if you have 5 or more of the operators 
---
I never noticed before
---
IMO I think it worse than hackers by a mile (in terms of the overall problem). Hackers are rare, and usually end up getting banned. We're talking about a quarter of the r6 community that uses xim's, and once you're out of gold and into plat its closer to 30-40% and even higher. And it's an issue that has no end in sight. Prob will never get fixed. It's the definition of game breaking 
---
I think they tried to balance him out by giving him literally the worst weapon in the game. Which is weird because he also has the best weapon in the game.

Damn right. I get tk’d and kicked half the games I play because I use recruit

It has. Apparently OH was *all about fixing bugs*. And even if we dedicate **an entire season** to fixing bugs, this will be just delaying the inevitable until the next season comes.

Ah, got it. Sorry to doubt you!! Those bots have got some wonky physics for real
---
Sometimes... this game...
---
I know the majority is, but you don't need a modded controller is what I meant.  Microsoft sells a controller perfectly capable of crouch spamming.
---
Yep! I love it when the roamers get their armor. :)
---
Lider's gadget sounds like a buff Castle would need for windows. But this is a cool idea.
---
I played with FO12 even when Scorpion was the best gun in the game. In my opinion Ela's shotgun is the most no-skill weapon in the game caue its super easy to make kills with it. 
---
Caveira's very high risk high reward. Her ability is very hard to pull off against competitive teams and her primaries are very weak. 
---
An attacker nullifying cams would be powerful late game if the cams somehow didn't get destroyed, whereas someone like Vigil currently is very strong early game while wasting much of the attacker time and resources on him.
---
I think a change like that is unwarranted
---
Been playing for a while I'm not great but I like to do terro hunt solo classic mode and use full auto rifles on semi. As in use a fully auto gun but switch the fire rate to semi. It helps my aim a lot and just gets more practice. (Sorry if it's explained badly)
---
On bank (in Archives) I had a Thermite go through the hatch in supply closet (by CEO office). Heard him ignite it through his remote control loud as day, the strongest "kachink" I've ever heard. Literally as if he was standing right next to me. Couldn't even hear the Exothermic Charge going off, and the explosion from it sounded like it was from outside.
---
It’s not automatic though. It means Kaid will underperform in short-range fights. 
---
I am growing tired of this game. For the last two seasons we've had bad ops. Surely, mav is strong but he's not fun to play and it's broken a few mechanics for me and for Fabien (such as defending geixas with a mira or bandit tricking). The rest came with strange weapons and mostly weak. Kaid is strong, but he is strange to use and requires a lot of dedication to get the gang of his weapons. Audio's been broken af. We are still suffering from the global meta. I've been getting disconnected far too often (both me and my friend got disconnected at the same time, so I don't think it was my internet's fault. 
---
I just take a break. I feel with any game you might get burnt out and just need a break for a few days. then you can come back with a new mindset and it seems to work itself out

Can't see why it wouldn't work, I bought mine from nuuvem on november 15 and activated on the same day.

Is that really a surprise? Reposters aren't creative enough to come up with their own content.

For whatever reason I haven’t had any audio issues that I can really notice except this. When I’m playing fuze and I detonate a charge I can’t hear it at all, and when I’m playing against fuze I can’t hear the placement or detonation sound.

I was actually thinking Needler in secondary slot while dual wielding Needlers to get 3x the ammo
---
It started with a small soundbug where you cant hear the reload sound and we are not hearing termite and fuze charges go off. I would prefer a second operation health to fix that. I do not need two broken operator every 3 months.

Just pretend you’re trying to shoot a drone zooming past their feet. You’ll land it every time. 
---
no harm done! :) but yeah the AI seems bad. Maybe not aliens colonial marines bad, but definitely still bad. 
---
The New tab
---
Forgot about those, I would say no, it wouldn't remove the buff, however those gadgets would be stronger against those who are buffed ex: Lesion 2x damage, Echo 50% longer length.
---
Imagine making a small, stealthy hole in a wall that no one knows about until they are already dead.

The downvotes are fine. It’s all fake internet points anyhow haha. 
---
I have a bunch of tattoos and I know first hand that there will *always* be people that just hate for no reason. It’s funny really. 
---
Hey have a good rest of the day dude!
---
Thanks man :) i forgot to write that not my aim is the problem thats fine
---
Some maps have places you can hop out of the map boundary to manually destroy it.

Raise the graphics settings so that GPU becomes the limiting factor to framerate.

All you need now is Tachanka diving on the hostage

Damn you have very nice concepts man
---
Maybe some southslavic ops so we can on att make squating squad?
---
All these incredibly skilled artists and shit. And all i can do is say my ABCs backwards while intoxicated.
---
I envy your talent!
---
That will happen thank you :)
---
No, it's actually the 3rd (of 5). Source: r6 patchnotes and experience
---
Happened to our whole squad and 4 of theirs only one dude was running around 1 tapping us all seemed pretty sus I just thought it was like another Castle glitch or something
---
And the map isn’t part of the season pass content. In year 2 despite operation health all season pass owners still got 8 new operators with a week early access plus exclusive uniforms and a renown boost/store discount for a year. Exactly what was advertised. 
---
I feel you lol. Happened recently on Holo room site Skyscraper, killed one guy, injured second one and was about to kill Castle with pistol and win the round but same shit happened and I died and we threw that round. FML
---
First I never implied r/dota2 is the perfect sub. I just love the game so i frequent the sub alot but no, that sub is far better than this one. Actual bugs and complaints are talked about and valve are forced to fix them up. The memes are far better and less stale and the gameplay clips actually teach some neat tricks and tips and are actually good clips rather than really bad 3k's that this sub has. The two subs are worlds apart, r/dota2 isnt the best but it's a huge improvement. 
---
Apart from that I'd just like the mods to actually do their jobs. 
---
If i see a Recruit i eith think they are crazy or messing around 
---
It looks nice, I like admiring the views. That's about it.

Got it for Christmas and absolutely love it. It’s really great for a first printer 
---
I feel like I Havnt seen an intentional team kill in months.  Granted ibsusualy play with Atleast 2 friends.... But that still opens up for 1-2 randoms. 
---
Well yeah, because despite those issues, I'm still enjoying the game and I bought it in hopes that my money goes to fixing the game while also getting new content right away as a "reward".
---
Obviously I don't speak for everyone, but that's my thought process. I obviously care about Ubi fixing the issues, but I don't think the content is "worthless" because of the current exisiting issues.
---
I'm still trying to make mine actually work tbh. 
---
thank mr skeltal 
---
That’s still a haccusation. Sorry man, I didn’t make these rules up. 
---
Its highly unlikely they will revert back to old rank logos. More ranks maybe 
---
There were multiple threads on it while it was still relevant, people just chose to ignore them because it gave them something to complain about. The original article that Ubisoft officially released showed that they were changing 4 things; The neon stripper and gambling machines on Clubhouse, the melee icons in the killfeed and pre-placed blood splatters. No where in the article did it say that the Jager Halloween headgear was getting removed nor did it say that Cav was getting changed or removed in any way, which is what the majority of people were angry about. The fact that they released the Jager headgear only a few weeks prior to the aesthetic change announcements proves that they had planned for it to stay in the game. They might not be the greatest devs, but they wouldn't have wasted the assets of the art and hitbox teams on content that would've been taken out a month later. As for what they would've done to Cav, maybe you should ask someone who actually worked on the secondary build instead of assuming a random Redditor knows everything about it. The proof is out there, you can find it if you want it.
---
I actually misstook my gun for a stim pistol
---
I've had an issue where I press the Xbox button to check the party chat and see who's online, I'll have no sound when I go back on the game, and then it just stops and I have to reset 
---
Recoil is better on the para 
---
Cause the person with bigger lag makes the game a bit too glitchy 
---
Look at cavs icon.

Damn

I once fuzed a room without knowing the hostage was inside there. 
---
LOL🥺

Pro league uses him a bit. If you want to see good games with him watch either Faze vs pain or Faze vs ninjas In pajamas 
---
Well, it **is** a knife. A finger doesn’t grow from there under that angle. 
---
What’s wrong? When i first got started i quickly figured out how minor changes and mistakes can cause the printer to not work properly
---
r/3dprinting and r/MPselcetminiowners are good for getting help 
---
first thought it was a dildo &gt;_&gt;
---
Wow
---
Yeah the community is way worse, no TS, patches are slower (slightly).
---
I actually love the concept of Lider. So many possibilities with his gadget. 
---
Serious question.... How would 2 factor ever prevent hackers? 
---
Save and get $100 in-store credit when you sign up for Walmart Visa credit card!

That’s kinda why I don’t think we’ll get Israeli operators. Ubi gave them a nod, and it probably won’t go any farther. It’s a shame tho, considering the Israelis basically founded modern counter-terrorism
---
She needs a pipe and can of spinach. 
---
Don’t hope for a Ubi rep to see it **here**. 
---
Resume the chat and demand explanation or refund. If nothing happens, threaten them with a  trial. 
---
Well I have my print bed as level as I can get it with the star screwdriver tool they include and I can get it to start printing the cat that was loaded on the sd already. The pla I believe it was didn't want to stick to the bed. I tried turning the speed down and it still came off. I'm kinda brand new to this so I guess I can go to those reddits thanks
---
Console has some really cancerous players but I've never had any latency issue. I dont know why people complain about this game everytime they have some bad luck, just enjoy this masterpiece of a game
---
Lots of people forget or weren’t around when  that copper through diamond were the original designs before the updates .... and I miss the way they changed back then. I can dig this . Take my upvote . 
---
More broken than IQ’s nails being the wrong color #notmynails #purpletarpsmatter

Frost
---
I did that the other night on accident. Had been playing FO4 prior, and tried to crouch
---
Use illustrator instead. This is a waste of CAD. 
---
I've had this happen too many times
---
Idk about that one chief 
---
Same here I simple don't enjoy the game anymore and nothing feels rewarding. Its disappointing to see what Ubi is doing to the game. Every death feels like I had no control over and was unfair. Every kill feels like I out cheesed the enemy and he didn't deserve to die. Just the other night we lost because my game lost because my game broke and I was termite in consulate while the team was holding basement and didn't know how to bandit trick. I think you get the picture.
---
All in all I feel like I'm fight the game more then the enemy players. I no longer hold angles cause I get punished due to peekers advantage. I no longer roam because ubi has added ops like doki and nomand that allow players to counter roamers with no effort or skill. If they don't speak up or improve real soon this is will be last time I'm giving this game a chance. Lifes short and as much as I admire people that stick through thick and thin I would tell them it's just not worth it. You can be passionate for a game but don't give your life to it if it doesn't deserve your passion.

cons outweigh pros in this matter

Know who u feel

What?  You shoulda bought it.
---
Hey im unbanned
---
One thousand times yes. And with that they can add Operation "speaking more with the community"
---
So you’re saying Ash is invincible than since she can’t lose any gun fights lol

Karma for spawnpeeking.

This post is bum.  Why not have the lion scan go off while everyone is opening renown packs
---
I wish it was that simple, it works in all games, apps and everything else other than siege, I'm even on a fresh install on a new ssd and it still doesn't work, I don't think it's on my end.
---
Mood
---
Happy birthday mate
---
No, Im saying based on stats alone she will win gunfights, theres other things other than gunstats that matter, like hp and headshots and getting the jump, but her gun, in a fair 1v1, will always win
---
I don’t understand your question, it’s all one game is it not ? I’ve had it since Y1 and don’t even know what you mean 
---
Thank you!

I didn't know that about laser sights... I've been playing the game for a few months now. That could explain a few odd moments of "how did he know i was there" 
---
Lesion
---
no, i was refering to the old one, check the link I added
---
Hands are too shaky my guy, it runs in the family 
---
Depends on what your playstyle is man, trap Operator you can’t go wrong with Frost/Lesion. If you prefer to roam around Lesion is still decent as he has impact grenades but I’d say Vigil is the superior roamer these days. Echo/ Mira typically stay anchored. Those are my top picks though if that helps at all lol 
---
You should give her infinite doc syringes that auto shoot her every 5 seconds
---
Yeah, sometimes I gain otherworldly skills when playing as recruit as a joke. Especially when I can get the whole team to do it. Skills never last more than a round though.
---
Thats how i thought it was when i first learned about lion
---
That's good like
---
Laser Sights are only useful when running handguns, Maestro's Alda 556 and shotguns.
---
 me thinks you might be the one that got wooshed here but then again...
---
Fbi gets the five seven and that things mag is ridiculously big and no recoil. Combine that with a 2 speed shield and its pretty competitive.
---
idk, i feel cheated. i could've gotten the dlc ops first and waited another few months before getting the rest for free.
---
They're going to rework him and hopefully BB is next
---
I know I know, its been the same with every Christmas skins apart from the blue one
---
Just let me add you dont see flashes in killcams, so she probably was blinded and landed a lucky shot on you while your shield was desynced.
---
“Ouch, I’m stupid”
---
Or it just makes sound
---
They better not change anything with his damage for his weapons. I will never touch lion if they fuck him up like they did Ela
---
Good idea but i feel it would also make it under powered as you don't know how many are in a room so maybe make like three throwables but they are 2.5 seconds and start on contact and the field of view is smaller
---
2x R6S World Champion lol
---
and flash immunity!
---
Why does his mouthpiece look like he's doing a weeb face?
---
What key would it be bound to? Also there are no more inputs available on console controllers.
---
So you're trying to tell me that 2 years ago consoles had the capability to save high quality clips and yet we still see people uploading cellphone clips of their TV?
