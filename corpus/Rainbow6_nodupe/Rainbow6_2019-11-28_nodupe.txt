That was absolutely hilarious. What level were they?

We need a frost mat

I have it for this, M870, MP5, and Thermite's AR
---
i don’t agree with this tbh. i have bad (and frankly, i don’t care about it) k/d but sometimes i just don’t want to play on a certain map or be with toxic teammates. casual is meant for people to chill out and have fun, if i’m not having fun why shouldn’t i be able to leave?
---
yeah

And Ella’s grzmot

I've been playing for about a year and have been able to solo queue to plat. I do not play any sort of support role when I solo queue because I can't trust my teammates to help me get my job done.  I don't necessarily just pick Ash and Jaeger every round either. It's honestly a lot harder because success really tests your ability to adapt. Every round the op I choose is based on the rest of my teammates, and what I do in the round is based on their positioning. Basically to solo queue into plat you really need to understand the overall strategy of a site from both attack and defense, mostly because at that elo the other team is making plenty of mistakes too and you need to capitalize on that to win.
---
fuck off boomer
---
If anyone is seen with the ash elite chibi or duck charm it qualifies as a copper session, nothing to see here folks. Just some big brain boys tryna reach silver!
---
Not really especially with the price reduction. I feel the initial increase to 1k per Pathfinder operators actually was a good idea too.
---
What is this subreddit for then?
---
cringe
---
A 3 day booster. Weak
---
Honestly at this point I've just given up so have my mates. All we want is a fun competitive game we are happy to lose but when its literally 10 games in a row with with smurfs rather is just no point
---
Honestly super well done
---
Its not leaving itself is bad, but more like leaving just to save their k/d.
---
Yep, I can play Casual but not with friends.
---
Um, English is not my first language but I think its called a 'pun'.Technically.
---
Not REALLY new, been watching Therussianbadger for a year now and I have IQ, Mute, Smonk, Kapkan, Thatcher, Thermite, Ash, Blitz, Monty, Tachanka and recently Buck
---

---
My other 2 options are either Dokkaebi or Lion
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
The pathfinders for 1k that’s fine and dandy, but from 1k to 15k to 20k and so on is a big jump
---
Very nice
---
A'ight then brother you couldn't let me proud for a sec?
---
A lot of the time, it completely changes the colour scheme. If I see a blueish colour I know it'll be French, If I see  muted greens I know Spetsnaz, Gray Casual GSG9, Bright yellow CBRN. Problem is when Kapkan is completely blue and I misidentify. 
---
It's not just not knowing half the time, it's thinking they're someone else and that can lead to a situation being handled incorrectly.

What’ wrong with the chibi? I payed big quids to get that bundle and fuck me if I ain’t gonna use it.

Bless you
---
Low levels, not even ranked probably
---
10k per most year ones at this point. And the price goes down every season not to mention its to give you a chance to adjust to older operators before throwing new ones at you. I personally think it's fine cause it's not much if you play a good bit a day or every couple days. Plus Christmas last year they gave I think 2 free ops away.

Sorry pc 😅

Yes thats what i wantes to say. Everything is ok and working,the only problem is that we can't play with friends....

If you got put on a team with cheaters it makes sense

What changed with the lighting?

Imagine being a grown ass man and still throwing out the "THE GAME IS CHEATING!" excuse lol.

honestly though it sort of works out... should there be a warning to new players yes of course and should smurfs even exist nope but it keeps the smurfs away from casual which is good in a sense

Wouldn't mind if it counted as a death if you're alive at the end of a losing round in ranked.

The EDD won't detonate. It will only be triggered for shield vaulting at waist level

Literally played a match with a blitz who had a diffuser, was siting in A with no opposition for ages and he passed by multiple times without going in, I tried mic, messaging, even trying to get his attention by crouching and knifing him and all he did was go up and down the stairs. I finally had enough and decided, I’ll just shoot him and take the diffuser this lvl 2 is gonna blow us the match... I take one shot and he whips around to headshot me, it’s now him another random and one enemy in B. The two randoms on my team get in a fire fight with each other and kill themselves. Cut to Doc hiding in B cowering for his life.

Is the red stuff hot cheetos?

Who tf does he only have 10 wins

Mute. The man never talks. That is the greatest kindness any human could show me.

This definitely has to do with Trump and MAGA. What connection does Maverick have with gas??

Low key gives me anxiety when I see that someone hasn’t grabbed their vest

Ah, but people have been complaining about this for years! And they fixed problems such as the voice chat breaking before desync, despite them becoming  a thing after. Try again I guess?

Wha... HOW ARE THEY THAT BAD?!?

So we have have a fullstack of plat-dias and we play together time to time, we didn't play this much together this season and today we logged to see that each of us lost around 400+ mmr, none of us got banned

I lost 481 pts

and yeah, picture..

How does this dumb system work? Is everyone in soloq cheating?

If the wall behind the clash when she was down wasn't reinforced, there's a chance that the fuze could have used his cluster to maybe have the nades bounce off the wall behind it and blow open the door, but idk.

Mute or kapkan. Don't mind my bias towards kapkan.

Idk, I'd get a drink with castle he sounds chill in his bio

Oh sure i just played cs since 1.6 but go a head. 
---
Copy as in copy the gameplay not the bloody gun code. If r6s moves to a new engine, they'll have similar complains as cs got with the source and go changes. 
---
&gt;If Ubi had foresight or cared they would have addressed this issue originally
---
This is not a "issue" for the majority of the high skill playerbase at the start of the game. This isnt a issue for the majority of playerbase now since the majority is the casual playerbase. 
---
Just like bullet holes arent a issue for the majority of the playerbase but in higher skill games, they are broken and op. 
---
&gt;It has gone through many sponsored events and has reached out to the
---
Has nothing to do with bug fix priority. 
---
&gt;the devs couldn't be fucked.
---
Right cause thats why the game has one of the most aggressive content update roadmap for competitive fps games in the market.
---
&gt;Do you think smokes don't exist in CS? 
---
Where the fuck did i say that. 
---
&gt; What about unique advancements like B-hopping, strafe-jumping, run-boosting, and an entire economy for skins and an in game economy for weapons.
---
That is nowhere near as complicated as the map design, destruction and how different operators can change the maps in r6s.

---
this is a pretty volatile thread, so i’ll try to explain it in a civil manner
---
making something server side means they need to update every single server with the new debris code, which is a lengthy process that requires server downtime
---
it hasnt happened until now because it wasnt seen as as big of an issue as it actually is until recently
---
Yeah that's the reason i asked
---
Yeah I think so
---
Because those bugs affected higher amount of player in the game. Majority of the fucking playerbase doesnt even know or care about the barricade debris issues in r6s. 
---
This is a higher skill issue with is limited to a smaller amount of players. This issue isnt being ignored, its activatly being fixed and is ETAd for next year.
---
No, it’s a simulation for them to practice
---
We know

You literally have "fuzenew" in your flair. Oh geez, I wonder what that means!

Yeah doesn’t Thatcher despise Lion for some reason? Probably those damned unmanned drones.

From what I understand, its just training. The bad guys are the terrorists.

So you must be pretty good with her?

Red dot best sight. Fite me.

This is how you do it, you go Lord Tachanka and one friend goes clash and another can be anyone with a deployable shield you use the shields and the clash rotates as you tell her.

It really doesn't accomplish anything though...

How good is your aim?

I tried to main her, but with that smg getting kills is so luck based, and I don't like relying on luck. I don't want the human A-10 Warthog back, but something remotely controllable.
---
Bosg is a meme
---
He’s cracked
---
git gud
---
🤡
---
If you wanna be competitive, don't use any of them, if you wanna just fuck around, it doesn't matter which one.
---
Yeah, I would love to use her on defense, but kills with the Scorpion are so luck based.
---
To explain this ill tell a story:
---
Console player, fyi.
---
I am a casual player (still am) but one fateful day I wanted to play ranked. So i joined a match mid game as echo. The score was 0/2.    I was setting up my yokai, deployable shield, etc when the mozzie starts looking at me like he is gonna tk me. I set my yokai up then i get downed my the mozzie then our frost kills me. Next round, I pick buck and kill the frost from last round then they message me saying i was a big baby and salty.     
---
Why did they do this? Because i had no kills.  
---
People are toxic because they think they are better than you when their brain is a deflated balloon.
---
Lets cut out my internet so I don’t lose and don’t get ban.
---
Yet they still pull the W.  Take notes, this is how you win games.
---
What play level is this?? As in, what is your rank?
---
Cav main to I love it what I mean is only a cav main would say that
---
Vigil 100%
---
yeah, it makes the game looks fake, textures as well, compare new kanal with the original. it looks very cartoony

I’m a big fan of compensators too. Yeah, I full auto compensator. Helps mitigate horizontal recoil. But point is, it’s not to say suppressors are the best. I’m just saying it’s a viable option that people should experiment with.
---
Agreed
---
*Flexes in google fiber*
---
You still 3 shot chest down 1-2 armor operators. Same as non suppressed. Furthermore, three operators take 4 shots to kill either way, so suppressors are better. I used to run extended but fights don’t happen more than 18 meters away. That’s why I take suppressors.
---
I mean...

What is that?

1. Depends on what you are using. Console having varying matchmaking times and IDK about PC. I suspect PC wait times aren't that long. Xbone matchmaking doesn't take too long, I usually cancel my search and restart matchmaking if it takes longer than 5 minutes (rarely). For playstation I've heard it takes ages when its off peak hour. 
---
2. Nope don't think so. The company plans to reach 100 operators so we've got a long way to go
---
3. Characters are unlocked the same way by everyone, either through renown which is earned by playing the game or by purchasing R6 credits. I grinded all the operators but it can take a while to get the special ones since they cost a bit more (25k renown for new ops, they decrease in value once a year passes - to about 20k then 15k i think). The same maps are available to everyone, there are some map rotations though so if you don't see a map for about a month, you might run into it again. There are bundles for skins and alpha packs (basically lootboxes) these can be bought with either renown or r6 credits. Alpha packs cost about 12k renown so it isn't really worth it. 
---
4. Depends on the gaming platform honestly. Console communities are very toxic, I haven't played long enough on PC to find out if they are too but I do hear there are a lot of hackers on PC. Console is virtually impossible to use hacks but toxicity is still there. Reverse friendly fire (where if you shoot someone or kill them the next time you try to harm a team mate it will damage your player instead) has helped in reducing the amount of team killing. Vote kicking players at random is still a thing though (or if they fail to clutch a round or don't follow whatever strategy the others have planned). 
---
5. I think so but don't quote me on it. Ping shouldn't be an issue as long as it isn't up past 300-400. I used to have terrible internet so I consider that to be good ping lol. Now I have about 30-100 ping max which I consider to be within the normal range. If you plan on playing competitively, you do want to have good ping because some of the headshots that don't affect your target or happen to hit you through an indestructible wall can be a pain. 
---
6. You can buy whatever weapon/character skins and charms you want in the game through a bunch of options. Either they are available with renown, R6 credits, alpha packs, or during events. They can be bought in bundles (sometimes you have to buy them like that) but these are all somewhat expensive. Even though I have all the operators I'm still saving up for new ops rather than buying skins because some skins are the equivalent to buying a whole new operator (25k), less than an op (15k), or twice the amount (50k). The numbers are approximates but I don't consider skins to be very valuable. I take what I get from alpha packs (which you get after playing a certain amount of games). 
---
Good luck with your adventures, I hope this helped! :)

The map is no longer in ranked, but there are some good spots on defense. While defending on the 2nd floor there are many long hallways and angles that you can hold. If you hold those angles, you should do pretty well. Hope this helps, thanks.

Mute's is the MP5K-PDW.

so it is the Navy? they look pretty different, maybe rook's is just heavily modified?

He still plays. Just lost that account. He didn’t pay for that account though. What I learned from it is that there’s no such thing as hackers being banned and also, there’s a lot more closet cheaters than people may think.

right? i always find people saying there’s a correlation between the two but obviously not...

Also don't forget armor ratings.

Previously, I think 2 armor would've made it a 4 shot, and 3 armor definitely 4 shots. Now, I think only 3 armor will survive the first 3 shots.

What do you mean ? Basic operators are FBI, GIGN, GSG9, SAS and Spetsnaz. What people get with standard edition? Echo, Mira and so on? They get the Basic one (from wiki:  Basic Operators are all operators that aren't introduced with any DLC e.g. Ash, Twitch ect. )

This is very wholesome. I’m assuming you’re a newer player. wait til you realize that players spawn nearby there too so you can use it in day to day matches.
---
My god. I miss it being that easy. Now I to go pro every game to keep up with everyone.
---
It for sure was different
---
At the time I hated it but now I miss it. I always went tank hunting.
---
Not on Mars but on Europa
---
Why are you so toxic? I guess you play Blitz and Clash and can’t get any good at siege.
---
I mean, I got a headshot through the wall cause I was mag dumping with an lmg, but are you talking like, 1 shot perfect every time?
---
Lol loser I got ela
---
Just cause you got wall banged doesn't mean a hacker
---
Mostly at higher ranks yes. Encountered a fresh lvl 1 hacker teleporting all over the place in casual. Your stats won't matter, and you'll get an MMR rollback
---
Haha lmao we trapped this looser
---
Vigil: YALL REALLY LOVE BULLSHITTIN HUH? ITS A WRAP
---
I think I've seen you on the Apex Legends sub, but I really want to know what 3D printer you use for all your stuff. Shit looks amazing!
---
lmaooo
---
"this is a repost"
---
"why"
---
Siege was a TDM. They just removed the tags.
---
Now if you don't have the patience to wait for the next round, then son, this game ain't for you.
---
No one plays unranked, so yeah you won't find a game if there are no people it can match you with
---
Yes, because leaving a major decision in the hands of a random group of people is *always* the right thing to do.
---
Obligatory /s.

Hello MrHasNoFace, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e2um5t/i_got_bored_and_started_drawing_rainbow6_operators/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They actually patched that within the last month because it was never an intended thing, but there's a new similar method with 1 extra step now that still works. Hopefully that will be patched too.
---
You commented twice
---
I literally just made this like an hour ago so sorry if someone beat me to it
---
Can't hear it well from this vid. :/
---
Most likely it won't since when you vault over a shield the vault animation would place you further ahead and you'd miss the EDD. Pengu had a video a few days ago where that happened. I haven't tried it myself, but it makes sense.

When y4s4 live on normal servers?

It's called a smurf

Yeah sure

If so, that’s even more evil
---
I've been playing for just over a year. Only 2 people online willing to squad up. Maybe because I'm low silver, but finding friends is not as easy at it sounds.
---
Well there it is, if you join a party they get your IP, so they ddos you personally. Tip for next time: don't join a party from enemies

Similar problem, but in every game!!!!

he either ace the entire enemy team or die within the first 10 seconds
---
I mean, your teammate could have just killed him and saved you, but this was neat too
---
Probably the type to always ban blitz whatever rank he is
---
This is sad. You straight up copy someone’s meme and after you get called out instantly you pretend you didn’t steal it. Just fuck off please.
---
Because people don't want to see someone brandishing a gun in public?
---
lmao yikes

Finka because of the recoil assist and extra health.

I wasnt trying to be toxic lmao, its a good drawing, but I've never liked this shotgun because of how much elo it has cost me over the years.

It would be pretty cool to paint it or something to make it look reinforced.

Ah okay that's nice. If they jive well with me I will definitely shoot them (Heh) a friend invite so we can play more together
---
Loved it hahah - for sure :)
---
Hey I know this is an old post, but I was just wondering how you ended up liking this monitor for siege? Any pros and cons?
---
Ok.
---
Oh a poll? Where cen i make one? Here on reddit where i get downvoted for just an simple opinion? On other side, have you held a poll so you know that mod would not be popular?  Me personaly have 2 friends who have also quited siege even earlier then me and they would play something like TDM or like rush from BF.  
---
So there are 3 people in just one neighbrohood of one city in the whole world.
---
Well you have 3 hit kills for sure, but you still need to think about damage drop off and damage to legs etc.
---
I only really use suppressors on weapons with a low fire rate, as weapons with high fire rates generally dont have high damage, and the damage i lose is significant to me cause my aim is dogshit.
---
Yeah grammar means nothing on Reddit,a text based platform
---
How can you even prove that I could understand the text with or without grammar mistakes?
---
This, it may seem near perfect at close quarters but even with a good amount of recoil control and the weapon is still pretty inconsistent.
---
I only put supressors to handguns to take out cameras...
---
but its not only in oregon there are more maps with that bug
---
yea its coming out next season
---
Does a suppressor have additional damage drop off? Is there somewhere with all of the data?
---
Thanks
---
This was beautiful
---
Feel free to correct me but a 2 armor operator will not be a 3 hit kill because of the 10% damage reduction for Exemple (36-3.6=32.4)
---
And isn't there falloff damage reduction because of distance too?
---
Damage reduction because of surface penetration?
---
I think when you take into account the damage reductions there is always a reason not to take a suppressor.
---
Git gud
---
u/Sobulonul
---
FUN FACT: In the original pre-alpha during inital concept development, sheilds could actually do a running charge through a soft wall.
---
idk it fucking sucks
---
And swallows
---
I honestly couldnt tell you, cause i really only play cause i enjoy it, im not very competitive.
---
But i believe it does have additional damage drop off.
---
Ill edit this comment with a link to a guide.
---
Smoke
---
Whats in the cattister ?
---
But he can only deny hard breaching on 1 full wall. I said that if he uses both panels to cover a wall it will only cover one reinforced wall.
---
Also blitz was supposed to spawn in during prep phase
---
I think i might even have less, I always solo que, love it.
---
whadaya the quote police?

He was grooving :(
---
You do have school shootings all the time.  And other shootings all the time.  Whose side are you on?  You seem to be arguing for me
---
Happy Thanksgiving
---
I don't think that you can "upgrade" to a better version of the game
---
Ok that makes sense and thanks for the feedback
---
Not the quote police, but literally every discussion about anything even remotely motivational, they add that. Hell, I see that even in companies today.
---
We don't have school shootings all the time. Where are you from?
---
Falloff, different dmg depeding of armor rating, body shot or leg shot and another important... That smol extra dmg can be the difference between instantly killing somebody with bodyshots or just injuring him.
---
Amk türk var arkada
---
I thought pre-alpha blitz could spawn in prep phase. I didn't find anything about shields going through walls.
---
is it confirmed that they are actually going to buff the scorpion though?
---
That's if the defense is using microwave speakers. 1v5 in prep phase, there's actually no legitimate way the blitz could win unless defense is dud.
---
Türkiye, Ankara'dayım ve Türküm amk.
---
Are these centers popular in turkey? That would explain why so many turkish people have a shit ton of background noise in voicechat
---
If you can handle the slightly higher recoil then no
---
So they should kill defenders that are detected and are pinged live to all of attack?
---
How do you miss shots on somebody who's location you already know?
---
You do.
---
Yes. Honestly the only problem with thew scorp is just the rng kicks it occasionally gets, kinda like the smg12 too. Still good tho.
---
Yo it's a 3 second timer. Not 5. It used to be 5. They cut it down to 3.
---
NP dude
---
My post history has quite a few of these moments lmao. So I guess I would be that kinda retard to try it 🤣
---
Oh yeah I remember the free trial, and yes what you said is true, but I'm more excited about it due to the fact that it gives the players something more to play for and to progress through even though r6 isn't a free to play game or a game that needs something like that to make them more money, and I don't think it will affect those who don't want it and that it has a strong player base, as I always hope r6 stays the way it is when it comes to transactions in the game to always stay cosmetic stuff and not more than that
---
why should we balance the game around people who dont know the game and solo queuers in a team game?
---
People always forget that this sub is for all rainbow games.
---
I would rage quit this match . A small price to pay for salvation

Why alibi of you use her skins it gives you away

Why should this be the case for them all?

Why are you this horny

200 hours in and i havent gotten a true ace other than the 2 i got when it was a 5v3

Players should know basic knowledge regarding siege, maybe if they can't remember the exact name for it, they can find other variables that will help them recognize said spots. Regardless, siege players always adapt to changes and this might help those players that use jackal but not care enough to know the necessary calls, now they gotta know, and if they still don't know, the room name, floor, and meters in HUD will help them, they only need to relay that information,
---
Its meant to punish players(teammates included) that don't communicate, or rather, if you want to play Jackal, you should know the callout. So next time someone wants to play Jackal, they gotta think twice, do they really want to pick Jackal over other operators in the game or stick to it.

There is evidence with data provided that trap ops have a high win-rate for the most part and this has been a trend for a few seasons now. 
---
All equipment can be seen but audio cues are scattered through the game for clear feedback to players. 
---
This change is the most basic, low intel counter to traps for all ops, with others excelling more. 
---
We need more universal counters. How is that contradicting what I said?
---
Great Game but extremely toxic community

&gt; There is evidence with data provided that trap ops have a high win-rate for the most part and this has been a trend for a few seasons now.

And?
---
&gt;We need more universal counters.
---
Because you said you shouldn't have to be taking certain ops to deal with them.
---
You're still not actually giving a reason why this change would improve the game.
---
No.
---
Yes, they still realize content since 2015
---
Yes, make him have a super jump on defense. It could be like a bump mine in CS:GO

So? It still happens. And the teammate who drops in a premade would get the penalty aswell.

There's no way to make that idea work. No exceptions is the only way

It’s not missing any GSG9 ops. Maybe you’re thinking about Lion, and Finka. They’re colors are similar but they’re a totally different unit than GSG9
---
Funny enough, we are on console (which I was planning to get my pc soon)
---
First the government now dokkaebi can see my phone
---
that would have been nice but it’s too late now.
---
How did the round end?
---
Thing is, I feel they do need to do something with traps but mainly lesion and maybe Ela. They should either lower their effectiveness but keep them hard to locate or make them easier to locate but keep their strength. 
---
This is all my opinion so I could definitely be wrong here. I just want more cues for more gadgets so a skill gap can develop
---
No way

Well it's a few months late but thanks Ubisoft 👍
---
It is temporary you can just remove it yourself it's more of a stall to prevent rushes rather than downing you permanently, like I said I'm still tweaking it so I will probably up the health when it's taken out by yourself, only notification you get of a trapped operator is the sound and the points if you are playing as Kumiho
---
How many times has it happened to you
---
I've been wanting to ask, how is it possible to get so low in mmr. Unless you've been throwing
---
*Throw more grenades*
---
*amaru
---
Then what do you do about the people who take a very long time to load in and delay the game from starting?
---
Don't play it. Stick to the Ranked playlist.

Countless. literally countless. It's insane how impatient humans can be that they would be willing to ruin somebody else's game for a few extra seconds.

Too many

Because he is? He isn't 707th SMB he is the 13th SMB also known as a Decapitation Unit plus its my OC not all OCs are made to be put into gaem standards

No. It’s a time limited skin. Didn’t buy it? Too bad.
---
Had the same thing when I played siege for almost 200 hours is 3 months. I went to school and wanted to shoot the security camera.
---
Clearly not an SAS main. Any real main would say SMG.
---
Needs more white detailing to look like an actual op icon.
---
Or they could make it so the game won't add anyone to the match while in the select screen so there aren't insainely long wait times unless you vote kick the person that just joined
---
Ah yes, a bandit main. You’ll be okay, not everyone has ssd or good internet
---
Wrong but go off
---
That’s not very freedom of them
---
Dont judge a bread by its ginger
---
I’m not wrong though. You’re just in denial.
---
I can go back to being a fuze main and get an ace on my own team
---
What about when you join an ongoing match and you instantly get  tied and kicked because your team is a 4 stack of friends
---
Lol
---
No but I do judge ginger by it's bread.
---
Its just a bope outfit

This subreddit is just console casual noobs who get a glow up in 1 round... seriously look at this, doc with holo and suppressor?

Why tho? No relation to her backstory at all, i mean at least a tiny bit of backstory...

I'm pretty new here but if operator prices decreases what happens to the operators that are already 10000 renown. Do they decrease even more or do they stay at 10000
---
Obligatory ‘get good’ comment.
---
Just don’t play casual.
---
Yeah where your from probably has people plowing into crowds with vehicles and fertilizer bombs. So much better
---
It was a limited time skin afaik. Personally I’d like to see a new holiday skin
---
It happened last night and I was carrying in ranked the 3 games before (somehow and was winning.) And all I needed was to take Blackbeard. I tried to run out on him and he killed me. I felt like throwing everything at the wall after that.
---
Russia proud
---
Suppressed MPX? You’re a bold one.
---
You sound sad
---
Bruh.
---
The guy took a billion years to ads, not a spot where you can get killed before u can ads.
---
Bruh?
---
Only denial here is gingerbread skins
---
My favorite skin is black ice for the m870 because you can glitch it onto either the 416-C or the mp7;)
---
Wrong.
---
Flair checks out
---
Ik I forgot to say but it was a Blackbeard that was last and he killed me.
---
Ubi: let's release an elite skin for Ela, as she is one of our most popular ops
---
Also ubi: lets nerf her gun that doesn't have ridiculous recoil to the point that its useless from 10 feet away, making her useless in most situations, thus plummeting her usage rate more
---
????

It was limited time. It’s gone isn’t it?

one time in school, i saw a camera like this and i started moving my thumbs thinking my controller was in my hands
---
Oh really why didn't I think of that maybe you just don't want to play ranked or for newcomers
---
You were leaning the wrong way a lot of the time. Also when you killed the second downed person in the frost mat, you shouldn't have switched to your pistol. If someone had rounded the corner at that point you woukdve died. May I ask what rank this was in? Good clip though
---
You spin my head right round right round
---
I hate people in general, but those especially
---
Unranked is where it’s at.

Every operator icon somehow goes out of or breaks the box a little bit.

Oregon isnt on beginners playlist

I’m glad our family is getting such great recognition, lord Chanka needs to see this post

I always want to destroy the cameras bc I feel like I'm going to get spotted

Is that even the R4-C for that matter?

Yeah it was tough

But what if you just want a quick match

I was in a shopping center and there were 3 of those in a row

Free points
---
Not all. The recruit doesn’t
---
if you switch off your drone then back onto it you can get the points

Is that an overwatch reference on a rainbow six post?!!? Those games can never be together! The toxicity would be far to much for this world to handle!
---
True that. As long as you are with people is fun. I wouldnt see any reason to stay if it was a solo.
---
You are technically correct.  The best kind of correct.  However recruit is a special case as he is not a typical op.
---
This hits hard😂
---
Hmm if I recall they already lowered their strength. They used to be way stronger before.
---
Oh I guess I read it wrong
---
Well if you ruin the game by making me wait for you to load it’s not my fault. I know many people will disagree but I’ll take the downvotes
---
700 hours since August 2017. Hibana is my most played attacker with 35 hours and jager is my most played defender with 38 hours

Nah he's just *vibin*
---
My sweetest friend
---
No, it’s big BRIAN time
---
Because he gadget takes away almost all control from the players, and most Elas just sit around a corner with their shotgun, and bait the mines. I'd say Nomad is the same, but after her gadget is expended, she plays like any other attacker who has used all their utility up; she doesn't just sit and bait her airjabs.
---
No,you take my upvote.
---
You kinda look like a Lion in camo suit (the animal not the operator)
---
As a glaz main, this puts a smile on my face
---
It doesn't have a different drop off but the shown damage rating is only for 1 armours shot in the chest. If it's a 3 armour you'll be talking about 5 shots
---
I just almost had a stroke reading the title...

Dude, people are allowed to play whatever and however they want. I play on whatever platform my friends are on and enjoy mixing up attachments and weapons to get some variety out of the game.

Warden cause I’m banking on Ubisoft on buffing him to the point where he is broken. They love doing that to operators that aren’t good. Plus he looks cool as fuck.
---
Shes so easy to deal with though. Unless it's a coordinated squad then shes good

You didnt even hide the laser, this is just playing against morons

color is literally a hard miss, true color is forest green, a deep green.

Do you regularly run out of bullets? I don't.

agree

Ya'know, I really don't care what rank you are. All I have to really say is to stop being a dickhead. Just cuz someone isn't a certain rank doesn't mean they're trash. Now if only you'd be smart enough to see that.

Then don't play it
---
Ya I use Bandit a lot
---
I feel like if it requires hard breach, there's some spots where there's simply no other way inside and you'd turn it into defending like a single window or worse, not being able to get in at all in a casual game if no one took hard breach. This is the big risk with doors.
---
How did you make the helmet? I'm planning to do a Jager/bandit cosplay.

 And her face structure

Omfg whatever. I'm not spending more time trying to argue with a 5 year old.

The fuck is RS6 i ahev never heard if it
---
You’re just getting unlucky then homie, I’m new too and have put in around 50 hours. In those 50 hours I’ve been team killed less than 5 times.
---
Yup agreed

I play on Xbox

Pretty much any sane person has a justifiable reason for denying it.

I would watch that instead of shooting

Ok let's look at other 1st world countries. Like the UK. Which has knife and acid attacks every day. Let's look at Hong Kong, who's people are being shot by their own government because they can't defend themselves, let's look at France (Civil War/no guns), Chile (civil war/no guns), Venezuela (civil war/no guns). Hmmmm seeing a fucking trend here? Yall are laughable. Now let's look at areas in the US who have high gun control. Chicago (massive crime rate/no guns), Compton, California as a fucking whole! Shut your stupid ass up and become educated you fucking sheep. Look at history and tell me I'm wrong with governments who take away their citizens weapons. I'll wait. Also, before you go saying I'm some boomer, White supremacist bigot xenophobic whatever the fuck you're gonna say next (because that's the kinda person you are) ill let you know I'm a 23 year old Mexican man who loves the United States and all our rights, and I don't want it to become a shit hole. Thanks ok bye.

One of the narrative points in Rainbow is having cutting edge technology to be used in life threatening situations. I don't think having 4 camera feeds at once would be more technical than a near-invisible poison mine that automatically injects needles into enemies when stepped on. And I said that the operator can unroll two of these sheets to cover one full reinforced wall meaning it would take both uses of the ability to cover one wall. That may seem a bit complicated so i'm just going to say it would be like making one single reinforced wall  unbreachable with 2 out of the 3 uses of their ability while the third use can be used to repair other holes in walls. It's not that hard of a concept to grasp, 1 + 1 = 2 (2 being a single reinforced wall) and 3 - 2 = 1 (3 being the total amount of sheets they have and 2 being the amount needed to cover a wall)
---
I don’t main but my most used ops are
---
Hibana: 3 speed, great gun if learned, hard breach.
---
Jager: Great gadget, godly gun, 3 speed, super fun.
---
Monty: Great for plants, distracting, and being annoying.
---
Maestro: Great LMG, Antiplant, if used right is pesky and can destroy exothermics

It also gives you more reinforcements and tacticals

No no how dare you. The mp5 is literally one of the few guns your only allowed to use an acog on it's like using a g36c with a reflex disgusting
---
^^^yes
---
but the enemy team!
---
I used to play on it because I thought it made me better but then I realized it didn’t but now I’m too used to it to change back
---
How about believable?
---
My bad than I wonder what did go wrong.
---
That's what a "mode" is, something playable.
---
It's not a story mode, it's just story.
---
You better not ask that to smoke.
---
But that wouldn't make Ubisoft money.... This game is their cash cow.
---
You would still have to buy the game
---
I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled, I’ve rebuilt data base and nothing is working
---
Sorry I explained this poorly but I was saying that by using the ability to reinforce a wall you're actually using 2 out of the 3 sheets you have meaning only one wall will actually be reinforced or one and a half walls if you use all of them for reinforcing and not repairing.

My guess at least 50% of this sub are kind of addicted to siege even tho we hate it from time to time so give it a shot

Tekken 6 siege

When you are using shotgun for destruction you get kinda low on ammo.
---
The smg-11 can also get pretty low as well.

Rainbow 6 quarantine

Its like chimera but as a whole game. I'm hoping it gives us a much more story focused rainbow 6 again
---
Who said I don’t care about lore? I didn’t downvote you either. We can’t invent lore out of the blue if they don’t give us anything we can’t magically create lore.

i'm level 97 and haven't got one

I can’t remember the exact level but it was probably around 30 or something I was rlly lucky. It was on the sausage. Up to now I have also got it on the mp5k
---
Wait and see 👀
---
Idk I walked away and had a shower then had some pop when back down and saw this and was like BrO. WhY

That's called reverse baiting

The BOSG does have ACOG though? I don’t see any reason why they’d take it off after this TTS, because it’s still completely useless lmao
---
I wonder why you can't do the same with the outback one.
---
So if it hadn’t of taken this long, you would of left your team in a 4v5 while you took a shower and grab pop?

About 2 30

For his undershirt I would assume he uses a simple tan tee. But you can look up the uniform standards for his CTU on the internet.
---
Have you tried using second account to see if you can get invites through so its not account related issue?
---
She’s so useless that I only remember Goyo from them two because I actually see him played when people are taking the game seriously
---
I guess you’re right... when I want something I have no problem figuring it out so that was never an issue for me, never even thought about it’s.... accessibility? Sounds like Arma isn’t the game for you though if you need everything to be laid out for you, for sure. But it does those things you said you’d like.
---
It's casual just leave if you dislike the map
---
Haha he said the funny thatcher line haha
---
HAHAHAHAHA this would be a bit difficult, cuz my shield's weight is like 1/4 of my actual weight. it is 15kg, i am 60. stonksn't

mhh, why not HAHAHA

There needs to be a game mode where all guns have acogs
---
So no hard proof? I'll wait and see.

On the main subreddit page there should be three dots in the top right. Click on it and then "change user flair"
---
**AA12 ACOG**
---
t-hunt = god ai
---
Its fully automated. The user doesnt have to remember anything. In fact, the user probably wouldn't even notice the difference because from their perspective nothing changes.
---
woah
---
If you hit every single bullet sure. But chances are unless you burst fire (which will severely INCREASE the ttk) you’ll probably end up missing shots and won’t get the kill. The gun is not that great.
---
&gt; Harder to smurf. Before the **update**, a diamond could play with a copper to decrease the team MMR and get easier matches
---
You mean the current update where this isn't even possible anymore? With the 1000 MMR gap cap. Don't see why this is listed as a benefit as it's not a thing right now. 
---
I think the HUGE downside is that it takes 5 times longer to calibrate someone's ranks properly if that person switches stack size a lot (I know I do) Say it takes 20-30 matches to come somewhat close to the rank that represents your skill level appropriately, this would mean someone would have to play between 100-150 matches in a season before even being ranked properly. Which means many more unbalanced matches unless you want to do away with the seasonal rank entirely. 
---
Any system that introduces separate ranks will increase this but I think 5 ranks is way to much. At the very least combine 2-3 stacks. 
---
Best solution I think is to remove 4 stacks and separate solo, 2-3 stack and 5 stacks. Whether they should have separate ranks I don't really know, maybe, different debate. Queue times would increase, it's a trade-off for better matchmaking. 
---
Questions about this comment:
---
&gt; The advantage you get while stacked up will show in the increase in MMR, and thus have you play against harder teams than when you soloQ.
---
You would have separate MMR right, so the MMR you gain while stacked WOULD NOT influence your solo MMR?
---
&gt; But that same silver 5-stack might be evenly matched against five gold 1-stacks.
---
And how are we going to determine what stacks can face what levels? Maybe algorithms from the current queue could be used somewhat but those match ups shouldn't happen currently so I don't think that will help much.
---
^u ^d^o^n^t

Nothing about a persons stats is 100% accurate but I mostly go off rank

We’re you playing with Theo Von?

For new players, sledge.

When he’s 4 kills into an ace you cap him

Epic

Off him next game you play with him
---
I believe the result is that it's much harder to down enemies with it, so you have to use the luison to do that.

I agree, but I think mute also works here as well

Plats in casual are a little, different.
