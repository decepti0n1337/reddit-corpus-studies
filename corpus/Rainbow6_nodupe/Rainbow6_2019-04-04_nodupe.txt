I've never thought about drone skins but could be a good idea.

I have black ice on all 3 of frosts guns, and the gsh-18. Also got 2 dupe black ice for the super90. I feel robbed
---
Killing 40 drones in a week is now for elite hardcore gamers? Lol.
---

---
This isn't a weekly challenge that gives you renown like the others. It's a challenge that gives you a special alpha pack. Why would that make it so you can just log in and get it?
---
If you're only logging into games for the challenges you have other issues 
---
Just the flower, but thank you very much.
---
No no no no.... Valkyrie has the best ass, I mean, have you seen the thing? It's absolutely gigantic. Don't get me wrong, Dokkaebi is a nice gal but not the best, understood?
---
Exactly 
---
I‚Äôve never heard of outbreak getting hated on just chimera with broken lion.
---
if you bothered to read one of the 10000000 posts about this you‚Äôd know there‚Äôs literally nothing Ubisoft can do. people like you blaming them have no idea how it works. it‚Äôs on Sony and Microsoft 
---
use google 
---
True, but remember this is between Dokk and Ela
---
Laughs in free alpha packs
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt have a phone or computer or internet
---
How do we call this combo? Muzzie, Mote?
---
Why are you kicking yayger
---
I don‚Äôt think he was referring to the content of the update, I think he‚Äôs talking more about the glitches and bugs that came with outbreak.
---
Further evidence that he must be nerfed ASAP
---
It's been 5 hours, where the fuck is it?
---
You can still join a team, play Go4's, Offline tournaments (Not LAN) I'd say go for it.

I just think of where I would put them if there's a lesion in play, I tend to find them if I'm not getting shot at. That and the distort to ground a little.

Lucky shit.. I literally got Blackbeard‚Äôs headgear and I don‚Äôt even own him. I better not get unlucky once I get this pack

I keep telling my squad that operation chimera's music was top notch and they act like i'm crazy for even paying attention to the main menu music.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind some universal deployable skins like this.

Listen buddy I agree but

Hitting plat 3 solo queuing is the same as a glorified gold 1, once you've solo queued to plat 2 and above, only are you worthy of being deemed as good. And solo queuing is dependant on luck, queue at peak hours 
---
Safari bundle
---
There's no answer to this question, test out each setting and decide which one you like.
---
And the menu theme, too... by far the best.
---
How about a 50/50 chance for classic Herford in every playlist?
---
I actually seen a faster ace in this map
---
Lightish red
---
Bro it‚Äôs the challenge man it changes people. I was straight yeeting impacts at drones that I thought might get away
---
not a problem, all thats left is blitz
---
Same thing happening to me. I have no clue how to fix
---
Nicely done, props to your brother!
---
And nothing is more annoying than posting a picture right side up and it flipping on you no matter what you do lol
---
I can just imagine russian hard ass playing in time with the blurs
---
Oatmeal is good, but fuck raisins. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre eating tiny shriveled up testicles.
---
I have an AMD Ryzen... rip.  
---
Normally I record my gameplay but I had just got done watching YT so I didn't record.
---
When me and my friends play we usually ban lion, tachanka (my fault), clash, and blitz or montange because their abilities are to overpowered in small 1v1's or 2v2's
---
Its just so ridiculous that its amazing.
---
Yo this is actually really good! 
---
Smooth!!
---
A worthy replica for a Bosak...and older one though, I don't think Ela could handle something that could hit the side of a barn.
---
Ok 
---
There‚Äôs a down side to each sight. Holos have a big casing that blocks your peripheral vision as well as a big reticle. 
---
Red dot has a good reticle but an even worse casing.
---
Reflex has the best casing but one of the worst reticles. The bullets shoot at the top of the triangle.
---
Acog has a bug casing as well but since it has zoom it negates that. The arrow in acogs is also easy to aim with. Therefore acog has no downsides and if it was available for every gun no doubt most people would pick it. 
---
This is why ubi needs to address this instead of applying band aid fixes like removing the acog to balance operators. It doesn‚Äôt solve the underlying issues it‚Äôs just a temporary fix
---
I hate people like that. oh shit did I say people? 
---
This is awesome
---
Ayyy
---
Ayyyy
---
Ryzen is a CPU architecture. I don't think it's GPU? 
---
Is it a pre built pc or laptop? 
---
I think you can still download and use shadowplay even without an nvidia gpu, but look it up yourself if you're interested. 
---
What¬†you¬†mean¬†with¬†that?¬†i dont¬†understand sorry
---
I legit hated my older brother when I was young playing video games. He'd always backseat game, especially annoying since I could kick his ass.
---
* happiness noises *

Try restarting the game.

Rook= half the team's weight
---
Correction: They belong in trash cans
---
Statement is true but not against fucking drones. Nobody is constantly shooting at the drone, you can‚Äôt tell exactly when some people will shoot. 
---
I think that this fact is probably the only april fools joke ubi made that made me crackle
---
I feel like mute is underrated 
---
I just jealous that you have Black Ice for his SMG

I'm gonna be that guy. Zofia uses Bulgarian circle 10 magazines.

There is no need for glaz. Everyone is already bright yellow

Oh I got ya.
---
Where‚Äôs kapkan
---
You right
---
I use mute alot because am great with 2 speeds and love his gun. Once you've placed your jammers there's no real need for him anymore so I usually go roam but usually stay a room or 2 by just in case am needed. That's why he's one of my favorite defending ops.
---
As a console player, could someone explain 
---
another thing, /u/blazag182 commissioned this from me. give big props to the guy for supporting us artists &lt;3
---
I was thinking the same but I couldn‚Äôt find the name in game, just L. Detachment so yeah maybe you‚Äôre right
---
My PC is pre built, has nothing NVidia at all. GPU is AMD Ryzen.  
---
(AMD Ryzen 580 Series)
---
Yeah, pretty much all Corsair keyboards come with those keycaps now
---
hey dude I was stuck in copper too and what worked for me was ranking up, because one I ranked up I went into bronze and I wasn‚Äôt in copper anymore. Hope you have the same success bro
---
oh!
---
Congrats! I am jealous.
---
I think any skin should still use yellow paint for everything, so it doesn‚Äôt stand out to much
---
Heck yeah dude üëç
---
Montagne, Blitz, Clash and Cav are what i normally see banned depending on who i fight if its between friends they ban Ash because its my main 
---
just like ash mains and their acog
---
This but un-ironically
---
Flat is justice 
---
I saw that quite a few guns also have black ice skins, but I'm not sure if that's the case for the other skins too HAHAHA fair point though
---
Wasnt there suposed to be a wall to stop spawn killing on consulate?Where has it gone?
---
Because it hasn't been fixed yet
---
yeah they used to be $10 dollars a skin i think
---
My brain:
---
This fucking idiot. That‚Äôs iq. What a dumbass
---
My eyes:
---
O Shit. That bitch flying. 
---
This but un-ironically 
---
There‚Äôs a delay, Mr Homeless did a video on it
---
It‚Äôs a group of terrorists doing bad across the globe; the only reason both sides seem in the right is because we‚Äôve given them personalities and faces we love.
---
Casual and ranked are like staged training scenarios but the whole point of team 6 is to fight terrorism. The main terrorist group we fight are called the ‚Äúwhite masks‚Äù I think. They are the terrier we fight in situations and in terrorist hunts.
---
Its a replay cam issue that just came in last update.
---
can you actually sell the skins for cash?
---
Truly the m1+w of our generation 
---
Xbox, delete that. 
---
I think it‚Äôs more than a replay cam glitch because it‚Äôs gotten me killed more than once
---
I always considered pulse op because you always know where the other player is.
---
Bahaha right? I was thinking that's what he did, given the craptastic framerate xD
---
Its not, shield dsync exists but this isnt. Its a replay glitch. 
---
But their team has more head clickers. So therefore easier. Having less head clickers on your team does in fact make it harder. 
---
Fuck
---
This happened to me but i just restarted my game and it fixed
---
poetic and ironic :o
---
a young woman with more color in her eyes than any normal human sees less color through them.
---
To free mr bear ofcourse
---
Nah, a suppressor is an attachment but not an extension.
---
Real life: The suppressor creates an expansion chamber at the middle of the barrel for the gasses to expand and be absorbed. Once the round leaves the muzzle and enters the tube of the suppressor, there's no contact between it and anything else and the gas is no longer propelling it.
---
On top of that the type of round you use inherently travels at a lower velocity. You have to drop the round to subsonic speeds to eliminate the supersonic "crack" a bullet makes as it's breaking the sound barrier. 
---
As far as the game I don't believe it's considered an extension and simply reduces damage at all ranges.
---
Hated it died once because the Thatcher was the exact same purple as the walls
---
Just asking because, from what I can see from the screenshot, you're lying. Your name is grayed out, while one of the enemy's is white; signifying that he was alive and you died. While I won't call you a liar, I will point out the facts
---
like, you mean they cant actually do it because of data limits? There is no way that is actually true.
---
Q and e are lean keys, ash runs fast and crouch spams

FUCK YEAH MR BEAR

I thought I did
---
Have u guys seen the hiswifegon 
---
Something fantastic happened when I played with my friends yesterday: the color blind kid was perfectly fine, but the guy who can see (with glasses) and has never shown any type of color blindness sees floating guns in most situations. He gets very frustrated in this playlist
---
They care enough to give him butterflies but not to fix how jank shields are smh
---
Fair. I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate really and he should‚Äôve just had a headset in the first place. Still just want to add regardless that if you reinforce a *sensible* impact hole, you should be sent straight to hell. Hope your personal life improves friend.

Hey!
---
Glaz isnt terrible on plane so long as you arent on the middle or against an experienced glaz. One of my favorite kills I've gotten as glaz was a headshot through a window at the front by standing as far back as itd let me which is an area people dont expect glaz yo ne able to see properly
---
Ubisoft name?
---
Garbage spam
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have noticed unless you circled
---
Not ops like Maverick that are close to silent (on anyone who isn‚Äôt soundwhoring) and can see your entire body while you can only see part of his mushroom hat.
---
I‚Äôll check them out, thanks!
---
Couldn't agree more. That leaving before interrogation should have been fixed a long time ago, it's bs they can get away with that and you know they do it every time to be that fast on the controls. 
---
He was responding to the other person who was referring to different circumstances, but good job calling him a dumbass for no reason.
---
Oof sorry dude
---
I touched the wall before he had anything to do with any kind of fucking holes
---
‚ÄúAs all things should be‚Äù -Snap Daddy
---
Well then
---
You‚Äôre going about this the wrong way. Leaving is okay... life happens sometimes. If someone disconnects, their limp body should just be left behind. Easy solution imo.
---
Russian Elmo dancing
---
Looks like super saiyan 2
---
But if your WiFi sucks and you know that, you shouldn‚Äôt play ranked knowing you‚Äôre gonna screw over your team
---
His animation should just be him crawling on all fours licking at the footprints.
---
I can‚Äôt find the community
---
When operators fight each other you‚Äôll notice that the announcer addresses the enemy team as OpFour. In real life I believe op four is a team that tests special forces on their response, defense, and assault on an area. But as to what they‚Äôre training for I have no clue
---
Since i play FPS games i'm at 200~250. I don't know what to say.
---
I think he's saying you can't camp windows if the other team has Glaz, or picks Glaz once they notice you camping windows. Try relaxing and talking to people like friends, not enemies, friend.

Shadow and ReLive just record/stream basic. OBS Studio is a robust program. It takes time to tweak it to run flawlessly, but when it does its superior to both Shadow and ReLive 
---
Mozzies gadget is Great Drones are power and nomads guns aren't terrible they are mediocre and her gadget is sometimes inconsistent
---
Thank you, if i had money i would gild you as i am a console peasant and didnt understand
---
Read the other comments. Q and E are used to lean left and right and Ash gameplay is basically crouch lean spamming so yeah.
---
Tf you say homie
---
Or... it's just because the plane is in House, Kid's Bedroom. Which is older too the game than Zofia anyways.
---
ask
---
It looks a bit like my Patriot Viper V730
---
How do you get a custom flair?
---
thsts what i thought 
---
I made passionate love to the mods 
---
no problemo
---
They should just buff it in general, gun sucks 
---
surprisedpikachu
---
Make it count as 4 deathes if they leave when downed. If the kd startd to get hit hard they will stop. Instead lets go with 5 and if repeats double it.
---
Monty's is tactically smart. It distracts the enemy from your teammates. 
---
okay bud
---
That's absolutely baller
---
I'm hating on outbreak profusely for the waste of money it was that could have been spent on dev time
---
The last bit, it isn't getting gud, it's getting a mic. The number of times Ash or Zofia mains have run straight into a nuke-ready room is absurd. People can't fucking look at walls, windows, any of it.
---
same here 
---
 .300 winmag casing, .308, and 7.62x54r
---
not a spawn peek, it was a run-out to prevent plant denial... but it fucked us in the end
---
Most operators like the Korean for the example with the 707 have something representing what special forces or tactical group they belong to. Sometimes it‚Äôs from their Unit or just a theme between ops. 
---
What did you use to make this?
---
I didn‚Äôt even recognize that I have the buck outbreak uniform
---
I don‚Äôt see how Ubisoft didn‚Äôt see this happening
---
Maybe she's Katherine Pryse?????
---
...Its like one of my Japanese animes...
---
I‚Äôd buy both ops just to use it. 
---
LA LA Creeping Under My Skin; LA LA Creeping Under My Skin
---
Guess mine 
---
Pack it up, yall. It's over.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure they did, but at least the vast majority of players respect the unwritten rules. 
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious, how many times do you get banned per month for teamkilling accidentally as a fuze main? It‚Äôs obviously enough that you‚Äôre not in favor of punishing teamkillers (even mildly in this case might I add). 
---
Germans it's always casual Friday 
---
An increase in fire rate would probably do the trick
---
Exactly. On a semi-related note, I love that these guys constantly make skins and new character models and what not, I really dig that, but if we could get things that were more practical and less aesthetic (or just more practical in general it doesn't need to be mutually exclusive) I would be more satisfied with customization as a whole.
---
Our little albo is growing up.
---
In public matches I don‚Äôt think anyone should be banned outside of the Pick and Ban mechanic.
---
Very cool
---
I know but I‚Äôm still angry about an unrelated event
---
Finally chanka works on plane
---
A lot of times its to keep their CTUs looking similar or realistic with the real life CTU (like GIGN), but in the cases like Vigil and Dokkebi, it just shows what they‚Äôre in. If you look at their characters in the operator menu, it tells you they‚Äôre both in the 707th SMB, hence the 707.
---
It's a monster of a gun when used right. It's recoil is pretty manageable short-range and it kills _very_ quickly. If you land your shots, the mag size shouldn't be a problem at all.
---
No problem lmao I was fooled to until I realized the ak is fed 7.62x39 rounds and those ain‚Äôt it
---
No problem man 
---
Dangit, he found me out. At least you will never know exactly what's in the canister. It's too powerful for the common operator to understand.
---
Shit dude quality 
---
Yeah even if there is no glaz, it already feels like I'm glaz whatever operator I choose.üòÇ
---
Shield ads time is faster again by the looks of it. Felt like it last but while playing but this makes me more suspicious

Wait, did pulse join in? Why do I start hearing a messed up Polaroid? Get back here Mr. Worldwide!!!!

For real. That shit was punishing on hard. Even in a stack. I remember we spent actual time on a good team comp for it b

Or fuze

I don‚Äôt get it

Also if anyone wants to play ranked add me on ps4 @iCottontop

I wouldn't know. You killed me and I'm watching shot out cams now.

If he did, vengeance is catching up to you.

Rip in piece indeed

I saved this one XD, to good to forget

And i teamkilled because i thought a guy on my team was the enemy...

Yeah I thought it was only one until I clicked on it to zoom in üòÇ 
---
I played with bad players against good players
---
I think it refers to the ping but yeah I don't understand either
---
Because of the matchmaking
---
Awesome! I‚Äôve got tons more clips that I‚Äôll be posting, just don‚Äôt wanna get in trouble for spammingüòÜ
---
Well im not those people. In the rare chance that i get a well structured team that talks in game chat and makes call outs ranking up in solo queue isnt an issue but most of the time i get people who dont use coms and do run outs and do spawn peaks and die immediately every round. Thats when solo queuing sucks
---
There's a specific third person animation that can be seen by all players whenever a shield is ADSing, that's what allow you to get a headshot on a shield player who is. We would all be able to see if that Monty was aiming down his sights.
---
Its a confirmed fact that each time a blitz flashes you he looses 15 IQ points.
---
My friend raged yesterday about how it should be in the game and that he‚Äôs sad they removed it lol 
---
This is bull****, jerk off always gets priority.
---
Because its very hard to control,at least buff horizontal recoil

Sorry, I meant custom maps as in maps that were made by Ubi for a specific purpose, such as Outbreak maps and Air Cute One.

Tachanka wouldn‚Äôt have his own cereal if he was trash.

It‚Äôs more like r/UnexpectedOneWordEach.
---
Playing this game mode I discovered the bright side of the community, they asked for a drone/gadgets trade and we got like all the gadget challenges in 20min and 15 drone at the end of the match.
---
I actually think opting out of in- progress matches would hurt the people who need another teammate more, as no one would really want to go in and risk their time.
---
if people join after the lobby is set up you can have more than 5 people
---
should have took turns to team kill him
---
But he‚Äòs pretty well lit :/
---
it‚Äôs a new level of boosting
---
That's true, but the most of the time that I join a match is 0-2 and started yet, so if the team lose I can't do anything.
---
Nah man I understand, I'm not really trying to debate you, I'm just sick of shit like this.
---
And no acogs
---
[Sure, take a peek](https://imgur.com/a/ddmRGM6) 
---
Nah it triggers immediate interrogation effect. Leave if you are downed and you fuck over your team, regardless who killed you.
---
PC. Happens to my friends and me too. We dont use discord, but we do use teamspeak.
---
You got the Tachanka headgear so you should've gotten everything you want from this collection^/s
---
Just break it. Ignore it for a bit. Then peak again and pop. Or just go to an entrance the enemy entered. It has been a while since I played but theres enough time to go outside before being alerted to enemy team
---
Yea I‚Äôm wondering what he used to make it too!
---
The mcdaddy is the og skin for the gun
---
So there is only one chalange for thos new packs?
---
The Blitz Elite was also leaked an entire season before it got released so yeah
---
Shooting the toy is the only way to do this (trust me totally legit)
---
YOU DARE CALL THE LORD A LAZY MAN?
---
Working as intended
---
That doesnt break that rule. That rule is more aimed at people reporting a bug here. Not people memeeing from bugs. Different types of post. I have seen posts like this for the last 3 years so it doesnt count like that. Just because it has a bug in it doesnt mean its not allowed. 
---
This looks the same
---
You can get only two for free.
---
This is the only challenge for a free pack.
---
Next week the mode will be gone forever.
---
And with forever I really mean **forever.**
---
I can agree with second,but I don‚Äôt fell first
---
Goals
---
And how exactly does this break the rules Mr Party Pooper?
---
Yes, just record it report it and thats it. Dont respond otherwise you are just as bad as them 
---
Then I hope you have something like an i9 9900K with 32GB@ 3000Mhz 
---
does the challenge reset at all? most likely not damn I want the cat bro
---
If you think calling someone a cunt for teamkilling you is just as bad as what they did, then you are sry to say it, retarded
---
You also live in a society where people like me exist. You have to live with me as well. I don't hate that you love cosmetics, I hate that I have to look at such an eyesore when playing the only game on the market with micro destruction. 
---
Quit being so melodramatic, me not seeing your cock is of no concern to me. I'm not into voyeurism.
---
Not a single Clash name spoken on this comment. Their mains would be crying by now... 
---
I maybe didn't get that headgear but I got Monty and Smoke headgear for free.
---
What do you mean with "reset"?
---
You have to get 40 damn drone kills as a defender on that "Air Cute One" map.
---
Take Bandit and his shock wire or the Rusiians with their lawnmower shotgun they are pretty good for killing drones
---
Lesion's face...üòÇ

I mean we just had a random thought about the 3 v 3 mode soo... but that would be inclouded of course. Per defender you get 3 reinforcements and instead of a 1 minute(?) a 1minute an 30 second prep. phase but you got less time in attack/defend time will be reduset to 2min and 30 seconds
---
I can't believe that people still haven't realised that joining to in-progress matches is GUILTY for leaving a match before. It is very rare to join you to non-progress match when you didn't leave last match. It will join you to 2-3 in-progress matches aftrr leaving one. Don't leave every in-progress match cause it'll effect worse.

Did you even read what i said 
---
Gut.bersrk look that up 
---
I feel you. Went from plat 2 to gold 3 today because I was solo queuing... did I at least have fun? Well no. But I did learn a few new racist slurs!
---
for me: 
---
45% won
---
55% lost.
---
Loses reasons:
---
10% smurfs
---
20% team fucked up (5v1 rushes and deaths)
---
60% simply losing to better team
---
9% rages
---
1% trolling.
---
Every night when I go to bed I'm like "Fuck this game, fuck my toxic teammates, fuck ubisoft. I will never play this retarded game ever again. Then the second day at work I will be like "God why can't I just leave and go back home and play some more siege?". It's like ms sex. It hurts, but it's addictive.

I have not done all operators, just 25 and I will eventually release all wallpapers!
---
Man, the screen effect should on Bandit's Elite MVP screen instead of shitty punk motorbike MVP.
---
Yeah, you said it's pure luck and it seems like you're implying it's impossible/very hard for you to climb out of gold 4 this season. To which I'm saying that if you're good enough, you'll get out.
---
This game mode shot my mom
---
Such an amazing job man!
---
All Corsair keyboads come with those keycaps.
---
It's all about the K95 Platinum RGB!
---
Buck, Jackal, Thatcher and Dokkaebi and Maverick for attack, Lesion, Frost, Mute,Alibi and Bandit for defense
---
Tbh the gun that you call worst shotgun in the game is used a lot by LATAM pros. They do real good with it, so I'm guessing it is your positioning. Shotguns are in a state that were actually brought to by the community's request for balancing 2+ years ago, so they ain't changing anytime soon
---
Swapped Q with A and E with D. E &amp; Q are for leaning.
---
Same..

restarted uplay? or the game?

You can try hard if you want.

Just don't expect people to try hard as much as you. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand why I can do a half and half window. It makes no sense lol. I hate skinny reinforcements that don‚Äôt fit a Mira 
---
On some obj you can try to hide the camera and destroy the thermite charge if there is a wall that is commonly breached, might only work in lower ranks but not sure
---
I know doesn't work for me and my friends either have been destroying probably 20-30drones but apparently just 2counts

can you open the files? It seems they are corrupted for me.

I got the same one :(

Last seconds reminded me of when i meet my online friends for the first time irl.
---
Mhmhmm... \*bring back throw back mechanic\*
---
Is the operator literally going to be called Frogman? 
---
yeah op really didn't explain it well
---
Buck is down but not out
---
Cav attempts to interrogate
---
Buck mashes the button which "blocks" the interrogation
---
Buck dies, cav gets no intel (attacking team are not highlighted)
---
The problem with the idea is what happens if you talk?  Do you stay in a down but not out state?
---
Oh... Mr. Bear died, Um, I wasn‚Äôt expecting that.

ü§£ü§£ü§£ some of the positioning at the beginning was triggering me lol

can't open the pictures
---
This could work but would need a balance for not talking, e.g. if you talk / spill it then the attacking team is highlighted (current mechanic)
---
If you choose to not talk, then you sit out the following round; there has to be a penalty to balance Cav not getting the intel (highlighting attackers).

No no no stop this stupid trend. Op Chimera hurt the game more than you can imagine.

I play casual the same way I play ranked. It‚Äôs just practice for me, why would I build a habit of playing badly in casual? I practice how to be better no matter how good or bad my opponents may be. If you‚Äôre getting sweated on in casual, maybe it‚Äôs just a challenge you haven‚Äôt faced before? Maybe it‚Äôs a 5 stack of plats warming up? 
---
I have lots of stuff going on at my house and I might need to get up to do something I can‚Äôt be locked into a 20-45min game. So I just try to improve no matter who I‚Äôm playing against, casual or competitively.
---
This happened to me mid ranked match. It was so weird. It was only the death UI and the pick operators UI. As soon as the match started, it the UIs would stop jittering. Weird.

Probably not because apple really doesnt allow you to download zipped/compressed files from what I know of.

Hate when that happens

When it‚Äôs console(yes I am on console) so aim control ain‚Äôt the easiest thing, especially with Ela‚Äôs Skorpion, and the only bad aim was the beginning when he jumped out to try and hit the guys directly under the window

Happened to me yesterday, playing cas when all of the sudden everyone had 300 ping and we waited in a contested obj for 20 minutes
---
All good man 
---
Because everyone keeps saying there wasnt a buff..there was..they shadowbuffed him finally
---
That‚Äôs a good idea
---
Vigil looks like he's about to drop the coldest diss track of the year 1996

"Drone challenge", "pack challenge" are amongst the terms that yields results

This line was too real for me tbh
---
I've got the same issue.
---
Haha, I don't remember, but I wanted to reference one of the (in my opinion) best freestyles he's ever made
---
I might just do it myself, it would definitely be worth a lot of karma! 
---
I never said do glitches or fuck with downed players. I meant keep the game light hearted and fun, don't focus on the killing each other because you NEED to win the game or whatever. It's a game, people have shit days and play games to have fun. Nothing ruins a game faster than a jerk or a tryhard douche. That's all I meant. 
---
As soon as he seen that message, he knew he was fucked
---
no anime
---
So winning is bad now? God damn participation medal mentality is getting out of hand. Being toxic is dumb, and should always be discouraged of course, but, calling people 'sweaty' because they're above your skill level and play better than you is just silly. How about, instead of whining, you try and learn from that person and get better.
---
But, that's just me. All I know is, when people msg me to call me sweaty, it just makes me smile, because I am slightly above average skill at R6 on my best day, so if you think I am so tryhard god in cas... lol you are gonna flip when you see a diamond m/kb user go off in your lobby (I play xbox one mostly). 
---
how is that a big buff. fuze is one of the least used operators

Yeah its bandits elite skin

Hello a-inner-depression, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b9dfo9/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Then idk, sorry
---
"i cAnT EvEn mAkE A StIcK FiGuRe!"
---
Nice job. Just wondering where do you cancel the throwing animation on frag on console?
---
tell me that this ain't Deku's fighting pose.....
---
Your accuracy doesn't matter if it's casual bc it doesn't mean anything, there's nothing at stake.
---
That was my point
---
And you're quick to assume someone's age online, 8? you play like you're 4.
---
Normal barricades also blockes line of sights so that make no sense. And if it doesnt block you it wont block the enemy 
---
That sucks
---
A rework is not a buff though, it's a rework of the op. 
---
No, I like it :(
---
For most civilians any automatic or semi-automatic rifle is basically just a glorified toy anyway.  
---
You don't go hunting with an AR-15 now do you?  
---
Let's be honest, for your typical home defense you're going to stick with either a shotgun or a handgun anyway. AR is going to be problematic considering its size, won't it? Unless the Americans have not just wide roads but huge houses too...  
---
And for hunting, again, shotgun seems like the best option again.  
---
Or a bolt action rifle.
---
I respect another fellow Thatcher, mozzie main good art
---
The spray with the secondaryüëå

Quick reminder if you spawn camp your a bitch.
---

---
Am I correct to assume this is traced? The lines seem very imprecise and incomplete when up close. Might want to touch them up a bit :)
---
From afar it looks very cool though! Especially Mozzie's helmet.
---
It looks so shitty that it's good imo
---
You can't get rid of them by shooting them though. If they use a grenade to destroy it, then they waste time and utility. It will get harder to destroy evil eyes if you use your grenades to destroy Castle's barricades.
---
When thsy said they were going to rework kafe it wasnt a rework it was a buff so the point your trying to make is invalid
---
Nope. Ubi said that it will be later this year tho
---
Well no, but actually yes 
---
I recently had a random team and we recruit lmg sprayed for 4 games on the new map

Yea that‚Äôs happened to me before. Unfortunately I never ended up getting it after the maintenance either 
---
Amazing however, how is mozzie that tall?
---
Even if j don't get caught I still don't want that risk of my main account being banned
---
I see you have a really good stroke and a really good perception of shading! It's really impressive. Do you study stuff like gesture and anatomy? I HIGHLY encourage you to start early. Assuming you don't, just do the assignments on [Proko's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClM2LuQ1q5WEc23462tQzBg), it's great! You, will have to do this some time, if you start now i promise you'll be at professional level in a year. I'd suggest to start with the [biceps](https://youtu.be/E_7tSCm3FzE) probably. Just learn all the muscles, you'll do great things.
---
Ping abuse doesn't exist. If you're accusing this player of using a lag switch, then that is loss abuse, and basically nobody makes use of a lag switch.
---
No haha. Honestly swear these are free hand, if you want i can try and find the original screenshots from my Instagram where I done the rough sketch of mozzie, not sure if I had one of thatcher. I just sit in front of my ps4 and copied them for about 2-3 hours. 
---
I see you are a man of Englishn't.
---
The hatch change was also for maverick
---
*TRIGGERED*
---
THAT HAPPENS TO ME
---
Temporary fix is to change ur display to borderless and the shaking will stop..
---
No permanent fix that I know of
---
Mines double that get on my level 
---
hmm, ssuppper shorty.
---
I was really hoping you would dome frost then kill blitz
---
yeah but i only can write 12 letters but the code has 16...
---
I don't care what you think.
---
Are you talking about how he is on live or the tts?
---
At first I thought they said it in team chat hahaha
---
General Zuhkov?
---
Hes not even OverPowered hes balanced
---
Console trash xd
---
Exactly
---
oh that sucks. yeah usually i get them when this happens in the past but not today apparently
---
Same
---
Idk why the hostile replies, but just because something doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay does not mean it shouldn‚Äôt be fixed. That is one dumb fucking thought process.
---
whats you ig so i can go like these
---
Hey, they had plenty of time to spawn
---
Ubisoft should plop you on their design team 
---
no
---
Oh woooow that‚Äôs the community in a nut shell
---
WOW that's incredible. That shading üëåüëåüëåüëå
---
I can feel the normal 60 ping just by looking at this
---
Since it can brighten shadows, I wouldnt use it (as it gives you an artificial advantage)  but you probably wouldn't be banned
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not that deep into Siege to where I understand what that means, if you could explain what you mean to where an idiot like me can understand then I can give an answer.
---
Where've you been the past like year?
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt think of that, damn
---
Hear! Hear! ü•Éü•É
---
Try me
---
Thank you for the suggestion :) My dad actually encourages me to try new stuff in my art so yeah I've tried out anatomy before and its pretty difficult but I try my hardest! He's given me books and stuff on how to draw feminine/masculine figures correctly etc 
---
Insane, is this like year 4 now?
---
I'm actually tearing up because it's so sad and funny at the same time
---
God bless you OP and drone 
---
Went into a newcomer game and watched a drone drive straight into a electrified barbed wire. Funniest shit I‚Äôve ever seen on the game. 
---
Ehhhhhhhh
---
So you're talking about Lion's state in the current version of the game? TTS is the test server, where they're iterating on him.
---
awstdun :)
---
Thats if they have a maestro, and you have two nades. Theres only 3 people with nades, buck sledge and finka. Finka is barely used, sledge wouldnt have to waste nades so this would on affect buck butt it depends on were th castple is place becuase theere can be a soft wall near or next to it.
---
Soon as he saw blitz he's like "welp"
---
It's completely different and will play differently to the kafe currently in game. Have you even seen the map changes yet? 
---
First I thought you were trolling but you are totally right, that guy's a toxic siege player taking other peoples fun from the game. Pls Ubi ban him. 
---
üòÇ this made me laugh way to hard 
---
&gt; Defense
---
&gt; I don't see Gridlock
---
ü§î
---
Imagine seeing that in the event mode
---
C4‚Äôing two teamates in one throw is either an incredibly unlucky occurrence or (more likely) a result of carelessness, which should still be punished likewise.
---
I believe I mentioned the chances of someone beating a door down instead of blowing it down are really slim. Especially as a level 70 that was my first encounter seeing a wall break with melee. So level shouldn‚Äôt effect IQ. Not everything happens in your first game, especially this game. 
---
I did that once with the 25 pack deal and literally 11 of them were purple and I still didn‚Äôt get one, it‚Äôs just upsetting
---
Have you checked other devices on your network? Do these spikes match with peak hours?
---
I have 400 hours and no black ice, my friend has 200 with 2 black ice's 
---
So just because I didn‚Äôt understand what he said makes me ignorant to the game? I still understand the game I just didn‚Äôt understand what he meant, God you guys love bringing that up. The only time I see Lion being a problem is when people are toxic and use Jackal, Dokkaebi, Blitz, Finka, and Lion. Other than that he‚Äôs really not hard to get past.
---
But if he already knows where you are, he will walk into the room and you‚Äôll be forced to stand still without cover, and at the same time no one will be able to come help you. 
---
P.S. ‚Äújust stand still‚Äù is the response that has become a meme on this subreddit because of how nonsensical that answer is.
---
I worked really hard on both, for Mozzie i got up once from my seat in front of my ps4 and I'm pretty sure for thatcher I didn't move at all, maybe like once to get something to eat. Once i start I usually don't stop because if I leave to do something else I can't really find the motivation to do it again later.
---
I mean nobody really gets up as her unless you get to cover and even then you get 1 hp so its quite ballneced and what about nomads air jabs or gidlocks  traps? Those are unrealistic 
---
I looked into doing this one time and then I saw the cost of all the parts. Yeah fuck that but nice job for committing to it 
---
Not after the nerf she‚Äôs getting
---
Its normal that big sounds (such as reinforcing, explosions, etc.) do actually overshadow voice chat. If u want to lower the volume, adjust master volume.
---
Like I said it‚Äôs luck of the draw, I‚Äôve only had the game since chimera and I have 3 but I play very regularly
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so upsetting about this. I wouldn‚Äôt be so worked up if my friends also didn‚Äôt have black ice, but they do and they have so many less hours than me.
---
It is most likely less expensive.  I just do not have the receipts in front of me.  A guess off of what i remember. 
---
The lore (and character model) explanation is that smoke has a special backpack that filters out his gas, so he‚Äôs immune.   
---
Also if I‚Äôm not mistaken, sledge doesn‚Äôt even have a filter in his gas mask, so it‚Äôs worthless.
---
Cool. 
---
Having the same problem man
---
Gotcha, thanks for the feedback :)
---
THATCHER MAIN!!!
---
Damn that‚Äôs some amazing work! You are so talented!

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.

* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.

* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.

Ik but that‚Äôs something most players learn when level 30
---
Yh that makes sense but it isn't Loud sounds that are overshadowing voice chat, it's all the sounds, no matter how relatively small they are, I can only hear people in game in the operator selection screen when absolutely nothing is going on and even then I have to strain my ears
---
At this number, you friend basically owns every cosmetics obtainable throught packs in the game
---
Keep working! One day you will become famous never give up!
---
It's good to know I'm not the only one pulling this skin here :D
---
I‚Äôm referring to a different comment where you said that you weren‚Äôt too knowledgeable on siege. And by not having done any research or experienced high level lion playing, you are just spewing retarded nonsense.
---
The only time you see lion is when your copper 4 ass has some idiot player spamming scans whenever. Watch some pro league games and see how disgusting lion is. He can scan while a teammate plants or secures and there is no counter.
---
Tell me, what if the enemy is securing and there are 2 consecutive lion scans going on? What would your obviously 200 iq ‚Äúlion isn‚Äôt busted‚Äù ass do?
---
I use the phone hacked by dokkaebi wallpaper. Just for locked screen though. 
---
You don't have to keep a steady hand. Draw the line just bit by bit in very short and faint lines. Sketching it and forming it as you go.
---
If you get what I mean by that.
---
It sounds like an internet provider thing.  Games were almost unplayable for a while during peak hours until I changed mine a few months back.
---
i miss these. where i document characters from games from sites where they were already documented, feeling like i'm part of the game. enjoy these days my dude! and your drawings are absolutely amazing,way better than anything i can draw!

Need an LMG Finka

I‚Äôm sure like 60% of R6s player Base is under 17.

I‚Äôve spent about 3 years playing Rainbow 6 (and I‚Äôm still playing it) and I only have Black Ice for Buck‚Äôs AR. It‚Äôs truly luck of the draw
---
Wow, when I was 12 all I could draw was stickmen (same now tbh) these are amazing, hope to see more soon!
---
You went full screen using Alt enter didn't you
---
Haven't touched the game in over a year. I put in about 900ish hours. Just got bored

So *IF* i want to stay with the same internet provider. you're saying that i can only game consistently at nighttime? fuk...

Thanks for the heads up, but I mean you should at least have two anchors in the room to watch each other in case he tries to rush.

I can‚Äôt even draw the logos correctly, but these are insane! They look as though they are a screenshot from the game! Great job!

It‚Äôs still funny to me that this ‚ÄúAR-15‚Äù is actually an M4 and his M4 in game is actually closer to an AR-15

Not sure about this, but do u have "Equalizer" option under Enhancements turned on in the Windows Sounds settings? Try turn it off.

That's how I was for a while man.  It sucks.  I would give them a call and also check other devices on your network to see if they're having the same connection issues.
---
Ok. I‚Äôm going to clear everything up in one post:
---
I have three accounts on PlayStation network: 1. my main, 2. a plat smurf and 3. OliversPlayhouse that you can see in the op.
---
1. My main account is used when I want to play serious and when I have more than one friend online. I use this to better both my game sense and my overall skill. This acct is against people of my skill level and is a completely even playing field (other than the ppl that use MnK).
---
2. This account is currently Plat 2 and I have only played a handful of games on it this season. I use this to only solo queue and just started doing so a couple of weeks ago. The point is to also better my game sense and skill much like my main account, the only difference is I play on it when none of my friends are on. I use it so I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing my rank on my main from bad teammates or teammates that leave while at the same time being able to play against people roughly my level.
---
3. The OliversPlayhouse account pictured in the OP. I use this to mess around with friends and every once and a while I‚Äôll throw a couple of games. However, the main purpose is to better my aim. I don‚Äôt drone, reinforce, put down utility or plant the defuser. It is simply to practice my aim. Yes, the people I play against are certainly no where near my skill level but I do not play against them like I would a plat or diamond. I usually play on here when no one is on or if I‚Äôm having a bad day on my other two accounts and want to better my aim. 
---
‚Äî About the original post: This was just a normal game where I was running around doing essentially ‚Äúdrills‚Äù for my aim. At round three, my teammates started to leave for whatever reason. I then decided ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù and tried to win the game. In the end, I wasn‚Äôt able to but still got 27 kills. I thought it was kind of cool and decided to post it on here mainly to show how annoying it is when your teammates leave. I do realize that it was against players at a lower rank and skill level than me but no where in either my post or comments do I brag about how good I am and that I ‚Äúshit on‚Äù these people. 
---
‚ÄîExtra point: sometimes I‚Äôll come across people from EU that are boosted diamonds in EU and copper 4 NA. They come to NA servers to boost their trash KDs and also to make themselves feel better. It‚Äôs always fun to shit on these people (who are usually using MnK on top of it all) and make them leave halfway through the game. 
---
I hope this cleared everything up :)
---
Yes, otherwise nice ace

Yeah, let's just make shield operators completely irrelevant
---
So because I don‚Äôt follow up on what everybody else is talking about means I don‚Äôt understand the game completely? Okay then. Pro players ban him because they know how to work Lion real well and they know the other team can do the same, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Lion should be reworked. A well coordinated team can work Lion easily, but it doesn‚Äôt give an excuse to rework him. 
---
Quick reminder that Tachanka is a force not to be reckoned with
---
How does this make them irrelevant. Monty and Blitz would act more passively to support their team as shield should.

So let me get this straight, You can't handle shield op's so you want to nerf them into the dirt? Yeah how about you Git Gud?

Unfortunately there's a demographic for every taste, and as such there's at least one group of people to complain about any given change that gets made. For the people complaining, it's not that bad because they're only complaining about one thing specifically.

Incredible for your age. Keep at it my dude.

That's all it is, He can't seem to use idk the trap ops that counter shields to his advantage. He's the guy who sprays at the shield when blitz is sprinting at him lol

Anyone who thinks they don‚Äôt need changing is wrong. I‚Äôm not changing them because they‚Äôre OP, it about making them less frustrating to play against. Similar to the Cav and Clash changes

Ignore him dude if you never come across somthing how are you ment to find out lol, I'm lvl 300 odd been plat/ dimoand player and I am still learning angles lol, you can only learn if someone tells you or if so one does it in your game.

...‚ÄùPro players can him because they know how to work Lion real well‚Äù is an awful way to say it. More like ‚ÄúThe pro team that has Lion will 100% win‚Äù. This is enough reason to rework him. Communication levels beginning in even gold is enough for lion to be too broken.

I've only been consistently playing since the middle of grim sky, so its the best event for me.

They don't need any changes. You're "Changing" Them because you struggle against them shield ops aren't even hard to play against or frustrating if you play the ops that counter them but lemme guess you play Ash on attack and Vigil on defense and don't think it's you're job to play the characters that counter them. Get real, Cav got nerfed and she will still 2 shot you, Clash got buffed idk where you found a clash nerf.

Nope. It‚Äôs about making them less frustrating to play against. They don‚Äôt this with Cav and Clash whereby they effectively nerf them eventhough they aren‚Äôt exactly OP.

Rainbow Six Siege is a team based game, there is supposed to be communication. The team is supposed to work together to win. A drone, Dokkaebi‚Äôs Logic Bomb, and Jackal‚Äôs scan can do as much recon without Lion. If the teams were well coordinated then there wouldn‚Äôt be no use to ban, rework, or completely throw out Lion.

Each game you play you‚Äôll get renown, which can be used to purchase the ops. In base CTUs, the first op will cost 500 renown, 2nd will be 1000, 3rd, will be 1500, 4th will be 2000. Depending on what and how you play, you‚Äôll usually get between 200-500 renown per match

Yes, but ouija doesn‚Äôt have full words.
---
Wait...what? What is the nerf?
---
I basically just play this situation a couple times as a warm up everyday and it got boring so I started trying to find angles I could wall bang the enemies consistently. I just found little corners that I sat in because you can easily go back to the exact same place by just simply jamming yourself in the corner. Then from there I just started firing in the general direction I knew the enemy was in until I killed them and so I remembered little markers around the area I killed them that I could use to line my shot up with next time. I just repeated this with each spot and then practiced until I was consistent, so yeah. Also that no scope at the start is easier than it looks lol

If you have good aim it doesn't matter the gun. You can tap fire with an ar, you cant full auto with a dmr, ie no reason to use a dmr. The good aim argument has no merit in regards to dmr being a reason to use the gun.

‚ÄúThe importance of runouts and methods for a defender to briefly enter the Attacker‚Äôs ‚Äúterritory‚Äù and land a few shots on them. 
---
As an example, this is something that we embraced almost immediately, and went into our creation of Border. We designed the map with runouts, balconies, and rotation areas that allow the Defenders to relocate both inside and outside of the building.‚Äù - Ubisoft ([source](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-305212-16&amp;ct=tcm:154-76770-32) 
---
Hmmmm, seems suspicious. However, I will be hyped for it as I have nothing else to be hyped about at the moment
---
Being left or right handed has nothing to do with saluting.
---
from what I know steam and uplay siege have different files so you would have to have both
---
Man. This makes me sad. Why don‚Äôt they just rename the sides to attack inside and attack outside then
---
Imma be hopeful here and say its mirrored like a photograph 
---
If you pay attention... Yeah. 
---
And, no. That reasoning is why I believe most people on this game are actually mentally deficient 
---
I'm so proud of this small indie company getting out of beta after such a short period of time. 
---
Nah cause in reality it‚Äôs pretty hard to perfectly cook a grenade like that
---
Sure man try to direct message me with all your info, I‚Äôll get in contact with the Ares (siege) Gen, and we will see if we can get you in here 
---
Or idk spawn somewhere away from where they‚Äôre running out, use a shield if they keep doing it, be prepared and lay down and shoot them. I mean they get a target above their head and they also make a bunch of noise to break whatever to run out unless you aren‚Äôt droning correctly and watching for peaks and run outs. If you‚Äôre talking about mid game run outs then drone out properly and make sure you‚Äôre covered. I‚Äôve never had a problem with being runout on because I use claymores, watch my back, or don‚Äôt stay somewhere I can be jumped out on easily. Know the way the game is played and watch for where they can run out and peak. It‚Äôs easy.
---
Then why do you get shot on runouts?
---
I guess it must be because theyre better than you? 
---
Silenced sausage can spawn peek

Oh the days! Miss being able to rematch after a really close match.

If you're on Xbox, you have to go to the store and actually download the pass
---
Run outside ate part of the game and something you just have to account for. It's a strategy and is just as "toxic" as something such as a frag grenade. 
---
Sure, and why do get killed by lucky headshots? Was it because they were better than you? Quit making up retarded statements.

It's a TURRET, and as appealing as a Tachanka buff is, this would be very overpowered in the correct situations, ie pairing it with a Mira window, which would eliminate visibility of the wire. Hell even the usual deployable shield turret setup would be overpowered.

Definetly interesting. Tho I am thinking: is phantom also a Counter to Echoes drones? Cuz if yes, that would be a big game changer.
---
Stop stating low effort opinions. 
---
"Runouts are bad. Her der." 
---
Why? What makes them so bad? Pay attention to the building youre entering whilst knowing opposition is waiting. And the chances are you wont get killed and youll start off the defenders with one less person. Whats so hard about it? 
---
I would. Its disrespectful to salute left handed
---
Extract the file with winrar or 7zip or something. you should be able to see it then
---
Where did you get that Corvo print ? 
---
It‚Äôs bad because if it‚Äôs about defense, why are you able to attack the attackers then?
---
Still a game tho
---
I got that charm in one of my first packs.
---
I hate mnk users as well but if there was a sure fire way to get rid of them then we would have it by now. Ubisoft has tried all they could to get rid of this issue and it‚Äôs a constant loop for them. What needs to happen is Microsoft and Sony need to step up and change their terms of service, sue the companies profiting off those adapters, and patch out the adapters with their own firmware update.
---
Also for future reference don‚Äôt post stuff like this revealing their names. It only gives them more publicity and witch hunting as a whole is not allowed in this sub.
---
I agree 100%
---
Uh idk the call outs yet but the top of garage, jump out the top left window and throw one up over wall to the right. It‚Äôll land at the gas station where attackers spawn and you blow it to kill them. It‚Äôs about 1/3
---
Doesn‚Äôt even make sense
---
No, not every gun is a one hit kill. Max falloff suppressed p90 would (I‚Äôm fairly certain) do enough to down, but not insta kill.
---
Your guess is as good as mine :)

---
I heard him stomping above me and figured he was going to the stairs to try to pinch me, but the shot was pure luck
---
The casual mode is sometimes unplayable because of toxicity, trolling and tking
---
The bans and all of that is there to make the toxicity not worth it for a player
---
As someone who doesn't enjoy ranked, I find casual hard to play since the matchmaking is less accurate, people don't take it seriously at all and the toxicity
---
So the bans are a bandage fix for toxicity 
---
I don't miss it.

Seriously... there was a kapkan who kept running to one end of the plane to bottleneck incoming drones, and I was trying to go where he was going also so he barricaded the doorway to block me off. So I start taking it down and he just blasted me through it. So cancerous

I heard the multiplier is 25x, so as long as you aren't spawn killing through a soft wall, I think you're good. I do agree that it's a really shitty weapon though.

No. This does not happen to me at least. Could it be something with your pc. (Post pc specs in comments it would help). R6S could also just run out of memory and crash. I don't have a fix but, maybe somebody else can help if you give a bit more detail. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling?
