Exactly

---
Yeah I get that. I only knew where to go because I had watched Markiplier play it a few years before playing it myself
---
If your struggling with maps, I would recommend just running through t-hunts to learn maps
---
Filthy acts done at a reasonable price
---
What is there to not understand? Skins are literally just cosmetic changes you get randomly.
---
I shouldn't HAVE to lock my door, I shouldn't HAVE to look both ways before crossing the street, I shouldn't HAVE to drive defensively; you can spend as much time being upset about other people as you want, but it's extremely unlikely to change. The best way to achieve inner peace and lower your blood pressure is to take initiative and make choices that reduce your exposure to other peoples' negative behavior. 
---

---
At the end of the day, we're talking about taking 1 step back when you place your jammers if you have another anti-breacher on your team, it's just as simple and easy as what you're asking Bandit players to do. Just use your eyes bro, check out who your teammates are playing and change how you use your gadget to compensate :P

What about the ACOGs on the SMG 11?

Thanks ive got the 4 basic maps all in my head but i still need to learn some.

I have gotten 2 black ice. One was for the S.A.S pistol. And the other was a duplicate for the S.A.S pistol, I’m lvl 110 as well :(
---
Imagine

This is why i've quit playing online for a while cause of ping spikes like this
---
Please don't be mad about this... it's my first black ice and I'm level 58

Couldn't work, no one can live with killing a dog, just basic facts
---
Noooooo!!!!!!! I have had 51 commons or u commons in a row, without a rare or epic in sight
---
Hmm, so with a higher fov the crosshairs are smaller as well as the enemy. That would make your hipfire feel better because you have a smaller crosshair but its not actually better because the enemies are also smaller?
---
I’m mad about this
---
Lol

*lemme in* *LEMME INNN*

My extremely unpopular opinion is only dmrs and slug shottys need acogs , ash is the perfect example of a gun can still be good without an acog

You could get an ace and get 650 points

She was clueless lol. Could’ve knifed her

Basically, the feeling of higher accuracy may just be a placebo of your FOV settings

I think its too latw for that but i kinda agree

I hate reddit’s video player so god damn much. Constantly on the mobile version it’ll play have the video then freeze. Jesus christ fix your god damn shit.

Reworked not nerfed imo

The tribe has spoken

What about it’s p90

 Aide last time I checked that thing has a acog

I’ll keep looking maybe it’s around here somewhere

That’s why I love this game.. stuff like that is funny because you’re all usually so close to see the tragedy occur lol.. nice post

yeh, the gun looks good with so many skins but the glowstick just ruins them :c

Because hiring an actual company is almost always going to be better than trying to create an anti cheat from scratch.

Cod WaW allows you to call in a pack of dogs to attack the enemy.  These fellas will hunt you down and kill you if you don't shoot back.
---
Sounds very painful
---
Same but I like the head gear
---
What are you? Silver? Of course you this is a tactical shooter
---
You’re playing it wrong then.
---
Well fuck. I guess I don't play enough thunt D:
---
I believe you already have your answer. You’ll just have to wait it out.
---
I also, am poor
---
Beautiful
---
They were the exact same account, same level, profile picture, and same games and everything
---
Nice Kaid gameplay!
---
Because defenders aren’t playing well. With coordination you can hold down an area and never lose.
---
I am not. Ubisoft simply wont let me
---
This is really dumb.
---
I feel you. I’m like level 100 with none. My one friend has 5
---
This won't work because it will be just an extra player for the attacking team. 
---
There is a reason as why we don't have automatic turrets or dogs
---
Launch in 3......2.....1.....😫🔥
---
My 1st alpha pack on pc was the 556xi black ice st like level 20
---
yes. why?
---
Why didn’t you just look away?
---
I just watched a lot of speed runs and I was ready for all the jump scares
---
thanks
---
thats a metaphor, in siege you dont get compensated
---
Why? You can’t aim for the head and rely on high dps guns to get your kills? Are you that potato?
---
Then the metaphor is wrong.???
---
You’re not winning if they’re competent. The gu and smokes will kill some or at least delay. And when they’re out of traps they just go invisible and leg it. You won cause they fucked up honestly.
---
Just wait to see if there’s an other challenge.
---
so? then they're friends who bought their accounts at the same time and decided to put the same pic
---
Nope. Literally because it’ll mean reworking every single weapon in the game, idiot. 
---
You don’t know basic maths? If Jagers carbine does 34 damage then it’ll take 3 shots to kill. You can’t magically change how numbers work and make a 34 damage weapon take 5 shits to kill on a 100 hp enemy. 
---
Absolute idiot.
---
Same
---
I dont want this because I dont want to be shooting any dogs even if it's not real, period.
---
The group I play with generally starts complaining when the queue time last longer than 1:30 minutes, we restart the queue at 2 mins, so it’s quite active on Xbox. 
---
FYI- the game can kinda forget about you and throw you MM limbo, so after 2 min, restart your search. I’d say the average queue time for casual is 30 seconds to 1min.
---
Also, find friends to play with ASAP, the community has very low tolerance for new/inexperienced players and can get very kick/TK happy and this game has a steep learning curve.
---
Ak cause bigger mag 1 less damage isn't a problem for me
---
Also, nice shitposting account. I’m guessing you had to make a new account to not lose your previous karma since you know all your ideas and replies would get downvoted to hell.
---
What’s it like on pc compared to console? Are they more forgiving of newbies? 
---
I’m making the switch next week but I’m nervous as well as excited cos I don’t want to get TK’d every round.
---
Nice flow bro.
---
Bruh
---
That looks dope my dude
---
I’ve found it to either be farrr more toxic or farrrr more friendly, dependant on the people in the match. This is enabled by push to talk, and then typing chat in all chat and team chat. Then again cause of RFF the TK every round will be ok. It’ll be tops once hahah
---
Just because you know ONE person It doesn't mean the majority doesn't have a computer
---
Would also prevent the dreaded headshot injure...
---
They tried to put a Galil on Nøkk. I'd like to see it on someone.
---
Nooo
---
Knocking Dark souls hackers off the edge with an ultra great sword or wrath of the gods was peak video games for me
---
Invisibrus gun does around 10 less damage then Jagers....
---
This is fantastic
---
?
---
Right....
---
Perhaps
---
Could make it only visible to teammates
---
This game needs to take a hint from Overwatch. If a player leaves within the first few minutes of a ranked match the match should be canceled.
---
Didn't even know collateral existed in this game
---
Well u should improvise and be mute???
---
285 to 380 rounds per minute
---
stop asking questions and just hop inside, there is plenty of room
---
Oh that's gorgeous
---
[removed]
---
Check out r/R6OperatorCreator and find Kur on it. You'll see it there.
---
Fucking lucky bastard, Thatcher is one of my top 2 attackers, and AR33 is my gun. lol
---
Yes i do. I want a game where it takes a lot of shots to kill someone. Nothing like fortnite or apex tho but something in between. 
---
Why? Because most of my kills are headshots. This would not affect me in the slightest. I don’t even use 1x sights. I run acogs and my headshot ratio is 75%. Everyone tells me to make a youtube channel or something because my aim is that good. 
---
I don’t like it when some stoner sitting in a corner starts shooting me in the back not even aiming for my head and by the time I turn around to shoot him, I’m already dead. With this change, I’ll be invincible lmao. I’ll turn around and dome him because his poor ass aim while take longer to kill me since he doesn’t aim for the head
---
Wouldn't you nerf that pistol for the GSG9 in the process?
---
You only have your trap gadgets and temporary invisibility to defend yourself so you have to lure them into the traps. No knifing or anything.
---
Okay, stop making me think deep into CoD, it's giving me emotions
---
Yes that’s why it’s losing 3 rounds per mag
---
why else would the reinforcements be applied from the outside
---
YOU FUCKING BITCH YOU SCARED ME. TAKE THIS CRAPPY ORANGE ARROW
---
Nope. It still takes 1 shot to kill. TTK for headshots is very low and that mechanic which i love is still there. 
---
Most of my kills are headshots so even if ttk was higher, you can’t play longer with skilled people. Maybe in gold or something idk but im diamond rn. Hopefully get champion
---
Do you aim for the head?
---
I also didn't understand the soft breacher part, doesn't the blow torch cut the wodden wall as well?
---
Nice. Can't wait to blow the dog's head off.
---
tbh i don't care for black ices
---
Couldn’t you look h Through game files and find the picture. ( I am on console so idk how that works, but I think it should.)
---
Is this english-?
---
FNC, WA2000, RPD, 21/23E, Tar-21, AN-94, AKS-74U are iconic to Rainbow Six games and I believe they are bound to come to Siege at some point.
---
Ok so I thought it didn't send so I kept on sending it and didn't realize😥
---
Either m870 or sg-cqb if you are shot gun rushing and use either the mp7 or L85a2 when using full autos
---
Imagine not using a screenshot and instead using a phone and taking a photo of it.
---
It does yeah, but this acts a bit weirder. 
---
Cutting the top and bottom of reinforcement makes the metal bit fall off, leaving just the wood bit which is attached via the left and right sides we didn’t cut. 
---
You could then cut the left and right to make a hole, or use a soft breacher to break the wood. You can even fuze through it now

I fucking hate mavericks that breach a straight line at the very top of the reinforcement. Your chance of killing anyone through there is 0 because you have tunnel vision peeking in and they can see your rappel rope so they already know where you will be and be aiming there

This is probably what it's based off of. If not then it's totally based on a monster thats based off of that.

Just like they said (looks at camera directly) are you ready to shoot a dog

Thanks TIL

I can hardly operate my own phone at times and i don’t think I could look at the game files and get the icon

Set the game to 720p, everything low or off. Maybe 25fps if your lucky? Definitely not competitive.

I play on all low with a step down from my native resolution (2560x1440 to 2048x1152) and i get about 110-120 fps.

I’m a Jäger main too it’s fine

1. the MnK adapters use simulate controllers, xbox doesnt recognize it as MnK
---
2. ubishit doesnt care, report them to microsoft saying they're using mouse and keyboard on rainbow 6, i've done this and gotten results.

3. R6S could just allow MnK like minecraft, gears 5, etc. do.

If yo are better than 4th, you are now the 4th.

Nice clutch. Played smoke exceptionally well. However do you roam with smoke?
---
Yeah what is up with that? Been lagging all week. Never happened before, and my internet hasn't changed.
---
I know, I realized too late
---
Nokk needs that not Warden he'd be better with the K1A
---
True, true.
---
I started to try other mains so I moved to pulse and iQ and not even gonna lie I got black ice with both guns I use for them today. I use iQ’s 552 and I got the black ice with that and I got the black ice for the 5.7

Jäger doesn't need to be touched.

Hnnnnnnnggggggggg

I believe if you go into an individual op, there is a option to check the stats you have solely on them.
---
Semi auto, fo12 on Ela.
---
Most reliable ones are m590 and m870, the latter being very strong.
---
Cav's shotty is very good.
---
Yeah I think so. What about kicking toxic players though?
---
No now do that with a stim pistal
---
Yeah, yeah it is.  In a 1v2, the LA should die 95% of the time.
---
Glaz just needs a completely new kit. Snipers don't work in siege
---
Aw man that sucks, he probably didnt even noticed
---
Uhhh are you being sarcastic? Because that’s quite the exaggeration
---
Rip the elo from that game, though.  Hopefully you’ll make it up somewhere.
---
Maybe for you...
---
But after they run. Out of time they can camp out the doors, and have one person come in and wreak s**t up.
---
You better chill bro that's a Plat 3 you're talking to, they dont fuck around
---
No, I’m being logical.  Siege is a team-based game and in a situation where there is one person against 2 or more people on the enemy team, a clutch should not be expected of that person because of the odds against them.  If they win, that shows a lack of coordination on the opposing team and that a victory overall is more than likely.  If they lose, that shows a lack of coordination on their team and they need to create better coordination if they want to win that match.
---
My imo is that nomad is the most fun of that group
---
What’s your definition of a clutch?
---
Me too

---
It’s because it was pluse smhhhh
---
That's exactly what I said. If you raise the TTK, you'll have more time to react to an enemy even if you're not expecting them to be there. Siege is all about having the tactical advantage and using it to win gunfights instead of pure skill. Letting you be able to *make a mistake* by checking the wrong corner and *still* coming out on top in that gunfight is wrong on so many levels. 
---
Even if we suppose for whatever stupid reason that raising the time to kill is a good idea in any way, it would still make for less skillful gunplay as high rate of fire weapons will be even stronger due to one-shot headshot and getting headshots would be way easier if you have more time to react. In what world does that ever make for gameplay that rewards skill?
---
Ah yes. I see you are a man of culture.

All you need is a couch

How many more times do i have to see this meme.

To track someone the boi could sniff something to track
---
I've had that happen at least 10 times in the last week.  They really need to punish that behavior.
---
Bad manners
---
It most definitely wouldn't. Like I said, they'll just try to vote whoever they find suspicious, even when they aren't. They'll do it purely out of rage and impulse, because they couldn't handle dying to them.
---
If they really feel the need to "spectate" and "vote", they can always record and send it to Ubi. Ubi considers it.
---
Oi
---
No probs. Glhf.
---
no u
---
they are for me
---
It’s not working for me either
---
Well yeah that's the whole point of it, to see if they are cheating or not, it's up to the people to decide, and it would help ubisoft, so they can focus on more important things
---
Ya figured wrong incel.
---
Australian shitposters making the whole community a better place
---
The real question tho, how is you, a gold 1, playing with people in champ rank???
---
Game hasn't worked in general for me for 7 months
---
Yeah we were trying to find a rank match and as soon as we got put in one we got a matchmaking error. Then got abandon sanction and lost elo. Will I get my elo back or what cause this is BS.
---
What is is saying, for me it says a connection error
---
That dude didnt earn champion legit. He probably boosted to get that or Ddossed to it. Out of the 161 wins he has lost 0. That's impossible. I know a few champion players and I know for a fact they cheated to get there.
---
Anyone know why ?
---
If you need to beg to gain subs then you're probably not making the right stuff
---
Also this does not break the self promotion rule. "Up to 10% of submissions may be self promoting" as far as i know he hasnt made more posts like this mate.
---
It's not actually for the wallbang through the beds, but the BB looking overtop and sniping half of bunks. Basically with BB there and one on the windows you can clear it and enter very easily.
---
Better check betwixt those couch cushions
---
what case is that ?
---
But I need it in my bank account. Have a heart, sir
---
It’s always on the way mate!
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
This! I basically really dislike the acog because of this
---
I mean damn dude maybe you should hold off
---
Forgot to switch accounts for his reply
---
Only possible on console tho. You can't have such a high kd on PC without being some kind of god . Hell, Beaulo has 1.5 kd I believe. The guy was probably using mk on console tho
---
Thanks
---
It's really easy to use, fast fire rate, low recoil, the damage is a bit low but those two factors make up for it
---
The spinning at the end I laughed so hard I lost my voice
---
Preference. Powerful gun and easy to control. Like it more than the shotgun and ar she has
---
It wouldn’t surprise me.
---
A LOT of high ranked console players are m&amp;k while the legit controller players get their asses kicked :(
---
But the AR is the second most powerful AR in the game
---
Not if you can’t use it properly or control your aim and recoil
---
There is a challenge on ubisoft club you just have to win 13 rounds of the new gamemode
---
Good job the third best player in the world but did you just get over 200 new subscribers to your youtube because of this clip on reddit?
---
mate if u have no money the last thing you should do is buy a game
---
What utilities are you saving 2 cents for?
---
You new to YouTube? Pretty cool stuff you have there, earned a sub
---
I have money set aside for the nessecary things. This is my enjoyment fund
---
The 2 cents is recreational
---
Just use a twitch drone or get Hibana for the Mira windows. As for Nokk her ability if fine, it’s just her guns are underwhelming. But with what you’re saying, they might as well make her invisible all around. I get what you’re saying, but I’m sure they want to keep it grounded to reality somewhat.
---
It’s a 2 week fun event.
---
Wait wut? Damage is a bit low? 
---
His weapon has 43 damage per shot, which is like one of the highest, if not the highest on defense.
---
lel, cyber begging. 
---
Surely you have actual friends and family that can help you out with a massive 2 cents?
---
Looks like im in boys
---
Does not change the fact that you’re ruining the experience for other players and fucking up the whole system in the progress.
---

They’re all like “Where’s the car?” and we’re like “Where’s the car?”.

Because he was desperate for some kills.
---
But unfortunately for him, he ran into ME, the 3rd best siege player! Woooo!!!
---
I WAS 420TH
---
its not fun
---
It’s a 2 week event why are you acting like this is a broken and game changing  problem
---
I love how you didn’t even consider stopping the TK. You’re just like “fuck this I’m getting my glory and whoever gets in the way is dying “
---
I like this
---
MP-7, MP5-SD, PDW even the K1A if they want to make her appear as even more of Vigil's ex-wife.

It does not impact your sens in siege. In cs go yes, in siege your aspect ratio has no impact on your sens.

hackers can have unlimited health now, so thats a think you might start seeing alittle more of...

69th comment haha .
---
What skin you had on?
---
Oh absolutely, she was 100% going to steal my kill, my moment.
---
No one gets in between me and destiny.
---
Blaze it up and smoke dat ‘urb!
---
...I’m white as fuck
---
It's casual tho.
---
Thermite elite headgear leak.
---
Thanks mate that's all I need to hear, theirs a huge discount on siege currently anyway so I'll just buy a new one I suppose.
---
because it isnt fun. its hide and seek without any of the basic hide and seek concepts. its so fucking attacker sided that theres bo point trying defense
---
3200000000000 times more functional than fallout 76
---
Yeah but Cyanide knifed NBK
---
then what is it
---
Now thats a good brag!
---
I remember i used to do it
---
I mean having those dialogues off is a bad idea. In game you can hear enemy ops if youre close enough. Sometimes when audios bugged out thats the only way i know someones doing something.
---
Stop acting like this actually matters it’s not like you’re going to lose Elo or your kd is going to go down
---
Kill the monsters

*Hammers door*

I also git a secound account if i accidently teamkill 2 mates with C4 and gett banned for 30 min. XD
---
Killing your own teammate to get the kill, that's the kind of pettiness that makes these videos entertaining :).
---
I am the 4th best subscriber on YouTube
---
Correct!
---
Hey, I think that’s racist!
---
Nice ace! What platform do you play on? Also quick tip, I noticed you keep your aim quite low resulting in a long ttk (time to kill). If you keep your cursor/sight/middle of your screen at head level this will reduce due to the one shot headshot mechanic. This is thing most people need to work on and I often find when I’m in a slump focusing on this really helps. Apart from that keep up the good work and I hope you keep the aces rolling.
---
Nice! The second ace I see and with fuse too.  Keep up the good work!
---
Damn, third best player in seige, congrats
---
I'm 546!

Welcome!

Thank you, I’d like to thank the academy and my pure sense of humility and awesomeness

👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

I’m on the PS4 unfortunately :(
---
Destiny’s does not take long at all haha. I have beefs with that game (mtx, dust changes, cash only stuff cut from the games content) but it’s battle pass is an easy joke. I maxed it out in a little under a month with some pretty casual play. I mean I’d still rather have no battle pass but it’s not even remotely grindy. Quests give huge progress, weekly bounties do as well, plus your first five levels every week have even more progress.
---
Siege needs something to speed up progress outside just play games. With no challenges or quests... there doesn’t seem to be much of a way to focus burst it.
---
Noob here. What do you mean they are boosting MaDudeKing?
---
They are alone. No team and no enemy team
---
Why do you really not want any operators?
---
You kill him, you absorb his power. There can be only one.
---
There’s to much to read
---
oh ok cool, mav's the next op i'll buy
---
a couple of things that definitely help:
---
1. Make sure you always drone as an attacker
---
2. Most of the time it’s best not to play aggressively, it’s best to hold good angles.
---
3. play operators you are
---
good at and use guns where you can control the recoil
---
4. Use voice chat/learn callouts
---
5. don’t main operators, make sure that you are spreading your play around different ops as that can help stop blips in your play.
---
Hope this helps!
---

i was wondering why he didnt just insta headshot u but then i realized its console
---
Mate, when I first started playing this game I was by myself.
---
Randomly bumped into some of these guys and in time we got a nice little group going.

Sometimes you just gotta put yourself out there.

If you do it enough, someone else will want to play with you more than once :)

Yea. It says it might be NAT type, but my NAT type is always moderate, and I have no nat issues on other games. Different places say different things so i could just try all of them see if any work for me. Ty

One thing I started learning recently was pre-firing. Helps a lot compared to my old habit: "Fire only when you see the enemy, w/ slow reflexes".

I was silver I and a few days ago my downfall started and bounched back to bronze I.. At least im silver V now...my K/D sucks (0.85)

“Let them win”
---
Check out r/seigeacademy!
---
Like most people say, it’s a steep learning curve, but the more you play, the better you’ll get. Try to learn from every win,  every loss, every killcam, etc. 
---
Watch a couple pros/skilled players play on Twitch or YouTube and apply some of the things you see there. You’ll get a better idea of positioning, droning, and all that jazz. 
---
I’m sure other people will give better tips but having a “learning mindset” really helped me.

Have fun and good luck!

And what makes you think the 4 idiots that kicked you then won't kick you again when you reconnect?

No, thanks. We don't need kick in ranked. That's why after 3 years we didn't get it back. Thank heavens.

That's.....not how any of this works, but ok.

I've saved up about 22 and it's been like 3 weeks since I started saving

Ngl, that would be a decently balanced op, with like a shield that blocks the sight of them maybe but they also can’t see through it.

I love this idea it can be like a wall to hide yourself 👍👍
---
Why should parents stop their kids from playing siege? Maybe when they’re very young, but like 13+? Nah, it’s not needed.

Dang this is really well put together. I’m a little confused about the functionality of her gadget but it still looks really good.

If you don’t use his turret then what’s the point

I used to save them, I would buy the event outright then grind the free packs and keep them as they were r6 credits then one day I opened them all to buy something...I regret that
---
He's wannabe no name champion rank who abuses match making, but this is funny

He uses the force to see through the bag

They were all teamkilling, throwing the game

Would it make you feel better if you knew that I spawnpeeked amaru with it at the start of the round?
---
If you're getting actual depression off a game you're too addicted and you should probably take a break
---
And the other stuff is higher rarities
---
Sometimes losing it’s no ones fault, the other team outplayed you and that’s it. Losing is not about putting blame on one person or the team. It’s about learning what went wrong and adapting to win the next round.
---
Ppeople do have good call outs, but by the time I'm ADSing I want total silence. Im sure not the most popular opinion. 
---
Also I hate unnecessary coaching. 
---
&gt;DUDE HE SHOT ME MAN I WAS SO CLOSE I HAD HIM ITS ASH SHES UHHHHHH ON THE STAIRS
---
oh how about the sound isn't 100% clear? like, it has a bit of static

Boy toy suck me like a Hoover.

I have took a break. It’s not just with Siege. I’m having a hard time in general and love siege

Who says they all queue together? Maybe it’s 2 plat and a gold the the silver queue with the other gold.
---
Ok blisk
---
Yep happened too me. Just keep getting uniforms and charms 😂
---
Smoke was last season. End of season 2
---
Well the simple solution is just don't blame yourself. Don't blame anybody. Just don't blame. Know why you lost, what you did wrong, fix it, and move on. Simple. Stop looking for a target to blame and just work on what's wrong.
---
I only either the most basic and straightforward callouts or be really specific.
---
Only with the OTs
---
I feel like ubi would make it so it has a timed duration but this wouldn’t be a bad idea

Lmao, this has 0 purpose

The translation is just ridiculous.

yea man, i got other bitches on my list as well.
---
Unpopular opinion: Fitz is unfunny and his videos are mediocre. (This goes to others such as TuxBirs, RussianBadger, etc.)
---
Don't even know how they get millions of subs from those vids.
---
It actually doesn't.
---
Worse. I once had a 7-minute ranked search. I cancelled it and started again to no avail. I rebooted the game in hopes of getting a reconnect popup. It appeared. But upon pressing reconnect it got back to searching. About 10 minutes later I got an abandon.
---
Great way to lose about 80 MMR at once.
---
If you run the r6tracker in game it will show as soon as you are in a lobby before the game does. It also shows average eli for each team kd etc.
---
If we do get Greek operators, I feel the attacker should be called Gladiator.
---
I wish they would bring it back. It annoying but another reason to grind.
---
Do the situations.. all of them.. until you get 100%complete.. it will really improve your health since bomber are almost only kill-able with headshots.. this helped me a lot at first and now, im a low gold on ps4 and high gold on pc
---
And after that make an op that uses a spasm-provoking nerve agent that rebinds your WASD keys randomly, so for example D becomes the new Forward, S becomes left... 
---
You can't trust your keyboard now.
---
sasg is def not C tier.
---
Welcome to Rainbow Six Siege.
---
uff, i feel bad for the pulse....the only one who doesn't throw, and gets absolutly deleted.
---
Nice clutch
---
Just say NO without your consent the enemy team legally cannot kill you
---
That's what I mean buy cheating. Boosting or ddossing
---
Tbh, I never had it until s3.
---
If I could recommend something; if the sound is just a constant sound, I feel that would remove all believability of them being real. I think it would be better if they worked like smoke grenades where they could be thrown and triggered individually. Maybe have them cycle from nitro cell sounds, gun shots, etc...
---
Yeah, was a lucky shot. Cheers 😁
---
or they investigate and see where the hacks are coming from
---
or you can make posts and complain and nothing will happen. your choice
---
Damn that ACE, I'm very impressed. Keep it up!
---
Her SMG and shotgun are fine. Learn to control recoil and realize that shotguns are mean't to be strong at close range.
---
Subbed @940 good shit
---
I wouldn't mute them, but reduce the volume significantly while ADSing
---
Yeah that's true

Operation Chimera? You mean Outbreak?

I hate that gun in the new CoD and I hate it here. Keep my Siege Bizon free!

New operator Idea. 'Magneto' - Ability: attach a magnet to the hostage/teammate you hate
---
Rook just to see what happens
---
Acog x1
---
FO12 and SASG on Kapkan are very strong. Hold a tight area with traps and its extremely effective. Cav shotty is decent but for some reason the spread increases when you rapid fire unlike the FO12 and SASG that have a consistent spread even when you mag dump. The M590 is the standard pump shotty but the M870 and SG CQB are very strong and you can yoink people at rather far distances.
---
Edit: I would argue that Kaid/Goyo shotgun are the best but they function like DMR's so I don't know if they count.
---
I loaded into a game a week ago and got disconnected because of internet, but when I tried to join back in, it put me into a new ranked match. I got an abandon sanction halfway through the new match which meant I got barely any renown from the current game, and on top of that I got -1 mmr point for the game that I won because it disconnected me from the other one.
---
I’m just imagining a sledge skin where he grabs a cat by the tail and just fucking WHAP
---
I'm still upset that I didn't get his headgear last year because ubisoft wants my fucking money
---
False

Ah, thank you. Wish that PP Bizon had the Russian holo scope (my favourite sight in the game) on it instead of the regular one
---
You learned the ways of the crab known as bikini bodhi
---
if you can recognise that you were outplayed, you can recognise what you could've done to prevent that. theres no "guaranteed win strategy", they all can be defeated in some way

Damn boi she thicc

Is this real??
---
Yes, bikini posted this on youtube
---
nope, PC
---
A defender that makes sounds that also makes decoy sounds.... doesnt sound like a good idea since all ops are so loud. And like will the noise be stationary or will it move. You gotta consider these things
---
Is 15 legal?
---
Chankbeard?
---
boy, have you seen literally every operator in the game
---
Ah yes, a new waifu to add to the game
---
What's kind of pistol is that?

I will upvote any operator suggestion involving sound. I've been saying this for years, we need more sound oriented operators.

Plat 3 is 3200-3499 MMR

"I have no idea of sound propagation" but:
---
I am considering of sound propagation similar to ray tracing. In my mind there is a source (sound source) and a sink (player).
---
Concept1:
---
Every sound from a source maintains  volume information.
---
Every texture/obstacle maintains meta-information on object density which has direct influence on sound muffling.
---
Sound muffles while traveling and also muffles on traversing an object based on its density value. Thus each sound maintains a vector for every player and a value formulating the relative volume for that particular player.
---
The sink itself is considered by me spherical. This sphere is traversed by each sound vector, thus this sound direction can be transformed into the the relative sound direction at the sink.
---
Since lots of sounds could reach the sink at the same time, which could lead to  critical performance requirement, the amount of handled sound sources could be bound to a certain threshold.
---
Also sounds could be enriched with priority information. E.g. shots and projectile gadgets maintain a priority value of 5, breaking windows 4, footsteps of 3, other gadgets of 2, and ambient sounds like breaking vases 1,... This can be used to lower performance requirements and to focus on prominent sounds.
---
Is this a real character

Anyone with a 16:9 screen should be able to see the whole hallway. But that's not what I see when I spectate my teammates using the cameras. Instead, they've centred the camera on one end of the hallway, leaving the other end uncovered and wasting half their screen space on walls that don't matter.
---
Well theres also the WASR. Which is basically just the Romanian VEPR.
---
Speaking of Romania when do we get an op with the AK dong?
---
I have one problem with this when playing with bots they'll just run away
---
What happened to your team
---
That only applies to terrorist hunt

#SHOTGUNACOG
---
Spas 12 on valk is pretty good probably before supernova and m870 should be above cav’s but that is just personal opinion
---
#BOSGACOG
---
I’ve always had the idea of an operator that has a gadget that blares loud jazz
---
So we came up to a team that was doing that. The problems with that room is a lot of people don’t realize you can repel and swing the hammer. You just have someone sit in the window and your rotation is gone. Plus the only doors into the bunk room are singles, so you have someone body block those other door and you have no where to run (unless the attackers are dumb and opened up a wall)
---
Sometimes when the game glitches like that and you catch on surfaces (the moments you’d stop for a split second in the fall) you were catching parts of the map and they broke your fall. I’ve had this happen a few times to me on Oregon when rounding corners on the roof too fast
---
Then they just don’t know how cameras work
---
secretly he wanted to use u so he can escape XD
---
This happened to me once, it gave me my one and only tachanka ace. They all came running in and died all on top of each other, diving like synchronized swimmers
---
Could be the TV? I'm not sure though I've never seen something like that happen.

Which one is the .44

It only happens when I shoot and lean so I don’t think so

It’s not counted on reports. At a certain amount of reports some dude at ubi might take a look at it but no one knows how it’s handled
---
I have mine set to melee and the other set to my secondary gadget and personally I put caps lock as my push to talk because it's close to WASD
---
“Yes”
---
I will look into it. Thanks you!
---
I've always said that giving him a realistic IR scope and replacing his batteries so they dont fall out would be the best fix.
---
The recoil is easier to control, thus much easier for full auto rather than burst firing.
---
i use a mouse button for my primary gadget, z to talk, x to melee, c to prone and ctrl to crouch. but just mess around with it
---
Supernova has the highest range of any pump in the game, and has m590's damage. It's definitely up there. And with the increased consistency, it's definitely worth it.
---
~~Spas12 is says 35 but does 30 damage. For that reason alone, I'd rank it below the others.~~
---
Edit: removed incorrect info.
---
Haha pp
---
Ranked or Casual?
---
Looks good to me, upvoted
---
Is this real
---
I do this even in the regular game
---
No to Ella shotgun on attack fuck that
---
Ubisoft should give us an operator creator tool with a voting system like the csgo skin voting system. If the operator gets enough votes it should be added to the game. The operator u just created should be added to the game definitely.
---
Yup very much like cs:go just with operator abilities. And gadgets. And an interactable environment
---
Cav more like taxi cab ahaha

The only way you get to gold or anything above bronze is through skill.

Presumably there would also be a callout that you're popping decoys. Though now that I think about it, maybe allies could get a quick countdown like Lion gives to everyone.
---
&gt;the report button doesnt do anything we need the spam to stop

Hi, never stop reporting people! companies arent allowed to tell you what happened to an account due to certain laws. I dont know if they look into all of them but you can be sure if someone sends a video of a guy fullon aimbotting actions will be taken. either way you should report people because they are rulebreaking not because it will boost your own ego knowing he got banned because of you. the outcome of your report is irrelevant to you. it only matters to the affected person so, keep at it

Yah this sucks. I played a team with one person from the start once. It registered 5 v 5 but I’m guessing four of those were stuck in that queue screen.
---
Yea I noticed that thanks for the tip I will have to work on it 
---
And yea I am on pc 😂
---
Yes casual sucks recently and I am 3 levels from unlocking ranked so I'm stuck in unranked or casual and it absolutely sucks
---
Could be your network? Millions of people don’t have this issue but you do.  You think it could be something on your end mister angry?
---
NO WE DONT
---
Good ol’ grandma’s chili.
---
Can we have an operator with deployable hatches?
---
She cute tho
---
And how activation works. If you were to set them like mute jammers as stated, how would they activate? All at once, or is there a separate activator button.
---
Epic indeed.
---
Ever lose because a teammate was in the way of the enemy? It’s so annoying
---
how do you make the images?
---
Doesn’t matter.. you lost the round for your team.. they were capping and you set up a turret.. I would hope I never got on a team with you.. do better
---
Wait a minute... Faust. Are you on xbox?
---
No.
---
Also with a big mag it would be like the Capitaos lmg, possibly even better because it shoots 50 rounds per minute faster
---
"Oh f*ck he's here"
---
"dude he hasnt been released yet"
---
Casual hasn't ever been anything different really.
---
maybe after overlapping interrogations it should show enemies wire frame through walls at that point lol
---
I would love her. 💕
---
Depends, you want a better ash or a op you can draw dicks on walls
---
Awwwuuuugh!
---
Personally I would go for zofia
---
As he's on the other side of the map from the rest of his team, and runs right into the cav's line of sight haha
---
How would someone go about doing that? How do you “tweak” a mechanic like that without removing it?
---
It could be deployed like a Valkyrie cam were you throw it and it sticks to something
---
Zofia is a bit more universal, Maverick is nice but he often goes unused, just my opinion
---
This is absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥

I already am knowledgeable of guns. And in not critizing the choice for that magazine or that gun. I'm just saying that I didn't know such thing exists and it's one of the less standard types of magazines

Hello there
---
Four now
---
I really like the design
---
That's the great thing about siege is you have the freedom of destruction to open up new lines of sight and create your own angles and it makes it unique so that no round plays out the same, I would still make it a point to practice your gun skill as it is a nice boost of confidence knowing that you have a better shot than the fellow on the receiving end but you are not toxic for being creative with how you play and instead I find that more interesting to watch than someone relying on just gun skill.
---
Hey, it's happening to me and my friends too. Are you by any chance on Telekom?
---
But you could do that in real life also shooting anyone on the head with a metal pellet air gun will possibly kill them
---
E Girls be like
---
A majority of the time the interrogation isn't worth it. If you down someone at mid range and are unsure you should always capture them in a pokeball.
---
I disagree with you cause when you have the shotgun you chose where you position yourself. With an smg you have range if you hit those headshots but with the shotgun it’s all about positioning and ambushing.
---
Sorry, what? I don't see anything.
---
3 interrogations should give you the enemy team's social security numbers.
---
Mav for sure!
---
yep
---
Of course the cutesy design chick has a pp.
---
Nokk mains unite
---
I think it is one of those things that is part of the game and you kinda just have to deal with it. It sucks sometimes but it is what it is
---
Neither.
---
Buy skins for the LORD CHANKA

An extra tanky operator with a 50 dmg gun would eliminate the need to be strategic if you had good enough aim.

it’s literally 1’s and 0’s
---
Achievement earned: Bragging rights
---
this is so good. especially the first two frames
---
Thanks for the clarification in the title
---
The one shot headshot mechanic is extremely competitive, this is because it rewards players with lightning fast reaction and good gamesense, players who randomly got sprayed through a wall probably made a noise or did something to tip off the player on the other side, there could have even been a call out. If you get randomly sprayed through a barricaded window at the start of a round that’s also your fault and not the other player being lucky. Every time you die to a one shot head shot it is your fault. Not luck.
---
To touch on your other point there really is no fair way to “tweak” this mechanic without breaking the game, as the one shot headshot mechanic is integral and central to basically all gameplay, it’s why we prefire at head level, peak at head level. Tweaking it in any way would break siege.
---
Also I love those guys but just because the pros who play exclusively on PC say it doesn’t mean it’s true, the majority of players are on console and the pros have their vision skewed from pro league play where this happens a lot, again because players get call out and have gamesense.
---
I went to google to see if they actually added this!
---
Whats wrong with her Arm?
---
It's strongly suggested that they're giving him something. They haven't stated what, but Mira says that he 'needs something' and that RnD is looking into it.
---
You're pretty good
---
Yeah lmao
---
I got downvoted for my comment but whatever.
---
It's always funny when some guy on a team calls their team trash or similar. I'm like, dude, you died too lol
---
Most of time it's on casual too. Like, relax, have fun.
---
r/blessedimages
---
Nah ur ok fam, their fault they dont drone.
---
You’re employing higher rank strats than they know how to deal with. Fuck ‘em.
---
Thanks for the tips I’ll work on all that you have said
---
ok so basically
---
the toy has nipples, an I wanted to cover them up, and the best way I had to do that is bending up the arm to cover them
---
Yeah dm me
---

---
You don't even know who I am
---
Think of it as a learning experience. You will dominate others if you grind as much as them.
---
I prefer the Wren or Flak headgear
---
You might have to get a group of friends to play with. Ppl are pretty toxic.
---
She looks like poppy 😂 but it's a p cool idea
---
I can understand your pain but i still think its great!
---
Says the twitch main
---
Yes
---
Thank you, link please
---
No the fuck we don't
---
"So I don't spend unnecessary money" but buys 27 out of 28 packs
---
He has three shields he can place down and each three are armed with an explosive. The explosive is red box mounted to the shield which you can shoot and it goes boom
---
There was a glitch that they supposedly fixed where it prioritizes people to attack
---
Not spend more than I had to
---
BTW. They can use map rotated upsidedown for halloween to make it more surrealistick
---
I agree there
---
One could argue that bullets travel too fast to suffer any notable trajectory disturbance in the short ranges of Siege engagements, which could make it an interesting defensive "trap" Op alternative to Jäger.

Oh
---
I got his uniform in my first free pack and didn’t get the headgear sadly
---
Back to +1 you go 😆
---
They have a lot of fans in Brazil

Hello giygas88, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dnzvbp/microphone_communication_on_pc_apparently_broken/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I've got a little over 300 hours, but after watching Braction on YouTube I realized just how bad I actually am. His videos are *super* helpful; they've completely changed how I approach Attack, for instance. I'm still working my way through all of them but so far I haven't found one that hasn't taught me something.
---
U should try r/R6operatorcreator
---
I love the concept, it’s just the shotgun......
---
Well would you say that getting wall banged is the majority of your deaths?
---
Now this is clearly a bait. Photos are imported into this by photoshop, seriously, stop. Like those ideas from this one person Fidda, are just broken, DOG? really? AI dependent ability? oh god...
---
I would make the decoys operable similar to an attacker drone. Use the attack button to activate/deactivate the noise. Each drone has a meter that you drain while it makes noise. Needing to drive the drone into position makes the gadget risk/reward as the attackers could hear it being moved, but it allows Soren to set up ambushes without needing to manually walk over and place her gadget each time.
---
Also, instead of default run noise, I would just have it be random operator noise. Getting on/off cams, footsteps, weapon reload, position change, whatever works.
---
How tf does castle have a higher pick rate then goyo
---
I don't know if you know this, but "an American" can be from anywhere else in the world. Weird, right?
---
bro that’s nothing. I got a 8k without losing any hp
---
bro 😎💪
---
That was straight up disrespectful
---
Thomaz
---
And i can't even get through an open one
---
dude you know exactly what my point is and yet you are trying to be somewhat smart but you failed miserably
---
Sound decoys seem really obvious and I don’t know how the design team haven’t thought of them tbh. I’ve been saying since season one they should have them in the game
---
As a Monty main, I felt that... 😥
---
Seems legit I'd hate to have it done to me but I'd enjoy doing this to others 😂👌
---
Smash
---
r/R6OperatorCreator
---
His ads is slower than all Defense characters so that’s kind of a weakness
---
Is zophia dropping in price next season?
---
Ik
---
Yes but without any sort of critical hit mechanic the risk and reward factor of the game will be taken away and will make the game less competitive because rather than taking a risk and going for a higher damage shot you can just a aim at centre of mass or even their foot and still get the kill
---
Shooting people through walls is too luck based to build a whole operator around it
---
And hopefully you'd kill whoever you were shooting at when you shoot them, the TTK is pretty fast around here, so most of the time, pinging someone you shot at wouldn't be much use
---
what?
---
just aim at head level, recoil on controller will always be really difficult to control because its so much harder to make subtle downward flicks when using a semi auto
---
Options for sound would be cool. Not just running sounds, but maybe explosions or gunfire, or a random op's gadget if it makes noise.
---
Black tachanka
---
I love you.
---
Not with all the gadgets and grenades that are available right now, you can have 10 grenades on attack which is a bit too excessive
---
I also hit plat with tachanka
---
This is really good. Do you still draw?
---
Its either you talk or don't.
---
Christ I didn’t know I needed the Bizon
---
That is called witch hunting so be careful
---
I’m sorry you have to deal with that shit.  I was playing with this girl one time and the second she said something two random guys were like “what’s up girl” “you sound hot” and shit like that.  I couldn’t imagine the garbage you have to deal with.  
---
And I bet at least you don’t come on mics at the end and call your teammates trash.
---
Gotta love 93R
---
  Well if you dont get it shit talking is understandable 😩
---
Lol what’s funny is did one of the earlier rounds and won the 1V3
---
it’s on the ubisoft website for dev notes y4 s3
---
Can’t
---
The colors where completly broken, then at the end off the vid my game crashed
---
The guy who took that pic died a second later
---
It happened to me and caused me to drop back to plat
---
You can create a ticket.
---
Anyone played doki doki tho...
---
I didn't know they made her gun in real life!! There is absolutely no differences!!
---
maybe don’t include thunt clips?
---
thanks &lt;3
---
How long have you had the game? Been like this since day 1 my dude
---
Hit heads
---
Operation Health II when?
---
np
---
#MUDA MUDA
---
You are wrong, it is one of the most balanced maps in the game.
---
Clash 35h Maverick 20h but maining nokk rn @ 17h
---
It’s part of the game, adapt to it.
---
They probably don’t follow csgo at all
---
also how do i get the main things
---
Too much time before the original kill. But it is nice
---
Depends on how fast your internet is
---
I love how detailed it is!
---
Actually, pulse scanners exists irl. They r used for exaample by border guards to detect ppl inside trucks
---
I think jackal should get it before mozzie or any other operator to be frank. Jackal doesnt have shit but a pro league set , they need to show him so love even if he’s the top pick for banning .
---
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER
---
Wasn't hard to top the other events, apart from Outbreak. They were either reskins, or a sweaty crouch spamfest.
---
Thanks, I really put my all into it!
---
they would have to give one to all the other year 2 and 3 operators before mozzie, I agree with u that he should get one. *BUT* others need one as well
---
This whole design is just an excuse to get more hot babes in the game. 
---
( I'm not trying to make fun of the design, hearing is crucial in Siege and an operator like this can be a huge game changer. )
---
gUyS WhErE iS nOkK StOp tAkIng pHotOs oF a WaLl
---
yes
---
How did you get that maverick main thing beside your name
---
Be cool if she had an elite where the ability played dubstep 🤣
---
That's actually a great idea!
