Does anyone like the gamemode? It's so boring

Yeah the next day it went back to to normal for me
---
Now this is epic

Explain?

Ngl I do the same shit when I get panicked
---
Even a stun grenade could have messed him up if they tossed it through that hole.
---
I'm not really sure what it does but i decided to swap and my flicks have been more consistent not sure if it's the placebo effect but it seems the updated is better for me
---
When I got the L85A2 skin I fucking flipped out.

I think the only other Black Ice skin I have is for the HK417.

OMG it's the same person

This happened twice to me last night while playing lol

Congrats my doode

Happy cake day

I feel like the report button on PS4 is just there for the sake of it lol. I don’t understand the idea of being toxic in ranked, just makes no sense! Unfortunately though it’s a thing that’ll happen every now and then, and sadly has to be put up with lol

---
Customs? Good. Leave it in.
---
Another game mode? Believe me, you can't see it now, but 2 weeks down the line you'll not be touching it because you would be bored. Casual in all it's cancer still has some variery. Playing 3 ops with no gadgets, same loadouts, etc., gets boring real quick. Plus, data usage. Siege is already running thin on data. They can't risk wastage anywhere.
---
It’s not it’s his second channel

Imagine you got black ice from that lmao
---
This is a thing of beauty.
---
Restart the game, it worked for me.
---
Since when is diamond purple?
---
No, it's Neil DeGrasse Tyson!
---
Not worth it. Loading times would be ridiculous for a feature you only use for a little bit at a time.
---
This is the same thing as 4 guys picking recruit and the other dude getting TKed immediately

Good thing itd only be in casual so who cares

I'm not saying to blame everyone else. You always need to recognize when it's your fault, but it's not always your fault. Rainbow Six is a team game, and it's up to the *team* to get shit done.

Ubi doesn’t actually let players pull them anymore. They give them to you tubers for pack openings sometimes. But other than that have fun pulling the family dollar version of it. Don’t know how this guy got it lol. /s

I got Black Ice on my first too. Of course, I didn't have the op so I forgot about. Skip a year, here we are customizing Thatcher because I didn't use him much and I see Black Ice AR33(I think). Only Black Ice

I love you

just you

You're doing gods work

I think this could lead to some issues. It would end up with the same effect fortnite has. A lot of people have the idea that if you don’t have cool cosmetics then you are lesser than everyone else in the lobby (this is mostly an issue for children and people who are competitive and feel like they need to impress people). Fortnite has this and it has been a huge issue that children will spend their parents money simply because they want to fit in or that people will buy everything that’s new because it’s the new cool thing and then next month there is another new thing that everyone likes so the process repeats itself. My opinion is that I like that there is cosmetics in the game (and that a large percentage are available for in game currency as well as real money) but I think they should be kept relatively low-key.
---
 And I know it's my time to go...
---
Add in an extra 50 lbs somewhere in there and you’re good
---
Yeah, but I thought it was more unnerving farther away and I dont know how to transfer an Xbox screenshotnto my Iphone, sorry :/
---
I’m a Sledge/Valk main so Wardens loadout is perfect for me. But come on, he would be less useless if he had the DEAGLE
---
Am Plat, can confirm we're complete idiots.

Shut up kid

you should post this to CoD subreddit or something like that, honestly rocks that theme well(kinda reminds me of the new upcoming CoD?)

Bartlett would be a decent map if they just added one or two more door entrances and fixed the spawn peel angles with either trees or just shuttering the windows. It seems like a waste of resources to only have the map be used in T Hunt and customs

Its not even subtle either :/

goodluck

It’s for Thermite too that’s crazy
---
You can play cas with your buddies, and there are times when I just wanna play without the maximum input that I’m capable of and still winning. And people won’t get better if they die in the first 30 seconds of every round. I have plat 2 and 1 friends and I’m not playing ranked with them because I know that I would only suck and we would lose because of me. And if you look at the numbers then you can see that there are much more boosters than people with different skill levels playing together. 9 out of 10 matches there are boosters when there is high rank differences. So why should the majority suffer so the minority could play together?
---
Tbh I don't know. It's a plat 2 / High plat 3 game
---
Yes.
---
just breakdance lol
---
I play solo most of the time.. is not THAT bad as long as you’re in a good rank. For sure you’ll have some terrible or troll team and you’re gonna lose because of that but try not to get too frustrated and move on to the next match with more confidence. 
---
Also, if you find teammates that are good or at least decent try to ask them to continue, if you find trolls or people that don’t hit a bullet wait a few minutes before entering another ranked just to be sure you’re not playing with them again. 
---
A tactical tip I can give you is try to not trust they calls but always listen to them so you know you can have a potential good information to use. 
---
Play like you are 1v5, be careful in every corner, every site, stairs and stuff like that even if a teammate it’s covering that spot.
---
Man it seems like they had victory blinders on and you not panick firing destroyed them
---
What platform are you on
---
What country is that from?
---
Then why does your title make absolutely no sense?
---
I pressed down and enter for a solid 15 mins
---
That's because they aren't shotguns, as far as the game is concerned they're DMRs.
---
Nice
---
Xbox
---
yes but actually no
---
If you are on a console, yes, it will transfer.
---
YEAHHHH!!!!!!! NICE JOB FELLOW OPERATOR

And are you staying on Xbox?

The correction of yours is so important that the world would have exploded without it. Thank you for saving all of us and all hail our new god!
---
This is a video game, if Ubisoft made your dumb idea real the player base would drop. Nobody would play a game where they can’t play a competitive mode with their friends bc they have different skill levels. It’s just not realistic. They would never split the playerbase like that. 
---
&amp; Look at what numbers? There are zero statistics on boosters and people playing with friends. You completely made that up.
---
Monty forgot his shield.
---
It really do be like that
---
Probably smg-11
---
I mean Warden is basically useless. His gadget is way too situational, it requiring you to stand still for it to work encourages you to hold angles only problem is none of his guns have access to ACOG nor are they any good at a range, well at least compared to other weapons that is. Nokk is ok I guess. It sucks that they recycled weapons from other OPs, it takes away from the appeal of spending renown on them.
---
bruh just lick the poop off

Oh. I always wondered why I had ash’s elite skin.

AFAIK the YouTube channel is run by a different person who just collects the clips from the stream and splits the revenue with Shroud. Therefore he would try to get as much money out of it as possible for his cut to be worth more.
---
She has a pistol.
---
big facts. plus was he out of ammo? why didn’t he just shoot monty in the back instead of trying to get all up on him
---
Base ops have to now be earned regardless of edition.
---
They both need acogs to be useful
---
Really? I had everyone chat muted and wasn't getting them anymore the only time I had it happen. Must have just been dumb luck that I muted and everyone stopped them I apologize.
---
Oh my bad you’re right! July 02nd 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Gotcha
---
Really? I thought they were all unlocked. Weird.
---
Oh no😱
---
Thats how its supposed to be. Thats how it was forever then they changed it and now its back to what its supposed to be
---
lol you downvoted me because you are triggered
---
Okay. Thanks
---
So true
---
I'm just saying a map pick sydtem for casual would be completely redundant because only a few maps would be played
---
And, most importantly, they didn't have a rotation into Vents from Workshop and they had a purely intel op (Valk) and still had no idea a plant was going down. 
---
Which would have stopped this whole thing before it even started.
---
For an operator whose job is to enter obj and take down anchors, FMG 9 is just inadequate for her imo. Ppl are often like "you need to get very close" and "get headshots" but there's more instances when that's not possible especially when going against Anchor who are doing  their job to certain degree. Nokk feels like she heavily rely on Defenders doing bad rather than the player doing well with her. 
---
I thought her power was OP when she was leaked until my teammate told me "just watch the door and she's completely useless". And he has been right so far. 
---
I don't know what she needs more: higher damage or an ACOG. If Acog, would love for her to have MP5SD since it's basically FMG with an ACOG and integrated silencer (which really fits her style).
---
No need to apologize, i thought the same thing at first. hey no chat = no issue eh? 
---
That was until i joined a casual of all games and the server was lagging for everyone while we had 9-15ms ping. One of the solo players on the other team was spamming team chat after they died.
---
That’s why I play secure area
---
You are playing Pulse. Why are you rotating through stairs without using the most useful gadget for information. You could have figured out Hibana was playing hallway 90 and then either chose not to rotate or try to pressure vertically. 
---
You should have shown us the killcam to but I assume she say your head and the perspective issues rn make it tough sometimes.
---
that's what I thought!  thanks for that!  It seems that only I have this problem🤷🏻‍♂️
---
What’s even the point in whining about shit that’s been fixed? Are you still upset about how broken Lion was? I fucking hated it, ruined the game for me. Now it’s fixed, I like the game, and I don’t sit here and be negative as fuck about the past
---
Thats why you need a squad, playing solo is seriously shit
---
Once you restart your game it should all go back to normal. It's an issue that has arisen in the game a few times in the past, but once you restart your game it shouldn't continue to be an issue.
---
Thank you!
---
They used to be very expensive, as expensive as buying Year 1 ops with renown. They changed it last year to where everyone who played during Y3 got base ops free. They restructured their editions for Y4 and made base ops charge again for renown, but at a very low price. I think Ultimate edition should include these ops, and only standard edition should have the paid base ops. Sucks but you'll get them all fairly quick. At least you weren't around for paid attachments! Those are free for everyone now.
---
That’s why I never watch people I only go to cams or else I back seat game...
---
it's a old feature that came back
---
Unfortunately, I have it from one day to the next in the inventory ... the shortly after the last update ... seems like this problem only with me
---
My team isn't the best I'll put it that way. I don't often get the opportunity to use his gadget that way because they don't really act on calls like that. But yeah the perspective is strange. In the kill cam she saw my entire body but I didn't see an ounce of her.
---
What do you mean?

If you’re falling, you gotta be falling with style

Idk I guess it's just that the picture is not designed to be a skin so the joysticks and all of the buttons block out a load of the key features. I get it if you like it though.

And you’re who exactly?
---
How about don't team kill at all
---
On July 4th 1776 the US gained independence from England. I thought it was a funny coincidence when i loaded up Rainbow Six today
---
Ok
---
I knew that
---
It's not Ranked. They're on Plane, 2 - 0 is match point, and there are no banned Ops.
---
Ehh, usually I'd agree but he did it the first round, was excused. Did it again.
---
He doesn't make these videos. So technically "this guy" is not correct to say.
---
I fell your pain
---
But
---
The smoke and anti flash vision is absurdly strong for a defender.
---
Even just having Warden on your team has an impact because the enemy team now have to content with not smoking areas for plants or cover because it gives you the advantage.
---
Just picking him changes the enemy teams strategy or prevents regular strategies whilst Warden is alive.
---
No it's not about the campaigns, I'm not referring to games like Vegas. but the ones where you needed to create an attack plan that squads of AI would follow. I reaaaaally like siege, but I'm bad at strategy on the spot under pressure. And I could spend hours designing the perfect synchronized strategy for the squads. BTW, raven shield was the last game that had this. The major things those games didn't have are the great controls shooters have developed over the years.

Get them through dice roll at end of showdown match

Except she isn't.

2 speed and a terrible defender weapon.  She isn't rushing anything.

Unless the enemy simply don't know you are there against compotent defenders you lose every engagement.

You bring no utility for your team.

Well you can put actually good looking skins on your weapons instead, that's a win.

Late comment here but Nokk feels so underwhelming. While she is appearing more often than Warden, I’d say that give a bit more time and I doubt she will get picked that often. 
---
I don’t see a reason for picking her over Ashe or Mav for fragging especially when they can compete against Anchors and provide utilities. Anchors just need to pressure entry points and her stealth immediately becomes much less useful.
---
congrats man!
---
Keep your crosshair/sight always at headlevel
---
While i tell myself i would have had at least one kill if the game would “register the headshots”..  
---
:(
---
What...? Are you retarded?
---
Got that one down pretty good, was supreme in csgo. If you don’t know that is the second highest rank so I’ve got that strat pretty locked into my head. Any other tips? Never can be to many!
---
Late comment here but it’s more to do with giving him an ACOG without giving MP5 to another operator.
---
Ehm no ddos also happens on ps4. I assume that you play at "lower" ranks. Ddoser are mostly on highplat and diamond elo because they don't lose which is because of the ddos. I experience it in a daily base and I even know people personally (who I don't like) who can ddos. As I said if you are gold or lower you will probaly not experience it
---
well they changed starter edition so the base operators are really easy to get lol

Extra thiccccccccccc&lt;3

Cant carry if there is no enemy team to carry the team over I suppose.

Why? Why can’t they sweat or tryhard.

---
Rook serves a better purpose than Warden at that point, Ubi definitely needs to buff him because no one is picking him for his gadget
---
The worst is calling out enemy locations and they just flat out ignore you.
---
Especially when you make a specific callout that you know they can wall bang or nade from safety

I have the opposite feeling, ranked is like a haven for me. I find most people take it seriously in comparison to the riskier plays in casual. I would definitely agree with you about squad numbers, the higher the better. Random are the worst.

No. Im saying, if you allow friendly fire on your game, dont be surprised when people use it to grief.

Noice, I got that doge charm recently too, I run it on Mozzies primaries. Because he resembles Owen Wilson and he is know for saying 'wow' a lot in his films. This satisfies me a lot and i don't know quite why.

This is so fucking true and people just flex with their monty 3k’s which are shit
---
This post is garbage, you don't even state one argument why the hipfire should be buffed. Put some efforts in your requests and then it would maybe get discussed by the Devs.
---
What a load of nonsense. The game would be so much worse without friendly fire, your assertion is just crap.
---
The people are the problem.
---
That has happened to me at least 3 times (not with the alpha pack must have been another bug)&gt;
---
It took me an hour and 15 minutes to put everything back on how i liked it, absolute piss-take.

I had the same only on themapark

Yeaaaah. Showdown was fun but I'm not going to play it anymore if I have to reset all of my attachments every time I do :|
---
-nvidia control panel
---
-change resolution
---
-cumstomize
---
-set the hz you wanna try. I'd go up in multiple of 5 and just remember with as with any overclocking it can do your tech harm and voids warranties. Worth it tho, that extra 5hz has made a difference for me

Search on discord/forum for teammates, most likely faster than waiting 60 minutes :)

*Wait, that's illegal.*
---
That gamesense tho
---
Congrats buddy.
---
Conpletly setious, I'm copper 3 and play for fun. Comp siege is wierd for me
---
Wth does EA ready mean?
---
Outstanding sir. I’m happy for you. Wish I was this good.
---
Great shading my dude
---
How about remove all weapons from the game and add an op with a middle shooting later tracking bulletproof shield hammer. Also some diamond advice here create another account put it in anywhere between bronze and plat 3 and when you don’t want to sweat your balls off on the game play that. Trust me it’s worth it
---
But if you restart the game the loadout comes back to normal
---
That looks like cheif hopper
---
Nah the hardest thing is getting a shit talking plat 3 in casual to stfu 😂😂😂
---
Wow, I got that notification literally as he came on screen
---
That's mad improvement over the course of one year and you should be very, very proud
---
Basically it means the game has little to no bugs and is ready for professional gameplay.
---
That’s my understanding anyways
---
My comment was sarcastic btw
---
Well if you look closely, OP's playing on console
---
This is much more useful than Ying.
---
I would love that
---
R6 players are like T-Rex, if you stay really still (and don’t have your gun out) 9/10 they won’t notice you.
---
Doesnt matter, i play on console but dont move so slow
---
Wait... you boosted yourself in Gold 2 and now you try to learn to play better because everybody else in gold 2 outskilled you? Anyway you can watch the pro league on twitch or other r6 players with high rank and learn how they play these operators, helped me a lot so far
---
I has sth similar on the theme park map
---
And yet i struggle to get gold, I’m not bad at the game, it’s just that i always get matched up with tryhard enemies and bot teammates, i usually get 10 kills per match and still lose, currently i am Silver III
---
I think they meant to say "esports ready"
---
Most people on yt are like no one cares that you got an ace. But for the average player it's huge. I've got well over 100 hours in the game and only managed to get two 5 man aces and 1 ace when the other team only had 4 players not sure if that counts as an ace.
---
But anyway. Well find. It's not an easy thing to do to get an ace.
---
I think thats just the truth...
---
People are only doing what they can.
---
u mean 20 years 2 days and 20 minutes just to load 1%
---
No? EA stands for Electronic Arts and is game development and publishing company, the same as ubisoft or blizzard. That's like calling a movie Warner Bros ready... and I got the obvious sarcasm.
---
No finally you're awake.. what is this?!

Wish you to get diamond very soon

My friend who's new to the game had this happen to him the first time he played Hibana. Afterwords he played her as a worse Ash and didn't believe me she was a hard breacher.

It's just you trying to excuse people like you

How is that cheese and how are they "tryharding"? He just planted and protected the plant, is that cheese? Or is just using a shield cheese now? And shut the fuck up about "tryhards", what, should i not play to win so other people can fuck around? Nah man.

A good one would be Fuze and in the background have hostages

Hey, spyroz

I really like the Game and started Solo. The only Problem with beeing solo is in my Opinion to Climb in Ranked. Its possible but harder than playing with some Mates (cause u cant Ace all the Time ;D and not all Players are able to play as a Team). But there is a good chance that u find Mates Ingame or through Forums if u wish. I never regret that i bought R6. Have a good one. 
---

Well done,

Try get tilting into your game, get that extra edge around corners
---
Insane learning curve at first so be ready for that
---
I care &lt;3
---
Were they removed in casual?
---
I think any operator that kills me shouldn’t be in the game too! Lmao
---
I don't think Ubi wants to pay the license to that.
---
We, just as you Fuze Mains, are misanthropic and bear a deep hate towards our allies.
---
That and we get very tense sorry.
---
alright, nice! gonna pick it up today then or tommorow.
---
im glad it was fuze, Lord Tachanka's 2nd
---
Great job boss
---
Underrated.
---
Good shit amigo! Aye let us know when you get that 1 v 5 man. Also cheers to many more Aces amigo.
---
gratz fren
---
now youll be chasing that high for years.
---
Fuze is best at hostage
---
No ads to stop you now
---
Haven’t played in so long didn’t know they changed
---
hmm i looked it up but i’ve never tried that 3090 sensor but if it works for you in other FPS games you should be good. i only use my thumb button for push to talk so 2 side buttons is all you should need.
---
You know that you are a bit asshole and he is just starting the game prob?
---
She's ones of the best defenders, start playing her!
---
After you finally understood, I will.
---
Nothing to understand from your idiocy.
---
I restarted the game and launcher and it was back to normal
---
LEAN. but good job
---
Everything will be back as it was.  I made a mistake starting the setup again.  I set up the main ones, after restarting the old settings on all units except those I touched returned to their places.
---
I just dont see why he's using it when he should be using Angled, Supressor, Red Doot and Laser
---
Poetry.
---
I care, because I hate ranked and never touch it.
---
Just leave it where it belongs in custom.
---
Or, here's a crazy thought, why not allow players to toggle non-ranked maps they are okay with queuing into for Casual, so we can stop immediately leaving matches when it's Plane or Tower, or god forbid fucking Favela.
---
 Could be that the timer of the button hold is not properly synced up with the interrogation animation . Still , you stabbed her in the neck lol that’s bullshit
---
You lost 2-4
---
Thank you, i need it!
---
Thank you
---
Yeah it works fine on FPS games, i play at the lowest DPI and i tinker around mouse sensitivity so it's generally fine.
---
Well the part of me shooting 3 people in the head with the same bullet Deadpool style was pure skill the rest was just luck
---
Just call me Doob the Noob!
---
Sweet flick on the doc for a console player. And congrats on the ace bud
---
You can call out whatever you want in sub gold, it doesn’t mean your team does the listening thing!
---
i like learning curves, because once you get all the hard stuff done it feels satisfying.
---
Way too go man! After your first it really feels like they come more often. You should be leaning more tho
---
"Niko, you came! Let's play bowling"
---
its a terrible idea. im not waiting in queue just for it to get canceled
---
That’s a fair point, maybe have a mechanic where it has less damage reduction from armor class?
---
Idk it should be
---
I have no idea
---
Thanks for the kind words! This was about a week ago and I’ve started leaning much more.
---
I put it on when I first got Frost and I haven't taken it off.
---
But queues don’t take that long... more often than not, I can get into a ranked game in about 12 - 30 seconds.
---
This mechanism still exist in all black ops zombies games also xD
---
A soul for a soul
---
Thanks heaps, it means alot

*YOU CAN HOLD THE SLEDGE HAMMER?*
---
Thank you so much!
---
That sucks. I'm level 101 and I have it for probably 9 different operators. I guess I've been lucky
---
Confirmed don’t care!
---
I remember my own ace. Tachanka, Oregon, Tower Site, Tachanka Turret. It was glorious.
---
can confirm, I won a game by holding a door from behing the hostage, the glaz shot him.
---
For Nokk? Yeah we can hear her when she runs even with her gadget on, and she glitches on cameras
---
Of course, I’ll upvote all your aces.
---
It's the same as if you get headshot by a teammate you shouldn't instantly die. Atleast get knocked so the toxic people don't cum because they killed you.
---
Exploit what?
---
Yeah, I literally sprayed my gun and got 3 kills and was like, “ummm you guys see that?”
---
I have 20 hours in pvp
---
Why u bully me :v
---
Red
---
The one-clip wonder
---
I always like the idea of shotguns doing extra damage against 1 armor, giving Defenders more definite counter. But then shotguns in general already do pretty decent damage against 1 armor operator in close combat and it's more for the balance reasoning after all. 
---
If we looked too much at realism, many Defenders will end up have a very difficult time taking down Attackers due to using 9mm or .45 guns.
---
Thanks loads. Not even sure how I hit the doc, I guess adrenaline kicked in.
---
Holy Jesus
---
I my not care but congrats
---
That was great dude please make more
---
Ads’s don’t look like an attacker gadget
---
Also what show was that song from?
---
Drake and Josh
---
NEITHER DO MOZZIE DRONES THEY'RE OUTLINED
---
Expected the actual song not some videogamedunkey rip off
---
Late comment but one thing I realized that having stealth aspect isn't as efficient as Roamers like Vig and Cav. Roamers can be anywhere on the map and attack from various of angles while Nokk being a fragging Attacker, her destination is obj and her options are far more limited. 
---
It doesn't matter if she can bypass all the cams if Anchors are doing their job of pressuring entry points. She doesn't have the damage or range to compete against Anchors, some of which might even have higher DPS as well.
---
Unlucky
---
K thx
---
Oh I thought they changed it so that you get all of the year 1 dlc operators, which would mean you got 8? That sucks, if it makes you feel better 20 of those operators are the really cheap ones which only cost up to 2000 in game renown, which doesnt take too much to get. The other 8 are the year 1 dlc operators which mentioned. 
---
Sucks that you only have 4 either way, at least you can specialise in those operators, if you want a silver lining.
---
FAKE,not enough recoil ;)
---

---
It should be, but this is Ubi!
---
From my experience I just kept changing it around every so often. Never make a drastic change though, always make small adjustments then play a little to see how it feels and if you think it needs to go higher or lower. Ideally getting used to a somewhat higher sensitivity is better for those situations where you need to turn quickly.
---
But if you find you’re going too far past to the left or right of your target and having to compensate, your horizontal is too high. Whereas if you go too far above or below, your vertical is too high. Having a vertical that’s a bit lower than your horizontal has been pretty good for me.
---
In all honesty all you can do is keep fiddling around with it until you find something that works.
---
I salute you

Hello jagerourking007, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c9gpml/im_sick_of_this_guy_already_hes_the_reason_why/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
My first ace was defending the kitchen on yacht. My entire team died and they were securing. My sausage smacked them.
---
Especially if it’s a 5 man and your solo there’s not much you can do. But, if I play against people who clearly outplay me I try and learn every mistake I made and how they got the upper hand. That’s all this game is, learning and adapting. You can’t ever go into games thinking one playstyle will always work.
---
if they remove the ability to copper boost it will be amazing to see the number of people drop from diamond
---
I respect a man who doesn’t a play on 400million sensitivity. Good shit.
---
I wouldn't say impossible. More common cause Ubisoft logic. My highest was 96 before I got a pack. When I got there I was curious what would happen when I reach 100%
---
Yeah, I'm the latter half.

Is bandit the Designated driver?

Still waiting for my ace :(
---
Yeah,think.
---
No what he said is wrong. Hot chopper and plasma pink have been confidned to be removed. This has been clarified countless times. If you search for the "alpha packs skin list", you'll find a Google sheet with all packs and whether they are in the game or not. I don't know about the brass, but hot chopper and plasma pink are out for sure.
---
For years I played on a very low sens, ever since the ole COD 4 days. 1-2 years ago while playing Siege I decided that I wanted to up my sens so I can flick and turn around faster etc. 
---
Went in to T hunt, after 2 hours of actually wanting/commiting I was using double the sens, something which I never thought I'd be able to do before.
---
I'm on console as well and we have deadzone, this got adjusted to the lowest possible setting at the same time. I wasn't perfect after 2 hours, that's just how long it took for me to really see the improvement.
---
It’s not confusing at all tho lmao
---
Nice. I have only had I think 3. All ok defense with kapkan
---
I'd hope that some of the money from those fuckin' loot boxes would go towards it at least.
---
sad to hear :(

this post is a joke

He has a right to post whatever he wants so long as he doesn't break the law.
---
Agreed... And I play Echo A LOT
---
Congrats and we'll done
---
Yes that is totally what i was doing
---
He'll yeah brotha
---
Shit you right
---
Playing Fuze on hostage. I too like to play dangerously
---
But he breaks the game, I know it’s sounds stupid to report someone for only a video game but he ruined everyone’s fun. Believe me, 90% of why siege is unplayable is because of this guy videos
---
keep in mind that for mnk lower sens is usually better. start low and flick to a target, if you overshoot lower it a bit and vice versa. Good luck!
---
Luminosity
---
I think you can delete your saved data in the storage section in options. Why tho?
---
For the original 20 operators it's not too bad,individually anyway.  You can do the daily challenges and if you go to the Ubisoft club there are weekly challenges which help to grand bonus renown. 
---
The DLC operators are all a lot more expensive, the lowest they ever get to is 10,000 renown (depending on when they were released).
---
Did something similar as Rook the other night playing while drinking:
---
Proceeds to get blitzed, tries to set down plates for team. Finger slips off of the bumper and hits right trigger. Proceeds to dome the fuck out of teammate by accident. Get stared at by everyone for a second. I teabag to assert dominance.
---
you don't. Hope that helped
---
Why do you think it's ok to teamkill people who do this? You do realize it's most likely a mistake, right?
---
XD
---
9/10 for Mr bear.

Pull down.

The buff to the Scorpion's recoil made it way easier to manage but I still tend to fire in bursts.

If you activate his account as your primary on the ps4 then you can play the game on both accounts but I don’t know about the Ubisoft account thing

I trust you on that. I rarely play mira, but when I do, that's the uniform I use

Been playing rainbow six since 1999, and every iteration since. Bought the collectors edition of this game ( my first ever) and have played every single possible day I could since the very first hour of the closed alpha. Until there is a new rainbow six game, this is it for me for shooters. Nothing else gets played.
---
Woah, you just noclipped into the backrooms of siege.
---
Where is hostage
---
Then there's no point in doing that. Fuzing the hostage is your duty as fuze
---
I care OP
---
Nice ace!
---
Why would the enemy hit my blitz shield with another shield tho?
---
Well we see Jägers grave so we can assume its in the future, so maybe Bandits well known drug use caught up to him. Stay off drugs kids.
---
Oh that's pretty bad then
---
Nope, I just fixed tho
---
Nice man. I personally have never gotten an ace but I got a 4K with Kaid and it get nice :).
---
You prob play like the person that walked in the way and get mad that they team killed you and tk them next round
---
I get that I’m illiterate
---
AR33 is better than L85 tho

Due to the amount of upvotes I think everyone cares

If only we had alpha pack stats breaking down the number of each rarity we've received. I've bought around 500, and earned far more than that with very few legendaries. Disappointing that Ubisoft is removing older legendaries every season when there is no chance of collecting them all.
---
Haha that sounds like a tactical ban then 😂
---
I’ll take it. I have 0 black ice
---
EG imo. I dislike rouge with a passion.
---
Even if it didn't do much I actually liked that they did something like operation Health it shows that Ubi cares about the game even if it's in their own way. At the end of the day Ubi is a business and I'll always expected a company to prioritize making money than spending it to fix the game. We just gotta roll with the punches and hope eventually they'll find someway to fix these problems.
---
Did nobody have a headset? How did you manage a hot breach without dying putting on the charge?

PLEASE

Ubisoft pays for the cheapest version of BattleEye

they're removing skins?

Nice 😂😂

If you are mobile, clicks the rainbow six sub reddit and be taken to the main page, then click the three dots in the top right and press change user flair

The one on Kafe has little shards of glass around the edges from where it was previously broken, I always thought it was the noise of those breaking off when you vault in.

Thank you so much for the tips! My brother also gifted me a corsair keyboard

It seems the legendaries have a time frame in Ubisoft's eyes, and they'd rather remove them when adding more than making a larger legendary pool.

huh, interesting

Lmao you can see him fly up like fucking Jesus.

honestly idk, I killed someone from that window and assumed more would come

No breach charge = shotgun 👌
---
I think it’s a good 4K, especially since it was a 1v4. Good job op
---
I’ll take your entire stock!
---
As a new mozzie player I can relate. Had a teammate shoot my first ever jacked twitch drone (not happy)
---
Good job! First aces are great feelings
---
As someone who votes to ban mozzie I vote to ban this message
---
Wait, did BattlEye ban you?
---
Play bomb instead of secure area

Were aids simple as that
---
lesion is for serious gameplay alibi is for fun 😁
---
Thank you :)
---
GG my dude.  Throw an angled grip on that rifle, ADS is so much faster...
---
Yup shes still one of my favorites, she doesnt have grenades anymore
---
i saw a skin today on alibis gun that looked like a dragon, i thought you wers talking about that one
---
You sound like a nice person 😊
---
I had this happen to me once, i then learned to not queue while opening packs lol
---
Any bans made by BattleEye are always public, it doesn’t mean there was a person in your match banned just that someone has been banned and is announcing it on every active server in the region
---
as much as i hate this kind of shit i'm afraid the world is all about sex and money since the dawn of time. but yeah people like this are pathetic
---
im already set on alibi, but thank you!
---
&gt;communicate 
---
What teammates are you playing with
---
Lol no a realist one
---
Yea casual is pretty bad. I couldn’t tell you what the reason for team killing you is. It could be just for fun. It could be that you did something to them (destroying gadget, blocking door, shooting them even on accident, etc.) or it could be that you “made the team lose the round” and they want to punish you. I guess just be considerate of others get good and accept it. It sucks but the community is toxic.
---
Gonna sound like a noob, but are you saying don't kill aim to arm/disarm?
---
People are quick to be toxic rather than assume maybe they just don't know
---
Nintendo Switch port confirmed
---
I have 5 aces.....*puts on cowboy hat* on showdown
---
Doc but if the Doc is shit then Rook
---
Friends  instead of randoms
---
And now I'm imagining ppl raging about this too "How was that not pooterscoot shot!?!?!"
---
Noobtubeing is back
---
Casual is toxic especially with lower levels, play bomb until you’re a high enough level for ranked and then play ranked. Ranked can still be toxic but it is much less so
---
People don’t like playing with low levels,I suggest playing the newcomer mode as you won’t get teamkilled very often
---
Mozzie main here, I reinforce the ‘I will kill you if you kill all my captured drones’ message.
---
Were you reinforcing rotate holes? I’ve seen people get team killed for that
---
no, it was not me being banned. First game and 2 people were banned after first and second round.
---
She went through a period after her first nerf when she was basically unplayable. But now she is actually a viable choice IMO
---
I like the idea of a difference in noise, but instead, what if Mozzie drones would go around playing Owen Wilson saying “wow”?
---
maybe they sacrificed themselves valiantly in battle for the king to survive.
---
I won't ;)
---
Thanks again :p
---
I had a teammate on attack that would shoot drones, not walk through claymores and back away then shoot them and on defense would shoot all defender gadgets
---
you sure? cause the first one was on our team and the second was on the opposing team.
---
just a quick tip if you wanna get a bit more tactical, dont have a gun skin on so its harder to tell between the holgrams and yourself.
---
Rook. Because I can put down my armour and roam and spawn peek ands shit. If I do that with doc I can't be around my team to heal them
---
If you plan on taking the game serious I’d hold off for now.
---
If you rather have fun, yes.  The scorpion though having a wild recoil is still fun to use and the FO12 shotgun is just a nasty bitch.
---
Hello spo0o0ky, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c9jmee/psa_chat_spam_lagging_is_still_not_fixed/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
/r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow PSAs because of repetitive abuses.
---
Choose a different title and re-submit your post. Thank you.
---
sounds like you need to switch which servers you're playing on to me.
---
I honestly didn’t know Mozzie hacked drones, so I would shoot all drones just to see “-10 team gadget destroyed” and get confused. Now that I own Mozzie and play him every now and then, I understand the struggle, and will never shoot another teammate drone again............. but I swear to god if I drop my rook plates as soon as the round starts, and I still see “🛡2” when the attackers deploy, someone is fucking getting TKed
---
then you are an asshole, you are not helping yourself win either. Also, you don't have to be that toxic just because someone is toxic or he made a mistake, because let's be honest, most times people misskill the drone, you don't have to go like a 5 year old and kill his gadgets, that behavior will only contribute to a toxic match and you are screwing ALL of your team, not just you and the guy who killed your drone.
---
I was arguing was some chucklefuck the other day who said he didn't care enough to not shoot the drones even with this shit
---
But you're a thermite main?
---
/s
---
He’s trying to teach you how to dougie
---
U r right. Nobody gives a fuck about console hostage casual gameplay :)
---
I started on that but could not get a kill even when offering sexual favours 😂 moved to casual and seemed to play better and get better results. Maybe I will drop back and see if I'm any better
---
That’s quite nice my dude
---
ooooooh thats nice, thank you!
---
Oh dang, what are the odds?
---
Do you think Warden will teach me how to Dougie?
---
Were the people that were banned in your game?
---
Wait a second.....
---
Excessive usage of a mouse can cause carpel tunnel syndrome, resulting in being asked to completely avoid MnK. I would know because I've been asked to do the same because I was on the verge of getting that.
---
Something seems off.
---
Bans are 100% global messages. Has nothing to do with who is in your game.
---
It’s entirely possible but unlikely that they were both in your game, if they were in your game then they would also be kicked and a “___ has been removed from the match” message would be there as well.
---
I would like to have these ways of fun  *PLEASE*
---
i'd like to know how you can get an ace when the enemy team is 3 players
---
That’s just lucky? I guess. Bans are globally broadcasted
---
No i mean go into matchmaking preferences and turn off “hostage” and “secure area” so you only play bomb. I found that all the teamkilling and toxicity was in secure area, as soon as i started playing more bomb the toxicity pretty much is nonexistent compared to it
---
Yall flairs are cool and all but..
---
Thats the same as attackers destryoing claymores and standing still during Lion scans
---
All the call outs I coulda gave but instead my drone gets shot by a dumbass teammate. Easiest TK decision ever
---
Would it just be 68.67 and 85.84? (Ingame would be 68 and 85)
---
You really asking how?
---
Oh, then I must be making wrong assumptions. My bad.
---
Regardless, ubi has thin gray area of operation where they can grant accesses and still not introduce any loopholes, so it is the ISP regulations that must be relaxed, which would inturn help developers figure out hackers quickly and perma ban them if possible.
---
Different strokes for different folks 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
So you need the dlc ops?
---
Yep, and all of my headgears and uniforms
---
This is awesome.
---
Going by the data, nah.
---
go in game with your original sens. measure your mousepad how far your mouse goes doing a 180 and a 360. don't forget to also ads and measure those and there u go just replicate that with your new multiplier
---
She’s broken ever since they gave her the claymore just causing glitches
---
What we looking at?
---
Or that lol
---
I should really change that, at this point I play more Nomad than Thermite
---
Lol. Besides that fucking jager part. I almost didnt post this cause how potato that jager kill was. Be to be fsir i was drunk and tried lmfao
---
“Not sure if anyone will care” proceeds to get 10k upvotes and 2 awards.
---
ps. Congrats man 👌👌
---
But doesn’t that also go for iq too with the data
---
I know the top person was in my game because he was on my team talking mad shit and somehow killing people 2 seconds from spawn. The second was just pure timing I suppose.
---
Glad to see on PC how well cheat detection works. I was supper worried I'd be walking into a shit show of wall hacks and such. Community pretty kick-ass to boot
---
Exactly. Ubi pls let me dual wield!
---
You unlocked the hidden dance
---
She's in the balanced zone unless I am referring to wrong data.
---
I don't have any operator that need to be bought with renown so i don't have frost,buck,cav,echo,mozzie and the rest
---
Idk I’m just saying about iq’s data when she had frags
---
I haven't seen it happen recently.
---
No one expects it Round 1
---
worst i ever had was around 17000, but 24555 is just, im sorry
---
Nice, sorry for Nokk though but it had to be done.
---
Nice dance moves
---
glocks are really snappy. 1911s are really comfortable
---
Thx!
---
I'm not trying to make any points. Your position is pointless. There isn't argurment to be had for it. I'm actively trying to point this out by belittling it.
---
*Russian National Anthem intensifies*
---
Yet my teammates still shoot them
---
I wouldn't listen to this person, they're not actually using any data that is relevant
---
Only universal I want is pink, just so I can have a pink AA12
---
Ok.
---
sledge is still meta, hes the undisputed god when playing vertical, giving him a gun with a faster fire rate, isnt all that of a solid idea. 
---
people are here because their is no game like siege
---
Im confused as who where you are referring too
---
bad idea
---
It's a common problem.  Restarting the game after playing showdown works for me. Annoying I know.
---
Worst I’ve had was 100 how do you get this high?
---
Why
---
I'm (Theakstons) playing incredibly well and I have a 1.9 ranked K/D. We ended up losing this match, I lost MMR and I'm still playing incredibly; it's completely unfair. 
---
It's all down to how lucky you are and how good your team is.
---
So how do you avoid getting shot the second you get to the site (before ducking)? Ask a teammate to lay suppressing fire?
---
Depends if they do it on purpose. If not then I either let them be or do a little bit of damage
---
Her pick rate has risen since then, and Fink's had risen but has fallen again. Win Delta is high for finka, but due to such a small sample space, the data isn't credible.
---
She's pretty balanced now.
---
When your running 1 frame every 30 minutes
---
After playing since the beginning.. I have yet to get a Black Ice.. And im cheesed.
---
Usually you get the previous season's Deltas at the midseason announcements and dev blogs iirc
---
No one ever said siege's ranked system made sense. Siege dgaf about how good you are only if you win or lose. It's easily the worst ranked system in a competitive game, ever.
---
Get Hibana first. Then buck, then Mira, valk. Jackal can wait.
---
I main Rook and shooting the team plates before everyone gets one, thats a tk offense, bucko.
---
I had this same thing happen. They tried to kick me not liking my tactics and I clutched a 1v4 and then said get fucked to whoever voted to kick lol.
---
I just don’t want my main banned again
---
 If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe   
---
I'd been married long time ago   
---
Where did you come from, where did you go?   
---
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
---
Now watch me whip
---
yea at the moment i was confused how the enemy didnt die too
---
Hahahaha this is great
---
Likewise, Bruv.
---
We could disable her claymore.
---
Well, what kinda becomes problematic is when they try to talk to me. In Japan, where from experience and from what I'm told their gaming culture basically ends up with no one talking, not even for comms, at all more often than not, where everyone just pings. In SEAS, however, I do hear someone scream when someone pings a cam, be it in English or any of the languages used in SEA... so, theres that.
---
Solid gold!

This dumbfuck. Its a JOKE. So you’re also calling the artist that? Again get friends. Nah from the looks of it you don’t have braincells. Gtfo the internet retard.

Before every game, mute everyone on the opposite team.
---
You won't see their message or their toxicity.
---
Lmao too bad it didn’t happen poolside at La Perla Blanca in coastline (with the dance music playing) or in the karaoke room at Skyscraper.
---
dear god.
---
If both of you only play ranked together, then you started the season at different MMR.  This season rather than having a hard reset where everyone started at 2500, there was a soft reset to midway between your season ending MMR and 2500.
---
Teach me how to Dougie
---
Yeah there's always that one guy on the team.

\*CLAP CLAP CLAP\* OOOOOOOOOOOHH THAT IS AWESOME DUUUUUDE

My friends are playing rn and I told them to leave as soon as they said no running or leaning but they didn't listen.

They just made one of them rage quit as I wrote this so the trash talkers are sore losers and can't even win with these custom settings. 
---
I still wouldve have left way earlier regardless.
---
my only black ices are for MP5k, F2 and FMG9
---
Good job man. I remember my first ace. It was with BUCK THE DUCK!
---
Unfortunately
---
Well his lmg canr som down sights
---
Everyone saying mute them has definitely not experienced these chat spam people. Even with them muted and chat turned off it will still lag your game just as much as it does with chat on.
---
Hey I'm not the retard who hates woman. The artist may not have intended it to be posted by incels but that's what happened you woman hating prick. Gtfo you fucking mayo
---
Happening to everyone it seems
---
I envy you
---
Yes but also no. I just want one for the lulz but I also can’t bring myself to actually throw all my placements and ruin my stats more than I already do by organically losing.
---
That’s right kids for only 1500 v bucks you can get the same dance too!!
---
havent gotten a purple or higher since para bellum, smh
---
well at least it wasnt a ugly-ass Spas-12 skin
---
I got only loadouts reseted it might be because of show down
---
L8 gang
---
This seems to be a new feature ubi has added

How does the red dot sight look so small? I swear it’s way bigger than that when I play
---
of course it is man...
---
lol
---
I think usp-s or socom mk24 would be much more tolerable because the weight of those guns plus the silencer on the barrel makes the gun steady when pulling the trigger as fast as you can
---
It didn’t work.  Muting had no effect
---
Mate. Ubisoft can’t even detect a bloody teleport across/through a map

That would be awesome, just the irony in that

I gonna hive you a tip keep your drone in the prep and let your teammates search the obj
---
I seem to remember a certain somebody who got banned a while back.   
---
A streamer/youtuber in fact. And it was only through his connection to the community and his popularity that he got unbanned.
---
Although, I suppose MacieJay is just a dirty good-for-nothing cheater now, eh?
---
I have the mid-length ones.  I don't think there's a huge competitive advantage, but they feel so much better.  They are how the sticks should have been to start with--a bit longer, larger pads, softer rubber (more comfortable, more grip).
---
Oof

Ahhh poor indie dev team ubi, of course

His leg can aim people just don’t

( got vote kicked for that, but it didnt even glow. How was i supposed to know??)

His leg?

U just have to restart, theres literally been thousands of threads saying this. Play 3v3 AFTER you get done playing 5v5

Why don't you make an extra PSN account and just play the downloaded siege game from it?
---
Most probably yes.
---
woah... those teeth need some work
---
Bust down thotiana
---
When u r attacking it‘s half through the tunnel on the right side. Directly at the stairs :)
---
Would so buy this
---
SuperDuperRusian is tachanka main so his words doesn't count
---
The reason I always run claymores.
---
Congrats dude nice ace
---
I thought they fixed this with the patch?
---
how has this not happened to me
---
Why must you do this to me. I never knew this set existed, but now i want it
---
A few days ago I put my turret in secure area and they all came from the same side cause they had no hardbreacher - nice and easy ace:)
---
Do a little dance!
---
Copper xddd
---
And also just play other ops you aren’t guaranteed that op everytime
---
is it a mod or how does reinforcements and stuff work?
---
Coppers = Luck
---
Get dunked on my guy Im just better
---
teach me how to dougie
---
you can get java on xbox???
---
I knew mira was a man!
---
Ranked is based off of mmr, not "skill" it seems that you think you're better than the rank you should be at. If you truly are the better player, youd be a higher rank, no matter your teammates. I knew a guy who only played solo got diamond, back when it took 6000 points to get to it. Try not having such a big ego.
---
If your mouse has software , make a macro that your mouse wheel up does the macro . Set the macro to like z or something, then in game set reload to z.
---
Yeah, you have to shoot the feet to kill her.
---
being dossed is fun huh?
---
They should have made his elite skin Karen from spongebob
---
New Kaplan looks op
---
Bad
---
He lost
---
:D
---
if my knife had the range that other people's knives have ):
---
I mean i have ps4 so i think it's okay
---
If it wasn’t ranked you should have AltF4’d right when you were about to win. The ultimate karma for your team.
---
Hey man could you do Valkyrie please?
---
Her map is border
---
First time for me.....still managed 4 kills before the entire thing crashed.
---
Nope, a lot of people have this problem. Restarting the game should fix it though.
---
Nah , shes just british
---
Low i have tried 30000 ca
---
don’t worry about your rank. Remember is just a number and i personally perform better when I’m playing to have fun and not to rank up. Rank doesn’t really mean anything until you get to the mid-high plats and diamonds
---
Attackers: "Where's my drones?
---
Kerchow
---
It's almost like this community has different opinions
---
Im just imagining this being top for a while and then some Warden cosplayers doing this exact dance.
---
casual doesn’t count
---
Perfecly balanced as all things should be
---
Yeah I do play for fun but I get lazy a lot lol
---
Yes you do. Assholes.
---
the common stereotype about castle is, “castle locks defenders in a room and doesn’t let anyone in or out”. so i understand why you’d immediately say, castle is ass. but his him with coordination, and block off specific eras to make the attackers life a pain in the ass, or give the roamers a safe space to relocate
---
Mav. 
---
Nokk relies heavily on Anchors not pressuring entry points. The moment they do, her stealth is greatly diminished. 
---
Mav can change his position quickly and make murder holes to take out Anchors. His breaching capability brings more utilities to your team overall. 
---
Nokk, for an operator whose job is to enter obj and take out anchors, feels inadequate for her purpose with her over reliance on stealth along with lack of damage and range.
---
Why you using a red dot though???
---
Wanna go bowling
---
Thanks love you big time no homo
---
Yea especially in collaboration with mute. I’m glad we agree
---
I hate the headgear with a passion it makes her look like every middle age Latina mom ever, the weapon skin is sick tho
---
Great job lad!
---
Umm? Dude her scorpion is one of the best defender weapons. Absolute headshot machine
---
Put the 4 in C4
---
Me too smh, it wasn’t a pleasant surprise to see that it wasn’t fixed....again
---
Who gave Kapkan a staple gun?!
---
Where do you get this

You’ve unlocked a special Easter egg only accessible for people with McDonalds internet.

Lion shotgun rush is also fun as hell to do.

It doesn't look that nice anyway.

On xbox you can upload to xbox live and go to xboxdvr.com or the xbox app to download.

Or you can upload to onedrive and then open one drive on whatever browser you use and download it from there.

On ps4 you can use a usb to transfer to a pc, or you can upload a hidden video to youtube and post the link here.

This was purchased the season Maestro came out. It still says the pack is available just like when I purchased it so everything seems the same.

I totally recommend it, it’s got a good blend of story and fact which makes it very easy to digest
---
I felt they were more satisfying too
---
I don't lmaooo
---
Guess it's not on Netflix tho
---
Polimer clay
---
😂😂😂 little nit picky but whatever have a good day
---
as you know the highest rank in rainbow is diamond, but recently they changed the color to a pinkish color. so is it still considered diamond, or pink diamond, or purple diamond. i have heard a lot of different answers
---
How the fuck.. I can get multiple grays and suddenly get a purple, which is almost always a weapon charm.
---
29.8 kilograms, 6 degrees Celsius, and blank ph would be my guess. Probably just detailing on the barrel; weight, temperature, acidity.
---
You can get the fire skin by playing the open beta. I remember that. The skin OP is looking at is only given to people who get selected for the closed alpha/beta
---
Restarting the game fixes it for me
---
Oh evasions, pussy out then if you want so much
---
kaid is pretty underwhelming but he is the only op who can zap hatches so there is one good thing
---
mozzie would be a little too strong if he could pick up his drones because that would give him too much intel power. plus, he could just hold all of them to prevent them from being destroyed. he can't pick them up for a reason, because it would make his drones almost untouchable. he is balanced as he is and needs no changes
---
warden is str8 garbage in most cases because he has very little to offer, he really needs a lot of changes
---
Impractical Jokers on True TV if anyone wanted to know. They are 3 friends that challenge each other to different tasks, and in this one they had to pitch ideas and get votes for it.
---
Sorry it's not very rare, you can buy it for renown. I believe it's the cheapest blue skin in the game, even under 1000 renown
---
House. We need builders for more maps though
---
I think people mean it isnt manageable when people are not in point blank tbh
---
Witnessed
---
Y don’t u cook ur grenades and also y iron sights?
---
They really should change Kapkan’s melee attack from him knifing to him whipping out his screwdriver and drilling people.
---
Peek me daddy
---
Trying that right now. Hopefully it works since I just fixed up sledge😭
---
Ohhhh i see it now, but isnt the roof of house brown?
---
i don't 🕴
---
Damn, that’s really impressive! How long did it take you to make it?
---
"Hey Fuze you-" "That's THE Fuze to you blyat."
---
Had the same thought. Honestly makes so much sense, wish ubi would do it, even if the drop rate was way lower.
---
It’s the numbers Mason
---
It was over days, but a long time, for sure. The textures probably took a few hours, and we're always working on making more things and features!
---
I think it still keeps your match making rating (mmr) which is tracked in casual and ranked so if you are playing at a gold or plat level your probably playing gold or plat casual
---
Because it is in the beta alpha early access test server that mega VIP ultra max ello people can access.
---
purple is diamond, i think the pink is for like the top 500 players on each platform, kinda like overwatch
---
I'm p sure its white. Are you thinking of Oregon?
---
I'm almost there, I got the headgear and vector skin the last time I opened a set of 25 packs. I didn't even realize there was a uniform to go with it, I've seen it before but I always assumed it came from some bundle
---
ohhh okay
---
Na, just name it Sal.
---
me and the boys reposting dead memes
---
Bro I couldn’t even use the name KrazyAces160. Literally all of my friends have have Krazy in their name and I can’t do it... it’s weird and yes before anyone says it’s been WAY over 30 days since I’ve changed my name
---
Yep same thing for me I reset my game and it was fixed
---
ohh you mean the actual color, I think it's purple
---
Good job man.
---
yeah and okay
---
The spin chance percentage increases you get from showdown are lower than casual anyways.
---
No it’s the dev skin
---
I have, but it then goes to reinstall the entire game even if existing files are detected by steam
---
That’s really incredible, I wish you luck on that
---
right, so i had the ["Todd Howard - It Just Works"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN0qhSyWy8) playing in the background and it fits perfectly.
---
Thanks for the help guys, you were right a simple reset fixed it. Sorry for the freak out text, I just didn’t feel like going one by one on everyone!

Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
it's the dev skin, every developer has one. godlynoob and I think kanto have it for whatever reason
---
Cool, I didn't know that! My experience is probably just because everyone in casual doesn't give a shit. I solo queue casual while watching Parks and Recreation, so it's not like I'm playing in sweaty casual, where people go hard.
---
Nah, looking at ceiling is how you tell someone you screwed up and you're sorry, like a dog showing its belly. More effective than t-bagging because that can make you look like a douche.
---
Lol, disgusting? Then the guy accomplished what he set out for,  making your weak ass uncomfortable,  who gives a shit
---
Every console/computer that can possibly play this game has built in software for game recording. Why do ya'll insist on never using it?
---
a barrel
---
I actually have that one
---
I feel like everything just fits perfectly
---
Ok...?
