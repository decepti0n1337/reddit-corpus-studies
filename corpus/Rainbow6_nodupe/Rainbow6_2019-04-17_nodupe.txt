Well fronts welcome mat is based off a bear trap so it would be possible that this would break your leg and chase internal bleeding so an extended bleed out time would be more realistic

People don't choose the AA12 because it makes sense, my friend. They choose it because its volume of fire is impressively high while keeping pellet-to-damage ratio astoundingly small

Yeah, that’s probably the most reasonable outcome.

Agreed

Yup I'm also stuck in the silver bronze loophole because of them

There have been several recent nerfs that honestly seemed to be pro league oriented yet I rarely see them in ranked as issues. But apparently PL events sell enough to be the center of thought.

Can confirm.
---
Prefire makes them scared tho
---
Based on rof and mag size you get 1.3 seconds before the mag goes empty. However in the smg11, a still good and popular gun you get .8 seconds of firing with worse recoil and a longer reload. It is something to get used to though
---
Theres so many ways to capture game clips and you used a kodak funsaver

They have already released multiple quality bundles for Jackal. It's somewhat silly to think that all camo uniforms should be exclusive to Jackal.
---
That's the people's fault, now they can either go into a safe spawn or watch out for the very obvious door traps/peeks. It's good that you learn this stuff imo.

Lost a ranked game because of this
---
Yea that's a big part. It's hard to strat because a strat involves a lot more then just where to reinforce. It's who to play, where to put impact or shotgun holes etc and most of the time unless you're in a 5 stack developing and getting everyone on that strat is gunna be tough. A general concept of "were clearing from admin" is what you could get.

They just need to add in the line "wicked pissah" for Maverick and he'd be perfect.

If you look at lion’s bio, it says that his actions made for safety reasons whilst dealing with an Ebola outbreak put him at odds with doc, who blamed him for the death of several medical personnel including doc’s colleague

If you say so, and like I said, to my knowledge, but reading is hard I guess. Carry on, and no I didn't wear this camo, I wore ACU which was fucking garbage but whatever its not a fucking beauty contest.

Yes, although I am torn as ive started playing a LOT more Maestro and a LOT more Twitch recently lol.

Just small correction, Lion actually got his name from when he was in Sudan protecting an investigative team.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
" his loud voice scared a frightened mob back and he gained the nickname "Lion" from the locals. "
---
Nothing to do with his gadget. Everything else looks good though.
---
I think it's more likely that there'll be a specific operator that can put a device to let you go up hatches than them letting all attackers repel up, but we won't know for a while.

LOBSTER
---
I actually really like favela. Granted it's an attacker's wet dream depending on where defenders are. Breaching walls and hitting targets from rooftops is a pretty cool feeling.
---
Can’t argue with that.
---
On the one hand, I love more realistic looking uniforms. 
---
On the other, Maverick’s bundle here looks...awful. The colors are all wrong, the pattern is unrealistic as hell and too small in scale, and overall he just looks like a brand new GI Joe Action Figure. Just looks weird as hell.
---
I mean, isn’t it just air with chemicals?
---
It was a breath of fresh air since I had never played the map before but it got old really quick once I realized how messed up this map is.
---
There’s clearly a backstop and nearly all of the bullets are hitting the ground in front of him.  He’s probably out in the country where there’s room for gun memes.
---
i had a similar thing where i placed a breaching charge on the wall right outside of the door in connector of drum and outside of the Offices OBJ, walked completely around the corner (i couldn't even see the door anymore) and when i blew it up it killed me
---
Okay
---
A rework wouldn't hurt.

Flex much?
---
It stays
---
Works on ps
---
His flash is so buggy and shitty that half the time it doesn't do shit anyways. Blitz is now a terrible operator to be playing even in casual.
---
Taxic.
---
after all the shit I see daily, I do not believe you have not done something incredibly drastic to DESERVE this ban. Trust me on this one.
---
Blitz is nerfed into the ground now. He already was rarely played at all even in casual and now he'll never get his flash bug fixed since nobody will be playing him to complain.
---
I've never seen the one with the hat. I love that

Ah. Good old times. You exchange 3 teammates for killing one Blackbird? Oh boy, we really have chances to win this round now!

What are you talking about, his shotgun has almost no recoil now after they reversed the PC/Console differences for it.

I spent money on the orange one for gridlock only to have it taken the next day
---
When Glaz zoomed in his hitbox increased which is what triggered the trap.
---
There’s a glitch on the map where particles and apparently some projectiles will be teleported to that spot on the map. If you look at that spot during the droning phase you can see drone destruction particles. Ubi needs to fix it tbh.

Hey, Mr. Quasi-Siege Pro. I'm pretty damn sure you're really underestimating recoil and how it is controlled on console.  And I'm not sure why you're implying I'm retarded for not being able to control Console recoil when it is undebatebly harder to control than on PC.
---
You're probably nowhere near as good at recoil control on Console as you make yourself out to be.
---
Also pretty damn sure, once more, that recoil patterns are identical on both PC and Console.
---
Okay, thats...that’s a day to soon
---
whoA THAT'S A JUMP THERE BUDDY
---
The 2 second cooldown was too short, you could just go around and flash everyone. 7 seconds is a reasonable cooldown time

I tried to do R3 on the outside but it was messing up my aiming when I would lean. Just personal preference but maybe I’ll toy with it again since I’m more comfortable with the controller now. At first it was overwhelming since it was my first elite type controller.
---
idk if you are just bad at controlling recoil but i have no problem using buck acog its a laser for real. no horizontal recoil at all just vertical
---
Looks like a casual match for me, just git gud
---
Having same issue, any solution for this?
---
But it was different during the event with walls having solid supports, it was literally my favorite map, but a NEW version of it! I played that shit way more than a straight man should have.

No edition comes with base operators now.

I’d say Maverick is the safer bet all around. If not, Mozzie.
---
Ah, didn’t know that. My bad.
---
From a bad player with all the dudes unlocked:
---
Mozzie's guns feel super underpowered to me personally, I'm not good at head shots. But he is like a more sneaky version of valkyrie. Maverick is great all around, but be prepared for people to shove their gun through the hole you're opening and spray your forehead. Gridlock I like alot, holding down hallways is amazing. Throwing a trax mine out in obj to watch for where people are shooting them away from is great. But good Lord you are HUGE! Good luck going unnoticed.

They were like that at beta and I think when the game first launched.

This was beautiful, tbh.
---
Hello there , my gf
---
That's really interesting. I don't think weapons are part of hitbox in terms of bullets though, is it? Someone needs to test this.
---
I guess Thanos snapped twice to wipe out gridlock
---
People were still getting angry and downvoting the shit out of anyone who was saying that Gridlock was the attacker and Mozzie the defender even after the official reveal. People get so stuck up on these leaks thinking they're 100% accurate.
---
Gotta love the kickvote on the bandit
---
i play 5 hours of casual nothing happened, i enter a ranked match and we almost winning,  the internet fucks up and i lose elo and get a sanction

I mean, to be fair, the Twitch let her drone get taken . . . so it's kinda her fault.

Will talk to my girlfriend to test this lol

---
I'm curious, what nerfs are you talking about?
---
&gt; Just re-watched it, again, she peeks in the killcam for way longer than you see her for on his screen
---
Which part of "the killcams aren't accurate" isn't making sense to you?
---
It was literally the start of the match, prep phase. Its not random afking, i just wasn't moving immediately as the round staryed and boom, dead. Not to mention its casual and im on defense. So like wtf? Even if i was randomly afk, where's the need to teamkill? And if its end of round afk, there's still vote to kick.
---
Like I said, it's not justified.
---
Nææk
---
And im saying i wasnt randomly afk. I know not to afk, because there's no point in playing/id just quit at those points.
---
Thought so  øøk sounded weird
---
Where is she from?
---
Next time you’re tk’ed for going afk you should remember this post. Everyone has things outside of r6 dumbass
---
Like I said nothing to do with the killcam, so what you mean to say is the twitch wernt peeking for that long and didn’t shoot where she shot it’s just the killcam
---
&gt; And im saying i wasnt randomly afk
---
Very much were though
---
Lol, the only I see that’s retarded here is you
---
Adding a name to the vote kick system would just increase the number of TKs after failed votes so no it's a bad idea.
---
All I want is be able to shoot the rope that attackers rappel with and cut it
---
&gt; Like I said nothing to do with the killcam
---
Given as you're looking at the killcam and pointing out discrepancies it kinda has a lot to do with the killcam.
---
&gt;so what you mean to say is the twitch wernt peeking for that long and didn’t shoot where she shot it’s just the killcam
---
I'm saying what you see happening in the killcam is not what actually happened and as such you shouldn't be using it as a basis for anything.
---
Do you understand what the phrase "it's not justified" means?
---
It can be carry based, but it’s 90% of the time a very teambased game
---
 Left alt looks like a swatzika
---
Very much wasnt. Start of game, start of round, not even 10 seconds isnt "randomly afk"
---
Ubisoft said in the latest patch notes the issue is being looked into as a bug
---
That's precisely what it is
---
I mean it's quite obvious that he escaped from North Korea with half(or more i don't remember) of his family dying along the way.
---
The killcams not what bothers me, it’s the fact he would’ve killed twitch if when she peeked her head actually came around the corners he’s peeking for like 2 second and he only sees her for like a millisecond
---
Monty but with spikes and no gun. I like it!
---
Guess it's personal opinion at the end of the day
---
READ BEFORE COMMENTING: I believe that siege has hammered him , and I don’t say he should go back to before I’m just saying we could at least be told who it is like when can interrogates. I saw a ping upstairs and went after it expecting a cav not expecting a maestro to gun down me and 2 teammates
---
&gt; The killcams not what bothers me
---
Then stop referring to it.
---
&gt;it’s the fact he would’ve killed twitch if when she peeked her head actually came around the corners he’s peeking for like 2 second and he only sees her for like a millisecond
---
Most of the model comes round the corner before the op dies...
---
Millisecond is nonsense.
---
I like playing her because it's a nice break away from my teammates, and I get to spend some quality 1 on 1 time with an enemy.
---
P90 has an acog its just worse.
---
Start a gofundme page and mass produce that.
---
I want it soo bad
---
&gt; How is it “objectively slower”
---
Toggle, takes two clicks to go in and out. Hold takes one.
---
That's objectively slower.
---
&gt;when free aim/ads are at exactly the same speed?
---
What the fuck does that have to do with anything? And they're not necessarily the same sens.
---
&gt;If you can’t aim with toggle, just use hold
---
And the non sequitur..
---
No relativity?
---
No but they do say a lot about your faculties.
---
More like r/engrish
---
Did you get it yet?
---
More renown only because the matches last longer.
---
My first ranked game ever, I got spawnpeeked by a tachanka on his mounted mg. Since then I have not been spawnpeeked since thanks to my compulsive checks of every window and doorway.
---
But...they don't?
---
No that's just vr chat
---
I like it too, looks similar to the Army BDUs my dad wore in the late 80s. I also like the SEAL Sandroot uniforms, since they're based off of the DCU uniform of '92 to '04
---
This and the Fallen Captain doing this dance is the best thing in the world!
---
Your telling me you see the twitch’s head peek
---
WELL MAYBE THE ENEMY TEAM WONT USE MUTE,
---

If so then your just lying plain and simple😂

How Would it be an hindrance to defence? You put this up or down for roamers to get back to site or near site without having to go through dangerous hallways that are being held by attackers, it is a two sided blade but so are gadgets like mira Windows.

The game of it keeps up in its current state is not going to last that long. It's technically already starting its decline this year again since the player numbers for average players a week is now back below csgo. And ive seen a lot more people up and open about how shitty the game is recently and that they're fed up with it so it probably won't last as long as ubi would hope to milk our money out of this. Also by year 9 Ela probably still will never have recieved a buff and will be the worst defender like she already pretty much is.

They literally can't make it track kills without creating major toxicity issues. Trust me I know how it feels to carry a team 10+ kills but you got to think about the thatcher who allowed you to get into the point or the hibana getting the hatches. This is a team oriented game. The ranking system could be improved yes but at the time it is in a very good and healthy state. Lower elo loss for 4v5's is something I agree they can do. But Higher elo gain depending on kills? Hell no.

Ok have you thought about getting better accuracy if you're losing "every" time to glaz?

Problem with the situations is that the first one limits you to recruit and you only get a few (like 1 or 2 I think) operators to play with specifically for Classic Hereford. I almost exclusively play Caveria and Capitao, so I am not able to practice using those guns and abilities specialised for those exact operators on Classic Hereford. I instead just have to play House, which is fine, but I would love it if I was able to practice on a map I enjoy.

Ela in my eyes is one of the worst defenders in the game in her state, i don't know if you think that as well. But compared to every other roamer Ela is far from great.  Just every other character and even vigil brings more in either weapons, gadget or a little bit of both. I wasnt saying impacts were a bad idea to add back but they wouldn't do much to help her anyways. Her gun is too weak in damage and no the fire rate does not balance that out when you can't hit anything because of its horizontal recoil. Like its basically shot like Ela is 6 years old and she shoots it without a stock as well. Mira's gun is basically the scorpion just better in every way. Somewhat better damage than 22 on the scorpion and for me even on consoles is basically a laseofr. But Ela yes having slightly better vertical recoil due to the vertical recoil buff to every weapon in the game and not just to Ela like ppl here are saying. But the horizontal recoil is the thing, well a major thing that is really bringing Ela down. Ubi still doesn't seem to understand how balancing works or even how to go off the operator charts they have so I really doubt Ela will ever get her well needed buff anytime soon. I'm surprised she hasn't yet because all they listen to are the pro league fags and baised youtubers like Zen for any kind of feedback and none of them seem to like Ela so I'm surprised she hasn't been buffed really.

I personally don't use Mav but you could use the silencer on your guns. If you can manage to make a hole in a wall and shoot with the silencer attached to it, they won't know where the shots are coming from. Its an advantage you can have on the defenders.
---
Since making a hole with the torch is very quiet anyway, they won't hear you coming.

Exactly, mix them with some milk and therefore you got the most manly meal in existence

---
If you use blackbeard's dmr get Dokkaebi or Glaz
---
If you use his AR, try the M249 Cap or Gridlock.
---
Maining an op like blackbeard means your next op should be based on the guns you like to use, since you didn't have a team gadget anyway.
---
You should be thankful it was glaz

Yeah I turned my xbox off and on and I’ve received the update now

I have considered exporting it into the Unity3D game engine, cause my game prototypes for first person shooters use a single green rectangle for the map. Having a real map such as this would be a massive improvement, and i'm going to try to program a siege style destruction mechanism for it, if i do export it when finished. Thanks for the nice words
---
It was obviously a ricochet /s

Ok. I didn’t know the ACOG was still available for the G3. I just use the R4-C with a reflex now

I feel like there should be a new games mode 10v10 ops kinda like ground war?
---
Its Trash.   
---
1. Does not account for player performance.
---
2. Only counts win/loss
---
3. Ranking seems to be totally random at the start of a season
---
4. given they strive for a 50/50 win/loss ratio the win/loss counting seems stupid
---
5. Rating lost/gained is seemingly random
---
6. Difference between Bronze, silver and gold is just non existent Same for Plat/diamond.
---
7. Easily exploited through bringing low rank friends
---
8. Easily exploited through feeding and tanking your rating for easier games
---
Overall its just terrible.
---
16:9. Anybody who plays stretched are cheapos
---
I have it on bucks CAMRS and ihave adapted to use that instead of the AR
---
Kapkan lost his knife (dink’s stile it)
---
Im thinking the operator won’t be able to move while the ability is active or it will cancel it.  Or maybe when it’s active they can’t shoot or it will cancel similar to Vigil.
---
Since nobody’s pointed it out yet, she looks a lot like Olivia Munn
---
Even then, he'll just have to sit behind a Mira and pop it when the smoke goes off.
---
Maybe true, considering Glaz can no longer see through smokes without standing still

Frost came wayyyy before zof
---
I mean it'd still be super busted. Just sit behind a mira and pop it when the smoke goes off.
---
Frost is much older so she has acquired more skins over time.
---
Well then obviously the current setup provides an advantage over yours, since you can accurately shoot the gadget you spot upto 20m, which works perfectly well for valky came, making it quick and accurate. As you know, hipfire in siege is nonsense, so having accuracy when locsting a gadget is definitely better than spotting one, then aiming to shoot it. Last thing you want is ADS time to be an unnecessary factor.
---
Yeah but still, I feel like she is so underappreciated
---
They weren’t asking they were telling...
---
That would be absolute chaos but probably really fun
---
Have you seen Kaids pickrate and winrate? It’s a different op. Just because he also has some form of electricity doesn’t mean that it’s the same character. Twitch = thatcher, ash = zofia etc. not really true but that’s a topic for completely different conversation. 
---
If jaeger is this popular and strong imagine what would happen if people could pick 2 jaegers. That would mean absolutely no grenades for attacking team. I would play 2 jeagers if u could. Wouldn’t you?
---
If you go to their profile it says what their previous name was
---
His pickrate is high because he is the only operator that can stop smokes, grenades, etc. 
---
If Thermite was the only hard breacher, his pick rate and win delta would be insane.
---
Once another operator with the same role is released, a nerf could be considered as to equalise the pick rates.
---
What is it?
---
The ar33 is good. It's worse at everything compared to the l8, but it has that angled grip and that angled grip is all that matters for the best tactics in the game. BTW the best tactics is suicide rushing, always works.

^This. The reason Jager has such a high pick rate is because his gadget is the only one of its kind. Yea of course his gun is great but he did lose his acog. I believe if ubi makes another operator with a similar gadget role, and his primary isn't completely trash, Jager's pick rate won't be as high.

And to repeat what I and MANY others have told you, 90% of the time he is doing it for banter with his siege mates. Taking jokes so seriously isn’t fun, and clearly you aren’t either.

It's ubisoft i doubt they'll every give another dsmn about Ela. She'll probably even be the last operator to get a elite even. They've just driven her into the ground. Her weapons are just so underwhelming.  Yes the shotgun can be very effective but you just don't have the range you would have with say Vigil. Maybe ubi just doesn't want her scorpion to be as good which in my eyes it really was just average anyways to happen again. Yet it all could've been prevented if they just properly tested operators and just updated in general. Maybe bringing the tts to consoles would be nice and a lot more beneficial since ps4 does have the largest amount of players anyways. But knowing ubi theyd never do that.
---
The vote was initiated right after someone else tk'd, maybe they hit the wrong name.
---
Someone’s angry
---
You should clarify that you aren't suggesting to replace her sensor with an actual heartbeat sensor like mw2.
---
On the Steam Community market, the only thing you can purchase is cards. That's literally all that's on there. If you somehow sold a skin, it was against terms of service probably.
---
Jagers gun may have “insane DPS” how ever that is only at point blank range. The damage drop if for his weapon is insane.  Reducing his ADS to 1 would render him useless. Each grenade carrying  OP has two grenades. Not to mention his gadget can be killed so easily. I think youre confusing OP and extremely useful. 
---
I guarantee that if another OP is introduced that can do what Jager can do, his pick rate will drop by a substantial amount
---

---
*cough* “Operation Health” *cough*
---
i honestly don’t understand why he’s still a three speed. he definitely isn’t designed to be a roaming operator based on his gadget and ubi has gotten much more reserved in handing out 3 speeds because they know how much of an advantage it given them. I think the only reason he’s still a three speed is because the jager mains would get super pissed

Nearly everyone, including pro-league players think Lion is OP in his current state. He definitely needs a nerf, you just haven't seen him used in high level play. He is also currently banned in pro-league entirely.

Of course. ADS stands for Aiming Down Sights, and is effectively the same as scoping. ADS Time is the time it takes from the moment you start holding RMB (Right Mouse Button) till your weapon is fully scoped in. L85 takes an insane amount of time to ADS, together with the M249, IQ's LMG, and stuff like that. Pistols have very short ADS Time, then come SMGS, Shotguns, Rifles, LMGs (roughly)
---
Thanks! I grabbed mine first thing this morning. When I read your post. My buddy has yet to grab his tho so I'll let him know to keep trying... maybe layer tonight. I just went in again and it's not working for me still
---
I understand that they are trying to fix the stuff but the problem with that is that they try to fix the problems now and then a new season comes out and oh no more problems and they just pile up. There is no way to make this game perfect. I understand that very well and I do know that they are working on it. From what I can tell, the mid season patch did seem to help but there are still so many things. I know that you think having another operation health would anger the community but I honestly think they would be relieved. From all of the subreddits and discussions I’ve been a part of, I have seen the frustration other players have with the game. I used to only play siege with my friends and  I currently have 1600 hours in the game. Now, I play it but maybe 2 to 3 games and that’s it. Me and my friends have gotten fed up with the game and how broken it is. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not the best player. Even with 1600 hours I’m still not the best. But this game thinks that with me being a gold level player that it’s ok to que me against plats and diamonds when my entire team is silver. I just don’t get how this is supposed to work. It’s just not fair in my opinion. I honestly think we need a new operation health.

So basically a very strange working device that somehow allows the gadget to still work, but be able to work inside the device? Good concept, but probably wouldn’t work with Jager and Alibi. It would also increase the pick rate for Thatcher even more, which is ok I guess.
---
I understood
---
Mate I see no reason to have Tachanka on a team, but with clash, I have a moving Mira window. That, I can use. But a turret that can just be grenaded or fire bolted, that's useless to me.
---
Nigge....

Why are like this
---
Hitlers killer is my hero

People complaining are below silver
---
Hitler is my hero

You thought it was a good joke but it was me dio
---
How would you do that in order to lean you’d be taking your index finger off the trigger
---
This image is literally found in google images when you put in Siege memes.
---
R/woooosh
---
I think the more skilled people are more confortable with different people because of how unique the play style of how clash is suppose to play. They would rather play someone that can hold their own agaist people. Clash is not good for that especially if they are the last one alive.
---
I forgot lmao
---
Sheesh.
---
Overnight shifts. Gosh those shouldn't exist.
---
i cant find what your taking about
---
People are over exagerating operation health, they overhauled matchmaking, the lighting and a miriad of QoL changes. And all it costed us was a map? Considering how everyone and their mothers has shit to say about every single post launch maps, I'd say it was a pretty good deal. I was actually there prior, during and after the changes and the game got so much better because of this update. People dont know or remember this but matchmaking was trash before, joining parties was a headache, finding a match would take 1m30 to 4m and sometimes it would find a match but kick you out due to an unknown error, or worse stay stuck in an infinite loop. After operation health? 30 seconds or less and you're playing. Thats just one of the many issues the game had back then and only the most patient or motivated players would stick around to play the game. People forget how far this game has come and how much of it is due to that season. We still got the ops and all so really people just like to bitch and moan cause it's what the "cool kids" are doing.
---
No woooosh involved lmao
---
Are you on mobile or desktop
---
You don’t drone?
---
It’s peeking Jesus
---
Lmaoooo
---
Yeah I thought that as well. But the game is straying more and more from “realism” now lol. But I feel like with some tweaking to the idea it could work and really shift how players both attack and defend.
---
Lmao I'm bronze 3 - and tbh I don't care, just play for fun and memes
---
On a gun which has a lower TTK than most defender primaries.
---
People should really stop whining about changes and start adapting
---
I wouldn't use Ash over her, then again, thats my opinion
---
Uh what lol? The recoil is terrible
---
I'm pretty sure EDD and knife are weapons too though
---
Oof
---
Funny thing is my friend is kinda a tachanka main and that was passed down by his friend who was also one.
---
Lots of pl players have said he would be op if he was buffed too much. This game should be balanced around the highest level of play because it is a comletitive game. Ill let you draw your own conclusions.
---
in regards to Dokkaebi do you recommend her cz auto or her SMG?
---
very pripyat
---
I mean
---
They learn that rainbow six community bitches. Alot.
---
Do it again
---
Retarded people that have 1 round of experience with mira,tachanka,etc
---
"MoRe AcOg'S"
---
Everyone else -No. Why should a woman with bulletproof glass windows have an acog when her mini A-10 vector is a headshot machine
---
Maybe, but still, I think realism should still apply, otherwise it would just be very weird. Still a very good idea, most people think about a shield for cams.

Nice
---
It deals 42 damage a hit he only needs to hit them 3 times and both of them were distracted on his teammate
---
***Underrated post***
---
Reeeeee
---
There's a lot of work that goes into it, and i don't use the same engine, so i can't fully explain, but i can do a summary of what could be used to make destruction physics better on low end machines:
---
* Holes are placed into pre-defined wall prefabs which are made to be as simple as possible (No soft walls are curved)
---
* The debris that fall after an explosion are low res and quickly despawn, so only a few are in a level at a time. This is important as creating and destroying objects in slow, so instead they are put into a [pool of objects](https://www.raywenderlich.com/847-object-pooling-in-unity) and are reused, which is faster
---
* Many objects are culled (not displayed) when you cant see them, such as if they are behind a wall, which massively saves rendering time
---
* Depending on your settings, even when not culled, distant objects will be given very simple low-poly objects, which are rendered faster.
---
These things all make destruction physics work well even on low end devices, alongside others that i'm not fit to explain, as i'm not the best game programmer, because i'm only a hobbyist.
---
Is this a troll post?
---
It was still a nice 4K
---
So in your experience you do/don’t think another op health is necessary?
---
Amazing
---
ah, you my good sir have misread sarcasm as literal. (I don't play Ash except for challenges and had a riot with the G36)
---
Unsportsmanlike\*
---
And Pengu also said one shot headshot should be removed which is ridiculous. Just because pl players say/ suggest something doesn't make it free of criticism and discussion.
---
Ash doesn't have any must-use utility holding her back (except on consulate garage). IQ needs to stay alive to search for valk cams and gu mines and losing her gives an advantage to the defender's intel, and losing Maverick on some maps is devastating because it becomes harder to open up reinforced walls.
---
Ash can run in, open a wall, and blow off some heads. She can die early and the team isn't losing anything critical - and trading Ash for a Lesion or Maestro is always worth it.
---
I like her cz, better damage and easier recoil (I'm not so great at headshots). I have it suppressed too
---
Far? It has one of the best damage outputs and a slower but controlled fire rate.
---
But like I said, “arguably.”
---
Ash’s Gadget is essentially a grenade launcher. She’s more viable as an aggro threat.
---
That’s why you pick her over IQ.
---
It just... happens
---
Sounds like you need to work on recoil control, G36C’s recoil isn’t bad at all
---
Forgive me Lord for I have sinned.
---
Nice. I always hate peeking from that door simply because if that railing.
---
The G36 is highly underrated in Siege
---
Lord Chanka is a loving god
---
First 2 minutes is just t-bagging staring at the ceiling, great quality.
---
The R4C is the best. Compared to it, it is terrible. Why do you project that somehow I can't control recoil lol
---
That false God who took away my German acog? Nah. I pray to Capitão, the God of Fire.
---
This reminds me of one time when I was playing with some guys and we were defending. I randomly decided to call out a headshot by shooting thru the window, and I'll be damned if I didn't get a random head shot. I literally almost threw my controller and ran out of my house I couldn't believe it
---
Such a fun gun, if it didnt have to compete with the RC4 it would be viewed so much better by everyone I think.
---
His rework is coming soon (not soon enough I know) and it's essentially a nerf. To me Lion should've never been introduced to this game, same as blackbeard. Someone at ubi loves developing OP ops.
---
Because the r4c’s recoil is some of the highest in the game?
---
I mean the wall hacks were pretty outrageous. I really like lion but I felt bad bringing him out since it was kinda sad to make defenders choose either stand still and die or move and die. I think you're right in that people overall didnt understand how to use him to full potential by themselves, but as you said, with certain ops it was just broken. I think his change (I've been playing him a bunch today) is not exactly a nerf really, more like Cavs change. Obviously he doesnt have the outlines, but the pings are actually very strong if you know how to time them and help communicate with your team. And hes back to 3 charges so you can really gather a lot of Intel from them. I think he is less of a roamer hunter now and a more solidified plant/push support op. I think defenders will underestimate him for the next few weeks and I wouldnt be surprised if his pick rate went slightly down but his win delta increased. I think he may actually be nerfed again and I would imagine it would be either losing a charge again, being knock to 1 speed, or my personal favorite that would be the best option, make it so only he can see pings, making him less annoying for defenders by losing some globalness, but still strong but reliant on communication.
---
Shit happens to me all the time 😂
---
Then why is itin Heathrow, London?
---
So glad he did it with smoke everyone knows furries come back unless you use gas
---
the new one eyed god of expanding fire; may he hear our prayers
---
Yeah I usually go play LEGO Marvels or sumthin like that to calm me down
---
What about the summer of '69
---
I don't think that is good idea.
---
Reason 1: You can't drone.
---
Reason 2: The controls could be harder to learn for new players
---
I do believe if Xbox/PlayStation starts making all controllers with pedals it is possible
---
But you have to!
---
That’s so clean
---
Haikus aren’t supposed to rhyme anyways
---
Baiting Ash’s have turned into Baiting Twitch’s.
---
Not a wooosh moment, my guy
---
This still happening for you ?
---
This still happening now ?
---
Huh? The r4c has like, no recoil...
---
the audio is lagy
---
If I’m playing that window and get got like this, I’m going to hate you forever.
---
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
---
That’s still way to op he he is supposed to block one taps and do some corner peaks doing that would just make him a god again on a smaller scale
---
That explains alot
---
Because if he did get an ACOG it would actually be the Russian ACOG and then people would lose their shit
---
In his current state, he is not OP, but he is fundamentally broken by the nature of the game.  I also agree that he is not the only operator that doesn’t belong in this game.
---
Does nobody remember the recoil on that thing when it had an acog when you weren’t tapping?
---
That’s just The Siege community nowadays I guess
---
I always used her red dot sight lol
---
Yeah, I forgot about the knife when posting ( Happy cake day!)
---
Honestly, I already preferred the reflex on ash
---
Point and click adventure
---
Was the "roses are red" poem written as a haiku? I don't think so.
---
We won
---
:^)
---
I'll never understand the logic of "We have 4 guys stacked up and one stranger so we're going to TK him."  
---
Why not just....let him play?  If he sucks, it doesn't matter since you were going to TK him anyways.  If he's good, then you gain a good player.  It's win-win to NOT TK the person.  
---
If you're playing Casual, the beauty is that you can just leave for another game.  If I join a map to where I'm immediately getting vote-kicked or TK'd, I simply leave because I don't want to be there any more than the dipshits on my team want me there.
---
PMM snuck into my room
---
Restart your game
---
Well then wth is the "bug" team doing
---
"Here's Johnny!"
---
that's barbed wire lagging through the gun
---
What is so broken about him?
---
Fixing other parts of the game.
---
I like the F2 for maximum click speed.
---
It might be low effort, but I appreciate when posts like these are made. Sure, I can preview each item separately in the shop, but seeing the whole outfit like this outside of promo art matters a great deal to me in deciding whether or not an outfit is worth my money. So thanks for this.
---
That’s what I though thanks to confirm it
---
Lay down.
---
Yo I hear you got enough nitro cells to fill an entire house
---
Thumb controls aim or when I vault
---
No
---
It’s a carbine, big difference. Great in CQC, Poor in Long Distance, it’s like the MPX at range. I’ve hit someone in the leg and arm at a distance and only did like 25 damage
---
Not a true twitch main unless you use the 417
---
He can prevent himself from getting headshotted in a game where headshots ohk.
---
the holo is actually amazing on the F2 i highly recommend it coming from a console player
---
&gt;OP probably means this was the inspiration for the map\\
---
op could have picked any planehijacking and it would serve as inspiration as much as this one. Its just a stretch to link these 2 together
---
How do you get this?
---
He had to have the clown mask to top it off. Reminds me of 2016
---
but... Im a Hibana main. And Frost.
---
Must’ve
---
None taken, it's not all the time, some games I do go 13-4 but more often then not I'm like 2/3-6-5 or something. 
---
It annoys me sure, but, I also know when I have guys on my team going 10-2 I don't have much a chance to get kills at the level we play at, but I'm valuable as a support for Intel and such
---
Mr.Bomber... I on’t feel so good
---
Rainbow6siege did no do a haiku either they did a senryu
---
It's not OP at all.  He's actually an info-gathering support operator now, as opposed to someone who can give you the opportunity to shoot through walls as a penalty to someone moving.  I love it because there's actually some risk/reward to it now.  You see three pings at OBJ you gotta wonder where those other two guys are.  And since they don't have to sit still for 3 seconds, you still have plenty of risk breaching.  
---
It's a very balanced change.  Roamers will adapt to it and beat it, believe me.
---
I've always used Ash with holographic,
---
I honestly hate the acog. R4-c and holo is where it’s at.
---
The second to last one was Blackbeard, right?
---
Mustard
---
But those look like default cams.
---
Ketchup
---
I had never play ash with ACOG and everybody laugh from me... now I'm laughing from them :P
---
I personally startet playing siege at the end of op grim sky and if u keep grinding u will reach high rankes even if u play solo. At least that’s my experience 
---
Otherwise the official discord of r6 is a place where u find many friendly teammates
---
It’s casual...
---
It really does
---
Every time I get in it resets my graphics settings.
---
No it was extremely laggy all day
---
It's the drone. you have two of them. They send shock waves at enemies.
---
New notes, new leaks, artistic renditions, latest bugs, etc etc. but the clutch pandemic is too damn big.
---
I like how this is way down in the subreddit yet art and stupid memes are on the top. Like shouldn't game related patches be pinned at the top to inform the subreddit?
---
LOL at people thinking ash is bad.
---
her win rate INCREASED since she lost acog and her pick rate wasnt even affected.
---
more nerfs needed.
---
It does look extremely awesome!
---
&gt;It is based on this story because it is the most famous plane hijacking where special forces could fight against.
---
maybe in france.  In germany operation [Feuerzauber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_Flight_181) is way more know considering it was the first GSG9 mission
---
throw = intentionally lose
---
this game in no capacity deserved to be full retail since its almost exclusively multiplayer only. But yeah I like the characters in this game as well, honestly I would like to see something like situations but expanded and one maybe 20-30m mini campaign for each OP. But nope, esports gotta esport.

Reinstall is always a good first step.

Ohh gotcha lol😄. I was like I cant find that operator! Whos yokai? Am I supposed to have a partner? What makes yokai so special?? Lol too funny
---
Even if it is for the greater good, that’s gotta fucking suck receiving this message that you lost elo. Especially if you didn’t even know.
---
Taking off a scope doesn’t make the fun balanced. The R4 is still mathematically and fundamentally better by a massive margin. Add the fact the majority of kills are within 10 meters and you see it makes little difference.

you're lucky Jackal didn't blow your head off

I've heard this is the reason that capitao got the new gridlock acog.

I’m not sure, i normally just send it to a friend and save using the PS messages app, then upload,

Maybe a bad connection?

Yup

Yeah...

It’s been like that for a while. I learned about it pretty easy from watching serenity get so many aces and clutches because of it.

Maybe...I don't know...ADS? Or even, sounds crazy, use your smg?
---
Maybe better aim?
---
Tight angles are too, you see nothing from the inside but the attackers can see you perfectly
---
Let’s all agree that the future nerf to Maestro is too much
---
Rather have Jager and Bandit get their acogs back.

---
My guess is the server glitched out, and thought the 3d model was holding an impact grenade. And the server dropped it when you got the kill. Just a annoying glitch
---
Casual has never made sense to me honestly. Needs a reboot.
---
or just...aim better?
---
Wow, rollercoaster of emotions!!
---
"Goooooood evening"
---
Disagree to be honest, I think IQ is in a good spot.
---
Coconutbrah’s videos are good, but a lot of those are very situational, or only used for sound, etc...definitely worth a watch though.
---
But some general tips are:
---
Put them watching the areas around sites, especially on walls that have been reinforced.
---
You don’t always need/want on on the site, as it will only be useful for a retake of site.
---
Bomb is one of the few modes where a cam on site can be useful as there is two sites to watch. Using your Deagle to open a soft wall between sites is a good place to put them, so it watches both sites.
---
Sticking them low to the ground, like on the underside of a table can make them hard to spot.
---
Opening a window in prep phase, throwing a cam outside the second the round starts, then boarding back up. Can give you great view of common rappelling areas or exterior walls to site, like many of the garage sites. And can be used for run outs and C4 kills on them.
---
Haha I know right
---
Oh, yeah definitely but I just meant now having a bigger player base and the desire to be the "coolest" or whatever, all feeds into the lack of care for OBJ while the selfish gameplay style has been more common.
---
i hope this is doable on console, but knowing these spots, it probably isn't
---
IQ is one of the only operators in the game that is perfectly balanced at the moment. Just leave her where she is.
---
I'm about 50/50 on reflex and holo. Some guns I just do better with one than the other. Reflex on Jager, holo on Ash, reflex on Twitch, holo on Mute. It's a weird circumstance.
---
You know it boy
---
Ads and predict where its going.
---
Fair enough
---
Are you lost sir?
---
Be easier to drone and buck above or go top floor and shoot down for safety I think, you save a nade which can be used elsewhere, but still it's a neat trick and good knowledge
