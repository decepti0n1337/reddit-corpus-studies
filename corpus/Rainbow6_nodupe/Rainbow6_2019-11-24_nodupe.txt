So does that mean that like Blackbeard I can survive a shot to the face?

No?

Consistency Uni, consistency!

Not quite yet. It's only a stand, after all.

Recruit rush is always the solution to any problems

God damn Ubisoft

It would probably take the drywall with it lol

Spawnpeeking lol

I knew I wasn't the only one to think siege should have a Mall as a map

Yeah, this needs to be the tachanka rework

that gun has infinite recoil

cool

Never realized Gridlock's hands look fucking disgusting.

Is it the Girls Frontline one?

---
Yo I love Diablo 3
---
Not bad idea but i think that Mantis special weapon could be doing more then only a litte damage maybe poisoning or so?
---
Would smash ngl
---
dont give them ideas, this also very nice
---
Looks like a shake weight
---
Well, finally a sniper worth actually using, maybe.
---
Honestly it wouldn't make him broken. Without an acog who won't be prime spawn peek material even with one extra headshot tanking. But he would be an excellent angle holder and anchor.
---
Well tie me up with yarn and beat me to death with a fern!
---
I need you to understand that I highly support and advocate this.
---
It was casual and ur bad
---
Good point. Didn't notice that until scrolling through IG and finding a free weekend Siege ad.
---
2 and a half years ago
---
I think it could change the game with the new ops and can really interest me in the game again,especially competitive.I‚Äôm a long time player who‚Äôs recently fallen to the causal side of siege but still love the game lately I haven‚Äôt played the game near as much.i hope this new operation will hook me back into the game and bring the love back that I had.
---
call me harry
---
Not saying you did. Just explaining why I think they changed it.
---
God those iron sights what the fuck man you masochistic madman 
---
Good clip tho
---
Sure is.
---
They seem strong over powered isn‚Äôt the word of quite use,but hey we will see once there in the game,also I do rate your opinion like wise
---
This has been happening since he came out, not exactly a new revelation.
---
Only drawback for this weapon is the mag Size, otherwise its perfect
---
this is a cam spot I have been using for valk for a long time and wasn't sure if anyone else wanted to try it.
---
tossing the cams out of the yellow skylight from the top pillar you can angle it to be on top of the van outside without breaking a window and if angled better can get inside the car itself to  be hidden. 
---
spot overlooks the garage door and can be used to help bandit tricking or spotting the attackers if garage was compromised.
---
this is awesome and all but I just want to remind people not to support rogue
---
lot of t-hunt
---
Practice, thunt, playing against better players, improving call outs. What do u play on? And what rank
---
Aim train and watch pro league matchs for game sense
---
The website you designed is so good, the only reason I knew it wasn't official was because I wasn't asked to give my date of birth every 5 minutes
---
Or party up communication

Yes i play on PC
---
rip, i play on ps4. Have fun on the test server!
---
Yes
---
What ?
---
So much potential but no, hostage on bank with funny mask
---
This works both ways

It seems boring as hell, its just hostage on bank. At least the skins are going to be around yearly if anybody ever feels like paying for them.

You oughta go out like that sometime and see if anyone knows who you are cosplaying as.

---
Do you honesty expect people to hear pings over gunshots
---
Great skin for a great gun
---
The only bad thing of the aug of iq is that take so much space in the screen but still a great gun
---
Thanks You!I'm enjoying ir right now i hope that bugisoft is developing a tts for PS4 so the console players can enjoy operarios earlier

You just gotta hold a white box

The audio in the background is the in-game noise, btw. Turn up vol if you can't hear it.

they probs wont, but its either I‚Äôm right or pleasantly surprised.

It only plays when I'm in R6 (obviously)

Negro is black in Spanish, so technically it‚Äôs not racist, it could be taken that way if some snow flake of a person were to be offended by it, and yes, Ubi does have a bot for slurs and cursing, but that is neither, it‚Äôs just very simple Spanish, or abuse of the system since it‚Äôs a foreign language

Totally agree. Irons are so underused.

Your tv might not support the aspect ratio rainbow six is trying to output. Maybe?

I don't have to because I rely on people actually getting on the mic because siege requires that level of communication, being silent the whole game is what terrible players do and relying on pinging is stupid, if you don't have a mic or are afraid to talk don't bother playing this game
---
The only thing I dont like is you know ubi wont compisate for what what level we already are.
---
Yeah I also wanna get sasuke and itachi in one tattoo
---
This season I believe.

Got it on ps4 when black ice was still going on I left around year one season one. Recently got back into it and am now on PC.

Never happened to me but it must have been awkward for everyone!

That guy kept talking about some kind of intergalactic collection or some shit but wouldn't say if he had any or not. So we killed him.
---
Im on xbox
---
there's honestly no way to tell. I'm assuming they stack up and are eventually given a ban, but who knows. I wish they sent us things like "A player you reported was banned"
---
They said it was impossible
---
I mean hey as they say if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. The art still gets the message across.
---
Spiral out

This is tremendous.

That's a big oof but the bigger oof is the fact bb got banned over blitz

bb is cancer

Give it a week. Its free weekend. All the fucking trolls make a smurf account and ruin games for new people, because their mom dropped them when they were babies.
---
Try from Tuesday, u may start to like it.
---
Was blood orchid the weeb or the honk konk one?
---
Cus at this point all I know is black ice  dust line and skull rain, everything after that is a blur.
---
Why would you buy the game when it‚Äôs a free weekend? Play a bit an then buy it.
---
I agree thinking back, a clean, crisp look may have been better for this certain background
---
Imma just give it another try and play some ranked
---
Had it before
---
I think he meant ‚Äúwhy did you record your tv‚Äù  lol

I know that it would have been easier to just say kthx and take my unban, but I'll be damned if I let a moderator bully me, or speak down to me, because he has power over my account.

I think the Season pass drops pur in december.
---
The Last year everytime in the 4th Season of the year the pass for the Next year Came out so i dont think this would be any other like.
---
But didn‚Äôt he just come back after he died?
---
I looked and you said you got tk 15 games in a row  that‚Äôs kinda hard to, I don‚Äôt even have that in a month ( 15 games)
---
With** I know I‚Äôm not the greatest at spelling oof
---
Many thanks
---
All I said was "Howd that work out for you guys?"
---
Find a different mod, this guy is on a power trip
---
Not tkd every time sometimes just grief smurfs or just annoying people
---
Oh wow thats really cool!
---
Is there any point playing the game? I have about 50 hours and everyone is extremely toxic. Before I play a game I have to mute everyone.
---
And pictures bucks gun
---
I'm very sad I cannot be jackal main anymore
---
Pass trough this phase ( it‚Äôs a free weekend so there‚Äôs more of toxicity) or find people to play with. The game is worth it. No matter how much I hate it and rage I always come back to it.
---
? what changes?
---
It says r4 c in bottom corner so it‚Äôs probably a joke about a text glitch .

On top of this he should be able to place multiple and plan a flush then the second is the one that is the killer

Some say Gridlock is still reloading to this day
---
Wow the competitive scene is really heating up this year.
---
Clean.
---
Because its the internet and it depends on context. I call things my gay friend does gay and i mean it in a joking way whereas other times or with other friends i use it as a synonym for shit or fucked. theres nothing wrong with being gay.
---
Wait, does her magazine really hold 31 rounds + one in the chamber?
---
Platform elitism is cringe my dude, no one cares that mum gave you a couple $1000 to build a gaming pc.
---
Repeat that plz
---
Don't play without a stack
---
I Ben know that
---
I love everything about this. Ty for putting all this effort into it. It's hands down the best fan op I've seen to date.
---
In what way is his gadget under powered? Nothing in this game makes me yell ‚Äúawww fuck‚Äù like getting fuzed. If he was a 2/2 he‚Äôd be picked more often but his gadget does not need a buff
---
You know what would be cool? If Ubisoft just dedicated an entire year of hand picking the best fan made season ideas and operator ideas within reason but they wouldn‚Äôt tell who was picked and hype it up to the reveal and actually showcase the ops and give credit.
---
Tactician would be over powered for sure. A bullet proof drone at all would throw the balance of the game but being able to fire attacks and 3 if them or being able to be controlled after death would make him super unbalanced, as well as this a specialised scope is just unnecessary. I understand that Tactician is just a concept but he would need a lot of changes before he would be balanced.
---
Haha I would but I don‚Äôt have any friends :(
---
Normies I rub food on my skin and take the nutrition from it as the husk of the food item eventually falls off and I use those husks to make little ants and they will do as I say so you can eat the cereal I'll just tip the bowl on my head.

What platform
---
I managed to fix it for me by restarting my computer
---
I'd rather not get one then get only Commons and uncommons for over a month.
---
The last camo I got that wasn't a common or uncommon was Black Ice for Glaz. The shit cursed me.
---
It should come out dec 2
---
Maybe 1st operation I year 5th?
---
Only reason you clutched is because the other team was brain dead
---
So they cheat
---
Or... An LMG with wheels... &gt;:)
---
Hostage KIA 
---
*Round One Lost*
---
Maybe it's an EU thing then because I havent quite ran into this problem in NA? And if anything I'd say just keep ranking up in Cas. So you become really good and game knowledge is solid and it should curb this experience you're having.
---
This is funny considering the generic stereotype of PC elitists being fat unwashed neckbeards.
---
They‚Äôd do it without the shield
---
There are websites and apps that can help you find a community of people and a team to play with. The best way to solve this issue is to play with other people consistently. If you party up with 2 or 3 people then you should rarely experience this.
---
It is well known that the R6 community is toxic. It can be entertaining for sure, until you are at the butt end of the toxicity. Hang in there. It's definitely worth it. I only use voice chat for call outs. If I'm playing with friends I'm always on party chat anyways. Good luck and don't let it get to you!
---
HEE HEEEE
---
This isn't iFunny
---
Excuse me? How did he shot you without looking at you???
---
Glad I am not the only one who's just playing with this bot when bored
---
See this kind of thinking is what we need. A slow moving LMG with wheels would be actually very good. I was thinking more along the lines of a MW2 juggernaut. Slow moving, very heavily armoured soldier with a hip fired machine gun. 
---
Maybe we could have him detach the MG from the shield and turret altogether, be able to ADS and all that good stuff, just reduce his movement speed. 
---
Think about it; 
---
You‚Äôre holding down an objective. Mount your shield turret and remove the gun. Play hard anchor and play defensively. When it gets down to the nitty gritty, run back, pop your MG onto the mount, and bam. Unexpected shielded Chank. I think he needs a rework because I love chank and honestly I used to do pretty good. No better feeling than racking up 4 kills in 5 seconds with the mounted MG.
---
Well, when hipfiring, you'll be lucky if you hit a barn, while standing inside
---
Doors and corners, kid, that's where they get ya.
---
Have you played it? Or are you just saying that because it‚Äôs old?
---
if this is true then...

Good ideas. 
---
Question for clarity... is Mantis a defender as well? Seems like a better Lesion. He could really work as an offense anti-roaming op though. That might be what you were going for, though, and I just misunderstood. 
---
I think the barricades barbed wire should also deal damage to vault over. Like, 15 to 20 HP, but you cant be downed by it or smth. 
---
Great effort and ideas though! The fact that you took this beyond a 5 minute Paint and notepad job says a lot, and dont be too surprised if Ubi reaches out.
---
any ranked game where people have common knowledge and drone things out they would shoot that wall so fast and you would be getting shot through the wall dead lol, and if you weren't dead, they would repel at the window and easily shoot the mira window open making it useless.

YOU MAY LAUGH NOW

Varsity Gaming, Get Flanked, and Rogue 9 all have very educational seige videos. Play newcomer as much as you can. There are also websites/apps where you can find players to play with.
---
Pay attention to kill cams. I have learned a lot from enemies who've killed me in ways or angles that I didn't even know about!
---
However, don't be afraid to play by yourself. Seige can have a steep leaning curve and they only way to get through it is putting in some hours. It is definitely discouraging and frustrating at times, but the payoff in the end is so satisfying!
---
Then hes just a worse maestro

There's only one rank between plat 2 and diamond. What's worse is having a team of silvers and unranked in your gold 1 game.

Hi hi, I doodled Dokkaebi and wanted to share with the community. I just started drawing like 6 months ago and I'm still horrid at hands... amongst a lot of other things so don't drag me too hard please and thank you. :3 Follow me at @digital.kitty on insta if you'd like! Happy Holidays!
---
Repost, so credit the artist please.
---
wtf
---
Slapping an ACOG on both the EDD and the mat would solve everything imo
---
He hasn't. He's just trying to initiate conflict.
---
Ela's guns are probably the worst in the game. Cool character and her mines are fun but otherwise it's hands down Vigil. Vigil has a really good smg, better gadgets, and is hard to see due to the mask and dark uniform, making him a great roamer.
---
*Details*

Damn I really thought u were gunna shoot it with that hesitation and get the kill

Crappy cake day
---
I would say, yes. But personally if i'd know (as a new player) what siege was like in the past compared to now i wouldn't.
---
Thonk smonk approve
---
It's a laptop so it most likely uses integrated gpu. As for temps i checked and they were running at 90C so that's most likely the issue
---
You just made it x100 interesting and worth playing
---
I feel like the intentional leaving should definitely be punished early on cause I‚Äôm sure the game can tell the difference (sorry if I‚Äôm wrong) when someone quits to main menu, and when someone lags out, it will say either ‚Äúhas been removed from match‚Äù(during ranked so this person wasn‚Äôt voted out) or ‚Äúlost connection‚ÄùIt is very frustrating as cav when you knock someone and go in for the interrogation but can‚Äôt because they leave before you even start it, Then join back, I feel this should be punished early but losing connection sure take it slow or no action at all
---
To stop people getting boosted by hackers
---
No focus = more kill, I can agree.
---
Thanks i appreciate the links!
---
And I definitely do sometimes but I try to involve at least one everytime... will mever get better if I never try lol
---
Because it‚Äôs bullshit if you gain/lose MMR because of hackers - intentional or not.
---
Well more of a dick If you cant aim a mm Higher
---
Depends on your play style, if you like to rush, take Zofia, but if you're a sneaky one Maverick's good. Maverick really is fun I have to say
---
Next time you're jumping through a window blind, remember you've got 60 rounds loaded. Let Caveira try to outstab bullets!
---
ok thanks
---
Old account probably there is no data before op health on site, so it probably bought for hacking.
---
2 speed works fine though. No one goes ‚ÄòGeez, Nokk is so slow!‚Äù
---
Its the purest Kind my dear
---
I prefer a better weapon first imo
---
How
---
I get that but how do they know for sure they were hackers, I haven't had any ranked match in which one of my teammates was that good that he must have been a hacker.
---
&gt; I think it was a bug and I think they fixed it recently, don't quote me on that though
---
&gt;

Too late. What you gonna do about it now?

I think it improved me better, since I had like 4 ops at each side for sometime and got new characters slowly I learned to how to use the ones I had. Still I wonder a lot about the ops I don't have yet. I play them on test server.
---
Yes, they do.
---
What is this? The alpha?

"I think it was  a bug and I think they fixed it recently" - JagerMainOwo 11/24

By your logic Doc, Montagne, Twitch, Recruit or literally anyone else in balaclava looks like Rook.
---
It would divide the playerbase too much, try to find a team
---
That ..... i...... I literally dont know
---
i dont get it, are they good or hacking?
---
you are welcome, retard
---
Sick shot. It‚Äôs my cake day too!
---
This sounds like insult
---
Now think that as a Fuze gadget...
---
If the game wasn't profitable in its current state, a one time event with overpriced skins is not going to fix that. They are taking money in hand-over-fist with the current amount of microtransactions and ever since they've shilled for the chinese government to get the game into the chinese market game sales alone would continue to support this game.

*Just chillin with the boyz*

I agree with u/ShrekOgre69420 what do you play on

it depends on what platform your using, on pc you can communicate with your teams that are in a 4 stack through gamechat, but on console its different
---
What rank are you?

A Thai operator that does a Ram Muay for his elite victory screen would be dope.

Because.your.in.a.drone it‚Äôs supposed to be looking like that (I think) to show the kind of flicker
---
This post sounds like it was written by an 8 year old
---
You lagged that‚Äôs all
---
So you're saying it's an intentional design decision? Never heard of aliasing being used intentionally for game design before.
---
If you look closely to the drone picture you can see the lines for to signify the electronics
---
I would say cheating. Clearly that‚Äôs not the rank they should be in and are abusing the system and are thus cheating.
---
Guess some people can't take a joke.

Alibi works everywhere. 3 speed, a great SMG, impacts and a secondary shotty to help you open up rotations anywhere you go. Also a gadget that you can use to cover your back.

I've always thought they needed to make his turret work like a shield. You can keep it on your back and walk around with it, moving as you would normally. Then, you can pull it out, and carry it around like a heavy machine gun, with a movement speed debuff. Just a simple damage buff and rof Nerf would make him super fun to play (and distinguish him from other operators with the LMG). They should also add some sort of shield piercing ability or bleed (maybe for slowing down like lesion but on a lesser scale?) Honestly, that'd make him a great op. I get the whole meme deal, but the potential he has is way too big to be overlooked imo
---
It depends on the playstyle of the enemy she can be strong but you just have to play really conservative to not get yourself killed while going for an inteeo
---
It's not just for show, it does pay off, though I would say in a coordinated environment the tradeoff is more in favour of being sneaky than spray and pray in the most literal sense

That's another possible explanation. I have seen this in open spaces though, nowhere near any walls or barricades. But who knows what actually happens. We at least know it is a rendering issue, and that it is really hilarious

Find some friends and do classic terrorist hunt on realistic my preferred map is House + you get good aim practice

I also saw a video about a guy testing some methods out and what method was the fastest

Remember to do weekly and daily challenges

Maverick is a great solo queue op, but you need to know the maps. He‚Äôs 3 speed, has a good gun, has a good gadget for hard breaching, all of that makes him a great solo queue op. The M4 has a bit of kick if you use an acog even with a vertical grip but I use compensator and it‚Äôs manageable.

Maverick. Great guns, 3 speed, useful gadget with no counters.

May I also recommend yourself getting a squad. This game can be hell to solo queue and trying to find a match in unranked can take literally forever  if you aren‚Äôt queuing with anybody so use https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams and you can find some people that are willing to play with you and could potentially become your friends, good luck.
---
Yes . But it‚Äôs cheating and the most dick move

It's not 2 late to delete this

Now it has two purposes üòÇ
---
When you hit "Search for match" in a ranked game, you commit to 20-40 minutes of being in that game. I understand internet issues. I understand emergencies. But all the same, they committed to a game, and they didn't honor that commitment. Something needs to be done.
---
I made a strat to deal with this. I only play ranked against plats and are now better than them, even as a gold one.
---
Oh man... When people want to create a rotation and clip me in the process... That hurts :(

Sure, if you were to find the IP of another player and pay a service to ddos them then ubisoft wouldn't be able to do anything about that. 
---
However if someone is targeting ubisoft servers they can use logging and analytics software to determine the duration of the attack and the impacted infrastructure. They likely host regional servers so you would be able to tell where players were impacted by the attack. This would allow you to revert the penalty for all users in the impacted region during the attack window. You could get even more granular by determining which users were logged into the impacted servers during the window if not all of the regions servers were impacted.
---
Most of the systems they would need are likely already in place for general infrastructure and application monitoring and alerting. I'm sure they're running an ELK stack or some SaaS product like datadog so they would just to create new algorithms and dashboards to curate and display the necessary data already being logged.  From there you just need a script to take that data as input and update the appropriate databases and refresh their caching servers.
---
Yes this solution would require some engineering cycles to implement, but its  not unrealistic or technically infeasible.
---
HOW THE HELL? You're lucky af

The only gameplay difference is that you don't swap sides every round, instead you swap sides every two rounds (apart from overtime, you still swap every round there).
---
Man and here I thought I was the only one thinking the same thing, lol.

Shes very good with a team. But her gun isnt on par with the L85, the f90 has less damage. But i agree that she is underpicked.
---
Nice repost.
---
Not only for the 416 tho, same for the p16 or whatever that pistol is called and the m870
---
What about when you miss the impact because the drone made it through the drone hole
---
You need an adapter for it to work properly. Siege doesn‚Äôt recognize m&amp;k by default so you‚Äôd be looking at spending another $120 or some shit to get it to work.

I don't understand why Ubisoft doesn't just automatically cause team damage to hurt you. Like, from the very first bullet, any damage you would have inflicted on a teammate i should be automatically on you. What's the point of not doing that?

Nice edit

Yes it actually happened to me yesterday.
---
Nope, just a statement pertaining to the situation at hand, take it with a grain of salt.
---
On PC, I have this on occasion. I think it occurs when your drone loads before the collision of the map does due to lag on the user end, and therefore your drone falls through. It's always cool to see the skybox for the first time, but annoying everytime after. Usually after falling long enough the drone will reach out of bounds and be teleported back to its original location
---
Oh God those ideas sound really cool, I hope they do it, it can be a little weird to see in this type of game but I'm in.
---
Eyyy, a fellow FBI shield recruit!

Sure you don'tü§îüëå
---
Seeing as they are both pro league maps they are seen as 2 of the best 7.
---
These issues are already present in the current system. A one hour ban likely won't change a salty players behavior and it doesn't take exigent circumstances like power loss or emergencies into account.
---
If a salty player were banned for 24 hours that may change their behavior and a regular player would have to be incredibly unlucky to have so many emergencies that they would accrue such a penalty.
---
yea i‚Äôm not that good so this is the coolest thing i‚Äôve done yet, i heard docs fat body shuffling around so i just shot

They can be. And reinforced walls do look like that, without the soft wall

Seems like it happened because he was already prone when he fell through the hatch.

I think it is a bug as well. It already happened with me before.

---
I try to install the last driver. Let's see if it brings something.
---
i let you know if it solves the problem ;)
---
On offense I recommend playing as a shield operator so you get the hang of things without getting killed as easily. That‚Äôs what I did for a long time until I figured things out then I started playing as everyone. On defense anchoring is probably the way to go right away. Learning the maps is probably more important than anything too. Then learning the different features of all the operators is the next thing I‚Äôd say.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Happned to me too but every time i tried re-joining it just said 
---
"Connection error"
---
780 RPM would be a suitable buff, but then I think it should go down to 38 damage to match the F90/G36C. 
---
Having said that, I don't think making minor tweaks to Finka is high on Ubisoft's priorities considering her shitty place in the meta. We might see sweeping changes to her with a rumoured overhaul. Also, they're very reluctant to change the fire rate of weapons regardless (some speculate it's down to animations).

Honestly if you were pc could of helped but I don't play PS4 so I don't have the PS4 experience to help out. ( Just listen to what the buck main said) something else, don't always play to how you feel, if everyone is playing a roaming operator maybe play anchor and also start off by playing rook or dock, jager and mute on defense and sledge, IQ,blitz, ash, thermite or Thatcher on attack. Also take time to understand how to control the recoil.

Goosey. Part of the gsg9 (goose shit gang nine) (Defender) Can steal any attackers weapon and use it against them (like a gadget mozzie) and also can pick up the defuser and extract it. Attackers are forced to regather and plant again. Although OP, Goosey does not have a gun and can only use stolen weapons/items. Also can be a idiot and steal the bombs, instantly losing the round for the defenders.

I just run it on most setups and it's working out really well. I do think that the perk that allows you to get 2 explosive gadgets should not include claymores though. If I were to change anything about them it's that.
