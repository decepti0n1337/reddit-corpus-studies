Holy fuck, you don't have any clue what you're talking about

Why are you always posting wrong shit on this subreddit?
---
Bah. It's just a button press. What matters at the end of the day is how you feel about it.
---
Lesion is elite
---
[removed]
---
I know this is random, but how do you say what you main?
---
Uhm wha
---
Does that reset at some point or something? I mean its not like hes always on a winstreak.
---
if you have a hacker on your match, every round start, you have to do 10 sit-ups
---
I lowkey miss hostage from ranked.
---

---
For all of the imbalances it really gets the blood pumping.
---
RIP. Ubi needs to figure this shit out. This season is hot garbage.
---
Oh I would hit up a mira elite in a heartbeat
---
I also have been hitting doc specifically in the lower head and him not dying
---
it's hard to say really. I do not believe it is.
---
Does it need to specifically in big ass bold letters say "THIS IS WHAT THE CHARM FOR PHANTOM SIGHT LOOKS LIKE, THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER, WE DESIGNED A RANDOM PLACEHOLDER WITH A THEME INSTEAD OF JUST SHOWING THE CHARM DESIGN THAT WE FINISHED IN 2 DAYS IN THE OFFICE"
---
She looks exactly like Ash. We don't need clones everywhere
---
Of which I'm starting to question them. 
---
If not AR, they should have given her slightly bit stronger Defender guns. She's the only non-shield Attacker who gets outgunned by popular Defenders. She has the least fighting chance against Anchors holding angle. 
---
Now she's one of the worst Attacker according to Ubi's own data.
---
The biggest flex in siege MY GOD
---
One time I had that same glass reflect the piano in piano room even though there was no way it could reflect that.
---
This was a struggle to read but I completely agree the system is fucked up. You get punished way more for losing games in a row versus rewarded for winning games in a row. I went from Silver Iv to Copper 1 after losing 5 games in a row, 2 of which from DDoS. I won 5 games in a row tonight , getting MVP in 2 games and second or third in the others, and literally just got back up to Bronze III. Insanity.
---
Ubi could have used more fictional guns or something if they don't have license to use certain brands. 
---
Nokk is one of the most unique Attacker and deserves her own gun so she can be balanced around more easily.
---
That‚Äôs the only reason why I‚Äôm going for Plat instead of being okay in Gold this Season, the reward charms actually look good for a change.
---
J√§ger and Bandit are 3 speed
---
Totally agree with you üòâüëç Thanks for the support! üí™üèª
---
Yea and im a pc plat u fucking retard so nice assumption again. If its headshots for days then go fucking use it and climb to the rank 1 in diamond cause ur so good at the game and never miss a shot right? Ur just a fucking armchair diamond who probably sucks dick at the game and thinks he knows everything about the game so u make statements like o dmrs suck dick because i said so, maybe u just suck dick at the game and my assumption is you do.
---
That's cause they got rid of console pro league smartass.
---
This is like "Unpopular opinion: Sandwiches are good", it is the most agreeable opinion you can possibly make.
---
i know right and my friend who had a bad day went from gold 3 to bronze 1 and that season was barley able to get gold 4 by the end
---
Lmao your fucking flairs
---
OpErAtiOn hEaLTh
---
Umm... what the French toast?
---
You need to chill tfo man. I haven‚Äôt played rank for awhile so I didn‚Äôt know that it shows the actual physical reward at the beginning of each season. God forbid there is any surprise to it? You fuckin dick.
---
Lesion is an amazing solo queue operator. On PC, even you're a semi decent player with good game sense, you can literally use him to carry yourself out of gold every season.
---
  
---
Valk is also amazing for solo queue. Been maining her since Dust Line, and over time have adopted and adjusted strats for most sites that allow me to just make aggressive solo plays with no risk of dying (unless I potato). Use her to solo carry myself into plat 3-2 every season. From there I'll usually pick up a squad
---
Yeah not sure if Warden is a priority cop for me ngl but I could see it being useful like the odd time

Maybe if you where talking about his title you should of out that in your title...... If I missed the point of your post it's because you are too dumb to make a point.

Yeah I feel like Jackal will be my next purchase
---
What combo is this? I love it
---
Jeez it looks terrible I‚Äôm surprised they managed to release a elite that looks worse than glaz‚Äôs
---
sucks to suck
---
A) if the game wants to cater pro league then they need to take out uncompetitive maps and shit they can't go 50/50, B) considering I only play ranked I'd call that bull shit kid, and where are you getting this information from kid? Lmao go back to copper kid you don't know how to play that game, as someone who dicks around and still manages to hit Plat every season Soloing and duo queuing on various accounts I would say I'm better then average player especially considering I top frag 80% of the matches I win, and probably 70% of the matches I play, and I was calling them out because the logic of "Finka isn't OP because she doesn't get played 24/7" isn't an argument someone who's played the game would make, oit of my four accounts one is below level 100 and it's like 75 and I rarely play on it
---
They should make it only for guns they fool acogs off of to be douches about it lmao
---
I am not obligated to prove my competence or intelligence to you. If you missed such an obvious point, and chose to, even after "probably" reading the first 2 comments, then clearly you lack common sense. Don't blame me for your lack of basic grasping power.

The problem with him is that right now his blowtorch can‚Äôt be heard sometimes at all, even if you are right next to the wall

I like this idea
---
Soon as I hit gold for the first time, I just stopped playing cause I'm genuinely not interested in what this season has to offer now, I enjoy the Kafe rework and N√∏kk, not so much warden but it's whatever, but I just grew tired of playing ranked as it's just the same ops banned every single game with no strategy or consideration just instantly banning the same ops every single time, plus I didn't care about the showdown event as it didn't interest me, now I'm just waiting to see news about the next season to be honest.

---
Siege saying fuck you
---
Nah it was just one salty teammate who got their panties in a wad because you didn‚Äôt go in and die instantly like everyone else.
---
Let me clear up one point, which clearly, many in this sub are clearly capable of missing.
---
Instead of asking me to watch his video, which I have, since I am a fan of Flanked and would only desire that he grow, if you have taken 30 seconds out of your invaluable time to read 2 of my other comments, you'll notice that my problem is not with the content, but with the title.
---
The content is fine. You can use what he says regardless of your rank. It's basically a tips and tricks video focusing on vertical play, an easy to pick up but hard to master tactic that is used abundantly in siege. It is the TITLE that is the issue. Allow me to explain.
---
Zo is not underrated at all, even amongst new players and definitely not at lower ranks. my squad mate who was new to PC And siege was crying that he didn't have zofia 2 days into the game, and this was y3 s3 when starter was still a thing. New players are well aware of the presence of an op that is present in literally every game, so titling a video about the same as "underrated" is false marketing. It only gives the image that people don't use her enough so the can just jump right into her. While she is easy to use, anybody who's played this game for at least 200 hours knows she's invaluable to the team and can't be played without prior aim training and game sense. So the question of underrated is doing more harm than good.
---
He ha a veteran siege YouTuber. He needs to measure his content and his choice of words wisely to ensure good growth. He can't just take a well known op and call him or her underrated. Like I said, multiple times, if I may say so myself, the content is fine, so it is the issue with the choice of title, and titles on YouTube videos is ALWAYS the primary force of attraction. Simply calling it a tips and tricks video would have attracted a more unbiased judgement, more interest, since you are no longer making a controversial point in the title, and a more fruitful discussion. Doesn't matter if everybody calls it "tips and tricks". At least it will be true to the content. 
---
Catering to a specific bracket of the playerbase is perfectly fine, which flanked does. But making it so blatantly wrong is an error no content creator can afford. Look at the current scenario- nobody above  gold would watch it. It might or might not be for them, but it is a good video to watch regardless, but the principle marketing force, aka the title, has completely turned away a lot of viewers.
---
It's all in the title. Don't doubt flanked's content. It is really good and worth the watch, including this one. He just needs to rework his titles..
---
Haters- ‚ÄúTechnically it was a 4k‚Äù
---
The same kids that think k&amp;b on console is unfair think that PC is not Superior. The answer is that the precision and control of a k&amp;b will always far exceed a joystick. Hence, some tactics kids get away with on console would never fly on a PC. This also means the level of competition and skill of the players is also much higher. A bad decision on PC will likely leave you punished and dead before you know it. There are no professional console siege players for a reason.

!" Secondly, limit the number of reports, but make them more impactful. Maybe you get 4 or 5 a week for example. Or 1 for every 5 games completed. Something like that. If you report someone and they are subsequently punished, you get one back. "

Hunh, so there was no walking sound bug? Weird that the Pros and Streamers would talk about it, and I've come across it but no you're right, you're dumb ass says it never existed in the last couple of months so it didn't :)

I did watch the video, mate. It is unfair to the content creator to judge purely based on just the title. I would never do that.
---
This is only slightly impressive because you're on console. This shits easy on pc

There was a somewhat recent change to ranked, that changed the round system so it's more similar to the pro league system where there is consecutive attacking/defending rounds. Instead of the old system of rotating after each round

Did you just see the elite and turn that into a post and call it "yours and your friends' idea"?

As long as you hadn‚Äôt started any rounds probably not. Even if you have probably not. As long as you don‚Äôt lose any rank points I‚Äôm ok with connecting to another match. Happened to me 4-3 and I think everyone was kicked out. Couldn‚Äôt reconnect. Probably a ddos.

Do a quick scroll. You'll see about 5 posts per day having been made since the release of that image.
---
Uhhh what?
---
Jesus, this is why I made fun of your reading comprehension. Im saying, that all the bugs, related to not hearing different sounds, are the same bug. This bug, can effect most sounds in the game, but because of how the sound system was made for this game, and how certain sounds act in the engine, breaches, (breaching charges, Hibana, Maverick, and Thermite) are the most effected by this bug. I never said that the other sound issues weren't occurring.
---
Alcohol destroys gains

how about being able to chose those mods and not them beeing only temporaly events

Yea just wishful thinking

Smurf?

He has a weak gun but a gadget with good potential. So can we start with the same buff that Glaz got?

No i didn't even know he had an elite tbh
---
You did say they didn't sincw I literally said it wasn't just hard breachers and you immediately said I was wrong, all you do it say the opposite of what I say and then call me stupid because you yourself cannot read

Ubi already did this so why are you adding a watermark for a copied idea?

No its not mine ill take a L rather than leave plus i have 3 accounts.  But my point is how is that so high for that guy.
---
Funny coincidence.
---
Go to YouTube and search for siege smoke elite leak, or even on this sub.
---
You'll see how close your idea is with the leaked one.
---
When/where did they do that?
---
Because it spreads?
---
Like you said, it's a blood "splat". If the blood splat animation was the size of the bullet then you wouldn't exactly see it and there wouldn't be any point of Ubi implementing it into the game, so it's bigger than the actual bullets that you shoot.
---
In this case I'm assuming OP hit the shoulder or something close to the head and since the splat is larger than the bullet, part of the splat is covering the head area.
---
It seems like that lmao
---
cus if the ball comes in line with his face his goin down

I want to point out that if vigil had seen him you might have lost your head. Unless you had coms

I‚Äôm literally losing my shit this is so funny. Forwarded it to the rest of my team

You called it "sound bugs". All I said was that it's not "bugs". It's one bug, I didn't say you were flat out wrong, or that hard breachers were the only ones effected, you're just fucking retarded

That's not how thay works, your smurf doesn't default higher then your main, that literally makes no sense, and because that FBM smurf I only play with a friend on that one, where as if I play on my main I solo and dick around, I don't know why you're asking, nothing I say will make you believe me lmao if you wanna think I'm shit go for it dude

If you have to smurf to place high you're shit yeah. That's how that goes. Imagine smurfing on console where the average opponent is 12 and retarded?
---
Honestly, I think they would enjoy the game even more, and let the rest of enjoy our games more. Sounds like a win/win
---
That's in-game marketing, You'll buy one soon enough

I'm just saying, if that was PC you would've been got popped in the head. PC player are crackheads

Yeah I think if this was implemented by day one no one would be thinking about buying adapters and things from that kind, nobody would think of buying an adapter bc the game already accepts MnK, then there wouldn't be this problem nowadays, this is the main reason why I wanna move over to PC, MnK on console are almost the equivalent to cheaters on PC
---
Theres a big blue mark on the picture
---
I play thatcher most on attack and jager on defense. I mostly use shotguns as well, but whenever i play with their smgs or lmg I make sure to keep the dots off i just cant play with a dot sight.
---
I place relatively high regardless? And imagine saying you'll block someone but being too much of a bitch to actually do so, imagine thinking a PC player is better then a console player, there's just as many stupid 12 year old kids on PC, case in point your Copper bitch ass lmao, go back to trying to brag because you get to Plat on the easiest platform to do so and act like you're good because of it, I mean you think smurf accounts place higher then mains so clearly you're not intelligent lmao

Jesus fuck. It's trying to speak

I've literally never seen this 4th concussion used or even ever talked about and I've been playing R6 for a while, this is news to me lmao

It's the power fantasy. He has power over the people he encounters in the game. Like any bully, he gets off on having that power and control over others and knowing that they can't fight back.
---
No one would use it, everyone uses the secondary shotgun because utility = best. Same reason no one uses the, I don't even actually know what its called, on Gridlock/Mozzie or the again I don't know what its called on Mira/Jackal. You're just kicking yourself in the nuts if you don't choose the utility of a secondary shotgun.

Sorry bro I don't speak broke console bitch. Can u speak up!?? can't hear your through this watercooled ventilation system. Oh wait, yes I can, cause my PC doesn't VRVR when my platform tries to get 240 fps.

---
Kid‚Äôs bedroom only has one entrance and one exit. If fuze hits a window with his cluster charge, there‚Äôs a bottleneck to leave and he‚Äôs guaranteed a kill. In addition, it lets attackers secure the room by just putting Monty at the door and holding.
---
Someone already told me, what could be a better fix for the MnK people on console?
---
These attackers were actually bots. I pray every day I get an OpFor team that is as dooky as this.

Hats off to you for making the kills, but this is the saddest siege play I have ever seen.

It's because the toxicity system is horrible. There needs to be a system that will actually ban these toxic little kids. They do this because they know nothing will happen

As of right now nothing but Sony and the console providers themselves as there basically allowing the third party software /devices
---
I‚Äôm terrible at siege and I know exactly how this feels. Game makes sure that every player at every skill level suffers retards/toxics on their team
---
I'm actually not speaking at all so that's probably why you wouldn't be able to hear me :), there is absolutely no way you're not a 12 year old lmao, you're salty because you were wrong and have no argument, I do enjoy how you think console is so easy, please buy a console, and get to diamond within a month, it should be simple for someone as great as you are little buddy
---
Hmm I guess it has been done. While i dont deny that those came first and are a similar idea, I dont recall seeing either before. It is possible to have the same idea independantly

I agree I used to play alone and as I met child people I would play with them until I got a full team and now we almost never play ranked unless we are all there.

From amazon, just search for Thermite - Six collection. It also comes with an in-game code for a charm of the figure itself.
---
Yeah, hell, playing with friends even has chances of putting you in mid matches
---
TWO WHIRL WARS
---
This is the same issue I had in a ranked match me and ash were shooting each other but it didn‚Äôt register so knife fight I won no time to defuse
---
it‚Äôs so much worse in league from my experience but that‚Äôs just me
---
It‚Äôs probably a common
---
It could be one of the best in the game, still wouldn't matter. Secondary shotgun is free utility, in a game that revolves around utility that will always be more important.
---
Also GEO has some of the best primaries in the game so theres also that.
---
U clearly don't play rocket league
---
Right but this guy I saw, he didn‚Äôt exactly have crazy aim, nor absolutely brilliant gamesense. He wasn‚Äôt really doing any plat level gameplay that would warrant such good stats on such a low level account. I was gonna ask him if he was using an alt or something but he left the match half way through.
---
Yeah it should be put in place a licensing system where only licensed third party devices should be able to be recognized as useable on the console
---
My first and so far only black ice skin is chonky's bad pistol.
---
Dude i would lose it if a doc memed on me like that.
---
Repost
---
True. I'm just saying that the USP goes from a mediocre sidearm to a shit one in comparison, even when ignoring the shotgun's utility. It's just that the choice goes from bad to worse against the shotgun.
---
What a loser.
---
it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs also really easy to get high stats on low accounts if your a smurf. If i wanted to, i could make a smurf, play with coppers, get like a 10 win loss and a 6 kd or some shit
---
Then play with a team
---
You merely adopted the router, I was born in it, moulded by it.
---
I meant gold not good
---
Fun story, i was doing some field training (real life army stuff) and we were using blanks. At one point while my squad is on line and firing i feel the side of my face getting warm. I look over and a squadmate has the end of their rifle on line with my head, about a foot away. Because of the bfa the gunshot went to the sides, so i had some gunpowder residue getting thrown on me.
---
Thankfully they only blanks, otherwise id probably be deaf in that ear, but it was one of those little reminders that even blanks can fuck your day up.
---
I use 3 shot burst to have better stability and aim in CQC. Plus you have more control. It‚Äôs just a personal preference on how you like it.
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
Yes
---
Good job bud!

I still can‚Äôt believe they gave him the MPX :(

Well with the VPN I‚Äôm saying if they want to hardware ban them they can‚Äôt because the VPN hides their ip and location.

Before going in try to get decent with every type of operator (roamer, anchor, rusher, soft and hard breacher) just so you have it in your back pocket. A big part of ranked is learning utility and figuring out what your team needs out of you. If you can be comfortable being in a flex role, it will take pressure off your teammates and help them too.
---
I love ranked and the challenges of playing 2v5 and etc. Make as many friends as you can in ranked so you can start setting your self up with 5 stacks to avoid those solo queuing players who quit on your team since any one who leaves to save stats and cant be a team player was never a benefit to you any ways .
---
I hate them when they do a meme strat

Ooohhhh no I thought it was an airsoft fun lol
---
it's not funny anymore dude . Move on for now
---
I remember seeing it. Good times, good times
---
Thanks for turning yourself in. One less criminal out there. /s
---
True. Hopefully Ubisoft will figure something out. Like banning people who purposely ruin the game
---
I posted my first day stats with the hashtag getfitwithsiege on twitter
---
Nah or you could just ban them.
---
any decent bb will kill you before you hit his head
---
Kapkan is a better Tachanka in terms of guns anyways
---
Feels bad man
---
The recoil on that thing is so ridiculous that I doubt anyone will even use it with an acog
---
Honestly it's her in-game eyes... Looks hella weird
---
I am weak
---
Kapkan is blind and deaf!
---
Where did you get such "advice" from? Why wait until after prep phase? If your squad is going to rush, you won't get rid of defender utility in time.
---
Harassing defenders with Shock Drone was only viable before the nerf. Now with only 5 shots, it is too valuable to do so.
---
As for staying outside to drone, if your drone sees a opportunity for a frag and you are outside, by the time you get into position, defenders will have slaughtered your squad and you would have been votekicked from the match.
---
Also kill the cameras.
---
What's the trophy criteria? What do you need to do?
---
When jackal ascends you know it's all over
---
Did my dude really just dislocated his arm to dab
---
Bruh.
---
If you look on his wiki it has him listed as additional voices.
---
Actually I don't care the people who pay for diamond. I hate boosters. I need to carry 4 teammates to beat 5 plats. And I just fight for gold II/I. Mostly I can't win 4 rounds like that...
---
And there are some people fking derank alone. They just quit when the match begins...
---
Gold isn't good, lol. Maybe if you're consistently gold 1/plat 3 but even then you're likely not "good".
---
Being able to survive 2-3 headshots on a peek is very overpowered. It means the difference between dying and/or securing a free kill, which is huge.
---
i've only been hit in casual ONCE with my friend. I really dont know why people hit casual, like what's the point?
---
idk either man
---
Many put together.
---
Analyzing my mistakes one, get out of silver, get out of gold, pro interviews (I loved these ones), what I learned playing against ____, how not to roam against good players (few points), how to master sound, and many more.
---
Mainly, the solo queue one because it tells you why you shouldn't do it. Got a squad, got out of bronze.
---
Dokkaebi
---
You have to get 5 defuses in bomb mode this should seem easy then expect but I‚Äôm having trouble
---
Did you win that match?
---
That's the sad part.
---
shut the fuck up. it‚Äôs trash and you know it
---
I love that it was match point and your Frost must have panicked the entire game

Hello -ReallyDontKnow-, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cg9fxq/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Okay first of all why does rank matter? Second of all those bullets are coming out incredibly fast so it is moot nice try kid I'm done talking to you since you think all of this matters
---
I started out with uncontrollable full auto (spray and pray) then moved to burst fire (improved k/d) then now is controlled full auto (manual burst and spray as the situation dictates).
---
At least it has 3 modes and more maps
---
so you're thinking about nerfing twitch AGAIN?!?! fucking seriously any attacker thats actually worth a shit you nerf and make the defence side like ungodly fucking powerful! its a fucking F2 the guns suppose to be deadly accurate it was designed that way if anything needs rebalancing its your sight alignment and your shitter hitboxes that are so bad! fucking headshots dont even land half the time anymore and because of it im FORCED to go for fucking body shots because those atleast SOMETIMES register. stop nerfing the good attack ops you already design every map to be defender sided as fuck to the point that its not to impossible to get in, you guys have ignored the boosters/hacker problem for over YEARS and still havent done anything but hey WE ARE GETTING RID OF CLIENT SIDE DEBRIS ON WINDOWS AND DOORS yippie.... seriously fix the actual important crap now i dont blame shroud for denouncing siege. shit anti-cheat system mixed with a money grabbing dev team that doesnt even care about the fact that a pro can land clear as day headshots and even the shout casters go"that was clearly a headshot" the new lean cam has even made the game EVEN MORE defender sided. and you guys dont even ban half the people that are actually needing to be banned. EMBARRASSING
---
Sucks to suck
---
Play casual, set your matchmaking preferences to bomb only, play anchor ops like Rook, Doc, etc. This is risky, but if you're confident enough in your skills you could roam, wait for a plant to go down, then fight your way through to the defuser (that's high skill though and you sound relatively new so maybe dont try this unless you're having a good day)
---
Why would he need a new router? Surely just changing the router‚Äôs IP would work as well?
---
Wp
---
yes with monty
---
This is disgusting. Things like this just ruin the game
---
Yeah I‚Äôd imagine visa issues would eventually come up, but I never worried too much about it because i was never sure if we would make it that far. That‚Äôs good to know though, thank you :)
---
i throw because i don‚Äôt want the guy with the bot getting anything out of the match
---
Soldier here. Blanks still cause an explosion inside the rifle like live ammunition. The gas and small pieces of the blanks can still hurt or kill you.
---
A half circle of 3-10m in front of the barrel is the normal safe distance.
---
The goal of these bots are to lose the match
---
220
---
really? i now regret throwing these matches then
---
The more you know
---
They want to throw without actually playing, thats why they set these automatic things up
---
Damn nigga
---
If u dont place ur gadgets on defense 5 push ups
---
Oh shit, didn't expect to see you on this subreddit
---
Delete.....now
---
i know thats why i stated that we should get through the other countries,nationalities etc before we make another american op
---
Knowing ubisoft they'll somehow get the actual acog on the gun through a bug.
---
As someone who lives opposite Hereford Base IRL I agree
---
Its 4:3 stretched but shadowplay shrunk it to normal 4:3 in the recording
---
I suppose your right but on console newcomer is dead i waited 15 mins on my smurf and found no lobby
---
Thanks i will try!
---
I mean cmon he had a helmet on lmao
---
Not shooting back was a good tactic, he might‚Äôve thought: teammate
---
Most definitely wouldn't be killed or injured.
---
^(now this is art)
---
What's your Ubi name? We could play later when I get off work if you'd like
---
What?
---
Secure and hostage are easy just put traps around hostage or traps in area and easy wins lesion kapkan ela thoose sort of ops
---
Damnnnn now I see it
---
that does not make a lot of sense. what‚Äôs the goal?
---
These players like to throw to copper and see if they can get out
---
He's probably on mobile and it posted but didn't say it did. Happened to me before
---
When was this?
---
I didn't get it cuz it's my usual ping
---
Ubisoft really needs to fix this
---
Oh man, I remember this one time, it was Casual Bomb and as Castle I locked myself inside the Football Office of Favela. We managed to win that one.
---
that explains a lot. thank you kind sir
---
Fuze, Buck, Gridlock, Castle, or Rook. My money would be on Gridlock.
---
It's funny when I get in that mood and pick sledge for just fucking breach and rush plays. Some how it ends up working out with me taking out like 3 people who are roaming. Just so I can die haha.
---
They actually last as long as they did before so idk where you are getting this from. Most ranked games usually last around 20- 25 minutes give or take. Trust me, you‚Äôll be doing yourself a favor because I too get pissed super easily in casual, especially if I am playing by myself. Getting some friends and hopping on ranked will do you wonders and you‚Äôll be playing the game like it‚Äôs meant to be with thought out strategies and such and won‚Äôt have to suck the dick of diamonds that play recklessly in casual because they feel like they can get away with it, when they know they can only do that in casual because if they die and lose they have nothing to lose while in Ranked it‚Äôs different.
---
In the end Ranked is a big learning experience and it doesn‚Äôt matter if you win or lose, as long as you are learning from your experience and try next time to improve yourself and get better as a player in general.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm 16 and if I did this it would look 10x worse. I think these look nice.
---
When Echo received the French nationality.
---
Not really it's Thatcher but nice anyway
---
They ideally need to fix the surrender mechanic in matches now to only allow surrendering if you're losing. I went from Silver 2 to something in copper yesterday as I kept getting into matches where the team was doing well and got to 3-0 followed by the other teammates surrendering
---
I just had this happen on pc in high plat/diamond. Thought it was just a console thing. First time in 2500 hours lol.
---
Fall from a roof while aiming down a hatch, reconnect all cables below your desk
---
Exactly what I say whenever some typical r6 shit happens lol
---
But i just dont want to play ranked when i have a booster on, i simply just want to farm renown in Cas, second, none of my friends play siege so yeah...
---
if you can't formulate a coherent argument and then think resorting to name calling and swearing will get your point across, you're wrong there bud
---
if i order one of these, do i actually get the op with it?
---
So what would the categories be. 
---
Toxicity (that could be split into Tks shouting and non harming things like setting of flashbangs at spawn)
---
Tks 
---
Actively ignoring the objective 
---
And bad plays (this would mean you are matched with lower level players.) not too sure how the last one would work
---
Ty m8!!
---
so its half solo
---
RicedOUTcivic. It said I was banned for multiple offenses of cheating
---
Just shut up and stay away from ranked, dickhead
---
I have B O T H
---
Im on xbox
---
It needs to be reworked. Too many times some douchebag is trolling the team and of course his braindead waste of oxygen friend refuses to kick him. This shit is flawed.
---
Seem like a legit w/l
---
I mean, it only takes a couple weeks of waiting, then you can stick a proper stock onto it.
---
Really wish the ATF application to SBR's would go. It was put there to stop gangsters from getting Thompsons in the 30's, and basically has zero purpose today, all it does is waste time and money. No clue why it's still there.
---
yes it's orderlioncosplay.com
---
Maybe get some more friends and not worry so much about getting renown. There are plenty of ways to find some to play with including, but not limited to, r/R6STeams. You can get a crew play play casual with and when you feel like you‚Äôve had enough of it, like your post seems to imply, the they can play Ranked with you. The only person here suffering is you so if you aren‚Äôt willing to change things up then the situation you are in will never change.
---
Idk but the same thong happened to me
---
Just Ubi being Ubi I guess
---
I've been playing just ingame for about 260 hours and I just got my first black ice yesterday, on the SG-CQB.
---
Their whole report system needs an upgrade like this. Toxicity is way too broad which might be why reporting never works.
---
nah mate it's pretty pathetic how you can't give a good argument as to why diamonds should be barred from casual, like lmao, just practice and grind and be a diamond yourself and then you'll defeat them. Also if you want renown, go play terrorist hunt with a friend or find a five stack using discord or communities on ps4, resorting to name calling won't get you anything you want.
---
Break the soft wall?
---
Makes the most sense
---
And i got banned
---
Ash is flat as the floor
---
Wut?
---
Yeah but most of the vote kicks are just for you not clutching a 1v3 because the rest of your team died to a spawn peaking magnum doc but no the loss was your fault not theirs
---
Fmg9 and smg11 kit here. Kapkan kit and pulse kit too
---
Morons like you are the plague of every forum ever.
---
Just click harder, ez.
---
*E*
---
let analyze while smoke passed glaz , caveira was distracting him and ash was turning away. When smoke was defusing the defuser, ash got distracted by downed caveira and went passed smoke. This maybe casual or broze ranked match.
---
Make sense
---
So you pose the question "what can they lose"
---
And then you comment "i just want to have fun in Casual, farming renown".
---
Have you ever considered if this is what they want too? Having fun and getting rewarded sounds good to me.

Same for defenders checking cams, I have a video on yacht of me doing exactly this except to a Doc laying down by the craps table. I see your flair, I see you tho

Dude in your other post you wrote that your aim isn't good. Now I know why.

Angled grip is never good imo.
---
I‚Äôm level 97, I have no black ice...
---
What fov is that
---
420 credits nice
---
It shouldn't be that bad, one of my friends lives in Japan it doesn't affect him much
---
I use it on zofia, IQ, thermite and Dokkaebi on attack, especially if I'm gonna be in medium range gunfights, I can't use it on hibana, even with an angled grip the recoil on her assault rifle is really bad
---
That's insane if that's the case.
---
Hmm good question - I bought the special edition that was on sale in the Xbox store and it came with a ‚ÄòYear 1 Operators pack‚Äô. Could that be why? Do some people see that as cheating? 
---
I‚Äôm happy to uninstall that part if so - wasn‚Äôt aware it was a thing that people got upset about!
---
I need to go have a shower now because of how filthy that play was

Just a suggestion but you should probably put an acog on rook

?

Bruh. I came back to the game after months and months. 3rd game played I got 2 kills and  me and teammate are shooting same guy. He is premade with 1 more person as they talked in team chat. I get the 3rd kill of the round and immediately get kicked. He didnt get the kill and that's was enough of a reason to kick. Dont cry and queue for another game, same like I did :D who gives a fuck. Play casual
---
You must be hard of vision

Youll learn eventually

How do you play with that

if you know how to control recoil good then you should always go with angled
---
the azzwipe version
---
When the drones rise up, echo just gets fucking thrown into the ceiling
---
What platform?
---
&gt;I used to play CoD and Battlefield.
---
Wow. Didn't see that one coming. /s
---
You do realize that these posts let us console players appear like idiots that don't know how our controls work properly.
---
I don't think that's the issue. You see unfortunately R6's community is "toxic" (not everyone is toxic of course) and some people play together to throw and tk random people they found in-game and to be honest that's sad a cringey tbh. I found it cringey how some people have to tk a random person online because they don't have a life.

Smonk is DONE

You're both dumb

your fault for not expecting it, you should ALWAYS expect things in siege and getting used to it

Ubishit is running some shitty servers, remember when they said they bought some server hosting company ? they fucking lied

Thank you, appreciate it

Yes! Love this style!

The lord skin works as well

Semi for weak but spammable shots and pump for more a powerful shot yet slower rate of fire
---
He said he was putting it on reddit so I did it for him swear to god
---
But yes 1v1 is a waste of time. Next time, ignore anybody who asks for it.
---
Yeah I know that's what I said. This particular clip is easier if everyone has worse aim.
---
More the Kennedy killer from that angle.
---
Funny enough, it seems reddit doesnt want me to submit it. Sees its not beneficial for the community.... what a joke.  Ubi is trying to hide all their lies and weaknesses. If you have more info about the player and the link send me plz via chat, ill keep track of the player.

I usually place gold 1 and a couple of wins from plat. But this season we have been goofing around in silver because we're bored of the usually stale ranked. Last week of the season I'd reset and get plat.

playing against coppers be like

You go to customs and switch the server it‚Äôs on and then play a match, then you do it again after each match

You will put me for that on r/facepalm right?

In this situation, you're part of the problem with the Siege community, regardless of right or wrong.

I'm like rank 160ish 170? idk bc I never paid attention. Is there a reason it matters?

The pump action was used for different specialty rounds that didn't have enough power to cycle the semi-auto capacity, typically non-lethals such as beanbag rounds iirc. Only thing I could think to make this viable is to allow the pump action to be used for slower rate of fire, but less muzzle climb
---
I bought it back in year one and I regretted buying it ever since. It looks like crumpled tinfoil. You're better off buying the seasonal skins
---
i have a new profession: Getting ashamed for another person

It hurts

Ill carry you, where does yous wants to go?
---
I literally just had a match where *EVERYONE* was roaming expect me and when I die because the enemy team is smart, they decide that loosing was my fault and tried to boot me for it.
---
You're a mouse and keyboard user and it's obvious. Get off console.

Siege is hitscan, there's no bullet travel time

it's called spawn peaking my guy, it takes a good amount of map knowledge

Oh look. Another angry expert programmer that knows how to fix a problem but won‚Äôt tell anyone. Oh... wait no you have 0 idea how to fix the problem and most likely don‚Äôt even understand the complexity of in the first place

Dude she legit looks like a milk dud w/ an angry face stitched on

The recoil was bouncing your bullets up. That's why it looks like you were hitting him.

Well 3 of my normal squad are gay so we're pretty close üòÇ
---
My 3k hours remembers when all glaz's flip sight did was give you a red filter. His hit reg has been ass since they gave him the first iteration of his thermal.
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
Black ice was one of the first seasonal weapon skins 
---
So it's pretty rare nowadays 
---
I think that's why people get so exited 
---
Plus it's just one of the best skins out there tbh.
---
On the new maps this kind of spawnpeeking doesn't exsist. It's only on the old ones that you'll get shot in the first 3 seconds. 
---
Spawnpeeking is cancer
---
ok ive got a good one 
---
if you shoot me your a furry
---
This post is extremely autistic.
---
Ouhf... I am neither angry nor I claimed to be an expert. 
---
It‚Äòs not my job to create code snippets or something like this. Even that‚Äòs something that no game developer team ever want to recourse to. So I don‚Äòt have to understand the incomprehensible ‚Äûcomplexity‚Äú.  As part of the community - and even it is just a small part - I feel to highlight this topic to push it in the right spotlight. Everything that get a lot of attention can become a top issue/community concern.
---
Anyway.. thanks for your productive comment.
---
Totally agree.
---
So hilarious when people constantly post this acog meme on random threads, completely unrelated to acog.
---
Look at the cute little hoplophobe.
---
Wow they banned three of your mains? Nobody gives a shit this isn't your diary.
---
Well done
---
Idk if this is a coincedence or not but this happened to me as well, while playing Fuze, with the AK-12...
---
Yeah this was just a game i left going for awhile to see how long it got
---
But that's not what this discussion is, you're completely deviating from the point. Point is: MnK users are rampant on console and ruining the game. Your reply? That it... should be used because it can be....? Oh wait no, changing your argument to defend the disabled players whom I completely think no one in this thread would have a problem with using MnK on console if that's what they absolutely have to do, would prefer said people to come to PC but that's whatever, irrelevant. You've brought no solid justification to this whole thread.
---
What they didn‚Äôt know was that the salt monster was inside them all along, waiting for the moment to come out in a blaze of fury and butt hole clenchiness.
---
If you die to Ela shotgun:
---
Uninstall
---
A 10 round .50 Bae mag is a 30 round 5.56 magazine.
---
If your logic can be argued, then it isnt as absolute as you believe. If a third party adapter exist to make that modification on console, then it can and will be used.
---
Its not ruining anything, players just dont want to deal but that wont change anything.
---
The mnk problem has been spoken about and they have said it is cheating. Not much more can be said. 
---
As for the others maybe they should but I know that they are working on improving this game. At the end of the day they are not making it bad on purpose.
---
That timing though when he reset his phone and the second he did, the other team planted the defuser.
---
LMAO
---
Oh ok that makes sense. I do like how it looks alot. I have two legendaries, some red one and a blue one that look meh. But Black Ice looks so slick. Thanks for the answer!
---
You forgot the video
---
Normally, when the server is told by a client "I'm now here" the server checks to see if the move makes sense. If it doesn't, it tells the client to go back to the last reasonable position the server believes it should be. An example of this is if you're sprinting down a corridor and experience a 3 second disconnect, the server, not being updated on your position, assumes you're stationary. Then, when the disconnect is complete, the server sees the client say that they moved a way larger distance than makes sense in one go, so it rubberbands you back to where you were.
---
When you tell the server that you're vaulting, the server checks if you can vault where you are, but seems to ignore the end position (i.e. it doesn't check if your movement makes sense). Back in the day, TP hackers had to ALWAYS vault before they could teleport so that they didn't get rubberbanded.
---
Now, although it is unknown, it's likely that the fly and clipping cheats are literally just ignoring the fact that the server is telling them to rubberband and the server isn't auto-kicking them for whatever reason. Another possibility is that there is a server functionality that is being exploited so that the server thinks the erroneous movement is valid. 
---
Without the source or the documentation for Siege servers or the current cheats, there's no way to know for sure.
---
But that isnt the point, we're not going "oh lord how are they using this MnK BlAcK mAgIc" I know it can and will be used. That's literally the problem, I dont see what you're trying to argue. Like I said, don't mistake "can be" and "should be"
---
Because people can't accept what the word ''seasonal'' and ''time limited'' mean.
---
Damn, did you realize how shitty your argument was? If there is official support for KB&amp;M, it's fair play. It would be exactly like buying better equipment on PC, for example, higher refresh rate monitors.
---
try using rogue9's video on graphics ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEM\_gJVqj4Y&amp;t=168s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEM_gJVqj4Y&amp;t=168s) ) to optimize your graphical settings, should help reducing stutter.
---
Ah makes sense. I had heard someone say that they were the rarest but wasn't sure. Thanks for the answer!
---
No problem :)
---
Definitely got reported
---
I wish I was as good as you dude
---
It's a rare skin for Y1S1 ops and all OG ops. ^(Personally I don't like them but that's an unpopular opinion.)
---
Impressive for console tbh
---
There isn't official support for Keyboard and Mouse that's the point dumbass. You have to buy expensive modifications to trick your console into believing the Mouse is a controller.
---
I wish they were cookies, cookies would be more acceptable
---
Its more like "can be" and "WILL be".
---
It definitely is ruining things? Do you know how many posts I see *in a singular day* talking about this very problem? People are leaving in droves and its bad for the community. Your logic of "suck it up and deal with it because you can't do anything about it" is toxic.
---
You hate to see it.
---
I don't rage quit but goddamn I would here.
---
It‚Äôs more impressive cause it‚Äôs on console, nice shots OP
---
I made this mistake and it had cost me 1000s in fancy shmancy PC shit. I love it.
---
Turn messages to friends only.
---
It‚Äôs an awesome skin and kind of the community meme dream!
---
Unrelated, but does anyone know how to see all the skins you‚Äôve unlocked?
---
this happened to me the other day when i solo queued. but it was the other team that got kicked or left. it felt like the dirtiest win ive ever gotten. I reported everyone in my game, but is there any way to tell who specifically is attacking the servers?
---
No shit, you're literally not even talking about the same thing as us anymore. We know it WILL BE used. It current is BEING USED. That is kinda... the whole point and problem of this thread, that it SHOULDN'T be used and SHOULD be stopped
---
Geez. The title of the post in addition to playing recrut and ''tryhard'' in casual lets me assume you are under 16 and not legally allowed to play the game.
---
Also mentioning that you played flawless in casual makes you an idiot. Ahh and nobody cares, I just wanted to tell you that you seem like a 12 year old to me...14 max....
---
Isn‚Äôt mmr return a feature now, I saw king George praising it
---
But it wont.
---
Add him as friend, if you switch to Uplay you should see his Username in the bar on the bottom. Report him after that.
---
funny you count afk and queue times as dedication
---
When‚Äôs the next console patch expected? The server disconnects, ranked rejoining, DDOS attacks, sound issues, etc. Are getting old..
---
Oops sorry didn‚Äôt see you were a mod, thought you were a dev :)
---
That's true but they could be like "we are still speaking with Sony, looking for solutions". As far as I'm concerned, there is no effort being made to fix it.
---
For me, there's more of a clear effort put into PC and the pro scene, console is way at the bottom of their list. They make a fortune from this game and it's pro scene so they could show us some more love.
---
There's kbm support officially for writing stuff. That's a great thing and all but then there's people who use custom kbm's that tricks the console into thinking they're using a controller. This leads to a serious skill disparity because it's way easier to play with a kbm than a controller. The licensed kbms don't do this.
---
Somebody must have just died.
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily the hipfire headshots which is the issue, it‚Äôs the body shots which get chained in quick succession which at the moment are really easy to do.
---
As playing Xbox for a very long time, you can‚Äôt run away from toxicity. But ranked will be a 80% chance you‚Äôll get a good team. The 20% will be toxic team killers and people who purposely lose the match. Casual is OK sometimes.
---
I might get ddos 1 in about maybe 25-30 games but I‚Äôm not diamond but the point I was trying to get at was there no hackers
---
Big brain play
---
Same tbh
---
Yesterday in themepark in drug lab, i was monty and meleed someone through the tank, with only half their body showing.  They were like . a meter away from me.

If you are trying to play T hunt change it to lone wolf, and if the bombers are too hard for you, play extract hostage on outback, then there will be no bombers and no rooms full of C4.
---
You really don‚Äôt understand what makes him good clearly.
---
Felt the same way buddy
---
You probably got that MMR during your placements but went down afterwards.
---
XD
---
Not everyone. Casual is a weird mix of players, definitely some smurfs, low Silvers and Golds who try way too hard and need to go back to ranked, new players still getting their bearings, and people who are just there to have fun and goof around. I try to be and play with only the last category myself, so just stick with it, make some fun friends, and don't sweat it if you meet some pricks in casual- not everyone is bad.
---
Toxic.
---
bullets.exe has stopped working
---
Cav wins yay (in my mind)
---
Dude. It‚Äôs not even out yet. Chill
---
Console? Or pc?
---
If Console probably Ddos
---
The one that survived is prolly like ‚Äú bring me han solo‚Äù
---
Those look super dope
---
Yeah because you should totally be allowed to kill the hostage
---
I just hit lvl 100 on my third account and it still feels good every time
---
And people wonder why I play casual
---
I thought she was based off the Nordic frogmen?
---
Or the diamonds and plats
---
She‚Äôs not that‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs just when she‚Äôs harassing you it‚Äôs annoying
---
Plus they good ops
---
Accurate.
---
Blitz smashing through the wall like OH YEAH!
---
Cheers, will do.
---
That‚Äôs not that bad, some people hit like level 200 and don‚Äôt have one, some people like me are at 150 and have like 10-13 of them. It‚Äôs all RNG.
---
Meanwhile: Literally everyone else...
---
Firstly, it's yellow, meaning its not severe, also that indicator is latency/packet loss, in which case, I get a lot, but he would have froze. At the end while typing he got it because i believe the game was processing the replay, his death, the next screen after replay, And typing, so maybe it was  a lot for the game to take in after processing that shitshow of a play...
---
You can‚Äòt smurf in casual as that matchmaking depends heavily on k/d. You can only smurf in ranked, in casual you just have the problem of getting matched against much better players. But they don‚Äòt actively play in lower lobbies as they should, like a smurf.
---
Why do they tease us by giving IQ the 1911 again
---
Does it come with a heart beat sensor?
---
Yes on console. My friend said they didnt get kicked.
---
I feel like you know some things that we don't...
---
If you find it please reply to this comment I want to see it
---
I‚Äôve been wondering why there is such a boost in people playing capita≈ç now I know why
---
Sure
---
Hes my top operator so that's gotta count for something
---
I agree üòÇ
---
Put on your best Waldo cosplay
---
wowoowowowoow is this a something like new DLC to Siege?
---
I just wish you could stack on a shield like that. And servers worked, I forgot about the servers.
---
Yeah there was a guy doing a tv show I think called "voyagers", he was playing with the prop gun that had blanks, pretended to shoot himself, and held it to his temple. Killed himself while pretending to kill himself
---
If u aced, THEN it's solo
---
This is why I haven‚Äôt played this game in over 6 months and will continue not to.
---
Well the jackal nerf was correct, we hate having chained scans for 2 minutes straight, less pings means less time scanned 
---
But yeah the echo nerf is completely off the mark and won‚Äôt affect him whatsoever
---
Yeah those too, but I see golds and silvers a lot more being problems or tryhards, interestingly. It's like they have a chip on their shoulder, diamonds and plats in casual seem to do it just so they can goof around and not to stomp on lower tier players imo
---
It really doesn‚Äôt. Mav isn‚Äôt good cuz he can make a silent kill hole, he‚Äôs good because he can take control over any reinforcements he wants, and make a bunch of holes to keep defenders away from it. The silent holes only work against bad players.
---
Welcome to the world of dicks ruing games for fun
---
All 3 attackers, on an incredibly peek-heavy map, left cover sprinting and not even watching one of the most common peeks in the game. This is not a new map, and it certainly isn‚Äôt a new strategy. If you don‚Äôt want to get killed early round, maybe smarten up and stop blaming others for using an intended mechanic of the game.
---
Echo just needs to be reverted to having a single Yokai, again. I always knew giving him 2 was broken, especially when the rest of the defenders can use it as an "invisible" camera.  
---
Jackal is a little more difficult because you don't want him to become irrelevant. His win delta is already low. Change defenders' footprints to last a minute, instead of 1.5 minutes. If that's not enough, make it 2 scans, instead of 3.  
---
Boom. Fixed.
---
Denmarks special ops ‚ÄúFrogmen‚Äù, their uniform is based off the Danish monster N√∏kk
---
No he is a bandit trick counter and mute counter to replace thatcher, and he can use the holes to kill people as well. But I use him mostly as a bandit trick counter
---
You=Mira
---
Makes sense
---
No you don't entitled prick
---
I was kind of pushing it, since technically mozzie counters everyone, knowing where the enemy is always helps, but leaving your drones in your roaming route can help you locate where he tracked you from, if not, you can always drive around to find him without risking a teammate
---
No, Rook plates only guarantee that you get downed (if it wasnt a headshot). You can't get downed, picked up, pick up a new plate, and get downed again.
---
Stay strong shield brother, our time will come
---
Well, that was a general nerf to all SMG's, not just hers. Would be unfair for the 12 to get a recoil buff, and not the 11 or the SPMG.
---
Right on! Sounds good man, appreciate it. I‚Äôll hit you up if I end up getting it.
---
Big facts
---
Lore. Each gadget use is money. Why would they use those in training, but not set up a spotlight to shine at the building?
---
Haha, sorry that was my mistake this morning. It was early for me and i didn't think it all the way through.
---
Dear lord they are ugly.
---
Who else noticed that bandit is in both left and right side lol?
---
Idk man that joke gets kinda old now....
---
Did they remove that?
---
But what if it‚Äôs 4 man group then that kid probably gonna leave
---
The only problem I have is the smg 12 on console has insane recoil, but Dokkaebi has the dmr for long range and the smg for close range
---
honestly if youre in a stack and you kill a solo guy, you and the rest of your stack should get reverse friendly fire enabled. This shit happens in casual too with monkeys just trying to ruin the game for everyone
---
I love Mozzie a lot, Im usually an anchor, and Mozzie can be used as both anchor or roamer/lurker
---
‚ÄúBoba Fett?! Where?!‚Äù
---
I just ignore these types of guys most of the time if I get them. If they get to me, I just kinda get angry and keep it in my head. Maybe fire back insults but I try not to be toxic. Cuz there's always,"toxic kid" or "kid gets angry/sad". Sure I'm not on console but it still happens.
---
Imagine not having any arguments and downvoting something you know is true lmao.
---
A girl that plays siege that's 14? Why the hell does matchmaking keep things away from me
---
I would say Zofia if you want an attacker she has a great primary gadget and her weapons are amazing, but if you want a defender get Lesion his primary gadget is really really good even if you are solo queuing his primary weapon is also one of my favorites!
---
DDoS and MnK cheaters will not get punished at least not for a long time. TP hackers' accounts don't have much longevity.
---
Also, TP hackers are way less annoying because they get it over and done with. MnK players are slow and trash and DDoS cheaters do the same.
---
Thatcher and twitch also counter lesion
---
We both know that's bullshit it's not like I'm losing every game or anything I just don't pay so I can fuck people up because I don't think that's fun personally
---
Sure !
---
It used to, it doesn't anymore
---
i dont like you
---
&gt;the recoil is worst on console 
---
No it‚Äôs better, it‚Äôs just harder to control with a controller. Pc recoil is far worse but it‚Äôs easier to control with a mouse.
---
If you put a pc player with a mouse and keyboard on console he will have much better control and will have a massive advantage over the controller players. Even with less game knowledge or skill you can dominate console servers with a mouse. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so frustrating the ubi can‚Äôt do anything to fix it
---
Because you need space and time to set up those in a real situation which most of the time you don't have. Gadget aren't time consuming, and easy to bring on mission.
---
If you are fine with rushing with a 2 speed I'd say Finka, she has the Lmg that we have all become accustom to, as well as the Sasg shotgun which is perfect for rushing when you use her ability, add in Grenades and her health boost, perfect.
---
But iq got her gadget.
---
I'm not even gonna argue before it gets even more toxic. Also,using a semicolon(;) makes more sense than using a comma after saying my grammar is horrible. /_/
---
Thatcher almost for lesion and twitch drone
---
I had an argument though? It's kind of pay to win but not to the level where you have to pay in order to get everything
---
Twitch does, you are correct. Im not sure hat thatcher does work? That‚Äôs new to me
---
Is being rude to a kid good? Nah.
---
Does not mean the Kid shouldn't grow thicker skin.
---
Does not mean the parents are not semi responsible for him playing this game and being on the internet.
---
True
---
Young Kaid
---
i just stopped playing siege it was horrible i got ddosed in casual and ranked and constantly teamkilled and vote kicked by a four stack ive only had 3 games where nothing went wrong and that was with a full squad im just done with siege
---
i know this a joke, but why don't you just disable "open when turning on PC"
---
Can someone explain what happened? I don‚Äôt get what the bug is.
---
The ones that do have them destroyed by Twitch drones... I have witnessed it and watched the stare off afterward... It was glorious
---
*screams in DL-44*
---
Lots of vids on YouTube of diamond level players showing their key bindings
---
actually i was thinking this represented the glitch where you would see the op holding their gadget but they're actually holding their gun thing (ive died to that so many times to it... i see oh, he's holding a gadget, i'll take my time to line up a headshot -bang im dead-
---
Okay so that's not arguing anything. I said it's pay to win.
---
&gt; At least it's much harder to control
---
Yea, that's what I said.
---
I always spawn there as Montagne. Just protect the teammates.
---
Mnk 
---
Fps strike mod pack
---
DDosers
---
Boosters with copper accounts
---
Nacons with macros
---
The list goes on and on
---
Hell yeah, rook. Fuck that jaeger main
---
Ha ha lol
---
He could just get a 4 man group of his own? Or hell even  just another person would alleviate the issue.
---
This is not a 12+ game, let's not hand hold and babysit.
---
Thx ive already made my mind tho 
---
I‚Äôm getting Mira as I‚Äôm getting R6 credits
---
So I can get Mozzie from them.
---
Thx tho.
---
Most of the time I have a good experience with the game
---
Word.
---
I think she's just fine.  Great gadget (I find her much more of a problem than Jackal) and solid loadout.  So long as you are decent with semi-auto, the MK-14 is solid for long range.  And you switch to her secondary for close range.  They are both beasts--great TTK and high recoil.  She has a gap at mid range, but overall she's in a pretty good spot.  Closer to OP than in need of a buff.

I'm using 1200 DPI personally.  In my experience the reason low DPI levels are talked highly of is bc it gives you more precision and control at the cost of more mouse and arm movement.  While pros may practice on 800 DPI it doesn't mean everyone has to, I find I'm comfortable with my 1200 DPI and 11 horizontal and vertical sensitivity in game.  
---
Something people don't think about: just bc pros do it, doesn't mean its the best style for you personally to pratice :)
---
You don't even read your own screenshot "I can't wait for the to make etc" that literally means nothing that means they would love to see it
---
Shouldn't. Even if you don't consider that vigil's is a camera hacker and not a foot print hiding device, vigil doesn't need any buffs, and an op like jackal who was nerfed despite having a low win delta and high pick rate doesn't need a Nerf either.
---
I don‚Äôt get how people think that‚Äôs fun, what makes a competitive game fun is winning knowing you had a level playing field and you won because of higher skill than the opponents. Hacking is literally pointless in every aspect

I think about a year or so ago

You can blame Blitz for that

What is your audio setup? Headset type. is it 7.1 surround or stereo etc (I find I had to disable surround sound on my headset to correct audio issues as the game is coded in stereo and not 7.1 compatible)
---
If you remember when the box art had none of the original operators, you deserve a veteran's pass.
---
Holy shit I didn‚Äôt realize they changed it. When I looked it up the cover was changed a long ass time ago. I remember back when the cover art was just those terrorist boyos on the right and recruits on the left
---
Unless you want to be a dummy and take the risk of roaming with an op who's effectiveness only increases as time progresses, I wouldn't make the mistake of roaming with lesion. Viggy can roam Because he can take the risk. Lesion can't.

Lmao these guys must be really low level.

The clips all fine and dandy until that weird turn at the end which heavily resembles a mouse and keyboard. Good play none the less

I believe 1/3 of people downvote/upvote accordingly  (see a downvote = downvote, vice versa), a small few downvote based on it being slightly off-topic, and the majority just disagreeing with me and seeing my post and downvotes as me advocating *for* spawnpeeking when I'm simply pointing out its presence and how to avoid it.

There‚Äôs a difference between sub-optimal and unrealistic. You train for bad things to happen, but you don‚Äôt train in an entirely different situation. In what situation would every single piece of support be knocked out. If you‚Äôre operating behind enemy lines then it should be that hard to neutralize anyone in the area, because Team Rainbow is an international organization, and I think most super powers would not want terrorism to happen. By having to personally clear out every single part of the map in your ‚Äúsuboptimal‚Äù situation, you‚Äôre just training them to waste time, when they don‚Äôt have to.
---
It‚Äôs alright, it‚Äôs a great investment!
---
... have you played recently ? MM, especially in ranked is a joke, and hit reg is still all over the place. add to that the LOS issues.
---
I'm surprised BB is so low, though that could be due to new operators that provide more utility.
---
Wrist.
---
Your wrist muscles aren't designed for excessive computer usage where the entire load while working is on your wrist muscles. As a result, the wrist muscles get numb and eventually, in the most casual scenario, die, and would have to be pulled out.
---
Higher dpi ensures that you use your arm to move, so your wrist muscles don't take the load but your arm does, which comfortably can.

I may be the only glaz main in plat but when mr. Contoller god thinks he can get a free kill he becomes the free kill
---
My ping has been in the negative trillions for over a month. I've tried a new PC/new IP address/new modem/new router. Nothing seems to work, it's terrible.  
---
I've seen a few other people experience this in the last couple of weeks, nobody has any clue of a fix and Ubi support also doesn't know why this is happening.
---
Is anyone else experiencing this? Any info would be HUGE.
---
Ive been playing since launch with no change :P  Sennheiser 598s into a amp/dac , no 7.1.  played last night and aside from the usual audio crap, nothing. today its like even 40 feet away they sound like theyre right beside me.
---
Happy Beaulo Day everyone
---
My first was the FMG-9 too, still waiting on any others though, sadly
---
I don‚Äôt get those messages on PS4 since I have messages set to friends only but I could imagine I would be getting some of those. The best comparable feeling I can get to this is shutting down a Ash/Finka rush. They think they can just run in  and get kills like its COD but little do they know it requires more brain then aim to win at this game. Take my upvote lol.
---
"Your coach" you just proved my point smh
---
I can't tell, is this cosplay or the real Lion?
---
Because this is art that came out before the game came out? Is that too hard for your common sense to compute?
---
&gt;That's fucked.
---
Obviously your aim just sucks and you need to get better /s
---
How is he too silent, you can clearly he his torch start up and the steel melting.
---
Check my recent post. They can stop you from planting, keep the servers hit while in set up phase so they can rush you with no defenses ready, and they can start individually booting people so it'd be like 2v5 with no reinforcing or traps set up. It's bullshit.
---
Thank god Im bronze.
---
Didn‚Äôt know dead by daylight had new nurse skin of ela
---
I closed the discord now and start the game but still the same
---
EXACTLY. You would then save that 1 second of planting animation.
---
Bad idea, OP. Bad idea.
---
that is fixed i think, its a different thing this time
---
Obviously there isn't, but your understanding of competitive shooters is clearly shallow
---
I like how u deliberately shot the hostage
---
Yay, fuck shields
---
^ exactly
---
must be red
---
YUP
---
I dunno, I find Warden works well alongside a Jager because he cancels out the enemy over-confidence once they burn the ADS devices....sprint in and spam flashes then...but warden! Dead!
---
Lol
---
But in most situations you don‚Äôt have a set time and you have more room to work (no out of bounds, I‚Äôm not saying I want no out of bounds.)
---
You should have other operators buy the time you reach level 30.
---
Just leave the game
---
oh dear. sorry man, defo patch so. At least we know it is not any other messy variable
---
But what if you don‚Äôt buy the operators and just keep playing recruit
---
Nothin‚Äô personal kid
---
What system?
---
I‚Äôve always loved that picture idrk why tho
---
Isn't a snowflake someone who is easily offended?
---
Sounds  like our   time has just  ended,  because    people are 
---
 annoyed  by  any   operator they   can't just brute force.
---
Pc
---
Who cares if he's cheating against other players? Do you know how stupid you sound right now?
---
Drowning in drones
---
How lol? Telling someone 1/10 ‚Äúraise your hips a little‚Äù isn‚Äôt doing them wrong every time
---
As I see more and more of these post I regret taking a break during DL and OpH
---
Just imagine sitting in the obj and suddenly the wall bursts open and blitz is stood there like "choo choo motherfucker"
---
Sorry I'm PS4.
---
No
---
That's some r/AccidentalRenaissance material. 
---
(Not so accidental tho)
---
REAL G4M3RS only play with less than 5ms smh you filthy casuals ruin this game /s
---
You will be recruit.
---
10 questions science still can‚Äôt answer
---
So just because I'm diamond I can't chill and relax on some casual games?  Bullshit.
---
Oof
---
Also to add to the report you'll be refunded lost MMr
---
I  remember when   like  2  or 3  years ago in  a Q&amp;A   they said that  the  shields are  currently   absolutely   broken   and  they  are not  going to  release  any n  ew  shield  operators  until their  issues  are  resolved.  A  couple  of   years and   one new   shield operator  later,   nothing has   changed  other  than  the   fact that  your  pistol  might   as   well  headshot    the teammate  standing  behind  you.
---
Yeah just pick a shotgun next round of you know what I mean...
---
Nice try, ATF
---
Queue times are fine for me, it was awful year 1 in compariosn. Hit reg is much better compared to what it was pre op health imo.
---
Being  a  good player doesn't make  him a good  game designer.
---
The thing is I have Siege on both PS4 and pc but my friends were all on PS4 so I didn't really put the time in on PC. Lately I have barely touched my PS4 and mostly been playing PC games so my ps gold is also done good time to start improving on PC with my boy J√§ger.
---
Hibana nice for hard breech, also maverick with torch and weapons combo, buck with his shotgun breech for boards or light walls, takes awhile to get use to it but jackal is fun
---
After playing Siege for so long honestly, I‚Äôve turned off AA on most of the FPSes I play. I‚Äôm more consistent and such and it‚Äôs a godsend.
---
What's the big problem with leaving?
---
CaPiTaO iS wOrSt AtTaCkEr
---
Cav can counter jackal that doesnt make any sense either, also the win delta for jackal doesnt makes any sense its not like his a weak op great guns and gadget it honestly has to be the ppl who play him/ teammates.
---
since the patch whenever i start a t-hunt my game crashes
---
Nah he's just had a balanced breakfast
---
\#NotMyBoxart

Since I got game at launch and this is the revised visual for the Advanced edition they did in year 3 (Operation Chimera)
---
Someone in the party was looking at IG. Didn‚Äôt take the time to mute him
---
I guess this is not as important as "EcksDee Tachanka Lord, meme, gib upvote"
---
&gt; Now, although it is unknown, it's likely that the fly and clipping cheats are literally just ignoring the fact that the server is telling them to rubberband and the server isn't auto-kicking them for whatever reason. Another possibility is that there is a server functionality that is being exploited so that the server thinks the erroneous movement is valid.
---
That doesn‚Äôt really make sense. Sure, a client can ignore an instruction, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that their ignorance can continue to ignore their player state.
---
‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm at D2. I go north.‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúYou cannot go north because there is a wall. You stay at D2.‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúYES I CAN I WENT NORTH. Now there‚Äôs an enemy at C1 so I knife to my west!‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúOk, you knife west. But you are still at D2, so your knife hits no one at C2.‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúYES IT DID IT HIT HIM.‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúNo, I am always the only one who decides when an attack hit. You only get to tell me which direction your knife was swung. *I* tell *you* (and everyone else) if you hit.‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúBUT I‚ÄôM AT C2‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúI decide what your position actually is. You can trick your own visibility, but that doesn‚Äôt change my own records, which clearly show you at D2 running into a wall.‚Äù
---
Ultimately this seems like there‚Äôs a mistake in the server coding if it‚Äôs allowing that movement.
---
Just noticed Jager wears jeans
---
Meats coming out
---
Somebody should volunteer to test this.

The role    being  the Tachanka  of   offence?

New leaked spawn peaking couter

why was maverick nerfed, his power was alright, these people just dont know how to listen

Ohhhh, I feel like a dumbass now. Thank you!

where on the hatch is it

Ahhhhh I remember those PUBG maintenance duration.

1-hour maintenance you say? That means it'll be a 2-hour maintenance.

You guys were playing siege, he was playing SUPERHOT.

With a controller too. Damn

**"I call it luck."**

Nothing can ever be done about it, calling people out means nothing when half of the community on console does it lol, do you know how stupid you sound? I‚Äôve heard literally 90% of diamond ranking players on console use it, there‚Äôs no point calling out some random guy and r6tabbing him (lmao) when it means nothing
---
I'm on it

I‚Äôm level 328 and have 1600-800 hours, what have been doing?

Speaking as a former console (PS4) player for the past 3 years.....I prefer teleporting cheats on PC because they are so blatant that you know they will actually get banned. Console MnK don't banned....so nah, I'd rather face obvious cheater dipshits that can actually be banned than face MnK console scum who will face no consequences for their degeneracy
---
Well, i do get bored and analyze behaviors by, within legal means, tracking behaviors of people i meet online piecing together patterns and constants from several "subjects". Reddit logs help piece a lot but due to ability to have multiple accounts it can hit a wall if comments are not too close, but if they are daily possibly if it is a secondary it is how they hide their hidden nature from people they don't want to disappoint.  
---
The idea i have is that due to no direct "natural empathy triggers" which are body language or vocal cues the mind can not find a reason to desire to empathise because they tend to see them as NPCs until they are in the same room seeing the frustration and playing a direct part in causing and attempt to calm the frustration they caused. Missing the physical cues as stated above unless trained to empathize with the pixels. 
---
But that is one theory from someone who never studied sociology or psychology,  just someone who gets bored and does things that normal people wouldn't do to pass the time?
---
The guy who jumped down didn't have headphones  or it was his first game of siege

Use to just be recruits

Mira‚Äôs gun is insane if you control the recoil
---
Report him

What the actual fuck
---
Finally a console clip with an actuall big play. GJ mah man
---
also people who call everything toxic
---
Haha yeah it kinda is
---
Well they can't anchor because incoming fire has a 1% chance to ignore the shield.
---
They can't push because they can't hipfire effectively.
---
They can't rush because they're gonna trade a death for a DBNO.
---
So who knows what they're actually supposed to do now?
---
they wrote in dev notes that they are trying to fix it
---
Holy shit that was good but still Fuck you. I'd be pissed
---
That is the nuttiest shots I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Thanks but I switched to PC because anytime I submitted PS4 screenshots or videos to Ubi support they replied with "use the report function in-game".
---
im pretty sure he‚Äôs using mnk
---
I did, but I feel like it does nothing.
---
This is why I'm looking forward to the mcc coming to pc
---
Oh really?! Who are you on PS4?
---
I‚Äôm interested
---
Do it while you can, this will probably be getting removed at some point in the near future. I can't tell you how many clutches i have 4-4 tense as shit, get clutched cause of echos drone, and purely because of pick and ban, he's probably gonna get the nerf hammer mid next season.
---
Oof, jackal main too lol.
---
Playing terrorist hunt is a good way to get used to maps and game mechanics. For operators I recommend getting sledge/Ash/doc/rook if you don't have those already. Rather beginner friendly
---
Blitz does too

I forgot the mission but for me it was when you played as IQ
---
your not the only one I've got the same problem too I completely uninstalled and reinstalled and now after restarting a load of times. nothing has changed I think its a problem with the new update as were not the only people experiencing the problem.
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs shoot and score, we have a drone‚Äù
---
I think even then, things like lag and desync could still result in common false positives.  I see this suggested in a lot of fps games and don't see it anywhere so i have to imagine either it would cost a huge amount of server power to constantly watch all players in a lobby and look for above max speed cap movement on a consistent basis, or is very difficult itself to program something to do that.
---
Mozzie only bathes in the blood of the drones that have fallen to him
---
Gotta love those moments when you say 'Guys I think they're gonna go inside' and you hear (Friendlies last operator remaining) just 5 seconds later
---
Or they could fix their fucking hitreg
---
Hold up there cow poke
---
Wait drones don't set off claymores?
---
That emoji makes me uncomfortable
---
Not until he hacks lions drone
---
Yeah. I have NEVER seen that before. I've had people take down the server to prevent a loss, but this was a new level of fuckery. They're evolving. I was more pissed that to get back to Plat I had to go 9-4-3 in the game before this and then went back to Gold because of this shit.
---
I think that would be great. If there is a trail it gives him a counter which is an ambush so you have to then worry about tracking.
---
Heck. Yes. I freaking love Glaz and basically gave up on using him after the nerf. Now I can get back to having him in my main rotation and tapping heads
---
I‚Äôve got the game on disc and he‚Äôs just bought the deluxe edition on the PS4, if either one of us accepts the game invite we are sent to the PS Store with R6 shown.
---
As a former Sledge main, no.
---
I don't spawnpeak with anyone because I'm not toxic
---
If you want to mnk just play pc? oh wait, then you'd be copper... my bad
---
Its cuz they only updated part of Kafe but everything on Hereford was changed
---
It looks realistic
---
Just make the hammer a boomerang that he can throw through windows and at people and it comes back
---
I swear they do. At least I think I‚Äôve gotten a kill like this... now I‚Äôm not so sure!
---
He was but that didn‚Äôt mean it was hard to kill him.
---
They both have lips? Alright no doubt about it.
---
üò≥
---
I mean a Kool-Aid guy breacher.

Just "IT'S FUCKING PARTY TIME, NERDS" through any non-reinforced wall.

Hi, Jager main here, the only time i spawn peak is if they do it first. And i run out side and say hi face to face.
---
1600hrs PVP and 800 Thunt?  Because I have 1200hrs PVP and 820 Thunt and im Level 377. The thing is that even though T-Hunt gives little renown nowadays it still gives a shit ton of XP.
---
You must be new here.
---
Lord Fibin and Interro are really good friends. They constantly diss each other out in the open, on interviews, the and on Twitter. They do it for the heck of it. Literally everybody, even those who hate G2, know that
---
To everyone who makes these type of posts... Squad up!

I liked him as he was before but after the nerf he was basically ruined completely

I'd give Gold for that insight if I wasn't poor. Thank you for that explanation and have a good day Frog. üòÑ

Try this Go to Settings on your PS4, Go to Account Management, and go to Restore license. Try that. Tell me if t works or not
---
Uninstall and reinstall?
---
The real question here is; Why in the hell did they push you one at a time. I will never understand some of the people that play this game. I don't care how kill hungry you are, don't push a shield one person at a time..you will lose 9/10 times
---
You don‚Äôt understand. Monty is overpowered. Just because some terrible player let you kill them doesn‚Äôt mean he is not op.
---
Nope, happens on PSN Plat'/Diamond matches; it's gotten far worse since Burnt Horizon for me, shit it's even leaking into mid-Gold too.
---
Woah dude you want to get this game banned in china or some shit this is too realistic and brutal even for me
---
I wish it were that easy. I have an erratic work schedule and I've tried making posts here to get people to play with. I try to party with people in game, but we go for a few rounds and then it drops off.

Diamond? I dont know about diamond. I mean my friends say they reach diamond, but ive never gotten it myself before. Thanks i guess? ..

This isn't true.  It will likely be close, however there are a ton of factors that affect this, especially if you change any of the multipliers in the ini file.

I didn't know this was a meme format now

Any news on the new deployable shields? Or are we gonna have to wait for next season to get those?

Fine, from an "outsider" POV, he should work on his "jokes" because they always seems mean-hearted.

Can somebody tell me how Lesions gadget is considered to be fair IF IT INVISIBLE.

How do you counter that w/o IQ?

Okay. I fot it figured out after a month and a half, still kinda new. You will get there. I learned maps by spawning in the same spot as attacker and entering in the same spot.

What
---
[Found it,](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjE3rgzD10Q/) thanks
---
Yeah, I thought he was fine. He was powerful but it was high risk high reward. Your team couldn‚Äôt really push up through the smoke in hallways and his gun has such a slow fire rate he was at a massive disadvantage in terms of headshot potential and panic-play. And he was hardly a part of the meta either. Finding a Glaz player was nearly as rare as finding a Tachanka player. It barely even happened
---
I heard a Mario "Yahooo!"

Not going to run it and be enjoyable since it uses intergrated graphics.

That‚Äôs big pp energy right there. Even bigger? Run into objective cooking a grenade. Suicide bomber style

Shields don't dbno yet...  are you from the future or something?

What do you play on?

Just saw a Jager do it
---
Legally speaking so far, no, the distribution of them isn't against any laws. That being said, Microsoft would ban these adapters if it weren't for the fact that they can't track them reliably yet as they've stated previously. Not only is it hardware that is not licensed or approved to be sold for use on their console, but they are creating their own system to support MnK anyway, as proven by their official Razer gear they are now releasing. I can't speak for Sony, but they've made a similar stance in the past as far as I'm aware.
---
As far as rules being broken, Ubisoft has stated MnK use on console is a ban-able offense on their servers, it's just a shame that the report functionality is so shit. Because Ubisoft can't technically ban those people, Microsoft and Sony have to. The communication pipeline is to cluttered to get a solid functioning ban system in place. On top of these instances, ESL has issued a rule that states MnK use is strictly prohibited at console events, with use of an adapter bringing a severe penalty to the player/team.
---
And can we please cut the argument that people who use MnK are just trying to have a more comfortable experience? Out of the people doing it, &gt;0.1% are doing it because it's more comfortable in the case of Siege. The adapter needed to use MnK is over $130 dollars, that isn't really a price a lot of people are willing to pay for just comfort, especially if you are talking about MnK. In fact, if they are more "comfortable" with MnK, they play on PC to begin with. There are so many arguments against comfort in that regard. The only time I've seen that as a good excuse was streamers playing BO4 Zombies. Purely co-operative, and they bought adapters so they could play the new maps the same as everyone else, cause they play on PC mainly, but we're forced to use their PS4's in order to play maps in the same release window.
---
Point is, if you are buying an adapter for console, more likely than not it's to gain a competitive advantage. Stop being apologetic towards people trying to "be more comfortable". That's a shit excuse and everybody knows it.
---
That's his point. See how everybody he tries to jocularly insult laughs it off? They know it, and that's how we too get to know that he's messing around.
---
I play on Xbox One
---
Bro i was in placement matches and i got ddosed

It isn‚Äôt funny though

That's tough man. I haven't even played a single placement this season because I've gotten so burnt out from this abuse over the last few seasons. Just not fun anymore, as much as I hate to say that.

Ah yes I learned how deal with Monty and how to counter him instead of complaining that he is op so it must be the person playing him thats terrible.
---
Well, I thought ass well that I will die from heat and lack of fresh air, BUT it's actually ok, i made grey parts in his "yellow plastic bag" from ventilated fabric and i guess that helps. Also, the mask is not a real Gasmask, so it's not sealed at all and i can breath normally
---
He hasn‚Äôt put stuff out in a long time but I love Cartoonz. He‚Äôs partners with Ubi and used to put out videos on R6 all the time- he‚Äôs got like 200 of them. Sadly he doesn‚Äôt play it much anymore, but he‚Äôs still my favorite.
---
It's a joke.  If you've ever watched WWE, you know that someone always plays the "heel," the guy everyone loves to hate.  Fabian plays that role, and yes, it is a role.  Before the interview, MZO and Milosh were joking that G2 winning was a win/lose because it was good for G2 but now they had to talk to Fabian.

Only if you care though, which you shouldn't. Just lighten up a bit, and enjoy life.
---
You can still get good in casual. But either way spawn peeking isn't the games problem, it's more ubisofts shitty ranking system.
---
Lol no
---
It‚Äôs me sam
---
Glaz is a sniper, use him. Would a SWAT or op run out in the open in real life when they know a building is full of armed forces trying to shoot them? No. But if you're getting spawn peaked thats what you're doing. If you get spawn peaked watch the kill cam and see where they got you from. It's all learning experience. I purposely drone out known spawn peaks instead of the objective. Ubi encourages spawn peaking and run outs as it is apart of the game. They've already re worked several maps to eliminate spawn rush outs, which is a nerf in itself. Watch some youtube videos of spawn peaks, if you have the knowledge of where they are - you can easily kill them or avoid them.
---
Damn console too
---
Yea a guess
---
Learning from your mistakes is important too. Good job!
---
Then be better at the game, at this point

I‚Äôd use it more if I wasn‚Äôt such a shit shot with dmr‚Äôs. So for my own sake I use the M4 lmao

I've played 1,500 hours, never once experienced or seen someone else complain about dosing before the last 2 months.. there's a reason all the Reddit complaints on it became so rampant this season specifically.

Nice, thanks for answering, looking forward to the next community challenge

Central FL internet, my friend. Spectrum.

How come the map was so dark? Almost every game someone complained about it

Tuxbird, he makes me cry with laughter from time to time or Beaulo because he‚Äôs so good at the game.
---
I never understand why people do this, like the most basic answer could be their a dick but like why? I'm complete trash and a bot at the game but am improving and god the rewarding headshots and shit are fun and keep me going, but just why this what do they gain? (Ps I dont play ranked, others shalt suffer for my botness)

Agreed

This also happens to me on PC.

Now I'm even more confused, Thatcher doesn't have the smg-11, I was talking about your secondary not the shotgun

no

Yeah but at least Nazi doctors PRETENDED they were doing a good thing, these guys are just assholes.

i find defense running out more annoying now. i think ranked needs to have a shorter reveal timer.
---
Lmao
---
That is a possibility.
---
Add me in the screen shot and blur my name
---
Jokes on them; I just leave and don‚Äôt care. Plenty of other rounds don‚Äôt have hackers . Oh and I don‚Äôt play ranked in any game anymore, so that helps a ton when there is nothing to be lost or gained; means people aren‚Äôt going to get mad in the first place for the most part. So it keeps the degenerate cheaters to ranked.

Go into t hunt and significantly increase your sensitivity and try to quickly 1 tap everyone on semi auto. When you go into ranked with your regular sens, you will be way more accurate
---
I might be thinking about smoke, but either way I just don‚Äôt really use sledge, we were mostly just meming around since it was 3-0
---
Pick the trap up after the prep phase then place it back down. Ez points for days
---
Facts
---
I don't play ranked either. It's not worth the frustration
---
why do those ranked sweats carry their toxicity over to casual
---
Bandit has a 1911, Thermite has a G-36, and IQ has a 5.7. 
---
Chief, something's wrong here
---
A part is different than the whole thing. Nerfing BB‚Äôs shield still left him with a shield. You‚Äôre talking about turning her into Defense Monty.
---
cRiKeY MaTe
---
Okay
---
Since when did bandit, blitz, and IQ have the M45 MEUSOC/1911?
---
That would be awful
---
wont I just be used to the other sens?
---
Hello creedthesinger, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cghzcu/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yea or have like a way that it messes with the screen and have fake sounds to cover up the real sounds of attacking
---
Smonk.
---
so just go around the shape of it?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what happened then, I don‚Äôt think it was ddosing if it was only you that disconnected
---
Windows defender or 3rd party anti-virus?
---
Even still, vaulting from a roof doesn‚Äôt make you go far on the X plane, only on the Y. So they can‚Äôt even use that as an excuse. There is no action in the game that can make you move that fast on the X plane.
---
Because that's the only time they can consistently get kills. Its sad.
---
Yep
---
If you get a teammate to come place a breach charge down then sledge can hot breach through the charge by hitting it with his hammer at the correct time
---
it depends...
---
while this is just whining.... I do agree that Ubisoft does the bare minimum as slowly as they can in this game
---
Ah okay, I used to run shotgun + smg-11 on sledge but I got black ice for his assault rifle, but on mute and smoke it's shotgun + smg-11 all day
---
ok cool!
---
Doc approves this comment
---
All of your arguments are just like the ‚Äújust click their heads‚Äù statements. There is a reason why every pro says he is overpowered, and there is a reason why he is banned so often. KingGeorge who is an ex pro player and  is very good at the game bans him every game no matter what, and has said on multiple occasions that he is the most broken op in the game. He literally has a YouTube video where he 1v5 against a team of hackers. 
---
I get you may think he is not that good at your rank, but in diamond and plat people know how to abuse his mechanics and get unfair advantages on you. You may think you are correct, but you undeniably incorrect about Monty.
---
Im level 116 and have 0.
---
but then you'd still need a teammate
---
If it makes you feel better it‚Äôs a shitty primary
---
PERFECT! I‚Äôll take 3 please!
---
It still hasn‚Äôt been addressed and that‚Äôs one issue I illustrated, I‚Äôm not asking for an immediate fix just acknowledging that and the other issues we have, I agree they try their best for PC I honestly do not feel the same can be said for console
---
Cause he's got multiple gu mines
---
Thats just not right
---
defense can run out, kill someone, and get back in before they get marked. its annoying.
---
And he needs multiple hits, or else it's too safe.
---
And then no one know what window it is and then get peeked
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy bro
---
Maybe just get gud, you scrub? You shoulda knifed him first
---
Not sure what spawn rushing is but if it‚Äôs a play style you can perform in this game, then it‚Äôs ok. Any strat that you have is ok besides cheating of course
---
Sure, suit yourself. But I hope you'll see the light some day.
---
No, siege is a low ttk competitive shooter, invulnerability has no place in such a game.
---
be honest, you based it off the first week, and didn't realize people only played for the alpha packs.  week 2 no alpha packs, no one cared.
---
ayy
---
I meant see it in game, because the BOSG is the ‚Äúmeme cannon‚Äù and no one uses it in any competitive climate üò¨.
---
Not very PC there...so I‚Äôm assuming they run off the same servers then? Kindly tone the asshole down about 30% this time if you would
---
Can we NOT add more ACOGs to the game? Am I the ONLY one that finds them incredibly stale and unfun, forcing people to play slow and boring? 
---
ACOGs absolutely ruin the pacing and balance of the game tbh.
---
Wait what, oh well, tk's should still not be rewarded, no matter if it's against cheaters or not,  because that encourages random tk's
---
I‚Äôm so glad I managed to get one headshot in
---
1. Shields are not broken at all, you wont get headshoted if you actually look at the guy and not straight forward. 
---
2. Who says the people who complain about rng are turning and running? Majority of the time, it's when you look at the shield he hipfires
---
3. Stop complaining about the hip fire nerf, its 100% fair and reasonable 
---
- Someone who think you are a salty Blitz main ;)
---
Like, how the fuck are people supposed to get better if they cant even play?
---
That‚Äôs because Gridlock took all of the food in Australia
---
Fucking Jojo memes.
---
I second that. Get_flanked helped me build my game sense quite a bit.
---
Everlasting climax
---
The game meta is already stale unless you play with holos. I have seen people literally sit afk watching an angle for 2 minutes, waiting for the one frag. 
---
IF you play with an ACOG you're literally just relying on your holo teammates to take site while you sit back and watch from the distance.
---
We appreciate it!
---
Why is it that I look at this and see a viable possible meme strat
---
Rookie numbers
---
I'd say most of the toxicity comes from Hostage games, cause as soon as I switched on the Hostage matchmaking setting, I got put into a game where I got TK'd, called a faggot, and kicked. Try and see if you can get him some people to play with as well, that usually gets rid of most of the toxicity.
---
Your arguments aren‚Äôt much better as they are ‚ÄúhE‚Äôs AnNoYiNg AnD uNfAiR‚Äù and ‚ÄúPRO LEAGUE PLAYERS SAID SO!‚Äù And constantly saying I‚Äôm wrong just for having a differing opinion. I did give you a list of good reasons of why he‚Äôs not overpowered but apparently you want to keep smacking nitro cells directly into his shield which doesn‚Äôt do anything so I guess I‚Äôm the idiotic one.
---
Smoke with ez 5k
---
Cuz I've been seeing free codes around and wanted to know if I could get one before spending money
---
Didn‚Äôt they nerf the animation for him putting his gadget on a wall back during Grim Sky?
---
I could have sworn it went from 2 seconds up to 3.5-4 seconds.
---
Get the Season Pass, it will be worth it more than the R6 Credits
---
Hello JoblessEclipse, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgiz16/corrupted_files/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Thank you so much for that.
---
I'll give it a try and see what happens!
---
I turned off hostage for him, he just plays secure and bomb and people dont give him a break
---
Sometimes you have to restart the game. I run into this issue all the time. Also if you sit on the main screen for so long the server sometimes bumps you off without saying so
---
You can't get it anymore, but it was during the April Fools Rainbow is Magic playlist time
---
Twitchs Elite give her drone a really sneaky camo
---
That's a Part 3 reference.
---
What is ddosing btw I've been playing for a few years now but have never had it happen and don't know what it is
---
I feel like it's more a case of the event got old really quick and it wasn't worth the grind playing it for a skin on a meme gun.
---
I have a feeling if it was a Vanilla Siege event for a R4C Black Ice skin the number of headshots wouldn't have been 'unrealistic'.
---
More useful then Glaz who was over nerfed but has potentially been saved now. 
---
Warden is way more useful then he gets credit for. Just picking him means the defenders have to consider using smoke thanks to the new risks. 
---
Tachanka has always been bad.  Until he gets a rework he wil remain bad.
---
good old siege
---
People like it because it feels nice to browse a desktop in I guess. To be frank, your dpi literally doesn't matter as long as it's above 400 or below 2000ish. 
---
Anything more or less and you start getting problems.
---
Im just tired of people thinking that a game on steam must have steam server, ps4 have sony server and xbox has microsoft server. Thats just very wrong. But yeah, sorry about that.
---
BOSG buff any time soon?
---

cry about it loser
---
I disagree there, warden is strong on tight bombsites when the enemy team either bring Ying or heavily flash site/smoke before entering.
---
It just cut out I'm sad now I couldn't make it to an hour.
---
They‚Äôre using the wrong guns
---
I‚Äôve always wondered why his gun is permanently suppressed?
---
Ubishafted
---
Dokkaebi has league of legends tier game design (not very fucking good), in that if you ever buff her she will become insanely broken.
---
Well i think all thes skins with that WW touch are pretty ugly. So not these
---
My favorite part of the picture is Bandit, he looks so cool in that pose
---
My bad man I didn‚Äôt know lol, but thank you
---
stop being a loser who relies on a crutch lole!
---
Smokes are/were infinitely better than claymores tho.
---
You got uniqueness and skill my man, mad respect. You wanna start up YouTube, just be yourself and get to creating what you want to make.
---
I always liked to go to the highlights page of the store and see what skins were cheap. Got some good ones from there.
---
Are we allowed to direct sexual comments towards the bot oWo
---
Same
---
This is what I expect from console...
---
Q and E. 
---
No real point in changing tbh.
---
As a nomad main I can see where your coming from lol. If you do play nomad, put her traps on doorways where there‚Äôs rosters and make sure they‚Äôre hidden. 
---
Anyway, because your plat your good at the game and so using buck can be good for breaching above and below the objective to kill fast. 
---
Hibana, thermite and maverick are always reliable picks.
---
Tbh any attacker is good in the right hands, except Blackbeard and fuze if your playing competitive
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs a suppressed P90 but I *may* be wrong
---
Lmao I‚Äôm low platinumüòÇ this is in casual

Hi @UbiNioty,

(I might as well try...) I‚Äôve really wanting to get this skin but I‚Äôve been in Germany and unable to do the challenge. Do you think you can add me to the list on Xbox?

Nope that‚Äôs for sure the 556XI

To discourage you and future people from doing the same. I don't give a shit about who your mains are regardless.

from what this video shows, you can get some decent frames.

It‚Äôs not the worst
---
What if you accidentally tk someone? I was playing yesterday and I saw an enemy and fired and one of my teammates ran past and got head shot
---
Yup, not a penny more from me. And hell if this ddossing sh*t goes on ima start boosting myself, i highly doubt golds and silvers will ddoss you. 
---
We should all do this, all us high rankeds should actually start boosting and smashing newbies, so this game gains less new players, that should teach ubi!

The forgive button exists for that.

High value target was hella easy man wdym?

I think there was a post about that. If you can't find it just check it for all the weapons. It's available for every weapon until Black Ice including Buck and Frost's weapons
---
A heatgun might help loosen the magnets!
---
How about if you TK in general you're a piece of shit.
---
I already have Maverick my friends gave 5 euro to me to buy it.
---
Ah, im dumb. Didnt understand that lol.
---
Because it is the natural predilection for certain subhumans to cheat by any means. As hacking isn't possible in console R6 (yet?), they resort to KB/M, exploiting glitches and DDoS'ing.
---
Honestly out my whole siege experience, I‚Äôve never seen any glitches or exploits yet others claim they experience so many lol.
---
I like to play a little more offensive, but like standing still and waiting for the player to come too (guess that's called camping).
---
Smoooooth
---
Put that bitch in the air. And spawn in like that movie [Executive Decision](https://youtu.be/LtFw6_YJiFs)

As Mozzie_is_My_Mate, I can confirm this is true
---
I dunno what pc servers you play on but im level 191 and ive seen maybe 3 legit hackers. Toxcity is there tho ill give you that
---
I got a hell of a lot of the invisibility glitches when they were a thing, and the one with J√§ger having a deployable shield on his face. However I may be unlucky haha
---
Ubi contracts out server management to Microsoft Azure. Ubi probably havs some influence over how the servers are run (they‚Äôre a client of Microsoft and probably have some level of control through a client portal), but it‚Äôs not Ubi‚Äôs equipment. There‚Äôs only like 3 companies in the world that have the capacity to host a worldwide network that supports this kind of gaming. Azure is one of them. Even Sony is going to use Azure for its cloud gaming.
---
I'm literally laughing at you.  Take a chill pill, dude, it's not healthy to be so pissed off about something that doesn't matter at all, IE, a video game.
---
I don't know mate console is pretty toxic. I've been vote kicked several times basically before I've even joined a match. And whenever i have one bad matcg i get flooded with messages from ny team and the other team saying im 'trash' or that i should 'play casual'.
---
 *I had this issue for a while, it was recurring during the last couple of months.*   
---
*Tried out:*  
---
*1. Verifying game's cache. You can do it by going to Library -&gt; Rainbow Six properties -&gt; Local files -&gt; Verify integrity*  
---
*\[my cache turned out to be fine, and verification didnt solve the problem\]*  
---
*2. Restarting PC.*  
---
*\[sometimes issues happen when you're playing after waking up your computer from sleep/hibernation\]*  
---
*3. Running the game as administrator, directly from its .exe in the game's folder ...\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege*  
---
*\[it solved my issue, but for a short period of time only\]*  
---
*4. Running the game in compatibility with Windows 7.*  
---
*\[same, it solved the issue, but not for long\]*  
---
*5. Updating Nvidia drivers.*  
---
*\[sometimes this is the exact cause of 'File corruption detected', even if your drivers are just a few weeks old\]*  
---
*6. Disabling IObit Advanced SystemCare and Driver Booster, then restarting PC.*  
---
*7. Uninstalling IObit Advanced SystemCare and Driver Booster, then restarting PC.*  
---
*\[I think this is what fixed my problem, finally\]*  
---
*Hope this 'to do' list helps somebody with similar issue.*   
---
Found this and trying it now.
---
Gridlock
---
I played Q&amp;E for a while, then switched lean to my mouse buttons. As I tried to really improve my aim I noticed leaning effected my aim so I switched back and I do really recommend using Q&amp;E. That way you can use your thumb to help control the mouse better instead of using extra muscles in your hand, potentially throwing your aim off
---
#GETALIFETRYHARD
---
That's why I suggested playing with friends cause it stops you from getting kicked but this game is toxic everywhere you go.
---
Nothing might happen anyways but it‚Äôs worth a try
---
Mozzie mains just salivate at the sight
---
Idefk someone inform me
---
Lol imagine smoke‚Äòs big ass nose peeking around a wall like creepy cooter. 
---
Even Cav could learn from that nightmare material.
---
Tbh good. Zofias withstand ability is dumb as fuck and shouldn't be in the game at all. Regardless of how cocky the enemy was, you didn't deserve to win that round.
---
That drone almost got yooted into the 6th dimension

I‚Äôm honestly surprised at the amount of DDoSing from the last 3 seasons. Up until that point I never experienced any form of DoS attacks.
---
Finka is pretty good, her Spear isn‚Äôt the best but it handles really well. Her LMG (Fuzes LMG) is really good with the adrenal surge since the recoil feels non existent and is fun to use with the 100 bullets. It‚Äôs a blast to rush with the sasg if you want or the LMG with a 1x scope.
---
Ash got bigger lips, so no
---
Rainbow 6 siege is a crappy broken game
---
Okay?
---
They gave it to everyone? That‚Äôs stupid.
---
They have removed all T-hunt related achievements when Phantom Sight went live and replaced them with updated multiplayer ones
---
Why?
---
For both, i'm lucky
---
Rip. I hit plat 3 with my friend and we stopped playing for a couple days and the next week DDOSing started happening so we just forgot about even trying to hit plat 2.
---
I was with you until one point. Ela's SMG is currently in one of the worst spots of all guns in the game even after her recent spread buff. She's one of my favorite too but that SMG is rough to use.

Hello Executioner__, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cgkwsu/help_me_to_get_the_black_ice_on_ash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Because it‚Äôs the best cheats they got, if they could use wall hacks and auto aim they probably would. What‚Äôs worse is they think they‚Äôre good at the game.
---
Right to your left
---
Vigil
---
But the new gadget would have to be amazing compared to Jager for it to be picked
---
Yeah, it's probably an accommodation for console players.
---
Remember the island in the kitchen
---
Because this is a paid game with a sub F2P game bussiness model.  Seriously I've seen F2p games that give out more loot boxes, better events etc.  Even Overwatch, who always gets shat on for loot boxes gives them out left and right. 5 free a week for playing arcade mode, 1 every level, and during events, and loot boxes you get during events are event boxes.plus you get 3 items vs 1.
---
Common skins &gt; Legendary skins
---
Yeah but he doesn‚Äôt do that in my rank yet he gets banned every single game. I don‚Äôt care why OPs get banned. If the same ones are always banned the system is garbage.
---
Maybe Ela or alibi
---
To be honest I think attackers need a permanent heal gadget similar to doc because finka is a stimulus instead of a heal
---
Thanks. I was thinking of what an offensive doc would be like after losing a few games
---
I did that but nothing happened
---
That would be dope
---
I had this happen a little while ago. The match finally started again after about 30-40min. So frustrating that people do this shit. The dude on the other team messaged me and said ‚ÄúYou should leave.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù
---
Sledge in the back like, "blitz, that's my job."
---
Yeah
---
But you also have to think about all of the different combinations of uniform, headgear and weapon skins and attachments. It's the same reason that the operator cards don't show your headgear and uniform at the beginning of the round and only show the preset one. That's why only having a few ops available for showdown made it easier, because they only had to change a few of them, not all 40+. Will they add a way to customize Alibi's decoy in the future, maybe, but it might only change when she gets an elite skin, but that will be awhile.
---
His torch just got a huge audio nerf today on PC. Now he's only really useful for mav tricking into sites.
---
I mean I have the money, I just can‚Äôt spend that much on something I won‚Äôt use that much
---
I like the vanilla pic better
---
The lmg needs less ammo in the mag/ longer reload time
---
I had this happen to me once and because of it I refuse to move for a moment when i spawn there lmao
---
Jager reprogrammed his ads to shoot enemies
---
While I agree that the 416 is too good I would argue that the Alda 5.56 is better due to having solid fire rate, decent recoil, good damage and access to an a of but all that is balanced out by maestro being 1 speed
---
That would be cool but wouldn't that make defense a little more difficult?
---
Jager doesn‚Äôt need a nerf
---
Mistake cuz he was nervous probably
---
Recipe control 100
---
For me, the spread makes it worthless at range, but I don't have to aim for the head, it'll get there eventually on it's own.
---
I feel bad for you, you probably got reported
---
No one spawns there anymore.
---
"Recoil"?
---
The Lord is the best operator so that why he never gets used because no one can withstand the POWER of the play
---
Especially bomb 
---
Nonono specifically bomb
---
Nononono exclusively bomb
---
Nononono ok im done
---
Alright buddy my autocorrect is a dick head
---
i agree somewhat but the nerf might be inevitable, and i want it to be the least painful
---
Sorry been forever since I played r6 did not realize
---
and with acog yes he is pretty well balanced.
---
He was on Xbox it looks like he could have easily been using his phone to record the "record last five minutes" feature on Xbox and laughed when he rewatched it
---
Vigil and alilbi are generally the 2 alternate roamers to cav
---
It's good shit, casual is great, ranked gets me pissed, currently I don't have a serious team so I just play with mates and that doesn't go amazingly.
---
Literally every game that has a dedicated competetive mode is made my monkeys then. There isn't a game that exists that cant be DDOS'ed
---
I guess I can give an update on it, I tried uploading the watchface to the Galaxy Store, however it was using copyrighted content apparently (even though all the properties were royalty free clip art). I'm not working on it anymore, as I'm really busy with the transition to college, but I can dm you the project file so you can sdboverbt the watchface over to your watch. Do with it as you would like. If you need any help getting it onto your watch, contact me.
---
so if a squad of 5 are in a party chat they can‚Äôt play ranked? For a lot of people being in a party chat is necessary because the chat volume gets drowned out by game volume or vice versa. The default sound mixer on the xbox can only do so much and in most cases doesn‚Äôt help that much.
---
‚ÄúBullet physics‚Äù
---
I meant acog when I said ‚Äúa of‚Äù I think autocorrect happened though
---
Replay the video at half speed, starting at the 15th second, while watching the bullet trail of thermite's gun, then tell me if it would've been better to lean left rather than right.  
---
Spoiler alert: I would've gotten a bullet shoved up my nose.
---
No problem, i already have a perfect control of my pizza
---
Oh. Didn‚Äôt occur to me that some people don‚Äôt understand that you can import those recordings into your phone lol üòÇ
---
While I agree he doesn't need a a big nerf.... He does need somthing to make him not a must have all the time...
---
He's not OP as a op, but his gadget in invaluable.  Maybe bring it down to 2 ADS, but have them each destroy 2 more objects... So wgile he's still be great defence, he won't be able to lock down an entire area.
---
Honestly, I think LoL is a bit worse but team killing definitely does not help Siege's case.
---
it would be a struggle i agree
---
Thats why I dont like pick and ban
---
I got the game last week and I have a 5.7 Black Ice. The odds are... Interesting.
