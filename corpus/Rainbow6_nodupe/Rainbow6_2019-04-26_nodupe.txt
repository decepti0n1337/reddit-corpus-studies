Yeah that makes sense, if I can find the video I’ll send it to you it explains a lot

I thought that was echo for a second
---
Zoom in more closely, his finger is clearly not on the trigger guard and basically on the trigger itself.
---
Because it's a lazy, scummy business practice that preys on younger audiences.
---
They make a colourful over the top thumbnail, litter it with midroll ads, then barely make it 10 minutes long to squeeze out as much money as possible while promising fake giveaways.
---
I'm not saying this guy is guilty of all that, but the way he's going about plugging his channel sure as fuck makes it look like he does.
---
they removed it for a reason lol
---
Twitch mains everywhere would rejoice if this was added.
---
Because kill cams are not accurate replays.
---
How do you know? I’m just curious.
---
I like to upload some of my clips to https://streamable.com/
---
That is really annoying. One would think that the devs would want to reduce that.
---
Any questions?
---
neat.
---
No it ain’t.  He’s finger fucking the shit out of the fun lever.
---
1% describes the MCs that aren't law-abiding citizens
---
They do even more than what people are saying. They function like noise canceling headphones but better. They are constantly listening to the environment and playing back and inverted waveform of that external noise of noises that are above a certain decibel level. Lower decibel levels, like people talking, walking around on leaves, etc, those kind of low level noises will be amplified. You can be in a full indoor shooting range and have a conversation at normal volume. It’s pretty incredible. They also are headsets for radios and some have multiple inputs so you can call in air strikes, jam out to some Metallica, hear anyone sneaking up on you and chat with your buddies, all simultaneously in the middle of a firefight.
---
I think it's fine. At least you can't get spawnpeeked.
---
I love it &lt;3 great job dude!
---
Is that a plate carrier? If so, why’re you wearing it so low? If the top of the plate isn’t even with the horizontal line of your collarbone then the top of your lungs are exposed. Much more important to protect lungs over your lower abdomen.
---

35 both @ 4K dpi for me
---
My personal favourites are Grim Sky and Burnt Horizon. There was something ominous about the Grim Sky one that I really liked and Burnt Horizon's is just super simple.
---
Wow that is pretty incredible! Now that makes it stand out!
---
I always wondered how people could still hear things like orders and stuff in the middle of a battle.
---
In what capacity would you rather keep an opponent alive? This would have to be a trap not a gun. And then I think it could be useful. Maybe a device like a bullet proof cam that you can stick on a wall and maybe the operator can aim and fire the bolas.
---
1. He is a male
---
2. He is a meme and people like to call him “the lord” and say he is the best operator
---
Yeah CTF would be an interesting one. I think it's definitely the most realistic game mode to choose though!
---
Management here, saying that I will pass it up to corporate
---
Yeah I was agreeing with you :)
---
They took it out for people voting kicking in 4 man team's. People weren't happy. They need set it after you damage a teammate by 20% you take damage
---
I think it shows them standing normal. It's just a perspective glitch
---
Fastest way? Looks like it
---
I'm pretty excited about this survey. I would love to see actual missions that are in the operator's various back stories in a full blown terrorist campaign experience maybe something along the lines of the missions from the old Rainbow Six Ravensgield and Athena Seord days but with Siege operators and destruction mechanics. 
---
Of course it would need to be a completely separate game produced by a completely different Ubisoft dev team and/studio (Ubisoft Paris made the Outbreak event)
---
That would actually be amazing to have a coop PvE campaign like a proper R6 title and just have essentially two parallel Siege games with different gameplay experiences. There was a LOT of focus on Outbreak and PvE related questions in this survey. I would definitely like the focus to be on real world military and law enforcement scenarios though.
---
ROFLMAO ACOG LMAO CHANKY GOD
---
Also - he has probably the worst DMR in the game. Used to fit his role. Oh well.
---
Lol how, Rainbow is competitive as fuck
---
Siege is what happens when you don’t admit your game is buggy and flawed and advertise it as a games for service product.  Instead of operation health they should just worked on a new game n take their time ironing out the bugs.
---
Do you know how many karma points I need to post a vid?
---
Is it wrong to be concerned about the battle royale and the capture the flag being an opinion? I know the chances of it is really low to considered these two as new modes but  I don't think it adding these modes will be a good fit for this game.  I could be wrong though..
---
no idea. it changes with each sub
---
"IVE GOT A SEMI-AUTO SLUG SHOTTIE AND ANYONE WHO SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT NOMAD'S FINGER WILL SUFFER THE WRATH OF MY FINGER
---
Jesus sure. Committed to helping out here lol. Thanks brother
---
There is exaclty the same way on the other side and faster
---
None of these I hope. They should do more LTM rotations, I'm not talking all the effort of fluffy plane but having a set map/map pool with a limited amount of ops but with various modifiers if possible like pistol only, no attachments, 200hp, no hs multipler those kind of things. Just mix gameplay up a little every now and then.
---
But she has short hair and bangs. Looks nothing like her. Nice try idiot
---
The operation that will have Africa and india could use it. African armed forces honestly use whatever the heck they get their hands on
---
I think it is since rank is based on wins.  I am forever copper because I solo against stacked teams.

Didn’t expect that rnding

Clapkan

Nice

Howard Lieghts are less than 50 bucks and do a similar thing. Do you really need the lightest weight version that has multiple water proof radio inputs, is rated for skydiving and diving, extreme temperatures, ability to mount to helmets and is compatible with night vision? A lot of military stuff is expensive for a reason...
---
But it is limiting a lot of potential of guns. Not saying it should be removed entirely, but it'd make the higher damage, slower fire rate guns more viable.
---
Ni
---
Personally, I know a decent amount about hit detection and networking.  It's not simple to make the game replay what someone else saw because of the way online games work and the interaction between clients and the server.  The game tries its best to make things sync up, but it's just not possible at times due to latency, packet loss, etc.
---
Call of duty ghosts aliens please. They are so cute
---
Uggy
---
I don't really care
---
I'll make sure and let them know.
---
Thank you. You have saved my poor life.
---
You just made a good point. Thank you I’m not as Maas even though I just lost a game but oh well.
---
That would be the whole idea. 
---
On defense it’s an amazing assist to Cav on an unsuspecting victim. Just as an example.
---
On offense it could trip up a flanking defender. 
---
X amount of time tied up in an injured state similar to frost but you recover with full health. I don’t know. Spur of the moment post. Yeah the idea has flaws but it’s a valid concept.
---
Because she's likely a liar leakers who don't or can't provide evidence are fake leakers.
---
I took a look at the models ingame.  His index finger is touching the back of the magazine, and it's a ways off the trigger.  But the trigger guard attaches to the magazine, it's not between the finger and the trigger as I had assumed.
---
Doc because you can’t beat the meme value of a Frenchman waving a white flag
---
Why would a person bother to complain about headgear.. It's something nice looking you can buy, IF you like it.. If you don't.. Then don't.. There are so many ugly headgears.. Who gives a shit?
---
Tony Stark dies with Thanos
---
What are potential solutions in your eyes then? I would like to see what everyone's opinion on this is
---
thank you sir
---
It depends if you like to defend or attack more. If you like to roam around and hide places to catch the attackers while ur defensing then vigil should be your pick, since he hides from cameras and drones. But if you prefer to attack then i suggest Dokk since she has pretty decent guns, she calls the defenders which can be pretty useful in 1v1 situations or to get info on the other players, as well as she can hack into the cameras which can help your team, since defenders don’t usually destroy their own cams.
---
I took it as maybe a whole new game based off the R6 “story” either way this is very exciting im already hyped for whats to come. I speculate it will be a sort of Ghost Recon style of open world with the R6 gameplay
---
Hibana and Kapkan
---
I’ve been kicked for trying to fend off the other players in a 1v situation
---
This Jager is kind of player I teamkill the most
---
got it, thank you for your advice
---
So....where do I find the other 144 rules? Also, I relate to this a lot.
---
Yeah, I got that feeling too a spin off of R6 with more modes. They did say they wanted to add up to 100 operators. R6 is a big money maker for them and it's fun to play.
---
You forgot Finka:(
---
With his ride the Shotgun is not good at all
---
I've been kicked because I chose a new op. When they started the kick I knew what it was about so I switched off and they still kicked me.

Fuze character is a reference to this situation + Beslan school hostage situation fail. It is somehow funny how his most recognized action is killing innocent hostage.

U just need to get a good five stack that’s the easiest way to rank up
---
I bet 500 that there was Cyclop behind you and she only waited. + you deserve this for using elephant skin unironicaly
---
No, we had one once we had loaded the match we also did not receive any ELO and on the ranking screen it had stated that we had not yet been ranked and we needed to play 10 more matches, but it had returned normal when I had gone to the lobby.
---
Do you have any recommendations of finding people? Just finished with another group- won the game and everyone left lmao.
---
Forgot hostage was in the game lol.  Me and my friends have always only played secure, just got into bomb recently because we realized everyone pretty much only plays bomb.

when one fan is better than a team of highly trained designers at ubi
---
What's with Vigil's head? Also why did you take a picture of your screen for a digital file?
---
You can’t always be in position, and hipfire is relatively useless on Valk’s gun (along with most assault rifles).
---
yes
---
If it is an option, then fine. Doubt many would use it, only those who have returned to the game after a year's break probably would. But, fine, the option would give some freedom and QOL.
---
Looks like a Sneaky cosplay
---
It's been suggested many many times before, honestly if you're ending the prep phase with your drone in a bad position all the time you should drone better.
---
That's not rainbow tho. It says your connection to xbl was lost not to their servers.
---
I’d tell you that you are full of it...
---
I thought the same thing
---
You'd be surprised. I'd bet money that most of the unranked and people who just play with friends would.
---
The pick and ban might just be the main change. Who knows what other features they'll add to ranked since it'll be out of beta next season.
---
If he already has the original ops I’d tell him to get Frost on defense then Hibana on attack
---
Colorado ops when?
---
I thought the same thing. But the Tec-9 is semi auto. Thats the difference. Vigil's is full auto
---
You see, there's an issue with what you said: it LOOKS popular but it really isn't. At just 3 maps and 2 modes, one just being a higher difficulty, outbreak didn't receive much attention. Streamers and pros played it on TTS and never played it on live. The common consensus was that it lacked replayability, and didn't fit in with the core gameplay of siege, so many above plat simply didn't play it past the charms.
---
Added to that, somebody from Ubi said that they spend a lot of resources on it and didn't get much back, despite what it looks like, so it received generally negative reviews.
---
I wouldn't want a PvE in siege for sure. It isn't the core gameplay. The current format as mentioned at the invitationals, of releasing PvP events like mad house, SI list and furry mode are so much better and fitting of siege.
---
Why is every fan art I see either dokkaibi or ela. It’s still good but let’s start getting some variety
---
Happened to me on ps4 tonight ...very frustrating. The players on the other team were advertising boosting service in their bio
---
Yeah if you have a link I'd gladly buy one or two, if you can take operator requests?
---
It's original concept is to make it clear to attackers (especially new players) that the time for droning is over, and it's time to start making a move to the building. Of course when you're in a position to drone out an area again you can hop onto it. There's also the point (though I would think most people wouldn't agree) that it's a small balance point, defenders know if there's a drone moving with little time left in prep phase they can easily chase it down and get it. If you're losing your drone so easily at the end of prep phase you just need to prepare more. It shouldn't be common to end the phase in an open position, gain intel, hide or place drone in a good spot.
---
You see, any information they get from this survey will be used to improve TH. They said they have Th improvements in mind, but they also mentioned that PvE won't be coming back anytime soon. If I had the source, I would deadass put it here, but it's been over a year.
---
It came along with the announcement that they wouldn't release 2 single sided ops in the same season.
---
Feels like it goes against the flow. I pick site first on defense, and the immediate next round, I'm picking operator. The inconsistency feels painful.
---
Let's get some Mr bear fanart
---
So there's the rule that not more than 10% of your comments on this sub should be self-promotion.
---
It’s not so much self promotion but a funny clip I had I’m sorry!
---
Mmm lips :P
---
CoreRoss is such an amazing YouTuber
---
Is that wii remote? 🤔
---
Lions is using a echo location based tracking which vigil can counter now. 
---
Cav also counters jackal while using silent step. 
---
Mute counters blitz whos using a wired lighting system. 
---
This game's balance doesnt give a shit about realism. its always gameplay/balance &gt; realism.
---
This can work both ways. You accidentally do 50 damage to 2 teammates whein c4-ing the enemy, the teammates are ok, but you receive damage for no reason when the victims are ok with it, especially since you took out the enemy.
---
Oh I'm sorry, meant it jokingly, hope you get some siege downtime soon, know how it feels when on that grind.
---
Oh I often see myself picking claymore over flashes. Flashes in siege are a joke.
---
James May: That's a Dacia Sandero!

Grade A detective skills right here.
---
Right next to you? No effect. 10 feet away? Screw you your blind now.

I think after enough damage has been received, a vote kick option would appear
---
Exactly what happened last night on meme park (another joke). Lost to a castle because of that.
---
Song is GHOSTEMANE - Nihil
---
He big mad
---
Your recommending a person to switch to console to avoid something thats more common on the console platforms ???
---
There are hackers on pc who can teleport, have auto aim and walls, they dont need to DDoS the server to win games. DDoSing is more common on console due to the lack on "normal" game hacks.
---
I spend the majority of my time in causal and its weird that I never run into such toxicity at the level your describing. And the way you berate people for spawn peeking and rushing is just sad. Its casual, let people play how they want to
---
Double oof. I cant remember the last time I saw a castle.
---
This has been said plenty of times in the past.  If you really don’t want to lose your drone, hide it with 5 seconds left.
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
Quick question, why was your text chat in square symbol at 0:22 ?
---
Imagine being bronze 3 at level 119
---
ive literally never encountered a teleporting wall hacking hacker on xbox but sure keep on makin rude comments
---
Yeah, it's nice art for sure but her Asian features got kind of lost. Reminds me of Daria cosplaying as Dokkaebi.
---
Imagine breaking a federal law to win in a videogame.
---
If you are on PC, Both Nvidia and AMD has features on their driver software that does it. It will automatically record a set amount of time of whatever you're playing and if you press save it will save that. 
---
For Nvidia look for ShadowPlay under GeForce experience and AMD has ReLive in their driver software. 
---
Example. Set record 5mins 1080p60. You play a game for 10mins and press the save command, it will save the last 5mins of gameplay.
---
Woah they made Blackbeards gun into a real thing!
---
Thanks for the name on the caption, thought it was blackbeard.
---
and advance repelling so i dont just get off when trying to hold and angle while moving one inch upwards. it kills me so many times
---
Noice.
---
DDoSing is more common on console, InGame hacking like aim,walls and tele is more common on PC. 
---
Please read the comment you are replying to before commenting.
---
No one cares about Black Ice in my circle. 
---
Then again it didn't take 119 levels to get multiple skins.
---
What if he switches the safety off after every shot just in case like a pussy
---
Literally just went to watch KingGeorge play and he was playing the same guys lol
---
I’d have to be really angry to do this, it’s still funny to me anyways.
---
Level 90. 0 black ice. Hope I get one someday...
---
I’ve played all 3 platforms since launch, have never gotten a black ice -____-
---
I got black ice for the F2 too, but I prefer royale on her gun
---
They are annoying but no reason to hate on this guy though
---
You are pretty lucky. I have black ice for p9, aug a2 and glaz's rifle.
---
You Lucky Duck, I didn't get a legendary till lvl 143

Looks like Seraph from Call of Duty: Black Ops 3/4!

my 1st was like level 30 and it was fuze rifle

So Sikh
---
It called money laundering. Where the police cannot track where the money has gone to since u bought online currency. Usually itunes google gift cards
---
Level 131 no black ice
---
Im lvl 147 and still no black ice bullshit
---
Because it’s impossible to defend from within the room, with windows on 3 sides and no cover.
---
My only black ice is for P90
---
Well, if obj is in kids you don't have to, blow out the walls and play from workshop, its safe
---
because you would be helping the attackers. its almost certain death to be inside of kids due to all the windows so its advantageous for defenders to be outside of kids and defend it by shooting through holes they’ve made in the walls. otherwise attackers could easily get in while only needing to watch one door.
---
He’s shit, don’t use him
---
I am an EX main but I prefer the AR smg is more fun though it depends on my mood
---
Can you post a video of your gameplay, or maybe DM one of us? We could analyse and see what's the problem. Maybe it's not your brain, but some consistency you just need to focus more on?
---
Also, why not take a break? I took a break and went to Apex legends for 2 months, I returned seeing my movement improved a bit.
---
“I don’t know what the problem with you americans spelling CAVEIRA, for Christ sake it is CAVEIRA not CAVIERA”

What’s the issue tho?
---
Watch pro league games, change up your style.
---
Nice I got my first black ice also this week but for the pistol from SAS xD
---
I ended up getting the legendary for Hibana's gun and I bought her right after that lol.
---
start game, perform horrendously, repeat. very little deviation
---
1 mill? Holy fuck.. what’s your level ? And how much do u play? Also 1 mill is how many packs approximately ?
---
I'm level 80 and I have 2
---
Wow! Props to you mate I want to get to that place one day, this 200K was without boosters aswell so idk what would happen if I had a 90 day booster, I hope I have the patience for 1,000,000 renown like you have.
---
Just my personal opinion and my taste in editing but i would prefer if there wasn't so much screenshake so as a viewer i have a better understanding of what's going on, but nice clips and decent editing 👍
---
Very cool! I’d love that too
---
Get it.
---
You'll call yourself casual now, 2 months down the line you'll develop a love-hate relationship with it to the extent that you'll be slaying in ranked AND shouting at ubi for not fixing Ash's hitbox (just a joke btw).
---
Get it. Game's looking great so far.
---
Sadly, i only have one black ice, and that being for thatcher's pistol. I'm level 91 btw
---
try to play good and get better to no avail
---
Wouldn’t that be glacier rn?
---
Now I’m scared to know what happens if you miss a High Valyrian lesson
---
more like, kids, can you buy me an acog?
---
Nice clips but hard to see because of the shaking and I had a seizure
---
i was watching empire vs g2 earlier today, just makes me look even worse in contrast
---
why val still using Nokia 3310?
---
Nice. If u look at my name, you will know what Black Ice I want :)
---
Big oof. All the black ice's over got I've gotten before lvl 100 and I haven't been able to get them since. There also only shotguns for some reason (I have it for the M870, SASG12, SG-CQB) like cmon Gove me some good ones. Although I've been getting toy skins which keep me satisfied
---
i got my first black ice at lvl 204
---
basically i play like a moron even tho im trying
---
1700+ people upvoted this.
---
More of this, less of pseudo creative BS and I would visit the main subreddit more often.
---
332! I play about 2-3 hours on a Monday - Wednesday and anywhere up to 5 or more (not always in a row) on a saturday / sunday depending on what I'm up to.
---
 Been here since day one but definitely could have gotten to 1 mill much sooner if i didnt drop the occasional 180k on packs + seasonal skins.
---
I have been asking for an attack healing op for ages
---
And?
---
Oh that’s cool
---
The best answer I can give which I believe is pretty ACCURATE.  Earley in the new season Ranks have yet to balance out meaning.  That the diamonds and plats just deranked ever one in there way on there push for said rank. It takes a good month for things to start settling down and by then you where either part of the lucky group that got unintentionally Carried to a rank you are not skilled enough.  OR you fought like hell and deranked yourself in the process because you just cant carry ever bot player on your team. 
---
But the majority the time if you are truly "a said rank" . Then you will climb back up to where you belong in our glorious cast system called ranked.
---
I mean that doesn’t tell us anything. Is it your aim? Your sens? Your map knowledge? Or just a general lack of skill?
---
K
---
Also my first blacj ice at level 100
---
This game needs better netcode first.
---
Nothing just wanted to share it’s pretty cool it works really well I was scared there would be a delay

Not tryn to flex but my first pack was a black ice for the smg11

Hello PippyOmega, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bhjso6/old_photo_when_i_could_carry/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It was a nerf, ubi said themselves it was

YES!

Deathmatch and capture the flag would be so cool, I got a bit wet thinking about that

Where can I get the sketch/plan ? (sorry for bad english)

Luckily I’ve already seen the movie, but people like you are actually pure scum

Which region are you in?

Well I followed your advice and checked your accounts and congratulations for being possibly the most pathetic person I have seen on this subreddit so far. You have 1 platinum account with a shit tier 0.68 KD this season (negative overall for both casual and ranked somehow), another "platinum" account that has dropped to Gold II with even worse stats, and a "smurf" which is currently a Gold IV again with a ranked KD of 0.86. You know, it's pretty incredible to have a smurf two tiers beneath your "real" rank with stats like those but hey hats off for that. You know, because if you can't even do decent on the account that is supposedly beneath your rank... it probably means that it's not actually a smurf but actually just where you belong without a 5 stack to carry you. But hey it's ok cause you "only pop off on well organized teams" because that totally explains being unable to break even in casual or ranked across 3 accounts and over 21 days of playtime.
---
The thing is, it's fine to be terrible. It's just a game after all. But why you would think you are even *remotely* qualified to give people who are genuinely trying to improve advice or say literally any of the things you have ever said on this account is just beyond me. What is actually wrong with you? You unironically don't see the hypocrisy of calling out MnK users while admitting constantly sandbagging your rank *and still sucking fat cock against lower ranked player?* You've actually blown my mind.
---
I understood fully what you wrote, I just want them to know the real state the game is in from someone that wants only success for the game,  that’s all. All these gamebreaking bugs have been mentioned for awhile now, R6Fix is just a way for ubi to dust the dirt under the rug on this subreddit.
---
That wasn't really what I was saying. That shouldn't be much of an issue if the ranks are distributed better
---
How long did it take you?
---
If the players fixed the game, this game would be long dead.
---
Do you know how garbage the ideas on this sub are? "BB is weak, give 240 hp", "blitz is too slow, git gud", "ash needs a buff", "lol stand still, how hard is it? Lion was useless and is worse now".
---
That's just a jist of the nonsense this community wishes for. Only the plats and diamond here, and that too only a few of them, know what "balance" means. People here only look at a change from the first person end and not the receiving end.
---
This is the reason the game should be balanced around pros and diamonds. At least they know the repercussins of a change in the long term.
---
Most of Ubi's balancing ideas are after consulting pros. The community has no idea what balancing really means. You need proof? Just keep scrolling. Or better yet, search "BB buff". You'll realise the truth in my words then.
---
Also, Ash's hitbox is perfectly fine. People just use it because it is probably the only siege meme that isn't dead yet. I've headshot ash countless times without a problem, so if you have issues, check your ping.

You’re joking right?

Try pressing on Alt+F4

If you go onto stat tracking websites, like r6tab.com, you can actually see who’s ddossing. In match history, the match will display as a loss, but there won’t be any elo loss. 
---
Above website actually has ddos reporting, as long as you get recording/photos of the ddos (error messages) and the team scoreboard. They’ll compare match history to the reporting and send info off to Ubi.

Isn't though, there's a fairly even split in pros between the 12 and the C7. Legitimately no idea why you brought up console, that's about as irrelevant to game balance as it gets

I’m in a similar position. I’ve been playing for years. I played with people who are a lot better than me (A lot) and have experience at much higher levels than I do. While I’d say my game sense is fine, my aim is fine I still choke when playing. When playing with anyone else i’m fine. But for me I subconsciously feel worse. Whatever mindset i’m in, my mind just stops working. I find myself standing around figuring out how to attack which I should know. I make plays that I know I shouldn’t. I make dumb decisions that I would normally not make. 
---
Being in situations where you know you should be better than you are, are the worst. And not being able to do anything about it is awful.

"Je me souvien" is a phrase that we mostly use for verteran's day

DEFUZE THE HOSTAGE
---
the problem is rainbow six servers can't handle much connection requests at the same time, it's way too easy to DDOS R6S servers compared to other games because **I think** their servers arent made for too many players to connect. 
---
they can try increasing the capacity or make it more secure or something like that
---
Depends on what ops you don't have yet.
---
The whooshing of a three speed that’s mad that she lost an ACOG
---
I don't have any unlocked
---
Red dot cause it's the only one 😂
---
All rounders? Definitely sledge on attack, possibly lesion on defence. If you're talking og ops then maybe kapkan.
---
I’m pretty sure Xbox one X doesn’t support 21:9 aspect ratio, you’re either going to end up with black bars or and extremely stretched looking image.

No sight, nothing to block my view and why would you really need a precision aiming tool on a shotgun used primarily for opening up lines of sight?

I personally hate such type of season passes which force you to do something to get all items. If I pay money for a season pass I want to get everything instantly.
---
A few seasons late to the party, but whatever.
---
Only if your headshoting skills are good.
---
Per bullet. If you combine the dmg/bullet and the fire rate. Unless they are in your face the smg12 is slightly better.
---
so much bad information here. the Kaid console recoil being worse was the only gun on console that's ever had worse recoil than PC. and they fixed it a while ago
---
console only has aim assist for Terrorist Hunt, there's is 0 aim assist in multiplayer. none
---
ah okay thanks for the clarification... my bad for not knowing

I mean if they were going to there would be an announcement about it and you'd know, but since there isn't how can anyone tell you information they don't know?

# A SHIT
---
Of all the dumb shit Pengu says, I really do agree that we need another Operation Health period. The game already has a ton of content. I don't know many people who think R6 is hurting for more maps, the newbies are already having problems learning everything as it is (hence the newcomer playlist).
---
What the game needs now is bugfixes, polish, and QoL improvements. The menus in particular could really use an update, though they've already shown some new UI stuff at Invitational that looks neat
---
True but in a game where map knowledge and gadgets are so important, being a good shot only gets you so far, and that's all you'd possibly be able to take with you into the game at first pickup.  I don't think there's much of an excuse for a level 37 smurf with a 7.0 kd and 5.0 win loss if ya feel me
---
bottom right - pool cleaner robot.
---
I'm pretty sure it was about how Iron Man, Black Widow, and Thanos die. Also about how Captain America becomes old and retires, giving his shield to the Falcon.
---
exact same as me
---
The problem is unlike batman and the justice league their is no records of counter messures for each operative in case they go rogue.
---
I don't know. I play on console.
---
Definitely two separate teams though
---
And is there a problem with that?
---
Tl:dr?
---
STOP, YOU VIOLATED THE LAW
---
I'm not saying overwatch. I'm a young just an r6 game that can push reality a bit further than siege.
---
I never play casual, i hate thar everyone just plays like rambo shotting everything that moves, including the teammates..
---
Omg, I love that headgear
---
I love you guys but this subreddit comes up with some *super* dumb shit on a relatively consistent basis. Just go back and look at the comments whenever new ops come out, if 90% of those ideas saw the light of day this game would be massively broken.
---
Right, but those are machine pistols.
---
Don't take the toxic behaviour personal and practice in Terrorist Hunt for map knowledge. Learn area callouts. Also don't be a dick even if others are
---
Well yes but that doesn't limit their Creativity to making very unrealistic ops. And it probably won't be like siege or Vegas 1 and 2.
---
Never
---
Don't worry, still better than the guy that thought that the Greek letter Lambda is only the AC:Odyssey symbol, so the Spartan bundle for Ash is a "spoiler" for the release of the game.
---
No
---
That would be over powered
---
well u will die alot.....but dont get discouraged.
---
if u are gonna be super competitive, memorizing the maps will help u alot. learning to sound play is important. play only couple of operators on each defending and attacking side so I can become familiar with them and expand ur pool of operators out fron there. recoil controlling. quick speaking with q and e along with ur a and d movement. 
---
list goes on and on but I think these are the most important ones. overall just have fun.
---
STOP, YOU VIOLATED THE LAW!
---
ACOG is superior in all but CQC, but tbh if you are at gold level or higher managing that one disadvantage should be fine. 
---
Personally I think instead of removing ACOG's on weapons from this point on they should give ACOG's a very slight nerf to their ADS speed. perhaps 0.050-0.1 seconds.
---
Damn I give my full respect
---
Ah thanks. Just got my first gun and trying to learn more :)
---
U r stupid for wanting this
---
You WILL be teamkilled a lot, watch videos online for map knowledge and lmg rush is an effective begining strat, I used fuze in the begining woth his lmg but Zofia is great as a dlc op
---
Then control your recoil and don’t potato.
---
This wouldn’t be very smart because elo gain is based off of ranks and whose expected to win, so coppers playing with diamonds, playing a full team of diamonds. When the diamond team wins they’ll get +1 elo and the copper team will get -1.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him. also use spoiler tag
---
Rules no one follows
---
Better range for the pistol means you don't have to get as close to people anyway, they didn't nerf her they just made her old playstyle harder and added a new one.
---
My hope is that they give me good legendary headgear skin not that Dokka headgear.
---
Thanks! I heard the atmosphere in the game is very competitive, so I already know that starting out I'll be terrible but hopefully that advice will help.
---
I already lose 30-40 and gain 3-5 bruh
---
If you can ignore the TK idiots and the toxic nutters you'll have a good time. If you have one, use a mic as well. That helps a ton. If I could remember my ubisoft name I would say hit me up and we will play sometime lol
---
It's probably *not* them trying to make a BR mode. They just know BR is popular and will ask questions about it. Ubi is dumb but their argument over data limits will probably warrant them *not* making a BR mode.
---
I’ve only had this happen once but from what I’ve seen it’s a bug. I’ve seen that, then the 2 actual black mirrors on different walls. Something about when she places it but cancels.

Came from another thread with interest. Video doesn't seem to work for me either.

Because you read on a day to day basis. how can you hate something that you do out of instinct?
---
Can you imagine a sandbox game with r6 damage. It’d be the most frustrating experience ever.
---
LINK?
---
This would be great
---
Holo for short range, reflex best for medium range. Holo obstructs the target further out but CQB is easier to target heads.
---
Amazing tho
---
I didn’t read all of it and stopped when u said something about preparing to play ranked. Just play ranked, you’ll see a lot of streamers and pro players tell u the same thing play the damn game thats how u get better. Don’t look at yur rank as something you gotta maintain but a reflection of your current skill. (somewhat since the ranking system is still stupid being bots can get placed plat by getting carried 10 straight games in a row and then getting diamond 2 days after the season starts by 5-stacking) Pros and streamers didn’t get where they are by not playing they literally have thousands upon thousands of hours in reference Pengu has like 13k on siege alone. Things become second nature at that point.
---
How do you put the fuze main thing thx
---
idk if the open world has to be BR
---
Holy shit that’s quite the wall of text
---
Weird (re)flex, but ok
---
Proof?
---
your name
---
Playing a lot helps in this game, since a lot of the game is map knowledge / game sense and you only get that from experience
---
Much appreciated advice and reply!
---
If they gave it a story mode like the original r6 games (think patriot) then it’d be amazing. But an open world game from ubi would just be another reskinned far cry.
---
Survey was emailed to me
---
I feel that way about most of the pistols, it's like I'm holding them up against my mouth instead of at arms length
---
They are both ARs y'know?
---
might become to good then because it's only downsite (in my opinion) are the iron sights.
---
In Casual why not, but in Ranked I think it's not a good idea.  
---
If you can choose map, you can choose where you're able to carry alone and ace every round, a map where you're literally a god. This will make you diamond rapidly. But in other map, you're bad so your diamond is not legit.  
---
In ranked, you'll be able to be the best or one of the best in every map to claim to be diamond.
---
I’m coming back to the game after a break since Outbreak, what was this Road event ?
---
Damm it
---
Just give it an acog
---
Don't know if I agree with that last one. If you always rush to save a friend you could be putting more of your team at risk. In some cases it might be best to just leave your teammate.
---
so who is his counter?
---
Bruh this survey was fuckin awesome it's the best survey I have taken in my entire life
---
You can create free smurf accounts on console, it's why Siege has '45 million players!!'.
---
I never understood the point of giving the bailiff a red dot sight, but then again i never understood the point of using it rather than the dmr pistol.
---
I actually kinda liked it
---
Thanks captain obvious. Haven't seen this before
---
Omg
---
Did it work?
---
Just an experiment or what?
---
Question, if 3 of your attacking teammates come through the same window without droning and I get a triple kill, does that make me a smurf?
---
Sometimes, the no-skin version is better than other skins on that gun. I like Vigils K1A without a skin, but I sometimes run the White universal skin :)
---
Good stuff. Didn't know this.

Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them. Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.
---
I hope Coreross' Siege 2 remains the same CQC tactical combat simulator.
---
I have tried the rest of Ubisoft's games as a service: Ghost Recon Wildlands, Division etc and non of those combat came close to being as fun as Siege.
---
Except less cool, and more like an angry adopted teen yelling "you're not my real dad" at the rest of Canada.
---
30% is a large number, if anything theyll do the 10% discount like the vip store for veterans. But a new game is alot of money so itll probably just be some skins showing veteran status like battlefield does with dog tags.
---
What I think should happen is they make a new tom Clancy title that is less competitive and more casual and still update rainbow.
---
No I don’t think so as they want 8 more years out of siege
---
I bet he recieved some friendly messages lol.
---
i have this problem to a lesser extent. mixing it up is what helped me. changing from a twitch/valk main to an iq/alibi main and changing my visuals by changing to 4:3 res and i went from 1-5 games to 8-2 in one game. try throwing it around and changing it up
---
You're just making it seem better and better. I usually just get over it if someone decides that I shouldn't partake in a round, cuz in the long run it's one round of the hundreds I'll play that week.
---
Is it still a bit discriminatory against people who prefer not to use mic?
---
5.Never reinforce between bomb sites
---
They e-mailed me so I'm not entirely sure.
---
'Be our unpaid QA monkeys!'
---
The gun is good but I can’t aim it
---
You are wrong in so many ways right now. They definitely need to fix alot like shields but the game is repairable.
---
These rules are also wrong
---
Maybe the bulky cumbersome shotgun on his hardguard might have something to do with it.
---
Yeah, I've seen that before. I wonder how that guy got into that situation.
---
Only problem would be that they have forgot how to make good maps. We'll end up with a game with 10 maps like Fortress and new Hereford. Then they'll think everyone likes pro league, so bomb only and basic operators. Then they'll be shocked when it flops.
---
I dont know if Frostbite supports all features that Siege needs but even aside from that they would have to basically start from scratch to make that switch
---
Yes, as it is competitive and it is a team-based game, at higher ranks you would certainly be derided. Lower games are hit and miss with mics. You should really work on your communication in this game though.
---
Sounds like that would waste the long term support in the current game, but not if they rework a lot of core aspects.
---
&gt;#*Kappa.*

*kappa intensifies and fixes siege*

AHHH-

There are plenty of semi-auto MACs, Skorpions, Tec-9s, etc.
---
Ever since the recoil I’ve called it the C8 Sucks Fucking Weiner.
---
You can break the floor next to the hatch to counter this. Also you can only place thermite charge in to breakable surfaces so it doesn't work with every hatch.
---
what's your yt?
---
If the only way to counter it is by opening a hole in the floor, which is the point of opening the hatch anyway, why even bother?
---
Bottom-right = Dusknoir
---
I know this is just a game, but the thought of a slide mounted optic makes me a little nauseous...
---
Yeah just skimmed it now and it mentioned a new game based on Siege but in a different direction (whatever that means). Still suggests it would be different and alongside rather than replacing.

I like how droning is "tryharding"
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, but in my language it literally translates to machine pistols
---
Sometimes you’re just lucky. That’s not something exclusive to siege. Sometimes someone jumps you and you shoot and you get a lucky hit with the recoil. Doesn’t mean you need to change a core fundamental element of this game because you’re butthurt someone got a lucky shot. Besides let’s be real. Even if it was a 2 shot headshot, with the rate of fire in this game for almost every gun, you’d have a maybe half second difference AT THE MOST in time to kill. Wouldn’t change any thing unless it’s situational.
---
Laser beam accuracy plus the one shot head shot mechanic is problematic. Guns need more recoil.
---
It's been in the game for ever and devs are very aware of it. Maybe originally it was just oversight but since they haven't done anything it is pretty intended.
---
The game is in a great place and only getting better
---
Dude I’ve already contacted DocHiggs, chill out....
---
Ya, how about you guys take our console recoil and we take your PC recoil should even it out a bit

This is plausible

So we lose, no big deal, it’s casual. I get an invite to a party and the first thing I hear is “How the fuck did you make it to platinum you ducking piece of shit”. 
---
All I got to respond was “It’s casual” and then they kick me from the party and block me.
---
Man, being a level 300 something plat every season gets annoying. If you do bad one game or miss your shots as the last one alive “fucking trash, carried / fake plat” but if you do good all of a sudden it’s “fucking try hard go play ranked”.
---
I just can’t win.
---
No one said it wasnt impressive getting an ace against some noobs
---
They misspelled IRA member.
---
They sould also add special colections like an all tatcher collection. If you complete that specific collection ( for example 2 headgears and 2 uniforms ) by getting them in packs or just straight up buying them with renown they should reward you with a collection reward= a special Tatcher cosmetic item that is only attainable by completing the collection.
---
Alpha packs are just so stale, they should incorporate way more challanges with in the alpha packs.
---
Pathetic, everyone knows you have to charge the suicide bombers head on, there is no other way
---
Yea, i definitely should have done that.
---
This actually goes for a lot of the weapon view models in this game, especially when using iron sights.
---
The operators really love trying to eye-weld with the sight rail, and some models of iron sight are literally unusable due to how unrealistically narrow and blocked the perspective is.
---
 not trying to be hostile either lol that kid was just lame
---
Hey I got a this off amazon a week ago.
---
Btw the bottom part comes off
---
Take his ACOG away NOW.
---
I never got to use the original Glaz scope so I'm curious as to why it would need to be changed back.
---
And why more accuracy?  People already complain about them being too accurate.
---
I guess in short, what is you justification as to why these should happen? I'm trying to question you or argue, just wondering why.
---
they probably wont due to the managable recoil.
---
Yeah I could be wrong, it’s just the mp5 on PC is a laser beam, and on console it’s not that stable, guess mouse makes it way easier without even noticing
---
Oh. When will they be back up
---
Yeah that’s a cool idea too. As long as they don’t start charging us Credits for alpha packs though, I like the idea of everyone earning theirs either from the wheel spin or renown which we work hard for.
---
Just because your on the same team, does not mean that are not your enemy.
---
“Stomping noobs makes my dick hard” mentality really does kill games int he long run
---
No, I’m not buying a new siege. I’ve put so much time and money into the first, I’m not going to just drop it. 
---
Unless everything carries over of course...
---
Gridlocks gadget isn't any more of a stretch than Thatcher. In any hero game roles exist and you need heroes to fill the roles. There's no problem with having ops fill the same role as existing ops. Kaid doesn't replace bandit, mozzie doesn't replace valk or mute. They fill similar roles but I don't see the argument for ubi running out of ideas.
---
Hot
---
Man’s got a glorious beard.
---
This is gamebreaking...
---
Yes he is talking about maximum cerebral capacity no shit Sherlock
---
Melee in this game is too broken to be fun
---
Interesting that no one banned IQ even though that if used correctly she could help Maverick, find valkyrie cams, and shut down a vigil-roam.
---
shit thanks for clarifying lol
---
I feel it. I like playing recruit because it frees me of the stress in having to decide an operator, then attachments, cosmetics etc
---
Oh hell yeah we upping the ante
---
I refuse to take off the outfit as well

OMG Another Nerf Operator Post about A Kill and not Their Gadget
---
Busted

Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.
---
Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.
---
He’s doing it with his ACOG out of that busted barricade on the second floor.
---
where have I seen this post before?
---
I don't think this would be a useful thing. Why would you do this instead of just breaking it
---
Basically me as a snackbeard/kapcan main
---
Ur a gadget
---
I always go in game chat and play random German sayings as I use him even though he is British
---
Yeah, kinda left out some reds and shades of yellow.
---
Alrighty you dysfunctional family of cleaning products, I just guessed it from other replies.
---
Use Astro a10 they’re only $60 and they are pretty good
---
What’s salty mean?
---
PSN?
---
But it’s not cheating if you console specifically let’s you use m/c and a controller.
---
i feel ya
---
Lmao are u twelve or something?
---
Ur a twelve
---
RaCiSt!
---
I see we are all men of culture
---
I usually mess around on my alt which is around gold 2 or gold 3 if I don’t feel like sweating in plat with my team
---
That's fair enough
---
m8 did you actually use a tiktok meme as a title??
---
My son
---
I agree. But I also think they should just open the gates and let everyone use them. Then they could possibly differentiate the users of each input method. Therefore it can be implemented into the matchmaking.
---
It looks like someone can't get through it, so you can surprise people by going through. You could do this on an outside door in order to run out, and people won't expect it because they'll be listening for the tell-tale sound of the barricade getting fully destroyed
---
I need it
---
Black beard is now gay
---
67 notifications though
---
Uninstall Siege please.
---
I NEEEEEEEED IT
---
hee hee
---
It might be useful in some maps
---
They need to release it along with a tachanka elite
---
There are esports games every week. PL finals are coming up in Milan. We’re half way through the season so I’m sure we’ll get news on the next operators soon.
---
yeah it is
---
no just thought he was white
---
Ur a twelve ? What ?
---
Take my money
---
You can't say the n word that's racist
---
Ur a what
---
well, you can just change it back to pc if you are scared of potato aim in console...
---
Yeah. Solo queue for a warm up before my friends hoped on and was immediately team killed by the 4 other players upon the start of round 1. 
---
All you can do at that point is make call outs for the other team, tk an asshole round 2 and quit. Fuck em
---
i just realized people actually do this
---
Wait...
---
You talking bout butch?
---
So this basically confirms buck has very little training in handling his gun then? Or basically forget about it
---
Also, for which country did you serve for? Just askin
---
Just involves him going on a mad on with bandit jager and doc
---
SMG12 is good for clearing rooms and pray&amp;spray, cz is for prediction. 
---
Als, if it's not a dmr it does not necessarily need an acog.
---
Siege itself does not support MnK, people bypass this with adapters such as XIM.
---
What?
---
I just want them to be detectable and put in different servers/lobbies, then it’s fine. Right now it’s cheating in every way.
---
we will get there eventually
---
99% of the people using an adapter will still use said adapter.
---
Ya, this is definitely situational. Not useful everywhere. Just thought I'd show the way I've discovered of doing it because some people seemed interested in crouch holes when I talked about it on a post a couple days ago that showed a prone hole (using a less efficient technique than what I showed in the video)
---
but the bailiff's destruction is dook imo
---
Reading this hurts me
---
Actually in Ubisoft's tos(I think) its considered cheating
---
Squirtle
---
"Finally", we started complaining more than one year ago
---
I don’t know what you mean. Unicorn tachanka is better than any possible elite
---
A bad and unneeded one
---
I agree, I think realism holds games like this back from being really creative. Realism has its place in games, but it should stay in games like insurgency and battlefield (talking about technology I know battlefield isn't that realistic)
---
Because the U.N. peacekeepers ar soooooooo effective.
---
Hey man, congratulations! Being a gun owner is a responsibility for sure but an amazing pastime as well.
---
Idk I just think if the console allowed it, then I would get mad at the console company not the player
---
wait mute is black?
---
They're never gonna promote recruit.
---
An outfit that makes him Stalin
---
I think a zombies sorta mode could be interesting. Defending+attacking operators, multiple waves, etc. Maybe make it so that you can pick whatever operator you want (or just classless), but everyone starts with pistols and then you upgrade to any weapon and gadget with points earned for killing zombies?

I have a friend who I can never get to play Siege and when he does we get the most toxic horrible games so it just makes him hate siege more. This game is not friendly to new people.
---
Bad for xbox/ps4, most squads communicate though built in chat options on the console. Full squads on PC use discord also
---
Was thinking there should be a hipster skin with the bun
---
Cool idea but flawed
---
First off... Why with the name? 
---
Second, yeah, that would be hilarious
---
I'm more interested in the possibility of future single player and co-op possibilities.
---
I have said the same thing to quebecers hating on other Canadians. I love Canada and Quebec. I think it is moronic and immature to perpetuate  generalized hate on a group of people. Keep an open mind.
---
But that’s rook
---
no blitz/lion ban?
---
I'd rather have fun than be good.
---
Technically, Twitch and Clash have tasers already. Could you elaborate on what you mean?
---
Clash‘s shield?
---
Your enjoyment of a multiplayer game shouldn't be dependent on skill level. Duh.
---
Uh, I've owned the Year 2 bundle for a long time now. Can't give an exact time frame, but I do know that I snatched the last 4 ops I didn't have out of Year 2 since Operation Para Bellum at the latest, maybe even Operation Chimera.
---
That'd be impossible.
---
By its rook...... I don’t want to get r/woooshed but if it happens, oh well.
---
Eh, I don't think this is rework is really a Nerf. I use glaz as a long range sniper, and this rework won't really affect my playstyle with him. If anything, I'm glad he won't be an entry Fragger anymore regardless of how it is done.
---
What are the operator bios not good enough for you?!? /s
---
And Aceez got double spawnkill whit turret.
---
He litteraly posted the same thing 3 times
---
There have been no problems with username changes as far as I've seen here, so, no.
---
I think it'd be great if they did something similar to or even just remade Rogue Spear.  Siege is great and all, but I do miss being able to fully customize my loadout.  Being able to choose a combination of ANY primary and secondary sidearm, even down to the FMJ vs JHP or buckshot vs slugs was great.
---
Then there was deciding do you want tear gas, or flashbangs, or smoke, or grenades.   
---
 Even little things like do you bring a gas mask (in case the other team brought tear gas) or do you bring a breeching charge to make entry?    
---
There was a lot of thinking and prep depending on the maps and predicting the opposite team's loadouts.  I don't like the whole "well, they're elite operators for the SAS, Delta Force, Spetznaz, etc....but they're limited to 2 guns to work with", kinda unbelievable that if Sledge prepped for a mission that would require him to have an SMG-11 that he somehow couldn't have access to it, while his teammate (Smoke) did.   Just like how Jager is supposed to be elite GSG-9 operator...but I guess their budget ran out of Acogs after IQ got hers.
---
 Also, the maps had some decent outside play as well and inside.  Huge areas underground, mixed in with cramped quarters.  Some of them were absolutely great (Oil Tanker, TV Station, Siberian Base) and would be awesome if we could get updated versions.  I don't think we need science fiction gadgets to have a great game, just something with a little more tactical realism that stays true to the heritage of R6
---
Maybe a neutral bomb or flag or defuser you have to take to the enemy base to plant.
---
Why do I have to see this post every 5 seconds on this sub
---
How dare you forget about clash :-(
---
thats not the bundle.  you may have gotten the last 4 then, but you couldnt buy it all as one pack.  thats why its in the featured on the home screen.  because the Year 2 Eight Operator Bundle just got released after the patch.
---
Why to make it more immersive?
---
You didnt pass the art class right?
---
I’ve had this picture since the beginning of season 4, but completely forgot I had it
---
Fir me it is the same with montagne i still use the whole event skin and yes also the shield
---
What is the point of this post?
---
You can stop worrying about grenades now!
---
I was just watching that, you should also add that everytime a UN recruit gets killed they become more underpowered until all they have is a handgun
---
I’m not saying that there are no positive effects of crossplay it’s more revenue for the game however you’re dumb as hell because there is no xbox to PlayStation crossplay on rocket league and sorry I was wrong about that piece of shit fortnite game as I stopped keeping up with it last January
---
Did you win?
---
That got removed quite a few seasons ago and was apparently nonfunctional for a few seasons prior to that for casual and ranked.
---
#me too
---
Actually that would be really cool if it was laid out like a normal game &amp; you had two buildings with attackers &amp; defenders on each team.
---
Yeah, you right
---
that's great, because nobody wants a BR anyway.
---
me too.
---
The lagging has been extreme for me lately.  Usually consistent 9ms.  now it's 200-300+ for brief awkward moments.  PS4 WUS
---
Maybe. I think that's a big question though. I obviously wasn't the first to discover it, but I did discover on my own without someone showing me. So the question really does become what makes an idea "yours"? Just because someone else had an idea before me, does that mean that idea's no longer mine? It was still my idea that popped into my head. Who knows man :P

So toxic yet so amazing 😂. Always wanted to do this.

Doing this with maverick is actually useful, it’s dead silent
---
Awhhhh poor baby, how’s your vagina kid???
---
Brom is more fun, but I’d say SAT is more useful to the team. Just my two cents though.
---
That gun more than any other makes me wish we could at least choose our iron sight model if they're of the "rail mounted back up sight" type. Realistically, those should be interchangeable.
---
You've got some entirely reasonable ones, such as the one from Maverick's M4, or the one used on Mira's Vector and a bunch of shotguns.
---
Frost was there, too.
---
Bro join faze clan

Just go to casual and inv people to talk until you find some decent people it’s pretty fun

Psyonix and Sony added Rocket League to PS4's cross-play beta program today, an initiative that launched in September, in large part thanks to Fortnite and player outcry.

Then explain to me why I’m on Xbox and can play with my pc friends but not PlayStation. Hm. I think I’d know from experience

Habsburgs: RUUUUNN!!!

Oh, then fuck Yt, man :/ you have some good videos there... Is there any chance for a re-up to see those non working vids?

Eh after the nerf/buff its fairly even

If you have 200 ping and they have 0 ping, that means from their perspective your peak is delayed by 100 milliseconds. That is 100 milliseconds of advantage that you gain. However, the shot that you fire is *also delayed* by 100 milliseconds. That is 100 milliseconds of *disadvantage*. That's why peeker's advantage has absolutely nothing to do with the ping of the person peeking. It is entirely related to the ping of the person being peeked. In which case the higher your ping, the greater the disadvantage. There is absolutely zero advantage to higher latency.

You should also know that you can’t shoot through that window (Mira’s black mirror), until the red canister is popped. But it is highly recommended that you don’t pop the canister if you’re on defense.
