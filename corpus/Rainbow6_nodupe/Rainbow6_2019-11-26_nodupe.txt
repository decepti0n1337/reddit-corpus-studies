Who still has the music on in siege anyway lol

---
Music: 0%
---
its called newcomer

I gave up a long time ago, pal.

 Binge watch every single episode of Money Heist. If everyone does this, it'll be a success. I for one won't because I watched 3 minutes if money heist and decided I didn't like it.
---
Baby rage post. Don‚Äôt like the game don‚Äôt play it. Just because they share the name doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Get over it.
---
Thanks for the feedback I will now go back to spawn peak with tachanka and think of something new
---
record, report to ubisoft support.
---
Matt Andrews
---
I'm reporting you to ubi for hacking into my account and taking screenshots of my stats
---
I want as many r6 player to see this as possible lol. I‚Äôve been running into the same groups of toxic stacks and I just haven‚Äôt been having fun lately. PLAT IS SO TOXIC! I miss gold
---
Yeah but that really didn't matter since well rushers are a thing
---
The discussion has already been had though
---
Why would you even try to kick when you can mute, report, and move on?
---
I'll do that next time thanks
---
Idk why you guys are whining, it‚Äôs a free event. The game‚Äôs been running for years stop being a bunch of entitled people. 
---

---
Gonna get downvoted for this but oh well
---
it is called karma hunting. people don't get enough love on real life and decide to compensate with fake internet points.
---
Idk man, and I find that reporting people on voice does jack shit for me
---
I feel like the key to being good at this game is to just have a couple drink before hand
---
They're good with other games the thing is tho is that alot of the time they base their artwork of the original design to keep art...continuity? Its weird man I give up
---
It's horrific
---
And kicking does?
---
You open the window on day maps you'll go blind!

# WE NEED A FISH ELITE SKIN

Me too but mine shoots up to 1000
---
It is true, i was there when it happened
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
That's what I think too cus I'm pretty garbage but a after a couple shots I feel ready for ranked
---
I loves me some spicy sasg
---
Laughs in SMG 11
---
I think ima try this for next season some people go sweaty try hard where as I will be just be drunk outa my mind
---
try on asia servers, alot of people play it on there.
---
I think that would be nice.
---
Im assuming the dips are when you play with your presumably existing friends who love to teamkill about as much as ash likes to enter through top floor hereford when obj is basement
---
Wheres fuze the hostage killer and tachanka the lord why did you not favourite them
---
Damn, I want one too.
---
Until they buff Castle and Chanka(admit it, Castle in it's current state is too much nieche pick, just like Warden, and Chanka is getting a rework) - no real reason for them to have Elites(IMO).
---
No
---
Yes. I've always wondered what Siege would be like with **only** vanilla operators. Add vanilla maps only, and this would be one of the most interesting events to date.
---
Oh
---
Expect bullshit. always. Then when it happens you will be prepared.
---
Took me a minute not gonna lie.
---
I like that song
---
Why didn‚Äôt you make friends with N√∏kk?
---
Then why are you here?
---
*laughs in Outbreak hazmat suits*
---
Well it was a great gamemode... 
---
If you really like hostage and bank is your favorite map

I've always had music volume set to zero so I had no idea there was any audio for it in the first place haha.

I spelt it wrong but I am not changing out
---
Really well done!
---
"But Muh IT WAS A SPAWNCAMPING MACHINE. NERF!!!" - literally every crybaby from Wind Bastion TTS.....  
---
Now it's unplayable piece of......Hope that with Shifting Tides, recoil would be reduced(from the TTS session - looks that it's really a bit less violent).
---
still better than ember rise theme tho

#FUCKING REPOST I HOPE YOU DIE BITCH
---
It is full of noobs playing on free week. So there were 3 kinds of people:
---
1) the tryhard
---
2) the noob/ free week player
---
3) the troll
---
How does everyone else play it? My buddies and I have it so that there is sledge, and  the defenders must be a two or three armor, nobody can fight back until it‚Äôs the last person, then they can only knife, and on Defence, they pick Cav, you can play any attacker, but if you pick a shield op it must be on your back, but other wise it‚Äôs the same rules. We were experimenting with adding other ops as the Hunter such as Jackal,Alibi, Vigil, Pulse, or a few others. We also have a rule that you may use your gadgets, as long as they are non-lethal, or are only used to move around the map.
---
Why limited? Make it a permanent game mode!
---
Re-meme.
---
Introducing, a repost.
---
WHAT DID YOU SAY??
---
You guys don‚Äôt turn off game music? 
---
I‚Äôd rather listen to my own stuff while in menus and then nothing at all during gameplay so I just turn it off on every game I play. 
---
It really is the best
---
exactly...
---
A BI that looks more black and ice than white? Not bad.
---
How do you check this stuff?
---
Imagine expecting this sub to understand that.
---
Quick repost
---
IKR, the only viable option is a pink furry suit
---
Imagine having casual unlocked, real gamers  only have T-hunt unlocked
---
i'm poking fun at the fact that this was reposted a couple hours ago. i put the same exact title as the one that was reposted.
---
Aa12? For real? That spoiled meme?
---
Imagine **ak12**.
---
The radar room*
---
You do realize that the J√§gercorps really exists and every game could implement a version of that and none of the games would copy from each other, because the source is something completely different?
---
No surprise that this is coming from someone who likes Pokemon porn lmao
---
He doesn't wallbang anyone. He is teamed up with Castle who downed Smoke at the same time as op killed Nokk. When Smoke got injured, RFF was activated for the whole squad (Castle + J√§ger + Rook). 
---
You can also check the killfeed because you see 3 RFF messages, twice with (SQUAD) at the end and one "normal" message for Castle (check the name).
---
My God........
---
But why didn‚Äôt Jager kill nokk in the first place?
---
And R4-C a oh
---
Reeeepossstt
---
And not even a funny one.
---
I feel like that would be good cause instead of tking during match you could do it after and get payback without sacrificing points or getting a reverse tk
---
I dont like your Tuna
---
That's kinda your only choice. You can't trust random humans.
---
No this is a thatcher buff /s
---
more then 3 mins on clock in obj as attacker just that plus the lack of reaction to her led me to that conclusion
---
I sure hope so, because this is painful to watch lmao
---
Oh my Lord COME ON! **Not even 2 hours and reposted already!**
---
I got Thatcher's too, along with Bandit, Frost, and the UMP for FBI
---
Hey get out of this circlejerk with your "logic".
---
...and GSG9 ACOGs....on defense of course
---
I was so confused, thank God there are smart people in the comments!
---
Well, that hasn‚Äôt changed
---
Where do you see this chart?
---
Name checks out.
---
I want the black ice for the pistol for thatcher
---
Yeah it‚Äôs nice
---
That‚Äôs what mine looks like
---
I was actually expecting lesion to do that.
---
I was looking for this comment. Hell yes!
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Wasn‚Äôt plane in the beta too?
---
Did you guys see the UwU to or is that just me
---
This would actually work well for a new playlist, especially since that's lacking in Siege. "Classic" mode?
---
You are a bad person
---
Apparently that‚Äôs too difficult.
---
A mode but everyone gets an acog
---
More reason to buy the elite skins too, the only reused weapon without a legendary from the elites' is Kaid's shotgun.
---
The ingame report buttons are placebos (fake buttons that do nothing). Record the footage and send it directly to Ubisoft.
---
Is there a "casa de papel" theme?
---
But it‚Äôs No Nut November
---
And it's on an attacker... That's a 2 speed. Both factors you forget to mention lol.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs kalis other code name or something
---
It‚Äôs finka there is none
---
lOl wHo cArEs¬ø
---
It's just a game
---
What's that second image of?
---
Love being called a kid even though I'm 20 years old, lmao. Nah, that's just called being toxic.
---
Given you've been playing for 1 1/2 yeara, 365 days in a year, divided by 2, 182.5, so 365 + 182.5 = 547.5 hours estimate 578 lets say. 1,000/578 = ~1.4 hours a day. I didn't exactly try on the ending but on average you play between 1-2 hours a day
---
Well if the downvotes you've been getting aren't a sign the way you've been communicating has been very rude, dismissive, with a slight "I'm superior to you" tone to it.
---
You are either way overthinking it or 20 steps ahead of us all and I have no way of telling. Though we already know watchdogs and I think it was AC are in the same universe(if I am wrong sorry). I don‚Äôt think it would be a huge stretch to think that the Division universe might of been before or after the R6 time line. Though I doubt they are at the same time. The whole DC thing would need to be big if they were same universe.
---
Look into the RB6 Discord channel. There is big audience of players there that are always actively looking for a game. Good luck and have fun!
---
Nice!
---
So everything would be balanced as it should be
---
i once played twitch in a ranked and tagged everyone on the enemy team getting 5 assists and i stole MVP from my friend
---
please tell me you don‚Äôt actually think they took this from siege
---
Got it too but i didn t use it because other gems skin are looking better

Add valk cams and you're ready to feel free to go

He is probably a CoD main. The flinch in BO4 turns your screen black black and flashbangs make you do that stupid hands up animation.
---
Fuck clash.
---
Bruh he is being sarcastic lmao
---
I want everything up to date, including new maps, but only original ops. 
---
That wouldn‚Äôt be that hard programming wise. Trying to make everything old again would be incredibly difficult.
---
Don't be, literally the exact same as the regular game but the hostage was wearing a mask
---
How am I a bad person
---
I was in no way negating any thing anybody said. It‚Äôs obvious I wasn‚Äôt dismissive, because of that, and the fact that I responded to all points, as I am doing again here. I also see no clues of any superiority, just the laid out presentment of arguments in a statement. I do apologize if I‚Äôm ‚Äúover speaking‚Äù myself, and if someone would have the stones to tell me I am like you are now fella, I would‚Äôve done so a bit ago. Downvotes hold little to no meaning to me here other than a visualization of a lack of argument
---
Bruh you even did Nokks special o thing but spelled j√§ger wrong
---
That's kali's company......
---
Yes 
---
The cons heavily outweigh the pros.
---
I‚Äôm surprised Buck sat there and watched you obliterate Thermite AND pull out a whole pistol. Nice play OP!
---
Wait hold up, your the one who made it, I‚Äôm just saying the operators that you picked, and Zofia are the operators I like to play.
---
Imagine the hostage being the defender lol.
---
Theme park isn‚Äôt around anymore, but turning brightness down would make some interesting
---
I see a lot of good ideas on this subreddit which get upvoted a lot, but sadly we never see them in the game..
---
Like what?
---
Bruh wtf ranked gets unlocked at 30 right?
---

C'mon dude, have some self-respect, don't subject yourself to that rubbish map. It's good for PvE and that's it.
---
That's something Hot dogs Horseshoes and Hand-grenades should add
---
Everybody gets ACOG! Hey castle do you want an ACOG on your shotgun? Here you go!
---
But can we switch the def and atk operators? As in on Attack im playing def only operators and same for defending in playing attacj operators lol.
---
Ahh it looked like the kitchen on coastline
---
damn lucky, i have it to the ak :/ i never use the ak on fuze
---
you can stop worrying about your virginity now
---
The song that was played during the event was called bella ciao or something like that. Big song in the show
---
Try a cross cross pattern with spikes?
---
That‚Äôs a really good point
---
And give ash, Jager, and smg11 acogs back
---
I‚Äôve used tactical in other games since I can remember but I don‚Äôt think you can change it in R6. I‚Äôve tried to and I don‚Äôt see how
---
.
---
T
---
I like that run outs and peeking can‚Äôt happen.  They ruin the experience for attackers. I agree with your other points though
---
I had no idea what the hell you were ta talking about until I saw the end
---
They did the terrorist hunt strat
---
Does RFF not trigger now when you shoot people in your squad?
---
Seriously? I keep meaning to but always forget when I'm actually in the menu. I'll try tomorrow

But why the hell was it so loud

ubi S U C Ced ur money

Did smg 11 have better recoil? Acog on it sounds awful
---
No... All I know was a lie.

Well if it's not the same account the skins wont transfer

at that point, rush site wherever it is. go for kills.
---
I've noticed I only DC when my internet is super slow.

what's your download speed and upload ?
---
wasn't this post made by  [u/Furry\_Teletubby](https://www.reddit.com/user/Furry_Teletubby/)?
---
Reason 1 of why you should have advanced drone deployment on.  However, with it we wouldn't have this fantastic clip, so I'm split 50/50
---
if he took 2 ACOGs away then that means...
---
&gt;K1A ACOG
---
I would‚Äôve called hacks lul

Because Bosg acog was somewhat realistic.

me too fk

That would be awesome

Thanks, Oobee.

An ace is an ace

I dont even care now , i just asked something and u pop up downvote and be a dick

How about knifing him instead of being a bitch. 
---
Realistically you should've lost that
---
It might actually be their fault, ofc I don't know them so I can't say for certain, but many have been abusing the fact that unranked players aren't affected by the MMR gap restriction that came out recently.  And even if it **is** their fault, witch hunts are still bad.

The question is why you have the menu music turned on.
---
yep, just tried to launch the game. Thought it was a bug. Went offline, was asked to sign in, so I signed in again, still connection lost... Right as I quit MW for pissing me off to play some R6
---
It's the first map I played on and learned and I'd rather have that in rotation than Favella any day of the week.

*happy sosig noises*
---
Thx
---
Holy shit dude
---
Because matchmaking works by having the same elo approx. in both teams.
---
I think that the design around the skins of siege is for you to be able to say "I played this game at xxx date, when this was available", and that it should stay that way. 
---
I'm not one for skins whatsoever, but I like my vintage Ralphie skin, because it shows that I was one of the few people playing at launch.  If everyone can have the skin, it isn't special anymore.
---
Warden mine
---
For the hit sound i suggest: *minecraft_steve_oof.mp3* (i dont think its like this but i think you got the idea)
---
Yep! It just makes me sad that it will probably never happen because some of those audio clips are copyrighted, for example the ‚Äúbruh‚Äù sound is copyrighted.
---
#G E N T L E M E N
---
Ohhh, that‚Äôd be super cool. Twitch has had a monopoly on the drone game for far too long. Plus it‚Äôd be a really interesting way of placing cameras for your attackers to access... if you didn‚Äôt want to use them for blowing holes in things it‚Äôd be like an attacking Valkyrie
---
Yeah, it could also have a sensor indicating if somone is near and notifies the operator. So i guess like an alibi but with audiotory illusion 100
---
LOL, very nice. It‚Äôd be interesting to see how people use them in-game
---
Same
---
No 90% of the time thats on your network. There are no speical hidden settings to reduce network lag. 
---
Using wifi will add most of the lag and unstability, especially in a apartment environment where there's a lot of other wifi networks that are flooding the air. 
---
Also depending on how good your wifi switch is and the amount of people using the switch can add more delay. 
---
Any chance of getting a ethernet cable and plugging your console/pc into the switch directly?
---
It was very satisfying to see the teammate making a very moronic move.
---
sadly, no. i think it ended 3 to 4 though
---
Good mute
---
no, its just that i normally stick to the same operators so there are some that I just don't play.
---
They could pay and get it. I mean.....now they even have Netflix cash. I'm pretty darn sure they ubi gets paid for every episode.
---
I've been playing since Year 1 Season 2 and never got one, oof.
---
It could be used passivy to slow down the attackers but I also tought: maybe have him be 3 speed and use it for flanks. 
---
So say you're hiding downstairs on plane. People are on the main halls and you set up one of your gadgets on top floor stairs. 
---
You set it off and make it seem like your running up there.
---
While the attacker tries to peak on to the stairs you come up from the bottom stairs and flank them.
---
ACOG Fuze charges
---
Rhino: 3 armor operator with a shield. After sprinting for a designated time, rhino enters a charging animation. While in this animation he runs at the speed of a 2 armor. Though he cannot use his weapon while charging and has less control over turning. While in a charge, he can burst through barricades and possibly soft walls, and on a collision with an enemy, deals damage and has a knockdown effect similar to Nomad, but obviously less powerful
---
He'd probably suck in the "meta" but you can't tell me it wouldn't be hilarious and satisfying to kill someone by just running in to them at full speed and sending then flying with a shield
---
That is what you call rainbow six seige
---
my friends told me to try echo but he's always banned so I see no point in even trying to play him. Lesion is somewhat of a roamer which I can't do. I'm terrible at roaming and I don't have a good headset to hear footsteps really so roaming isn't my thing. I'll stick with maestro tho. Thanks man
---
Playing an op b/c you're good at it &lt; playing an op b/c of black ice skin
---
A new attacking drone which could complete the mini golf loop de loop on Outback
---
Alternatively, it allows it to climb walls and ceilings, kind of like an impromptu Valk cam on the attacking side which you need to manually set up. It‚Äôs quieter like a Twitch drone
---
And Jager/ Bandit/ Ash acog plz
---
An acog on a acog
---
Contact customer support, I supose you bought it digitally, if so, you should have a receipt in your email, attach it to your ticket and it should be fine. Good Luck
---
Yes but if I remember correctly at launch a vaulted door would guarantee detonation.
---
lmao
---
I just unlocked the acog for my acog
---
Oh shit i thought it was billie eyelash
---
Emotes on r6
---
Ah, times where all attackers were Nokk by default. This game changed so much.
---
They could've make this mode more fun without any real effort - make that you only can play as Hibana and Vigil (you could play as same operators in halloween event already), and bag of money instead of hostage
---
I wouldn't agree for 2 reasons:
---
1. Plats and higher skilled players then you still play casual, just not as much
---
2. Some people only play casual and never really play anything over it so that is their area of skill and still clutched on similar level people
---
I do agree it's not as impressive as on ranked, but all in all a clutch when you only play casual is still a clutch. I've "clutched" against plats on casual before and I'm only a silver
---
Either you edited your comment or you're fooling Sirfaggit here for no reason.
---
Shoots Hammers at people
---
It could still be that 2guys left, before even loading in.
---
No she doesnt need it and having a 1x sight on the r4c is probably better any way since youre rushing and so are in cq. The g36c really isnt that bad of a gun it just got overshadowed by the r4c and now it has a use.
---
it‚Äôs not tho
---
And old game mechanics + jager and bandit agog

Yes
---
What if we switched the operators around so attackers are defenders n shit.
---
S m U C C
---
With old rules..Bring back the acogs
---
Mute wasn't revealed either, I don't think. His Elite only shows his eyes but I don't consider that a reveal.
---
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!!! Back when the meta was simple and game balance wasn't a nightmare.
---
I think the guy just droning the place unknowingly the person he searching was just an inch away.
---
Acog on Maverick Torch would be nice to make out that devils in the detail
---
That‚Äôs better legendary isn‚Äôt that good
---
Everyone has their choices. I loved the acog
---
You can ask the other team to pick only launch ones lol
---
I never rushed. Like really never. I always play using my head. Ash for me was an op whom i could rely on easily
---
Fuck off

It was a normal hostsge but I still enjoyed it

30 V, 80 H, 6 rds and lds, 25 ads if i remember correctly

Then explain vow im so good at knowing where thy are coming from all the time
---
It was a couple off cool skins so worth it
---
I get legendaries from 4%. When I go over 30% I usually get commons hahaha

Then just left and right

I would love to go back to season one for Just one day, with my current knowlegde and "Skill" :D 
---
Time to reinforce Kidsroom Baby!
---
Nomad because I like To punish roamers/flankers
---
I would actually buy this skin for 2000 coins
---
Doc and Rook arnt launch ops sorry to disappoint
---
I will keep that in mind
---
Same here, suggested this a while ago, I think it's a good idea it's just that nobody really got invested until it showed on the front page of the sub.
---
I agree
---
Acog Blitz ACOG BLITZ
---
I understand your pain

Reminds me of a match on Tower the other day. You know the catwalk that attackers can get to above the top floor? Well, I chose not to use that, and instead rapelled into a window under it so it was above me in the area I entered. I heard rustling and realized someone was near me. I heard where it came from and carefully went over to see Caveira prone behind a desk. She was just getting up to get me when I blasted her. I then walked over to her corpse and crouched to reload, and as I did that I heard more footsteps. I looked around, saw no teammate silhouettes, and listened carefully to where it was coming from. I heard that slight clattering of guns and gear that you get when crouch-walking, and it sounded like it was coming from... Behind me? Left? Right? It was hard to tell. Then I heard a silenced pistol shot, and it was RIGHT BY ME. I sat there silently just listening closely, moving my view left and right to judge directionality. Then suddenly I see in my peripheral vision a big dark blob dropping from above, and I heard a loud CLACK from the shoes hitting the floor, and it scared the SHIT out of me, so I ehipped over and absolutely DESTROYED... IQ. My teammate was sneaking around above me, and decided to drop down RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I immediately said in voice chat "oh jesus fucking xhrist, gahh! I'm so sorry man, you scared the SHIT out of me!". There was laughter :p
---
I disappoint people enough already.
---
Watching Doc die is super satisfying.

buddy.... your teammate...
---
How is kids bedroom still an objective?
---
yes
---
Not all.
---
So far, Gridlock, Moz and goyo are 100% worth it. Wamai too will get worth it at launch. Kali, not sure. She engages outside Siege's engagement distance of 9m and has a limited range Thatcher gadget (Thatcher's is 5m, her's is 3m).
---
So I suggest you wait up on Kali.
---
Amaru and n√∏kk are situational. Wait for buffs.
---
Ew
---
...also on his character card.
---
I don't think that there are completely new players which have a rank, because they have to be atleast level 30 and played 10 matches of ranked... so they should be able to know how to play the game. Maybe they dont already have the feeling of gamesense or know how to counter some metas or popular strats. But until gold or plat elo. I haven't seen people really playing with gamesense or some insane strats. I know that doesnt count for every player in that elo, there are always people which play some good strats and are able to counter the metas and just have the feeling for the game.
---
Smurfs? For sure, most of the people playing in copper are smurfs i'd say. But I'm curious what actual copper players do wrong to be stuck in there. Solo queueing? 0 gamesense? I hope you know what I mean. (sorry for changing the topic lol)

Not ewwww it's true, with this game I've more fun than other things. When I'm Spanish, French and Italian dudes, we have a lot of fun because we are Latin brothers
---
I think the devs played too much red faction guerilla. They just wanted a completely destructible building.
---
here's your upvote!
---
Like the goofy running animation of Doktor's Curse
---
IQ because I love awareness, Caveira because I like.... awareness.
---
Because they created those operators that no one wants to play. That‚Äôs false content. Either make elites and a full game with full content or not make operators that people don‚Äôt want to play.
---
It only shows up as jackal? Thats odd.
---
For someone who is colour blind he was a nightmare.
---
Do it no balls
---
He still uses the old stock Bandit face.
---
Part of the thing when designing maps is the fact that the game is already super defense sided due to the fact that they have time on their side. When Dev's design the maps, they keep in mind that two of the four options HAVE to be bad, or every game would go into overtime (and if it goes into overtime when defense wins every round, then it doesn't matter if you're good, it's a coinflip). As a result, many maps have one ironclad defense site (basement on Oregon, for example), one defense site that's more or less even, and two that are abysmal with one that the meta has figured out is a slightly less awful choice.
---
Sledge looks more like gru in my opinion
---
I care primarily about higher level play, acog is a crutch for some players
---
such as me lmao
---
That should definitely be an event. They should make a playlist with OG maps with Og ops how they were on release. E.g Smg 11 Acog days
---
Tachanka, Fuze, maybe Kapkan, Echo, Vigil, Nokk.
---
Only Smoke's hair was revealed.
---
Damn, I had an op idea like that a few months back that was almost identical but you could also run through barbed wire and was based of someone else's icon, great minds think alike.
---
No, it's not worth it, I have bought R6 Credits for buy Elites, some of them I really regret for buying, 'cuz Ubisoft is doing really good with no real money envolved skins, bu yeah, if you want to buy, why not, who am I to stop you? No one, but my hint if you buy R6 Credits is to don't buy operators, buy Elite Skins for them, like the Smoke and Hibana one's, but that's my opnion, if will or not buy the credits it's with you
---
April fools event leaked
---
Holo ain't bad and allows for more aggressive playstyle you should practice it in t-hunt
---
i do the same thing at open doors near spawns to piss the enemy team off. they rush out of frustration and you clap them all.
---
Ok, I'll take your advice. Thanks
---
I would only ever spend r6 credits on things that can't be bought with renown, but hey that's just my opinion
---
1.) I dont think 2 OPs with gas on defence would be very fun, and the whole point if that she's on offence
---
2.) The camera would be used just as much as a drone would
---
3.) It would be an animation where you inject them with a serum of sorts. It would take like 1.5 seconds
---
Ok got it.
---
Thank you for telling me! I am not sure why it only shows Jackal, though.
---
Menu music was cool idk wym
---
im a Vigil main lmao, im kinda forced to. i play J√§ger an awful lot too. i have to say that Holo is more powerful on defense than ACOG on most maps, excluding ones with absolutely huge corridors like Kafe.
---
Unranked bases it's matchmaking off your mmr from ranked, so they would share an mmr system. Unkraned is just a ranked game that has no affect on your mmr total from ranked. So yes, if you're plat 3 in a regular match, then you'd be plat 3 in unranked.
---
Now i played siege for years, I can totally tell you that if you like a cosmetic that only costs r6 points no doubt, do it if you like it a lot. 
---
Operator side no, never. You can easily farm a ton of renown by doing some quick method with a booster active team, who can let you profit around 320 renown every 40+ sec.
---
Even if you want to chose not to abuse the method, take your time to farm renown, just don't waste r6 point in em since it's useless.
---
Cheers.
---
Unraked don't have ranks, it's just a playlist with the rules of Ranked, she don't have MMR, you'll just win renown, xp and alpha packs, it won't affect nothing with your rank, but if people click in your name they will see the Rank you got by playing the Ranked playlist, it'll just show it, Unraked don't have MMR
---
Im picking 9x19
---
Just open the box
---
They just suck ass or are there even legit cipper players
---
Why does it feel like he had Vietnam flashbacks while not letting go of the trigger?
---
Fuse
---
Calm down Basically Homeless....but respect to you my good sir
---
Cause it‚Äôs a terrible map. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs casual. In some ways that makes it worse because there are always teammates who don‚Äôt reinforce which makes the attackers easy job even easier.
---
Or ur team surrenders when you disconnect, so you get a loss and a 30 min ban :)
---
Why the fuck is it always Gign or fbi swat lol
---
I feel you. Played since velvet shell and only got 1 Black Ice and its the one you can buy for renown in the shop... Frosts shotty.
---
Subnormal que eres
---
Because it‚Äôs not.
---
Best thing to do honestly look up a video on how to warm up this will give you the set up for terrorist hunt and this is the best way to get used to the game and get better at it
---
When we see this map we go breathers for the fun of it !
---
You have to believe in it for it to do its job
---
That's because they must've just started around there in their placements.
---
I meant for a link to the skin.,
---
Oof I bought em all at 25k. 
---
Sad times
---
Camo on impact gernades would be lit
---
Just that‚Äôs why I got the year passes.
---
I got 2 legendaries in my first 10 packs the thing was that they were duplicate.
---
Idk how well attackers would defend and vise versa :p
---
All eyes on him man
---
My comrade as a respecting member of the community you are welcome
---
With our eyes.
---
It is bullshit that they can do it on console but not the actual operators
---
How many times has this been screenshot, holy fuck
---
And the main map
---
Now do it with Amaru, then you'll feel successful.
---
I didn't get the reference.
---
What the fuck?
---
No, I meant, A, if you spam in just one day people will ignore it, and B, 2 instances in the past got banned/removed for spamming.
---
I get both Canadian operators on random select.
---
hahaha no clue
---
Everything, you say? Tachanka‚Äôs turret, blitz, smg11, ash‚Äôs grenade launcher, etc? Hmhmhmhmhhmmhmhmm yes I think it would be fun to get B E A N E D from across the map super shorty.... seriously tho I want it
---
come on  I know the alt-right of Reddit (which is most of reddit) always tries to push people towards eating meat but at least try to disguise it. and buddy dont say its a meme or a joke or something bc its not.
---
I want that.
---
A company still makes AA-12's for civilian use, just shot 1 of the new test models at a range.
---
Ok Wesley
---
Most of reddit is alt-right? Lol, *you‚Äôre* a meme and a joke, bud.
---
r/shutupwesley
---
You're on the wrong subreddit pal
---
Man I love our twitter cm
---
It's even better when you fire one in each hand
---
I punched a hibana through a barricade once
---
I'd love to see pro teams play on this map
---
VEPR 12s are probably still being produced, but they are no longer being imported (to the U.S. at least).
---
Yeah it‚Äôs fun I guess on attack but defending is just stupid. There are some maps where defending is harder but you can still win but this map it‚Äôs just ridiculous how much easier it is for attackers aside from a few spawn peeks.
---
I approve
---
Man I see this less often in low silver than in plat.
---
Ah, nice. Looks like Fuze got some Reality Warpers.
---
Under the name ‚ÄúAA-12‚Äù? I know recently the ATF decided that all of the remaining semi-auto AA12s are actually machine guns because fuck it.
---
docs revolver spawn peek boys
---
Lmao good one Wesley.
---
Happy cake day mate
---
u use the shotty u are
---
He's just a troll. No point trying to argue
---
That girl looks like she‚Äôs gonna eat the gun just like how you swallow a sword
---
Horseshoes and hand grenades?
---
Apt commentary, Wes!
---
Imagine having a main.
---
They just removed the auto sear, made by Sol Invictus I believe, and will cost you around 3.5k.
---
thx. :)
---
This map is so much fun.
---
Ah, that. Forgot how exposed you are.
---
tired of seeing console players shitty aim and 3 kills on this sub like no offense it just irritates me when ppl think they are good yes im toxic
---
People really gotta stop giving trolls attention because they stopped being funny a long time ago
---
;)
---
Your ads Sensitivity is too high for you. Its the reason you had to slow motion aim at the cam. I suggest a lower sensitivity a more 1 to 1 feel. You‚Äôd probably be a great shooter too ad youre not bad now.
---
Not a chirp just genuine advice as i went through this problem for a while.
---
The shotgun is bad to you?
---
That's odd.
---
Also, her pistol has super clear and perfect iron sights, it doesn't need a red dot.
---
That sounds really dark in a different context

Why? its a shit show of trolls and team killing. I was very good at secure area why should I be punished because some hard core players want to cleanse the game of all casual players (not to be confused with the game mode casual)
---
Hell yeah
---
I am closing in to level 200 and still I don't have any...
---
"99.99%".
---
Yes, while most players don't go pro, it doesn't mean you can't have fun in a competitive environment. 
---
I enjoy trying to improve and it being the most competitive environment leaves no room for bs anymore.
---
because i'm really good :D
---
No, ranked is supposed to be competitive so make it the most competitive game mode, play cas if you want to play secure. And it makes balancing the game easier because then they can just focus the ops and maps around one game mode. This is how it should‚Äôve been from the start
---
It would need some serious redesign to be a good bombsite. As it is right now it reminds me of Tower's 1F bombsites but without hatches.
---
In total I got banned for 4h hahaha
---
Same with  R4-C
---
Nice
---
u dont understand? ok i gonna kill your familie today. im from mother Russia!
---
Unboxing screenshots are against the rules and the mods should step their game up.
---
As a plat 3 i can confirm
---
Jesus Christ, we live in a post-irony society indeed.
---
&gt; To all the sweaty pros on this subreddit, games should be made for the majority
---
Fuze : why......
---
At least this season...next season? Who knows xD
---
Play the game
---
400 IQ
---
Ay, thanks. Happy holidays to you too!
---
LOL
---
Are we gonna ignore the car tripping acid in the corner.
---
literally nothing,makes the mouse a standard mouse
---
As someone who used to only play secure area, I never want to go back. A game like siege is like chess, or settlers of catan. And once you play catan with cities and knights you just can‚Äôt go back to the base game. Same with bomb. It‚Äôs too exciting and awesome to just go back and play secure area.
---
Yeah I though of this during the majors when people were spamming acog something in the chat
---
#It Wasn‚Äôt Me I Swear!
---
Ok kiddo lmao
---
Good luck with your shitty YouTube channel.
---
Bien dicho.
---
Love can bloom even in the battlefield
---
They have experience in the game and they can see when an operator is going to be overpowered.
---
To be fair, the real complaints from them have been around Lion - which they were correct in. Hence the multiple attempts to rework him.
---
They aren't a fan of Goyo - as three of those shields takes a lot of utility and delays attacks significantly. 
---
Amaru, there went many complaints about and nobody in the Pro Scene will be using her with any great regularity in Pro League.
---
Kali, we shall see. I've seen a mixture of those saying she will be too strong and those that played her in the testing phase who said she was fine.
---
:D
---
Ask that the Ubi Support so they can ban your Account.
---
good job replying again. That definitely proves you are not immature with that sentence.
---
I just started playing again (stopped in Chimera) and I feel so bad when I'm alone and my teammates are watching my screen. Damn this game is hard.
---
once something is posted anywhere on the internet, it may never be posted anywhere else, ever again
---
ever
---
Kids room on house too
---
I have no idea how that could cost a round
---
You can absolutely have fun as defense. There are at least three chanka peeks, two c4 peeks, and a whole myriad of stupid crap you can do to harass or otherwise enjoy blowing something up.
---
I stopped playing this game seriously after 2000 hours. The last 1000 have been just me and friends goofing off and doing whatever dumb shit we can think of, and it's great. This map, and house, especially.
---
2nd day of my 1 month long hiatus.
---
Going ok so far.
---
I get iq Monty and castle 
---
every time
---
I love favela because it‚Äôs bad
---
Don't tempt me to buy it.... I'm broke!
---
That little blue circle in the corner......
---
You the real MVP man.
---
Your aim seems good I don't know what your talking about
---
FUCK IT, ACOG ACOG. I said it. Acog on an Acog.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind interrogating some balls
---
*if you know what it mean*
---
That‚Äôs has happened to me since the start of year 4
---
I had a game where we lost the ranked match but I got elo for losing... found out once I got back to the main lobby I had gained elo for playing a hacker. It was pretty neat.
---
Your drone is going to heaven
---
You saved money so you can spent it, do it!
---
I just saw that dude's Cav and Hibana art....oh my God are those beautiful,
---
If was just me a person pushed and I killed him then another person pushed but I had one bullet left if I had those extra I would of easily killed him
---
Because the F2 is retarded overpowered.
---
Boo this man! BOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Ah yes, shodgun
---
That's true
---
Noooooooooooooooooooo! I'm just an honest cook....uh....i mean, gamer!
---
pardon me what??
---
Oh, now i see, nice
---
It‚Äôs actually amazing how fun and relevant the original operators are
---
But....but......my lunch money!!!
---
I‚Äôm tempted to get it just because it‚Äôll look great next to the Caveira elite on the showcase operators tab.
---
UwU what's this?

Git gud.
---
Eh. Guess it's personal preference.
---
I feel like this is a custom, no way all of them are so absent minded üòÇ
---
Gonna take a while though. Cause showcase is pure luck.
---
The game just wants to appreciate the skyboxes.
---
My favorite skin in the game.
---
You know you can select what operators you have showcased, right?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I mean
---
I might be thinking of a different barrel sry

*Notices your necky wecky*

WERE ALMOST ON YEAR 5? Hell ye

haha yes
---
Honestly, thats pretty smart, have my upvote
---
I would like to consider my self pretty O K but with one bullet and a plat 1, 1.5 kd,level 300 doc pushes out prefiring I dont think I really had a chance but I did hit him with my one bullet in his chest Ethier way im about to go play t hunt to warm up my aim
---
Excuse me a moment...
---
#WHAT THE FUCK
---
I mean....
---
Fair enough
---
True.
---
as long as Jager gets his acog back im cool.
---
See some maps don‚Äôt need a full rework, all they need is better/more spread out bomb placements.
---
Truth
---
exactly what i thought!
---
I hate the new seasonal skins except from that skin that looks like and pro league set skin but isn't idk its name doe
---
He‚Äôs a good op to start with but I do see your side if you use him right he can be a real team player plus his guns are good
---
This guy knows it
---
When you have the hammer out evreythings 8 times closer
---
I‚Äôd say get them in the order you‚Äôve listed.
---
HIS FACE IN THE LAST ONE LIKE WTF DID I JUST DO
---
See you're perfectly qualified
---
Dude, with idea's like these? 
---
You can hire me to be your spokesperson, everyone who wants to say anything to you? Goes through me. I got you bro.
---
username checks out
---
the way he screamed xD
---
Kaid is gonna get discounted in a week, so start with Mozzie.
---
i played for 4 years on ps4 now im switching to pc and unfortunately i will lode 4 years of skins
---
Audio plus context makes it 3x more satisfying. Thank you.
---
Goyo is amazing
---
I wish rainbow played more like they used to :/
---
Something is off about how Wamai looks but I can‚Äôt pinpoint the reason...
---
No, shoots ACOGS at people!!!
---
Or T-Bag like they just won 5 gunfights.
---
I'd personally say Kaid/Mozzie &gt; Goyo &gt; Warden, or Kiad/Mozzie/Goyo &gt; Warden if you think you can learn how to play Goyo effectively.
---
Just to let you know though, we're getting close to Year 4 Season 4, in which Kaid will drop to 20000 renown. If you decide to buy him, you might want to consider waiting a bit to save that 5000 renown
---
*US armory flies by*
---
He is.
---
#thatcherSMG
---
Your flair is ein zwei polizei. You have to but it
---
Mozzie imo. Great gadget, great guns, great roamer with the shotty for rotates and drones to help your roam. Kaid is v good too, just a little less fun to play.
---
Then I prominently ask for Tachankas turret with acog, shooting acogs
---
Normal waiting times on xbox lol
---
this game was so sick back in the day.
---
Yeah
---
I would love to see like a Gunfight gamemode. 2v2, classic ops only, but they can only be from one CTU.
---
Plot Twist: It's been 2 months and 1 week since you started

But I'm not gonna charge through the door wearing yoga pants.

Why cant I get stuff like this
---
Did you get it this weekend?
---
Gameplay would still be the same general strat of having attackers rushing sight from multiple angles and defenders spawnpeeking and magically being at every door you try to enter
---
I've been talking about it with my friends and I think 2v2 is too small of a team resulting in matches that are too small for the casual player
---
Oh my üòÇ
---
Hey! I got the elite skin so you better buy it aswell!
---
He shouldn't have touched that outlet man
---
Thought so, well my shooters have barely any magnification so i'm just used to smaller targets i guess
---
Dont put a space between the parentheses and bracket
---
I really feel like there's far more appropriate games for a 5, almost 6 year old to be playing. Little bit mature for a young child.
---
True
---
I hate people because people treat other people badly
---
I stared playing last week and I'm ready to go for a long while more
---
Yeah, I think I should give it another try. Just like to keep it casual in terms of ‚Äòplaying for fun‚Äô and keep it light. Besides, I did manage to convince two friends to join me occasionally on Ps4,  but they don‚Äôt care enough to put in the time and effort (which makes sense, considering they‚Äôre 40-ish dudes with young kids and full time jobs... like myself :))
---
Needs a Wilhelm Scream
---
If you mean DMRs then: 
---
Twitch, Glaz, Buck, Blackbeard, Dokkaebi, Lion, and Maverick. 
---
On defense you have:
---
Kaid and Goyo, because their shotgun is basically a DMR.
---
It was never going to happen since Ubisoft knew the old days pc and console performances and decided to go hard on a trailer and slow down in game, it's just what every company does for trailers of everything.
---
find a good sensitivity that suits you, don‚Äôt listen to streamers or use theirs. Also don‚Äôt try to play like streamers, find your own flow of play
---
Nothing's more satisfying than seeing that red marker after killing a player.
---
It's this disgusting shit right here I'm talking about. Get this cringe filth out of this sub.
---
Excuse me, what the fuck?
---
That hipfire just doesn't make sense. Even if it is slugs, the bullets should hit her. I love when games have realistic hipfire like Escape From Tarkov
---
Thanks - I‚Äôll probably buy the platinum.
---
Lmao didnt expect you r/tekken folks to be over in this sub. Tbh I'm more excited for the original characters like the one coming up. I forgot his name but I'll be damned if that isnt the hardest tekken character design  yet.
---
Try out all the ops and find one that suits you and work with it and get new ops and try them too
---
It‚Äôs cause ur on console
---
Strong Toph vibes coming from this
---
Is it safe to say that Warden/N√∏kk weren‚Äôt ready for release at this point?
---
Its gonna be really important to practice in T-hunt hard mode in lone wolf as different ops so you can get a feel for recoil and sound cues without being pressured of being hunted by actual players. Also recommend the beginner playlist for you when you try actual multiplayer.
---
The tip I give to all beginners is: 
---
Learn the maps. 
---
Map knowledge is super important, the more you learn, the more comfortable you'll be.
---
Actually I just checked and apparently I got a pack when it said no connection, so I guess Ubi thought this one out, my bad, thanks papa Ubi
---
How many more years do we have to wait for the already mentioned Tachanka and Castle reworks?
---
right now i have Mira and Hibana. Would you say these are good ops to start with?
---
Same, miss my Velvet Shell skins so much...
---
Siege community
---
I remember those one time it kicked me from the match and gave me the penalty, or sucked because I was grinding for maestro
---
dokki seems like she could have white snake
---
smoke obv purple Haze
---
jackal could have moody blues
---
Echo with Aerosmith
---
Mozzie could be hierophant green with his take over ability

What skin is that on the 416-C? I have seen it many times in pro League too.
---

---
What a fun Kaid buff! Kaid getting his barbed wire back is my favorite patch note I've read this year. There's just so much creative stuff you can do with it, and I never really used impacts since his shotgun can do most of the construction you need.
---
Watch VarsityGamings "Siege School" series, there is some really helpful stuff for new players of siege.
---
Yeah I really want to play Ela because I like her mines and I'm a 3 speed roamer kind of defending player, but that Scorpion just feels bad. Obviously they can't just give her something that is Vector-like, because she'd be completely busted, but they need to do something to make her SMG more useable.
---
My first pack gave me a legendary
---
It was for Mira, (now) main
---
We should not
---
Sorry Siege console*
---
When you anchor, hold an angle and as soon as an enemy enters your line of sight and you're about to shoot him, a teammate gets right in your crosshair. You kill him, the enemy kills you and you get kicked. I mean, is there any other way to play this game?
---
sick. thanks!

---
Aight. A single shot from a stim pistol will cure your pedophilia
---
I had 5 upvotes when you wrote that comment, later i had -2 and now im on 1 . I like how community is divided in 2
---
So this is hours with the game running, not hours played
---
Seriously appreciate the feedback and the support! I love respectful criticism.
---
I mean semi auto marksman rifles but thanks
---
I know this is weird but you did the eyebrows really good
---
Good or bad? I love R.B!
---
Idk, I‚Äôd rather them be underpowered than overpowered.  I think warden was designed for a meta that no longer existed when he was released.  I‚Äôm guessing they were concerned that Nokk would feel unfair if she was too powerful, hence her bad guns.
---
Thank you! Means a lot to me, honestly!
---
I was questioning why everyone thought she looked 12 but it's a bit more obvious in the Cav and Hibana art.
---
Also those are some exceedingly pointy chins.
---
Can we not have this weird sexualised bullshit here
---
Hibana
---
I recently got a PC and bought it. Played a few casuals and some Unranked. It‚Äôs nothing really different. I‚Äôm shit with a mouse and still went positive most the time. 
---
Besides leaning without aiming I was basically playing the same exact game. I haven‚Äôt went back because most my friends are on Xbox, but just play how you do on PS4 and you should be fine. People on this sub shit on console and make it seem like it‚Äôs a HUGE leap from PC, but it‚Äôs not that different from the 40 or so levels I had with it.
---
Why tf she 9??
---
But they were SO MUCH underwhelming. I mean, good DLC operator meta-wise is someone who changes SOMETHING in current metagame. If he does not, then what‚Äôs the point of DLC operator???
---
All in due time, you'll get an ace eventually. :)

It‚Äôs not like they did though. They‚Äôre all solid except the FMG9.
---
They don't actually die
---
Yeah I got shot by all of my team round before and before that round I was shot because an asshole wanted the defuser but didn‚Äôt even tell me that he/she wanted it
---
I believe they said that the matches are theoretical training scenarios for the R6 Unit.
---
G I V E M E Y O U R V I T A M I N S
---
Accurate meme.
---
Did... did you reinforce kid's room?
---
Doc
---
I know but when you get griffed 3 rounds it sucks
---
I good doc can be better but most just hog heals rook will always help the team out
---
Don‚Äôt tell me what i want.
---
Thank god I'm not the only one Thinking this.
---
I only reinforced the walls that led to closet
---
Thank you tell me if u want me to post all the library :3
---
Or pick shotgun finka to support the fun
---
I understand it as a joke but why tk or kick the 5th person if they don‚Äôt want to join?
---
*made in heaven
---
It's insane, I saw it on a youtube video and instantly bought kaid, mained him since, the thing is unreal. His smg got buffed last season too and he's a really good op since I think :)
---
Goyo got the shotgun too which is fun
---
It places a hex on the other 4 and youre doomed to fail the round
---
Rook, can‚Äôt even count how many gunfights I‚Äôve won because of his plates. Also he has impact grenades.
---
What do you mean shotgun changes? Aren‚Äôt they only to the Ela shotgun?
---
You throw hate at every post bruh leave us alone lol
---
#REVOLVERS AND THE DEAGLE SHOULD BE FULL PENETRATION!
---
Nice, defo the right move. 2400 is still very high. Like I said, it will feel weird but try some T-Hunts to get some practice with just the movement and ads speed to start and then slowly work through live games and see how you feel. If it doesn't feel right, do not worry and feel free to change to what works. just find what fits you.
---
Ok weeb.
---
Nah.
---
Just because something is anime styled doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs loli. I don‚Äôt know what kind of kids you hang around that have big anime tiddies
---
This just happened to me and now I need to switch schools.
---
uWUuuuuuuuUuuuuuUuu
---
Great minds think alike.
---
Again, who the actual fuck is asking for this? A couple of coppers?
---
i feel like honestly it's made my plays way better. i frag more on my main with elites than my smurf without em.
---
and before anyone says it, the situations arent singleplayer
---
* *Ahem* * *Ubisoft**
---
Interesting. Maybe they'll do a rollup-door that only teammates can pass through, perhaps by meleeing it. Even stronger if it could also be opened via bullet, so they could open it from a distance for a surprise attack.
---
Just from my own experience, Rook. Because he has active utility. He already has his protection for him and his teammates built in, so it‚Äôs not a big deal if you die. Overall a Rook is better for your team

---
Well I won‚Äôt stop you from that!
---
Damn all these terrible people who watch anime are ruining my perfectly balanced lifestyle that gets wrecked as soon as i see an anime artwork. 
---
Also probably never seen a "young teenager" if you think this looks like one.
---
Thank you Loopy!
---
I remembered when they promised to not have 3 speed ACOG but here we are with their BS... And yeah, i cant wait to get spawned killed by vigil 
---
"... should not affect the overall performance of this weapon." My ass
---
Learn the to recognise the different operators and how they are countered
---
The P226 is a solid secondary anyway
---
U guys have no clue how valuable castles utility is if used correctly
---
Kali seems a bit strong with that rifle they have, they have a decent secondary as well. So I think its gonna be a bit of a mixed bag with them and Jaeger 2.0 who I expect will be locked in pretty much every match.
---
I haven‚Äôt played since before Smoke‚Äôs was released. Why is it controversial?
---
It‚Äôs the Kar98k sound from CODüòÖ I add a little bass and double stack the audio get a really impactful hit
---
It‚Äôs the way to go! Premiere pro is my go to!
---
Alright then get to diamond and you could be good enough. Although getting into esports is really difficult even if you are amazing
---
Ubi said they nerfed it cause it was too good on console low rank matches.
---
No.       Fucking ew
---
Man tell me about it i have about 400hrs on xbox..my glacier skin and old pro league skins are there!!!.... and switched to pc about 1.5 year ago.. (just hit 2000 hours)..
---
You see, there is this thing called a joke and what he was doing was making a joke
---
How is this overly sexualized tho?
---
And Recruit gets bad company.
---
I fucking love the gign shotty without the vertical grip
---
His pick rate is kinda low already and with Kali being able to do what he does more times it could go down even more so I'd say he needs it, I personally love Thatcher though
---
&gt; not draw something better than what looks like an overly sexualized 16 year old loli?
---
ITT: Bunch of virtue signaling boomers who can't possibly fathom that *a videogame forum on the internet* has a lot of 16-20 year olds.
---
And it's not like developers don't encourage this sort of thing to that demographic. Overwatch literally has a questionable looking 18 year old girl running around in a school uniform. R6: Siege has anime chibis of every character.
---
He was talkin about ela... Why u suddenly talkin about kaid ??? Wut??
---
i mean you could just look at a map of the map but nothing is better then hands on
---
Watch youtubers
---
Terrorist hunt on lowest difficulty. 
---
Or go to custom with a friend 1v1 and you both can practice a lot
---
If I had a map, that would be great!
---
It will likely be broken at pro play though...but I guess we‚Äôll have to see
---
Nah that guy is just retarded
---
Thanks man, totally forgot I can play custom...
---
Difference is with people who play and don‚Äôt take in any information and still expect to learn the map, in comparison to people who actively pay attention within the map and learn the map. 
---
Playing isn‚Äôt a way to learn the map quickly unless you pay attention...which sounds obvious but more people than you think actually don‚Äôt pay attention and then moan about a map they haven‚Äôt bothered to learn
---
Sector is clear *boom* NOT CLEAR NOT CLEAR
---
Who uses that tho
---
Subbed, my YT is Kyle Jack
---
Good sausage
---
I mean they are adding a sniper that can shoot through deployable shields
---
I appreciate your flair so god damn much
---
Yeah, I definitely try to memorize spots
---
nice
---
So many of the operators could have a stand... I think Ubisoft copied araki
---
*Nice*
---
People that have black ice on that and not R4
---
Personally I find that the community is not as bad as people make it out to be. You run into bad apples, sure but as long as you don't feed the trolls or be overtly aggro then I find I can get along fine with most players.
---
Hidden MMR system on casul.
---
On lower MMR you get matched against high lv people that don't play casul much and have the starting hidden MMR and on the other end of the stick you got high MMR on casul.
---
Me
---
Spots, angles, entrance points, common anchor spots, vertical play etc
---
Ok, but the meme states that Ash needs ACOG.
---
She has an ACOG. 
---
The meme is incorrect.
---
The argument was not, "well who uses that?".
---
Where do I find those? I didnt see them on his twitter
---
She cannot shoot through Deployable shields!
---
Its not just about afk, sometimes i want to be a random opp but picked out of a specific pool, not all of them. And yes i do afk a lot because we dont need to stare at the fucking op select screen and loading screens between plotting and planning, sometimes in casual, and old up: its not that deep.
---
She can, didn't you see it?
---
Am I just lucky because I havent seen any as of late?
---
Consept
---
Seen absolutely nothing on this. Evidence?
---
Her gadget can destroy the shields, but her sniper cannot penetrate it
---
?
---
I can't be bothered as im tierd af just browsing reddit but im 100% sure i saw her shoot through a shield in the gameplay video
---
Every gun gets acog but it's on the side so you have to shoot gangsta' style
---
Hello Hypn9x, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e24vrh/unjust_ban_advice_wanted/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Is it a decal or something then? 
---
Ill check the video tomorow after work and point to you what i am referring to
---
Where‚Äôs your black ice mister?
---
I‚Äôm confident she can‚Äôt. Her gadget can destroy it but her sniper cannot penetrate it
---
Terry's in Smash, now Siege?
---
Yeah good job man
---
It doesnt have aim assistance that would suck balls. Also find a sensitivity that you‚Äôre comfortable with (even if its slow) and slowly raise your ADS until you feel comfortable with the recoil control and over time youll be able to increase it until you‚Äôre faster and faster
---
Im so conflicted if i should upvote this, cuz i like it, but its got 69 upvotes...
---
Once the season passes are gone, they're gone. Best you can do is the operator bundles in game, but those won't be on sale.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the recoil on the smg
---
a minute....
---
It‚Äôs good for shotgun standards, but that‚Äôs it.  
---
It has above average range, but it‚Äôs still something you can work around if you‚Äôre aware, which you will be because they‚Äôre likely to use their pistol often, or use the shotgun itself, which is easily identifiable through sound.
---
This pleases the nut.
---
I like my coy boy hat better
---
Cool pic bro
---
It never deserves a t-bag
---
Exactly my point. All you need to do is land that first shot, or with a body spray that recoil will bring your sights straight up to the head
---
Got a 3k on plane with something sorta similar. I was Blitz and spawned on that side entrance that goes up. Three people at the door all waiting for someone. Three confused, explosive-less people who wasted their mags on my shield. Three blind, hopeful shots from my pistol, and there was only one person at that door now. A demon, who's very name brings fear amongst the upper echelons of Rainbow. 
---
His name is Blitz.
---
anyone thats getting spawnpeeked by a bosg will also get spawn peeked by the TSG or any defender with an acog. 
---
The Bosg even with the acog, is a meme at this point. Its a extremely high recoil gun with only 2 shots compared to defenders with semi automatic slug shotguns and full auto smgs with acogs.
---
Should try out hot breaching
---
I hear ya. I'd recommend trying to initiate a friendly dialogue; if that doesn't work just mute them and try to enjoy the game as much as you can :)
---
Remember- AGAM (all gamers are murderers)
---
It's official. Rainbow tweeted it earlier
---
This is basically the confirmation of the major changes that got approved after the TTS. 
---
For example, the capital fire arrow changes where shown and then added to the TTS, but on the TTS there were OP so it didnt get added to the next season build. They delayed it and added the fire arrows on the next mid season update after changing the dmg and spread.
---
thank god. i only rumn shotgun ipn kaid and goyo, and occasionally on dokkaebi/vigil, other shotguns suck
---
r/airsoftcirclejerk is leaking
---
Only to find out that she‚Äôs the real trap
---
you just answered your own question
---
I‚Äôm doing Geometry.Explain your reasoning and show your work is giving me flashbacks.
---
Also,it‚Äôs just far more feminine,and IQ looks extremely short.
---
No other way to explain it.
---
&gt;If you looked at a lake of water and called it lava, should you be locked up too?
---
Uh don't know what that has to do with anything, but I'll give you the benefit if the doubt. 
---
&gt;Why are we locking up people that clearly understand this is a drawing of a human adult and not a child?
---
Clearly you do not understand what a joke is. Here no problem I gotcha:
---
"joke /j≈çk/-noun
---
a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter..."
---
Now ain‚Äôt that right? We‚Äôre all murderers by blood, Cain, our long ancestor was the first one to kill and since then killing goes on and on. No matter the gamer on not gamer, we‚Äôre all killers
---
Sigh...
---
*unzips*
---
Thats amazing!
---
the headgear is awesome
---
That's the problem with this map.  On one thing it's hard to balance with so many breakable walls, on the other thing that what was notable about the map as well.
---
I guess so, I was just killing some time playing a casual and spawned there and heard something, I took my headphones off because I thought it was coming from my room lol.
---
Pissed ‚Äòoff‚Äô.. there was no alcohol involved :p
---
Hey man thanks you too!!
---
I fell out of siege cause of my college-work transition so hopefully I get back into it ok lol
