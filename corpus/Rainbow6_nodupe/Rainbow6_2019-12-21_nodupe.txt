Thank you for being wholesome and helpfull
---
---
---
Thats just telling people how trash or good you are
---
I suppose yes...
---
but- the kapkan would blow up all the other traps :(
---
On console she is basically a handicap to the team since her smg is uncontrollable but on pc I think it’s a lil more usable. With all that being said I guess it would be hard to balance her cuz if they make her smg some what better on console then it’d prob be broken on pc. But yeah I agree with u she should 100% get impact grenades
---
This is fantastically great
---
Cheaters still exist but less so in the DDoS department due to the bans and active banning of them. Now if you're talking about M&amp;K on console, yeah, still going strong.
---
It made me laugh a lot man! Make some more of them
---
First off AMAZING!!!!  
---

---
SECOND..... am I the only one that's gonna mention the Tom &amp; Jerry Sound Effects?  
---
  
---
I absofrickingluttely love this.... thank you
---
It does
---
I've never played this game in my life and this is top comedy.
---
No please
---
I came here to mention it too! Actor is Michael McDonald from MADtv, too!
---
Y E S
---
Only gun to use it on its cavs smg main weapon
---
Cavs smg it’s a must for me
---
It's an online game so... Yes. Duh
---
I already have her but you're right, she's one of top 3 attacker choices
---
I had an idea once that she is the daughter of Sam Fisher and that if they were to do another Splinter Cell the main character you play as should be her and not only this will make Splinter Cell fans happy but Rainbow fans too since she will get more lore.
---
Sure is
---
It's so interesting to see when there is o ly one dude left and my team goes like if they are training for a marathon, never saw so much ppl running around a map for so long
---
Your entire team left?
---
Oh it’s casual
---
Online game doesn't equal cheaters.
---
Yeeees, and It Will be something different. Imagine you be able to play a r6 character that fit perfectly another game
---
Is anyone else thinking this is tom and Jerry?
---
Well as it’s objectively wrong, yes.
---
Tachanka kappapride?
---
Why can't someone like you ever be on my team, my teams tend to tell me a room is secure just to watch me run in and get gunned down so they know if its safe to proceed or not lmao.
---
Yes, actually it does.
---
Why does this look like Vegas 2?
---
Holy shit I laughed
---
r/mildlypenis
---
 I think ubi is slowly caring for console more which is good because they used to not give a fuck about us for so long. They’ll figure something out in the future I think but it won’t be some time soon imo
---
Top notch use of Tom&amp;Jerry. That was awesome, aside from being nostalgic.
---
Basically after each match you earn renown. Renown is how you purchase ops, you typically earn 200-400 renown depending on the game type and if you have a booster which you get one of for free that you can claim through the Uplay client. I'd recommend Gold edition for the year 1 ops who are all solid and still very viable to help you learn the fundamentals of siege, plus you gain access to the year 4 pass to also have a few current ops that you can try out to see the difference and once you feel comfortable playing them.
---
You earn renown by playing the game and use the renown to buy ops.
---
I bet you play echo on attack as well.
---

Thats off tom and jerry im pretty sure
---
so its like BE from league. ty
---
That smoke is like "goddamnit guys!"
---
its like BE from league then. Probably slow as shit to force you to buy ops lol
---
Yeah that would also be good, maybe 15000 renown per season, or maybe 27,500 for 2 seasons.
---
Yup I hack the echo on the other teams Xbox
---
iS tHaT a bLitZ mAiN?
---
Exactly like BE but not as slow as siege games are MUCH faster than league games. Long time league player here, i prefer renown.
---
How do you suggest they deal with it then?
---
Happy cake day
---
Well, you’re kind of a cunt
---
kk ty. Ima get the gold edition.
---
Actually 100 percent didn't notice, also watch the clip.
---
is this based off that Tom and Jerry episode?
---
No. Wouldn’t be fun. Do you think it will be pleasant to be spawnpeaked by twitch or Kali?
---
How do you feel about the Ela nerf?
---
If you say so. Asked a simple question. He felt like talking some bs.
---
Similar to Champions in LoL, older ones are cheaper, new ones are not.
---
The two plasma pink shotguns is perfect
---
Enjoy! Keep in mind the learning curve for siege is pretty steep since its a tactical game but the community here is very helpful, don't be afraid to ask questions about how to play certain ops better or how to become a better siege player, a lot of people will definitely chime in with tips and their opinions.
---
Take someone like PriesT for example; if you report someone for having good aim and they get banned, do you think that would be a good system to have? No it would be fucking stupid. You are stupid.
---
You better have hugged that woman good before she left. That's a dope hoodie dude.

---
Well yes, but actually no
---

---
I like the idea but the defenders would be suuuuper OP
---
Unfortunately I haven’t got any of these free coins so I can only leave my respect for this as a comment: awesome :)
---
That’s why I said if you have proof, most cheaters on console have it posted in their profile or on one of their social media’s. I have a friend on console that is better than my aim on pc but he does it through joysticks. If I’m beat by being out aimed I’m fine, if I’m beat by someone cheating then it’s totally different.
---
Report, don't que with him.
---
Play with friends
---
Hey, you just have to live through it, that’s why I play with friends, it makes toxicity less of an issue
---
Ok
---
Tom and jerry are pure comedy and the memes always deliver
---
I'll rather die by a tk then to give the enemy information.
---
I think the R6 dev team had considered a dog operator, but were unsure about how the players would react to shooting a dog
---
I love it
---
Hurdur black ice good because everyone says it's good. There are better gun specific epics but because everyone made such a big deal about black ice, people treat it like it's the most amazing thing on the planet.

My favorite thing to do is reinforce the walls by the fridge in Bushranger on Outback and set up Tachankas LRG behind the open fridge door and put a shield next to the door, and have a Bandit shockwire the reinforced wall. I’ve gotten many a ace with that teq
---
&gt; Just wish those balance updates where more frequent.
---
You f****** right, my friend. Everyone of us thought that because there are reused guns every once in a while, they would put more emphasis to n balancing, but:
---
- Nøkk is untouched( the duration of gadget’s usage is pointless, and their excuse that “Nøkk is seeing some play in competitive so we wont touch her” is just a joke at this point).
---
- Amaru isn’t buffed, although it IS obvious that delay after landing is just ridiculous for competitive play.
---
- Warden isn’t receiving anything major(2/2 didn’t change much of him), although it was pointed many times by good players that his “situationality” is totally unworthy. Better pick another operator from instead all together.
---
Was about to offer the same advice ;)
---
It's 2-1 but not match point but people can vote to kick... Wtf mode is this?
---
This deserves bruh moment if the decade
---
Zironicdk is also a useful guy to look up...
---
You might have to uninstall and reinstall. That fixed it for quite a few people.
---
And who do you feel you’re best with? Or which play style do you feel you’re best at
---
Yeah, it seems fake
---
Anytime anywhere. Echo especially. I’ve heard Cav is supposed to be next but after that it’s free real estate for anybody that isn’t a year 3/4 operator.
---
Yes
---
Highly possible.
---
Good spot!
---

Amazing! Do you have a fiver account or anything?
---
People play glaz in plat ?
---
Thank you! I’m actually surprised I caught that. I think the only reason I bothered checking was because of the animation they released to promote the cosmetics. With Harry and Ash talking about being PMC and whatnot I thought back and said, “Isn’t there at least one operator that used to be in a PMC that joined Rainbow?”, and sure enough Ela was spot on. There might be others but the point was that NightHaven has potentially always been connected to Rainbow in one way or another.
---
Quick play is what it's advertised to be... Quick play. It's no competition... Just pure and simple gameplay... If you want to play comp against people of your own relative skill play ranked
---
I will k*ll you
---
She is a keeper
---
There is.
---
1- unappealing weapon.
---
2- disgusting drop off
---
3- 2 shots
---
4- kangaroo kick
---
5- you miss you die
---
416-
---
1- full auto
---
2- laser beam
---
3- guaranteed 3 shots upto 24m
---
4- 3 speed with an influential gadget
---
5- already gun is at 1.23kd, highest the game has ever seen (don't nerf it yet though, we need more data)
---
5- had acog in the past and he alongside badit DESTROYED the meta at all ranks.
---
I'm surprised I had to elaborate on what is considered common sense.
---
It looks nice, is it real??
---
I use shottie for rotations and over all utility...
---
Hate that I got his weapon skin nobody even uses it
---
Huh, Ela is my most played defender and I still maintain a really solid win rate with her.
---
&gt;Her guns need to be the first shots and first hits of a gun fight to win that fight.
---
&gt;her scorpion being random leaves no room at all to be sitting in one area where you can easily be droned.
---
I agree.
---
&gt;Using Ela as an anchor to me is down right insane.
---
I'd like to clarify what I mean by anchoring with Ela, I tend to ambush people from odd corners, I don't primarily defend site with her. [Here's a diagram](https://i.imgur.com/nIlv16X.png) showing how I typically hold an important location.
---
- The enemies are red, travelling in the direction of the arrow
---
- I am lurking at the top end of the purple line
---
1. Enemies trigger my grzmot (green star)
---
2. I peek them, take the easy 1v1, then retreat (blue arrow)
---
3. Throw down a new grzmot and do the same thing to their teammates that will inevitably chase me.
---
4. If I manage to get a second kill, I'll head back to site, since there's probably only 60-30 seconds remaining
---
I think it's unfair to call her a roamer, Vigil and Cav with their stealth-oriented abilities are more suited to traversing the map. Like I said, I sit in an important or unexpected location and use her as an ambusher. She's far from the best defender, but I think she still has her place as a useful operator in certain situations.
---
Lol
---
So it was basically long overdue for somebody to join rainbow.
---
I guess now we can somehow trace all the funding rainbow gets to Nighthaven.
---
They all ready do punish them
---
Atleast I have Black Ice for it so it doesnt look too bad on my screen. Also AUGs are beautiful guns :P
---
Rip
---
You must be having a great day with these comments, you totally deserve it!
---
You don't know if the team was shite. For all we know everybody on the team could've traded themselves for an attacker during a rush and the clip is the only thing Vigil did for the team, making him the more useless of the five and getting voted out.
---
Can't be.

---
Added to that, a friend of mine bought standard a few days ago and it shows the same 500-2000 like original game prices.
---
So either you already have one from each CTU, or have a bug.
---
Not that I care but gridlock and mozzie have one skin you can buy
---
Hear me out. What if we decrease her recoil and give her the nades back, is that a crime?

Why are you running towards the building bullheadedly without looking for free kills?

You're on Xbox, so no, he's not hacking.  The game thinks he's inside, you can tell by where his bullet tracers come from.  For him, everything is normal.
---
And the shield
---
Put a drone there then.
---
but the que times would be ridiculously insane in the higher ranks and splits up people even more. like ranked que times would probably be like unranked time.
---
  Palhasos!
---
Who do you not have?

I sense a controller
---
Amazing

You can scan like a drone, but everytime you scan, the op will bark.

It’s possible he just ignored you cuz you had your shield up, not much he could do about it
---
I choose rook and play anchor.
---
Wamai
---
If those are your friends then sure. Just dont do this to randoms you dont know, it's a dick move.
---
If only he didn’t always get banned
---
Every time. This somehow happens every time.
---
Thats the same thing i got when i got my first legendary, i have it on every gun now because that's the only charm i habe
---
You did that !
---
MAAAAATE!
---
false, there is 1 word. Potato
---
In my defense that was my first time using that gun and I play console.....
---
One Deag
---
That’s basically just battlefield bro...
---
And solo queue ranked vs squad ranked is a whole other ball park. Definitely anyone wanting to play ranked passed gold should try to find a discord community or some such to play with. The difference is night and day
---
It’s the new gun in siege
---
I try to play support attack:Thatcher,  twitch, thermite, hibana, maverick ,zofia,  buck
---
Def: mute, Kaid, mira, maestro, lesion, jager, and valk. 
---
Attack I try to stay with someone and never push a lone(cav will getcha), on defense depends on what operators I'm using but I try to anchor. If I do roam I try to stay near the other roamers so I can refrag them
---
*Laughs in dead by daylight*
---
I think a large part of the backlash on this sub is that many people here have been playing since year 1, if not pre-release. A few years ago, you would have to count your lucky stars to have a full match without the game DCing someone for a few rounds. That's not really an issue anymore (at least not as it was) but first impressions last
---
Man if only everyone else here was as smart as you are they are all saying that BI is good when they’ve probs never heard of black ice aka the actual black ice aka glacier because it’s actually black
---
Magnificent indeed
---
I did what :D
---
what did you do?
---
I've shot people by accident while they go after drones and they've shot me to death. Dude, you saw me shooting at the same fucking thing, it wasn't on purpose. It's hard enough to aim on console and then I had to worry about shooting my teammates ON ACCIDENT and getting killed right after.
---
Very epic, gamer. Who are you going to do next?
---
I bet so. I don't even touch the game without friends I can't imagine how ranked would be
---
Can they buff her smg from 23 to 26? That whould be great
---
I have the hyper x cloud 2
---
I would say it's a very solid headset.

Maybe g pro wireless headset is good to

I've just realized that it's like a reverse mouse-acceleration thing, where the faster I move my mouse the slower it seems to turn. This doesn't seem to apply to regular mouse usage, just in-game for some reason.

Took me around 540 hours for my first black ice
---
We just gonna ignore that it says prototip
---
Do you always keep holding angles or do you play more aggressive?
---
What about attack?
---
There might be but I learned through experience and also what I mean by character knowledge is just knowledge about a character weapons, flanking, speed and flank routes useful for that operator
---
Love how Cav slinks back into the room

You reposted simply for more pointless upvotes. Not much better.

I bought my zowie EC2A for 60$ full price 4 years, and i only had it spaz out once. That was fixed quickly by blowing out dust from the sensor
---
I recommend EC1A, as it's the normal sized mice of the two. EC2A is pretty big, so unless you're either 6"4 or 6" with large hands id go for EC1A.
---
No, to try and get into like coconut bruhs vid or someone like that
---
That's the legit answer ANY pro would give you.
---
Game sense.
---
Knowing where somebody would commonly push from or spawn. Sound whoring, cams, **callouts**, etc.. basically, game sense.
---
Pengu has 12k hours, Beaulo has some 7k, godly around that much. Compare those many hours worth of experience with that of yours, and then you'll know the gaps you need to fill.

So you want to give Tachanka an ACOG while make kapkan suffer being 1 speed again ? no thanks

Why not give Tachanka Fuze's AK-12 instead ?

As bundle with a shitty charm 860 I think. I only bought the skin for 680? Forgot the exact price.
---
Attacking - Hibana Type 89 , high rate of fire , moderate damage and the lightweight feel that I can’t find with any other gun 
---
Defense - Alibi Mx4 Storm , high rate of fire , high damage , high magazine size and alibi is a 3 speed with impacts .
---
What’s not to love?
---
It's probably the strongest swear word in England.
---
I see, thank you! So in my understanding holo and Acog will have the same feel although not the same 360 distance? I thought they were the same, but the recoil made it look rather different, as I’m a holo main. Good to know, just trying to stay consistent.
---
Thank you very much for the detailed answer!
---
*Crying in damage*
---
How about we just make him a hard core fragger and should they try smoke plant he would be just a little more useful...
---
i just want to add that PMM fires rounds that barely penetrate basic body armor so it should do minimal damage to anyone wearing basic armor.
---
Hello suckingpp, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/edoqqu/we_need_to_stop/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
the bullet is actually bigger than the 9x19mm clocking in at around 9.3mm iirc because "big boolet, big damage"
---
Well 50 Beowulf is not as powerful as 50 BMG
---
Those laughs at the end, this was funny as F. More, more.
---
Its not integrally supressed.
---
I wish this game had the realism to make 9mm rounds do almost no damage through body armor unless you completely unloaded your mag.
---
I know but its still a .50 damnit.
---
Well...not entirely.
---
Anybody that understands that lion need a change has positive iq, so that's ok
---
I have downvoted you
---
*tssss*
---
I think the style doesn't fit with siege, yet despite that, or maybe precisely for that, it feels great, recognizable yet distinct! please be sure to always include a link back in your future posts so to be able to catch up if I miss one! Love it
---
Some major people are leaving but no the entire core isn’t.
---
Leaver and deranked huh? People like you ruin the game.
---
Maybe they have armor piercing rounds in all their 9mm guns then it would destroy basic body armor on the first bullet.
---
Was that loss in the back?
---
As someone who has seen how fucking dangerous the scorpion is when someone who can use it has it I would say that it is useable and if you take the time to master it it is still extremely amazing, even if it does not have the range as some other smgs
---
Just tell them you're experiencing high pings in all of your games (don't mention only siege) or they will try to give you the bullshit excuse that the problem is with the servers.
---
They will ask you for trace results to check the routing and such but first just send them a simple mail.
---
If you held a poll to ALL rainbow six siege players, I believe that they would keep it in the game. Especially towards the more experienced side, who the dev team should focus on more so that this game remains and grows as an esport.

Your starting mmr is mid silver 1. It just doesn’t show it as a rank until you have played 10 games. If you go to [r6tracker](https://r6.tracker.network) it will show you your mmr even if you haven’t completed your placements. What about what I said isn’t true?
---
Frost for the utility burn and good flex op
---
Jackal has a good gun, smokes, soft destruction, and can find roamers
---
That did not need 23 seconds
---
Not really an easter egg
---
AFAIK it has less powder in the cartridge and thus, making it just a tad bit weaker. Not a significant difference by any margin.
---
Please, do correct me if I'm wrong.

Level is completely irrelevant to the ranking system.

It's significantly more powerful than 9x18 Makarov.
---
I don't want Tarkov's leg meta to be in R6.
---
Yeah but new players are more income to them. Seems advantageous to maintain a middle ground between both converting new players to vets. And honestly I think friendly fire would be gone if we ever held that poll. Nothing more stupid and unrealistic than your teammate knee capping you 3 times because you took rook. Seriously try and bring 2 new players into the game and explain why they get tked 5 times a day for no reason. It's just hilarious for trolls and seems ubisoft hasn't cared for years. I mean seriously how hard is it to have a "realistic" mode for players who like it. Literally all the toxicity could be moved away from the general population of your game and avoided. Instead its embedded in every fiber of your game.
---
No.
---
I see no problems here
---
Sometimes you die too if you're not fast enough...
---
It's alright. Tachanka is funny but that just completely f'd me up. Idky
---
Stop complaining and get over it. They’re glorified Alpha Packs, if you don’t get what you want in a regular Alpha Pack, you wouldn’t complain like this.
---
I'm glad to hear you at least get where I'm coming from. I wish I had a montage of some of the shit that went on tonight. If a fella, this platinum 2 for example, can sit at a wall and randomly start firing for a headshot, he shouldn't be matched with me. I play souls I understand the "git gud" mentality but how are we supposed to learn if dude can literally pre fire us through walls before we get a chance. And what can I tell the new players on the team? "Oh just some platinums probably gonna warm up on is again all night". Just seems like ubisoft expects everyone to start out like shroud on r6
---
oorr u see lasers trough a drone hole and like i always do u run into them just barely and run out again and an attacker dies
---
Well the BOSG is a never used gun while Tachanka is a never used operator. Same as the 9x19vsn. Everyone who uses Tachanka is just to meme or some strat. They would just anchor in the obj and only use their smg. The SASG-12 is used more than the 9x19vsn. So only the BOSG deserves some special treatment?
---
I know it's sow weird, I was avke to get rare fuze outfot but my brother cant get his
---
He could also attack at the same time his teammates are attacking instead of placing a claymore at his own entrance so he can trade out his teammate, but we can clearly see this is at a very low skill level so why bother with things that could've been better.
---
You already can I just did it like 3 days ago
---
Well done mate (:
---
Thanks mate :)
---
Wholesome enough to take my upvote
---
I'm decent at the game but probably cant even hold a 1.0 Kd. rolling with 3 other noobs and tonight in specific was plat after plat after plat. In the same regard of getting my ass kicked wont it eventually put me with the same type of people? If ubisoft has any type of "hidden mmr" in casual it can obviously see we're all scrubs.
---
shield ops’ lives don’t matter
---
I think that the main problem is that unpredictable lateral recoil
---
Except the dumb hall of mirrors "strat" (which is the only time where it matters if alibi has the skin or not) hasnt worked on anyone paying attention since a month after she released. If you chuck your holograms in high traffic areas such as commonly shot walls and windows, youll still get pings without the skin mattering. The vast majority of the time, if the hologram gets shot it was going to be shot regardless of its or alibis skin.

Yeah you only can buy them. Besides the first free one

tbh i find the fun in siege through playing the mental chess game of where they are going to be (especially on the offsite) and how to atk it
---
Calculated.
---
Plat 3 (Barely getting higher than that) 
---
I was just wondering how is SASG-12 is used more than 9x19vsn
---
Well over watch doesn’t have fifty odd walls per map that could be potentially destroyed ten different times in a game that would have to be replicated for the replays.
---
Looks liks Valkyrie is Emilia Clarke.
---
Was this in copper or on console oh wait probably both ;) nice play dude gg
---
thats the point of the idea fuckhead
---
You can do that just fine in the regular game for a few bucks

More works AND FULL PIC you can be found here: insta - Cpt.Markizi | twi - Area\_the\_Fox :)
---
Whenever team-mates let me I remove the top half of that entire wall and place frost traps hidden by the lower half. Lots of attackers just vault over it. It somehow feels safe to them or something, I guess they suppose that wall got exploded and that would've cleared any traps.
---
sounds like vulkan-1.dll is missing from your device . Download it and copy paste it to your system32 and systemWOW
---
Toxic
---
Straight facts
---
Yeah I got baited and killed by a claymore once. I just typed "slow clap" into the all chat lol.
---
If they spawn peek . I spawn peek back using Tachanka for maximum toxicity

@firefly_FRV damn didn't think of that

Try putting most of the settings at high, and turn off ambient occlusion and everything below it. Once you click apply, click the benchmark button at the bottom of the menu.
---
Ok what scale and resolution should i use?
---
The main thing for me is, that our beloved developers understands the community. Memes and shit. And they know what they're doing. It really scares me.
---
So like lesion then? I guess that’s okay, my only complaint would be it cluttering the screen, but if you make it optional then I don’t see the harm.
---
Does the bulletproof vest work too?
---
How the fuck does me having a blitz main flair make me a garbage player? Honestly, shut the fuck up and give constructive criticism. You're being a fucking dick
---
Easy there vader
---
I thought you were on your drone for a second
---
Well if you mean I can holster a pistol and hold extra magazines then yes
---
i just want them to fix their game;-;
---
Ha ha funny pp ha ha so funny
---
What a play
---
Wouldn't mind playing this....except sledge one.
---
As a hammer user in forging, and knowing that Sledge's hammer is basically a forging hammer that's harder but with a lighter handle, hammers CANNOT break forged steel reinforcements.
---
Yes! of course it should be optional
---
She looks so masculine and feminine at the same time
---
Yes, those where just examples... Do I really need to do a full list?

Damn.....
---
This picture is getting VERY popular VERY quickly.

Cause this is the 3rd post today.

You being a soyboy on this Reddit with this flair already gives me a good indication. But if you want to proof me wrong you can show me some gameplay.
---
What's pp?
---
Come on,balance isn’t *that* bad.
---
Course you have some underpowered and S-tier hero’s,but no game is perfectly balanced.
---
Well yeah forgot about the 10% thing, my bad
---
Good job, does it stop the bullets your shooting too?
---
Yo what was the glitch?
---
You proved yourself wrong by unironically using the word soyboy
---
Excellent question
---
Link?
---
I was during prep phase.same spot. View remained the same during the match
---
Buy the credits and buy the yr2 ops individually then
---
Lol you rlly are a pos. You were the one that said my flair makes me bad. Honestly, don't reply if you're just going to be a dick
---
if memory serves, this was mid blood orchid
---
First off search it up pc has more players and secondly it can fight at mid range wtf u talking about there’s been basically no change to the shotgun at all I get many kills at a medium range
---
A lack of developed attack strats does not mean a map is defender sided. You want a map that's defender sided, look at Outback. L hallways are fine, you just need to control the other ends of them. Just like you need to control run outs when fighting CEO on Consulate. There are 5-6 calls for the entirety of hamman hallway, which is fine. That hiding spot under the stairs is harry potter, fyi. Another thing I also said, every site has verticality. You can make the bedroom mira untenable to hold with crossfire. 
---
As for being in ranked and not in pro league, THIS SEASON is when they removed sky from ranked. Chalet is still in despite having a grand total of ZERO good bomb sites. Theme Park was in until it got reworked. PL has a basically nonexistent rotation, since there's only like 7 maps they use, the newest of which is Villa, which is eternally funny to me considering Reddit hates that map too. It's an extremely high bar for maps in PL. I mean, shit. House, Plane and old Hereford being in ranked and/or PL at one point should tell you everything you need to know about Ubi's decision making with that.
---
Buddy, I've got over 1300 hours on this game and I still feel that way sometimes. Getting spawnpeeked is the most painful way to learn a lesson but 9 times out of 10 you won't fall for that peek for a while. Like everything else in the game, it's a learning process. Don't worry about it too much, and if you are, just let someone else run out of spawn first
---
As for your map learning, what I still do is Lone Wolf t-hunt a single map until I feel satisfied with it. I really enjoyed plane, so I set my preferences to plane only and warmed up with plane T-hunt every time, so now I have greater command of the map. Next I did, fortress, then villa, and cycled through every one I needed work on until finally learning whatever reworked map comes out each season. It helped my aim (pistol rushing with a 3-speed really helps reflexes and headshots) and learning the map at the same time
---
Ouchie
---
I was during prep phase. same spot. View remained the same during the match
---
Well, there is a 2 second delay, and it’s only really frustrating to the new uninitiated players, and plain bad players. 😂
---
Joking aside, it’s not a big deal the more experienced you get. While yes the defenders have a majority advantage, I’d argue that spawnpeeking doesn’t add to that. Rather, it’s a risk that they can choose to take, which if works, does as an advantage. But that’s only *IF*.
---
Attackers can still counter it easily, that being through two ways. One is experience that you will gain over time, naturally. The other is your drone.
---
As a Veteran player, the biggest piece of advise I give to you for attacking, is to never underestimate the power of your drone. Many say it’s the most overpowered tool that is available to the attackers, and you can use this to spot out defenders trying to spawnpeek.
---
So I disagree that it should be removed. It is a viable, if risky strategy, that is only easier with a few operators. Stick with it, and it should just be something that you naturally get rid of.
---
see who?
---
What would happen of the fully blocked recruit from ranked, what would people without operators do?
---
That's the opposite though. Lower FOV would be slower, higher FOV would be faster
---
Wow, you're a condescending prick.
---
If Alibi is as bad as you say, nobody would play her. She has nothing on other defense operators, specifically Ela.
---
El's shotgun is better. Her SMG is better. Her gadget is, according to you, better. They're both 3 speed. Her pistol has a red dot.
---
You're gonna kill this game, by the way. So, you know. Enjoy that.
---
Yikes guess thats why im still a buck main
---
Oh shit, me too.
---
Oh sweet i was the 69th guy to give a silver.
---
Man, I love this game and all but boy is the community toxic sometimes. I bet he's the type of player to scream over comms and vote kick people the second they die or make a mistake.
---
Give Buck a chance? He's already very firmly one of the strongest attackers in the game and well within the meta.
---
I knew I shouldn't have answered.
---
You may end up Biting the Dust
---
Map preferences is for t-hunt
---
It’s their precious k/d on the line. You come across these players higher up in the ranks, more reason as to why k/d doesnt matter in this game.
---
Yes, when one dies from a Sheer Heart Attack, one Bites the Dust.
---
This reminds me of [this video](https://youtu.be/hE-ZmwATS8E)
---
Nah
---
Maybe
---
Ima try that

Think I got lucky that the Mozzie was killed by a Claymore when he tried to run out.

i guess i can do this

---
That’s next on the list
---
Yeah im close to plat and this happens quite often. I wish ubi did something to prevent this
---
I can relate to that🤣, it’s really all about awareness and if you have decent teammates that will check cams for you. I always play ranked, but every time I play casual I just shit on everyone. Helps me stay sane on the game
---
Reason?
---
 Right click task bar
---
Open task manager
---
Right click r6 (or any other game/program) 
---
-&gt; go to details

Above normal usually works better to me but find it out yourselfe

I did in high school. I do more sketching than painting

This now just needs music to dub over

Thanks :)

It'll sting a lot &gt;:)
---
Ah sorry, didn’t have audio on
---
I have an RTX 2060 and Ryzen 7 2700x and I'm consistently over 200FPS. 
---
Although I don't play on ultra settings.
---
High for textures and everything else is medium or low for the slight advantage.
---
And I use a 16:10 aspect ratio.
---
Why use cardboard? Get yourself something durable enough to last.
---
Same, thats me at the moment taking a painting class but prefers drawing and sketching.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Yeah as i said in the comments my brown marker screwed it up (a Promarker ,if you wanna know)
---
*cries in Caveira main*
---
*prays for you*
---
it's a multiplayer game. If the players are boring, you've got to play another game.
---
Kafe Rework was good, Outback was good as well
---
Ready for company
---
I do believe that’s because Dokk is Echos ex girlfriend, and she called him so much that he ditched his phone. At least I think that’s the story
---
Hmm makes sense I played just casual mode and it’s to toxic. I’ll try rank reinstalling the game now.
---
Ok, I appreciate the quick reply
---
Next level Nintendo labo
---
You were probably already dead, and ypur client didn't get the message yet.
---
TBF when you’re speedpeeking/prefiring you’re gonna shoot at the first thing you see
---
Probably, still got the job done, plus was panicking as they knew I was in that room (apart from the Maestro who was looking the complete wrong way), and I am trying to improve my aim while using an Acog as I don't normally.
---
I declare this tread to be used for suggestions.
---
I suggest a C75 Auto, is a small gun and fairly easy?
---
Listen dude, I'm too lazy to talk about how wrong you are. If you want to show me your credibility, link me your account to show your stats. Maybe that will add some weight to your words
---
Yeah that one is even better

Nøkk I think? If her HEL was activated
---
That fmg9 be lookin fire
---
One of the few maps where the outcome is almost entirely based on which team has more skill. No real advantage for the defense or the attack
---
kid i’m shit at the game lol, just pointing out how you didn’t see the whole match and how you don’t know what happened

how about you link your account and prove ur not still workin on copper?

This was beyond great. Definitely didn’t think it would turn into a nostalgic trip back to Tom and jerry
---
is the fmg9 foldable?
---
Same
---
I believe so, but only after they joined, shot two of our teammates and then blew themselves up. Theyre using this method because they knew if they did it again they'd be the ones getting banned lmao. I also shot one of them after they did this to our teammate, i can post that video too :D (Hold up i gotta go send it from my console to my one drive)
---
Lol, it makes no sense. They should be just as capable as xbox players 😂

Omg these look amazing

so? I still wouldn't solo q lol

Jeez. See I don't understand why you're even talking when you don't know what's going on. You don't need to see the full match, the video is enough to see what's going on. My uplay name is jerrwoow. Go look it up

i hit plat 3 already only solo que. and i always get pretty high in plat by myself. and i got ranked silver 1. solo q isn’t bad lol
---
How do we know that they have more players tho?

Thermite big fucking hole

Amazon boxes, old moving boxes, pretty much any kind of cardboard that I could find
---
Still waiting on my 150k+ renown refund
---
I prefire everything, cant tell you how many random kills iv gotten running to obj and shooting a door or window catching someone. Its happen to me as well tho.
---
Yeah, it was pretty clear they just failed to meet the deadline for S2 and turned it into a PR move.
---
The people that say that are prolly plats or smurfs that ruin casul / unranked.
---
That shit of "git gud" and "deal with it" make me angry lmao, nobody is having fun on the receiving end of those matches.
---
And the "you learn playing against better players" isn't applicable here where high ranks on casul / unranked only know to spawnpeek / runout / rush, it gets hella boring and annoying playing against them.
---
That’s actually rlly cool 😎
---
Someone asked for an fal And also a vector but this should be next

I see a condom

I thought Mozzie’s logo was a vulture for the longest damn time.

What do you think your next weapons gonna be? Or are you satisfied with these ones
---
Yes untill it broke too much and I got tired of fixing it
---
lol yes, yes it is, the odds are way against you. throwers, playing stacks, being matched with like 85% of people that aren't ever going to get to plat
---
Thanks man!
---
Oh sorry
---
Very impressive. Reminds me of when I'd build guns out of legos when I was little. Santa will definitely be putting you on the top of the nice list for Christmas this year. Have a great Christmas!
---
Also you're trying to bring intelligence into this but your only comeback is "you're too retarded to understand (x)" which really shows that you think everyones too stupid to understand what you see when really you could explain it to them if you were more intelligent. But you lack any basic human interaction so you have no social skills because you self project on people and say that they are an embarrassment everywhere and you could teach them how not to be one on siege but that's exactly what is for you isnt it? You only feel good about yourself on siege and that's why you cant handle others having a contradicting opinion. Sad. I wish you luck. I wont reply. Hope you get better man.
---
Edit: contradicting
---
Hah, you thought your life would be completed by JoJo, but it was *I,*

Tf does this have to do with siege?

it has about 19 recoil.
---
Does the FMG fold?
---
Go back to r/memes peasant
---
That’s a lot of recoil
---
Tachanka: let them come
---
This guy is a legend
---
Save the pussy for the rest of us man
---
How is recoil measured and what’s the highest and lowest.
---
You keep telling yourself the same lie over and over and you'll eventually belief it. You have slipped away and there's no hope in bringing you back to the light. Rest in piece.
---
Very rare
---
Beautiful
---
Oh no there will still be screaming. First time playing this game is rough.
---
yeah, almost like your population
---
Compared to the smg-11, I’d say 17. But I’ll agree with 19 too.
---
I haven't played him recently but something to think about lol
---
And then there's this virgin
---
Im usually Gold 3 so I probably don't qualify for the smart player category lol thx for the tips tho
---
I do this with Vulcan shields so the idiot coppers team kill each other
---
It used to actually, what happened was that the system kept breaking and I could never get it to fold consistently without human intervention so I decided to just keep the stock rigid. But i didn’t lack on the details, with how the holo, suppressor, and magazine are removable and the charging handle thingy moves properly
---
Nah man, I just find this stuff fun
---
I'm happy that a shield skin chat turned into a glaz and castle discussion lol this is Reddit for you I love it 😂
---
Have any ideas by chance? I like to pick other people's mind over this game
---

---
What currency does INR abbreviate?
---
What tf happened in S1 and S2 then?
---
What should be in place of the 3 ops we would get then? Just curious
---
Paint them?
---
I did offer the guy some coaching but he's insecure about himself so he refused. There's no way to explain siege on fucking Reddit like this and you should know that
---
You got a DeviantArt we can follow you on? :D
---
YES
---
Of course you put a acog on the p90 you toxic fuck
---
check out Frost with the proper trigger discipline.
---
I haven't had mira for very long, and that happened to me in a ranked match like 5 minutes ago, so is this a new bug or what?
---
I find it easy switching from console to pc, but I always make sure to play a few Terrorist Hunt missions before I play matches
---
idc what it’s for, if it’s a black ice then i’m in
---
Nice
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Steam. Would opening with Uplay make a difference?
---
How do i go about doing that?
---
Thanks. This is gonna help me.
---
It would be through your bank. Just tell them ubi never followed through on their end
---

Ah yes i see the interrogation process has affected your mental capacity

Hi. Go get laid.

That's an incredible coincidence

This has got to be  sarcastic.

Damn, tough luck
---
No, I personally don't even like the Black Ice skin anyways.
---
MPX
---
I want to see better original skins. Im sick of hearing about black ice 2.0 and putting black ice on new guns. Dont get me wrong, i like the skin. Its nice, but i want ubi to come out with new skins that look amazing like they used to.
---
I would even dare to say it’s legendary
---
Ethernet will help a lot more than wireless
---
Like to see you have the actual model of lesion’s gun
---
Itd be a shame if somebody, ya know, tripped with a glass of water ;)
---
Seriously though, great work
---
I play on both platforms and encounter screaming kids on PC far more frequently than I do on xbox. Plus there's always the mute button.
---
Plus, it's only one player out of millions. Did you really think you were going to run into him?
---
you have to change your uplay location to wherever you want languages from. It's kind of an annoying process but doable. google it. then reinstall the game (it installs the new language packs) and in game change it over to it when its reinstalled.
---
You just gonna start shooting people in a knife fight? Shame
---
It's a micro-transaction skin if that's what you mean
---
Yeah I figured I guess I’ll stick to Xbox until I can get a better computer. Thanks tho!
---
Really, did I get lucky?

This is still the start of the season. There are many valid reasons for starting a smurf account, some of which I have listed elsewhere on the thread. People are still getting their ranks. I understand that it can be frustrating to go up against people who are much better than you, and it happens to me occasionally too. You need to stop thinking of rank as a reward for winning but rather as a matchmaking aid that allows you to enjoy the game at your own level. Unfortunately there are problems with any system. Stop dismissing people who own more than one account as “scummy” when you have no idea why they created the account.

Anyway what is the point of complaining? What could Ubisoft do about it?

Try and work on your aim and your gamesense. Practicing in terrorist hunt is a good one for this. Until then, play support operators. That way you can help your team without fragging out
---
Not bad kid
---
Out of all the things to make out of cardboard. Where is blackbeards shield?
---
#recruitlore 😔✌️
---
I think it’s an inevitable thing with a game as competitive as it is
---
I think it’s inevitable with a fame as competitive as siege
---
Have they not fixed this yet?
---
The one above the deagle in the bottom left corner
---
waits, thats illegal
---
Very recently
---
Oh god no
---
Play unranked or quick match then, I find it more fun than ranked unless I'm playing with a whole squad.
---
I guess all I can do now is complain how that's a wack pool of maps, it seems to favour the gigantic maps over the smaller, more tightly designed ones
---
I remember playing the Beta when it was just all House all the time... what a dream it would be to go back to that
---
They really REALLY love giving Hibanna red and white coloured content don’t they. Mix it up a little ubi man
---
Link your channel if your thinking about making the vids cause I’m hella down
---
House, Hereford, and plane aren’t in the ranked map pool. Chalet and Oregon are though. 
---
As much as the classic maps are cool for older players some of them are not really representative of what the dev team thinks of as “competitive” maps. Basically your options for carrying out strategies those maps are extremely limited and don’t allow for flexible gameplay. The bigger maps that have been added in like villa and clubhouse offer a better variety of potential strats. They’re a pain in the ass to learn because of their size but once you know the layout it’s not bad
---
Look in the observation tools section of keybinds you may figure it out
---
Oddly enough that only happens to me in casual
---
Not so greta for ms. Thunberg bro
---
Or you know, actual guns lol
---
Well i play fair so i won't just wanted to ask
---
*peaks through window on objective seeing Jaeger* OwO what's this?
---
No it doesnt.
---
We all get lucky every one in a while... some more than others though
---
Since there’s no acog on jagger gun can you put it if you ever make it.
---
Just was curious don't worry i play fairly even if i am bad haha
---
Hhhmm will consider haha
---
You should make a niche out of this man, call yourself CardboardArsenal, CardboardArmory, something like thag
---
there is one
---
Clubhouse is okay, I think I can say I actively dislike Villa
---
Also like... I totally get that for Ranked, but it's straight up stupid to not have all the maps in Quick Play
---
Even if a map is SO broken it shouldn't be in either, it still makes no sense as to why Chalet and Oregon aren't in Quick Play
---
Of course youre not allowed to play the game the way you enjoy it you annoying fuck
---
you missed. even if you connected the arm you would not have downed him.

Think you read my thing wrong I wasnt tryna be rude but okay
---
Yeah, I've been feeling a lot of this the past week.
---
I was convinced that these claymores never actually worked
---
elite icons would be sick
---
This happens a lot with me, It don't stress me anymore. Btw you're a nokk main, I love she, can you give me some hints? How to play with her right etc?
---
Dude said the cosplay was cringy and bad
---
Nintendo labo would like to get in touch with you
---
Air soft fight! Him~
---
Gotta hate being like “oh no I’m here I’m sorry im here it’s okay if I get votekicked” or it’s the last round and there’s only 2 or 3 total people in your team and you get clapped immediately
---
all the people in stacks are ranked stars. they aren’t any good, i face against stacks all the time and always stomp them
---
current Glaz is pretty good.
---
I never said you sat behind your screens too much, all I said was that you people need to stop being such jerks and screaming at me for making a simple mistake, I had no idea I’ll do better next time just stop resorting to such profane terms.
---
I fully get what you are saying but I wish the stereo type of "toxic spawnpeeking jäger reeee" would die already. Ever since his acog removal I rarely see him used to spawn peek I instead see more doc or rooks spawn peeking
---
It is never too late
---
Why not include kill camera? That's all I wanted to see.
---
They’re just trying to make the map pool smaller for new players. The game has changed a lot, there are way more operators and maps to learn. There’s just way too much for a brand new player to jump into. It does kind of suck for some of the older players who want that nostalgia kick
---
A long year? It took me a few seasons *without buying a single one.*  
---
Not really worth applauding for since it took you that long while also having the ability to buy them shouldn't have taken that long.
---
aw yeah
