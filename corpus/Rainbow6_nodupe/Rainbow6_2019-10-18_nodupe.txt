It was released months ago. Search "Rainbow Six Hammer and Scalpel". You'll find it.

This was on the old version as well.

It‚Äôs a copypasta

Caviera is an amazing operator, if you have good teammates calling out, combine that with a valk or an echo, ez interrogations, sure, her pistol nerf was a lil tuff but overall great weapon.
---
Vila is repeatedly played on proL with no complains about the map. If you consistently have issues with the map thats something on your end.
---
I mean the Sona seems kinda cute so I'm debating being careful lol
---
It's a model of the map Yacht that got deleted from casual this season
---
I LEGIT forgot that was a map oml
---
What website is that?
---
recruit should be top tier
---
Where is tachanka?
---
The tec-9 all though looks cool has a history of jamming. Maybe give it to amaru. She can't even afford armor or her own guns. Give her this cheap gun to show off
---
Where's Speedwagon
---
Maestro 
---
Because trapping and zapping them is fun
---
The tec 9 isn't even a sub machine gun, the bizon is fine other than it being front heavy and shooting 9x18
---
Twitch didn‚Äôt do 17 km of internal wiring to be ranked under Mira.
---
What are you sorting it by?
---
Woah woah woah, Valk should at least be A tier, I want my skull to be crushed by Barbarian Womans thighs
---
Thanks for the comment lol
---
Yiff in hell
---
downvoted for shotgun use.
---
Ah yes PP90M1 MW3 flashbacks that gun CLAPPED cheeks tantamount to the ACR 6.8 before nerf.
---
Agreed

Usually works for me.

And don't fucking name your video after what happens in one 30 second clip out of a hundred.
---
"Epic Amaru ace, so overpowered!" and it's about 11.4 minutes long.
---
Haha PP bizon
---
if i see beaulo or godly knife the floor one more time im going to have a stroke
---
Those hours played... those are rookie numbers. Gotta bump those numbers up. But seriously that‚Äôs not bad with that amount of time. The game has a tremendous learning curve
---
"Normal rank"?
---
Seems a bit rude imo
---
Recruit's gender hasn't been confirmed ... Yet
---
Yoink
---
The Originally dev phase design had metal shields in a U shape that protected him from shots from the sides. He could still get headshotted iirc.
---
lmaoo. thanks i‚Äôm trying to get better
---
I'm either dumb for not realizing what it is or dumb for not realizing the joke
---
Hahahahah. It was actually disgusting though
---
If you've done something that deserves to get you kicked, you don't deserve battle pass points.
---
\[KING CRIMSON\], IVE ERASED TIME AND LEPT PAST IT
---
Gridlock should be top tier. If you know what I mean...
---
Ya servers have been asscheese for weeks. "A" Ubisoft service is currently unavailable when really all services are.

I was having a heart attack just watching this clip

Oh and every thumbnail has the diamond rank and the face of the operator switched with a "Le funny meme face"
---
I can never play this game because of the amount of server issues
---
Bruh he was trying to post fucking bot
---
Its brutal
---
its the worst
---
Basically any youtuber that play siege as a full time job with overtime.
---
Yeah, comp is too predictable with randoms
---
That‚Äôs one hell of a stretch.
---
What works today might not to tomorrow.

Good for you, enjoy it :&gt;

It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure glaz out....

Nomad is A at the very least Ash Should be D

ho lee fook
---
The difficulty signifies how hard it is to get into a match where he isn‚Äôt banned.
---
 peeker's advantage exist due tot he ability to prefire. Which you can do in real life as well( Paintball havent tested with real guns). 
---
That not a issue with the ping, thats just how FPS games work
---
The bizon is using the same rail as the 9x19 so why the Holo? Shouldn't it be using a Russian sight?
---
This man is like the John Wick guy from Fortnite

I doubt it‚Äôs a thing that exists.

Yep having the same issue rn

My favorite part is comming home to my family and having a mental breakdown of how my life is slowly deteriorating and I've let them all down as my future burns away like everything I ever cherished, all gone to ashes as I stare into the dancing flame waiting for it to consume me as I depart this world leaving only destruction. those whom I loved I have only hurt and whatever eternal punishment there is I will enter knowing full well I deserved it, I didn't what this. This was never how I pictured me, I can't go on like this, but it's far to late to change.
---
‚ÄúAAAAAARRRRRRUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHAAAAAAA‚Äù - Castle.

Damn! They must know I‚Äôm two off plat for the first time on pc!

there's literally a SMG that folds into a box and a 30 round auto shotgun, and the fucking SIX12 SD, and you choose to complain about "iT's GhEtTo:

Sure my email is 69420@blazeit.com and my password is 123456

and this affects gameplay how...?

That title, without context.

*boots up some casual*
---
My time has come!
---
Everyone is having the same problem, R6 servers are probably currently down. You might just have to wait for a few more hours or until ubisoft releases a statement.
---
Yeah but Mira‚Äôs thicc af.
---
Lmao you solo queue to plat?
---
Rip I have friends playing at the moment :(
---
Hey mate, do yourself a favor and buy windows.

The Stone Age of defusing

I got this the day it was added to the game. lmao

Huzzah; a man of culture

Not as hot as c a s t l e

I can only imagine the Twitch's confusion after being team killed by that Thermite lmao

this offends me

From what?

The bizon would be a nice addition to the game
---
Mira: Alright, if my calculations are correct, they will be trying to rush me when there are 5 seconds left, time to get them with this nitro cell.
---
*gets Air-Jabbed*
---
Mira: OH SHIE- *BOOM*

*Defending Team has won.*

Mira: Nailed it!

It worked.

Bruh you straight up stole this it‚Äôs very noticeable by the top it‚Äôs straight from another reddit post but I could be wrong.
---
Thank you I really felt like I was missing our on this one until now
---
Where the fuck is Kapkan
---
Just give us "The Mandalorian" crossover
---
You won‚Äôt avoid it. Keep playing, ignore the idiots. Kinda like real life.  Remember it‚Äôs a game and you‚Äôre rank / KD doesn‚Äôt define you in this game.
---
How in the hell did they figure that out. Ubi has really topped themselves this time.
---
I personally would like a J√§ger, if it isn‚Äôt possible I completely understand
---
You look like you want to sell me car insurance but aren't sure if I arleady have it
---
Gleez
---
Same.
---
Gleaz
---
Ah yes give the 3 speed an acog on defence, I cant possibly see why this would go badly
---
Edit : Possibly
---
Hey don‚Äôt discriminate the holly banana. I use it and it give me +100 chance for a headshot.
---
He's actually an insurance adjuster!

Thermite: THIS is how you breach a reinforced wall, boi.

ELI5 plz I‚Äôm that bamboozled
---
I'm more impressed by the fact that that Dokkaebi could actually get her frag to roll under the door.  Every time I do the same damn thing it just stops in the doorway.
---
Hmm... seems like the video might be played at 1.5 speed...
---
Noot
---
After the wild west event I am only good at it with iron sights lol
---
Okay then if you aren't mad don't come onto the subreddit questioning why you got banned for throwing matches
---
yeah it was a clan of throwers that instantly nitro'd the hostage, killing 2 others and getting himself kicked even though he had reverse friendly fire on
---
BOSGACOG
---
Hmm no clue. I've only heard mmr be used when talking about the overall number and elo when talking about the amount you get/lose in a ranked game.
---
What a shitter.  Unless you are getting spawn trapped it's not cheesey.  I haven't been killed by an obvious peek like that in quite a bit.  It's people like you that die before 15 seconds has elapsed because you think it's call of duty and just blindly run to the front door.
---
kill trade
---
It's a trade.
---
Killcam always shows a different person when the last person alive trades with someone else.
---
It kind of looks like the same font
---
LAAANAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
---
the hostage was killed right at the start of the round by a thrower, due to how fast she died it actually started the killcam before the round began which created this gem

Glaze?
---
I'm sorry but if you think that was anywhere close to pretty standard for a plat, you have an inflated opinion of yourself. I've been plat multiple times and that kind of twitchy aim is beyond even 4.3k MMR.
---
You dont jump from 30mins to a 30day abandon panetaly. reread what the ban reason is, 30days sounds more like a toxicity or boosting ban.
---
Wow, that sounds really boring!
---
Props to everyone posting these, if the community pushes it enough, we,ll hopefully get more weapon diversity.

---
Why complain when it was your own fault?
---
It was clear that Skyscraper is in the rotation,you got no right to leave and complain about punishment for hating a map when you were fully aware that the map is in the rotation.
---
Crazy that everyone cooperated. That‚Äôs a once in a lifetime event
---
Lol why do you care some much bud? 
---
I‚Äôm simply pointing out the fact that a 30 day ban is excessive after a 30 min 
---
Didn‚Äôt know you were scouring Reddit to police it
---
I have to agree. Just watched, and all of his points make sense. It's basically a worse version of the 44 mag, and the 44 mag is pretty darn bad right now.
---
Put it on sledge and then you'll understand.
---
Just watch him getting banned more and more lmao.
---
At this point,it's like the spongebob "how many times do we have to teach tou this lesson,old man?" thing
---
Heh, I don‚Äôt have a rank and I know damn well if twitch was shocking my charges or not. 1.) If they‚Äôre actively in combat it‚Äôs not them 2.) If they‚Äôre doing anything but droning it wasn‚Äôt them.
---
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do think it would be a nice to get the scope off and use a normal sight, because with the scope, it kicks harder than a kangaroo.
---
Wtf, I was confused at, for a long time, I just realized that‚Äôs NOKK, I dead ass thought the hostage was thinking, Igor imma head out, or I can do this myself
---
I‚Äôm just wanting it out of rotation, the amount of times I‚Äôve played skyscraper as opposed to any of the other maps is crazy. Even when I watch streamers I see skyscraper more than anything. 
---
I dont know if it‚Äôs a case of dumb luck but fuck that map
---
Thank you I'll be signing autographs later.
---
You literally missed your shots.
---
You aimed an inch or two above his head..
---
[removed]
---
Why can no one do anything cool without being an ass about it and tbagging?
---
Well,ubi might consider removing it soon. Keyword is might
---
Take the scope off and then it is balanced.
---
It doesn't even hit so hard that it would be unbalanced even after taking the scope off. Just some 54.
---
Well i dont know if it‚Äôs a bug or what but it clearly read 30 day due to abandonment. 
---
Oh well there is still casual
---
Holy. Shit.
---
wait was thermite nerfed to only have two? i haven‚Äôt played in a while
---
completely giving up seems to be my best strategy. I have literally gotten 3k with a knife by saying fuck it and just casually WALKING in.
---
I was able to get in now too, but my friends can‚Äôt see my invites and I can‚Äôt see their invites.

I didn't understand the title until after watching the video

---
Noooooooo don‚Äôt say that :-/ lol
---

yes downvote me when i'm right lol

they are still within the 1000 elo
---
Who falls for bandit tricking twice?
---
This is why I love reddit you get to meet normal thinking humans not unevolved kids that think console is better
---
Fun for the whole family.
---
Yeah a DMR with 2-shot ability on ANY range as long as you dont shoot the leg
---
any updates to this? just hopped on an hour ago and couldnt play with friends
---
His DMG not so big tho. 417 has 69 damage, so it has basically the same Shot-to-Kill ratio in terms of body shots, except maybe 3-armor+rook. And we already have TSG in game with 85 damage on most common firefight distance. 
---
So it's okay. Glaz really need this CQB abilities, because he's lacking any kind of auto-weapons and his OTs-03 are worst DMR in game right now.
---
yes downvote me when i‚Äôm right lol
---
Just cause they are within the 1000 elo doesn‚Äôt mean Ubisoft should be pairing up 2 plat two‚Äôs against golds. They try to eliminate boosting and they make the elo gap so huge it barely fixes anything
---
So does everyone
---
Ikr its like once in a blue moon lol. Stay woke PC fam
---
Your forgetting something else, it has nearly no recoil, the cmars, 417 and sr25 have wonky recoil but the ots is a laser
---
What screen is this from?
---
In game R6 tracker

A ha-one! A ha-two! A three! **crunch**

So the man cant move using his gadget. And they make him faster?
---
Well it's unique...
---
Yeah I though my idea was good but I guess not make room for the mpx though
---
Accriate
---
It makes room for the mpx
---
i'm not saying it's good. i'm saying it's fuck tons better than what that shit was before, which was NOTHING..and it did eliminate boosting for copper/diamonds
---
I don't want another hardbreacher i just want to blow people up with an rpg
---
Should get that changed ASAP
---
Sniper rifle, I thought you said machine gun.
---
Y'all know where I can get some boneless jello?
---
House is so unfun to play in, always the clusterfuck with enemies shooting you through walls and super cqb. Coastline is my personal favorite.
---
its payday fellas
---
all good, and yeah i might stop playing siege for awhile and come back due to the week ban.
---
Random but what happen with the bosg skin for the community challenge during the showdown event that we didn‚Äôt reach?
---
Sorry about the extra gameplay in the end didn‚Äôt realise it was there
---
Wow.......
---
This is what everyone says, but in practice it's far more difficult with &lt;50HP.
---
They are  implying that after this clip the Twitch would most likely have been team killed due to the nature of this game. Happens all the time.
---
The mag-7 is getting added as well
---
Don't play ranked
---
Thank you friend
---
Then you don't play ranked
---
1000IQ play

This is big brain

I'm always alone because by the time I encounter her, most of my teammates are dead.
---
The glock 17 is off the source: glock 17 owner
---
Nice illogical conclusion. 
---
Title of post is essentially "disproving" the myth that only bad players are on console. However, they're using basically copper level gameplay to prove it, which is using essentially an outlier to prove said theory.
---
Oh so I shouldn‚Äôt play ranked because I have a job that requires potentially leaving mid match. Police fire military and medic.  Nice isn‚Äôt that what the games based off of

Good one kid. Go wank off with Cheeto dust hands
---
Ubisoft, pls........ We don't need a other operator using the mother fuckin pea shooter
---
If he bought the game (standard edition) before 12th of February 2019 changes . He got them for free

How to get police to visit your house with guns. I hope you reported this guy.

When the insurance claim won't go through, so you gotta do it yourself.
---
Most LMGs are a bit shit, its really only a few ops who can run them without ruining their DPS, Maestro has a good one, but it has a short belt compared to other LMGs. Like the 6P41or Zofias LMG, WHICH ACTUALLY isnt bad
---
As long as they are balanced in some way. For example, Ash's R4C was just a G36C but it was better in every way, however the removal of the ACOG made some people switch to the G36C. 
---
Pretty much, I want there to be some major difference between them if they are similar, like the mag size for mozzie or the ACOG for ash.
---
Cameras and drones? We don‚Äôt check that at work, no jokes
---
They are pretty bad. Suddenly these yellow distinctive skins you'd only expect on attack are now available on defense.
---
I've chosen not to shoot Mute before because I thought he was Lion/Finka. Yeah, I'm not great at the game but character sillouettes are important. Some skins kind of throw that design out of the window to increase sales.
---
I could just get a team together, play and train, and then when we're old enough, enter the ESL as fuckin pros
---
This would never happen above silver 2
---
SAVE ME!! I did this and it worked initially, however now I can't receive or send invites or join a party. Anyone of you having this issue.
---
I‚Äôd have called it 502 but okay.
---
Nice
---
Maybe unsure.

Who?! The attacker was firmly in the 100 IQ range.

Honest man here.

Cause they earned it bitch!

why can i join only certain people???

Hehe karma farm xd
---
Sounds to me like you rolled up that degree and smoked a mad amount of weed there pal. I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
Yes yes. Agreed.
---
It depends on the OP. Usually your side arm is for when you don't have time to reload your primary, however some OP'a allow you to bring something with more utility. Just make sure you know what you're bringing and why and play to your loadout's strengths. Personally I say the more utility your bring to the table the better, but choose whichever you feel most comfortable and play the best with.
---
I main IQ and Nomad on attack, and Kapkan/Rook on defence :)
---
üòé your sliver hold on let me get one of my smurfs and add you lmao

It will take place on Theme Park!

Don't just stand there.  Reinforce that hatch!
---
What do you &lt;MEEEEAAANNNN&gt;
---
Reckon you are correct. Ubi needs to modernise the core of the game without upsetting existing playerbase while also generating hype for a reboot/remake/R6S2.
---
Why is this post not higher up? I lol'd AND rewatched. Great moves, keep it up, proud of you
---
I can definitely see this happening, great observation!
---
Mostly do that result in you getting teamkilled by a fellow Jager and in chat with the text "My Kill" next round.

No I am not abit salty.

Oof

No.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe if you leave before the game is over, a bug causes the win loss stats not to count for the game
---
It‚Äôs possible. I‚Äôve never heard of it though
---
Well in a casual match if you win you receive 300 Points, and it takes 1000 to rank up.
---
On average with a 50-50 Win lose rate in casual I would say 4 games.
---
He has 3, actually.

---
The main issue isn't your individual skill to my knowledge, although I can't pertain to this due to my nature of not previously playing with you, however what the issues sounds like, is that because you are solo queuing or playing with a single friend, you are missing the biggest part about RainbowSixSiege which is communication and teamwork. If you go up against a team of 5 players who are communicative and work well as a team, even if you are as good as 2 of those players combined, you miss the big part of the game, thus you will continue to lose and reach a maximum rank of gold.
---
That's insane! Great work!
---
Heinz is best, but lesser brands can be overlooked as we see fit.
---
Bruh I also get that glitch on console where the little loading icon is just spinning forever on the right hand side, you have to reset your game which is annoying.
---
They can be a bit buggy but as long as you aren‚Äôt turning super quickly it usually works fine
---
i like how its always the teammate who shoots u
---
I don't really think they were trying on casual tbh
---
"Acing" can also mean doing very well
---
Solid ace bruv
---
I can usually make sense of these types of posts but that matchmaking makes absolutely no sense.
---
Which skin is that for mirra?
---
What the fuck...
---
If Monty only uses combat as a last resort then he isn‚Äôt a threat at all and is just an unkillable drone. Or he could use combat to support his team and put more pressure on enemies.
---
Not that experienced in R6 but I find myself in those situations in other games, I ve come to the conclusion that in order for those golds to get mm with plat is because they probably have good stats when playing with their own rank or either they are premade with another plat
---
If it isn't Clash holding shield
---
Guys, stop. Seeing all these videos of 500 IQ plays makes me want to reinstall the game, but then I start playing and I
---
A) remember how bad I am
---
B) have to sit through hours of un-fun matches with team-killing teammates before finding a real match
---
Meanwhile I feel like shit when I kill cav‚Äôs targets or forget to leave the interrogation to her.
---
Kyll√§ perkele
---
Nibba you know you can be _SUSPENDED_ for posting this if the mods say so?
---
I hit a 3 second ace once with Fuze‚Äôs LMG, they all camped one room and twenty bullets later-Bam! 
---
But this, this one was a skilful ace
---
if it was for toxic behavior than no, if your excuse is "retarded players" than you don't deserve to be unbanned
---
I can see where your'e coming from, but literally half of the kill montages on the internet are just attention-seeking smurfs.
---
thats the skin of the gods
---
Tec9 rush b good ol csgo days
---
It can't. Ace means you kill the whole team, let's not change the meaning of the word like we did with literally.

Obs for longer records, for short clips u can use nvidia shadowplay if you own nvidia gpu.
---
I have a buddy who's copper at best, but that motherfucker always watches my back. I mean, mostly he dies whenever someone shows up, but him getting shot is a great alarm system lol.
---
"I aced that math test! Too bad for the five people I killed though"
---
I think it is just unfair that I get a 7 day ban from pointing out the truth and I am very sorry about it.
---
Yes but do anything (message the mods, complain on other subs) instead of avoiding the ban. It can get you banned from reddit as a whole.

Octocamo (always active,lie flat on a surface to blend in,deactivates after 30 seconds of moving. Also depending on the uniform octocamo won‚Äôt be activated)
---
| When Snake tranqs and enemy the enemy will be knocked out for an entire round unless woken up by The enemies team. Headshot = one tranq always. Tranqs to other areas vary depending on the operators armor. It is possible to beat a round non lethally,tripling your xp. Otacon is snakes commander (the lady who talks to the operators) Snake will be a one armor and three speed operator,he will make less noise then the other operators.
---
I recall them promising to rework the whole armour tiers and optics system, so that all armour tiers were sidegrades, but apparently they scrapped that idea.
---
The skeleton and hand rig will be different, but every game in existence uses meshes in generic formats like .fbx. Simply export the textures (normal, albedo and AO) and reimport into Siege.
---
I agree with every statement. The Devs are actually lying. They can add new guns, but they've found a loophole to make us fall for.
---
Thru the usb 3.0 port?
---
Well he is a 2 speed now
---
but if defusing takes 7 seconds then they can just remove 7 seconds from post plant time, which is mechanically the same
---
Do you have basic knowledge of modelling and texturing or are you just throwing your two cents here?
---
You can literally copy and paste models from one game to another, ensuring textures and polycount remain true to source. Rescaling is piss easy, my dog can do it.
---
It started before battle pass arrived
---
Holy fr*ck
---
Rank really doesn't mean a lot as there are a lot of factors that affect your ranked games and don't judge you well enough.
---
Did you win the round
---
Sometimes I wish that loading time of player would be factored into matchmaking, but then realise, that it would be rather impractical, as in difficult to implement comparing to possible impact on game enjoyment... Still, would love that to happen.
---
I wish.... I walked into a gu mine :(

who downvoted you lmfao
---
I believe it's to allow him to reposition better but i still think he needs a better gun
---
Not as hot as a goyo shield and or capitoe for bolt
---
U just need to pull down most of the guns in siege in csgo u cant do that because guns have lot more wide spread compare to siege guns where it is just vertical.
---
\*any shooting game and some other games with round based gameplay ace is 5.
---
Weird? I have a black ice skin on my breach charge.
---
Honestly man so do I, I'm all for that. But furries are a whole different story, they need to be abolished
---
We already have 417, AR-50 and CAMRS - pretty powerful spam-DMRs. But who unironically use them? Mostly nobody, because full-auto still rules this party.
---
For example, 417 has 69 damage (OTs-03 has 71), more ROF and bigger magazine than current OTs-03. So it has basically the same Shot-to-Kill ratio in terms of body shots, except maybe 3-armor+rook. But again. Where are those Bucks, Twitch, Lions and Mavericks using weapons with such owerpowered stats?
---
I think we need a new defence LMG or assault rigle
---
Bigger brain
---
now this does put a smile on my face
---
I personally think it‚Äôs not a good idea. You could fly through ranks way to fast. It lets bad players luckily fly through. If you‚Äôre better than the rank you‚Äôre in, you will rank up. You don‚Äôt need a multiplier.
---
Yes dude, so true.
---
His damage is beat by a revolver
---
wouldnt make sense story wise tho because tachanka loves old war weaponry and a electronic turret for him wouldnt make sense
---
Because, surprie-surpise, Snipers aren't belong to CQB shooter, where almost every full-auto gun can easily destroy you on every range, and maps don't have really good sniper positions or ranges.
---
So I slept wonderfully. How about yourself?
---
Honestly who cares about difficulty
---
This is what I tell myself every round too. I‚Äôm the bullet sponge for my more talented friends; everyone has their own role to play and dying is mine

Pink breach charge.

To be fair, when they started out, they have to adapt to the shit directional audio in this game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or its just me, cause coming from other games like csgo, insurgency, SQUAD and many more, R6S is the most annoying since it does not properly produce sound even when youre close to the enemy in other room
---
There's a reason this hasn't been implemented since season 2.
---
This gets my upvote, because this might actually fucking work
---
I love that but I dont love the mira elite but still take my upvote

Very much big brain.

Gingerbread breach charge.

With his fiery deployo
---
Why not? OTs-03 for a long time stays as weakest DMR in game. In game, on a second, where DMR already weakest class of weapons by definition. Glaz, unlike most OPs with DMRs don't have any full-auto options and due slow ROF he is very weak on close-middle ranges.
---
Semi
---
What is your rank?
---
Great.Now i can ace faster
---
I had it happen on console back when Favela was still in ranked, that was ages ago. Ever since then, never seen it since. To be fair, I was in silver then and now I'm in plat so.
---
Someone can‚Äôt deal with a Monty. We‚Äôre sorry you aren‚Äôt skilled enough.
---
I was playing with the bois as Monty once. Got a hip fire headshot for the round winning kill on the first shot. The entire enemy team was calling me a hacker and I was screaming my head off with excitement and the bois were like ‚Äúyea no he‚Äôs not a hacker. He‚Äôs screaming like a little girl‚Äù
---
They get 2 warnings b4 the shorty earns its keep, if you know what I'm sayin ;)
---
+ 1v5
---
K good 4 u bud
---
It really looked like a clip of varsity, but it isnt the same
---
lol shut up you idiot, I've seen silver solo Q players thrash high plats, rank doesnt mean as much as you think in Siege, given how corrupt it is.
---
Is really not lucky. Hip fire pistols op.
---
Try it on thunt and you realize how accurate it is
---
I liked it so it's good to me. To each his own
---
Made me laugh, that is the absolute truth dude
---
I know he wss wrong, I never use l√°ser cause of this
---
I mean it's probably true that console on average has worse players since a lot more people play on it but both pc and console definitely have both good players and bad players. I had a pretty bad day and fell to lower gold and some of the people there are just like the people you see in the console clips on this sub.
---
Adding that ymwith tachanka would make it too easy to get kills without taking damage. Imagine maestro but instead of fealing 5 damage every 1/3 second he can rip through you with an lmg that has no one behind it.
---
True aha, just a shame because they have the setup to use (Via pro league)
---
When you‚Äôre in a 1 v 1 situation and you find out they have Blackbeard a little too late
---
It looks like a clip of varsity gaming, but it isnt the same
---
There was a montage on my team and it was a 1v1 situation on bomb we planted the diffuser and all he had to do was wait, but no what does the bitch do.... Try to fucking kill the guy in a gun fight
---
\&gt;  Warden is playable, he's horrible N√∏kk and Amaru are better than he is. 
---
You are comparing defenders to attacks ? Why ? I'm going to assume its a typo and you meant Glaz, even then its still a no brainer that both of them are better. They actually do shit.
---
Warden is playable but good luck to you. You pick him you may as well pick Recruit, and I would go as far as to say Recruit is better than Warden. Warden becoming a 2 speed may sort of fix this.
---
Here are two reasons why :
---
\- His ability, shit. Its so useless that you rarely have a chance to use the damn thing. 
---
\- The guns he has access to are far better used on other OPs. MPX - Valk. Shotgun - Mute and Smoke.
---
\&gt; You literally just said, Every full auto gun &gt; DMRs &gt; Buffed Glaz Rifle. Except this buff makes him OP?
---
It what universe ?  This buff does not make him OP at all. Sure he can spam more bullets in a certain spot but you can already do that pretty easily with Glaz now. I would change it to - AR + SMG &gt; DMR.
---
Realy good art, if you want critisism, well... Scan so we can aporeciate more :D
---
PC players like you give PC players a bad name.
---
You  wear that platform superioriorty shit like a thin veil that barley  covers your pityfully tragic life. No car, no job, no girlfriend, only  mummy loves you, cos you have a face only a mother could love, but even  to her you are a dissapointment.
---
Your palid, spotty, grusome amalgamation of features that should resemble a  face is dimly lit by the RGB lights. In the damp sordid grief hole you  call your room, fingers stained orange from years of abusing cheese  puffs, your 500 pound gaming chair creaks under the weight of your 500  pound fat, greasy body, the putrid stench emenating from you.
---
"WE the PC master race." he smirked, the fans quietly hummed in the background, the smug, fleeting sense of dominance over the console pleb subsided, then evaporated into the ether.
---
He was alone again. Alone with it all.
---
Oh yes of course
---
Why dont they just jack recoil and decrease maneuverability of other marksman rifles? .50 Beowolf and M14 are huge rifles compared to bullpup SVD and Dokki and Maverick arent snipers.
---
Just give Glaz Vintorez already!
---
THEN I AGREE WITH YOU! Why tf are you mad at me, I said Glaz won't be OP.
---
Back when I was in silver where smokes were actually used often, I would always jump in the smoke and disable the defuser like this and it worked way too much. I kind of miss low ranks.

quit shitting yourself with anger, looks like the drawing of your op was traced from some God of War shit, weapons look like ROBLOX weapons, and 3 months, more like 3 days. And I never use Reddit that much, so chill tf out dude
---
At least I'm spending time being creative you are acting like a toxic salty ass 10 year old cuntass no life kiddo bro
---
But it's on the old patch ich mean at least last season cause of the defuse time
---
Lol, they did kill me but all I could think was ‚ÄòIt was worth it for the clip‚Äô
---
Your team was getting DDOS'd
---
Ah yes, casual!
---
How the fuck could I trace the drawing when it's hand drawn you nerdfuck? Calling M45 a Roblox gun What??? Yo your idea is right out of MS Paint in about 3 mins while you were picking your nose.
---
Get the fuck out of here
---
Cause laser turret+pasta launcher&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;old world war decommissioned turtle launcher.
---
And I 100% understand bro. I enjoy Glaz too. I spend most of time playing with DMRs. Blackbeard Namely. Its a ton of fun. I just wish Glaz was the way he was before since, standing still in Siege is not something you want to do. I hope this does happen too
---
He's just dead.
---
they can add guns without licensing, they can just change it a bit and call it something else
---
There's no such thing as the V308, they made that up, yet it's in the game
---
Fair enough, Like i said, just an idea. I get that it would require alot of storage just for recordings etc too.
---
XD

"All units, we have a code 4-20 at r/Rainbow6. An imposter has taken another suspect hostage and is moderately armed. Requesting immediate backup.

Thank you for being a good sport about it and sorry if my comment was harsh, I was in a bad mood before and just commented without thinking it through, I should've just said that this type of play is very common in casual.

Natural selection.

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

* This also includes video macros.

* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.

As a monty main I love doing this.

It could be due to shitty ping or your hitting a lot less shots than you think you are
---
&gt;I've hit plat 4 times myself. 
---
Wow really? You must be so good, teach me, teach me!
---
Imagine if they buff the ammo count too
---
This is why I love Monty, he gets so underestimated by the enemy team lol.....WHY IS HE THE ONLY BASE OPERATOR ON ATTACK WITHOUT AN ELITE :(
---
Using his own medicine on him.
---
Nice.
---
Thx.
---
I think I'm asking for some reasonable fixed update. Maybe ur right but, bought this game and being qued over an hour, the only thing I could do was changing servers. And now I can't do it. What would you feel like? You would be saying right if it was a perfect world. But it isn't
---
Aye I mean that‚Äôs why I love this game, we main the same op and have 2 very different play styles, remember tho we ain‚Äôt getting a scorpion buff if we ela mains don‚Äôt unite

Looks like my team throwing a round

It's a 30 minute ban...

I think everybody is forgetting about Operation Health

Not sure but, the speed she did that was crazy.
---
This is a real work of art
---
oh shit.. thank you  i use acog on sledge rook, and doc
---
Sounds like a great way to guarantee you never lose
---
its a shit map because 5 coordinated attackers will always beat 5 coordinated defenders. there is nowhere for an anchor to sit and do his role. 
---
but if you are playing solo, then the team that has a 3 stack or more will win regardless of whether they are attackers or defenders, because when they defend they will be jumping out of every window and its even harder just to get to the windows when Valkyrie puts cameras outside. when attacking that 3+ stack will get to windows easily, easily line of sight to the objective, grenade and Capitao firebolts will get spammed and easy win for them.
---
whoever designed this map and Chalet must be braindead.
---
Kafe is better than it used to, yes, but like, compare that to kanal or hereford, like, the effort put into those two, the new kafe still looks like the old one
---
Yeah it's not terrible. Saves enemies occasionally, but usually still the same.

But I *want* to stand behind my turret... I'm not going to hide somewhere on site and leave my turret defenseless; I'm not afraid. I'll stay near my turret, no matter what.
---
Well come up with an idea that stops these leavers from leaving games.
---
Ok that's a lie. I mean so far i have bought 4 operators for a total of 13000 renown. I've played well over 20 30 games and on top of it all remember I'm a noob. Some games go by with only 1 or 2 kills.
---
More like 20-30 games for 1 op zzzzzzzz
---
You replied to the wrong person or comment it seems
---
You can't stop people leaving
---
Sounds super abusable.
---
I should be Diamond in no time.
---
Disable friendly fire in casual
---
Play ranked or stop complaining
---
Ive got 9 ping on fiber and there is blood splatter when it happens
---
Well that sucks. I can't complain too much though since i am practically playing for free. And the game is a lot of fun.
---
My favorite moments as a monty main lol, perfectly executed gamer! :)
---
Yeah that is a backwards formula. They really need to rework that.
---
You sound hurt. Im just curious as to how your brain works, cuz you seem kinda underdeveloped, you know. You only needed 2 comments to contradict yourself, thats pretty good imo.  
---
Did someone tell you that you are bad at the game in casual so you are now trying to be the alpha male here? Compared to the other comments you are rather friendly to me, did the monster run out?
---
Trust me its point blank
---
Dang get recked thirst little b's

Didn't know that scuba helmets that shoot laser beams were on the books. I should give them a read.

it's even harder to hit someone point blank.

My team's losing, and my bro and I quit. Boom, no loss.

---
I use it every time
---
I love this
---
You fight until the death!!!!!
---
Aw Babol, big mad.

See, my post has discussion in it, and is subjective. Your question was very simple, and would be immediately clear by looking at the Rockstar press release or the Steam page.

Even the good LMGs though still suffer from slower ADS speed. It doesn‚Äôt always make a difference, but it can affect the outcome of a duel.
---
Someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but, just as an aside, if you have the hardware to run anything at 144+ FPS, your PC is likely going to run Ultra presets just fine. My pc runs medium and low setting stuff at 80 FPS at best with fx6300 cpu and gtx960 gpu.

The top floor and kitchen are completely redone, good enough for me. All other sites were viable for bomb. Which I think is the point of the remakes, to make them viable for that specific gamemode.

I was asking you why point out that it's "just an idea" if the follow up to that is that ideas shouldn't be criticised...
---
Finally a monty as of quality like myself
---
Exactly.Idk why people play aggressively with a shield.Even with greater numbers,you shouldn‚Äôt rush at him like your life depends on it.
---
I'm not saying he's ungodly overpowered but he definitely doesn't need the ROF buff.
---
start counting. come back when you have ~200 games played.
---
I was just asking what was the point of " Just not going to happen for fucking obvious reasons ". You didn't really provide any insight.
---
Exactly. Marley does it for his youtube channel, which is his job. This bloke is just some irrelevant random. You can also see marley's rank in some vids, pretty damn good if you ask me.

Off the top of my head the MP7 is real

How was anything I said racist lmao. Oh you're right, my bad, I denounced radical Islamic people because I think using your religion as an excuse to kill people is wrong. Of course I'm in the wrong here because you're not allowed to say anything against Islam and radical Islamists can do whatever they want because they're not white. I keep forgetting that we live in a world that believes the only people who have and will every do anything wrong is white people and to even suggest otherwise is racist. Also christianity bad, Islam good

So neither of us have answered the question and it seems like you won't even try. You don't see why adding Isreali and Palestinian spec ops might not be a smart idea?
---
It does but they only look at multiple tags or clicks on a person.

Question is if the trademark is really "MP7" or "HK MP7"

That's how they do many things like the F2, 556xi, V308 etc.

OP thinks it‚Äôll ease tensions. And your comments disagree and read like you believed it to be fuel to a fire. I‚Äôll admit you didn‚Äôt say that word for word so I‚Äôm interpreting as best I can, but since you didn‚Äôt really expand on why you disagree with OP (only that you do), I go off what I have.

That's too harsh imagine if your wifi cut out during a match so now no rainbow for 2 weeks

Each level is 1000 points.  For me, it took about 4 games per level so, 28 games total.  My typical casual game is about 15 minutes (including matching times between), so a total of about 7 hours, give or take, in casual to unlock all 7 tiers, or 1 hour per tier.  This is considering that some games you will be placed in a ongoing match and have a shorter game time than playing a full game.
---
However, maximum gain per match would be 5 round wins (for 60 points each) in ranked for a total of 300 points, plus 160 for winning for a total of 460 points.  Meaning 15.2 (16) games needed.  Considering a 8 round match is going to be significantly longer than your average casual game, your overall time is likely closer to 8 or 9 hours. With maximum point game per game.
---
Tl;dr. Overall, considering playing a mix between casual and ranked/unranked games played with no overtimes, overall time will likely be between 7-10 hours

That's alright! Thanks for that info. We are continuing to monitor incoming reports of long queue time, specifically with the Unranked playlist.

Rainbow 6 has a discord server that almost always has people playing in it.  Check the side bar.

Lesion is a good choice but also depends on your playstyle
---
Flip the sight down and use the sniper.
---
I'm saying that there desync between what the w parties see and when the server updates both parties shots will register however the high ping player usually can react first if peeking due to him not always registering on his opponents screen properly.
---
Lesion

Suomi perkele

I don‚Äôt agree. The main reason you pick warden is to see through smoke, and speed doesn‚Äôt mater when you have to stand still to see through smoke. I‚Äôm okay with Warden being 1 speed, but he needs other parts of his kit buffed to be a viable anchor.

&gt;any defender paying attention can, in the vast majority of cases, completely shut it down
---
Yes, which was the case in Twitch as well. Unless you were a diamond smurf in bronze there was no way you'd get all 30 gadgets. And I'm not saying difficult or situational, I'm saying quite literally impossible. Any argument you can make for countering Fuze you can also make for countering Twitch, with the exception of maybe killing Fuze himself, which is more of a luck thing than anything else.
---
I've been playing both Twitch and Buck for over 2 years now. I've perfected and fine tuned my sensitivity settings with hundreds of hours of shooting. F2 is one of the worst attacker rifles for recoil, the days of being able to spray it down are long gone with all the nerfs they gave to it.
---
But you could just be on consoles which would be an entirely different discussion.
---
Indeed I go play r6 now

yeah it reminds me too from cod, i have over 800h on siege and i recommend buying

Mira and lesion are better and more influential, but if plan on playing ranked, lesion gets banned a lot in every rank and in higher ranks, mira gets banned on most of her good maps like Oregon and coastline. Ela almost never gets banned and her gadget is good for slowing down a push if you use them right. It also depends whether your on console. Ela has the scorpion which has really hars to control recoil even for pros on pc and her other gun is the fo 12 which is a semi auto shotty that's good but has shit damage. Mira's vector has mediocre recoil and lesions t 5 has almost no recoil. All guns are good though. Mira and ela also have place it and go gadgets, while lesion has place and go but they charge over time so ela and mira have more capabilities to roam. Mira's c4 is also good with her gadget. Mira is 1 speed, lesion is 2 speed and ela is 3 speed.
---
Seeing through smoke is literally the best part of his kit. I‚Äôm done arguing about this because it‚Äôs very evident neither of us are gonna get anywhere with this.

Yes but its ugly cosmetics
---
I know right? It may not have a sight but at least it has none of that godforsaken horizontal recoil the smg12 does
---
The high ping player will register on his opponents screen an amount exactly equal to his ping. So if he has 200ms, he will appear on his opponents screen 200ms after he peeks on his screen. If the peeker then fires his weapon, those bullets will reach the server after a delay of 200ms. Every action a player takes is delayed by their ping.
---
So if they get to fire 200ms before the other player sees them, but it takes their bullets 200ms longer to get to the server, the resulting advantage is..... 0ms. Once again, confirmed by Ubisoft and basic netcode.
---
K
---
You should be.
---
Testing?
---
Because OP is trying to belittle PC players by showing a clip of him stomping people obviously new to the game.
---
So, this would still never happen on PC unless you're smurfing like OP.

Yea with practice the 11 is serviceable. The other ones are just hope the siege gods are on your side

---
It‚Äôs a test run
---
Going to sound old as fook but that looks like something chiphazard would rig up in small soldiers XD it is pretty damn cute doe.
---
I would argue it was everything, especially his speed, his guns and gadget just didn't suit his speed and he either needed to become a 2 speed or get some kind of weapon with an ACOG available 
---
They went with the speed option, next they might tweak his gadget , like I mentioned in my previous comment, look at Kaid, he had a terrible smg at launch but because of the buffs he's received he now has 2 decent weapons, I'd rather then make these changes over time then instantly make an operator overpowered
---
Right but what about if you're defending the second floor of a building and have to go reinforce a hatch in the prep phase?
---
Maestro he has a lmg and turrets that can do damage.
---
There is a reddit for finding a squad to get out of the depths of bronze and silver. Plus since you‚Äôre really new you have to realize that this game has a massive skill curve. Just keep working on it.

If he finds a single footprint you left during prepphase half the round ago he now knows your exact location 5 times.
---
Its absolute cancer and needs a rework.
---
Go and literally find any clip of someone dying to someone with high ping and watching the killcam, or just play against someone with high ping. 
---
The greater peekers is and will always be there, due to the nature of how connection and ping works.
---
People who say high ping does nothing now just simply do not play the game or understand what they're dying to.

If you're buying this hoping for a slow thought out shooter I'm afraid you're buying the wrong game. It's about as tactical as CSGO. If you're looking for a fast paced twitch shooter then this is the game for you.

Gotta downvote for that prone drop...

1 shot headshot mostly makes sense except when it comes to interactions with armor.

However the completely RNG hipfire is bullshit and should be removed.

Now I know it‚Äôs a lie

I‚Äôd be more impressed if it were a one tap tbh
---
I'm glad that crossplay PC-console hasn't happened for R6S yet. I hate it when people flick instantly behind them. Ruined Modern Warfare Beta.
---
Switching is kinda smirking tbf
---
Ohh, my man you got my comment slightly twisted. I was referring to base ops. In terms of everything else, you‚Äôre correct. I bought all the ops and it took time but I remember the price of basically every op. I have no idea why I‚Äôve retained this info.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt main anyone. You can have an operator that you tend towards, but you should be versatile. Play what the team needs
---
I've gone offline now but if you want you can drop a follow and join me when I'm next on.

Fuck the car is not starting
---
You clearly have no arguement so you're just spewing random insults. You said this was from summer. It was not from summer. Instead of admitting you are wrong you are calling me a dumb shit for not knowing how your university works. Get a life you probably dont even go to university
---
Ive been trying to make elas SMG work and the only success I've had us shooting it in max 3 round bursts with a muzzle break weirdly enough. Anything else just makes the gun jerk at random really hard in any direction after the first shot. It's literally rng if the gun is usable or not it's so annoying but it's a fun challenge.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure CoconutBrah had this spot in a video during the new season TTS.
---
Joe has it
---
I think If they gave the leaked bizon (if the stats are good)  he would be a better op as valk has the same weapon but with a better utility
---
This is definitely the game for me.
---
Why? Its the truth though. I've solo-qued most of my matches on ps4 aswell, xFvnta is my PSN
---
Thats actually a fairly good example.

That would probably be me trying to play jackal

Honestly if they just made chanka a 2 speed and maybe decreased the time it takes to take down the turret he'd be much more viable.
---
no
---
I know what I said **smh my head**
---
TRACK AND TEAR
---
Aug, I'm not a fan of how much it takes up the screen even if it has some great skins.
---
You could play Glaz the way he was intended to be played before the scope nerf. It's just that you could also use him as an entry fragger, so that was pretty dumb. 
---
Wish they'd give him another primary option with a slower fire rate and higher damage.
---
Not really. His gadget really depends on holding a small area and waiting for an attacker to use smokes or flashes. He‚Äôs being changed to a 2 speed on the TTS so maybe that will help but you might as well use Valk instead.
---
I play anchor too. 
---
Just every-time I reinforce hatch? You will be tracked. 
---
Wanna use trap operators? Jackal is coming for you and will ping you for the rest of the match. 
---
Still stayed in obj and far enough from the doors and shit? Guy can scan your foot prints from 15 feet away and still find you. 
---
There is no fucking winning with him.
---
Thanks I really appreciate it
---
Your promise is fake!
---
Would they do this? How?
---
That's where you wrong kiddo. Look at any other DMR in game. All of them suppose to have 450 RoF. And still they are weakest weapon type in game. Glaz has almost half of this RoF, which makes his gun the worst gun in Siege. 
---
Glaz has superior damage maybe? Eh. No. There's 3 DMRs with all armors 2-body shot kill: TCSG(84), 417(69) and OTs-03(71). Recoil? Not at all. 417, M14 are laserbeams.
---
So why Glaz doesn't need this buff? He's really lacking CQB ability because he don't have any full-auto and his only primary weapon are weakest among the weakest. 
---
He's Sniper you may say. But Siege is all about CQB and CQB only. Long ranges firefights mostly not exist in this game.
---
&gt; October 9th &amp; 10th 
---
Something doesnt seem right
---
And Glaz can be a niche pick on the couple maps that have good sight lines, he doesn't have to excel at the main thing the game is designed for
---
I like his outfit and his sprint animation.
---
Is he actually fun to use? No.
---
Oh... why can't you edit titles &gt;:(

Glad to see that you guys are on this! I have been seeing the same long queues on PS4 WUS servers. Plat 3 rank. Sometimes Ill instantly matchmake and most other times it is 5-8 minutes before I leave the queue and try again or switch to casual.
---
I blame reddit
---
\[removed\]
---
I have like no proof of this, I believe me or don‚Äôt, but I said in  someone‚Äôs twitch chat (I‚Äôm pretty sure) that there should be a shield operator with a burst pistol like an m93r. This was like a season or two away from when anything about clash was leaked or known
---
"ah man but jackal tracking totally makes it impossible for you to do anything as a roamer, he's just too overpowered"
---
Meanwhile he has a 2% ban rate and a pathetic win delta...
---
2 IQ playerbase
---
Bruh you can SEE the fear, he flicked 180 degrees instantaneously. He knew and he tried then he died. I don‚Äôt usually feel bad for Jackals but, dude just got cav‚Äôed
---
What?
---
This happens to me a lot. And really sometimes it just comes down to having a bad day. It happens with everyone and just about anything. Me playing siege, playing CSGO, playing guitar. When I notice I‚Äôm not doing great I will just take a break. If you‚Äôre someone that cares a lot about their rank, maybe it‚Äôs worth taking that break and saving your rank from going down.
---
r/titlegore
---
You know whats annoying? Stepping 5 times in a round in fucking gu that almost kills you because it makes such a stupid amount of damage
---
He needs a bipod working similar to Battlefield..
---
&gt; Giving warden an ACOG rather than making him a two-speed would have been fine,
---
nigga look what you said, LOOK BRUH
---
Its weird how smg11 and 12's recoil is really odd.
---
It's either super controllable or just all over the place
---
I think 10 bullets is too much but I do agree that the drone should be used more for destroying gadgets rather then killing or doing damage to players.
---
You're never gonna see smoke off site. Him being a 2/2 doesn't really benefit his kit. Although smoke is an anchor and he's 2/2 so ehh
---
Unlike ela scorpion where the recoil is all over the place
---
They probably didn't think that you'd beat cheaters so they were lazy to program it to not revert your points back if you manage to beat them. I think they should reward you double (or 1.5x) if you play against cheaters and win.
---
O shit o shit I SHI-

Don't take me wrong bud, but really, you can't even 1v1 a monty, and we're putting 2v1 as a problem? I mean, reading "man you can't even 2v1 because the moment you down someone the other one kills you" 
---
Let's just say you should ALWAYS be able to 1v1 anyone.

Nothing to argue about the rest tho

Hello Jorgamundr, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/djuh02/the_tiniest_pixel_peak/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The downside I see is how big the rim is and I do die every once and a while because they peek from my left or right and the side of the acog blocks them from my sight. Blacking out the screen isn‚Äôt realistic. I know it‚Äôs not an insanely realistic game but there are a lot of realistic mechanics and I believe they should stick with it. Dual rendering would be cool but I doubt they‚Äôll do it just because it‚Äôs a huge difference and a major change.
---
jAcKaLs OvErPoWeReD
---
They're currently getting away with it...
---
Ranked is the best way to play because you get matched with people of similar rank and skill, mostly. There are some things to pay attention to though, peekers advantage is really noticeable in Siege, so if you‚Äôre not moving, you‚Äôll get killed by people that are not even in your field of view, yet... and then there are gadgets and counters and what not, but like any other game, you won‚Äôt be amongst the best within weeks or months, like in any game, it gets worse before it gets better
---
I think it's a good start, I think it will make a slight difference, look at hibana, her gun is great but it only has 20 bullets in it and 5 extra bullets can sometimes make a difference, I think they should also remove the ACOG and from there we can see if it has a similar effect to what happened to Ash
---
Just waiting for the Elite, love the orange tho.
---
Did I ask for that? No. Did I state it could happen? Yes. I never said that I wanted a new weapon.
---
So it's a drone from spiderman?
---
Ya gotta either pace your shots, be REALLY close, or aim for the jewels
---
They just delete the match like it never happened. So you never gained that mmr and they never lost that mmr. It is kind of a flawed system in this sense.
---
I mean it's free shit just for playing the game so it's cool. The could very easily ruin the game though so I hope they don't do that.
---
I like the fact that progression is quick and rewards you for winning rounds instead of kills 
---
I'm hoping the actual battle pass is not a terrible grind and has no empty tiers
---
I have a pic I posted of a very interesting Mira placement if you went to see it.
---
True, mb, sorry mate

Its on there

\*Heavy Slavic Breathing\*
---
They are completely different, it's like asking do you wanna play smoke or bandit 
---
But if you're talking about who's better with the shotgun it's definitely goyo because he's the faster operator
---
‚ÄúI hunter always watches were he steps‚Äù -KapKan
---
In a 1v1 scenario it has no impact at all. 
---
Yeah in a 2v1 you have what you're talking about, but assuming a shield can 1v2 is just wrong imho, it should be the other way around. I just don't like having zero to no counterplay to a monty just staying there looking at the defuser and me acting retarded trying to go left and right to get an opening
---
1k actually for first 16
---
This is a great skin for one of the best operators in the game
---
Exactly, like I maybe see an Ela player once every 3 games for One round as a Plat player, (See more in gold cause, its gold lol) but its ridiculous, no matter how good an ops ability can be if you nerf the gun to hard no one plays them, Twitch I agreee needs some tweaking still but theyve now Nerfed her drone to 5 shots and if its true her F2 is getting another nerf after her recoil was shot a bit, She will be played even less, who is an Operator that is very neccesary on Objectives where Gettting the bandit or the Kaids shit down especially if the other team banned thatcher, how is it possible only Two ops in the game can counter Bandit and Kaid, Realativley easy while the Operators like Buck and Sledge have to risk getting killed to get those Shock Wire and heck you still might not be able to depending on the site
---
Global abilities should be removed especially shit like lion, finka, and jackal, dokkebai is ok cause its more annoying and doesn't ping the whole fucking team your exact location, oh and vigil/nox is garbage too. I know its not a popular opinion but they've strayed pretty damn far from what they advertised this game to be.
---
smg 11 is the best recoil for me. i trained 1000000000000 hours with it. my hands adapted to it, i don't even need to control it anymore. i don't play with the SMG11, The SMG11 play with me
---
i'am a f*cking cuck
---
Basically people get on siege, set up a macro to were its spamming O and X and the dudes can go afk and play games without getting kicked for inactivity
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt just put the claymore right on top if they really want to kill the injured dude
---
The drop was cut out tho
---
One could argue that a rotate for one to drop to yellow stairs for a flank to piano would be better
---
Each tracking lasts 20 seconds, totalling 60 seconds of tracking, potentially one target. For a roamer that can definitely feel like a whole round, but no, it's not one whole round.
---
This was leaked like 2 years ago on mira's vector during y2s3 or 4 finals
---
It's doom theme. Doom theme is a drop.
---
No I don‚Äôt think it should be zoomed outside too but I just call it a downside cause you can die because of it.
---
What's wrong with meming in casual.
---
These are operators that I see in general being played the least not including myself
---
He fuckin ded
---
Probably in a party with the gold and an unranked. And how does a copper in the OTHER team result in YOU loosing?
---
Reticle is on his head, blood is out, it‚Äôs an attacker weapon so it probably had a high rate of fire, so yes, this is probably a headshot
---
if you would just look at the scoreboard you see he is intentionally on that bronze rank even tho hes clearly above plat 3 in rank
---
Didn‚Äôt they just do a ban wave? For ddosers on console?
---
I use the sasg mostly for destruction and close range and the pmm for longer range encounters(sometimes spawn peeks if I‚Äôm a brave boi)
---
Doing so is quite easy, you dont
---
By 3 fucking kills. Have you never had a bad game?
---
Points do a pretty poor job of accounting for everything players do to help their team win.  For example, you get no points for droning in a teammate and setting up his kill with your intel.  Or for making a callout that saves your teammate.  Or for forcing attackers to spend two minutes dealing with your roam.  But those actions improve your chance to win just the same as if you had assisted on the kill or traded out your teammate's death.
---
The only thing that captures everything you do to help your team win is win percentage.   Over time, the random factors (luck, teammate quality, opponent quality) tend to even out and how often you win is determined by your performance (kills, callouts, gadget usage, etc).
---
No, you played multiple games with a cheater, on your team or against. It rolls back the games exactly, so unless you gain and lose 150&lt; elo it was multiple games.
---
Ps, closet cheater lol, ur guessing

And people still keep banning jackals like this ü§£üëé

Yeah but those weren‚Äôt detected by batteleye, which isn‚Äôt even running on the console version. They were detected by Ubisoft themselves probably by looking at server crash data and combining that with their match data to find players who beyond a doubt stressed the servers they were playing in

That's the problem bud. The new system stops nothing. The 1000MMR restriction only restricts people who are already Ranked, meaning someone who is currently Unranked but has been Diamond every season can still queue with and do all 10 placements  with 4 Copper 4's who are already Ranked.

Imagine the absolute terror
---
All I see is boosted P3s on your team lmfao.
---
It‚Äôs impossible to get all that from a single screenshot, we would need a (slow motion) video to see the moment he fired and if there were any server or connection issues at the time
---
Youre argument was that you need to be close which is risky but agree you should always be close if youre playing objective lol 
---
So either you do 2-5 pings, which any more than 2 EVER, which 2 is the LEAST likely of the tiers of pings given the time segments, which is annoying OR you can not track people down by footsteps and call out over teamchat. So if you have even basic communication skills, you can not ping and track all day and then ping when you know you can get 5 lol 
---
Yes it got slightly better but it was like going for terrible to bad lol 
---
I still think Jackal is broken and could have got a better rework.
---
I will still vote to ban Jackal and he is still worse than every other op pretty much.
---
You wanna main Jackal, go for it, I don‚Äôt really care lol 
---
You‚Äôre beind hard headed.
---
Yes it is not live yet, I know. 
---
It‚Äôs like Tachanka needs a rework too as no one uses him unless they‚Äôre playing for the memes lol
---
Yeah, because after he shot his collar bone area or shoulder OP could've moved the reticle on the head.
---
OP also didn't upload a video either. 
---
The point here is simple: you guys are gullible and don't understand hit detection in Siege.
---
Sorry I forgot I was expected to fucking look up everyone I see on the stat tracker.
---
I was initially pleased but making him a 2 armour and 2 speed means he  a valk without cams.
---
And the extra  speed...but he still needs to stand still to use his glasses.

No?
---
 Individual performance (other than that it makes it more/less likely you win) isn't a factor at all.
---
MMR  gain/loss is based on 3 things:  the outcome of the game (win and gain,  lose and lose), how likely that outcome was (based on the MMR of the  two teams), and your individual uncertainty value.  As you play more  matches within a season, beating weaker opponents and losing to stronger  ones, the algorithm becomes more certain you are placed correctly and  reduces the amount your MMR is updated by after each match.

He was literally banned the day after how is that guessing
---
Finka is underrated. She is literally a shit tier annoyance to have on your team.
---
Ubisoft's philosophy is that if a streamer doesn't like something, then no one should have it
---
Make the shotgun a primary but give it the 5% speed boost of pistols, on a 3 speed of course.
---
I'd play it, but I admit, that's subjective.
---
true
---
idk it just looked cool from pictures, not so much the one I made tho...
---
Minecraft be like:
---
I'm simply pointing out the issue with the current system that you weren't aware of because it's something the playerbase should know of so it gets fixed. You seem very angry and aggressive for no apparent reason.
---
I‚Äôm 30 I play on PS4. 
---
Ex CS and TF2 player pc player. Boy was controller a hard thing to get used too. Since my last console was Xbox original. Used to be heavy into PC master life. 
---
But yeah, RB6 is a fantastic game to come out. Really awesome take on tactical FPS SnD type. 
---
Super excited for new COD as well xD
---
I don‚Äôt really see any use for the second one. I would think ghosts have other gadgets that would make for a better ability in siege
