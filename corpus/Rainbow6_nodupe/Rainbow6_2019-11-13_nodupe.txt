No offense, but I don‚Äôt think you understand what goes in to a software development project like this. If you did you wouldn‚Äôt act like you can tell what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes

July 24th is my birthday :)

"corporate needs you to find the difference between these two images"  
---

---
me: ...
---
You can make it display ops of your choice.
---
God bless. Was starting to worry.
---
Holy moly
---
What's going on then?
---
Our words are backed with nuclear weapons!
---
For an operator that isn't a lazy copy/paste recycled op. Maybe some event packs.
---
Off topic but so far this season of fortnite is actually really good
---
Damn didnt try that. The MP5K with it on looks bomb
---
He mALONE
---
#CLARIFICATION
---
MAESTRO **can** because his turret shots an high temperature laser, that melts the plastic of the tank and potentially blows it up.
---
TWITCH **can't** because she uses a ZAP, a shock, electrons fluidity that causes electric shock, plastic is an Insulating material and the tank is made of plastic.
---
You have a skewed view of how the game works. Have a nice evening.
---
On my account I actually just had ash and jager and either banned them or waited for someone to choose them. But yes, as long as you have no ops to play you default to recruit. You can choose your loadout and everything.
---
No one but people on the project really know. That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt make statements like ‚Äúthe amount of bug fixes and maintenance has stayed the same‚Äù. Not all bugs are equal
---
HAHAH TK funny because he actually wants to play a functioning operator, stop being toxic and let people play the game.
---
I want a lowering in price still.
---
well; to be fair Caveira isn't exactly what you'd call a viable operator.
---
Truly. Sorta bs that people haven't caught on to this shit yet
---
He's basically like joe
---
Only sniper
---
Well I guess we‚Äôll find out if Ubisoft thinks most people feel the way you do
---
I know I used to pay 25k for a new gadget with a new gun. Only fools pay the same price for less.
---
Super Gandhi more like Aang the last air bender
---
Super Ghandi: just declares war on the enemy team and then just drops a nuke
---
Nice
---
The next operator is actually Mista and he uses Six Bullets as his ability
---
What‚Äôs tts
---
Embrace tranquility
---
Welp, they don't call it anti-Material rifle for nothing
---
You can hear her like a bomb dropped from across the map
---
It says YEAR 5 SEASON 1
---
Our next season is YEAR 4 SEASON 4 
---
What is their to not understand
---
A counter argument to modern warfare barely having new weapons is that even with only 37 weapons, most of them can be heavily modified into almost a entirely new gun. For example, I can make the AUG in modern warfare into a AUG A2 with 5.56 rounds, a different stock, and a barrel change. Siege however doesn‚Äôt have this level of customization (probably due to balancing issues) and a lot of guns in this game are variants of each other. For Example:  (Mp5, Mp5sd, Mp5k) (AUG A2, AUG A3 Para) (Spaz 12 and Spaz 15).
---
While this is the case, I still do agree with you overall that recycled weapons aren‚Äôt that big of a issue. While new weapons do have a part in making a new operator fell fresh and exciting (Maestro getting a LMG on defense, Kaid‚Äôs TCSG12, Mozzie‚Äôs Commando 9 with that sexy reload, etc.), it shouldn‚Äôt be the sole reason why a operator is picked. What matter most in this game are the gadgets, the maps, and the synergies of operator‚Äôs utility. I can understand people who are let down by no new weapons, but I personally don‚Äôt bother much about it.
---
Wrong, Noty just said that it‚Äôs a bug
---
That is an awful explanation of what you were talking about. You just explained the bug that happened, not the game you were referencing.
---
Ohhhh okay, I‚Äôm console player so like it would be a while before I could figure it out. It‚Äôs probably the same as if fuze accidentally killed someone with his gadget
---
Gadgets change the meta in my opinion. Not guns. I don't see why everyone is pitching such a hissy fit about recycled guns tbh. I did to begin with, but I understand Ubi's reasonings.
---
Which hole üòè
---
I'm a console player as well so I'm only going off of what videos I've seen.
---
&gt;delete them all
---
I agree
---
This is a common glitch. Seen it so many times before.
---
My mistake. Would you just have to call it an arithmetic overflow, then, or is there a different term?
---
looks slick
---
I saw another thread where they said that wamai gets the blame for all the kills
---
[removed]
---
This just looks like hyperion sniper rifle
---
nice clip, u should aim a bit higher tho
---
Thanks for agreeing with me. I guess several people decided their frozen wasteland they call home was worth downvoting me for
---
Yeah I may or may not have been slightly panickingüòÖ
---
What's up with the headgear
---
Still doesnt look like i could throw ‚Ç¨15 at it..
---
It is, one of the developers said it themselves
---
I‚Äôve been loving Fortnite, it‚Äôs some damn good fun after not playing for half a year
---
Test server, basically where everything is tested before it goes public
---
Yeah I may or may not had been slighlty panickingüòÖ
---
indeed it is
---
You wanna stop spamming this shit?
---
Maybe instead of posting videos of toxic people or complaining just block them and report them and UBI will review it. It‚Äôs so simple and once you block them you never have to play with them again even if they aren‚Äôt banned.
---
Only the Amaru idea I can accept. 
---
Not a fan of the other ones, they're not realistic.
---
Thanks. I must‚Äôve just overlooked it in my keybinds I appreciate the help
---
It‚Äôs not the don‚Äôt want to do this ( even if she‚Äôs in a good place) is that the engine can do this.
---
Really dude? Are 8 posts really necessary?
---
How about playing with a CONTROLLER on CONSOLE?
---
she's probably not even that good
---
You posted this like 8 times bro
---
I sort of agree, I just think her gadget doesn‚Äôt bring really any utility and she‚Äôs a risky choice, so it should make up for it with her guns. Because why not play and op like Zofia or Gridlock, who brings lots of utility instead of Nokk? Then you could say well, she‚Äôs 3 speed, has a good gun.
---
Thanks guys nice info
---
lol Glaz's flip sight is just an option for Kali, on top of an amazing looking gadget.
---
oof, glad It's only a bug.
---
Yeah maybe make it 800 rpm instead of 850.
---
What‚Äôs unrealistic about them?
---
Oh dang I guess that actually works now. I tried to do this 2-3 years ago and all that happened was the middle screen showed the game and the other 2 just displayed black.
---
I'm familiar with such degeneracy; I'm farther down the hole than you'd think

You are literally worse than the devil if you even THINK about doing this

Now I can see /u/sau-siege comic 
---
Defenders talking shite about the new OP
---
New OP bursted through the wall behind them and slowly and menacingly whisper into their ears **what did you say about me?**
---
*All the other kids with the pumped up kicks.....*
---
I'll never forgive the Japanese
---
He'll be better than Kali...
---
How?
---
Killed it
---
Sure, but how is that enough for you to - with full confidence - say this was intentional? Or did you just guess and decide to come here and state it as fact?&gt;
---
Is this a new thing? I always complain about ubi don't telling me when a report did was succesful
---
They gotta give her another interrogation animation. The opportunity is too big to pass up.
---
Yup!

Better than nothing:)
---
It means hes irrelevant. Hes been changed a lot in these 3 months mate.
---
Something
---
Bad
---
Dude, nothing map wise changes, it's the same every time, it's not unreasonable to expect people to know where a leaked room is for a game that's been out for several years
---
Keep reading
---
Bruh it's pretty much the same
---
Just one question, do you also use to pistol, or do you use a carbine, cause sometimes I switch it up.
---
Because ranked is the main game mode and Ubisoft wants as many people to play it as possible. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you think minor rule set changes will make casual not casual? As long as it has hidden MMR and no abandon penalty it will be casual. Maybe the only other good thing about casual is the random site picks, but that‚Äôs debatable. 
---
The reason a game mode with no matchmaking at all wouldn‚Äôt really work in this game is because it has a very high skill ceiling. What that means is that the difference in actual skill between the top players and the bottom players is very extreme, so much so that if anyone below plat level is randomly matched against a diamond player, that diamond player will absolutely dominate all the other players. That wouldn‚Äôt be fun, would it?
---
I do wish that the icons actually represented they‚Äôre ops like they used to
---
Um just because you're playing against idiots doesn't make it a solid strategy. A solid strategy has a chance of repeatability. This may have worked once but in no way is this a solid idea. Not to mention if they just used anything to blow up the castle you're dead meat. It's dumb it worked but it's still dumb. Sometimes dumb works cause it's so dumb people aren't ready for it.
---
AHH SLEDGE MY EYES
---
Usually pistol, but yeah I change it up every once in a while.
---
Nice.
---
Famous Canadian hockey caster, recently got fired for some fairly bigoted speech
---
You can do much more than only rush with that idea too. Like late flanking without giving off intel before getting inside building from other side window
---
Not completely sure, but try pressing your operator and try to find a title that says Display (or something like that)
---
This is a glitch unfortunately.
---
How is it irrelevant? How is a smoke the only one capable of plant denial? You're specifically talking about one site and even then there are plenty of other ways to deny a plant in bank basement. The point you're making almost makes it seem as if Smoke is the end all be all in that site. I'm sure plenty of teams have successfully defended that site without even a smoke in play.
---
Inset RickRoll with shady link
---
Sure buddy
---
Which one is Alibi ?
---
Hadn't thought about that. Hmm.
---
No. The TTS lasts 3 weeks. Then the season goes live and season pass holders get the ops and one week later everyone gets the ability to buy the new opsThis means the season goes live around Wednesday December 4^th
---
Just starve yourself. Worked for him
---
Bro it‚Äôs casual. My friend and I had a laugh and had fun. Chill out.
---
It would make sense yes, but on a balance standpoint that would be a bad idea.
---
Also, even if they do that it should be the same for lion / finka and even the outbreak headgears. And that would be even an horrendous idea.
---
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I know what mask they wear or what they each can or can't do. Fair point I guess.
---
People got the wrong idea that she should be a roam clearer when she works much better at getting on site early for some easy picks and causing the defenders to scramble. Like I love sneaking up white stairs on Kafe for a 3rd floor defense because so much of the set up is dedicated to holding the other side of the map.
---
I checked these skins yesterday before the leaks got removed. This is not a seasonal skin, but you can get it for several weapons. All weapons that Kali and Wamai have you can get it for, but only those. This is a NIGHTHAVEN skin pack, so all weapons for the two new NIGHTHAVEN Operators can have this skin. It also matches both of their Season Pass exclusive skins, which are also NIGHTHAVEN based.
---
realtalk why did they stop doing icons that depict what the character does? it was nice to have
---

YESSSS please don‚Äôt be a bug
---
Warden are more useless now with new smoke gadget update.. Yes!!
---
1) Dammit he's right, probably a bug
---
2) Oh ray of hope!
---
3) Oh he's just fucking guessing
---
4) He's 6'5, how could he be wrong?
---
ngl you are good for a new player
---
My grandpa does this two except he‚Äôs screaming ‚ÄúTHE TREES, IN THE TREES‚Äù so yeah I can relate to that
---
And then the enemy tries to scan or notices the gadget and your deception is worthless
---
Thank you :)
---
You‚Äôre not reading what I‚Äôm trying to tell you.  Separate Smoke from the rest of the operators.  Imagine it‚Äôs just him on ANY given site and the remaining operator(s) is/are a Sledge/Thatcher.  It is safer for Smoke to remain at a distance and use his gadget to deny a plant than it is for him to push with his shotgun or SMG-11.  If Sledge and Thatcher were immune to or greatly resisted his smoke then he would have to put himself into a much more high-risk situation to deny a plant.  I‚Äôm focusing on Smoke because that‚Äôs the defender in question.  Sure, it‚Äôs INCREDIBLY unlikely he‚Äôll be in that situation but if he WERE, Sledge and Thatcher being immune to the smoke would be a huge nerf and an incredibly unfair buff to TWO attackers.
---
But it‚Äôs okay.  Reading comprehension is difficult on Tuesdays.
---
Why would it be a bad idea? Just want to hear your opinion.
---
I'm talking more about SAS specifically. Kinda how Ela and Zofia are able to recover from their gadgets faster.
---
If you're in high skill games you're not gonna scan. And as far as seeing the bar on the feet, it's not super easy to see on some surfaces. That just comes down to placement.
---
My friends get pissed when we go to the mall and I throw rocks at all the cameras. Gotta get rid of the intel somehow
---
Not gonna lie, after all that hard work, I was hoping the entire team would be wiped out by a Fuze just for the lulz.
---
This would be dope. Not only for crazy fun custom games but also for testing buffs and nerfs, such as giving Warden a P90, or making Nokk 3 speed.
---
I personally never buy in game content. I view skins as a cash grab. My friend has since explained that by buying that worthless content i am helping to provide funds for them to better the game. That said, id buy the characters if you can or at least season passes from now on so that it can continue to be developed and its essential to have characters available for an even playing field. Otherwise, save your money.

...and your last one here because memes are banned on this subreddit

yeah true
---
Were you drunk? Because this is beautiful
---
That gun would rocket her pick rate. That would be perfect. And since they the attachments separated from the gun/op this coming season (Wamai/IQ with the ACOG) that would be the best change
---
sound required for the feel goods
---
True story: one time I convinced a good friend and new player over mic that Jackal's footprints "shows where operators are *going* to be" "wait really?" "yeah it uses advanced code" "whoa. so it shows where I'll walk? so wait if I could go left or right and the footprints go left, what if I just went right instead?" "well you wouldn't be able to see them if you're not on his team, so you'd go left" "oh shit seriously? they have that?" "yeah" ".............." 
---
The whole party had to strain to keep from cracking. I think I momentarily broke his sense of free will.
---
:| fuck
---
Sorry, I feel like that came across as rude, I was just genuinely curious.
---
10 IQ. Hack the cams bruh.
---
I learned this the hard way lol
---
Guy posts a title that says awesome strat then explains that it's not awesome just worked in casual and acts like me saying it's dumb is uncalled for
---
I never paid attention to the icon and now all I can see is this. I HATE YOU LOL
---
Well, you could get funky and go fragger Glaz with frags and just......frag with that low ttk spam gun. After all, his sight is an acog with extra benefits. So, yeah, you can do that. Kali can't do that.
---
The LMG tachanka deserves
---
Either make n√∏kk a 3 speed, or give her frags, or give her the mp7 or give her the sd. One of the 4 only.
---
*stacks three shields in a triangle* "Quadshield!"
---
Idk but that seems like a low level for that amount of play time. I‚Äôm level 150 and I have 300~ hours
---
We ALL can see it **8 times**.
---
With people guessing that and the System 99 from Halo, I wish Ubi had instead gone with a South African operator using the Denel NTW-20.
---
There was another campaign before where you hunted zombie
---
I did spend a lot of time in custom matches with my friends last year.
---
I main bandit, but mostly just because I got black ice for MP7 at about level 20
---
What is it on the TTS? These aren't the skins on the TTS?
---
thanks a lot im a console peasant. i appreciate this bro. good luck!
---
I already made a post on that.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs fine but there‚Äôs a dedicated sub Reddit for it as well.
---
Who knows maby it will be in the battle pass
---
Touhgt same
---
the mozzie and sledge face reveals are exactly what i expected them to look like
---
Yeah I read the entire thing I didn‚Äôt see anything in the patch notes for casual asides the name change
---
I'm suing.
---
LMAOOOOO
---
The reason there isn't a replay system is due to the destruction in this game being inconsistent. Ubi wants a replay system but due to technical issues the feature will be on hold until they can fix it, which will probably take another Operation Health
---
Being the last one to die doesn't mean anything. How many times have you or anyone else for that matter watched the last persons feed as they wood 12 rank their way into a bullet?
---
i enjoy the art style good work :)
---
Macie Jay is Blitz confirmed.
---
It's called a "transformer" for a reason
---
BIG SHEILA
---
Because people don‚Äôt rely on new guns for getting their enjoyment. 6 new guns in one season is plenty. They aren‚Äôt recycled maps, they‚Äôre reworking maps to make them more competitively viable. Kafe, Kanal, Theme Park, all were pretty bad maps competitively so Ubisoft went back and fixed them. Would you rather have fewer but better maps or more bad maps? Last time they added a new map, outback, wasn‚Äôt received well competitively. It‚Äôs heavily defensive favored.
---
Dude that gun is amazing. Run it with the PMM
---
You want to give a operator thats silent as cav and cant be detected on any cam other than yokais, a G36c? 
---
A 780rpm gun that does 38dmg predropoff with an acog on a slient operator thats undetectable. 
---
&gt;And with previous ops I‚Äôm sure they nerfed them right before release 
---
Ela was a nightmare for 7 months after release even tho all the pros told ubisoft that she is OP at release.
---
Jesus I forgot how early in advance they leak their skins HOLY
---
How can you even main him when he gets banned every game
---
She's like a trap operator, once everyone is on the lookout for her - then her gadget is useless.
---
Are you playing r6 like you play cod
---
He looks Polska to me
---
Lunch lady
---
It's very minor, it's on the opposite roof of the map compared to the mvp screen from the live servers.
---
rather be the mp7 so they don't have to spend so much time retooling her animation. The Mp7 can be used one handed.
---
I mean, you‚Äôre just fucking guessing too?
---
"Woah hold up"
---
"I'm on the phone"
---
Epitaph
---
Congrats. Nice clip.
---
Awppers are op
---
R4C(main+smurf), Meusoc, UMP45, 556Xi (I get to run full black ice on all FBI), SG-CQB, P90, 417, LFPS, G8A1, M870, MP7(smurf only), OTs, MP5k.
---
Just drop the cod mentality. Focus on playmaking, role, and utility usage over all. Learn your maps, so you know how to manipulate them to your advantage.
---
Siege is a mind game, and CoD mentality will only hurt you.
---
My recommendation is get off ops like Ash and J√§ger, and start playing ops like Thermite, Thatcher, Mute, Bandit, Mira etc.
---
Play operators that rely on their utility usage to help win games.
---
No. I play them differently, but Just the fact that they are both fps games and my aim isnt bad in cod doesnt male sense to why I do poorly in r6. It just seems like everyone is way better than me.
---
R34 incoming...
---
For the ela example that‚Äôs Ubisoft‚Äôs fault they should‚Äôve just taken her out of the game and reworked her. And yes the g36c would be fine on nook. The fmg9 has an rpm of 800 so idk why you think the g36 is a bad gun on her. And her being undetectable by cameras isn‚Äôt a problem just play a leison or a Kapkan
---
I mean I've been playing for a while now. I understand the whole OP choice thing. I am plat 2, plat 1. But it just constantly feels like everyone is just way better than me.
---
Yeah like I said... But it's the wrong way to play smoke.
---
Y'all are also wrong about him being an area denial... He's specifically a clock eater and plant denial op. Throwing all your gas canisters at once is a failure to use Smoke right.
---
But it's NNN
---
i like these changes
---
He/She will also have the Spas-12. I unfortunately forgot the secondaries that he had, but I remember he had three and one of them was the Baliff
---
Wut?
---
repost
---
Your command of the English language is quite limited I see. Otherwise you would have seen the word "assume" in my original post. So yes, I am just fucking guessing.
---
Yeah such a weird way to do it.

How dare you!

Yea okay, like I'm gonna believe *just some guy.*

Anyone else find it kind of weird that Kali's icon is an owl? I'd have thought a sea creature would make more sense with their CTU being water-themed and all.

Alright cheers, I'll wait and see what happens.

Ez just uninstall
---
Who bans Monty?
---
I have a question. I'm new so it may be obvious to others but.

Do other people have available maps like yacht or hereford for casual?
---
I don't know why I've never been able to play with them aside from terrorist hunt
---
/r/shittyrainbow6

Nah elites cooler
---
Yeah just imo, something like 
---
"Pro player Pengu's Opinion on Kali" or something like that over "Some credible, experienced opinion on Kali (no clue why I couldn't crosspost)." 
---
Cause the second topic makes no sense if without having to click on it and read the linked thread.
---
True
---
Yes I did!!
---
cuz german pleb shouts ^^
---
Is there anyway to shoot back at them from the airplane?
---
it works ... if you make a small hole in the floor, you have a 360¬∞ magnet AoE
---
Nearly to that point

i think 5, but could be wrong ^^
---
I hate fortnite Soooooo much
---
Let's get this man in front of a crowd.
---
I like the idea very much
---
yep
---
Hey, you don‚Äôt say that. I‚Äôm introverted af, but I really enjoy talking to people on r6. I miss the old days of R6 where everybody talked. Fucking RIP.
---
This games a joke now
---
He's vibin
---
too close. maybe if you got the perfect placement, it works, but we testet a few minutes, cuz we wanted to jump into a game ^^
---
He hit Tachanka but didn't kill him.  Idk why, I thought Kali's gun was a one hit kill?  Or at the very least a one hit down?  Tachanka was still on the turret when he re-peeked, and he had 51 health.
---
I‚Äôm an introvert, but I love talking in game chat :(
---
Tbh I wanted people to open and read, because a lot of people don't pay attention pros' opinions so I thought that having them read the rest in that thread will give them an idea on why they consider her to be so, but yes, I get your point. My bad. I'll keep that in mind the next time I post.
---
Swap Glaz for Kali and it‚Äôll be pretty accurate
---
Just play ranked lol.
---
So you didn't drone and you re-peaked. I gotta say this ones on the users perspective.
---
Yo this should be an official trailer! Nice work.
---
So if you have a 5 hp and kali shoot you from the chest you get injured no matter you have rook plates or not, am I correct?  If enemy have low hp, kali should instakill them like any other weapons and rook armor mechanic should work as same as I mentioned in my other post. The prone state or nomad airjab effect idea is basicly make kali useless in any 1v1 situation, including spawnpeeks.
---
VEXIAN U RAT I SEE UR REDDIT POST AND NOW I STALK YOUR ACCOUNT XDDDD
---
Disapointed they gave it to their shit guns. Couldn't be less happy with these 2.
---
Just set the glasses on top of the ear muffs, sure it‚Äôs at an angle but if they‚Äôre good glasses then you should be fine. Or just deal with it.
---
So your first operator is almost entirely reliant on mira for any practical use. The second is turning up your volume
---
I‚Äôve seen this a lot. I usually just pay attention is there‚Äôs a Goyo on the team. Last night I had a 4 stack try to get me kicked/banned. Soon a snatch started all 4 had went to the opposite side of what I had started reinforcing. I noticed it and stopped. They TK me and the voter to kick me out. Luckily they were slow at kicking me and I reported all 4
---
you guys ruined the song!
---
You already see your team mates through walls
---
I'm alternating between siege and fortnite but it's a great time to jump back in gameplay-wise. not all that hard to level up.
---
No more patch notes, and Forced crossplay for every platform are some issues though.
---
"This is ridiculous. This is made up of three shields."
---
Kool-aid guy? There are rumours around regarding a similar op next year.
---
I use headphones and they're not uncomfortable at all.
---
They're open-back headphones, though, so not noise cancelling (not recommended if it's loud there. But, open-back sound quality is super nice, and I can wear this specific pair for hours and can barely tell it's on my head.

Because she hot af and very much a lesbian (as is shown in the Ghost Recon crossover). Big gay.
---
im going off of how the attackers would work realistically and not ingame   
---
Attack
---
Sledge- can quick breach doors to the bombsite   
---
Thatcher- disables enemy gadgets leaving them without support and communications  
---
Lion- locates any possible civilians inside and gives locations of enemy unit concentration  
---
Ying- works in tandem with sledge to quick breach the bombsite while enemies inside are disorientated  
---
Glaz- acts as overwatch for the operation, provides intel from the outside and eliminate supporting hostiles  
---
Defense
---
Castle- denies entry to rooms with high value personnel and can force opfor to take certain routes  
---
Frost- bear traps will quickly eliminate targets by rendering them immobile
---

The role swap has ruined ranked for me.  There is such a stark difference in wins rates on defense vs attack.  I‚Äôve seen the wins deltas for different maps in the past, but I wonder what the official stats look like since the new change.
---
What kinda people are u playing against ?
---
Search for IceyCat on YouTube, he uploaded a video regarding that!

Idk what ur on looks like xbox but I‚Äôm on ps4 and I get lasered when playing and they just missed like everything they threw at u

Is there soft leaning on console now or are you using MnK?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs xbox. Every other lobby has some really accurate person on the enemy team though.
---
lol this is not even the test server

It's on console so I assume it's on regular PC servers

but where's alibi?

Hey gadget has a 15 meter radius which is more than enough to safely scan gadgets. And again, if you haven't cleared the area around you before you start doing something else then it's not the operator, it's you who's incompetent.
---
&gt;Whens a scenario where iq truly shined?
---
She's one of the best entry fraggers. She's always had a consistently high winrate and pick rate and she is one of the most played operators in Pro League. At one point they even nerfed her because she could scan and destroy gadgets too safely

Thanks I‚Äôm trying to practice so I can draw actual people üëç

It's not a bug you can attach shields to the side of doors now on console so id say it works for PC aswell

If you emp the room with Thatcher it would turn off the lights for real
---
just a simple question.. not to make fun of you or anything i just want to understand... why take recruit for serious plays when there is so much choice for any operator? i mean with recruit, you cannot have gun skins, no attachement to guns, only 1 utility each (or 2 like flashbang instead of 3) and you don't have any utility to help you out... for now i just don't see the point.. maybe if you explain that could change my mind...
---
uh the screenshot is from pc isnt it?
---
I meant the feature is on console
---
The defensive op will have the Spas-12 and MP5 it leaks can be believed and the offensive op will have the G36-C and the Mk1 9mm

Yeah, I honestly believe they need to realise they fucked up and just get rid of the buffer for his thermal, otherwise why would anyone use him anymore, she already had more fragging potential and he was still hardly ever used before she‚Äôs become a thing
---
Convenient as in placement in the home, I agree shooters are trash on controller but you get used to it.
---
Audio?
---
Ela doc and kaid s tier
---
Yeah they honestly just need to realise they fucked to and get rid of the buffer for his thermal, before kali was a thing people were still not using him at all, but, that doesn‚Äôt mean he is undermined, because people can still do great things with him, however she kinda makes all those things look shit compared to what she can do
---
You though it was hologram?!
---
IT WAS ME aDIObi
---
Good point but he's really a wasted pick since there is just so many operators that are almost certain to actually help
---
No it doesn't.
---
Ive never played cav i just play jager sometimes bandit rarely pulse
---
I wouldn‚Äôt quit either. It is funny
---
The second one was so close
---
I clenched my but cheecks
---
Yeah, he mains him just, to counter spawn peekers, but he yesterday he out gunned a jaeger with the pistol
---
Iq can comfortably sit in S as she counters echo, valky, vigil, pulse, lesion, alibi and Moz, all top tier utility/frag ops.
---
vigil can cause uncertainties and force attackers to either waste time killing him or waste utility confirming where he is because his gadget approximates his position to 12m, so attackers HAVE to get within line of sight or engagement distance to take him out, which is a roamer's job done well.
---
Frost IDK. I'm ok with it, but the general consensus is that she's better. She does have the highest win delta at plat and diamond though.
---
BB is definitely A it S. His ability blocks headshots in a 1 shot headshot game, and still fundamentally broken.
---
OK Boomer
---
Yeah exactly, but I gotta say, it‚Äôs boring as hell playing the clash in this situation
---
Yeah.   Jager is a nice op to have on your team he's a good gadget and gun just not picked much.   Also bandits are really hard to come by here and their
---
Happens to me everyday
---
Somehow I bought a booster for 30 days. Out of 720 hours, I played about 50. I don‚Äôt buy boosters anymore. We can‚Äôt always play the most part of the booster time. Even if you take it for 24 hours, many can only spend 4-5 hours.
---
Yeah glad still has fragging potential, but then they also gave kali the c7e, glaz needs a machine pistol sidearm dammit
---
Nomad is a Clash killer but very few can knock me on my ass with her.
---
Funny meem lole XD
---
Cap can, which is why he's the highest banned op in PL.
---
Kali can destroy bandits only if he's dumb enough to let her. It's such a huge audio cue that bandit can easily pull back his charges, and Thermite still couldn't be able to place his charges because Kali destroys gadgets on both sides of the wall. So she doesn't wholly counter tricking.
---
Since when does this work and does it also work for goyo
---
Buck is not s tier. His ar is really in accurate and his ability isn't like that useful. Mabye a A but not s
---
Yeah, he still has a lot of fragging potential, but he‚Äôs become as situational as warden, kali gets the c7e, where‚Äôs glaz‚Äôs machine pistol dammit?
---
Honestly. It sounded like just pure salt over the game.
---
It's a bug 
---
At 2 minutes, ALWAYS restart your queue. I retstart at 1.
---
I mean they're literally both on screen but okay
---
And then no elo :(

nothing is gonna happen probably
---
His C8 is actually really good if you can control recoil even somewhat decently. His ability is very useful for vertical play and can do something sledge can't do, vertical play from below. On the right map/room his gadget can make all the difference in winning a round (from my experience)
---
Not allowed until we get caught. Fuck that guy
---
Not worth for just one season if you can get the renown, wait for the next one.
---
A step in the right direction, this change is on the next season patch notes:
---
Quick Match (previously Casual) and Newcomer playlists will adopt the AA-DD role swap. Similar to Ranked, players will swap roles once a match.
---
Also not sure how making changes to casual would make it less casual tbh, that's more a mentality given there's not elo gain or loss. (Enter the sweaty casual as an example of mind set)
---
Youre a clown. The FO is op on console bc we arent MnK. Yall arent "better" ..... You have a mouse n key. That is all. Literal idiot.
---
This displeases me. This New magnetic placemeny prevent my dirty trick of placing in the middle of corridor where attack thinks they can Go around but get blocked by one inch and have t√¥ Go back to the shield t√¥ vault giving me seconds of them with their guard down confused trying to move around

Funny because I play on PS4. It isn‚Äôt OP. You‚Äôre just fucking stupid enough to try and take a shotgun on at close range.

Yeah, it's because they slapped the PMC logo on all of them. Amaru got those cool wooden D E T A I L S
---
&gt; 4 more ops
---
There are just two more ops remaining for Y4. Basically you have 5 operators right now except Warden. I would say save money for Y5 season pass. If did own Y3 pass and buy Y4 pass, you should get 600+600 credits. Also the battle pass comes out next season, which may contain renown boosters so that'll help you grind the remaining ops faster.
---
Yepp
---
Only worth if you want to play Kali and Wamai a week earlier tbh. I think you get r6 credits for every op you already own.
---
I play for 2 years and half and the only legendary i own os the one everyone got from chimera,Ash costume.
---
Hopefully they just leave it in the TTS...
---
Man we need to see if this can be done, this would be so cool!
---
There was exclusives for last year and year before. 2018 was ash only, 2019 had jager invi skin. People are.confusing the invitational event universal for the invitational exclusive skin.
---
What is it for? the Dailies?
---
link to the leaked skin?
---
Idk, I think the meta is still gonna be the same in regards to weapons with high headshot rate as it's still one shit headshot
---
r/fandomcringe
---
iirc there was a universal skin for 2018 aswell. But i'm 100% sure that the last one(2019) is universal

Wait the new ops are out already?

Oh I‚Äôve had the game since blood orchid, I haven‚Äôt been able to play since last October, but I just got it back this month, so I‚Äôve barely played any of season 3

This was actually a thing back in the day, I think it was around year 1, you could do this by having two people placing down their shields at the same time

You could do that?! How much were they in renown?

For some reason I have to re-download it everytime I want to access the test server. I asked steam support and they couldn't help me.
---
Oh no, I was so happy about Echo nerf üò•
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. The only ops to come out that are used a lot are Goyo and Mozzie. Gridlock and N√∏kk aren‚Äôt bad, but gridlock is a 1 speed and N√∏kk has a high skill cap. Warden is useless, Amaru is below average, but the 2 new ops look decent enough. So really you‚Äôd be buying the pass for 4 out of 8 ops, and that‚Äôs not worth it imo. Just save up renown to buy the ops.

Chalet or skyscraper. I don‚Äôt want to rework casual maps because they have a special place in the casual community, like House, Plane, Favela, and Yacht. They‚Äôre not particularly ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù but they‚Äôre fun and super casual for most people. The idea of reworking maps should stick with bad ranked maps.

Never had toxic players tho, and that's a huge relief.

Casual has become unbearable and MnK is king on console Ranked.

Keep going..
---
I‚Äôm okay with nerfing the FO if Ela gets other parts of her kit buffed. The SMG needs to have less random recoil, and she should have impacts, or any other secondary gadget. Maybe replace the shield with C4. I wouldn‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt play ela.

So they are sending messages that your report was solved yada yada yada.

But no names, details about the report its self, etc.

Looks like a cheap PR move to fool us they are actually checking them.

I want to know which scumbag i report was sacked.

No

Sometimes I encounter shitty people but I agree completely, best thing they added so far for me.

i have around 5k total hours in the game not on kali

If everyone else backed up, monty would‚Äôve lost that one.

They're not removing it. They're renaming it quick match. If you don't like it just keep calling it casual

By any chance you play on WEU?

if i ever see you in ranked im leaving and switching accounts

He has a DMR variant of a sniper rifle, so it‚Äôs not a true sniper. Kali‚Äôs is the first true sniper in the game

... Like I don't mean to sound disrespectful or anything but that is simply good recoil control. Thermite's gun has one of the easiest recoils to control, he outplayed you, simple.

---
IMO, IQ isn‚Äôt all that important enough in most line ups to be a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù. You need a Hib/Thermite and theater to start off. Then you have to slot in a Zofia/Ash. Most high teams might slot a Capitao/Gridlock/Nomad. Then one player comfort picks. And most comfort picks aren‚Äôt IQ. The only reason you run an IQ If it‚Äôs Villa, Consulate, or Coastline for Valk cams.

It's questionable, it could be coincidence, that's why I said this clip isn't enough for me to say he is hacking
---
It helps if you tell where you're from, you know timezones and such
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a better idea, you could get hit at 6 sec, then it‚Äôs 12, 1 sec burst cool down, then hit again, that‚Äôs 22 sec that‚Äôs gotta blow for the attackers. This is a cool concept but I‚Äôd just rather make the Yokai a little more visible, Ubisoft totally messed Yokai up

Happy to hear! There will be more!

You can literally see the instant snap back to his head once he appears from behind the pillar. Super unnatural looking
---
That's just siege man

I know that pissed me off

I joined /r/sapphoandherfriend to laugh but the sentiment is way too common.

Sadly yep

It was the same for the english version when they were released. Images were quickly changed when they went live.
---
He prefires the right of the pillar wum he snaps to his head?
---
I'm sorry, I'm weak to Caviera being cute...
---
Definitely not hacking.
---
Also, kill cams are not identical because it is a recreated event it‚Äôs not an actual replay of what happened. 
---
With that being said sometimes it can be misleading.
---
Yessir lol
---
Ahh another salty guy

Watch again. He hit his elbow not torso. Limbs are not a 1 hit down on a 3 armor. Saw j9 play her and hit maestro in the elbow and he didn‚Äôt go down. Still took around 90dmg

That's really weird since iirc the English ones are the ones that went live?
---
You can see vigils face on his operator card...
---
They both peeked first and technically should‚Äôve killed you with your reaction time lmao
---
I mean he tracks his head perfectly behind the pillar and when he appears from behind it there's a weird aim snap that happens when using aimbot
---
That's when your team should be nice and do pistols only
---
So is quitting out on people trying to win/enjoy themselves.
---
Yeah its definitely going to get shooted down by ads
---
Whats the point of my drones then?

Too cute :)
---
actually mad

Pre-Y3S2 Para Bellum definitely because of the top UI parts

Every toxic idiot would pick it and then blow up the entire team at spawn or inside the objective.

CrimsonDNA needs karma QUICK!! (Pg 2/2)

He was probably a low-life actual copper, rare as they are, and was probably taking out his frustration on you.
---
But why would you pick him? You can have an acog AND a useful ability for your team. Plus the Russian acog is not that clean imo the regular one is better.
---
It's also to make sure important things don't get destroyed like smokes or frags. I assume the same strat will work against Wamia.
---
Why cant it be a rant with a pinch of humour? That is the best kind! I could see myself posting something like this. The fact that everybody knows there wont be a rainbow 7 siege coming out any time soon ;) enhances the point he is trying to make.

If you have a group you play with and/or communicate well with your team, I suggest Dokkebai. I find her gadget to be a good anti-roamer or for pushing into site and her gun selection, while not the greatest, is pretty good especially if you have good aim
---
I mean there are still plenty of potatoes on pc they just usually aren't that bad.
---
There are so many good ways the play him and then there are ways to mess around and its amazing. Once I was playing him and I was laying down on cams is the bank upstairs ‚Äúcloset‚Äù get off to see someone planting a breach on the wall that didn‚Äôt see me. Happened twice that round

I feel warden would be more useful if his goggles were passive and his actual ability was that he could carry two different grenades or barbed wire and a shield or something like that
---
I'm glad I was thinking that too
---
I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking this.
---
You were suggesting him being a defender? Then it maybe slightly better but such an operator with Goyo ensures a lot of team kills.
---
Yes. Please refer to the rest of the comment chain with me and OP
---
I played against this kid in ranked and he did the same thing. Rage quit after claiming to be diamond on his other account. It was fun going back after and watching the stream to see him just get absolutely tilted.
---
It‚Äôs a real sausage fest in terms of gender diversity though, haven‚Äôt had a female defender since Clash over a year ago

---
Perhaps Zofia, she's one of the more versatile attackers and is fun to play, though Jager and the upcoming defender both counter her gadget hard. Maverick is good too but I've never played him, though playing against him, he seems to be more of a high risk/reward op depending on whether your torch gets noticed

Now there‚Äôs two of them!

Your tts account is leveled up to 30 so you can play ranked so it has some stats.

---
I said my play style, not everyone's. I know what he does, never said he didn't or he is a bad op, my buddy plays him and I'm always roaming. Not my first choice mate take a chill pill.
---
 Ripped girls hot af cuz girls hot af let's be real.  A woman who can kick my ass or bench press me is just as hot as a girl who can't

It's difficult to tell with the speed of the clip, but I think you hit the operator's torso or left shoulder.
---
You thought it was a second maverick but it was actually me! N√∏kk!

Nice comic!

Outback is horrid. I liked my jump outs on sky.

This is adorable I love it

I've seen new invisibility cheats after Doktor's Curse too.

Sorry but you don't speak for all trans people just because you're trans. "Trap" is an insult when used to describe a trans person, it insinuates that their entire internal life struggle and transition was merely to "fool men" and be a "trap". It's demeaning, stupid and egotistical to even suggest that.  
---
Using "trap" to describe someone who merely cross dresses to fuck with horny guys on the internet is accurate and fair. But on literally every female cosplay pic I see on reddit there's at least one moron proclaiming they're a trap in the comments, not even realizing that they're merely projecting their internal fantasy of wishing for and seeking out "traps". More people need to study psychology and understand the way their flesh sacks think and work.

Double Blitz rush.
---
At times like that, just call the friendly man "Yuran", as you'll later spank him with Yuran-Azhol
---
Imagine horror of 5 Fuzes, every window is being bombarded and nowhere to hide.
---
Limited time mode where each team is assigned one random operator they all have to play.
---
I hate you so much
---
I never understood these footfetish guys....you disgust me haha
---
Imagine the pure fear it would bring having two blitz running towards you at full speed
---
Would‚Äôve put him down in two shots, not dissing the ump but the way I use pulse shotgun is the way to go
---
I mean prior to the change you basically had that with FBI shield recruits
---
This is so cute aha
---
*law enforcement noises*
---
Well, we have Birthday skins. They don't make sense on other operators most of the time too.

Don't speak your fancy language at me

My average ping was 190MS. I'm now getting between 30-50

ESC + Exit to main menu.
---
can't be, Maverick is to accepting and conscienscious about non-american cultures to be part of the Paul family
---
5 Montagnes it is!
---
But I've been playing the TTS for about 2 years now even way before this new operator. My stats on other operators like Goyo and Wamai are still correct. With Wamai, I've played for 2 rounds, got 0 kills and 1 death. That shows correctly in the 'Details and Statistics' section. I've only got these weird numbers on Kali.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough, you gotta ALT + F4 to be save
---
Yeah play ranked 100%. You will learn a lot more playing ranked than you do casual IMO. Also much more fun environment. For your first few seasons don't be too bothered about your rank, just play and improve
---

I'm quite a few ranks above bronze. It's the TTS it's not that big of a deal. The only people getting butthurt over people leaving on the TTS are low ranks. They also seem to get mad at people who leave casual as well lmfao.
---
Uninstall windows
---
idk why but the faces make me now picture Blitz as Jotaro...
---
That would actually be pretty sick
---
If i were you i would take advantage of the fact that this season is ending and play some ranks to learn how it works so then once the new season rolls out you got enough experience where you could really compete.
---
stay gold
---
This chain was awesome. You're both dope!
---
Yes they can still cheat, but the people that cheating bothers most are competitive people like me. However, competitive people will be more than happy to buy a MnK and use one and thus the advantage would be gone.
---
Terrific job. Everything is very understandable!
---
Thank you for doing this.
---
Maybe you just suck?
---
Let‚Äôs build a wall!
---
I would recommend using this guide - but also don't know if PC vs Console makes a difference. Pros use Flash Hider bc it reduces overall recoil, but again that's PC: https://di.community/topic/106235-guide-the-detailed-r6-siege-recoil-guide/

I played secure only on console until we were forced to play bomb because we didn‚Äôt like playing keyboard stacks, just play bomb and get used to it. I‚Äôve never had anything against the mode just the players in it for me.
---
I like walking around in a suit with a shotgun for no reason
---
Read the body section instead of just looking at headers.
---
Nah FUCK ember rise that operation was doodoo
---
Amaru is currently useless and Goyo is a gimmicky fragger with a useless gadget
---
What's the max mines on map tho
---
You dont know how to play my man, amaru is kinda useless tho
---
'Twit'? Oh, you are one of the special ones...
---
The whole bundles are worth it because they are cheaper overall.
---
Maverick buff. Now he can clone jutsu
---
wheres KSI when we need him
---
That "provided they haven't used it earlier" criticism can be leveled at literally any operator with a limited-use gadget, dude.  Fuze isn't a dead operator because he hasn't Fuzed a room yet.  Smoke isn't a dead operator if he doesn't spend all his smokes the first time he hears footsteps.  You wait for a situation the gadget is useful in and work from there.
---
Your drone isn't always going to get a useful view of the enemy before it gets shot, that doesn't make it useless.  Vision is vision.  Hell, if it is weak, make the cameras have the ability to turn instead of being locked in place.
---
UWU What's this xox
---
Blitz needs to up his sensitivity.
---
I haven't seen Goyo ever been used properly. Every attacker frags the shield before they even get close to it
---
no problem lad . I am just doing my part here to keep the sub clean . since the mods don't do shit
---
Hey thanks for understanding! I'm pretty dedicated roamer, I've played Goyo several times and just feel the need to stay anchored near my shields or the objectives, which I can do effectively. I really meant it was situational for me vs the op is situational. Goyo will always be effective. Ex. some site locations I know are good anchor sites and play a heavy anchor op, but sometimes I find its best to roam and catch them napping on the flanks, therefore usual choose 3 speed ops for speed and flanks.
---
Dude people can use adapters like that for inputs other than mouse and keyboard. I was arguing against your suggestion to ban all players who aren‚Äôt using controllers. Xim and other adapter companies advertise heavily to players with disabilities because they allow them to use their specialized, customized input devices more easily

5 Capitao vs. 1 Warden and 4 Maestros, but the Maestros can only use their cameras for damage.
---
I'm thinking the healer would be useful for coordinated attacks. It's not a solo queueing operator at all, but in higher levels and teams it would be useful. Like a reset with a bonus.

wow proleague skin for j√§ger but without a skin for his 416c waited so long for it just to get his shotgun no thx wont buy it
---
So what you're saying is line the shields up then go throw c4 on ceiling below them and wait for someones poor soul? Yup, trying that!
---
I.... I heard this sentence.....

I don't understand the why Warden is there but also imagine spawnpeeking with an entire team worth of Maestro cams

I like to believe thats recruit

WOG vs WoG. Internal power struggle in the Wog clan boyzzz
---
NA servers are Canadian servers
---
Just 5 full docs
---
Yeah sure you can do that, but why not just use Jager, Bandit, Ela, Cav etc. rather than a 2 speed with a bad gun?
---
Because Warden can roam and see through smoke, while Maestro cams can too.
---
Well i liked the comic and so i shared it

If they patch this they better bring back my raptor legs then, we deserve something in return.

Who's there

Thats why blitz fast

In the future, when more Intel operators such as camera operators start appearing on the attack team, there may be big changes, such as the number of drones changing to one. In the early days of the game, who expected an operator like Jackal or Caveira to come out? My suggestion may not be right now, but I think it will come true someday. Creativity makes life more fun and we should not be afraid of change.

Doh! Forgot the /s. Thought the italics would be the giveaway...

What a dipshit.

Stop my feet ache hearing that

Its beautiful
---
Why would you care about diversity, its a fucking shooter.
---
For phantom sight, they really did nothing for ember rise
---
I really like his Commando. Catching drones is cool, positioning them well, with teammates that won‚Äôt spam spot and get them shot, allows for some pulse-esque vertical denies.
---
Yet we played almost three years of maps that worked well. 
---
While I think that map reason is best one they have. It is not a truth one. Lack of players sound like a correct one.
---
Nah it‚Äôs clearly the most important enemy- I mean the hostage
---
You would be surprised how often you people will use smokes to push through a door when fist breaching and as I stated hard counter to blitz, flashes tend to be used less on roamers but in the event you get caught out hide in a room use the gadget as they will likely flash to push you. His kit is meant for high level anchor, but lower level where people are bad at coms you win as a roamer became you are a 3 armor with a good gun that invalidate one of the main rushers.
---
Lord tachanka, please.
---
I've only seen her on TTS but in my experience I haven't seen her succeed that well.  I know there was concerns about her inability to down 3 armors in one shot even at close range and her pushing ability seemed even less effective than a shield fuze.
---
Nah, like in any swat movie where they have the little strobe lights.
---
Thought she already had her price drop
---
He's still Delta, an American op /:)
---
So what you're telling me is if I can't get a headshot, a nutshot will do.
---
? She is very good according to all the pros

No?

#and you only include the men

mozzie or bandit. (pls bandit)

ty ! i will try this right now :D

Anyone know if the game will finally come to the south African steam store now? It only being in uplay is a turn off for a lot of my friends so I hope is does

---
What?
---
Until 5 3 armors pour out the same door thirsty for a kill and all die too one bullet (it kills 5 people with 1 bullet)
---
If I understand correctly, Kali's rifle use a not-damage based calculation for body shots. I mean, if she hit body, doesn't matter how much damage her shot will do, target will fall into DBNO. Just like headshots with other guns, except shotguns.
---
Wait what?
---
I don‚Äôt understand
---
All these cringey ass people who blame aim on your platform. If you develop an enviorment around you that perfects your gameplay, you will get better. 50% of siege is aim, 50% of siege is positioning. Try sitting closer, and more lean forward into your screen. Use a lower vertical sensitivity with a higher horizontal, this will let you manage recoil whilst still whipping around when you need too. If an enemy can't see you, make 1000% sure you can hit the shot. PC or not, skill comes through expierence.

Hello MaMeNtyS, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dvw362/y5s1_operator_will_have_g36c/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Doc
---
Best quote for me
---
OK.....
---
This man is a genius! Thank you so much!
---
I do bad all the rims but don‚Äôt leave unless my friends do or I have to go. It‚Äôs a dick move in general
---
I said if it's not a headshot
---
97 according to the UI.
---
No matter what, this game will never reach a 50/50 win ratio for attackers and defenders.
---
Defending is just easier. You start with two of the biggest advantages you could possibly have. Time and a set location to defend. Attackers have the disadvantage of fighting time and defenders to get to the objective.
---
Also attacking ops generally don't have individual strengths like defenders do. Thermite can breach hard walls, but if it is jammed or electrified, he needs help to  make it happen. If jager wants to stop a grenade he just puts an ads down and he is done. No need to get another person involved. And again, this is general. You have some attackers like ash and defenders like mira that don't follow these general rules.
---
And the biggest thing is that attacking is just in general harder. As said before, you have to go to the site and you have about 3 minutes to make it happen. Defenders don't have to do shit and they have utility on their side to stop or slow you down.
---
You should also track how often you lose in a post plant situation on attack. You'll be surprised to see that attackers win those more often than not. It's because when attackers plant the defuser, it flips the script. Suddenly you aren't attacking anymore, you are defending, and the defenders have a time constraint against them. It's just the nature of the game. No matter what, attacking will always be at a disadvantage, and that's honestly not a big deal.
---
When exactly since i dont recall seeing the graphic or name anywhere before
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you could even farm in multiplayer without getting kicked constantly
---
Let me put this down and shoot it while all my teammates are next to it and wait I am toooooooooo
---
Aight, Imma leave now lol
---
This seems like an automated reply that was sent out on accident, i wouldn't pay it any mind. Now if the tweet was slightly more recent then you might have something, but i would recommend not getting your hopes up and ignore it
---
Hmm that's interesting, I am around the same rank and I notice there's a huge discrepancy in the type of player. You either have Beaulo Jr. Ash main 420 who rushes every round or you have the 5 stack that is trying to go pro. Overall I think it has mostly to do with the map reworks, and poor design of attackers. I think we can all agree on the fact that release Lion was so ridiculously stupid to play against, but Ubisoft always goes to the extreme with the balance changes. 
---
I think making/changing a map that is more attacker favored would spice up the meta a lot. Right now every map almost has two guaranteed defensive wins if played properly with coms, which is an issue.
---
5 Nomads
---
I also have my friends who played the game since a while ago who taught me much of what I currently know. Most of my skill right now I owe to their teaching
---
I mean, 1 hacker does usually mean the difference lol. If one team had an aimbot player, they would definitely win, like 99% of the time. The only time they would was if the hacker was trolling (which wouldn‚Äôt make sense really), one team DDosed, ur team Tked the hacker or threw intentionally to let the hacker lose. But as I said, 99% of the time the hacker wins
---
There was one where they gave the op the rlwomg secondary gadgets. I cant remember which one tho
---
/u/ubinoty

Congratulations, my guy!

So nobody is going to give me an actual answer then? Lol. Love the siege community. It's so shit.

I would like to see "bigger shield" by attaching shields to another shield to make more cover or make like corner with 2 shields.
---
So @UbiNoty Can we get this pls?
---
Not to forget that he runs like a total douche

Don‚Äôt worry I always love to play on defence with Ela or Frost but not playing Frost is probably not that bad for me because I use Ela more

Omg yes
---
Ok thx
---
Yes, i know its a dick move but if im missing the enemies and shooting the fucking teamates aswell that is probably a favour. Im literally giving the team no fucking help other than a meatshield.
---
Damn was hoping for a Fuze buff (ubi make him 2/2 already plz)
---
Victory.
---
I don't know what one op has, but I used to have Hyperx and I switched to SteelSeries and man am I glad I did...I can hear all subtle footsteps, breaching charges, claymores way more clearly than I did before. Really feel my awareness went way up. Even watching my buddy I told him someone just shot your claymore on the flank, turns around and shoots him..."How did you hear that?"
---
Yo can you do me a favour and get SPAS15SUPPRESSOR trending next?
---
I knew it looked familiar
---
Couldn‚Äôt you have edited that so we didn‚Äôt have to wait 40 seconds for a mediocre headshot?
---
What aggravates the fuck out of me is when I place my black mirrors in a way that I can shoot through the wall and one of my teammates pops my mirrors and gives the attackers a free kill hole fucks my whole strat up
---
That tweet wasn‚Äôt automated. A lot of people asked the question, only one got answered
---
By looking at them?
---
Shields are in the same boat as as shotguns in that Ubi and the higher tier of players don‚Äôt really care if they suck.
---
So what? It‚Äôs a game. If you are doing bad then learn and use an operator with a traps or a global ability. Besides if you leave then another person has to join mid round and thats not fun. If you get teankilled multiple times then that‚Äôs when you can leave
---
Clash with her shiny bald head pls
---
Hot.
---
the fact that new defender wamai has IQs AUG A2 and he doesn't have acog, just contradicts your 1st statement.
---
That‚Äôs a fair concern, I don‚Äôt know that it would happen all that often though, but I‚Äôve always had stable internet so I can‚Äôt really speak for others.
---
Litlle bug or somthing we need to be happy with this game that ubi makes woth a little bugs and thing what if epic made it lmao

I mean his gadget only works if destroyed and it can easily backfire
---
Hip fire. Problem solved. I use to never be able to hit drones when aiming. So, one day, I just said fuck it and started to spray. Ever since then i havent aimed to shoot at a drone.
---
Coin flip
---
Did they nerf Ela again? Fucking hell. At least buff her a bit on something else.
---
"then learn". Hey dipshit, i HAD learned but then forgotten. Great, its a dick move. I don't care. Would you rather be on a team with a guy who cant hit fucking anyone and constantly hits you or miss out on a few traps around the place?
---
Ha! You fool, the one on the left is a beautiful blend of Lilac and speckled stars, whereas on the right is a puce violet with mixed stars. Rooky mistake.
---
It can also be deployed at range, coordinated with team mates to hide the sound via breaching, and would also work as a better distraction than a drone since it's bulletproof.
---
F for the second guy who was shooting the railing when before you jumped ha
---
I would like to know as well because OP didnt give credit or let me know they were gonna post this on reddit

Can only assume it's because the devs are worried that they will be too strong getting more headshots through arms. I agree though I think it will affect them too harshly

What rank are you if you don't mind me asking? As a Plat 1-Diamond player I've found that there aren't too many viable shotguns in the game at higher ranks, outside of guns like Ela and Kaid's. Maybe in certain situations, but for Pulse I don't know many players at higher ranks who would choose a shotty over the UMP.
---
If you do the slightest bit of looking around on this sub you'd know this has been posted way too many times already.

I understand why your defending him, obviously, but once it goes to calling people retarded and shit like that, more stuff I can‚Äôt type here, then it‚Äôs going beyond just being a prick in a game
---
if you cant fight them outside, you probably cant fight them inside. they literally have 2 seconds before they get spotted, listen for them and set a claymore or 2
---
Maybe they could add a priority system where if you wanted to go to the first floor you would aim below where the hatch is and in order to get to the second floor you would aim below the second hatch but above the first one
---
Am I dumb, because what the hell is that rabbit for
---
If you want to improve your aim make it hard on yourself and use only 1.5x scopes such as red dot
---
Ubi: "We design new maps so that spawnpeeks will get harder."
---
Also Ubi: "lul, lets put an ACOG on the BOSG because that funny youtuber had the idea!!!111!!111!!!"
---
I've found on console that the Acog can make you a struggle with recoil and B miss enemies in the corner of your screen.
---
It's great for holding an angle, but at times while roaming I find 1X better.
---
BOSG requires aim unlike bandit and j√§ger

---
they probably not in the right mind to play anyway with that much anger. 
---
a 4-team tends to step up better :)

My cousin has played for about 400 hours and I've only played for 150 but I've got 3 black ice so I think it's fully random lol
---
It does not favor defense. Even if you go down 0-3, you now have 3 defense rounds to tie it. Same as if it went ADADAD, and defense won every round
---
Glaz main here. More hours than you. Since launch and all. Full magnification is 4.5x zoom and increasing the zoom would not debilitate him as he has a flip sight scope. He also has a modded longer barrel on his gun than the standard DMR variant.  To be effective at longer range no doubt. He had a one shot down mechanic for 3 speeds at launch but was still under picked. If you ask me, this should be standard for all most guns vs 3 speeds. It would finally balance armor vs speed, but no one wants to give up their 3 speed gods for the sake of balance. Just a few corrections. I have no argument for how he should be balanced. I for one hate the banana vision and want it gone, but I know that will never happen.

What I was meaning by damage falloff may not be required is that the density at range would automatically occupy less range. It would naturally do that, the reason why pellets need it is because the randomness MAY lead at a moderate distance to all hit causing even more inconsistent damage. After testing I am fine with them adding in damage falloff, but I think it may not be required or heavily reduced.
---
For the headshot thing, I guess I was under the mistaken assumption that the headshots get a 2x multiplier instead of a 50x.
---
The wall impacts could just be kept the same, sure it's unrealistic but there's a lot more unrealistic things in game, one more won't really cause an issue.
---
Lesion is a good overall defender and I would say is best to get out of the three, he can be used to both roam and anchor with high effectiveness, providing both traps and intel to his team when his GU mines go off, he has quite a good load out as well which is very strong but not too strong that people cry over it... ela is going to be getting hit with a big nerf to her shotgun (THE NERF HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING) soon and her smg isn‚Äôt that great either, plus I find her to be a situational character and not an overall good character... Mira very useful for anchoring! She can provide intel to the team and if used correctly can completely stop an enemy team breaching... however.... Mira can also be a double edged sword, say a twitch pops your Mira or a teammate does or the Mira is just put in a place where it benefits the enemy more... then it will mess up the team... so IMO go with lesion
---
Bro believe it or not the scorpion is actually useable on console and there are some people who I have met that literally made the entire enemy team leave because of how good they are with elas smg. Her pick rate will indeed plummet, but those who do play her will most definitely be the equivalent of poison gas attacks in lethality.
---
It‚Äôs still a stupid balance decision. The only reason they added it was because of community push. The gun is shit and an acog won‚Äôt fix its many issues. Who knew all you had to do to change something was spam a hashtag.
---
It's a tachanka, just slowpeek until you can see the edge of the shield but not him, then tap it until it breaks. They can't do anything about it, and if they get off you just fully peek and kill him. Only threat is if a 3rd defender comes and challenges you while you're busting down the Russian's dream and if that's the case, back off and have your teammates push from sunrise because there's 3 idiots holding that door now.
---
&gt; his ability is just situational 
---
dont think i will understand this point. you cant have every single op be good at alot of things, you need some situational ops. the amount of times i noticed that the enemy team runs alot of flashes or smokes so i run warden and it works like a charm is way to high.
---
Use the compensator on ela and it is a lot less random
---
Had no idea Bandit‚Äôs and J√§ger‚Äôs weapons would automatically lock onto enemies and headshot them, shit I need to use them more.
---
One time happened to me with Kapkans electric drill. And it was after I smoked. I swear i though the dude was hacking cuz he clutched a 1v4 with it. No one believed me in the lobby lol
---
Hello Soullessrun,
---
r/shittyripoffs
---
I'm waiting on thatcher so my thermite get's his friend.
---
As a console player she needed a complete rework to her weapons her shotgun is a menace you literally can go around wiping teams with her shotgun with 0 effort. 
---
But her smg on console is absolutely useless you can‚Äôt control it at all it‚Äôs even worse then kaids tcsg on release. Console players can‚Äôt control side to side recoil plus even vertical recoil is hard to control and her gun literally has both so you either one tap people or die if you have to shoot more then 3 shots.
---
I‚Äôm just tryna day her shotgun deserved the nerf but her smg definitely needs a recoil buff at least on console
---
I was thinking about it, but idk what I should do next. Do you have an idea?
---
Wasnt there a  Clash?
---
She could block and or shoot back
---
Stop trying to act cocky
---
Hello jacopo78-_-,
---
Well, this play was certainly fishy, but never assume someone is hacking based on an "aimlock killcam" like that. It happens many times, especially through soft walls. In that specific play, though, I'd assume he's either just bad for spraying through a hard wall or he's using an aimbot. Can never be sure about it.
---
True but for testing purposes where you have to compare one build of the game to another it should be pretty accurate.
---
I mean I do on amaru so yeah it's a good idea
---
Is keyboard and mouse PC enough?
---
noice
---
Lol, coming from the biggest shithead I know.....knob jockey
---
Bomb is the most balanced. The maps are designed around balancing bomb and it adds another layer of strategy and depth due to having to defend two locations, and having one defuser
---
Yes, he does
---
Most overhyped skin in the game. Honestly I am not a fan of it.
---
epic!.
---
Actually there are quite a few people who care whether its because they like it or dislike it so take your comment and fuck off :)
---
WHAT DID IT SAY I NEED TO KNOW
---
How so ?
---
His holo is cool.
---
Her recoil is in my nightmares. Had a challenge to play as her and it was fairly awful trying her for the first time
---
Why does everything have to be realistic? There are tons of stuff in the game that isnt. It would give Zofia another counter which she needs because right now only Jager and Wamai counter her gadet. Other than realism why not? Serious question no trolling.
---
The only old school rainbow six thing in siege is the name. This is a competitive PvP game, and while it isn't just mindless "shoot everything that moves" it also isn't the most realistic one.
---
Nah. It's called "scope"
---
Give jager pistol acog
---
Cool
---
This is dumb for the sole reason that you are discrediting a map for one singular aspect. The map has even been playable since today.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, there have actually been additions to the vertical play here, more notably above drug lab, a real problem with the last version.
---
You‚Äôre talking about one bomb site. That doesn‚Äôt have this. My guess it‚Äôs because of how open the bomb site is, and from I‚Äôve seen, it very open.
---
I‚Äôd rather have r4-c acog back
---
Pretty sure it will just go off regardless when the MagNET self distructs.
---
sean BEAN
---
The thing is, the patch notes clearly says that the shotgun is too strong on console so, I would be fine with the change, if it was consile exclusive, but have these changes coming for pc too is bullshit.
---
Wow seems someone hates ela. Randomness is not competitive   at all.
---
Thank you! I'll let him know
---
This year we got a broad range vigil, an anti blitz, a new trapper with a mag loading elephant gun, and a J√¶ger reskin with one time gadget uses. All I want is echo‚Äôs sonar burst on a gun
---
Sucks to be poor I guess
---
Use Muzzle brake + The scope you use most Pepperoni + Vertical for recoil OR Angled for fast ADS
---
Im a roaming clash main and goyo shields are my worst fucking nightmare. If we have a goyo i am almost certainly going to get killed because of his shields.
---
if someone is gaming on console most likely they cant run it ona a comp
---
Frost is my main and this is really nice
---
I don‚Äôt care if someone finishes my kill as long as we win.  If they are just stealing to steal it stinks, but the W is most important.
---
As long as the enemy team is dying, fairly, no problem here.
---
Jaeger definetely deserved to be fucked. Though, I wouldn't say that he got fucked, he hasn't even recieved a single nerf.
---
If you don't have a safe angle on them to shoot, like in CCTV, then being able to see through the smoke wouldn't do *that* much for you since now you still have to break LOS and throw the C4 "blindly" into the area anyway. Sure, behind the Mira you can see where they are... but you really didn't need to do that, they are likely planting by the breached wall, and unless you whiff the C4/Toxic Babe, you will most probably deny the plant with anyone.
---
I love Ela, used to main her before I couldn't use her recoil anymore
---
Name a more iconic dup than this subreddit and calling new operators OP when all we have is their name and date of birth
---
Headshots don't down.
---
A part of me wishes they did a complete overhaul with warden.
---
I would be happy if instead of this see through smoke thing what he did was he would click the button on his watch, but instead of creating this lasting effect, it sends out a pulse which creates outlines of enemies within a certain radius of you (similar to bloodhounds ability from apex legends). The glasses allow you to see these outlines, meaning your teammates can‚Äôt. You‚Äôd only have 3 charges though.
---
Alternatively. Give him a Rook roll. He puts down this brief case which contains 5 pairs of glasses. These glasses (when picked up) grant immunity to flashes and partial sight through smoke, but they only activate when crouched.
---
This game isn't about getting kills. I'll let my teammates finish off their downs, but if there is any concern that they won't be able to get there in time or can't get a shot off then I'm killing them myself. It's not worth the risk of letting them get revived and potentially losing the round.
---
Im good thx bud
---
I don't see it as an issue. If your truly being a team player and trying to win it shouldn't matter who gets credited with the kill as long as they're finished. I don't mind when someone snags someone I downed although I have found people that get overly toxic because you finished off one person.
---
That diamond is too small to judge the majority of the recoil
---
But you should admit that her recoil shouldnt be random. Its fine if they make it worse but also make it consistent. Thats all i want. Consistency
---
Holy shit thats nice to look at
---
Hey man, I‚Äôm on now. I‚Äôll be on for a while
---
Fair enough
---
There isn't even a horizontal diamond to begin with. What the Hell are you on about?
---
We need a series for this ahahah
---
lmao
---
Looks like motion blur but always on
---
Is the commando better on mozzie or the Pepperoni
---
Tachankas I‚Äôm 90% sure has Kalinka as the background music
---
Nah, you playing sims cus.
---
I am now in the progress of making this happen, ill notify you here when its up
---
Graphics setting? What platform are you on?
---
Its not spetnaz if they don't look like they're 300lbs.
---
Ironic
---
What does he mean colorful
---
If that worked #416-CMP7ACOG.
---
How old is this clip btw? I don't think you can kill yourself at 100 with Breach Charge now
---
Hacks
---
if you go for realism then here are reasons that would be broken
---
-trap operators like frost, lesion, kapkan, and ela will affect defenders too.
---
-zofia's concussion affecting attackers
---
-pulse scanning his teammates' heartbeat, annoying but not broken.
---
-IQ detecting attacker gadgets, annoying.
---
-Gridlock and Nomad affecting their teammates with their gadgets.
---
-Thatcher taking out his teams gadgets
---
Who‚Äôs the light blue?
---
SHOOTED DOWN XD XD XD
---
Thanks man, my very first edit so it‚Äôs appreciated my guy
---
Castle
---
vertical grip, comp, and holo
---
Oh shit boys look at Ghandi
---
Name a more iconic duo than this subreddit and calling new operators OP when all we have is their name and date of birth.
---
No longer a meme but a dank meme
---
Her recoil is mostly horizontal Wdym??
---
Put a muzzle brake on the commando and you get a literally laser gun
---
Well there giving a nitro cell now will that make him better
---
It just wouldn‚Äôt work, people would still use the same tactics and the rounds would still be over by the 3/4 minute mark
---
Your Casual team mates in a video
---
It happened once and i think my gun skin was put on the map instead of on my gun
---
Ok
---
You're really being naive. Yes it is mostly horizontal. It doesn't have a horizontal limiter aka recoil diamond horizontally. Horizontal recoil is much harder to control than vertical. And when it's random guess what. You can't control it.
---
Agreed, some people here just want an easy out with their ops
---
Thats what ive been doing lately haha
---
All easily balanced and marked
