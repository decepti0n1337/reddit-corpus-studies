Reddit is random as hell. I feel hivemind is also very susceptible to agree with the early votes. So in your post if you got a few assholes early on that downvoted, you're going to get hate. Conversely, if you start off with people that try to just watch the video and see the content and get a few upvotes, you'll mostly just get upvotes after.

Maverick seems good for you based on the other ops you play. It’s very satisfying to do good with him and he’s very useful anyway because he’s a hard breacher with good guns that are not hard to use. I recommend using claymores with him because you can make a small hole in reinforced walls and put a claymore in front of it so that one of the lasers go through it and you can get an easy kill. It’s worked for me many times. The only difficult thing with using him is positioning yourself while you’re breaching with his torch.

Everyone says commando, but trust me p10 is better. I have a 2.4 kd with mozzie and the p10 is godly

She can be seen? She is not invisible and she's not completely silent either. You hear her sneaking around her ability isn't that strong in my opinion and she needs something to make you for this. Someone suggested frag or smoke grenades then a better gun because let's face it her ability sucks

Most FPS games don’t get how hipfiring works. The user would still have control of their gun particularly if it was pulled tightly into the hip or arm but no your gun is still tightly pulled into your shoulder

Bullets wouldn’t just spray randomly in a wider circle that’s not how guns work it’s still be accurate and under control

If a Cav player thinks it funny to do that, they get when they deserve.

that's a tough thing to think about. but thanks for your opinion

Why

Snow??

Nøkk’s gadget is bad if you don’t know what you’re doing, and that’s very evident with her PL presence. She sucks if you suck with her, but if you know what you’re doing she’s great. If you think the UMP is good, then you are objectively wrong. Low damage, low ROF, shit DPS. All it’s good for is headshots, but any gun can get headshots. Fuze, even with his amazing gun, is not picked because there are better options. Twitch, Ash, Hibana, all have great high ROF guns and are faster with more useful gadgets. His speed is not the main issue. Ash, Twitch, Bandit, and Jäger aren’t picked solely for their guns, it’s a big part, but not the only reason. They have really good gadgets, and 3/4 you mentioned are 3 speeds. It’s the combination of good guns, good gadgets, and speed that make them so good. And no, none of what I suggested is “ruining siege” and if you truly think that, there are plenty of other games for you to play.

That ending magdump was sweet tho amirite?

Dead bodies are not server side so to other people, the evil eye isn't hidden.

Wtf are you talking about. I agreed left is my preference but gave valid reasons why you might put it on the right.

Plz do more rooms, i also love your character sprites
---
Cav should be far more snarky, for this meme....
---
Hey man the .44 auto mag sucks, sorry to say it :( feels like it fires blanks if you don’t hit the head.
---
Looks pretty cool! Nice work
---
https://imgur.com/a/gfzJcOg

slowed down: 
---
it was definitely a headshot. you can see the arrow right in the middle of his head and the recoil and blood
---
While my comment was meming as its a clear meme gun, i have to disagree when i do use it i mostly get 2 shots to down, but i may be extremely lucky.
---
Wanna play sometime? I usually end the season between silver 1 and gold 4 highest I’ve been is gold 1, one game off plat
---
That too
---
This was a little toxic but its cool
---
Another clip of the F2 being bullshit
---
You guys just traded and killed each other
---
The gun just has so much recoil and awful damage. Like I said, it feels like it fires blanks but has the recoil of a rocket launcher. If you don’t hit that first shot then the rest will miss because of the recoil. Ubi needs to either buff the damage or reduce the recoil, and I’d rather they buff the damage. I don’t mind high recoil if the gun does good damage. Like the TCSG. Pretty bad recoil but absolutely nuts damage.
---
Lol I love this cause I respond with this all the time
---
Have you used it at the start when it came out? 
---
Belive me its fine as it is, with some good hits it can be used ez, not bragging but it got me quite a few clutches.
---
i love when people claim there was no headshot when there clearly was (i slow down videos and watch and what do you know, it’s a head shot)
---
EU’s like that.  NA players give callouts more times than not but sometimes you gotta just work with what you’ve got.

You're right. Thank you for helping me figure this out!

It's on the wrong fekkin side. We almost lost because some guy reinforced the wrong side there.

Thank you

I've placed the windows where they said for the same reason. Bringing a Kaid requires you to also ban Thatcher and thats a lot of team coordination for randoms. Also, why do people place their windows on the left?

The world is still under progress, is that the world spawn? If so, tp to 0 coordinates 0 4 0 and about 100 metres away from spawn a failed attempt at building Villa a blue arrow points to the command block centre. From there you can TP to any of the builds. To get back just TP to 0 4 0 again. Thanks
---
Not really because both pc and console has exactly the same gameplay mechanic (except the controls), so anything can happen in both platforms.
---
Kafe? More like Favela
---
I think it'll just be like a Mute/Bandit thing. Each op is stronger than another on a certain objective. Nice part about Wamai is that he can catch nades where an ADS would be very easily destroyed. At the end of the day though, yes, I would probably prefer a Jäger on my team purely because he can eliminate more nades than Wamai.
---
Basically a choice of quality or versatility.

What app?
---
It’s because since they’ve all died they have nothing else better to do than hate on the player that has 100% more chance of winning than them. What a bunch of losers!
---
Yes I agree that she should get either of those guns because the FMG9 is dogshit. That’s what I’ve been saying about her for 2 months now. However she doesn’t need an ACOG. The problem is more her having a terrible gun because like you said she is always outgunned. I personally wouldn’t mind too much if she got an ACOG but people will bitch about her having the 416C or MP7 with an ACOG because those guns have easily controllable recoil and then she would get her ACOG removed like Ash when her ACOG for the R4C was taken. I personally would like for Nokk to have the MP7 out of the two because it would fit her gadget animation more when she rests the gun on her forearm. I wasn’t trying to be a dick. Sorry.
---
My ultimate edition came with base ops?
---
Actually, I was referring to a less wholesome comic involving Fuze and AK-12.
---
Placebo for sure. I think it has something to do with the longer barrel and subconscious aim
---
Probably not; there aren't a ton of maps where a sniper is supremely useful
---
All I'm saying is, is that if someone turns a corner I shouldn't instinctively change to the GSh-18 for a quicker kill. That's blasphemy.

All these sound issues honestly make me think we need an operation health 2.

Mozzie, in 9/10 situations, will be more useful to your team. Nokk is very niche and novelty unless you are in a really good and coordinated team

They know,they just do it for balancing most of the time.

I’m going to sleep rn but I’ll think about it in the morning
---
The only inconsistency is the circle. Other wise, it is remarkably close to the actual pic.
---
Yay!
---
Bruh
---
Wait what was wrong with the first one?
---
Damn casual silvers really be hitting hard
---
Wamai has some serious big dick energy. I can't blame you for fantasizing about him banging your wife, tbh.
---
The Mira was on the right wall and a bunch of try hard plats raged in the comments
---
Same fantasies but with Jackle eh?
---
THANK YOU! Glad someone agrees? Want to have sex with my wife?
---
Actually, I would. It suits my anchor heavy playstyle, and I'll give my bud, who generally roams with vigil, Jäger.
---
&gt;but it just doesn't compare
---
Funny you say that.
---
416 has 160 ms ttk, and aug has 167. It's literally 7 seconds, and "on paper" lower recoil. Believe me, it is comparable.
---
Wamai isn't a better or worse Jäger. He's a more high risk high reward Jäger, who unlike Jäger, uses the gadget against them. I LOVE that.
---
Plus, note this: cap, highest ban in PL, and gridlock, definitely a top 10, both are soft countered by wamai but not by Jäger. So clearly, wamai does more, at the cost of not being able to deep roam. And that's worth it.
---
I dont disagree though. stopping 11 nades and also having a dep shield is worth it.
---
Ok
---
I'm just excited to quick scope with the Bosg.
---
Oh yeah same
---
Yikes
---
There are surprisingly a lot of Weebs in the Xbox community from my experience, always brings a smile to my face when someone notices that my Gamer pic is Eli Ayase from Love Live School Idol Project.
---
&gt;Jager isn't really banned that often in Ranked anyway.
---
That's because it would be suicide to do it now considering that he's the only anti-projectile op in the game. But now, at plat and above, he'll see bans.
---
For me I usually just have to open the uplay app and run it from there. Then it works again on steam
---
Love it
---
will try thx
---
Looks awesome! 😁 Would love to see more from you! And don't listen to the try hards, make it however you want! You're the artist, you're in control.
---
&gt;Goyo needs to lose c4 or a shield. Maybe even have his shields be more distinguishable towards the front. 
---
Don't hold your breath though. 1 week after PL starts his nerf will he announced.
---
If the bullet from an AR hits your limbs, it will penetrate and hit the head behind it.
---
If the bullets from a shotgun or MP hit, they won't penetrate.
---
If the bullets from a Dmr hit, they'll cause collateral.
---
This is golden
---
Pretty sure the entire sub is a meme.
---
If I’m not married, can I take the punishment from mine instead? I’d be honored...
---
Not really very good, but the enemy fucked up bad too.
---
You should not have just waltzed in like that, you had a perfect spot to take at least 2 people down through that hole in the wall. Also, I recommend not using the revolver. It is fun, sure, but only 6 bullets, high damage and a long reload are offset by a lot of bullets and very good recoil of the pistol.
---
The suppressor on a 3 armor doesn't make much sense too, you only make your gun do even less damage with it on an already somewhat low-damage gun, and it does't help with concealment either really since you're loud and slow.
---
Year 2 pass
---
They will do that regardless. The only difference is that they will be forced to do it more often. The bigger problem this would address is the one that I stated. People would be banned as quickly as devs could react to new cheats. Ubi doesn't want to do it because they stand to profit off of new accounts, and because people will see the snail's pace they respond to countering new cheats with BE.
---
Jesus. let me try to counteract the thousands of people demanding changes and hating your Mira placement by telling you idc what side it’s on, I get what you’re going for and this is awesome. I’m sorry people are being so rude, keep it up!
---
If only. 
---
There was one but I think its bugged out. 
---
Aside from screen shotting maps and doing stuff with a sytlus, I can't think of cleaner options. 
---
I hope I'm wrong and someone links an amazing site I don't know about though.

that makes sense

Shoot all the cams, drones on defense, security cams on attack. Information is your greatest friend and your worst enemy.
---
Yay is it bad I wanted to gas them and my friend was playing Pokémon so I screamed at the top of my lungs HITLER I CHOOSE YOU
---
Bruh LMFAO
---
Nothing will happen they changed it cuz people kept getting tricked and banned the investigation does not happen
---
The hell it can, it has no range you’ll land about 3-4 shots if you’re lucky
---
What the fuck happened in this thread.
---
But you still voted yes meaning your just as bad
---
Bangers and mash is one of the good British dishes, don't go disrespecting it.
---
You'll land them if you have good recoil control and it a SMG it's not meant for range
---
I remember I vaulted over a fence while lagging and just fell(I have the clip of me falling but not doing the glitch) on the map near the sea with day only.
---
thank you, i solo queue for ranked (ik not a good idea) but i go positive every game. i’ll go anywhere from 9-2 6-3 8-1 7-4 but i’ve only one a small handful of games and was placed in bronze 3, proceeded to lose about 3 games but went positive and went down to bronze 5. do kills really not matter? and what’s the ratio of win loss to kill death?
---
Why TF would you be rüde about that?
---
It’s not at all needed on console
---
I meant for horizontal recoil not vertical
---
The thumb tip shouldn’t be at a 90° angle. More like a 70° angle for a normal person
---
Honestly, yeah kills dont matter a whole lot when it comes to how much mmr you get, it will slightly fluctuate but nothing worth mentioning
---
I can do that u suk
---
4 years and still feels like Alpha state
---
I always press right trigger, Xbox, just curious what everyone did. Idk why... drunk thought I guess
---
As someone with double jointed thumbs can confirm. Cool detail, nice spot.
---
your thumb is at a 90° angle?
---
Could you send it to me?
---
There is no such thing as recoil control on her smg, it bounces around all RANDOMLY and thats legitematly a fact. There are no patterns whatsoever you might be able to learn
---
I don't have a double jointed thumb and I can do that
---
It's not. The thumb is curved at a full stretch &amp; the tip is turned palm side. Do the same with your left hand &amp; see. 
---
Also need to allow for the fact he's wearing a glove &amp; digitally rendered.
---
People are faster at aiming. Much faster. Work at your mouse and muscle memory and you'll be fine.
---
Ok. I’ll try it.
---
I started choking in the final round because of the pressure. I died because I forgot to check for the Kapkan trap
---
I dont k ow about that one chief. Think about it her gadget really isnt that good but her pickrate is massive.  There are 3 main reasons why ips are picked. Memes, Gadgets and/or Guns
---
Ela isnt really a meme anymore so lets count that out
---
Her gadget isnt really good or there are ops that can do her job better
---
Her gun is fantastic 99%of ela mains use the shotgun for the range damage and recoil.  The gun is a monster on console and you can ask anyone who plays console and they will agree 
---
That gun needed a nerf
---
Or wait for 420

---
That's not a source. That's a speculation.
---
&gt;If we follow the release schedule of recent seasons, the Rainbow Six Siege Shifting Tides release date is December 2, 2019
---
Estimation. Not officially revealed by Ubi. Unless officially released, don't believe it. And if it is officially revealed, it's going to get on *this* sub first.
---
git gud
---
Thats actually pretty good
---
Looks good bro
---
Aight i didnt actually read the article. It just popped up with the date on google so i went with it
---
I play with it like the 1st pic... in this pic if a capitao fire bolts the door to cubby you are dead... in the first pic they cant block you in with fire... nice work though
---
Get tachanked
---
Thanks, man!
---
Thanks a lot, dude!
---
Ive started playing on PC and I still have yet to get kicked. Glad I moved from PS4 and its garbage community. Maybe Ive just been lucky.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind.
---
Still doesn't beat playing against Lesion tier of annoying.
---
DUH, obviously we already know that, if the post wasn't obvious enough.
---
It doesn't have any balance either so why bother with something thats not even existing, LMAO...
---
Not trying to sound intelligent, just pointing out you saying "Ultimate edition doesn't cost $150" shows your ignorance in thinking America is the only country that uses $XXX format. Other countries exist, yo. I gave two obvious examples, both where it IS $150 for the Ultimate edition.
---
If the cons outweigh the pros, then you're saying you agree its a bad thing. Also, how many times have you tried to griefer has it actually worked? Not sure about you, but it literally never works for me.
---
Which ops? I feel like theyre all usefull in some way.
---
Except it’s not? It’s still fully usable, this just makes it more in line with other shotguns. The nerf is hardly noticeable on PC. It’s still usable and it’s not useless.
---
nah pc
---
Nah that's already too good on lesion.

all of these have been officially stated at least once afaik

Would recommend a thatcher to get rid of electrical walls and mutes
---
Even if people played Tachanka, I don’t think Ubi would give him an elite. An elite changes more than the skin, it changes the gadget, so why go through the trouble of making a skin for the turret when it’s gonna be changed sometime soon. Tachanka’s rework was leaked to be available in Y5 so we can expect it soon. It would just be a waste imo.
---
Brilliant
---
Idk. He’s already really good and I don’t want him to be changed at all, I think any major buff like this would make him way too strong.

Don't forget nøkk

Hello ubi. What do you think about adding something like military endoscope into the game? I remember this gadget in SWAT game and guess it may be interesting.
---
would be fun to spawnpeek with a black ice turret, and very humbling to be on the receiving end.
---
Bit what if the defender has an impact? Or shoots the trap before it's fully deployed? Then you gave away your position AND is the defusing location trap free
---
Even if so it it's still a percentage, not a guarantee.
---
He has the Yokai controls on his arm, just like twitch. I guess Ubi decided he should be treated different
---
That was my most recent black ice, games given me 2 other epic skins for it since and im just like "nah..."
---
I don't think so, just because I don't share your kind of humor, which is like a 12 year old's, doesn't mean, I am not likable.
---
If gridlock has her spikes covering a flank, the only way to destroy it is to shoot it or impact it, but that makes noise, a lot of noise. In a game like siege, making lots of noise is the last thing you want to do. So you can throw an impact nade and continue your flank, but you can expect to get shot immediately or prefired.
---
Ok, ask the rest of the thread, im pretty sure they don't like you.
---
I prefer the right wall, you don't actually get to shoot people planting on top of the fridge thing that's next to the stairs even if you put it on the left wall, you can C4 from right side just as well, and you get the benefit of not getting shot if you try to leave the closet.
---
I still dont get why people punch out the little hole though.
---
Damn really nice artwork !!
---
Do I care? r/rainbow6 is full of morons, that's why I'm ending this conversation - you just can't argue with stupid people.
---
Maybe tomorrow or tuesday. 
---
But I think they want to nerf her before releasing the elite. People will complain if Ubisoft let people buy the elite and then nerf her the day after
---
How long does it take for you to save up that much? Ive always thought about it but felt like it would take too long. Im not the most patient person.
---
If it's full of morons, why are you here? Oh yeah, it's because you are one yourself. Think before you write, please.

You shotgun the leftside of that wall and barricade the right side. Then shotgun the other wall next to it Trust me its a great strat.
---
Its been said 2 times and I'll say it again... fucking repost.

Yes, because this is aimed to happen to cav all the time..

this is the same community that still has people complaining about how they can't type the n-word into chat. needless to say sometimes people can be absolutely toxic just because "its the internet." that's it, that's usually the extent of their reasoning, and they think that's okay behavior.

Ubi please dont remove dis. I want it on the live servers.

No like everyone is pretty much forced outside or their location is visible and it’s like normal games where they all have to kill each other but it’s outside... I just feel like some maps have a really cool outside area that’s not appreciated enough since everyone usually fights inside and it’s really fun and kinda challenging outside.

Stop.

Too late bro :(

Okaaaay when I saw his rank after the match and didn't know he was gold 1 as I was playing so that isn't really true. The fact he carried his team and was a higher rank obviously means he is better than me no doubt about it but I shouldn't be playing against him nonetheless
---
Love the games but I cannot stay in those subreddits your description is pretty accurate.
---
About 3 months sometimes 5
---
Does it help with spotting?
---
Incorrect. On Live servers (which OP is on) hand damage is chest damage.
---
Play mute, put your jammers around in prep and go hunting with your OP s.a.s shotgun

Year 1 operators cost like 20 k for all of them so it’s honestly not much time

Blood Orchid uniform skins were borderline P2W in some really dark areas, made you much harder to notice.

I've actually had a great time with Unranked, haven't had an issue with queue times at all and I've actually won more, probably because there's fewer 5 stacks in Unranked. But yes, I understand your point - as they add, they'll have to take away to deal with queue times.
---
Valk's was changed about 1 month after release because de community pointed it out. I'm pretty sure we'll see the same for Ember rise body suit, especially after it got banned from pro-league
---
Idk maybe yes maybe no
---
They don’t take level into account, only rank ( unranked people are near gold with 2500 mmr
---
Because level means nothing in terms of matchmaking.
---
I think they said they "fixed" this from the test server? Would have to check again tho
---
They tried to test it this friday but kept crashing, so it is offline again.
---
And just like the Maginot line the best strategy is to just go around it
---
Hahaha good one.
---
But in case you were not joking, a p2p is a game that is free to play but that lacks so much content that there's no point to play the game without paying

Do you know how to reply to comments?

And also the fact his gun is amazing imo
---
We recruit rushed and when there was one guy left that wasn’t around us we found a cake in the kitchen and just stood around it

She can also spot vigil if he have his anti drone thingy active
---
That’s just rude.
---
oof I was not joking lol thanks
---
the key word being "should"
---
Thank you :))
---
test it: take another gadget in the hand and hold the button, does the operator hold or deploy it? If it holds maybe you'll have to change something in the options to be able to cook it. If the gadget automatically deploys (if not possible it should be put back in the pocket automatically) then maybe your mouse has something to do with the problem, hope it helps.
---
cant really tell, i got the game on release, hated all the bugs, waited for the season pass stuff to come, still bugs, gave up, i played recently and i know they changed the ttk later, but since now i play on tv.....if im shot i\`m basically dead.
---
I used an alt and switched it to my friends name and got like #3468 at the end. In game in showed up as (name)3468 so I wouldn’t if I were u, atleast yet
---
first time seeing it, hope it helps me ace! ▪~▪
---
That’s a good question but I don’t know
---
Legit looks so nice good job m8
---
My aim with goyo's vector is not that well so i go shotgun
---
yes
---
I prefer the BOSG with an angled grip and reflex and the smg12 with a vertical grip and holo the SMG has more options than the cz auto like slect fire ir firing in short burst. Meanwhile for the gatget use it shortly before or during fire fights to cause a distraction and give your teammates the upper hand. It's also great if you suspect a cav or vigil lurking nearby
---
I was going to write that but I ran out of characters
---
Those look like crocs with grey socks.

If you run the dmr make sure you switch to your shotgun in close quarters

buck doesnt have dmr or shotgun?

If the trend continues we should get it tuesday december 3rd. It's usually the tuesday 3 weeks after the TTS starts.

Although it's not revealed until you finish 10 matches, you already have a MMR.
---
Everyone starts at 2500MMR initially and resets to midway between 2500 and where they finished the previous season at the start of each season.  How much you gain/lose is determined by the outcome (W/L), how likely that outcome was (based on the two teams' MMRs) and your individual uncertainty value (which starts high each season and goes down as you play more matches).
---
Casual has a simiilar MMR system that works on the same principles.
---
Ranks are centered around 2600MMR.  Every 100 points below that is a rank and there are 5 ranks per color; Silver 1 for example is 2500-2599.  Gold has 3 ranks spanning 200 MMR each.  Plat has 3 ranks spanning 400 MMR each.  Diamond is above plat and Champion is the top rank.

Oh my bad

I wouldn't really call this change 'major', since it needs both a dead teamate and a very specific operator.

2 stories I was playing a ranked match and somehow my garbage self pulled a 1v4 as Jaeger I was in room and killed 2 of them trying to come in and the other 2 were too scared to come after me because time ran out. My other friends got wiped fairly quickly. Another time I was Doc on plane (this was casual) and I trapped someone in that one room after the walls have been reinforced. The first time I ever did I was laughing so hard and my one friend died so I ran to where he was and killed the last 3 attackers. And I thought I was going to get tk'd by the guy I trapped but apparently the person killed my other friend because my friend switched to game chat and was talking to him. I don't know what he said as I was still in ps4 party chat. My two favorite moments.
---
Ash is very very VERY disappointed
---
The most attacker based area is the top floor because it's small but sometimes you can't reinforce all the walls and the hard breacher's can can easily get kills. Even if there are no hard breachers ops like ash or zofia can blow the soft walls up and kill you from a distance. The widow in the objective is annoying because of the small and cramped room it's hard to find cover.
---
I recommend building a real gaming PC. That’s when you’ll really see a difference, especially experience higher framerate.
---
Season 3 was unplayable because of this, glad they fixed it

Edit to say wow
---
Thats... far too close
---
They've yet to provide evidence. So by default they're wrong until the do.  Ive provided more evidence than they have in all of this. They've made claims whilst i make counter arguments. Sadly since they are lazy they've yet to give any data anyone can provide. 
---
You've provided no proof to your argument either pal. So i agree with you there.
---
Villa I think is fine for the most part. I know many people have issues with it still be more in favour of defenders than attackers, however, I personally don't see any need to make significant changes at this stage. Maybe a few minor changes to certain rooms or angles could help flesh it out a bit.
---
Skyscraper is a good option. Being taken out of ranked from next season so could be paving the way from a rework. Again, a very defender sided map that plays very one dimensional.
---
Chalet can be a frustrating map to attack on. Again, a few QOL changes and some small buffs here and there could make it more enjoyable for people.
---
Personally, I think thet need to aproach Y5 with either:
---
* 2 New Maps &amp; 2 Reworks 
---
* 1 New Map &amp; 3 Reworks (same as Y4)
---
Recruit m870 rushed with full sensitivity and one of my friends aced we all have around 55 sensitivity for both horizontal and vertical.

Kapkan inspired me to buy a pmm irl
---
Many thanks
---
Yeah, that’s one thing. In all honesty, I brought it because I missed playing Siege, I’m away from home right now. I’ve played it before on my friend’s gaming laptop, I love the constant 60fps.
---
I would say the 2 week span where i got like 27 Tachanka aces. I think it was when the game was on sale at some point, so it was a lot of new people, but i still love it.
---
Not so long ago I got 2 aces in b2b rounds. Was my first double ace in one match ever! Also was one of the few times I didn't start shaking while being the last one alive hence the aces probably did happen.
---
Utter trash.
---
I'd burn it with mav's torch + Cap's bolts + goyo's shield, and the blow it up the remains 10 frags, 8 impacts and 2 breaching rounds.
---
And I'd f**king do it again if they rebuilt it in siege.
---
Then give LFP5 sniper attachments
---
My best memory was when I got TK in ranked when I asked a teammate to reinforce a certain wall.
---
I had 6 kills and 2 death, the guy who killed me was at 0 kills and 4 death.
---
When asked in audio chat why he answered with something that is burnt in my mind.
---
"Don't tell me how to play"
---
Fair enough.
---
For a second I saw a French shotgun acog
---
A S C E N D
---
I think smgs with high fire rate like the vector doesn't work well and the mp5k with suppressor needs head shots but that's just me.
---
Done.
---
Now delete yours so it looks like nothing happened.
---
&gt;The maps is in casual people don’t do their rank strat and try to reck you. 
---
So that somehow means it's not unbalanced?? Why don't you make the same argument for Tower? People don't do strats in casual so why do you have a problem with roamers?
---
&gt;Um yes you can fully reinforce some of the obj. Armory for example and the one on the last floor I don’t remember the name.
---
1F biker rooms: you need at least 13 (out of 10 total available) reinforcements, not counting hatches, in order to prevent the attackers from getting extremely long lines of sight into the objective, shutting down rotations or just straight up entering the objective.
---
2F football rooms: same story, at least 13 reinforcements are absolutely necessary to prevent the above mentioned.
---
2F/3F northern building: 17!!! reinforcements just to fully reinforce the two bombsites. Even if you had infinite reinforcements the attackers could still just enter any of the two objectives because you have no way to breach deny so many walls.
---
&gt;You can outplay the enemy same as any map, you just have to play smarter, it’s not easy but it’s possible.
---
Please teach me your magical strats then.
---
Scribble out his comment and circle my name
---
Varsity gaming actually said that it needs a damage drop.
---
My first 1v4, back in that 3 month period of time, dedicated to fixing and improving the game's performance.
---
Still have yet to get an ace, but I have a few 4k's under my belt
---
What operator is that? I don’t recognize-’em
---
Yea the map's super soft
---
Vector already shoots peas. You'd be gimping yourself for absolutely no valid advantage by dropping it's damage further. Whether you are Mira or goyo, they'll know you are there so there's no point in being sneaky.
---
Are the yellow things batteries or mutes
---
Wait... your team found the objective? Jokes aside, the number of times my team hasn’t found the objective on that map is much higher than on any other map, most times it’s the room that sits behind the elevator on the second floor. I don’t actually know what it’s called, we just say “behind elevator” and we all know what we’re talking about.
---
Now imagine that fun on 144fps. Quite literally a completely different game

Nah man i played earlier some guy had numbers in his gamertag but they didnt show up in siege, but ive seen other people have the numbers show up

My friend and I racing to kill the hostage. He attempted to Fuze the hostage, but killed 3 enemies instead, so we just decided to go for the match win.

Great drawing dude keep up the good work
---
If you play ranked and ban Jackal or Caveira I sincerely hate you.
---
Neither is hard to counter and I love getting pinged by Jackal as it rings the doorbell for overzealous attackers. 
---
9/10 they literally run as fast as they can in the room fighting for kill. 
---
A good Jackal knows when to ping
---
A great Jackal knows you don't have to
---
I did, I wasn't expecting the second one to pop up
---
It's not been officially announced so no one knows for sure
---
Ash is Israeli, so it does make sense.
---
Can anybody link to a video of this issue?
---
Just wanna day the superior version of take me on is by reel big fish
---
Nice shot nonetheless.
---
Either a match on reworked Kanal or a match with my friend on fortress. Kanal because it was such a Nice team and good team i had. Fortress because we recruit rushed at every possible point
---
If you asked yesterday, the whole fuckin internet would have said DECEMBER 2 U IDIOT GAWD. 
---
Nobody knows.
---
I'm thinking, does  Hong Kong appears in the Chinese version of the game?
---
One good buff would be to allow her to grapple hook on internal balconies. That would instantly increase her versatility!
---
no
---
It is one of the worst shotguns at range. It has a wide spread and low damage. That's not great for range is it? No i didn't think so.  I made claims that's she low picked because she is. She even is on pc where she's better than she is on console. If you think you need extra proof you need to provide some yourself. Why is she not? Ela is useless to her team and almost every other operstor can do her jobs but better. Tell me how she isn't asides your own claims. 
---
The fo12 will not be completely fine. They're widening the spread, which is already much larger than other shotguns. They're lowering the damage even lower than it is. So now it won't be able to compete where every other shotgun can. You're hitting even less pellets and doing even less damage. There is no reason in all of siege now to really use the fo12 in any situation. A nerf is a nerf and when ubi provides only claims to say it needs a nerf that's bullshit. They have no proof that ela is constantly banned, yet everyone i talk to and every match I've played ela is never even played. You can't just say oh well gun sucks now. Because now ela will have no gun that's viable and she will tank in pick rate even more than she has.
---
Got two headshots with one mag of sledges SMG-11 secondary. Both headshots were in less than 2 seconds.
---
Okay but how many times did you died trying to do the grenade thing? Lmao
---
Good job. After 150 levels and no black ice
---
I prefer the mira where you had it prior, so I can escape from closet without having to run past a soft wall
---
I remember playing thermite for the first time and place a thermite charge on a soft wall. A lot has changed since then.
---
I agree! She shouldn't break the barricade until she gets through it. Also, another buff idea, I guess Amaru could grapple a hatch even though it is not yet open. It will just break if she gets through it.
---
Additionally, I don't know if this is a bug or what, but sometimes Amaru cannot grapple to the roof if she's from the ground floor. Like I mean if the building is 2 storey, she couldn't grapple on top of the building.
---
When I got an accidental flick one-gap headshot through a wall on outback because I just put my hand on my mouse and clicked

And still client side destruction.

A better way to phrase that is “when I played the game”
---
Kinda embarrassing.
---
They're probably labeled as the Chinese, instead of Hong Kong, operators
---
There's an newcomer playlist so you can avoid being stomped. But I feel you... I missed entirely Counter Strike because of the same reason. I joined late, and felt stomped. The difference here is that this game keeps getting content, whereas CSGO only had some maps here and there, and skins. But Siege is growing in all directions. Coping with some smurfs worth it...
---
Probably after 50 hours? But I started playing in the beta. Way less stuff to learn or at least, nobody knew and used. Now? I feel like it would probably take me 150 hours ingame minimum.

nah, the guy is right, I'm gonna take a wild guess and say you rush with Amaru, from what I've seen is that you are supposed to passively rush with her, like grapple the close but not in the line if site of the objective
---
He should be drawn and quartered for this.
---
1v3 clutch, 10 Health on ranked
---
This was actually earlier today when most of my team was Recruit and the last enemy killed my friend so I ran up the stairs and sprayed them down
---
Because you kill them while defending the objective instead of roaming around getting early kills or flanking them, which is what she meant to do.
---
Haha
---
I got the same one time but it was a 10 round ranked match because we got a draw one round
---
On ranked I play Tachanka, our lord and savior, and killed a Plat in a silver match. He ragequit, especially since it was a one tap headshot with the MG. Or getting an ace without realizing on Tower.
---
Yeah sorry about explanation. So when I do it through steam I am given an error about it running, but when I go to my uplay account to try there It just wont let me click the play option
---
Ok u/stephanlevs.
---
No, his ass
---
Lol i was about to say "i don't remember a 'volt' weapon in team fortress 2" xD
---
When my friend just got the game, we played T-Hunt where friendly fire damage is dampened, we went into a real match and he blew me away with Tachanka’s SG thinking the damage was the same :)
---
Actually, going far away to surprise the enemys proves effective aswell, but so does your comment.
---
what do you mean?
---
I have a uplay account is the thing with 2 step verification
---
WHAT IS THAT JESUS
---
no, I'm not jealous. not a bit
---
so did everyone else
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
My dad
---
He fucking teleported haha
---
Fortniwe nijna
---
I think he meant you have to blow his ass out in thanks, for a homie (no homo)
---
It might be your computer being too low spec , though it let my laptop at least launch it and my laptop has internal graphics and 4gigs of RAM
---
when I pick tachanka I always roaming :D
---
FINALLY ranking out at cardboard! Have been trying for the last 3 seasons to rank out in copper to get that damn charm. 
---
I feel disgustingly toxic.
---
Weird. Guess I never read her bio. Assumed she was American since she's FBI
---
If you have it installed on both steam and uplay it doesn’t work for some reason.. delete it from steam and launch it through uplay
---
Same thing basically if he shoots or melees, the hipfire is so inaccurate he has to ads. Really the mistake was already been made when he didnt melee mid animation.
---
My first ace with cav! 2v5 on tower
---
You rented a whole damn plane? Wow thats actually cool
---
Getting Team killed and kicked in my first Match ever. I had at that moment no clue that Tachanka was the troll choice.
---
except for the fact that I was able to carry us back to a victory after he rage quit... he was a total douche, he was spamming the chat with n-words and wasn't helping the team out at all, if you had read my previous comment he was going on one assist and three deaths and wasn't contributing to anyone at all. He had an RFF from killing me the previous round as well. He was being toxic, not being a newbie
---
Ahh yes what it’s like on PC the luxury
---
You know I be wearing these new yeezys
---
still better then normal matches though.
---
why not? just curious
---
getting a 4k by just walking through tunnel with the M870 is one,
---
Also those tachanka aces are the best.
---
But they gave away theirs as well. Its not just a damage trap but also a noise trap and that time they take to shoot it out or chuck an impact may be enough to stall them out long enough to stop the defuse.
---
hey i can tell this is on the xbox app but you don’t have to screen record. just press share and save clip and it download onto the phone.
---
You cant be knifed through a door you are barricading
---
He was there for us from the start, all of us. Watching us progress further. He never left us.
---
Yeah, we’ve seen that on the test server already. It’s also on [their website](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/shiftingtides/index.aspx) near the bottom.
---
That’s some big brain calculations right there
---
yeah, he seems more focused on complaining about how bad the situation is rather than trying to evaluate the best play option just beacuse all obvious options are at a disadvantage. Aka, a sore loser.
---
Most of the best memories in r6 are made from savage underdog moments like this. Saving KD is for the prima donnas. This is a team game.
---
Best Op I don't play him on defense because I like the two reinforcements option. Great for attacking though I am a fan of the 552 commando with frags and smokes.
---
Amen
---
When i fuzed he whole team in one go (oregon , just went to bathroom)

Right where I am.... between silver 1 and gold 2 anytime I play, cant get out of it.
---
His MP5 on defense is a good choice and the 870 is fun to meme with.
---
Recruit is enjoyable to play because it reminds me of when rainbow six wasn’t crazy
---
I would like to disagree.
---
Always start my gaming day with Recruit. No sights help tightens up my aim before the ranked starts.
---
are you saying the defender should do that or monty?
---
Uhhh... I can’t tell if this is a joke or not. If not, alt+f4 closes app. If it is a joke, then your joke is dry and unfunny
---
Anyone whining about bullet holes shouldn't be playing Siege.   Its the same as the people who whined about the 1 shot headshots when the game landed.     This is the game.
---
Are you meme-ing or being serious
---
Double aced. Accidentally picked sledge on the Brazil map. Went other side of obj and blew out the wall. Aced. Did it again the next attack round. 
---
Also my first game as fuze. First TK of my career and my first 3 kill round. Did it all wit the LMG and a suppressor and iron sights.
---
DIRTY!!!!!!!!  Your squad had to be screaming in the background.
---
Those dudes were garbage lol
---
BRING OSAS BACK
---
Siege isn’t a game about having a good kd. Some classes are way better at getting kills while others are meant to be more supportive and aren’t built for kills.
---
As an attacker, awesome, no probs. But I feel like it is pretty selfish to go recruit on defence. Why leave the team vulnerable like that?
---
Reported. He’s hacking.
---
yeah probaly would do that
---
i feel like since my sentence started with the opposite of the meaning of my post some people arent understanding. the monty cant lose.
---
Quiting the game...
---
Before we start 2020 confirmed
---
No.
---
It’s within the next couple days
---
no because it doesn't exists yet, but should be tuesday.
---
(unless delayed). and these should be the times
---
PC: 9 AM EST / 14:00 UTC
---
PS4: 10 AM EST / 15:00 UTC
---
XBOX: 11 AM EST / 16:00 UTC
---
Expected downtime: 1 hour
---
Big bRuH
---
All recruit 4-0 10 win streak on Ranked placement! Of course that can’t be done anymore...
---
Well obviously.
---
Would make him less versatile: 1) thats Not the function of Mira windows 2) why Putting lmg in windows leading outside when they could easy Headshot you without the shield 3) If He Puts a shield before the lmg it has the Same function only that He has the shield ON the lmg. Like that you gave it some thoughts but maybe a Bit more next time ;)
---
I'd be so mad if this happened  to me
---
Is that a no...
---
It is a suppressor lol
---
no. but should be tuesday.
---
Cheerio
---
If it's a clip on your friends account you can't directly save it. You can only save your clips :)
---
Isn’t it on December the second?
---
Haha, using common means of expressing emotion through text is immature? Yeah, idk about that buddy 😬😬😬
---
I want to See that when its finished Mate
---
But he can shoot you
---
Monday?
---
Most of the times i use valk for doing some aggressive run-outs in sky scrapper, consulate ,border  Oregon  , but people scan through valk cams and attackers will destroy it , it's just gets annoying when it happens every single round
---
As a maestro main this pleases me
---
That’s actually God-Tier
---
When I got an ace clutch
---
I dont see a better alternative to the current system regarding what you are talking about
---
Yeah, true.
---
The common arguments you hear are "can't do it due to engine limitations" or "it is not siege like".
---
I'm tempted to make another picture of the buff idea!
---
4 years of this trash ass game one of the if thee worst communities in the history of gaming. Shit servers, stale ass gameplay, microtransactions rammed down your throat, no skill involved. Oh don't worry the dick riders on this game are crazy, overall 0/10 if I could give it a lower score I would. FUCK this trash-ass-garbage-ass-cash-grab-head-ass-looking- game
---
Wouldn't ubi have told us by now though, because they release the date the day before the drop, right
---
Simplay Said: how about a Operator that doesnt activate traps. Not your Idea but Id Like that in the game.
---
Idk man I just googled it xd
---
Glad you like it!
---
Changing resolution no.. HOWEVER 
---
Modifying the in game files to achieve a noticeable advantage by causing missing textures or highly degraded textures or making operator skins a significantly different color than the background colors can AND USUALLY will result in a ban.
---
There's a few methods through NVidia inspector to achieve better FPS through lowering texture quality but I will not be sharing them here I don't know if the methods still work but it is bannable now.
---
A youtuber got it once they got to 1 million subs so either that or in alpha packs good luck.
---
Thought of that too, would be pretty nice
---
You did the right thing
---
I loved both of them! Sorry some try hards are so goddamn rude. Makes everyone here look bad.
---
Thanks
---
No you can only get current pro league sets
---
Then a support class shouldn’t die considering they do their job correctly I.e. Monty. I don’t Think you take into account that most “support” ops are fully capable of top fragging
---
I believe December 3rd (Tuesday)
---
To all who commented, thanks for the info, have a nice day, and a nice siege
---
I mean one player is better than some armour but I mean, I used to be a Rook main so no, you were in the right
---
Couldn't agree more. A lot of people in Siege are very toxic and immature.
---
8
---
Nope, not me.
---
Aight I’m not gonna f with that I’ll just change the res
---
Its Like glaz, too strong or too weak, hard to Balance
---
Wait really?
---
Yea since the top outside hatch in kafe is not reachable to reinforce.
---
God damn it. thanks for telling me.
---
There's no easy solution that wouldn't get exploited.
---
Would be funny for sure. Might be too powerful with shields tho
---
Oh nice
---
Another Troll
---
This is why my group has started a Fuze ban, join the resistance
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Idk what you're trying to say.
---
Sure how
---
Hello xAsroilu,

Itali short acog
---
Ngl buck probably has pecs that make the rock look like a pipsqueak
---
Restart your game.
---
Clashes shield says bikini meaning Bikinibodhi
---
Yes! It was awesome
---
Hes speaking facts though. They cant do anything about it without boosters exploiting it
---
I did
---
My best memory when i killed one guy with 2-3 bullets and another one guy through the wall
---
Game sound?
---
Just a maple leaf covering his junk, cmon Ubi, you can do it lol
---
As a buck main, I am with Ubisoft in this occasion
---
Wouldent that make it a old version of the deagle?😂
---
Checked everything
---
Is it happening only in the game or for the whole PC/console?
---
Unranked does have skill matchmaking right? My 2nd account is level 30 but I get put with gold 2s In unranked
---
I guess. Is that necessarily a bad thing? : )
---
Ash gang rise up
---
Just siege. PS4 party works, MW game chat works
---
Learn the maps and their best spots to roam and wait for attackers. That’s the thing that’s helped me most.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I haven't had that happen before, I can't help you there
---
I remember when recruit shield was used in pl
---
hm... probably acing with GIGN recruit in overtime. it was my first ace ever, and was completely by accident. I found a chill group of guys and we had a blast playing together, but on the last round, two of them left. so we were on defense on Kanal, in a 3v5 against a team who we had no idea how we'd been beating before. so we decided "fuck it, recruit time." I went GIGN with shotty and revolver, and roamed while my teammates held down the bombs. two of them got cocky and rushed bridge, so they died. next, I picked one off on stairs with revolver. by that point, an IQ had made it to site and killed both of my teammates, so I went back to site and dispatched her. The last enemy was Fuze, and he had the defuser. he sent a charge through the ceiling and put me at like 15 health- things were dire. so one of the random guys I'm playing with (who I'm now good friends with) goes "Hide behind my shield, I have an idea." and in All-chat, I see him go "HE'S AFK IN BASEMENT, JUST GO PLANT." for some reason, that poor fuze took the bait, and went to plant on B. I vault the shield and run over just in time for him to still be finishing the animation, and bang, overtime recruit ace incorporating some silly bait. I'm still pretty new, and sometimes get a bit discouraged by toxicity or my own lack of skill, but when I remember stuff like this it makes me smile and play on.
---
Why is there so many operator main on this?!?
---
Because it will be pretty much useless, they can’t do updates everyday on console. 
---
Games that can do updates every are beta.
---
Makes it not as unique but u do have a point? Any ideas? After the first shot the recoil is difficult, reduce second shot recoil and have each shot more balanced between them. (Easier to predict)
---
Pmm says hi
---
Skill based matchmaking is a myth. I just got an ace a little bit ago in like a 2v5
---
Guess you disagree with what people are saying in PL but ey wait see what happens once they in PL
---
I felt it was basically Call of Duty gameplay with none of the elements that make Siege interesting. That's why I personally hated it.
---
ShEs a PhAnToM
---
Just check this sub sorted by "hot" and a stickied post will appear at the top basically the second the information is released
---
Yeah bro I agree I always wanted hostage on bank but with a few red characters
---
Hello GreenieHere, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e4pj4t/scared_of_the_stim_pistol_1min/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That would be way OP. Locking the defense out when everyone is roaming and not on objective? LOL
---
I thought about a one way invisible shield op that makes things behind it disappear while standing still
---
Good news everyone!
---
Nice . The enemy team potato aimed so badly tho
---
Hahaha shit would be so funny
---
Good job. This video could have been 2+ minutes shorter.
---
Castle is actually very good, many don't know how to use his effectively
---
I’m giggling just thinking about it LOL!
---
Yea sorry i didn’t know how long to clip it and I’m kinda stupid
---
That’s your problem for not re-queueing
---
They'll care when they see the current stats.
---
Everyone apart from the cheats has stopped playing the game.
