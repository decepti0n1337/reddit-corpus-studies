Stop flexing bud RNGesus is just good to you

I usually roll my eyes at these types of suggestions. But this one I’m interested in. Maybe it doesn’t even need to be useable from a drone. There are already some crazy abilities in siege. If this one was implemented properly it could be quite useful without being too over powered
---
A friend and I*
---
How the hell did he just randomly find that out?
---
It probably only reaches to the back of the toilet model.
---
Atomic GU
---
That’s part of the belt
---
It’s because you’re on orange team right?
---
He vibing tho I ain’t even stressing my mans is groovin
---
I’m gonna try this
---
Im pretty sure one of echo’s primary skins called rekt is a direct rip from one of capitao’s purble LMG skins
---
It’s better with volume... lol
---
Toilet Shitboxes
---
I made it an attacker since characters like twitch, iq, and thatcher are already so powerful, and mozzie needs more to do than hack normal drones and a occasional shock drone. Also nomad in high ranked games (The highest rank I've ever gotten is plat 2 in grim sky and rn am a gold 3) and in the competitive scene is banned a lot and claymores in pro league aren’t that big of a deterrent. 
---

---
Plus, imo Maverick’s blowtorch doesn’t need a counter due to the devs making it louder and making the time to switch slower.
---
I’ve literally opened around 4-5 hundred by now and only have three black ice skins

Dri paloski xopaxo

Wait, this wrong on SOOOOO many levels...like boi ur playing with a compressed res, then ur teammate...where is this casual, I want it

Hold up

Then you didn't draw it.

Lmao pls no
---
Makes me wanna buy special event packs lol
---
I think you mean *shit*boxes
---
Pls send one over :c
---
make one that catches relativistic kill missiles from outer space?
---
Thank you. If you care, i had some other good ideas if you wanna view my profile. I’m not a dev that knows balancing characters all that well, but I do think they are at least somewhat applicable ideas.
---
To be honest, wouldn't even be mad
---
Wouldn't even be mad.
---
Why?
---
somebody called? :v
---
Couldn't find it, but I'll take it down
---
textures and shaders do a lot to trick the eye
---
It would be the greatest Pro League strat.
---
Oooh yeah, just like a valk cam.
---
I mean..they just kinda added them now in the game that has more reused stuff than sieges new ops
---
Probably the way they changed match making. I think you get paired with people around your skill
---
Increase the fire rate of all guns without changing recoil.
---
Im a dude I swear
---
Thing is I’m generally the top of my team for every match. Which is why I’m confused.
---
I fell sorry for you OP, have an upvote and ignore the people who are taking this meme way too seriously
---
Doesn’t count the elo sadly
---
??
---
Yeh idk how to feel about that tbh
---
Smurfing was always a thing and everyone has to deal with it...
---
The thing is... you can’t avoid it... it’s not even ppl with spare accounts... also it can also happen that a gold player has to deal with a lot of „noob“/troll mates so he deranks down to bronze or just had focus problems/had no warm up before his 10 rank in games...
---
I know it can be frustrating but meanwhile i just see it as a challenge... fck ranks... honestly... ranks are bs you should simply try to give your best...
---
Btw... yes, I have a smurf account too... but I don’t intentionally lose matches to play against weaker players... and hell no do I not make fun of the enemies then if they are not that good... often I actually try to give tips in chat...
---
At the end of the day there are even more factors to justify smurfing imo...
---
I use it to relax a little or if I don’t feel as focused as I could... usually my main is somewhere between plat-gold and my smurf somewhere in gold... so not rly a big difference 
---
As long as you don’t do it just to feel better :p
---
But even in that case... There are even worse types of toxicity!!
---
You always have to deal with that sht....
---
CSGO would like a word
---
Is there such thing as silver V or silver 5
---
One reason is if you have friends that play on console, that's why I primarily play on console.
---
Just curious, how these people have the courage to send pics to the public that they've been DDOSing, it honestly confuses me
---

I don’t think there is a system... dealing with the same thing tho

Especially in unranked I already faced a couple of full stack 200+ lvl player which destroyed me(170) and the rest of my &lt;80 team lul

Okay, so some people actually like to guess what characters are the memojis, so I didn't put name tags. I will, however, but them right here 👇 so don't scroll down or read ahead if you don't want to be spoiled! ⚠️🚧 From top left to bottom right, we have Mozzie, Blackbeard, Castle (Hitter), Lesion (Summer Cool), Doc (Invitational), Montagne, Lion, Rook, Goyo, Amaru (no bandana), Echo (no mask), Blitz (Elite), Vigil, Sledge, Maverick, Clash, Male Hostage, Female Hostage, Bartlett University Student, Dr. Mackintosh, Boyd Brooks, Outbreak Recruit, Harry, Nick, Paulie Baker, Ash (Invitational), and Mira (Invitational).
---
Lmfaoo that ping tho
---
This is beautiful but it might actually be ubi servers cause i thought the other team was ddosing me and a 4 man group on my team but then i got grouped with the enemy team after and they thought we were ddosing lol
---
OK then. Just make it 1740 rpm to fire 69s. The only downside to this gun would be the overheating barrel. So let's make it swappable.
---
Cool idea but I don't think it should be invisible. Maybe it could camo but can be detected.
---
It might actually be because it happened with two different enemy teams in back to back ranked games.
---
I love this
---
Definitely! They should start by adding russian optics on nomad's ak (duh), I love the scope variety in battlefield 4 and escape from tarkov!
---
They will do a rollback but that’s not the same as “receiving their elo”, you just get the elo you lost to them back
---
The tachanka doesn't like chunky enough
---
No MP5 skin can ever look good because of the mag never changing colour. I just stick with default.
---
Nuh uh this is legit... I mean look at the operator picture, you can’t tell me that that doesn’t look legit
---
I don't think a gadget should mess with the defuser, I feel like that's too far.
---
There is a site you can have open on a phone/PC/tablet called R6 maps I think
---
Will show you destructible walls etc I used to use after finding the objective to quickly plan a route
---
Once you do that a few times you will play the maps your own way your comfortable
---
Biggest advice (and yes I stole it from a film)
---
Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
---
Thanks m8 🍻
---
It doesn’t actually defuse, it just emit a noice that makes it sound like you are defusing. Sorry if i was confusing you.
---
Is it weird I read this in a David Attenborough voice...
---
No warden is the best warden. I would rather have the lord on my side than him.
---
I just typically walk forward and then get shot in the head
---
I personally love the charm, as it has a great color scheme, and it's a glowing charm as well. One of my favorite charm I have so far.
---
I mean... have you actually seen gameplay footage of the new Modern Warfare?
---
I don't see any reused assets.
---
Skins in this game are so silly. They could be making a killing on better quality art... Csgo got some dope skins, take a page from their book. Having said that don't take devs off improving the game
---
When i tried on controller I got absolutely demolished
---
Disgusting. I suck balls at this game but I would NEVER resort to cheating
---
I know that it’s rate of fire is on the low side... but I honestly can’t explain it. Something about the feel of it when I fire it just clicks with me. Also it’s special reflex along with a partial AR feel just feels amazing.
---
not rly, she ran into the room and got to the laudry machine before he even has the c4 out. i have no idea beyond sheer panic as to why he blew the c4

For Console new accounts are free but OC each one costs for new copy.

No

I love reflex tho

Distributed denial of service. Basically spamming the server so hard that it causes intense lag. Usually involves bots
---
That sentence doesn't make sense .. can you claficate what do you mean "(Warden was supposed to be one)"
---
No it’s clearly not in game, the direction and shadows along with the hanging thing’s direction just doesn’t add up
---
When you’re tickling the enemies ribs with the barrel of your gun and miss 14/16 shots
---
A slight rate of fire buff on both operators rifles would be great
---
Reminds me of the chimneys on OG Nuketown in Black Ops.
---
Chill dog

I see a bunch if comments on how this is supposed to be good, can somebody PLEASE explain to me why this is good news

Question: does Ubi still only doing account banning and not ISP banning? Don't get me wrong, I'm glad these guys are getting served, but if they don't move to ISP banning, these guys can just switch to a different on their console and keep going

They are fucking learning the game! Ill just cha cha real smooth, practice my angles and shit...

/sigh, how many times is this going to come up? shes based off of danish special forces, real life soldiers, what are the chance of Call of Duty maybe just maybe also being inspired by real life danish soldiers
---
It’s common knowledge that the adapters are undetectable because they emulate a controller, so only what is possible with a regular controller is possible with a keyboard and mouse on console.
---
 If ubisoft were to add leaning without ADS, it would have to be possible to do with a controller in order for the keyboard and mouse adapters to use it too.. it’s not possible to add functionality to 1 input method without also adding the same function to another input method.
---
New guns would be nice for once and operators that can actually do stuff go yo is alright but amra is useless
---
Pdw looks awesome. Let’s see that one
---
Don't use the fmg-9. They took my * sobs * baby boy's impacts...
---
Use the shotgun. In which case, I use either the reflex or iron, with a laser sight for better distance and sight clarity.
---
With the shotgun comes an excuse to use the incredibly broken SMG-11. Flash hider, vertigrip, laser, reflex. All you need now is recoil control.
---
You do know that Attack Spook Lady is based on a Danish Frogman right?
---
hax (and it takes 3-tk's to get banned)
---
I'm not sure but i think that you get them with the standard edition. There's of course the descriptions in the different versions that tell you what you get
---
Warden is honest to god probably the worst defender
---
the ranked MMR doesn't seem to count for much in Casual (it has it's own MMR), also the rank clamp only works in ranked to avoid plat boosting their copper firends
---
Kaid.
---
Warden is probably the worst DLC operators introduced into Siege.
---
me do not get it, ooga booga
---
Oh I can’t steal the game oh no guess I will just go complain that I can’t pirate a game
---
I know, that is why I like them. Forgot about the legion thing
---
I came out in high gold and now I’m in low bronze. Sad, but the ranking system is trash. That is, unless you have a team. Likely if you don’t, you’ll get a team that doesn’t know what their doing, for the rank you’re at.
---
Yeah, I read about it on steam, but I didn’t see anything.  However, I could’ve very easily missed it; I will take another look.  Thanks
---
Its to late anakin I already used my credit card
---
It's happening literally every season, you get a lot from the start and then slowly get less
---
Someone’s going to reply with git gud but this is actually true

I play on both only trash gold 2 on pc but on Xbox I’m a plat 1 hopefully diamond this season but when I started to play pc siege after I learned a bit of the newonce of pc gaming and learned to press the right keys didn’t take that to long send ei took like 6 computer classes in high school and college combined but back the point I feel there is no real difference asides it’s easier to move on console but easier to flick on pc that is really the only difference for me and sorry there’s no punctuation I am on a phone and don’t feel like to press 3 buttons every time I want proper punctuation chö
---
Except from the placement matches I’ve only played like 4 games and I’m already getting 44 for winning i don’t know why. Maybe it’s because they take into consideration how hard you won or lost because in the 4th game I won 4-2 and it only gave me 44, it’s confusing.
---
r/shittydesign
---
a good step in getting to plat is playing shitty ops, avoid any good ops like thermite, doc, ash, twitch or maestro or play with the p90, it worked for me for like 3 seasons in a row, the secret ingredient is semi-auto shotguns and lmg's
---
This is the complete opposite of "Literally unplayable"
---
How so?
---
Thank you
---
Get this man a shoulder massage.
---
That extra 28 points really but him in another league above you huh
---
**sighs** [TSK]
---
Why would anyone accept the humiliation on purpose though? Whenever someone tries that on me I either go on the other way or just leave the match.
---
warden is more fun tbh
---
Lesion is my second favorite defense op. Would very much recommend him
---
No, although I hope they do change the names of real weapons to avoid copyright as a solution to add new guns.
---
Ok dudes: The DDOS Problem is mostly on console. U can google it, the dumb kiddos who do this shit have not the money for a PC and the software for ddos attacks can everybody download. They don’t understand that DDOSing is not funny, it’s criminal and u can go for 2 years in jail for this shit. 
---
Second: Ubisoft have no servers. They only rent some servers from Amazon AWS. So u can’t only blame Ubisoft, u have to blame Amazon too. 
---
I can put in links to prove my text later. 
---
Sorry for the grammar.
---
The world has changed now!!!
---
Is he banne din ranked. And is he a roamer
---
Im lvl 270+ and was never in a DDOS lobby. I know that it exist, but popular?
---
Flushless*
---
warden is worse than tachanka dude buy kaid
---
The difference in ELO is 1028 points and OP is upset that extra 28 points is over the 1k limit. I understand the frustration but he’s also a whole rank above OP anyway.
---
Bro wtf. You need Jesus
---
Oh so you’re a serial killer!
---
I can feel it
---
During, so the elo wasn't gained.
---
what
---
Lesion
---
He's not banned often, I'd say 2/10 games max. And he *can* be a roamer. I prefer to play him close to objective since his gadget gives great intel. You can see where the traps are, and one goes off, you know where the enemy is. 
---
I'd say if you want a roamer Vigil would be better. But my absolute favorite op is Caveira and she's an amazing roamer and just so fun to play once you get the hang of her
---
We can't queue with people 28 points away, so why should we play with them? Also, this player was diamond for the previous 3 seasons.
---
huh
---
it’s clear satire
---

I was thinking Canary because of the shitty series the arrow but then I thought I’ll let everyone else decide.

I was the same 2 seasons ago. Ended up getting to play 2 that season. This season i finally got to plat 1 solo queing. Keep going dude

keep in mind that he is getting fucking ddossed and normally you just give up at that point

I love it when they let you kill them like that

Hi, I'm his underpaid lawyer. What's the problem?
---
Blitz Buff leaked
---
It used to be like this before; An update back in Operation Chimera (may have been Parabellum, too) removed the animation (maybe unintentionally?). Definitely glad it made a comeback, though.
---
Although it would unbalance the game a bit, I’m all for it. Sick of seeing the same 4 constantly
---
Im stuck in gold 3 now, was gold 2 yesterday but I'm just not given any good teammates

I main nomad and lemme tell you, you did an amazing job :D

Place it near doors and windows so that they can't shoot it

Oh okay! Thank you
---
Two reasons I can see being possible: Either the Plat guy was sitting in queue forever, or he was partied up with  people your MMR and your team having a higher MMR pool.
---
Gun play as in talking with and working with your team. Probably should have said gameplay instead. But the gun play is rewarding, too. Headshots are pretty satisfying.
---
I have never seen it end while holding the hostage, so unless someone else knows different, I'd say there is no time limit
---
Alright cool time to do infinite overtime

Nice...

Wasn't this a skin in bo4?

---
Actually I'm gonna have to wait to get a second just so I can't get kicked
---
Vigil definitely has the better primary and I think he is funner to play. Basically playing vigil you are solely focused on your roam and getting frags. I would pick vigil.
---
I personally have been living Mozzie lately. He has great guns, amazing gadget, c4 and is a 3 speed. Just something to think about down the road when you are choosing others ops.
---
Nah, some retard making malicious edits

Thx man

can't think of any reason besides it being standard for all pro league sets, can you check others?

Ah Thanks...looks already very Good...solid 5/7

Mozzie has the aussi flag on his Headgear and Uniform.

Hell yeah headshots are satisfying, especially when you line it up perfectly and fire off one single suppressed bullet and see the little X pop up
---
Aye, no witchhunting

How am I supposed to know that you are not including yourself in the comment? I can talk from a third person perspective and still include myself, also, by the look of the comment it looked like you were including yourself, it was just a misunderstanding, you know it happens a lot on the internet and real life right? There is no need to call me "absolute bot" when I never disrespected you and it was just a misunderstanding. People get tilted so fast these days.

That sounds unintended and broken.
---
The best part of the game is pretending your drone is a teenager running and hiding from a crazed murderer in a horror movie.
---
I feels as though it undermines their impact slightly, not particularly to score but when people look at your stats, if it says you have 2k points but 0 kills assists and deaths, it would be harder to understand than if they had 3 assists

I get that there are a few "invisible" ways to help the team, but the reward for that is the win no? Fair enough if you want more stats, I just don't really see the point.

thanks you too
---
What your aim?
---
Looool

To be honest it depends how you do it, some of it is toxic, like teabagging around and dancing and shit for 30 seconds and then FINALLY killing the guy (or not at all and he just bleeds out)

Fortnut bad Minecraft gud, I’m so funny guys

And here we spot a wild red dot suppressor user
---
I don't think they did tbf. I think we were just 0.01 of a second off
---
Huh :/
---
Assuming you mean he's the last alive, just make him think you're there until he's out of time and has to stick the defuse. Then you can walk up and kill him.

100% theres a new hack client site out as well, rip

I think all the weapons I've done got requested by their mains lol

well to me it doesn’t really prove anything cause they can be from different servers and if your console the servers might be shit on console but they are great for me on pc so idk

Well I'll be damned, it's legit

You can stream and still be cheating.

You're claiming that you were falsely banned twice, on two different accounts, at different times?

I remember when Minecraft was the meme game that everyone takes the piss out of. Will Fortnite end up being cool in 5 years time?

It’ll be cool in like a year and a half, Minecraft never lost popularity, people just acted like they hated it to be cool

I wish i could have this luck i was close to plat and now i am silver 2

It's acceptable toxicity. This a game where you kill people, not practice good manners.

Ah yes, I clearly remember when that operation came out

The music you hear on Border near the armory is Persian, which is odd because the map is on Iraq and they speak Arabic. It's a wedding song actually.

I'm sure you can stream and still cheat, but if you look at how I've played, and how I've always played. There's literally no way I'm cheating. I'm a PC Gold 3 at best. If I was cheating wouldn't I be playing better?

They use Microsoft Azure servers. They can only implement servers wherever Microsoft places them. The reason why they use Microsoft Azure is because of the Microsoft TrueSkill MMR system which is what siege uses. Until Microsoft has permanent and viable server solutions in the Middle east, Ubisoft can't do anything.

Bullets land at the tip of the acog sight and the helmet border isn't part of the players hitbox. Just because your crosshair was over his head at some moment doesn't make it a headshot. The gun has to fire while in that position. Honestly that is Hitbox Porn.

The leaning speed curve is the same. If you wan't to make faster lean movements. Move a little in the direction of where you are leaning. This is because the lean animation slows down near the end. This might be hard with a controller but you can try. 
---
and as the other guy says you can lean without adsing.

It does not always objectively make echo a smart ban... you’re assuming every team has a good echo player. Or even someone who mains echo at all. Banning him regardless instead of dealing with him as a good team or player is basically an echo witch hunt. It’s just ridiculous how paranoid people are. 
---
All of you’re arguments are based on every single solo queue player and every single team having an echo main or someone good enough to play him. I’ve seen way more bad echo players than legit good ones. You’re arguing an extreme. 
---
All I’m saying is instead of people feeing the extreme position you are taking, maybe players should work to become more skilled at handling him. You’re stance? Why not make it easier and just ban him anyways. 
---
That is the epitome of a lazy ass siege player. Regardless of skill. Regardless of experience. 
---
Im not calling you directly a lazy ass. I’m sure you’re great and very experienced and knowledgeable about the game. All I’m saying is when people always assume the worst, go on an echo witch hunt, and then hold the stance of “why be better at the game and learn how to handle him when you can just ban him” is just a pure lazy ass stance to take. Not to mention a scared and defeated attitude underneath it all.

You know we straight with doin your mom
---
I’m doin your mom. Yes yours!
---
I first saw her in the Wal-Mart pickin out your drawers.
---
Big Dolly Parton hair like an 80s prom queen
---
But her ass was lookin good all up in those mom-jeans.
---
I approached her in the checkout line, and said yo baby wassup?
---
She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin at her jugs.
---
Five minutes later she agreed to get with me
---
So we went and rocked the minivan like Giggity. Giggity. Giggity.
---
I was ridin your mom like she was Mario Kart.
---
I gave her a lift back to her crib cause her car wouldn’t start.
---
She invited me in the house, and we started makin out again.
---
How many times I tap that ass? OVER 9000!
---
Yeah. She called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it.
---
She later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it.
---
Cause she knows how I like it, and that I’m a little young
---
To be in the bed, butt-naked doin your mom.
---
I like your mamas big butt, and I cannot lie.
---
You other brothers can’t deny that she’s fly.
---
We make sexy time, yes and every night I tap that.
---
She saw me butt-naked, now she thinks I’m half black.
---
But your moms the best, the super M.I.L.F.
---
Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain’t a chef
---
And I blame it on the al-al-al-cohol
---
But If I were you, I wouldn’t kiss your mom on the mouth at all.
---
She likes the Donkey-Punch. She likes the Dirty Sanchez.
---
Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed.
---
She likes rough sex with handcuffs and I’ll be honest
---
She likes me to Cris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna.
---
She’s so therapeutic. When I need to cure my restlessness
---
I br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br motorboat your moms breastestess.
---
I didn’t wanna tell you, but I had to write this song

I’m havin sex with your mother

That makes me better than you.

Better that than being t-bagged as I was when this happened to me. You let him go on his own will

Respect for your team for those callouts. I got gold 2 this morning then knocked down to silver 3 :(
---
ACOG or the CPU gets it ASH!
---
I know what he meant, but changes always have a reason anyway. Why would they redo things they decided were bad ideas? A better idea for an event would be a mode with only vanilla operators from my perspective.

I like to imagine it's actually Buck losing his shit

In a team fight, pengu can support his team better with more strategical play. Beaulo is like a stallion, raw untamed fragging potention, mechanically beaulo is pretty godlike. I think in a 1v1 it would be hard for anyone to beat beaulo if not impossible. However, In a team situation I think pengu will prevail 8/10 times. Beaulo is the type of play that you put with a really strong objective oriented team and just let him loose to go frag crazy while the entire rest of the team picks off the rotation and gets the plant down. Pengu on the other hand can cooperate and work as a unit with his team. Beaulo could be compared to letting a mongoose into a rattlesnake den while his team of mice push in and start to build a nest. Pengu on the other hand is like a pack of lions everyone fills a role to take down the water buffalo and works cooperatively.
---
I personally wouldn't do it that way. We'll see what ubi does (if they do anything at all)
---
Or maybe the E3 version if you don't know what I mean The Rainbow Channel has two videos of gameplay from back then
---
Nonononononono
---
device placed!
---
The gun doesn't fire at that moment tho. Check the bullet count.
---
Apes. Stronger. Together
---
It's about time they're doing something about this. The number of times I have been in a siege game and this shit has happened the answer may shock you...
---
We should actually speak about who best fulfills a particular role . Because in siege whoever is capable of playing the role best contributes the most to the team. For example , we cannot compare Kanto and Goga with frags as the parameter.
---
What was the other thing flying at you?
---
Zofia is super meta. Versatile, can play vertically very well, good gun, her pistol has a red dot, and she can self rez if she gets downed, and she never gets banned. 
---
Ela is  super fun to play if you like to leave site. If you play lesion, ela is good to have as a backup because she doesn't get banned as much as lesion but she can kind of fill a similar role with the grzmot mines. Super fast rof and a good shotgun get gets slept on all day, pistol has a red dot, and she's 3 speed. If you pick ela, try to stay pretty close to your enemies especially if you're on console. Aim for the head because that SMG is a pee-shooter. If you wanna spawn peak with ela I recommend you use the pistol lol.
---
Oh boy i didn't even know that was coming  
---
Still 5 months away but that's good to hear
---
Maybe wall hacks, it's hard to say from one instance like this. I would not call him out for hacking just from this one clip
---
Comtacs, Better modding, Working Armor, PIP optics.
---
Bruh that was so well said :)
---
He was. He had enough time to trick if he didn't get distracted by the impact, but then again, who wouldn't?
---
And hear you pull up and put the phone down
---
I know what you mean, but that would fr be way too much effort for ubi
---
Yeah totally
---
KD doesn't matter, especially 1.11 and a 1.21.  The difference is next to nothing tbh. Dude could have 1k kills, and like 900 deaths, etc. Or 11k and 10k deaths.   
---
Reason he's matched, is either a friend is a higher rank, i.e. plat. Or just unfortunate matchmaking, which is msotly the case. I've soloq as plat3 this season, and went against 3stack diamonds, with two plat 3s on their team.
---
Noice
---
But tbh that's the game I always wanted
---
!ragus
---
I dont think that screen shows current ELO but just thr highest reached this season. If he did get carried to plat and fell back down that would make sense. I may be wrong though. Havent been on the tracker in a bit.
---
Rank absolutely matters, unless someone got boosted to their rank, which you can't tell just from a screenshot. KD is what doesn't matter in this situation, because even though OP has a higher KD, his is when playing against high Gold and low Plat players, while the enemy has a lower KD while playing against high Plats and Diamonds, so you can't use that to compare their skills. 
---
You could be 10 times better than me and have a 1.0 KD in Diamond and I could have really good aim and nothing else and, because of that, be stuck in low Gold, playing against much worse players, fragging all day long with a 2.0+ KD, but you would still destroy me in a real match.
---
I didn't even think that could happen
---
The way you looked at blackbeard. "Bitch excuse you!!!" 😂
---
He needs somewhere to fit his machine gun and stand... So i put a massive backpack on him, in the game i have no idea where he puts it..... 🤔😲💩
---
Or you could use a mic ?
---
no.
---
At first I was like: well you were close to the soft wall-
---
Then: ... ok, the fuck
---
Are u serious?. My bad I have something better than the game to spend 20 seconds on. Jesus Christ
---
Me 2
---
so satisfying!
---
It’s great. Wouldn’t go back to without pick and ban
---
if you can’t play the whole game then don’t queue. it’s pretty simple
---
Fair enough.
---
Thank you fellow Detailer
---
Thanks a ton
---
Thermite breach kill &gt; sledge hammer kill
---
I like it and I don’t think it was a failed,but the thing I hate about are the common bans (Jackal,Cav,Echo and Ect.) when solo que(ing)
---
But is a high advantage in a 4/5 stack
---
You’re actually being serious.
---
Shoutout to the homies that remember the commando speed glitch with the flare when the game first came out.
---
Haha, its not that tks happens that often, but when it happens it is quite anoying that we lose two players. It happens straight away when the tk happens. Its not like anyone shoot at the downed teammate
---
So basically you are a dick to everyone The_CPM917. Just cuz someone holds your view but not to the amount that you do, doesn’t mean that they are a bad person in your view. Grow up and let someone have a more neutral stance than you. That’s not asking much, and not even asking you to even tolerate people that have an opposite opinion. That is only asking you to tolerate people that are more neutral than you.
---
I would like to see again the Secure objective misión in Ranked. We ( the random people) are not pro league players.
---
Then don’t step away if you’re queuing for ranked or unranked? It only takes a 1-2minutes
---
I think we have to see the whole scoreboard to make any judgments. Not saying you didn't get screwed, but if your team had you as the lowest rank, and everyone else was plat 2 and a plat 1 just within 1,000 elo, it's not crazy you're playing against a plat 1.
---
Wait you're right... so I was hearing Thermite inside, I thought so. But does capitao have any white on his uniform? Cause who ever is on the roof has white on their uniform, and I thought capitao had an all black outfit.
---
can you honestly not tell lol it’s common sense. if you can’t play for the whole game then don’t queue. it’s really not difficult
---
You shlould've stop to see if you could keep your head in the back ahaha
---
If on mobile, go to the sub main page, click the options button (3 dots in the top right on Android), and click change user flair.

Is there anything you would change to prevent these "knee jerk" bans? Or do you think it'll change over time to a higher variance?

You got on the lucky end for a fact, any match I played when they hit the servers it's usually gone within 5 seconds

Funny how you decided whether or not it was accidental before watching the clip

there’s literally nothing they can do about it. it’s been said a million times.

I was really confused for a second but then I realized you painted it. Good job

You gotta change something related to glowing in settings i guess

I’ve never had one like this where the whole server crashed at the end, I’ve been in ones where they stress the server while we prep so we can’t prep the defense, then stop, try to get the plant down &amp; stress it again so we can’t diffuse. 
---
These guys were bad at it. They let us prepare with traps and shotguns so we went up 3-0 then on attack he tried just stressing the whole 3 minutes but we were able to clip through it. Without Gridlock we lose.

MP5 doesn’t have a particularly high damage output compared to other guns, but from my experience the power doesn’t come from the damage but rather the consistency. Consistent recoil and consistent headshots for days!
---
The timeing in seige can be so unlucky or very lucky with not a whole lot in between
---
Recruit is literally useless. Doesn’t provide anything to the team. Doesn’t bring anything to the table. You can play any operator with the same guns that actually have attachments and utility to help out the team. Ranked is suppose to be competitive so it doesn’t make any sense to keep recruit in there. Go play causal if you wanna run recruit
---
God no, Doc needs a nerf. MP5 needs a nerf. We dont need any of that crap.

Sorry for that. That‘s German style.

nice shit post LUL

Why do people always feel like nerfing everything would help at all? The game does have some serious problems but balancing between ops is currently not that much of a problem
---
God I hate t baggers
---
They already took my Jäger and Bandit ACOG. But for god's sake, at least leave me the remaining ones!
---
Warden has a gadget that counters flashes and smokes (just like Jäger), but can also counter Capitao smokes (which cannot be destroyed by Jäger's ADS). For some reason Ubi thought he was too powerful I guess just like Nökk so they didn't [give them new weapons](https://i.redd.it/zugi8gjyney21.png). [Keep in mind this "leak" probably wasn't fake since Nökk had a Galil in playtest](https://www.twitch.tv/pengu/clip/DistinctOpenStingrayFreakinStinkin?filter=clips&amp;range=30d)

I just added you I'm cptcnnbll

No need to be sorry! I learned something new today!
---
Ain’t this supposed to be rainbow six?
---
I mean you are on PC typing I think would've been easier lol.
---
It would be funny if they end up making Jackal the way he was at launch, it only took the community 2 years to learn his potential.
---
Or then just buy a mic ffs.
---
He deserved to die with that headgear !!
---
You are a *transgenda*
---
Dmrs should only have acog not lmgs and then I agree
---
Yo brew still havent heard anything from ubi.
---
I mean, fair, there have been times where I’ve flanked and pick people off as Smoke, but he’s much better actor in my experience.
---
FK2 &amp; Gpro Wireless are the best mice out right now. idk what you have but whatever you do, dont buy a g502. mechanical keyboard obviously. search up the best graphics settings, some settings eat up fps a lot and arent needed. turn on raw input.
---
I stick smash with unranked rarely play ranked. With a team mate well be ight.
---
Il be on in a few hours!
---
then whats the point of a ban phase if you cant ban  for example: a jackal on bank or a capitao/maverick on clubhouse  or ban the mira that is very annoying or the echo which is hard to deal with
---
I need a link to that figurine for very important reasons. Anyone got a link to where i can buy it?
---
I thought the time pauses when the defuse starts

*riiip*

How do I know that's an Alibi and not an Alibi Alibi?

You didn’t have to do him like that

MP7 or mp5ssd

Zofia for attack, Lesion for defense.

I like that. A similar design philosophy as Mozzie (using attacker devices against them). Might come with a ton of bug issues though.
---
Damn that's cool
---
Buck
---
Blackbeard got a nerf for his shield
---
So I personally like buck but it’s your call
---
Oh but I did
---
I like it but i miss echo before the ban i had like 50 hours on him
---
what else did you expect to happen when you had no operators unlocked. we all knew this already
---
Bandit is that you?
---
I meant cav
---
No SAS operators need a buff, they're perfect right now
---
Idk if this is a joke or not but he left the game before the knifing motion lol
---
Yes but I’m saying that I will have to cancel many times even at 2 minutes. I actually haven’t gotten a game pre-2 minutes in days. 
---
Often it’ll take 4+ 2/3 minute queues before getting a single game.
---
I know. They should take this opportunity because it really fits. Especially because of his name Jackal, and then just add lantern and you got the perfect combination
---
How you like to play on attack?

Buck if you prefer full auto or like being able to create peepholes. Blackbeard is for peaking doorways and just generally long range combat, and you have to use his DMR cuz his AR sucks
---
that's not possible
---
Together as one
---
I think jackal should be quarantined in comp
---
*voice chat*
---
That’s clip is one of the example XD
---
Plot twist bandit is a double agent!
---
I have like 5 smurfs fight me
---
why is it suspended?
---
Kind of I started to feel unranked is easier than casual most of the time
---
how is this a weird flex lol
---

---
dude I swear ur a dumbass. “oh i got kicked for doing **ABSOLUTELY NOTHING** to support my team” damn, better rant about it being the games fault and not mine for not being there
---
He got mad that kaid can do more with his and joined attacking team
---
You lagged at a bad time
---
kaid, his smg got buffed so he's more versatile. Plus hatches
---
I know the pre-Blood Orchid headgears where still AP drops but now the uniforms are news to me, hopefully I can get some White Noise ones on my alt.
---
Fax. I'm already back on BO2 because they don't care.
---
There would be massive backlash against Ubi if they removed the european event packs but not the american ones.
---
“Stunning”
---
Finka does not need a buff lmao
---
Hasn't taken me more than 6 these last few months
---
I’m not saying she needs a buff, I’m just saying it doesn’t make sense logically
---
No sorry, PC only.
---
How did you get R6S to run on a switch? /s
---
That's different
---
Dude Playing as Blitz made the same face, probably...
---
Ah, no worries.
---
i’m sure he wasn’t flexing
---
it’s literally a menu if you’re not getting good fps you genuinely just have a below average pc
---
I get a stable 300 fps on it and I don’t have a good pc
---
My friend does the same thing (Not a Maverick main though)
---
Whats up with the siege community being so bitchy about everything?
---
It's okay except for when goyo puts a shield next to wall and you reinforce it and kill two people and get booted.
---
Props for trying something bold!
---
What's your though on buffing her now that pros are actually using her?
---
While she's mostly picked only to counter specific settings such as Bank garage, I don't really see her being used outside of that role. 
---
However, if Ubi feels that her being picked to counter those situation is enough, I fear that Nokk won't receive any changes other than maybe slightly longer gadget duration like last time.
---
That's not even my biggest criticism. I'm trying to be nice
---
Deep pockets.
---
*spider man pointing at spider man meme*
---
Just kill them before they ddos you
---
The face looks more like a “:D” than a Pepe to me.
---
No, get lord tachunky
---
How is that providing utility. The BP camera is the utility and the ACOG gives him a free kill. No utility on the ACOG there buddy. Any more examples??
---
Wait is the one in the left in-game? And how can you get it??
---
Wow you didn’t find extremely sweaty and toxic players on siege? How?!
---
bruh no.
---
 I already have him and he's my main
---
I think the small changes are more realistic at the moment as pros are starting to pick her and even banned her.
---
If Ubi decides that Nokk countering specific map set up is enough, Nokk likely won't receive any impactful buffs such as receiving a different gun. Maybe just longer gadget duration at this point. 
---
Though I guess time will tell since Nokk is just starting to get picked.
---
Not a suspicious question at all.
---
It might come close but there was a kickstarter for an analog keyboard with pressure sensitive keys.
---
#WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I’ve got a challenge, post this into the pro league subreddit and see what everyone else’s opinions are. And btw the utility provided by the acog isn’t a free kill, you actually have to have good aim to get the kill
---
Can't be, he's not cheating to win.
---
Lucky and also because Finka Maverick and IQ were already my friend
---
i know this is kinda late but they changed the abandon sanction rule this season.
---
1st time: 30 min
---
2nd time: 1 hour
---
3rd time: 2 hours
---
4th time: 24 hour
---
didnt manage yet to get more than that :D
---
If anything this isn’t toxic. I’ve had ppl t bag me as the last person alive but downed. And it pisses me off like END ME ALREADY. But that was pretty funny lmao.
---
If you like to roam around Clash isnt a bad pick especially if you have someone following you or nearby to flank. A good portion of ppl try to have someone shoot behind her shield but if a teammate rotates and flanks from another spot its deadly. Plus you get to have fun by switching to the secondary and 180 people. 
---
In ranked she tends to be banned quite often but she's becoming one of my favorite ops to play solo or in a group.
---
Not a console player/fan but damn that looks neat :D
---
Insert Spongebob reference about the lid
---
Nice
---
Sick ace bro, looks like plat for sure
---
No no, you’re saying I’m an idiot but also saying ACOG provides utility by itself. You need to back up you’re point if you’re making such a fuss about it. I’m waiting. 
---
P.S. why don’t you post it in the Subreddit if you’re so flustered over it.
---
Ok retard
---
I'm 3 games from a solo plat run. Honestly to me that is the biggest achievement I could get in this game, I've been close a few times.
---
My worst nightmare
---
Or you know,  get a mic
---
Parents: YOU BETTER CLEAN THE HOUSE BEFORE WE COME HOME!
---
The house:
---
Same man, here’s to hoping my PC and console brethren alike can play the same shit at the same time regardless.
---
Commando - Angel Grip with Comp
---
Rhino- Vertical/Angel with Long barrel
---
Shot gun for ez rotation holes or opening hatches
---
My opinions tho :/
---
you forgot to tea bag at the end
