ubisoft gave me ports for my firewall to allow, I've tried that nothing changes. I've tried disabling my firewall (both from my router and windows firewall) and nothing changes
---
Ya see dumbass me over here has been playing since velvet shell and both books are the same size. But not the big one.
---
Zofia main here, personally I run the AR with Acog/Flash/Vertical and play her as an entry fragger. Once you're droned in and have information use her impacts to blow up utility. Wire/Kapkans/Grzmots/WelcomeMats/ect. or go through walls/hatches. Than stun and go for the kill.
---

---
Another great way is on a vertical heavy map like border take breaching charges and get map control above the objective before making anchors lives a living hell.
---
In a pinch use the stuns as a drone, since they're proximity detonated you can check if someone is in the room.
---
If you do play her as an entry fragger remember not to get too aggressive, play smart aggression not dumb rushing, use the utility to put pressure and concuss before the push.
---
If you can't control recoil well start with 
---
Holo, Reflex/Muzzle, Comp/Angled to learn the basics.
---
How do you play Shot Gun Roulette
---
There are so many counters to any shield. If anyone says otherwise they clearly have never play a shield. I‚Äôve been maining shields for a while and after getting kill in almost every way imaginable you learn how to easily deal with them when the situation is reversed.
---
Idk what jackal does I bought him at the beginning of the season and he‚Äôs been always banned guess it‚Äôs time to play casual
---
True
---
He revives them to 75 with his pistol that‚Äôs good enough
---
I‚Äôm fine with recoil control. When I do play vertical a roamer gets me though.
---
Oh I never knew that tbh. That‚Äôs crazy and in fairness one person said they tk me cause I‚Äôm trash but I shouldn‚Äôt generalise that to others. Thanks for letting me know
---
Wie spielt man shotgun Roulette?
---
Yes/No, if they are like teleporting they you might with a support ticket. if they are using walls and stuff you probs won't be able.
---
even then seems they only really manually ban if you are a huge streamer!
---
Looks like wrench from watch dogs 2
---
Yeah I guess that works to XD
---
If she peaked the corner as you was jumping out it would cause this affect. A major r6 YouTuber ( honestly watch to many to remember which one. ) covered this on their channel. I do agree with you that it is frustrating though.
---
Also I‚Äôd say blue bar takes a much more coordinated team usually
---
You're discusting.
---
Right but they can just hit the server so the game doesnt count anyway. If they made it so the game just disconnected and didnt count if, in consecutive rounds, the pings all get absurd the cheaters wouldnt get elo
---
One question, would you say shields are balanced?
---
I‚Äôve been laughing at ‚Äúsmonk‚Äù for a while now.
---
Well I‚Äôm on console and this kid on my team was teaming with opponents.
---
He also said we have 3 weeks of test server again even tho I‚Äôm pretty sure it was ONLY for phantom sight
---
I couldn't agree more. We must have learned to play the same way.
---
I really wish it wasn‚Äôt the case, too, because I believe anyone should be able to enjoy a game to it‚Äôs fullest no matter the platform, but it is. If someone starts getting toxic on pc (in my experience, at least) the entire team just pulls out a ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that here‚Äù on em. The target audience of consoles is much more casual, though, so they‚Äôre less likely to actually give a crap about etiquette.
---
thank you for not calling me disgusting but instead discusting
---
Oh FUCK ME
---
Forcefully pronouncing AUG as a word instead of an abbreviation gives me Schwarzenegger vibes. "Get the AUEEHG!!!"
---
Have you tried the pistol that Hibana/Echo uses? That thing is insane.
---
Not really anymore I‚Äôm 267 and most high level players are 300+
---
depends on how long you've been playing &amp; how much you play everyday
---
Nice ace!
---
What about the shield is a castle, and when you extend the shield the little drawbridge in the centre rises.
---
¬†"Hamas-run al-Aqsa TV station showed chaotic footage from the scene" 
---
Other then the fact that says a lot,
---
Do you really wanna compare "atrocities"? 
---
We shoot at "hospitals" because its known hamas uses parts of the hospitals to hide weaponary, whats hamas's reason to LITERALLY shoot rockets at homes, hospitals, schools ETC other then thier intent to kill whoever? To drag us to shoot at thier weapon stashes and rocket launchers possibly hurting civilians although the idf is known to do its best to alert citizens before a strike unlike ANY other army in the world
---
Im talking about flyers from a plane, radio transmissions, phone calls. what does hamas do before it sends missiles to areas with innocent population? nothing.
---
How many did they kill with all thier terror attacks against civilians and casualtiea from the rockets? Uh?
---
I can‚Äôt answer that question until they fix shields. There are so many problem with them that the gameplay you see with shields is not what is intended.
---
That's a whole different thing, that categorizes under game throwing not toxic/cheating, siege doesnt necessarily have a policy against that....
---
Ass aim for me. Transferred from Xbox to PC last year. Sometimes I‚Äôm good. Most times, not so much.

I like this game. The R6 version of find the vegan!

Maybe similar to Doc?

Focus on healing and some sort of supporting rather than firepower in general?
---
Shes not bad for shallow roaming but for a more balanced operator I would suggest vigil, cav if your wanting to get really aggressive.
---
Nice
---
The game I just played had 2 or 3 diamond players and the rest were gold

Oh yeah, I would have never had that op or loadout, or even ran out if it was ranked. But casual at 1:30 am is a very different story

Lmao this is number one bullshit
---
Knowledge is skill tbh
---
That's one of the biggest shame of all. Her look and concept really stands out but she's an useless pick regardless of ranks. 
---
In the end, she offers nothing. I just really want her to be better overall and I'm hoping that Ubi will adjust her (and warden) by next season.
---
Add "Gauntlet" to the word and you will be ready to finger snap the enemies out of existance

Well he won't have any luck with that. The only reason I shot there is because my friend called out he was behind the table down stairs üôÉ

It was someone on your team, doesn't have to be your friend

A sweaty kill I can appreciate good sir!
---
Your ELO will be turned back if you lost against cheaters
---
...When I bought it (which, to be fair, was a while ago. Maybe 3 months by now, maybe even longer), I had every Operator before Buck / Frost, so idk if they changed it, but not even the starter edition has only recruit. So, I have no clue what's going on there, but something's not what it should be like...

How would she be able to wield it inside a building in close combat?

I love the idea though lol. Imagine you turn around and there's Nokk just standing there with Barrett pointing at your chest. 3 Armor? Still a one shot kill.

Good spot

Sorry not a cosplay alit is a render

Get one ?

"Argue all you want, i wont see till after shabat is over"

If you had actually kept shabat and wasnt pulling a lame joke you wouldnt be answering since its foribidden to use phones in shabat, not open links. Go go, get to your temple, but remamber that theres no genocide takin place but only in your fantasy
---
Saying Israeli preforms a genocide is not just ignorant, but you're also blaming the United Stats, Germany, France, UK, Russia and ETC all of which have access to MUCH more information then you do, to ignoring israels genocide and even cooperate with Israel and and not condem it nor adress the genocide in any way. Does Israel control all those goverments? Or maybe theres more to the story and more to both sides then you are able to comprehend. Good night.
---
Why?
---
To be honest, i always thought Dokkaebi had the best kicks.
---
Players get a small allotment of ammo (10-15 shots) , All shots cause nomad airjab style knockback, Rook armor should be a counter for instakills at most ranges (say 10 meters or closer and your a dead man) and also make player breathing as a  substantial factor in sighted shots, oh and I def want it so that its more utility focus like bucks shotgun so maybe one shots barracades and makes quick work of castles, maestros, etc

What Mozzie does when he is bored

That's what I was gonna do. I was getting the hard part out of the way.

Too bad the new assassin's creed games are just awful
---
I would pay for this and I hate montagne
---
I've had plenty of teams that give useful info and good callouts and have actually saved me when I'm last alive but then you get these idiots that just screech constantly after they die. Then because you cant hear and die they votekick you and tell you you suck. Like, bitch who died first?
---
Hate fighting or fighting as?
---
look at Mr academia here
---
Both
---
If you don‚Äôt remember I would check that ur using the MB. The recoil is very controllable after the first shot so a MB is a lot more affective than a comp.
---
Understandable.

\^\^ and that's it. The green dot don't mean shit

I don‚Äôt eat there often but when I do I get that deal. Honestly unbeatable.

I might color this with copics later too

Get good bud
---
Also get help your reading comprehension if you think swearing automatically makes some one angry

I would recommend working your leaning/head movement into your aiming skills, along with practicing in terrorist hunt. Finding the right sensitivity and possibly investing in stick extenders can help too

Dope!

Thanks!
---
Thank you!
---
I‚Äôm not too sure how long it took me, I think i adjusted fast because I gradually worked my sensitivity up until I was sure that 100,60, 75 was the best sensitivity for me. I‚Äôm gonna guess you play a low sensitivity so it‚Äôs going to take time for you to get used to mine if you‚Äôre gonna try it. It just takes commitment to stay on the sensitivity, it may feel way too fast for you cause my friends used to call me a psycho for having a 100 sensitivity. Just go on terrorist hunt and play and play and play and play until you get it right. It‚Äôs all commitment when you change sensitivity. Maybe slowly raise your sense every few games to get used to the speed because switching to mine is gonna be like hell to control.

Having sweaty recruit rushing twitch streamers in casual is the new meta guys
---
Why does the right have a small penis
---
outplayed
---
You guessed correctly
---
You are so triggered rn lmao
---
Big book: EGs win potential. Small book: Season point clutch potential.
---
set the sound settings from hi-fi or whatever its set to to night mode and set the FOV to 90.
---
It isn't as bad as what people make it out to be at all, it was changed due to imbalance, and to be real it needed a rework.
---
But I still like the old Hereford more, so many good memories.
---
Why would the one on the right not have a small dick?
---
Personally the fm9 is way too weak for a attacker I think if she had the mp5sd from echo or the mx4 storm from alibi she'd be pretty beefy also if she could (while using her ability) not be affected by GU's and was able to sprint with her ability that would make her a viable pick.
---
Anyone you want? No, it's an RPG, of course you can't go around one-shotting level 50 goons when you're barely out of Megaris.  
---
If you have a half-decent build, you can one-shot assassinate anything on your level that isn't a super-elite opponent.
---
I think he had a better gaming chair then I did
---
No :0

This man did a line of cocaine before this round
---
But why did you draw it what was the reason for have the small genitalia there in the first place
---
I'm really not, I'm currentlt watching TV, petting my cat, and talking to friends about a movie, but yes I'm triggered because you don't have more then two brain cells in your entire family tree because I should be the one mad because you don't understand things logically of course
---
OOf nearly an ace
---
Mostly just a joke, it's why his feet and eyes are all goofy looking too
---
I got the same thing, but with Smoke.
---
was also probably well hydrated
---
They dont let you change FOV on console anymore
---
Alright, Does that make the sound alot more detectable?
---
That has happed to me before it sucked
---
Test out a few sensitivities. Take into account how comfortably you can flick with that sens and how comfortably you can control recoil. Also it‚Äôs good to be aggressive when playing. Make sure your FOV is at 90 but if it looks really weird, then slowly put it up like 5 FOV at a time every day. Also try using a 16:10 aspect ratio. It‚Äôs a mini stretched res that helps mostly when using a holographic sight or anything but an acog. Doesn‚Äôt help much with an acog but overall it will help you hit shots.
---
Ok because my friend was saying the LMG was good

First of all I never said it was new second of all the map is the newest one there is you vigiapant stupid fuck

Suppressed MAC-11. Interesting choice, and nice 4k. Shame it's got so much recoil.
---
Would love to see what the killcam looked like, lol.
---
You can clearly see, it is not.
---
Well, there's only one thing to do. RECRUIT SHOTGUN RUSH RAMPAGE!
---
Yup, you gotta ads and aim reaaaaally carefully
---
Unless the French one where you can hipfire in the vague direction of the enemy and get a down from across the room
---
If the flash is right next to you of course it‚Äôs still gonna flash you, I think it‚Äôs like 3m or less
---
From last time I posted this, it does this no matter what within his effective range, which is 4 meters.
---
You can't. That's hell hole. I went down to copper one season and wasn't able to get out without restarting next season.
---
No real friends? Make some. Go to the r6 teams sub or discord or even here, make a post, get some buddies, profit.
---
 Goblin new main material not gonna lie
---
I'm not saying he's a bad roamer, I'm saying he is a much better anchor.
---
Even with a stronger gun, she'd still be behind someone like Ash who can rotate around faster while also having some utility.
---
One of Nokk's problem is that her stealth is actually pretty weak. All the cams within the area are destroyed pretty early on in the round by other Attackers rotating around. That leaves Nokk basically her quiet foot step only, which is slightly better than 3 Speed ops crouch walking but with limited time usage. However, those 3 Speeds all offer utilities of some sort that benefits the entire team. 
---
Basically, even if Nokk gets Ash's R4-C, she'd still be a questionable pick when 3 Speed Attackers can provide utilities. She'd be a slow Ash with no Breaching Rounds. 
---
The strong gun would definitely make Nokk much better since anything would be welcoming at this point. However, I think her stealth mechanic needs to be much more buffed first to emphasize her identity as an unique stealthy Attacker. 
---
Maybe if she can run while using her gadget, it would justify her being 2 Speed, below the average gun, and having no utility.
---
I personally adore Echo
---
Wow that's cool
---
The feels!

A pose that definitely says "Hey girl, can I get yo numba?"

Sorry, I'm dumb

Everything else is great. But that face though

This is so retarded.

For a first time painted gun im extremely impressed by it, the pattern, the colour blend, etc, even I dont know what any of that words mean!

whats your rank?

Where are your fingers?

this is wrong in so many ways, but I respect your opinion

On jah.

This is wrong on so many levels and I don‚Äôt respect your opinion

i really wanted the thermite cat, and then I got the actual charm

TBH it probably would be his elite

"My Man" *snaps in and out of a tree trunk*
---
Montagne had enough traumas
---
i've literally never lagged out and my ms is almost constantly around 8. not 80, 8. 
---
it said i was kicked.
---
It was ranked. 
---
Kicked me out of game directly to the abandonment punishment notice and began 15 min no play time.
---
It really makes sense that as soon as the punishment is issued (15 min no play) then regardless of if the person is in game or not they are unable to play for 15 min, meaning if they're in game they're kicked. It's almost definitely whats happened/ing to others.
---
Same lmao just started playing alot myself but I've watched VarsityGaming so much I know the strats lol
---
Extremely well done, even the shadows in your face are correct and a little Easter egg as well. I'm impressed
---
So close to an ace. That‚Äôs tough
---
Seeing 60 fps on menu has been standard for at least 2 years
---
Good shoot her lmao
---
also vigil i dont think you caught that it's assumed that this is a faulty automated punishment delivery system not some ubi intern reading my file and pressing a big red button
---
CoreRoss made a Video about how the Ash has a disadvantage. It's the other way around.
---
Those who stand directly next to the corner has a disadvantage, that would be Ash.
---
That Video isn't applicable for this case.

It was on PC

Hello kevlar_usmc, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cohbo8/what_warden_needs_to_be_a_usable_operator/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Missed a window while safe twice, destroyed teammates breach charge,kept sprinting while stunned by Yokai, playing the worst players in the world and bragging to others about it and trying to look down on others by using the word ‚Äúbud‚Äù 
---
He pointed out the small details I can point out the bigger ones if you like
---
Solo can be difficult, you should try finding some friends solo isn't for everyone, but if not just play like three or so hours a day at least just in ranked, warm up with some TH and you should hopefully see some improvement
---
My friends and I talk about this all the time. When you‚Äôre playing well and winning, there is no game more fun and satisfying than R6 Siege. On this flip side, when you‚Äôre losing and getting wrecked, there‚Äôs no game more frustrating. 
---
It‚Äôs the bad moments that make the good moments so good, my friend.
---
Plenty of times. Doesn't change the fact that it is an old and outdone joke, that isn't particularly funny anymore. And hasn't been for years.
---
I play 13+ hours a day i have a sad life....
---
for his eggs obviously
---
Me too. I love the game but hate the playerbase. So toxic.
---
Mabey restarting your game works?
---

---
Bronze and high copper is mostly people who actually belong there but once you get into the low copper range is 75% smurfs and very few actually Copper 4s. I recommend trying your hardest this season to be honest with you it's unlikely you can get back to Silver I. Next season try to maybe find some people on Discord or something. There's a channel called Looking For Group Xbox and a few subchannels based on region so you might be able to find someone there.
---
Damn dude lmao, no hate from me, hopefully you get lucky with some good teammates when the new season comes out.
---
you thought
---
I came from the game where people were staying afk and the others doing whole job and everybody got the same rewards. It's an eye bleeding seeing this here. Not to mention 1 min mission grants more renown than 15-25 min match.
---
Just invite your team into a party
---
Well the thing is its not about rank im just garbage im absolutely horrible at this game
---
Suggestion: Get a 4 or 5 stack
---
Do you know when the nee season comes out?
---
out of the spetznaz ops kapkan was the only one even remotely close
---
He‚Äôs probably foreign. Can you speak another language fluently?
---
I believe the prediction is the 21st of next month, my guess is the 14th
---
Nice clutch but why reflex when you have acog
---
I understand i was wrong hes french i messgaed him with an apology
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Alexa, play "Special delivery" by G-Dep ft. Ghostface Killa
---
That fixed it thanks ^^ wanna add the kitty to the sosig on Finka rushing with her is so damn fun
---
dude i experience the exact opposite every game since phantom sight came out. last match i shot a maestro like 6x with glaz while he was standing still and looking in cameras and not a bullet hit him. this is ridiculous, it feels like operation health is coming back.
---
He kinda looks like a combination of Hulk Hogan and M. Shadows
---
Lion is GIGN?

Ah haha, no problem man!

Honestly I think the second glacier was the invitational skin
---
i got ddossed in new comers ....
---
But look at it.... look at the advert for it, then look back at the actual charm, then look at the adorable operator themed pics, then look at the middle school woodshop cutout of a cat. Tell me it's not low effort. I'm all for new stuff, but good new stuff.

Hey, that's me in the clip
---
HEY, YOU WATCHA GONNA DO?
---
I completely disagree. I love the cat. I think it‚Äôs an awesome idea to have such a down to earth charm like that. Not bullets or ducky‚Äôs or sushi, just a nice little hand made wooden cat. 
---
Sounds like you just can‚Äôt enjoy the simpler things.
---
I feel like I need to shoot the cams everywhere in and out of the game
---
Make that a shirt please.
---
It‚Äôs for mobile too
---
I stopped playing because of this and you should too. I dont plan on getting the game back on PC either, it sucks too much imo and the community is full of sweaty kids who would probably be the weird kid in school
---
It is server sided. The problem is a client-server desync either on the end of the shield guy or on the end of everyone who sees the shield there.
---
Doc mains rise up

Mamma mia, ma che fai? **Italian gestures**

Oh I didn't know that. Thanks

Now we just need to go to Italy to take maestro, and we can do a clip of him saying this.
---
I mean yeah, we knew where he was for the last year I think it was. But ended up having to sneak in with stealth helicopters to take him out without alerting the Paki government....which as you probably know didnt end as well as it should have. lol
---
But yeah, I dont have anything against the Pakistan people. Not their fault their government is a bunch of evil hoeasses. I just dont feel the black storks belong in R6 yet. Call it too soon? I dunno.

cue

With that much time, go back. Unless you‚Äôre able to play all day everyday, the muscle memory won‚Äôt build enough to be worth it

Changing your settings especially one that effects your aim will change your performance.
---
Think about it like this, if you doubled your DPI, would you adjust to only having to move your mouse half-way as far? How long would it take?
---
No one cares
---
Hard to "git gud" when your shot in the head immediately after spawning time and time again
---
I played with mouse acceleration unknowingly for almost 2000 hours.  In total honesty i didnt notice a difference when i turned it off.  However, also in all honesty, i do not make super fast, flicky movements and hold angles more than not
---
- Matchmaking for casual sucks, but they are working on the ranked one to not let diamond matchmake with some of the lowest rank.
---
I alway thought of Wario.... maybe both these guys ARE Wario in different careers. Hmmmm
---
I actually just ordered stickers of this lmao
---
Also gsh sucks
---
My lord. Just restart it. It‚Äôs not worth waiting that long
---
I've gotten killed around corners so many times this season.  Just the other night, I was Kapkan on Theme Park, though, and I literally shotgunned a guy around the corner.  He was in Cafe, and I was in the hallway by Cafe stairs, I popped around the doorframe, fired three shots at him, and as I fired the third I was ducking back around the corner, the third hit nothing that I could see except the doorframe and the wall, and I got the kill.  It was a definite "Wait, what????" moment.
---
I wouldn't mind the bad moments, if they were my fault.  But when I'm doing everything right, and get screwed over by the game, that's when I get frustrated.
---
Love the gameplay, hate how toxic it is
---
Which part is on top when the shield is retracted?
---
Give me my ela pussy
---
It‚Äôs not like the fix was announced to be coming next season.
---
More like 33%
---
Your right, I come back an hour later and it has 1000 upvotes
---
The power of Christ compels you
---
That would actually be a decent operator to have he has a weakness but has a good strength he is high risk high reward kind of ability
---
I don't mean to sound bitchy but I put a lot of thought in this post in intentions of HELPING players, and you just put an unnecessary tldr, did you not think how it's gonna make me feel pretty dumb
---
Personally I run suppressor on it as if you get on a wall it takes that little longer to realise where you are
---
I thought the fist slid down and then shows the finger. I clearly don‚Äôt know how Montanges Shield extends
---
He isn‚Äôt wrong... Also, nobody above the age of twelve would buy it.
---
*angry Italian noises *
---
Definitely. 
---
You play with a 3 stack and then they TK you and then VtK you because their scared you‚Äôll TK them back. 
---
Of course it‚Äôs a lot more toxic and BS if you‚Äôre playing 2 man coop with said 3 stack as you‚Äôre friend won‚Äôt let them kick you.
---
This picture is nearly as old as the game.
---
And apparently the US Navy?
---
I was merely saying that he did not need to call me bad for that, I know I am bad at the game and I don't need people telling me so online. I missed the window because there was a Cav roaming so I did not want to be vulnerable just in case she was there. I ran past the Yokai because I did not care about it since I knew Echo was no where near me. I destroyed my teammates Breaching Charge because I was trying to help speed up the process. I was not looking down on others or bragging by using the word "bud", it's just a word I like to use. Point out bigger details if you want, I don't care bud.

*Banned for toxic behaviour*
---
Did you kill lesion? 
---
Yes. 
---
What did it cost?
---
Operation health was the final blow for me and since then I don't remember the game as kinda bad. Also because they scrapped the polish season for this (fuck my nation I guess) 
---
The game had some terrible lows from the beggining like during Black Ice, but I somewhat excused it since the game was in a poor state before and not out for that long. Then operation Dust Line came and except for op Black Beard it felt pretty polished, well until the last season of year 1 then it went down hill again. 
---
Stopped playing the game intirely after operation outbreak. Most of the problems you mention didn't effect me, but I live in Germany so maybe it has to do with the servers.
---
Tho for some months during operation Skull Rain I was unable to play the game, because the servers kicked me out multible times during a match. And it was not due to my Internet connection. I might not have had the most cosistent connection but it rarely crashed intirerly. Maybe the server couldn't handle my inconsistent ping.
---
Rank was never fun for me, In casual I can lose as many games that I lose without worrying about my rank and stuff.
---
My teammates
---
Yeh, Baba Yaga rush
---
If you throw it a little to the right or not far enough you miss the corner and are in the next room... then you dont get the kill. So ya, I heard him above, then knew where the corner was and threw it where I knew he had to run..
---
Most of the tile rook is the first one too rush outside the obj

Is that Jameskii?

Idc it needs to be in the game

Cool
---
have you checked you rank via r6tab.com or some stat site like this? it can be fault of your client, if this site doesn't show your rank it is server side and you should contact Ubisoft, although i don't think they will do anything about it
---
That poor silver

Check if you're on EU servers

You can be ranked differently the same as normal except on another server

you know you can change leaning to hold on PC?

You may be bad with a kbm but that is probably due to a lack of practice and not the limitations of the hardware. A player with the same number of hours on kbm will be better most of the time than a player of the same level on console.

I just wish this game was playable for me. I absolutely hate exploiters and people of this game. And sometimes hate Ubi for not doing shit about it.
---
Just like that? Might as well get a pc at that point
---
Oh sorry im blind,just take it slowly and rotate,that mostly means they just aim for spawnpeaks and a trade kill,depending on the map a rotation with a team of shields helps,bait them with a monty and get them into a killbox.
---
If noting else works take all recruit with german shottys and meme the hell out of them.

Fair advice tbh, I just keep having bad luck of I'm in animation for charge placement or I'm checking corners before I push in and POP they're out and behind me and I just feel dumb

Because the amount of MMR you receive or lose reduces with the number of games you play.

If that skin was in the game I would play Monty more
---
4.8k now
---
why?
---
Great, I have hundreds of hours too and I have encountered a lot of these problems.
---
Ubi has ban whaves every week,i still fell like they ban more people for saying ez than hackers tho.
---
And id say most people are just good and its ping issues,i have been in a game with my teammate hipfiring 3 people across the map,just report them and send the vid to ubi
---
I do not know but this makes me want to get zofia

The thing is , I took a break from r6 and now im even more trash than before, so im prolly going to die anyway.

Charges are extremly loud now,cant say the omount of times i have died becouse someone got lucky and shot me in the head while i was breaching,if you have zofia use her for a quick rotation breach and run to the other side it always confuses them,its also always good to break a window in obj and have a bb watch it while the team pushes in.

I'm so sorry my personal choice of operator is offensive to you, I'll try better to devote my life to making you happy in the future!

Play, play, and then play some more. The most important thing you can do is play a shit ton to get a feel for the movement and to learn the maps (because you need to know everything about each one)

Buy the pass, I bought all of them separately and spent at least $120 the pass is only like $50 and you get all, saves you money
---
About time........
---
Congratulations 
---
You‚Äôre no longer a noob.
---
If your gonna repost, credit OP at the very least, SMH......

Sounds like you need to find some new friends for serious ranked games. I have two sets of friends on my list, ones I play to have fun and kind of fuck around, and the others where I am dead serious. Next season you should solo que and find some good players before playing with your friends and tanking your elo.
---
haha le russian man blow up hostage lol xDDD
---
I would buy this years pass and save up renown for the rest of the operators as they will be cheaper depending on when they were released. You can easily grind out renown if you play often.
---
Welcome to the triple digits club.

# Buying the pass

That's nomad's boyfriend. They met at a support group for people with missing fingers.
---
He was an amateur boxer, hence the outfit and also grew up in London and was not an academic kid so I guess he was a kind of street kid kind. I think its unique.
---
As far as I'm concerned they are just a bunch of people doing some oper8r shit on the weekends
---
That's really cool, have fun!
---
I've done all the situations and I play terrorist hunt to warm up then go to multiplayer. The movement and the fact you can make holes and shoot through them gets me sometimes. Also the different skills

Hello akaSyr, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/com2zm/i_just_switched_from_ps4_to_pc_can_you_give_me/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Because he and finka are in the CBRN
---
I used to have the same feelings. 
---
It‚Äôs the exact same feelings when leaving the house or meeting strangers online or in game. 
---
Personally for me, it helped to get out of the house regularly and to have certain times to play. Kinda like a schedule. Walks, runs and workouts in the morning before breakfast and Siege after dinner for an hour or two. 
---
It helped me with in game anxiety and my anxiety in the real world.
---
so finka is going to be german?
---
You know what? It's not that bad. The only things that bothers me are the mission camo on buck, the fact that he is wearing a short armed t shirt and the gas mask. But the colours are chosen good. It just looks like an really low budget creation since it is not detailed.
---
It‚Äôs siege deal with it. I‚Äôm stuck on silver too and I can‚Äôt do anything
---
His run is ine of the reasons I don't pick him. 
---
Looks like a dad bbquing running from angry bees
---
Woah, just because he is useless doesn't mean you gotta insult the stache
---
See enemies more clearly? If I change the clour of the sight from red to yellow or blue? What do you mean?
---
I was hoping for the 5 cats
---
I think that's most of the people that play siege. one minute I'll be getting nonstop pistol onetaps and then next being constantly spawnpeeked. I dont think it's possible to like siege without also hating it.
---
It's Ubisoft dude.  It takes months if not years to fix stuff.
---
There's plenty of time. Like that other guy said, play some custom matches, get better at it
---
The dev team has been lying about fixes since the game came out, nothing new, they just lie and lie and lie and lie some more  
---
The siege dev team lies about the server issues, the cheating, the hitregistration, the sound issues, even the fucking tick rate, get used to it lmao and dont buy ubisoft multiplayer games
---
I think that's kind of the point.
---
Stealing content is stupid, but most of them are bitching about having to scroll past the same thing more than once
---
I did that and nothing happened
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just annoying af
---
Might be an old clip
---
Srry my bad that was too far
---
It‚Äôs the most fair system there is. If you lost against a hacker, you get points back. If you played with and won against a hacker you lose points. The whole idea is to erase any impact the hacker would‚Äôve had on the match, regardless of the outcome.
---
Well they changed nook and she‚Äôs at least better than warden
---
How much
---
Name your price
---
Is super distracting too and makes him feel slower than he really is. 
---
Too bad because his weapons, despite not being original, are pretty decent.
---
Yes
---
3 take it or leave it
---
Would invest all stonks
---
Hit Detection is probably the one thing the Ubisoft does right, some of, if not the best detection in the FPS Market.
---
Was that a typo, or a clever way of saying he needs to get laid?
---
Getting one kill with each hand at the same time. Beautiful
---
What?
---
First time? Looks totally professional. :O

What do you mean bring it back ?
---
Gets a free charm, complains
---
what are you talking about?
---
Finka isn‚Äôt Russian though
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mind the map personally but it‚Äôs definitely not meant for ranked
---
Ranked as basically every map I feel is defender biased at this point
---
No we don't.
---
Fuck no
---
so you are saying that in all my games this season I have only had hackers on my team and never the enemy team cause all I have done is lost points that seems a little skewed
---
Yeah but what do you mean ? Is it gone ? (Haven‚Äôt played in a while) if yes that‚Äôs amazing cause I mean everyone wanted it to get removed
---
Oh my
---
Will do!
---
If you have defuser then don't hunt down enemies, worry about planting
---
If you are Thatcher spawn with the thermite/Hibana
---
If you are Ela keep a grizmot in case you run into a monte
---
Melee a shield to knock it away and stun the enemy
---
These are all I can think of right now, hope it helps
---
Don‚Äôt need to comment if your gonna contribute nothing to the thread
---
Looks nice !
---
he is looking at the operator show, he cant se year 3, and the year 1 i guess he dont start with ?
---
I‚Äôm not saying ranked is super competitive that‚Äôs what pro league is. Ranked is a way to play in a more competitive environment because now you have a rank on the line if you lose along with pick and bans to make games more interesting. Not really sure what you mean by picking the obj because you still pick bomb sites that‚Äôs always been a part of ranked.
---
Had that happen once I got on the turret and just died lol
---
Why do lion and doc hate each other
---
year 1 i mean "core" or what the correct name is ?
---
If you havent train your aim to head level, whether its crouching level pr standing if you know theyre around a corner also listen if theyre prone bc they make hella noise
---
It's fine, thanks anyway!
---
The operator what now?
---
But aren't you on his team??
---
im talking about casual with picking obj since im now forced to play casual if i wanna play secure or hostage
---
Is it not my opinion that the community is full of sweaty kids? So I am being attacked over my opinion. Also there's a difference between good and sweaty. I have no problem with when I'm beaten by a good player but sweaty players are just irritating to go against and unrewarding to beat. They make the game tiring and unfun because they have to try so hard and sweat so much.
---
And mouse and keyboard üòâ
---
Classy joke bud.
---
N√∏kk thermite mute smoke Thatcher and more are all 2speed 2armour
---
Every time i play tatcher with the L85   i try To smash a wall or √† window &gt;&gt;
---
Have you bought them with VPN?
---
Lol
---
Nope, just pick my fights better than most people who complain about her
---
yes
---
isnt ranked still in beta after 4 years?
---
It's always better to have an extra backup holster and not need it than need a fifth holster and not have it.
---
Wait waht
---
"dOwNvOtE bUtToN iS nOt 'i Do NoT aGrEe BuTtOn' " yeah people definitely downvoted me because they agreed with what I said. If you downvote someone in this context, its because you dont like what they said/ disagreed with it
---
Just tell him not to do that
---
Personally, I find Lion more useful and he has a great weapon. Depends on what you're looking to do and who you have in lineup. Ying can be good but her gadget is as reliable as Gas station Sushi and requires more cooperation with teammates
---
On PS4 it isn't bad until you meet that one guy who is super toxic and only has one friend who is in every game with him.
---
I it isn't bad usually though. But tking happens a lot

Just keep playing.

Also fucking spray and pray you kill them. Has worked for me!
---
Nice,
---
sorry where in a round, lets try it again hehe. OKay so I am game sharing the game to him, and i have the year 4 pass. He can only see year 4 , and buy core,y1,y2 operators, Y3 operators are not on on the list to buy?
---
And also he dont start with any of the core operators?
---
If it were up to me I'd thanos snap half the community tbh and ash mains are pretty high up on my list
---
g r e e n
---
Every op has 4 points in speed and armor
---
Why
---
Kinda. Love the game, hate the community. I can't stand the circle jerk everyome jumps on. Like every jokes about bugs, up votes sau-siege no matter what, talks like babies in the rainbow is magic event. 
---
The people are just... Annoying...
---
Can say spraying has working time and time again.
---
Oh you poor child
---
Toxic asf
---
The left one has Wolfes on it
---
And Insurgency players will fuck up realistic
---
I try to be nice, maybe a bit to much. I say hi gl hf ask how its going and try to make people laugh
---
So basically opinions should be punished.
---
Do you even know what the weird kid is?
---
They basically lined up for death.
---
It just happens, you got unlucky.
---
We don‚Äôt do that here
---
Id bet they haven‚Äôt because of toxicity, and how in the last year they have really aimed to bring that down
---
Most of the time when I play in the morning this happens. I just woke up and I'm wanting to warm up but I can't if I get TK'd.
---
When matchmaking accidentally matches your diamond rank with coppers so you can practice on noobs.

I left CSGO for this because I got tired of having to run FaceIt just to have a decent experience, since MM is a meme... and a really shit one at that, too, at this point. Also doesn't help that, well, spinbotters still find a way to creep in and bypass FaceIt's proprietary anti-cheat from time to time (as rare as that is, it actually made me prefer to deal with the vaulting+teleporting cheats that happen in Siege). Plus the meta is stale.
---
From now on you have to paly on coulor blind mode for creepers sake
---
Yeah when he has impacts equipped
---
Exactly you get it
---
I wonder if Jackal would have a foot fetish
---
you know that would be pretty cool

I queued against King George once when he was diamond, and was stacked w 3 other diamonds and a play 2. None of us were diamond and we even had a gold 1 in our stack lmao
