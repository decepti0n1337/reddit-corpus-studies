Yeah I can't tell you how many times I've lost because of that stupid mechanic. Absolute cancer.

I answered to the guy saying glaz should be able to kill Mira behind her miroir. 
---

---
Just damaging it a bit I‚Äôm not against.
---
It‚Äôs 17+ to legally purchase the game not to possess or play

You‚Äôre about 6 months late

Do like the silencer aspect of it.

Ela? You mean Frost? Or did I miss something?
---
5 of the kin will never rise again

I had the wrong video my bad. I gotta remove it

Mira lacks counters, which is why she gets banned so damn much.

Goyo sets up his shield at the door. The other two places strategically around you as to protect you from stray bullets. He waits patiently behind one, keeping you company. Capitao readies his crossbow, sights at the door. Fuze looks around aimlessly. The terrorists try to enter but are met by the shield. As they clump up, Goyo smirks before whipping out his vector and exploding them all to finish round one in a split second. "EZ" his says. Round 2 begins and the terrorists make their way in. This time without the shield, Capitao unleashes a bolt of fire, killing half of them, Goyo finishes the rest off. All looks good so far. Fuze exits the room in haste. Goyo is perplexed. Round 3 begins and Capitao unleashes his last bolt and the round ends just as easily as round 2. "EZ" says Goyo. Round 4 commences but without the fire, the terrorists are able to enter much faster. With Goyo and Cap under pressure, a loud thud is heard followed by the sound of popping. "Oh shit run" screams the two defenders. But it was too late the entire room was engulfed in a cluster charge and fire. Fuze appears, "mission accomplished."
---
Yooooooou
---
I would hate it if N√∏kk had good DPS.
---
The shield thing will either be useless or broken. I guess he‚Äôs a defender because the other is an attacker so an ar will be a bit too powerful for defense look at jager with his carabine.
---
The attacker is simply broken, he/her will take the place of all hard breacher and defense couldn‚Äôt do anything.
---
That's what I always thought. But my friend gave me shoft for not doing the best every game.
---
She has enough counter.
---
Twitch can destroy her miroir 
---
Vertical play you use the map to destroy/ evade her miroir 
---
Frags to kill he behind it 
---
Smoke of the miroir so she can‚Äôt see.
---
This will be way too op and glaz will be a must pick on some points. It‚Äôs too powerful of a counter.
---
Chain link fences don't block bullets
---
agree
---
the last couple of minutes were truly breathtaking
---
your hiding from it if you‚Äôre out of its range

Halloween gamemode. It's active for like 1 more day

I like running Alibi with the shotgun, don't @ me.
---
What the bottom one
---
This isn‚Äôt impressive
---
It is extremely hard to find a squad for me. My friend has been making one but cant find our final player and im getting restless
---
Just glad Glaz was included
---
It sucks fat cock tho

The lord's helmet , I was gonna carve the bottom out aswell and wear it as a helmet but realised I don't want my head smelling of pumpkin .

You can say recruit is trans if that makes you happy.

‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS ON STAIRS‚Äù -both teams prior to this bloodbath
---
People are still complaining about this?  Casual isnt meant to be a tryhard gamemode. Of course people are going to meme. And if they are all friends and you arent doing a recruit rush with them i dont know why people are suprised to get kicked. Im mot sure if untanked is still running but if you want a serious game play that or ranked. Casual is meant to be a memey/fun/ non-serious gamemode.
---
Yeah maybe. I don‚Äôt really know programmation but it‚Äôs possible.
---
How long until you become u/I_wana_fuck_Dave ?
---
nope
---
Thought you were Chowder Head for a sec, the guy who lent Russian Badger the Chanka helmet
---
while spraying or burst ?
---
Apex had it since the beginning because of the story and the suspense they intended to create. for instance, bloodhound, the reason for not mentioning the gender is well embedded into the entire background of "bludhunders". Similar case with Gibby.
---
Just that the audience was happy with the post release.
---
Because it is a virtual world video game designed for fun.
---
In those 3 minutes of engagement in a round, your "virtual" gender no longer matters. All that matters is landing your shots.
---
Dude in the leak they litterally talk about the operator with the bolt action being able to deal with defender gadgets like Thatcher so I mean that is EXACTLY a Thatcher glaz hybrid dude.
---
Perhaps it's [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&amp;v=Lp2ghaBJN5Y)?

Der Schwanensee - Suite, Op. 20, Act II: Tanz der kleinen Schw√§ne
---
This is one of the more subtle reasons I like PC over console. Since you can lean without being required to ADS, you can have more precise crosshair placement, allowing you to get the kill
---
Fuze: It's free real estate
---
Yes I even get scared when a teammate doesn‚Äôt even know how to properly use Cav
---
lol xD
---
Lol nah, would rather found out if their toxic or not :)
---
Sorry dude until you can prove to me that a super powers magnet can stop a chemical reaction your full of shit dude nothing your talking about makes ANY SENSE now goodbye and good ridence
---
Call me toxic but what's the difference between crosshair placement and aiming?
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
See I disagree. sure casual is meant to be fun and not try hard, But you should still be able to play a match with out it being memey. Or at the least without having to be kicked cuz I didn't choose the right operator. But I'll give unranked a go. I usually don't play it since I'm just hoping on for a quick match or two and might unfortunately have to be afk at times.
---
No üò≠
---
I‚Äôm basically a maestro main and the Alda recoil is very easy to control
---
Yeah doesn't matter if it's a teammate or not, I still have that oh shit moment when im running through the map and see her!
---
Just raise your volume honestly. I play on 70 and I can hear everything perfectly. The game still had audio issues regardless
---
She doesn't need one. She'll just punch through.
---
As i have mentioned, i didnt do it because it happened once, i did it because it has happened a lot
---
Lol ya
---
I get scared when my teammate is Cav and she's anchoring at the beginning of the match. (After prep not during prep phase)
---

The exact effects of each attachment are described in this video. You can also probably find a screenshot of the summary table somewhere.
---
Again, don't be bad and clutch it then you won't get kicked
---
We do have it. It's his base skin cause a god can't get more elite
---
they bugged out, for some reason the last 3 got stuck in cctv, you can hear them doing something in the camera on the balcony between it and armory
---
I'm sorry. My dumb ass is having trouble making sense of this. Think you could reword it for me?
---
i just said first shot recoil if you read it
---
Looks Awesome! Could‚Äôve used him in our group.

Too bad I can't get exactly 150 R6 credits. Shouldn't have bought the 1 credit charm.

Is this one new? I‚Äôd honestly main this machine pistol if I ever got that

It's not just being bad though. I'm talking about as soon as it is one person. Kicking starts. Which is bullshit

Thanks
---
You both toxic lol
---
name me one PL team that does it
---
*I'll wait*
---
Yes it is get over it
---
I want a J√§ger alternative more then anything because right now he has no competition and is picked almost 100% of the time. Do what they did for Bandit/Kaid and make a op similar in use but different in execution.
---
r/expectedjojo
---
Bruh, my secondary and trimary main are gone!
---
that's actually really true, they could either give an attacker alternative to thatcher who could take out gadgets, or maybe just make a new op, like you said, it's a great idea.

Could have been Escape from Tarkov, I think it was released in beta/alpha before the new Insurgency game was announced.

The worst deaths arent when you hit them a lot and they dont die, but rather when they dont take any damage at all.

But its so bad

using a defender to counter a single attacker who is rarely used is not worth it, but sushi642 has a point with countering breach charges from above
---
It may be a fair tactic, but you're still taking away from others experience just to better your own. A bit of a selfish way to play. Some people don't get alot of time to play this game due to work/school/life and it's just inconsiderate to shoot someone before they've moved 10 feet.

maybe connect your laptop to a monitor and you get better resolution and you can see further

This is actually pretty neat!

The reason that she has barbed wire or a deployable shield is because they are meant to be used in conjunction with her gadget to   slow the attackers down to a crawl when they push objective and / or Elas position.

its not that it matters, it a game about special forces, its rather interesting to have different ones.

No

I bet you kick people for no reason
---
I'm considering Silver as low in this case, i mean people don't even have any game sense at this point, i don't see why use dokki when you can't even communicate properly with your team
---
I've never played R6, can anyone fill me in to what is happening here?
---
Depends on who you ask, some people like myself find it cool to have mira and jackal in the game since it's nice to see spainiards get put on the spotlight, others may not care as much about it and would rather care about gameplay, mechanics first when looking into rainbow.

Representation in terms of LGBT, minorities, etc. I‚Äôm not 100% bothered by this because Rainbow 6 is a international counter-terrorist group coming from around the world, and this game isn‚Äôt really story driven so you can kinda ignore it.

Ubi is aiming at "realistic game" so teamkilling will *always* stay in the game. Not sure about kicking tho. If someone is really toxic and ruins your game its good to be able to kick that person.

One issue. Similar to how Fuze was super strong in Year 1 when we didnt have a grasp of the various sounds cues in the game, wouldn't Razor become irrelevant as players learn the decoy audio off by heart so they know the particular gun fire noise it makes and can ignore it/not fall for it then?

True but nobody is obligated to do that. There is no hard and fast rule that there *have* to be LGBT characters. So Ubi is at the liberty to add it or not.
---
again, that means the game is intended for a more adult audience, if kids dont like it thats **TUFF** but not really of concern since they shouldn't be playing anyway.

* Do the situations, watch the tutorial videos for free renown.

* Play terrorist hunt until you get to level 10.

* Then play unranked until you get to level 30.

*Then play ranked.

* Don't waste your time with casual, the only thing you will learn there is bad habits and how toxic this community can be.

I was expecting the enemy team to bunch up on the hatch to do a group drop and you kill em all with one smoke canister but this was just as satisfying. :D

The MP5-SD would be wonderful. Then I'd main her.
---
Anything that isn't the FMG-9
---
I agree
---
R4-C but very hard for that happen :(
---
Her ability is so situational, for her to be more viable i think she had to be entry fragger to attract players
---
Broken.

She's already fun. You just have to use her right.

---
I just want frags and I'll be happy.
---
First for Defence, play all the passive operators like Jager, Frost, Rook, Mute where you put down the gadgets and forget about it. Stick in or around the objective. Know the area.
---
For Attacker, almost everyone good choices except Glaz.
---
Like one of the guy said... take it slow, it isn't CoD. 
---
One last important tip... increase your volume! Footsteps, body movement shuffling, reloading of weapon, droning all gives away enemy position and you can take them out before they you.
---
My bad
---
You wouldn't be killing people any quicker with it though, considering that it has the dead same stats as and higher recoil than the fmg9.
---
5 seconds before disaster
---
Oh so thats where the last terrorist is on Villa T Hunt

ah there's the reason you think they're irrelevant

Where do you find these opponents??
---
No, but I have done it many times lol.
---
Hit registration get used to it, I've been killed when going into cover and they miss me by a few inches with their bullets
---
My Question : 
---
If just added one option, is it a buff or nerf?
---
The area around the double door. Between the two softwalls.
---
Ah, I‚Äôve never quit a game prematurely so I wasn‚Äôt aware of that.
---
There‚Äôs a huge perception issue going on rn
---
Would you rather the people abusing the free nature of killing you and continue getting to play or just be more observant of your team mates being dumb? There‚Äôs always goin to be flaws in a system, but players ruining the game for others should be punished.
---
That was implemented shorty before DDOSing became a big issue and is currently turned off.  I would expect it to come back next season.

Well I definitly said it wrong there. But I mainly like him for his gun. But yes, I agree.

That why I said do what some people do main multiple ops and I do this myself and it‚Äôs a good way to branch out, I‚Äôm naturally good with every op so I don‚Äôt really need to branch out, but you can‚Äôt just tell someone not to do something let the man main someone and yes lion is a really good main he‚Äôs on my main list I have atleast 5 ops who I main on attack and defense

I get stuck if I try to go up steps at an angle -_-

Credit to u/Your_Bucket for making this

Sadly. But I think what this shows is that there  are still major holes and therefore flaws in the system.
---
Ela Elite will be released somewhere at the end of the season like every leaked elite does . Smoke's elite got released at the end of Phantom sight . Bandit elite got released at the end of Burnt Horizon . This is from the pattern i learned
---
Good choice.
---
Only the game. Anything else is optional.

Uhhh the swastika is not a rainbow six country
---
Why is the reflection on the purple goggles not a garage?
---
I agree with your general point, but I will say that this season ubi implemented much more harsh abandon penalties. I believe they should keep making them more harsh but it‚Äôs a tricky line for them because if they for whatever reason have a season with more disconnects (due to client or server issues) then they really end up shooting themselves in the foot if they make abandon penalties very strict
---
This game is much less stable than other esport titles mostly because of the old and improper engine they‚Äôre using, so it makes sense they‚Äôve struggled with the abandon penalties
---
I don't really know tbh I mean you are new and not ranked yet so in theory you should be placed against other unranked players but it's mid season and your playing with friends I assume it will be rank based on the hosts level but again not 100 percent sure
---
Blyat
---
The credits just came in , just had to wait.
---
No.  If you are willing to put in time, you can unlock everything you need with renown (in-game currency you get after every match).  The cosmetics are very much optional.  It's nice to have all ops available (they are mostly variations on base ops that might be a bit better suited to a particular round), but the base ops are sufficient and pretty quickly unlocked.

There is a very steep learning curve, but the gains as your knowledge and skills improve are worthwhile.
---
I guess I never thought of that. You‚Äôre right we haven‚Äôt had a male attacker since Maverick in Grim Sky. Oh well it doesn‚Äôt bother me or else I would‚Äôve noticed by now.
---
I see. I really appreciate your reply.
---
That's if it was a normal stun. However, Ying's candellas often work differently. I've had candellas stun me from halfway across a room when I was turned around many times. And then theres other times when they literally dont work right next to you. They are so inconsistent it's ridiculous. You never know if they will work or not. It really needs to be fixed.

I always thought it was kindof like the worlds strongest man competitors. They have a lot of muscle but not a lot if definition and are still very physically fit. That's how I had always thought of Gridlock.

good job my mans
---
Decent idea, but at the same time there's some problems with it. We dont need any more operators who don't require any skill to play. We already have lion, dokkaebi, finka etc. Just one click of a button can affect a whole round with close to no risk. The good think about doc's stems is that he often needs to expose himself in order to heal teammates and he cant shoot at the same time. If we wanted a healing operator on attack, it would be better to have something similar. A menu you can access from anywhere and heal anyone at any time wouldn't be good, way too op. But the general idea is alright
---
I don‚Äôt think I can really blame your teammates. You are FUCKING AWFUL!!!
---
that's disgusting , i love it

Lmao didn‚Äôt even see it.. omw to #1 on the leaderboard I guess
---
I don‚Äôt care about upvotes lol you can go back to tryharding now.
---
My enemies don't miss
---
I honestly wouldn't like a rework. When they do that they take the random chaos that comes with casual. It sucked when they reworked Hereford from a crazy fun map, into a linear map that got stuck in casual anyway.
---
Ehh, you guys are misconstruing a games rating with the unrated behavior of online play. ERSB (and PEGI I‚Äôm assuming) always state that online is unrated and gameplay experience will vary. 
---
There are T rated games (like battlefront 2 or Overwatch) where online chat is the exact same as siege. It isnt filtered (except certain hate speech words that get you instabanned).

The father should still be aware of this very fact though. If he doesn‚Äôt want his kid around that then it‚Äôs prob not best to place him in it.

He meant it in a cute way, but we have dirty minds my friend, really dirty

That only happens if you make to the building.  I usually try to spawn peak all the attackers on Favela way before they can rappel up the side of the building.
---
This was the most lazy attempt to block out a name I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Looking good so far man. Keep working at it and you'll feel great about what you've done.
---
 I still have continuous work to do on my frost.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I figured. But knowing that a rusher can have that advantage, what are some ways I can decrease that advantage? I was thinking maybe it was stupid that I waited since I knew exactly where she was and that I should‚Äôve just risked trading shots.
---
I try to observe the top players of the match whenever I die, and it seems like aggressive playstyle is the key, or at least cautious aggression.
---
Can still fuze the window and doesn't change the fact that that objective is the most poorly designed in the game.
---
Gad damn it Francis!
---
That's fine with me. If Ubisoft pumps out enough annoying operators, then I'll finally be able to play my man Echo consistently again.
---
Source?
---
This is a dream come true
---
I like Favela for its unbalanced nature, I dont think every single map to ever exist needs a rework because its not competitive.
---
This remind me of some other post with the exact same problem (don't remember the game though), turns out someone mapped one of the regular key to F4 and then through fancy combination of said mapped key and push-to-talk was Alt+F4'ing his game. You sure OP, you dond't do that?
---
Sad mute :(
---
Especially on a map that old you should know the spots
---
People in for honor would want this too
---
Yeah was gonna say the same
---
No it doesnt best map in the game
---
Tell that to every experienced ranked player that gets stuck with an unranked lvl 30 with no ranked experience. If you're brand new to the game, then yes, unranked is a perfect starting point. You'll get the map knowledge, and learn a few cheeky strats on top of playing with ranked rules.
---
I mean at this point we should at least got the background picture of the new season and the operation name
---
That'll teach me to use cams.
---
It happened for me too i think its same for everyone
---
nah?

No need to nerf cav though

Amazing job!

Alright bro

Pretty sure they allude to Jaeger having autism in his bio... And pulse's heart obvs.

I‚Äôm at the same lvl as you and I‚Äôve played casual all the way up until recently where I tried ranked and, well I feel as if I‚Äôm getting better but I‚Äôve just gotten completely rekt so far, but hey, I just need to practice by playing more ranked, and casual is really fun and people are generally pretty nice
---
Like I said, I dont think it would be a nerf. It takes too long to use. 5 seconds was a bad idea, but if the timer was  set to 10 seconds or more for when you can in case the Cav needs to do something before she can interrogate you, I think it would be okay.
---
2 armour now

Well they changed him to a 2 speed but lets be honest a suit would still be a 3 speed.

it's a game

Kanal used to be a casual map, now it‚Äôs a ranked map. I actually enjoy the map tbh, even though it‚Äôs defender sided.

He's 2 armor now and there's no logical reason why he was 3 armor

Thanks! I'll look into that.

this but unironically

Ranked is awful (in terms of the surprise you get in how stupid good some can be vs you) imo and I‚Äôve played for about 2 years at this point and feel confident saying I‚Äôm pretty decent. 
---
Socially: Casual and Unranked is fun, but you‚Äôll still find dick heads from time to time in either. But most often the entire match will back you up if someone‚Äôs whining about how you killed them or how you suck or whatever when it‚Äôs casual. So generally casuals a great time and I spend most of my time between it and Unranked. And then you have ranked. And its the worst as you‚Äôd expect because teammates have ranks they lose if you throw their match (whether you meant to or not). So they bitch in your ear the whole game and try to have you kicked if you make a mistake. 
---
Gameplay Difficulty: Casual is a bit easier to do well in than Unranked and casual is a ton easier to do well in than ranked. At least for your placement period in ranked. Because the game doesn‚Äôt really know your skill and the spread of talent between you and opponents can be wide as it tries to capture your ability. Theoretically, you should eventually be placed in a pool of players at your similar level of skill and it may not be so bad.
---
Uh, I think it also had a bit of wiggle physics given to it by smonk himself

Hello TheLovelyLad, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ds512j/this_is_why_i_use_goyo/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You can learn playing unranked and casual. Youre still going to fighting ranked players in both modes and you can learn from them. Thats how I found most my spawnpeeking, anchoring spots and whatnot.
---
Nice lol
---
It will always be one of my favorite games of all time. Makes me jump harder than any horror game playing terrorist hunt solo and getting instant killed by a shotgunner screaming COME ON, AIM AND SHOOT
---
Yes, that is true. Kanal has, or I guess had (it is now), the potential to be a good comp map. I just think the developers should focus more on other things rather than revamping the casual maps.

Actually satisfying to see

Ikr. Especially when they go to the same spot in the next round thinking the outcome will be different.
---
You're right because the hit redge always goes to the perspective of the person you're trying to shoot. Meaning it's more difficult trying to hit someone while they're trying to repel in compared to if they were standing up normally
---
These are excuse not actual reasons let's be honest
---
Yeah I would have textures on low, but it didn't impact performance for me much, and looks so much better on high. High shadows enables dynamic shadows, so you can sometimes see an enemies shadow before they round a corner
---
I‚Äôd let Zofia step on me

Good.

Never forget the legendary ragdoll physics. Throw a grenade into a room, stand by the door outside, and watch as a body comes flying out of the same door like an ice skater.

Truth. You'll learn more in casual, too. You'll learn even more by playing in unranked.

The issue with cheating is that the developer is always on the back foot by nature.
---
Cheat is developed -&gt; cheat becomes known -&gt; cheat becomes patched.
---
The developer has to know the exploit exists before it can be patched, which always means that cheating will be an issue.

Sticking together is not the same as being all in the same room. Against an organized team you will pretty much never get an interrogation because they are most of the time at least 2 together plus they will call out that there‚Äôs a cav on them so the team will either run to safety before the interrogation or if someone is near will kill the cav. When a team what they are doing with communication a cav is really easy to kill.

1. Abandon penalty will again become harsher. Ubi reverted that due to DDOSers kicking people off games.
---
2. This would not work. Too many smurfs. The only instance where leaving should affect the game is when a player leaves prior to first round starting. The player should get abandon penalty and the match should be canceled with no MMR lost / gained on either side.
---
i prefer night mode because gun shots dont make you deaf and it makes footsteps louder

That to, I said casual just because of the fact they were playing newcomers first ya know

5 stack or ace every round

Ok, maybe I'm an idiot, but I still don't see what you mean.  The guy wasn't trying to rappel, he's on defense.  Are you complaining about the lack of a headshot?  Thats the only thing I can come up with.

An attacker who can put up barricades so you can hear roamers breaking them down behind you. Or a defender with some type of sonar would be cool it could amplify footsteps.

I‚Äôd like to see an operator that has barbed wire that can only be destroyed with explosives and are bigger.

But they rejoin shortly after, so they never "died"

Epic save
---
The game is by nature asymmetrical. It would make sense that defense would be a little stronger though. They're able to set up tools to make attacking difficult, while at the same time they're better able to control engagements so they can take more in their favor.
---
Because its good

That wasnt serious bruh reddit meme fail

You can screenshot on Xbox...

Oof im the 3300th upvote lol
---
Another basic answer
---
Ok so your warming up waiting for your friends topp come online, do you A - play a game mode where you can leave when they come online to join them or B - play unranked and not able to leave?
---
Looks good, a great first attempt. I would tear the duct tape in half and redo the mouthpiece. other than that it's looking good.
---
I mean, videos are a lot more entertaining buuut... ok...
---
Also (and I‚Äôm not saying that you did), but using the screenshot kinda makes it look like you‚Äôve gotten the kills in 2 rounds rather than a single round, which obviously means it wouldn‚Äôt be an ace.
---
On a streaming website i sure have

*visible anger*
---
They always show an unique elite at the reveal ( this first elite comes out at the beginning of the season ) and a second elite is leaked on the test server ( this second elite  is released at the end of the season - bandit, smoke ). Ela is the leaked elite so it should come out before the reveal. And then they can announce a new elite during the season reveal.
---
My prediction is : Ela this week, Cav announced sunday and either Buck or Capitao on the test server
---
I still haven't found out how to invite people from a party to my games. This is why I play mostly on xbox
---
I've thought about something similar to this, but it would be to reinforce the floors or ceilings in some parts of the obj.  Could prevent Buck/Sledge from opening up LOS from above/below.  
---
Imagine on border un Armory Lockers.  The enemy team brings a buck to shoot out the batteries on the outside wall from below.  It you had the reinforced floor it would take away that strat

It wouldn't let me screen shot if I had messages pulled up, how do I do so?

You're an idiot. Casual is where people are going to rush the most. Rushing isn't sweaty, it's the opposite. It's braindead. Hardly anyone rushes in ranked because it's super risky. People always rush in casual because there are no stakes. GITGUD

---
I‚Äôd also like to add one of your main argument ‚Äúpoints‚Äù is your personal life, bro having nosebleeds don‚Äôt mean squat to the game, you can have a stressful day as you want or a good day, the game is going to stay the same and nobody is going to compensate your nosebleeds and just let you kill them... like bro we all have college, we all have school, and we all have work... I mean I‚Äôm at college 8:30am - 5:30am from Monday to Friday then I have 8 hours shifts on both Saturday and Sunday... you don‚Äôt see me complaining when I get rushed... it‚Äôs a game... if people want to rush on casual then they will... if you‚Äôre that salty about it play a different game!

Have you tried turning it on and off
---
Here's some tips (if anyone cares) 
---
Try placing the prismas later in the round in case of shock drone (plus other drones can alert the team of their placement) 
---
Deployable shield  - if you or a teammate places a shield in a doorway, placing a prisma behind it allows for 2 things: (1) u can do prisma-trick. (2) either the attackers use utility on the shield or you scan whoever enters that way
---
Anything except stock uniform and headgear will give you a way if you try to trick.
---
Hope you enjoy :)
---
Had a mate clip it, the similarity in usernames isn't a coincidence
---
And make the ‚ÄúCHK‚Äù camera sound
---
Why would I? If I dont enjoy it I dont have to. A lot of people dont play ranked because of the change they made. Not everyone enjoys it. Im not being butt hurt Im adressing a problem this game has which is still not fixed. Youre just salty with some basic answers that most people give

I saw someone say the G36C, and even though I don't think it would happen that would be cool. Realistically, I'd probably want her to get Lesion's T-5. It's a solid gun which handles nicer than the FMG-9 to a lot of people, and I think she'd look cool holding it. Alternatively, I'd like her to get the MP5K. It's statistically identical to the FMG-9, but in my experience it feels a little more fluid.

does anyone happen to have outbreak recruit's PNG protrait?
---
It‚Äôs not a smurf if it‚Äôs becoming your new main account, but if you are still worried, wait till next season.
---
Gotta love the C75. I'm not sure if I'm just accustomed to the weapon, but it's recoil feels about on par with a primary.
---
Maybe you're correct for the attacker. I remember a long time ago (more than a year, maybe around Para Bellum if I remember correctly?) devs said they were making the Thatcher EMPs only disabling cameras in order to prepare for more changes in electronic gadget denial mechanics.
---
Can‚Äôt you just show them your k/d over the past few seasons?
---
It's not a good gun. But God is it fun to use.
---
But would it be bad if I used my current main account to play with friends and only use the smurf for ranked?
---
The game isn't even serious anymore, ain't no point.
---
A terrible photo?

---
It doesn‚Äôt show that to my knowledge and I get kicked before I can explain

That sparks an interesting Gadget idea, doors (regardless of bulletproof or not and a window (same, regardless of bulletproofs) Mira of doors

My bad my bad just think of your grandma or puppies dying that‚Äôll not make you wanna jack off I promise

Yeah that‚Äôs around the time they changed him to only disable cameras. They said a rework was coming for him I believe but never mentioned it again.

Video settings,

Disable vsync

He can probably walk while holding his turret. A visual example is probably like Halo and running around with the minigun turret.
