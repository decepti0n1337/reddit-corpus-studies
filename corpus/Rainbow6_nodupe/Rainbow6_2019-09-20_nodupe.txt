Ohh there use to be glitch last season ,if you started a game before you opened your aplah pack you would get duplicateted , lol that's how I unlock buck .

Yes, here!

Strange. Must have just been crappy connection or a lapse in connection is my best bet
---
Square up boi
---
Right. I am not advocating for the removal of rewards. What I'm saying is, there are better, healthier ways to reward people for playing than based on MMR. 
---
Used to be that cosmetics, which could be earned by investing time and/or completing challenges filled that role, but every publisher is hell-bent on selling/gambling those nowadays.
---
Getting better an increasing your MMR is something that should very much be it's own reward. Or, to put it another way, your primary reward for winning at ranked is to face more interesting challenges going forward. People who aren't interested in that shouldn't be pushed into playing the mode, because they'll just have a bad time and ruin it for others.
---
BABY! its a triple!
---
the only legendary I have is a banana charm.
---
thanks for a challenge i can never complete
---
Yeesh
---
No way
---
I turned into a unicorn.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you ‚Äúworked hard for the ops‚Äù they‚Äôre a pain in the ass and people don‚Äôt want to deal with them
---
mom says its my turn on the turret
---
Look at any template ever and it will say that all the compensator does is make the reticle smaller.
---

---
Repost.
---
Yeah i thought so xd i couldve sworn ive seen this a couple times but ive seen so many caveira ones too i cant even keep track
---
ping it then they know what to do
---
Fairly sure he used the alibi to bait out the enemy, I've done it before
---
I think we all have comrade
---
Yeah we get very little for getting beat by one, we usually lose 50 for losing and because they were cheating we get 20 back, but when you beat a cheater you lose 50 mmr
---
I don't get tilt playing seige. I do that out of consideration to the people in random. I'll Alt-F4 against a Cav for the same reason I don't spawn peek, even if that logic is a little off.
---
Alright
---
Nah it works just fine. You just place the GU mine about a foot behind the welcome mat and you're good.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
If someone leaves, they should just leave a ‚Äúbot‚Äù to stay idle in the DBNO stage. If the quitter (somehow) enters back before anything happens to him he joins back where the bot is left off. Or if the devs want to be harsher, make the player join next round. If the bot gets recovered, it instantly dies. 
---
The ‚Äúbot‚Äù just needs to sit idle, waiting for the bleedout time to go down. It shouldn‚Äôt do anything else. 
---
This allows cav to interrogate a body, while allowing the rest of the offense to revive their teammate to prevent the cav interrogation.
---
What seems to be the issue?
---
oh, shits gettin hella real
---
This is actually in fact, something I made, obviously I used this background for inspiration, I traced it in full detail, then cleaned it up and used a different color palette besides the tachanka logo, here are some pictures of me drawing it. Just finished it today and being called a liar LUL (I'll post the pictures of me drawing it in the process)
---
Buddy gotta be more diligent what can i say.
---
I have school so I won't be on much
---
That enemy team got bent real quick
---
Sorry that was unclear I meant by how they were talking real life things so I threw one back
---
Crying like a loser? For sure!
---
Sorry for the dumb question, but does this update remove the Kanal only play mode on the main screen already?
---
Yeah u whiffed
---
Got a fuckin Pulse headgear ffs I wanted a Black Ice god damn it üò´üò´
---
Thats true, maybe making it so a roll where you dont get one in winning games can increase it, but in losing games you dont gain any whatsoever?
---
According to Korean folk tales, it‚Äôs known for annoying ppl and pranking them.
---
Damn all the pellets connected to the chest. Nice.
---
let's be honest here, this should be soo much higher on the list, its soo well done as well as bring out the true nature of blitz!
---
‚Äúan insinuation or allegation about someone that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation‚Äù
---
Jesus man, quit attacking me please
---
It may be counting situations in there.  Play and win a few more and see what happens.
---
Ate tou playing on pc cause on cons3tjere a button that adds all of them

OP normally comments on Mortal kombat subs, they commonly use the term League for rankings on the competitive side of the game.

Ooooh that's be nice.

---
depends what rank you are. copper-gold, kills is how you win. plat 2 and up is when it becomes much more tactical. losing a specific operator could cost the team a whole round, because theyre creating strats involving specific operators and playstyles. whereas a gold or lower team will just follow base meta strats and hope they have the better aim
---
It's usually a joke between siege players but yeah. If you're at max health and doc gives you heals, he wants you to get in there
---
Suppressor without laser for extra *stealth*
---
I actually did.
---
Haha I like your flair
---
YEET!
---
Nice but have those kids are bots
---
thats the lazer sight bud. muzzle break is vert, comp is side, flash hider is a compromise between them.
---
I actually feel sad for you cause glitches on consple aren't that common
---
F
---
Caillou trap remix (thug version) is the best
---
We will probably have multiple season of recycled weapons from now on though
---
Play spiderwoman.
---
A little context. I made a post that I was looking for criticism and I posted a t-hunt if my regular play style. This is me after taking some criticism
---
find a team. i solo queue and i have to carry the shitters on my team. i went 5-5 on placements and got plat 2

They got clapped

Give me some of your luck with black ice, I only seem to get secondaries and shotguns.
---
Also, i feel like more people will be happy from knowing that there is a definite chance of getting an epic than just hoping to yourself
---
What if friendly fire was disabled in prep phase so it gives people time to escape and stuff
---
Source?
---
dont listen to him. if youre on xbox, just quit the app and siege, if it keeps happening do a hard reset.
---
a hard reset is where you hold the xbox power button for approximately 10 seconds, then remove the power supply for 30 seconds
---
This is something I've been complaining to my friend about ever since she was released
---
Look at retpepegas reply hes the guy who drew this
---
Man I got the flower skin for fuze's lmg
---
Still lookin?
---
I meet a lot of players around lvl 1\~70 in casual too. Seems like I get matched with the newbies who don't use newcomer playlist.
---
When will they patch keyboard in console
---
the deluxe version should only be $30 or so. they dont make the base game anymore because its a waste of time to unlock all the operators from scratch
---
A garage?
---
Maybe. It looked to me like I got a shot in her before she shot but you could be right. I‚Äôm just surprised because everyone talked about the Supernova like it was garbage
---
Yeah getting ops is hard
---
I would stop lean spamming, and start leaning around corners to make sure they're clear.
---
Ayeeeee happy cake day my guy
---
thats great
---
So according to you finka should only give a 20hp bonus and nothing else?
---
Hey thanks

I‚Äôm tryna stop. I don‚Äôt even mean to do it most of the time. It‚Äôs kinda just a reflex

Until you get fucked on

fuck off

And how do I uninstall it?
---
We were on the verge of greatness. We were this *stretches arms out to show the length of the unit* close.
---
That's not what I said at all. Finka has so many more buffs and drawbacks than just the recoil reduction and the hp and I don't think those should go away.
---
Damn that's rough.
---
Thank you :)
---
&gt;!test!&lt;
---
i hope that change never makes it to the game. as a proud hostage killer i have to say its the best way i have ever won a round
---
Yeah, seems good, except that in unranked i go against plat 3/1 players and go 10-2, then go into ranked feeling good, and get 2-8.
---
Rip my expectations lol. üòÇ
---
I know how you feel 2 of my teammates got ddos me and my 2 friends ended up winning by pure shittery I went 16k 7a and 5d but it was 5 to 4 and they had the audacity to add us to a group and admit it and then called us hackers on ps4 because we won
---
Also carrys a phone
---
Did you exoect this guy here not to find the original post bruh its one of the top posts of all time
---
Every icon=100 of that operator
---
Nope you just got some shit luck
---
That wasn't the one from the challenge, you had an Alpha Pack before you collected the epic one.
---
No ones gonna mention that its part of "Operation (D)DOS OFF"? Idk about other places but, here generally, police operations dont contain words the reffer to what the operation is specifically about.
---
Just a normal pack. Restart the game
---
Yay proving art stealing scumwads with old links,thanks kind person
---
bruh, i got Black Ice for Ash's R4!!! Because of your comment I had no hope or expectations at all, so thank you!
---
We still need more!
---
Figures. RNGesus hates me in every game ever made.
---
*Clap sum alien cheeks*

https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets#xbox
---
Link will show all the headshets they have. Another option you have is that you could get like non gaming headsets and get a mod mic. If you really want like good audio and a mic as well.
---
I have just started to use steel series wireless on pc but before this I used to rock a audio technica m50x with a antilion mod mic. Bought a adapter and now use it on my consoles.
---
Woa thats crazy.
---
Same
---
Got an oil spill skin for BOPE pistols. Not bad honestly
---
Unfortunately
---
I was thinking 2 to 3 speed but I don't know I'll let the Devs polish out that detail LUL but i think it would be best if it was a throwable item like alibis but it doesn't "deploy" for a couple seconds and makes a noise before deploying to give you time to get to another angle and give the enemy a sound queue that's all i got so far also its kinda hard to explain with only typing ha
---
It just works!
---
U/retpepega said he'd post it tommorow as that's when he'll be in the class I don't understand this stuff
---
Did you have a stroke or do you just not know how to spell ‚Äúconsole‚Äù?
---
i got black ice for ash's r4, it does happen!
---
The first person to get shot through a hole in the wall must have been like...
---
The Ubi logo is outdated, I knew it was fake from the start lmao
---
Goya is what I would pick for his guns alone
---
Shouldn't it be u/uwutwanswator?
---
Good catch
---
It doesn‚Äôt even look like he hit OP, can someone explain what happened??
---
**_4/4 fuze_main_27 has left the game_**
---
Its tough my 207 friend only has the 5.7 and he got it twice
---
You're gonna want some Blitz up front.
---
It's 100% user preference with a non-magnified optic
---
Hax! Report!
---
Console will always hold a special place in my heart
---
Monty is no longer fun to play with the ads nerf
---
wait, what even is this?
---
:(
---
It still happens to this day.
---
It shouldnt ban or anything...their team will be down players for the rest of the game...thats better for you than one interrogation
---
Wouldn't do any good, people can just Alt F4 or quit the application on console.
---
Damn, what a way to show your alpha male dominance to the rest of the team
---
Why the W I D E face goyo?
---
But really, Chankacorn is where it's at.
---
Iq is super helpful to your team especially if they have a lesion or other trap ops. She can also see vigil's and pulse's ability through walls for some easy kills if you get the chance. Her guns are p good, if you get good with the pistol it can be pretty devastating since the gsg 9 handgun is p good.
---
Top quality dud.
---
Goyo requires good weapon skill and utility knowlege, Gridlock requires good weapon skill and utility knowlege
---
Do with it as you wish, If you like attack more then go for gridlock, Her F90 and super shorty allow for alot of map and angle manipulation
---
Or if you like defense more, Then ya boi-o goyo is your man, He can be essential on certain sites if you don't have an anti-plant for a backup roamer, He gets a great pistol and two of the best primarys
---
When I was gold 4 that happened to me when I was 1v1 against a plat and i managed to win (pretty sure he was carried)
---
I was just thinking that
---
A shitty skin will not make me use the P90
---
Ok cool. Thank you
---
Now she knows why it's called team rainbow
---
Well I mean, we already play against MnK
---
smh
---
Maybe like an option to crossplay like in matchmaking options
---
I just realized it says spetznaz and jackal at the bottom
---
In a casual match, me killing the hostage with a frag gave my entire team reverse friendly fire and resulted in no point awarded.  Additionally, match point was at 1 point up, and we won 2 points to 1
---
I want that skin
---
Shhhh no one needs to know
---
"Welcome to the family kid.."
---
Do you know how some people have the thing that says their main?
---
75
---
Lol this should not be bannable.
---
No one will notice if there is no one to notice
---
Put tape over it
---
Yeah, but they don't really advertise the fact. For corporations it's tricky, having the logo alongside means they're endorsing and in partnership. For games publishers such as Ubisoft, it's actually a customer/seller relationship (leasing their servers). There's a reason why you seldom see publishers or any other services advertise their servers.
---
Well u can get picked up, or do you mean person who downed them but not killed them should get the credit? I think u still get more points for downing then for finishing off a DBNO opponent
---
Check the stream on twitch.tv/typical_joker1
---
üó°ü§°

Ubisoft lie key calling out people who know J√§ger is an easy operator

Playing Cav, yeah that's bannable

I love the artstyle specially on the Palaloon Monty

think about thatcher dude

Only in thunt

Now that's a pro gamer move.
---
on sliver ranks you can take one of those sites without thermite by either pushing from control or cash. "Wasting" one of the thermite chargers  on the only hatch is kinda not too bad. 
---
What's stupid is you attacking your teammate and then getting killed by jager on a dumb location.
---
F¬≤
---
armadillo is fucking doing it to us
---
Ima guess doc died trying to spawn peek
---
Took me way too long to figure that out
---
If it didn't doesnt kill the hostage yeah
---
I see plenty of people on Newcomer usually.
---
A bulletproof, silent drone is useless? And the SMG 11 and PDW9 bad guns? Ok, buddy.
---
most scopes (magnified) have a distance from back lens to eye that they give a full picture (my rifle has a scope with 3-6 inch range for eye relief). 
---
red dots (like the cheap one I have on my stabilized pistol, comparable to a skorpion) work like magic: give a dot whether 2inches or a foot from your eye. But they are most comfortable (less blurry, less affected bt recoil) about 8 inches from your eye, sometimes more sometimes less.
---
Oh that makes sense now.
---
But who's G2. Is that a pro-league thing. I don't know, I never watched pro-league
---
No
---
red dots (like the cheap one I have on my stabilized pistol, comparable to a skorpion) work like magic: give a dot whether 2inches or a foot from your eye. But they are most comfortable (less blurry, less affected bt recoil) about **20.3 centimeters** from your eye, sometimes more sometimes less.

Hostage is gonna be invulnverable to fire so impact or shooting shield wont kill them. C4 most likely unless they have a chain reaction
---
That would be pretty awsome, and still kind of fit his aesthetic
---
Nice idea, but This would be mega op.
---
*my new main*
---
Cant wait that long thoooo
---
So there is basicly 3 areas a scope can effect you
---
Retical of the scope (for reflex its the triangle on the middle)
---
Sight window (the size of the area you can see inside the scope while ADSed)
---
Casing (its the size of the actual scope and how much of your view the scope wastes)
---
These are the rankings of which scope is best in which area
---
RETICLE: Holo&gt;Reflex&gt;Red dot
---
SIGHT WINDOW: Holo&gt;Red dot&gt;Reflex
---
CASING:  Reflex&gt;Holo=Red dot
---
So you see red dot is basicly so big it takes so much of your personal view, its sight window is ok but I personaly dont even get effected by it and the reticle is a small dot which is not ideal in most cases and makes it very hard to take long angles
---
But sights are mostly personal preference but no one seems to prefer red dot unless they are trying to meme with it. (I deffinetly dont know why that might be....) 
---
I used to use reflex on every gun now I use holo alot as well.
---
You can check get flanked's video for more detailed and graphical comparisons if you want.
---
Dude if you‚Äôre ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù tking often enough to the point where you actually die to rff then you‚Äôve got other shit to worry about.

In 1,352 matches on PC I‚Äôve had zero, and out of the 5162847252618847362556477326 posts in here about DDOSing I‚Äôve seen zero that were talking about PC. Not saying it never happens or isn‚Äôt possible, I don‚Äôt know, but console definitely is where it‚Äôs an issue and so it would make zero sense for a temporary change due to DDOSing to only be on PC.
---
Yeah, i could see there being problems, wanted to see if anyone had other thoughts on it
---
Sometimes. A pretty good rule of thumb there, is if the website looks like shit, and the prices are too good then it's probably a botnet.
---
I guess you dont remember the old ash = headless horseman memes huh
---
It's not coping because Ubisoft didn't make that character...
---
I hope they'll start banning ppl on PS4 too
---
Honestly idk, I just didn‚Äôt have it equipped for some reason.
---
Maybe something like this for defenders?
---
Lol
---
Military/LE human here. Absolutely is shooter preference. The placement of the rail will depend on the shooter and weapon configuration. Forcing a school of thought on someone is constrictive and detrimental to their ability to adapt and adjust to different environments. While yes, I'll agree a universal placements would be more centered on the rail of the receiver, it is not the only way.
---
Using this image as a reference and pretending an actual human being is using it there can be a perfectly logical explanation on why the optic is placed where it is. 
---
Ela is 5'6. A scorpion already has a moderately large stock. So with her having shorter arms, with it fully collapsed stock she would already have a moderate distance between her cheek weld and that optic. However if you look at it, she has the stock extended a bit, adding even more distance. In turn this would move the optic further away. On top of that you have to consider the clothing she's wearing and the addition of the plate carrier moving that optic even further. If you inject actual realism and consider all of that she actually has quite a substantial distance between her eye and that optic. Sidenote: There are also no backup irons and zero option for a magnifier to be placed in the rear.
---
Would I personally use her configuration? Fuck no, it would be extremely uncomfortable for me as a shooter, however I also understand people are built differently and will have different levels of comfort on weapon configuration. There are a lot of instructors and national circuit shooters out there that will there on this as well.
---
This is active now? So I got TK'd by 4 different people and they were all randoms and not squaded? Game is more toxic than I thought,  ugh.üôÑ

Ive carried every game and only have won 2 out of the 7 ive played, the matchmaking is so broken its not even funny
---
Oh wow I played with them yesterday
---
Ooooff sorry did this when i was tired
---
Or theres unranked ? Where it wouldnt matter if they did ??
---
I remember the time I just started playing the game and how I didnt understand a single thing that was happening. The key is never giving up and trying to improve from your misstakes. I had so much fun learning every small thing and finaly starting to get kills and understand the game.

I came from the future to say that the patch isn't going to work.
---
I too love the p90, the problem is that the mp5 can do everything it does only better
---
But the camera didnt go out...
---
It's mainly ps4 and Xbox.
---
same problem, yesterday worked fine. this patch seems to have broken the servers in sbr.
---
Lol that's been happening to everyone
---
Noon question, but what is RFF
---
i dont think id have a reason to go on there anyway, i know how bad reddit can be its why i havent posted till now. thanks for the heads up
---
You idiots realize that only LEOs can seize websites right? Not Ubisoft lmao.
---
When the feds seize a site, they absolutely would not put Ubis name on it, they gon take all the sweet credit. 
---
All the idiots who fell for this need to be banned from the internet.
---
This has happened to me and my friend for like the past 3 hours, we carry every single match with like 7-14 kills and always lose
---
Vro, she's 7
---
I think the skin is pretty. Let's discuss
---
Lol the dude deleted his post =(
---
GHMNUUUNMAMAUUUU

I think duplicate elimination would be great. It makes it more worthwhile to get alpha packs. Even if it‚Äôll be a common it‚Äôll chalk one off. I think the issue would arise when  people collect all the stuff. As little as that may happen, it‚Äôd create a renown surplus causing the cost of junk to go up.
---
How many packs did you get screwed on?
---
/s
---
Operators, the ingame characters, if you but deluxe edition or whatever it is you dont have to buy the default non dlc ops
---
How else are Ubisoft meant to make money?
---
Too many to count ;-; most recently the challenge one
---
Personally I like cav being banned because I hate playing against her, everyone's got their preference though
---
You can check this before post https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rpl2MtdWGxie2_jKbhdOPNDF5voOlZC7255fc3yZxG0
---
Yeah, well, the initial idea was to just monitor drones/static cams for both sides, the map thing was just what i thought of while typing
---
Packs can't be bought. It might maybe perhaps indirectly lower their income from bundles by a modicum of money.
---
Plus they're pushing a paid Battle Pass. Don't start with that shit
---
I don‚Äôt know to be honest...... there are so many better ops.
---
Didn‚Äôt someone on here do one with doc
---
Oh, that‚Äôs a baseball
---
That's in regards to the party invite ddos. The main and most commonly used DDOS method that's also being fix/targeted by Ubisoft is the direct server DDOS. 
---
Those servers are runned by Microsoft Azure team. 
---
&gt;IP protection on there servers
---
They dont hide the IPs of the people using the party communication service. Which has nothing to do with server protection, thats just outdated communication service design/code.
---
Ela bad. Zofia good.
---
Yeah companies arent seizing anything
---
There is a lot of intel available now. Could see this mega OP
---
Might be possible
---
did only i read a95 dildo?
---
Happened to me on upstairs Kafe by main skylight. I tried to have the drone drop and it just got stuck there. Couldn‚Äôt move or yokai blast
---
I feel like it's unreasonable to make all packs not have duplicates.
---
However, Legendary items should not be able have duplicates, it's actually impossible to get all the Legendaries because of this.
---
I feel like if the whole team is elite they should all celebrate in the MVP screen
---
If you win 3 unranked games you get a alpha pack with a guaranteed epic
---
You thought you were safe
---
Who the fuck are you talking/reading that says Nokk of all operators is overpowered? 
---
Nokk was considered underpowered 5mins after the TTS release.
---
A better way to achieve this is to dedicate a corner of your monitor/screen to host a ‚Äúdrone cam‚Äù sort of how streamers have facecams.
---
Yeah, there would be inherent problems, but with everyone having access to it, it would still be kinda fair, especially if they added a camara based intel gathering attacker in future.
---
Those memes are like 2-3 years old and wasnt that funny when it came out.
---
i think the player, even diconnected from the game, still should be visible if cav is in game, so she can do interrogation
---
I love the evil looking 'eyes'.
---
That looked like a shoulder shot but since you recorded it on your phone like a amateur we can't judge it probably.
---
upvotes you uncultured normie
---
Frags for glaz changes nothing.
---
No worries, think of the game as a shop clerk who is processing a customers transaction. But instead of dealing with one customer at a time a swarm of 100 customers are trying to pay at the same time. Each time one customer tries to pay another one cuts in and tries to pay meaning no one is able to pay.
---
Mine has been crashing at the end of any match, even Thunt local.
---
Uninstall moment. I notice the game rewards certain play ‚Äústyles‚Äù
---
Right but the season started last week, it goes on for like another 14 or so... when the game is in bits avoid it or accept the consequences
---
Just gotta get used to itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èhappens to all of us. Cheers
---
Nice
---
They should just make a delay on the model disappearing when someone leaves the game when downed. That way even after they leave the game, the model will persist until it bleeds out giving you ample time to do what you need to do.
---
Never hold back
---
I'm almost considering following you just so I wont miss any other future R6 anime characters LMAO good job looks awesome
---
that amazing
---
Dont kid yourself. She hacked your phone as soon as you entered the building, just like everyone else.
---
Aw thank you! I'm stronglyyyy considering making more now
---
Yes you get an abandon sanction.
---
melee weapons are rarely used and the drone isnt impact proof or melee proof, so yeah, balanced op
---
You just have to rush through it at that point
---
i love this art style! thank you so much for making this
---
I'm so glad you like it!
---
There is never anyway Mnk will play console unless they cap frames on pc, stop leaning unless adsing and change the way the keys perform to act like sticks. Rainbow six is a very tactical game it's like getting a guy who's got no legs and getting a guy who has legs and chopping off his to have a fair game. It's not going to happen.
---
You beat me to it
---
it's the same as ranked
---
It was actually an Ash breaching round. I too am fun at parties myself ;)
---
You obviously aren‚Äôt skilled enough so you‚Äôre mad
---
Nah it doesn‚Äôt affect the KD, thankfully. Because i fuck around on it.
---
Nice feet you are aiming at.
---
Valk/Frost/Mira over Lesion or Mozzie? Also, is there any point getting Hibana if I have Therm? They serve more or less the same purpose, don't they?
---
Which leaked image?
---
Become an engineer with a few years in video game design and then move on to the next game that comes out
---
think of the children
---
Oh ok, that's why I play from console so no update
---
M-mouse?!
---
you can't ban someone for leaving the game, that's just a bullshit idea
---
I close all the stuff that I don't need in the background

---
I will baptize you in cum you‚Äôre so pretty
---
I linked it above
---
Yeah, 2 broke 4 a tablet lol. I'm limited in detail work but I've learned a lot and am finally kinda proud of what I can do. Takes forever though
---
Nokk getting a different sight won't change anything especially if that's not an ACOG. She needs to become 3 Speed at least first before getting something like higher damage output or more utility (smoke maybe?)
---
Id say Lesion over my options, but Hibana depends on what you're breaching, you don't need to be right next to your target as your breaching rounds are pellets you shoot
---
Her getting a different gun won't help her either, a new sight would because ubi will never change her loadout let's face it
---
Hibanna is a good operator her Type-89 is great
---
it's a fan edit someone made 4 months ago they since deleted their thread, people think that was actually her original gun.
---
That's not a leaked image. It's an edit by an artist from here. It got reposted bunch of times that some ppl started to think that was an actual image. 
---
The artist also did two other similar artworks with Nokk.
---
The linked image is not a "leak" but an edit done by an artist from here.
---
I'd probably prefer someone with an ambush gadget (ala Kapkan or Frost), I think
---
don't open options
---
just put a delay on joining back ( 3 minutes) so you know your team will have atleast 1 more round to go with 1 man less. that should make you think twice. 
---
Not being able to leave etc is useless! you can always pull the cable or if you indeed need to leave immediately for whatever reason.
---
Refart the game.
---
i buy better computer parts.
---
They put it on the 4-17c for lion, a gun he shares btw and not the gun everybody uses
---
How's Maverick? I know he can burn through reinforced walls, is he any good for a stealthier version of Hibana/Therm (Clearing the point)?
---
You accidentally added the challenge then accidentally won 3 unranked games? xD
---
Mavericks definitely an amazing operator, sneakiest of the hard breachers, and you can create holes in bandit/laid tricked walls, so you won't need a thatcher to EMP
---
god i would this, i bet i would have over 500 teamkills easy.
---
Uuuhh, u can filter the Maps you want in options, at least u can do that on PS4
---
Have you payed attention to the pinned post maybe ?
---
I mean how many play R6 on ps4 ^^
---
More plz
---
This only works on terrorist hunt . And not the PvP modes
---
Its removed from the online playlist along with house rip
---
so you didnt ban maverick or hibana or capitao... but lion???? cav isn't a good defence ban, but you're on def first so i wouldn't ban anyone useful anyway.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I assumed. Again, I have no clue, I only know that PS4 has the biggest playerbase for this game right after Xbox then PC.
---
Get all of the original operator's first as they are super cheap compared to the DLC ops, the standard price for the newer DLC ops (25k) will get you all of the original ops.
---
After that in something of an order but not really:
---
- Buck, he's super simple and has two really powerful guns(most hate the DMRs though) but he also gives you a ton of options through his gadget which can breach soft walls and his frags
---
- Valk, it can take time to learn super good spots to put her cameras but once the cameras are up you are free to gun people and potentially C4 someone. A tip for her cameras is starting off just focus on where you think they will attack the site from and where they will into that room from, put the cameras near there someone coming through a doorway for example isn't going to want to 180 and check for a cam right behind them.
---
- Echo, his drones are mobile cameras and they can disorientate people and knock them off plants
---
- Hibana, you need a 2nd hard breach and Hibana can open stuff from a distance vs Thermite getting close
---
- Lesion, similar idea to valk but with traps once they are placed you are free to gun people and he has a really good one to do it with 
---
- Zofia, she is a 2nd Ash but two of her charges can disorientate people like Echo's Yokai blast
---
- Maestro, first usable LMG on defense which has really good recoil and an ACOG. His turrets are great for info and half decent at hurting people but they can get taken out fast
---
Leaving the list at that, those will give you most of what you need (IMO) without requiring too much of you or knowledge of strats. The rest you can pick up as you learn or just feel like going with.
---
Imagine Mozzie controls Lion's drone 
---
#Look at me . I am Lion now
---
the shitty part is that im brazilian, and hes from uruguay or some other spanish speaking country, i think its better if i post the video here and hope it goes viral
---
specs are the same since 2015, year in which Core 2 Duos worked fine. If they are no longer gonna support 775 they should make an statement and not leave us on a limbo. Fucks sake
---
Holy heccing hell you are right! Twitch and valky elite are banned in PL. My bad, mate.
---
That's just officer jenny ,from Pok√©mon
---
Yes yes she does lmao
---
You can make more quick and precise movements on pc than on a controller, and there is no auto aim.
---
Oh no what have you done
---
If someone leaves after being downed by Caveira the person who left should drop a phone (like when Killed by Dokkaebi) that Cav can pick up for the same effect as her interrogation, minus the interrogation timer for the inconvenience of losing a kill and to punish the quitters team.
---
*Initiate jealousy*
---
Cute, tbh.
---
If you want it to go viral, post it to YouTube AND here.
---
He'll be defamed for it real bad.
---
That‚Äôs strange. I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is then.
---
Can't blame them for wanting the ability to aim lmao.
---
I'd be happy for them to release a list of defaulters here. They deserved to be defamed, those scumbags.
---
Attack : Sledge and Maverick 
---
Defend : Tachanka and Warden (Seriously i main those and i have blitz issues)
---
userflare : kaid icon
---
Yeah just imagine a red coloured frag with white stars.
---
He'll be like **MERRY CHRISTMAS KIDS CYKA BLYAT!n!**
---
Any deliberate interference should be punished. Small or big. DDOS, lack switch, knowingly exploiting wallbreaches, and deleberate modifications of the games code.

That isn't DDOS
---
I could be you are connected to a far away server.

Probably EAs shite servers and networking.
---
hahaha, I couldn't put my finger on it but now I can't unsee it. Just imagining Jackal all wild eyed underneath. I HAVE DEVOLVED.
---
Shes not as bad as i thought initially but she can do some good things such as grapple up onto the roof via skylights which is godly on bank
---
The spelling error in Entertainment. other than that, it had me fooled too.

It should be :
---
"Zr√≥b mi przys≈Çugƒô i odpierdol siƒô"
---
Thanks for giving my eyes cancer! Think before you post!
---
He kinda quirky doe
---
No, can we please stop recommending an operator that's ability is to pick up a gun 
---
The whole idea behind rainbow is that they recruit operators who can bring something important to the team, maverick, hibana and thermite can get through reinforced walls, mute can deny the enemy use of their technology, Caveira is good when it comes to interrogating 
---
Then they recruit this guy who can pick up a gun
---
We need more of this it is to good
---
&gt;to pay for the incompetency of one or two or three morons
---
You do realize that if someones ACCIDENTALLY TKs you, you can vote for "it wasn't intentional", right?    
---
So if your "morons" accidentally tk someone, there is no need to worry, because some people actually have a brain, and realize it wasn't on purpose lol
---
I mean, don't advertise it as "ultra" if you're gonna give me something with very minimal difference in detail. We can forget about the fact that i dont have ela.
---
Couldn't get those earlier this year, ubi removed them and now added them to alpha packs
---
Yeah, I have a smurf account which I could easily play on, just wish I would have known that my stupid weekend ranked run was going to needs me up for so long. The "skill" they use to place you has nothing to do with skill. Having a solid team seems to be far more important. Well , guess time to find a squad to round out the team thanks!
---
Went 3 for 3 in my first couple placement matches and this one was the one that broke the streak. Total game time: 7 minutes.
---
Yh, I don‚Äôt know why
---
It's 100% a glitch, but an amazing one
---
something about this artstyle reminds me of shadman and i don't like that feeling
---
I may or may not have something in the works.
---
No where is safe
---
my personal one and probably the most popular attachment with buck‚Äôs dmr is a muzzle brake since you can spam it a lot and stealth isn‚Äôt really a thing to worry about with buck, since they‚Äôll know you‚Äôre there if you use the underbarrwl shotgun. flashbangs/frags are personal choice but frags are pretty fun and the popular gadget pick for buck. the c8 is a really good AR but the recoil makes it hard to use and the CAMRS is really fun and has great damage per hit. but you can use whatever you want, just my personal opinion
---
The armor plate is definitely op, but the rest of the op seems pretty viable
---
I always thought there was different menu music for attacking/defending on most maps.
---
I wish I could draw.
---
Did you, like, look me up or something? If so that SO CUTE.
---
Tsundere Six Siege
---
Don't waste your time with trap operators like Kaplan or Frost. The higher skill your opponents become, the more useless they are to you and your team. The best operators for you and your team are information operators like Mozzie, Valk, and Maestro. Valk I would say is a good choice because her gadget is easy to use but hard to master. Her gun is also great at training you to aim head level because it does poor per shot damage. Best of luck!
---
If you were getting 300-400 FPS with those settings then I‚Äôm guessing you never turned your render scale up. It defaults to 50, or at least used to, so you‚Äôre gonna get an image that‚Äôs actually a much lower resolution than 2560x1440. Maybe they changed it to default to 100 like it should? Regardless, max settings on 1440p isn‚Äôt going to get 144 with that build.
---
Sure, I'm not, but if the enemy team is butt hurt from me making it a 5v4 in a casual they can go play unranked or ranked
---
Im playing newcomer and casual , won like 10 games and the mission isnt progressing ? Do i need to do something special or what ?
---
This man knows something we don't
---
Yeah grenades dont change mutch. He has to stand still and if you are using grenades then you dont have the smoke as cover. You are begging to be prefired.
---
It honestly looks like it'll be my favorite Elite set. 
---
The uniform, weapon skins, and MVP animation are all top quality.
---
i didnt see shit
---
i would 100000% uninstall out of rage or be fascinated
---
Sorry for the bad quality
---
I know that realy toxic game.  But it's pretty peek.
---
I dont know the name but it was limited from last Halloween event
---
I see what you're saying, and i dont completely disagree.   
---
However ;) - Yes the goal should be to just have fun in the game modes. But as i stated, the way i see it, the game has become drastically easier over the past year, and to me, this takes away some of that fun. To the extend where i now play totally different than i did a year ago, to have fun - not meta wise.  
---
Time played is also a huge factor when debating this. One with 100 hours might see this as an issue, where i with almost 2000 doesnt see it as an issue at all.   
---
I wanna be sure i understand the next part, you'd prefer a system where you have all the ops from start, but have to pay real money for ALL cosmetics? (I know pro league and elite are pay to get atm)
---
Nah, there shouldnt be a reason for me to drone out my own spawn. People like this have no skill and are only able to get there kills through toxic ass spawnpeaks and such.
---
I mean, couldn‚Äôt have given you an accurate answer without looking you up. Sorry, wouldn‚Äôt have joked about your names if I realized you had no sense of humor and would get so sensitive about it.
---
You do realize he was listing reasons why COD MW is bad right?
---
Oil spill
---
Okay
---
Well the way I see it working is that you can toggle the bulletproof mode with right click, but the drone cannot move in this mode
---
Sure
---
Thank you kind stranger
---
Leman Russ has joined Six to crush the Heresy once and for all!!!
---
Yeah I'll give you that. How did you even find that.
---
It was from last haloween. Unfortunately you cant get it anymore.
---
People like you are what's wrong with the game
---
&gt;I thought the season pass unlocks new and old ops?
---
You're mistaken. Read what you bought.
---
See, friend, you're taking 1 sentence too seriously. I can take a joke from someone on the internet. Honestly, I didnt even know you could check my MMR during my placement matches when I'm not even ranked, how do you do that?
---
I assume you‚Äôre talking on R6 Tracker... They definitely don‚Äôt count towards ranked. I‚Äôm not sure if they count towards casual.
---
Extoplas ma it was an exclusive skin for Halloween
---
Nice black ice, bait flex
---
Imagine instead of increasing my own player skill to rank up, I just fuck around and get boosted?
---
Only the ops that come out that year
---
I love it
---
It's casual.... Ranked is made specifically for try Harding and taking it seriously, people like YOU who think everything is serious and has to be taken like your life depends on it are what's WRONG with this game.... There's no penalty for leaving a casual, if you don't like it no one's forcing the enemy team to stay in the game, nor are they being penalized for leaving
---
Ooze i  believe; it was from the halloween event last year
---
Apparently it doesn't.Bruh from where do you think 'season 4' comes
---
Oh KestutisL I played u on a 1v1 once about 2 months ago when I first started and I beat u like 6-5 and I were salty :) we can forget about that, me? I main Finka and Sledge on attack and Ela and Cav...
---
lol all good. my friends got offline
---
Beautiful
---
Yay I also main Finka and I play Lion a bit too, I also really like Alibi but Maestro I don‚Äôt play as much but still like :)
---
Why you smart
---
Reminds me of the netflix series Archer, similar drawing style
---
You crazy bastard. You did it, you actually did it to em
---
Because...?
---
For the ash thing: she's easy to play, easy to win gunfights with, and powerful. Even if I don't main her.
---
Zofia - Very flexible gadget, 3rd most soft destructive capability after sledge and buck. Good with both gadget destruction and helping the push with her grenade launcher.
---
Thermite/Hibana - depends on the map/expected bombsite between these 2. 
---
Smoke - incredibly good operator, gadget is incredible for plant and entry denial. Smg-11 is an incredible gun, and shotgun allows for nigh unlimited destruction of the bombsite.
---
Nokk
---
Nice to see a fellow sledge main

---
Don't expect new weapons this year man...
---
I feel like I'm missing something here... what's happened? What's DDOS?
---
I always switch ops cause I can't imagine the same ops every time. It would make the game boring for me.
---
I come to reddit to say something about this its happening 5-6 times a day for me I‚Äôve got multiple abandon sanctions lost a couple ranked matches bc of it this game is turning into trash
---
names are prvxke, Just2godlyyyyyyy, J\_-\_diamond, Icecoldbuttfux69 and me\_no\_like\_peas

Give em Cav pistols make em 2 speed cos no primary u gotta be able to take hits.

Praise be to the great one with artistic talents!

You were right. He was trying to say that Blackbeard needs a need.
---
Brightness -9999999999
---
Me and my friends had that problem last night too, but after like an hour or two it just stopped but I would love for it to get fixed.
---
Everything looks AMAZING. Its honestly the single best MVP animation so far, in my opinion, even better than glaz's. The only thing i kinda dont like much is the blonde hair. Cause of zofia and all i always imagine her as a brunette, i think it makes more sense and would look better with the outfit, but still, best elite yet.
---
It's from Velvet shell.
---
You would have to give him gifts to gain his favor. 
---
"Oh my gosh recruit, you didn't have to get me a new tripod for my mounted lmg. That's so kind of you!"

You don‚Äôt complete me.
---
TBF though, you could under-pack each clip. Not sure why anyone would do this if they had multiple clips, but it's possible.
---
U only hit like twice
---
Restart your game
---
Wait wait wait
---
I'm gonna need the sos boss.
---
For research purposes of course. 
---
*Sweats profusely*
---
Agreed 100%.
---
It's literally nonstop and the game is unplayable for me atm
---
Looks stupid with the normal one
---
It's not turning into trash, you cant say that a game is bad because of something they may not be able to control.  It could completely be on PlayStation's side as well. This just started happening to me, so I wouldn't call it trash just yet, maybe in like 6 months if the problem is still happening then maybe.
---
They said they will fix that in an upcoming patch update,they just need a confirmed release date from sony and microsoft tho
---
I think this is actually the most common opinion. I personally don‚Äôt care whether guns are new or reused as long as they‚Äôre well balanced with the operator that has them. It‚Äôs actually kinda nice to already have some cool skins for their guns when an op first comes out.
---
Let's hope it'll be be fixed for me soon aswell
---
I did it last night but I canceled it in the middle of the uninstallation and now I don't see it on the uninstall option. But I do see a KB4514359, should I uninstall that?
---
Twitch @BaitedTv and i gotchu wit da youtube

Tnx c:
---
Why do you think it should affect ranked k/d? You are not risking the mmr since it isn't ranked, but you believe it should affect the k/d for ranked?
---
You used his ability
---
I would actually use that lol
---
People are total asshats unfortunately, I haven't had as much of a problem on pc as I did on ps4 but I appreciate that's hardly a viable solution for everyone

Image has been saved to gallery
---
This image is uploaded like once per hour, why are you people doing this to me?
---
So Jackal with an M50 mask? Not a fan of his "design" but the gadget idea is kinda cool. Probably should make it so that the drone can't move when it's in its bulletproof state though.
---
What have you brought upon this sacred land
---
I don't either, but I don't get SP'd either cause unlike most people, I don't bullheadedly rush towards the building.
---
Its decent
---
Thanks guys, this‚Äôll give me some more confidence in using Vigil, much appreciated.
---
*no u did*
---
what rank are these players?
---
Lol okay
---
i can send you a clip of yesterday, i got almost got killed because the scorpion jumped straight to the left OUT OF NOWHERE, its just so random ): thats why i main vigil
---
Did you get the chance to shoot them in full auto? How?
---
What was it spiking to?
---
Take the sock off your head
---
The recoil isn't random it's a set recoil, I would suggest going into t hunt and just letting the hostage die to focus on kills. Trying to get kills from different ranges in t-hunt helps a lot when learning the recoil.
---
lol nice caption
---
Don't rush with her, clear levels, find the Cav or vigil. Help protect fuze, or thermite, like the idea that she has to be like a ash or iq is laughable. Im not gonna change your mind, but the second they improve her(say a better weapon) you will be preaching the other way
---
T-hunt is pretty look laggy because of how many terrorists there are
---
Yeah but it wouldnt be the first time Ubi has a spelling error on their notes.

Why is he saying ze? He‚Äôs British not German

Not that I'm aware of, this is a fairly old video I had recorded tbh, that might be why it looks different

Do you hear bagpipes when ever you rush with buck, do you hit shit with a hammer and can surprise enemies with it, can you yell *SCOTLAND FOREVER* while killing a down cav?

I've never seen those icons though for the fire and smoke bolt

His smg or his shotgun? I am new to rainbow, but I played his smg for a while and thought it wasn‚Äôt that great so I went his shotgun and did a lot better.
---
I also posted to this subreddit with the accidental date reveal screenshot. u/Ali_khas. I just got ignored but you got harassed, so I feel for you. 
---
I am genuinely curious how this game will be received. Most people I have seen comment on the game are already angry about it. They seem to feel entitled to it being included in R6S. Mere mentions of Quarantine earn you nasty comments.
---
What a Clusterfuck

Smoke with a nitro. An era long past.

Huh maybe I just didn‚Äôt give it enough of a chance. But yeah after I switched to the shotgun I was getting about double the kills I used to. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I suck and shotguns are easier.

At least there is Thick Braid in alpha packs. And she probably won't have facepaint on the next headgears so they can also release them in China

Is it also if i kill a mate?

Yeah.

Blitz is adorable

Obutu has already leaked those weeks ago.

Most likely Buck and Capitao next season so we have 13 attacker elites by the end of this year and 13 defenders.
---
Not to forget to mention that Hibana elite was the only attacker elite so far this year as the rest were Bandit,Lesion,Smoke,Mira and soon Ela(all in that order).

Me too.

Ubi, upcoming community challenge / custom event skin?

Huh, never tried a sausage rush. Going to have to give it a shot.

there's no fix. We just have to wait for Ubi to fix whatever went wrong

3 things are certain in life. Those being death, taxes, and people still mourning the lost of jaeger‚Äôs acog.
---
-The ranch
---
Depends on what streamers you are talking about. King George is ex-pro, macie jay has insane ingame knowledge, just9n is ex csgo pro, beaulo is now pro etc etc. Most of the time they play in 5 stacks so its much easier. Plus because of the elo now not starting at 2500 they can get diamond in there placements(?) I think if they win every game.
---
Royal skin for the GIGN shotgun
---
he is underpowered but if ubi buffs his gadget even by 1 hp, he would be op.
---
Ying is more of a fragger and is used for rushing objectives while Nomad is used more to secure a certain area using her air jabs
---
A man of culture I see
---
Nomad, arguably better gadget, benefits the team as area control. Easily one of the best attackers
---
Overwhelmingly so, no doubt. Giving her a long-range would essentially make her playstyle unpunishable as currently the need to get close is her only real drawback.
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Any luck?
---
I did the event but i didnt get the pack? is this just a glitch
---
I ranked = my fat ass fingers typing unranked
---
Season pass skins are always limited. You usually only have a chance to get them if you buy the current season skin before march so for the Y5 skin you would have to buy it before March 2020

Ubi wanted her face paint gone so they could sell the game in China - most people got angry that removing the paint would *ruin* Caveiras *M.O*. So, they made her hot.. now people are actually calling for the paint to be removed on future headgear - way beyond simply accepting it. 
---
I must say it's very clever. They've played the community like a damn fiddle. They say sex sells, and there's no better place for that method than a game filled with young men now dying for each new operator to be *dummy thicc*. I'm probably gonna sound like an ancient dick here but this game started off as a near-authentic tactical shooter, now we have people asking for sexy operators.  
---
Bottom line, Ubi doesn't have the fuck you over to get what they want - they let you decide that you want it.
---
No, that's called potato aim
---
i cant wait for cavs elite. i don‚Äôt play cav, but i am tired of having the same scary brazillian woman stabbing me in the neck.

I thought that was elite Mira..

I wanna give you gold but I'm poor

GSG 9 have all elites:(
---
if there was new guns I would like this idea
---
I personally prefer vertical play with sledge. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I find breaking floors with sledge to be much more consistent (sometimes skeleton key doesn‚Äôt break through the entire floor and only breaks the first layer) but buck is much faster and can play vertically from below as well. Both are great ops and their pros/cons are nicely balanced.
---
Is that challenge still going on?

Clever, but idiot on the defender that swats at the drone.

I think so

Bullets are bullets my guy, and whether you have 21 or 150 doesn‚Äôt matter, if you know how to use the thing, it‚Äôs easy mode. Especially with fire rate of Hibana‚Äôs gun
---
It would be easier to predict their movements with quicker scans, 1 will tell you the room their in and then the next will tell you the direction they're travelling and if needed the third will tell you if they committed to that direction.
---
I did the same thing but I think I must have played 7 in total before I figured it out...
---
Oh I never saw that, I saw something where it said noon was getting mp7 and warden was getting p90, was that something new I didn‚Äôt see or was that before they reused old guns
---
Well now I fell stupid don‚Äôt I

Lesion‚Äôs SMG because it makes me feel like a dick for using it and ash‚Äôs r4c (unless the enemy team is a 4 or 5 stack and going hella try hard)

Gotta say im loving the 4k quality Maverick logos too.

Now that makes more sense

Yeah pretty much. Check his elite animation.

Nani?

Nah. I just play with whatever feels fun at the moment. I think something being ‚Äútoo good‚Äù is a debatable thing. The skill level of the player is a factor and a primary one at that.

Unranked is a failing playlist, that's why Ubisoft offered an alpha pack challenge just to get people in there a mere week after it's introduction. Most people who want to play seriously but not in ranked are still going to Casual. If they are more competitive than the casuals they'll clean house there, not to mention Casual is faster and far less penalizing, so Unranked isn't seeming to appeal to the people it was made for. A pity really I thought it was a good idea.
---
Don‚Äôt be a quitter. Fight for the win
---
Yea but is balanced out by the fact an ash or J√§ger kill you easily if you miss your first shot
---
Wtf is that reflex scope ew
---
The ine on the right looks like mira elite skin tbh
---
Bro me and Cav went back and [READ THE BIBLE] all night.

Just got the Alpha Pack Legendary for her (Thick Braid) and Although I kinda with it did have the paint for the spook girl look, it looks great.

Woah woah woah. Missing shots? Yeah that ain‚Äôt me chief ive got 100% accuracy.

ohhh, that was a fan suggestion, people suggested giving warden the p90 because the secret service actually uses p90s. the fmj or fmg is ass so people wanted nook to have the mp7, but the devs said they gave them their specific weapons for balancing

---
People are always asking for female operator faces to be *fixed*. Most fixes are to faces which look alright but not *pretty*. Nothing wrong with those changes but when this game started off, or even when it had its 2nd coming, people cared more about how the game played than how it looked. This isn't so much of an issue, rather its something that's just happened. Fixes are unanimously good. The game is constantly changing to suit the market, when looking back though you see that somewhere along the lines cosmetics really took the spotlight.
---
Tachankway
---
Not really impractical. Its mainly just preference and head position. For example acog is nice to be close to eye bechause otherwise you cant see shit trough it due to magnification but in red dot its does not matter as much its mainly just preference and how outside shape distracts you.
---
cough cough, ash jaeger acog, cough cough

That makes sense

You can‚Äôt mix and match elite skin parts so no, I‚Äôll never buy an elite skin.

That's one of the scummiest things I've seen in this game. And OF COURSE it's a bandit doing it.
---
Yeah. There is a surprising difference between early and late Fast and Furious Movies. Old ones are cool. But the later ones are good for when you are bored on the weekends and just want to watch a nonsense action movie.
---
Consider this. I‚Äôm playing, get killed, don‚Äôt want the ban, reset my internet

Restart your game and it should be there

No fuck no it‚Äôs one of the best things to happen to it

Didn't he just get a buff to his speed?
---
No. Magpul made an experimental folding carbine. It was designed for a Glock pistol, as is the Roni.

Yeah that seems like the general trend of basically any movie. Like Pirates of the Caribbean.

For John Wick the first movie has an AMAZING story that the others seem stale, however the realistic gun-play is awesome.

Hi, since I started playing again I lost connection to the game 80% of the time cause of it I can't play ranked or unranked as I get banned, as you can see in the video no lag and my ping is really low. can anyone help?

It really does
---
Sure you on the right playlist?

Glad I ban that piece of shit every chance I get in ranked

Cool

Why are you playing without points

IQ Elite is a Goddess
---
IKR! He looks so off putting

I don't think he plays stretched 4:3

So it is part of the pc as well cause I thought it was localized to the consoles and I'm not seeing any ping spikes?
---
Ranked only allows players within 1000 MMR gap to queue in together. New season. 
---
Now there will be more throwers in the lower end so they can just smurf.  I‚Äôll take that over a stack of Diamonds and and 2 Coppers though. 
---
People will make new accounts, solo queue in with cheats, then sell the diamond accounts....
---
I no longer wanna interrogate them :(
---
Yeah. It's the curse of any movie franchise. If it lasts too long, it will eventually just go to shit. John Wick will remain John Wick as long as they try their hardest to keep their feet grounded in reality. The second Wick fails to show him reloading constantly and accurate weapon mechanics is the day Wick loses one of the things that made the John Wick series so great. 
---
Pirates made the mistake of going past 3. After that the movies were solely about Jack Sparrow. While I love the character, he isn't really a character that should have primary focus in a movie.
---
Glaz's flip sight. Oh wait......

I am not an expert, so better ask UbiSupport. However, it might be DDOD or your firewall that blocks TCP/Ip ubi use.

 console is going to be pretty clean for a while until a new exploit is found or they develope a way to detect M&amp;KB. Pc will continue to see ban waves as more exploits, third party programs, and boosters are detected.

That's Mira

How the fuck haven‚Äôt they fixed spawn peeking yet. Keep the red up for like 15 seconds, that‚Äôs it. It completely ruins the spirit of the game

Needs to be MGS related. They paid homage to Snake in Ghost Recon lately.

Do you mean how the anzac forces where during ww1 and 2

Sameeeeee!

Most shotguns Benefit from aiming down sights, this is only useful if your firing from medium+ range as for sone reason the bullet spread is smaller when ads, but if your close range, just hipfire, it only takes like 2-3 projectiles to kill someone within 2 metres and you fire like 8 or something depending on the choice of shotgun
---
Yeah it's also good. I switch back and forth
---
1) outback 
---
2) kafe
---
3) Oregon 
---
4) border
---
5) bank

6) coastline
---
7) Consulate
---
8) Chalet
---
9) Clubhouse
---
10) Villa 
---
11) kanal (but mostly because I‚Äôve barely played it) 
---
12) skyscraper
---
The only map in the ranked pool that I actually dislike would be skyscraper, everything else is not bad to great in my opinion.
---
Am I the only one that saw ‚ÄúDSI‚Äù and thought of the old Nintendo DS
---
I think all they need to do is remove some of the runout spots. I love skyscraper because of doing runout but I feel bad every time because there is literally nothing they can do about a runout from bathroom if no one is paying attention to it.
---
Nope, no cross platform at all
---
The map rotation has ruined this game. 99% of the player base are not pros so why shape the whole game around this 1%
---
They better patch that or that could get annoying
---
They found where j√§ger's acog is contained
---
Where did u find cavs face? I cant find it online
---
Hadn't played in two days due to shit map rotation and ddos, first two games in a row skyscraper.

Then you should never que for games especially ranked in 1st place or atleast make sure that you have good connection b4 queing

squishy and gimmick are better imo

Yeah I do it‚Äôs just it‚Äôs getting upgraded where I live and it occasionally cuts out.

Play ranked, get rekt by spawnpeaks and crazy angles, learn said spawnpeaks and crazy angles to use/ avoid being killed by them, that‚Äôs for game sense though, for aiming practice single fire headshot on terrorist hunt
---
It‚Äòs just you.
---
Way more skill than the current leaning system though
---
Hate to tell you even with me and most pros who are unlucky miss shots even if it was very close that‚Äôs how the game has been for awhile
---
And here I thought it was radioactive Monty so enemies couldn't rush you

I mean... it blocks a little more of the screen? Idk hipfore is just better for the most part. The only shotguns that dont benefit are the slug firing ones like the BOSG and TCSG

Here's a link to sudaesaeng-r's version of the cute IQ drawing that OP ripped off [https://sudaesaeng-r.tumblr.com/post/174531459828/„Öá„ÖÖ„Öá-„Öá„ÖÅ„Öá-„Öá-„Öá](https://sudaesaeng-r.tumblr.com/post/174531459828/%E3%85%87%E3%85%85%E3%85%87-%E3%85%87%E3%85%81%E3%85%87-%E3%85%87-%E3%85%87)

Year 5 season 1 skyscraper rework?
---
Facts
---
Can I have the link as well?
---
Glaz is the only "Sniper" OP, but there are other ops with DMRs, Buck, Dokkeabi, Twitch, Lion, Blackbeard.
---
yeah but i got disconnected for nothing
---
Agreed
---
There is, not rush out into the open at the start of the round lol.
---
There‚Äôs a way to say what you just said without sounding like a condescending asshole
---
I love the blitz one
---
It's interesting seeing you put outback as number 1, which I think is one of the weaker maps and chalet above both clubhouse and villa (two maps I really love) 
---
But I definitely agree skyscraper is terrible, chalet I'm mixed on but the rest I think are at least decent 
---
I also didn't know where to put kanal because it's still new
---
It's just a trash map.
---
happens all the time where it says my ethernet cables aren‚Äôt connected. I don‚Äôt even use ethernet cables
---
Yeah Castle on Clubhouse is underrated, well really he‚Äôs underrated overall.
---
I don‚Äôt do it at the start of the round. I wait until people are outside BBQ
---
is that the name or is it short for something
---
It‚Äôs true what people say about this subreddit, people are just smug assholes lmao
---
cheers man
---
Also yes. This was my epic pack.
---
This happens with all placeable gadgets when they are too close to the wall.
---
Na, delete it lol.
---
Most important thing to remember: recruit rushes rely solely on pure, unbridled wrath and adrenaline.
---
But in all seriousness, one big thing to get down is how to move around the map and peek angles. Many new players either a) sprint far too often or b) crouch walk far too often, and you have to find a balance. When sprinting you're incredibly vulnerable  because it takes a moment to be able to shoot again and you easily be caught with your pants down. On the other side of the coin, if you're constantly crouch walking/jogging you'll find yourself in situations where your team has already pushed into obj and they basically were in a 4v5 fight. Now, many people like to say that siege is "all aim no brain" (I personally disagree), but learning what sightlines are typically held by defenders and remembering to keep your crosshair at head level is paramount. Establishing good habits early on will set you leagues above other players from the get go, and the rest will eventually come with just putting in hours and gaining experience.
---
Do I have to tell you or did you learn already
---
Yeah for a while I was convinced it was just a meme because in slightly less than 1000 hours I've never been kicked for not clutching. I've heard people *say* it but they never actually initiated a kick, they were just joking around.
---
Aiming down sights does slightly tighten the spread of shotguns in Siege.
---
I actually really like the new map rotation, instead of 5 bad maps there are only 2, skyscraper and chalet
---
There are only two things I hate in this world, people who are in tolerant of other peoples culture, and the Dutch.
---
I feel like Ubi finally realized the the current legendarys SUCKED so the added new ones but idk
---
It still counts as abandonment to the game sometimes when I play late at night my internet will crash and I get banned because of it. For some reason the game counts it as leaving and of course i doubt Ubi will fix it.
---
Thats a bit gay
---
There was a reason they got nerfed it would take 3-4 shots from a assault rifle even with the ak12 but they could be a bit harder to see that would be a decent buff for her
---
I feel like Ubi realized the the current skins for legendary sucked so the added new ones but idk
---
Recruit takes no prisoners
---
What what is this
---
I think there are probably people in between, which dont like him that much but dont hate him
---
I see its black ice lol
---
Mozzie was originally going to have impact nades, the proximity mine is the new audio alarm.
---
G2 strats
---
I got a skin for the m870 that was worth less than 2.5k renown. I thought it was a guaranteed black ice.
---
More reason to hate Skyscraper. Thanks!
---
All of these look really good but my girl twitch looking fine
---
They actually do, they have access to an unlimited amount of exo-thermic charges,breach charges, c4,barbed wire,deployable shields, flash grenades, and smokes depending on what terrorist hunt mode you pick, and don‚Äôt forget about the shields.
---
Think you or they fucking up the servers.
---
There were data mined files about a new pro league skin for the mp7 and a new pro league helmet for thermite. Ill find a link to the source and get back to you in a minutes.
---
Lesion if your good at headshots and rook or mira
---
No we don't. Check the link. That does not say June 11th.
---
nah man, it happens
---
tk'ing is never the answer
---
I don't play rank
---
That's the vector
---
She looks like tatsumaki
---
They implemented squad rff with this week's patch
---
No the real ranked is when the server gets ddosed üëåüèª
---
I read the title and was like "Who could ever love the scorpion?"
---
How would it be fun? It‚Äôs a shit gun on a 1 speed op it‚Äôs the most useless thing ever
---
Idk why they just trying to kill you, on pc everyone is bs and hide somewhere and wait for you to plant

Some ctus train their operators to keep their empty magazines? You take one out and put the empty one back in the pouch.

Try the power button

I find it very fun with vigil so why not mira
---
No,Lorem Ipsum
---
It's not meant to be good. It's meant to be fun which it is
---
RIP.
---
Hate getting legendary dupes
---
Because it‚Äôs a shit gun on a 1 speed who normally anchors ?!?!
---
In this situation, you sound like the most toxic person.
---
Aa
---
What level
---
Nice. She's still a bitch tho
---
looks like mira elite
---
Thank you for the line comparison. I‚Äôm wondering about the IQ one as well since Jager and Blitz are 100% same.
---
Castle elite skin
---
i've been ootl for a while. what happened to kronovi?
---
Or how good are you
---
Am I really seeing this black ice on a shield
---
I mean Twitch is part of the GIGN but Doc &amp; Rook drop their empty mag when using the MP5, so nah.
---
Moved over to Rogue afaik.
---
i have bloom off and valk cams are obvious as hell
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter dude. It‚Äôs happening on all platforms
---
The game should not be catered around fun it‚Äôs a competitive game so it should be balanced and treated as one. And not just add something for shits and giggles
---
Try it, you can find them at gamestop for cheap. They really improve your game skills
---

---
Lesion
---
Execute order 66
---
Not that bad
---
Yep lol
---
L I O N &lt; 3
---
Yea sadly it‚Äôs happening on all systems
---
True that.
---
I am proud of you üëç
---
Yeah but just for fun like on casual or something.
---
I got the same skin yesterday, never seen it.
---
K/D doesn't show much in terms of skill anyway.  Don't let stupid numbers or idiots that comment on it determine your skill level....
---
But at the same point in time, her ability makes her almost as quiet as Caviera, but unlike Vigil, you get no camera feedback outside of Yokai and Mozzie cams.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Her weak weapon means she always has to flank and get close, which is what she's supposed to do. A good rifle would make her able to be practically anywhere and she'd be a nightmare, easily taking down enemies from a safe distance, then disappearing and being practically impossible to find.
---
I personally think she should've gotten the K1A, but not giving her a rifle, especially an ACOG, makes sense IMO.
---
There is no but only claymore roomba
---
O H
---
I play on PS4 it has happened to me 3 times so far this season. I‚Äôm in plat 2 which is why it‚Äôs more rampant because they are close to diamond
---
Ok my phone boutta die, in level 80 something. My in game name is Sunscreen_boi add me and i will play in like an hour or so
---
Seems to me like you can't do without so I don't think they improve that much
---
Do what ever  you want man your clearly not seeing what I‚Äôm texting
---
I hate that stabby boi
---
It's a one shot gun for defenders. No other gun is like that.
---
What cunts
---
Im a pepega dw
---
You can say that again
---
MIRA
---
yep. i dont even like that skin, it's pretty ugly
---
Praise big boy
---
Holy shit
