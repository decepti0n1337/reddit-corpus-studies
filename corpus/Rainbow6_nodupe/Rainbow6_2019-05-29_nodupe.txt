Just grind thunt as boring as it can be until you’re comfortable enough to start playing games.

That for sure is the one positive ill give IQ anyday. Maybe I dont play against very smart valks, cause even though im not IQ I can almost always spot cameras. (Im like the designated camera guy on my team, for whatever reason) but SOMETIMES I cant spot it and IQ is pretty useful THEN. Otherwise IQ cant do anything for me I cant do a few seconds slower.
---
*clunk clunk clunk clunk*
---
That's awesome
---
If you're the one who made this and have a laser cutter, I will buy one from you if you make a second one
---
Funny you say that because Pro League told them not to take the Nades away and they did it anyway. Goes to show they don’t just listen to pro league.
---
Why cover wins and loses?
---
You Know claymores were also removed because it allowed attackers to move around in the drone phase right? That allowed hackers to spawn in, move around with a claymore, vault, teleport to the obj and kill everyone before the round even starts... It's not just iq everyone with a claymore could do it.
---
neither is twitch. she has two drones that trade destroying gadgets on 5 charges for literally not jumping. she just so happens to have the 3rd best AR in the game..
---
YOU HIT HIS HELMET
---
Dont say you werent lagging if you wont show the whole screen
---
#87
---
That drop shot on #4
---
Heres the problem: ANY OP can do that. Maybe not as fast as IQ but I still dont see why that occasional boost is worth not taking a better op over her.
---
outperforms every AR that isn't Fuze's, you mean?
---
Best comment I could have hoped for.
---
nvm the TK ... that's a nice spot for cams dude
---
This was done with a laser cutter right? I got my science teacher last year to do one of Sledge. Let's just say it didn't end well.
---
So other people dont be toxic for my wins/losses
---
Maybe it’s because you play on Xbox
---
You can clearly see if I was lagging the person grappled on the building would’ve been lagging on my screen too.
---
INCOMING COMMENTS about how you still lagged, point of the acog wasnt on the head, bucks recoil is ass,or how you're just ass
---
Just saying, based on other comments here. This seems to be a low IQ post.......... I'll see myself out.
---
Typical troll banking on a mis-said word. Im sure you feel victorious now. Its not like you didnt know what I was talking about. Stop feeling big.
---
You understand that the end goal of balancing is to make EVERYTHING as meta as possible.... Ubisoft is attempting to raise the pickrate of all the operators in the long run... The goal is to keep the trend up so that one day Tachanka might actually BE meta, but your argument seems to just want to toss him to the hounds, which defeats any common sense ideology of balancing..............
---
No, people cannot clearly see.
---
If you look were I'm aiming it was a head shot, but head shots are broken
---
And yet ive never had any problem doing all that as any other op.
---
Thanks man
---
*thunk thunk thunk thunk thunk*
---
I have a pc account but i dont have a pc lmao. Still not giving it for free
---
Ahh yes.. 2019 memes where people barely even try
---
it's just facts, girls don't care that we're good at video games
---
Curb your Rainbow 6
---
Well it’s not random, there’s a 1/50 chance you get it.  There’s concrete odds
---
Who the hell would give some random ass person their account.
---
No
---
No dude rank is copper-diamond you said 166 that would be clearance level
---
right, because every keyboard warrior is an expert in balancing.....
---
Where can I get my free 600 r6 credits then since I had this game since December of 2014?
---
Convenient zoom in which cuts out where the symbols show when you’re lagging, the zoom was probably unnecessary
---
Well you cut off the clip so you cant really tell
---
*heavy breathing*
---
[deleted]
---
Im gold, idk why assuming im bronze means i cant have an opinion or something anyway. And I could care less if IQ counter my mains? Who cares? I adore challenge and counters, IQ does nothing against me or when I play as her. I can do anything she can do just fine as any other op, ive yet to have a problem.
---
Perfection in numerical form.
---
AHHHH
---
👌
---
I only ever saw reports that it was an IQ problem so.
---
Sexy
---
idk why people cry about bugs, then immediately after the offending item is removed people complain about it being gone. It's like an abusive relationship
---
I didn’t realize you had a reddit account, huh
---
Thanks brother
---
This guy also has a laser sight equipped, which reduces spread on shotguns and tightens the reticle
---
I have another app that I usually use for stats but I’m gonna switch to urs to show some support Chief 😎
---
Ooh fuck
---
Big. Deal. You knew I meant clearance level. My bad siege is the one game with a proprietary name for "level" it dosent matter.
---
This is some big dick energy right here
---
I have mixed feelings of anger and fear
---
Uh, nah man. It's because of your laser sight
---
P good, i like it
---
Shotguns would be entirely useless if they were any less precise than it is today on PC
---

---
The guns on console and PC are both different in a lot of ways to compensate for the fact that you can't aim as well on console compared to PC
---
One example is a reduction in vertical recoil on console compared to PC since it's harder to recoil control precisely
---
THEY'VE EVOLVED
---
You don’t know what you got till it’s gone lol
---
I did not know that laser sights do this. I’m pretty sure they don’t on console.
---
Not the outbreak Ash
---
Jager because of his helmet
---
I’ve been grinding T hunt a lot trying to get the maps down, the only map I feel good about is House so far
---
Ying just got nerfed reducing her utility as a easy planter. 
---
No matter your aim recoil is hard to control. Insaine recoil sucks as you have to deal with different types of recoil than everyone else. Everyone else has sort of similar recoil, so having awful recoil sucks unless you only play buck, and still you also have to play defense. If he was a B, he would be a very low B.
---
Glaz is not only getting nerfed but, as I said, he only averages about 1 kill a game in raked per round. He does have good fragging capability, however in the higher ranks people learn to avoid doorways that have smoke. He has no full auto so he can’t spray, you have one shot while they are still in that position while if you had full output you could get about 6 shots before they move enough.
---
Fire rate, plus I want a sweet beard :)
---
Yes it’s normal. It’s because of the Season Pass
---
there’s a bunch of videos on Youtube of this so, yes.
---
Why does he want your backpack?
---
Lol
---
Doubt it because spawn peeking is not a problem in this game.
---
Lol only if trading was a thing 🤔
---
Nice
---
What if you wanted to spawn
---
peek, but god said:
---
Yeah sure! I'm running a 4 man for ranked right now! Got space for one. I'll add you tomorrow. Irish time zone!
---
I mean I do both depending on what room. You also need to learn the maps. I think somebody else said that too. Also you don’t HAVE to anchor but it’s highly suggested depending on what room. Just however fits you and your play style and if you’re good at it. Also find somebody to main so you don’t get off track by using new ops and dying a lot:
---
Yes
---
Yeah I haven't been playing for too long and its a joke me and my friends have when they asked me if I learned the maps and I was like "I know house" so now every time we go to house they go "dude you know this map!"
---
Question, when has that statement ever crossed your mind before this post?
---
*sith screeching*
---
When a game becomes mainstream, it gets toxic.
---
LoL is toxic.
---
Siege is toxic.
---
CS:GO at lower ranks is very toxic, at high ranks they don’t care as much.
---
I played a match recently with *4 RECRUITS*
---
Imagine my astonishment when the match suddenly became a 1v5 ft. Me.
---
Fuse is so dumb, the hostage is right there just kill him already
---
thats a rip from me
---
lesion finally threw out his garbage after having his popsicle. Good boy.
---
Yes dbl did it
---
Looks cool - can someone post the Jaeger Headgear in this bundle?
---
You should really supply this to uplay support on there website not here. Also I think this breaks the subs rules for witch hunting.
---
I submitted a ticket
---
definitely
---
Love that your name is an acronym.
---
I don't have any season pass, i bought the game 3 days ago...
---
I’ve come to really enjoy using Maverick and Lion and Thermite  on attack; Vigil and Alibi on defense. I just can’t really seem to stick with one over the other honestly because idk how good each of them are compared to the others
---
How?
---
So you see that drone? And you see the car battery he’s sitting on? He supposed to be getting zapped outta here.
---
It was horribly attacker favoured and only the basement was sorta decent. There is a reason it was removed from Pro League and Ranked ages ago.
---
House seems to be the beginner map huh 😂😂
---
This makes me want to go back and play siege. I could always accept being outshot, but dammit I loved/hated blitz’s flash shield.
---
Take your time aiming. You literally only need 1 bullet
---
Cursed Image
---
There's still the back
---
Yes and when you hover over it his glasses and watch should activate
---
The second of the round of this game a guy blew two of us up and got kicked for tk, that’s why there’s one death .
---
Yeah
---
An idiot
---
No man it’s out of order it needs to be 6969
---
Had that same experience a few times in the last week.  Seriously broken
---
Soo...they can keep adding cosmetics, but cited data limits as to a reason Nook and Warden have shit load outs. Sure
---
*m870's in confusion*
---
I try to reload whenever I’m safe
---
Fuck same, and that’s all I have
---
This changed my reddit experience for the better. 
---
Thank you.
---
Gsh pleb
---
What edition of the game did you get
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I’m pretty sure everyone got the Ash Elite if they participated in the outbreak event
---
Villa is one of the best maps right now from a competitive standpoint, ofc people at low ranks will nto like it because it requires lots of team coordination. That's why people like oregon and house, since they don't require much communication compared to bank or villa.
---
Idk where you got that bank has been one of the worst maps since the beginning. It has 3-4 viable sites (none of the maps you sited do), requires lots of coordination and has one of the highest skillcaps as a map. High level players will tell you the same thing.
---
Because.... The people in ranked are better than the people in casual?
---
how do i get those cool icons by my name
---
It was 40$
---
Look at which operators get picked on certain objectives, some operators are a must have on particular objectives, and some are pretty much useless.
---
Mira is an example that comes to mind, some objectives don't give her gadget much utility but some of them she's great.
---
If you have the time there are heaps of videos on Youtube that give you a rundown of each operator and what maps/objectives they're most useful on.
---
Took me longer than I'm proud of to realize that it doesn't have a Knife attached as a bayonet.
---
Nah they all want that top place for that good good elite scene
---
"The council will decide your fate"
---
This vid should have ended with you landing on a door mat... just for the lols...
---
That nade did work tho
---
First time I’ve heard them called fat-backs.  We just called them CRTs
---
Maybe 
---
1+ deployable sheild
---
360° turret rotation
---
A 1.5 to 1.75 red dot scope on turret
---
I dont think that they can fully make Tachnka pro league viable without him being completely overpowered in copper to silver if not gold.
---
Edit: im also a console player so that might effect how he plays
---
Don't tell Ubi :O
---
Best cosplay. The right one is the cosplay right?
---
That line work is trash.
---
It's hard being new 😂
---
Blackbeard should have like 3 parts
---
really? I constantly see a mute/kaid combo
---
I mean I’ve already seen that happen in the live build. Not that exact situation but I have been shot through open walls that don’t look open on my end.
---
Ha,  yeah he had the game for less than 12 hours.   I told him we kind of put the mirror on the opposite side 😬
---
I'm so sad I have to deploy a shield in front of my eyes.
---
I play on ps4 maybe thats why?
---
"Yes I'm vegan. Yes I eat meat. We exist"
---
I wouldn’t say I’m not experienced at all. I have about 1000 hours and I’m plat 3 but I rarely play chalet in ranked and when I do bar has never been picked. How does that disqualify me from being an experienced player?
---
People who were on an airplane when Thanos snapped coming back in 2023
---
Yeah sick bro fucking awesome bro wow what a mad cunt broooooo. Losers like you are the reason I don't play this shit anymore.
---
Tachanka face reveal confirmed?
---
Also someone better stop rook from shooting the hostage
---
If u used cargo shorts it would have been a 10
---
oh
---
😂
---
trigger discipline...
---
Please read (currently) bottom comment.
---
It’s kinda racist
---
Good effort but.... the shorts just aren't "dad" enough.
---
The sight of this gives me PTSD
---
I'll upvote so hopefully you'll see other opinions but honestly it doesn't. It was originally super good and the Nerf put it in a good place. It has nice damage and rate of fire and honestly the recoil isn't that bad so I think it's fine where it is. I'd love to hear other people's opinions though?
---
M A X I M U M   O V E R D R I V E
---
Generally when people say they like something that was just taken away, they don't like that the person just took it away from them...
---
Nah I gotta go with ma boi Ned flanders
---
I also think the mp5k needs a recoil buff
---
No, him
---
You can though, don't toss it down until the Thatcher is over because most Thatcher's don't chain reaction their emp's.
---
Which one is that again
---
me
---
It's specifically attached to the game mode "Casual"
---
Yeah. That too😂
---
Xbox has a built in recording feature and you can download via xboxlips dot com my guy
---
More cargo short
---
The resolution on that texture though is so satisfying.
---
Anyone who bought the game before that update came out.
---
Sometimes, they're 36 and sad that the only thing they derive enjoyment from anymore is spending hours practicing a video game and then being toxic at those same kids.
---
This made me cringe hard
---
Thank you
---
Yep hopefully that works
---
What have you done? Do you know what this means? (Other generic surprised line)
---
You probably never alt+f4’d faster
---
Is the Claymore bug is just on IQ? If so, can't we just swap it out for some other consumable instead? Take smokes from Blitz and swap them with IQ or something like that.
---
Don't join parties people can DDoS you from parties on Xbox by pulling your IP
---
That guy dabbing on the right tho
---
Ok ya thanks I did see that with Lion and Finka and if I have to wait until they all drop then oh well
---
[removed]
---
Yea haha happened to me recently actually
---
Yes it has..
---
I had one for 25 years. My sister still has my grandparents TV. It has only 1 knob for on and off with volume control also. They only had one channel back then.
---
T H E  P O W E R  O F

Looks like neck
---
have you checked?
---
You can't just put two pictures of lesion and say it's cosplay
---
yeah we looked for it awhile and dont know where to find it.
---
r/unexpectedSCP
---
IKR? Why cant kids these days just use salt
---
As cute these are it's a shame they dont seem believable but these are nice mock ups though
---
i just checked myself and didnt see it either. it most likely isnt there
---
:(
---
Switching to pistol and realizing its empty
---
Absolutely casual. I suck with Glaz and wouldn’t play like this otherwise.
---
Just wait till you get your hands on glaz after rework
---
Is that a thing?!
---
Whats your number in the first place? I cant help you much but to just go to [Mouse Sensitivity](www.mouse-sensitivity.com) and input your numbers there with simple mode.
---
Gotta flex one time
---
ok thats fine but thank you for checking
---
Only Lord Tachanka could have survived
---
It was a sick play tho, that double knife got me geekin
---
For anyone wondering, the Chinese characters in the charm name for the first 2 images mean “freeze time”, the third image “having happiness/satisfaction oneself”.
---
What do you mean?
---
Shoulder or neck
---
How is it false advertising

Idk what I’m missing here 🧐
---
Not bad kid, not bad
---
I made 3 headshots to Pulse and I died faster from the fire exchange somehow.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I didn't notice it until someone said in the kill feed that I died first.
---
It’s called “scope”, it replaces the old Acog.
---
Only when I pay the headshot hit box is thiCC af

---
When ever any pro, or even lower level comp players mentions anything about balance from an above plat 3 PoV, they get flamed because the lower level people think it is "balanced" and are now prejudiced against anything comp.
---
You would've thought the popsicle stick would've been the EASIEST part to replicate
---
#gr8
---
It’s fucking cancer man :/
---
Hibana's Pistol. If you've ever used it, you know.
---
Explosives still tk, otherwise you could have teammates rush while Fuze charges are going off.
---
Maybe it’s a west coast thing then
---
If it's on for 3 weeks just reset the ranks every week
---
3 armor, but he doesn't take that many bullets. 6 at most
---
But somehow the enemy will shoot your foot and somehow get a headshot
---
Looked fine, then it hit
---
Right!?
---
Nomad.  Very solid for bomb and more versatile.
---
EST 8-12pm
---
I guess so. But they could do something with the nitro. How many times are you going to be rushing and nitroing your teammates. Maybe a chaotic Blitz rush could be a situation, but it's also not that hard to get explosive kills. I'm iffy on the subject.
---
casual has a different mmr than ranked, so he probably hasn't played much casual that season
---
This is why I play on console more
---
I’ve gotten 2 ever legendaries in my life. Both of them were this charm. It haunts me now.
---
it'll sting a lot
---
That’s literally just a screenshot of her in game. Nice try
---
Also that valk's gun really suffers from fall-off.
---
Nomad
---
Thats not true at all. It takes probably 5 shots in CQB and 7 shots if your spawnpeeking
---
“Rushing meme” knifes player as sledge instead of hammering. My disappointment is immeasurable.
---
You can't take a screenshot of her, you can't even see her!
---
Nice, its in ranked too
---
Now that player is gona go to headquarters and blow up everything to join your cause
---
yes, and it always requires a full patch to do so. doable, but inefficient considering the plethora of other game breaking bugs currently in the game. setting ammo to zero was the easier method in the long run.
---
Simply basing off of weapons vigil.
---
This kind of happened to me. I accidently killed my teammate. I shot a welcome mat and died for no reason
---
Doc is really good for clutching on that site. You can just duck behind cover, quickly heal yourself and swing out. 1v5'd a few times as him on that site myself.
---
When you turn into a hall with *tachanka* staring straight at you
---
That could work

Tha fuck?

I feel so naked without it! :(

"You F ucking Muppets!"
---
Goddamn Caviera, stop appearing out of a corner I swear you weren’t in.
---
Should’ve gone for the head
---
if it gets spotted it's gone, and she has two. You should only lose a gadget or two to twitch's drone each max. Gadgets are nice, but getting rid of a few of them as your gadget does not make an operator viable. ACOG going bye bye on Twitch is lazy balancing, and the community will whine for someone else next. Ash was the only one justifiable imo
---
I got team killed just a second ago because “I wasn’t planting.” I was on objective for like 5 seconds and was trying to make sure I wasn’t going to get shot in the back.
---
Any alpha pack you get could transfer over to the normal server
---
Personally this doesn't really affect me, as I only play on one platform and just want to be able to play with my PC friends, but I see how what you're saying could be useful.
---
When you turned around all I could hear was “Ah shit, here we go again”
---
How high are you?
---
I got team killed then a teammate left on ranked. It was GG.
---
2800 because 3000 wouldn't make sense
---
This has never happened to me. Am I just lucky
---
Yes.
---
That is the fundamental of the game, around which the gun skill has been built, which is also why BB is perceived as fundamentally broken (and removal of this mechanism makes him even more so).
---
Any non-projectile except ash charges and cap bolts will 1shs. That's the rule. And it should stay.
---
Echo too ._.
---
Yeah m8, we were questioning the toothpick :Lesion
---
I’ve gotten an ace and 2 4v1 clutches on this map, although the enemy team kinda threw by pushing while I was in the rafters. It can be possible my guy
---
Lesion is perfect
---
did he actually swap warden and nokk
---
Fuze: \*laughs in communist\*
---
Didn't realize I was getting downvoted like this lmao
---
It's legit just an if-and segment of lines in C# (I learned C# in high school, sorta) ((or whatever the equivalent of whatever language Ubi uses would be)).
---
This is what I imagine every siege player looks like based on the voices I’ve heard
---
Just for future reference
---
Not true, friends and I surrendered every game apart from 1 and we all still got copper iv

Thanks for the kind feedback. Cosider leaving a rating on the store if you did not already.

---
I'd say Monty is pretty fucking annoying
---
Currently I am experimenting with the frequency. This will not be the end result. Want to make 99% happy :D
---
im sure you checked **everyone** during the match
---
He’s often played on Defender sided maps (like Villa and Bank) that are large and difficult to roam clear on. As such the win delta suffers from playing disproportionately on maps attackers struggle on.
---
These stats don’t mean a lot without context so don’t let it make you think Jackal is a bad pick lol.
---
Hell yeah
---
Wow, thank you very much for the kind comment.
---
 Cosider leaving a rating on the store if you did not already.

Thank you very much! Am Jackal Main as well :D
---
 Cosider leaving a rating on the store if you did not already.
---
I'm pretty sure r6 tracker has a delay for when it collects the data so it's probably ok to check after the match
---
Hey,at least it's not like the plot of Splinter Cell Blacklist where Fifth Echelon makes a big deal of "we ONLY answer to the President" and then halfway through they assault high-ranking military personnel in a special forces base on foreign soil while explicitly keeping the President out of the loop.
---
Anyway,I read like halfway through the book and from there it seems like with their level of autonomy,they could theoretically go rogue from NATO command,especially considering their ties to multiple intelligence communities.
---
But I doubt that even if every field operative and intelligence staff decided "we wanna take over an island base and be like Sealand",they wouldn't be able to stand up to the military and intelligence efforts of literally every member state.
---
In terms of your question specifically,I think it is very reasonable that Rainbow could pull off assassination/wiretapping/electronic warfare on their own perogative while keeping NATO,the UN,and member states all in the dark,and therefore act in a "rogue" capacity unopposed for quite some time.
---
You are right! But there is no mobile app for tracking your whole squad for this.
---
Greets
---
So are Doc and Rook because ACOG spawn peeks
---
People found an exploit with them so Ubi temporary removed them. That's also why clash is banned for now
---
These 2 images are the same
---
Nope.
---
It's only his KPR (Kills per Round). He is one of my homies, classical Ash Jager Main, but damn he is good.
---
Haha, now you know which operator will take you to bronze!
---
Rook Main on Defense checking in.
---
Ubi plz.
---
Did not find any full body picture on the ubisoft website yet. :(
---
When that one guy was 10-1, I checked everyones...
---
Is there like a subreddit for bargain bin cosplay?
---
Kapkan has only 2 armor and is even more of an absolute unit
---
Ubi doesn't care at this point
---
They were also a premade and ubi matchmacking sucks, yep
---
I'm a silver 3 (always been a plat 3 tho) and i keep finding plats when i search for a match. I don't know if it'because i've been a plat 3 before
---
I'll be honest I see no issue here.
---
I want them both tbh :P
---
I do understand removing them though and prefer this solution over having to deal with the ridiculous glitches
---
Yeah, have to agree
---
I've been killed because of this too many times
---
For the watch

---
Wouldn’t the “client” pcs still have to communicate to a host pc somewhere?
---
Hell yes, actually.
---
This is what peak human evolution looks like
---
Not sure how that makes what I said "not true".
---
You can end up copper 1 if you lose all ten. I've done it.
---
 It's a matter of who you get matched against. You could match well and lose more MMR sure, never suggested you couldn't. You could match badly and lose less and not end up in copper as the poster above suggested.
---
You'll notice I said 'you can' not that you will. MMR is based on who you match against and therefore variable. There isn't any certainty.
---
Also you're a twat. Who answers like that on such an old thread.
---
He's a 3 armour and defense guns are usually weaker. Not many people use him, which is why gridlock makes me realise how much I hate 3 armour attackers.
---
I've found that rubbing up against them usually gets them to fall out of the way.
---
Bomb and secure turned off bbyyy
---
Their entire team wiped because of greed.
---
Nokk and warden are on the wrong sides
---
That's only for smoke. Not flash
---
Ho chips that's cool
---
Can't get over that improperly placed cheek protector.
---
With a real gun, all you'd get firing it right handed like this is a faceful of hot burning cases and gas.
---
Had a game of hostage on oregon just yesterday, defenders were in meeting hall and we rushed through construction. No enemy traps so ash just sprints straight to the hostage, grabs it and goes. Won the round in like 20 seconds. 
---
In short, hostage is the best game mode, it's dumb and silly and fun in ways that siege otherwise struggles to be.
---
Sorry but this was not miraculous in any way.
---
Do you have a link?
---
It was a 2 stack. My friend couldn't take our randoms ineptitude in the last round so he left
---
Well it definitely wasn't skill.
---
Were getting one next season a new op with a foam gun
---
It's now fixed in the TTS with bew barricades.
---
Best update. Better than new ops
---
What mode are you playing ?
---
A "friend" of me found this while Surfing on NSFW sites... -.-
---
thats why i deleted the comment, pengu plays on 4:3 1920x1080 the same as i do
---
It was just painful to watch sorry.
---
the next season
---
This always happens to me every fucking game and has lost me whole games and causes me to derank, they really need to fix it
---
Was harmful to my eyes
---
No , otherwise console players would instantly quit siege
---
You have some really cool captures posted too! Keep it up!
---
no
---
F
---
You're not helping yourself.
---
Bring back blood orchid
---
Wasn't looking to.
---
Thanks 😇
---
Clearly...
---
Im sad
---
For thicc bois only!
---
if you really want to play clash . go for TTS if you got PC
---
This.
---
Ford? You mean "forward" by a chance?
---
I don't if I should be confused because he's reading hentai or because I know the anime version of this.
---
The psychological horror part is a 1v5 against doki, jackal, lion, blitz, and fuze.

Jesus, young and ford? I think you need auto correct off.

No.

Not trying to come off as an ass but ehy would you play ranked on the tts

Nope

I recommend putting an nsfw tag

She has one of the best guns in the game...

They probably thought it was fun having two Bandits around with different movement speed and weapon loadouts yet similar gadgets.

---
What superpowers does your internet have
---
So the uniforms are very similar to other dark coloured uniforms and the only real difference is the helmet for a 25-30k renown, might not bother with this honestly.
---
She has the best weapon in the game. You cannot beat the F2 at anything but long range
---
So does jackal, fuze and thermite who have the top 3 best weapons in the game
---
I can almost hear them calling their opponents “kids” through the picture.
---
Not gonna lie, I thought that too. Haven't played GTA5 in forever though
---
Im scared of glitches but its actually genious
---
Very very very very very very nice
---
They're testing a fix right now for it
---
By what metric?
---
I only ever play the superior game mode, hostage. Just kidding, its bomb. No way should the pro league game mode be taking that long to match up with people lol. Was wondering if its because of the glitches they've been dealing with lately. Noticed claymores are still out.
---
Fuze, thermite and jackal have the top3 best weapons in the game...
---
Check the stats
---
Higher dps means higher killing power
---
Money
---
I dont have the stats in front of me rn but I feel that the mk 22 or whatever blackbeard's full auto is is pretty trash I would much prefer the sr
---
But twitch being the highest pick op was dumb for them to give to her that
---
They are a one shot and you get the points for a headshot when you hit the neck. Look it up, I'm right
---
I’ve played every day for the past two months.
---
Yeah, what's up with that? I've never seen anyone on this sub at least calling for her to be nerfed. So glad that the leaks about her losing 1 of her Trax was wrong as well (for now at least).
---
Why do you think its bad
---
It is a test server, so Ubisoft wants as many people as possible to find potential bugs, balance issues, exploits etc. Currently the only incentive is to try the new operators, but that just works for a few days. As soon as the ops stop feeling "new", players will go back to the live build as they would feel like they are wasting their time since there is no benefit to them. Adding an incentive would encourage people to stay and help Ubisoft with their testing.
---
The nitro cells beep in TH 😨
---
Can i join?
---
But I'm not saying that full autos are bad I said fire rate is important
---
Same man! Have fun.
---
Did the same but last guy I downed on a secure site. 5/5 interos
---
Great lesion cosplay but you got the summer skin on you,  shold've used the lesion summerskin picture on the left
---
Slow fire rate I'm pretty sure
---
And again I dont think that full autos are bad
---
ngl unironically using triggered as an insult is super edgy
---
RIP strange screaming woman with shield on defense 09.04.2018 - 05.18.2019

I wonder what solo ranked must feel like
---
Ik thats but dpz is also important its why people say guns are op
---
8th Grade is 14 years old... Siege is rated M18... Wait a minute... FBI OPEN UP
---
Ok when it comes to blackbeard he has a slow fire rate for balancing reasons
---
&gt; Yet u havent proved me weong and your still typing
---
You've not shown that what you say is right. I don't need to prove you wrong.
---
Its true doe
---
But in siege the headshots are 1 shot so whoever can fire first will majority of the time win the engagement
---
Wow that was a thing? I wasn't around for that long
---
Very very very very very very very nice
---
so you did the cheapest/most unfair spawnpeak against clearly worse players, you are amazing!
---
You asked me for a weapon a gave it to you didnt say It was unbalanced or just straight trash
---
Better maps/rules.
---
Fbi open up
---
Yes, to drone them out and be ready to prefire the corner their sitting in
---
Also depends on aim, the situation meaning high ground or on a window, and if the person is crouched or is a monty,blitz or blackbeard
---
Germans aren't in this kind of porn.
---
They're in weird porn.
---
But hentais oml 🙄😨
---
looks amazing but you're gonna have to change it every 3 months
---
If you're talking about the origin fo12 shotgun, origin is the guns manufacturer in real life btw, but if you put a surpressor on that that's just stupid. You're getting rid of a decent ranged shotgun that actually gives Ela a chance at anything past 2ft away from her. If you're talking about the worst stat gun in game the scorpion it's suicide. Reason why is the scorpion without anything is already at a pitiful damage of 23 standard up to 20m, past that it drops to 15 damage. Keep in mind her pistol does about twice as much damage per shot. But adding a surpressor to the scorpion one decreases its range and decreases the fall of range for that damage so the scorpion with a surpressor goes from being effective at 2ft away to only a foot basically.
---
Hon. No one is gonna ban Tachanka 😂 he’s not enough of a menace.
---
Yeah I know. Don't really know how they overlooked that one.
---
That's why they are increasing twitches recoil. If it's harder to hit that headshot on the second or third bullet, it may just give the defender a chance but I see where you're coming from
---
This when the leader says RUSH
---
While stuck in Copper IV and solo queueing i had a guy playing with a gamepad.... ON FUCKING PC

So looking at premium it says you can track 20 people and database updates faster. How fast does it update for the free version and how many people can you track in the free version?

Now that's what I call Death Penalty

2.8? If so cycles or evee?

What you talking about boy?

That way you cant get killed by a runout, duh

That would carry a Luison bonus of +20

Not if i use incognio

No, I use 2.79b, so just cycles. I've had 2.8 crash too many times to feel safe doing any work on it.

I imagine he’s confused because he’s reading left to right despite what Echo told him fifteen times.
---
Oh shit

Should i buy DLC ops 
---
he was a level 12
---
First of all, if you are soo disturbed: go back to CSGO. Ignovladge that these are two difrent games.
---
Other than that,just change the dpi of your mouse everytime before you open Siege. Than when you clos ethe game you can change back.
---
This is something that probably disturbes only the %10 of the new players in the game so it shouldent be an update. NO WAY.
---
Holy Jesus.... That is.... scary but extraordinary
---
We know what they look like, most suck and obstruct view.
---
nice grammar btw lul
---
Aren’t they supposed to nerf Glaz?
---
So you are saying that people can already easily destroy Frost traps with 3 bullets but is throwing a hissy fit if it reduces down to 2.
---
Lmaooo
---
Me thinks doth protest too much
---
You goomba
---
people don'r really like to play in casual map like favela or yatch, so they leave
---
I leave when I don't clutch to avoid toxicity or teamkilling in the next round
---
I know but the some that are clean I would use
---
I do. Just becuase you dont wanna look doesnt make me wrong second in an arguement 1 person i suppossed to prove the others claim wrong.
---
Dirty ... but not toxic and i love it.

I wouldn't mind hostage so much if the drop point wasn't literally right outside the window on 99% of maps.

Not according to what you've written. In order to have a claim worth arguing against you need to support that claim, something you still haven't managed to do (while also moving the goalposts).
---
&gt;Just becuase you dont wanna look doesnt make me wrong
---
I've not said anything of the sort...
---
&gt;in an arguement 1 person i suppossed to prove the others claim wrong.

After that person supports their claim.
---
If you assert something without evidence then it can just be dismissed.
---
Sledge is me during any family picture
---
It's hentai, and its art
---
Just beuase you dont want to look at the evidance does mean im not supporting my claim .
---
They are these are just some they decided to add in a recent TTS update but yea Frost is a bit pointless nerfing i main her and even i know shes shit
---
Congrats
---
You talking about the nerf to his scope, so it acts like Warden?
---
You've not shown me any evidence. Timestamp please...
---
I started dying when the maverick was doing it behind the window
---
this way they'll never see your zip line and prefire your face
---
i dont see it
---
I’m sorry I get being a try hard but do you expect everyone to be shit in casual? Like nobody can just play and be good?
---
Yea sure dude. That's the reason you are mad. Because of those pesky frost mat wallbangs that are oh so common in Siege.
---
Lmaooooooo
---
Valk turns into a literall valk and straight up flies into the enemy team

idk either tbh , he just got it

Yo, how good is it?
---
Blitz: *sigh* *unzips pants*
---
When you’re whole team leaves so Cav can’t get you
---
I wonder what would happen if you mixed blitz with clash.
---
Glaz is a sniper not an entry fragger. honestly Glaz seems fine so far, just play more passive instead of for example walking down the laundry stairs while its smoked and hard pusbing in on Oregon. he was never meant to be an entry fragger
---
If you think Glaz is mediocre at best, then you are clearly new to the game and therefore your opinions can bu summarily dismissed
---
Glaz is broken at any decent rank. Now you’re just forced to play him as intended. Sure if he becomes too weak, buff it to 4-3 seconds, but his current state is bad for the game.
---
A better move
---
?
---
Why? So you can trash talk people with bad K/D?
---
what
---
Sometimes it's impossible to notice especially if you're holding an angle
---
its red and its bright
---
we have a winner
---
Wait till the Mexican op comes out
---
Doesn't matter what he wants. Ubisoft won't allow it. People seem to quickly forget how greedy Ubisoft as a publisher have been.
---
And it's on the bottom of your screen. Like I said, it's hard to notice when you're concentrating on an angle
---
Just play casual if you want to play hostage then
---
I’d be irritated AF someone auto locking my favorite ops!! Lol
---
To clarify my main strife is when people leave and you get other players, who wanted a game, get forced into a 0 2 game where u get in last round and it auto picks techanka. What I am saying is that cause people leave I get people forced into half finished games
---
That killed my ears
---
I did this with a tachanka turret in there... in ranked
---
"Palhaço" is sooo sexy.....
---
If you go to change your flair. There should be a edit button top right on screen (if on mobile) that will let you customize it. If your on a computer i dont know
---
Because some of the game audio cute out and you can't hear dokkaebis logic bomb
---
&gt;because it’s a sweat-fest
---
As it should be. And if you don't care about your rank, I'm sure copper will still be copper.
---
Where the fuck are you getting the 8 from? Shouldn't it be 15-5=8, meaning you have 8 seconds to shoot. Seems like more than enough to me.
---
2FA?
---
But I think it's to long maybe buff till 5 or 6 seconds
---
First, thanks for the quick reply, but what does that mean?
---
Just stay on spawn lmao, it's not that hard
---
someone had to say it
---
Can confirm, was friend
---
Two factor authentication. I know you need it to play ranked in pc but I'm not sure about other game modes like casual
---
Ok ima check it out👍
---
I hate clash
---
this man speaks the truth
---
58100.
---
That is the one specifically in the image, of the 6 that currently exist. If you don't know what to do with those numbers, you don't deserve the sauce.
---
Stop. You’ve posted the same thing too many times. It’s a good change, wait till he’s out on the live build.
---
That doesn't mean that the casual matchmaking isn't shit tho.
---
It is.
---
That's all I've said.
---
If the purpose of casual is to not have ranks then it's fucking failed, because it uses the exact same system as ranked and I have to work even harder in casual for some stupid reason.
---
You can't just "ignore the hidden mmr" when it's the entire reason that Casual sucks. "Not facing people of the same skill level as you" is awful when it's only the players above you and never the players below.
---
Also, given that you never seem to see smurfs, lemme give my input. Around the Gold level of play you'd be lucky to find a game *without* someone fucking with matchmaking, Ranked OR Casual.
---
Oh sweet summer child.

Thanks for the feedback, consider rating the app on the store, helps out a lot &lt;3
---
I gently open the door...
---
Actually looks worse in-game than the pro league skin.
---
Why?????
---
Thanks :)
---
Seems kinda petty in my mind, but you do you.
---
That sucks
---
U clearly just got outplayed. Ubisoft be like its not a bug its a feature.
---
I played against a guy on PS4 who'd make the whole game lag to the point where you couldn't move.. So they planted and started lagging so you wouldn't be able to defuse and on defense he'd make it lag the whole round... I had no idea you're able to do anything like this on PS4...
---
There's more to the story than you're telling us. I've heard of people getting permabans for nothing, but I'm nearly certain you were in some form toxic.
---
Little grind and completing challanges usually gets you 50'000 renown a month on average.
---
So, two dlc ops a month.
---
Yes, and vigil did his job perfectly.
---
The revolver was a terrible mistake, but I wouldn’t lump a gameplay decision for one game with Steam devs, they’re completely different teams.  
---
What Steam UI are you talking about? I don’t think the new one is forced out because I’ve been using the same layout since 2013.  
---
Unfortunately I don’t play dota so I can’t speak to that one. Really though in years past I would agree with you, but they gotten a lot better (especially for cs:go). I’d say Ubisoft are much worse when it comes to not planning ahead. Look at how buggy Siege was when it first came out, or how many bugs are released in every update.
---
Where is this from dude? looks dope af
---
But what did it cost
---
After benchmarking very high and ultra, I only gain about 5-10fps playing on very high (already around the \~180fps). 
---
Turns out that the rainbow six settings say I use 6396/5980 mb of vram, but after downloading MSI afterburner, the program said I used 5200-5500mb which is fine.
---
Yeah but a shitty one bc you’re just going to kill your bandwidth
---

I’ll fuck you up little pussy bitch recruit main fuck off

Lets put it like this. What gadgets affect the game and helps your team more, twitch drone or fuzez gadget. Twitches gadget is very good becuase its 1 of 2 gadgets that destroy enemy gadgets, thatcher being the other one. But thatcher isnt as fun as twitch. I wont count IQ becuase she has to risk her life and is harder fo destroy gadgets with.
---
Overall Operators depend on the effectivness of their gadget in the high rankes and pro league. Thats why in pro league zofia is used more than ash becuase her gadget is more effective and better
---
Happened to me once but there were two attackers and i was echo

---
Apparently firing through soft walls gives bad karma
---
They bring out new legendaries each season so not really no
---
I'd say it's pay to have a slight advantage. Having more ops is always better than having less
---
There's still hardly any reason you'd pick him over bandit. Believe me. I'm trying to main Kaid and it just feels like 9/10 I should have picked bandito. I think making him the gadget specialist would at least give you a better reason to pick him. Even with three claws, his weapons are subpar and bandit would still be more picked overall
---
This
---
Sorry, i stick to my opinion. I dislike it, because it happens so often lately that i can count the rounds on one hand till it happens next. My conclusion for this is not touching this game, because it is too much toxicity in casual, when you only want to relax and have fun...
---
Since this flew over your head, my point was that even if theyre a 3 armor they can still get picked.
---
I would have said an attacker 3 armor but theyre either shields or gridlock and im not gonna count gridlock as she came this season .
---
Its part of a ritual.
---
It’s ok, I have to take breaks myself every now and then. Usually when I come back from said breaks I’m refreshed and I come back playing better then ever. So good luck with your break and take it easy. Oh, and about the connection thing, I’d suggest switching to and Ethernet connection if at all possible. It would certainly help reduce the rubber-banding that can occur.
---
Have you seriously never experienced the audio bug where some sounds get completely cut out?
---
They really have to do something about this, people paid good money to play these ops (season pass owners) and if you can't even play them, *i smell law suits*

She was able to use her claymore to glitch herself in such a way that she’s completely invisible to the enemy team. Her body stays at her spawn point but in reality she’s actually able to fully run around and function as though she’s normal. She can kill you and you have no idea where you’re getting shot from

jesus christ this sub is toxic. why tf are you being downvoted?
---
GL HF!
---
You can't give Nokk any other gun than the FMG-9 anything else would make her too strong, a secondary SMG would also be a bad idea.
---
I agree to a point, where as I find Kaid in the situational/site dependent standard. If you have hatches a Kaid is going to be more prevalent than a bandit. (depending on the Site) For example, Armory/Church on club house (cause the dirt tunnel can be electro clawed) and then you can Impact/Electro claw the hatch or Laundry/Storage on Oregon. electro claw tricking on that is going to make the attack slow way down and you have you wire on your stairs to protect you and give you a sound queue that they are coming. But again why is there C4 on kaid and Not Warden? what other 3/1 has an acog and C4? No one, Mira is the only one that has C4 as the 3/1 and no Acog and it only seems fair to give one to Warden and give Kaid his Impacts back.
---
Nah he's currently at 42% and he still can't manage to get one pray for him pls.
---
I’ve used the nitro a few times in the TS and I actually like it
---
Caveira and nokk explains it

First of all ubi won't be changing their guns it's because of engine limitations why they can't and the fact it's becoming harder to get licenses for the newer guns.

They also had to work on the Ghost Recon wildlands game and were pulled from working on siege.

Jeez... just got back into siege and this happened to me and a buddy in a casual game.  Sounds like the games got quite a few probs right now.

What question?

Realize that R6 is different than any other shooter your most likely used to. Take your time and attempt to plan out every round. (play with friends if possible) Don't sacrifice your drone, use that baby to the best of your ability. This game rewards player that out think their opponents. Until you "get gud" try to avoid rushing, unless of course your doing it for the meme!
---
Have fun, and remember it's just a game! I've seen too many people quit because they can't get over the learning curve.
---
wow i had no idea you could do that
---
The reason this works is cause when you're ADSing you can't see down cause the weapon model is in the way by the way.
---
Because they have around the same mmr just when your unranked you don't see your mmr. Quantity does not mean quality I am lvl 328 or something around that area and my highest this season is gold 1

If i ever get upset I just play the next few rounds as Recruit. The lack of a gadget and sights helps me reign everything back in and focus, plus who doesn’t love playing Recruit?

got what you deserved for playing blitz...

It's not improperly placed.  It's an airsoft rifle with a switch where the cheek protector is on one side.  Nothing i can do about it lmaooo

A ddos or  Distributed-Denial-of-Service attack basically floods the server with packets, naturally the server cant handle "unlimited" amount of packets and just gives up, either timing connections out or completely crash the system.

If a test server turned out to have an exploit for easy renown, they wouldn’t want that to carry over. It’s much simpler to keep them entirely airgapped.

No i replied to a reply of yours to a reply of mine that replied to your comment

Of course Reddit has to be the one to say this and not actually Ubi. They are fuckin trash

dude the amount of times I've played terrorist hunt I've put 500 hours into it in the past 4 years I been playing, There's always been people who are stood in doorways and racing to take your kills, next time that happens I'm shooting them in the head and taking reverse friendly fire, Nevermind it's not in terrorist hunt.

I would play tts if the size werent this big. It takes 3-6 hours for me to download at max. But i dont have enough space. I also play other games. Maybe just use the test server to play on selected maps and modes to reduce the size?

It's really crazy how situational Warden is. He's almost not viable in competitive matches unless it's a site where YOU KNOW the attackesr will be using smoke *and* you use the Six Pick on him after confirming it.
---
I know that guy from IG but I don’t follow him on YouTube cuz they steal content but also they show really good strats
---
that sounds like a lot of work, and based on the guys movement I have no doubt he is good, but seriously, what the FUCK was that Hibana thinking? On what planet would that be a good idea?

I agree with this statement. I say it’s technically pay to win, but still more of a play to speed up your gameplay and get the ops sooner

Reminds me of an old video from over a decade ago, *”Counter-Strike For Kids”*

Honestly.

I’m blanking. Which prototype SMG? I know Finka’s gun was just a mock-up IRL. The MPX is real, and so are the MP5 variants and the Cx4 Storm. Which one are you talking about?

Edit: Nevermind. FMG-9.

You can't

Yeah. I feel like if they did do this change, people would not see the barricade as a thing that can also benefit them( from not being shot) but a thing they have to fear, or give more importance to like when you see a regual black mirror

I got deja vu from this post and I was like “why is somebody sending out Armory window and grabbing a 2 piece familiar” “oh yeah Acez”
---
There's literally a season drop countdown on the TTS and the new OPs are purchasable separately 7 days after. So yeah
---
I thought I was just glitching.  Did the devs remove it?
---
Yes, because a pair of glasses which can see old footprints and identify exactly who they came from and where they are now makes sense. Doesn't really have to make sense, not like it's a good suggestion but still
---
Well Ubisoft can also check other things, such as hardware ID which is much harder to change/spoof. I wouldn't waste my time on trying to get unbanned if I hacked, wouldn't make an ass out of myself in my main Reddit account either.
---
lol imagine playing hostage
---
Last time I did it through Ubisoft support, got a response in a day saying they shadow-dropped a booster into my account. First time I did it was through twitter. I would suggest Ubisoft support, explain you got a X-Day booster, BE POLITE, and explain the down time/server issues that prevented full use of your booster.
---
yeah some shit like that... i bet that there are enough idiots who would do this
---
They’ve never met me before
---
Yes, all console players have free access to the TTS. I used to play it back before I switched to PC. Controller on a laptop. If you own the game on any platform, you can download and play on the TTS.

There should be a better place to post clips, this sub can be so much more than a dump of low effort game recordings and ego posts. How about discussions and suggestions on how to truly make the game better? Maybe start rationalizing ideas, start making the community less retarded. But no, worthless clips.
---
Don't play hostage, hostage sucks. Take it out of your matchmaking settings

but only the guys with the bomb

Everyone's mileage may vary. When I contact support, I go in with a "not gonna get shit" mentality so I'm delightfully surprised when I do get a resolution. Also helps to hedge your bets and be polite/respectful to your support rep.
---
For Youtube? Teamkilling/throwing videos aren’t even funny though.
---
I’m pretty sure it sends this out to anyone signed up for email updates in Canada
---
Well....just like the rest of social media once you get a good photo of it, the real thing doesn’t matter anymore! Toss em’!
---
I just saying that shooting your teammate is a great counter to cav that is both balanced and makes sense. Why the hell sould that be removed?
---
Jackel’s scanner makes sense in the context of a technology advanced world. 
---
Interrogating someone who has been shot to death does not make sense in any world
---
Big thank
---
Thats true too
---
Boosters are real-time based, each day giving you 24 hours to use it. While yes, it can suck for downtime to have it like this, I do enjoy planning 2 days off in a row where me and some buddies all activate our boosters at the same time, snort some G-Fuel and guzzle Monsters while we take advantage of the boosters since it's not on a per-match basis. Those White Masks hate it EVERY TIME.
---
Well I'm just saying it doesn't have to make sense. But the suggestion isn't a good one either way, especially considering that if they can shoot their guy they can definitely shoot you, which is a better choice either way soooo....
---
Hey maybe don’t witch hunt. Just send a report to ubisoft

It seems her ability affects others negatively in many different ways. I haven't really thought of that myself, everyone has a different experience, mine happens to be sound. She needs work.
---
Teamwork makes the dream work &lt;3
---
I like it
---
Maybe because Nøkk isn't pronounced like knock?
---
It takes away all the muzzle flash whereas the flash hider just redirects it so it’s not in front of your reticle. It’s never really the best option but I like being able to see everything on my screen. Same reason I use the reflex, it blocks less of the screen

They should just open all operators in Terror hunt.

Yeah it looks pretty nice but like he said, using a controller would be tedious af to pick an operator

In future keep in mind: If it's not yours, then there's an extremely high chance it has been posted already

---
I just want to point my tactical flashlight into my teammates' face.
---
Jun 11. Case closed.
---
Yeah, that’s mostly it. I tend to play hard breachers and entry fraggers/ obj pushers. I haven’t really taken the time to learn nomad mostly because I’m usually the breacher.
---
I did commented about this, yes he does.But it is hidden unless you choose to view the image closer by clicking on it.By reading all the comments, it doesn't seem as if anyone knows it's this guy's idea.

Oh yea.. its gonna be a bit tedious for console

Thanks :D

I would recommend you Zofia then.

You can do custom flairs now, it allows up to 5 emojis on the flair

---
Alright thanks. And what would be a good defender operator? Although I'm currently happily using Jager and Doc.
---
Nothing wrong. It's actually pretty cool that they did this.
---
If you are playing the game alone, then 8GM ram is definitely enough.
---
But if you are opening multiple browser, discord, whatever app you are running in the background, you might need more.
---
i mean....those weapons are all used by those units. just because a gun is a produced in a different country, that doesnt mean that unit cant use the gun
---
Says the blitz main!! /s........yeah u right tho.
---
Also yeah, my city is full of those. I just don’t see the social media craze. I when I first saw Instagram I thought it was a really cool platform for people into photography. And it (was)! That’s why I had an account back then. Now 80% of that site is full of memes now, some ignorant some ok, which is what reddit is for. Oh and the god awful kardashians, tons of shitposts.  
---
But anyway back to the black ice, yes that is rather nerve wracking, both on the verge of making a run for it!
---
I commented about this, yes he did, BUT it is almost as if he tried to hide it.There is really no point to click on the image, all you have to see is already there.It's also just really bad placement, most people in the comments actually think it's his idea, and he responds to them as if it is!
---
Uh, excuse me? Is obviously Warden

Good luck
---
If its NEU or in Britain is half term time. All the little kiddies are on and ready to troll. Best thing to do is either wait it out, play ranked or play a different game tbh.
---
Because some people have large egos and if someone doesn't play how "they're supposed to play", they throw a fit.
---
Yeah that would be good. The guns with prefix grips (Aug A2, Mp5k, Mp7 etc) get more 1st shot recoil than other guns because they can't get vertical grip in-game. Ubi-daddy why doesn't you like these cool gun. :(
---
I’m not the only one that dose this YES
---
Lit dude lol
---
I think it’s ok, the ranks all balance out so it is all good
---
Pretty sure it was steaming hot in that room
---
Some people tried to kick me after I clutched a round and got three votes. Then this 14 year old kid gets on the mic and is like "aw come on guys that's pretty toxic, I'll vote no for you dude". Not all of the younger kids are annoying little shits, I actually enjoy playing with them sometimes, they're so encouraging sometimes. I wonder where that energy goes?
---
The only thing you can do in any game to influence your team is give good call outs, and stay positive and check cams if you die, some people just can’t handle the fact that they are losing in a video game
---
Could you explain what the purpose of a new drone would be?
---
It's funny cause Lesion's name in development was Caltrop!
---
What was thatcher aiming at?
---
Be harder to hit the drone
---
Not OP is it’s on Windows. Doorways are still 100% passable and viable. 
---
Window play can be so strong but is never the main entry point. It’ll just mean you have to enter the building to push site
---
If you click on a players name it will bring you all your stats in siege. Casual, ranked, operators.
---
Nice art!

Those bundles do exist.

You say that, but he has a 10 minute video of this kind of stuff on his Youtube account.

I saw it and it makes sense
---
One-Keep us updated plz
---
Two-Hoe do you get the "alibi main" or "Fuze main" tags
---
This is why you put two down
---
1. It's deployable
---
2. They're disabled
---
Its very gamey meat but pretty unique, use lots of ketchup or bbq sauce lmao.
---
Pistol part is the best, I use pistols wayyy more than anybody just cause most people don’t realize how high of damage you get and you only need one shot
---
This is amazing
---
It would look cool
---
I think more maps than you think would work great with this. Take CEO on Bank (top floor objectives). If you Castle the double windows on in CEO office, a Thermite has to make a decision. Do I breach the window and try and then get one wall, or do I focus on the walls. 
---
It would make a site like that so much more viable just by restricting the window play, which can be a huge factor. 
---
This rework would 100% make him more viable overall, and would make him meta changing in the right way
---
Bull... it's a 30 sec Google visit
---
Why are they disabled
---
Or the thing that showed what round it was never going away

Like the TF2 weapon borrow thing?
---
Thanks. It’s a simple rework that does really push him into a site defending beast on specific objectives. Window play isn’t countered any differently in game to doorway play, however each one plays out differently. 
---
This change is perfect I feel. Thanks for the support
---
I guess that makes sense but I'd still rather use a sight because thatcher isn't played too often unless you're defending snowmobile garage lol
---
use the search bar
---
You're doing gods work
---
This is why I dont play this game as much 80 percent of the people are fucking assholes who kill for simply existing and when your carrying they just decide to ruin your perfect game
---
Lol dude I got 3 downvotes for saying "this"
---
Well yea that's just my opinion :)
---
Lesion is easy and good
---
Oof. I gave you an upvote for support. 
---
People are just deluded
---
Shit, that's pretty cool, I didn't know about collegiate level siege. Is there any way to find out more about the league itself?
---
That straight up looks like the siege wallpaper thing tho
---
Only reddit ;-;
---
Then he’s just a utility eating pain that would really break the game
---
This has happened to me like 4 times over the 102 hours of playing him and each time it happened i was fuming.

CoreRoss is so fast at getting the patch notes that even the devs who created the patch aren’t faster than him
---
They used Frost’s trap mat. Not a shield. It was the shield glitch but instead of a deployable shield they used a Frost mat.
---
I did for a while, are there private servers or something?
---
What about the ticketmaster on The Polar Express?
---
Fuze crafts a potion and forces the defenders to drink it
---
yeah I know that, but before the shields were removed, I would be fine playing echo any site. I'd rather have a shield to sit behind while I watch my drones so I know where attackers are before I peek
---
What if I have a shotgun?
---
silence lmg user
---
Idk what the odds of this happening are but if you look closely one of my hockey pucks killed someone and both of the other two got stuck in the ceiling so I was completely fucked either way
---
Thanks. I just feel slower with an lmg maybe it's a mind trick
---
Tremendous
---
I think it might just be that lmgs are mainly on slower ops so they feel slower than the three speeds
---
Fr
---
Revert all the matches back between the days it was discovered and the ops were vaulted. It wouldn't be too hard. Its something that's somewhat fair to those who lost because of the glitches
---
Ok but why
---
...why, though?
---
A new attacker with a drone the size of a valk cam. It can scan but the operators dont appear at the top
---
That would be the most underpowered attacker
---
