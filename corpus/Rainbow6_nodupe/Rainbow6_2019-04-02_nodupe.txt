Tbh it was funny for me after wards because sometimes people say stuff like wow the random cost us that round single handedly. And in this case i did lose it for us by myselfüòÇ

Bartlett, Tower, Favela.
---
Yes please
---
Nope
---
I can imagine Mozzie going into a hard dive, convulsing a bit and Finka hits the nanos. Then Mozzie just puts a thumbs up into the air.
---
Favela, Chalet, Coastline
---
The only other place where I've seen this mysterious rectangle was on the forbidden land of Barlett.
---
They should do more set scenarios, like 1 different one a week or something.  With set ops, certain stipulations and different numbers of ops etc.

*I just got used to her recoil on acog*

Yep! Limited time tho, you gotta use mobile app i believe
---
I just grabbed my freebie pack and got the uniform for this.
---

---

---
What do you mean ? This is a plane in kid‚Äôs room

Idk about that since i haven't played much but my eyes are burning from all the colors 
---
New Zealand special forces 
---
Is it based on the Half Life intro?
---
i got into my first game as tachanka, looked at the hostage, put dont my turret and executed that furry degenerate.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
then got banned for tk
---
Which is why it was actually good, since it wasn't predictable 
---
This reminds me of MW2 in the best ways.
---
Were you the guy who made the Withstand thing the other day?
---
Is that the inside of his mouth and his tongue or his mustache and mouth
---
Physiological warefare 
---
Well that caught me off guard
---
Ubi should let you download the gamemodes so other people dont have to download them. For example my friend and I could download this plane map and play together until we uninstall the map. Just a suggestion
---
Is this on the Technical Test Tserver?
---
How do I get a second one
---
Imagine shooting someone's head and then dying only to see a pink blackboard staring right at you
---
New hereford, fortress, villa
---
No..? It‚Äôs just kids room but smaller
---
NEIN
---
*OwO*
---
It‚Äôs so gay but I love it, I‚Äôm confused. 
---
Then why post it?
---
Yes

No we don't. Guarantee this subreddit is flooded with people crying about not being able to tell where the head is

For one I thought you were on prone

For all maps: Favela, Tower and Themepark

For ranked maps: Themepark,Kafe and Fortress

For those Wondering that's 224 in freedom units
---
Drone skins! This is a great idea!!!
---
I fear no man, but that thing... it scares me
---
That is an amzing idea
---
You just run into the house, find the hostage (which is pretty easy you can tell where the hostage spawns by where the extraction zone is) Spawn APC, Operators like Lion, Finka, and Ash help a great deal, Thermite if you have a 4th and the 5th can be almost anything. Then you just rush in and get out with about 60-80 seconds on the clock. Done on normal difficulty, harder difficulties are not worth the effort nor time for the extra renown.
---
they could've at least used Cyrillic –¢–ê–ß–ê–ù–ö–ê
---
Thank you SO much!
---
What does the shield say?
---
I WANT THEM ALL
---
From dammit to dam
---
Did they stretch a 24x24 icon and then try tattooing it?
---
Coconut brah be on this shit like

Papillons
---
Smoke is pretty heavily picked in ranked (and pro league as well) as far as ive seen. But yeah Mute needs more cool shit
---
You should feel embarrased if you think R6 is a mil sim spec ops tacticool game.
---
Its not. Its CSGO with memes and breakable walls. 
---
Want milsim then play Arma.
---
"You dumb bitch."
---
Shitty dress charm
---
Holy heck, do you have an aimbot enabled?!? That aim was insane! I have like 400 hours and get like 1 or 2 kills a game, how do you get so good at that?
---
ive had the same problem because i bought the game via steam. The only way it worked for me was to buy a steam card and load up 20 bucks into my steam wallet.
---
You sir. Are a legend. Thank you

Even the drones are saying ‚ÄúOwO whats this?‚Äù

Right president actually

Heavy brigading by trump boot lickers

When I used Mav I‚Äôd always run the .50 cal AR-15 over his M4. I just preferred the feel of it.
---
god???
---
And there are furries
---
I wonder if their is an Easter egg if you shoot all the flowers 
---
You must be young
---
none of the r6 operators exist what's your point
---
Most definitely 
---
&gt; Not trying to act like a bummed out old ass at all, but there will be a point (in my opinion) where the game looks way too silly for its own genre.
---
Its genre is that Rainbow six is a training simulator. Emphasis on *training.* Its essentially the matrix, or super good VR. Therefore any character you play as does not exist in the "real" world. 
---
So the chosen avatar in the game can be anything. It makes perfect sense for them to fuck around and add weird skins like these since its a game. 
---
Even more so as its a game, in a game.
---
They are fun. If you dont like them then dont buy nor use them. You cant tell me that you cannot handle to just look at them once in a while.
---
No kidding, they're like roaches
---
I thought it was gonna show it into an April fools version with all the bears and unicorns 
---
come to think of it Team Rainbow doesn't exist either 
---
What do you mean "it worked for ash"? I still see her almost every round, and still uses r4c more than g36

Knowing my luck this isn't Australian
---
And they still think they have skill
---
Lol I agree I'm plat now underserved plat but if you cant adapte to the aggressive push or spawn peeks then you lack map knowledge that's all there is to it .
---
You can counter alot and sometimes the guy is just better has more veteran experience map smart players . A team that communicates well vs a team of bots or kill hungry risky players will most of the time win regardless of there gun skill.

1 of 2 things, too many people want unicorn tachanka, or April Fools no skins for you

Heh nothin personell kid I just checked your HISTORY... BTFO try again next time!!!

What happened in the end?

April 1st-8th
---
We can‚Äôt fucking gas the furries if smoke is a furry!
---
I spent the first minutes laughing my ass off at smoke 
---
It burns my eyes.
---
Yes it is, it has damage states, the entire concept of ‚Äúleveloution‚Äù is scripted, it‚Äôs a range from 1-100 where 1 is not damaged and 100 is most damaged, large objects that actually affect gameplay have zero procedural destruction, procedural destruction means there is no scripting things never break the same way twice... 
---
Please learn what you are talking about and read the design docs of Rainbow Six Siege, it‚Äôs system is not found in another game working in the same way 
---
Same

I mute these people. I turn off text chat as well. Generally if it doesn‚Äôt give them the attention they want, they give up.

That is the exact same thing that he happened to me... like exactly. I just play thatcher or thermite.

No, I‚Äôm saying people like that who do that could be a lot more useful if people could suggest them an operator that might better help 
---
People with a majority opinion over your own,  BRIGADE
---
I hope people won‚Äôt downvote me. But that‚Äôs not the point. 
---
What‚Äôs important is that everyone knows and should agree that Donald Trump is stupid, racist, sexist and many other things and the united states is one of the leading countries and they should be an example for the others. By having this president it proves that either 1. people agree with a stupid, racist, sexist orange man or 2. the current system which elect president is trash. [During the election of 2016, Hillary Clinton had more people voting for her than for Donald Trump which is very stupid when you know that almost all the stats who voted for Donald Trump are in the center which is were the majority of the uneducated population is.]
---
And I assume that all the people who are going to downvotes this comment don‚Äôt agree with me so I presume that they are ok with a stupid, racist, sexist president.
---
I got bored and went out of the room to let them win.

So? I don't give a shit. Stop nitpicking if its not gonna be regarding my point of them not being objectively comparable. Stop arguing with people over the internet about what game you like more.
---
After April 8th when the events end, will the skins like the pink Monty still be available for R6 Credit or Renown? I am a sole Monty main and he is my favorite op, but I am only 15 and don‚Äôt have the money to throw into packs, so I was hoping I won‚Äôt have to rush to save up for like 10 packs
---
Kk thanks God. üòÆüòÆ

It took me a sec, but then i noticed the muzzle brake "Stop it, get some help."

that still leaves the problem with teamkilling sadly enough

Thx bro this is my new lock screen

Completely false, even army Generals will tell you that.

&gt; Him and his administration had added 2.4 million jobs

'Trump often inflates the number of jobs created under his presidency by counting election day rather than when he took the oath of office. There have been about 1.8 million jobs created since January 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That‚Äôs the slowest gain in jobs since 2010, which indicates how well job growth was going before Trump took office.' - https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/trump-white-house/fact-checking-and-analysis-of-trumps-state-of-the-union-2018-address/fact-check-2-4-million-jobs/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.64b67c4823a2

Thanks to Obama's 8 years in office

Also mnk players are so mostly  bad I have had very rare experience in even noticing the bots using them cuz me or a team usually kill them on there run outs or spawn peeks lmao.

As someone who has mild red/green colour blindness I can confirm this.

&gt;the entire concept of ‚Äúleveloution‚Äù is scripted
---
We're not talking about "leveloution" dummy. Try and keep up.
---
Game knowledge and chat...
---
Damn. Ok. So I didn't realize that sparking conversation was so awful. My bad.
---
that is not at all how that works
---
I just thought this was the funniest update :)
---
Not worth it... She is a 2 s 2 a operator
---
They‚Äôre removed from ranked.

Fetishes have no place in Siege. This shit is disgusting.

Here is the liquipedia which is basically the wikipedia of eSports, it has the schedule for events, info on teams and players, and results.

PS: I would suggest you get the mobile app 'Strafe' which gives you the schedule of R6 eSports and it also lets you bet strafe points on matches. And you can follow all of your favorite teams so that you can get alerts on their matches and results.

Are you the dude on insta that makes all these?
---
It was destructible until it had the shield
---
Where?
---
It's on for a week I think. Give it a go 
---
This is good to how Ubisoft trying to fix player behavior. Keep this event for entire time
---
Wow thanks man
---
üò≠ I know the feeling to much. 
---
Is
---
is their plan to get rid of all the acogs on attacking side for the operators that are used a lot so that we pick others?
---
wait what skin is it
---
The camera was repositioned to the center of the character‚Äôs head instead of the right side.  It helps reduce quick peeks.
---
Wants
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
No problem let me know if you have any other questions! 
---
I know, I'm referring to causal. I don't want night maps out of the game for everyone but I would like the ability to chose whether I play on day maps or night maps. 
---
If you are still confused, idk if you have seen other comments that pointed it out within the time of you replying, but it‚Äôs the fact that there is an actual door in the door way of kids room instead of the empty space that we put the reinforcements on!
---
Are they selling these skins? If so, how long cuz I'm at work till after midnight üò≠
---
Fucking Fat Bodies?  In my Corps???  REEEEEEEEEE
---
what

Ill be sure to, thanks üôèüèæ

Endless laughter.

Your grammar is the bestest operator
---
But depends on the situation and map

You can shoot through almost all the walls of the enemy team is securing the area

Being an ass doesn't change the point that you posted a video of you filming a screen.

I‚Äôm currently waiting out my 30 minute TK ban because I couldn‚Äôt resist the urge to kill a furry

__Wait on roof till they run out and clap them if your team is unreliable and die in 5 seconds of hard run outs and spawn peaks .__

Well yeah all you gotta do is look it up.

Or the gun is great without ACOG and probably doesn‚Äôt need it
---
Oh and this is the [R6 Pro League Subreddit] (https://old.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/) which has constant discussion, memes, and posts about matches.
---
i‚Äôm not arguing that. they also took it from the r4c does that mean that this is their plan?
---
1 week for the event and 2 weeks for the packs
---
Is this the one and only @pro_league.alibi üò≥
---
The R6 Esports twitter and @ESLRainbowSix on twitter is even better IMO. Liquipedia is also good 
---
How tf
---
If you watch a siege YouTube called Coreross he showed leaks for the event about a month ago 
---
There have been a lot of major changes between different versions of the game (cod, csgo, r6 etc) but only a handful of games will do major changes like how the bullet physics works after the game has been released, especially 4 years after release. 
---
&gt; its not even that big of a change
---
Its a core gameplay change which affect everything in the game from TTK, damage physics and destruction. You cant just type in bulletphysic=projectile, its a major change that will take months of work. 
---
Also changing the bullets to projectile will not automatically fix hitreg issues because hitreg is not only issues with the hitscan, even on games with projectile bullets have hitreg issues due to network, netcode, hitbox and other issues.     
---
Also i dont see how changing it to projectile bullets will stop spawn peeks. 
---
thats actually amazing
---
Surely you don‚Äôt play on console 
---
I‚Äôve been playing exclusively this map for hours and I feel like I‚Äôm insane now
---
Mira? 
---
Hey life is already waaay realisitc. Let games be ridiculous... Like its cool to be cool sometimes.
---
That‚Äôs how they plan on nerving op guns I guess 
---
I feel if you have a high pick rate and your win rate is also high say goodbye to your acog if you got one
---
Didn't not expect that, hilarious. 
---
Yesss
---
Oh my god I saw someone comment door and I just thought well no shit Sherlock there‚Äôs a door. Fuck me in dense 
---
You know what they say about big bones?

Big nukes.

I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre trying to stop that but it amazes me how they always mess something else up when trying to do good

Now that‚Äôs just unfair.

No, the hostage is a furry. Still love the game all the same.

Downed hostage 2 times and no kick, it only bans if you kill him, or at least for me
---
It trully is
---
It reboots instantly as soon as a game would normally appear it reboots but watching Hulu YouTube it is fine
---
The other funniest update was when they removed jaegers and bandits acogs, but that soon turned out to be harsh reality instead of a late aprils fools
---
What do you think i should do to the smg 
---
The first gun may as well be the most over powered gun in the game wtf
---
Acog, good damage, and 1200 rpm? Hell no
---
Someone said it‚Äôll last 6 days

I‚Äôm sure if she was a real person she would be so enamored by your heroics, sir gallahad

See you in the Fall!

What should the damage or rpm be

Acid can most certinately make you hallucinate

Yeah sorry about that im changing it

Sadly I can't draw with colors.

Ya Zarya is actually jacked looking, Grid just looks, big lol

Honestly they put so much work and effort into it, I'd be surprised if they don't ever use it again.

If I could keep one thing, I want that announcer for all my future games.

I don't even spot the enemies, there are only 6 ops. 
---
He looks so damn sad.
---
That‚Äôs not what he was asking but okay üòÇ
---
For anyone wondering that would place her BMI at about 33 (32.6 kg/m^2). The limit for being overweight is ussually anything above 25.
---
Have you heard the mom in the background of the map? It‚Äôs a really cool touch to it
---
Kinda reduces peaked advantage I guess. That‚Äôs neat I think
---
I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre referring to rule 1 of the subreddit which is to post to only post relevant links related to siege
---
I don't know what happened with Outbreak but it was buggy, I think I heard someone say once that Ubisoft wasn't going to do something like it again, but I have no sources so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Gridlock is visibly fat,whereas sledge isn‚Äôt (be it his uniform or the fact that he actually isn‚Äôt fat).I ain‚Äôt got nothing against her presence in Rainbow,but honestly she doesn‚Äôt seem fit enough to be in that kind of unit (considering she‚Äôs an Australian SAS).
---
And here we go with drone customization 
---
2lbs of fat is 1lb of muscle.
---
damn the things you read on reddit lmao.
---
Announcer read operator lines: "make the room stronger" castle said
---
This ain‚Äôt tf2
---
Recruit is a madlad for sure. Shield, .45, frags, breaches. He can singlehandedly tell any castle anywhere to eat his ass from the safety of his shield window. 
---
Bonus: If you die, it‚Äôs cuz you were recruit. If you get a kill then omfg they‚Äôre so bad you killed them as recruit lol
---
Voice:"Mr. Bear died due to Stitch related injuries"
---
Me: 0w0 0w0 0w0 0w0 0w0 OWO!!!!!
---
This made me bust a fat nut
---
Not really the game explains what is happening when you first open it...
---
Oh...
---
I was literally in a game where it was overtime match point and this faggot bandit decides to kill the hostage.
---
He means, the fluffy version, but with the right side left empty to use in other versions. Just the Ted.
---
Damn furrys they ruined r6 siege.
---
Or even bright colourd ones super ez to spot in hiding spots
---
We got to polularise this.
---
Why are they working on this stupid events just fucking fix the game and the load of bugs wtf is this shit
---
Bamboozled.
---
Boy he D U M M Y   T H I C C.
---
But Schwarzenegger specifically lost all fat for competition. Better comparison would be weight lifters.
---
This is peak sweat
---
New divison tek is really impressive. Needs more work though.
---
Legendary 
---
Mr.hummus's promblem was the lag between the gameplay and the zoomed area not the zoom itself, this setup however doesn't suffer from lag
---
I got an ace the first time i played this mode. 
---
Then i woke up
---
DAAAAMN BOI HE THICC!
---
If youre really creative you can get sick hiding spots
---
That's the point. They are taking maps out to rework them.
---
There's countries who use the metric system and then there's countries with a flag on the moon.
---
That's what i thought. Thanks! 
---
It is weird that i like it more than the normal announcer,
---
aslo when the guy says "find the bomb" I hear "find the bum" AND it also makes me kinda angry because he says "bomb" and not "bombs"
---
tbf the issue is when people are hiding the drones to prevent you from getting the drone kills which is what op is trying to point out. 
---
The real question is can we get the 40 drone destroy before we get bored/angry with the map? lol
---
Could you please explain to me? I'm new at this game. So in between still learning maps, I'm also still devolving a tactical sense. Don't re-enforce what on this map? And what's this about kid's bedroom? Where should I be re-enforcing on House? Sorry to ask for quite a bit, but I'd really be a great favor if this was explained. 
---
**SHINDEIRU**
---
ITS YOUR TURN TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH!
---
Actually thought it was background noise from someones mic the first time. 
---
Furries are tragic
---
Yea. I got the gays from playing this as well. 
---

---
Cause a lot of it is fat and assuming you're the usual demographic of Reddit you're around 20 something. That means if you're tall you're gonna look noodly. And she is not noodly by any means, unless you mean a gnocchi or ravioli
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

one woman in the game being bigger than you're used to doesn't constitute "pc overlords" controlling all representation of women. we got all the other women in the game looking exactly how men want em to look
---
You've changed mine 
---
I'll never play twitch again if they do. I love playing her but already I think she needs a buff not a nerf. Her previous nerf was well justified but now with the amount of electronic gadgets increased in the game, the drones are too weak. And it takes 1 bullet to destroy them, you lose both drones without firing a taser (happens more often than I'd like) and twitches gun with acog is the only saving grace of picking her. 
---
Doesn't happen in the big boy game mode. 
---
Not gonna lie, Smokes entire set is litty
---
Lol
---
To dude I a actually tough this was the real Kaid or something like a 4k image of in game Kaid or something idek
---
Imagin that all is a playground, no one exist, is a imagination of a kid, and his sister take his toys and pain it like it was everything beautiful. But IDK just a theory.
---
Update for April fools, all week long. Look the top post 
---
F
---
Everybody: Oh hey New update
---
Ubisoft:*removed acock*
---
Everybody:Why?
---
Ubisoft: iT Is tOO OveR pOWeRd. 
---
You forgot to include region. 
---
Pegi 18 lol
---
its so funny i forgot to laugh
---
[removed]
---
But that's working on the actual game, Ubi can't have that
---
BMI = 32.14.         
---
Individuals with a BMI of 30-34.99 are in a physically unhealthy condition, which puts them at risk for serious ilnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, gall bladder disease, and some cancers.
---
Uninstall then. 
---
I think I stand in the same place as you, I main twitch on attack but if acog was taken from the f2 I‚Äôd probably go back to hibana or sledge.
---
I really hope that‚Äôs a joke
---
vote to kick was not unanimous
---
Lol all the silvers crying because they can't get kills without an acog
---
You need to change your sens üòÇ it's tooooooooooo high man 
---
Considering it's all a Sim why not.
---
Valid enough, i love how you are thinking though
---
I gassed it with smoke and put a round of buckshot in his face, enjoyed my ban too. Fuck that stupid looking furry
---
In the new event we smol like the tiny cowboys and romans
---
Put this on Kaids scoped secondary for a super-scope spawnpeek 
---
Is it really your father? 
---
the point is, I am not in good physical shape which is generally a requirement for a spec ops team
---
You should post this on r/memeeconomy
---
Yea I agree about that 
---
My Conscience didnt let me do that, but if I can do it in new game mode, it does put a smile on my face .
---
This is an accurate depiction of how I was expecting the game to turn after the proposed censoring around the Asia expansion. Regret getting mad about it now
---
Geez, you seem like a proper cunt.
---
But hey good on you for defending the poor defenseless multi-billion dollar conglomerates' shitty business practices.
---
*An
---
Holy shit dude now you're making me paranoid 
---
:(
---
Yeah üòÖ
---
But it might be start there then extend to others üòÇ
---
As long as it's contained, in that one playlist that I can't play because it's too bright. 
---
I don't think Elite MVP animations work this time around, unfortunately.
---
I guess they're universal because my Tachanka charm is universal
---
Tactical, not realistic.
---
Thank You
---
Wait why is he so cheerful. He is still a hostage right. 
---
Happy Birthday, Thank You
---
So you collected the challenge on ubisoft club and you still got no pack?
---
Thank You :)
---
Yeah, people advocating for non-predatory business practices are idiots. Jesus fucking Christ you are thick. 
---
*S E Q U E N C E  I N I T I A T E D*
---
hehe
---
Thank You, Just got Tk‚Äôd on rank just now
---
Aren‚Äôt all charms universal?
---
I guess I can see it.
---
CSGO is very raw in a sense. Doesn't have a changing META and no real tactic vs tactic game.
---
Siege is very complex and has a higher skill curve and even to this day, new tactics are being made with the oldest operators on the oldest maps. Haven't seen anything new in CSGO in ages. Compared to Siege, it is very... simple?
---
Learn the maps and spray patterns, flashes and smokes and that's all you really need.
---
In siege, maps are super dynamic unlike GO where the maps aren't dynamic at all, the operator synergy, countering operators, countering various tactics and all the gadgets and layouts is what makes it complex. Every round is super different, but in CSGO, the tactics and how rounds play out are a lot more linear and  you can't surprise anyone much.
---
Bruh if your squad is up 3-0 last round, do you have any idea how much fun it is to run an operation with a super bright/loud/obnoxious skin and a shotty and lighting round it?
---
So that‚Äôs why it still is in ranked :)
---
Okay, this is epic
---
You‚Äôre deluded if you think Kafe is balanced 
---
Impact nade out! 
---
Anything in denial for their lack of skill
---
... Why would you point that out.
---
This challenge can only be done on the new April fools playlist, with that in mind the only operator on your list available to use in that playlist is bandit.
---
It's Australia.  What more could you possibly expect from them
---
I can‚Äôt shoot the shit out of you without getting closer.
---
Is it really that bad? I just expect to be run out on every round there so I wait for it.
---
Would you have rather them give us nothing at all. This is ENTIRELY cosmetic, and you get 2 (I think) packs for free, plus the game mode for a week 
---
We already get free DLC drops 4 times a year with 2 operators on each one that are available to everyone via renown, I don‚Äôt see a problem with using a business practice that probably makes them substantially more money than if you could just buy exactly what you wanted
---
When I was playing today I always told the defenders where I'd placed my drone so they could grab it before we tried to murder each other.
---
I've also heard "You are now free to reinforce the cabin"
---
You get someone else to take the picture
---
You get some else to hold the camera for you
---
I think all charms are universal. 
---
oh i thought it was supposed to be half life, reminded me of the train scene
---
Hostage seeking cluster charges are the future!
---
In overwatch you can earn event lootboxes via gameplay
---
That tbag though
---
Yeah bro i‚Äôm on dimond 
---
I had to see it so you guy have to see it too.  Im dragging you guys to hell with me
---
Hmmmm, casserole...
---
Permanent just like all other events
---
I got it too. There's no way I'm not wearing it 
---
Call me deluded, because I also have no problems with tower. It, in fact, is one of my favorite maps.
---
What is unbalanced about Kafe?
---
Pure meat shield
---
The ones you get out of the packs are permanent but any you don‚Äôt get out of packs during the events you won‚Äôt get 
---
I can't find a lobby on Xbox. 55+ minutes after restarting my game 4 times. 
---
Oh? Do you have to be outside the plane to hear it?
---
Make your thumb the thumbstick, THEN break it.
---
Oh really? I thought you were the joke.
---
These maps be in goofytown where professor hee hee is giving a lecture on clownin
---
Mrph mrph.
---
Ah okay, Thanks. Its my first r6 event üôà
---
The F2 isn't picked because it has an ACOG. It's picked because the other 2 guns are trash. 
---
Holy Fuck! 102kg is like 225 lbs. Gridlock is T H I C C.
---
Or just record and extract a clean frame. Much easier than trying to time a screenshot.
---
seig hail se fuher
---
Its gay as fuck, anyone who enjoys looking like a fuckass deserves there fucking throat pulled out via crane.
---
Was that a new trailer or something after the flashbang?
---
To start there‚Äôs the spawn peaking. Extremely limited vertical play.  Far too linear with one side of the map impossible to enter on. Run outs are stupid. There‚Äôs honestly very little that is balanced about the map. Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but you must be quite an amateur or casual player to enjoy all these maps and think they‚Äôre balanced.
---
Idiots, everyone knows she has kevlar surgecially weaved into her muscle fibres, that's why she's so light compared to her size.
---
Yes i looked there didn‚Äôt see it ... got the free pack though 
---
This is true
---
Siege hardcore? Doubt it.
---
Absolutely insane!
---
I got a skin for Blackbeard and I don't even own black beard
---
The only thing Battlefield 4 and 1 are really good for.
---
Dedsec has given you the truth. Do what you will.
---
Depends on playstyle, but my recommendation on the basis of a flex support on attack and Intel on defense would be:
---
Nomad&gt;mozzie&gt;kaid&gt;gridlock
---
Swap mozzie for kaid if you are an anchoring entry denial.
---
Mozzie first. 
---
Kaid
---
Nomad
---
Gridlock
---
Totally agree
---
Well if u wanna play the new operators its worth it unless u have a lot of renown
---
Lmfaooo
---
For finka mains,here is how you defeat them spawnpeekin enemies
---
Step 1:Use the LMG or AR if your good(basically anything with an acog and use the acog)
---
Step 2:Aim
---
Step 3:SPRAY AND PRAY
---
Step 4:Realise you didnt boost your team so they die
---
Step 5:Get kicked or TKd
---
Yes.
---
What if you use the magnifying glass with an ACOG Super ACOG
---
Nope.
---
'physical' cheating
---
Are you looking for ants, raise the right joystick a bit.
---
I really want any headgear from the packs except blackbeards but they are legendary and I got charms and there is no way I‚Äôm going to buy loot boxes.
---
Usually when doing this, publishers like to slap a big ole 2 on there and make you pay again. 
---
I'm good with the current, thanks.
---
Sounds like you need to go play arma, squad, or insurgency and leave us ‚Äònormies‚Äô alone lol.
---
I don't think there is a difference on the Drop Chance in the paid packs. But I could be wrong. If there is that would be even worse :/
---
I think if you're trying to hide as monty you're playing him wrong 
---
are u ok
---
There is. It‚Äôs still packs only no commons and uncommon. So charms are the most common then weapon skins then outfits and then headgeer
---
Who needs a working game, just make more events, woohoo!!!
---
And again, collection packs for REAL MONEY, pay to lose this time, but real money
---
It's a bit more than that.
---
it's also pretty damn defender sided, Plane is still a spawnpeeker's wet dream and attack doesn't get to bring Glaz to limit rotation like usual.
---
(also no Fuze, Fuze is surprisingly good on plane with all the destructible floors on F3)
---
Just look at the rarity
---
Never going to happen unless you can find a way for them to continue monatising it.
---
IRL cheats
---
It's a joke game mode, chill out.
---
I meant for memes for r/dankememes, I want to post but as soon as I got enough karma they did this stupid event.
---
Vertically filmed off a horizontal screen on a console that supports replays...
---
1. Kaid (his shotgun has huge meme value especially if it has a supressor)
---
2. Mozzie (his reload animation, obviously. Plus the super shortie provides reasonable meme value)
---
3. Gridlock (shotgun+lmg combo, who hasn't dreamed of that. Again the meme value for the shotgun and the lmg reload time is excellent)
---
4. Nomad (airjab provides great theoretical meme value combined with claymores, but it's hard to pull off)
---
But it depends on what you like to do and if you play ranked or casual. My ranking is probably not what you're looking for
---
*tips chanka unicorn helmet* my lady
---
Obese as fuck, interesting everyone gets triggered about this but not jokes about mozzies height. 
---
Its a joke mode, since when does that mean I cant play for the win?
---
I agree
---
"Please note that all ACOG's must be stored in the overhead bins prior to takeoff" -Press Section A Tannoy
---
Yes! Coincidentally I serve on one of those bases in northern Japan. (Feel free to ask questions if you're sceptical) We share an airbase with the JASDF. I'm just a maintainer and we don't interact with them to much though.
---
UpLoAf
---
And of course, I buy 2 packs and get smokes bundle... 
---
it took you way too long to finish it, bandit no longer has an acog XD
---
No no no, hostage seeking
---
I weight less than her and I know for a fact I could not do 80% of the shit in siege. So yes it‚Äôs a little jarring to see fat falbert sprinting down the hallway and jumping in/ out of windows. 
---
Put drones on common runouts
---
Happy birthday you don‚Äôt have to say thank you 
---
I mean I dont want to get to diamond from playing the most OP operator, our lord but for blackbeard it's a cool flex lol
---
Libtard spotted, engaging epic gamer moment
---
fuck trump
---
It's all muscle bruh
---
It doesn't, but why are you playing for the win in a joke game mode that was made for an event? If you want to win so bad, there's regular casual or ranked. Why try to win so much with all the limitations in the joke game mode? Not only does playing like that make life harder for everyone doing the challenge, but you potentially make yourself more frustrated because of the gimmicks and limitations in the joke mode.
---
5 years. Impressive! 
---
Yeah you may be right lol, what do you think of smoke and blackbeard? Does it even matter the color for blending in? 
---
How old was the boy?
---
"Anti-SJW", thats one weird way to spell "normal person".
---
*cyka blyat in russian*
---
Nah, GO EG
---
Far enough to hit Dave Rubins channel and think he‚Äôs an intellect 
---
What logic is this. 224 is 224. If its muscle, shes still 224. If its fat, still 224. Her character model doesnt have really any muscle definition though so i doubt she doesnt have a good portion of body fat. 
---
 
---
*equips ACOG with a magnifying glass*
---
X8 zoom bois
---
Actually yeah good point
---
The first one should have been the bear doing a pout face.
---
The best option in my opinion. 
---
Such adult much wow.
---
they\`ll will be adding more quest for that but there is already a quest in the game to destroy 40 drones upon completion of wich you will receive a free "rainbow is magic" pack.
---
^
---
Or you can just buy it thru r6 credits, if thats your thing.
---
Also is english your 2nd language?
---
I had to go get a juice box after my first game of this.
---
What did he say? I am curious now
---
I mean yeah it's cute, but I'll always love Mozzie impatiently stumbling around while Gridlock works on his motorcycle, being the kind soul that she is. 
---
I would love to it if I could play this in custom games year round. A lot of my friends have said the same about this and the other special modes.
---
You don‚Äôt but it is still a lot nicer. 
---
"I think I saw Luigi"
---
They are already normally black, just hid the red light and they‚Äôre pretty hard to see
---
Even if they didn't give up their own drones, I'm still giving up my own 
---
Am glad a have a full team of 7 members to play with 
---
I'm not a bad shot but for some reason I can never seem to hit my shots on plane runouts. 
---
The only way to win is not to play that game.  
---
For me at least
---
I assume that you didn't know that both lean and crouchspamming were patched in this season's update?
---
It's also in pyroland, not kids bedroom
---
Me :)
---
Improvise adapt overcome
---
lol that's great!
---
I'm still working on accepting it....
---
Imagine using this with the .44 mag
---
Your game probably won‚Äôt launch without a video card, and if it does, you‚Äôll get 10-20fps at best on lowest settings.
---
You need to destroy 40 drones OR buy them at 270 R6 credits a piece.
---
Pls gimme source, can't find it on R6 website.
---
200 iq
---
Can we keep this map for custom games pls ubi
---
Just sad the lords unicorn isn't based on balloonicorn
---
If u hadnt said awesome i would have presumed u were a middle aged englishman 
---
now for guns i'd like to see:
---
I definitely got a few guns i'd personally love to see, a lot of them are Russian bc i came up with them for a Tachanka rework:
---
1. KS-23M: 6.27gauge pump shotty.
---
2. OTs-62: 12 gauge shotgun revolver pistol.
---
3. APSB: Machine pistol with a very low RoF of only 650rpm and a 20 round magazine, would feel more like a UMP than it would a normal secondary smg.
---
4. some more SMG designs predating intermediate cartridge rifles (preferably with wooden body), Think Thompson SMG or PPSh-41, ie the kind of SMG's they don't really make nowadays because they're as heavy as an assault rifle. 
---
Hello miggle838, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b8iqs0/literally_unplayable_bullet_holes_arent_stars_smh/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
&gt;Insane Glaz advantage
---
I don't think I've seen a round where Glaz hasn't been run out on and been killed. 
---
Probably the best R6 fanart I've seen! You're very talented!
---
NAUTIC THE GOAT
---
People said road to invitational was the best event for r6.
---
I tell them "take some drugs, strap on your pyrovision googles and play kids bedroom"
---
&gt;theyre more noticeable
---
That's the issue. For example, let's look at some CBRN skins. [Here's Finka's silhouette,](https://i.imgur.com/KsuhRvQ.png) see how it's very clear that she's a CBRN operator due to the mask? Actually no, it's that other CBRN operator... [Hibana?](https://i.imgur.com/i88K2KH.png) She even has [this yellow outfit](https://i.imgur.com/3UaGgXd.png) to help cosplay as a CBRN operator.
---
[Here's Hibana,](https://i.imgur.com/CVTYUkQ.png) with her iconic hoodie. [Here's Thermite](https://i.imgur.com/0KIHO3D.png) without his iconic helmet, instead being replaced by a similar hoodie. That's not what Thermite looks like.
---
Cosmetics don't need to be removed, but they certainly serve as a hindrance to gameplay. A [simple solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b8h95t/this_game_needs_the_option_to_disable_cosmetics/ejxx6wd/) could be implemented to resolve this issue, while allowing those who don't mind to see cosmetics as normal.
---
Yessss, a SAS shotty skin. Awesome.
---
I missed it 
---
Just one problem.
---
Why isn't the motorcycle falling into the sky?
---
of course it's a disadvantage, i just mean it shouldn't be the thing you're expected to rely on to beat a shield operator. 
---
No they weren't. 
---
Wait is there no skins for cash/credits? I was gonna log on and buy some credits but if that‚Äôs the case.... no I don‚Äôt wana to pay for a chance to maybe get what I want
---
TK‚Äôs I can‚Äôt justify, but the spawn peeks and run outs just have to be expected. It‚Äôs a casual game mode and it‚Äôs on plane. You should just be expecting it. 
---
Tbh all I want is chankas head gear, maybe the body if I'm lucky. And that's about it
---
You have one of 17 chances to get that headgear, when you get a second pack you would have 2/17. 
---
Anyone has the same chances as you to get it unless they purchase more packs or the entire collection. It will only become "rare" after the event ends and the packs expire. From there it depends on how many people got it from their 2/17 chance and those who paid for the entire set with a 100 percent guarantee of having it. 
---
it happened on the mad house event too, it felt like i was playing ranked
---
No everyone get a random item from the pack you just got really lucky
---
How tf is hiding a drone ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù
---
Mr homeless?
---
With a unicorn lord Easter egg
---
why don't they remove the acog entirely from the game at this point
---
That last couple of seconds with thatcher looking around in the van would be a great setup for the main menu 
---
I know they talked about removing more acogs. But what's the point of leaking a very small part of some patch notes ? It doesn't make any sense. And it's just a black text on a white background
---
I did that too hahaha. With the (exact?) same set of clamps. Gave me a bad fucking headache though.
---
That's why I shot him.
---
Russian Special forces are programmed for it. [wikipedia Moscow\_theater\_hostage\_crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis)
---
I got tachanka‚Äôs
---
Theres also a nomad reference abt turbulence 
---
I tried the same months back, and I remember it gave me a really bad habit really quickly because you have to keep changing focus heavily.
---
Just restart the queue, been covered lots 
---
np cat
---
How?
---
Happy Birthday you sexy thang
---
It does bother me, actually. I don't get the change, it looked fine as it was.
---
That is legit nightmare fuel. Imaging getting popped by one of these guys.
---
Watching people play first person shooters on console hurts.
---
Yeah but Ubisoft club challenges have always been the same since launch 
---
Kind of looks like [Green Arrow](https://pm1.narvii.com/5937/012c77dc1ddf922792fc3a0082d6745def8fa071_hq.jpg) without his mask. Pretty cool!
---
But he did suffer from lag... Did you watch the whole video? He said it near the end.
---
Why wasn't it a spawnpeek?
---
Except doc, rook, echo, and to a lesser extent kaid.
---
The face changes to Hibana make her look like a missing link ape.
---
Luckily, I have the Elite skin. So I don‚Äôt have to deal with that.
---
They do match by mmr in competitive modes (and in casual). Fuck knows about the new one.
---
No
---
How what why
---
Just remember: there's a whole map outside of the objective.
---
Staying static on the objective makes you predictable, moving all over the map does not.
---
Makes me think of the reputation system in For Honor where your characters level up and once you hit what should be level 21 you get put at rep 1 level 1 and such.
---
shh
---
Nice
---
if you don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt play it. simple as that. they made a mode that‚Äôs funny and different for a week. nobody is making you play it. just uninstall the game then 
---
What part about this event is bad?
---
Whatever drugs Ubi devs were taking when they came up with this they need to keep taking.
---
Except at least at launch you could use recruit for the operator force specific ones. Now they changed it to specific operators so you cant use recruit if you dont own an operator
---
Oof that‚Äôs rough
---
Imma get banned for killing the hostage üò¢
---
It's certainly the most polarizing game choice they've made. But as a limited event, that's but much of a nail for a coffin. 
---
It‚Äôs most likely fake considering there are no new patch notes pinned on the sub
---
Even then I somehow manage to die from a nitro thrown two lightyears
---
Noice
---
I kill the hostage every single time I see "it" cry
---
Y'all noticed it's the damn Kids room on house 
---
Yeah I love this event
---
hAhA dAe LoRd TaChAnKa??? XD dae German man have no scope too ecks dee? ela thicc har har Australia man short xDDDDDD
---
Wizard Whistle is A Doc main. 
---
Yeah if only there was idk... A season pass that gave you limited things so it was more of a "support the game" than pay for shit type deal.
---
Would be much better than a gambling box
---
Hey sometimes when I try and win I'm not a sweat but a "haxxor"
---
I haven‚Äôt actually lol. But I did hear a pilot over the intercom say something like ‚Äúthis is a no smoking flight, sorry smoke!‚Äù 
---
Yeah I think it would add another thing to work towards like be the highest level ____ of your friends or get that operator max level (if there is one) and you could get exclusive outfits for reaching a certain level just like for honor 
---
what is that bandit doing....lmao
---
Thatsthejoke.jpeg
---
So taking away a scope wont make the gun worse, it's still powerful, those terrible "nerfs"
---
I can't be the only one seeing a nazi salute...
---
Or it was just forced and unfunny
---
Oh you right
---
Thank you. Sadly I get accused of ping abusing all the time. My Arma 2 squad is mostly European while I am American, but I enjoy playing with them. I find it a disadvantage to anchor but I do main 3 armors so you can guess my role. Simple rule to counter ping abuse, peek them first, you likely have a 100+ ms advantage.
---
when ur at big window whats the one thing you always wall bang?
---
It was an April fools joke technically speaking, but they have mentioned in the past that Twitch would potentially be their next concern with acogs if removing it from Ashes R4-C went well, so I wouldn't be surprised if it came true eventually...
---
It should be that we roll for it after a game like alpha packs, just make them a little bit rarer since theyre limited 
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people get kills. I can‚Äôt for the life of me see the opponents further away than 5 meters. 
---
Well i started and looked up the challenge i thought its overall (ranked included) but its only event and normal :)
---
And its a giant damn joke. I cant wait to jump into my next game of fortcodnite.
---
I have black ice on Thermites AR and my best friend is a Thermite main and I wanna give him the skin but I can't sadly
---
I got Monty's outfit :(
---
We are talking about the event.
---
Yeah
---
Not to defend Csgo loot boxes but they don't ruin the game's theme or have any impact on gameplay. 
---
As for the pricing you can literally cash out your items. It's not like you pay $800 and that all goes to valve it goes to another person for the most part and you can then cash that out yourself.
---
Exactly.
---
However, the controversy is that it has been fixed. A pro and some top streamers say that it has been fixed and it is always a disadvantage, but CERTAIN pics say otherwise.
---
The best way to sum it up is in Varsity Gaming's words: "high ping is a disadvantage. It's only really an advantage when you rush hard and play fast" (not 100% his wordings, but it's as close as it gets).
---
Im just pointing out its not just about weight. Obviously gender is playing into it in the disparaging comments. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
It said that in the notes? Really?
---
Can i get some F's in chat cuz i can't play the new event
---
If the elite had a t-shirt and bandit had hair, it might have been good. Not to mention how round his beard is.
---
I like some of the DMRs I think Buck is a really good example of how to do it right, there are some maps (Bank I‚Äôm particular) where I‚Äôll take the FAL over his C8 but I feel like it should be like that with twitch. They don‚Äôt need to buff the 417 to god tear but idk some more ammo in the clip or maybe a teeny bit more damage and for me personally I would take it over the F2 in some situations 
---
It's really nice
---
I agree 
---
Dew it
---
*selects tachanka*
---
Yea i miss the old on small simple and it was amazing
---
My name says American because i'm less likely to be identified by friends looking for my reddit account this way.
---
Jeg er egentlig Norsk, hva faen gutta.. 
---
Aww, thanks! I really appreciate that 
---
Event is only active for 5ish more days, no point really.
---
Like who? The attack lineup is pretty solid, you've got buck, jackal, zofia, capitao, IQ, ash, thermite, hibana, maverick. Really the only bad guns are BBs, and they're still serviceable, and he tanks headshots so he'd OP anyways, even nomad's guns are alright. 
---
If Im attacking, Id wallbang thru wats open. Doesnt matter if left-most or right-most is open.
---
If Im defending, Im not standing right behind hole in the wall cuz I know its easy wallbang kill for the attacker.
---
More people need to know about this
---
They put it up on a patch note, but idk someone said it was an April fools prank so I could have just been doooped, a friend sent me a screen shot of the patch note 
---
Flair
---
Mozzie is a counter to her gadget yeah but not her weapons 
---
I wish people I played with were this nice
---
(recruit is 3 speed....)
---
On attack, you've got monty and fuze, and  now gridlock. (Tbh tho lion should have been 1 speed)
---
Really? Then damn I got duped lol
---
Man, I can't put into words how much I love this event. GG Ubi
---
I agree with Lion. Spetsnaz recruit is 1 speed as well
---
kapkan's EDD traps are door-mounted claymores, don't think they're war-crime worthy
---
sweaty
---
The only games you can play without ps+ online is the free games like fortnite, apex and whatever other free games there are
---
You can rappel next to big window and look through the far right rotate hole into the Kids bedroom site. 
---
You put it in the middle so they cannot do that.

**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**
---
Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
Id say Jackal because you can hunt roamers and other enemies down and get the kill, or Maverick because you can burn holes into the objective and clear them out without anyone knowing 
---
I think it's more a testament of how bad some spawns are. Certain maps have spawns that either completely screw you because of limited movement (For example, water spawn at Cafe or the garage spawn at House) or spawns that an attacker can rush to way too easily (For example, uphill spawn on Border or alleyway in Bank). And while I agree that the game will always be about learning all the spots, tactics and tricks, I feel like these kind of quick and easy spawn rushes aren't really in the spirit of the game because the match hasn't even really started yet. If there are spawns that you 'shouldn't have chosen anyway', my question is why they're in the game at all.
---
Spawn peeking is legit, but I feel like spawn rushing how it is now shouldn't be possible. You should at least be revealed by the time you reach an attacker's spawn.
---
this is beautiful
---
This is his like default outfit though he just took of the helmet....
---
Jackal
---
The music is awesome too
---
R6 is the most toxic community in a game I have played on PC. Goodluck dude.
---
They should keep his hairs in his elite uniform man think of the bandit mains 
---
Why tho
---
LiKe IF ThEY ShOuLD PuT A TaChAncKa ELiTe SkIn

Rainbow devs are furries confirmed 
---
Your yeet turned into a Kobe midair lmao
---
If you'd do it in ranked, yeah. You are trying. Thats fine, but there are other people who aren't in ranked for a reason. 
---
You play ranked because you enjoy the challenge.
---
I don't because I prefer to play the game, not be 360 No-scope Y-Y'd by XxPapaSmurfxX #3154 so i can spectate the rest of the round.
---
Yeah, maybe I'm shit. Doesn't change the fact that I prefer to play casually and get the challenge done, not play Hide and Seek simulator 2020 because MnKAshMain wants to get that sick 720 one deag through a wall on a copper after droning.
---
I only played a bit, but on ps4 yesterday the sweatys were out in force. Voting to kick anyone that was last man. Which normally happens from time to time, but not as bad as this. And tking (mostly on the enemy team). Which I thought had gotten better but... IDK. That kind of behavior comes across as super sweaty try hard. This community used to be so much better...
---
Well, maybe not "so much" but at least a bit.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just wondering why they don‚Äôt go to ranked if they want that lol
---
Hello rafahmoreira, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b8lqr8/i_loved_my_little_princess/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
First video upload! Hope you guys like it!

Surprise, surprise, the maps were always there, you were able to and still are able to play them in Terrorist Hunt.
---
LiKe If ThEY ShOuLd PuT a ReCrUiT eLiTe SkIn
---
What rank would top 5% be? That‚Äôs pretty much my goal in any game I play. Idk how big diamond is playerbase wise. 
---
From what I've noticed the attackers are being stingy with their drones. I throw mine at them to make it easier. 
---
At first I actually thought this was The Mean Greens for some dumb reason
---
Happy Birthday, play well and I wish you luck
---
I like thermite to though because of the MVP animation
---
Is there any word on the Voice Chat bug? Sometimes after a couple games your voice chat stops working and you can no longer here others or use voice chat yourself until a restart of the game. A couple friends and I all experience this while playing together frequently.
---
Probably because it‚Äôs a video game, a 1 speed 1 armour would be absolutely worthless 
---
What is this game becoming? 
---
This isn't the Mid-Season Balancing patch right? Seeing as there are no balancing changes here.
---
Will 1.3 be the Mid-Season patch?
---
You don't need hardware or editing skills, just put your clip and then the Skyrim clip. You could use Windows Movie Maker for that shit :P
---
Nice for you .... if really want to see that 
---
no mouse and keyboard I use a controller 
---
Well you can get only 2 so you have to buy 14 others nonetheless if you don't get your preferred item 
---
I'm only one who thinks that lion nerfed too much? He definitely deserved the nefr, but not that much.
---
&gt; They already tried the latter, I think. It is implemented into the game, the same way you can turn off secure area and hostage, but as far as I can tell, it doesn‚Äôt work at all.
---
It was included in launch but never really worked.  After several patches they removed it because it wasn't working.  Today, the only map queuing you can select is for terrorist hunt, which as far as I can tell does work.
---
&gt; Honestly I only think your map problem might happen at high high elo, around high platinum/diamond area and also even then only if they‚Äôre in a 5 stack. 
---
It's human nature.  The maps that are chosen might change based on MMR, but there will still exist a small set of "meta" maps for the rank you're queuing into that will invariably take over the queue.
---
I choose him because I play him a lot and the elite is cool
---
Goobi knew what they were doing. They know how many people get 20 drones for the birthday charms and they increase the drones required so that most people won't get the pack. Its just so that you'll be forced to spend $$$ to maybe get what you want.
---
It should be ops playing with the toy plane in kids room
---
I think maybe drone hunt would be a better alternative
---
So summer?
---
Any team based game in general. 
---
Okay yes, but I‚Äôm also not saying you can‚Äôt spawn peak that is totally cool. Holding an angle from inside the building to prevent people from approaching makes total sense. Running out doesn‚Äôt. People run out all the time I wait 5 second while I‚Äôm checking other places I can get peaked from, then boom runout and die. Sure I remember it and I know it‚Äôs a thing It‚Äôs not like someone is beating a dead horse on this I learn, but when I have 4-5 different peaks to check. I can‚Äôt drone them all. I don‚Äôt just run to the building willie nillie. I just feel like the detection delay should be removed. I don‚Äôt think it would be fair if you died because of it, but I think running out should be nerfed some.
---
Dude me and my buddy had this exact same idea and i think its the way to go. People of course would riot over their precious ACOGS but i think it would balance it nicely
---
If it's like Garry's mod prop hunt, I think that'd be fun, but if it were to be like the COD prop hunt then oh god no that would be terrible üòÇ
---
Lol salty kid got spawnpeeked
---
Almost every gun in the game has great one for shot good recoil
---
To be honest, I'm not that salty about it. They have to keep making money to continue supporting the game the way they do, and the only way the devs could justify this update to the suits would be if they could sell a bunch of loot boxes
---
You say that while providing no evidence or argument to back your outrageous claims. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what you were trying to say there, but did you seriously come across 20 games where the attacking side hid their drones the whole game?
---
It sounds like it could be fun but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the type of thing siege would do
---
Yah man it just seems so cool a fucking armor pen gun with low rate of fire but literally no sound.
---
They just basically want your money which in some ways is understandable to keep their wages paid  
---
why are you climbing the ladder when you can repel and shoot back?
---
I want furry smoke
---
I kinda understand what you mean but the at the same time nah. 
---
This is allowed but not memes?
---
Yes, I wouldn't have made this post if it didn't happen.
---
That would work sence the gun does lots of damage. And has armor pen up to 30 layes of Kevlar using sp-6
---
D R U G Z
---
I don't know about that, you've seen the new event right?
---
I love it when the opposing team just plays along when I am fucking around with my drone.
---
Also your voice is fine.
---
I like the initial spawnpeek challenge. Kicks the round off as an attacker proper. It‚Äôs easy to pre aim the typical spots for run out on Plane when you spawn.
---
In reality yes, I would agree if we are going with realism. But I understand it‚Äôs a game and people wouldn‚Äôt be able to contest window angles without it, so I get why we wouldn‚Äôt be able to implement that.
---
There bright neon colors how can you not see them.
---
10/10 would main
---
I do it as well
---
Dude do some research on the electoral voting system, seriously. Hopefully then you will understand why we use one over the other. 
---
No one would have complained if Hillary would have won electoral and lost popular. Those are the rules. It‚Äôs not like the left thought we were doing popular votes, they knew it was electorally based which is why presidential nominees will always campaign in different states. 
---
Yea
---
I want that headgear, but I got Montagne's shield so I'm not salty
---
Still no lion rework :)
---
Lol, dude. What are you smoking?
---
I only want the chanka uniform to complete the meme but I'd be fine without it 
---
Yah, it's considered always on which means any slight movements register. Unplug it, that was the only solution I found. Just dont unplug while in game, it takes like 5mins to unfreeze.
---
It would either be what you‚Äôre saying, or you‚Äôd see teams pick the lesser played maps since the meta maps would be so popular that everyone would have strats for them.
---
I guess what really prompted this is the fact that Ubi spent lord knows how long developing a reskin  of plane for ~~April Fool‚Äôs Day~~ ^alphapacksales instead of putting that same time into making maps like Yacht or Favela more suitable for ranked play. I know that is a hard task, but they clearly put a huge amount of effort into this week long event too.
---
Fixed ‚Äì Mute‚Äôs Elite has missing SFX for his Jammers.
---
umm? mute elite's jammers have no sound now, wtf? plus i didn't even know mute elite jammers had different sfx, wut?
---
I think this definitely could work, but I wish the people who disagreed with it would actually say why as opposed to just saying no.
---
There‚Äôs a whole map but for me to utilize it I have to leave my spawn and actually get a chance to approach the building/important part of the map.
---
literally everything is bright neon colors what do you mean lmao
---
Shields in general are unbalanced; in a low-TTK fps like Siege where information is everything invulnerability has no place. Monty in particular is overpowered, he provides enormous amounts of intel and utility for little to no risk. 
---
Idk dude, hiding drones is a basic and easy enough part of the gane that people who haven‚Äôt even made it high enough to be in ranked do it
---
Because shield man bad BabyRage, that's literally all these morons can come up with
---
I'd prefer uniforms WAYY over the charms, I already got the rainbow tachanka charm from the gift pack.
---
Blackbeard is the prettiest girl alive 
---
Change my mind 
---
Took me four hours just for an ugly butterfly charm oof, would of been a lot fadter if it werent for all the trolls leaving their drones in spawn and driving into the  map borders.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. My friends and I spend 40+ dollars on this game per year and have put over a thousand hours in each. They‚Äôre about to lose at least 10 of us. Apex legends here we come... fml
---
&gt; Our focus for 1.2 is to target any lingering bugs or issues.
---
Literally second sentence in the patch notes.
---
got at least two kapkan kills yesterday
---
Just siege things
---
Cavs that don‚Äôt reinforce need to stop playing siege
---
Fix shields and fix sounds. Game breaking bugs should be fixed first, please prioritize accordingly
---
4 hours for me, my log in pack was the paw charm, drone pack was butterfly :( I just want my chanka hat.
---
Tell Robbie he‚Äôs a headass 
---
EWWW

...nice....aim

Hello Seth-J-B! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
I got TK'd three times in 2 matches. The first match was because some asshole was trying to block me in that small room on plane, so I shotgunned him so I could get out.
---
The second and third time? No clue. One time I was setting up a castle barricade, the other was immediately after spawning.
---
Only the one challenge
---
Bb confirmed drag queen
---
Ngl. I honestly would sit and watch the damage instead of helping
---
Yep same here I bought em for gridlock too and they are all completely missing 
---
This x1000
---
Literally makes ranked unplayable
---
The recruit with the fork by the electrical socket just made my day 
---
Attackers - Finka, Hibana, Thatcher 
---
Defenders - Lesion, Frost, Echo
---
I got the dress charm üëóüíÉ
---
i forgot what that means say
---
i remember now its"HAX" hahahaha
---
but still its funny to improvise hahaha
---
Whenever I see anyone with these new skins I leave match immediately, I'm not into playing with disabled people
---
 The only way to get them is do challenges or buy them, unfortunately. You would only get another free one if you would do the challenge.
---
I got montys shield skin
---
r/foundtheretard
---
When the options are:
---
1. Hide your drone for later use to play well
---
Or
---
2. Let the opponent get your drone so they get closer to the free pack
---
And you pick 1, valuing your temporary satisfaction above their permanent pack, you are sweaty.
---
In casual? Nah, thats fine to hide your drone. No reason to give it to the enemy.
---
ez clap
---
No just you. I like having the ability to kick people who TK or are afk or just for being toxic. 
---
we got the unicorn of all unicorns aka tachanka
---
604,800,000 milliseconds
---
Preach! Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. The priorities of the Dev team are WAY out of whack. 
---
Putting new paint on a car with broken wheels does not make it work...
---
The chanky headgear is flame too though 
---
yes, it was worth the downvote
---
Restart your game
---
I'm glad you leave. I don't like playing with toxic bitches.
---
What's the different between GMOD prop hunt and CoD prop hunt? I'm a CoD player so i didn't played GMOD prop hunt.
---
I was shooting drones and my teammate tked me for destroying the drones.
---
Sounds interesting 
---
So much better than my recruit cosplay
---
##OwO
---
At this point it's not difficult anymore, it's just retarded
---
I've got 2 accounts with my main having hundreds of pounds spent on it. I'm not buying a single magic pack from this event, they ain't getting more money off me while paid cosmetic DLC is their highest priority. They ignore the real issues, they haven't even acknowledged the perspective issue yet and when they finally do, probably after it costs some team in a PL match, we will have to wait for months before they have a solution. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôd prefer kills. Because all people do is run around for drones and completely ignore the obj 
---
Now try spawnpeak.
---
Calling /u/its_epi, /u/ubinoty for some answer on the most pressing issue this game has
---
You wot m8, butterfly charm is the best thing in the event. 
---
First game I played, instantly thought "ahhhh good old pyrovision".
---
Twitch drone? ACOG. Pest launcher? ACOG. Rook armor? ACOG
---
I don‚Äôt think claymores are, but landmines are. Idk though for sure
---
My question is if there would be more challenges, probably didn't make myself clear enough
---
Is it just me or do you think that montagne shield should  have been white and pink not black and pink, it would fit his outfit a lot better and we dont really have any ops with a white shield and I think it would be cool.
---
On the contrary, there are multiple defense ops that counter Monty. 
---
Echo and Ela both force his shield to collapse to he has to extended it again. 
---
Lesion, smoke, Kapkan and any trap ops punish him before the juicy Intel comes.
---
All roamers make us cry if they understand how to flank on a mediocre scale. I've been flanked many times and died to either the person in front of me or the flanker. 
---
Also explosives are more damaging than you think, trust me.
---
I've been countered by people who we counter.
---
Not disagreeing to the post but rather playing devil's advocate for a solid discussion, also not looking for arguments or support on either side.
---
Yes they built this whole event and added alpha packs for it but who's to say that it wasn't just made for the sake of having a fun event, and just including the limited alpha packs as all their events do? When Outbreak came out it was a fun experience as well but it had the same limited alpha packs. Yes Outbreak was more of an entire rebuild to how siege is normally played, making it unique as such, but the alpha packs didn't take away from the experience. Same for the Road to S.I. playlist that came out during invitationals that had alpha packs. The alpha packs were nice and all but the experience if playing the pro league playlist was awesome. When it comes now to Rainbow is Magic, it just seems that they wouldn't put this much effort into the whole thing if the core was alpha packs. It seems more like they wanted to just make a fun event and added packs so that it wasn't something that gave no tangible rewards, but rather those sweet sweet limited cosmetics all siege players want, allowing the ability to purchase them for when RNGesus doesn't bless you with your desired rolls. It's very possible that it was built to be experience first and money second.
---
Again, not disagreeing with OP, playing advocate for the purpose of 2 views on it for solid thoughts and discussions to form
---
I opened the free pack and got the monty shield...
---
Then I bought a normal case and got a Black Ice.
---
Starting off, this is a two week event. Secondly, the people who made his rent are not the people who work with other updates, features, and bugs. Ubisoft states they were adding multiple small teams to create these events. Third, this event is bring them revenue and bringing a lot of attention to siege. They‚Äôre getting a ton of publicity and I‚Äôd say this event was a massive success for them. I haven‚Äôt enjoyed Siege so much for a while and I love seeing the flexibility of the developers.
---
I played a game with out spawn peeks
---
Newcomer....
---
He is so handsome in this pic I'd be gay for him ngl
---
Modern Warfare flashbacks
---
It‚Äôs a bug where your character position isn‚Äôt replicated correctly in the killcam, that‚Äôs all. The new camera position allows players to be seen by enemies before they can see them when holding angles close to cover. It‚Äôs frustrating but your enemy is most definitely seeing you despite what you saw and what the killcam shows. 
---
True, I just never play him :// I‚Äôll probably use him in casual just to meme on people as a fuckin unicorn but that‚Äôs it
---
Am I the only person who feels that the bear is so shootable? I‚Äôve got banned twice cause I kept killing it.
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
Uuuhhhhh saaaaame? I honestly don't understand this sentence at all.
---
New comer doesn‚Äôt help a lot. It gives 3 maps and it‚Äôs all relatively new people. I‚Äôm suggesting a place for people to get a true ranked experience before going into ranked.
---
I would like to say the one that looks thru the door thru the hallway past cctv out the other door. Not 100%
---
i‚Äôve never seen anyone do what you‚Äôre describing in any siege event. 
---
This happens relatively often to me (PC). Once or twice a week. Discord is running in the background.
---
On the scoreboad, the game shows no mic icon for you or any of your teammates and pressing the push-to-talk button does not show your name on the side (indicating you're talking), nor does it show up for anyone else if/when they talk. It's like the voice option doesn't exist at all.
---
Wait what happens if i change the language for the announcer...
---
Oh, I doubt there will be more challenges for the event, unfortunately. The event only lasts a week and there is only one challenge available to get one free pack.
---
Just makes me so happy and fuzzy inside every time I see it .....  hehehehhehehehheheh üåàüåàüåàüåàüåà
---
Yes, quite
---
Did you custom make that vest? I‚Äôm trying to put a vigil one together and I can‚Äôt find one anywhere
---
I‚Äôm starting to question if I even play the game anymore
---
BMI score means jack shit (and it also conveniently reminds everyone of it) for people above certain height threshold - Kaid is 6'5", way above the said threshold. 
---
Also, you can visually see that he is fit and his posture is proud and intimidating. Gridlock simply emanates "farm girl" stereotype and it just looks goofy as hell.
---
I would DUMP money into cosmetics if I could pick and choose. I do NOT want to gamble for random cosmetics and I cant believe they still think it's a better system for the community.

aye who tf downvoted?

Just checked, it's a melee kill. ^^
---
O. I thought it actually did for a sec
---
*2 hours later* "i couldve bought some packs, but no, i decided to get a book
---
You really don't think they are looking into it? Sorry to burst your bubble, but cosmetic designers don't work on netcode and hitboxes. There's more than one person and one team working on the game. And the new April Fool's playlist has most likely not hindered them at all.

with a bmi of 25.6 which is overweight.

What about Monty's broken pro league uniform and IQ's cosmetics? Or the fact many people are still missing their year 2 Obsidian weapon skin since sometime in year 3?

You got shot in the face... Why is this ubisofts fault?

Even better if you ask me üòâ

False, kaid is actually even fatter at 216lbs (98kg) yet nobody says a word because he has a penis.
---
He is also FIFTY EIGHT YEARS OLD.
---
No I‚Äôm saying people shouldn‚Äôt be trying hard. I‚Äôm not talking about the people who are good and have good accuracy and can lean well etc. I‚Äôm talking about the people who have to meticulously drone throughout the game and other tryhard tactics to play. Idgaf if your aim is good. I‚Äôm saying the people who sweat in order to win a game where nobody is trying
---

Kaid is 6'5". BMI stop making much sense above around 6'1" threshold. Besides, you would have to be blind to consider Kaid actually overweight, dude. 
---
if they gave them all for free, no one would buy them
---
So explain Kaid?
---
58 years old, and 25.6 BMI at 216lbs (98kg) which would disqualify him from basic training in most armed forces.
---
... or you capability of understanding basic arguments is limited? 
---
Yeah winning is fun but there‚Äôs no need to be tryhard in it.
---
How is droning sweating? People don't wanna die dog
---
I miss the old Y1 wallpapers with real photos :/
---
The animated menu looks ugly on my toaster.. 
---
That‚Äôs kind of the point of flashbangs, hence the bang part of it
---
I mean you don't have to hate on what I have I just thought i could show what i have without being hated on
---
That has never happened before to me, and I dont think it should
---
I remember doing something like this but for an attacker‚Äôs birthday. I placed all my jammers in the cockpit. That was a good day. 
---
Ubisoft stated they are going to have one event per season from now on (four events per year). They aren‚Äôt hiring these people just for one job and even if they were this event has been such a success it would be more than worth it. Either way you are very incorrect.
---
i‚Äôll admit I was about to plug the dancing bear too my first time playing this but I just had to remember it was still a hostage 
---
He fails to meet the standard for BASIC TRAINING in nearly every armed forces group in the world.
---
I mean for fucks sake, the AIR FORCE wouldn't even accept him at that weight.
---
Why repost 
---
Just in time for the challenge that requires killing FORTY drones. 
---
Well if you just go in and shoot the guy you won‚Äôt. Hence try hard. Yknow, the people who have a guy droning while they follow it like a dog then prefire as soon as someone is spotted
---
*shudders*
---
Quality caption 
---
Then explain to me how nobody cries about it not being realistic that a guy who is too overweight for nearly every military in the world to be in the game receives no attention from the subreddit?
---
Oh yeah, because he is a dude.

Your argument is *something something* "uBi aDd dRoNe cHaLlEnGe tHeY nO fIx cOmMuNiTy." I'm not the stupid one here chief

I don't complain that people have 9 ping, i complain about the matchmaking that pairs me with 9 pingers like wtf, get more servers or better matchmaking. 
---
Pretty sure the deathcam thing is a bug, they look normal at all other times.
---
Aim head level other then that, nice clutch
---
I fell from plat 3 to gold 3 in just 24 hours because i get teams like this. Now i havent played ranked after my teammate planted the defuser when he was alone next to 3 enemies without telling anyone. Also my team always plays info ops without giving a single callout the entire game 
---
I‚Äôm fine with new content that‚Äôs not the issue. They‚Äôre prioritizing paid content over fixing core game mechanics: that‚Äôs my issue, you‚Äôre right they can‚Äôt wave a magic wand, but they sure aren‚Äôt making moves putting their resources in the most needed places. My rank matters because I‚Äôve been playing at a high level since the beta so I know the issues that are affecting the highest level of play inside and out and have put over a thousand hours into the game. If you play at a lower level it‚Äôs likely that you don‚Äôt have as in-depth a knowledge base to make judgements off of. Its not bragging, it‚Äôs establishing credibility, which you don‚Äôt seem to know the difference between, hence your triggered comment lol
---
1. If your whole team goes recruit you must pick recruit as well or you will die instantly by teammates.
---
2. DO NOT MARK ON VALKIRE CAMS!
---
3.  Dont castle off main doors.
---
4. Don‚Äôt Ying/flash  the room if your team is securing ( not contested (if contested still use caution)) the obj .
---
5. When you die become support , do not sit and watch the remaining play, hop on cams and give call outs , keep marking to a minimum so enemies do not look for cams to destroy them. (I try not to mark on any camera (maybe maestro) only time I will mark is when it‚Äôs like 5 seconds left and they are about to push)
---
Dude who cares. Droning has never been "tryhard." You being bad doesn't mean everyone else should stoop to your level of being bad
---
*gets 2 charms*
---
Is this a wired controller? It makes a lot more sense now why you don‚Äôt want to unplug it. This may not be the ideal suggestion, but if you‚Äôre down to spend some money pick up a wireless controller. You can still use it wired if you prefer but unplug from the controller end rather than the PC end.  See if the steam solution works (if that‚Äôs applicable), maybe it‚Äôll be a little easier. 
---
Cut off your pp after seeing bb
---
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks
---
I heard if you kill the hostage or something the announcer says "it was naptime for Mr bear" fucking lmao
---
What is wrong with you people? This is the gayest background screen and ops I've ever seen. WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH A TACTICAL SHOOTER? NOTHING. Ubisoft blatantly pushing agendas........... Making all of the operators like drag queens.... are you fucking kidding me? 
---
I fear him especially when i shoot him in the calf to stop the reinforcement, and then shortly thereafter eat his M870 pellets.
---
"why didnt you reinforce"
---
"Why didnt YOU reinforce"
---
"I was afk"
---
This was literally the first round
---
Big oof
---
And how much does a sense of humour weigh?
---
She also says something about a lot of stuffing coming out of Mr Bear LMAO
---
It's a russian recruit. 
---
I was all for doin the challenge till I saw that. Now it‚Äôs not even worth doin it. Maybe if the game mode was more fun an the packs had some cool stuff in it. 
---
Yeah that was me. We do this far too often
---
It may seem cheap to you to get run out on, but its pretty balanced as far as I can tell. You can hear whenever a defender breaks a barricade, and if it‚Äôs already broken then you can just bait the defender or just keep an eye on it. 
---
Run outs are fun as fuck and rewards good aim under pressure. I think it‚Äôs what gives the game character and I would wager that most of the people who complain about it are either casual players or salty silvers.
---
Oh he knows
---
I mean I finished the challenge in about an hour and a half, but I do agree it was tedious and could‚Äôve been better 
---
We will see, but it hasn‚Äôt been addressed by anyone on the team at all yet. That‚Äôs my issue. They say the want transparency for the dev process but they keep us in the dark. 
---
Are you for real? Did you read my comment?
---
**BMI SCORE IS NIGH MEANINGLESS FOR EITHER TOO TALL OR TOO SHORT INDIVIDUALS**

Repeat it with me. Write it down. Look at it....

Actually, forget it, you just wanna be outraged, because being outraged Social Justice Warrior brings a sense of unity to you guys. Yeah.
---
with that roamer, dont reinforce hatches ! Let somebody else do that. You got so much more utility than doc/rook ... let those guys reinforce hatches
---
Hmmm
---
I'm not sure if you're joking or actually retarded

You're legit fucked up in the head, dude.

Holy shit, that looks actually great. Then again you're lucky you actually look kinda like Doq.
---
Me Bear is a sociopath 
---
**ubi,i realy need my fuze in this game mode please!!!**
---
do u made this or you got it?
---
Attackers have utility specifically designed to counter any advantages the attackers have. That's the core premise of the game.
---
Fuck i messed it up sorry
---
Casual is sweatier than ranked up until like Gold II
---
Well most maps are fine. Plane is just a meme map.
---
I like plane just because I‚Äôm a spawn peeking bastard in casual.
---
I would suggest playing ranked. If you communicate with your team, it‚Äôs very easy to make friends and build up a squad to play with, which is by far the best and most fun way to play the game. 
---
His utility got buffed, and it‚Äôs pretty good now, but nowhere near how good Maverick‚Äôs is
---
Mozzie has sticky feet like a real mosquito, Gridlock has her own gravitational pull, and that bike cane from fuckin goofytown my dude 
---
Yes and bugs got fixed in this patch, but they keep glancing over the biggest bugs. Shields are currently fucked, sound is fucked, hit reg is bad as usual, the new camera perspective when leaning is fucked, yet they fix things like end of round display of gridlocks gadget....
---
is that how it works :o
---
Cuz i have the same birthday and height as jager :3
---
You gotta fire up a moba then. I can‚Äôt even count the number of times I‚Äôve unironically been told to kill myself playing league. And dota is about a trillion times worse

The stuffing would be a nightmare to clean up

and...

I really don't mean to be rude, but i think is bad, should have much more details other than the hair :s

---
That‚Äôs all you, not the fault of hostage
---
Well rainbow likes everything realistic so they wouldnt do that. Yet they can make the edger thinner for I have seen many kill cat the guy didnt see the enemy coming because of the red dot obstruction 
---
His smokes can't be jagered that's huge by itself.

My tablet is attached to the armor with magnets and had a working Dokk OS running on it!

What if I told you that its entirely personal preference and the 3 sights all have different advantages that offset and disadvantages?
---
ATTACKERS: Hibana, Glaz, Finka
---
DEFENDERS: Doc, Leion, Frost
---
1: You went for ad hominem with the "vritue signalling" comment to begin with, so don't start if you can't deal with it darling. 
---
2: Too many hard words for you to understand, so you shorten it down to "no u"? Cute. 
---
3: I'm giggling over here, I point out you being all upset over one (1) woman not being up to your aesthetically appealing to you in a game, and you manage to extrapolate that into Playboy bunny outfits for the whole female cast? Amazing. Glad we could have this enlightening exchange.
---
I had no idea you gatekeepers were so vivid in your morbid fantasies, but keep it in your pants buddy, this is a Christian subreddit.
---
So... It's ubisofts fault?
---
lmao
---
Can be a castle from For Honor
---
Ah, gotcha
---
I figured it would be to force players onto plane so they can get stats for a rework.
---
I literally haven‚Äôt played hostage since Black Ice when I bought the game, until this event lol. 
---
You can only get them for a limited time, but if get them, you have them forever.
---
Nah man you'd have done that to your teammate even if it wasn't hostage
---
No, I was making a joke
---
When my teammate downs me to steal my drone for the challenge 
---
Yea, I just thought of the magnification because it is like a scope so it didn‚Äôt seem to far fetched
---
Nah it‚Äôs all good
---
People play thunt but I get the reference
---
Not sure if new but pretty sure it‚Äôs ugly 
---
Man I had the sickest flick of my life the other day. One tapped the finka right in the dome with my R4C
---
Oh ok fair enough I got confused... I thought I meant 1.94 not -1.94
---
one of the worst thing in lol is that you have to build something for 10 minutes, than get destroyed by the opponent in one bad fight
---
I relate to this on a depressing level
---
Snap.
---
Everything is pretty much objective. No excuse allowed. Often I was matched with complete trashcans and well it's just part of the outplayed lol.
---
Got the squariness just right. 
---
Noman turning pages still haunts my mind
---
Who would use other sights then?
---
It's great! Keep it up
---
"Mr. Bear has decided to join the meanies" 
---
Dont think the BOSG's rendered yet!
---
nice
---
Casual is not really balanced tho :/
---
Don't reinforce next to someone unless they're in the middle
---
Still have to wait for the auto system to kick. Maybe the new tk system helps but I can guarantee someone will find a way to abuse it. And none of that helps with toxic players in general. 
---
So why should vote kick be removed from casual? 
---
That would be too much work for an april fools event
---
Sorry, SJWs can't troll. You're one of the best examples of it.

I think this word joke by OP (as in trap operator, instead of trap like in anime) can be seen both ways, but it is pretty clear what OP meant. Now as a openly trans person on anonymous social media I can get quite some stuff over me (luckily not on reddit so far), and I have been called 'trap' more than once. The fact that trans people are (incorrectly) called traps has nothing to do with the meaning OP had for the word. It still has a negative connotation for me personally though
---
Except the N has always been a racial slur. Trap is literally defined as crossdressers, not trans people. Yes, it is used as a slur, but the word itself is not meant to be a slur. If you're getting offended at the proper use if the word, when it isn't being applied as a slur, you're actively seeking attention, not defending people. 
---
Sincerely, a trans women. 
---
I appreciate the offer, but nah. I may get some more in the future (or that Pokemon board looks good) but the prices are cheap enough, so I don't mind paying full price.
---
Don‚Äôt play blitz, it just triggers the other team to play blitz. Then you get a cycle of cancer

i don't see how trap is offensive? isn't it just used here as a pun?

---
Original link please?
---
Or how bout just play the game
---
That attitude is the first reason you are that rank.
---
It's not your team, it's you. Learn that and start to move up.
---
The problem stems from the fact that if an operator disrupts someone‚Äôs play style they‚Äôll want them nerfed, and if they want to play them but it‚Äôs not quite with their play style they‚Äôll want them buffed. As someone who pretty much always roams on defense I‚Äôd love to see jackal burn in hell but I know he‚Äôs balanced at the end of the day and I‚Äôm not gonna complain.

Nah man, havent you seen the expensive alpha packs? It's made by EA
---
HaCkEr
---
This is really dumb. I play a lot of castle and if our team has a rook I have to be fast during setup in order to get everything done. If you go to the wall I usually reinforce I'm going next to you, for speed purposes.
---
Like you said if you have something specific you better speak up, or don't get annoyed when I reinforce that wall. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the attackers be the one trying to protect the hostage? I mean it is the defenders HOSTAGE
---
Let‚Äôs do the math on this...
---
Best case scenario you play 5 rounds, 3 of which you may get to defend. The other team gets a max of 10 drones per round
---
3*10=30

---
What DMR oneshot kills?
---
The only time an op needs a buff or nerf is if it‚Äôs objectively better or worse than the average.

Attackers : Recruit GSG 9, Recruit GIGN, Recruit SAS

Defenders : Recruit Spetsnaz, Recruit FBI Swat, Tachanka

High ping on either side increases peelers advantage. So when playing against a high ping or with a high ping the peeker will always have the advantage. Its hard to hold angles when there is a person with high ping (you or them) as the peeker will see you first. 
---
However having played on a high ping before overall it‚Äôs definitely a disadvantage, because your shots feel as if the don‚Äôt hit and you can be killed by people you haven‚Äôt seen yet.
---
Yes. He‚Äôa going to fuck spiders and you‚Äôre gonna watch. Remastered Asian Porn

what if they took away one shot headshots and acogs to assault rifles pistols (except for the .44 mag) and smgs. but dmrs were able to have acogs and 1 shot headshots. This would include kaids slug shotgun.

Well yeah but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was lucky
---
if you want, just try it has huge lag between game monitor
---

---
Well if it can't be sold then of course it's not valuable. Bad choice of words I guess.
---
I guess one of my problems with R6S is the existence of so much complexity.
---
I feel like complexity is being added for complexity's sake at this point, not for any particularly good gameplay reason.
---
How many times has a hijacked drone been shot since Burnt Horizon was released?
---
How many times has a Twitch drone shot a Mirror, then hijacked slightly too late, resulting in indiscriminate TKs?
---
It's one thing to add a new twist to an existing mechanic:
---
* adding thermal sights to a scope to see through smoke
---
* shooting devices with a drone
---
* viewing heartbeats through walls in addition to hearing footsteps
---
* explosive devices that knock people down instead of heavily damaging them
---
* making the defenders' phones vibrate
---
All of these are okay things to add, because they don't violate any established norms for the game's rules.
---
* smoke grenades exist, it only makes sense for thermal sights to be used to counter that
---
* we have guns, we have drones... combine the two, and you can remotely disable cameras and other gear
---
* footsteps are already audible through walls, why not pick up on other sounds?
---
* dial down the explosive force, and instead of instagibbing people, you throw them out the 2nd floor window
---
* defenders have to view the cameras somehow, the cameras have audio, and they probably aren't wired, so abuse that fact and any security vulnerabilities
---
Meanwhile, we have the UI nightmare that is Mozzie.
---
If a defender sees a drone, their first instinct is to shoot the hell out of it.
---
Suddenly, they have to start checking if it's been hijacked by Mozzie, or if it will be soon.
---
Also, they need to now ask "Hey Mozzie, did you just shoot Mira's aquarium with that Twitch drone?"
---
And all they have is a bunch of [Knight Rider lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxE2xWZNfOc) to tell the difference between enemy and allied drones.
---
It violates one of the core principles of this game:
---
1. Attackers have drones, and destroy mounted cameras.
---
2. Defenders have mounted cameras, and destroy drones.
---
Pity. Well, I got a cool looking skin at least.

No, Brick is the prettiest!

What exactly is the issue? Are you wanting them to be more powerful?

Hello NAB2002, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b8pt7s/my_game_keeps_crashing_unexpectedly_after_about/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Thank you, really, this is the one answer we never get when we point this out and I'm very thankful. Also, this sub usually has always the same answers that make my eyes hurt: objectification of the women in the game, repeated use of homophobia or transphobia, memes typically asociated with 4chan alt-right wingers...
---
But I think it's changing over time, and that's cool.
---
Those people aren't sweaties, they are called "cunts". If you kick people to win a game you aren't being sweaty you're being an asshole and have no skill in the game because clearly if you are already dead and kicking someone who is alive what does that say about your skill? Maybe if you were better you'd still be alive. I understand special cases occur but even at that those are far and few between. If you have the skill you can win in Siege. 
---
Exactly but they usually end up at the bottom of the leaderboard

I got montange's outfit completing the set since I got the helmet from the first one, didn't spend a penny

Lots of things. Mostly cards that you get from playing games that you have bought. Given I have had steam for 10+ years you accumulate a lot of junk. That can then be sold for fractions of a dollar each.

Nope cuz Ubi don‚Äôt care

Add user flair

happy cake day u/leftblnk
---
The perpetuation of the idea that trans women are men trying to "trap" other men into sleeping with them causes demonstrable harm. You're right, this meme isn't a huge deal by itself. What IS a big deal is the normalization of transphobia online, and it's something that needs to be discussed whenever it's relevant.
---
That would be epic.
---
Go to sub reddit settings and add user flair 
---
reason why i dont do that subreddit is because it doesn't allow images where the icons give alot more definition to the operator
---
I also removed the post in question. Once this came to my attention I decided that since the artwork wasn't mine to begin with I thought it wouldn't be fair to the original creator to have their work perceived that way.

Only spots the bomb for the team if the bomb has been seen post plant. Since no one looked at it, it didn‚Äôt get noticed. Personally I think the defuser sound (untouched) should be way more distinguishable like CSGO so you have a better understanding on where it is

But that ISN'T what trap means unless it is being misused. It was used properly in this case and people still found a way to be offended by it. There was absolutely no context here that trap was being used to refer to a trans person. OP probably didn't even know trap could be construed as a slur, since that isn't what the word is MEANT to be used for. 
---
Yeeeeees

BROTHER
---
Search around for the sub first next time? Plenty of people have posted and every post is titled as it being a new skin. Yes it's a new skin for this season, no you are not the first to post it.
---
Yeah and no one actually has fun in casual anymore everyone is really toxic.
---
Love it! Would love a mod that makes sims kill each other with guns 
---
Well dont play anymore. I havent played in 2 years but decided to redownload it. I take it in stride. I get kicked,TKed and berated all the time because I use a controller. Look it isnt my fault the PC I play on the most is in the living room and I am 12' from my TV. Well that and my wife and I get a kick out of the children and man children making fools of themselves when they get on the mic. You do you. Ever did lone wolf terrorist hunt? I do that often when I dont want to hear immature clowns take a game too seriously.
