Interesting. I haven't played in awhile but they used to hotfix glitches pretty much immediately. I find it hard to believe they've gotten that bad. I wouldn't be surprised if they removed D.va while fixing it but I'd need a source showing it took them a couple weeks.
---

---
League of legends also disabled stuff all the time when I played but it rarely lasted longer than a day.
---
---
---
Right! I main claymores a lot on attack and haven't been able to defend myself against run outs. Like sometimes I'll see them coming and other times, don't get so lucky.
---
Yeah, that would work, thanks for that addition.
---
And here I was thinking she’d find a gadget to shoot or something
---
The fact that I got runouts or spawn peaks in 9/10 of my last games shows that not only glitches are a problem of this game and now without claymores they don't even have to fear that they might die when doing it. And for that one last game I had no runouts, I then instead had idiot enemies that were writing stupid Nazi shit the entire time
---
They're not replying to you, they're replying to someone else within your comment thread
---
Cause fun = no no for Ubi.   weas the same shit when they had the "bug" that let you place a mira half on reinforced / soft walls.  was nice, was not game breaking, only had a few spots that it really was helpful in, but yaknow...fun detected.
---
Someone should take his own advice, huh?
---
I mean, you're right and you're wrong. It is Ubi's fault that these glitches are in the game, but glitches like this aren't exactly easy to fix. They come from a really convoluted exploitation of the game engine, and even figuring out how a glitch works code wise can take an extremely long time. Taking them out until they can be properly fixed, while really annoying, is the best way to handle the situation without it straight up ruining the game.
---
wow
---
My friend says if you continue to press forwards you will eventually break out but it might take awhile.
---
Zofia and Ela were released during the same time dude
---
IQ had a glitch where you could use the claymore to turn invisible.
---
Three minutes and all of your ammo
---
Or becomes a t hunt attacker with no team kill penalty.
---
The claymore one allowed the operator to turn invisible, which was done by forcing their model to stay in spawn. Only IQ could do it I think, but they just removed claymores altogether just to be safe
---
I guess so. People ban blitz quite a bit though
---
Test server boiiiiiii
---
Llooool put me in le screem shot wit el random thing on my name HaHaaaahahahahahahhaa lololololoooloo such epic much random
---
Does this work for console?
---
Better then a guy aimbotting after you crush his team the first round
---
I’ve been tkd in casual for not playing recruit.
---
Does anyone know why ping can't go lower than 9?
---
Whoever you want to play lol. You bought the game and the OP’s
---
People complain about them removing bugged stuff but people also complained that they left bugged stuff in so it's a lose lose for ubi

I think we should get all of the base operator elites first
---
Tell your friend to control his emotions
---
You recorded this so awfully i cant tell whats happening
---
Happened to me when I first started playing R6. There was a level 200+ Gold player on the enemy team completely destroying us going on a flawless win. Near the end when the rounds were tied I waited as Cav near one of the entrances and after I downed the player and realized it was that enemy, they left the game before I could interrogate them. It was a casual match lol
---
Yes doing a good job is hard work, and apparently Ubisoft does not like hard work.
---
Ubi plz gib back barricade
---
I miss it
---
I was ready to downvote if it was a skyrim meme
---
This is awesome!!
---
Did you not read it if they say where I’m at obviously I’m not pro league like you and I can’t kill 5 people with one mag
---
That’s literally 10 seconds of ping
---
You’re right how silly of me. Maybe I should have looked at the website or their Twitter and Instagram. I could just have browsed deep into a sub reddit filled with fan art, clips, complaints, glitches, tips, etc. Why didn’t I think of this before?
---
It’s not a stupid question it’s an honest and simple question. A question that could have just been simply answer by just saying “June 11th”. Which may or may not be the correct date because I haven’t seen an OFFICIAL announcement. Which they hardly ever do because anything could happen between now and June 11th
---
I am disgusted that I miss dropshots.
---
I know glitches aren't easy to fix. Believe me, however if it can be done on all the other competitive games it can be done on this one too. They aren't an indie company. [Do you even know how much Ubisoft makes?](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/comsite_common/en-US/images/06ddr%20final%20version_tcm99-330429_tcm99-196733-32.pdf) If they're selling yearly passes, skins, and loot boxes, they can fix glitches faster instead of removing key equipment from the game for a month.
---
I agree its the best way to handle it and I fully support the method they're using. The speed at which they're handling it is the issue I have.
---
Yep, according to some lore files Kestrel's alive and kicking as a "freelancer", Sam last met up with him in Chernobyl of all places.
---
More than usual? fuck O fuck
---
What do you mean
---
Don'ttttt even question it buddy, don't you dare.
---
What kind of calculator was this filmed on?
---
Ocean teeth. It is better for memes
---
use the search bar or google. it’s not hard to figure it out
---
I honestly don't like that they are changing the shields in my opinion they shouldn't add the one way mirrors and instead keep and the same and force people to use their ears.
---
Yes
---
Hahaha i like your username
---
It was on realistic
---
They’re both gone!
---
what do you mean by fair? i always liked nomad because of the originality of the airjab and that it can be pretty damn funny seeing people/being blown into a wall by it, do you mean fair as in a defenders get up time or the proximity at which it detonates??
---
It was ranked
---
Technically it is pretty fair
---
Wow, what a pro.
---
Look forward to seeing it, lol.
---
Eh I’ve seen some disabled for about a week. But I understand your point, the longevity is the issue.
---
Here, I made a video on it. It's easier to show than to explain each time. https://youtu.be/I4y5r8zYhzY
---
Muzzle Break on DMR's. Compensator for other guns. If there's no Compensator, use Flash Hider.
---
They temp banned them along with deployable shields because people were using glitches to cheat. (Clash could shoot through her shield, you could like "wear" a deployable shield, etc etc)
---
Since Ubi has been busy on working on the big patch for the new season, they implemented a hot patch temporarily banning those items and operator until they can address it in the next season patch.
---
yes Yes YESSSSSS
---
TIL arcade games and claw machines are gambling. The problem is that while lootboxes can be construed as "gambling", legally in 99% of the world, and the first definition you get when you google "gambling" is to play games of chance for money.
---
And sure I understand your logic, after all the differences are quite minor. But real monetary value as a reward for games of chance makes a huge difference in the mental perception of gambling. Its why casinos are full of sad old fuckers who spend all day on the slot machines, but you'd be hard pressed to find someone who spends all day at an arcade because they're trying to win a stuffed animal. Its also why you'd be equally hard pressed to find a group/service for carnival game addiction.

You can

No

This is against the rules

Ubisoft disagrees.  https://store.ubi.com/us/six-collection-chibis/?lang=en_US. Those five are season 2, there is no season 3 yet.

Looks like she is borrowing one of castles helmets
---
Really
---
EXACTLY, i always run a claymore when i get the chance, but now it just feels impossible to focus on an angle knowing at any minute someone is gonna hop out :/
---
Thanks! Can you use both turrets or does it delete the other one?
---
That dude is so lame. Hacking in general is garbage but hacking IN CASUAL?!? That’s just admitting you have a mental disability.

This is so cringy

Doesn't seem like there was really a reason. They just did it to do it I guess :/
---
Yeah, no clue why, but they got yanked by ubi
---
You learn something new everyday
---
Why did I laugh at that...
---
Placing the second one deletes the forst. But cancelling the placement of the second relocates the forst, leaves the faceplate floating behind in its original position, and still leaves the spare in your inventory.  If you do it on a hatch then bust the hatch, the turret will remain floating. 
---
Basically you cant use any of them until you fully place the second one, and then you'll only have one placed, thereby ending the glitch.
---
So why the claymore?
---
In Ubisofts defense, it's probably a problem that's deeply rooted into the game mechanics. Notice how all the 3 glitches are caused by pressing multiple keys at the same time? I would assume that they have already made a fix for all 3 glitches, but are still testing for unintentional side effects.
---
hold on, i haven’t played siege in a while. what happened to these?
---
What wasnt supposed to hapoen, a caviera anchoring?
---
I bought the advanced edition for PS4 after having owned the normal game and it works. It's just a code that gives you the packs and some R6 credits etc
---
Will definitely test some stuff out with this, thanks!

i was thinking of this

Be better if he had the recruits drone.

Merging branches is completely standard software development practice, and 'regression' is a completely standard software development side effect of adding new features or trying to fix other bugs.

What if I told you that there Gold and + but they play like copper players XD XD
---
No I’m not new. When you don’t join a recruit rush, you die. It s the law. Also you literally told somebody to uninstall the game. That’s next level toxic

PC toxicity is just as bad.

They are still running test releases on the tts and the tts is supposed to run for 3 weeks this year.

Where did you see a post on the discord that said its being released tomorrow?

I'd give it a try for sure

I think that might be kanal

Its kanals I think

 I bet you aced every round after too

Danke mein sohn

Like I said dumbass the guy was talking shit before then tks me and my friend for not playing recruit cause we don’t have too fuck off dude, the r6 community doesn’t tking and I had every right to tell that guy to uninstall so
---
every op has ears. that's your nomad counter. 
---
i do agree that there needs to be a hard counter who's not affected. maybe make it so that 3 speeds get up quicker than others? idk. there's lots of changes ubi could make. right now, though, ears are your counter.
---
Man I would love a TDM mode
---
As KG would say you are a shitter
---
U still have a Wii?

they've been in and out. not sure about right now, tho.

No, but we won
---
I will pick your comment to thank, because there is 6 of them after just one minute of posting.
---
Thank you
---
I wouldn't have an issue with this if it wasn't the same 'regression' resurfacing, like are they continually merging their current version of game with the release version from years ago? 
---
Sorry if I sound ignorant, I'm just frustrated.
---
This was made over a year ago when he was at his apex.
---
So what you are suggesting is an operator that can make blitz and monty operators with nothing but a pistol with no access to their special gadgets in a game centered around the fact that characters have special gadgets.
---
This is from the benchmark. I never noticed that he had the wrong weapon
---
I was a lil bit
---
Dude I literally won first round I played as him by using the ultrasonic and having the people run away and then I shotgun them. I got 3 kills on the 3 person team lmao.
---
It’s yacht who cares
---
Being able to see through smoke is a very strong ability. If Warden had an Acog, he would be too OP and attackers will never be able to smoke and plant.
---
This is the same reason why Ying has a very strong gadget but mediocre weapon.
---
Ubisoft is trying to steer away from making operators that people just use as an Acog warrior or a speedy boi roamer.
---
It can I've had 6 ping in a game
---

What eq settings do you use?

100% must have

Omg I didn’t expect you to actually do it wtf

He did WTF?!

When you're playing Echo you need to have good shooters on your team. I can't count how many time I told the location of a guy and pinged him just to get my teammates rushed him and potato. Your job with Echo is to give intel and stop people from planting the defuser.

Most runouts are tossic
---
NA-East Xbox. Yeah man Xbox is just filled with toxic people in my region I guess. I’d say 3-5 matches I play something happens like this
---
It's very, very different from DPS.
---
I'll given you the example of the AUG itself. It has a lower TTK on 1 and 2 armours than the 552 even though the 552 has 552 DPS and Aug has 504 or so. Nomad's AK has 477 and Cap's has 520 but their ttk is the same at 185. 416 is 162 TTK and zofia's m762 is 164,  but the latter's DPS is 18 more than the former's, showing yet another reverse trend.
---
Dps depends on damage and rpm, but ttk depends on rpm and damage threshold. "Time to down/kill" is the time to neutralise a target in an engagement, and as long as you cross the damage threshold for x number of shots to equal 100 damage, it's sorted. So if you can late 100 shots worth of damage faster than the defender can, then you have nothing to worry about. Which is why any 3 shot gun on attack with less than 740 RPM (Jäger's) can be considered sub-par: because in a head on body shot contest, Jäger will ALWAYS win.
---
Which is why the aug will never  get any damage buffs. Give ur 43 and there's legitimately no reason to take the 552. The Aug will ALWAYS negate enemies quicker than the 552 in that case.
---
Move on my dude. I got vote kicked for killing an entire team on defense with Kapkan once. Managed to set the traps just right, the opposing team strolled in and tripped on all my mines. Picked them off one by one and even got a c4 kill.
---
Why is it only Ash mains that do the little twirl while reloading? I’ve never understood.
---
Doesn't his team have to play in CL first before they can be in PL? Or is UBI giving his team special treatment so he doesn't beat up on the existing CL teams too hard.   
---
I'm genuinely confused.

Yea I don't even wait for these menus anymore, I just click through or find next match. I only ever see them playing with friends.
---
Holy ****. Would have loved to see that haha. Yeah I know just needed to rant a little. It’s just crazy to me in order to enjoy the game you gotta play ranked but my boys weren’t on so figured I get some casual practice
---
"Imma assume you tried to kick me so I and my friends tk you guys because you guys are toxic".
---
The logic
---
I’ve seen people suggest just making it so you have to wait a certain amount of time after you hit escape to click the exit game button
---
Yeah it’s a shame.
---
&gt;First of all, I never said skins did. I just think it looks better. Her default is basically the same. Ubi says they do what they want from the WD.
---
No, that's only a fraction of what they use. They even said that wl/Pr data are just what they can share to the community, and that they have multiple test sessions and boot camps where they test nerfs.
---
&gt; And if they really listened to people Kaid would still have barded wire and no impacts, Frost wouldn't be getting a nerf and they would just Nerf Twitch's damage instead of recoil. Not even mentioning how they're buffing Pulse and nerfing IQ
---
Kaid with c4 is a buff. It is the most useful utility on attack, and giving it to a dude with 2 ACOGs is a HUGE buff. Completely and utterly unnecessary. Using claws on wire was always a waste anyway. Frost buff is unnecessary, yes, but the twitch buff as they said is a multi step nerf. They'll eventually take away more damage.
---
Yep. That’s console. Pc is pretty bad but not nearly as bad in my personal experience. Used to play on PS4 and whenever I played with my friend that was newer (probably about bronze or silver matchmaking) it was just a tk fest every other game. I’m trying to get him to try it on pc but it ruined the game for him.
---
Hahahahaha exactly man!
---
🤡
---
I feel him. I played for 2 straight years and got so sick of it I stopped for a long time. Just got back into it about a month ago and I’m now having PTSD haha

Thanks

Why woild it be useless?
---
I’ve noticed this before. The secondary literally says “SMG” why won’t it count??
---
Lol it's excelerate and they aren't excelerate anymore. They're orgless now or go by pojo's dojo.
---
Na, I play Xbox on US WEST and this rarely happens. I’m level 163 btw. Honestly you could shoot someone and they would just kinda look at you like wtf, but then walk away like nothing ever happened

yeah ok

_ON HOSTAGE_
---
The real rook armour.
---
I agree. Though, I feel like rushing it out would only solicit more bugs and I think nobody wants that.   
---
  And I agree with your other statements as well. It's a breathe of fresh air not having to go against a clash, but I feel like when this next big patch rolls around, everything will be better on all sides.
---
*in extra hell* huh dont see you here. Kid: obviously! I use red dot on g36c. *goes to extra-extra hell* huh still dont see ya kid: I also use jäger *goes to extra extra extra hell.
---
Where do you think Rook got the idea for his armor?
---
That’s all the sweat from the tryhards abusing it
---
Never even mentioned twitch you bellend 🤣 unlike most people i dont have time to stream so get fucked :)

I am the rare breed option 1 that's too busy running around reinforcing hatches off site because the Jäger and vigil on my team decided to ditch site and go spawnpeeking.

You can buy compromised accounts for dirt cheap and also paying has never stopped people from smurfing. Look at CSGO before it became f2p
---
GOOGLE. IT?????????????????????????????????????????????
---
probably month
---
Dunno why china is wroth mentioning, they have servers on every subcontinent.
---
if someone leaves and doesn’t rejoin before the end of the match, the team that had the lost member (only if someone on the other team doesn’t leave making it a 4v4) the game doesn’t count for anyone
---
&gt;That’s all the sweat from the tryhards abusing it
---
?????
---
HOW DO YOU ABUSE A CLAYMORE????????????????????????????
---
it's fucking glue
---
I can feel myself doing exactly this already.

Idk what y’all talking about, but when I integrate, they leave and it lets me finish it, I just don’t get the kill

Haven't played since the update, what is reverse tk?

Not really, no. I just bring nomad and Gridlock.

I'm not trying to say that they should rush a fix for such a major problem, and I agree I would much rather it take a longer time and it be a solid fix than a quick but bad fix, but for me I feel it's been too long of a time for such a fix to be made.
---
It's not like they're busy trying to refine the new operators, I can't imagine it's that hard to copy and paste Vigil as an attacker and Glaz as a defender.
---
I think smurfs are worse. Smurfs ( by definition ) are people who purposely prey upon lower levels by deceiving the rank system.   
---
When it's in the case of diamonds and such, it's more or less just bad match-making.
---
Jackal's PDW9 is your best friend in this situation.
---
have you tried clicking on the mic next to their names???
---
No I didn’t, he was talking shit before hand and kept messing with my friends then he tks us for not going recruit so, no I wasn’t ty
---
google it?
---
I could see lots of server issues with that, as if there aren't enough desync issues. Having cav get her interrogation just by a disconnect is better.
---
Wow
---
If you TK someone it activates reverse friendly fire. The next time you shoot at a teammate the damage is reflected on you.
---
I dunno how deep the glitch code is or how complicated to fix it is, so I'll relief pressure from Ubi.
---
And blaming a company because they didn't found a glitch that thousands of people spend at least a couple dozen hours trying to glitch to be found... Yeah, I don't blame them for not wasting their time testing stupid/unlikely stuff
---
Wat
---
I only got the game six years ago, who’s the op on the left?
---
What if you have a bug and need to restart your computer?
---
And how would they know its intentional, if they just press alt+f4?
---
you can mute their voice or text individually, or you can just lower your overall sound in the settings
---
Remember operation nerf bastion
---
I would love to see a new gamemode for this purpose only. A gamemode where there is no friendly fire. It can be registered but no damage is done.
---
Not even close to an Ash main, but it’s really satisfying to do that twirl. I do it while droning as well
---
Show with acog next time lol
---
Because IQ was the only reliable way to do it, but others could with claymores too, for those it worked randomly. They had to remove the claymores for everyone.
---
Also, something about IQ being in the game core operators and not possible to remove without breaking the code. Not quite sure about that last part.
---
There is a leak somewhere that says this : defenders now have a reason to reinforce the hatches
---
Lmao I imagined a Cav getting a flank off and downing 2-3 enemies then just immediately alt-f4ing
---
I'm gonna farm for 3 months, no reason why.
---
No reason.
---
I wish MacieJay &amp; BikiniBodhi join too.
---
also he is easy to counter using kapkan

If you have such a problem with claymores why don't you just git gud?

Pretty sure they're playing in a different year with that ping.

---
I'm sure aimers don't like Blitz because they can't get easy headshots.
---
Also, yeah, Blitz is going to be somewhat good in CQC and in 1v1 situations he's tough to deal with, but Blitz is nowhere near amazing.
---
Oh no, looks like I’m going to the depths of hell. I have G36C black ice and Ash is my comfort pick.
---
Thermite.
---
Killed by his own sword.
---
That was the very first thing I thought when I saw warden for the first time
---
He's "designed" to win a 1v1. That's the fundamental of any shield. And they lose 1vXs.
---
I'm dying of shame but at least i beat two shield recruits in pistol battle : D
---
[Recuit is judging you.]
---
He should just carry the lmg in his hands and just be 1/2 speed when using it
---
Give me my acog back, and then I'll consider you a "real" god, you silly tincan false God!
---
:D
---
Possible.

Tachanka

Other than the great job renaining calm and letting them rush to their death, that last one tab was beautiful. Great job recruit

---
Many pros also talk high trash about runouts. It's such a common complaint among even the most common of players. 
---
   Yet, I have no problem with them. As long as it isn't hugely unfair. 
---
Essentially removing claymores just buffed runouts and hard-flanks when it wasn't needed whatsoever. 
---
Claymores were in such a broken state, I'll give you that, but at one point they were an exceptionally fair tool to utilize. It made defenders think twice about running out and flanking, while attackers STILL had to hold lanes and such. It was just a much more even ground thing. Like, there isn't a lot of negatives to run-outs other than being outplayed.
---
Please stop. I'm having nightmares thanks to that kaid.
---
damnn fr
---
Tachanka could use a buff anyway . an ALDA for him might be enough
---
Wow. Honestly blown away with how well you represent Jäger. Absolutely incredible cosplay, [u/killimaze](https://www.reddit.com/user/killimaze/)! Now to just talk the dev team into giving Jäger a helmet that has "ADS Deployed" going across it...
---
Inbred Kaid
---
NICE
---
Please tell me what pro is against run outs? They are a needed part of the game for defenders on most maps, including PL maps.
---
It's something that's been in the game since day one. But that's only if it loads with players missing. People leaving in the first second of a match is different. 
---
What's happens is that the MMR difference is so huge that the losing party loses barely anything, winning party barely gains anything ( it's just part of how the ranked system works). 
---
Say everybody is a gold 4 with 2500 MMR. If it's a 2V5 that means it's 5000 MMR vs 12500 MMR. 
---
I've encountered many different occurrences of this. Once early on in the game's life the entire enemy team left while we loaded in, before finishing loading a new team had joined (shouldn't happen in ranked). This meant tho that the MMR of the older players and the MMR were both counted and we gained about 200-300 MMR each on my team.  
---
Allowing leavers to reduce the MMR penalty for the rest of the team would lead to so much abuse.
---
Shit post.
---
Thanks for a good example.  I'm getting tired of people saying its unfair but while in gameplay and people start getting killed how many times are people in those 1v5 and etc in game. Also how many times at end of game does it show zero or 1 kill for multiplayer on teams . 
---
The top fragger was in a 1v5 1v3 etc game the whole time because bots back seat games to much. 
---
Yet people are complaining about
---
I like the 552 and the lmg with acog on both
---
Dropshotting was removed like a year ago, why would they use a breach around that time? Like they've got at least 10 major public builds of the game just after that.
---
Are you 9 years old by any chance

---
#GRODON RAMSEY?
---
aside from the christmas pack where we got an operator i’m still yet to get a legendary
---
I like it
---
I want but I know specialists can be chosen only from one player per match
---
I’m not sure what all the ash hate is all about, after they removed her R4 acog she has been a breeze to deal with. It’s the damn frost mains that keep grinding my gears
---
iirc the sound is still there if anybody pass through if its destroyed but no slow anymore
---
Other than that and Chimera skin for Ash, this was my first legendary
---
I think if he has a good dmg on the lmg he shouldn’t need a shield so it’s balanced
---
time to uninstall the game after that and never talk about it again :(
---
Even without explosives, having 3 attackers with LMGs spraying into the possible directions defenders can come from with complete disregard for their teammates will greatly hinder the defending team's ability to hold the site.  And then you'll still have to solve the friendly fire challenge for those explosives/area of effect abilities since a teammate could lay a nitro cell at your feet or cook a grenade at you or shoot you with an asphyxiating bolt.  Thus, Ubisoft still needs to solve the problem articulated by the OP but the nature of the entire game has completely changed for the worse.
---
Or like buff tachanka to make his turret bullets go through shields, or even make it so it makes him drop it for a few seconds
---
Everyone upvote this so that Ubi would see it

I don't know how 2 months isn't long to you

How tho

Also Echo and Hibana
---
Why not give him a .50 cal M2 with reduced fire rate. This .50 cal should be able to penetrate shields, atleast partially.

Absolutely LOVE PD2. Some great map designs that could suit R6

A good team with Monty can just dominate the defending team. We've seen plenty examples of that during pro league. Even Twitch Rivals for Siege shows how strong Monty strats can be.

Its 11.06.2019 i think

Why would you post this crap again...
---

---
i just dont like the outfit or mvp animation
---
Thermite is always appreciated 
---
IQ or thatcher can be useful to
---
For defence are intel-ops always useful like valkyrie, echo, maestro...
---
Just play who you like to play and it is ok
---
Make tachanka a 3 speed and only give him a knife with the 3 armor
---
Bandit is the worse
---
Still doesn't address his problem
---
He is going to *a* extra hell for that.
---
Ela  bitch thicker than a tub of molasses
---
bandit and ash
---
So it was the last match (4:2) it was just about to get started and I lagged but when I looked at my ping it was normal (15) 
---
Then out of nowhere everyone is walkin in place, I told myself ok maybe I lagged but nothing serious this shit doesnt happen to me. So I wanna leave, it wont let me... k task manager I shut it down and didnt make it in time to rejoin (we won btw was playing with friends) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When I think back tho, on the 3rd match 2 people left from the enemy team I told myself yeah they ragequitted but then again it was 2:1 for them why would they.
---
So in conclusion Ubiservers are shit and rather then releasing new operators and remaking cafe (I was hyped up for this shit too) They could fix shit like this
---
Kills cams are poor representation of kills

What do you use downvotes for?

Totally agree

yeah, lot of detail and creativity in sledge’s. the skin and animation are really cool as well. ash’s is just lazy
---
&gt; Have to start somewhere.

R6 Patriots was deemed “too controversial” or something like that and it was scrapped. Instead we got Siege.

How about making him an alternative for Maestro ? like a small mounted turret that does what ? 1 damage per 0.5 sec ?

I personally like alibi very much, if you play her ability right she can be very powerful.

You could be right but (to me at least) it makes sense that its remove paint because the explosives they use in most US claymores (the most common type) is solid, so no oozing, and yes a yellow casing around it plus the white marks are just scratches were as the yellow looks like it was removed when installing the laser

Go lesion and blow open the main wall, Everyone can go reinforce Dragon and you don't really need the rest unless you wanna get OBJ walls facing terrace. Throw a gu or two outside OBJ balcony and just prefire when it goes off, Castle can help with the windows but not necessary, and have a guy watchin terrace/drum
---
Definitely hibana and echo then, more support hardbreach and the camp master himself
---
seems like it would cause a lot of conflict and possibly become the most picked operator in he game, I'd suggest making some disadvantages such as it only lasts a few seconds

You should also check to see that lean/crotch spam is more effective on the TTS than live builds. You can get lower when crotch spamming than on the current live build. The wiggle effect seems to be slower to take a effect if that makes sense. 
---
Need to just have it be changing a stance to down pushes you out of ADS and when leaning you always have to return to the center position before being able to lean the other way. This will remove quick leaning for intel gathering but it will make lean spamming much slower and much less useful. These would need to be tested changes obviously and would need tweaks.
---
I like alibi but 25 k is steep for a way off meta op
---
Good news! With Nokk and Warden you can! /s
---
They announced a while back that having to go back to add all the old skins to all the new weapons every season was too difficult/time consuming, so they changed it to be only for all guns up to whatever season the skin was released.
---
but once they have the window opened it’s easily countered and doesn’t work as well. i’ve tried it before but it doesn’t really work in seas cuz everybody is sweating their balls off.

You should read posts before agressively ranting. I said that they should increase the timeout timer. Currently, if your internet drops for a second, you'll be booted. They should increase it to say about 30 seconds. During this 30 seconds you will be frozen in place in game, so opponents can kill you. Other games like CSGO clearly have a timeout counter for 27 seconds.
---
Rebind your keys immediately. The defaults are atrocious. Play T-Hunt until you’ve binded your stuff to be where you feel comfortable. It takes a minute but once you get there it feels smooth and silky as all things should. And not to mention set mouse sensitivity to where you need it. Mine is at 30 vertical 30 horizontal at 1000 DPI. With most things it just takes practice. I have crouch, prone, knife, and gadgets all set to buttons on my mouse. Good luck figuring everything out, hope I helped!

I mean I’m in class rn but I’m diamond and I think it’s just cause of people being busy rn ranked shouldn’t be down its probably just gonna take a little while go join a group post and you’ll find one when you have a squad.
---
Aah was hoping that there was permanent fix for this but thanks!
---
Dope edit, but do you use adderall  lol
---
When 2 of your teammates leave the first round, it's meaningless to play the rest of the game. Most games don't even track stats from games that have early leavers. But in Siege i have to play 3 more rounds in a huge handicap because there is no such system.
---
thanks!
---
He got downed for this x')
---
its on the screen, my man.
---
If it's the one i'm thinking of then it's probably Tame Impala - elephant
---
Why was it even quarantined
---
I think he means the game should be cancelled if someone leaves before the first round starts(before the attack phase).
---
This... Does put a smile on my face
---
Niggas
---
I definitely had a fun time! This project actually only took a couple of hours. We also worked on another drone that looks very similar to a twitch drone haha
---
Thats stupid
---
Oof
---
I hope you wouldn't mind some feedback for improvement?
---
Use a super high POV lens so you have a wider field of view . For instance extracting the camera module with lens from "insta 360 one" would serve as a nice upgrade , 
---
Use a bigger housing and and instead add wheels on the inside for the whole device to move inside the housing so you can move the camera inside the housing . Look up examples of BB8 driod internal designs , here's an example https://youtu.be/5FHtcR78GA0 . You just need to fix the outer shell so it doesnt move and make a physical limiter on the inside so the camera setup doesnt do a whole 360
---
Yep. Welcome to 2019
---
Lol I got the black ice for the mp7 before I even knew what black ice was
---
yeah , lion was released with dokkaebi and Vigil /s
---
Bottom of *blue* stairs
---
Yeah but how tf do you have over 74,000 renown
---
but nice 😂
---
It's more that they only want X many before its just too many to learn and deal with as a player.
---
And if you're referring to the data limits they mentioned, that's more to do with the amount of content loaded at any 1 time, not on the disk in general.
---
Check their Twitter
---
Thanks!
---
I’m not sure if it’s the worst but the 417 is pretty bad
---
Lmao almost an entire mag
---
Did they ever fix the recoil on console? Two quick shots had you pointing straight up last time I used Kaid.
---
Is that confirmed true? Just want to make sure if for some reason the year pass specifically does not apply to the discount.
---
ya i know it also look bad too I've been getting it for
---
Looks sickkkk man
---
Delete screw shake when it is from a friendly fuck fuze &gt;:(
---
Exactly. It's still just as good, and the G36C isn't the best but it's also not the worst gun to choose if you want an acog on ash
---
I almost always regret using the MPX. What is it, like 6 hits to kill at medium range?
---
what a name, just siege .
---
The whole team was like that lol
---
Depends. Imo, they all kinda ugly.
---
You're got-damned right!
---
I can recommend the Arctis 7 from Steelseries. They're about 150 on amazon and they're great for positional sound. I play a lot of siege and CS:GO. Good mic as well.
---
Sick Cutout.
---
Any idea how cheap the game gonna get ? My steam acc got hacked and I lost my progress of 2 years. Need to buy it again
---
I feel like Thermite's gun has pretty good Recoil
---
BattleEye now hardly cares? mothafaku.
---
L85 for sledge and thatcher has like no recoil
---
With the amount of people that will teamkill just to make sure they get the drones Instead of you, or they just hog all the drones for themselves, I would say that time is quite accurate
---
If rainbow didnt allow people who have bad internet they would lose half there players.
---
Done this before... My teammates were too busy arguing with each other about who was a bitch and how they were going to beat each other's asses in real life. There was one enemy left, I was in the bomb room and the only teammate left (one of 2 who was talking shit) just kept running in circles. I grew tired, TK'ed them and planted. Won the round because the enemy apparently went AFK after a minute of playing the round. Had I not done that, we would have lost. When I TK'ed the guy he didn't even say anything about it.
---
I got TK'ed the next round from the guy I killed, but I really didn't care, I was leaving anyway. Tired of hearing a bunch of grown ass men fight like a bunch of children over a fucking game when it has nothing to do with the game. 
---
I imagine situations like this is a big reason why they don't take friendly fire out of the game.

We need it back ;-;
---
Frost’s SMG has very minimal recoil. Probably one of the most controllable weapons in the game.
---
Yes.
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
.. why are there plastic bags with water
---
Smoke smg has no recoil what so ever :)
---
What irl be like
---
I think we don’t need any more shields currently
---
I never understood why people hold opinions like this in the first place about Ubisoft in relation to Siege; and further I don't understand why people make posts like this to bemoan the situation.
---
Ubisoft built the game in the first place.  Yes it's flawed, but it's compelling enough to still be going strong well into its fourth year, which is a feat very few games can match.  The idea that Ubisoft is "barely good enough" to fix the problems despite them having built the game in the first place makes no sense to me.  I would also challenge anyone to name another developer who has spent as much time and resources as Ubisoft has to fix a raging dumpster fire of a game to the point where it is one of the most popular games on the market (and for the record they've recovered three distinct titles from shambles in the past 4 years).  Yes, they shot themselves in the foot to get to that point in the first place, but even with all the problems today the game is in an infinitely better state than it was during all of year 1.  Most developers would've taken their profits and run for a new game to turn a fast buck.

Hard to say. M1014 is quite shit with excessive recoil, The MPX is a lesser damage MP5 with better recoil, the M12 and UMP are weak and frosts C1 is kinda lame, with no ACOG or Holo.
---

---
Oof you must que with some toxic people my friend, nothing like that’s ever happened to me before
---
I suppose that’s fair but most people would pick his rifle anyway so I don’t think it’d change up the meta *too* much lol
---
Wow really useful, thx
---
How? I'm interested in this
---
Worth a try
---
Primary: M12 for guns, M1014 for shotguns
---
Secondary: GROM Pistol (lowest damage but its got a red dot ig)
---
Is nobody going to mention Sledge made a runable hole with my swing?
---
&gt; So a person with a busy lifestyle cant enjoy a game?
---
No, not a multiplayer game. There isn't much more to it.
---
Why should you be entitled to teammates who are putting more effort into their chances of victory than you? You're a selfish liability.
---
&gt; so the question, when trying to punish those specific people, is how do you seperate them?
---
Again: it doesn't matter. Your teammates aren't going to have a less worse chance of losing if you leave for a good reason.
---
Now do a line to celebrate
---
Yeah well I tried editing it to make it better rather than just putting a fuze head at the top
---

---
I think my fellow OGs would say this isn't a great idea, Thermite is fine where he is and we just had Clash introduced last year, nobody wants another shield in the game.

Playing on pc hah.

of?

All I could think about was why u got the TK

Brazilian babe gets ***HAMMERED*** from behind
---
Did you fail to see the guy (ela I think) run up main stairs and into the bedroom?
---
Hehe
---
Never said he wasn’t fine, just thought it would’ve suited his role. Also not everyone would pick his shield (similar to Fuze) so it’s not like it’d be seen too often.  
---
It’s not like you can’t get a full team of shields anyway.
---
You cant take a headshot no matter what
---
Gigabyte conveniently doesn't cover motherboards under their warranty despite the laptop being 2500 bucks. So I took the parts I could reuse out of it and built a desktop. Haven't had any heat issues since. BTW if you ever wanted to use laptop ram in a desktop there are adapters out there. Mine work fine.
---
The problem is that even within the first round players will often feel they are overmatched in a ranked game and choose to leave.  While harsher punishments might help curb some of that, it's impossible to expect any amount of realistic punishment will prevent players from leaving games.  Thus, I'm sure many teams would work out a rotation (or have a player on an alternate account) leave if the first round is a struggle for them to minimize/remove the MMR loss.  Then whatever time the other team spends in that game would be wasted.
---
I definitely agree that if players leave before the action phase of the first round the match being cancelled is probably a prudent course of action; I just worry that too far into the round 1 action phase starts getting into territory where more people would abuse the mechanic as opposed to it providing respite for the teams who have a random player drop on them.
---
So you are telling me i could pour distilled water all over my pc and run it when its still wet?
---
Depends. How many ops are you missing and who do you want?
---
Damn, Wish that was one of my classes

Which operator is that ?
---
you are the toxic one here i think. He just wanted to do a joke but you tk'ed him, thats worse than a inappropriate joke.
---
Cool ideas but the operation colors can use a change since there is many red operators
---
417 isnt even close to being the worst gun.
---
Great ROF and recoil and 3-shots at most ranges. It's only downside is mag size, which you can kill 2-3 people easy per clip anyway.
---
*Vote to kick initiated*
---
I watched an ash the other day rush in obj and kill me with 10 bullets per second using the 5.7 USG
---
I was mentioning acog because its amazing to me that an LMG has acog but all of them do anyways
---
Happy cake day my lord
---
huh, I never knew Thatcher was Indian.
---
Probably the MPX and the AUG A3 (Kaids aug). The mpx does too little of damage and the Aug's ROF makes me feel like an elderly man
---
If you don't believe me then that's not my problem, I'm just telling you fron personal experience that it does happen. I'm sure you can google it. And they would have to provide proof to EVERY effected player in the game, I don't think you realize how unrealistic that is. How many Terabytes of data that would be, and not to mention they wouldn't have proof from your game exactly, they void the players matches at the time that they get caught and banned. They would have to comb through every match and record it for a minimum 10 players per game, and the cheater could've played hundreds of games before getting caught.
---
Why
---
Thank you my son
---
I enjoy the shit out if your comics but this one really had me laughing lol, keep it up my dude.
---
417 is not a bad gun, it actually has the best stats of all the dmrs (minus the SR, things a monster) but the 10 rounds is what kills it... Plus your negating yourself the OP fucking famas or the fantastic V308
---
I shot Blitz in the head through his shield twice in the same match yesterday. I actually felt really bad. I probably would have said sorry if it wasn't Blitz
---
This is dope
---
PANCAKESANDFRIS but I cant play right now cuz I gotta eat but I'll get on when im done
---
Perfect backstory for the next Halloween event lmao
---
It took me waaay to long to get it.
---
Whats the problem here?
---
Please. Fuck that map
---
I have the DAC that you can buy for it and mix with that. I've played guitar my whole life so I use a custom setting based on what's left of my hearing
---
on some maps you have a large need to runout to contest. like garage on chalet.
---
but in general you should need to run out. people do it for cheap kills.
---
what i have talked about with my friends is that the first minute of the game should have instant spotting if you run out. and then add one second for every minute of the game
---
Semi shotguns are iffy, they either murder quick or not at all... Except Elas and Frost's shotgun, they're blatant cheese
---
I don't think this is even a crosspost. This is just an insanely low res image.
---
I don't care, old games that came in 2005 had demo recorders, they could at least give me the date and time.
---
I can’t even get in today nor tomorrow lol, I’ll friend u then DM you when I can.
---
These are so bad. Bulwark being able to destroy his own team gadgets?! That would paint a target on his back from EVERYONE, even his own team. He would become the most hated operator overnight and he would have a lower pickrate than Tachanka. Valkyrie trying to throw her cams? Nope. Bulwark denied you. A bunch of shield ops rushing you with a Bulwark nearby? No problem. Throw your C4 to kill them, oh wait. Bulwark says no. The enemy team is securing the area and the only thing separating you and them is a soft wall? No problem! Throw an impact grenade... But wait! Bulwark says fuck you!
---
As for the other one, how tf would that help? Sound is the most valuable asset in the game. Choosing that operator would make distinguishing sounds damn near impossible, ESPECIALLY if you can hear every sound at once. You would not at all be able to determine the locations of said sounds and you DEFINITELY wouldn't be able to play the damn game if the whole team decided to rush and make as much noise as possible JUST to fuck you up. 
---
These operators would be hated amongst the community INSTANTLY. You think teamkilling is bad now... Just wait until THOSE operators step into the ring...
---
Counters recruit rushes lmaoo
---
Actually very good, great job
---
Get a five stack, learn the best vertical plant denials, learn the callouts, the tight angles to counter peek, use your drones effectively. The defenders have an inherent advantage in that you have to enter their turf - so don’t give them the deep angles, don’t give them uncontested peeks.
---
You’re literally complaining mostly about people with more game sense than you, and I totally get how that can be REALLY annoying. But if you learn the strategies they are using instead of complaining about them, it will really level the playing field.
---
Take every loss as a lesson, and use that to improve. If you can’t solo queue effectively, it may be time to stop or look for a group.
---
That happened to me one time.
---
Its got above average firerate, below average damage and fantastic recoil... I think it's like the MP5 minus acog and like 4 damage
---
I swear the outside of bank has 80 drone holes that I just don't know about
---
Looks pretty cool
---
just disable them for IQ. as far as i could tell it was only iq that could do it? if not my bad.
---
Yea but at least let us play on custom games or something.
---
Just use the SASG, or the lmg... The spear is prob the worst are in the game tbh
---
360 degree rotation but if you place it somewhere that it's blocked by something, it'll just not be able to turn around to those places
---
So tru
---
It was supposed to be a bullet hole
---
Am not looking to run the game at 200+ frames, am happy with 30-60 frames as long as the game runs fine.
---
You can though. Smg11 or vector across map through a wall and the op doesn’t even need to be over healed to survive it if you reach the right distance and damage drop off.
---
I concur with this smiting
---
Good point. I was mostly thinking that the red would be a secondary color instead of the primary (think of echo's logo, but the red is replaced with white and the white with red.)
---
More like Fortress. Damn that map!
---
K I can play Friday but then I wont get on for like 2 weeks probably
---
If you have the money and genuinely want to spend it on elite skins, go ahead. It is completely your decision, however if you have other things you need to buy that will benefit you in real life, do that. Dont pour a bunch of money into cosmetics when you need other things in real life. However, like I said, your money, your choice.
---
Yep, too bad ying just has ass guns and if you run it on lesson your missing out on one of the top guns on def
---
I mean you don’t have to though.. I play different people everyday and having a main doesn’t really mean anything. you can like a bunch of operators and that elite skin isn’t going anywhere. When you come back to that operator you’ll still have it.
---
I think instead of stunning the gaget should just deafen them. Not being able to hear for like 5 seconds is huge. A stun is a bit much and also doesn't make as much sense as a flashbang style deafening.
---
Might be talking about the cleaner acog that it has
---
Yup. Skyscraper is now 1 people actually attacking, and 4 covering runouts. Beautiful
---
Damage drop off has nothing to do with it. Any damage to the head is a kill. Period.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a drawing drone, I have given them to little kids, they just trace out shapes and makes drawing based on what you put the setting on, you can get them at Walmart for like 15 dollars
---
Hello SugarBearPeter, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bx6375/my_nicest_ace_so_far_and_defiantly_my_proudest_im/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Like I just said, don’t you think I’ve tried that already? I’ve played with people who honestly have some of the best aim I’ve seen in the game and we still lost because of either M&amp;K, cheap diamond strats, or smurfs.
---
But if any op had a claymore you could do it.. so even if they did, they could do it with any other.
---
Not this one exactly, but you can get one that looks similar.
---
It was worth a shot lasds.
---
My man fucking titan smashed her
---
I could see this being in the game, especially since it's made so professionally.
---
Right here this whole comment is why I drop golds from my squad. You always bitch about not knowing where enemies are. Use your fucking drones. Go in together. If you are pushing AS A TEAM, 1-2 people droning and 3 following.  I highly doubt you all would be dying. Objective is always the same every damn game: kill roamers, secure the fucking room. You think everyone plays exactly the same? It sounds like you expect everyone to do the same exact thing on every map. Get good!!!
---
honestly not sure y u created this thread. u asked for opinions and i gave u mine. i’ve played this game for almost 3 years and i’m a high rank.
---
Why did ya have to shake ur head. Passive aggressive 💯
---
I play on Console, so it goes all over the place you’re better off firing the Scorpion in burst
---
No thanks, that sounds like a silly idea.
---
I get it, runouts aren’t fun to deal with if you’re not at your best, especially if you’re playing against a higher level player. But at the higher levels of play runouts are risky and potentially rewarding. As it is, they’re mostly fair, except for maybe a few that could use some tweaks.
---
The team waited 10 secs, as we didn’t want to blast out way in, for the silent option
---
I’d call it unnecessary to keep people clearly waiting for the entrance 
---
Also smacking unbreakable areas knowingly was unnecessary 
---
But I went 0-3 in this encounter so I’ll say I was unnecessary

---
Lmao pretty much same for me, I’ll be on vacation after that.
---
Do people not like the super 90??
---
Droning doesn’t always fix every problem. In already as good as I can be. I play like a plat but it’s kinda hard to get there when everybody I play against is a smurf account using M&amp;K
---
Very detailed, tho the defender seems kind of op just from my imagination, basically like a better smoke ela hybrid.
---
The attacker seems to be quite the opposite. Her stuff feels kind of useless, ok cams don’t work, dokki can do that and more. With brightness settings darkness is no real threat either.
---
I have literally never seen or heard any even mention the challenges in game, much less team kill over the drones.
---
No, no ,no, no.

Yasssss betch.

He was having fun in a casual... Which is what casual is supposed to be, and I think that he was trying to make some new friends but it seems your squad are ass bags. Sorry but it's true Imo. Mabye next time just break down the door or go to different one, yacht has plenty of ways to get downstairs
---
Like I said, not true. There is just a insanely high damage multiplier to headshots. You can over come that fairly easily with over heals and penetration shots at distance. 
---
120 damage is a kill. 100-119 damage is a down. Over heal brings you health up to 140. If you can get a weak per shot weapon over a far enough distance or through enough walls it will not kill, just down. In very rare cases you could actually walk away from a headshot.
---
It’s never going to happen in a really game but it is possible. Please don’t spread that the headshot is an instant kill.
---
But it’ll be like proning in an old cod game, you’ll go onto the turret and not be able to move at all.
---
Looks cool af

It is what it is I suppose

Celebrate Clash's birthday by putting her back in the game
---
They T-bag me before.... 
---
And I hate that
---
they should add a higher powered scope for dmrs. i dont see any point using a dmr over an AR when both can use acog and be good at range, but ar can also be reliable close range. the only dmr actually worth using is the one BB uses. and well dokki, but its not like she has  much of a choice.
---
I’d rather fuck a cactus than play both maps
---
Yeahhhh... 
---
You didn't need to use a charge. You can just.. Punch it... 
---
You're also in casual... Don't expect everyone to be playing to win.
---
Idk why you're getting so defensive about this.
---
M&amp;K is valid, I’ll give you that - it is literal cancer. But cheap diamond strats? Man, if you can’t outplay a diamond you don’t deserve diamond rank, that’s all there is to it. They aren’t cheap strats, they pick an angle and you walk right into it, that’s in you. You get droned out and don’t rotate, they kill you from above, that’s on you. You get cross mapped by a 3 armour with ACOG because you’re sitting outside with your back exposed, that’s on you.
---
Every strategy a diamond can employ, you can too - level the playing field. Aim isn’t the only thing that wins games in Siege, this isn’t Call of Duty. Map knowledge, tight aim, recoil control, ability mastery are all things you have to nail down. If you can’t do that, then unfortunately, you aren’t a diamond.
---
Ppl like the super90 it’s just that it’s the only black ice you can actually buy
---
Or TK him. We’re just having fun in casual, after all.
---
I'm talking about the pinky in the trigger ring
---
But is it squishy?
---
One speedy boi?
---
Could we get something like this but darkercolors?
---
Where’s the petition at
---
Exept no?
---
I haven't seen any mention about restricting ranks in groups or using the highest MMR, so this will still happen next season.
---
BUT we get pick and ban, so maybe in another 3 years it'll happen.
---
Maybe mute text chat? Could also be a PM through UPlay but the former sounds more likely
---
Lol yes sir
---
Yes please
---
Do they stick to walls?
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
I love Tower.
---
I think the idea is that even if you weren’t cheating, you still benefitted from cheating. So it’s most fair to just pretend like the match never happened.
---
You rarely see older people competing in leagues because it wasn’t even a thing 10 years ago lol
---
Not really. The mpx doesn't move while things like 416-c MP7 mp5k still have recoil that cant be accounted for
---
Mouse and Keyboard users. Some games on Xbox have been updated to allow mouse and keyboard use but ubisoft didn't implement it and they consider it's use as cheating. Some players get around it by buying adapters. Unfortunately, these players are very common on console. I encounter them at least 2 out if every 5 games.
---
watch varsity gaming’s video on it
---
Right. So unnecessary
---
Gotta punch it one time first. Works every time
---
Hey you’re one of the guys from unrenowned right?? I love that podcast lol keep up the good work!
---
What’s the solution to grenade destroying laser turrets. 
---
Simple: more grenades
---
On normal game I never seen that either, but in Road to SI / Rainbow is magic... OH BOY
---
It's like they think no one can cheat on console. They can't like outright ban m&amp;k because they can't detect it but they can at least try to do SOMETHING
---
Gtfo are you being for real?

Also nice edit 👍🏼

Yeah, I have 2 friends who were participating on the last free weekend, and it was a disaster, I mean both of them bought the game but there were only smurf idiots who were disrespecting to gain free elo, I mean this can affect on the newcomer's opinion, and if u got balls go play against someone your elo I mean these guys just want to try  out the game man.

---
It's all neck or head bud. That's what that gun lives for and it is a monster for them. Once you drop some time on it you can drain head shots due to minimal recoil and high RPM. But yes one of the lowest DPS's in the game and anything past meadium distance it turns into a BB gun.
---
Youre the one whining about people having fun in ranked. Also im p1. I dont see how the 3 weeks of playing part is a good thing. Someone who cares about comp as much as you should be able to get it in a few days. I dont even give a shit and i got it in a day

Hello toxic_gamer21, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bx72cu/r6_crash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Lmao yeah dumb reason.

More that i didn’t want to fire my rifle bc you know Glas is on the field with that sound. 
---
...fucking kool-aid man lol
---
Chinese knock off
---
In game settings?
---
Not only is this scummy to do but posting on here is a bad idea. GL with not getting banned
---
if this isnt a joke, dont base ur main off one round of casual. not enough to tell
---
Lots of players could mean 200 people.
---
It’s not a bug. People can hack at any rank. It just so happened that someone in copper decided to hack and you played with them once and won.
---
Sorry bro, I got Black Ice on MP7 at like... level 5. I didn't even realize how lucky I was. Feelsbadman
---
Breaking news Jägers pick rate drops to 0
---
Lots of reasons. Its Casual, which is considered to be pointless and of no consequence. It's the generally accepted place and time to do things like that, if your down 0-2 you've got poor odds of going 2-2. And why not? Its casual.
---
r/frc what team where you on I'm one 1421 chaos
---
oh yea lmao I forgot. i dont play ranked that much
---
Physics are client side so sledge already open it and wje you punched it the wall updated I guess
---
STOP PINGING BRO!
---
do u have some features blocked?
---
Ya I know
---
I honestly never knew able superf4 until this thread so I might just do that haha.
---
 Am I the only one who enjoys tower here?
---
I love favela, it’s a wet dream for anyone playing buck. I just think that the objective should never be located on the top floor
---
Yes but sometimes is really clear if he use mnk, but at least they can su something against the macro(rapid fire, crouch spam, anti recoil ecc). This is super easy to detect and they don’t have excuses
---
I said CASUAL go read the thread again. You can’t even read what i’m saying and you’re here talking about ranks. 
---
I care about competitive, but playing OW for those 6 months, has changed my mind and my hands so it takes longer to get used to again. 
---
And no i think you’re lying about your rank, if i said plat 1 you would say you were diamond.
---
Not possible because if you have the physical disk you can't link the disk to the account. They can add a online pass for like 10 bucks that you get "free" if you buy the game new but need to purchase if you buy second hand or if you already activated the game. BF3 did this for gready ass reasons so such a thing can exist. The fact of the matter is smurfing will never stop. Unless smurfs need to pay 60+ per account they will never stop. Even then some of them will still buy it. The only options that stop smurfing hurt legitimate players.
---
He tried, he is a hero
---
Tried to be a bit less toxic even if you were acting like a cunt
---
Agreed
---
Huh?
---
Because lardex spawn peeked
---
Stop reposting it, it's really not that funny.
---
Tower is the worst tho
---
At least favela is fun ☹️
---
Ah a man of culture I see, Frost was my first Dlc op and is my top operator still to this day. Anyway the way you wanna use her is put her mats in places where people least expect them. I’ve found that the stupider the place is the more likely you’ll catch someone in them. Putting them flush with windows and other vaultable objects is a good tactic as well. Just make sure you aren’t picking her every round because of the enemy gets used to a frost on the other team they will be looking very very closely for your traps. I hope this helps and best of luck :)
---
Yeah that sounds about right.
---
I respect any Jäger main that wears the safety helmet. Can’t even be mad.
---
Can i learn this power?
---
First time I’ve seen it mate
---
Takes one to kno one! Lol jk
---
She’s stronk
---
It isn't always the easiest to see but if you watch a player for like 15 seconds you can usually tell without hardly any doubt
---
It was worth a try
---
If you want to main frost then the first step is not accidentally saying you want to maim her.
---
No credit to artist or anything? Low effort title, too. smh
---
I’d play tower 1,000 times before playing the new Hetford Base
---
Then why don't they ban it? When clearly they use mnk, they never get banned
---
maybe cav but sledge just gets completely outclassed by buck and kapkan sucks with non-lethal traps that you can just run through
---
Rip old Hereford
---
Okay man! 🤙🤞👌👍
---
first Beaulo, now Godly on Kixstars team?
---
How the mpx doesn’t move it might shoot peas but it shoots them straight
---
r/Trophies !! Congrats tho my friend this is one to be proud of. Which trophy was worst for you, Meat Wall or 100 protect hostage ?
---
Glad to see I was persuasive
---
They should’ve made changes to casual before making changes to ranked imo. Because now in order to get a decent game, you have to play Bomb with that 3 round rotation thing (which makes it really boring in my opinion)
---
I hated tower until the other day when I ran through on terrorist hunt solo and realized how fun it is. Not too easy like house, not too hard like favela. Just the right amount of challenge for me.
---
I do, you can contact me over at insta or Twitter @asvittart if you're interested.
---
Just as Mav or any op?
---
It’s the cool skin EVERY valk runs
---
Imo, Bartlett was better than tower.
---
I’d like to see them do a “return to classic” playlist.
---
I've been trying to do defends on plane and just spawn peeking them to speed it up but it just gets so boring.
---
If hes doing bad, i dont give it. If hes positive i give it
---
Yeah no I stopped playing for awhile like others and haven't spent a dime on the game in ages just like the people who still play it hence the money they are losing ;) fix ya attitude before it really affects them :)
---
'hops on siege for a couple matches'
---
Whatever
---
Yeah, turns out repealing off the side of a several hundred story building and disallowing spawn peaking is something I like
---
I would sometimes just hand it over or I'd say, "Hey you can play her next round, okay?"
---
AND HE’S GOTTA BE FAST
---
Hello Andreas_DK, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bx8075/check_out_my_videoes/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yall have a robotics class, is it for an FRC team or is it a class about bots?
---
I do but only if they are doing good with that op. It annoys the hell outta me when I’m top fragging with a certain op and the bottom fragger picks him.
---
Dang :/ guess ill have to stick to calling them cowards in messages
---
My take is I’ll give someone an operator IF:
---
A) they’ve been using it for the entire match
---
B) they’ve shown to use that operator very well in previous rounds
---
I see no legitimate reason why you should’ve taken that persons operator. Especially when you’re telling us that they were using it the entire match. Why throw them off their flow? It’s like going ash every round and then forcing the ash player to go Monty or something.
---
Casual in a nutshell
---
&gt;Favela
---
&gt;Tower
---
MATCH POINT, 0-2
---
No, but the details will be coming very soon!
---
If they’re cool during the game then generally I would do it. But if they’re a toxic asshole the entire game...then they can go fuck themselves lol. If you think they can actually pull their weight then sure. But to me, it really depends how they were through the game.
---
I've just said they can't detect it. If they just banned people on suspicion many innocent players would get banned because MnK is the favorite excuse when people die. I've personally been called MnK 3 times and I use a standard DS4. I'd be banned for doing nothing wrong if they banned on a wiff.
---
I play console, too, so it's mighty difficult to aim sometimes, especially for headshots.
---
f
---
what rank tho??
---
Ok see no op is any tier i say this because bikinibodhi plays clash n tachanka like a god ops require skill not ratings
---
It is luck. You could be going up against diamonds who are 10x better than you and no matter how good your team is, you will lose
---
When you get counter spawn peeked :^)
---
It's always Thatcher.
---
I said this a long time ago! It would actually be cool to play everything modern, but no DLC operators.
---
Playing the newer maps without newer ops would be very interesting.
---
They have access to round replays and stuff like that. They could if they cared enough. It ruins the game for me..
---
Isn’t reverse image searching a thing
---
I thought that was vigil lmao
---
They have a death grip on that map that makes bungie's hold on enhancement look like a dainty handshake
---

Yea. Having gone out and read the book (which is pretty good btw) I really appreciated the revamp of Hereford.
---
I love tower. Please don't.
---
&gt;You can now use the keyboard to navigate the PS4™ system menus, input text, browse the web, and more.
---
Does it say you can now use it to play games? No. If you did that and loaded up Siege you still can't play with MnK.
---
The whole operation health idea is ridiculous. They should be able to release content 4 times a year and still fix bugs. They just need to get their shit together
---
Til they sneak up on you around a corner or a set of stairs. They train you but it gets annoying I want to play terrorist hunt not practice caution and headshots
---
Trying to get og Hereford Base back &gt;deleting Tower.
---
Fuze. 
---
Best defender on Hostage matches.
---
Ooh shiny
---
It's just too big and the lighting sucks. Been playing since White Noise and I still get lost on that map lol
---
Why not, exactly?
---
Honestly if the person is doing really great with the operator &amp; your team is winning then I'd let them take the operator for sure because you don't want to ruin or lessen your chances of winning. But if they're doing okay &amp; even k/d (1/1, 3/3/, 5/5) regardless of winning or losing then no I'm not giving back &amp; someone else should run it to try increase your chances of winning the match.
---
Copper XD, I lost my silver rank yesterday, too many losses
---
Very
---
CB? I'm not sure what that means
---
Thatll happen what 1 maybe 2 games. Also 1 or 2 diamonds arnt enough to single handedly win games
---
Round replays don't detect MnK either.
---
lolno competitive gaming was definitely already a thing in 2010, CS:S was released in 2004 for reference.
---
Plus, older players would join anyway if they still were able to play competitively, same thing happens in other sports for the exact same reasons...
---
I hate playing it because it's not in ranked and because it's the only map I get when I play casual.
---
He won’t be tweeting ever again once cav’s done with him....
---
I’m on ps4 and I hardly can get a single game , even in Xbox I can’t find a game too , it seems dead to me anyway , I play in the Australian server

I dunno. It doesn't really seem like a good idea. :/ I do like your art tho!
---
oh no I just mentioned replied to a comment of yours about wanting Ela’s elite set too and you said something along the lines of “Me: wants all vase ops so have an elite set, Also Me: WHEN IS ELA ELITE BEING CONFIRMED SKSKSK”
---
Hopefully next season sees some big changes
---
Das bringt ein Lächeln auf mein Gesicht.

r/GermanThanos
---
I would recommend maistro for the lower levels and nokk for the higher levels
---
What issues are you running into? Honestly my only problem was the clash deployable shield glitch.
---
The new one is "ok". My biggest issue is the third floor. Its completely irritating to attack and defenders have the advantage of limited access points. It is chosen as the first place to defend on both teams for more then half the time it comes around and it sucks.
---
Meat wall lol. It took me so long to complete. The terror hunt sucked too because the website didn't have the specific tracking for my kills.
---
Ubisoft doesn't care about console. Report toxic behaviour doesn't do anything, it's for text chat. You could be the worst person to exist and get away with it. I don't think I've seen anyone get banned on console
---
No, your hit box is to gay to let you have one
---
Ubisoft should let players on xbox filter the maps they want and don't want.  I would just play house all the time
---
Only if he is carrying hard and i know he is about to jump out
---
So beautiful, a masterpiece if I must say 🥰
---
Im thinking of making her 2 speed and downgrading her weapon for a bit.
---
This is beyond stunning, can we get black ice for all our weapons?
---
Look lemme just tell you that the reason why I know you thought I was white is because you assumed just cause I told you that the internet works the way it does (saying racist stuff) you assumed that I was okay with it and to “to take my racist ass somewhere else” which you didn’t directly say I was white but I can guarantee you didn’t think I’m black. But either way my point is that you going to have people that say racist stuff regardless if the guy you are trying to get banned gets banned or not which if you feel like your saving the world by doing it go ahead one less racist guy on R6 I guess but my overall message is that you and others need to learn to deal with racism online as just like you said no one can beat them up online as they can in the real world so people will say racist stuff to get under your skin. And you reporting him and saying to me to get my racist ass out of here IS THE EXACT REASON WHY THEY DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO GET A REACTION OUT OF YOU
---
OP complained about having to deal with toxic players. This is my answer, better to be in a squad with friends than solo que into a toxic bunch.
---
I hope you aren't mad at me for giving a suggestion.
---
&gt;jackal is underpowered
---
C7E, smokes, and extremely effective gadget. Anyone who thinks he's underpowered is mad.
---
That the definition of spray and pray lol
---
nope, f2 recoil is being increased quite a bit
---
r/beatlejuicing
---
 **Nokk:** to move a lot more quietly and all-but disappear from any opposition observation tools such as Drones, Bulletproof Cameras, and Evil Eyes. 
---
**Vigil:** can hide from cameras.
---
Some of these you’ll get the hang of the more you play, and others don’t really have a definite answer. I tend to take out my secondary whenever I’m in close range since I can see easier with its iron sights, but there’s other people that only take it out when their primary needs to reload and they don’t have time. 
---
When picking operators try watching some YouTube videos to see which gadget/guns you’d like more. Remember just because somebody is super good with an op doesn’t mean you’ll be. 
---
The entire game just comes down to peoples’ preferences. Try out different primaries, secondaries, and gadgets see what fits you more. Go into some private matches to check the guns recoil and range if you need to. Good luck!
---
You mean LEANING
---
Press your thumbsticks in

Explain to me why Blackbeard is unbalanced

also, i use flash hider and acog, its not hard to control, but on tts it is annoying

Looks awesome

Thank you! Glad you like it :3

Nokk is an attacker
---
Vigil is a defender
---
I'm LV 37 and I got a black ice for ash at LV 20
---
What if you beat a cheater?
---
Yes very rare for me at least I haven’t gotten one. (Level 90)
---
dude favela is so fun wtf. grab Sledge and every wall is coming down
---
DOUBLE POINTS!
---
Visual bug not a nerf
---
How much does it cost $$$
---
Black ice came out in season 1 year 1, the skin is only available for the base operators along with Buck and Frost for all their weapons.
---
Bcs they look very cool and are quite rare. Since 95% of the skins kn the game looks lile shit or dont make a difference black ice stands out. And gongrats. I have 1 black ice myself, it felt good to get it
---
&gt;most modern fps have this kind of feature
---
I don't know how appropriate it is to compare Siege to other modern FPSs considering there is no game quite like Siege.
---
It's a nice skin, way overhyped, used to be very rare but now most people have it for at least one gun you can get it for.
---
Kinda rare? Even more rare to get it on a good gun especially on your main.
---
I thought being so rare they would be legendary?
---
Mines is Rainbow: six: siege
---
solo que = bad
---
I refuse to spawn peek. It's the scummiest move
---
Ok. But it doesn't actually stretch them. It just flattens them. Reducing the FOV would make them just as wide at 16:9. This dude is littlerly playing at a flatter version of 60 FOV right now.
---
Thanks that helps a lot I didn't know that
---
Heavily defender favored with the spawn peeks, only one door into the whole entire building....
---
Yeah, it was a horrible map
---
I love maverick, good plays
---
When you try your best but you dont succeeeed...
---
I've got it for the MP7, L85A2, C8-SFW, Super 90, SG-CQB and P9.
---
My pleasure, always nice to pass along knowledge!
---
This is true
---
Sorry to hurt ur feelings but I’m feeling pretty hyped about the new dlc
---
silver 4 normie
---
So attacker automatically is justification for getting OP abilities that makes a defender like Vigil look insipid ?
---
*Russian National anthem starts playing for our lord*
---
You can still play it in Situations but it's obviously not the same
---
Funny, this is one of the maps I can play Twitch on because I know where the staircases are....
---
Ha I havnt played since launch months just got into the game
---
New op nokk is invisible for cams you can see just enviroment movement... Defenders are on cams. If you can't see enemy you have a problem.
---
Make sure if you get a HyperX headset you go with one that has a detachable cable. I had a set that didn’t and my wire split causing my audio to cut out completely.
---
Its been 2 months and there are a lot of players killing the drone far after its captured.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Google baby
---
Shit gun too
---
I’m of the opinion that it’s just a game, but if you have to have a particular character then you better be running an SSD w/ a stellar connection.
---
Bruh, it's the rules, you don't have throw a fit over it.
---
Tachanka belongs in a Triple S+ rank
---
And again playing in casual is far more toxic than ranked
---
In ranked enemies tend to take the game more seriously
---
Pretty shitty excuse to ruin other people's enjoyment, not gonna lie. Yeah the no transfer sucks, but still.
---
Don’t know what to tell you man, sure he’s a dick but it’s the internet. Probably not the best place for you if you care so much about getting a guy banned for being racist.
---
Back when the Bearing was *really really* good I used the Nova all the time, that combination was cheese as hell. Now that machine pistols are toned down there's absolutely no reason to pick it.
---
Chibi codes?
---
No. I really don't understand the hate for it at all other than not learning the map.
---
Do it yourself with a plane and some engunuity
---
Nah definitely not the worst lmg
---
Ok have a nice night
---
Tower isn’t a great map but I always get a ton of kills on it so it’s okay in my book
---
Same here, ive had multiple drones captured during prep phase just sitting there glowing white and teams destroy them anyway, its annoying af

You posted a photo of a casual game.

Not to mention at night time the map is beautiful :(

I just miss the 100 defences mannnn

Delete favela?
---
Shenei, kakyoin!
---
The only thing that matters is winning
---
In your other comment you said you suck at it so it must take some skill, that or you’re just really bad.   
---
A huge part of this game is learning angles. With peekers advantage you can easily kill spawn peekers if you know where they will be.
---
Probably not. I was only replying like this because of the OP context. He seemed to be taking it seriously, so I did too.
---
Bruh how deep of a scroll are you on for 11 daat old post to come up?
---
[removed]
---
the purpose of a solo queue playlist is to be matched with other people playing solo. banning communication is moronic. this game is based around team communication. banning it entirely is moronic. how would it be possible to do things as simple as breaching a wall if you can’t communicate.
---
#🦀🦀🦀 CAV’S GONE🦀🦀🦀
---
y'all need jesus
---
To me, two in particular stand out. The Supernova and the FMG-9. Both are just terrible guns. The Supernova is really only good for softwall destruction, but Hibana has breaches for that. The FMG-9, on the other hand, is just *horrendously* bad in all departments.
---
Oddly enough we did
---
U could do the echo spawn peek with the yokais
---
nope. just your garbage internet
---
I think people only recently figured out how to do it effectively, I saw Evan’s video a couple days ago and saw talk of it before that. Seems legit though, and it generally follows party invites on Xbox.
---
Classic Libtard. Hahahahhahahahahahaha

IMO it looks like someone spilled lemonade in a pool, but it's not actually that bad.

Best feel ever to counter spawn peek
---
Ok, also, do you use the lmg?
---
Yings is ass, only good thing is the mag and was the reload, bow it's just the mag
---
Is it only for the seal ops
---
Is it a camera or just LEDs?
---
It’s good for newcomers to play against better players so they can see an example of how to play better
---
Oh shit I forgot about that
---
IQs lmg is great, high rof decent damage and fantastic recoil... Only has 50 rounds as an lmg but other than that it's nuts, and IQs ARs are pretty mediocre as well

i don't know how :(
---
Someone spelled "peeked" properly !
---
HHAHAHAAHA... .    Love it.   Do more
---
Communication is a part of siege as much as aim and positioning
---
The only thing it really takes is speed and possession which takes a little bit of practice but honestly not a lot of scale which is why I'm not good at it because I don't waste my time practicing something that I don't like doing especially when all 4 of my team mates are trying to do it at the same time.
---
It's not really skillful and it does ruin some maps
---
well looks like I'm fucked, thx for telling me tho
---
Actually no. Glaz's dmr with supppressor now takes 1 more shot to kill unless u are within 10 metres. Thanks to 81 damage nerf from 180. Gun like f2 shines better without suppressor. It just boosts TTK pretty huge. F2 will take 2 more  bullets to kill beyond 15 metres whivh is bad because then TTK for the smg and ar will be same so you wont have firepower advantage anymore.
---
I have used suppressor on every gun INCLUDING buck's C8 in italy+ grim sky season just to see if its really worth the long run. It wasn't anywhere except on glaz, but lining up shots with suppressed OTS is hardest part there. If its about being stealthy behind smoke u can probably prone and enemy will prefire above u in most cases.
---
Frost's smg seems to have no disadvantage with suppressor ever though. I would love to put honorable mention here of r4c. Non existent recoil + general play style of ash makes her immune to damage nerf on her rifles. Unless you tryin to hold long angles ofc
---
#**you just had to fucking say it**
---
Why this picture tho ?
---
Too bad. Just tell them to get good lul XD
---
Not true, the Sterling was a 45 caliber while the Sten was a 9mm. Certain variations exist ofc but the model of the iron sights and mag curvature makes it the Sten, modernized
---
I have that one &gt;:)

funny coming from a blackbeard main

*to those who fell for long con: you fell victim to one of the classic blunders!

Oh there are people who make excuses in every game, but it is accepted that they are a jerk. You start a round in Overwatch and your Mei locks your team in the spawn room? They are a jerk. Your teammate purposely feeding in League? They are a jerk, and you will definitely report them for it. Only in the siege community do people fight tooth and nail for the right for people to be jerks to their teammates because 'it is casual, so get over yourself'. It is ridiculous, and part of the toxicity of this game. You shouldn't be held hostage by teammates that have no intention of playing the game correctly, no matter what game you are playing. A 'casual' queue does not excuse that kind of behavior. 
---
Casual queue is to escape the pressures of needing to be well informed and skilled at the game, operators, and maps. Casual queue is not an escape from trying to actually play the game correctly. 
---
That isn't Purple-Man's ruleset, that is common sense. Personally, in whatever game, people with that kind of attitude, that subject teammates they don't know to griefing, I'm reporting them. Sorry to be a party pooper, get some friends and run a custom game.
---
That one costs 60$ right?
---
I expected that tbh, 3v5? Too outmatched
---
I just went 14-4, lost 5-3 and played down a man for the last 5 rounds and I lost 50 something MMR. Winning is the only thing that matters which I think is stupid.
