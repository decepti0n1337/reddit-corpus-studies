Fuck you

To an extent they are right. I encourage you to give it a shot anyway.  While it happens in ranked its likely not as much as casual.

Back in a time when inverted controls were the only option.

I‚Äôve been getting a lot of this in ranked the last day or so and have lost games because of it.

I‚Äôm not completely surprised though. With it getting tougher to team kill it was only a matter of time  before they found another way to be toxic.

Alright I‚Äôll try it.

Its a matter of answering the question. Not everything in this game makes sense, for example, you can sprint after being hit with a bear trap, nanobots exist, and interacting with a hologram reveals your location. It doesnt matter WHY she gets hit by flashbangs, only that she does. No one questions WHY touching a hologram can reveal your location. Or WHY you can sprint after being stuck in a bear trap. You dont question the why, only the whether or not.
---
I think because you have sign into your Ubisoft account
---
Looks like 20% to me

If you are roaming and an attacker doesn‚Äôt know where you are in a room, that gives vigil a big advantage. Information is big thing and any information you can deny your opponent is worth a bunch. Sure, they can know he‚Äôs ‚Äúnear,‚Äù but he can be behind any corner or hiding behind anything. Plus, how can you say it‚Äôs the most useless gadget when an immobile turret exists?

This is so painfully obvious that it was edited. The game shows premade images, and does not add each operators "skin" onto a pose to construct each image at OP-pick time, that's just so inefficient. So this is impossible.

Aren't lots of the meme channels that article 13 just took down in the same boat except they are even more fucked?
---
That is the problem with this game. One person can make an entire match bad.
---
1050 or 1050 ti model?
---
That's fair
---
Capitaos ability is an area effect tool. This is more like a directed blast, and the blast is a 2 1/2 meter long blast of fire and burning magnesium that flash bangs people outside the range of the blast of fire and burns whoever is right in the path of the blast. So its got offensive capabilities and secondary capabilities
---
So true it is so unfair because it is known to be easier to aim with a mnk so would be logic if you played against mnk not some console player who can't hold those really tight angles and mnk has better reaction time console aim has it's disadvantages but if every one has them it would okay

The thing that's cool about her is that she caters to two different play-styles with just having two different primaries.
---
If you like rushing, you can use the AK-74M and push with her ability.
---
If you like hanging back and supporting your team, you can use the ARX and fire in bursts or semi auto and use the airjabs to lock down doors so your teammates can't be flanked when trying to push.
---
Ok thanks for the clarification but these ops would be meta changing also mira and blockade would be fierce together
---
Ahem.  This is not Fortnite.  We do not randomly get rid of something because it is good/bad.  We make changes until it is determined to be balanced.  Take Lion for example.  He was nerfed and buffed until now, and he is now a balanced operator.    The ideas behind both Clash and Tachanka are valid, and, while they both need work, they both have potential.

I hate this post. Rainbow 6 originated from a brilliant series by the author Tom Clancy (RIP). Just because a game was made about the characters, it doesn‚Äôt mean that they are the first incarnation of them.
---
Or they're in a party...
---
Shaking up the meta was my main inspiration for creating these operators, but I also tried to give them a glaring nerf to keep them from becoming overpowered (hotshot only has a shotgun as a main, so she has little long range firepower unless you want to take shots with a comparatively weak pistol, while blockades bar grates are hard to break through, but they offer no cover in comparison to a castle barricade so an enemy or sniper can shoot right through it, and you only get one)

Agreed, simple fix - instead of the matchmaker using the average, use the highest players rank. Preferably in conjunction with a soft cap (+2/-2), the only significant drawback is the smurf account situation would get worse as a result.

based on how much I die to each character I'd say maverick.
---
I am a total noob so don't put too much weight in my opinion. but when I reinforce walls and put my back against them maverick always gets me.
---
Its a glitch if you pull out your nade then put it away the game think you "pulled the pin".
---
Mav based on ur main ops
---
You ever look into Buck's soft eyes? Well, I have. I have a LOT.

I‚Äôd say maverick

Some people like the realistic/battle worn looks. Some people like the gaudier and more colourful ones.

You have to trigger them with the button you use to select the item on pc its middle mouse.
---
you can fire more than one set and trigger all at once, good for rushing a room and trying to confuse your enemy which window you will choose.

Mutes jammer can jam them.

In the control settings you can adjust the stick dead zone so your controls are more instant if that helps

Nomad is good for solo/casual

Hibana is good for both and team play too.

Put that on a list of places they won't shoot from in a while...

Wow!

there's viable alternatives to the SMGs, if you're not aware. the C75 has a statistically better TTK, the SMG-11 isn't hard to control with a compensator, &amp; the P225(?) isn't a bad pistol. just play terrorist hunt &amp; figure out how much you need to pull down on your thumbsticks, it's not hard

Maverick's elite skin should be what he's wearing in his bio on the other side just my idea but tachanka

---
so cute!
---
thank you sir c:

nigga the game already has motherfucking holograms what's wrong with having them move

Tf u mean as in what hes wearing in his bio, do you support the elite animation i made for him.
---
from meh to woah
---

You look like the crazy ex me from early 2000

I've started referring to Sledge as Thor. He really is the god of hammers.

That skin is based off the Lebel WW1 french rifle
---
I have it for the 417 as well, too bad it‚Äôs quite literally the worst DMR in the game. It really needs a buff.
---
That would be completely broken
---
Who plays hostage lol, too many people who think it‚Äôs funny to murder him and too many people abusing the prevent revive glitch
---
The lack of cropping says this is stolen from someone else
---
Sure, since technically that is her primary weapon. I feel like devs don‚Äôt want people running around with their sidearms and destroying people in close quarters(that is what Hibana could do before the nerf)
---
What was your ping?
---
Won't it feel nice when he gets banned and you lose rating.

You don't have an opinion either, you just posted "nope".
---
But is it not what sidearms are for?
---
Wait is it?
---
 NO NO NO.I‚Äôm fookin tired of this. Hostage is basics of basics in Rainbow Six, if you can‚Äôt just understand that you don‚Äôt need to shot yellow marker with ‚Äúextract‚Äù,than you‚Äôre dumbass. I know a lot of people that plays on Hostage,this is a lot of fun mode, so if it will not be in Ranked, it will be second most awful mistake of Ubi in this game
---
Those k/d ratios

Not gonna lie I jumped from my chair

Thanks. Good to know

I feel these type of headsets would help with the wearing it in the helmet.

---
This is so satisfying

What game
---
You can always try. Take this video as an example. It‚Äôs in Russian but you don‚Äôt really need to know what he says. You can also get pretty damn close to this for about ‚Ç¨150 less and even less if you can the helmet yourself. There is a company in Indonesia making Defender 2 (the body armor) replicas for about 1/3 the price. You can also get a specific harness from aliexpress wich looks quiet a bit like a SMERSH but for 1/10 the price.

Sometimes it may be completely necessary tbh like say the person who didn't clutch had tons of opportunities to clutch but still didn't or if they had the worst aim in the world. Either of those are completely valid reasons to kick.

Can you also put your pinkie fingers up and shake your head a few times?
---
15 or 16
---
 This is cool, only thing-you did the hand sign wrong
---
Keep in mind that putting a frost mat that close to the wall below a window may result in the attacker not being trapped. Since that's a window they can only vault through, they will definitely get trapped, but an attacker can skip the trap if it's perfectly attached to the wall below a window that you can only reach by rappelling.
---
You look cute as heck

No problem üòÇ

Idk really, i believe its 11 or 12

Nomad, she‚Äôs faster and has a pretty big aoe on her gadget. Gridlocks gadget is useless if a roamer has a silencer.
---
To add to that, Gridlocks hitbox appears to be the same as a truck
---
Tbh happens a lot on console because melee and lean left are bound to pressing the stick in and often times you click it in before aiming so you melee on accident.
---
There's an app for that, random operator to play and you pick it.
---
The beep gives me more anxiety than all of my high school experience.

you stop getting people at match point

Just look at ur own vid closely dude. U can clearly see his head was a bit more to the left. U were shooting at his thick collar. U missed cuz of the angle ure shooting at.

I don't like mira

In casual, you can't go back into the game. But in ranked, if you crash, you can still join by doing '' play rank'' even if you get separated of your team. When match starting, you will join the same session.

I feel like when Mira isn't on active duty she's definitely a soccer mom

you said it like you played as copper on purpose only cause its casual. I dont believe you. Its still awful play in terms of basic movement and awareness...even if its terrorist hunt. Thats why it gives me headache.
---
There is Deustch for voice and written and Arabic for written language
---
Had to triple check that that wasn't C9 Sneaky again
---
It never does. It does the average. I have never seen a case of this happening.
---
And using highest mmr also means this method still exists. 1 plat in squad v 1 plat in another squad
---
The flick? Yes. 
---
The gamemode? Not so much
---
JK you do what you want
---
Yeah you basically took what Ubi already told and called it "basic and simple fix".
---
Ubi released a blog last year where they said **exactly that**. The question we should all be asking is why hasn't that been implemented yet.
---
I need this in slow motion
---
I love it &lt;3
---
my buddy was prefiring the wall with glaz lmao
---
Y3s3, all recoils got altered, along with the sight misalignment issue. Buck's and ash's was reduced.
---
Exactly. This should be present in all games
---
Ah, ok.
---
But what situation would arise that would cause someone to ask that?
---
Hope when ranked comes out of beta, they implement this.
---
How recent?
---
[For everyone too lazy to look it up themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkOK8tdEsFY)

The last update that came, I think it happened last week sometime
---
I really don't care about this anymore, but I was in this situation before. When I was mid gold a few years back. It's no fun when players abuse this system. 
---
Friends is a bad excuse, cuz you will matchmake higher regardless
---
/u/EnderTheMeme Probably because of the music.

It's [His Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkOK8tdEsFY) from Undertale.
---
Hmmm.....
---
There was an update a week ago? Really?
---
Must have missed it. Wrong person to comment. Sorry.
---
I see you‚Äôre not reading what I‚Äôm saying, you just said you would get 4 coppers and 1 diamond, which is close to 1 plat and 4 silvers, which means the method they already use works. The idea of ‚Äúfind the exact squad or find something close to it‚Äù would mean what I‚Äôve just explained. You‚Äôre acting as if a squad of full golds would be placed with 1 diamond 4 coppers which has never happened to me since I started playing.
---
I'm sorry but Reddit is not a bug reporting site, I'm posting this as a joke. Nobody claimed this made the game unplayable.
---
It's fucking entertainment, chill
---
That's something they should accept, being in the same stack and knowing the ranks and risks. You can't even set a mid ground since the gap between plat and diamond is way higher than people think, and the gap between silver and gold as well.
---
yeah what
---
K thanks
---
We all know that's a lie. Daimonds and coppers queue for boosting. You can check this very subreddit and find it out
---
;(
---
It was behind the scenes stuff https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1123551377857372160
---
And those recruits from that time could be the Main Operators now...
---
--Mind Blown--
---
Oh for fuck sake, I know they queue for boosting but if I‚Äôm playing and the rest of my squad of a bunch of silvers then I‚Äôm going to be sent straight back to plat with the method you‚Äôre suggesting, then making it so I‚Äôd never want to play with my silvers friends again.
---
why no sound :c+
---
Illuminati: delete this

If you want :-(

Thanks!

Are you insane? What about:

What if you want to answer somebody's question of what f-ing country you are from??
---
Actually true, was low gold in OW and high bronze in R6 (maybe because I only play 10 rankeds who knows)
---
I play even better with him now i feel like it was a buff for me.
---
You have to restart the game, it usually works.
---
This lesion was pretty blind huh?

Congrats on plat!

As a man this makes me.very uncomfortable.

You didn't have to vote kick him immediately.

I was able to do it just after he released the video. But afterwards it seems to have been fixed without any patch notes asserting it. Thanks for the input!
---
Thanks! I wanted to draw the tattoo but I didn't have time that day. Next time I shoot it'll be there!
---
Let's see. But I hope ubi teases us with something soon. I'm starting to lose my shit
---
I can‚Äôt testify as I don‚Äôt play siege anymore due to exams etc. However he thing which I‚Äôve seen separate the good and bad teams/players is the communication. Anyone can be good with aim but it‚Äôs about giving the right amount of detail in as little words/time as possible. It‚Äôs more about the synergy between the players. Some players are just on the same wavelength. Having a good mix of comfortable players in different roles helps a bunch.
---
Something I always struggled with was pressure. Rank didn‚Äôt matter to me but being the angsty teen I was, I worried about letting the team down. And consequentially loosing them as team members to play with. Consequentially my perfect team member is one who‚Äôs supportive and a positive attitude no matter what.

I‚Äôve played with a lot of people who get too narrow minded about the game as well, you need to look at the rounds individually rather than having that tilt that is ‚Äúwe need to win this round‚Äù.
---
I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that it‚Äôs a game of psychology for me more than skill, reading the other players is difficult but also reading yourself and your team mates can be too. Just make sure you find the best team mates to develop together as players.
---
It‚Äôs whatever he was just shooting at the guy he saw what was going on after though and didn‚Äôt shoot the 2nd guy
---
That‚Äôs just the default skin right?
---
I mean one point is one point, maybe you'll need it later
---
Oh like in the priest video where someone is on the roof and tries to kill the people before they reach the other side of the map
---
Cus castle looks like Kanye west
---
It hurts watching this
---
It blows my mind that you fit that cosplay so well it‚Äôs amazing you do the r6 community so proud
---
It doesn't count if you just use a screenshot from the game!
---
Gonna need to slap a map of Afghanistan on that forearm mate! Great cosplay though!
---
I've seen someone with 9999 ping before, so no.
---
I liked your comment anyways, but you wrote Coastline and Boarder as if the original post creator said they only play those maps. Also you did not specify ‚ÄúRanked map pool‚Äù.
---
Rook. A cog too strong
---
Perhaps an idea that you can pick every operator in the shooting range aslo the ones you haven't unlocked so you can try them out
---
same dude I'm getting more angry not seeing leaks here, I have a feeling Kormora is done with her leaking and it's up to ubi to start announcing shit.
---
Not cool dude.
---
I just didn't have enough space for rook, he's still on the same teir as doc

This.

Absolutely amazing
---
I mean. Also Plane isn‚Äôt in ranked at all
---
Fun fact: in I believe 1991 Iraq invasion of Kuwait, the missile defense system the U.S sold Israel, claimed to have intercepted all of the missiles but the reality was that it had in fact not intercepted all of them and the ones it did hit, caused both the intercepted missile and the intercepting missile both fell to the ground causing significant damage
---
Have you tried restarting your game completely, like opening a different game or using the quit option.
---
repost
---
So i guess our sub now has our own nyannyan?
---
This would be cool
---
The weapon skins would obviously be more detailed but I just didn‚Äôt put as much time in that than the other stuff.
---
Highlight of the clip for me is the nomad knife off, not mira getting 3 kills tbh.
---
If you have slow reaction; glaz, blackbeard, doc, jackal etc are probably a good choice.
---
I would buy this
---
That canister skin though
---
There are some videos on in but turn off all modes and maps except hostage on plane. Choose the difficulty you want and then the presidential bedroom or whatever it's called. The top of the matress/ bed can be shot through and it's counts as pentatration. You get like 20 on average a game

Now you see me. Now you won‚Äôt!

I figured I would post something for smoke that isn‚Äôt about a plague doctor Elite, if you want me to make one, I will
---
I've been absent from the game for a long time, so I've missed out on a lot I'm realizing. I can't seem to find it from searching, is there perhaps a good source for Lion? And Bandit had a face reveal early on. In one of the trailers there is a photo of him with some documents that match some of his information. They never exactly confirmed it, but it's clear it's him.
---
Would like to see you do better
---
If that doesn't work, try reinstalling the game.
---
I feel like its the best idea for him
---
Is the floor undet you breakable?
---
EsPorTs ReAdY
---
Damn son that dude crawling has no respect
---
What?! How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair ‚Ä¶ I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
---
Still counts since I downed he
---
Lion had a face reveal from the Road To S.I event. I could send the pic it you want me to. It's pretty dope
---
There are some korean in the video.

I hope you don't mind that.

I was more thinking like the overwatch training place.
---
There is so much more bullshit to worry about in OW. 
---
Overwatch is very scatterbrained and I was super low in that game, and you have to grind so much to rank up it‚Äôs not even worth it IMO.
---
This is not true
---
Yeah ive had that before to 0kill mvp op lmao
---
Fam I got a doge charm your still luck
---
He is blind and deaf, so he used body language to communicate with you ;)
---
They buffed the aug so its not horrible now and you can use it however i still prefer the slug shotgun.
---
Exactly this. Honestly when it came to this, they should look for a solution like cod did where it banned parties and made you go into the game chat
---
BestplayerEU on last place... lol
---
I never thought about doing nor have I seen it until now
---
Thats what happens with game throwers sadly its a common issues in this game whether its diamonds trying to get to copper to troll or people who just wanna make others mad.
---
Hit or miss
---
Shes always calling your phone xD trying to sell you shit when you just are trying not to get shot
---
I'd say still counts, that guy is lame for trying to deny your ace with electricity XD
---
Still fun

Happened to me yesterday I was buck though
---
Because people think that response always applies. When much of the time it doesn't. Just because you're bad at something doesn't mean you can't critique it. Food critics don't necessarily make good food.
---
I downvoted bc then somebody else can feel the joy of upvoting to 888
---
probably just bc they got a health buff and you can't ads while vaulting so you get less bullets to hit, making it take longer to destroy.
---
F2000 sounds more fitting for Belgium or any other country than Poland. Give him the MSBS of either standard or bullpup configuration and it would be perfect.
---
Yeah but i think the tk system has to be reworked, I dont know how but the system should make the difference between a mistake or a tk on purpose and the sanction should be harder, if you tk twice or trice in a game it's horrible for the teamkilled
---
Exactly
---
Nomad saving lives since 2019
---
Ive tried that a ton or times. Thx for the help
---
You 100% just got reported
---
I used to main dokk and virgil because of their smg 12 now it‚Äôs just an smh 12
---
&gt;You killed yourself
---
I tend to use breach charges with Ying as a follow up to using her flash charges fuze-style.
---
oh no! OH YEAH
---
Daddy had a score on his Sweetie.
---
***ALABAMA 100***
---
CSGO is just as bad.
---
There honestly not that bad at close range their still kinda op
---
Dick move dude
---
Stfu
---
I know i dont know any game without this type of people
---
On my friend's screen he didn't even the zofia
---
Yeah the smg recoil on console is probably the worst thing to ever exist, it‚Äôs way to hard to control
---
*see
---
Where is he gonna store his pee now
---
As a Smoke main on defense, I would buy this instantly.
---
She‚Äôs only rly famous online, plus I‚Äôm older than her üò© I had this face first
---
What skin is that
---
When you do it use something with high fire rate or high power, don't do it with mid tier guns.
---
Yeah she does, but my hair hides my ugly ass forehead away :-)
---
Here we can see all the salt reserves the world ever needs.
---
Skin?
---
Why is this downvoted?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna copy her lol. My tik tok is soywht if ur interested tho :-)
---
Do it
---
It‚Äôs also a thing called a #game. IQ runs around in pajamas and smoke also runs around in a fursuit. The list goes on.
---
Whhhhat
---
They said they're working on a forgive button, but it wont make a difference in the last round of the match üòê
---
Don't really like the idea of a firefighter throwing toxic gas around. Also don't really anything that smoke does relate to firefighters.
---
You fool! You fell for one of the classic blunders!
---
#heck
---
You should post this on r/colapsy for more appreciation
---
Like he did that to someone else too because a echo didnt watch his cam while shooting at someone, he is a "R word" tbh
---
üëç
---
What would you like to know friend?
---
These tend to be subjective. I'd take breaching charges over flashbangs on Hibana, for instance. If I'm using her then I'm usually going for hatches, and having them means I can create extra lines of site through the floor, I don't have to waste X-Kairos charges on an unreinforced hatch, and thanks to their updates they can put a similar but weaker debuff on a Defender in exchange for causing damage. It's all about how you like to play really.
---
:((( I want, would go great with my twitch elite
---
I put them 1 foot outside of entrances (and on frost traps because I‚Äôm an insta kill dick) ad cover the enterances up usually I get a case of the last guy who‚Äôs too fucking scared to go in the objective so he rushes in the objective at the last 2 seconds looses his sprint because of gu and instantly dies 
---
My favorite one is the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù guy who steps on a gu after he breaks down the door runs a few feet away and then sees me run out of objective and kill him before he can react
---
what
---
I've put over 750 hours into the game and been plat quite a handful of times, even though sound is important you should have an idea of your surroundings prior to it, so if you're unable to react it has more to do with you just not paying attention.
---
unless this is an r/whoosh and I'm just dumb, they are console players lol
---
If that was me the enemy would have 1 tapped me then died
---
It was reinforced
---
You should make a Monty elite. I would like to see what you come up with
---
I'm always surprised when I pull off something I deem outside of my skill level.
---
You can almost see Valkyrie sprinting across the roof
---
Those are always fun, and I like to improve my placement and strategies by watching pros. It‚Äôs a lot more helpful than you might think
---
Bring it back!!!!!!!!
---
Might just be having an off day sometimes I shred and the next I can‚Äôt get a kill to save my life
---
C4 &gt; Impacts for Roamers, Barbed Wire for Anchors &gt; Deployable Shield
---
I think they‚Äôd fix it if they knew why it happened. The problem is, it has happened to me once in over 500 hours of gameplay. It‚Äôs really hard to squash a bug that‚Äôs basically impossible to reproduce.
---
Yeah and Thankyou
---
I‚Äôve been wanting this for ages- you are the best human being to live. I... I think- I think I love you.
---
Ok, I will see what I can do
---
Coolaid karen
---
all elites so far have been worl war based, its getting repepetive and boring
---
Happened to me about a month ago, has only happened to me once in about 2 years of playing
---
Sit the fuck down t-series
---
*just joking* lmao
---
ah nice, show us that one when you're done
---
They‚Äôre a bitch to shoot on console just a mix of the odd fps drop at the wrong time and not being able to be as accurate makes them a pain
---
Get nut spammed
---
I've put about 2000 hours into this game over 2 accounts and play at plat/diamond level, yes you should but sound is arguably the most important sound to help in the decision making, so yes I still agree with OP.
---
I would help you but im also a cav main
---
r/mildlyinfuriating
---
I think I feel something for you too, Robo-Kun! (I have a dark version of the dokkaebi wallpaper, if you want it let me know)
---
Yes, there is.
---
I'm a diamond in siege and a grandmaster in Overwatch, and always wish I could look up how many other players have and hold both simultaneously.
---
My team, all friends in a Discord, agreed with the other team to a knife fight in a random casual. Was going well till I tried to knife someone and he downed me with a shotgun.
---
Saw this happen for the first time recently and I‚Äôve been playing since launch
---
And they said Lion got a nerf smh
---
I agree with you, wouldnt mind seeing an entire season dedicated to improvements and quality
---
Hate to say it, but I would recommend checking Rogue 9's [chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QF72f4Bm7PfbWeSWbl8R8uL0mOzXpG_1vOjqEjXcFGk/edit#gid=0) instead.  It has more detail and calculates TTK correctly (first shot occurs at 0ms so TTK is the time per shot times 1 less than the number of shots to kill).
---
I do like have the TTK against various armor side by side and sorting by average TTK.  Makes it a lot easier to compare guns.
---
Counting out those problems, I enjoyed siege a lot more back then
---
If only...
---
DPI doesn't matter, it's eDPI that's important. Obviously the sens you play at is important, however keyword is you. Set it to a value and literally never change it, you'll be right back to square one if you change it.
---
I don't need to, The Lord is best at everything.
---
Why did the beginning sound like a mini tennis match when something intense happens
---
I mostly enjoyed between Black Ice and Velvet shell, but my favourite was Red Crow.
---
Ubi better not mess up the Smoke Elite
---
Nice username
---
I feel like they both need more cosmetics in general, but especially Zofia. I hope that when/if they get Elite skins that Ubi releases both of them simultaneously
---
wow
---
Do I have time to use the bathroom?
---
Lol
---
I will fill your sinuses with urine

For Gary‚Äôs mod

Because you can blow a wall right after your fuze charges finish detonating, and rush the defenders while they're still reorienting and confused.
---
Either Vigil went off the deep end or, judging by the massacre on the killfeed, everyone is starting to lose their minds and this is a sad side effect.

Almost as nice as the time I got a fuze ace on the same site because I was ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù. It was in ranked too

quickest legit kill ever?

it was an attempt to lower pick rate. makes no sense otherwise

I agree

He does mention that that's also a good choice in the video. This picture is just what he personally prefers to run.
---
Bet
---
Good.
---
It‚Äôs pulse‚Äô camera

i think suppressors are already pretty valuable. they lower reaction time by a lot
---
No watch it it didn‚Äôt. Watch the bottom right
---
what did you get from it
---
My pp itching
---
He's releasing part two (which will cover the defender gadgets) later. Can't remember if he said anything about when that'll be in the video.
---
I deleted his existence
---
No one can stop our lord and savior.
---
So if he has the Acog in one hand... and his phone in his other hand... then how?...
---
Ela/Cav for roaming, Maestro/Mira for anchor
---
Those are operators that have the gadget available to them, but he chooses to run the other choice on them instead.
---
Huh. He has claymore and breaching charges dude
---
yes
---
Sbeve
---
The more games you play the less elo you get per game
---
You didn't create this, credit the OP.
---
because its a game and they nerfed the mp5 to lower the rook and doc spawnpeeks
---
When you try your best but you don't succeed
---
Mp5 was nerfed, before damage was equal or almost equal if I remember right.
---
A team that plays tactical in a 4v1 instead of rushing in like headless chickens? What is this, bronze? /s

You completely O F F E D him

I thinks it been in the game a while. It might've changed rarity though
---
I am too, extraordinarily humble.
---
You bought and played the Xbox version. Now you‚Äôre in the PC version. Nothing you‚Äôve done in the Xbox applies here. You still got your progress over there though. 
---
Heck be grateful that you even can change server at will on PC.
---
Blizzard won‚Äôt even sync your progress when shifting between servers.  
---
‚ÄúHmmm.... Used 10k USD on NA hearthstone on cards? Well guess you‚Äôll need to start all over again on European servers if you want to play with some new friends.‚Äù.

I wish I had started playing siege at release, seems like the game was a lot more enjoyable then

For this year yes. Not the ones from the last seasons.

Damn that makes my idea of the smoke elite being a plague doctor look shameful

operation health is a 3 month period of time dedicate-
---
I dont Think ive ever used a flashbang outside of situations
---
Feels bad. That should count as a kill though
---
Full squad ranked my friend
---
They didnt like my charm
---
How's that work?
---
Well seeing as they make you creat an account with them that tracks progress, you would think it would transfer skins stats and so on. Smite, Fortnite, and many others do that. I'm just a sad boy right now
---
This is so fucking STUPID that this shit happens. They're all 40 year old virgins I swear
---

Yes but apart from that you get the the other 6 operators coming out later this year. Plus a bonus to renown. Some skins too.

Breaching charges are highly underrated. They're great for vertical plays and a good kaid counter.
---
This can happen with normal breaching charges where you only shave off one layer of soft wall.
---
This is litterally just that exact fortnite skin
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd get 6 more too, thanks!
---
Also needs to take color blindness into effect
---
May I add that my ping isn‚Äôt consistent so when it jumps I rubberband like crazy
---
Flashbang on Maverick and not claymore mine? Yeah right....because I would love to get flanked by a J√§gger or Caveira while melting the reinforce walls.

I read the title and still thought this was terrorist hunt it looked so spot on

Back at the end of year 2 the mp5 (GIGN), mp5k (SAS) and the mp5sd (SAT) all did 30 damage, with the mp5 and mp5k allowing you put put suppressors on them which reduced their damage to 26. The mp5sd had the highest drop-off so it only did 18 damage at 28m+.
---
Since then the mp5 was nerfed to reduce spawnpeeking and make the p90 more viable. Now the mp5 only does only 18 damage at 28m+ as well.
---
This leaves the mp5k where the mp5 was but without an acog.
---
The mp5sd also cannot have any barrel attachments so it generally has more recoil than the others so making it also do less damage would just be disrespectful.
---
This is accurate

I only play on PC and I think I've only had everyone stick true to their word once. Most of the time people just spray the others down for easy kills.

I actually use Smokes on Fuze it give you cover to place the charges

Just walk up to it, then press the activate button once. Dont even have to hold activation down.

It doesn‚Äôt count as a death, I get this a lot in ranked when I play cav as people just leave and rejoin as to not be interrogated.

It was a lot more one dimensional, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I do now.  The "cheese strats" consisted of putting deployable shields down with bandit batteries and tap-shooting with the shield operators.  In terms of balance I'm sure it was way worse but the simplicity of it at the time was way more fun for me
---
I swear this is the buggiest season we've ever had
---
Overwatch debatably require more ‚Äúskill‚Äù but with it stupid broken Match making system,
---
Siege is just a much better game.
---
Legit why is class shooter that introduced mechanic as tank/healer/dps; don‚Äôt have a role que???
---
Every game I been into has been 1 off rank 3 dps-tard and 2 Healer with no one who play main tank which btw is also the most important role.
---
The que system is stupid and unbalance cuz the team who have a 300+ hours Rein is gonna have an easier game and a team which doesn‚Äôt.
---
So want to climb on OW?
---
Play Rein til GM ez.

Wait for the new season and don‚Äôt bomb your rank

To beat the toxicity you must become the toxicity. Find a squad that‚Äôs as toxic as you want to be then boom before you know it you‚Äôre a diamond doing run outs in casual. Then and only then, will you truly become one with the cancer.

She definitely does not. Frost is OP as is
---
It got nerfed, but only in ammo capacity
---
Better version of Triangle Caveria

My only issue with the game right now is leavers and peekers. I play the game casually so I always get shat on when complaining about this but nothing kills my enjoyment faster then these 2 running out to be killed by a defender with an ACOG peeking. Or losing a round and a teammate leaving. Sometimes that position doesn't get filled and you end up losing a match that you could've won if you had all 5 players. It's really infuriating.

What is this ‚Äúgame‚Äù called?
---
Not even a pulse main but a mobile wallpaper in such good resolution is a gem, thank you so much.
---
I am calling the cops
---
I can understand flashes over breaching chargers, but flashes over claymore?
---
Oh no üò±üò®üò∞
---
Get that all the time, the game works but working out the mean MMR of every team and tries to create the closest average it can. 
---
This could in theory least to a couple of coppers and a couple of diamonds on one team and a bunch of silvers and bronzes on the other
---
Actually 3 years 2 months or some stuff.
---
I miss flashbang fuze
---
the tactical side has increased, specially due to all the counterplay being found.
---
This is the thing about tactics on ANY game. You can only start to think about them when you're mechanically good enough to challenge the other player.
---
I can't really say anything else honestly. Gamesense is still ridiculously overpowered in this game.
---
Lookup mountain on google translate
---
True but remember ships are fictional and nothing but more fantasy. It won't actually happen
---
Agreed, been playing Hibana for about 100-150ish hours now and I always roll breaching charges with her just in case we don't have a soft breacher.
---
Oh yeah, but it's so unreliable, y'know? You pretty much gotta be in DDT just to use it for it's normal purpose, I already miss enough lmao
---
I remember thinking about an operator who used some sort of acid or even just a saw to destroy the metal, but idk how realistically feasible that'd be
---
Or just change Maverick to only break the metal so then you can make punch holes in the wall or help a fuze or even a breach charge
---
F

:((
---
Don‚Äôt get raped
---
what microbugs
---
honestly asking. Apart from the bullshit tk system (I'm incredibly salty about it right now) I haven't really had any bugs, big or small, or at least that I've noticed.
---
Sound was fucked a few patches ago though, I'll give you that.

R/whooosh

I‚Äôm sorry for me wrong calculations
