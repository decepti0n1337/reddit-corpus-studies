Yeah it still works. But I don't think it will start a round until all 5 slots are filled.

---
Bruh
---
Please uninstall reddit sir
---
Oh, look at the feed
---
Nice
---
yeah, that would be really interesting. it would also be cool to see 5 recruits wielding alibi and maestros shotgun, or even maetro‚Äôs lmg
---
Oof so he‚Äôs not getting a shot gun and if he does get aug mp5k kinda useless that‚Äôs not very good balancing
---
Sledge?
---
IMO it wouldnt be that bad. Maybe at first thered be some toxicity like that but people stick with siege for the operator interaction. If you just want fast gunplay theres other games that are better for that. Allowing recruit to be a viable option would be really cool long term though. 
---

---
Say you have a strat that only needs 4 gadgets to work. Set your 5th to recruit and now you're tactically choosing to bring, say, barbs and a C4 instead of a proper gadget. I think that added layer of gameplay would at the very least not be harmful.
---
This says I can say that 
---
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
---
big facts but it would still be cool to see his face
---
His guns are fine lol. The issue IS the ability. Point blank period.
---
I. Can‚Äôt. Wait. For. The. Weapon. Post. On. This. Subreddit.
---
Sry liberal but im british and here that may count as hate speach
---
My friend got all Black Ices in like a year. I'm playing since Velvet Shell and got like 3 of them.
---
i would definitely buy that if its the elite
---
Yeah I mentioned that in my next comment. But with sledge your weapon isn‚Äôt useable for second or so after you breach the wall. 
---
I‚Äôm imagining this new op being able to full sprint through the wall, hardly slowing down. With sledge you have to crouch if you want to get through a wall without jumping.
---
they dont
---
Nice wall bang but those are some dumb plats you‚Äôre playin against lmao. GJ amigo
---
No, I think it‚Äôs unbelievable.
---
If you want room names, just go around in a custom game and look at the compass, but remember that simple descriptions of the rooms are probably better, like most people know what I mean or have an idea of what I mean  when I say ‚Äúcav in green room‚Äù on new canal. Some times just a short discription os better than the actual room name.
---
"IQ's AUG (No ACOG tho)"
---
... so maybe it's Kaid's AUG and they couldn't tell? They said they can't do different attachments for different operators on the same gun. Can they now??? Tachanka ACOG incoming?
---
Or a proper smoke face reveal. His elite was as close as they'll ever get IMO.
---
this is how he was meant to be played from conception.
---
his weapons are great
---
But then there wouldn‚Äôt get said benefits - you haven‚Äôt read what‚Äôs cool about giant teams like Bama is that when you can‚Äôt fight, can‚Äôt put that voodoo on us!
---
Right. If the ability was the issue then he wouldn't be the only 3 armor without a way too see far.
---
No worries. There can't be "hate speech" when I have freedom of speech. That's just how it goes. And I'm not liberal
---
No problem. The 1050ti will run it just fine, we have another pc with a 1030 and it can run siege so you shouldn‚Äôt have any issues.
---
That is true
---
Agreed.
---
And here I thought we were going to get a cool oil rig map...
---
Idk kinda. It got better but I still didn‚Äôt like it
---
Not that much of an XXL Barba, more of a S/M one
---
If you're referring to the turtleneck shirt Buck wears underneath then i had to leave that out for health reasons, my neck is the only vent for heat in the whole costume; I'd overheat if i didn't.
---
The o my time I touch her is to blow open the two soft walls in the main lobby on bank so I can look into the hallways
---
No clue I don‚Äôt really look at amd that much, I probably should
---
Thanks for posting a blurry repost
---
Priceless
---
Really? I think I'm 104 with about 200 hours? There cant be a 900 hour gap between our levels surely?
---
Oh okay, and yes I didn‚Äôt know this was posted many time before
---
Yeah they are very hard to come by, took me a month to find a seller. I got mine from Aliexpress.
---
Dude, it was posted here more than a hundred time, we all saw it and the event ended.
---
*Football
---
im sorry
---
I thought the reason to not do that was to discourage everyone from picking recruit with R4 or 416 and then just go guns blazing instead of choosing ops with gadgets and work as a team.
---
yes I know you can but you can buy cosmetics , if you gave away more free packs then that would mean buying less cosmetics and less money so
---
Caveira‚Äôs elite skin
---
Body parts always clipped it just they made them invisible when they clipped after some patch a long ass time ago. Something definitely changed and it's back
---
Where do you find that screen?
---
I dislike spawnpeekers, but credit where credit is due, some are pretty damn good at it.
---
Overwatch gives you a loot box every level, so how about every level? üëÄ
---
Black eye in the black guys eye
---
I love this template sooo much
---
It‚Äôs because your power level is too high
---
Other than starter edition don't new players get all base ops immediately now?  And starter edition ops cost 12500.
---
It should be like overwatch
---
Fine by me but for god sake, close the freakin glass visor of the helmet!
---
Kinky
---
Agreed, kinda gets annoying when defenders become attackers
---
YEaH sAMe
---
So I saw the new video where ubi explains all the ops and apparently the original blitz used to be able to aim down sights and hold his shield up, he could sprint through soft walls, and he would spawn alongside defense during the prep phase
---
Nah, the range to do a Garra kill it's very little, and she takes a bit of time to pass from Garra to a weapon, so it wouldn't be so op
---
Simple answer get em both
---
One for attack
---
One for defense
---
this just reeks of entitlement
---
Yeah. I give them credit cus I can‚Äôt spawnpeek for anything
---
Golden eye theme starts playing
---
Yeah, totally agree, the ops break the barricade when they come in, can't see why Amaru should behave differently.
---
Nice good to know. Thank you!
---
Actually when the game launched up to about season 3 fbi shield was 2 armor.
---
I actually often play at 2 different places and the problem persists in both. Its also just this game, no other game I have this problem in
---
 r/SuicideWatch
---
What do those numbers mean
---
I have 52 days according to Xbox but basically like half of it is waiting for games, customizing operators, menus, matchmaking being a bitch or I left to go get food, etc. I have only 600h of actual gameplay if I check Ubisoft official site
---
I would credit them if I wasn‚Äôt mad about me not playing the round
---
Hover over ranked and press right joystick
---
[deleted]
---
Is this an old clip? I thought Plane was taken out of the map rotation...
---
The stay is literally laying down and staying inside rooms. Playing like that sucks
---
Black eye on the black guy
---
What's the equivalent of right joystick on PC?
---
Feck, got me
---
Only gold 3
---
Thanks
---
This is Ubisoft my dude. You almost certainly ain't getting something like that for free lol.
---
" Aight imma head out "
---
Steam hours?
---
He failed NNN
---
How do you watch it? It says premieres in 6 hours?
---
All of the above. BikiniBodhi literally made this a meme because he wanted it to be an op
---
Spoiler please.
---
Sure , if you want to trickshot you're teammates
---
You were playing in the third round when it happened.
---
[Here is the twitter link](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1193347542844682240) who knows how long it'll be up
---
The Doc giveth, and the Doc taketh away.
---
A face reveal is okay but never should mute get a voice reveal.
---
It's probably permanent. My guess is that Ubi wants to stop people from sharing their Pro League bundles. Hence why Ubi has been slowly getting rid of downloadable content in general and is going more twords in-game stuff.
---
It's on Instagram too
---
I have the Flesh skin for the Scorpion, absolutely love it!
---
AMAZING !
---
Ubi should do this. They gain nothing financially from alpha packs and if someone got a good cosmetic for an OP the don't have they might be tempted to spend r6 to buy said OP.
---
In my opinion only Smoke should not be revealed, so you'd be questioning why does the use the same gas as the villains if he is in R6.

They are 20% off...
---
Yes they could have reacted but within the 2 seconds, he already reached the spawn site and dropped three attackers. The only way they could have reacted to this runout is knowing that it was going to happen, which they clearly didn‚Äôt. This is still toxic because you‚Äôre already preventing these players from playing for the rest of the match.
---
i had the diamond skin on...
---
His character spawned before the prep phase ended it‚Äôs happened to me before.
---
dont insult your own video and expect not to have it called shit.
---
it's shit.
---
I heard that there may be a new secondary gadget, like a alarm system of some kind?
---
I was put into the operator‚Äôs view point during the prep phase as an attacker
---
Except Games are better than soccer
---
As a fellow maestro main myself, im sad to say this location is only available to 3 speeds. But you can get an eye in the upper corner of garage by thr orange containers
---
Well they all died sooooooo not your fault
---
Ubi literally said it was not possible bro
---
And?
---
They're def early but the reveal is in 5 hours. Since its Sunday in Japan
---
Roger that. Makes sense
---
Well yes but actually no. 
---
There is a rumor that the Y5S1 defender will have a medic drone, but this is a shitpost to some degree.
---
Is Stadium supposed to be a tdm warm up thing then? Or am I reading it wrong
---
With is that?
---
I mean there's incomniacs
---
Holo on shotguns and reflex on everything else
---
Well that pisses me off. I liked having a consistent price for those sets. Now with the R6 I can't just spend the $16 for the sets and I'll always have some wasted currency.
---
That's so fucking stupid.
---
I'm not op. I think he just grabbed the thumbnail
---
Do you know how many times ive had to pop a doc or a rook in the head 5 seconds into the match in ranked? The attacker is putting themselves at risk, and its just a part of the game newer players have to adapt to, valid strategies arent ‚Äútoxic‚Äù because they‚Äôre valid, now if you want to call Ubi a shit developer who doesn‚Äôt understand S&amp;D style shooters, sure, you‚Äôre entitled to do that, but you cant call OP toxic for using something thats been part of the meta of the game for a long time and the other team failing to react
---
Ah I see!. That's happened to me in the past actually.
---
What about places in the US
---
When I say can't be fixed, I mean they won't spend time fixing it. It would take a lot of dev time to invest into it. If enough people complain, it can be done. It's just tricky afaik.
---
Its like the films where the bad guys go at the main dude on at a time
---
Not really. It‚Äôs 4pm JST, which is 2am EST. 6 hours from now.
---
And you should get an event pack too.
---
Ahhhh, I see. Thank you.
---
makeshift elevator gadget that you grab onto to go to the upper floor.
---
We all know where this is going
---
On the guns that have big recoil holo but on any other gun reflex
---
Oh damn
---
how the hell would ubi make a trillion bucks
---
Are you stupid or disabled? He clearly didn't abandon the match which was the whole point of this post. He just switched windows using key combination alt + tab.
---
The game is working today. I think the problem may have been due to the storm we had in India.
---
\[insert *Finding Nemo* seagull "Mine"\]
---
I'm just shy of 600hrs, got the game June 2017, and I only play THunt. Also cut WAY back after they nerfed Solo Renown back in Nov 2017. I was just shy of 300hrs then.

Is not getting a joke worth a downvote? (It doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs just karma)

People saying this is toxic also dont look for spawn peeks. Everytime I spawn here I literally pre fire that no matter the information.

Isn't that Tower? Or does Skyscraper have one too?
---
u/profanitycounter ShadowX_3000

---
I guess, but it shouldn't be like that. That's just making an excuse for an objectively predatory system.
---
They encourage this type of play in the patch notes.
---
Oof. (You guessed it, I was mistaken) same concept for a map though.
---
Now downvotes from me, just letting you know you have been r/wooosh 'd
---
You‚Äôre just mad cause we‚Äôre so good at being a better Glaz

From this video: https://youtu.be/-wSLcrxIFJA

As you can see from top rigth kill log, theres a scope for BOSG finally!
---
I‚Äôm not blaming you, it‚Äôs usually lurkers that do this.
---
It was round 0, the voice chat was silent and I was really scared.  Suddenly Ela appeared on scream and her face was covered in HYPER REALISTIC BLOOD.  I screamed so loud my neighbors called the cops and my mom grounded me from the xbox.  And the worst part was that I WAS DEAD THE WHOLE TIME AND YOU WILL BE DEAD SOON TOO!
---
what
---
Man he is the true sniper
---
Ikr, when people try to downplay other‚Äôs hours played with their 3-digit looking ass.
---
No bro...
---
It‚Äôs the ONLY LOADOUT. If you run anything else besides 5 Ashs with 5 G36Cs and 5 red dots you‚Äôre literally throwing /s
---
Where are you getting the idea that he's shy from? His psych report reads like this "It may not be immediately clear why Specialist Mark Chandar's codename is Mute. While he dislikes small talk, he isn't particularly reserved and in fact can be brash - a trait that is off-putting to some."  
---
  
---
He even pokes fun at Vigil for being shy.
---
These look good, but I would rather let Recruit use attachments. He wouldn‚Äôt be competitively viable, hell no, but he‚Äôd be better. For example, I don‚Äôt like Ash or her playstyle, but I like her R4-C, if Recruit could use attachments, I can run the R4-C and not play Ash. I‚Äôd also like to see a card for him on the operator tab of the main menu, basically make him a real op. I‚Äôd easily pay $100 to get some skins for Recruit.
---
Steam users: pathetic
---
He found out he getting an elite
---
Duplicates shouldn't be a thing
---
The LAN build of Siege has some skins unlocked early.
---
And I bet next seasons attacker will make Glaz fall off the chart completely.
---
26% of you guys have downvoted this video, could anyone explain why you don't like it? I'm trying to improve so advice would help me out a lot. Thanks in advance
---
Ah, I see now youre saying in case OP has the game on xbox or ps4 he can play TTS there. My bad I thought you were saying he could play it on PC without owning.
---
Nice progress!
---
Aren‚Äôt they trying to push out recruit? Doesn‚Äôt the normal game give you all Y1 ops and on top of they you can‚Äôt pick them in ranked anymore.
---
We came to an understanding eventually üôè
---
Im guilty ofreaching 3k+
---
Yeah same for me too

We are

They are playable in ranked but u have to have a acc witch is new lvl 30 and u cant buy no ops - search for a ranked game your recruit
---
with his new fire rate I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see that number change
---
he‚Äôs stupid strong right now regardless of what the data shows because it was taken before his buff
---
Just a heads up the guys we kicked in the beginning was using a mouse and keyboard and it was very obvious
---
Some people reported just fine though, YMMV.
---
Personally I can't afford both, I'm too poor as is and that's why I lust over other hardware and become a nerd. Feelsbad
---
It doesn't matter
---
So you are basically trolling at that point.
---
Wht do i mean trolling?
---
THESE ARE SO GOOD, WTF?  
---
Did you make these?
---
He‚Äôs a pedophile
---
when you nut already but she keep sucking
---
Every btw, but cool idea.

Did they fire their artist or something? That's not the usual art style for the characters
---
GRAB MY HAND, I NEED YOU ALIVE
---
Like, OG version of the Assassins Creed engine.
---
Aggressively heal the enemy when they're shooting each other in the prep phase
---
Haha I found this funny because on PC (or for Steam at least) the time played is given in hours and I've got a friend with lots of hours. We always checked to see how many days he has played from his hours, but now you are checking how many hours you've played from your days
---
yeah be he should‚Äôve peeked the doorway and 90 at head level and then moved down when he peeked stairs
---
Forcing the game to give you a pick that the devs took out and putting your team at a disadvantage every round.
---
Just asking but has this happened to anyone else here
---
that guy has 1660ti and ryzen 5 2600, I'm pretty sure his resolution is 1920 or higher
---
Yeah, and in ow you are guaranteed a legendary every 20 loot boxes at least
---
Yea by playing like that u dont get to choose wht gun u use the game gives u wht it wants
---
What time zone are you in? Just go on google and put in 16:15 jst to your time.
---
The drum looks to big and the barrel doesn‚Äôt look right, that‚Äôs just my take
---
Man that‚Äôs good!
---
Real Question: who cares about cosmetics
---
Who's in the final???
---
It is the time zone is different.. lol
---
I approve
---
It looks great. Good job :)
---
for the love of ubi, don't spawnpeek haha
---
but looks great!
---
You don‚Äôt get to pick anything to go on the gun and you don‚Äôt have an ability to help the team and on defense you only get one reinforcement.
---
I just want some blacked out outfits so I can hide better. Gotta get those cheeky ninja defuses
---
Looks like [Weber](https://i.imgur.com/JypyKOB.png), the sniper from Rainbow Six LockDown who got kidnapped by mercenary, now respawning in R6 Siege as a sniper girl :3
---
This is wrong there was a teaser on their gadgets and they are nothing like these
---
But when outbreak was on he had 2 reinforcements and sights etc
---
I know it's a glitch but I really want the background of the selection screen like this
---
Nah, I think they've been around for a couple years. Original artist is on steam and Deviantart. I really like his design of J√§ger in the cap though. [There's also one with a beret that looks really clean.](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/ffeebbaa-44dc-4bf6-9172-48ff9dba2dd2/dc53yps-46ff9ed5-9d01-4fb7-b4c8-3daa68d22e69.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2ZmZWViYmFhLTQ0ZGMtNGJmNi05MTcyLTQ4ZmY5ZGJhMmRkMlwvZGM1M3lwcy00NmZmOWVkNS05ZDAxLTRmYjctYjRjOC0zZGFhNjhkMjJlNjkucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.FmJTR9qFLDFfsvM9c-Xns0Rk0Pz2Nlnajc6RXqgCRDg) Would be kinda funny if he got a headgear with a cap too considering he's seen as Ash on defence to most.
---
I would like to see another doc
---
What?
---
That‚Äôs the thing! I‚Äôm silver at the moment but only ever made it to plat- insane to see someone like this
---
I think I just failed NNN
---
Eye ball on the painted wall.
---
Is buy a UN Peacekeeper elite soon for the Recruit.
---
Nope, they never go on sale.
---
Exactly what a recruit should be. Newbies makin due with what they got, low budget and alot of tenacity.
---
hmm, was involved with Thatcher
---
Never. It doesn't happen
---
That's why I hate joining matches already in session. The game decides to take years to load while everyone is getting mad waiting for the stupid server to acknowledge I'm in the game.
---
These two teams are going at it hard if you‚Äôre watching.
---
That's shit, might as well team kill with impunity
---
She has potential to be better in ranked, pro-league, etc.
---
Time to hunt down #1
---
Yeah lmao I‚Äôve got my hopes up for rec go NA
---
The future looks great
---
I do suppose if your playing rank all the time you make 150 quickly. I'm for sure a casual gold
---
Yes I know but I couldn't seem to find the word that fits the situation...
---
I bought the game earned everything else üëçüèΩ
---
That is really gross
---
No one tests new strategies in casual? I like to play cas and go big brain mode and learn new ways to play every site.
---
Not gonna lie kinda liking DZ
---
it seems like once every 50-100 hours I pull a flick off like this and wonder what the fuck am i truly capable of? then go back to being a regular scrub
---
An hour from now.
---
$0 but I am quite willing to put an easy $100 into it just to support a quality title
---
Oh yeah a bolt action sniper never before seen is totally recycled. Have you been living under a rock?

I feel like n√∏kk could be gorgeous.

[Me IRL right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA1mbZ_MMh8)

I' had a game start 2 vs 4 in ranked.

We have unranked for that. It's a MUCH more sophisticated mode for testing ranked strats.
---
"she"?
---
Ouch

Aye that‚Äôs about the same for me
---
What? Your aim?

So my order on what to buy with renown each season goes

1. Best operators that I‚Äôm missing
---
2. Favorite Seasonal skin(s)
---
3. Remaining ops that are lower importance
---
4. Other seasonal skin(s)
---
5. Remaining weapon skins/universal skins
---
6. Seasonal Outfits
---

You guys are arguing about the all the wrong shit. Why are you able to shoot into the enemy spawn is three seconds? It‚Äôs such a huge flaw in the game. Don‚Äôt call someone toxic for finding a way to win. People will always abuse exploits so DONT MAKE THEM POSSIBLE

This is epic.

The reveal is happening right now,its on CoreRosses youtube channel

Need to watch Ubisoft twitch channel?

Thanks!!!

That looks a bit like a P226 but it‚Äôs probably the P229 üòû

I know I think I forgot to press E, I regret doing that now because this post somehow blown up, I didn‚Äôt expect it to.
---
Holy crap instant down on body shot
---
too bad other operators doesnt look like they belong to team rainbow
---
Tommarow
---
They should rename his shotgun to the Saiga tbh
---
So what made him better in your brief experience? Quicker snaps, deadlier aim? Did it appear he was with his squad? It‚Äôs casual so you can‚Äôt really see their communication or teamwork.

Honestly I‚Äôm really excited with this season

Kali seems crazy good
---
AWP
---
Oh fuck awp in game.

finally we can say yes
---
I know who my squad insta banning!!! Kali gonna be OP

Way too OP.

That's the way it should be

It looks like Kali gets 3 or 4 of those completely OP explosives?! That's...way too many for how stupidly effective they look.
---
Kali's OP as fuck lmao what the fuck.
---
Jager cloney boi
---
looked like Mutes MP5k and the GSG9 p12 pistol
---
Mute‚Äôs Smg and IQ‚Äôs AUG (with no ACOG). (Or so I heard)
---
bruh
---
[Nice spelling](https://i.imgur.com/HM9xkPS.png)
---
I feel like Wamai‚Äôs gadget is good, but the lesion effects turns it off a bit as he has to stay alive for his utility. If the AUG has an ACOG on defence I feel he will be very decent. 
---
New attacker is an insta pick for the majority of lineups as they are essentially a hard to counter thatcher that worlds from a distance with a decent gun. 
---
IMO nothing too OP, but both has the potential to be good depending on the how the META shakes out
---
Wamai right now seems pretty garbage. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong.
---
Did you see that ADS time though, fighting close range is going to be super hard for her.
---
I know there's gunna be lots of R.I.P. Thatcher and R.I.P. J√§ger. How y'all like this.
---
Shes already broken.
---
"Thrown" room looks great.
---
At least they gave the lord his throne. All hail ya habla in the throne room!!
---
**Hello Stxph-, your submission has been removed as new submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
Yeah she needs like 2 max. And they need to be on a recharge similar to lesion. I never thought I‚Äôd see a more annoying version of maverick.
---
coconut brah we see you
---
Oh dang you right, warden is a 2 speed.
---
And, if you equip a suppressor, he becomes more of a silent hunter. Always fun.
---
Ubisoft now steals artwork ideas from Hitman?
---
416 on attack HELL YEAH!
---
And this... is to go... EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!
---
Ouch.
---
Ah. I‚Äôm just not used to seeing cav without her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the grim reaper‚Äù face paint.
---
But old Glaz had One Shot Kill only on 5 meter range IIRC, because damage drop-off. 6 meters and more - two shot kill.
---
Yeah i noticed the same thing?
---
They all disappeared
---
Its stupid. They should at least buff glaz so he's not completely useless
---
Nose isn't big enough, 2/10 üò§
---
It's the percent that matters.
---
Yeah. Versus fucking monsters / aliens! 
---
Rainbow 6 was a reality-based counter-terrorist game. And the original Outbreak event was terrible because Siege‚Äôs gun mechanics don‚Äôt suit a Doom style game.
---
Oh i know. Please dont take that as hostility towards you. Are you a pro player? lol. But really I remember playing rainbow for the first time as a teen. The tactics I learned I carry with me to this day. Some of these kids don't know what they're missing until it's shown to them. Siege can be played a different way. And it should for the kids who will benefit from it. Nothing wrong with two or three different play styles in the same game. Pros can have their game mode, run and gunners on another. And maybe a realism mode for those who want it. Better than forcing them to all be unhappy together.
---
Thank you!
---
Any other guns from Call of Duty that you would like to add?
---
This is so true
---
Same I‚Äôve been looking and not seeing any. I know Varsity had a video and now it‚Äôs not showing.
---
Yes, it's like a soft, redirected counter. It doesn't land where you want, but if wamai places it inside a very small site like oregon small dorms, he's screwed if tank chick deploys her Trax.
---
Because he's the meme on twitter right now
---
I got lost in watching the gameplay I should've but other than that it looks really hard to play Kali in close quarters (obviously it's a 5x and 12x) I don't have a problem with the one shot down, my problem with Kali is the timer for her lance is too short
---
No need to be sarcastic with me. Thatcher has no counters, but you can bandit trick him, so yes, not a gadget to avoid losing your devices on the other side of a wall - BUT - a skilled bandit will beat him. You can't beat a kill hole. Do you understand that? Her ADS time has nothing to do with anything, lol...
---
She just breaches your wall, from a distance, without the need to expose herself (like Maverick), and also destroys everything on the other side of the wall.
---
I feel like, if you didn't realized all of that already, there's no point in discussing anything with you. You just wont see it
---
Its affecting almost everyone I know from SEAs server too. I used a vpn to switch to WEU and it worked fine
---
I feel like  you are a bit biased regarding glaz also no need to be rude
---
Just look at Kalis forearms. They‚Äôre beefy. Absolute UNIT of an operator. I guess she‚Äôll be carrying her teams around a lot with her gadget.
---
It is
---
IDK, good question.
---
But it's probably not going to make a difference considering that it's more of a breaching tool.
---
The game is already skewed heavily towards defence. Removing breach denial won't suddenly make the game skew the other way.
---
Not to mention, if you are a good at Bandit tricking and Kaid tricking, you can still make it work.
---
Yea sure thing buddy, totally for a CGI short
---
Dam it ... Guess I failed as an aspiring cosplayer smh
---
Zophia was the worst offender. People got sooooooo pissed at her ability that self revives. Then she comes out and her ability is almost useless.
---
But that point of cloak is excesive, a drone in a normal ceiling or doorframe is already very noticeable.
---
So you did dislike it cuase you diliked my post you ugly
---
Huh it‚Äôs almost like operators are situational and you can‚Äôt just use them for every map/scenario... some people say the dumbest shit on this sub sometimes.
---
Another reason in a list of 69000 rasons for why chalet (and skyscraper) should be booted into rework zone.
---
I knew something was off !
---
Sorry. got carried away. Best wishes.
---
Haha. You‚Äôre not enough to sustain the game. You and Ubi need the other 95%.
---
Cav elite most likely Y5 and wamai gets them overtime just like lesion
---
people like you ruin the fun of video games.
---
that post on r/all shitting on esports was right. they are ruining things for others. 
---
enjoy your sweaty strat games.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs below 9000‚Äù sadly someone already beat me to it
---
I doubt it has an ACOG as they have said in the past only 1 speed defenders will get acogs. We will see.
---
What we have to realise is that this game is defender favoured so a strong attacker isn‚Äôt the worst thing to have. Saying this, Kaid should now greater counter her lances with his AOE increase, and the fact he can place these further away. 
---
This is a nice counter to bandit, who overshadows Kaid, so this is a nice pseudo-buff to Kaid. 
---
The sniper seems a little crazy, and will be so hard to balance. If it becomes too strong, I‚Äôd potentially try these ‚Äî&gt;
---
- Drop ammo Count to 3 in a magazine
---
- lengthen the ADS time more
---
- Lengthen swap times
---
F
---
I just reached 26 from 24 and didn't receive a alpha pack. So your theory is wrong.
---
soemone just DM the resetera leaker with it
---
He got ROCKED
---
Where‚Äôs the leaked battle pass?
---
Uh did you miss Goyo?
---
Only this one by Sasslyn is still up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjH07-vg_8Q
---
So both a passive and active gadget
---
Why not, its not most people who runout Anyways
---
Fun fact- Kali is the Hindu goddess of death.
---
She has a CZ-75 for cqc apparently. So, no harder then dokki I guess? (not a dokki main)
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one
---
Like what? We are Keen on seeing what mockery you can pull out of your rainbow coloured magic hat.
---
I have been looking for a new profile pic all day, THANK YOU
---
Or is it?
---
you have about 2 hours of the stream left
---
because glaz has strongest DMR in the game and kali has bolt action sniper. Both are different boomer.
---
Let just not spin around and call the operators op and try to change them already when the community has 0 playtime with them. Every season the operators are called op and whatnot, play them first, test them, give feedback and after the tweaks ubisoft always does after switching from tts to live servers you can complain.
---
it doesnt changes operator icon lmao
---
Does she not destroy kaids claws? Theres a chance i missed that in the reveal.
---
Ah, yes. Hearing Ash in front of me right before she misses a knife and panic sprays me to death from behind.
---
yes.
---
You sure you ain't high, brother?
---
Mag nets don‚Äôt affect drones
---
Yes one shot to body 
---
No it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôll make them ‚Äúflinch‚Äù but they don‚Äôt take damage. If right on it maybe like 1-5 HP Max
---
You made this brilliance?
---
It‚Äôs the new defender
---
Maybe it is not or it is who nose
---
if his gadget doesnt have a sound, it can be deployed outside and actually damage attackers. Let the TTS release the operation atleast dude
---
I don‚Äôt have vigil, valk, echo, kaid, ela, lesion, goyo, warden, mozzie, mira, alibi and clash.
---
That's like saying Goyo is harmful to their teams without proper coordination or placement.
---
Jah of course
---
I don't think you read his post either. He's talking about "trickle down balance", if it is balanced at the highest levels of play(such as for pro league) it will be balanced at the lower levels. If it isn't balanced this way then it will leave room to be abused and broken at high levels. An example of this is Lion. Sure, at the lower levels he was a fine operator, there is no coordination and nobody really capitalized when his gadget was used. But in high level play where people actually know how to coordinate and utilize the couple seconds that enemies were forced to stand still he was a complete nightmare.
---
I haven't played him much. I had forgotten the TCSG. I assume because it is a full on ar as opposed to a shotgun they won't give him an ACOG.
---
They said they won‚Äôt add new weapons because ubisoft can‚Äôt legally use more guns in their game. Or so i read.
---
Yup
---
duplicate legendaries should be illegal lmfao
---
wat is ddosing when done "corectly"
---
I don't understand what esports has to do with anything. You'll be trying to avoid a hard breach on a wall that exposes your site to the exterior of a map in casual and you WON'T BE ABLE TO-DO-SO. You won't. They will destroy your batteries without any way to counter them, without risk, without skill, just with a click of their mouse from the distance. And that's not the problem, the problem is that it then leaves a kill hole that will expose you if you try to electrify the wall for whatever comes next. It's not esports related, it's game balance.   
---
You'll be the first to come to the sub to complain when she is released and your "non sweaty ass" gets destroyed without counterplay whatsoever. It won't be fun for you
---
omg his health is over 9000
---
She has CZ75 dude, what else do you need anymore for a support operator
---
Bandit tricking has so many counters at this point that it is nearly impossible to actually succeed at at it against any decent team. I‚Äôm not sure what rank you are. But it really isn‚Äôt viable anymore and hasn‚Äôt been for ages. 
---
It‚Äôs not a matter of your skill, but your opponents. Dan on Empire couldn‚Äôt Bandit trick CC on Club. Earlier tonight Team Rec tried to trick CC and literally got double Zof charged and instantly killed by NaVi. And I believe they did it to Wildcard too. 
---
But at least currently you can try to waste time with it. With this additional counter it won‚Äôt be possible at all. Breach denial is an important facet and without proper plays and counter plays it will only make the game worse.
---
Well CoD has hella lot of guns that are great.
---
Wow, it almost looks like Wamai‚Äôs üò≥
---
darkzero vs navi
---
idk, this contradicts some stuff I saw in a more reliable leak

Hello DrcoolWA1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/du933t/out_of_every_gun_in_this_game_i_feel_like_one_is/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
bandit tricking has nothing to do with her ability to shoot it.
---
I think deep down they know that the only way to save glaz is to give him his damage back... but they wont admit they were wrong so... here is a distraction :D
---
Pulse: Do you know how i can see your heart beat?
---
Me: well you do hav-
---
Pulse: IT DOESNT MATTER HOW YOUR HEART BEAT (Rock bottoms me)
---
 The problem is not a 1 shot to kill sniper. It looks like she does that, and also destroys gadgets on the other side of a wall without a counter, and also leaves a kill hole - so she also replaces maverick...  
---
Lots of sites are suddenly impossible to defend.
---
Yeah. If only this happened a season earlier and then I agree, an ACOG could‚Äôve been an option for sure
---
She does NOT leave a fucking hole on the reinforced wall. Does anyone watch or listen to these videos posted
---
Obutu3 in twitter
---
Artist is Ponhoka.
---
Cheers
---
Yeah, she has Glaz's sniper /s
---
I'm shocked how little impact Goyo having three deployable shields actually had on the game. I remember watching the video thinking that there was no way that this gets past the test server. These things tend to fix themselves.
---
And the circlejerk marches on...
---
No wrong fact, she is the goddess of destroyer of evil
---
Whichever one you play the most, other than that for me it goes 1.IQ 2.Thatcher 3.Hibana 4.Sledge 5.Thermite. Blackbeard, Twitch, and Blitz all kind of suck and Glaz's is cool but Glaz is a log of wet hot shit. 
---
As far as defenders go its Jager, Doc, and Rook then everyone else are kind of shitters IMO.
---
Yep, that's my artwork :)
---
And on top of that, she low-key kinda cute. :/
---
  What new attacker??
---
Hitting bodyshot is all aim required to back it up, especially since it has worst scope in the game with way more Zoom than ACOG.
---
Spy from tf2 confirmed next season as a third secret op
---
probably 13:30 EST
---
&gt;without a counter
---
Just like Thatcher...
---
Kali. The reveal was yesterday
---
Glaz does, so why not?
---
Ok boomer
---
You are saying like 12x scope is of any benefit in this game.
---
Agree, they should change the mp5k with a shotgun
---
I swear with the Mira elite, the Cav elite that was leaked, and this new OP it makes me think Ubi WANTS R34 artists to go ham.
---
And later Ubi will be like "why people don't use the MP5K?"
---
Hey, the new operator is a strong woman, force diversity? /s
---
They probably can change OPs on the spot or revive themselves as other OPs. Imagine if they had to load a new match everytime they wanted to test how an operator affects a map.
---
Oh true.
---
yeah i think he said that "mite doesnt have a face reveal 'yet'"
---
thank you!!
---
Aug has slower ads time, firerate and takes up half the screen.
---
I'd say the mp5k is still a viable choice depending on your playstyle.
---
Now if the AUG had an ACOG it would have been a different story
---
Different name and different icon, quite a few of weird stuff and grammar mistakes during the reveal
---
Iqs Aug as a defender?
---
B)
---
I would say blitz 
---
But I don't know if you are playing with blitz
---
I like finka can't wait to see her rework
---
Yeah I've used it like 3 times, the only thing overpowered about it is that some people don't know/don't remember it so you can surprise them
---
Goose should be an ops name
---
Happy cake day! üéÇ
---
Wamai's Aug A2 is the AR version (Kaid's smg is the A3), though the model looks different, are they finally address the visual blockage thing? Also is the Acog still available?
---
Also around 3:40 the health meter shows 120 hp, though the circle isn't full so is it a Finka mechanic reworked or is it preparation for the new healer drone Op in year 5?
---
Favela secure on ranked, yeah
---
Anyone who thinks anything shown in the reveal panel is balanced or unbalanced has no clue what they're saying. 
---
Nobody here outside of people like Troy, who have actually played the content and can form valid opinions based on it, has played the new content yet people here sit speculating and whining about things they haven't experienced first hand.
---
This is typical of every season reveal, where everybody here forms opinions because of what they saw and lean towards both extremes before even the TS has dropped.
---
* It only blocks the screen when using ACOG
---
It was a free elite, so you know...
---
Better example would be Amaru, people were in hands here raving about "new insane tactical depth", but it really didn't take much thought to know how Ubi will implement her and why she's going to be crap.
---
&gt; I think her gadget really shouldn't destroy electronics
---
That's the thing that stood out the most to me from the footage.... "Wait, she *what*?" Seems like it's going to basically make reinforcements impossible to defend, unless maybe Kaid can be put far enough back to be out of range.
---
Where's this from? Some sort of mf siege Olympics
---
Crossplay
---
They should try to do 10 (4 teammates, 5 enemies and hostage)
---
I mean.... Not really 3/4 it's just a little bit bigger than other weapons
---
shut the fuck up you retarded copper smoothbrain
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it, it‚Äôs comming on defence aswell now
---
 Attacker: Kali   
---
\*  Alternative to Glaz.
---
I'm Level 110 and have never gotten a legendary
---
She can destroy bandit charges. That‚Äôs a counter, albeit an indirect counter. It doesn‚Äôt nullify bandit tricking, it counters it like how Thatcher counters bandit tricking. Sure, you have to time it but that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs not amazingly versatile. Yeah, thinking about it now she‚Äôs probably a more jack of all trades master of none type and she‚Äôs probably not going to be extremely strong on most maps except the ones which have sites that have big outside facing openings because that allows her to snipe. Overall Ubi did a pretty good job balancing this one.
---
Troy even expressed his displeasure about it. So good point you have there.
---
Lol you calling a plat copper.
---
Nice one
---
She is a western spy
---
AUG has slower ADS so choosing between a small, quick and accurate smg between a strong AR is suitable for this 2 armor 2 speed operator.
---
AUG has no ACOG and i don't remember well so currect me if im wrong but mp5k has a higher fire rate in a game that a headshot is a one shot it's an advantage
---
This new season is season 4
---
Hello PeperoniTheFrog, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/du9mb6/an_idea_for_april_fools/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They can‚Äôt. The weapon file doesn‚Äôt allow that. Basically, the same attachments are shared for every operator who uses that gun. It‚Äôs made that way.
---
It's from a video they showed at finals, after showing the Capitao elite skin
---
It was a clip that played near the end of the season reveal livestream. It was like 4 seconds in length. Cav, Hibanna, Thatcher, Pulse, and Sledge walking towards the camera. Sledge is out of focus the entire time which was annoying but, meh, can't do anything about that on my end.
---
I just got it today and my friend got it two days ago, he put a charge down in a hallway and another friend on cams told him when to detonate, i got it by breaching in basement on bank at bomb b and just got lucky
---
The VSS Vintorez*
---
Fuck you
---
You can't know for sure until you play it.
---
Anyways i see a strong operator that will impact the meta and the community. OP? idk, i don't think so. But i'm sure she will end up banned every ranked resulting in a nerf that may or may not be neccesery
---
Yes sir, I'm not vary good so it took over an hour
---
It's from the new ops reveal, one of the big upcoming tournaments is probably going to have event packs/skins.
---
You are delusional
---
Jason Statham
---
Give me single reason to pick Glaz now
---
What? All these ops are game changing!
---
There is already a icon showing how much time is left.
---
Prolly just random stuff in the dev build, in vanarsity video of the new season the HP finka boosted was normal.
---
So, why not give a DMR as alternative to Wamai instead of MP5K? Let‚Äôs say, 417 would be a great choice you know. Twitch players still don‚Äôt use it(because of FAMAS being too good). No one will ise MP5k over AUG.
---
Everything that is not your everyday boring siege. I hope the devs will fix this game soon
---
Wait... Just a kind of sneak peak of the new os or has the new season begun?
---
Would have taken me a century to do that. Gave a good laugh.
---
Is it not p226 or keratos?
---
Glaz has a faster firing, more forgiving sniper primary. I agree he isn‚Äôt as strong as Kali, but Kali is really only strong gadget wise. 
---
Glaz needs more utility and more leniency when moving with his thermal, but isn‚Äôt killed because of Kali.
---
source?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i want that hibana
---
Up
---
sorry what were you saying?   
---
ubisoft wouldn't implement anything like it huh?  
---
how you like Kali so far?
---
learn spawnpoints then get an angle from a window, pretty simple actually
---
This looks so cool
---
Poop time.
---
You play for 2 hours a week. The majority of players play even more. Therefore, Ubi are not going to update their game based on people like you.
---
it looks like a promo pic for a game in 2002.
---
Ay i got that achievment yesterday
---
Well it‚Äôs working no?
---
oof
---
Let's see.
---
1. Favela.
---
2. Secure Area.
---
3. Trimmed the top part of the video to hide the win distribution score.
---
4. Recruit in play.
---
Don't karma whore. Don't lie in the sub of Siege where people can easily recognize your lies.

---
Link pls
---
It'll release in 4 weeks, tho tts will be out tomorrow.
---
Specs?
---
Still not the new season, but some people got early access already so we pretty much know what to expect already.
---
Is she a defender or attacker?
---
They're back. I think all YouTuber's accidentally released them a bit earlier than they should have. But they're back now.
---
You don‚Äôt
---
You can literally peak when you mount on the side of a wall.
---
Capitao elite is released in Y4S4 so thats a lie
---
Gridlock gets her name from notoriously scoffing pies and crisps when stuck amidst a tonne of traffic or when the road are gridlocked. Her name refers to her weight and eating habits but team rainbow like her personality and find her funny so they decided to keep her. Plus she‚Äôs alright at her job
---
Anyone who says "listen kid" in a thread about video games can't be more then 20 years old.
---
Ah, a gentleman of taste.
---
But can Kali's rifle shoot through plane windows?  That's the most important casual question here.
---
Oh man... Then I'll have 1 week to get to plat with my new pc üòÇ
---
You know they have to reuse guns, right?
---
torpedo in your face is ok but not a blitz rushing on your face with jackal pings all over the place
---
It's not even because of legal reason to begin with. They just don't want to pay for more licenses to use new weapons in the game. If they wanna add say a Galil, then they have to pay a huge chunk of money to the company that manufactures Galil's to be able to then use said gun in Siege.
---
Cav be looking like a snack
---
don't think this shows 6th picking but true
---
Doesn‚Äôt the spawn change every time tho? That‚Äôs my main problem no one answering
---
Atk

No joke, I legit got that only a few days after playing the game. Complete shock and surprise I did it, and it hasn't happened since.
---
Nah
---
69 no upvoteing this guy any more
---
not really...
---
If someone drops something in the room next to you then you hear it through the wall.
---
CSGO has a good system for simulating around directions but it doesnt work for vertical sounds
---
Somewhere, that goose has a pile of acogs stashed.
---
Already is?
---
The most important thing about new releases....
---
dEtAiLs
---
No it's not. I've never bought r6 credits and never will. I have 600 since I bought the game three years ago and I don't intend to send them.
---
The thing is, I don't think they would even complain if it got a damage nerf. It doing 43 damage is already so uneccessary that they would barely notice if got nerfed down to ~36.
---
Lol
---
Glaz is not even have fastest firing DMR, on top of that his damage drop off is so terrible you are better of with any other DMR in the game not speaking about smallest DMR magazine. On distance where OTs is usefull you will have time to only land one shot against everyone except other DMRs which defenders do not have, any other weapon will wreck you without giving you any time to land second shot, and even on top of that Kali has secondary option which is more usefull on OTs effective firing distance. Doesnt all of that sound ridiculous?
---
pretty sure that's just the animation of going invisible.... a nerf like this would kill the operator and it's not like echo is op...
---
Glaz rifle still has the lowest DPS of any DMRs in the game even after his firerate buff
---
No it isnt
---
burns
---
Yep, nothing wrong with map's with 1-2 valuable sites, lack of rotation, bad map design. Everyone calling Skyscraper "ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE MAP" for a reason
---
For once i'm going to agree with the "OP"-statements:
---
-Destroys soft walls  
---
-Insta-downs players  
---
-Destroys hatches with 1 shot  
---
-Destroys barricades with 1 shot  
---
-Destroys breach-denial  
---
-In fact, destroys *almost anything* inside the objective  
---
-Has a CZ75 AS BACKUP WEAPON.  
---
High-rank players who aim train are going to go berserk with this op.
---
I‚Äôm actually excited for it
---
There is no acog according to get flanked
---
Lol. Good luck entry fragging with c75.  Might work in casual, but for sure not in high lvl ranked.
---
I remember people lost their fucking minds over alibi. Her ability has been untouched I believe and has been balanced since she launched.
---
Buffs aren't just "slightly more damage" "speed 2". As I said before go check the dev blogs, I can't remember all buffs out of the blue, but for example synergies And conters are buffs, mute jammer now stops dokk calls. Check the dev blogs and the designer notes and count the number of buffs and nerfs.
---
Maestro is one of the best defenders in the game, he has bullet proof camera that can damage enemies and is useful for plant denial 
---
He also has one of the best guns in the game, I play a lot of maestro but I can understand why they're adding counters
---
wamai please
---
I did say skyscraper could use work, chalet has more than 2 viable sites
---
buy hacks and alt accounts, be toxic, play ranked, get banned, repeat.  
---
jk change jobs, get hired by ubi, work on rainbow, write spaghetti code.
---
It has now been released publically
---
It does 99 damage through multiple walls, it has an insanely fast chambering speed, the operator has amazing utility on top of that. 
---
The only thing this operator doesn't have is Frags and Smokes as secondary gadgets, other that that, Kali is nuts.
---
I wonder what the Chinese players reacting to this
---
How?
---
He‚Äôs not getting the acog
---
We don't worship as the goddess of death, 
---
We see her as a mother who is the goddess of destroyer of evil, as she holds the heads of sinners
---
Petition to start calling it "thrown room" once you lost the control of that room.
---
there is something interesting about the helicopter so the teaser was a helipad and now the main menu have a heli and the pro league final had a helicopter at the start
---
So they should remove bad maps and then add a different bad map back?
---
WE'LL CHEEKI BREEKI LATER, I NEED YOU TO STAY ALIVE, COMRADE
---
acog isn‚Äôt available for wamai. i think IQ still gets to keep it but Wamai probably doesn‚Äôt get acog because that would be pretty overpowered considering he‚Äôs a two speed and he already gets an assault rifle
---
Sniper looks good, but its strength looks overstated. A miss means enough time to be killed very swiftly, the ADS is uncomfortably slow, and the optic seems like a death sentence up close. However, holding an angle with her could be a bit scary, and any weapon with one shot capabilities is nothing to be messed with.
---
Wamai looks very, very fun and gives you more creative options than J√§ger. I think if you choose to just play him like a new J√§ger then you'll just thing he does the job less quickly because he has to wait for his MagNETs to spawn, but if you play it creatively and try to actively hinder the enemy, you'll have a good time.
---
I recognize this art style ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
It‚Äôs NNN don‚Äôt be caught lacking
---
Then why are you on the sub?
---
What's that black marker at 0:35? Are you cheating?
---
ey dmitry, how bout you fire that panzerschreck
---
You can shove that stupid ideas up your ass
---
I have numerous Pro Players who have tested the gun and think it's OP. Would you like to try the "omg you're all just silvers" argument again?
---
People would definitely notice since it's a weapon with a lowish ROF.
---
 A nerf to something like 39 or 40 though? Eh, I wouldn't mind that honestly.
---
Changing his damage will make him need more shots to kill someone, while that sounds dumb in some situations it decides a whole gunfight. And plus what the hell is the point of complaining when another operator designed to lower his pick rate is coming out?
---
In an ideal world I would like a completely reworked Siege from the ground up on a new engine designed specifically for it.
---
That's NEVER gonna happen but man do I hate the fact that a lot of problems with the game currently are literally explained by "Engine limitations"
---
There‚Äôs a Canadian what did you expect
---
And again, no servers in Russia? Really Ubisoft
---
Then don‚Äôt fucking play her if you don‚Äôt like sniper
---
Can we talk about your ping for a second
---
If u see the photos of white death, the best ever sniper you will see this same type
---
Casual MMR is hidden and different from ranked MMR. chances are he plays very little casual so his MMR is at the season baseline.
---
Finally, a sniper rifle that doesnt require 10+ shots to put an OP down.
---
I mean it's IQ's gun so it will have ACOG without a doubt . Otherwise IQ would lose her ACOG if ubi removed it from that gun
---
Welp looks like Jager is still the go to op.
---
Shiva is the destroyer
---
All I can see now is her sniping jager out of the cockpit on plane like quiet to that one guy in his jet
---
When I saw your attachments and gun choice I literally bruh'd out loud
---
Can confirm, turning it off now. I'll post the results
---
Just shoot it 4Head
---
*FBI  O P E N  U P!*
---
I didn‚Äôt even bother with ranked this season . I stopped caring when they replaced raked charms with some weird shaped ones in Australian season
---
This was ranked??
---
No luck catchin‚Äô them swans then?
---
Can I have a 'f' in the chat?
---
#Chfat
---
Good idea, will do.
---
Goyo is a better fragger, kaid has a bit better utility and with the right bans on ranked he is really good. If you want to go full einstein with consideration, the new attacker counters kaid (and just about everyone but since kaid has fewer counters it hits him harder) so...  well if you want to play it safe you wait until the new ops have been in play for a while.
---
wait this is the secondary shotgun for alibi not the keratos
---
Why would you ever use something else other than acog on mp5 it makes 0 sense
---
This is my concern. I think in practice this will be a good nerf, but I don't think that being 2/2 will change that drasticly, it's better, but I don't think that being 2/2 will change that drasticly, it's better, but I don't think that being 2/2 will change that drasticly, it's better, but I think it will take quite a long time for the operator get back up and most of the time, I was also really close to the wall too, so that wouldn‚Äôt have been a good idea lol.
---
ofc its the jager main saying his gun is balanced
---
I only don't understand why it says 2F and 1F respectively though.
---
I'm out of the loop here cause I know nothing about this new operator,  can someone please describe what her gadget and weapons are? What makes her so powerful?
---
I played plenty in Y1&amp;2. My playtime fell off when the game started losing it. Barely play = 500 hours gametime. You‚Äôre ridiculous.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a future trailer for the new game mode called stadium in y5s1
---

---
It's a common misconception that Thatcher does anything against bandit tricking. Pretty sure Kali will do damage to you but not down you if you stand there and deny the breach. New defender should make bandit tricking much easier if nades/cap are used to move the bandit.
---
montagne has gotten 3 nerfs recently and he hasnt been touched at all except this since nerf pretty much well there was the revolver nerf but that didnt really matter so yes they can change them and your precious jager is probably gonna get nerfed
---
i pretty sure echo got a nerf for his drone its more visible now
---
Imagine a K9 operator whose doggo could do smth like that.
---
Or just make the dog like the ones from COD and just let the dog get an ace on his own
---
1. Her gadget is more situational then Thatcher's grenade.
---
2. Her rifle doesn't destroy castle doors/windows or deploy-able shields.
---
3. The C-75 has horrible iron sights and its clip size would limit you to one or maybe two entry kills.
---
I think everyone is overestimating the usefulness of her sniper, I think the minimum 5x zoom really limits your viability on a lot of maps and the choice of no SMG limits her rushing abilities. I think she will be very situational and I still see Thatcher being a much more favorable choice for most people on most maps. I think she is much more support oriented than everyone thinks. I think she will be very, very strong for holding some bomb-plant spots though so that might effect the meta a bit. 
---
I honestly think the defender with an AUG worries me more, even though his gadget seems kind of hit or miss.
---
Gun is an AR like jesus Christ how many times does it need to be said? Compared to other AR's on attack it is an average gun, stop complaining when your attacking your gun does the same amount of damage as his. Your just bad is all I'm getting from this.
---
Yes stop adding counters to an s tier defender who has an extremely useful gadget, great primaries and secondaries, impact grenades and an acog.
---
Video source please.
---
oh that makes sense! thank you for the info!
---
I think the problem with Goyo is that people aren't sure how to use him and using him in the wrong way can hurt your team. When he goes into pro league next season we'll probably start to see better ways of using him and those will filter into ranked.
---
Waaaaa I'm afraid of change *snif* Waaaaaaaaa
---
If they replace them, then good. I hate that I bought 5 loot packs and didn‚Äôt get the Kapkan set I was after. It‚Äôs a shitty system.
---
I saw Ela elite in a Y4S4 preview on youtube so I think she will be released in november before season 4
---
You'd lose the bet.
---
No plug signs at the top right corner. Definitely a desync issue.
---
Spoilers
---
I at first thought this would be the end to bandit tricking, but it looks like she would destroy a thermite charge at the same time. I find her concept pretty cool, if you have decent aim she should be pretty fun.
---
Still be maining ma man Thatcher though üòÖ
---
Why dont you buy ops because elites are kinda pointless
---
Nice. Happy for you :)
---
There will be no change around bandit tricking
---
If you don‚Äôt have proof then don‚Äôt post he does .
---
He's right, all sites on Chalet are near impossible.

That's a "bruh" from me on the gun attachments.
---
But we are in November
---
We‚Äôve only had 1 elite this season afaik so then ela would probs be the second
---
Y E S
---
No, they didn't.
---
Bodyshot is enough though.
---
skyscraper will be removed in y4s4, someone on youtube confirmed it
---
The large trigger guard?? The PPSh had a relatively big guard for operation with gloves in winter.
---
Apparently there will, now that attackers can run Double Thatcher. I for one am pleased to see the end of Bandit tricking. Defense has had the advantage for so long, it's good to see the sides become more equal. If you're really so uptight about locking off walls, wait till next year when they release another Kaid/Bandit type.
---
Cool
---
My point is for such a slow ass gun all it does it injure. Meaning when shes cycling it her teammates can easily challenge and light her ass up easily.  Stop crying about perceived toxicity and grow up.. Jesus
---
I mean yea, but Warden having an ACOG is really blown out of proportion. It's not like making his gun more viable than it already is will do anything about the situational-ism of his gadget. And I think Ubi is making it pretty clear that they only want 1-speed anchors to have ACOG's.
---
Ubi should remove the full auto sidearm, now shes too versatile
---
I'm excited for what might happen to Nokk. She's the only one we don't know what adjustment she will get exactly.
---
jUsT sTaNd StIlL bRo
---
okay that hurt
---
That‚Äôs true, could come out next week and we won‚Äôt know till then. All I saw was the Capitao since I was asleep during the panel
---
yes she can
---
Explain why Goyo has the same gun as Kaid but it does have ACOG ?
---
buck elite has been found in the files
---
Lmaoooooo
---
Maybe it's easier to take a acog off a weapon than add one.
---
Wdym i see dokk with c75 all the time
---
Considering Kali, they should drop glaz's fire rate, take away the smokes, and revert him to the old pre-rework state when his thermal had no motion sensor.
---
There should be something about Nokk along with Jackal change that was discussed before. Though we don't know what Nokk will get exactly.
---
Really confused about why Ubi gave Wamai an assault rifle and an SMG instead of an assault rifle and shotgun.
---
There is 20 days left
---
Lol people are mass downvoting my comments, salty much?
---
More than likely since it‚Äôs in the game and ready, they could drop it just before the new season goes live
---
Yeah, so? 2 rapid-fire body shots are already enough with a DEAGLE, which is a PISTOL. This is a BOLT ACTION. Making it 2 shot down will literally kill the pick rate of Kali when everyone else can spray you down in less than a second.
---
The fact that it doesn't one tap like an AWP is already generous.
---
Final fantasy lied to me
---
You can nerf in other ways to. Like ads or time between shots. Maybe make it that you need to zoom out between shots
---
Shit idea
---
They have managed to split it the coding. Check the YouTube videos (which probably got taken down). Which is why they could take the risk of giving wamai the acog.
---
Varsity gaming confirmed it in the comments that iq indeed still has the acog but wamai doesn't have it.
---
If it can be taken off, it can most definitely be added.
---
It's quite literally a acog = 1 or 0.
---
Ubisoft didn't listen to the Pros feedback soon enough and after 2 weeks of test servers, the new Op was unleashed in their full untamed form. 100% ban rate in Pro League. Meanwhile Ranked Stars call "Meta Abuse" when they forgot to ban this beast!
---
VarsityGaming in one of his comments on his youtube video confirmed that the Aug won't have an ACOG. Didn't seem like he played IQ, but from what he remembers, only Wamai lacks the ACOG, IQ still has it.
---
Is something directly from the horses mouth of someone that played the ops a good enough source?
---
nah I prefer my Capitao without an eye patch where the damaged eye is shown
---
Goyo ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù
---
Rainbow Six Siege 2
---
I would like it if Ubi gave her the SPSMG9 (Clash's full auto secondary). This way N√∏kk could play with a Shotgun/SMG/Claymore Loadout, with would fit her greatly and would not kick her fragging power through the roof.
---
She is a good operator in Pro League, with should be noted.
---
u ruined the joke by backing down that easily.
---
What? It literally goes through reinforced walls and has no counters
---
I will see tomorrow starting from buck . then i will go see cav
---
Goyo strat 2.0
---
Mozzie...
---
How do you mean?
---
I‚Äôm really hoping that isn‚Äôt the case
---
Not thatcher, maybe smoke. Hope not mute because I like his mysterious identity.
---
Shit . Time to switch to hostage then
---
are you really this stupid? You think ubi cant remove an attachment option for one operator? A sight isnt stuck to the gun
---
Always at invitationals
---
Actually not a bad idea tbf
---
If you smeeeeeeeell, what the Pulse is scanning!!
---
FUZE MAINS BE LIKE
---
THX FOR THE ASSIST WAMAI!
---
Nah, it will not go away  Kali can proably destroy thermite/hibana charges if she is not careful with her gadget which makes her a shittier thatcher against bandit tricking, probably sounds a lot too, hard to coordinate. Bandit tricking reigns.
---
And answering this in a rude way will not help either
---
Stop playing the game. It will make it a better game. Also fuck you.
---
Gotta see myself in the TTS tomorrow
---
I think they‚Äôll do what they did with smoke and drop it like a few weeks before the new season
---
Have you seen the ads time? If I remember correctly, that looks well over 700 ms, which is what BB and Glaz had before the global ads buffs.
---
If she shoots her sniper like this, she can say goodbye to her shoulder.
---
Kali will be the new White Feather of siege.
---
I have more
---
After the terrible results of Breakpoint (which, *of course*, has a battle pass), they're trying to change everything wrong from the present and future game. They might drop it from Siege altogether, or change it so it's not how dumb as it was supposed to work.

Hello PlaccyLion, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dubk18/psa_stop_ruining_other_peoples_ranks_because_you/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
/r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow PSAs because of repetitive abuses.
---
Choose a different title and re-submit your post. Thank you.
---
She has the facial structure of alibi and gridlock combined
---
If you watch varsity's video where they play the new operators, you'll find out the rifle is useless in CQB. Unlike Glaz where you can just spam left click with his DMR, her sniper in close combat will fuck her up.
---
stop
---
ahh thank you, yeah hate that
---
reworks &gt; new maps
---
you start with a guy and he can leave after you started
---
Idk I was watching varsity and he said it was easy to trick her with bandit since you take no dmg
---
Kali was obviously done by someone in the company people cant say no. I wonder if that person also created gridlock
---
All projectiles will reset and recooked, it might be entirely possible that Ying puts her protective glasses up too soon because of the reset and still be partially flashed.
---
I agree that this season's are ugly but back in parabellum and grimsky there were some nices ones

how many bundles is that? cuz you can try to go and make every of your ops stylish

there's indeed a lot of filler in alpha pack but it's the only way to get legendaries and old epics

Sorry for the jojoke

‚ÄúFor most people‚Äù yeah well this morning I sat around for six 2 minute 30 second Ques and I couldn‚Äôt find a match of Thunt. That‚Äôs 15 minutes and surprise I never found a lobby. I go to Que up for casual and I find a match within a minute and a half. Ranked I got around the same mark as causal. 
---
The problem is I spent a good portion of the last I‚Äôm few days trying to find Thunts and Ranked games. I still haven‚Äôt found a single public lobby Thunt match and I‚Äôve only got about 4 ranked matches to Que up. Causal is how it used to be. I‚Äôd wait a minute maybe two and I‚Äôd be thrown into Thunts or a ranked match rather quickly without needing to go in and out of ques.
---
My internets improved
---
My location stayed the same
---
I get that a lot of the community are young adults who have lives including school. I understand siege isn‚Äôt the most popular game on console let alone on PC. I understand that searching in the morning can yield different results than searching in the afternoon. That being said I should be able to find Thunt Lobbies and Ranked lobbies fairly easily. It‚Äòs not like I live in some small town village I live in one of the biggest cities in Texas. The only thing I can think of is that Ubisoft has done something to the Ques at least on Xbox and somewhat on PC. There are people telling me they‚Äôll get matches if they‚Äôre in a squad yet solo they can‚Äôt find anything. 
---
You really shouldn‚Äôt be trying to provide advice on something you most likely haven‚Äôt encountered. And if you have then my point stands. Resetting Ques does not fix it. Restarting the game the console or my internet connection has not fixed it. It‚Äôs a problem most likely on Ubisoft‚Äôs end and the fact you‚Äôre wasting peoples time by saying ‚Äújust reset que 5head‚Äù is very hilarious. I‚Äôd love to see you try to fix this problem yourself by resetting the que over and over again until you realize ‚Äúoh hey wait
---
It doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù

I‚Äôm glad you said /s. How else was I to know you were joking? Crisis averted üòéüòé

We‚Äôre already out here thinking of reworks when he is not even playable at all yet.

How does she negate bandit tricking? If anything she makes it impossible to stop a bandit trick.

Propably beacuase they can't think of a buff/nerf to this operator?"

Uh....The pinned mega thread exists ?

I know your joking but you'd be surprised how many idiots get pissed off because I forget to add the /s and they think I'm being serious.

Skyscraper will be removed from the Unranked and Ranked map pool when Shifting Tides goes live

BURN THE HWEATFIELDS
---
Me because I like being able to see my screen
---
Which doesnt stop CSGO and Siege looks WAAAY better than that.
---
She will get banned more than Jackal.
---
Don't really care, I get your point , I totally understand your point. But jager is not getting a nerf, he has an AR which are meant to normally do the damage his current gun does so. If it happens then, ok it happens.
---
"Taking up arms for the defense of one's country and its people" is a bit more cavalier and respectable than "taking up arms for the highest bidder"

Say what you want about special forces but I like them a whole lot more than war profiteers

YESSSSSSSSSSS..
---
New finka buff :D
---
I don't think that's sledge, he's meant to be quite tall, tall enough to appear taller than pulse even with perspective. (also I'm hopeful for another SAS face reveal)
---
No, but this is also an assist kill so it‚Äôs irrelevant, as stated by other comments.
---
I disagree, the Twitch and Thatcher buffs, Kali introduced as another way to destroy it are both nerfs, hope they don't touch his gadget directly.
---
Because he‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs meant to be from when he was younger, like Thatcher and Smoke.
---
pro players have the same opinion so...
---
Yea maybe everyone keeps the health? I saw many people talking about a finka buff
---
Isn't glaz already useless though
---
I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but I don't consider this a flick.
---
Which one is tat?
---
Yah
---
I agree, but they once did serve their country as well.
---
i never complain or make feedback about any OPs. doesnt mean i cant believe something is broken
---
Yes, it detonates and destroys the magnet.
---
Are you going to get the new elite skin too?
---
BOSG will be also useless on attack
---
Damn

Just gotta wait a day then.

Thanks boi

Oy, but those shitty trap skins though

that flick tho !
---
I mean I understand them adding new ops to become the new meta but they took kali too far. Completely destroying bandit walls? That‚Äôs crazy
---
Th has matchmaking and lone wolf mode tho
---
Cool charm but that skin is gorgeous
---
Some folks dont like that AUG takes up half the screen. No acog anyways.
---
it's suppressed...
---
You can change the retical
---
Mmmmmmm skins win games bruh, so that's fine.
---
But I have the IQ black ice that I don't use on iq, and the PL skin, so I'll use it on this dude.
---
when you get free time in design class
---
At this point they need to reduce movement penalty for glaz and make him an entry fragger with one smoke or no smokes
---
Ah that makes sense
---
How many times are they going to nerf blitz?
---
Yeah they do. They let certain players watch perspective vods to see if a person is cheating. It‚Äôs called csgo overwatch.
---
Yeah he needs his scope back, that‚Äôs what made Glaz Glaz. Yet now he‚Äôs useless
---
Oh no, the r34 Lords have spotted this!

Nope, I tried it, with both rainbow 6 and steep

Magnetic jaeger ads replacement basically does as shown to tachanka but instead projectiles like grenades or ash charges
---
I do wonder if he's in every map, I did find a couple.
---
I say wamai is fine, but Kali needs to be looked into.
---
Instead of nerfing glaz they should have just made warden better.
---
rarely use it, sometimes dont even bother because i know i just get killed right after but not too long ago it was 2v3 with a friend, i got downed and reminded me to wake up and won the 2v3, that's probably the only time that thing was useful
---
It got leaked he‚Äôs getting one thankfully, but it sounds like it‚Äôs gonna be at least another season or two before he gets his.  Stay strong fellow Buck main, his day is coming.
---
Ah ok thanks for clearing things up
---
back in the days it was the best weapon

I think I just read someone go through the process of a stroke

It's the first one I found!

---
That's a great idea.
---
It takes away Capitou bolts and wamai recharges his gadget
---
yeah but in a 1v5 situation its verry unpredictible what that 1 receuit is and the fact that the player can chage the gaget mid round is too unpredictable it would be hard to determine who the recruit is bcs you recongnise ops by thier unifirm and face you dont recognise capitao by the crossbow on his back for example so it would be a verry hard feature to implement and it would fuck up most of the mechanics of the game
---
And the enemy team?
---
Honestly Glaz is kind of a mess anyway. His base design is a relic from the early days of Siege where noone knew how the game would be played once the meta developed. He's kind of like Tachanka in that sense: Their abilities seem like cool ideas on paper, but are fairly worthless for their intended purpose in practice. Only difference is that Glaz's smoke vision scope helped him find some utility in doing the polar opposite of what he was originally meant to do (That is to say, getting close and aggressively pushing).
---
The way I see it, they can either keep his smoke vision but give him a more close quarters weapon to make smoke pushing his actual intended thing, or replace his gadget and tune his weapon to make him a better sniper. Either way, he's gonna need work.
---
Operation health, introduction of ltms, and operator balancing (specifically ela and lion) are good ones to mention. 
---
For how it was developed make sure to talk about the book it is based off
---
Buck elite makes a whole lot more sense than Montagne, given one of the photos in your album is his CAMRS with a redesigned skeleton key.
---
I mean if it‚Äôs late in the round it‚Äôs a decent call out because when someone says ‚Äúroom‚Äù it most likely means obj
---
Or just don‚Äôt play console? Leaning from the hip literally does not do anything Other than just look cool. If you really have to lean from the hip use a nitro and then lean. They aren‚Äôt going to add it any time soon
---
Frost. Don‚Äôt know why, but she just works with me
---
Well I wonder if they gave glaz back his smokes, and buffed his scope to not need to stand perfectly still, gave him more of an entry fragger role, could that make this a little more balanced? They say two three months ago, when they full well knew they were releasing Kali soon, that they wanted glaz to be a more sniper/suppression fire role, then they do this? It doesn't make much sense, glaz I could see being an amazing entry fragger if they just gave him back smokes then maybe leave Kali as is and let her get those long range kills while glaz gets them through smokes closer to the obj
---
They are both influential figures which is what I said. Can you read or not? KG is arguably more influential than Kix, doesn't matter his personality. 
---
So Goyo will only be good now and not extremely strong. Your opinions change pretty quick when it suits you it seems.
---
Oof
---
No no no thank YOU bro.
---
But I bet if you queued for casual it would take under a minute.
---
She visits a museum with her father and sees the uniforms on display alongside the gun she poses with. She wears it as a tribute to that.
---
There is the smart guy
---
Not being a dick I actually agree with this
---
And it means that your bullets are delayed by the same amount, cancelling out the advantage. However if someone peaks you and you have high ping, it means that they can see you before they even appear on your screen, and YOUR bullets are still delayed, resulting in double the disadvantage. If you have a ping of 150ms+ and somebody peaks you, you need to have half their reaction time in order to win the fight.
---
High ping is a massive disadvantage, to the point where it is basically unplayable.
---
"Snipin's a good job, mate."
---
I don't really think so. Just because it's a smaller trend doesn't mean it won't pick up. It'll probably be the same trend. And I believe I can remember some people that thought that the last 4 operators would be OP. Out of all of them, I believe that they were correct with only one operator; Goyo. Even then I still think that Goyo has some ways-to-go as far as strats.
---
Nonono thank YOU for the thank you
---
I hope but lets face it ubi releases another shit op and people want then to fix it asap leaving ops like iq and castle in the trash.
---
I hear this every time I play. I thought it was normal to refer to obj as room.
---
Jesus someone with a brain. It‚Äôs painfully obvious to read these comments and see who is just bad at the game.
---
there is, but they're generally the minority tbf. like in paper, the red dot is the worst option, but people still use it.
---
this isnt a good spot for the drone as it is half on and half
---
You can't make a sniper operator that literally can do it all. If you were to put a sight on the C75 she would be able to dominate in close range, long range, and maybe even medium range. I'll pass.
---
Wow, thats extremely bizarre. I have not seen a post like this before. I am completely lost for words....
---

Yet in my experiance, 8 out of 10 missed lol.

I just wish they had started doing it sooner. They spoiled us for a while, when they should've slowly trickled new guns in. Now we're left all jaded and disappointed.
---
See above comment reply‚Äôs are not working for me rn
---
No it‚Äôs not cheating they lose points and who cares about the KD it doesn‚Äôt really affect anything. It‚Äôs being scummy not cheating my man üòÇ
---
Yeah
---
it does kill goyo shields 
---
tldr it's thatcher plus ash without ash breaching
---
I made a post about it and got pretty deep with why it's all concerning
---
Yep. C75 is the full auto Koreans have, P226 is the SAS pistol.
---
Alright, thanks for the clarification
---
Maybe just the weapons of his team
---
So if you can give two people the same gun but one without acog and one with which people said you couldnt, how come they didnt just do this for Warden‚Äôs MPX?
---
It is a nerf for Echo, but big nerf for iQ......
---
Looks more like Putin than the Rock.
---
Welcome
---
&gt; KG is arguably more influential than Kix 
---
hahahahahaha 
---
&gt; and not extremely strong. 
---
Good is a subset of extremely strong, and when he is extremely strong in Pro League i will come back to this post and call you dumb
---
How
---
I mentioned OP Health but I totally forgot about the balancing stuff, thanks!!
---
And, I talked a bit about Tom Clancy but I don't want to make a summary about his book so I wrote this part as short as I could.
---
Why does maestro need a nerf? He's countered by a lot of operators and frag grenades lol. It's on maestros to cleverly place his gadget. People love to complain any good operator is OP. Echo deserved a small nerf. This may be a bit much but maestro? No way.
---
Thermite, his gun is astounding with the extended barrel. Also there's nothing like decimating the enemies defences so explosively
---
I love these kinds of edits
---
Who tf wants capita√µ elite? Give us Ela and Cav elite!
---
Have had the game for 2 years believe me it's been worse
---
I would... it's a great gun. AUG takes up a good 1/3 of your screen.
---
Idk man, probably for the same reason devs talked a few weeks ago about how difficult it is to balance an Op with a sniper. Then they threw another sniper in the game. Just because they can
---
Welcome! Good luck on it!
---
Stop solo queuing play with a friend
---
So fucking clean, I love it

thank u man!

I'd give an award but im poor

Yes

Then they can lower the gun slightly... literally this is the ONLY game where that AUG takes up THAT much screen..
---
On Defense say the Sweater Boy Rook, I love playing support and while I do play doc and Lesion, to me Rook will always be special as the first real op I unlocked and played way back when siege first came out and before while in beta
---
On attack, Gridlock has settled so well with me and how I play
---
And in terms of Aestically whose the coolest it's gotta be the biggest boys my man Montange
---
I dont think she is balanced but I guess we'll see. Just my opinion.
---
Wamai doesn‚Äôt have it tho lol I‚Äôll probably end up using MP5K since AUG won‚Äôt have Acog. Ubi kinda sucks at choosing which guns to recycle
---
I got that reference

Isn't it throne, not "thrown", room?

It‚Äôs just his nickname I thought

He's already strong, no need to buff

I kinda see it

---
jackal is very overpowered in the right hands, if someone really learns how to use him. but that's pretty rare and it's just annoyance bans.
---
Hopefully it's a shield rework and not another nerf that will make them more unplayable then they already are
---
Jackal is primarily banned because of how much of an annoyance he is to deal with especially for roamer mains who will have to keep moving to attempt not to be killed because of jackal

Oh I see, thanks tho!

They did teach lots of myths related to Mahabharata and Shiva, except for this.

DL pls

Just be happy that we got theme park reworked and stop complaining, its such a stupid thing to complain about
---
Everything about this imagine is cursed
---
Or just have Roamers shoot the drill on the other side. Or the new Def throw his gadget near reinforcements to stop the device.
---
idk I just gave them the guns I liked
---
on a DMR*
---
i refuse to call that thing a shotgun
---
Is the TTS now online.
---
(sorry for the discord conversation in the background)
---
I suggested years ago on another reddit account adjusting the countdown timer on defender runouts or some sort of counter op, especially on maps like Skyscraper where toxic players make the game unplayable. Another, suggestion I had was to restrict runouts for at least 30 seconds after prep phase. I got a ton of abuse from other users, basically saying "get good, kid."
---
I think the whole Lion 'anti-runout' idea is great. It would really punish defenders who are overly aggressive and rely on runouts to get kills. It's the one aspect of the game that still jars me up.
---
1 shot chest is a down yikes
---
ahahahaha but ubisoft put it in the game anyways :3
---
I wasn't complaining. It was a joke.
---
Wamai God. Pun intended.
---
I'm liking it.
---
Finka is easier to play and use so if you have a strategic sense I would go dokk. With her you have to plan your distances with her long range weapons, as well as strategically plan calls. You can also help your teammates with hacked cams. Finka is mainly just press a button when you push in or someone goes down.
---
It‚Äôs the whole screen almost, you can see it in the video.
---
Ok thank you, how do you have multiple mains on your reddit account?
---
oh... well then I guess I fucked up, sorry
---
I think it's the devs thinking this seasons meta will be changed, instead of seeing a jaeger and thatcher every game , you might see more of kali and wami (sorry if I butchered their names)
---
I think the biggest problem simply is, that Rainbow 6 is not a game for snipers to begin with. The maps are too small. Any sniper in your team will mostly be a hindrance.
---
He can be great, i have begun maining him around mid doktors curse he is amazing for forcing people out of hiding spots or roasting them alive when they are on cams
---
The blitz batteries part why would you need to do that
---
Hence, it pleases the largest amount of players, thus making more money for Ubi, to balance around casuals.
---
Change user flair then edit.
---
 Idk why mine changed back to my old one.
---
Need to sell DLC ops somehow...
---
Ubisofts course is extremely concerning. New ops are often two older ops combined. And they have a price tag on them.
---
Probably Finka. Dokk isn‚Äôt a bad choice, but she has unforgiving weapons, and isn‚Äôt as good as she used to be.
---
Beat me to it
---
That's what my friend is always saying.
---
Nice try but I saw the reload between the first and second kill.
---
He's actually incredibly useful and has pretty good weapons. One of the better operators imo, even though I rarely use him. Besides, we gotta get an Elite for everyone at some point.
---
Oh ok
---
She has the C75. Really you should only be using the rifle in a support capacity. If you're moving about the map, the secondary SMG is your best bet
---
The BOSG is similar and it‚Äôs a meme. Glaz used to be able to do the same thing and was never played because he was a meme. I think Kali is strong because of her gadget, but the gun is nothing to worry about imo.
---
Oh shit, I didn't even realize that
---
You would get all the ops that came out this season but you should wait until next season for a few reasons. There will probably be an exclusive skin for purchasing before a specific date and you‚Äôll have the VIP discount for 4 seasons instead of 1.
---
U can edit pics
---
I went to local files and the button isnt lit up
---
The game is on an external driver in the file steam library
---
Went to steam settings to make that the default file and it was already but still did not work
---
Uplay isnt recognizing it either
---
I hate jackal just because he completely ruins my play style, I don't ever really make plays until late round, where I come in last minute with the Sas shotgun and start clearing people out. But that's ruined when the entire enemy teams learns my position
---
You missed every operator in the game
---
No
---
Glaz and kali need better more reliable secondarys to be viable
---
Damn ash has beef with Mira and Kali, will she ever stop?
---
That is because you are not playing in pro league. Wait until they are out of quarantine and pros have an actual chance to use them.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs a big mouth on that homie
---
Yeah gadget is fine, but they could just give him a better weapon. Sharing UMP with Pulse is the worst thing for Castle, as the UMP is not going to get buffed because Pulse.
---
Looks like a great season with good new operators, good minor changes, and a good new version of a map. Just allround good stuff!
---
I mean better is subjective.
---
Kalis charges don‚Äôt break Ash sized holes. They make small kill holes. Anyone can do that.
---
Kalis charges can be destroyed by shooting them, they also take a few seconds to detonate. Can‚Äôt shoot an Ash charge. Can‚Äôt shoot an emp. You could theoretically remove a gadget when you see the charge hit if the timing is perfect.
---
Kalis charges also destroy team mate devices. So you can‚Äôt Hibana or Thermite a wall, emp it, then activate the device. This lets Def set up gadgets again.
---
Kalis sniper also has no removable scope like Glaz. Which makes it bad at close range. And if it‚Äôs hip fire isn‚Äôt good, even worse. Glaz can fire faster and see through smokes. Kali can‚Äôt.
---
That‚Äôs called pros and cons and it‚Äôs how you balance operators.
---
Kalis god of destruction, got smite open rn lmao
---
i wonder what he uses it for
---
Jackal we all know why. Twitch still extremely strong gun F2. Zofia solid gun good gadget and I swear she‚Äôs a tank 2 armor more like 3 with room armor
---
agreed
---
Good job
---
Now who is your favorite?
---
Have you already gotten you invitation to join Navi?
---
woah these actually look good
---
I was gonna point it out too but still a nice 4k
---
All I can say Monty Elite better show his face that was revealed a long time ago
---
joined a match midway waiting for my friends to finish their game, this was the result.
---
I want to fornicate with succ
---
Thank you
---
seasonal skins/uniforms in this game means its only available to all the **current** operators in the game and that they are only available to buy till the end of the season.
---
nomad/capitao on attack and lesion/ela on defence
---
and offcourse the ones I own an elite skin for
---
stop playing casual
---
I think Capitao shouldn't have gotten an eye patch in his elite skin. I mean, this was when he was young right?
---
you got this pic without kali, would be a great wallpaper? lol
---
what did it have?
---
The issue that people had with glaz pre-nerf is that he was almost unbeatable when smoke pushing, especially on places like clubhouse tunnel. The fact that he's usually pushing in with smoke would mean a timer for his gadget wouldn't make much of a difference balance-wise, as all he needs is for his vision to last the duration of a smoke grenade.
---
lol
---
Ya I‚Äôm not speaking to her gun necessarily, because it seems pretty powerful at the moment. My only point is that her gadget is really not all that different from thatcher and I wouldn‚Äôt say is overpowered. If you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs overpowered because it is also paired with her gun there might be merit to that, but I guess we‚Äôll have to see how it goes down on the tts. Btw her gadget doesn‚Äôt make kill holes in reinforced walls, the lance blocks the hole up :)
---
Kinda defensive
---
what did he say lol
---
should be 2 speed 1 armor then
---
I was looking forward to giving my interrogation victims a good time.
---
Wait that means we can throw grenades over that wall into that objective
---
I miss Yacht
---
It‚Äôs the keratos but with a red dot
---
Them thighs
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with self promotion but if people think you‚Äôre being dishonest, they won‚Äôt give you the time of day
---
basically on tower theres a tunnel you can drone through and find a mini diorama of the box art for siege. i think this is just meant to be that except they never got around to finishing this.
---
I got mine a couple months ago and still haven‚Äôt activated it lol
---
First of all, that would qualify as a personal attack and is not proper in a conversation.
---
Second, my point still stands. It does not stop you from doing runouts and thus means its not impossible.
---
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS TO ESCORT THE DAMN HOSTAGE ASH
---
Not literally now. I found this old clip from my recordings
---
Yeah but I'm not him....?

You dropped this

Yep, i must have ruined your day with that sick insult on reddit. Okay, let me fix my statement. It makes it impossible to do a *successful* runout.
---
She can‚Äôt destroy as many gadgets, she‚Äôs not as independent and if she‚Äôs gonna push, she‚Äôs pushing you with the fucking CZ75. 
---
Thatcher can destroy an entire room full of electronics, has a bigger AOE, meaning he can effectively, to a certain extent, counter Echo and Valk, and he‚Äôs got an AR, allowing him to be much more aggressive in close range gunfights, something that Kali can‚Äôt do.

More like being moved down to a one speed
---
Smoke accomplishes the same thing, and Thatcher needs at most 2 EMPS for site. Shotguns can be killers, especially the Russian ones. I like to say: the more you believe in it, the better it works.
---
I miss this mode a lot though, me and my friends loved playing it
---
Siege just gave me trust issues
---
You on xbox?
---
your right, the scout at that point is just better. they have managed to add a weapon worse than the scout
---
Also nerfs Jager cause his pickrate too high and his gadget too strong, then adds in Wamai. Now just wait for it, with that dude and him getting IQs AUG theyll take the ACOG away form both, and for the next season theyll add the brand new operator QI which has a gun with acog and an electronic detector screen that can be mounted on the primary. In keeping with how they seem to nerf old operators and then add a new one doing the same thing but better/slightly different. Right, Glaz 2.0? They dont even bother with new guns anymore. Soon the "new" ops wont just get the same guns, the same ability but better/slightly changed, but also the same skin.
---
Or he‚Äôs just an asshole
---
Lmaoo
---
Nah, pc
---
It recharges like lesion gu's, so in theory he'd be able to do something like cover his own ass while roaming. It also works anywhere you throw it.

Shouldnt the fbi aim at the ni...?
---
Or yk, get good enough to win without doing runouts
---
Why did I feel this so hard
---
Maan i love that map
---
This is the unranked playlist, quick play has 3:30 rounds and 4 rounds where the rotation would be without a clearance level requirement. I'd assume the unranked and ranked playlists would have the same rules.
---
Siege just made me lose hope for humanity with the amount of 2 IQ plays I‚Äôve seen.
---
Yes.
---
yep. she can one shot down with a 12x scope, shoot through 2 layers of soft wall and 3 ops, and is a thatcher alternative. 
---
i just started playing in burnt horizon, so im excited to get my first extremely OP operator.
---
That is not how that format works buddy
---
I mean, she is pretty THICC so I'm OK with that.
---
Runouts are a part of the game, lmao. Just cause you don't like them, doesn't mean they should be nerfed to the ground.
---
They said they‚Äôre never gonna fix house, it‚Äôs their baby
---
It doesn‚Äôt tick down, it‚Äôs up until it fades or you get hurt.
---
And? The fuck does it change in the game? Nothing
---
Yea i dont get it. Im not buying it, thats for sure.
---
Which set of characters was blood orchid? I got it mixed up with Red Crow for whatever reason
---
Don't think it matters really.
---
This isn't the real world lol

This is the best idea that I‚Äôve ever heard. And I‚Äôm a hard core lion main. It makes a lot of sense too
---
"bolt action"
---
Hitbox
---
Why has this game abandoned all realism? Why not just add an actual sniper rifle and not something out of Halo?
---
Siege takes place in the same universe as the original Jack Ryan novels, so he would be waay too old.

Nice, btw, on what aspect ratio do you play?

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
Which is still utter BS.
---
While youre mostly correct with the new statement, its also a matter of skill, in ranked (and maybe unranked) it would indeed become nearly impossible to do a succesfull runout. But in casual you can still be succesfull as long as your aim is better. (And in ranked and unranked you can just ban lion)
---
I fuck with warden heavy, he's situational but still a very good pick in those situations. I can't tell you how many times I've picked Warden on Coastline and stopped a gridlock smoke plant in hookah, or blasted a Ying that thought her candela was gonna wipe out the entire team lol

A friend of ours has a habit of shouting "THEY'RE IN" whenever an attacker is existing

That was an old clip I use the acog now don‚Äôt worry
---
lmao
---
grenades are the new claymores when the defuser goes down
---
I think he means realistically a women probably wouldn't carry that big ass sniper around in any military unit etc.
---
But i mean this game has a giant deployable MMG turret with a shield that appears out of the Lord's pocket (Tachanka) so don't think it matters.
---
Funny from the guy with the Blackbeard flair. Lets not forget that half the time the community overreacting was right on point. Lets also not forget that we already had an ohk sniper, but that one was limited to 6m and still fucking busted. So why shouldnt we be wary already in advance?
---
Won't argue usefulness. I think it's the versatility that'll counts for each operator.  
---
A Jager/Wamai comp makes me think of the Kaid/Bandit and Kaid/Mute combo. Kaid denies hatches and the others deny walls.
---
Looks like a way to get your drone out if you accidentally throw it down there

Obviously

Size, weapons, eyes?

Was pretty much revealed already when Harry joined but ok...

r/BeatMeToIt
---
Well they dropped his damage close range. Ive been a glaz main since the start. Poor dude has been through a lot of reworks. His close range damage drop nerf was the worst.
---
They literally announced the new elite, and then showed this.
---
Yea there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them but why not have an operator that can counter them? Roaming wasn‚Äôt a problem but now we‚Äôve got many operators to counter them two of which you can put your gadget down once and leave it to do it‚Äôs job of locking down hallways and staircases. Lion need a buff and I don‚Äôt see the problem with trying this one out.
---
Lemme get this straight you won't pay for a season pass but happily pay $100 for skins, fair enough lol
---
I like playing warden just for the weapon choices. His ability is best to surprise Ying and Blitz, and works stupidly well with Smoke and Maestro.
---
In short: commissioner Gordon is a fun operator.
---
Glad I'm not the only one confused.
---
Yeah. People will still play him, for sure.
---
It's probably Better, It would give value to being a 3 fatass armor.
---
They‚Äôre really getting away from what made the first few elites awesome.. Now it‚Äôs just every operator in their casual clothes...
---
Why did they nerf him in the first place? I just started playing this season

I believe the perfect balance would be between 2 or 3. Removing the ability to put common reinforcements might be a good idea.

Yeah, i really don't enjoy playing with 150 ping

---
I hope Xbox has a sale when the new season launches.
---
I wish this information was useful to me.
---
:(
---
Think you only get a ban
---
AND THIS. IS TO GO. FURTHER BEYOND
---
Like i said, passive abilities that give your entire team an advantage, and affect the ENTIRE map by the op's sheer presence is cancer. It would require no skill to use, and hence has no place in a tactical shooter such as siege.
---
This game (and Ubi's general handling of the Tom Clancy license) seriously bugs me. Ubi can make a zombie game if they want - just don't put Clancy's name on it.

&gt;YoU thInK EcHo is UnDeRpoWeReD?

Holy shit dude it's the first fucking sentence can you not read?
---
Yeah I absolutely love his pistol on defense, I actually frequently hold longer angles with the pistol and only use his mpx or shotgun for encounters in the same room as the other person, the red dot pistol is so accurate it's nutty
---
What editing software you using
---
Have they said that his gadget works on fuzes pellets? Cos if so does collect all of them or just one?
---
Wtf the quality is so good!
---
It looks like a fucking lee enfeild with a giant drum on the hand guard to me

This is bad

idk y but pulse kinda looks like putin

Nov 11
---
But my question is magnetic can get shield too?
---
I played a game after and I only gained 2 elo after winning
---
No it isn‚Äôt. Most guns can do that in a second or two.
---
I think this is an interesting idea and one that was well articulated but I have issues with the overall balance and meta impact that the titanium wall op would have. I am a mod on the operator suggestion page, so I've seen some similar ideas to this one and I feel that while it makes sense and seems to fit, that its inherently flawed from balancing. 
---
The titanium wall operator would pose a new challenge in siege that would possess one counter, the cryo op, but fundamentally changes the way you attack/defend a site and is only advantageous to defenders. It also creates the necessity to bring the cryo op in case they bring the titanium walls, and defense will almost always bring them because it is so strong. You are essentially obliterating the meta and making it about these two ops which to me, is almost insane. 
---
I think your solution of saying "you know what to expect" is ridiculous and to pose ops that would change everything like that would be really bad for the game. I've seen suggestions of people saying that a "double" reinforcement could pose a similar solution without being as broken as this, but I think that would require more hard breachers overall. I think overall your idea is interesting but why would you break the game like this? Like I dont mean to come off rude but like seriously, if these existed they would mean they would be picked or banned every round and this almost just sounds like it's coming from an echo/mira main just wanting something more OP to keep  people from banning the others, which I don't think is the case but if it is that is not very good logic honestly. 
---
The solution would need to revolve around how to tactically take care of the enablers while keeping it still competitive because this idea makes the hard breachers equally as moot as the enablers for the wall and makes the defense so much stronger. As well you wrote about how the enablers can get rid of bandits and Kaids and mutes easily but you created a counter that could do the same to the titanium walls but it makes the game revolve completely around those two ops and that just seems like a bad idea.
---
Sorry if I sounded harsh I just think this really breaks the game and since I've seen many similar ideas I have had a lot of time to think and say what makes it bad.
---
Oh, it's you again. Well I'm assuming you're baiting me, but here goes. Why can I assume it? Because pros and experienced players have already tested them out.
---
If you check the health at the bottom right she had 120 but the blue bar isn‚Äôt as full as it used to be/ there‚Äôs no white. Unless it‚Äôs always been like that and I‚Äôm just noticing

Hello DictatorToucan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dug57f/pmm_gagn/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
He needs to turn ping on. It's in the settings on the first page, all the way down.
---
Fuck
---
haha, everybody knows his "helmet" *is* his head...
---
Idk it happens all the time
---
No, only grenades and such things
---
The man is dead, have some respect.
---
But it will be very cool if they did it
---
Its blurry but the nametags seems to be to long for anything but sledge
---
It was in game in full reveal so yes.
---
I have no money and no pc. So I use imovie lol, it works for me so no complaints
---
Yeah, I feel like grinding for the ops is part of the game so I didnt just wanna pay for them and take the easy way out
---
go onto the page of the subreddit and go into options and then hit add flair           i think
---
Really like the designs of these ones. Good job Ubi. Love that wetwork gear, especially on Wamai.
---
I'm pretty sure. I saw gameplay where it makes cracks when it's drilling into the surface.
---
Ya this has happened to me too, goyos can be assholes
---
Well it doesn‚Äôt affect the entire map at all it affects outside the map. If you jump out a window to kill someone on rapell you will still most likely kill them even with the instant detection. It just gives the potential for a refrag. And the detection can be lions pings not the regular outside detection.
---
There's no stopping my 15 grenades.
---
I mean I'm not going to but I still wish it looked cooler
---
Everyone knows he is just an illusion for no mere mortal can comprehend his true form
---
Each to their own I'm the opposite, I'll buy season passes but not elites lol
---
I love the logo
---
I hate it
---
For me it is a still image
---
He did get a fire rate buff in a recent patch.
---
agreeable
---
You sir, are a god. Thanks mate.
---
enemy in the destroyed building
---
Yeah some of my friends also didnt bother with grinding and just bought the season passes
---
yeah exactly, just stating that im infact not going to be paying for it lmfao
---
Forget the charm, what the hell is that gorgeous skin on that weapon?
---
Thank you so much
---
Yeet dat room
---
Sounds good and all but half of Pick And Ban‚Äôs strength is to stop another launch Ela or Lion from happening. If Kali ends up launching as strong as them then that could be bad.
---
Not yet
---
Yeah 2 IQ's on the other team would be annoying
---
i really wrote defender's
---
I recently started playing Glaz more and I've honestly enjoyed him, and then I hear of the new operator and how she's supposed to blow him outta the water and I just hope they rework or fix Glaz
---
Damn never mind if cross play existed right now I‚Äôd play with you.
---
Cool and you‚Äôre welcome to have your reply, I don‚Äôt give a shit about it
---
Well that makes the MP5 even stranger. Why not give him a shotgun option instead. Literally no one will choose the MP5
---
Yeah and you responded to me talking about ban rates so I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt agree or disagree with the ban rates cause other wise I know fuck all what you‚Äôre talking about.  Echo as a whole?  His drone?   When you respond to a comment on ban rates with ‚ÄúNoT sAyInG i AgReE oR dIsAgReE‚Äù it just looks to me that you don‚Äôt want to give an opinion on the op
---
cav Hibana Thatcher pulse and doc or Linn
---
He was nerfed because of his lack of counter play. I think with the current operator lineup, bringing his old kit back with a little less umph would be fine. 
---
We now have two anti-grenade operators against his smokes, 2 ops whose main abilities can see through smoke, and bulletproof cams.
---
Pulp Fiction Capitao
---
what gun is the CSRX 300 based off of?
---
The Indian operator looks like she‚Äôll be better than the Kenyan one (my opinion of course).
---
That joke flopped
---
They really fucked up echo huh.
---
Well it became a real possibility now
---
Uhhh, the groza. I‚Äôve played too much PUBG to think that‚Äôs a good idea. I like it
---
I was lucky I saw them
---
That is true, but.
---
We will see during tts if shes actually broken or not.
---
Whats the myth
---
Something has to be done, in my opinion Glaz was is in best stare before thermal vision era but after removig red filter from his scope.
---
His DMR was slow firing, high DMG and no recoil weapon.
---
I really prefer that over banana vision and potato gun.
---
Not being shit is a good way to get better

Glaz's scope is x4, not x2.

Ahhhhhhhhhh I gotcha now.  The kitchen entrance run out is preventable as you literally just have to look though.  Stopping to drink and getting picked is something that‚Äôll happen.  I go to a corner and lay down if I have to before going away from the controller

Thanks for the input fellow gamer! BLOCKED AND REPORTED! Have a nice day. üòÅ

-Yeah we are almost done all we need is to name thus last site. Larry any ideas?

-I dunno just throw something in there.
---
-ü§î
---
?
---
Are the new ops on test server yet?
---
ENGLISH DO YOU SPEAK IT
---
I think that no-recoil, no banana vision would make him a less effective Dokkaebi, since the only differentiating factor would be the flip sight which most people keep up and the ability to call/hack cams.
---
You just played yoself.

Cav is Y4S4. I think it will be leaked tomorrow :  [https://imgur.com/a/SS31ntS](https://imgur.com/a/SS31ntS)

Regardless of the answer, the aug is the worst statistically
---
I've legitimately  once lost  a 1v1 clutch  (after  killing  most of 
---
 the  opponents  myself) because I've   had   no   idea  where  the objective was, and the  only thing  my team said was "**HE'S IN THE ROOM!**" every  five seconds, then they blamed  me for "not listening", even  thoughI kept on asking where the  hell the room is.
---
Ree
---
He literally just got buffed this patch. Wtf are you on about.
---
Stop posting your shitty gameplay. No one wants to watch it.
---
ah, yes, the pistachios will now be fired through a sniper rifle
---
You dont really need imagination to choose an operator and choose a gray, darker gray, lighter gray, light dust, dust, darker dust camo. And literally anybody can post on literally any subreddit.
---
Finally somebody understands
---
He‚Äôs being intentionally dense its deadass the most annoying thing imo lol. Any non gun nuts recognize jagers nasty gun as an ar, including ubisoft. Whys he gotta split hairs to bother ppl lmao
---
Plz send link, I‚Äôll join also the logo is awesome
---
??
---
Wow dude you sure come off as an ass
---
Sorry to here that gamer. üéÆ
---
Hm if so Smoke looks like Jason Statham
---
I‚Äôm reading your comment with the assumption your flair is sarcastic.
---
Heard stuff like this when you're in the dying seconds of a round. "STAIRS" is my pet peeve. Up or down? at least.
---
Solid advice
---
I always say "on site" "on a/b" or "in OBJ"
---
Casual clothes are better than war uniforms imo
---
And able to be heard while they are on the roof (if that is not already a thing)
---
Calm down... it's only a comment on reddit
---
If ubisoft doesn't give these ops fish charms can we please riot?
---
dude ive literally ran into this guy in casual  on a weekly basis back in like January , hes on ps4 right?
---
It‚Äôs funny because I never insulted you by telling you people my rank the fact that you know what rank I am makes you get offended. Your reactions just reveal your hate and bias possibly jealousy not all, but some are just jealous and become primitive to the point where there‚Äôs one guy who‚Äôs been downvoting every comment of mine in here because he‚Äôs that committed haha
---
My first alpha pack - black ice uwu
---
So if i understand, people wanted this, even though it would be overpowered?
---
thats what i meant
---
Try to be more aware of your surroundings and peek corners more than just walking in, you don‚Äôt need to take every gunfight and sometimes it‚Äôs better to wait for them to come to you, also ignore the toxic community
---
If anyone needs me, I‚Äôll be doing exactly that
---
Okay I'll try it.
---
Yeah I think he‚Äôs a farmer
---
Yeah that's my twitter@, you can write me on twitter i'll gladly confirm it :)
---
Actually does do
---
It's 2x according to the game. I'm sure someone has compared it before.
---
Demoman capitao make it happen.
---
Understandable, that‚Äôs why I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested,‚Äù.
---
Have you seen the Smoke elite? And it would make a lot of sense lorewise if it was Sledge since he holds all the athletic records for the SAS.
---
But they've never done 2 operators of the same CTU in one season to get elites, And if that's true When is Ela getting hers because she'd have gotten it already.
---
To the creator of this beautiful art, dont make normal version for at least a year. Make these people suffer the mighty tuna.
---
Lord have mercy if he ever reaches over heal +60
---
Oh sorry I‚Äôm pretty stupid sometimes
---
Edit:Aite bet
---
First of all a bullet doesnt have the kinetic energy to knock you down. Well maybe one of those 2 bore rifles but certainly not the ones we have.
---
And yes it certainly is realistic to be killed in a single shot while wearing armor. Just because you have NIJ level 4 doesnt mean you can tank a shot from an AP .338 lapua magnum round. That'll go through your armor like butter. 
---
And lastly the question was never whether it would be balanced. The question was whether 5 hits to kill is considered quick. (It isnt)
---
Btw a friend wants to know your r6 name
---
Thank you ^^
---
you good bruh
---
fuck r6 she should be doing mma
---
G8A1 his the highest rate of fire and most bullets, making it the best gun available to her. Damage is actually less than the commando, but in a game of headshots, the fire rate wins out.

Mate I'll fully bum you
---
Best waiting to see how things go during the test server, at least
---
The sniper seems op, but realistically, you limited yourself with where you can go as snipers will be weak close range. And let‚Äôs be real, an AR can quickly drop you, so it will be a trade off. I think she will be annoying, but would be somewhat map dependent with when you can play her effectively 
---
Am hoping she‚Äôs solid tho, def looks fun. I love def ops but don‚Äôt really care for off ops. 
---
Hype
---
Its best use is against a BMing tachunky who fetches his turret to kill you without realizing you're zophia
---
I can tell you for sure that they are going to buff her at some point. She's going to be a worse version of Thatcher in every single aspect. The sniper is extremely weak and her gadget is weaker than Thatcher's.
---
You definitely didn't deserve that
---
Yeah, I guess it‚Äôs just the skin/angle
---
He‚Äôs seen drugs
---
No.

---
It's a custom game (judging by the score), I wouldn't say for sure that 6th pick is in the new update.
---
Man you guys make my scales chill
---
I think thats a c4 right?
---
Obviously that is the Easter egg for the incoming Spy operator in year 8 season 4.
---
Earn it with renown
---
Whenever a new season comes out I remember these three things:  
---
1. Everyone said Zophia is better ash/Kaid is better bandit/Alibi killed prefiring/Nomad killed roaming
---
2. Ubi hasn't broken the game with a new operator in 2 years, during operation chimera
---
3. Everyone thought it was going to be finka that broke the game.
---
Her ability is a Thatcher grenade+ it's really good. I think the sniper will actually be a detriment to her performance, if you miss the first shot, you wont win a firefight.
---
Just a little new operator...
---
When you try out for NASCAR
---
Ubi chill with this op art yeah, you can zoom in on her forearms and see veins and shit but the in game model will look like a fucking Barbie doll. Ubisoft literally clickbaits you in game.
---
You can shoot out the gadget from the inside to keep it from going off. It's weaker than an EMP (apart from destroying stuff like Evil Eyes and deployable shields).
---
The reworked Alpha Packs when Ember Rise went  live, at least that's what the official R6 Twitter account said
---
I have been getting some Blood Orchid skins too
---
You were able to get Blood Orchid skins through APs too during Chimera (Y3S1) but that was a bug, this time it seems to be intended
---
Do you get the same one over and over again or do you get Blood Orchid skins in general?
---
Nice sentence structure
---
Man wtf are you 13 or what. I have Glaz in my flair since it was my first operator. I don't play him anymore bc he is weak, but I still like it
---
He went over to ghost recon didn't he? Press f for that game.
---
Gridlock: who are you?
---
Kali: I'm you, but hotter
---
It's a DMR, it's a shotgun purely on paper.
---
There was nothing announced that relates to micro transactions, but assuming you are referring to the battle pass... it‚Äôs nothing like a monthly subscription for mmos. You don‚Äôt need it to play the game, it‚Äôs for skins like, who gives a shit.
---
Yes she can.
---
I remember this being posted during white noise for the first time
---
My full set Brazilian flag still looks better than his elite
---
I want to lose to those arms in an arm wrestling competition.
---
Looks like aim bot. The way it snaps exactly on his head and you only shoot 1 bullet.
---
WE GOT HIM! FBI OPEN UP!
---
&gt;Also I legit saw nobody complain about her being op
---
This sub is loaded with people saying she's op.
---
Prolly still gonna release ela b4 season end, they did the same with smoke last season
---
She can.
---
happy cake day
---
That‚Äôs what he looks like when he takes off his fur suit head
---
It can. Watch prodigio pete's mythbuster video.
---
I guess it does
---
Why the fuck didn't you tell us there was a Rook in the bathroom? Slipped your mind? You forgot to mention Rook was in the bathroom with a goddamn handcannon?!
---
It would be fun for an hour
---
Ubi is about to put out new ops and the old ones is still broken. Just make him immune to his own fire and that will literally fix everything.
---
Fishanka!
---
Why is this on the r6 reddit??
---
I want her to fucking cradle me in those arms.
---
I get to off myself, and turn myself on at the same time. Win-win.
---
Because this is a team game? It works the same way in pretty much every team based game. If you're not happy about it, find a good team
---
Every game has it because it is irl too
---
It is just because of the nature of Siege that you notice it more here than playing CoD while levitating around the map there
---
Every god damn time
---
At this case we will need rook alternatives because his pick rate will be through the roof
---
Yep
---
So the op is male, did I understand that correctly? If so, why is the op nick "√Ñrztin"?
---
Plane isn't even in the game anymore, it's genuinely a non problem.
---
It would be like complaining about how blackbeard is insanely OP on house, even though house has been out of the pool for years now.
---
Why does everybody say the new ops are fishes?
---
There has been debate on this and it should stay as it is. Get used to it and don't hug the corner you're peeking.
---
Maybe lost all his placements to get to copper then rose up?
---
Oh hey it‚Äôs demoman
---
He looks like a mix of doug Judy and jules from pulp fiction
---
He would be the most picked operator in Skyscraper
---
Who knows
---
If people can't play the new operators in ranked because they keep getting banned then we can't know if they're actually OP or not.
---
I'm not pulling this out of my ass lmao, you can search for player stats easily. You just need the username, and yours is in one of your reddit posts.
---
Ubisoft: ‚Äúintroducing Kali, a new operator on the attacking side armed with a bolt action sniper rifle.‚Äù
---
Also Ubisoft: ‚ÄúWho the fuck is Glaz!?‚Äù
---
No they are you season 4
---
I had to think if this was the fun but unbalanced one or the really bad one.
---
Why the hell would you name one map tower and one map skyscraper
---
Her gun would not be good for most people, many people will prefer Thatcher's guns.
---
Like fishdicks ?
---
Operation "Who's Glaz?" is a go.
---
Mozzie's shotgun is great.
---
How is pulling the hammer out, swinging, then switching back to your gun any better than not even having to UN-ADS to break 3 hatches.
---
Yes, the shield does flash!
---
????? There is no reason for Ops with reused guns to not have Acogs. Suddenly the way they fucked over Warden and Nokk had literally zero point. I'm mad.
---
Operation shifting tides clearly saying it Y4S4 = Year 4 season 4
---
I FUCKING LOVE THE COLOR BLUE
---
I love chalet. One of my original favourites. We wont have no old maps left if they keep removing the fun ones ! I dont care how unbalanced some think it is leave it in casual
---
I Ban thatcher and cav, it's a shame people dont mix it up more
---
Dont worry he cant use ACOG
---
But... that's a mackerel.
---
Get the fuck out of my comments, ur an idiot if it didnt help people would use it, EVER
---
How long are ops generally on test server before released to the game?
---
Init frost tho
---
No,he left during this round
---
Cant tell from behind
---
No I don‚Äôt think the new attack opp is OP. I‚Äôll tell you why... clearing rooms with a bolt action rifle that may have multiple people holding multiple angles is hard. It has variable zoom that is 8X to 10X? 15X? Idk i forgot. The point being is that will be a really uncomfortable zoom to clear quickly and efficiently with. 1 Shot from this weapon is down but not out. You need a headshot to get the 1 tap. 
---
 As an attacker, chasing the down but not out defender for the kill often times puts you at risk if it‚Äôs anywhere towards objective room. The bolt action may give the defender enough time to crawl away. That being said, the defender is the actual force to be reckoned with.  The only thing OP MAYBE about this new attacker is her gadget for there seems to be no counter yet or that I know of.
---
There is No such thing as an mp7sd
---
But with the new map rotation system they might come back
---
3 weeks
---
Weird setup of Ash and Capitao.
---
Why do people hate it so much, it's good imo
---
Bitter sweet tbh. Can't find salty players to somehow blame my 150ping anymore for them playing like a prawn. Eish baba
---
Nevermind then, I thought I saw someone shoot out the tip of it from the inside during the reveal. Still my point stands that it's a weaker version of Thatcher.
---

You can barely type a valid sentence, and you can‚Äôt even make a valid argument. You‚Äôre trying to tell me what to do? You‚Äôre an actual clown. Everyone is disagreeing with you. Take a fucking hint you shadow of a human fucking being. Go outside and get a fucking job. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre out in the streets sucking dick, at least then you might actually make someone happy. Fuck off.
---
Again
---
I like that but if you losin then just all leave then no elo loss?
---
Cheers dude!!
---
Epicly fast reply, ty so much fam :)
---
That is too easily abused.
---
Tkers always be leaving before ther person can get revenge
---
Well there is red canister that can ruin this strat anyways.
---
And when chating become a reason for tk?
---
That‚Äôs fucking beautiful
---
Except the fact that it takes more than 3 whole rounds of 7.62x51. If it was the PMM then I would understand a 4 hit kill but not the L1A1.
---
And sure firerate matters, but this game gives high firerate guns significantly lower damage to keep TTK high. The only excuse as to why the vector takes 8 shots to kill but the p226 only takes 5 is because they want guns to take forever to kill.
---
You sure he wasn't lying? For the joke, you know?
---
You've only played 30 games lol
---
That would be so abusive. ‚ÄúOh we are getting smacked, time to leave‚Äù
---
It really ain't that deep
---
DETAILS
---
Her gadget is literally can break Maestro cams and Goyo shield. That's definately not weaker than Thatcher
---
I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre gonna have to either buff glaz or give him a full rebuild. Maybe swap out glaz‚Äôs sniper rifle with a DMR (designated marksman rifle, basically half way between a semi auto assault rifle and a sniper rifle), maybe give him a better secondary. 
---
Maybe give him a flying drone similar to echos (without the sonic blast but with a thermal vision that can see through smoke) to give him superior recon ability.
---
Wow good aim. Must be nice to have :c
---
I didn't say it looked like it. I said they're in a similar "sci-fi/tacticool" vein.
---
Hmm, maybe you just don't envision it.
---
But I do.
---
For example, I'm already imagining how well Castle's blue visor headgear will go well with this upcoming uniform.
---
You can rock that on the soon to be new defender
---
Forgive me for my density but why is Kali drawn like a fish?
---
you are fucking talented
---
Because "Shifting Tides"
---
Eh, I'm not surprised. Hopefully they can make her look better before release, but like I said, ubi has a history with making ethnicity look completely wrong. I also don't want to be the guy that says "Indian people can't be white" or something, but yeah she really does not look remotely Indian..
---
pls stop reminding me I missed out on that and will never be able to get it :(
---
It‚Äôs his backstory.
---
That is actually a very good point I did not think about
---
Gridlock looks as if Kali ate another Kali

You are actually delusional if you think any of those maps will see the light of day.

Get yo weeb ass back to tumblr

Her gun is based off the AWM, right? It looked like an AW-series to me, and since it's chambered in .300 Win Mag then I had guessed that's what it was. Anyone know for sure?
---
You seem to have misread I said that the monthly subscription is  only other avenue for them to add to monetize since every other option is already pushed into it already
---
I've heard that this is a cool successor
---
her thighs: **dummy thicc**
---
Alibi is really fun
---
I'll buy 100

TOXIC OPS IN PLAAAACE
---
Oh also I already got Champion since you remembered.
---
Yep cuz sledge is a absolute unit
---
What are we supposed to watch?
---
Moving the goal posts? the goalposts have been the same this entire time, R6 has long TTKs. Maybe 250ms seems short to you but in the grand scheme of things a quarter second is a long time.
---
I think you just dont want to acknowledge that R6 was designed with long TTKs so people could watch cool videos of 180 headshot flicks over having a fast TTK to encourage slow, tactical gameplay.
---
At the end of the day Ubi wanted an esport and esports have to be fun to watch. People like to see prolonged gunfights over slowly slicing corners and taking people out before they can react.
---
Ah so they're the first 2 to not have an actual badge like I previously said? I guess with year 5 we probably won't have their badges or CTU's in their bio anymore and that they'll just be on blog posts
---
That is sad. Sorry that happened to you.
---
I like big ~~butts~~ guns and I cannot lie
---
Nice! Hold that to your chest as a cool accomplishment.
---
But don‚Äôt try to use that to justify ideas again. Because that‚Äôs dumb.
---
how she gon work out with missing feet

Goyo is built for brawling. Slug Shottie w impacts and run wild.

About time.
---
Ela's pistol is shit, She my main on defense and I can't stand this god awful pistol unless I get a headshot. Best pistol in the game is the PMM.
---
Oh. My bad then. That‚Äôs how it should work tho
---
Yes we do, get flanked made a vid and at the beginning of the round he had like 10/20 ish bullets
---
Shotguns are pretty consistent now though. Especially if you aim down sights, it makes the spread tighter.
---
Is the pmm also your favourit or is there another you like?
---
is her CTU called nighthaven?
---
https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Kali
---
I think you just skimmed his head
---
That is certaibly something that baffles me. Why does it do more damage... I would respect a nerf to the damage
---
He isnt wrong though, vigil has such a nice, plain template of armor and almost all the camos look good in him
---
What the hell happened here
---
Thats what i was thinking just a moment ago
---
Looks like it is
---
wonder what she's compensating
---
That's not how DPS works. If we went by "oh only one headshot to kill" them every gun would be equal. Rather, the pistol is easy to use but the stats in it are objectively garbage. The PMM is best because it has low recoil, ultra high DPS, a super fast reload, and simple sights that are easy to pick up
---
Oh god boys I've been surrounded I'm going to have to cyka blyat my way out
---
nice
---
Oh yeah, they can look very Asian and other more middle eastern and other a mix of those, it's really cool and I think it goes along their old a diverse culture.
---
Alright thats 30 bullets thats still decent
---
Thank you! The original is already hanging in a frame :)
---
Its objectively the best in the game set aside what you've excluded. 9 round mag with a super fast reload, low recoil, high DPS, and simple sights to use. The hip fire is also very solid if you ever need Fuze shield
---
**B R I C C**
---
I was thinking due to its smallish size, you could hide it outside a doorway and use a grenade on the owner.
---
Thanks man. I'm gonna see it later.
---
they'd be a much more worthwhile purchase, meaning more people who previously were aware of what a scam they were would buy them. those who were too stupid to calculate their worth or played 24/7 anyway to make them worth it wouldn't see any change.
---
Dude eBay
---
Best girl
---
Would you rather a Pro League player who spends his life mastering a video game having more power to properly give good feedback or any Copper player just demanding anything they want changed in a game? Also I said that I don‚Äôt judge people based off of Ranks I just think players who‚Äôve play Siege since the Alpha or Beta have a bit more experience because they played the game longer and probably have more weight to what they have to say. Does a general have more say than private? Of course. Does a Queen Bee have to go get nectar from flowers no, the workers do. Everybody deserves a right to voice their opinions, but I believe that some people might have more knowledge on things than others. Nobody is better than another. It‚Äôs so hard not offending anybody these days.
---
I never have luck with eBay but I‚Äôll try it.
---
Thou shalt go to cams
---
Do you smell it?
---
She even has the pocket AK
---
So basically it's like CBRN Lion and Finka belong to, Maverick and Clash with UTRT (Urban Tactical response team) and Amaru with APCA?
---
If you reinforce from the other side, you see potential Maverick-Holes better from the inside of the Room. Thats the Reason.
---
But when there is a Mira in the Team and there is no communication where she places the Windows, this behavior from the Teammates is stupid
---
I know that it is great yet i favour the MK1 9mm
---
Yes, but no one I know says ‚Äú45 supersonic‚Äù
