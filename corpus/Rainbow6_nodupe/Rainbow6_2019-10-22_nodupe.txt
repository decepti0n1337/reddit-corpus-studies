Arguably most other elites aren't good. But that's my opinion. I personally don't like the vintage looks for most of them. I'm tired of those.

Instead destroy reinforcement, it could inject toxic smoke throw wall like a SAS Smoke on attack. It could be a good option against Mira. An operator with gaz mask so

Nice

Oooooh that would be gnarly. I would nut
---
I love this so much
---
I agree with you but I do think he’s overpowered, I’m worried about this new operator because they need to be similar to Jager but not identical, kinda like Bandit, and Kaid, similar jobs but done differently. Kinda like bandit I have a feeling people will still use Jager because he’s a 3 speed with a great gun. Which is kinda what happened with bandit and Kaid, everyone still plays bandit because he’s a 3 speed with a better gun
---
Yeah because I explicitly said that rainbow was the only game that had this issue /s
---
You must have missed the line where I reminisced to a time when gamers had better decorum. Its a long post and you probably didnt read it all.
---
Fuck randoms lol. They felt pretty dumb when you did get kicked
---
This shit happens alot actually
---
I've played this game for a while and I still don't understand that gun. Is it a shotgun? Is it a DMR? Are other DMRs able to break soft wall like that gun can?
---
Idk about the rest of the community, but Echo is a default ban for me just due to the fact he can prevent the plant, and with him banned one of our 5 ops aren't picked souly to counter him. If his yokai blast didn't stop the plant I think he'd be banned alot less.
---
You throw like a gurl
---
Yeah, I never said it was a good nerf but it is a nerf. Also lion isn't op
---
it is

Teamkilled irl for being blitz
---
I thought she was black at first ngl.
---
Anyways, looks pretty good. Id get it for her.
---
Its stupid man. Monty has been a pro-league staple for many strats since they started pro league. Dont feel bad man, its them not you. Hopefully the balancing they are doing will make it less frustrating to play against them and people will warm up to them.
---
Except blitz. Fuck blitz.
---
No please
---
I don’t think it solves all the issues BUT it does give him a shit tonne more utility and more to work with. 
---
The quicker charge on his scope means he can be at max vision a lot quicker, meaning it doesn’t feel as punishing overall, which is great. 
---
The double equipment utility means he can use them both for support with the grenades being used on equipment and the smokes to cover the plant and block LoS. Or can be used both offensively if needed. 
---
The GSh-18 change means it will compete more with the PMM, which is good as the PMM is fantastic. The GSh-18 has average damage but 18 rounds and a really quick fire rate. When you add a reflex sight on it, it can become just as viable as the PMM
---
lol never played him but i play monty fuze and clash and its actually monty that gets hated on the most i just find it odd

Damn dude a real honest to go boomer on Reddit. Well I never.

It's labeled a burst shotgun but definitely has the characteristics of a DMR. 
---
And no, no DMR has the capability to murder walls like that beast can.

"Thermite tricking"
---
Lol you are going to **yell** at your teammates and give them no enemy information in a highly tactical, sound-based game? Sounds like you are probably gold or below.
---
Only time you should be opening your mouth is to communicate a teamwork strategy (i.e. ill plant cover that door), or calling out enemy locations based on a camera you are watching (not based off watching teammates screen, they can absorb all that information themselves). By yelling at them and not calling an enemy out, you make it harder for your teammate to find enemy positions
---
Be honest, the reason you say "20 seconds left you got to push" is because you just want them to suicide so you can start another round
---
You can't wait one minute in case someone needs to restart or crashed in one of the buggiest games you'll ever play? Jesus dude, talk strats or go on your phone.
---
they should just revert him at this point with minor tweaks
---
If I wanted to set something up, I wouldn’t make it a clip of me messing up.
---
Don't be naive. Ain't nobody gonna care about some 1/3 loser with a low-tier smg when we have this 3 speed guy with pure firepower as his weapon.
---
What they need to do is heavily nerf Jager's gun. Or wait until the 1/3 loser drops and butcher Jager's ADS. If they truly pick him for his utility then gun nerf won't change things. But I doubt that.
---
anyone see cav?
---
Vigil would be an exception, because using the BOSG at such distances requires incredible precision due to the damage dropoff. Goyo is a two speed with an ACOG and even then the vast majority of decent players run the Vector over the TCSG simply because high recoil DMRs suck.
---
I know :c this game gives me so much anxiety. If I don’t clutch a 1-5 I get vote kicked. If I speak I get “is that a grill!!!???!!!l” if I take someone’s kill by mistake I’ll get team killed, if I take someone’s fucking operator I’ll get team killed.
---
Idk man.

Lol..game is awesome enough to deal with the toxicness
---
Nah. Give her the mp7. I honestly feel like giving her that gun will give her far more impact. The bandit mains will love her and the gun can be used one handed which means you don't have to tweak the animation for her gadget either. Win-Win.
---

100% Knew glaz was going to be there, literally took an operator that required a lot of skill and practice and made him unplayable just because some people disliked getting killed by him right as they released a hard counter to him.

Ps4 has the same issue. I met my group of guys thag I play with daily because they told me to.kill my entire team. This was year 1 season 2 when you could kill 3 team mates with no penalty
---
You (A diamond for 4 seasons) are a retard. You can clearly see from this video how blitz is shot several time, falling onto his back shortly (implying hes been injured as he didnt just ragdoll) and then flip again once shot, which signifies his death. The first couple shots that hit before injuring were on the shield, the finishing shot placed on his shoulder bare moments after he put his shield on his back in injured position. Think for like a second dude

Thanks.
---
I thought it couldn't be much more useless than tachanka or nokk or warden. I can imagine many scenarios where attackers are pushing an objective littered with bodies when it would be beneficial to blend in and pop up when their backs are turned.
---
For sure. Her win delta is really high, but her pick rate is low. A holo could help a lot.
---
She doesn't need a buff though. Besides I doubt that gun even supports an acog irl
---
Exactly!  I get why ranked doesn't take that into account because the game requires team cooperation and I like that..buts its like you said you cant control your teammates and thus get screwed.
---
Pretty buckin good

Honestly it isn't too bad once you practice it. I put a muzzle break on it and it's a laser, even on 75 sens 50 ads

You do you boo. Sensitive people are too common nowadays and can ruin a good time. Please go as my favorite operator. Please.
---
its only for attackers
---
No hole?
---
I had the reverse of this as jager on kanal the attackers rushed me from both sides on second floor so I just lit them up it was a good time
---
Did you really do this just so I reply
---
no. the audio gets muffed by other random sounds.
---
there are times when a heavy guy is running behind you, but you can't hear him, because a twitch drone is zapping a battery near you.
---
the game cancels some sounds randomly. you can see on the video that the hibana pallets never did a sound, because jagger was getting hit in the other room.
---
I have had and still have a stable connection, and no other games crash other than a few times when i do stupid shit in them. I'm going to try to reinstall to see if your correct tho.
---
Fuze idea: make him able to attach cluster on hostages body.
---
Classic siege timing. I think it’s just something you have to adjust to depending on the situation. Like if you know where the last guy is coming from them then keep holding the angle, but if you don’t know then look for only a little bit then hold a different angle.
---
At this point I think only time will tell since it sounds like Ubi is waiting for more data especially from Pro plays and such. 
---
The least Ubi buff would be something like just slightly longer gadget duration again like last time if Ubi ends up deciding that Nokk doesn’t need much more from her current state.
---
Of course, very slight damage buff to FMG or giving her different secondary gadgets is a viable choices as well.
---
That’s gotta be an F from me
---
First change maybe second would make him even worse. Imagine how annoying that would be to play as.
---
Would you know how to update said drivers, i'm quite new to the world of pc
---
Not again...
---
All the sounds are in the clips. You just don't know what to listen for. The sounds are layered, as all sounds will be in everything.
---
[removed]
---
Update. There’s a degradation going on currently which explains it.
---
Something like Driver Booster should do the trick. It's a free application that automatically scans your drivers and scans the internet for updates
---
Bro how do yall show ur main?
---
What rank?
---
Honestly I think Secure Area is probably the most competitive the game can get. It’s impossible to stealth-win, you can’t plant the defuser and then camp outside the map, you’ve got to kill 100% of enemies (unless they’re idiots and don’t defend) and imo it’s the best mode to learn defending on
---
Nope
---
How do people not know this occurs? This has been in so many videos since his release
---
About 2-3 games into a session, my connection just goes off a cliff and people start hopping around like 2m at a time. The next match it's fine, and it does this every few games. It's the only reason I avoid ranked.
---
I didn’t even think about it lmao
---
they might not even do anything to her if she continues to do well in pro league and gets picked more.
---
Yep
---

Gridlock is 102kg. Assuming that's all/mostly muscle. Gridlock with one underhanded throw can launch her trax stingers of 30-60kg nearly 30metres in game. Which is 7metres over the world record for shotputting a shotput of 7kg. The world record was accomplished by a 132kg man named Randy Barnes. 
---
The average force of impact by a 7k shotput launched by a 123kg man(+/-14kg) is 512 newtons.   Assuming similar velocity this would put the force of Gridlocks trax stinger impact at 2000-4000Newtons. The impact force of a bullet is about 304Newtons. Gridlock with her underhanded throw can: 
---
1. Break through and shatter any bone in the human body completely. 
---
2. Break through concrete.
---
3. Crack diamond. 
---
4. Liquidize almost every internal organ upon impact.

You’re reading way too much into this comment. I’m just saying Cav is not a hard counter since Jackal still gets to do all his Jackal things to everyone else and they have no control over it at all.
---
Cav only counters Jackal for herself. Other counters in this game largely provide some protection to their allies, not just themselves. Claiming Cav hard counters Jackal is just ignoring the fact he’s still gonna mess with everyone else with literally zero effect from the Cav.
---
Nah man you do you. Cosplay the hell outta Hibana!
---
Anyone know when Spooky Siege comes out?
---
Looks cute to me ^~^
---
Tachanka is genuinely terrifying in ranked.
---
*best gun in the game
---
not even that just play iq, thatcher, twitch. if they never made her drones hard to see with your bare eye echo would almost even be banned honestly. it used to be very easy to see his drones if in a bad spot. but it’s easy to see on drones
---
Cool cool I thought so didn't know if anyone noticed or had seen this before.

What would make him more viable? AS Val...  
---
20 rounds, subsonic ammo, full auto with his flip sight.  
---
It can certainly be balanced with lower dmg than his SVU, no barrel extension and possibly no grip.  
---
This would essentialy make people chose between long range sniper or CQB rifle with low ammo count per mag.  
---
Also possibly make the dmg drop for Val less severe as these are already subsonic and supposedly punch through armour really well.
---
I’m confused

There's no place for a "sniper" in this game. Glaz is fundamentally fucked as an operator and would require a complete redesign to fit into any squad. RIP Glaz
---
Pardon the phone editing toolbar and big play button in the center, but I looked at it frame by frame on my phone and got this capture. Notice the HUD still active, but the enemy team operator icons grayed out (kills registered). http://imgur.com/a/5aiilj1
---
Punish him
---
Jager needs a comparable op.
---
A Hibana/Maverick to his Thermite. A Bandit/Kaid to his Mute.
---
Right now he exists as the only operator in a very valuable role. 
---
He's also from a stupid design era where they thought 3-speeds needed better guns because they waaaaay overvalued armor in testing.
---
Exactly. the gun itself is uncontested.
---
Your feedback was “I’m curious. Did you actually think this was funny?” So thank you for that feedback, it helped me a lot.

Yeah if theres a strat it's okay but people who block every entry point with a castle barricade need to go back to kindergarten
---
That's facts man
---
Love that the tcsg 12 has an acog, it has 11 mag fed rounds, and almost no recoil compared to the bosg. and still, they don't give our man the acog.
---
It's not high recoil DMR, it's a long range shotgun.
---

Hmm, I'll check it

Ghost Recon Breakpoint
---
I absolutely love this idea
---
Mhm
---
It's possible that the sens is too low, but it's controllable at a much lower level than people would think, you just need enough real estate (mouse pad size).
---
Yare Yare!
---
Yeah, Ak-12 is the best and there's a tie between the R4-C, F2 and C7E for second place. C7E needs more recoil honestly. When you don't have any challenging recoil on a gun with angled equipped, that's a problem.
---
as a Plat 3 player I find that inaccurate
---
I'm fucking glad none of the commenters do game balancing. Godsakes, C7E, PDW, F2??? FOR NØKK? You'll be the next goofballs autobanning her because she's not fun to play against.
---
Some guy accused me of hacking (on console) for throwing a grenade into the corner of room he was in even though I naded the only other corner I couldnt see first lol
---
You were flashed so you put your hands up but since the goyo shield was in the way, the hand moved up higher. This is actually some pretty smart animation handling but triggering in game.
---
Was playing with a buddy of mine a few seasons ago and he got accused of having a mod because they couldn't understand he just has a quick finger (He was running Dokk). It was pretty damn funny.
---
They won't buff FMG9. It's a very good defender gun.
---
I prefer the c7e over the r4c and ak12 because:
---
a) basically no recoil
---
b) very fast reload
---
c) higher base damage than both
---
bro im tellin you, if you like that shotgun then run it on jäger and you’ll do better.
---

no

#BOSGACOG 4EVER

Starting to be big glaz main (playing plats), a lot of what it takes is patience and skill (what I mean is hitting the head on the first shot), very similar to how real snipers do it, glaz isn’t designed to be  a big rusher, he’s designed to play the angles, his best suit is when defusers down and sights covered in smoke, he can rappel outside or prone in a corner or in the smoke, hell he doesn’t even need to be in sight originally, he makes a really good gun for cover with his thermal and even without thermal he has access to Russian optics which (in my opinion) are the best in the game, it all boils down to how you play but if you can be patient and have the skills to hit the first shot he’s an insanely good op
---
Assuming you could lay down a thermite charge on a barricaded door, it's pointless since the thermite pre-cast (the thing it does before destroying the door) gives defenders enough time to respond and just destroy the thermite charge from the other side by shooting the barricaded door. You've just given away your position and now you have to melee the door to get in while they hold an angle on you.
---
No one on this subreddit knows shit about game balance
---
YES!!
---
nah her clown hair would be stickin out and get her killed.
---
It sound like a cool idea but how would it work? I’m just thinking because sieve is a more realistic shooter. Would they work as Vigil and like as soon as they got shot or they shoot they turn into the regular person they are?
---
i castled one door into objective earlier (horrible, i know) and specifically left the other (less used) one open so my team could run out and they tk'd me and tore it down...
---
I am sorry to inform you but a player always gets what he deserves when he plays alot. If you can't hold your own in gold over 100 matches you probably don't deserve to be there. Dropping into a lower rank for a while can happen but if you were a gold player you would just climb again

---
Guess that's my 40$ and 100s of hours down the drain. Would've been nice if they wouldve communicated this, Idk maybe at the start of the damn season. Getting wet fart of operators each season that dont do much as touch the meta. Somthing has had to have happened by the end of season 2. Since then, weapons reuse and underwealming operators. I've heard its since resources were shifted to Breakpoint and we all know what a let down that's been. With MW coming, those operators better be damn game-breaking for me to play like I used to. Ranked used to have new variations each season come, if not the operators, the maps, if not maps operator reworks. Now, other than Goyo being decent at best, doesnt really bring much to changing the Meta, sure he is fun to play but, he is no maestro or vigil. I've been playing this game non stop for 3 years straight, and for the first time I'm unmotivated to play. So if a diehard fan like me is unmotivated, what of the casuals?
---
Meanwhile jager is picked so much he isn’t even on the image

I agree wholeheartedly, but the second I see a Rook reinforce a wall before throwing down those T-shirts, I'm destroying his entire existence.

great another shit operator idea! thanks op!

Oh no sir. You could throw smokes onto site, crouch walk in and gun an entire team before they were aware of what was happening.

He was situational kinda. But in those situations he faired with some of the best operators in the game because after all, you can’t shoot what you can’t see, no matter the firerate

Hmm okay, are we still due for any more operators for year 4 or are we finished with them for the year?
---
you’re going to tk room for reinforcing before putting down his armor you realize how retarded that makes you look.
---
It was in the feed I think
---
Yuri Tarded
---
Echo's not actually OP, he's just the most reliable camera operator in the game. He's not picked that often and he doesn't perform that well, it's just that *everyone* bans him for some reason
---
Funny thing is I think thats Blitz since one of the concept arts for his elite skin shows the exact same face.
---
Thats why the recruit is so underated
---
Except the batteries in this one dont wiggle out when he moves too fast.
---
Thats a good thing?
---
Found the TK'er.
---
All they gotta do is give Warden the 416-C
---
When asked why, I've never gotten a negative response from my other teammates. So no, I'm usually among the people yelling at him to drop em.
---
Sadly no, It hurts to see idiots give ideas.
---
2nd to last one is bullshit mate. If you're reinforcing near Mira's without clarification you're a cock end
---
Yeah usually you can't put traps around where people would stop and look for traps, sothe objective is absolutely not good for kapkan unless you can hide the mines behind a shield or next to a wall that doesn't allow them to look at the side of the door before entering. Which they would inevitably break regardless
---
i don’t tk people lmao. and i don’t really see people tk on purpose.

Ew fuze shield
---
but mind you it’s a slug
---
but mind you its a slug
---
Seriously? You lay down. That's your special gadget?
---
5v10
---
Yes but his pick rate went down a lot.
---
I love it
---
You could do it that they can only do it if their below 50 hp so it might seeem like they killed you
---
Can any one else agree with me that there isn’t anything special about this. It’s kaids gun with 2 bullets
---
I mainly play in a passive way i drone evething and prefire when i need to i use ever inch of the map to get holes or angles as well as make good calls . I have a shakey aim but i usually go for broke by all ways aiming for the head most of the times one of the bullets hits target cuz i know i cant afford to aim at body level in plat .
---
Thank you
---
416 is Great to infact it's even a AR
---
I was a former Monty main but after the pointless nerfs and buggy shield hit boxes I have moved on
---
We can only wish
---
Hot
---
Couldnt think of a good name tho
---
Thatd be lit
---
give him his old scope back where he doesn’t have to stand still for a century to use his fucking ability
---
Whitecastle, even..?
---
No pls
---
Almost accidentally wrote that XD
---
This.
---
This is 10x worse when you ask the team "does anyone care if this door is barricaded?" Yet 2 seconds later someone comes barging through.
---
I wouldn’t have to tear them down if Castle quit barricading all of the doors into obj and not leaving any lanes for rotation. 
---
Especially if it’s in prep phase. Like wtf man.
---
I'd be happy with either option, both are fairly well balanced
---
What if they made his gadget so it had limited uses, but upon use it scans a wall once and reveals the enemies positions only on the other side of the wall for 1 second or so. With delays of this gadget use, it may work? Idk. I'm truly just throwing ideas out there.
---
See I dont think glaz is totally Borked. He definitely isnt in a good place but a low pick percentage means people cottoned on to his weakness quick. 
---
His pick rate is super low and he's lost most of those rounds. A good proportion of that might have been people who came back not realising he'd been changed. It was a significant change and has fundamentally changed his play style pushing into his intended role the overwatch long engagement OP.
---
Problem is that long range engagements and opportunities are few and far between. It's a surprise that the Lord has seen an up swing in wins.
---
Uhhh... you do realize that Siege's focus is not fragging, but tactical gameplay with the use of its unique gadgets, right?
---
You better get moar upvotes
---
“Chromatic” “Pure Ice” and “Black Ice” almost look identical
---
Oh god that IQ had me laughing my ass off. Literally bursting the same clone over and over wondering why it's not dying.
---
Every shot on the forehead as well with not a single miss and you'd still do fucking nothing
---
That shouldn't matter. There's 10x the amount of console players for this game than PC. You'd think they'd want data across all platforms
---
I think trap ops are very situational. They only get picked on maps that work best with traps. They rarely get picked but those who choose them already know where to place the traps making them very effective.
---
I hope they give her the Galil she had in playtest
---
Run a Holo or Reflex on Buck. It is still the same recoil, but the screen shakes a lot less and the sights are better for tracking. You will lose some angle holding advantage, but be less thrown off by the recoil. It will also feel a lot less like the SMG-11 in that case
---
you play t-hunt enough that your aim and flicks are good. if you need to change your sensitivity, change it.
---
Literally anyone can attach a car battery and some jumper cables to a metal surface too.
---
Yel that is castle
---
Youtube link?
---
Spy in Team Fortress Classic had this. It was fun.
---
Rework castle not tachankA
---
Nasty ass Steelers fan
---
If you're letting the enemy get 12 punches off on your castle baricades you're doing something wrong
---
It’s not like he was lion level overpowered. I’d rather have a slightly overpowered operator rather than a completely useless one.
---
Just below the button that says "create post" there's a dropdown menu called "community options", open that then click the pencil next to "user flair preview" to select your flair :)
---
No just no
---
honestly that would be something id like to see
---
In Wildlands there is a drone which can be blown up, I'm fine with this idea
---
#bosgacog
---
Just make his gun sway a little everytime before it can zoom from 3-6 times.
---
Bronze 2 and Copper 4 aren’t that much apart in skill 😂
---
Yet everyone judges you by K/D.
---
No you cant have it also we are nefing your gadget
---
Why should you be grand champion?
---
calm down sport, no need to be overly negative, go make some friends or something mate, its a small change that wouldnt change the base game. its a feature that almost all games with dbno have
---
Similar to what I was thinking: an invisible line around the building once glaz gets too close you lose the thermal or just limit it to only outdoors.
---
Keeps him closer to his original intention.
---
Apex Legends has a rare item that lets you self-revive when downed (only once, though, then the item degrades). I'm pretty sure I remember one of the devs saying they played Siege and loved getting clutch wins with Zofia's passive, that's probably where the inspiration comes from!
---
yep, that's exactly how it should be
---
your experience is very different from mine. 5 randoms vs a 5 stack of friends in ranked or unranked isnt balanced matchmaking. its lazy matchmaking.
---
Here in sweden we have clean water coming from our taps.

Goyo has awesome weapons and passive gadget which you place early in the round and then you are free to play the way you want.

---
Nigga have you ever solo q’d
---
Its a dmr ubi lied to us
---
its a joke man, i just play for fun but a lot of people say they should be higher rank but cant because of "bad teammates"
---
I'd change Doc and Ash. Really bad elites.
---
that’s all i do
---
&gt; I think Ela is ok because her gadgets don’t directly kill you
---
no trap in the game directly kills you.. if you're stupid enough to trigger multiple Kapkan traps you probably deserve to be killed by them
---
Once I stayed 59:16 to play a casual
---
it's utterly irrelevant
---
Check Iceycat's video on YouTube. He made a showcase of this skin some time ago 😀
---
The ops will be Indian and Kenyan, and it comes with a Theme Park rework indeed
---
it downs no matter what.
---
once i was tked randomly, and started a vote kick. (they were all randoms, no squad rff.) i proceeded to be kicked.
---
Nice.
---
mate why are you so angry, lets talk about it. is something going wrong at school? are you being picked on or failing?
---
Has one of the most annoying gadgets in the game? Check
---
Punishes BASIC thing you need to do as defender? Check
---
One of the best weapons in the game? Check
---
sounds like he needs a nerf to me, also the nerf he got sounds very reasonable
---
i can agree with you there ive sat quietly off site no sounds and suddenly i die from big man fuze running at me knifing me without sound like eh
---
On console
---
Happened to me as well. Spend the whole prep phase attempting to kill my friends
---
Last line 🤣
---
Black ice looks dope in genral
---
Finka is pretty useless, Goyo is a double edged sword. Gridlock is great for covering flanks, secondary shotgun for vertical play, smoke grenade to cover a plant. Kaid is good for hatches, and walls but if you are not good at Bandit tricking then Kaid tricking is even harder. i think Gridlock is the more easier operator to use than Kaid, and more uses for her. Kaid is more complicated to use, niche in a way because people only bring him if there is a hatch to worry about otherwise you would just bring Bandit. i think getting Gridlock is probably the smartest option.
---
You're reading a lot that simply isn't there...
---
It's simple, the person who kills them gets the kill, if you down someone and a team mate kills them then you didn't kill them. There is no problem here.
---
This would make him only viable for a handful of maps. I get every operator should have their moments but they should always be viable.
---
is it your parents? is something going on buddy?
---
I see it.
---
That toxic vote to kick though
---
but the person who downs did all the work?
---
I'm just imagining a bloody battlefield. Pile of bodies scattered around. The enemies rush through the field and disappear in the distance. Suddenly one of the bodies gets us, dusts off his pants, and starts walking away whistling.
---
I now want this operator solely for that video.
---
Thankksssss
---
If you take them down he actually gets them back so it doesn't even matter if you do. I feel like most people don't realize this though.
---

**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**

Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.

This idea is...not that good I’m sorry
---
It's just a place holder I didn't feel like drawing is back lol
---
This I agree.
---
Not to mention if FMG buff is not enough to surpass the SMG 11, Smoke mains will not FMG over the standard Shotgun/SMG combo
---
Acog or the scope that's on the lmgs
---
I really like this series of drawings
---
Also playing on one of those weird Chinese 170million Hertz refresh rate monitors, lol
---
Ah yeah when the Ubisoft nerf him too hard...
---
Me, Glaz main. I got to say I got a FULL-FORCE, DIRECT HIT from the hammer...
---
brah.
---
That’s how your supposed to talk in real life
---
Where is here
---
Even less in Pro League. The FMG-9 is never seen on Smoke
---
also like 5000 rtx 2080's
---
They’re speaking the language of the gods.
---
Thats what they call an outstanding move
---
*goes up to the door to put another panel on*
---
*gets shot*
---
joke isn't funny shut up already
---
If they scan him they will know what he can do and shoot the body and it will show who he is in the corner when they scan him and the would be a red x on him so this op sucks
---
Love them! Sooo much! Even made cosplay-replay scene :Ь
---
Yeah true, but detail doesn't mean quality. That's the whole reasoning with minimalist art even existing, it's supposed to lack details to let the mind fill in the gaps
---
I’ve been online gaming for decades; the biggest insult was being knifed in a gun fight or being tea bagged. Maybe vulgar sprays. If you encountered real toxicity, it was the rarity.
---
This whole thing is in the context of casual, "people not being good enough to play properly" is kind of a given...
---
No
---
Maybe its just how rare it is. Its like an elite skin, not everyone has it and you can flex with it
---
I see that now, I'm assuming they were probably in a discord call or something.
---
Which still doesn't change the facts
---
secondary gadget: shoots frost traps from skeleton key
---
Just bring IQ there's a already a counter for it dude its like going to breach but not bringing thatcher, its like, stupid
---
Why would I get muted and is this perm
---
basically
---
Now that's an old-school reference
---
Of course she doesn't but she would be way more picked if she had. No one needs an acog, but it is always good to have.
---
Whoever was the one who told you in voice to reinforce the wall was in on it as well
---
The M1014, Saiga, and DBV-12 with slight and an ACOG would like a word with you. Oh and don’t forget the M16 with a heavy barrel, bipod and ACOG.
---
Yeah lmao he was the goyo
---
That's you and me. What about majority of the ranked players above gold? They'll just take out maps they simply don't want. That's not good. Queue times will sky rocket. Even at gold, queue times are 2 minutes plus. Imagine diamond, where people will now only play 5 or 6 maps. Goners.
---
And motion blur.
---
Now make a Thermite + Buck = Thermuck or Buckite.
---
I read it as that anyway, had to go back and check &amp; I don't know if I'm disappointed with the name or just with me
---
Please don’t say this will be the brawl stars brawler combination all over again
---
They never changed the MPX

Hello CarbonBoiler, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dlgd5b/finka_red/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Idk just thought that being muted would explain on rainbow not working

It looks weird because it is 4:3 aspect ratio

Spooky scary vision, the scorpion shivers your spine!

So... does it have a peepee or a puss puss
---
Asking for a friend
---
I agree. Games better without him but we can’t have that unfortunately
---
I don't believe she necessarily does tbh. I was just playing consulate earlier and was winning rounds cuz I hurled my cams well outside the building and had eyes on them the whole time and it dawned on me that they're extremely difficult to spot without the one and only IQ. And if teammates aren't pinging attackers then you might not know they're around at all. Like yokais and mozzie drones get deactivated if they stay outside but valkyrie doesn't so it just got me thinking. Wanted more opinions on the thought that's all
---
No. You shouldn't profit from someone cheating, just like you shouldn't profit from cheating yourself.
---
He is supposed to make choke points harder to get through and make choke points harder and reduce flanks. I've played in a few tournaments for credits and all of that, each time the enemy was on defense there was a castle. No one can play him correctly.
---
Any monitor with 1ms and 60 FPS will do, if you play close to the screen (on a desk) a 4k/1080p TN 27" monitor will do, I would recommend a 144Hz screen anyways, just because the Next Xbox releasing next year will be able to display most games at 144 FPS.
---
I can recommend the [ASUS VG278Q](https://www.asus.com/de/Monitors/VG278Q/) it supports Free-Sync and G-Sync in case you want to buy a PC sometimes, it has a great panel and is available for a good price.
---
If you wish play on a TV, get a look at the LG SK or the newer UK S-UHD Nano Cell series (55" costs around 1200€), they are "designed for gaming" with just 4ms, and 120 Hz at 1080p and all the Fancy HDR features compatible with Xbox One S and X.
---
I agree, i was thinking maybe some sort of motion detecter that you could throw onto a wall. Making it harder for those pesky roamers to get to operators that aren’t great at defending themselves.
---
From my personal experience, unranked playlist was worse experience than casual. But on the other hand, I played it only solo and people absolutely do not communicate and basically do just random shit out of boredom
---
Hey, hey, it's alright.
---
We all do it sometimes.

Ombamba

I think that's less on the Castle and more on the Roamer. If you know one of the approaches is effectively stopped, you have access to valuable information.

hey, this is not abt me being intelligent or u getting angry :D for no reason. the man asked a question. i gave a simple answer, which is right as per the game. if its not true, giv him whatever from the books or etchings u found. Jus stop showing ur insecurities towards some randoms in reddit. :D
---
I couldn’t find jäger and then I looked to my right lmao
---
They took his claymore away, because it left him being such a good operator and anchoring an angle. So they needed something to replace that, and in my opinon frags were a pretty good option.
---
Or proximity chat
---
Doc is like 43-ish% presence? I see Docs running around every game lol.
---
Atleast im not getting brainwashed on a daily basis.

Sweden is better than israel, dont deny it.

You get welfare from every country in the world to be able to afford food. The reason why falafel is famous in israel is because its made out of all the cheap vegan stuff u can find.

Damnit you beat me to it

It does seem dumb to get punished for someone else's actions, but what happens when you start getting matched with people way above your actual skill level?
---
I preferred fuck.. the fuze and buck combo.. 8/10 ign
---
*in the distance*
---
MY FUCKING LEG!
---
Plenty of people can play him correctly, I'm gonna say it's about playing with him that's difficult. When you have a Castle you essentially need to re-evaluate how you move around the map because his barricades will prevent an approach. If they do make that approach, it'll either be time-consuming or resource-intensive, and definitely noticeable.
---
touché
---
Facts dude
---
Giving an operator an acog wont make any operator viable. Sledge isn't suddenly not viable if u dont play acog on him, there are almost no operators like this. The only exceptions are operators that have designated roles to hold angles such as Blackbeard, if you take his acog away he loses a lot of power. 
---
Give Nøkk an actual fucking gun like an AR, that has an inbuilt supressor so she has to be respected properly rather than glossed over whenever she's picked.
---
I want to see Nøkk and immediately think "okay so we have to hold pixel angles out of site cus we cannot rely on cams, otherwise she will fuck us" Not just ignore the fact that she exists. She needs a bigger presence with her gadget and having a better gun compliments that.
---
Looks great!
---
Isn’t Warden kind of a grenade denial operator? (hes pretty shit at it though)
---
*reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*
---
Congratulations you've been muted by all the players
---
He said "that can be used with an xbox", implying that he will use for the xbox as well. So his question about the pc specs is appropriate.
---
Yeah😂😂
---
Keep in mind this is plat 3+ on PC only
---
Whats it called?
---
Did he yell "CHANK-KAAAAA"?
---
Ive seen this happen, idk why tho
---
Same
---
Mby the spoky event is coming In I hope so
---
Maybe don't say that you're gonna get a pc then???? Now you're making it sound like you're gonna get two monitors: one for pc and one for console.
---
Despite your horrible title, I'll help you.
---
Get a monitor that has low response time. It's not that expensive to get 1ms 1080p monitors.
---
Since you're on xbox, forget about 144hz, and stick to 60hz, your console can't run the game at 144 frames. 
---
IPS panels are nice for color accuracy and wider viewing angles. What does this mean? You can lay down on your couch and still see the monitor. TN panels are inferior.
---
I need the purple ice. 
---
I NEED THE PURPLE

---
I'm not OP, i thought you didnt read the title, then I didnt read the title xD
---
Alright Marley calm down
---
I like how people are saying “smurf” it makes no difference if these was copper or diamond if your whole team leaves Site to go for the last kill this will prolly happen lol.
---
Met this lad last night, just preaimed through walls all the fucking time. Almost bamboozled him with clash, but I didn't channel bikinibodhi enough.
---
could make it so her gadget recharges very slowly if she's standing still while it's on. That way she can stay invisible to cams even if she's recharing her gadget
---
Ela: Please! remove weapon recoil!
---
Thanks dude
---
*frost's eyes begin to glow as she b-lines toward her victim.*
---
How do people do this crap? I mean I have my moments, but that’s when I manage to kill 2 people.
---
Yeah, different perspectives I guess. Docs are everywhere in my games, but Jager, well... you gotta force them to play him.
---
Good!
---
It’s because you are down
---
Out of those, Lion and Nokk are pretty underwhelming compared to the others.
---
Atleast our history books tells the truth and people like us might be the reason for the holocaust but people like you and other brainwashed children will be the reason for it to happen again. Look at palestine, they created israel still you send missiles at their schools thinking its revenge

Not gonna be a buff to the FMG9, as that would be a buff to smoke as well.
---
He's fine. In the last hotbreach podcast the developers acknowledged they know it's because of his unique role
---
Fuck.
---
Why do people on this sub only play console
---
suck a dick
---
There we go! 1994 represent
---
I agree with you. Castle is an operator that requires strategy and tactics, and thats is better achieved with 3+ stack. A solo castle can fuck up the way that every other player in the team plays. Even with those "standard" castle placements. That's why a lot of ppl don't see him too often, and underestimate his gadget.
---
Castle is strong if used well, and can be stronger or weaker depending on the bomb site/map.
---
&gt; mostly '*psa*' *mean* 'public service announcement'
---
Then look at your own history books.
---
 we send airstrikes to hamas hideouts and at their leaders, hamas is just blind shooting hoping to hit civilians
---
I would seriously recommend giving it a proper try. Just keep in mind that it does have one of the largest learning curves I've ever experienced in a game. It takes a lot of practice. People will tell you that the community is hyper toxic, and they are not completely wrong. However, if you play with friends, you can have a hell of a good time. I wouldn't personally recommend Ranked either until you're level 70 or above. If you are solo-queuing in ranked, you are much more likely to find the toxicity people are warning you about.  
---
It seriously is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Just keep in mind that it is also one of the most difficult.
---
So yall telling me yall never read the details where it says you get all dlc ops and base ops have to be purchased?
---
dont you mean FUCK and not Fruck
---
He got one tapped through his shield...
---
That'd make one hell of a jack-o'-lantern!!!
---
As I asked, you want him to lose that case?
---
Grenade main wasn't sounding as good in a batman begins wordplay
---
I agree with you but you’re being a huge dick.
---
I used to do that when I was new. Never realized how fucking stupid it is untill I learned.
---
There’s an r tho
---
That's the timing for you.  If you want to avoid this, use your drone more. Like, all the dang time.
---
I took the default black ice, cropped the parts that had black ice onto a new layer, and cut out the pieces inside the gun that were holes like on the stock. Cropped the charm and put it over the black ice layer so it wouldnt change color, then messed around with the hue and sat on the black ice layer and did that liek 12 times, only these made it to the post. I have a few im working on rn that took actual big boi creativity
---
Attacker or Defender?
---
What if instead of it covering the whole door it creates another door so it’s a door inside of the door and the only way to enter is to knock 3 times and someone can let you in.
---
Great. Now I’m never gonna be able to bandit trick snowmobile without a jager
---
Attacker
---
Brost and Fuck
---
It usually happens to me on defence like I will be peaking a door for a while then switch to a window and get headshot
---
First things first:  
---
Try restarting your computer
---
Log out of Uplay, then Log back in
---
99% of the time this is what fixes it for me. Uplay is very very picky about when and how it wants to work.
---
It would
---
It would do more damage than Glaz's rifle, combine that with his gadget and he'd be busted as fuck.
---
Dont ever buff blitz
---
Thanks for your suggestions it really means a lot!
---
Gridlock has alot of utilities to use, shotgun for hatches, smoke to for planting/covering and her gadget to slow down flanking
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Kaid's gadget is really useful and his shotgun in places like oregon map is really scary
---
When it's been a while since your last match and you press G instead of mouse wheel (done it myself a couple times)
---
Yeah but then you'd expect his win rate to be busted, which isn't the case.
---
the team kill was on attackers side tho.
---
I know, but they made it cringy.
---
Plane :)
---
I would pay actual money to have these.
---
people are excited for new warden and I'm jist sitting here hoping its the Halloween event already
---
Should have just called him *Fuck*
---
It was rotated per month not season
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Oo they gave her the realistic mag size for that magazine
---
I’m guessing it’s going to look into everyone’s account, and if they see that you are a way different rank then last season, you’ll probably have to redo your placements.
---
I’m pretty sure they are doing this because of the excessive amount of DDOSING this season.
---
With impact rook can open a good angle
---
Is this the first transgender Operator?
---
This is awesome. Would make a great pumpkin design. I wonder who else you could do?
---
It likely reset.  Make sure it hasn’t.  If not, restart your game after swapping back to standard, then go back to advanced.
---
Yeah ill make more any operators in mind
---
Either you weren't paying attention or you weren't playing against an average or above glaz player at the time. He was absolutely busted.
---
Don't forget that when they first reworked him, everyone who had smoke grenades had 3 of them, and a lot of the most popular ops had them.
---
He was an entry fragger, 100% of the way. That's how he was used in pro league, comp play in general, and high level ranked.
---
Such low dps, throw a Blackbeard at her and I just don't see how she wins. She isn't bad, throwing double mats on a window is a nasty strat that can really stop a rush, but in a gun fight I don't love her
---
Nice job dude
---
said noone ever
---
Well, will take these weapons into account for my next 2 operators :v was planning to have a medic for attacker, but no idea for defender yet
---
Unfortunately yeh lol
---
You act like this "nerf" is gonna do anything 😂
---
&gt;&gt;Also Buck’s gun is not anywhere near the recoil of the SMG-11.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I'm gonna have to disagree on that one.
---
Well it's not really up for debate lol, it simply is a fact that Bucks gun has significantly less recoil than the SMG-11, on paper and in practice.
---
Where do you find this, like what website
---
&gt;MPX
---
No choice there. You HAVE to use it. It ain't underrated.
---
&gt;SIX12/SIX12SD
---
Tbf they are pretty bad. Only advantage they have other other shottys is that they are a *tad* bit more consistent, but pumps still best this.
---
&gt;Spear .308
---
Pretty shite if you ask me, statistically. 6p41 better in every way, especially after the global ads times buff this season.
---
&gt;P90
---
Deserves to be the symbol of trash.
---
&gt;Q-929
---
&gt;P-10 Roni
---
No it is reasonably picked. Despite it's pea damage and pea size mag, it still has a 33% pick rate. It's ok. Not underrated. Headshot machine.
---
Hahaha nah won’t make a difference and decent players don’t need 30 bullets anyway, just a shame really
---
The dude was using Twitch tho so even a Jager would've been kinda helpless
---
My friend calls warden the most useless operator in the game, is this true or just this opinion?
---
I mean yeah that's the whole point to BB. Each operator has a unique ability and his is peeking. If you see him don't peek him, simple as that. His pick rate is not even that high, which means that he's totally situational. 
---
They're not going to remove him so instead they're trying their best to balance him out. Fundamentally he might be broken, but he's still a decent operator. 
---
As of right now, I'm fine with the amount of time it takes to kill him. It wasn't as bad at it was before, but it's more manageable now.
---
Rewire thermal scope backwards.
---
Only highlight enemies when **they** move, intensity depends on how much/ how fast. Sight is dark and obtrusive normally, making still enemies difficult to see.
---
Glaz now has advantage on quick-peeking roamers and is garbage against angle-holding anchors.
---
Makes him a good fragger in a dynamic team that can help him keep defenders on the move.
---
Sucks to be alone, as enemies can just an angle and only move when they're droned.
---
Also sucks to be aggressive and push site, unless enemies are blindly rotating.
---
Damn straightb
---
You don't get it with any version anymore. They are progression paid now. You have to earn them in all editions.
---
You can now get Hibana before Thermite, or buck before sledge.
---
After several rounds of fucking around as castle I can confirm that if they tear it down castle magically gets it back. It's only if its punched or exploded to death that its gone
---
always get EMP'd off anyway
---
I've given up trying to trick that spot in Ranked, everyone and their mother already knows how to fuck Bandit up now.
---
Shoot frost mats😂
---
Oh shrit oh fruck
---
Once out, it's out for both teams.
---
Modern day spartan
---
Nah fam #BOSGSCOPE
---
Really? Huh.
---
Awesome job, future pro leaguer!
---
Yep.
---
Sad glaz moments
---
I agree but for Doc?! Use MP5, yeah P90 is a great fun but MP5 is better.
---
Best maps in the game
---
Oh I get that. Just giving an analogy.
---
I added that gridlock part later. Throwables aren't considered as projectiles to be taken out by ADS, I believe.
---
It was during placements so I wasn’t really matched with plat players but my name is pizzatime253 on Xbox
---
Definitely agree with the MPX and the P90 being under rated. I love valk's gun and when I play rook in always grabbing that P90 hehe 😁. 
---
The MPX is easily one of my favourite guns tho.
---
they aren't in the rotation of this season. probably removed to prepare the halloween event
---
Well, I wish you good luck with your ideas. If I see them, I will read them :)
---
Yeah, no. That's what I said: Double-Barrel shotgun
---
1.040 GB
---
They'll probably cut down the duration pings stay for in their next attempt if his frustration and/or ban data don't drop.
---
Lol.imagine letting a four year old play a game he can even read...
---
How did it blow up did goyo shoot the canister?
---
How cute.
---
Making a shotgun extra shotier.
---
A stock drone? Are the attackers trying to get in to a business meeting?
---
Hopefully this "nerf" is a catalyst for future nerfs, the gun is just way to easy to use and mixing that with the shock drone makes Twitch too good.
---
Nope. No news.
---
Well I was expect more people to give their views on my first ideas but eh, I have to start somewhere right?
---
Valkyrie is awesome. Can't go wrong with frost either. I would say Mira but she's banned all the time. Vigil and mozzie would be good choices too.
---
There's still 14 maps in the casual map pool
---
*her*
---
I didnt know the animation was that good
---
The only, and legit only, reason he has such a high kd is because he is so essential to defense that he is picked in almost every game, meaning you have such repetitive kd data ranging from 0.5 to 2.5. when you have 90% presence with almost no ban, you tend to have data that points upwards. And considering that it is plat and diamond where people almost never potato, a high kd isn't abnormal or a rare sight.
---
A Nerf to any aspect of an op is a nerd regardless, so essentially, this is a nerd to the only anti-projectile op in the game. That's uncalled for.
---
Yeah it’s kinda strange. Not to say it’s bad, OP, but I just don’t understand why waste the time unless it’s some godly artwork like that Maverick comic meme yesterday.
---
Pretty much and then pray they dont bitch about it to parents
---
They said it could not be done...
---
A bug.
---
Wish I could do that.
---
Sadly, i work at night.
---
Blackbeard ela and lion were OP for weeks. Lion didnt get nerfed until the next operation, blackbeard was incredibly busted for a long ass time, and ela was relatively op until the end of white noise.
---
Actually they are technically fixed now: Ela is using 20 round magazines with 20 round extenders, for a total of 40 rounds, with a 50 magazine looking like [this](https://czcustom.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/600x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/s/c/scorpion_extender_dsc1940smalllogo.jpg). Ironically it was actually wrong when they released her and then they "fixed" it by nerfing her gun, similar to what's happening with Twitch's F2 soon.
---
Thank God it's tomorrow when I have nothing to do
---
Maybe when he plays dead, he disguises himself as other players.
---
Usually, but only other multiplayer game I play on console has no knife and joystick is crouch.
---
I think they should, they’ve shown that it can be done for the op customization menu. I think it’d be neat to see my team’s gear
---
+ Most pros and majority of the ranked community.
---
Ubisoft.com
---
I never thought of using nomad as anti bandit trick
---
It's thunt i know but happened the same so many times :(
---
His ADS speed is still slower than your average AR, but it's definitely faster than Blackbeard was last season.
---
It looks kinda hilarious tbh
---
Most guys on 4:3 run 1x sights only and prefer the consistent movement speed as opposed to switching the feel between acog/holo. Same reason guys lock hipfire movement to ads, consistent aim helps a ton.
---
I run it on carbines. 416, c8, r4 (not often use), l85 (bullpop), 552, Aug, and a few others where it looks HELLA GOLD.
---
But yeah, the Platinum skin is a better buy.
---
You can stop worrying about "when is (Plane/House/Favela/Tower) gonna come back?" posts now
---
Oh yeah.
---
I mean, that's still a no choice gun, but it is pretty darn good.
---
Are the issues with Monty's pro league uniform or all of IQ's texture bugs ever going to be fixed or even acknowledged? It has been over 2 and a half years now that they have been broken, the patch notes always state that "minor texture issues have been fixed with certain uniforms" but the most obvious ones are still in the game after 2 years of constant reports. I've paid money for these skins and its ridiculous they havent been fixed after this long.
---
A post was made a very long time ago a couple months after buck and frost came out. A guy TKd Buck, thinking it was Frost, and then got killed by Frost 20 seconds later. He posted it on the sub super confused of how he killed Frost and then she came back and killed him. It got upvoted so everyone could see it. I think he removed the video, but someone may have created a mirror. I'll look for it.
---
He moves slowly when carrying it and can only hip fire. But the recoil is reasonable and the shield covers most of your body
---
Pretty sure Frost is a demon and not an alien
---
What do you think twitch is doing in this clip? ADS would be first to go.

Yes because spawn peeking is toxic
---
Newsflash it's not
---
Burn it out with flashes
---
Siege is a team-based shooter. Operators should be most useful-- and consequently balanced-- around their maximal performance in a team setting, not the other way around.
---
Castle is fine. Your suggestions are broken and idiotic.
---
Now it's Hereford, skyscraper, fortress, and whatever else post. Unlucky
---
Outback from burnt horizon
---
There is nothing dickish in that comment, unless you consider the truth to be dickish.
---
they should deny you acces after the pest gets you everyone have 3 drones but mozzie can takeover 3 and possibly he will get only 1 or 2
---
Dont like it dont play. Spawn peeking is the easiest thing to counter.
---
casual house it the best! but i can see why its not it ranked
---
Can't wait, it looks really fun
---
As it's already been said we need an alternative, not a nerf to jager
---
I use the pistol more then his SMG, I just have that good of a trigger finger, I basically use it as a primary.
---
oh i didnt see the twitch in the background sorry
---
Can't wait, it looks so fun !

He didn't make this, it's an avatar on the PS store...

If you use the photos app in windows to clip something it renders like this shit

10am est 23rd is the leak on Xbox
---
Oh god, imagine another operator device where the device redirects the thrown device back at the attacker's location.
---
Why? Are you a pro league player?
---
goddammit beserker
---
Well sorry
---
I’ve seen this like a year ago
---
Favela?
---
Doubt they would remove it as ubisoft have announced as well
---
Operators that win a lot but aren’t really played often. Either for having a high skill ceiling that makes it inaccessible to the vast number of players, or they’re not fun to play.
---
Yeah, it's so you can hold onto stuff like frags that are more valuable than flash grenades. I thought it was common knowledge, but apparently more people don't know to do it than those that do. It also requires that your team have a mild sense of coordination which is hard if you solo queue.
---
thanks for the correction. sorry for the downvotes, ily
---
there's multiple entry point in every map, there's no reason to waste a useful tool such as drones.
---
Chalet and Skyscrapper out of casual but still in ranked lmao. Just delete Skyscrapper out of existence already.
---
Bring plane and house back
---
Thatcher :}
---
There was no thatcher tho?
---
I would place my pest at the middle of door/window, so that whenever someone throws it, it would still get snatched
---
All maps are available in playlists that you generate, playable with friends.
---
Wow I know what games I will be joining in progress.
---
Please don't smack us in the face with all four bad maps at once. Why not take two out and add two? I was enjoying casual this season so far.
---
I absolutely love Chalet! Probably one of my favorite maps alongside Fortress
---
At least new Hereford is out. That map is still a mess. 
---
I'll miss fortress though. That's a solid map.
---
ITT: People complaining about not having all the maps in casual while simultaneously complaining about the maps that are being added back in
---
Personally I've been looking forward to plane and house rejoining, because they're just about the most fun casual maps R6 has to offer
---
technically that is not a smurf acc
---
Even if you want to play that map it becomes an endless cycle of quitters and loading, by the time you get to the round it's a 2v4 at best.
---
That's issue number 1 right there.
---
A soul for a soul
---
Jesus, I feel bullied and it wasn't even me
---
A rough day at the office.
---
Reminds me of that Jurassic Park where they were like, 'dinosaurs are great weapons we can point a laser at the target and the dinosaur attacks them!'. If you are pointing a laser at them just attach it to a gun and shoot them. xD
---
you're just wasting your time talking to him/her, if this person is set to do this, whatever you try to say will just pass through.
---
The pest doesn't have range to cover the whole door. Just throw it near the top, if the pest can reach the floor it can't reach the top part of the door entrance.
---
You had the opportunity to call her/him "fuck" but you didn't use it.
---
Personally as far as normal ops, I dont agree with this, although it would be cool if we got an operator (preferably attacking) that could wire gadgets together so they can be triggered at the same time.
---
If he's surfing up to champion 8, fair fucking play to him
---
Yo what skin is that?
---
Quality is crap
---
I absolutely love your reaction honestly.
---
I need the Halloween event already!!
---
they don't know that, all they saw was mozzie's pest indicator and they went &gt; A) find another entry point, or, B)throw it a little higher, then get snatched either way.
---
Mmh that's strange
---
Maybe someone just had the same idea
---
I started about a month or 2 ago, i’ve been playing Jager and had no idea the charges were limited.
---
Ty for the info!
---
Thanks for the input, u/sirfaggit
---
Some people like to play with a stretched aspect ratio because it "changes" how big the enemy is. I have never used it because it gives me a headache and I also have heard mixed things about whether or not it actually does anything.
---
Dude, use those batteries on walls.
---
Nah man I only play casual when I need to blow off some steam. If you don’t wanna get kicked just hop in the ranked queue.
---
I feel like Jäger should have his own category.
---
Those two maps were literally my two most favorite maps.
---
Shit it's meant to 'HeLp NeW pLaYeRs LeArN tHe MaPs' there's newcomer for that like just let us have house and plane
---
Ah yes, god tier mira placement.
---
Casual should have a voting system already. Lobby is loaded, you vote in 15 seconds for the map you want to play from a selection of say 5 maps, majority wins. ez

You telling me the 90%+ pick rate is SOLELY down to his gadget?!
---
It is, right now.
---
The entire comment was justifiably condescending. Doesn't make the poster a dick.
---
they had one. they baited it with grenades thru the drone hole, you can hear the ADS shooting them as the shock drone rolls up
---
I also read your comment regarding nobody talks on console, so your drones are your bestfriends, all the more you shouldn't waste them since you can only depend on ***yourself and your own drones***. I'm a solo queue-r as well, so I can see why you did that but its not really the right decision(?)
---
Fucken aye you seen that fire rate? That’s insane, it’ll probably take that fire rate much quicker to even down one three armour to low heath

you can’t even pixel peek effective anymore after they fixed the lean spam.

Ubisoft: "Added different coloured circles around the targeted footstep for better visual feedback. "
---
That may be the case but most people aren't still playing games that came out before COD4 did 12 years ago. That may, however, be the reason they had a setting to switch crouch back to R3 for people that were used to how it used to be.
---
you can hear it being used up as the drone drives up. they probably tossed frags in there then used the airjab after twitch started zapping to prevent the trick
---
Alright COME GET YOUR SHIT *bwooomp*
---
By buying the game, I’m purchasing the maps with the game....they are part of the game
---
We should just have CS:GO's map picking system. I could understand its lack at first, when the community was small, but at this point, there really is no excuse.
---
Idk why people thumbed you down... i thought "that looks suspicious" was funny :P
---
Tower is toxic.  Reported
---
Depends on the update, are they down now? Check the Siege Twitter account for an estimate
---
Are u sure dude
---
if you grind you can get it within 90 hours, with booster around 50, soo
---
I'd probably like it if we could actually rappel instead of having to run a marathon every time I deploy at the wrong side of the map.
---
No, his weapon is BETTER than all other defenders, that’s why. 90% of guns in this game are easy to use, as there is such low recoil on most weapons in the game. 
---
Nerfing the carbine won’t effect his utility SO if you don’t play him, that’s your choice, not down to the nerf. He’s still as good in that department as before and is just as important. Don’t blame a weapon nerf for this!
---
Again, stop going on about his utility. This is about his weapon. No one wants his utility nerfed and rightly so
---
Just look at my flair... that’s why I use this man for these type of moments
---
I think you misspelled Mountain
---
We can't base our game on the "casual games". We must maintain it balanced to the proper way to play, which is predominant in pro league.
---
Let's not level the game from the bottom, but instead, from the top
---
Idk why you are getting downvotes, your observation is correct :(
---
this made me mad

Oh hekk i did

---
My seven day booster finally has a use 👻
---
1gb
---
How? Even disregarding the ACOG bois, there are other guns that basically just do that MPX's thing but better. The Mx4 Storm is a good example, I'd figure. Same damage, but a notably higher fire rate giving it a much more respectable DPS and also makes it into even more of a headshot machine.

The MMR gain or loss is just to reverse games with cheaters in them as if they didn’t happen, no matter the score. This is working as intended. It would be unfair if the MMR wasn’t changed for everyone in the game no matter what. And also if you beat the hacker, it’s probably because he wanted you to win.
---
took me like 30 seconds to install it on my pc
---
That’d be cool if I could connect to the servers... it’s the game not my connection.
---
That’s a good way of putting it and thanks for recognising. If he’s like Kaid, the pick rate won’t drop much and then I think we can finally agree a small weapon nerf would be one direction to take. 
---
If they go overboard and make them better than jäger (don’t know how) then yes, he’ll have a bigger drop. 
---
I still think he’ll sit around the 60% (which is too high) or higher either way it goes...but we’ll have to see
---
That's one reason why my squad bans Jäger every match.
---
Yeah exactly what’s happening to me. I *attempted* to start playing at 12:30...it’s 1:53 the queue either goes on forever or I get kicked from my party
---
That's absolutely the best description of the current state of castle
---
Favela is literally unbearable to play lmao
---
His mp5sd is good this season, and most people have a hard time dealing with a decent echo player. He has two drones that can deny plants or generally make you an easy target for defenders.
---
It’s been over an hour of my trying to join a game rn lol I’m about to give up and go back to Skyrim but I really wanna play some siege

How did you get this to show?

dude just get fiber internet, it is fast as fuck. I get 1GB up and 1GB down. it would download your update in literally a second
---
Thanks buddy
---
Why not just take an extra 3 seconds to use the garage drone hole?  Or wait till after drone phase and drone through the yellow stairs window/lobby hall window?  All are better options to wasting a drone for a pest lol, that's a lose lose.
---
We got the update 1h ago
---
Why did you shoot your Lion?

No only duplicated Reddit posts will

I loved it, it's so toxic I had some super sweat games on there it's fun sometimes

yes

How is his gun different than last season
---
I don't feel like driving my drone across the map to get to objective

Looks like the garage to your right when you spawn at main entrance on coastline

The ban rate for other trap and Intel ops is going up though, more people are using independent thought.

The map is basically paper imo. Buck is the best for it.
---
That sounds a little broken with the deagle buuut idk
---
He's right. I did see it and I was shocked! Cant wait!
---
It's a thing. My squad is all plat (2 and 3). We have both a Kapkan and Frost main. We win almost all of our defensive rounds. Their guns are solid and when you play them enough you know what spots work for the traps even in high level ranked games.
---
Np
---
There are plenty on youtube
---
She's currently one of the worst ops I think. She has no reason to be picked, with that buff she would have one
---
My question exactly
---
I mean i don't think he is to op but maybe just remove the acog, make it harder to hold tighter angles and force him to push a little more i dont know lol?
---
Thought the same. Feel like this is the worst way to deal with this situation
---
Bro same
---
&gt;2: for you it's a "stupid strategy" but 300+ other upvoters think otherwise
---
Oh man I dont think you understand the stupid shit that gets upvoted every day on reddit lmao, but you do you
---
Kapkan's SMG is reaaally nice. So is the PMM. You also get a nitro cell or impacts so you get a lot of flexibility as to how you can play him.
---
he’s easily countered tho. i always play iq, and you usually have a thatcher or twitch. it’s easy to deal with his drones and plus people like doc and rooks gun more then echos
---
Yesterday I got them both back to back in ranked and I wanted to fucking die. Anytime my friends and I get skyscraper we immediately write off the elo and play like braindead assholes hoping to 4-0 or be 4-0ed so we can get out of it asap. I'll take the loss and get my elo back on a better map.
---
I guess this is a good compromise?
---
For now this is one of a kind but i will be making more
---
Seeing as he's nowhere on the leaderboard for r6tab or r6tracker network, he was probably found to be cheating in some way.
---
Bro go do something instead of writing paragraphs about my post
---
Now.
---
Jager is actually balanced by design and not by the ability to tell if he's overpowered or not.  What I mean by that is he's balanced because he's unique and is picked all the time, by both teams.  When/if they ever come out with an alternative to Jager so that he isn't picked nearly 100% of the time, then you will be able to tell how he really stacks up.
---
Ofc
---
I can't finde any about it...... I'm to hyped lul
---
Friend. *low-key I see everyone shitting on tower all over the place on here so I didn't wanna say it but you said it first*

Hahahahaha

Oh I was just being corny lol I know why hes picked

Won't that make the Fraggers too op... Shoot the leg and you're down in one shot should suck

Your flair makes this a little biased lol

I was half expecting Bandit to Nitro the Hostage
---
If they removed approx 40% of the breakable walls, it would be a great map. It’s already a great layout. I personally like it.

Oh, I’ve canceled right when it started before, but I started searching for a match a bit later, and I got out back in. Must be a glitch now

What ? the back ground is photoshoped + i mad this Ela skin

What do you mean ?
---
I probably would’ve too
---
i mean he’s the best attacker according to his win delta
---
How is this a whoosh 7yr old
---
As a semi Mozzie main, Ill take note of this one
---
That isnt true in this shooter. You cant really learn from someone you cannot watch. In Rocket League or League I would totally agree but we have neither the ability to watch Opponents or a Replay.
---
Dont know. There was a while ago and ubi said they were working on it. Seems like there are less and less mnk users.
---
How are people supposed to be familiarizing themselves with the maps if they can't play on them? I get your point of being worried about overwhelming people with too many maps, but the point remains that casual is, as the name implies, casual. You're not supposed to take it seriously so you can spend as much time as you want getting used to the maps.
---
No, and no.
---
I would say to be fair 20 damage because if it was used to frag with it would be broken.
---
I do this by accident
---
Maybe someone on the attacking team
---
It's because the only people that play them in plat/dia are mains for the most part.
---
If you get to 11 minutes, you should’ve restarted the queue by then

I agree with that, I do kinda wish when they took maps out, do SOMETHING to them atleast
---
Eugh, Theme Park is the worst.
---
The law of equivalent exchange.
---
Yeah I play casual cause I don't have any one to play with and solo que ranked is fucking aids
---
trust me, the new maps are much more fun.
---
Only the chosen few
---
Yeah but if you don't want to get stomped by smurcfs then just learn more maps at once
---
What are the dates on the Halloween event?
---
As I said in another comment you cant really learn from someone you cannot watch. We never got inside because these 3 guys got spawnkilled every round so there was nothing to learn from the opponent
---
Warden being a 2/2 will make such a difference. His primary guns were not meant to be play by a 1/3, and in fact had all been given to 2/2 operators
---
fecking took long enough for Ubi to put them back in!
---
Casual is very toxic at the minute, randomly getting voted out of games before they have even begun or as you said getting team killed for no reason. 
---
I wish I had the answer.
---
Edit: Just a thought, it may be due to the new unranked playlist. I'm guessing certain players see casual as a playground now.
---
I don't understand why they just don't bring it back, like sure it's not the most competitive map, but look at house,yacht or especially Favela xD they all are unbalanced as fck and Favela is the worst map ever in general, many ppl are asking for bartlett to come back as well so..why ubi..
---
and again, there is no evidence.
---
New player here, I know mozzie hacks the drones but how does trying to jump it like that change anything?
---
I disagree. You don't get any type of reward after getting kicked or leaving a match. Battle pass shouldn't be excluded
---
They should at least attempt to fix the ones that are Blatantly imbalanced like Favela, but I doubt they ever will.
---
Ok *that* might be an overreaction lol
---
I feel more bad for the person who got team killed
---
Might get downvoted for this but oh well. Does anyone kind of miss when siege operators actually looked kind of realistic? We’re venturing into fortnite territory with zombies and unicorns. 
---
I’m not gonna cry about it but I wish there was an option to turn skins off.
---
Mines at 69 and I don’t want to play anymore
---
They're specifically designed to frustrate customers while simultaneously hooking into potential gambling addictions. Not exactly what I want in my leisure hobby experience.
---
Well I feel like some maps are just so laughably bad that they won’t fix them, house they confirmed they won’t ever touch because it’s their baby
---
Styling on all these new players that have no idea what plane is smh
---
Oh, thanks.  
---
I guess I didn't get it because I expected something clever.
---
No, not tower please ubi. Why do you do this to us 😥
---
You're too evil
---
Probably forgot he had the shotgun equipped
---
when the most casual mode in a game still excludes almost a third of the game's maps
---
I'm not sure this is allowed
---
&gt;they’re cosmetics
---
As a Mozzie main...
---
*whispers under breath* delete this right fucking now.
---
That’s still stupid
---
Read the rules, nothing about promoting
---
And lootboxes. Virtual gambling. I will never stand behind it or encourage it.
---
This is can be a great wallpaper
---
Yeah you can. Where you got spawnkilled, how to avoid getting killed there in the future etc. Every life is a lesson
---
Read the rules, doesnt seem to violate
---
You can buy them with in game currency for free now so they did everything people could imagine to happen
---
Well then now's the time for Ubi to fix that. People shouldn't be punished for doing nothing wrong.
---
Just remember to ban mav
---
I mean, there is no such thing as droning it out in copper, bronze and silver league LOL
---
The good old days..
---
No I cannot. I nearly never get spawnkilled because I am an experienced player. I know where to look and how to peek known angles. I know where to place my drone to counter spawnpeeks.
---
My teammates definitely didnt learn from their mistakes.
---
Tomorrow. Til Nov 6
---
Hijacking the top comment to point out:
---
With these current prices, there is ***no bulk discount*** on purchasing these at more than 1 at a time. The 4-pack to the 28-pack all work out to the same 12,500 per pack.
---
This means you should definitely buy them 1-at-a-time, just in case you get all non-charm items by your 26th or 27th pack.
---
More likely though, you'll get all the headgear and uniforms you want by 15 or 20 packs in and save yourself some serious renown.
---
I’m not even joking, so did I. I just bought the diamond skin😪
---
This is a special event. The actual operators are still realistic. just some stupid fun for a week. I personally love it
---
That’s from last year.
---
I have an idea for Nøkk, give her a suppressed version of Jäger's 416-C which has maybe 40 damage instead of 43 or something like that, i think this would be a perfect fit for her.
---
They are looking into it his winrate too high
---
Isn't this just the one from last year?
---
Thats last years my dude lol
---
I still suspect China is involved
---
Have you ever played Tower or Favela in casual? At least one or two people always leave at the start.
---
The funny thing is people actually suggest making him like tachanka. I'm dead serious why the fuck do people cry about him when I kill him SUPER SUPER EASILY
---
Hope you okay
---
really? Probably casual cuz thats what i only play.
---
Because overwatch and csgo don’t have maps nearly as complex as siege, there’s are millions of angles in the game still being discovered to this day 4 years later
---
Well that’s tough, he’s in the game and he’s clearly not to hard to kill judging from your post
---
He’s a good op
---
Second post?
---
I am due to the fact I enjoy my variety.
---
Ah that makes a lot of sense!
---
Cant wait til nokk gets better guns in a coming update
---
Yeah
---
We have decided to put black beard on both offense and defense to even the odds
---
Yea it was casual. I remember cus I screenshotted your name cus I thought it was funny
---
That is the one from last year mate
---
You made a great choice. I can't believe people TK on  ranked.

---
Guys this person is a certified mozzie main. What they say is law.
---
Dont be a narc, im new and didnt know. Sorry
---
But it would take way *more* effort to create 8/10 accounts, find a way to have them all active at once, and then have the random luck that both squads of fake accounts are even in the same game, and for what? A less effective way to earn Battle Points even if it worked 100% of the time? (Which it would only likely work about 10% of the time if you were lucky)
---
in range of a mute jammer ?
---
Not impressive, the enemy team wasnt even playing
---
And how does limiting the map pool help new players learn “millions” of angles? 
---
They spend months learning new maps only for 4 “new” maps to appear and have to learn everything from the start. Whereas a full map pool means they know the basic layout of all the maps in a few weeks.
---
I'm not a Mozzie main, but I love the little guy. This hurts to see just as well :c
---
yes, please more people who speak sense
---
This would be a very powerful rework
---
But the problem is that was giving content to help out. What Ubi is doing now is taking away content. They're kinda punishing the veteran players by trying to help out the new players. 
---
Also I feel as though this whole idea just plain doesn't work. Fortress has been the map in rotation and I still don't know where the fuck I'm going. It's not like a quick match on house or plane (arguably some of the most fun maps) is going to completely screw over new players.
---
He's either useless or op either way should be removed. He punishes you for getting good aim or his gadget doesn't work either way 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I would say give him 3 remote barricades and you can open said barricade by hitting alternate ability button like capitao or zofia. Each barricade will have a number which will be displayed when you switch the ability button.
---
I mean.....you can just call it out? Or just say that they have a mozzie. It's a waste of a drone otherwise.
---
Blood splatter is server side. So regardless of what you think you saw, you are mistaken. If blood splatter appears, the person takes damage. No matter what.

lol this sub man, you literally said nothing different than I did, then proceed to get downvotes. Kids need to stay off their phones in class.
---
It's already made more convenient for them in the Newcomer playlist. Yes, it has limited maps but the point of that mainly is for them to learn the controls. After that, learning a map should be way easier as opposed to learning BOTH controls and map at the same time WHILE playing in Casual where you might play against high level players, trolls, just fooling around squads, or just a generally toxic player.
---
Making the attachments free is a little different since with those you still get to acquire whatever you want. Whereas locking maps means if you wanted a map, you don't get it until the devs themselves choose to put them back in. 
---
Like I said, it's basically additional and unnecessary handholding that also affects old players who chill in Casual like me. I only get to play a couple hours a day and it's not even every day, It is frustrating having to play the same maps during that time. I may never have noticed that before but I sure did since Ember Rise. I can't fucking play a map two times in a row or three times a day.
---
I completely agree with your opinion, dude. Although I think keeping the personal argument out of this would be a good decision
---
When they nerf you so hard they kick you out of the chart.
---
Good times
---
Both are complete shit.
---
My guy you weren't even being an asshole correctly.
---
"Ding dong, your opinion is wrong"
---
Well I don't think the pest could stop the bullet to keep the drone intact, best alternative would be a option if you got close to the drone to grab the pest and remove it
---
I don't think that has anything to do with it. I believe they stated it's due to the size of the game or something? More content keeps getting added but for whatever reason the game can only be so big so something has to give.
---
Here with my two pistols
---
Do you expect Ubi to communicate to you that the packs will be purchasable with renown before they‘re even officially announced?

Amazing!!!

No mate, my phone still rings and I still have to cancel the call to make it stop ringing. I'm talking about when you're ON CAMS, it used to appear a tv static effect along with the Dokkaebi logo, neglecting your cam info and forcing you to get out of the phone. This effect didn't appear to me on that round and I'm wondering if it was a bug or if they removed it.

Well I’m sorry but on a few maps he is the teams lifeline 
---
He’s easy to counter with his low fire rate and awful movement speed and the fact he’s not fully covered from the front, to be honest he’s a pain in the ass to play but he gets the wins so he’s clearly not useless
---
When your team plays the game properly, all information is shared so it doesn't matter whose drone it is
---
You play in copper if kitchen window is the biggest problem for you as a defender.
---
But yes, it is an additional annoying line of sight defenders have to watch. Which only supports my overall point that Chalet is a trash map.
---
That's why we have to nerf Frost, it has to be her gadget's health and not the surprise factor of picking her and making a window literally impossible to vault
---
Thanks Ubi
---
Sorry, didn't mean to be a dick. Hope you have a good evening/day ❤
---
This is such a waste if you just take note on where the pest is why not just shoot it?!
---
may be a bug, i’m sure there would be an uproar from dokkaebi mains if they removed it
---
Thx!
---
You literally No U'd that guy good play! That was cool to watch the reverse spawn peek was the cherry on top of that clip.
---
Lighten up pal.

I believe Castle benefits from there being the drone hole as it makes planting breach charges more risky and as such forces attackers to use nades/etc

The only problem I have with dog is AI... Cmon its  a competive game and I am not going to throw the game in the hands of an AI. Also dog OP would be just 2) not benefitial. Either the dog dies 2 seconds after entering the building due to dumb AI or the dog is godlike and broken

---
I love putting my pest on the underside of skylight window of Kafe. Even if IQ sees it, there's no way of killing it unless there's a Thatcher or Twitch goes for it.  There's nothing like being 30 seconds into the round and snatching the drone that was supposed to clear the bar lel
---
I mean you still suck
---
The playlist without House, Favela, and Yaht was incredible for Casual.
---
I would be more than happy to see this in hot
---
Fuck. Now all the slivers and golds know my tricks
---
matchmaking map preferences aren't for pvp lol
---
THIS!
---
Communication isn't a problem for me, it's just the vast skill gap between teams most of the time.
---
They should have just left tower out, it’s an unbalanced map and an unfun map. I suppose unbalanced is ok for casual (see Plane, House, and Favela, actual fun maps but completely unbalanced), but i honestly hate tower. Unbalanced and not fun to play on.
---
and which one did I violate apart from the ignorant Chinese ego
---
because not everyone has the money to get a good pc let alone a good pc and a console
---
At this rate...
---
I get it man, video would of been better without it though from a viewers perspective, maybe something to think about next time you upload something cool. Wp!

They used to be

Not a fan of plane or favela. Super unbalanced. Kinda wish they'd keep them out of rotation until they're remade

yes, i know, i was doing other things and when i came back, i saw that
---
He scared at least one person so much they went nowhere near it.
---
Sadly, planned for Y5S1 if I remember right...
---
Always a pleasure
---
He literally only gets picked if a team is up by two or more and they’re confident they’ll win. No one is using him in any competitive sense.
---
Get rid of the laser sight. You were holding that angle and he probably noticed it and as soon as it moved hey peaked.
---
Welp. Time to start grinding.
---
OMG P L E A S E ITS SO ANNOYING
---
For some reason this would make me extremely happy.
---
I see people constantly complain he is weak yet he has the highest attacking win delta in the game so...
---
his ability is to lock the door go on Reddit and make Joe dad jokes
---
I’m pretty sure that won’t work. If you get UPlay+ then you get all the operators so back when you could get a free trial of it, a lot of people thought you could just activate your free trial to unlock all of them and then you’ll always have them. A couple friends of mine did it and it didn’t work, when the free trial ran out they were back to only having the operators they had before.
---
What map is that?
---
Probably to get more players to have more of everything and help them develop
---
Wow I'm sure this would be incredibly fun and not at all broken.
---
Are you young or stupid... or both? Obviously you’re white you’re over here groveling at the feet of a bunch of redditors to get permission to dress as a fictional fucking character. You said “white people are the only ones who do that,” by which I *assume you* mean ‘appropriate culture. How about this, if you aren’t white you can’t do/speak/use anything European in origin. Does that sound reasonable or fucking stupid? It’s rhetorical don’t answer...

If you don’t have a laser then bad luck. I can’t tell if you do or don’t with the video quality.

---
I feel that simply splitting his shield into three parts instead on one massive one panel would make him alot better, because you dont have to worry about your whole defense being destroyed by one pixel peeker hitting the corner of your shield
---
by making the standard edition cost as much as the ultimate edition and making the gold edition cheaper than the standard edition?
---
I’m screaminggg ur so mad 😂
---
Esports ready.
---
Yes every platform has this issue, ubi already announced a fix they are working on, so im not sure talking about it matters much
---
350.000 wtf
---
Bruh it is hard to push into obj at the last second when there is a trap op in general, also it does not have to get someone but can simply waste the attackers time of having to check if there is a bear trap there and that second can get you killed by someone who was looking in that direction. If frost does get an opponent who is picked back up that opponent is able to be killed with one or sometimes two rounds by every gun in the game which can mean the difference in winning or losing a round. Not only this but her smg has the highest damage of the smg class in the game with easy recoil, her shotgun is very good for a shotty, her secondary is a pretty well balanced headshot machine, she can have a shield which pairs well with her ability or a camera which can get a lot of information. She can be used as an anchor, roamer, or lurker and her ability is passive allowing her to place her traps, reinforce, use her secondary gadget and after that she can do what she wants. Her utility may not be as much as some other ops but if the enemy likes rushing or does not drone she will likely get one injure in her traps and will most likely be able to waste some time and some utility. She may not be the best but she is definitely not the worst, perhaps in the upper middle. Have a good day and thank you for coming to my ted talk.

Wtf... you’ll be able to buy the packs with renown.???

Lmao, how childish can one be. Easy speaking and cussing 👍
---
I'd play him
---
I mean, my profile pic was a literal penis in a bane mask for a while and that never got removed. I guess ubi are just completely inconsistent in their application of the EULA, with no bearing on political factors whatsoever :/
---
This is a game approaching it’s 4th year of support. The $60 you spent when the game came out does not factor in today. 
---
Factor in that 50,000 is fairly easy to get for the new ops and you have a ton of people that haven’t paid past that $60 so cosmetics are one of the main sources of income.
---
The fact that they give us the option to earn so much is honestly quite fair
---
They're still packs only, but the packs can now be bought with renown as well as credits.
---
I think nøkk is incredibly underrated for her intel denial. When the enemy runs valk echo maestro etc, she's a pretty good pick imo. Granted the team would probably be better off with a twitch or an iq and someone like jackal would be probably better for roam clear. Either way I still think she can be a strong pick in certain situations.
---
Okay, normally I'm really not the kind of guy to call people out on their grammar- but *please* use paragraphs. I can't read a wall of text that big.
---
I'll do my best to make you happy, random internet man.
---
I'm guessing it'll have more overpriced RNG cosmetics again where you get individual pieces of every costume separately so in order to get the full outfit you want for a certain operator, you'll have to spend $150.
---
This is Siege in a nutshell
---
A friend and I once lucked in to getting back to back games with two guys deranking. They said in both voice and text chat that they were deranking, they ran outside to give Rook armor to the other team when defending, they snatched the defuser and sat in spawn forcing us to try to kill all five defenders 5v3, they immediately popped black mirrors as soon as Mira put them up, they called out our positions in all chat...  All very, very blatant stuff. I reported them and sent video and screenshots of all this but when I look them up they’re still playing. So if that wasn’t enough to get anything done, I doubt anything is ever done about it.
---
Sasg is underrated

Are you okay dude?

I know people love the shit show fun of house and plane and to them these maps define the casual experience. To me this last half season was the best casual has ever been.

Where's the source on this?
---
Actually yes, it ended a while ago, it was my brothers account.
---
Maybe try getting the trial on another account then activating that account as primary PS4? Not sure if it’ll work but you could give it a try
---
Nice ,I can never control that, usually just use the pistol.

I forgive you, fellow redditor. I have made mistakes like this in the past. I just keep in mind to have a more positive outlook when commenting and BAM! karma but more importantly the smiles on random people’s faces.

But Tachanka on Bomb Defusal tho
---
Ps plus is shared across the console. So if one account has it every can play online. So if that account no longer has it then you might have to buy ps plus
---
I would honestly dig a "hella casual" rotation with house, plane, favela &amp; old hereford.
---
well yeah, they still want you to buy them with real money.
---
Lol right? Dw I’ve just been skimming his angry old man white suprematist paragraphs. I pick my fights &amp; this pathetic person is 110% not worth it.

Yeah I hear you, every pack is alittle over 12K Renown each

Pool selection was a thing in the past and resulted in horrendous queue times unfortunately.

Same. Accidentally impacted myself and a teammate as soon as they went for the plate. Felt so bad

That’s if mozzie uses it before round starts and brings it back inside

Yeah, dlc ops cost anywhere from 10k-25k renown (in game currency) per operator, depending on how old they are. You get around 1k renown per hour of play time, and we’re around 50 operators strong. It’s definitely worth you time to spend a little extra cash if you’re gonna get into this game.

Some people just want to watch the world burn

This is a good idea but there would be that person who uses this to put nsfw on weapons, likely the p90 due to the open space on it. But other than the reason above I said there would be no reason to not add this to r6!
---
Nah I deleted my comment. Well have a good day sir. Thanks
---
not OP, but I'll chime in. I love siege (lvl 119 or something), but don't enjoy playing in sweaty lobbies all the time. On X1, lot's of ranked players are using kb&amp;m and are super shitty if you're not up to par with high-level tactics and strats. I'm older as well and don't play FPS nearly as competitive as I once did.

Casual def. has it's fair share of BS, but it's still an overall fun experience.
---
No problem dude. Keep smiling.
---
I mean kinda their fault for all rushing main entrance, unless they're new, then it's a dick move
---
On a controller too mate, right?
---
If so than this is some priest level gameplay.

No guns, just a mop and a bulletproof bucket on their head with slits for the eyes. I would honestly main them, that sounds fun af.
---
Not really tried. It still is a thing for T-Hunt. At some point they decided it wasn't worth keeping I guess. Somewhat a bummer but then again understandable.
---
Thanks bro! And yes, normal PS4 controller.
---
It be like that sometimes I have been accused of this after a wall bang at one point
---
The 100% cpu is a weird bug in the game but running anything 100% doesnt affect the CPU as long as your pc has good cooling and power. 
---
Might wanna try something like /r/techsupport
---
Ok bet
---
Thanks man
---
A late summon to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Is it Survive Doc’s Spawnpeek?
---
God damn it Ubi.
---
Sounds about right
