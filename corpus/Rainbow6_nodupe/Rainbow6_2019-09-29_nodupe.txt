Props for trying something bold!

What's your though on buffing her now that pros are actually using her?
---

---
While she's mostly picked only to counter specific settings such as Bank garage, I don't really see her being used outside of that role. 
---
However, if Ubi feels that her being picked to counter those situation is enough, I fear that Nokk won't receive any changes other than maybe slightly longer gadget duration like last time.
---
That's not even my biggest criticism. I'm trying to be nice
---
Deep pockets.

The face looks more like a ‚Äú:D‚Äù than a Pepe to me.
---
No, get lord tachunky
---
How is that providing utility. The BP camera is the utility and the ACOG gives him a free kill. No utility on the ACOG there buddy. Any more examples??
---
Wait is the one in the left in-game? And how can you get it??
---
Wow you didn‚Äôt find extremely sweaty and toxic players on siege? How?!
---
bruh no.
---
 I already have him and he's my main
---
I think the small changes are more realistic at the moment as pros are starting to pick her and even banned her.
---
If Ubi decides that Nokk countering specific map set up is enough, Nokk likely won't receive any impactful buffs such as receiving a different gun. Maybe just longer gadget duration at this point. 
---
Though I guess time will tell since Nokk is just starting to get picked.
---
Not a suspicious question at all.
---
It might come close but there was a kickstarter for an analog keyboard with pressure sensitive keys.
---
#WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I‚Äôve got a challenge, post this into the pro league subreddit and see what everyone else‚Äôs opinions are. And btw the utility provided by the acog isn‚Äôt a free kill, you actually have to have good aim to get the kill
---
Can't be, he's not cheating to win.

Lucky and also because Finka Maverick and IQ were already my friend

---
If anything this isn‚Äôt toxic. I‚Äôve had ppl t bag me as the last person alive but downed. And it pisses me off like END ME ALREADY. But that was pretty funny lmao.
---
If you like to roam around Clash isnt a bad pick especially if you have someone following you or nearby to flank. A good portion of ppl try to have someone shoot behind her shield but if a teammate rotates and flanks from another spot its deadly. Plus you get to have fun by switching to the secondary and 180 people. 
---
In ranked she tends to be banned quite often but she's becoming one of my favorite ops to play solo or in a group.
---
Not a console player/fan but damn that looks neat :D
---
Insert Spongebob reference about the lid
---
Nice
---
Sick ace bro, looks like plat for sure
---
No no, you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm an idiot but also saying ACOG provides utility by itself. You need to back up you‚Äôre point if you‚Äôre making such a fuss about it. I‚Äôm waiting. 
---
P.S. why don‚Äôt you post it in the Subreddit if you‚Äôre so flustered over it.
---
Ok retard
---
I'm 3 games from a solo plat run. Honestly to me that is the biggest achievement I could get in this game, I've been close a few times.

Not always a viable tactic, especially when you have low health, and especially if you miss.

blatant copy of another post on the same map even. fuck off holy shit
---
Pretty sure they implemented this back when people were changing their region to get a higher rank because at the time you were basically rewarded for having a high ping.
---
I tried not to react but it's kinda hard
---
Ironically most germans I know prefer to put both on the top me included. I personally prefer it for the more symmetrical look but I don't know about others. When I was somewhere in grade 5-7 (can't remember) some even did it by accident in tests
---
MIB: No, we're not, look this way please.
---
I call fake. You weren't kicked by your teammates right afterwards.
---
Then they should still be placed in their rank and drop accordingly. There's no reason to be putting a 5 queue of plats against high silvers.
---
How did you get so good

I have a J√§ger chibi I bought at gamescom. It's now sitting in my PC as well :D

Good talk sport.
---
Last match i just joined a match and they lost 0-3 and it 4 people were Recruit and 1 person was IQ with her Elite skin
---
The main problem with this is that you dont understand how the game works. What you're showing us here would require the game to be rendered two times instead of one. 
---
games kinda work like a spotlight where mostly only the things you can see get rendered for best possible performance.
---
its the exact same reason why most games don't portray sniper scoper realistically.
---
i set a breach charge in attack position

Why is this getting downvoted?

they do say Russia is just bears on unicycles...

Honestly Nomad, amazing on bomb. Devastating if you get the plant down and good for stopping run outs.

There is a reason for that the SAS or Spetsnaz or even the seals will be more heavily amroured or have my higher grade stuff beacause if you have ever taken a cqb corse or if you are in the us and do a civilian reserves course you don‚Äôt want to have heavy plate Armour to slow you down

You rarely see spawnpeeks in ranked in the higher levels, nobody runs pro league stacks except for 5 stacks in high elo, and unranked is just to give a more competitive environment ie round count and match rules. It also gives a decent place for people to warm up

I watched valk throw a cam in there while I was on a drone and was too preoccupied to notice the lesion. Scared the shit outta me when I did notice him

Thanks bro any recommendations on the next operator

Thanks

thanks for the compliment lmfao thats better

Watch pro league match on Bank Spacestation vs Rogue. Slashug demonstrates perfected use of Nokk. IQ couldn‚Äôt do that. She was the designated drinker, and further won the match by killing maestro who could plant deny from his position and via his maestro cam.  Nokk is highest skill op. MP5SD is too op with her. Any Acog is too op. If you sometimes struggle to hear someone down the hallway imagine that + silent step. It would be way too advantageous with a long range weapon. They tried her with an AR in test servers all ARs except Ash has an Acog. So if that‚Äôs the case she woulda had an Acog on her gun. Obv not the best idea if it was OP b4. Lower dmg doesn‚Äôt meant anything if it has no recoil and has a silent step. Part of reason why cav‚Äôs loadout is pretty garbage. Only a gun buff to mediocrity is required. Acog too big of a jump.
---
It is very clearly gold/metallic paint
---
Hopefully it's patched forever. Literally played with EU diamonds that are boosting in lower ranks on NA every day, it was ridiculous.
---
High ping on either side leads to peekers advantage, poor hitreg and shadow hotboxes on both sides. So your argument that ping abuse doesn't exist is factually incorrect. High ping on either side gives the more aggressive person the advantage because of the before mentioned peekers advantage. People who know how to play a high ping correctly certainly win gunfights they shouldn't be winning solely because of ping.
---
High ping and bad connection just worsen the experience for everyone. Voluntarily choosing to have a high ping shouldn't be a thing, and it's good Ubi is trying to get rid of it.
---
Congrats! You get my first ever downvote (for teabagging)
---
Sad.

This is so sad, alexa play despacito

I have had 2 black ices. I say 2 but both were the mp5.

Wow! what a iq you have here

Hey fuckface if you could stop stalking all my posts I would greatly appreciate it
---
Noice
---
^
---
Gotta love that speed on the new breach charges.
---
Question: if an ash is able to sneak up on you, then into sight is she good? Even without having breaching charges? Answer is yes. Only reason why Nokk is over looked is because her guns are bad. What would be nice if her gun was a 3 shot with the exception that a suppressor doesn‚Äôt deduct dmg.
---
I have no volume on and I don't like this one bit
---
Ironically, that is the first trophy I earned.
---
And it was by complete accident.
---
then quit making posts complaining about everything. if you really dislike the game that much then uninstall. nobody wants your moronic opinion on when and why this game will die because we know you have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
If it‚Äôs already linked I think it‚Äôs set in stone. You must have been logged into your alts ubi account when you did it. You could be like me and have it on your alt and your main :D
---
ROTFL
---
This is so sad, can we kill a million hostages?
---
Agree with this . However after some thought, Nokk should be able to pass Ela mines. If she can‚Äôt keep silent enough, maybe keep her movement hidden, then in theory proximity mines shouldn‚Äôt go off, idk probs stupid. Make her like old vigil ability, and possibly buff the DOP on her gun and she‚Äôs golden, not even OP, just viable.
---
Ok. Cool thanks
---
Where could I get one of those? I really need one but I have no idea where to look. Also is it easy to install or will I have to go somewhere to get it installed.
---
i thought of putting music in but didn't know what to put if you have better ideas to help give me ideas please either here or on twitter @elpast\_
---
Ela is the only op who has had her hair color change at all, except for outliers life halloween skins
---
Your friend plays COD

and that isnt supposed to happen, plats are supposed to suffer with plats, not pretend to be good at the game by ruining it for lower levels.

just remember, you're the one ruining the game.

Can't do it on console

r/notopbutok
---
That face tho
---
I remember the potato grip in Battlefield 4
---
Sounds like someone has no black ice
---
&gt; There's also big community people who say it does exist. KG was just saying anyone who thinks ping abuse doesn't exist is an idiot the other day.. does that mean anything?
---
Well compared to Kixtar and Rogue 9, with the latter having documented proof of it not existing from the developers themselves, I think I'll go with Rogue 9's view than KG who just rants about bullshit all the time.
---
&gt; hese people playing the game for money gives them no extra knowledge on the matter than anyone else.. including Rogue9.
---
Dude if this is your attempt at discrediting what I posted, then you need to give it a better shot because this is really weak.
---
&gt; When you load into the game and connect to the servers you're automatically put on the data center that you have the lowest ping on at that given time.. 
---
Nope. Not always. I was put into WEU last season, when my lowest ping was on NEU. In the game's menu it would say (for example) 130ms WEU, but when I play in it, I have a steady 150ms. When I manually changed to NEU, it would be 110-120ms.
---
&gt; if you're consistently being put on a server where you have a significantly higher ping on than others than you are an anomaly. 
---
Yet one which had a safeguard by being able to, you know, manually change server. But I guess only PC players should have that privilege, and all other privileges in fact, fuck console players amirite?
---
&gt; They shouldn't keep the feature for a tiny group of people that are using it honestly when the vast majority of people are using it to ruin the experience for others.
---
LOL, you being adamant that ping abuse is a thing is really hilarious man.
---
&gt; They should instead fix the issue of said small group getting out on servers where they have a worse ping.
---
Yeah we know they're going to do this for said small group. Oh yeah, definitely.
---
Lol it's exactly the same
---
What kind of problems?
---
Well they‚Äôve stated they create characters then put them in a ‚Äúfreezer‚Äù characters that come out now are designed well before they come out...but you don‚Äôt seem to know this do you?
---
It's a test run for the clear coat that I'm using. Its automotive 2k so it should hand light use but probably no rage throws.

---
You have black ice for the unoptimal weapons. I too possess the curse
---
I absolutely agree. I stopped playing a while ago since BR games aren't really for me but I still quite enjoy watching it on twitch from time to time. The game is constantly being updated with new content and for a game so massive Epic still do a decent job at staying in touch with their community (although I think most games do nowadays).
---
While the dances can obviously be cringey and their esports events are embarrassing at times, it really doesn't deserve the hate it gets.
---
I have, for Kapkan's SMG, whom I main, but I a) have a life and better stuff to do that post it on this subreddit.
---
Well that sucks because they obviously set me up. It's stupid that people can get away with that garbage
---
General advice: don‚Äôt reload so often. I bet that after that second kill, you‚Äôd have been able to catch the third player as they were going past the doorway (if that‚Äôs what they did). It‚Äôs a habit that I‚Äôve been trying hard to break and surprisingly, it catches opponents off guard. 
---
They think that since you‚Äôve killed someone, you‚Äôll be reloading so they peek me and because I‚Äôm still holding my angle on the doorway, I can kill them instead of them killing me. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but it happens enough to be useful. 
---
Tip as a doc is to always check your teammates health every 30 seconds or so. Literally just a quick glance to the top of your screen. I normally do a quick callout to my teammate to say that I see they‚Äôre weak so I‚Äôll try to heal them up. However, I only do this when they‚Äôre essentially at just over half health or below. This is because if they‚Äôre at 70 health, it kinda wastes some of the stim by overhealing them. Also, if I see a teammate is being extremely annoying and constantly pinging me and saying that I should go to them, even when there‚Äôs nothing going one and they‚Äôre in the room right next to mine, I refuse to heal them. Especially the fuckers who yell down the mic. 
---
Last tip, always keep a stim shot for yourself. No matter what your teammates say, keep one for you. It doesn‚Äôt matter when I use it but I always make a rule to never use more than one on myself. I either save it for the end of the round when the enemies push or I use it if I‚Äôve been in an intense gunfight early on.
---
nope, they arent.
---
new players come in, but do they stay? does ubisoft track the activity of them? how many times they play? i doubt they'll tell you because it's terrible.
---
broken games never last more than 5 years without actual support and ubisoft is providing anything but.
---
people stopped playing CSGO for this trash heap they thought was going to be good. just wait for the next decent multiplayer game to come out and watch the "dedicated" playerbase jump ship.
---
i would stop playing this game in an instant if i had literally anything else that i haven't worn into the ground.
---
This guy doesn't have a black ice.
---
Yeah im trying to get it exact so i can pace myself better, so as not to rush back into site after a plant, you know?
---
They said their working on it and they havent released an update while they said there working on the ddosing
---
Thankyou! Also how did you get the operators next to your name?

Didn‚Äôt they nerf the damage those did to players in burnt horizon?

No

No X3
---
exactly man, that's what pisses me off, they said they were going to fix it in ps4 with the last update and they didn't solve anything.
---
If u do plant it might be best to stay and fight or to drone out the defuser and wait for someone to try and destroy it and just shoot them or meme on them with a breach charge or somthing

Spray paint. A lot of people think spray paint is shitty but if you prep right and know what you're doing it turns out amazing. Just sand, primer, color, and clear. The clear is the most important. I use 2k automotive clear.

Well there are also only one games on each server so they know which games the ddsoers r in so they get 10 people to widdle down the ddoser

On the subreddit homepage, there are three dots in the top right corner. Press those and it‚Äôll say that you can edit your flair (or something along those lines). Press the option and you can select any operator image. You can also edit the flair to put multiple operator names or images (up to 5 operators). 
---
The format is like this:

Buck:Valkyrie:Maverick

You have to put a colon between each name so that the system knows that it‚Äôs multiple operators.

yeah I hope for a future update they tweak it so its a 500~ limit, but with the feature that you can invite any friends rank like copper, and it'll just ignore their mmr or put it within the 500 limit of whatever the highest in the squad is

Very strange. I won 9 placement matches and only got Plat

The bots in Seige are not very good, minimum viable function while using a few loadouts that are very simplified. They walk into the middle of a room and then use an aim bot with various degrees of stutter applied to it depending on the difficulty picked. They would need a reinvention to be able to represent the range of operators players can use, in a wider range of game modes, without being a total embarrassment of an experience.

Cause in ranked you probably did something so bad that it doesn't matter if they lose that match at this point.

Did you pay him or something? Im confused asf rn. Or does he actually play?

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just down to preference

I also have the skin, I also do
---
I like the mute for his trigger discipline
---
It was pretty much 1v1. If that Jager with 17 kills would have killed you, they pretty much won the round. Same goes for you, if you killed that Jager, your team almost automatically won the round.

That's just unfortunate. He's probably playing with either an unranked friend, or a low plat/highgold in his stack.

There's still 4 teammates per round, get creative.
---
For real though, they're all bugged. I assumed it was just counting kills from casual but only matches from ranked. But mines gone down from 80+ to around 11

This sub is trash. Why do mods allow this type of stuff? Its a casual 1v3 filmed on a phone. Low effort garbage that needs to be removed.

It seems you like to complain a lot.  Out of everything on the sub you see a single bad quality video and blame it on the mods. They have better stuff to look out for.
---
Thoes can all be bought with r6 credit except for the legendaries which you get from alpha packs
---
I see that you complain about anything that you don‚Äôt like in games lol. Just use tractor cannon if supers are too good for you and maybe stay near cover if you can‚Äôt handle getting erentil‚Äôd.

Damn you deserved the ace, but technically only a 4K
---
Like what? Its literally their job to moderate the sub, what else could they be looking out for? Deleting low effort spam posts seems like a basic duty of a moderator, and considering the amount of trash gameplay that gets dumped on this sub, it seems like it should be a high priority for the mods.

Elite skins or the pro league sets
---
&gt; But matching by MMR is useless when it only takes you to play with frend 10 matches and you are in plat
---
That's all it takes right? Just two friends playing ten games?
---
&gt;I won 6 out of 10 and got placed in Plat III now what about i was new to siege like the low levels
---
You do realise your starting mmr is based on the previous season?
---
&gt;they play few games got into gold 2-1 and than they are ruining others players stats because their skill is equivalent to bronze.

Want to make up any more scenarios?

You want the full Clip?

All of these ones are in casual, but since then I've gotten some clips in ranked. Maybe a part 2 later ü§î

brace yourself
---
Thank you bikini for contacting Blitz. It‚Äôs truly a worthy cause
---
Nah, you just proved that you camp for high KDA, lose and never top frag
---
I would definitely suggest switching to pc if you can. if your building it yourself (which id recommend) you should visit r/buildapc
---
Find other people who are low Silver so you can play with people at your own skill level and hopefully rank up. Queuing with your friend will just lead to him having to carry you or you drag him down and lose.
---
Dealing with a blitz is ridiculous, any shield at that matter is ridiculous to deal with Including Blackbeard and Clash.
---
Good! Hope it was ranked haha
---
Yeah fuck you all honestly you fucking peasants these communities on Reddit are fucking dumb as bricks and kiss Ubisoft's ass.
---
Hey thanks for the advice. Do you know how much it costs? 
---
And my channel link is here 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiLWCpq1HO69PTLX_DIJhUw
---
So you did do something
---
Lmaoooo
---
Yes, but this situation isnt set up. Its a very specific situation. Its the core gameplay situation. This is what the gameplay breaks down to, two players, aiming at eachother, and pulling the trigger with different weapons. 
---
No, assuming perfect aim is not a mistake. You can make any weapon appear balanced (or unbalanced) if you compare its optimal ttk to another weapons non optimal ttk. 
---
Both players have the same aiming ability, since they are identical players. This premise was precisely described in the situation. Because again, when you compare two unequally skilled players, you can make any weapon look overpowered or underpowered or balanced.
---
You have a will to live?!
---
Keep making excuses for why you have a 1.5 buddy.
---
Let me guess, you roll with a six stack and think dropping 30k is impressive on a bunch of trash solo queuers? You crack me up. Youd have a .5 if you played solo for a day. Keep relying on that coil.
---
Just chillin
---
Why would they. Using a controller is such a disatvanage it's what they use when they crab walk down inferno with dualies. That's how useless using a controller is in pro league
---
Not the first time I got raped by blitz
---
Could have been with her smg or shotgun
---
No not natively. Usually using MnK on Xbox is frowned upon, and is considered cheating since the game doesn't support it.
---
Do you have a license for that window
---
Ahah Xbox, le comedy genius has arrived

---
I was curios about
---
Thx for the response
---
&gt; Yes, but this situation isnt set up.
---
You've specifically described a situation in which you say ROF makes the difference. That's set up.
---
&gt;This is what the gameplay breaks down to, two players, aiming at eachother, and pulling the trigger with different weapons.
---
And the difference is down to who can aim better.
---
&gt;No, assuming perfect aim is not a mistake
---
Why would you assume perfect aim? It's moronic.
---
&gt;Both players have the same aiming ability, since they are identical players.
---
Which isn't perfect aim. If they truly are identical players then they will trade.
---
&gt; This premise was precisely described in the situation
---
Your situation is constructed so that the difference is ROF. It's dishonest.
---
Khazirax_, you have some of the WORST elo‚Äôs for someone with 55 days played, you always camp and never come first. KDA means nothing if your not helping your team at all. I top frag most games and have WAY HIGHER elo‚Äôs (check on Khazirax_, or my reddit posts), so imo helping the team win is more important than camping for stats
---
No problem :)
---
First you rank faster so you reach the rank that reflects your skill. You keep going up and down around that rank and if after 100 matches you are a certain rank why should 3 matches influence your rank a lot? Past 100 matches you kept rotating around a rank. 
---
The ranking system is designed for balanced matchmaking, it helps not to think about your rank as something you achieve. Tho I understand that a lot of people do
---
Played 200 hours on pc since switching in April after playing 900 on PS4, and my aim on pc is far better

You're silver 3 stfu

The other day I got a ranked glitch where I could see all stats in the match.

Big flexer. I feel like you can't have an attacking main as what you need varies differently on a site to site basis.

the easy solution is preventing unrankeds from queueing with rankeds ( maybe plat 3 or greater) until they finish their placements lol

U r missing 7
---
No yeah they were in the maps in the ranked pool it‚Äôs just the rotation is terrible I played back to back tower or fort and it would just burn me out cause I never get to play maps that I want instead just the same 4
---
This post breaks the sub rules btw dumbass
---
Was just informed
---
How would this break the game? You're making him into a high risk pick. I realize some of what I said could be crazy, but if one recruit was allowed per side with locked speed based on primary then would it be good? My main concern isnt recruit being weak, its gadgets not being strong enough because of their gun.
---
Terrible, but funny lol. ‚ÄúYou play Bandit now‚Äù
---
Was it called?
---
i dont understand, she saw the charge, was she trying to melee ? if she kept the shield up she would be okay
---
They're going to make a dent definitely but those will always be around.
---
Yo, your health was nice at one point
---
House they took out only 2 seasons ago out of ranked, and tower I played the most in ranked last season in phantom so much so I hate it
---
Again you're missing the point, ugh, it's not that hard to understand...
---
This just happened to me with buck, same window, and same kill. This is sketchy
---
You do realize that glaz's scope is his gadget, not his gun. Also I dont think glaz's gun would even be first used lol. Its semi auto.
---
Beautiful
---
Google translate says it means "to fuck" and as a non Russian speaker, I'll trust it
---
My main objection was the dynamic balancing - guns should behave consistently and not have more or less recoil, rate of fire, or whatnot just because you took off armor. That sounds bad, both because of the difficulty and trying to code it.
---
That was about 10 months ago before i was white listed
---
Completely justified kill, however as usual a bit unlucky for you.
---
Should've been formed as soon as he bopped in that window
---
Only balancing with the guns would be attachments
---
Your not wrong. Some religious use it for spiritual reasons. Let‚Äôs honestly be real though. It wasn‚Äôt for that reason lol. And yes people are sensitive.
---
I, I feel like I‚Äôm gonna get, *spawn-peeked*
---
It looks like you flicked coffee on a white PS4
---
killcams being bad?
---
i hate clash so much and the fact that you have to go for insane wacky wombo combos to win any 1v1 with her. so op
---
That‚Äôs a ugly ass skin you have lol
---
In the clip the emp didn't have an effect on it, guess he was too far away
---
I know, for me it is somewhat fixed when I lower graphics, but it‚Äôs still disappointing that I have to play on Low because Ubi can‚Äôt fix the bug. I hope they fix it soon.
---
Wait have the shotguns been buffed? I heard they were but I didn‚Äôt see in the patch notes.
---
I'm always unlucky I despise this game so much all day I've been losing I havent Won a single match today!

Is it 165 native refresh rate or overclocked? Double check its overclocked in your monitor settings.
---
i have a 144hz native with 165hz OC - my settings are 165 in the .ini file, in game display settings are - display mode: full screen, refresh rate 165.00hz.
---
Is siege detecting 165 in the in game settings?
---
First they need to make system like csgo have, it called overwatch no one have time to record some fuck that glitch and send that to support and then they dont do nothing. Answer is yes
---
A lot of ember rise stats are messed up. I messages them and they fixed it
---
Not damage wise, their shots are just more consistent
---
Rouge9 tested them. In laymans terms they‚Äôve made the pellet spread more consistent so you‚Äôre more likely to hit centre mass. 
---
So after using Nokk‚Äôs shotgun I was able to two shot people in most cases, or at least down, from a decent (but close) range
---
For the last three hours we have just been repeating the same arguments. Im not saying what Ive already explained again. You continue to ask the same questions, that have already been answered. Considering amount of information in this thread, any reasonable person who looks over it should be able to see past both of our biases, and make a decision on who is right.

I think we both made ours points.

Now bye bye.

It's a 1tb extension, that's just what they look like

And as a Russian speaker, I don't

Huh... neat.

Thank you, both of you.
---
Ok
---
One more and then I need to do real life stuff.
---
It would make certain ops completely irrelevant.
---
Whats the point of picking monty if you can go 3 speed shield?
---
Also, since no one plays recruit unironically anymore, itbwould just make recruit rushes unnecessarily difficult to deal with.

Not gonna lie, that‚Äôs kinda epic

Tbh doesn't happen that often in my experience with it so far. It's much rarer than in casual. Especially if you have a full squad

i dont like u for this stupid ass post
---
Was playing sledge Myers and home boy did that 3 times to himself trying to chase people around
---
Nothing super crazy. Just looking for recommendations
---
Why leave any comment in the first place? Tried to hurt my fragile feelings? k
---
No I don't agree. In any coordinated, high ranked scenario, even a 5 stack recruit with aldas and 5 stack recruits with f2s would die to a well set up  defense because they simply don't have any utility to counter anything. Literally nothing. You have no emps, no detection gadgets, no distanced breaching, no hard destruction, nothing. Absolutely nothing. Siege doesn't revolve around gun play only. That's why any well coordinated team will only have one dedicated fragger. And that fragger has some solid utility to help his Fragging and disrupt defenders, like frags+hammer, or breach rounds, or grenade launcher. What does recruit have? A silly looking balaclava, and that's it.
---
Under no circumstances would I even want a fully loaded f2 recruit on my team because that would be a 4v5.
---
People that frag with twitch will just move to Fragging with iq or ash. That's it. One would be a total dud if he ignores twitch for her utility and plays a f**king recruit for the f2.
---
Get somebody you want to play. Watch videos of them all. Therussianbadger has great videos on every op and they‚Äôre both informative and funny
---
That's some pro league tactics right there
---
Yes it was.  I had a higher win ratio on fortress
---
She‚Äôs not underrated, or underpowered for that matter, there is just almost always someone better you can pick.

If the question contains word "still" then I'm clearly not asking about game mode that never had bans to begin with.
---
Unless it temporarily got bans and then they reverted that change, but I highly doubt it.
---
Ubi takes forever to change ops anyways, this way we just don‚Äôt have to deal with them while they‚Äôre broken. Ubi see‚Äôs which ops are banned all the time and which ones need a change. This just prevents people from abusing them

I agree. The purpose of the FMG-9 buff is to mostly buff the damage of it while suppressed. I don't want them to buff its non suppressed damage too much and inadvertently buff Smoke which is why I'd rather her get a better gun entirely. It's just so damn frustrating trying to kill a 3 armor op at mid range.

*How do you feel after chewing 5-Gum:*

He had maestrodom on
---
Castle doesn‚Äôt need a buff

Yup
---
Yeah but i am level 38 and im not a pro. I just liked this so i posted itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Define toxic. Usually I am the one who tries to be nice to everyone and stop conflicts but whatever
---
If u weren‚Äôt lazy enough look could look at the comment thread you could see yourself being confused and illiterate and thinking I was taking about hip fire. When I was only referring to the reticle.
---
thats me every round
---
Check out my 1v4!
---
The point isnt to be competitive but to let sweaty people play recruit for the gun like many do for twitch. This allows for twitch to have her utility buffed. I understand that recruit for most would suck but the goal here isnt for him to be competitive, it's to allow for everybody to be happy with the balancing.
---
just gonna point out that u sound like a very unpleasant person to be around. thank god u dont play the game anymore.
---
Way to many Hallways, I hated the map once I lost my bunk bed spot in dorm
---
Too much fucking lens flare
---
This is an old repost
---
You can post a link?
---
I've had that happen to me one match when I was interrogating people as Cav.
---
How did you get those siege icons by your name?
---
That‚Äôs sick. Nice emblem too.
---
You can stop worrying about erasers now...
---
yea lol
---
To be quite honest, I'd rather not see any pack rewards on this reddit, unless it's actually a brand new item just added that hasn't already been posted.

you when you post stuff on reddit: STONKS ‚ñ≤

What? The PS4 has always had 2.5 drives. By "tiny drives", do you mean the original 500GB ones? Does your friend not realize that it takes one screw to replace?

Cool.
---
I think his shield is a better use for me than the impacts, as I usually take shotgun.  Smg-11 is more than viable for anything but super long range, and the shotgun provides good utility and works great against rushers when the smg-11 is empty.
---
Boo no killcam
---
"How do you do fellow kids?"
---
Ela, like end of season.
---
No, you did not say the exact same thing.
---
I was just looking at that lol, and I'm not impressed my my 5k at all
---
Can they give me an operator I don‚Äôt have
---
"I bElOnG iN dIaMoNd" lol git gud my man. Actually no, you'll never accomplish anything in this game and you'd be better off getting rid of it rather than giving yourself hope.
---
Its the BLACK ICE PRO LEAGUE SKIN
---
Literally trying to defuse this guy who keep telling me to kill myself over a discussion about smurfs. Says a lot.
---
Yea kinda it has different colors and has a bit of gold parts on it
---
Yes, thats meant to last. He‚Äòs glued onto the Power Supply Cover.
---
The Surface of that CPU never exceeds 60 desgrees celsius, there is absolutely no Chance that this will get damaged because of the heat of the airflow.
---
You could only get it when buck and frost came out dude.
---
Oof
---
Nice tracing
---
Some context guys, this person traced someone else's art , there's no problem with that but at least give the original creator some creddit, and if you get caught atleast own up to your mistakes unlike this guy
---
Cool
---
think whatever you want
---
 Nah you clearly shot him in the lower jaw, not a headshot

Add some color and its perfecto

Go to the subreddit page click on the 3 dots in the top corner and select change user flair

Thank you kind sir.
---
Hahahahaha you‚Äôre trash. Plain and simple. I‚Äôve heard this so many fucking times in my life playing competitive games it‚Äôs actually hilarious. You‚Äôre shit tier, they‚Äôre shit tier. You may know a little bit more about the game then them but your skill level is still the same, if not just slightly better. This feels like a troll post so I‚Äôm not gonna go too hard but yeah, you suck. Get better and you won‚Äôt be playing with and against copper and bronze players.
---
Its pretty fuckin rare
---
Indeed but he can still recover from flashbangs... Could be something recruit cant do... He can interrupt a ying rush
---
that face camera tho
---
I thought so I see no one running around with it
---
You're welcome
---
They were like that every single round, anytime someone died that's all they did
---
Is it weird that I found that really cute?
---
these would be decent bans on coastline
---
Yeah a bit annoying. Unless you‚Äôre up close then it‚Äôs a nice advantage
---
i'd be on a whole nother level of mad if I dropped 26 kills and lost
---
10 points for style
---
Impossible

Under certain circumstances.

What do you mean skating around as ash
---
And how do some people have multiple flairs good sir? I'd like my main on attack to show up as well.
---
it's usually firerate for me. low ROF i use reflex, basically everything else has holo with a few exceptions
---
Usual bans for me are jackel blitz cav and lesion
---
As the person that is usually last alive I disagree with this idea. Half the rounds I play  I'm last alive in a 1 v X scenario. If you want constant action go play a game with respawns.
---
I love when a whole group keeps killing 1 guy to make him leave. Seriously WHY?

Hello BeterBorman, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/db03pf/r6_sucks_today/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Put them away from the objective so they‚Äôre less likely to be checking for them. But then again having a few right on objective can be good later on when they‚Äôre panicking and rushing doorways potentially with low health.
---
Big yikes
---
I want to kill you and also marry you now
---
this is probably the rarest skin in the game
---
That‚Äôs the only reason you should play Amarillo, I killed a top fragging Lesion like that once and it made my day
---
For what
---
hot
---
Then buy either take the other advice I was gonna say buy zofia if u have less attacker and vice versa
---
I don‚Äôt think so cuz they have the pro league team skins and stuff
---
Why does this look so strange? Is this a low setting or something?
---
and when i try to play unranked i can‚Äôt find a match
---
Warden main????
---
I remember when I jumped out the window on bank throwing my 2 remaining holograms ahead of me and he stole shot the wrong one
---
you can buy those at any point in a season, this was only available for a certain window of time 4 years ago

Bald dude from Brazzers is here! :pog:

One hack from me will kill you quick

Try and hide, your efforts bring only woe

Get hacked kid, your mom's a hoe!
---
no replay. me angry
---
Fun fact: if anyone is doing this to you or your team, if it's a hologram, the "detected outside" alert goes away after 10 seconds, so if it's been more than 10 seconds, its a player
---
Oh dang. I‚Äôd love to work to hit plat but I play casual and have ranked anxiety lol
---
What rank charm is that? why is it black?
---
r e s e a r c h

Time flies brother time flies

Thank you :)
---
It's gold, I think it's just the lighting
---
It's a shame. I hate being voted out because people think I won't meme with them. I have no problem running recruit or running outside but don't switch at the last moment and tk me for it. I was even getting kicked out because of my rank at one point.
---
You can edit your flair by clicking edit flair, choose Doc Flair, then you have to option to add a new chibi or logo
---
I like how instead of buffing Fuze, they just add more ops he can counter.  
---
 (Yeah I know they buffed the time it takes for him to place a cluster charge, but that is barely even a buff with how little it changed.)

Ah thanks

Jason Voorhees true cause of death

He is right about the meaning of the swastika the nazi one is inclined but ranked isnt the place to do that i hate people who troll in ranked

Looks dope af!

I don‚Äôt know if you want to be using tricks from giants lmao
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it
---
It happens sometimes chief
---
Ignore it lol
---
I mean spawn peekers are the main reason my reaction to to shots has gotten much quicker since I started playing
---
Not sure seen it on fb
---
Lol I play hard support and anchor on my team
---
ok this is epic.
---
This belong ln r/Shittyrainbow
---
I agree with your title but coastline isn't shit, it's in PL for a reason
---
Tbh I not really into mini anymore. Like his meme streams are alright but him leaving the main group changed him a lot
---
Yeah, don't know what the hell OP is talking about with coastline
---
Buck buff leaked?
---
It would be the end of the world
---
The person who was blown up was a Tachanka. On tachankas side is Kapkan, the person who puts lasers on doors that explode when triggered. For some reason, his trap exploded when triggered by his teammate, so basically he was teamkilled but it was the games fault.
---
Edit: Actsully, the person who died was a Kapkan themselves!
---
This means his own gadget thought he was an enemy and killed his creator lol!
---
Doc is good tho
---
The new defender helps fuse more than his team
---
Me neither I can easily go off on coast line but I do agree sky scraper must go

Hello FMBE-x, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/db1bc0/httpsyoutuben8lakrdcuvs_this_is_a_yt_video_me_and/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
all three including red symbol
---
I actually just saw that guy get banned earlier today too, that's pretty funny
---
The thing about that though, is that it almost always never works that way. As long as the problem guy has one friend on his side, or heck your team obviously doesn't want to go down one person to deal with your personal problem it won't lead to solving the problem with the toxic player because they won't be kicked, and they'll get rid of you for attempting a revenge kick.
---
Did he just hack to win, wow this guy needs to get banned asap
---
What just happend?
---
Yes indeed
---
Doc is a very effective operator if in the hands of someone who wants to support his team instead of trying to kill everyone himself. Warden is weak as fuck.
---
No idea then
---
This is an age old mechanic in the game btw, never plant on hatches for further reference.
---
Sometimes is do be like that
---
I haven‚Äôt had too many toxic encounters in ranked but one time this guy and his three friends team killed me every round and then made fun of me for having no kills, all because I took defuser
---
Make sure you never leave don‚Äôt give into them!

You are holding them hostage too by not leaving - nice!
---
Theme park is out of rotation until next season.  That‚Äôs all I know
---
Coastline is the best.
---
But but it‚Äôs not her main gun. It‚Äôs like if they gave fuze a skin for his lmg or shield instead of ak, if they were in the first position on his loadout. It‚Äôs the same thing for Ashe, except they made an exception I believe because of how much better the r4c is
---
This gave me some undiagnosed disease
---
KOBE
---
Ah...interesting.  Don't be surprised if it goes missing, might just become a Vigil main now lol
---
A, cuz you‚Äôll lose the game... if you don‚Äôt choose it.
---
They're all gone for now.
---
Oh ok, but why is out of rotation? Is it getting a rework?
---
Well played fellow Turkish friend ^^

Nope, search thanos on the searchbar, just a clip exactly like this but on villa

Sorry for the mistype I the title. It's supposed to be "Doc and IQ. I used the operator pics as a reference
---
What region and rank
---
It‚Äôs kinda hard for me to choose. Still can‚Äôt make up my mind since I don‚Äôt want to waste my hard earned renown
---
Its just cause what most people find appealing about siege isn't just open map aim dueling, which is essentially what spawn peeking turns the game into.
---
Depends if it is a real 5seven no if it's airsoft yes
---
Lurker here. How u guys feel about people who spawn kill? I hate it myself but it looks look it's still a thing. 
---
I remember when they added 5 second timeout or something but even that wouldn't stop them.
---
lol
---
O

What rank are you
---
[here is why that is ](https://i.imgur.com/WA87tFK.mp4)

[Talk shit bout me boy warden again and he won't be there for you like he was for me during match point ranked &gt;:(](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-XZNfnDMnE)
---
Yeah, I love how they don't even mention the red dot while I fucking hate anything else.
---
Ive quit siege because of the horrible ranking systems so i moved to dead by daylight which also has hitbox errors and a bad ranking system but in my opinion its better at the moment
---
Yeah same map, same operator, similar timing, but his video was funny.
---
I‚Äôll put the turret in the most common entry point for attackers and then roam. The turret doesn‚Äôt do anything but it kinda throws people off seeing it in a weird spot
---
Many ppl are asking about this type of Playlist/changed,I‚Äôll love so that it can be easier to solo q without qu√©ing with a 5 stack
---
But a plat 3 can still play with a silver1, they definitely need to tweak the system.
---
Sorry if my responses are Spacey. I am grilling some burgers at the moment.
---
I don't have any problem with spawn killers (except where you died instantly while you spawning). It's high risk, high reward. You can get free kill or been a free kill, like this guy. He had no idea how he's gonna die.
---
For supper?
