I mean you can downvote me IDC in the slightest but this is like on par with something my 6 year old cousin would draw in like 10-15 mins.

How this took you...more than that is mind boggling.

Dont quit your day job for something in art thats all Im saying

Who do you main?

Send a video for Ubi.

---
She still ugly af not an opinion, my hibana has looked the same for 4 years idk who dis new op is.
---
Still think this is kind of a stupid proposal, and personally it's not insanely hard to do away with shield ops; it's just risky and annoying as hell. I think maybe a reduction in MELEE speed would be welcome, and allow for attackers to counter it much easier, but there are better ways to deal with this than "let's get these hunks of metal to fuck right off"
---
Ah, well, apologies, just fired off a quick comment without looking at the whole thread.
---
Is this how console is all the time?
---
yeah thats what i bought the first time. a little outdated but still, it would take weeks to afford it, considering I have bills and get little to no hours, but I'm trying to get another job atm. I wish I knew someone who could help me with my current PC \*wink wink\*
---
Maybe: used to show that something is possible or that something might be true
---
I dont know, thats why I said maybe. Its first time happened to me and did not happen later. So yeah best thing I can say is maybe. 
---
Uhmm yeah that's what I'm saying 
---
Yes you have to keep going the trophy is sorta glitched due to the situations counting towards it when it’s not suppose to. I got it after around 120.. 
---
Only two options: The boot or the TK. Had to be done 
---
“I’m a little Mozzie, short and stout...”
---
Holy shit didn't know they ran that expensive. Why couldn't she just carry the stock version?
---
Jackal is 51 now so figure that one out
---
I can't see pulse being tall. Unless he's lanky af.
---
I would think he'd be like 120 lbs.
---
You’re in trouble, mister.
---
Honestly I run holo instead of acog anyways. So It wouldn't bother me lol. But I'm also a trash console player so
---
lol. you actually realy did!
---
They’re still in and the P90 one is cheap as hell. 1k renowned without the season pass.
---
Thank you so much. Wasn’t sure anywhere else to get the answer.
---
Cheers mate. 
---
I care and so does OP. Ubi cares enough to implement it and cater to identity politics. You care enough to defend it.
---
I can also play a game and appreciate some parts of it and dislike and criticise other parts of it. Because I'm not that one-dimensional.
---
Nice
---
I'd pay triple for this year's season pass if that were the case
---
Shame on me
---
Shame I'm from the UK, maybe someone in the states you could try?
---
I never planned to, and I draw because I like to. If you think you cousin can do better then by all means like your cousins drawings better. I was also working on it within the like 2 mins of free time I had at the end of my classes. My point was if you dont like it just downvote and go you dont need to comment on it because it wont change anything 
---
they are still in 
---
Already have, but thanks. The vent also actually hits a secure area as well, the "Office" objective/bombsite is what it lands on. If you're a defender just look right above the desk in the room and you'll see the vent.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why do I always get vote-kicked as soon as I enter a game, like Jesus Christ it’s fucking casual 
---
Yeah, it would suck to be bodyslammed by a shield boy, but it is far from lethal.
---
Anyways. Yes please. Especially monty, his melee is broken as shit. Needs a 1-2 second delay from when you're in mountain mode.
---
Other than that, they need a slow as shit ADS and to be slow.
---
(And for fucks sake change blitz's ability, it's fucking broken as shit on principle.)
---
They already can’t figure it out how to release ranked gamemode for 3 years. Some fancy physics/scripts for looping there will kill already unstable game for sure. 
---
dokkaebo fanart i **cant** fap to? this angers me
---
Sometimes but rarely a game will become corrupted during download. In this case steam will reinstall the whole game. This is the only thing I can think of. Sorry man, looks like your in it for the long haul...
---
This. Exactly this, I have two accounts because it gives me two attempts at a rank but also if I’m having a bad day then I can swap to my lesser account without having to worry about MMR. Having a smurf doesn’t make me toxic it just makes the game less pressured 
---
They’ll never give you paid currency for free.
---
She ain’t fat... she thicc
---
[But what about raptor legs...](https://youtu.be/u9-GrUNELP0) 
---
its amazing! I love it
---
its a joke you dumb twat
---
Youd think the third player would reconsider
---
I wonder if that person can even consistently shoot the final trap, or if he'd just end up teamkilling because theyre in the way
---
Lol
---
How did you fit 10 ranked games in little over 24 hours
---
I deadass dont get their logic behind renown, its a soup of messy overpricing, jeez
---
You can knife on favela
---
It’s cause it’s a birthday event for the operators. And because we’ve had dog tags we now get the weapon skins
---
I’m waiting 
---
This seems so cayde-ish,shame he's gone
---
This happened t ok ne too
---
I'm having the same problem so thank you
---
I just think the actual swing needs to be slower, but a delay before meleeing after an ability would be welcome as well. I think blitz should definitely have a delay in melee after it's [he/she?] ability is used, and the ability itself needs to not be super effective
---
It’s funny how hacking drones with mozzie doesn’t count as destroying them. Someone check what happens if defender destroys hacked mozzie’s drone, will it count for challenge?
---
youre the one fantasizing about some stupid character in a game. try different jokes, it’s not funny anymore. Maybe a different approach loser
---
Yall are degenerates, she ugly as hell now wtf how can anyone prefer that over old hibana, elite looks fine but she looks like they barely tried in picture and in game 
---
I just finished Stardust crusaders for the first time recently, fucking loved it
---
Super cinematic tho
---
They crippled that gun 
---
Exactly my point, i predicted the movement of the enemy wrong which caused me to die but that is my mistake. I was just confused how did i die while he wasn't looking at me
---
Were you not around when you couldnt go under the cabinet on Kafe?
---
Lol, mine at one point hit 1,141 days. That was on Uplay... On Steam, for those that have never seen it, at that point just says:
---
"More than a year.."
---
Yeah but most of our food, gas and other common items are measured in metric. Height and weight is the only exception, and on government ID and stuff even those measurements are in metric. 
---
I got tk'd for no reason other than using the new ops, we lost the match because of it, too
---
Hello SonnyBoy32, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ayjhjx/about_the_new_op_glitch_not_showing_ip/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Thank you!
---
They shot you? 
---
Adidas track pants, a tight tank top that shows his God bod and his basic helmet or something 
---
No confirmation on when, but possibly midseason or next season. 
---
It still counts when you catch them
---
Yeah, they were Hiding under a dead body
---
Tower isn’t in ranked dumbass
---
OMG I have not played the new math yet but I saw this and instantly assumed it was a loop for the drones, WTF?
---
I don't have any patience for rude fucks like him who does he think he is. lil bitch can troll all he wants and he'l get owned
---
I can see that being a valid concern. However, she’s a one speed op. All she has is her gadget. Nerfing her gadget would make her legitimately useless
---
R.I.P Jager’s acog never got to play with it but it looked fun af
---
Ubisoft will remember that 
---
kill yourself, smurfs are for faggots
---
So what you are asking for is for the map pool from pro league? 
---
I highly doubt Ubi has any political or social justice agenda and if they do I do not think they are trying to advance it with Rainbow 6 
---
This... this... is a real reply... 
---
No problem
---
I mean in casual. The only thing I play.
---
When see food
---
I have this to they will fix it soon I hope 
---
Because her guns are bad...she is simmilar to fuze imo, one of the best guns, good gadget but slow af, and therefore underpicked
---
Eh, I’ve played a good 7 or 8 rounds on the new map today. If anything, the game feels like it runs better for me. I’ve only been playing discovery, though, so who knows.
---
*Horrible*
---
I mean you knew full well that there are some lacklustre legendaries, and epics for that fact. Its a lootbox, you get good stuff, and you get bad stuff. Plus to others, myself included, I would be happy with that headgear as I think it looks good. 
---
*to use the gun you must be the gun*
---
It works anywhere, but you can only see what everyone else can see during the mvp area so there's no point doing it anywhere else.
---
To reiterate, whatever you're vaulting over is where you'll be standing when the mvp screen shows
---
Tower is in casual though map preferences only effect terrorist hunt 
---
Its all good, I am on cellphone too btw!
---
This season is very polished, lol? 
---
Everyone but you likes four. 
---
no im kidding
---
That’s odd, BECAUSE I HAVEN’T PLAYED IT AT ALL
---
I think he should have one for an Australian icon
---
The Shock Drone would be a blast in there. Just zapping all the other drones lol
---
So am I
---
Everyone assumed the ranked map pool would be Pro League maps this season since next season is when they introduce the pick and bans in ranked. No reason to have unbalanced maps in ranked anymore.
---
You had to buy the season pass before March 4th
---
Product placement*
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/yVEjonN
---
Did I read that right?
---
Isn't it only for the people that bought it before a certain date?
---
what maps are unbalanced in your opinion, and how would you fix it ?
---
It's eh to me because I already had weaboo yecko bundle. I wish there was a "Black Market" That you could trade with others. 
---
This happened to me in several games but everything was running fine
---
This sub would erase Blitz from the game if it actually had that type of power so that's clearly not true.
---
And continuous failures to match make too. 
---
I loled. This happened to everyone on my team picking ash for almost 6 games.
---
Wish I could do it but my game crashes after I select anything on the home screen after the update
---
Aw dang. :( I didn't know that. 
---
LMAOO
---
They should be cameo'd in CGI shorts, not ops, since canonically I think they all retired after R6 shut down and got reinstated in the Siege storyline.
---
That happened to me earlier, I wasn’t even on a drone yet I went under a desk and he just kept flipping
---
Because balanced operators don’t need to be tweaked. If it ain’t broke, than don’t fix it.
---
Can Relate. 
---
Valk is punching the air rn

That challenge is so hard while Mozzie is stealing all the damn drones.

Shut up.

I don't know! I'm on Xbox and the last 3 matches I've played there's been team killing on both teams, and in one of the matches I got killed by two guys only because they were 2-0 and I had just joined, Ubisoft needs to stop wasting time "testing" the absurd method they opted for and add a forgive option 
---
As long as it plays when dokkaebi calls him... And cannot be turned off... He just screams "let them come" and it plays loud and proud. 
---
No. We don't need this game turning into a gambling ring like CS. 
---
[Yokai placements](https://r6guides.com/guides/echo-yokai)

I plated in console for a while. Choppy turning is just how it is.
---
Skyscraper, Chalet, Fortress, Hereford, Kafe and Theme Park. Trust me at Diamond these maps are dreaded, they should all be moved to only Casual.
---
Some secrets are better left unknown
---
I was having this issue earlier as well where the options dont appear for sale in the loadout, but they are all available in the shop!
---
It said it on the promotion right under it :’( makes the pass that much worth it. I got lucky and bought it at 12am march 4th a d still got the skin
---
What do you want me to do Goobi? Put a camera and watch them as they bleed out on a mat??
---
~~on second thought Ima do that~~
---
I played regular casual and got it 3 times in a row. It works, it’s just a lottery. 
---
I think they do just fine with four I mean did you see how many things they released and put out the last two months

Oak I was a little mad at first, but I laughed it off afterwards, so I wanted to know your opinion on it

Like that person that is killed has the ability to “forgive” that person 
---
Unplayable 
---
I was temp banned wrongfully, I'm currently going through a case ticket with Ubi. 8-time Diamond, never boosted or cheated in my life. 2500+ hour vet, been playing since Alpha. I've also been googling accounts that have received temp bans in the van feed which in no way can possibly be boosted. These accounts are Gold/Silver with .5 w/l and horrible headshot percentages... How can an account with NO WINS be BOOSTED? It makes literally no sense.
---
Too op
---
Although it is annoying we kind of expected this when the playlist got announced at the six invitational 
---
u/its_Epi
---
Glad to help.
---
I wish more operators looked like this practical and tactical none of this anime yoga pants armor pads shit I mean most of these guys are supposed to be tier 1 special forces operators kickin doors and slaming hores not nerdy weebs and double D’s 
---
OMFG lmao.
---
YES
---
Literally unplayable
---
You’re welcome, hoopy is a treasure
---
It’s not funny, it’s true
---
Trials fusion*, theres a sign next to the track that blatantly says the games name
---
how good are you now? If you take a break you may never be able to come back. The skill cap for this game just keeps rising unfathomably aggressively. 
---
Why are you mad?
---
I was really happy getting For Scale ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Why do you say that? Smurfing would be the obvious #1 issue with a playlist like this
---
The wrong path, in your opinion. 
---
[I made a video about this bug.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjdYkE9Bl88)
---
So fucking useless 
---
It’s a fucking game man, chill.
---
There’s also a game called trials rising that was released recently 
---
If you bought this years pass you got the 600 when you bought it. The notification is a bug and is meant to reflect that original 600
---
He was within the normal effective range of shotguns.
---
You didn’t have to be rude about it.
---
I've never seen any r6 character look so smug before now
---
I'm saying that because smurfing before this update is just as bad as it is now. Existing.
---
Yea, it came out with the game 
---
Lmao first thing I tried when I saw it
---
Damn, I sure got roasted. Sad fucking life you live going through people's post history to come up with a roast that dousn't make sense. Ive seen some pretty good console clips to. If their consistently worse that only proves controllers are inferior input devices. You even deleted you original content. Get the fuck outta here.
---
in the death chamber he saw me longer than me
---
Nice job. But they weren’t talking to each other obviously.
---
Not a trap, its a throwable projectile that will hot opponents nearby when midair, direct hits just do more damage. Ill fix it right away, thanks!
---
Have you tried the new playlist to say for sure? It didn’t exist before the update so idk how it could be the same before the update lol
---
YES! HIS EYES BEGIN TO GLOW RED AS THE MUSIC INTENSIFIES. 
---
Yeah but borderless is bad
---
Yep

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepost
---
Did you make sure to add it to your challenges list?
---
It was weird, I played for 6 hours this morning with reshade on. My buddy logged on and neither of us were showing on each other’s friend list so I rebooted the game and then got the reshade error
---
Omg I was just trying to so that 30 minutes ago and hope on reddit and see this
---
I was talking about in general, and yea I could ask one of my friends to go on one of their alt Xbox accounts and see if it will let them in.
---
Yeah best of luck to you too, the toxicity in this game just sucks. And I just bought the Hibana Elite, though I have had no chance to actually play and have fun with it. Overall super dis-encouraging for the future.
---
I hope so but i seem to by dying while facing enemies and my shield is at some fucked up angles on killcam  
---
I don’t think we need to change our lord at all, we are all created in his image
---
I don’t even know what to say about this game anymore 
---
Do I like send them an email or find a mod or something?
---
Tell me about it =\
---
This looks like a low effort meme. Is this seriously real?
---
Because shield ops a sub-class only played by people whose parents never loved them. 
---
Is this a bug or a feature? I honestly don't know. Maybe to prevent certain peeks...?
---
It wouldn’t block him it would just match Smurfs with other smurfs 
---
No more WHAT?!
---
I’m not saying it was destiny. But it was definetly no coincidence that it was Valkyrie that killed you
---
i want a ussr skin at least
---
Cool!
---
That's why half the time i don't even choose the new operators because of toxic players 
---
I did. I knew I wouldn't work without it. But I have it enabled and it's not working
---
Does it actually do that tho?
---
Or? I think you mean and ;).
---
Generally most of the games you are playing against higher ranked players is because the rest of the team is much lower in rank. Some of the problems Ubisoft faces in matchmaking is if a diamond player wants to play with his lower rank friends they will play lower ranked players.
---
That’s what we were discussing and you said there was 0% chance of it existing and so I wondered why you would think that
---
clash
---
I will quit if something like that comes out
---
obvious boosted states here definitely not been gold my whole siege career

---
You can do that on favela as well
---
its okay its on hostage guys
---
naw just a toxic prick
---
And i'm saying theres no way they have a system like that because it's not implemented in the game before the update. AKA just as bad as it has already been before the update.
---
Zarya is basically a jacked male dead lifter, Gridlock is just grossly overweight even by POG standards.

u/itsepi
---
Well... I think you found a bug in the system mate.
---
I think the downvotes are because this discussion of shotgun viability is tangential at best to the original point of the post
---
But every system has a start date, maybe they were testing it in casual and this newcomer playlist is a good opportunity to implement the system. They keep it obfuscated so it’s tough to tell for sure that it’s in place
---
Because this game is on the 4th year of it's existence. It needs money to keep going, and people are glad to pay for it, I guess?

Hello Saedex, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aylrz1/rainbow_6_burnt_horizon_game_freeze_glitch_are/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Youre probably just fortunate enough to play the casual sweats , dont worry youre fine, just unlucky with your matches
---
T hunt classic and only use a single shot rifle or switch your favorite automatic to single fire and aim for the head. That what I do anyway to warm up.
---
Both of them sound OP as fuck 
---
Tactics mean more towards the win. 
---
Yeah a few operators are OP but ultimately a skilled player or team of recruits can take down a team of newer operators. 
---
Additionally, the newer operators have come after years of support. That costs money and a one time sale won’t be sustainable. The season pass is cheaper than buying the in-game currency to purchase characters. The support for the costs is arguably fair when compared to some other games. 
---
Perfectly balanced 
---
Some of these updates arent coming until next season, such as the pick and ban, as of the others I believe that ubisoft isnt 100% sure about implementing them yet.
---
That's what I'm like when I try and fall asleep
---
Saw the reveal during the invitational and thought they were confirmed. Thanks tho.
---
Some skins are launched at a later date as a bundle. 
---
Yeah, it counts.
---
I guess that’s true but I wish that mentality would simply be applied to the skins and other cosmetics - things that don’t directly hinder the gameplay 
---
I’m on Xbox and having the same issue :/ two from yesterday counted but nothing today has

Having the same honestly idk what it is
---
This is the first time that i've ever received the notification and i've been playing since release. I also got it on the TTS and it actually gave me the credits on there. But on the main build there were none.
---
So Vigil is OP? The second one sounds Op but the first sounds manageable. You’ll still hear them move
---
Takes longer for me too
---
So essentially I have to buy Xbox live and then buy siege live to play a game I already paid for. 
---
I get what you’re conveying but I think there are better ways of monetizing. Such as keep high prices for everything that doesn’t affect gameplay such as skins. 
---
Or if you’re gonna make a paywall, make it reasonably low where people can unlock each character after a reasonable amount of matches, such as after 10-15 matches 
---
Well ubi said they are doing a cimplete redesign of him for his rework so that needs to come first i think
---
Thats alot of Renown for a lvl 30

If this game was $15 like csgo or free like other popular games I would agree with your mentality. It’s full price tho

Oh wow that’s a nice feature! I think he is on PS4 though I can barely make out the triangle button. Thank you though I hope sony implents something similar.
---
No one in this game fights 1v1 really. Maverick for example . He make gloryholes and get free kills. 
---
Also shields are already buggy , you can sometimes shoot through them .
---
&gt;Kafe practically has a safe peak on every side of the building, they would have to move the drone so far away
---
Part of the Skylight is covered. Move it so the drive is hidden by that, maybe? I don't actually know the angle there
---
This is happening to me too, does it say SEAU for your data center?
---
Would smash
---
Where do we go to ask about changes they could undo to siege? Like the resetting system? 
---
Front page 
---
They use pistols.
---
And have shield desync and rotation issues.
---
And have to expose their melon to shoot.
---
If this was about BB, I would have fully supported your claim since he is fundamentally broken. But shield ops are fine as is. Not balanced, but not OP either.
---
Monty is used extensively in PL as ultimate support, blitz is used by LATAM as the moving, walking drone. In a coordinated squad, shield ops are fine. Either play trap ops, or coordinate with your team, or learn to flank. They aren't hard to counter.
---
bump, same issue.  
---
5960x with a 1080ti.
---
r/rimjobsteve
---
I like them , not they are not thay OP (maybe gridlock). Please ubi dont nerf em.
---
Yep.
---
We always knew.
---
If you buy complete edition, you only get dlc ops now and have to unlock base ops, so it’s possible.
---
Yes
---
While we're on the subject, could someone enlighten me as to why valkyrie can combine elite for MVP animation, apparently, but hibana can't? 
---
 It was actually valkyrie's animation that inspired this idea, in the first place, now I'm sitting here, looking like a chump, with my elite skin that I don't really want to run over my Halloween skin, because of approximately the difference in the headgear.
---
 *I'm also not good enough to be worrying about MVP animations, so that isn't too big of a loss.*
---
I got a whole team this way lol. In ranked too. Idk why they all picked the same spawn or got back on the drones. I was unranked most were low sliver.

i believe there is one on coastline as well. on the right of the front entrance but i’m not sure

Yep, game's fine, your aim is a different story, however 
---
There are different sizes in Uplay launcher versus Steam (Uplay is larger).  I believe it has to do with how the clients are compressing the files.  With the HD textures, it increases the size even more.

Blitz is very competetiv at low-lowhigh Player Levels the best things you can do is Blitz is to focus on a single target, single them out blind them and finish them. After Plat  i wouldnt recommend him anymore because people counter him easier at that level but at low-Plat3 go for it :D But dont forget your not a killing Truck dont forget to stay tacitical :D wish you luck

Anyone else experiencing a sound bug where all of the sound is coming from extreme left and right ? (i.e. no sound from the front. Everything sounds as if it's over extreme right or extreme left). I started experiencing it after the outback update (7th march '19) and don't know if it's a computer issue or a game bug. 
---
Ps : Sorry for a random question in this post. I just don't know where to ask this. Please notify me a place where I can put up this sound issue, I have recorded a video. Thanks in advance.
---
Her hair isn't straight nor brunette either though, right?
---
I never understood this. They're only hurting themselves.
---
Other countries when they find out Australians eat kangaroos:

Wait, that’s illegal!
---
I'm mildly concerned about gridlock, she seems a little *too* extra what with the like 14 spike pads per trax but so far everything seems great!
---
I'm gonna make a subreddit for this. r/badaim lmao
---
Really?! Thanks so much for telling me!
---
Sounds good lol
---
Np g... it’s under gadget deployment 
---
Imagine getting triggered by fucking pixels 
---
The downsized the whole entire game size. Instead of it being 74 gb it's 36gb. Its like installing a brand new game.
---
What do you mean?
---
wow
---
You made me chuckle. Have an red orange arrow
---
Meme Team. 
---
Thx!
---
Smoke has impacts dingus. All alibi has going for her is a mediocre SMG without recoil. Her gadget is practically useless. 
---
Why doesn't she need impacts? First and foremost, to spite your ignorant ass. Second, she has a super strong shotgun and a 40rd magazine that would mean surprising groups of enemies from freshly made holes would be incredibly strong. Third, other operators can make holes for her and require team play. Fourth, between her barbed wire and concussions she's able to lock down sectors of a map on her own as it is. Fifth, her gadget is actually strong and she has increased resistance to concussions making Zofia practically useless against her. Sixth, she's a 3 speed and impacts on 3 speeds that have strong weapons with good gadgets isn't a good idea. 
---
It doesn't matter that the whole experience wouldn't change. It would make ela too strong again. If you want to make a reasonable request about ela, such as slightly reducing the horizontal recoil, I wouldn't be too against that. However, giving her back impacts and thus the freedom to run around the map without hesitation again is too much of a buff. 
---
You need to learn how to position yourself better instead of looking for a crutch. 
---
she shot you in the shoulder/top of your head. if you're crouched down that close most ops can hit you there rather easily and your shield wont cover it. 
---
I'll just, save that for latter
---
Thats wat u get for using phone cam, rather than the screenshot/share (on consoles) button.
---
Just dive into it? Well, I guess it can't be any worse than how I play now. Thanks
---
She’s not even holding her shield!
---
Do u like ppl stealing your kills?
---
From what I know it's not intentional and a "bug" 
---
Also including the skins that come out this year.
---
Just have 2 smurf accounts like me!
---
Omg
---
Other thing I forgot that is crucial: without a pair of headphones, I can’t hear voice chat, which makes a vast difference in team plays
---
a team that beat the champs on a map. hehe yikes.
---
Shiiit now I want one
---
But the ak-12 doesn't have a mag...
---
Taking away her acog is enough this is abuse 
---
I sometimes just wanna hop in with my main. I only got one smurf

Not sure why you're getting downvoted, in the old days of XBL you used to have to pay for every account's gold subscription. I had no idea they changed it since then.

Awesome in-depth reply. Thank you so much. I feel my map knowledge is pretty good but can always use some improvement on certain maps, and my call outs can be improved as well, and that's before stepping back and looking at everything as a while. Appreciate this so much. 
---
She is just putting her back against the wall and saying "Fuck you" to the team. So toxic

Upvoting for relevance. The wording is unclear on this tbh, plus we don't know what the charm looks like :/

Wow. Insecure much, OP? Why would u even want to bully newcomers?

No, they all have the same height in game for balance reasons of course

Any more questions?

It's casual. They don't lose anything from it.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Definitely not, atleast not if you want to start off the season with a good rank.
---
Audio is such a big thing in this game together with teamplay. 
---
That being said, I'd recommand you playing with a 5 stack to get the best out the game. 
---
Imo, get your shit together at first. 
---
Just so you wont lose the fun of the game. 
---
tfw you gain control of a twitch drone from the defending side
---
Ok I didn't mean to say smoke, I meant someone who doesn't have them. My fault on that. It wouldn't make her strong at all. She is a 3 speed, she needs to be around the map. She isn't supposed to be an anchor, she is a roamer. Her gun isn't even that strong. Again, team play isn't a thing anymore. All people want to do is frag. Just kill hungry. I know how to position myself, but it be better for 3 speeds to be able to move around the map. They also need to reduce her recoil by a lot not slightly. When I say a lot I mean similar to the mp5 or bandits recoil. BUT I KNOW WHAT UR GOING TO SAY IN THAT SO it doesn't matter because people like u don't like changes made by others, only by pro league. Look at lion, pros bitch now the community bitches.

I cant really help you, only thing I can say is that a lot of people facing the same problem, I even saw Pengu struggling with it. Maybe Ubisoft will realize and they will do something about it. 
---
Was he inherently a good guy or something? Is there something you know about him where he wasnt a shitty weird human being?
---
I mean, ranked is what you make of it. If you think you are going to be a highly ranked player, yeah wait until you get a good set up. Most people in silver/gold elo won't talk anyways. That being said, you will be putting yourself at a disadvantage with no sound, Can't you get a pair or headphones or even a speaker lying around that you can plug into the TV for audio output. A headset is the best but any audio is better than none.
---
I spelled it correctly 🇬🇧
---
Can your teammates and enemy team see this or just you?
---
🇬🇧
---
Dude. You are absolutely delusional if you think team play is irrelevant. You're the kill hungry one if you are an ash main who also wants ela returned to her launch state. 
---
40rd mag. 1k RoF. Best shotgun in game. She's already got a lot going for her. Get over it, you're not getting your impacts. 
---
Lion was blatantly op to even the worst of players from the get go. He isn't op now, just is super frustrating to play against. He's also fundamentally flawed. If you can't see that then again, you're delusional. 
---
cant shoot a downed ash properly

haters: she ain't got no hitbox

Guess that’s fair, thanks. Also, I’m apparently the only person in my group of friends who likes Siege, so I’m forced to solo it up

"the only thing" that is. We need more plainly broken maps. If you're going to rework it, at least keep the originals around for casual-only maps

Damnit ubi

Similar to the Coast cam in the front, you just need to go on the roof and lay down to knife it

I’ll try to find a pair of earbuds somewhere, if we didn’t break every single pair we’ve ever gotten. Thanks for the feedback

Even if you find out how to fix it, keep it for mozzie. It suits his character very well.

It makes me uncomfortable that red is good and blue is bad

Argh! When ever you get your headset and be able to make call outs or just find someone you like to play with. Send them a friend request, during time people will add you if they'll like your playstyle. No worries about that! 
---
BANDIT!!!
---
thats my favorite thing about the map
---
Definitley not. Not only for your sake but theirs nothing more annoying to people who play ranked religiously than when someone doesnt talk and/or cant hear where enemies are coming from. Tbh you probably wont find many people that wont message you if you die due to sound. Honestly my opinion/suggestion is to just play casual. Keep working on your gun skills and other skills untill you have at least a headset. Audio is number one in ranked and communication close second. 
---
&gt; This means, from now on, any operators mentioned as op, is going to get their acogs removed off their gun. 
---
No they’re going to remove the ACOG if the gun is op with it
---
Ahh yes, the autistic screech.
---
If you seriously think that’s the same I don’t even want a conversation with you 😂🙈

The challenges are usually win rounds in a 5 stack, not matches.

Oh yeah!

Sure , but that's like something we've been asking for since launch so...

All you had to do is place the damn logo right CJ!

We will see. Cautiously optimistic.

i was gonna downvote cuz quality, but i changed my mind after seeing the trick. have your upvote for nice discovery lol

The ADS's job is to counter grenades/missiles/etc . so

just down someone and than kill him with it, still super easy

you can get 25k for a operator in 1  day

Just snooping on this subreddit looking for an answer too, have like 80-90 with a 2700x and 2080. Also have had many crashes recently even before the new update

There's something oddly satisfying about smacking a cam like that, but it's better when you use the but of your gun instead
---
I think of it like Valkyrie cams with extra steps. You place them around the objective to watch high traffic areas where enemies will be. You can watch the drones, your team mates can and if you need watch another corridor, you can simple drive the closest drone to a new spot.
---
Alright I'm back. So it is possible to change but it says it is being used because of Yokais ability and Twitchs drone zaps. You have to set "shoot" on "observation conrol tools" to smth. else like middle mouse button and then you can use left mouse for scanning

You can't use it for both unfortunately. But it makes sense. Because if that'd be the case your drone would shoot everytime you scan

truly an elite animation!
---
In the name of Tachanka, hitbox and holy recruit! Amen 
---
Im just saying that the commonly used phrase "its casual" is a shit defence often brought up in casual.
---
If someone says "ITS JUST CASUAL BRO" you should be allowed to teamkill and throw the game, since you know... its just casual bro. 
---
Simply because you are not used to it. Theres a new button which does same thing 
---
"New" - it was always like that because the Weapon positioning is dependent by the Bearing 9.
---
But Maverick is already Owen Wilson.
---
Asian/chinese servers in a nutshell

I got it from jäger’s wiki page, go look for yourself. It’s the same thing

HAXXXXX
---
Yeah that happened to my friend, he had it installed prior but when the season came out it wasn't installed but he was just able to reinstall the pass.
---
Yeah i certainly have a routine for many maps (not really bank though) like oregon i like to clear top floor, sledge buck ceiling. Or skyscraper I like to thermite gesha, pressure obj window and go from there. I think i should push more, you're right.
---
No, the Skin is part of the season pass which means it should come with it

Its actually one of the better new maps... loads better than fortress and theme park

Well the leaker leaked australia 1 month ago and it was correct on everything :/
---
*Black ice flex intensifies*
---
Yeah it's been happening to me aswell lost 3 ranked games because of it. smh
---
Wow
---
I had a team like this too, except the leader role was split between three of us. They played a lot longer than me (3 seasons) so I listened and learned. One day I was annoyed by secure area and how we failed frequently on defense. So changed my team essentially and joined a clan. Now we play a plat 2 to diamond elo instead of gold 3 to plat 3. The callouts are on point (sometimes xD) and it’s generally not fun to play with people not in my clan because they do their thing and that usually goes bad.
---
Some people don't realise that. Could've been a shoulder shot
---
I love clash. When anything and everything is going wrong, I pick clash and things begin to change
---
Wait. That's illegal.

I started 1 month ago, but you can use impact nades or fire with capitao? I m wrong?

Thats what happens when u play with golds and silvers

Alexander Remy 2 weeks ago in the Year 4 roadmap reveal confirmed it's a female and on the bulletin board in the hammer and scalpal CGI info about her is on the atatck side, the attack symbol is in the lockers Thatcher and Dokkaebi are in as is the Denmark flag so this sounds legit.

wallbang...he likes to wallbang

Thank you

I got the notification but I don't have the season pass
---
I recommend having a solid team who actually knows what they're doing, does your team play call of duty by any chance? They seem to have the gunskill but not the tactical side of it.
---
Yeah it can be especially annoying when you’re playing twitch. 
---
Only need Hibanna's so I'd be cool with that
---
That's my problem. The whole time I've been playing my aim technique has always been a mix of left and right stick, so its very hard to switch out of it. My aim isn't bad but it's not good either, then combine with the less than ideal hit reg on xb1 and it can be very frustrating.
---
I intend to move to PC in the future so when that happens I'll have to relearn anyway but for now...
---
My point exactly.

It's all that snorkling on Yacht that ruined her hands.

I mean we shouldn't judge hard before we see what's going on with them. Couple of weeks ago when this leaker said that the defender will be able to steal drones. People started to yell about making twitch redudant. But it wasn't the case. Twitch still will be Twitch.

Didn't have any idea about that, makes ranked even a bigger joke...

I’ve had attackers shoot my traps as gridlock as well because they thought it would affect them, gotta love start of season ignorance. I always wait 2 weeks before playing ranked to avoid losing because of people doing stuff like this. Hell I’ve even seen a sledge waste all his ammo on my evil eye at the start of parabellum (he also had frags equipped but didn’t throw them at the evil eye).
---
I think we need tutorial videos to show how a gadget works (and advanced tricks like bandit tricking) and there counters, kinda like how for honor has in order to teach new players faster and show how the new ops work.

I'm not sure. But he's still new and the challenges are delayed. So hard to know for people focused enough

How do you get a “ glaz main” as your profile?

there is a clipping issue with almost all the charms on Jager's gun right now

I have no idea, I downloaded the update though, and now the game freezes every time I start a match, can't even go into TH without it freezing

It worked thx have been trying to figure this out since the update.

A lot of the Siege Youtubers seem burnt out by the game. Even the Meme Guys put out pretty half assed videos

When ypu reload it will be shown correctly(he almost holds the weapon vertically

Or just buy it in the time windows they explicitly said it would be available when you buy the season pass...
---
It wasn’t a hidden secret. It’s been this way with every season pass.

If you think this game is so shit, stop playing... otherwise shut up. The season pass gives you enough stuff (not including the low-res “lava” skin)

no

Yes , rn its a big pain in the ass specially on the European servers 
---
I guess it’s because they feel pressured to play it for their fans and for the money, whereas anyone else just hops on when they want and can take as long a break as they want 
---
not if there were separate lobbies
---
There was always some reason. The g36c has an angled grip.

"***What are ya doin' in ma swamp!?***" [defenders leave]
---
I got PC an ps4, I only play on console because all my friends only have a ps4.
---
Even if I could play console with m&amp;k without adapters I wouldn't, because it's cheating.
---
Straight from the top of my dome
---
Why did you shoot him? 
---
Imagine Thermite with the R4-C, damn son.
---
Because it’s console, you’re supposed to use a controller, the only time it’s acceptable to use mnk on console is if you have a disability, other then that you’re cheating
---
I haven’t had (or at least) noticed any problems with Gridlock, but that’s a good point you have there about the video. 
---
Towards the end of Grim Sky I played rank just to get the achievement, and got placed in S2. And since all of my siege friends either stopped playing or was only on casual so I didn’t care about my rank, but para bellum I got place C4 (I was helping one of my new friends play and they were REALLY bad so I got stuck there) took my a long time to get up to silver 3. But yesterday some of my friends and I said fuck it and we wanted to get on rank the first day, so we did and I got placed G3. I then ranked up to G2 so yea maybe those newbies can be helpful (if there on the other team lol)
---
I think its better horizontal 
---
No but actually idk my friends also want keyboard and mouse support which I dont understand why they dont add cuz like u said people can use adapters but it also can be cuz fortnite is cross play to PC so that's why they made it official 
---
Same issue here. Looks like it says win one but they really meant 20 
---
How did this happen?
---
i subbed ahah
---
No idea, never happend to me before... Maybe a burnt horizon feature 
---
Since when is this a challenge 
---
Tell that to the players who is playing with adapters not me 
---
Yesterday
---
Why?
---
Please quote me for when I said they were op. You’re missing my point and your comparisons on of mav and thermite just isn’t making a point. And no, sledge and buck are not the same. At all. 
---
Well bomb is the most played mode and on this mode most spots are balanced
---
But still, I rather have the  certainty of a Twitch drone destroyed than a chance of taking it over.. 
---
Tyre lel
---
because Ubisoft calls its cheating. Which it is. Console is for a fuckin controller. If you want to play MnK., get a fucking computer you noob
---
Please re-read because I never said this.

\*LION'S HEAVY BREATHING\*

I can't belive youve done this

Me too , but i play on pc cuz it's not fair

My rank on ps4 is platinum 3 and 80% of the players are using mouse and keyboard .

Hello MrseCode, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aype6y/petition_for_this_limited_event_idea_for_april/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
i’m still awaiting for someone to shock a downed twitch haha
---
lol this is your 2nd post. How much attention are you trying to get 
---
So sad Ubi messes up a simple mistake
---
I'll buy your entire stock!
---
Alt tabbing can crash your game too, ubi likes to fuck literally everything imaginable up when they release new shit.
---
I took over a twitch drone and then shot the other twitch drone with it, I felt dirty
---
It's also increased slightly on the DBNO state
---
There's 3 comments on this post alone shutting on consoles :/
---
Why? 
---
Is this the April Fools joke, hybrid operators? 
---
Well that's good, because Castle's gun isn't the problem.
---
But yes, you are right. 
---
Not a trading system but you can sell it and get how much you would get from it if you got it as a duplicate 
---
Pro league matches are a lot funner to re watch when your bored then siege streamers I find. Games like apex are funner to watch people stream because of the quick pace, if I watch a siege stream I like watching some lower/unknown plats/diamonds so I can learn some new peeks/strats. Most of the big streamers just get their 5 man and roll on people for a few hours...not really that entertaining IMO.
---
Much more toxic. I got killed every round by my own team, just because I didn't place a mute charge where they wanted it. 
---
The siege community is toxic
---
If you alt tab often, you might want to consider setting the game to windowed (borderless), that way alt tabbing doesn't alter the game window. Might cause a minor increase in latency and/or a drop in framerates, but not particularly noticeably so in my experience.
---
Should've added clash 
---
Give this guy a medal!
---
You can't make me agree to anything
---
Put it back
---
Because this is clickbait.
---
It's rotated by 90° lol
---
Surprisingly they offered no critical feedback other than deal with it.
---
Right when birthday challenges have cool stuff I'm banned for 5 days (one day over the challenge). Karma's a bitch ain't it?
---
No, just do some research.
---
they also like to fix things that are completely useless! best devs ever
---
Something so bad even Donald Trump wouldn't have thought it up
---
Almost as annoying as the one I had halfway between crouching and standing.  
---
You had one job ubisoft.
---
Oh, my bad.
---
?? This is clickbait, it's an affirmation, there are multiple cameras that can be meleed
---
This would work quite well as a skin, I'd buy it.
---
I run the .308 charm on all the small-cal weapons I don’t have a charm for, fits perfectly lol
---
Yeah you're right, i think people arent talking about it because its too on the nose. Like, people who know the reference see it as obvious and therefore dont really feel the need to point it out while people who dont probably wont get it anyway because they havent watched the original mad max.
---
Hence high destructive capabilities, it's a vague term though.
---
Too bad they can’t get Jager’s logo right...
---
And I didnt know that, just downvote and keep scrolling.

I think it came with Grim Sky or Wind Bastion. I got it last season but I’ve got the elite already :(

So thicc but so quiet

It’s not being penalized for playing well, it’s rewarding more competitive playing.

The bar for XP is here ————: a 4-0 game receives that much XP.

More competitive matches, the cost bar is raised to here: ^— ^— ^—

Thank you Dankine, it helps to know that Ubisoft isn't completely oblivious to it's community. This honestly has to be the worst season since operation Health.
---
It does. It actually does. I was wondering if they’d change that challenge and they did not. It’s ridiculous.
---
Or they tried to sneak it in there To see how long it would take us to realise
---
Everything has been fine for me besides ping abusers but thats all
---
Nah i have easy and better idea. Just make mode that you can only choose one operator for all 5 people. Think about it 5 twitch, 5 Clash, 5 fuze...
---
Is there a Tachanka one yet? If not, can we get that one please?
---
At least this shitty sub has stopped making Tachanka jokes..
---
I got an alert that said “thank you for supporting the game since the beginning” got 600 credits and then i had the season pass (ive been playing since beta)

Same here

This is why doki was made

Every game I have been getting queued with freaking monkeys. I had one guy yesterday admit that he was copper for less season and that he plays with the sound system and a controller 😂 like legit just join casual

I was hoping the Bandit skin would have been the Tachanka Elite skin as a middle ground for what we want and what they’d actually do.

I have both season pass so i have to get it.

---
Go to your game downloads and reinstall it. Some people had it uninstalled while getting the new update.
---
How can they always mess up?
---
Yeah this is basically it, the idea between ranked is that it moves you around based on how good you are so if you’re 4:0 a lot because you’re ranked way lower then you should be it shouldn’t make you grind way more. If you 5:4 or something like that that means you are really evenly balanced and you should if anything (Don’t think this is a good idea) gain less elo because you are both likely at the sameish skill level.
---
it could be glitched 
---
Not a bad idea imo, but there's one problem:
---
Electrified shit deal damage on contact, and you need to hit the thing like 10 times to take it down without gadget.
---
If they made it not deal damage to people standing/meleeing against it,  but only destroy gadgets, i'm all for it.
---
I mean hitting the things 10 times in a row is already almost a death sentence in most cases, it doesn't need to literally take all your hp as well.
---
Another problem is Bandit's batteries, anybody could just shoot them out from under it and they shouldn't logically work on windows, the window thing could be made to work tho. 
---
One very nice thing about this change would be that Ash specifically cannot destroy all your shit safely and easily, i mean she gets picked every other round and basically negates Castle with no risk.
---
Rip, thats usually why I play with two other people because people can be stupid af
---
So if you play a flawless game with your squad and win 4-0 you get less than if you were to play amazing for 3 rounds, fuck up for 3 and then claw it back to win 5-4?
---
I get what your saying and I agree that it is more competitive but not rewarding a team for playing amazing really just doesn't make sense to me at all. In that sense, you absolutely are being penalised for playing well.
---
She’s much better now.
---
So main montagne
---
I wish I had too, but sadly only one of my friends plays r6
---
Dokkebi would have the V for Vendetta mask
---
It's ok, Cav is best girl.
---
Also, who thought it was a good idea to make the challenge to destroy 20 drones, when a new operator was just released whose literal ability is to take control of drones. 
---
same here
---
Boa
---
That would just make Twitch even more essential
---
Well I don’t fancy or jerk over video games character. I just have an eye for tease of art. Ubisoft said siege isn’t based on Realism. Bro I’ve lived longer then you, bet your a edgy/ wanna road teenager

In the Garage office, you can throw a nitro on the outside of the vent that drones unusually drop through. If you detonate it while someone is sitting outside on the roof in front of the entrance to the vent, they'll die or take damage. Makes no sense.

yeah idk what’s wrong with it. i can’t even view the operators or store tabs. every time i try change it i just get a message saying currently not available
---
Isn't that their goal, though? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure they said their plan for future ops is to have multiple ops filling the same role so you have choices. Pretty sure that was Year 2 they said that. If I'm not thinking of something else.

woo!!!! feminism!!!!! women are strong!!! LOL!!!!

What I do:

1) Roam a specific area and use his gadget as drone/intel denial
---
2) grab as many drones as you can as set them up as moveable valk cams
---
3) grab an early drone, place the other 2 as drone denial, and use the early drone to drone yourself in as a roamer
---
It's almost like we all haven't seen the main screen before and have had to wait for matchmaking and have had to watch her trying to ..tighten? That same bolt for hours on end and then watch him act like he's 9 years old with finger guns..

Honestly, screw whoever thought these "Do shit with a 5 stack" challenges were a good idea. They seriously need to figure out new ideas for challenges, because I'm sick and tired of destroying 20 drones for someone's birthday.
---
They could at least keep the challenges that aren't a pain in the ass to do, like the Vernal Equinox charm one from last year.

That's because the icon is rotated ya'll act like they did something wrong.

Removing acog from ash wasn't done only as a nerf for her, but as a test to see if removing acogs from attack is a good idea.

It's a wonderful idea, and hopefully it will apply to other operators with strong guns and gadgets like maverick soon.
---
Yes, maybe survive 2 - 3 bullets

I know I’ll get downvoted to hell but

Fuck tachanka. He’s useless unless someone has gotten good with him. People call him the fucking lord because it’s a meme but it’s overused and dead. The moment we give up the meme the moment he gets buffed. Ubisoft even said it. There’s no point in continuing the meme when all it does is hurt tachanka. And then when someone says he’s not the lord, everyone grabs pitch forks.

Imagine him charging towards black beard with knife to get just knocked away with elbow

If it was the same thread as i read, he said that it counted for attackers killing the hacked drone. So basically enemy drone, however if a defender killed the hacked drone, it then a friendly drone, and wouldn't count.
---
Dude I hate that shit especially when I hack a twitch drone. It's just makes mozzies ability useless when team mates do that
---
DESTROY 20 **ATTACKER** DRONES
---
Maestro is always a good choice tons of info and fragging power, Alibi is solid but not as obvious to do well with, Mozzie is an attackers HIGH info fever dream with guns crafted by Satan himself and clash takes A LOT time to even begin to do well with and has a lot of counters but can waste a lot of attackers time

Then maybe you got lucky and I didn’t.

The more i think about the better is it... It was surprising yeah but she was too op. In fact this will froce a few ppl to use the g36c, but not as much as the smg nerfs. If you think about it she is more vulnerable against 3 armor defenders and also it made harder to find thos headshots. But it wasnt a too huge nerf to be underpowered. I mean its wierd and I cant really explain it but its fairly balamced..

The catalyst isn’t becoming a diamond skilled player, it’s just learning the game more. Diamonds (tend) to have significantly more advanced game knowledge then for example a gold. So am operator like echo will be a lot stronger at high levels, compared to gold, this isn’t because of their rank but because they simply know that operator better. A gold player could learn the echo playstyle of a diamond and dominate. But in this example echo is balanced at top levels maybe a bit strong, and he’s weak at lower levels. This doesn’t mean he needs a buff, the lower levels just need to practice and learn the ins and outs of echo further.
---
What you’re saying about an operator being really strong up to platinum and balanced at pro level doesn’t really occur, I can’t think of one, the only operator I’d say that is close is fuze, he’s much better at lower ranks, but he is bad everywhere else 
---
Wow no one has posted this yet
---
The mad man did it!!

Aaaah!! 😱 Thank you soooo much!!! 😊🙌🏻

They made Kaid, essentially a buffed bandit. You think they have any issue copying ops?

It’s something I see a lot of streamers and pros complain about (as well as the community) and don’t understand why it hasn’t been fixed yet.

(Although I know nothing about video game development, so that doesn’t help)

Yeah when Ubi made casual sweaty they damaged both casual and ranked. Can't remember too many throwers in ranked when casual was chill.

First mozzie ace in the game?

Me and a friend already exchanged some tks over this challenge because they would destroy his mozzied drones :)

I mean the game is fiction so I can be accepting of a totally fictional and totally unattainable build for a woman.

Even female body builders on steroids don't get that shape.
---
How to fix it? you cant it was on the TTS before it came to live servers. Gunna have to wait but i use 2 monitors so im not conerned too much 
---
It was removed due to the high level of spawn killing that occurred. Could run from balcony and drop a c4 for an ace. Or peek from front door and spray down those who spawned.

just for all the incoming noobs

They could just do what Warframe does, notifies you an stops the trade if the other person's offer changes, then displays stats and a picture of what both things you're trading (by stats I mean name and rarity of course), then finally makes you verify 3 times you wanna trade.

Yeah a pop up box stating that you will be locked out of the game if you leave, the game could then check to see if the player has checked that box if not it must have been a disconnect. I will admit I have no idea if this could be implemented though lol. 
---
This is a leftover from a very old spawn which was broken and got removed. You can only see it in thunt now.
---
Yeah. I have black Ice for ump but I don't use it. I have eg skin and invitational pack skin. All except the eg skin is collecting dust. 
---
I think that point could go both ways. Why do people care?
---
Maybe they are reworking his logo? Or they just wanna tilt us...
---
That wasn’t a joke so that’s just stupid
---
I tried this on Xbox and couldn't get up on top of that vending machine...also couldn't vault up onto the red tarp. Guess that explains why thanks,

Big dick energy 
---
Wait! Clash is a girl!?
---
Eh maybe I’ve been a little aggressive, still though, my standpoint is to why the hell this is even a topic or even worth posting over? Like this is the most pressing issue you have right now? You’re allowed to think I’m a douche bag that’s fine I’ve been aggressive about this, just irks me when I see posts like this it’s a gigantic waste of time, I myself and being a little hypocritical as I’ve wasted way too much time on this topic as is
---
Exactly, he’s not being outplayed if they are exploiting a bug.
---
If you're on PC try verifying the game files in Uplay and see if any of them need repairing. If that doesn't work then perhaps give reinstalling a go. 
---
Yeah, end it there. No need to overlap, because one of my personal problems with ps4 siege is the new players that really only got to 20 due to excessive play really fucking up the team. Let them play in a place where it won’t fuck up everyone else
---
We already have black ice headgears and uniforms u just can't get them anymore
---
:(
---
neon arrow? hard to tell as its so blurry
---
Why tf did you take the picture at this angle
---
why are you so against it though haha. It’s not like it’s a bad thing, Ubisoft won’t lose out on money since they’ve already got their money from the original purchase and some people have legitimately accidentally bought things and had other people buy shit on their account.
---
Ha. 
---
this is happening to me too, but I'm from South America ... matches where all the players are from South America being placed on the northern servers. Ubisoft btw
---
Game que is also 5 min long. It is like R6 is a ghosttown atm. Only people that are online are the ones deranking
---
What kinda of trollfest do you mean? I as usual get 4 gold without any problem. Gitgut, u know.
---
Ok, thanks man.  
---
Does that take a while to reinstall do you know?
---
so god damn lucky
---
Yeah thats why i looked disabled trying to find the wall
---
That should probably get fixed.. would recommend reporting it [here](https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/contribute/).

Why should I be thankful I work hard for my money ? If other people don’t to buy it that’s fine but I have paid for a service which comes with entitlement as I am paying a premium for a product 
---
wasnt on purpose, but had to it real quick, used this on this map on a ranked match and they never saw that the cam was up there
---
because I find your reason for impulse buying idiotic. spending real money to meme is sad and you should regret it
---
Yep. This happens every other round for me. I’m actually maining mozzie on defence, as I never had a defence main before, and I can tell it’s going to piss me off.
---
I emptied like 10 boolets of an alda into twitch's head and she took no damage
---
Why everyday i see the same post ?
---
was i right though, in the arrow
---
you got an evidence ?
---
"mozzie short XD" is not creative
---
im just talking the map, there are a lot of other issues in the update
---
Immersion: Broken
---
Nearly lost a ranked yesterday because of this.
---
There's too much light on the newer one's face.
---
There’s a reason those maps aren’t in the competitive map pool, if the worlds best teams and players can’t strategise on them, neither can your average player. 
---
That’s happened twice to me.
---
 Literally unplayable 
---
This community is GENERALLY very toxic. Perhaps not the folks at the subreddit for R6 and especially not at the academy subreddit but in general? Yes. Very toxic. 
---
Honestly your best bet is to stack with friends. Randoms will be randoms.
---
To be fair I've seen Gold and Plats on PC do this shit too. People get hungry for that kill.
---
Search Jesús Calleja in spanish
---
I just started playing the game after a long break, and thought I would try to get ranked... I played 6 games straight and in all of them I was shot to 30-40 and even 20 hp and in some even killed. Mind you I don’t shoot back, TK or anything like that.  
---
It is really frustrating to the point where I don’t won’t to play this game alone. When I play with my mates at least there is a bigger chance of not getting shot since there’s fewer stranger. 
---
The only thing I did was report toxic behavior - is there anything else I can do? 
---
The thing is, we’ve already paid for the original item. we are getting the renown/credits refunded to buy something different. so basically, they aren’t losing anything.
---
Having played One-For-All in League (which is what you suggested) it's not as fun as you might think. 99% of the time you basically win or lose at character select.
---
this is one of my biggest issues, especially because other people see it differently, ill hit a barricade, it wont fall, but an opponent sees me clearly
---
Huh
---
KOBE is for precision, this was clearly a YEET.
---
helmet isn't hitbox
---
I run the fmg because to me it has an easy recoil to control. Then again, I used a suppressor on my secondary smgs and that might be the reason why fmg seems easy to me. 
---
I’m finding games before I even realise I’ve pressed start matchmaking atm (eu ranked ps4)
---
Idk when they broke it, but it used to not be this way. It’s even more stupid considering that destruction is client sided &amp; there’s nothing preventing it from happening. 
---
To be? Or not to be?
---
If lion and doki were proximity based instead of global they would have been fine 
---
wtf
---
Cav got an....*upgrade* it seems.
---
Not that its a bad thing.
---
More like anything below Gold 2. 
---
Beaulo and Pengu are the only good players in that tho
---
"Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this"
---

---
Playing Kapkan is a blast. 
---
Show
---
I have since learnt that running is definitely a no-go most of the time. I'm level 13 now, will grind to level 30 to try ranked :)
---
You ever heard the old saying don't talk to crybaby assholes? Prime example 
---
you’re really trying to judge me now. we’re talking about refunding. not me being “sad” for buying the Fuze elite partly to meme on people, tbh I thought it did look cool and I did use him a lot at the time though. 
---
Elite skin confirmed 
---
could be. I don't want to expand it beyond 2 parent-operators since it will be too clustered. 
---
also thinking if I should include gadgets, like claymores
---
Pick that site, pick frost = ez kill(s)

That's not how you should look at it. We're not playing anywhere near that level, and will not be effected by the small % here or there that they can take advantage of. They're fine for us nobodies in small-time ranked. 
---
It’s

*Slams Table*
---
FUCKING SIDEWAYS UBI!!!!!!
---
I only wanted one thing with mozzie, and my first round I played with him I killed twitch with her shock drone!
---
They are but they are loosing the money that you would spend on the credits to buy somthing rather than return somthing and then get what you wanted. 
---
Obvious wallhacks, didn’t you see the red outline?
---
Not until casual is reverted back to no mm.
---
Arguably only Pengu. I've normally been able to beat Beaulo by spending an extra 5 seconds being a bit smarter or more patient.
---
Didn't know that SFF or SSF whatever it's called is a pro team
---
if you used it a lot at the time then why are you asking for a refund, do you go to the store, buy a shirt, wear it for a few months, and then ask to return it because you liked it at the time but don't wear it anymore?
---
It’s free so what do you have to lose
---
you can have 10 drones as mozzie if u shoot the spider at multiple drone in the radius it will take multiple
---
Oh fuck yes this is about to get great I’m excited now. Alright I’m gonna throw my own scenario at you. I’m a college student, a double major, and I work in the local hospital as I am a bio and psych major. I work hard, but I cannot afford the season pass this year/yet. Do I have the 30 dollars? Obviously, I’m not an idiot with my money, I have more pressing things though, girlfriend, school loans, food, rent, etc etc I need to make sure I can afford all my priorities. With that being said, do you work harder than me or people similar to me? Idk, idk your situation, but I don’t believe that gives you entitlement over other users of the product. Your product that you paid for allows for a week early of ops and 600 R6 credits, that’s exactly what you paid for that’s exactly what you got. My point in it being catered to you is that there are still other users on this game, I’m guessing the majority of the 40 million users don’t have the season pass (could be wrong) why should we have to cater to your wants and desires because we didn’t pay for the ops a week early? Yes the timing is strange but it doesn’t affect the gameplay in the slightest and the complaint is way too entitled 
---
Except this week with the jäger bday challenge
---
Lots of games do this, not sure what you mean
---
They aren’t boots 
---
Lol I always shoot it as it’s being hacked so there is no outline yet but, then I get the -10 and I realized I fucked.
---
I know there goal is to reach 100 Ops but I don’t see how you have 100 unique Ops without some overlap or a few just generally being bad ideas. 
---
Best advice is to wait til the next season. With the current ranked system, it’s impossible to get out of silver and back to gold. Even if you get carried by a stack of plats or something like that, there is no guarantee that you will keep winning matches because you will eventually get matched with diamonds and plats if you win too much.
---
This would great 
---
Imagine if Ninja played siege. 
---
Thanks so much, I'll do you proud &lt;3
---
Lmao Im like 5.7
---
not yet aparently
---
Next season is Pick and Ban
---
It's like people don't even bother to learn the fucking game. Jesus fucking Christ
---
Tell me where and I'll get it.
---
It is a very interesting and infuriating sight
---
Wow! I really like this and the details are great other than clash and her weird bendy arm
---
Were is gridlock?

How many ranked games would you play. Because if you were in play raw skill should be enough to gat out of bronze at least

Wow.

Ikr, sometimes they even skip school to play. Like they play the game that much that on time in he pe changing room (gym class) the topic of hobbies came up and they were all on about rainbow. I said I love to skate, they said yeah that's cos ur shit at rainbow. I told them that skating is just more fun, one thing led to another, we started arguing and they turned on the shower and held the door shut as I was drenched. Because I have hobbies other than rainbow. This is the level of sweat they are.

Hack Pulse gadget, take it away from Pulse, use it to detect Jackal, hack Jackal's I-NOX, hack the planet.
---
Same thing happened to me, Xbox as well
---
The goal was never to have 100 unique ops. They stated  that they wanted several ops with similar abilities 
---
Agreed
---
Rook is "fat" / thicc and there was no complaints, all of a sudden we get fat shaming comments about a female op cause she's not wearing vacuum sealed tights like ela and dokki 
---
Oh, sweet. Thanks for the help.
---
Wait so you’re asking to get boosted to a high rank and when you hit a high rank they’ll beg to play with you?
---
That makes no sense... they’ll play one game and find out you’re not good enough to be in that rank then bully again.
---
Just fuck em and find new friends
---
Shotguns don't need sights tbh

Yeah but somebody already made this joke yesterday.

On all levels, even physical

I remember when echo was pretty new, people would always shoot my yokai, even though my name was above it and as someone who has experienced shooting Mozzies drones on accident (thinking it was an enemy) I know it’ll take some time for the community
---
In the pooper 
---
Sometimes it does, sometimes it works perfectly. But overall the update is better and more consistent than the ones before 
---
If siege was an anime this would be the cover for the art
---
This is nothing. Pay the old school Runescape reddit a visit some day.
---
It's natural for men to admire sexy female ops like Ela. Obviously, Gridlock isn't something they wanted so all the hate is well deserved. 
---
They are there on hard and up
---
I liked the way she held her garget.
---
Really nice drawing! Even better that you included a map in there as well! Keep it up
---
Some people are just assholes, no sense in trying to get revenge when you could spend the same time making meaningful relationships with people who actually value and enjoy your company. And if they give you trouble at school there is no shame in bringing it up with a teacher or your parents. 
---
I'm sure you're tired of this answer but; find a good discord to play with. As a former soloq player I almost quit the game entirely before I got with a good group of peeps to play with. 
---
Yeah I wanna find new friends. The thing is, they did the same to our other friend, he stopped playing with them. Came back plat 3 and they were bribing him and everything to get him to play with em. You're right though I need new friends. 
---
You found the way into Narnia.

How is this possible? I find I'm not killing anything with C4 now, only downs. Anecdotally I'm finding you literally have to hit the person with the C4. 
---
I think you took this the wrong way I didn’t mean to focus on the little mistake this artwork is amazing. Well done!
---
What the problem?
---
Fix spawn peeking? Just a part of the game, gotta keep an eye out for it 
---
That in combination with instant Spawnkills
---
My school does fuck all about bullying :/
---
You run towards and obvious spawn peek location where a broken window also enters view.
---
There is nothing to be fixed here gamewise, however it's a solid learning lesson to change your approach, especially now that you can choose where you spawn.
---
Vice versa I suggest keeping a drone watching that side of the building's windows, as soon as you see one break you know what to avoid or shoot back to.
---
Hope the third one will containt ability to take screenshots 
---
It looks like Gridlocks fat ass tripped and killed herself

How long have you played this game

I'm away from my ps4 for the weekend but I'll be back on tuesday and if you want to squad up I'm down. Psn is Crazy_Thunder21. I've lost real life friends over Playstation so dont let that bother you too much and do your own thing homie 🐉

Thank you so so much

Download a better CPU ig

No really? I thought thats how it looks!

He's so small that I've missed headshots that would have hit most ops

yeah it’s Ubisofts fault your internet is garbage

So what we have? 32 Contributions, 57 votes at 08.03.2019. Most of contributions has 2 CPUs proccessors. Most of them has Intel Pentium, and the rest are AMD. Few contributions has a Intel Core i5 and i7 with more than 2 CPUs. And the interesting one contribution is the PS4 Pro(dunno wth, maybe missclick or smth). What do we have from Ubisoft developer's side? Seems nothing. R6 Twitter ignoring, Ubisoft support will tell you about your specs(if you have Pentium 2cpu) or tell you go to R6Fix. I have a bit of doubt about that low specs is the real reason why game freezes. Guys with more than 2 CPU -  try to run game with different number of active CPUs, maybe that would help you. That's all, folks.
---
You can’t 
---
anything new is bad change my mind
---
They haven’t even started using just Gun operator ideas. For instance a bolt action rifle that can shoot holes into reinforced walls, or a shotgun that has interchangeable shells and barrells like buckshot/slugs. Theres a lot of operators, just have to be creative. 
---
Perhaps you can iterate on what the bad is?
---
Maybe if ur bad
---
I didn't say Glaz cause he needs to ADS to have the thermal vision

Not sure if it's still the quicker way, but party up with some friends and play T-hunt, relatively quick and you get 100-150 renown per win. (Renown is reduced for Lone Wolf but isn't for co-op play).
---
Goobi pls
---
Well yea, if you suck at Frost. 
---
You're supposed to throw down in the dumbest possible yet most.obvious locations. The amount of borderline rainman level kills I've gotten by placing a Frost map on the opposite side of the map are amazing.

People expect a trap near objective at a window. They absolutely do not expect a trap in the corner of a room they just entered and backed into from the doorway.

You can't. The way to get more renown is to play games and win them, plus doing weekly and daily challenges. Play ranked for more renown per game. It really doesn't take very long to get 25k.
---
As someone who hasn't logged on in a month to play siege, but still visits the subreddit. I hadn't seen it. Got a laugh out of me though! You obviously knew what it was without even clicking on it, so why even waste time looking at it? Let alone post about it.

Frost is very strong on office/party, and okay on laundry/games and bushranger/nature. All three sites have windows in important surrounding rooms, and putting frost mats under them prevents people from jumping in and prefiring anchor spots. 
---
I've had enought.

Raw Input is a lie, it's better without
---
There are TONS of bugs, e.g. one of them is when you're prone on an uneven surface, your character model glitches out (3p) while you can see everything perfectly fine. This is fine, wont be happening a lot i guess, so fixing that doesn't take priority, next we have the sounds, and trust me, i could've pinpointed direction that i'm getting shot from/hearing footsteps better trough my stereo speakers before this update. Sounds are AWFUL, i have absolutely no idea what they did, but a lot, and when i say a lot i mean that 1/3 players that i have played with this week complains about the sounds. They are truly AWFUL. Next thing is hitreg, i don't really know what was the reason behind implementing the new, or, you could say "old" running animations, i don't know if the hitreg is awful because of that, but hitting shots is harder than ever. Next thing is the new camera placement, but i guess it was implemented on purpose like that, what i mean by saying that is that if you peek someone slowly, (e.g. holding q and alt) they will be able to see you first, and i know that this was in the game the entire time, it just makes sense, but the difference now is just huge, i have no idea why did they have to do this. Next thing is leaning. I think majority of the player base would have been fine with the old leaning system, where e.g. if you're leaning to the right side, you would have to press e; q; to lean faster, instead of pressing q. The next thing is "sliding". I don't even know how to describe it, i think everyone here knows what i mean by saying that. It's not a big issue, but it's still there. Those are one of the main reasons i don't enjoy playing this game after the update.

Not at all this is completely normal

If you can't bring up any valid or constructive points as to why it's the "worse map" don't make a post about it. To be honest, it sounds like what someone would say if they're struggling to learn the map and are whining about it.

Except for the whole ability to just shoot down, shoot from upside down on some of them, just easily avoid those 3 traps, toss a nade. Frost stinks.

Is anyone else getting a bug with mozzie where the nitro cell won’t detonate?
---
RIP having fun on this game
---
This leaker has a very good track record though. They leaked burnt horizon early and the only mistake was they mixed up the genders of mozzie and gridlock. They also leaked the road map early and said that the american would be secret service before they revealed it at the invitational.
---
Why would i be upset? They are not as good as previous ones, (yeah, i know, lots of previously released ops were broken) they are not fun to play, especially gridlock, mozzie is fun at first, but gets boring really fast.

I gotta try this. Thanks!

You can bet your panties that im gonna use this when im playing against my friends

It's not the ping. It's matchmaking. I keep getting games on random servers. Played 1 game on Brazilian servers on Wednesday. We're queued scus and load into a game with 150 ping and Brazilians.

It is in the arrow, good spot dude, appreciate it. 
---
Well it depends on preference I guess. I personally love all three of those maps. I am just a small plat player but unless the pros come in and complain that those maps are unbalanced, nothing will be done. IMO those three maps should stay as they are. The only map that requires current changes in ranked is Theme Park, hence the incoming rework next season.
---
going easy mode gives you more renown.. makes sense

Used to play in a team?

If so, rank?

O shit waddup it's Thatkaid

but i was always it "on" form the start, and getting 30 fps only if i turned it off. where i always get 60fps.
---
this is happening in burnt horizon update only.
---
this sub is trash
---
So you are saying m&amp;k on console is not cheating, even if ubisoft does.
---
Scuff I mean ok but you have a huge advantage by it, in apex or fornite even more. People will do what they want and we can't change it anyway.
---
Sorry! All I heard was CONSECUTIVE! C Q C!

Now what were we talking about?

correction, it would be "Clear &amp; Present Danger" followed by "Patriot Games"

By his logic, all trading card games and most video games are all gambling and should be banned.
---
I personally disagree because literally any game could be considering a form of simulated gambling if you dive deep enough.
---
One of THE best maps ever designed my UBI. I love it. Garage is very defender sided but Dorms is an up in the air pick as both sides have good advantages and disadvantages. I hope they continue making epic maps like this.
---
They deal 10 but I think you had a typo.

The best clash buff is \*deleting her from the game\* and that about sums that up

Y’all notice Mozzie’s first name is Max and his last name is Goose, and both of those are the names of characters from the first Mad Max movie?
---
Maybe but they should actually implement changes
---
Literally the Mozambique. 
---
How y’all is mozzie?
---
The garage secure area is way too big
---
Yes but it's better if begginners can use her gadget when they play for the first time while the game is still downloading 
---
You just can't put it on Mozzie or Gridlock. It's still available for everyone else
---
lol it’s okay, people in Asia are really good a propaganda and brainwashing. Either way I could still give tips for console

Lol you must have been in my game just now when we all figured this out

I did this earlier yesterday afternoon! It was my 1st or 2nd game of the day, and I had captured twitches 1st drone almost immediately and hid it. Later in the round in a 2v1, I had heard her throw out her 2nd drone and INSTANTLY drove it into one of Mozzie’s traps. With 2 drones, I managed to land 10 of her shocks and got the match winning kill in overtime with her own drones. Best damn thing I’ve ever done.
---
Six isn't the teams name. Six is the Head of Team Rainbow.
---
You guessed it
---
I achieved my dream of killing twitch with her own drone
---
Is it a known issue that players are being put on the wrong servers when matchmaking? eg: US East players on BR servers and BR players on US East servers?
---
Guess I'm never playing ranked again.
---
People who main recruit should probably be the ones thinking  about seeking professional help. :)
---
I havent had an issue so far, as a plat 2/3 player ive been called a smurf but im level 203 and they say im a smurf. Are you sure you arent over reacting? People like to complain but instead just focus on what youre doing wrong because if your going to solo q you shouldnt expect a good rank.
---
Atleast 3 
---
You're name aggravates me more than this post.
---
It’s so weird to see drones not being slowed when passing barbed wire
---
&gt; So you are saying m&amp;k on console is not cheating, even if ubisoft does.
---
It cheating if the developer says it, yes, its just no inherently cheating, and Id like to see where Ubi says its "cheating", they just said it was "unsupported" which doesnt mean shit because using an adapter to use an Xbone controller on PS4 RS6 is al "unsupported".
---
Well, as much as it's not great that this is the case the maps are balanced around the Bomb game mode, Secure and Hostage often end up with one or two average/bad site locations in the process.
---
So honestly I can understand not liking some secure/hostage sites, but that doesn't necessarily make the whole map "bad", as if we are to look at it from the bomb perspective it definitely works better.
---
I bet that used to be a normal barricaded window but the map designer changed it out at the last minute but the programmer forgot to change whatever attribute needed to prevent entering.  just a guess. lol
---
Her shotgun is insane. I’m surprised I don’t see more people run the thotty with the shotty.
---
I got black ice for the PMM and the LFP586 before lvl 50, but the first primary black ice i got was for the AR33 2 days ago at lvl 101. To sum up, it may be a while before you get anything you like.
---
Honestly, vigil should have been an attacker from the start.
---
I didn't even realize that they used a real brand lmao
---
Pc, xbox, or ps4? And also i would suggest finding squads from the rainbow 6 discord or try using moot. 
---
That’s a cool team
---
Me: I hope there is no more kill some number of drone missions. Gbisoft: let's make a mission to kill 20 drones that will annoy everyone who plays mozzie
---
I would never shoot them! I melee them.

It’s crazy that in pro league the pro teams use certain ops for their strats and has a completely different style of play. You ever see people in Radom ranked doing pro league strats? No you don’t. It doesn’t work. Why is cav on the bottom also but then very good in random ranked matches. 
---
Your just a pro league band wagoner that only things the good ops are the ones that the pros use yet they use completely different strats. 
---
She’s doesn’t have a low pick rate. She has a low pick rate cuz she doesn’t fit into the PRO LEAGUE meta.

I caught a twitch drone last night and killed the other one later in the round. That’s the absolute peak of Mozzie performance.

See I know gambling,  but I know is really not though. It's gambling of online currency that you can't even buy using real-life currency. But I really don't care if it's gambling or not.

I pretty sure I saw a post on reddit or tweet where ubi said it is and asked people to please report it.
---
true,but when you're running the shotty in 2v2s you'll get the kicky
---
Wow, that’s really terrible if they actually just dropped support completely like that. Hell, even the stated minimum processor requirement is a dual core. I feel like that’s something you should definitely give the players a heads up on.
---
Same here. Muscle memory. Level 179 here (plat at one point). Hard for me!
---
u/Its_Epi

People are being matched in the wrong region, this is happening very frequently for content creators if you watch streams, and for other people as well.
---
Hahahahaha my new strat thanks!
---
Turn off Disarm Bomb in your Terrorist Hunt preferences and you'll never be put into Article 5 again.
---
I believe it's a skin that is referencing the weapons seen in the movie Alien, it's basically the same colour pattern (and digital dial counter) seen on a gun in the movie.
---
Don't forget the Heartbeat Jammer Puck
---
You don’t have the season pass but you can buy them an Wednesday 
---
Makes it looks like the AR from Aliens 
---
It won’t help, i tried it. 
---
I play on pc and for some reason in 2019 no one has mics.  Always get qued with people without a mic.  I just wish I could see their chat call out for more than 3 seconds. 
---
Your subconscious is like “NEED TO KILL DRONE” and little Mozzie is just standing there, sad cause you killed his drone😂
---
On*
---
About?
---
have to have season pass. otherwise you have to wait a week to unlock
---
Only Y4 pass owners can use them now.
---
Wasnt the swat 556 pretty bad 
---
The map is great it's just that the area of the objective is big it needs to be smaller because sometimes you dont know where are the attackers 
---
4 if we count in "r/Wooosh" as a r/facepalm
---
Season pass owners play them early, the non season pass owners have to wait 7 days to buy them with renown or credits 
---
It was okay for a burst fire. Not my choice of weapon though 
---
Then don’t get careless. Takes like 20 seconds max to clear all the windows and run outs 
---
Imagine how much karma u could get
---
I don't know if I can say that I understand how 
---
been asked b4, is not released yet sadly
---
That’s a good thing

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I'm fuckin retarded. Lmao. Lol that would be funny and terrible at the same time. Honestly, there would be no point to the newcomer playlist. That would still be funny tho.
---
Me too!
---
*WOOOWWW
---
He’s probably better than me already 
---
So you can attach it a like a bandit batt? Would twitch effect it? I assume Thatcher still would. 
---
That’s how chat pops up in Overwatch and it’s really convenient 
---
Stop
---
I’m currently reading Patriot Games
---
Stfu pussy, we don’t need a pc to be good, we both could smack your ass
---
I just go to YouTube to see them better in gameplay, personally
---
I'm on Pc so I can't help with your request. 
---
But my advise would be playing solo queue. Yes I know it can suck but every now and then you get a team  that connects very good and that can have a lot of fun together. Maybe you'll find some new friends like that. It helped me when I had nobody to play with. Met a lot of nice people. Try to speak with people.
---
Also if it wouldn't resolve in more bullying and you want to stay with your current people you can try to talk with them and explain that what they say isn't ok to you. Especially when they joke about a serious disease your sister has. That should be a nogo.
---
Whatever you do good luck to you and also your sister.

Maybe it works and makes the photo to look casual and like you dont care about how you take the picture, but damn is it annoying to look at and taking a straightish picture takes the same amount of time, I swear.

This. I can’t believe so many people assume you’ll be able to put it on future weapons.
---
What skin is that?
---
Great drawing, do Mozzie please
---
I guess so.
---
He is a pro gamer XD
---
I’d rather hear the call out “Zofia out front, Bandit behind you” rather than someone say *goober47 behind you* because: 
---
It’s longer to say
---
Some people mispronounce gamertags but they won’t screw up operator names (less confusion)
---
Less looking at the name, then looking at scoreboard to see what op they are, then someone else talks and you gotta switch to scoreboard to check, and so on
---
Helps with bad call outs like *two over by me!!* and then the mics are insane *who are you?? Where are you??* but rather it would show the op that’s speaking and that whole 10 second conversation of confusion is skipped, and more likely reaction times can be faster and the frag or re-frag can actually happen.
---
I keep seeing reverse crouch spamming where they crouch walk then stand up when you shoot so you hit them in the stomach and legs instead of chest and head
---
I think twitch prolly not, thatcher prolly yes, but he would only disable it
---
Because the skin is a reference to the M4A1 Pulse rifle from the movie Aliens.
---
Sure
---
What’s your username 
---
B-b-b-but the pros! THE PROS DON’T DO THAT! /s
---
Take a Reddit break friend, not everyone has seen every post.
---
Got the same problem with my mates, they fucked up the whole game 
---
The best is stealing a twitch then destroying a thermite charge with it. You won’t believe how pissed Thermite mains get with their French teammate.
---
I've been playing this game a long time now, and i can tell the difference between a high skill sweatlord and a normal player any day, it's ranged from 21-2 sweat lords(both deaths were by me, humble brag), to premade teams that were borderline copying proleague defense strats on fucken gold 4 and were bronze and plat(i use R6tracker)
---
Can we all focus on the fact that Ash is watching Tchanka porn?
---
&gt; She’s doesn’t have a low pick rate. She has a low pick rate cuz she doesn’t fit into the PRO LEAGUE meta.
---
She has a low pick rate like Cav because she is countered the same way like Cav, drones. Frost is arguably the easiest non-Tachanka OP in the game to counter with halfway decent drone work. Hell just knowing she exists in the game is typically enough to counter her.
---
Lmao
---
When she was first teased that is what I thought she was gonna do 
---
Make sure the Season Pass is fully installed.
---
This would eliminate all the anger with the "they're over there!"  Callouts. 
---
Quit your grinnin and drop you linen! THIS CANT BE HAPPENING MAN
---
Can you not be a cunt and be productive
---
I've realized that the reloads on all pistols and the smg 11 sound different
---
Wait a minute
---
I like it, wouldn't be a major buff but would be useful every now and then. 
---
Another possible buff I thought of is she is able to place down here shield in thermite holes and the sides fold out so it covers the whole hole. 
---
When individual items are able to be traded or sold for cash it incentives cheaters to obtain those items. Currently boosting is the only profit ave available to cheating. 
---
Why? Extra fat just removes the need for Rook armor

Good job on this OP!

No good ash player used acog on the R4 though.

Cuz you really want that 1 dollar skin

So they extort you

I don’t think you understand. I don’t chose who gets banned. The players do.

Well then I suggest you watch videos of people who are actually good at the game use ash with an ACOG

On his POV it looks like you slipped through the hatch

He was doc and it was during a rank, but I would’ve definitely killed if it wasn’t 
---
True I’m a PS4 player and my main problem is the abuse of mouse and keyboard it’s basically cheating and given them an advantage

aaaah feelbadman. thx bro!
---
Bruh I've been playing since Beta and I say this shit every season. Guess what my most played game is.
---
I mean. I disagree but I just wanted to know your thoughts

It probably belongs to twitch. Twitch and Echo are both the ops who drive around little robots with their wrist phones. They should be 'shipped and this is the first step.

I'm pretty sure Ubisoft has a deal with UA for all their games as The Division and Wildlands both have UA stuff in them. So they probably just threw some stuff in Siege as well
---
I can get into the fact that Mute hammers are loud af, but I’ve never heard of this new glitch 
---
If I downvote this, does your karma go up?
---
&gt; Sigh. You go ahead and do you I guess, base your gameplay enjoyment out of simply going off what Pros use.
---
I mean I'm all for memeing in casual, but in Ranked I am going to try to win. This doesn't mean running some ridiculous pro league strats every round, but it does mean picking way more useful ops than Frost. Hell you can use Alibi in a similar way to Frost, but have a better gun, secondary shotgun, and impacts. 
---
&gt; Its almost like there's a lot more to a round and a match than just picking Jager all the time.
---
But not having a Jager is wayyyyy more impactful than not having a Frost. He isn't the one op either we are talking about too. Mira, Maestro, Echo, Smoke, Mute, etc are all hilariously more useful.
---
The Lord is too busy leading the Great ~~Arstotzka~~ Russia to bother with Border Checks.

This is also happening with frags! I was playing clash and a grenade was on the other side of a soft wall, that I was facing btw, and it downed me through the wall, through my shield, without breaking the wall at all.

Have you played this game at all?

Alright thanks for the criticism I'll try to make a better one next time, I just upload a new a few days ago I think it's somewhat better, let me know if you get a chance to see it

Well said.

That looks like a bug...

also pls make that u can have 2 voice chats. 1 for entire team and 1 for people who are in a party, that would avoid the 4 french guys in the team who only talks in the voice

They’re not gonna do anything because it earns them more money 
---
How the fuck did no one in defense get a kill
---
New defense operator carries a tactical nuke as his deployable gadget. 
---
Clearly OP is not since he’s on here 
---
Going back to this post next season to compare

I agree

Sorry It wasn't directed to you, just wanted to share my opnion, what you say is right tho, OP has apparently never seen nesk, joystick, kanto, etc, that are incredible ash players that run it with an ACOG a lot of the time
---
What how would it earn them more money? Players that play at higher ranks will quit playing if they dont do anything
---
Hibana is basically a necessity
---
Who won
---
I hate it when people say, "On me, ON ME!" And I'm like who the fuck are you. I would love to see this in game 
---
Very common business strategy with microtransactions, Rather then selling you an item for $2 they make you buy $5 currency pack, which leaves you with some left over currency to spend so that you'll be more likely to buy more at a later time.
---
Basically what I got from his statement is that nothing is being done
---
Vigil if you want to roam with a solid gun , valk if you want intel , doki cuz ring ring 
---
*land down under starts playing and gets progressively louder
---
Nah, just put some bread in it
---
It earns Microsoft and Sony more money because they have to buy adapters to play with mnk
---
Because nothing can be done. Not ubi’s fault. 
---
Lol definitely not me 
---
get a better pc 
---
Thanks for the replies
---
Maybe in year 8, 4 years to erase the BETA tag 😂

Extremely rare and nice Mute be like: " Mozzie I caught a drone for you"

And you just go there and shoot it

He needs to dual wield the extendable flash shields, then he'll be good.

Who gilded this comment wtf

I would actually eat this everyday

Wait till next Wednesday and buy the 2 new OP's

I feel like if ubi really talked to Microsoft and Sony somthing could be done

Me too. Except it only happens ingame rarely and it can be fixed by restarting my game. Try hard restarting your console/pc if you didnt already
---
It's sort of a necessary evil for the lack of a better term. High risk is needed in this game to make a lot of the gadgets like drones, traps and intel operators worthwhile. Reducing all the dangerous and frustrating engagements in the game would make it feel so much less exciting when you do make a great play since it's always handed to you.
---
I think people should stop trying to shield other people's children from playing online games that are rated for older teens or adults.
---
Siege is an M rated game.  I believe that M rated games should allow trading and loot boxes.  When I was a child, I opened Yugioh and Pokemon cards and traded them.  This is the same type of "gambling" that online loot crates offer.
---
Crates and booster packs cost $2-3.  No one is going to ruin their life opening those.  A young child may lose their $50 they got for birthday money, but I believe that may actually be a deterrent for that child to gamble later in life.

I really really hope the defender can’t see though smokes... one of the bigger mistakes ubi made was letting glaz see though them, the last thing we need is a defender who can do that

That's a bit extreme, don't you think?

Ppl want their skin man. Just call out when you hack it

Sony and Microsoft endorse the use of mouse and keyboard though so they aren’t gong to do anything.

I think just the operator logos would suffice to make it a bit cleaner

Restarting their computer?

It’s console so it was hard to pick her and yeah, why wouldn’t why I pick my new op. And he said when I asked why he said I was going to kill the hostage. It was bomb

If not a single one of you managed to get one kill, I don't think solo queuing is the problem here.

I’m just waiting for someone to post this happeningon the new map

I don’t even know what the problem is

[Tried pointing this out a day ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay90ma/mozzie_drone_dead_spot_on_plane_under_baggage/) and people don't really pay attention to it, but as a drone hiding spot, it should be fixed.

ALbeit I am on PC I haven't had issues with crouching or leaning, buttons responsive, you sure you don't have a dodgy button?

Hahaha thanks. I got it once I saw the down under reply. But at first I wasnt sure where he was going with that

Hey OP how do you get that camo?

You have satisfied me with this post in a way I never thought possible. 
---
He rappels with a spider web like Thatcher's elite but he's upsidedown instead and just hangs then shoots a web
---
Didn’t know he was named after a Krispy Kreme donut flavor
---
In my experience the shorty seems to have slightly more but I haven’t really had time to test it, both are pretty bad for killing but great just making peek holes and busting hatches
---
Let me tell you my secret...... I don’t 
---
Always try to kick hackers if the vote fails because he has friends in the team leave asap. Especially in Casual.
---
No.... I don’t want Siege to go down the ‘csgo path’... that path....:.
---
I mean The Rabbids as the bad guys do make sense, I wouldn't be surprised if they were the ones to get the nukes dropped leading into The Division and New Dawn and boy would it be dark as hell if they were accidentally apart of Absergo in some way. 
---
Yeah there was another post on it a few hours ago 
---
I did vote kick but he had a buddy and we wouldn’t vote yes
---
Wait for the skin. The last thing anyone wants is another player using lion

It’s called ubisoft does anything

&gt;two of the best guns in the game right now
---
So does average mean the guns are the best now? They are pretty shit
---
The p10 is basically the mpx with a smaller mag
---
The commando is just basic as fuck and below average in nearly every category 
---
Yeah it's gotten so normal to play with one less I'm numb to it its unfortunate bc it's ranked but what are ya going to do lol so I just roll with it and see it as a bigger challenge 😁
---
bro I have that IQ headgear 
---
Will definitely use it for breaching, and probably won’t use it to kill if I don’t have to anymore. Thanks! 
---
imagine getting the new Hibana elite and ending first place in your team for the first time and this happens &gt;.&gt;
---
Talk about a plot twist if it does. Very sneaky there,rabbids.
---
Shark first. You can always buy lion
---
I hope she can go invisible to where defenders can't see her for a few seconds, because if all she does is hide from cameras she's basically just Vigil and Caveira, I say she because Alexander Remy confirmed it's a female operator.

Community settings and then community flair

If operator names don’t work I revert to their name but always use the ping. I think what the OP meant by the feature is whoever is speaking’s operator- not to be displayed throughout the game
---
Ach...man...you had it.
---
Downunderdoot
---
Unlike other Shield ops like say Monty who only have a pistol, unless you use the P10-C you won't benefit from the speed boost it offers. As the current objectively better choice for killing is the machine pistol you are essentially a 3 armour 0.75 speed as shields provide a slight speed debuff.
---
If you'd rather be faster on your feet go for pistol, even with it's 40 or so damage you can quickly 2 shot attackers you've been zapping for a bit.
---
If you have any additional evidence submit it [here.](https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/LIVE-9098-Plane_Mozzie_OOB/contribute/) This is Ubi's official bug report stuff.

you're a victim too? See you in 15 days

Cya!

All he needs is a velcro badge that says "cunt" with a logo of a kangaroo on it
---
That's bad for you. Unfortunately you'll need to wait the 15 days. If you contact support it will take them longer than this period. But thanks for posting this so people know they have to leave asap when hackers in the lobby. Still it's kinda bad for you. But in the end technically the whole team is boosted if they stay with the hacker even if he isn't a premate.
---
When the hell did she have 51 in a mag?
---
It's not even willing - it's just at this point MM is so busted, and the game so completely unenjoyable playing Solo that it is not worth the time or effort to keep trying.
---
If at some point I see Ubisoft makes some significant changes to how MM works, then I might come back but other than that....
---
He is pretty tasty
---
When the hell did you start playing 
---
Microsoft doesnt endorse it but says its up to the developers to ban people for it.
---
I feel like the buff to Karos pellet dispersion will now always make pretty much the same sized holes, so in other words it's likely crouch holes are no longer a thing.
---
Means you will need two charges instead of one now.
---
Months ago. I always thought she had 41.
---
Anyone who mentions feet is not a girl

You got them when activating your season pass

 The notification for the additional 600 for ppl that had year 3 pass just came delayed

I think you have to buy the season pass.

Nope. When she was first released she had 51 per magazine impacts and 4 concussion mines

I played Beaulo and his Ash main streamer gang at late night if that makes you better. It didn’t make sense because we 5 stacked with all plat 3s yet they were all diamond.
---
I love it when posts contain the activate windows watermark
---
Yea but that would never be allowed, I think you would need to spend extra renown (4500) to get the alpha pack and give up the legendary FOR another legendary, and it can’t be the same s the one you had
---
I have
---
Ok but it’s just frustrating that ubi doesn’t even hesitate to look into the situation they just ban people

apparently you didn't watch the livestream the developer said "from Denmark a very exciting female operator"

In fact I think you are so familiar with this area that you know high contrast is used on the scoreboard. As I pointed out you now continually correct accurate and well-cited sources. [Oh I see now](https://www.reddit.com/user/ianhamilton__/comments/). "Unsolicited and/or controversial comments on various internet forums". If you were ever serious I'd advise a less aggressive approach. I'm done. Happy late cake day though.
