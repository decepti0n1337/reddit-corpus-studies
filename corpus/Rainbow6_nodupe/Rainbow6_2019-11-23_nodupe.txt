Windows. If you put the Kap trap high enough on a window it'll go off without destroying the Frost mat.

I’m really bored... got any others to do?
---
LION AND KAPKAN! Sorry. I main them. Lions my favorite

How’s he fake ?

The crappy edition (starter edition )doesnt exist anymore i think
---
The new "Money Heist" themed event is just hostage on Bank. Pure poopy

A lot of people like to compare me to her, but I actually am mute not just shy lol
---
There isn't an in between, there are extremely toxic players and also extremely nice players
---
This... This excites my Italian meatballs.
---
Yeet indeed.
---
Identical score.  Happened to me and my boyfriend.  I got the MVP with a worse record.
---
Link?
---
It's probably going along with her other  numerous buffs that I have a hard time listing because they're reworking her to be more of medic rather than someone who buffs her team. 
---

---
 I say good riddance because she was honestly shit in solo queue but busted in stacks.
---
What's to say he isn't a real diamond with real shitty teammates? He did carry the hell out of his team.
---
Ummm... Mira I guess. You're pretty good at this btw.
---
Oh sorry look up StickoMode Gaming it’s the only vid
---
I think you have to address the various goggles and attachments in some way. Otherwise his gadget feels completely detached from his character. Also, if you're going for the spider thing, is dissolving a wall something spiders do?
---
Either that or they start ear raping me.
---
Whatever you say buddy
---
That while hes a mute main
---
Fuckin retard cavs
---
If he was a real diamond he wouldn't be trying to boost with unranked players to play against lower rank people like me in gold
---
This is too real, I've met people who make me want to rip off their head and shit down their throat because they're such assholes. And on the other side I've met some who make me insecure about my morals because they're saints.
---
Not really fake if he slapped y’all sideways like a bunch of silvers
---
What region you in?
---
#*Meatball man intensifies*
---
💕💕💕💕🥰
---
Well now you're Komi-san to me, friend. Nothing you can do about it now lmao. :)
---
yep, the fact that a suppressor designed to conceal your position is the very thing that gives you away does seem to fit that definition
---
She got the kill tho
---
Still wondering what makes him a fake diamond because he obviously shit on you and your team, he just couldn't carry hard enough.
---
That’s the thing tho they gotta get lucky. It used to be super easy for them one time and they were quite a pain in the ass. Nowadays the shield
---
Ops feel more on par with everyone else, if not worse. Thankfully there are hardly any competent Blackbeards out there tho. Before his big nerf he was such a pain in the ass.
---
Haha yes for sure, just wanted to point out that they aren't console exclusive problems!
---
Hate that guy.
---
Dickhead i acknowledged it was from 3 years ago and said i didnt find anything more recent that contradicts it. I also just went in game and tested the recoil with both mnk and controller and the the controller had less recoil.
---
Look, we're obviously not going to agree. I think ela is mostly fine, you think she is the worst op in the game. I can't be fucked arguing any more because its not going anywhere.
---
All this event is good for tbh.
---
remove the suppress and you can still see the barrel
---
Thank you x
---
No it’s a people problem for sure haha
---
yes, through the windshield. I just couldn’t get out.
---
The problem is that I show up offline
---
I have connection errors which cannot be fixed cause of school wifi. The thing is if I can't find game in minute and a half, then I lose connection, but even then, in game my voice chat not working, so I can't talk or hear
---
You can't natively use mnk on consoles? Weren't you the guy saying console had a bunch of mnk players earlier. Also console is filled with them. Jam packed in high ranks. I did read what you said. And what you said is by basis wrong. Console has less control over their weapons. less control means more recoil. Put two and two together.
---
As a console player that has had a little bit of pc experience, you are 100% correct.
---
keep talking all that shit and i’ll have your vibe checked
---

Someone just got killed by jackal
---
62 round magazine is too big don’t you think. But that would be awesome
---
Well excuse me for liking his rifle
---
I literally didn’t even use his gadget for like a year
---
That’s not what this sub is for.
---
cs go time
---
Nah Lesion and Kapkan are much better alternatives currently, Lesion because he's still too damn good and Kapkan because he still has a good primary.
---
Jackal is a counter. That’s how a strategy game works.
---
I just dont like him because in a game of realism (to an extent) he can find your location.....multiple times......off of footprints?
---
New meta?
---
Oops I spelt which wrong
---
All I want is a non shitty red dot, fun thing is ubi had amazing sigth customization in other games (ghost reocn wildlands just to name one) yet its sooo fucking bad in this one
---
Even just allowing all ops to equip the russian/exclusive sigtha would be a great improvement but no
---
Yeah it worked in csgo /s
---
No theyre all using an adapter. Ubisoft doesnt not officially support mnk on consoles but they cant do anything to stop it since the adapter spoofs the console into thinking youre using controller. Epic couldnt stop it in fortnite with all their money so ubisoft has no chance.
---
Regardless of control if you fire a mag into a wall on pc and a mag into a wall on console the bullets on pc will finish higher up than console, thus more recoil. Obviously its easier to control recoil on pc but that doesnt change that the base recoil is higher on pc than it is on console. If you were to control recoil then the bullets on console would finish higher up but its not because of the recoil itself its just that its harder to compensate for it on sticks.
---
Say hello to c4
---
That comes from a spawnpeeking doc main lol
---
Best - Kaid
---
Most fun - Amaru
---
Yeah Lesion is totally top tier, kapkan less so. But i still see concussions as quite good. Maybe it’s just conjecture on my part.
---
Okay thanks
---
Oh yeah, but a hologram that can follow anyone who drives through it with a drone or shoots it for 5 seconds, or a drone that can see movement through walls, or a magic knife that can suck information out of injured people's necks and give it to an entire team are realistic.
---
Looks like someone's salty because they're a non-Caveira roamer.
---
Jackal is the easiest op in the world to bait. Just get a friend to be holding an angle, and wait somewhere where the jackal will expose himself to find you.
---
I'm in the U.S.
---
Many players are more childish than the kid players themselves.
---
No shit they're using an adapter that's how it works. Ubisoft doesn't support it but they still let it be around since most companies. At least ones that care about their game on certain platforms. For example the Apex Legends team and the Dice team can see what kind of device is being used. 
---
Again pc bullets do not go higher. That is untrue that they do. Again console has less control over their weapons. Less control is more recoil. Higher bullet into the wall. I've played both platforms of the game. Console has less control, higher recoil. No matter how much you can control it console has more recoil than pc. Pc has less, you've provided no proof towards your side. You've only backed mine on this. All the evidence you can source is from 3 years ago. That's not an argument or valid one at all.
---
If you are not right in front of the enemy, the shotgun takes like 3-4 shots to kill, when you spam it, it kicks a lot and you need to compensate for the vertical recoil, pallets have radnomized spread as well, and if a shotgun wouldn't kill in 1 shot at close range, what's the point? I think the shotgun is nothing special and you need to play extremely smart to be effective with it and you still risk a lot.
---
I would like to point this special man to the words in the parentheses above
---
You think that's jarring? Wait until I tell you that they're exactly like Bandit's eyes.
---
He was too powerful while being too easy, hopefully these changes fix that so I can play him again.

The Vityaz-SN is a 9×19mm Parabellum submachine gun (also known as the pp-19-01 ) developed in 2004 by Izhmash (now Kalashnikov). It is based on the AK-74 and offers a high degree of parts commonality with the AK-74. The gun is directly developed from the PP-19 Bizon. It is the standard submachine gun for all branches of the Russian military and police forces.

 **Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.**
---
This happens rather frequently in T-Hunt. Sometimes the killfeed is a bit behind too, just like the "mission successful" screen. I already uninstalled, installed, verified all files (multiple times).
---
Which button is the secondary gadget XD is it the ability of the op or like flashes and smokes etc
---
I just start up a private party by myself before I play Seige. I know I need to play with headphones but hearing obnoxious kids and random loud ass noises in the background gets aggravating. I would like to speak to new people but the freaking discord for Seige is useless, I'm still relatively new to the game so seeing the discord full of nothing but ranked is irritating.
---
You must be an ELECTRIC FACTORY at parties
---
No they can't. They can only detect it if the mnk is plugged directly into the console. If its through an adapter they cant see shit. If they could then ubisoft would prevent players using mnk on console entirely. It would make them way more money if they could fix that issue.
---
I have provided evidence. The video is evidence. Your only counterpoint is that its 3 years old but the age of the video doesnt matter if you cant provide a more recent source that proves that it no longer works how its shown in the video, other than sight misalignment, which doesnt change that pc has more recoil, just where the bullets go. Ive also given you steps to replicate my testing that shows pc has more recoil so you can see for yourself. Ok whats your proof to your claims? That youve played on both platforms? Why is your word any more valid than mine when you havent given proof i can look at or test myself to confirm your "proof". 
---
Im not saying pc doesnt have more control over their guns. Obviously they do which is why mnk is far better for fps' than controller.  Its why in my testing i eliminated control over recoil and fired mags into a wall doing nothing but ads and holding down fire. No movement of the mouse or the right stick. They were fired in the exact same spot and started at the exact same point.
---
I play on console and I have anyone who's not in a party with me muted by default. I'm too old to deal with all the toxic bullshit that comes with trying to play with randoms so I just do my thing.
---
"Authorities have arrested a suspected cartel leader, he is currently in custody and his vibe is being checked"

Would be an interesting operator if 3 speed. Give him impacts so he can close off his own flank routes. Or a shotgun at least to create rotations and be able to close rotations.
---
Basically, when G2 began on their downward spiral they, for whatever reason, singled out joonas as the culprit. I believe there was also some internal disagreement. Of course, that was stupid bullshit. And the way they handled his ejection was very bad. They basically said nothing and did nothing to remember/honor him. They clearly left him on bad terms.
---
They handled Goga’s departure much better, which you can see from the simple goodbye video they posted. Clearly was at least amicable and they left on good terms.
---
Yes they can. Other companies do this, ubisoft most definitely can. 
---
about your testing. You need to provide proof that you have. You need to show you actually did test it in the same spot because that's very difficult to do. I highly doubt you did and found nothing to be different. My proof is that they're both the same amount of recoil if you can't read. Because they are. They have the same exact build of the game . And they do, and since they're the exact same nothing is different. Meaning neither have worse or less because they don't. But factoring in controllability console can control it less and has more recoil because of that.
---
He's gonna be important as a late round defender like smoke.
---
I got my starter with a 50% discount for about $4.5 man looking back I feel like the luckiest person. Oh yeah I have all the ops and earned attachments played for 4 years now reee. ;) It was fun grinding thunt house and old Hereford hostage. Matches end in under 40 seconds with 200+ renown. Good ol times

It’s because ppl are afraid to be judged and criticized by that toxic sweat  tbh

Did Hibana try and run away?

probably, I’m just a dumb gremlin who defaulted to taking a photo and only remembered after I posted

What weapon did you get it for?
---
Wtf was that
---
You mean details like the Mematic watermark in the bottom left lmao?
---
Trash
---
I don't even play this game
---
I'd argue Goyo is Kapkan's new best friend...what with the "Volcain on a double door that's EDD'd" being an instant kill combo.
---
You still beat 3 other individuals who had numbers, health, and bullets on their side. Be proud family!!
---
Thanks man!
---
You're in my frost mat. [wink]
---
1. Try talking in-game and pick persons that act decently and play well.
---
2. Add those people to your squad.
---
3. Enjoy a match better time in Siege!
---
Yes
---
Haha you lost credibility saying "Jäger also has a shotgun for soft breaching." Who tf uses M870 on Jäger outside of Causal?
---
Also, if you're just putting grizmots on walls, you're not a good Ela. You can easily hide them. IQ exists for the reason of dealing with that kind of shit.
---
If you land a body shot, then oh well. You will learn better crosshair placement and recoil control over time, especially if the Scorpion is buffed, yknow, the part of my comment youre completely ignoring because youd rather whine "ela bad." 
---
Lastly... you really dont know what an MP is? Wow. How long have you been playing this game? Yes, it's a machine pistol. Smg-11, Smg-12, Bearing 9, C75, and whatever tf Clashes is called. Ring a bell? They all have the highest TTK in this game. You know what else does? The Scorpion. How is that balanced? They're given high recoil and damage fall off! Its almost like that is why I'm saying to buff the Scorpion!
---
Jfc this fucking sub... "ELA 9 NERFS. ELA 9 NERFS. ELA 9 NERFS." Its like the god damn seagulls on Nemo. You people look at this game like its a fucking board game...
---
It's called talk-to-text moron and if that statement was true this post wouldn't exist
---
is the show in spanish or english? if its in spanish i dont have to bother downloading it
---
Thank you for acknowledging it my friend
---
The only one I can think of at the moment is Glaz/Kali  
---
I'm sure there's more
---
Thought you only had buckshot.
---
Be a real person, stuff a made up there
---
I’m not trowing or anything. Just got a second account and am running around in casual as Caveira and having fun.
---
Yeah thats fine.
---
Is she really banned that much? Like dang.
---
Personally I think the shotguns need a little buffing, just a little.
---
I wonder how this affects the Ela Elite desirability, like it looks like it seems pretty moot to buy that skin if the OP is too nerfed.
---
It's one of the cleanest imo, but I heard Buck's going to be getting an elite and I also play him quite a lot so I don't know if I should just wait for that.
---
No
---
Me either
---
..are you okay
---
just joke
---
Valk
---
They won’t give you the operators, you can buy them all but you won’t have them giving out at the beginning.
---
Wow, a skin coming to Fortnite looks like an actual military uniform
---
I'd love to buy one
---
No. You have to buy them individually although i think theres still a bundle for one of the years ops.
---
Yeah modern warfare has that same military uniform
---
Why do people ship IQ x Blitz? I'm not criticizing, I just want to know.
---
Pretty sure most military uniforms have a chain mail fully black headgear like NØKK
---
Oh, I could have sworn I saw something like “try all ops for free”... Does anyone else know anything about this?
---
"No no no, don't kick him guys!"
---
Vote kick initiated (3/4)
---
Vote kick initiated (4/4)
---
You have been kicked from the match.
---
Perfectly cut
---
I think they said have access to all operators but I didn’t saw anything about new ops given for free.
---
April, won’t say it’s wrong
---
The bottom vehicle is A Rivian Truck, an all-electric truck that should be on the market next year that competes directly with the Tesla Truck.

I would kill for enter the gungeon r6 crossover

it all started with a rickety trolly down toward briney beach...
---
Frost  and Lesion work better together
---
It’s netting and it’s danish. From the frogman corps specifically. As of 2015 they were moved to special operations as opposed to the royal danish navy.
---
I think I have a problem the glaz one almost looked like a swatzika and now this one kinda looks like a Iron Cross
---
This is my new favorite siege clip.
---
You bastard
---
You could also join the R6 looking for group Sub if you're pressed for teammates to hook up with
---
Nah fam a true Jäger or bandit main knows how to take advantage of that 3 SPEED by running outside into spawn and getting an ace.
---
were you playing with one hand or something
---
9 times being nerfed. She's not picked or banned that much at all. I haven't played much of siege as of late. That's due to the onslaught of mnk console players and server lag switching happening. But last I checked Ela was never chosen outside me playing her. 
---
This new nerf I suspect will literally kill her. It's her only viable choice and reliable choice in her kit of all things that it has. It is a good gun. It is better than other shotguns. But it's not overpowered. 1 positive trait and 4 negatives I don't believe warrants a nerf to remove the positive trait. Because then what's the point of using it at all?
---
A new challenger approaches
---
There’s no cost for siege as well, except play time. You can still be successful with based operators, a lot of the based operators are still very good in the current meta.
---
Everything he is saying is accurate, and this Ubisoft Dev video explains it. The whole video is good, but if you're too anxious for the Kali part, it's after 3 minutes 30 seconds. https://youtu.be/dys2crQAU1I
---
What keyboard is that?
---
Had a game today where the only op banned was thermite..... was sad
---
No you cant.
---
Occasionally there are a couple map bugs like when outback was first released there was  window with some tin scrap covering that could be rappelled through but that was quickly fixed and generally the playerbase is creative with dealing with those such as placing a frost mat there. The game is overall a lot more polished than on release since they care about the game now.

Now wait for Ubi to nerf it into oblivion again cause "iT's NoT suPpOSed tO be A pRiMAry"

Yes, but gameplay content is locked, unlike overwatch.

Why do you think battlefield had so many people upset? It was the grind for a game that was full price where gameplay was locked.
---
Wont be a primary once bosg acog
---
Shield?
---
They're such a cute couple :)
---
I've played with it, all it did was turn a super meme weapon (which basically was throwing if you used it) into a weapon that's viable for specific situations. The K1A will still be the meta pick after this for sure.
---
Too bad it was such a boring season
---
What am I looking at, I'm very confused
---
Yea, was thinking a Montagne or thermite main
---
They aren't generally getting kills.
---
i always use bosg
---
I'm lonely though
---
I got vote kicked once for putting too many smiley faces in chat
---
What caused them to start caring?
---
Also trash
---
I played since grim sky on asean server and i swear only 12 year olds and annoying indian tech scammers on break time only have mics in this game
---
Go fuck yourself
---
The way the majority of the playerbase responds to a woman's voice makes me *wish* they'd just votekick me instead.
---
This is why it annoys me to see people  talk about how having a mic is mandatory. It's unplayable with a mic.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
Yeah, probably a solid utility player
---
Good?
---
They realised they could make more money if they kept up support instead of treating it as a quick cash grab. I dont know what specifically changed to have them start caring.
---
But like that's one of the worst seasons of Seige
---
TIL its against the rules to say Ela isnt a bad operator. Guess I have to board the bandwagon. 
---
Elas been nerfed 9 times. Fucking waaaaaaa.
---
Uhh, no you
---
It’s funny how everyone who believes in the whole xenophobic bullshit are usually the more aggressive and angry people. I was just saying it’s hilarious and you’re legit pissed 😂
---
Thanks.
---
I've gotten votekicked for an ace twice because I played recruit
---
Sorry bro this community is low key toxic
---
Wait, actually?
---
0.7 isn't even really bad though anyways. 
---
Could also be an Ash main who gets an average of 4 kills on attack and around 3 on defense playing anchor.
---
pretty toxic like every other game
---
/r/R6STeams/
---
Not to be weird, but what platform and region do you play on? My sister goes through similar experiences, and I'm sure she'd enjoy squading up now and then.
---
I thought the EDD's explosions would destroy the welcome mat?
---
How the turns have tabled.
---
whatever your team needs
---
People will just bitch that 4 stacks will never be able to find a 5th player. Fuck 4 stacks honestly. Always the most toxic cunts.
---
I really hope your kind die off tbh
---
Instead of running away
---
Holup
---
Who else thinks this should be the new buff?
---
I feel like this would be great for the new sniper
---
Oh what the fuck
---
The fuck are you on about? It isn't against the rules. The rules you broke are acting like an elitist. Which is against the rules cause you can't and you were. Ela has been nerfed 9 times, you can count. Most of which were unjust and have made her one of the worst operators in game. She really needs a rework or just a simple push in the right direction. But people like you refuse to believe so because "FO-12 OP 2019"
---
In no particular order:
---
Capitau, finka, Kaplan, nokk, sledge, thermite, maverick
---
We gunsta have a good night tonight boys.
---
Google it, Ubisoft is hiding the truth
---
I did not act like an elitist, but okay. Youre just being sensitive.
---
I haven't even expressed an opinion what are you on about?
---
Git gud.
---
They need to put in more sights in general... AND REMOVE ACOGS
---
Honestly, just keep matchmaking until you either *somehow* find a decent group of folks in casual, or keep playing until your cleared to play ranked. 
---
Voice chat would also help increase your chances.
---
that was a nasty shot nice
---
Whatever your team needs the most that round.
---
I’m already good I need to find someone to focus on dumbass
---
For the most major offense of acting like one here you go "Jfc this fucking sub... "ELA 9 NERFS. ELA 9 NERFS. ELA 9 NERFS." Its like the god damn seagulls on Nemo. You people look at this game like its a fucking board game..." Elitist.
---
Love it
---
The only correct answer
---
Well, at least you didnt add the 1 pixel under each end part
---
In that case you have a problem with pretty much all online games. In cod weapons and equipment you need to be a certain level before unlocking them. Same for bf.  In OW 2  they will put tweaks on ability and ults behind level so it’s grinding. 
---
There’s nothing wrong with a bit of "grinding" , you can easily get operators if you are willing to play the game.
---
There is no official release date. They released the info about the new operators about a week and a half ago now. They've been on the test server for 11 days now since the 11th. So I'll estimate about over 2 more weeks due to them stating that new seasons will undergo approx. 3 weeks of tts before going live. But my money is on either December 2nd or the 9th to be exact at 3-4 total weeks of testing.
---
Fair point
---
Who cares? Are you really offended or are you just looking for a reason to argue?
---
The music gets on my nerves so bad. It’s so loud
---
Sorry fam, the game is 99 percent toxic. Don't put pressure on yourself and just have fun in casual. You'll eventually meet some cool people you can group up with. The game is INFINTELY more fun when you're playing with a group and not randos.
---
Fixing blitz = Warden buff
---
Big brain time
---
It depends on what ur team comp is but I think a kaid is actually really useful and would be a good main
---
But there is no cav?? Nani?
---
No I'm not really offended I'm just sick of bastards like you who act like fucking pricks all day and go against actual facts and data provided by someone who shares a different opinion.

What's going on? Sorry, I'm kinda clueless lol

---
Free weekend in a nutshell. What am i witnessing
---
What the fuck
---
Honestly it just sounds like your team is defusing too soon. I could see maybe like, if the defusers progress degraded, but pausing it would just tip the scales completely. Honestly the defusers timeframe is one of the few things that the devs actually planned out well. It's fast enough to sneak a defuse but long enough that it can be interrupted if the defenders get in on you
---
Holy cow dude.. now I see it.. wtf
---
Rook or doc is always good
---
music volume 00 😎
---
Yeah I see the penalty but why did u get it?
---
Yeah that shouldn’t take you too long. Assuming you’re playing 5-6 hours of unranked every day it shouldn’t take you more than 2 weeks. A month at most.
---
I finished a casual and the notification popped up that I left a ranked match.
---
Just play montagne and back up to the corner at the end of the round. God that’s infuriating and hilarious at the same time. I even do it time to time. I once backed and attacker into a corner that they couldn’t get out of with montagne on a 1v1 and they tried soooo hard lmfao. The chat was lit while the clock ticked away. I fuckin almost died laughing.
---
What there totally is. Hold server stairs on bank with an acog. Peek from garage with a red dot. Having and not having a laser has downsides and upsides just like the sights and the grips, allowing you to just switch at your whim removes any downside to not having it, you can’t just switch your sight or your grip in the middle of a match.
---
Try verifying game files if on steam. If that doesnt work maybe try contacting ubisoft support.
---
Uhh yea I play like twice a week and mainly play other games so and why they gotta be so expensive not everyone can play that much and is that good
---
Nice man!
---
I still like glaz better
---
Local game files have been verified and a ticket has been created the only issue is that they take forever to respond lol
---
TeAmKiLlInG dOeSnT hApPeN iN rAnKeD!
---
If you wants a sweaty time then jump on ranked, if you lose to much it will eventually stop as the game will matchmake you with easier opponents anyway. Better if u dont have a mic, allot of toxic players on rainbow and turn voice chat volume to zero and text chat off, avoid toxicity
---
That's odd..
---
Generally I agree that the barricade should be destroyed on impact rather than on deployment, however Amaru is far from useless.
---
Gadget aside, we'll get to it, she has an incredible primary weapon with very high fire rate and mag size, an option between top tier utility (ITA12s) or the highest DPS weapon in the game (SMG 11) for her secondary, and flashbangs which are extremely useful fragging utility on top of projectiles to burn ADS's (and soon magnets). All around Amaru has an incredible kit, and that alone makes her a justifiable choice in the fragging/breaching role.
---
As for the gara hook, originally she could grapple to any vaultable surface, but the devs didn't think it fit the game aesthetically. They didn't say it was OP or broken, they just didn't think it fit the game. Personally, I disagree with the devs and I think that this would be an interesting dynamic, ESPECIALLY considering the risk involved given the long delay between landing and using your weapon.
---

---
Ultimately, I seriously doubt Amaru will see any changes before the pro league grace period is over. Amaru is not a rusher, Amaru is designed to take difficult map control typically only accessible through rappels (#1 example is Admin Office on Consulate). Amaru is designed with droning in mind, If you grapple into a room without droning it out first you deserve to get fragged. You need to gather intel and at high levels your teammates will be reliable enough to drone FOR YOU, giving you the ability to react in a split second and take that difficult map control.
---
Not as often lmao
---
Yeah, but you said they messed up. How is it a mess up if it's to fix team chemistry issues
---
true, but with the smoky backgrounds and Nokk and Warden there was some great artworks out there
---
I would really see a problem with it, just as long as it's there only during operator select. This could be a way for ubisoft to rake in more money.
---
Old hereford won't be missed by me, the whole map might as well be that one staircase.
---
If it makes you feel better I got banned for an hour for tk on hostage...
---
Do it in the action phase next time hehe
---
Thing is she has a toothpick in her mouth so wouldn't this be lesion?

I'd love the ash one, hopefully she gets a face rework as well to look closer to what she did during the CGI.

I stopped playing with people and did terrorist hunt solo or with friends then eventually stopped playing it because everytime i play with people i get team killed or this one time this guy was "reviving" me and then killing me over n over again calling me shit at the game or one person threatned hed come to my house n murder me in my sleep with a rusty razor blade lol i had a bad experience with the multyplayer...

Allow me to introduce you to xbox ranked.

Blizzard tried it. Best players got blacklisted by everyone just so they didn't have to play against them in ranked.

the game doesnt force you to buy every single operator, just buy the ones you want then unlock the other ones as you go. like i said its honestly not that long to unlock new operators if you just play the game.
---
 i started playing with grim sky and im only missing 5 operators (thats even with taking breaks for weeks at a time), and thats mainly because i already unlocked the ones i wanted and spent the renown on alpha packs.
---
My idea is that it doesn’t affect who you play against, just who you play with.

ok bye

To be fair I'd argue someone choosing to use OP things because they're OP and that's the way they like to play is pretty scumbaggy, but in this context your point still stands.

NVMe 32 Gigabytes per second, vs 32 Gigabits which is 8 times less
---
But... But it's a duplicate...
---
Idk why but shit like this makes me laugh so hard lol
---
Well, give it a year, and they'll probably do a rework or something. Otherwise that Elite skin will just be sitting around...maybe. Like would people still buy the Elite skin if all these nerfs make playing her super suboptimal? Does she have the same meme draw as like Tachanka?
---
Because I can see people buying a Tachanka elite just to be "ironic" or something.
---
But there's also Caveira and Ela coming before that, so it might be a little while. Ultimately it's your personal preference. Who do you like the most? You only mention one attacker, Hibana, so I assume your best and favourite attacker is her. Why not get her elite?
---
Bruh... Do not get me started on your username
---
That’s not black ice. Downvoted
---
Well, if your internet is so shit it can't even connect to the server, everyone will have to wait for you to connect for game to start. And then you get kicked anyway because your shit connection times out...
---
i really like how you know where he stood and that you shot him through the barricade
---
That's how you get back into your old game. You start matchmaking again and it'll show it searching for a game for a few seconds/half a minute then it throws you back in your old game

I think you misunderstood me. Mira is not an intel operator. That's not what her gadget does. If you think Mira is "just a better camera operator" you're probably one of those people that places a Mira window on reinforced walls that look outside.

Usually for me I get level 50s and play against golds and plats in casual.

I've pointed out there is one, they have an option to play it if they wanted, same as you. You could always play another playlist over the w.e since you are not happy with them playing in your game.

You really like making it seem like it’s my game also what is w.e you seem to really dislike this but are going much further with it I’ve said my side and I’m done with it a fair compromise would be a better match making or is that also to much to ask for
---
All I can say is... weeeeeeeeee
---
I mean sure, I get it.
---
My proposition is to play with a full squad of people you can vouch for and possibly even mute the other team's text chat if needed.
---
Jesus yeah that's a problem

Ok cool man thanks for the input/ constructive advice have a good one

O k casual

Your time of being alive is up

Monitors are speakers in the audio world. Or they could be headphones. You know the small wedge speakers on the stage that are facing the band? Those are monitors. Monitors are any speakers that are meant for the person making the music as opposed to the speakers that are pointed at the crowd. Or in a studio, monitors are the speakers the guy behind the big mixing console is listening to while the band is in another room playing on other speakers. It's just a term audio geeks use to say these are the speakers or headphones that I listen to.

---
Go back to call of Duty.
---
I've taken all that into account, and I do not believe the game ever was a Call Of Duty, neither I want it to be. I believe speed doesn't take away from the tactical gameplay experience, if anything, it enhances it. It gets your blood pumping when you coordinate a fast push through a site to clean it up like a Spec Ops real operation. Just my humble opinion though.
---
No, but you run faster with a pistol equipped.
---
Should be flaired "misleading title" lmao
---
I love this tbh ur acc talented
---
Oh nice, thank you so much!
---
I love unironically maining Warden. I just love his submachine gun. I also love the SMG12. So he is perfect for me. Even if his gadget is weak in 90% of situations
---
You alway get the charm of the highest rank you got in a season. So yes you'll get a plat charm.
---
Seems like there's no other counterpoint to what I'm saying other than speed making the game a call of duty. I do not believe that, and I haven't ever played Call of Duty.
---
Well that's a huge advantage, aim correction is everything in competitive shooters by playing with MnK you do have an edge
---
A squaded 5 man stack shouldnt be afk kicked. How many times have you or anyone else gone to get a coke or use t he bathroom really quick to come back after being kicked. 
---
Quaility of life in improvement or morale dropper. It's the latter for me. I was 9/2 with my buddies went to go get a cup of joe and come back to 0:01 left and booted.
---
Sit there on the loading screen waiting for ubi to load the servers and then you make a move, only to come back and see you've been kicked. I dont even want to play the game anymore at that point.
---
Behold. The only situation in the game where Warden is not entirely worthless. Being chased down by an operator that no one uses. Thank you Ubi for the great update containing this great operator.
---
Is that coming from one? Or someone vicariously offended on their behalf.
---

---
Nah, is way more is easier, tokyo on spanish is written Tokio, money heist is an spanish series and has a character called tokyo but in spanish so the charm has the spanish version of tokyo, wich it would be Tokio, sorry if its confusing but take it like this
---
English: tokYo
---
Spanish: tokIo
---
I found it funny, That’s why I posted this. I didn’t ask how to make sure you don’t shoot a teammate.
---
No I don’t think. I haven’t seen a keyboard and mouse player in siege in a while. But that could just be luck
---
The Fo-12 is one of the lowest damaging shotguns at range. Is one of the lowest damaging shotguns by default actually. 3rd lowest just about the super 90 and aa12. Has a wide spread, high recoil, and low damage fall off. If she's banned why do I never see her in the first place? She's never picked to be banned nor is she ever in casual either. I play console and every reason they said why they're nerfing her is not true. Buffing her smg to counter the shotgun nerf still nerfs and makes her worse. The shotgun is balanced in that its only positive trait is the fire rate and now they're going to make it so you can't fire fast without being penalized dramatically. Making it have no positive traits about it. Making it one of the worst shotguns. Buffing the scorpion which is the worst gun in game as it's the only one without a horizontal recoil diamond would only make it mediocre. So you go from a balanced gun and the worst gun to a shit gun and a mediocre gun. That's not good for an operator.
---
Oh my god this made my day... poor mans gold for you 🏅

No that was gearboxes intention https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-3/borderlands-3-midget

I’m pretty sure it’s just a custom menu song for the event I can’t find anything referencing the tv series. Just look up rainbow six siege la casa de papel ost

Bro I laughed so hard to this😂
---
there's that wall that divides the bar and u can vault on top of the bar
---
Bro that's crazy
---
KD doesn't matter on casual dumbass
---
From what I've seen of videos from console PC is much quicker pace in the gun play, you can't expect to see some one for more than a split second before they're shooting at you. where as on console people are often limited by aiming speed, PC players can snap to and click on your head very quickly.
---
Haha lol
---
Professor=Six
---
The FO-12 is the 3rd lowest damaging shotgun last I checked the wiki and ubi stat charts on their website. It only beats the super 90 and aa12. Though the super 90 is a funny thing for me because even though it's the worst shotgun for range it has a very tight spread it seems as that gun still fairly decent damage at mid range. But... The FO-12 like I said does the 3rd lowest damage of all shotgun, has a very averagish spread and without the extended barrel a wide one. High recoil, and a low fall off range. 4 negatives, not too great is it? The only positive it has is the fire rate which balances out the low damage but it itself is balanced by the spread and recoil. That's a balanced gun right there. And now they're nerfing the amount you can quickly fire. Not in fire rate cap but in where your penalized for firing fast so now it has no advantage over other shotguns. 
---
I'm just like, "Ubi this is her 9th nerf. No one plays her in the actual community who isn't the 2% plat and above pc players. You have to learn that she's not good anymore, you made her go from overpowered to one of the worst operators in game. How do you manage to overlook that?"
---
Wtf, I get ~100-140 with a GTX 980ti and an i7-4770
---
The Lord is always woke
---
Well I'd wish it were that easy hahaha. I've been playing all this time and yet I haven't fully adapted to it. There's something that just feels off. And having played past versions of the game, I can say it used to feel just that much smoother.
---
Besides, tking for fun is enough of a shithead to be mad at. I’m pretty sure you’re not a fan of getting killed whenever you spawn.

High dpi low sens. 
---
I’m not too sure people who use low dpi understand why it’s not as good unless I’ve missed something, but higher dpi means your mouse is literally sending more information in the same amount of space so it’s a smoother experience. 400dpi feels choppy to me
---
ok nigga
---
I’m personally not. The OP is. It does look cool and it looks similar and that’s why OP said that
---
Telling someone that they haven't grasped and idea and being wrong by yourself is kinda selfish. At least admit that you were wrong and everything would be fine. Now you're just look like an idiot.

I mean, not *everything* is possible at the moment. As much as I’d love for the game to bug out on my own screen and show fuze hanging off the side of a flying dragon, the model for a dragon isn’t in a game. One day though...

I think it's a good map. A lot of fun to me (and no I don't spawnpeek)

That game they kept spawn peaking ya through that window and killing me so I just learned that game.
---
All hail #droneskins !
---
Or, maybe we could replace Amaru's Gaara hook with a big wheel.
---
Agreed, diamond skin. Bought it way back when and have never changed it.
---
Or maybe like 2x renown for the more or sum like that
---
negative reinforcement at its finest. good on you buddy
---
Lol @ every weekend. Boy that would be the best deal ever.
---
Just a correction dude. Don’t have to get your panties in a twist.
---
That's cool! Upvoted!
---
Get this trash outta here, the only way I’d accept this is if the character is high as balls off their own supply
---
That deserve silver
---
Uh oh
---
You're breathtaking
---
Yeah but Ash doesnt count
---
I'll twist your panties.

There is a few on the picnic tables on outback and a few others laying around on shelves on various maps

Fucking do it pussy

I'm gold on Xbox and this never would have happened
---
Well then, hello there fellow Shikikan of culture
---
Assault, called like that because when you open it and take a breath you feel like youve just been assaulted.
---
Looking all retarded.
---
10/10 would not f with you
---
Go for deluxe edition. Standard edition is just too grindy for me. Gold edition maybe if you want more characters to play with. Ultimate edition if you want to unlock everything, however it takes some of the out of r6

How much damage does that do?
---
Switch to another drone and then yours
---
Great title
---
I’d love her elite skin to be super casual like that
---
I have standard and I’ve had it for a year and I have 4 ops and they were all 10-15 k renown
---
Meeting of elite squad 😁
---
 Probably added vodka, they are still Russian.
---
Great nickname
---
Lol, my friend always uses thermites and zofias gadgets on soft walls and barricades, and it so hard to not scream at him.
---
I can never wrap my head around why people think it's a good idea to go off site to use cams
---
The next best thing is killing you before you snitch lol
---
So basically, if I will never want to play on the test servers, i can delete the test server version?
---
The game has been going this way for a couple of years now, like removing casual maps and night maps, and ranked modes. I think they're just renaming casual because they want everyone sweating and being toxic, rather than saying 'chill it's just casual'.
---
I just love the music Soundsmith did for the season
---
Lol
---
Lmao I just got it it after 3 days

forget fucking trips to space for 20mil. could elon musk send like 100k of these to mars, and sell control of them each for like 1,000$ ?
---
I mean you arent wrong
---
With rook it depends. I usually take impacts to make rotation holes, blow open hatches, etc. And for Thatcher it depends on who you're playing with. If you're alone I'd take a claymore to cover runouts because you cant always count on randoms to actually pay attention. And if you're in a squad with friends I'd say breach charges. You'll likely be paired up with a thermite or someone else with a claymore, so the breaches bring more utility
---
The amount of times Pengu has gotten fucked up by this spot man. Lol

Why am I being downvoted?I struggle in soloque.I did not downvote you by the way.Damn even the community sucks
---
What platform?
---
Thank you hopefully I will get used to them and thanks again
---
*Just Like The Simulations*
---
I just know that there's more to this game than point and shoot and I would like to learn some of the different strategies and stuff so I don't piss off my teammates lol
---
Nah, some Vigil counter type
---
That's how they stayed hidden all this time
---
I know the nerf for echo only.
---
I started playin when she came out, I couldn’t agree more
---
They can't stop us all
---
Neither, sniper woman seems a bit weak and the other guy has a recycled gun.
---
Ngl I get scared shitless when I see her.
---
I target her first.
---
I'd get 2 of em
---
I disagree I think it’s a laser beam. You just gotta work on hitting your shots cause those 26 bullets go quick
---
You mean fix people being assholes? Not really Ubi’s problem to solve, that’s a player base thing.

Better hide before he divides your cheeks.
---
Yeah it’s just that the rate of fire can be pretty intimidating at first
---
oh the tall building
---
I’m CRYING RIGHT NOW
---
100% true
---
Zofia has strong utility and a fantastic AR to boot. Can play both fragger/entry or a soft support.
---
Yes, please stop shooting our drones Mute
---
I don’t see it
---
How is it related to r/Rainbow6?
---
That is so perfect
---
It popped up mid game saying that I got banned, couldn't grab a pic of it coz I was trying not to die, won the game now have a ban
---
No.
---
Nope. You didnt hit the head.
---
Look at the revolvers chambers
---
R6 fanart...
---
*Yeah... sure*
---
Okay, I've just never seen it anywhere before
---
Its close enough for government work
---
Once we figure out the map more, it’ll be easy to know the best obj for the defenders first round so soon enough we’ll be able to find it easily
---
It's so stupid, all it is is a pointless cash grab.
---
I’ll take your entire stock
---
Ok boomer
---
Been doing this since d1 of TTS, doesn't catch as many people as you'd think
---
People really out here stating statistics over a joke lmaooo I got the joke and I appreciate it
---
I loaded an smg clip into capitao's back earlier and he just turned around and killed me
---
I would suggest trying each out for a few games and seeing which sits better with how you play. And then start tweaking as you go along until you find something and feels right. Don't think you have to find 1 sens/dpi combo and stick with it. I've changed DPI and sense a number of times during my time playing as sometimes it just doesn't feel the same as usual or I'm not hitting shots and I normally do. It's good to test and find your preference.
---
Think of it more so as when ops put hands in front of their face after being flashed their hands won’t stop bullets and more so it improves overall headshot feeling like they land when they should
---
It seems like a good idea but may be hard to use in reality
---
Recruits already overpowered
---
Yeah. It would be a learning curve and take good coordination but I think it would be beneficial
---
Site* but close enough.
---
I agree
---
How tf do u manage to roll the candela iv tried like 90 times to do it and it never works it just slams on the floor
---
Zofia. Mac is just not good in ranked, and overall zof has more usefulness in a lot more situations.
---
Were you blown up or shocked to death?
---
Ayo what year is twitch’s drone coming out
---
So does that mean that like Blackbeard I can survive a shot to the face?
---
No?
---
Consistency Uni, consistency!
---
Not quite yet. It's only a stand, after all.
---
Recruit rush is always the solution to any problems
---
God damn Ubisoft
---
It would probably take the drywall with it lol
---
Spawnpeeking lol
---
I knew I wasn't the only one to think siege should have a Mall as a map
---
Yeah, this needs to be the tachanka rework
---
Marvelous Cosplay &amp; Photography.
---
that gun has infinite recoil
---
cool
---
Never realized Gridlock's hands look fucking disgusting.
---
Is it the Girls Frontline one?
---
Yo I love Diablo 3
---
Not bad idea but i think that Mantis special weapon could be doing more then only a litte damage maybe poisoning or so?
---
Would smash ngl
---
dont give them ideas, this also very nice
---
Looks like a shake weight
---
Well, finally a sniper worth actually using, maybe.
---
Honestly it wouldn't make him broken. Without an acog who won't be prime spawn peek material even with one extra headshot tanking. But he would be an excellent angle holder and anchor.
---
Well tie me up with yarn and beat me to death with a fern!
