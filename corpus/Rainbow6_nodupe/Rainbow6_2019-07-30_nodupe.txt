This was not made by me but when I was trying to find recruit icon I came across it here the creator is seen in the top left corner
---
Das wut im saying I bandit tricked two theremite charges and as soon as i did that my team died and i clutched 1v5 then i loss the game with 17-6-4 so I really wish it at least played a factor.
---
Because your rank is completely determined by your team, which is stupid.
---
uwu what's this
---
Hey I’ve got a mouse just like that!
---
no
---
This a very neat mosuepad though, do you have the ref?
---
I just play regularly, pretty much everyday for a couple of hours. I only spend renown on dlc operators when they release, otherwise I just hold onto it. It has taken quite a while to build up this much tho
---
I started playing since black ice got all the operators since Velvet Shell
---
Thanks to u/xXsilverXx281 for putting all this together

Depends on your PC. A powerfull one will surpass console but a weaker one will look shity

Being the one typically in charge of bandit tricking I feel this.

Very unexpected for reddit to be honest. But considering you are from Europe i dont think i should be surprised. 
---
And yeah it is even more fun with friends. Since youre on EU you could hop into 77th JSOC. Thats where i had most of the fun. Its all vanilla so you dont need mods.
---
Though you can also create your own scenarios too. If you think about buying it also take apex. Since almost every server uses stuff from it. The other dlcs are very optional.

I just feel like most people on console are just kids with nothing better to do so it’s a free zone to them, not like anyone else is trying to have fun besides them
---
Time to buy a mic
---
Agree
---
Explain
---
Same thing happens to me (xbox) and even on casual, it doesn't bug me as much as it used to I just let them do it and go on to the next game or have a rest from it.
---
Most is probably from kids or immature adults who feel powerful over gamed because in reality the wouldn't do that in real life because they have no backbone when alone.
---
I showed you my nest of beauties, your turn.
---
True. Didn’t know that thanks.
---
don’t worry, I met a 40 year old man who enjoys picking on teenagers because they kill him. He was so sad, I actually felt bad for him. I would post the chat I had with him but I would have to censor practically everything he said
---
I usually over think things and panic in those kinda situations which is why if I don't have a good team most of the time the game is lost unless the other four are a stack or something

I love my elite. Dont think I could play without it.
---
Damn that sounds messed up
---
I only solo queue and barely got the game recently, I'm not a super good player but with a decent team with mics I can do okay but when three people are afk or fucking around in spawn it's kinda hard to clutch
---
I'm on PS4 myself. The SMG12 and Baring 9 on the other hand are unusable

That sounds awesome, they would fit very well into Rainbow Six

---
Yeah pretty much. From all the posts I’ve been seeing on here lately, it seems like I got away from console at the right time. It seems like the overall toxicity and ddosing problems are only getting worse. I was just under level 170 with a shitload of cosmetics I paid for and I don’t mind having to start over one bit. I wish I could at least transfer all my in-game purchases to my new account, but I honestly don’t mind just cause I’m not dealing with all that shit.
---
Why is every good meme copied from 4chan.
---
Yes
---
Someone who was on your team lately (friend or random) was cheating in some way. That’s why you lost Elo. 
---
If you’d been cheating you’d have been banned.
---
Ive been thinking the same. Only problem is Glaz already kinda does that. 
---
I have a hunch they would be the new Ash too, just 100% fragging focused.
---
Hol'up, is that an SCP?
---
one thing he said was “I bet you get a hard on from cutting yourself” that pisses me off because I actually had a girlfriend who went through that :/

It all siege at least from what I know console siege is like 100x more toxic
---
Yeah but my point was that even with an okay team you should do okay so unless you're very bad you should be in silver, at least.
---
Fr man and she can't even fix a damn motorcycle
---
He knows what he said
---
thats the name of his elite gadget, other operators have something similar like ashes breach charges being called "Slither" or thermites being called "Texan Dynamite"
---
Jesus man wtf who even says that kind of shit
---
Nomad 100%.
---
She can either flank pretty hard using her gadget to make enemy vulnerable or cut off rotations once the planting begins. 
---
Gridlock can also achieve a similar result but she feels more defensive and her full potential comes out right before or after planting. 
---
When it comes to Anti-Roaming, Jackal and Dokk are just more reliable than Lion after his gadget nerfs. He requires more teamwork as well due to how much better he is with someone dronning out the enemies' positions and lock them there. 
---
Nokk is just very underwhelming at the moment. She is the only non-shield Defender who gets easily outgunned by Defenders who has the angle advantage (Anchors having range advantage as well). While she provides zero utility for her own team, Nokk herself is not a powerful operator either. BB offers no utility as well but he makes it up by being pretty strong on his own. Ubi's own data shows Nokk to be the second worst Attacker and with Glaz being buffed, she might hit the 1st spot.

Can confirm, I only recently learned that the window next to the bomb in trophy room in chalet cannot be rappelled into.  So I've been wasting one kapkan/frost trap in every game I've played in it.

I wonder if he would run for his mag if you threw it lol

I do, but I don't sh*t talk on others for using it. Skins are personal preference, after al.

A kill is generally 100 points, if they get injured and killed 100. If you shot that person at all you get 125 in total. Yes assists are broken
---
Behold.....the Chill Squad.
---
Because c4is very hard to make explode.
---
I’ve witnessed too many rounds where teammates refused to go through a window because of frost mats. Often opting to go the long way around.
---
fair.
---
I think bandit tirck used to be essential before maverick and even before than, people realized they can captiao/buck/sledge/IQ/nade/ash/thatcher/twitch/and zofia trick the thing and it became too risky to do most of the time. Not complaining but it seems very interesting how times change since ACOG mp7 with 3 barbed wires

I got TK'd on defense while setting up. For literally no reason.

Something like that. Hide in a room off site and rush through the same doorway once they plant. It's hilarious, but not usually effective. I just like giving people heart attacks.

You just interred DDosed territory then if your gold 1 . I have more respect for mnk players vs Ddosing ones . Gold 1 up is bad about ddosing some weeks are good but then you will abruptly be hit with them . Then they disappear only to come back again it sucks i know .

Not that bad until one moron does something dumb. It then becomes a battle royale.

Those Indians are so annoying maan. I just mute them if i hear any indian accent. They are so toxic at the game. and always talking some shit. I just barely solo queue only because of toxic indians. I wonder why they so toxic and ignorant in the internet. But in real life india is amazing they are so genuine people with a genuine smile. I dont know if toxicity or ignorance is their culture because they are superstitious people.
---
lol no

Why wouldn't he? Every bullet in a mag counts. How many times you get the kill with 1 round in the mag? It's not like he has to stop and repack them so why not?

---
I feel your pain, but it's just a case of classic toxicity. "You were the last one standing, so it's your fault we lost the round"  I recommend bringing a buddy to siege or finding one in game and sticking with them after a game since the vote kick needs to be unanimous to go through .
---
its your official reddit birthday, happy 2 years my friend
---
I almost never barricade doors. I’m a high gold player and find I rarely barricade doors. It severely limits what an anchor can do. For instance, if a door is barricaded and someone is in a hall for instance aviator on villa you can’t push out and kill them without alerting them. Barricading also simply makes it much harder for roamers to enter site/ retake. There are very rare instances where I barricade doors on the regular with an example being kitchen on Chalet with the double doors being barricaded between the dining room and the big fireplace room.
---
that’s usually what i use but i saw a bunch of pro league players use it so i decided to try it
---
I had a very similar situation as monty against pulse. I also menaged to kill him right after and he called me a cheater. That was a good day
---
Update. 50 percent.
---
Clearly the best way is to put three traps on the one they can vault through, on the other side of the room. That should always be the standard. Three traps under the most likely window people will come through.
---
Or they could just get rid of team damage. And no it wouldn't make it like cod. It would still be played the same.
---
They should use the outbreak recruit instead
---
I always used breach charges so I can't really relate. pretty much my thinking is breach charges &gt; any other gadget

I've been changing the voip voice for a while and I can't seem to get it right tbh, It's either too loud and doesn't let me hear the game or too low and can't hear them. It's only worse since every person has different volume on their mics

I love Siege. I’m just some jackass that can barely spray and pray my way into Gold IV but it’s the first game I’ve played that I felt like I was really apart of. Not that I actually do anything productive for the community but I can complain and give my hot take on every little change they make. It feels like it’s got real staying power too. It sucks that I used to have to invest so much time in COD or whatever to just have a new game released in a year forcing me to start from nothing again. Siege feels like a gaming home for me and I’ve just never really had that before.

doesnt even matter, watermarking memes that took 5 seconds to make in paint.net is the pettiest shit

Not necessarily, he was just being annoying the whole game and I’m new to pc so I want to know for further reference if it’s worth the effort to report for stuff like that.

I too think that despite this being a staged performance, it is still an entertaining piece

Don’t think he needs a rework but a buff would be nice. If his barricades couldn’t be broken without hard breach (thermite, maverick, hibana) it would make them better. Right now though sledge just makes castle useless
---
Lmao
---
It's true. My friend is a *hardcore* Fifa fan, and although he plays it a lot, he trash talks it like it's the worst game in the world
---
What the fuck am I even looking at? Please don’t shitpost here
---
The mouse and keyboard users are getting kinda crazy in plat 1 so I can only imagine what it’s like in diamond. Also if there’s any type of glitch out, if you don’t ban the operator ahead of time, there’s a good chance the enemies will glitch.
---
Hot dang!!! 😮😮
---
Given client side bodies and debris, did anyone comment on the bullets that on their ends may have disappeared into oblivion?
---
I have PTSD from the traps already, and I haven't even unlocked ranked.
---
Well that really doesn't involve much of any effort or much of any reality. But what I said about Ela, is 99% of what would happen.
---
There shouldn't be much of a setback when you start but I suggest doing the situations first when you start just so you get a feel of the game
---
Run mp5k all the time. Every map, every game
---
smaller maps in general are best for shotty like Oregon. mpk5 is a mid to short range type gun anyway so generally its better loadout to keep the shotty anyway and just master the smg11. my tip for it is flash hider and tap fire it. the rate of fire is fast enuff that tapping will act like a burst to make control easier.
---
Yo I love the new buff
---
Who cares in casual though
---
Wack
---
Most of them. In certain situations they're extremely useful, as it forces enemies to make lots of noise to pass through. Typically at the start of rounds, your teammates will be moving in and out of the objective while setting up. It's also a good idea to have a mix of roamers and anchors on your team. Anchors stay on or around site, while roamers are off holding key areas of the map, ready to flank defenders. You may be guarding the objective, but you have the whole building to work with, you shouldn't confine yourself to the objective room.
---
Remember what I said about barricades forcing players to make lots of noise? This applies to your teammates too. If a roamer needs to come back to site, a barricade can be very detrimental to their success, to an even greater extend than when an enemy needs to go through a barricade (since roamers going back to site are usually very time-limited, while attackers typically have a minute or so to make their moves).
---
Well then you are the worst IQ main I have ever encountered
---
I did the same thing. Bought a PC specifically for siege. 
---
The most important thing to do is DONT USE YOUR CONTROLLER. it’s gunna feel weird but you’ll get used to it.
---
Yeah I thought so but I wasn't sure about it. Now fuck I'm mad just watching the video again lol.. definitely not getting confident over a vaulting guy again.
---
maybe if we all slowly approach him, we can communicate
---
It's because you're not shooting the damned things!
---
I didn’t necessarily buy it for siege i got it because im getting tired of console games and its limitations
---
Shotguns aren’t as good on pc as they are on console. With mouse and keyboard you have more control and as you get better there won’t be a need to use a shotgun other than for smoke or mute. Make sure you have a lot of space for your mouse on your desk too. Unless you play with super high sensitivity you will want more space.
---
Reload your PC is the solution
---
Yeah, that’s what I did!
---
It's the reason why I stopped playing. I like the gameplay, but my chances of getting into a decent match are around 30%. Not worth taking.these chances. I rather play other games.
---
It also seems to me like Ubis RFF mechanic made trolls worse.
---
Now hear me out Fuze on Defense
---
Real shit? I should stay there!
---
Is there any way to figure out whose doing it?
---
I think u should
---
Wolfe?
---
Did you see this on the recent varsity gaming vid?
---
"Wine even try?..”
---
Use barbed wire to prevent rushes.
---
Hey it happens on pc as well it's just when it does it's normally like a copper 4 and 4 plats
---
Noone answered to you and it's an old post but this is how it works in all online games. Better ping = advantage, otherwise people would lag switch and the gameplay would be a total mess.
---
What happens is that since you have 45 ping, your "ghost" will stay standing up for 22,5ms+8ms (half of your pings)=32,5ms on the opponent's screen, and he has that window of opportunity to shoot you. If you have higher pings you will die behind cover for this very reason.
---
People keep server switching because they think higher ping gives them an advantage when it's not true. Peekers advantage does exist for various reasons but not because of the netcode, netcode wise peekers also have the disadvantage with higher pings since while they see the defender first, it takes more time for their shots to register as well. Which is exactly what's happening when you shoot a guy in the head and die after, it's because your shot was invalidated.
---
Did what
---
I got mine my third alpha pack, black ice mp5
---
*Hostage anxiety intensifies*
---
Is utility is absolute on every match but the reason i put him in A tier is because of his AR. I'm a thermite main on console and his AR isn't bad at all but when you look at hibana and zofia for example they have a better option in guns.
---
Sometimes a pair of letters will get swapped while writing a text due to fast typing.
---
I'm lvl 191 and my aim is still shit at time. Try one sense that feels good and stick to it. You have to get used to it.
---
When did they add this???
---
ikr
---
Not all smurfs derank to play lesser competition. I smurf because all the glitches and ddosing at my level in plat . I refuse to play on my main while the IQ clash glitch was running crazy in ranked. Plus ever plat high gold i know have smurfs to combat diamonds carrying a copper diamond and other stupid low ranks to get an advantage.  Not all smurfing is intentional boosting . Especially since my accounts are within one rank or two of each other .

---
1. A good doc player can turn the tides of a round. He has the option of healing, reviving a downed teammate from a distance, reviving himself, and overhealing. He has access to an acog on 2 of his weapons, and has barbed wire.
---
Rook on the other hand, may have access to the same weapons and impact nades, his plates only protect against a couple shots.
---
2. Her gadget is arguably the #1 counter to roamers, and the ARX, apart from the low mag capacity, is a very good weapon.
---
3. Kaid's slug shotgun (or whatever it's classified as) is a 2-3 shot weapon with access to an acog. also, his gadget has the ability to deny hatches from being breached and can also protect 2 reinforcements at once.
---
4. The other hard breachers (Thermite and Hibana) have more effective breaching tools, and unlike them, Maverick isn't a necessity to the team.
---
5. While her ability can be useful, other operators are more of a need than her.
---
Which map?
---
Honestly, to me, mouse users on console stand on the same low like people, who change there datacenter on PC in the configfiles to get a ping advantage. They both suck at the game and it is a shame, they get to opportunity to ruin the fun by using "unfair" means just for their own sake.
---
Eh Towers not that bad,it’s unique,pretty balanced and overall pretty fun although I’d still argue it shouldn’t be a part of ranked
---
They’re not skilled enough to compete against other K&amp;M players so they pick on the disadvantaged to feel good about themselves like Usain Bolt racing Steven Hawking
---

I’m actually nice enough to watch the killcam to see if it was accidental or not if not then well were about to have a war.
---
I understand, but he is so powerful that I had to rank him low.
---
Your probably giving yourself an advantage, but it isnt boosting. The amount of gold people playing with their bronze friends is probably so high, that your still gonna get even matchups.
---
Boosting generally is being a high plat playing with at least 2 copper accs (the copper accs being smurfs from diamond dudes). As long as your copper/silver friends arent smurfs, it isnt boosting.
---
Yall act like we carry around adult playdoh that'll randomly go off from a little 5.56.
---
They're assholes or they don't understand how much of a asshole they are.
---
What does legal size bullet mean
---
You use the key pad for gaming?
---
I like his name
---
At... Bronze?
---
Or insane amounts of force like blowing it up with something else.
---
tip - let your roamers reinforce easy shit on site and leave, dont have them get hatches. let the anchors get hatches so even if you get jackal'd near the hatch, it doesnt tell the atk much
---
not at all. a skilled doc player is much better for a team than a skilled rook player.
---
I was also trying to make a joke about how G2 doesn't reuse strat but apparently that wasn't obvious enough
---
Plat 3/2 is fine and very fun for the most part. Plat and 1 and up can get very toxic
---
The one that will have less ping after the first 10/15 sec.
---
Yeah i do agree as im diamond on xbox but only plat 2 on pc. :(
---
Vigil's bosg is the best shotgun.
---
Your are not human
---
That's still good and you definitely do deserve it if you can get it:)
---
As opposed to an eleventh North American operator?
---
We need some diversity.
---
Ahah thanks
---
Yup
---
How?
---
Pc or console?
---
Tried it this season but just got to Plat 1 and a nice losing streak maybe we will see us next season Up there :D follow is out ^^
---
Console , Xbox
---
I'm new to this but how do I follow you??
---
Ahah u got this!!
---
Jackal gets banned in every elo. Its mostly defenders that change. Low elo cav ( interrogation OP and you can’t hear her opop ??) high elo something like lesion or echo.
---
I only have method for PC since I play there, but look around on YouTube for a way to stuck your controller and repeatedly press A in a way, everything you'll discover, do it in solo thunt and not in casual.
---
My best friend is dead opponent =)
---
Ok, yeah, forgot about those, and Mira and maestro. But Mav, iq, and MANY others are misplaced.
---
I think the comments down there are a better explanation of the changes needed.
---
I made the experience that one of the best places are on the left side of a door if the obj is left, they aim straight to the side and slowly walk into the trap. Or place it behind a corner after a door/stairway
---
3. yes its not as strong as if you could control it full auto but its still stronger than cavs pistol
---
4. 
---
yes cavs pistol is one of the best pistols but an smg is still better than it
---
5.
---
what no on high lv in a comp environment 
---
every roamer without expeception will get droned 
---
and as a roamer you shouldnt be alive at the end unless they completely ignored you or you killed a few in either case u can still use the ability to flank without the dead people in drones seeing you
---
6.
---
ok i agree here 
---
but since there is always a drone watching it doesnt really matter and there is always someone watching unless you are all still alive wich is rare after hunting all roamers
---
with them not dying
---
7.
---
on high level people will go as groups and there is always someone close
---
its only very rare that ur completely alone while roam hunting even if ur teammate dies
---
the only time cav is really effective is if only 2 players are still alive and attacking from different sides from the obj
---
8.
---
lmao there are a lot more esl players than that not only pro teams are esl teams
---
and ranked for most good players isnt serious enough to play strats 
---
thats why so many high lv players are complaing about ranked because it is so different
---
and plat ranked players have a completely different meta than diamond esl players
---
ranked stats are NOT a good representation of the meta and balancing because most people dont take it that seriously especially good players 
---
they rather play fun ops than strong ops
---
Ah so dont feel obliged but if you want click on the text that says MiNiDaftHen0 above the post and there will be a follow button
---
Me and my friends say Jäger/Ash mains are toxic af, our point just got proven
---
yes - if ur a ps4 player that is
---
I've never kicked anybody.
---
What does the karma mean
---
Sas shotgun is amazing with sledge and mute
---
This right here dude. This pisses me off so much. All the time this happens. All four of my teammates will die instantly trying to peek the same window the one before them did. I try to convince them not too, "shut up noob". Okay. They're all dead 25 seconds into the round. Now it's 1v5 and I watched all them die peeking the same window. Well naturally I'm going to take my time: I'll drone, breach various entrances and flash corners and get 3 of them down. And boom! kicked out of the room for taking too long.
---
These are the same people who will kick you for not clutching.
---
Every situation that is not considering the kicked guy as a toxic team killer, If that's not the case, there is no reason to kick.
---
So basicaly if you psot and comment and people "like it" it adds up. So like the total amount of "likes" you have gotten
---
Call of Duty is one of the biggest IPs in the industry and that release will have a bigger player base on day one than siege ever did.
---
Ohh thanks
---
Do you also play on ps4?
---
Nah dude just xbox and pc sry
---
Do you have Instagram
---
Yeah @bnjmoore2
---
Hmu aha
---
Ok
---
twitch uses the F2 which has a curved mag and the trigger is closed off
---
I just call her cav
---
okay i guess that makes sense lol, it just seems to me that sony is more open to the idea of crossplay and whatnot because of fortnite and cod
---
It is
---
WoW How didnt i think of this 
---
This is beyond sience
---
Actually no, since Monty can literally be a unbreakable wall who could easily lock people out of obj, wall off a defuser, cover a person who could shoot next to him, not to mention that almost no one goes shield ops and chanka sits in the same place and takes a long time to relocate.
---
Imo ACOGs are fine and don't need change at the moment. Nothing feels overpowered and no op is constantly spawnpeeking in my games. So i don't see any reason to change that.
---
My favorite is in Chalet in the kitchen secure site. Place it in the bushes right next to the double doorway. Works so often it's sas
---
Cause thats what heroes do
---
Thx
---
I had this on around 7 servers where it actually ran on normal ping on each of them if I played them
---
I find twitch drones a little funnier. Like watching a little Buck.
---
I don't know names at all but whenever I happen to watch a recently made compilation video theres always one player who says something along the lines of "Outback is great, it should be in PL"
---
i didn’t try to lecture you that’s BS

Please do. :)

---
I actually feel bad to say this but.
---
I 5 stack high gold/low plat with 2 bronze and 1 copper.
---
I know im bad. But not as bad as when i intentionally lost every one of my placement matches so i beat down on copper 4 and write "gg 2 ez, t hunt please".
---
Hear me out now 
---
#Tachanka on defence with a mobile turret with no shield and less damage
---
I wish you could do it as a custom game alone. Like you could reinforments etc but sadly you can't.
---
I know that Ubisoft wants to make money but I want to share my opinion of some future rewards for people who grind the game
---
Jäger's ADS would be proud
---
Ubisoft wants money we all know that, I just want to suggest some rewards for players who grind R6
---
The only thing holding me back is the t hunt ones because I refuse to play it
---
Just imaging using the mp5 without an acog...
---
I’m addicted man. I was gold 2 when after I placed. I always solo q, even solo q’d half my placements. I’m now in between Bronze 1 &amp; Silver 4 &amp; can’t get back to gold off solo q’ing. But I keep solo q’n because it’s the only game I like to play &amp; I don’t play casual.
---
It is sad how bad teammates are down here. Straight flat leavers or terrible players in general. It’ll be a 4v5 on the first op selection screen. I’ll put up double digits constantly and get costed because I’m in a 3v5.
---
After 1 year I managed to hit Plat 3. Give me 1 more year!
---
I was going to take back my Grzmot :)
---
Ahah ill get back to you next year
---
2 boring recycled weak ops, no new map, less modes in ranked, ddos, fake copper boosting everywhere, kbm macros on console, 3 attack then defend is not good on these unbalanced maps, pick/ban already old, nothing fun to do other than play stale ranked. Review: 2/10
---
Yep
---
Nope, they only need to get till 22 something level and they get Prime. I forgot since I completely left the game.
---
Nobody lmao 😂
---
How do any of you even manage to get an icon let alone a rainbow six character

Noobs really love their black ice and elephant skins.

the hero we need but do not deserve

1. I wouldn’t really consider these my “mains”, just my favorites. I try not to restrict myself to just one or a couple of operators, I want to play the ones I feel like playing/the one that’s needed.
---
2. Ok that’s true, but to be fair, I “only” have Black Ice for the 417 and Ashes ACOG rifle (forgot what it’s called lul).

I feel you Brother

Omg this is so funny

---
Bro Oreo boxes are best!
---
Same problem happens when I play with my gf
---
They can obviously see shes not the best at the game and thats shes a low level but voting to kick and team killing just ruins everything and theres no point in playing
---
Local lan center by me has that. You can play on your own account but they’re computers are granted all characters unlocked for when they host tournaments and such. You do not get to keep all of them

Have my upvote OP especially for the title you sick cunt
---
If course because you main Doc, figures you’d love Skyscraper
---
What is this title?
---
Edit: makes sense to me now
---
Honestly with the nerf to revives it almost doesn't matter now.
---
What are you gonna do huh? Maybe shit and piss? Maybe fart and cum all over the place?
---
Skyscraper is the japanese map correct? If it is them i dont actually because people run out to much and dont make it fun
---
🤤🤤
---
Why wouldn't it be fun anymore?
---
Too much grinding and frustration and of course, the AIDS get even worse
---
One of the few ops that can force a defender out of a position without directly exposing himself. Combine that with faster blooming smokes and 3 speed + a claymore and you have a Swiss army knife of an operator.
---
Yessir

The weight of his hostage killing sins finally caught up to him

congratzz man
---
Thx man
---
Money, and or grinding with a sprinkle of luck
---
I play Tachanka regularly and he's better than everyone thinks he is. Just gotta know where to place the turret.
---
I hit him with an impact grenade, looks like a shot to the leg and definitely at least 3 bullets to the lower body, yet he kills me with half health... don't think a head shot would have helped in this instance.
---
Usually if I try the alt - tab in full screen it has a glitch fest with the monitor
---
1/2. either happens or not
---
The only good things I got were an smg-11 dragon and Golden vector (they dun goofed up voice line that I spam after every encounter but I didn’t want to mention that).
---
&gt;insult to injury
---
Guaranteed no one on the enemy team gave 2 flying magical pig fucks that you were reviving a teammate

---
He couldn't die in Frost's traps...
---
Amen to this
---
That's technically a 4k but it's good anyway
---
I like Nokk. It's the perfect op if you just want play on your own.
---
You don't have a gadget that somebody might need, you can't really hold angles well. It's something different.
---
I really would bury them both already. For some ops it just takes time to get good.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When R6 was released everyone said IQ was hot garbage. And look at her now.
---
Thanks for your opinion. I am currently at 13k renown... when i reach 15k i will tell which one i bought
---
I didnt even know that was possible...
---
lesion is better but he get bans sometime... alibi has one of the fastest guns in the game and her gadget is really good for creative people..
---
Why do you play Xbox when u have a pc? Just curious.
---
I have that sometime in the killcams but never when I play Cav myself. What platform?
---
there is cancer in the title
---
oh yea should’ve mentioned. PC.
---
its gamestop it has to be legit
---
the enemy team is actually good/ somewhat coordinated, you might face 5stacks, boosters, plat 1 players that decided to mess around in p3 which kind of makes for a really stressful environment
---
Yeah the AK-12 has the same issue
---
Fitting to how half the siege player base is
---
Common problem, it's happening to Fuze's AK as well
---
You don't have to\^\^
---
Just use .357 caliber pasta. I think penne should fit fairly well.
---
Definitely under picked because of their loadout.
---
A headshot would've helped here being headshots insta kill. Impact nades do 67 damage to 3 speed ops (fuze is a 1 speed op). The UMP45 does 38 damage on 3 speed ops (yet again, fuze is a 1 speed op). Assuming you were the only person to do damage to fuze and assuming the impact grenade you through actually damaged fuze you still didn't do enough damage to kill him. Accept defeat and stop complaining.
---
What lmao
---
Nah it’s not the recoil I’ve just personally thought the acog is by far superior but I’ve seen a lot of people with holo recently
---
Agreed
---
to make warden better he just needs an acog or to be 2 speed
---
Interesting
---
I’m very concerned about Team Chat...
---
Holy shit a decent tier list on this sub
---
Is it?
---
Its not that easy acog for maps with longer hallways like border and holo or reflex for smaler more narow maps like clubhouse
---
Did you noticed people were you thought that guy is using a mouse and keyboard? Or are you using it by yourself maybe?
---
[u/PR0PH3Tcs](https://www.reddit.com/u/PR0PH3Tcs/)

Wait what? Im a bit confused. If ur asking if im MnK. No
---
The product is legit, is it the same for the price?
---
They're just spice squares, it still works
---
close and reopen game, they should be added.
---
Restart  the game
---
First of all they can just remove friendly fire for guns, and nothing else, and 2nd of all, people say everything is op before its actually in the game, and they relaise its actually not. Every time someone has a concept, everyone screams op, even though there are more 'op' things in the game like blitz.
---
Sad day
---
Yes, they are not which is why they warranted a special mention.
---
I would choose more tactical ops and get used to them like have a hard breacher and iq or a thatcher so you can control the round on attack. Also on defense just come up with a good plan and stick to it so 2 can roam 2 can anchor and the other one can kind of peek around the obj and watch cams
---
Drones stronger together
---
You forgot to include a Pencil.
---
 didn't know that they could actually touch just thought they go through each other
---
Explain?
---
Why do I feel like I’m this person
---
I can get plat 3 every season for over a year now and I can’t climb higher. I think I have hit my peak. Makes me sad I just want diamond once. I was even placed plat 3 this season but can’t climb. Jumping from gold 1 to plat 3 in an endless cycle.
---
damn idk dude
---
fuck off, please
---
Already answered that, and ALOT easier said than done, ur acting like they cant kill u or smthing lol, or even do the same, that would be a very stupid move lol
---
Take the operators you need.
---
Create a strategy with said operators and actually stick to it. If your strategy gets countered then it's up to your team to decide what needs to change. This is a good test to your game knowledge. 
---
Call out straight away, don't complain for 5 minutes about how you died. 
---
Don't all go off by yourselves and rely on your individual skill, work together. Drone for your entry fragger. 
---
Smokes are an attackers friend. 
---
Defence is pretty similar, only don't have 3+ people doing individual roams. It's actually stupid. Have 1 hardcore roamer who can go where they like, 1 roamer who can still support the site (like a pulse underneath) and the rest actually defend the bombs. 
---
This should help you guys to get a basic structure sorted out, the rest will be decided once you've played around 40-50 games and finding out what rank you end up at.
---
As a Sledge main.... shut the fuck up.
---
https://youtu.be/_f_LK0-Hzdc
---
comment then
---
do your friends joke around alot?... playing with people who don't take the game serious will result in Ls... and give detailed callout to set your teammate up for an easy kill
---
Thanks for the tips, I especially like the defence strategy you laid out here. I’ll tell the boys tonight and we can implement it.
---
 
---
For attack we usually run thermite, Monty, buck, hibana and one friend who shakes it up every round. Is that a decent looking team?
---
depends how you use them
---
your talent in drawing is godly so
---
can i use my programming socks as gaming socks too?
---
that's funny
---
Since when do drones have collision enabled for each other what
---
If it's the only one you've gotten it could've been the whole round timer and it would still be you fastest cos theres nothing to be slower than it
---
Yeah, I'm not saying $40 is expensive, I'm trying to say that you can get them for even less than that.
---
A fucking pencil
---
i killed a hostage once because of this
---
He has a nice mustache
---
WHY IS EVERYONE HERE A FUCKING WEEB?
---
"A fuckin penciel!"
---
true
---
I'm acting like that would massively reduce the skill ceiling of the game.
---
&gt;ur acting like they cant kill u or smthing lol
---
When did I say anything even remotely like that? Don't lie...
---
lol
---
umm twitch is good? lol
---
twitch, in my opinion, is the worst attack op in the game. her gadget becomes useless 30 seconds into the round, (hint, her drone cant jump making it very easy to destroy) other than her garbage gadget she has f2 which i will admit is a solid ar but other ar’s fill the role like maverick’s m4 or jackal’s c7e. so whats the point of her if you play her only for the ar thats slightly better than most things
---
supposedly its not the actual c4 that is the issue. The bullet hitting the detonator or something else on the bomb and that might cause an explosion.
---
1 year repost :/
---
 JoJo isnt an anime, its a lifestyle
---
Depends. Are you playing hacknet?
---
it requires a detonator and that detonator can be set off with bullets.
---
Thanks!
---
That's what happens when I dont Jack off for a couple hours.
---
Fighting a war
---
Also, who cares about Ash's elite. Almost everyone got it, so it doesn't really feel elite.
---
well I don’t agree with some of the points ...
---
(attention! BAD ENGLISH INCOMING) 
---
well I don’t really have a problem with the soundsystem ... it ain’t bad in my opinion BUT 
---
Theres this one bug when I tab out of the game there is a small chance that all sounds... „reverse“ if somebody start shooting from the left side ... I’ll hear it from the right etc. 
---
But yeah... it’s annoying but it will be patched hopefully 
---
the shooting Range idea sounds pretty cool and I would like to have that ... but still I think thunt is pretty good ... if u want to practice the recoil ... just shoot signs or a wall  o_o I don’t really see the big difference between thunt and a shooting range there 
---
„If u win against a hacker in ranked u shouldn’t loose the points“
---
Hackers don’t always want to win and u can’t just come up with the „yeah if I win I win and if I lose I don’t lose“ logic. just leave that round u will get those points back when u leave so... no reason to waste time... and yeah sure it’s annoying but well they can’t do much 
---
Oh Yeah and the Studio Mode... Sounds neat 
---
But most of the pro players already said they don’t want that in bc there just showing everybody their spots etc.... so I don’t really think it’s a good idea
---
Trust me, its lit bro
---
there’s no escape
---
You gotta do what you gotta do man
---
Never said u SAID that... 
---
but if u rush in like that, literally one c4 and ur all dead......... so stupid idea
---
u don't need to equip camo... animation comes with uniform

Most diamonds are scared to queue without a full stack, therefore no spaces for you. Also there's probably less diamonds due to Ubi chasing away secure players.
---
I'm getting random MMR removals at the worst possible moments....just when I get to gold they remove 80-60 MMR saying I played with a cheater but I never got MMR back for playing against a cheater!? Ubi literally gave me 2 MMR for playing against a cheater and I haven't even played ranked that much to get only 2 MMR!! WTF!
---
We were talking about these drone lights the other day and wondered if the new colours affect people that are colour blind?
---
Ikr her gun has almost the same stats as the f2 it's Soo good specially with her ability to safely scout out a situation before going in.
---
You have to do something
---
I’m guessing they were defending first, because of the castle thing he said, but that would make sense
---
Woops.

whatever you do... don't try to think too hard about what you're doing differently
---
I’d like to turn you in for using like 20,000 dpi
---
Should attack the kb&amp;m problem first
---
It's not a bug. It's you being too close to the angle and therefore having your sightlines blocked.
---
Never tought I would say that but he's probably better of using iron sights
---
Thing about this game is everyone thinks they know best. So when you talk back they just kill you.
---
Probably helps them. I sometimes used color blind option in some games, because i liked it, and it usually turned the classic red-blue to yellow-light blue
---
But still, the sides dont matter for colorblinds
---
Yeah, I’d rather have the classic skin on an AK like that though

oh ok we can play i guess @YOLO x NINJA
---
Wow thank you very much, out of those 2 and also gridlock who do you think I should fet
---
I don't think 3 people are always holding three angles the  whole round
---
Maybe they should take away Hereford from the map pool for a while till it gets another balancing update.
---
I still think that this loadout on some particular guns in a lot of cases is actually decent, you can have your own opinion. I don't mind that.
---
definitely insane
---
The floor is *jamming* him xD
---
Ok dawg
---
U doing meth?
---
They should just take a giant bomb to Hereford and delete it from existence
---
We need answers not sleep.
---

---
how many hours do you have... im at like 600hrs
---
Says the Hibana main
---
Shhhhh “seige cosplay”
---
Lol. At least keep it for thunts hahaha.
---
What did you say?
---
WHAT DID YOU BASE YOUR GUESS ON
---
You're a needy bastard aren't you?
---
She easily could have killed OP because all you really need is a moment of hesitation and then you kill them
---
o h m y g o d
---
Never tell me the odds
---
I wasn’t sure sorry
---
It's all good
---
If you drone the stair case out chances are there’s gonna be people looking at it
---
Group c looks brutal. Can't wait!
---
lion i’ve been playing him in low gold high silver recently and he’s still just as good as he was. might change when i get higher ranked
---
This is why we all need bipods on our knives.
---
Gold Experience Requiem got Nokk.
---
Was that an unironic red dot suppressor?
---
Feck offfff
---
Hey I’m gonna ask why?
---
Maestro 👌👌👌
---
I've gotta ask they are my mains
---
Repost and stolen
---
I got perma banned for toxicity with no proof
---
Uhm, you can add attachments to your gun if you click on it in the operator loadout menu if you didn’t know.
---
Buck is pretty good for both low rank and high rank with his CAMRS and C8
---
Why 200+ up votes on some clearly fake stuff...crazy
---
Bro ya know borderless is a setting right?
---
Probably idk
---
Great discussion so informative
---
Top 3 win rates for defenders. I guess she’s skill based since the pistol makes it easy and the fo-12 is a laser
---
who are you, marley?
---
?????
---
A TTS will not come to console because it has to go through Sony/Microsoft. So it will make it harder for them to release fast updates unlike on PC.
---
Consoles ruin gaming
---
Yeah, ikr
---
If you can’t get headshots with that fire rate that’s not my fault.
---
Quite possibly so
---
I would have paid $5 in a heartbeat if it guaranteed me the Smoke headgear. But it was the ONLY one in that whole set that I really cared to collect, and I didn’t want to go down that hole of maybe spending $60 on stuff I didn’t want before getting it. Obviously that’s the point, but I still wish Ubi would let us buy what we want. The anti loot box movement may eventually force them to do that, anyways (I doubt that it’s legal under Canadian anti-gambling laws as it is, but the gov’t has looked the other way for too long to make an issue out of it now). 
---
It was a combo of not especially liking the other items, and them being for characters I just don’t play. I did sink some real money into the Old West premium packs, because I thought the quality was a bit more even.
---
Lucky you, I always get shitty commons for Fuze’s/Finka’s LMG &gt;_&lt;
---
It's still pretty good, just do whatever you want
---
.
---
My god, you wrote an essay for something that can be settled in a few sentences.
---
Jk, I’m just mad cuz bad
---
I think Maestro is fine where he is. Especially after the Thatcher buff against him.
---
They should change Warden to be be like Glaz. Able to move and see
---
Raping
---
I don't think so, but that is still a possibility.
---
He can’t be, he had a full mag in.
---
Then they would probably be responsible for countless war crimes and destabilizing third works countries for their higher ups. Best keep them to fiction where the soldiers are always the good guys.
---
Scorpion isn’t op, the fo-12 is what I hate
---
Get an acog bro its so much better
---
I’ll add you when I get home but can’t play for a couple of days got some back problems and cants sit for awhile :)
---
"Holy shit, you fucking killed them dude!"
---
"Walked right into that Frost mat, same as us and that terrorist over there"
---
"Damn you attackers, siege was fine until you came along, Siege was nice and lazy, if Doc wasn't spawn peeking, I could have boarded that helicopter and been half way to Fortress by now"
---
They must have lost the notebook...
---
So are the spice girls racist now?
---
Welcome to casual friend, it's pretty crappy
---
Eh Why you gotta hurt my boy Tachanka like this
---
I wish i was that good
---
no ik fo12 is amazing but the scorpion is the fastest gun in the games... i would rather have the fastest AR than the strongest AR
---
I do recall seeing it theorized when the op was new, though have seen very few examples (if any, before this one) of it working in the wild. The potential for Maverick to blow himself up might be part of it.
---
Sir this is console that's illegal
---
Magnet operator that attracts flashes nades and maybe drones?
---
Why cover the scores
---
Wait. So there is a weapon skin and charm?
---
That’s just the clash style
---
So just Ela with an S10?
---
Why does it matter if it was in a custom game, it’s not like his friend was running extra slow for him to hit that shot.
---
That was a pretty funny title ngl
---
Username checks out
---
Meh I just melted a buck from 20 meters with the fo12 so I’ll stick with it
---
And usually followed up with a vote kick
---
Red cameras don't even look natural to me anymore, I can't belive we ever had them
---
Actually yes
---
👁👅👁
---
Maybe it was because of them headphones
---
Not as far as I know. Did you buy a season pass towards the end of the season and get the 10% off in the store?
---
Most evil eyes don't even see the end of the round,he has many counters and even his monster of a gun has been nerfed, He's in a good spot.
---
It’s instantly noticeable for me. I seriously can’t control my recoil without feeling the vibration. I know it might sound weird, but it’s true. I have serious potato aim.
---
If I called you any names, or anything harmful I'm sorry. That doesn't benefit an argument in any sense. They're only driving points of self pride. But yet again you used it as well.
---
I get it if you’re new, but those mute placements made my eye twitch. Lol.
---
r/waterhomies ?
---
Yeah there's (also/was) an area,maybe that wall, where you can just spray at each other head 2 head and you won't die because of the wall.
---
I can only haw cause I can yee with no hat :(
---
Should've censor enemies name too
---
I dont think that's wine in her glass, it's probably the blood from every victim of her frost mats
---
I used to play like that but I just adapted to not using the vibration.
---
It's literally one frame on the door frame you gotta look very closely
---
Man really thought I was talking about this year lmao
---
its like toy story when and butt plugs tried to run away
---
Everyone should get an elite tbh.
---
One of the best smgs
---
What about chat exploit abuse they started hand out bans like candy for doing that shit
---
Monty mains are not phased. Just bop them again
---
What the shit. Where are you? i need to pick up a copy of rainbowSEX
---
Yeah, they did. But it was a very small buff.
---
Nah you just clearly missed
---
f
---
You mean you just suck?
---
That is true but if some in siege you be technically holding a special forces member from a select country as a meat shield and probably forcing his teammate to kill them. Which sounds perfect for gears of war but kinda off for siege. Regardless of disagreement I appreciate your unique idea.
---
MOMMYYYYYY, HE’S HACKING!!!!!!!
---
Thank god I got both the suit and head for smoke, and I didn't even pay a single cent
---
Still doesn’t beat the Lord Tachanka Bundle.
---
Nope. But I swear they were on sale and not 27500 like they are now. But maybe I'm tripping
---
Bamboozled.
---
"Progress with the rest of the player base"
---
Citation needed. The tryhards stayed. The people on my level and below left because of the influx of tryhards. This game will be dead in about a year if Ubisoft continues to solely care about Pro League garbage and not fixing their game.
---
Idk it doesn’t let me purchase it because it says I own it already
---
Looks shite, hes British, not a asian rioter/protestor, thought hed look more badass like a ww1 soldier, know we have the lawn dart but its not much
---
Oh so the buff to his gadgets range didn't happen at the same time he was "nerfed"? Oh okay I guess those patch notes didn't exist.
---
major ubi burn. THX ubi.
---
Shut up stupid
---
This *may* work, we need to see him in action to tell.
---
Rngesus just wants to see the world burn.
---
Can you equip it?
---
Even though black beard is nerfed to shit, he is still good. Those split seconds of his shield getting shot and broken is enough time for him to win the gun fight.
---
This may work, we need to see him in action to tell.
---
Prove it.
---
No it doesn’t allow me to equip it. If I hit the equip to all it just un-equips all my gear I have on him
---
You're not the only one. Ubisoft did a thing, and its bugged. No surprise.
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Better late then never.
---
Okay I was just making sure I wasn’t the only one too
---
Jesus Christ ahha.  Atleast save to phone then upload...
---
No because last year they were selling the year 2 pass like normal and when year 4 started people kept on waiting for the year 3 pass but that never came out so you just buy the larger credits pack and buy your favourite ops if you’re not going to grind.
---
Low effort
---
Same way for me but I got tachanka’s uniform and not his helmet
---
On PC the gun has massive recoil and really isn't very good at all.
---
Something similar has been occurring for the seasonal skins ever since Wind Bastion. It says I own it, ergo I can’t buy em. Then when I try to put em on, it says I have to buy them.
---
Yeah ubisoft really needs to improve their anti-cheat. We got many bans that came with the DDOS'ing and people abusing chat to lag game servers but nothing has been addressed about cheating problems. I don't think ELO drawback is enough, stuff like this shouldn't even happen to begin with.
---
I'm not logged into a account on the Ubi store and it only shows Year 4. It's a season pass for the year, which is why you can't buy it after it's over.. You can probably see 2 because you own it.. It's like any timed DLC you could see it if you own it.
---
Just report him to Ubisoft support, otherwise no witch hunting on this sub.
---
i didnt say glitches goof ball, clash glitch is why people left, error codes is why people left,IQ GLITCH IS WHY,hitbot registration,boosters,high smurfs playing in low ranks,clash glitch, clash glitch, CLASH GLITCH,
---
If you play on pc crouch spam is normal to see at least 100 times a game... you just got to adjust and not complain like a pus...
---
plus dropshot put you at a disadvantage lowkey cause its hipfire at first
---
Well if i had season 2 I would own all the ops in season 2 which i don't.
---
Dude that sucks. The seasonal skins are great this season
---
How dare I comment on what will be the death of this game lol
---
A very intelligent individual you are. This statement adds ##SO## much to this discussion.
---
Well yeah... by the sound of it every game you play is filled to the brim, it sounds like you almost couldn’t keep up lol
---
Only range buff I’ve heard of was a while ago, and I watched a couple YT vids going over the patch notes in detail and never heard it mentioned
---
Ubishills downvoting as usual.
---
This community is plagued with astroturfing
---
Replace Jackal with Fuze and you got a REAL pro league ban phase
---
 glitches and ddosers 80% of the reason people leave, diamond smurfs playing in gold 10%, and error codes are 10% in MY OPINION
---
Restart your game maybe and don’t click on the slider and go straight to the store? I don’t spend a lot on R6, so idk how to solve this problem.
---
It’s part of the rules bud, I didn’t make them. Like I said just report him and he done with it. Ubi has already stated they are working on this issue and it’s top priority.
---
Hmmm, maybe contact goobisoft for a refund /fix
---
Is this real?
---
I've got both, but that one just says "penis" to me. So I use the unicorn helmet instead.
---
I think the fact that tachankas turret could shoot shields would be cool and all but it takes a decent amount of time to set up the turret and by then the shield or one of his teammates could get the jump on you.
---
LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED
---
Okey fine take the upvote. :(
---
More of a reminiscence than a demand 😂
---
in the end it's a team game.
---
Same I own a nigg
---
I had a very lucky shot too, where I shoot the camera and expediently headshots a spawn peeker
---
As a maestro main, my two showdown packs got me his yeehaw armor but not his yeehaw hat and I didnt want to support their shitty business tactics. So I will forever have my yeehaw armor without the yeehaw hat to go with it.
---
It does
---
&gt; By controlling recoil  
---
Shotguns have spread. If you're past a certain distance, you're pellets are too spread out to be useful at that engagement. An actual laser like the MPX can put a tight grouping of bullets at 25 meters.
---
&gt;  low time 
---
Manage time better. If you're pushing site with 15-30 seconds left, Ela mines are the least of your problems or one of the most unlikely things to actually cost you the round or the entire match if you're team isn't managing time.
---
&gt; it’s either thrown on you 
---
You must be getting C4'd a fuck tone if your reaction time is so slow to shooting an Ela mine that has to arm itself after landing on a surface is such an issue for you.
---
&gt; when you have to go through a door in situations like getting pinched 
---
All your examples are "I made a bad gameplay decision but I swear its not my fault".
---
Nice
---
Yea lesions was un needed
---
And you have mine
---
That’s definitely not okay
---
It is I, Dr. Mobius, transmitting from my dome-shaped... dome in the Forbidden Zone. A zone... that is, yes... forbidden to you
---
Thanks, I’m pretty new to Reddit
---
Aim higher
---
Not the best gun in the game but I do think it's underated. Problem is that many people feel uncomfortable using DMRs. Especially on console, stuff DMRs on console
---
Fair. I still wish for 99 damage Luison but that’s dead and gone too.
---
Boi
---
3k skyskraper for tha win
---
My main concern with a fast setup time is that it would give the gun too much utility especially with the proposed penetration buffs. In this instance you’d still have to think strategically and place your turret in a spot with decent lines of sight.
---
Aim at a 45 degree angle and be moving forward.
---
Sadly Ela’s shotgun is overpowered
---
True Rip 😭
---
Use the turret less, his guns are absolutely deadly. Only use the turret in the last minute of the round or if you need it. If not don't just sit there on it
---
Dokkibae
---
...I got a butterfly charm...
---
OWB's gameplay might've been an enemy spam, but the dialogue more than made up for that.
---
Because fuck boosters that’s why
---
I am aware
---
Defiantly, and I’m not saying that it isn’t a good elite skin but I feel other operators should’ve received an elite skin before him
---
Good Work
---
shes pretty in line with the other 3 armor attackers. Fuze is W I D E as shit and monty is monty.
---
I love the 9x19 VSN, absolutely a lethal weapon. But his ability needs a buff.
---
Yea ok what u mean
---
Lucky for sure
---
Yoo whot maaytt?
---
LOL, this is the game where you get TK’d for putting up reinforcements in the wrong spot yet everyone here in the comments is screeching...
---
&gt; unless that change will only apply to console. 
---
If it were to only apply to console, which is the case with recoil then I'd be fine which is why I proposed that or like when Kaid shotgun had too much recoil for console players to use effectively. However, I'm not sure how often Ubisoft looks at these case by case basis or if they do something like buffing Buck across all platforms because his recoil is too much for the majority of console players while PC players are fine with him.
---
Im more interested in clashes face than this meme
---
Damn. You’re lucky. 
---
Enjoy it. 
---
I haven’t given it another shot because I can’t transfer my purchases and unlocks.
---
lmao in my case I got the uniform but not the headgear
---
yo this is fire
---
I got the lower half...
---
You mean when he edits the video
---
Honestly me
---
Does aiming with a shotgun effect anything other than recoil?
---
Hello Squid_Gaming, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cjzz4u/fission_mailed_bois/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Well,  Monty does have a full body shield and Fuze is XTRA THICC.
---
Yea but this guy probably mains ash

What was that clicking noise at the end, (Not accusing you of mouse and key just sounds like it to me). I’m probably tripping though.
---
Maverick can still fuck your shit up if he wants to take some damage
---
Perhaps
---
Neyt, rifle is fine
---
It depends
---
I’ve done this a few times but no one is ever allowed to get up cause we don’t have the room to
---
Yeah I would like them to change some console only stuff, but I like how hard it is to play on console since controllers are aids
---
He probably isn’t though u just want to complain

Not true was copper 4 in grim sky when i first started the game and i got to silver 1 at the end of the season.
---
I used to like this game but if this is how it is at diamond I might as well uninstall. Way too twitchy for me.
---
I believe that the devs of rainbow should make elite skins for operators based off of seniority instead of just whoever is a popular operator at the time, and lesions elite skin is nice but agreeing with what you said it was unnecessary
---
For example operators like buck and I hate to say it but blitz, at least I feel, deserve an elite skin over an operator like lesion because they are an older op

My bad, the font is small so I misread it.

Try out the different attachments first, that's what I do, for some reason I really like the muzzle break on IQ's commando and ying's lmg, but the f2 is great with a flash hider , those are just a few examples but I try our all of the attachments first then use whatever feels good
