So where is our Polish map?
---

---
I feel like they've fucked us a few times now, some of the elite sets being trash was bad enough (hello Doc and IQ) but losing out on maps is a bit shitty. We aren't even getting new fucking guns!
---
---
---
Cartii
---
the old was fun the new is a dumpster fire.
---
Yeah IceyCat mentioned the bolt action. Must be in the patch notes.
---
New Seasons are always revealed at the PL finals or the Majors
---
Outback
---
No. Not really.
---
Most accurate part is the Ash at 15 health lmao
---
TOWER IS THE GREATEST MAP, defense can actually play outside
---
Well yeah apart from that.
---
All. For the memes.
---
Its because "win delta" is actually a pretty meaningless stat. Thats why Finka (and other operators) fluctuate pretty wildly despite having no changes. Its gets even worse when dealing with lower picked operators.
---
All they do is take the win % of all games with a specific operator (in this case Finka) and compare it to the win % of all games without that specific operator. And then it attributes the entire difference in win % to that specific operator. Which is pretty ridiculous if you understand that game at all (or even just stats). There is no possible way you can say "X operator adds adds a 2% chance of winning over Y operator" based off nothing but win %. Its just silly.
---
I guess you could call them *sea slugs*

You way think tachy is bad but you always think that till all five people rush at you while your on you turret

Try getting 15-19 kills every placement game but 1 and winning 8 out of 10 of your placement matches and getting put into Gold2. Big think.
---
This community should have fought the fight over this no new guns thing several months ago. Now new guns will be a "treat" if we get more eventually.

Operation Para Bellum had a Map Buff (club house) and a new map (Villa)

You start the season (before you play any placements) with a hidden MMR that is midway between where you ended the previous season and 2500.  My rule of thumb is that each placement match is worth \~100 points, so if you start at 2600 and go 7-3 in your placements, you would be coming out of placements around 3000MMR.  If you went 3-7 instead, you would come out of placements around 2200MMR.
---
Faced an Ela hacker today too. She had no attachments but a suppressor literally laser beaming people with no recoil
---
Anyone else getting titan vibes from d2?
---
Alright thanks man That explained it well
---
But they can't give the same weapon different attachments depending on who uses it. Probably because of engine restrictions.
---
That's because it is.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The only factors in how much MMR you gain/lose are the result (W/L), how likely that result was given the two teams' MMR and your uncertainty value (which starts high and goes down as you play more matches within a season).
---
How do you plan to play?  I recently switched from AR-33 to L85A2.  I realized that with Thatcher I'm holding a lot of longer angles so I'm better off with the L85's phenomenal recoil.  It's tough though, both guns are viable and similarly strong and the AR-33 is very enjoyable to shoot.  I know it's squishy, but the sound and recoil seem "right", more so maybe than with any other gun in the game.
---
Oh dang your right sorry for click bait whoops its more like a 180-ish or a 90
---
Right, good point. I keep forgetting they dropped 3 one season. My mind jumps to Finka and Lion when I think of weird seasons. Thanks
---
No
---
Found the leak and as i thought the defender is like i thought however the attscker is gonna be like an emp charge rifle that disables gadgets
---
It’s called a scenario, don’t take it so seriously mate. I play on a plat level 2 and my team *does* have brains. This is a general QOL improvement
---
Like I said for people without mics or causal players.
---
I feel like they always try to push out a new Jaeger alternative
---
Then find some people on discord. Make new friends.
---
This is the power of requiem
---
Oh
---
Basically, if you TK someone may it be accident or not, if the person who you killed deactivates your RFF they basically „reset“ your teamkill? So basically after you‘ve been forgiven you are able to hurt allies again without being hurt yourself, that means you can kill a teammate again, and because your TK was forgiven you won‘t be banned for killing someone again, so if they dmg you, TK each other and forgive the TK each other, they can damage you as much as they want.
---
If that makes any sense for you, here‘s your answer
---
[removed]
---
So navy seals operators were getting basically
---
Hatches.
---
Yeah true but I just threw in how the spider "hacks" the drone lol
---
Its not, tha packs are still obtainable
---
New operator confirmed
---
That actually has legs
---
r/brokethechain
---
Operation: Health 2 when?
---
An oil rig map would be so fucking cool now that you mention it
---
No matter what they do to that map, it'll always be trash
---
I only have three words for you FUCK YOUR “FRIENDS”
---
I mean why would they switch if there’s a flashing icon? If they wanted to switch they would have done it already.
---
The message is still 2 weeks old.
---
Yeah your aim is bad but their IQ is terrible
---
Bro have you got one brain cell or something, it’s a suggestion don’t take these things so seriously.  Some people don’t sweat the game and play who they enjoy and don’t make tactical decisions
---
Sounds like a high pitched demon laugh
---
What do you mean 'for once'? 3 different ops use it.
---
Read the text in the picture tho....
---
I feel like it would take too long. By the time you pulled up the device to revive a teammate they’d be long dead
---
Take no prisoners conrades
---
Oh... oh dear oh no.
---
Was thinking something similar as far as a fishermen's net or something. You can see it on the water with something red as well. It'll be interesting.
---
i first read
---
Secondary Gadget:Fangs
---
ya 0 hype from me, no new guns, all new maps same generic maze structure 
---
call me when something interesting is revealed. lets hope its not another recycled gadget, or some gimmicky crap theyll take a month to beta test and still release broken
---
It does break the self promotion rule.
---
I mean asides from her coming out later. It's because Ela is the worst defender in game and Zofia is actually viable.
---
Well I am not a fan of batteries so I’ll just grab some caustic soda and I’ll be all set
---
repost
---
The entire point he was nerfed was because he was so good at pushing obj rather than sniping, but with the rework the op made, he could still be good in close range, AND a proper sniper
---
Damn
---
Sometimes the time would glitch and be infinite. I know once the enemy team had a good 20 seconds before the initial countdown
---
Yeah but now you are pushing him further away from effective engagement distance. How does that make him better?
---
Sorry for the text block
---
Here's the problem with her, you have to either take the mini shotgun or the supernova. Supernova is pretty crappy of a shotgun. Mini shot gun makes you lose on the smg11. If you take the smg11, you can't take the LMG because you can't open up hatches and get even less utility but you lose out on range, also that LMG makes her feel sluggish so they should have given her an AR.
---
Sledge is great because he will always have soft breach, imo he is the most balanced operator in the game. If Amaru had a proper assault rifle for handling or have nades or her gadget has more uses because whenever I played her, I only used her gadget max 2 times, she would become viable. Rn she is more worse than Tachanka.  SMG11 is great don't get me wrong but there is a reason why it is hard to use at range because it is really easy to fuck up long range shots with it.
---
you realise a billion dollar company wont ask its fans to harass the social media manager of another company, right? also you cant distinguish 100% of the time between an MnK and controller player, i get youre frustrated but spamming reddit and looking past the reality of the situation wont do anything.
---
'ELA Main' 'Worst Defender'...... uhhhhh lol
---
Yes. S3 and s4. Zo in s4.
---
You can play it in situation 1 and 4
---
It's fascinating that Outbreak turned out to be a proof of concept for a new Rainbow game.
---
That said, Quarantine will definitely not be a replacement for Siege for me. I'm hoping the devs don't think it suffices as a Siege sequel either. When we do get a true sequel, I hope it's true to what makes Siege special.
---
I got to play a match way after it ended because I and others queued up at like 1 minute left and waited for a game
---
Please Ubisoft
---
Cool. Glhf.
---
It's anither Rainbow Six game, not another Siege.
---
*Record Scratch*
---
*Freeze Frame*
---
Yep thats me...
---
You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.
---
Samr
---
Thats my issue. I keep forgetting they did two 3 and 3 seasons in between. I usually think the weird season they did was dropping 2 defenders and 2 attackers in Lion and Finka.
---
Same thing happened to me except when i tried to join back to a ranked game after crashing it just chucked me into a new one and i got the abandon mid game
---
Tfw you’re too thick in the head to restart queue
---
Bruh just look at the sticked post
---
Old or new
---
Its terrible now. It didn’t help at all cause people can tk you and be fine. It need to be more strict. Imo.
---
Beginning of the game
---
“PROTECT THE HOSTAGE”
---
cl_interp 5
---
At the end, yes, I feel that should've been a headshot
---
What platform? Also im neu but I could just change server in settings.
---
How is it dumb? If you compensate for recoil, and then that recoil goes away, you will miss your shots.
---
I still hear that voice over at random in my head lol
---
how do you get the character icons on pc
---
PC
---
Aw cool, is it ok if I sign up even if im eu?
---
I think the monsters would have been better being fast normally, then slow in nightshade mode. I think it would have been a better balance that way.
---
I guess, just didn't want anyone to have to much lag
---
I guess, just didn't want anyone to have too much lag
---
If  they had called it a new name I wouldn't mind too much I do enjoy it sometimes but calling it the same name when it's a completely new map from the ground up is my problem with it
---
Like Jager
---
Yeah I don’t get how people can have a 3 kd just starting, it has to be smurfs
---
Technically you dropped out of the game and didnt return in time before the game ended.
---
Guess who is pulling out the credit card out
---
They can only put in so much. And with the elites, map reworks, battle pass, and much more they, don’t have time
---
Absolutely. I had to stay back when they were running away to finish the job. You don't deserve to win if you can't complete the sacred box smashing.
---
welcome to console
---
I feel u bro
---
I also don’t get this, it’s not like they’re not releasing any new content or anything.
---
Put em DOWN! Put em DOWN!
---
?
---
Bruh, that's what makes him so fun though.
---
Nice, I just got R4C black ice today, I wish I had spetsnaz black ice
---
Attacker: shark 
---
Defender: fish
---
Oh god that scares me

Thanks for sharing

---
Wouldn't mind seeing this and rainbow is magic as gamemodes in casual or custom games
---
Your preaching to the choir here it seems if I solo que I only get shit teammates
---
No boomer
---
They'd have to add so many more boxes to the front gate if they did
---
I feel like this will make him op, then Ubisoft will nerf him and say he can't have guns
---
Get a better gaming chair
---
I was getting excited for the same reason. Oil rig would be badass.
---
You don't have to buy them, and if you are buying them with renown you literally aren't even spending anything with any semblemance of a real world value.
---
Nah, it’s not their footage
---
I feel like Ubisoft removes night naps in Ranked for the poor visibility.
---
This operator isn't really fair, competitive wise, plus Ubisoft would have to go back into every single map in order to change the lighting properties for one operator.
---
Also, I think this would be overpowered or useless, depending on visibility.
---
ooh kill em
---
I like
---
I didn’t have any attachments on it at the time other than the scope. I rarely ever run Finka or the sasg
---
It gave me a 20 second advantage to roam through the map when I got it
---
Truely going to miss this game mode
---
I did my best to protect them, it was not enough
---
It's spot on mate. Good job!
---
It was an awesome event.!
---
I agree. I have to branch out somehow. I played ranked finally for 1 game. Went 5-4 and out team won 4-0
---
Gold team six
---
Could you theoretically just walk in reverse to fuck with Jackal? like does that work?
---
Ik this is late but, what? lol
---
Just let people play, if they have fun trying hard in casual then so what? If they give you a hard time mute them and do what you want.
---
The new elite looks promising
---
Thank you for clarifying
---
The timer is server side. The infinity only delays visually. It does not actually affect the time allotted during the prep phase
---
That goes against what I WAS going to say. (I haven't said it yet, but I'm using every urge to hold me back.)
---
sounds like you’re using surround sound
---

---
Lol it was shit, what're you talking about?
---
Fuze is Uzbek.
---
people complaing about her current ability because its global 🤡🤡🤡 shes balanced she's okay, give it a rest and play a game for fun once
---
If they are gonna reuse guns they should at least put the seasonal camos that were before them on the guns
---
ANU CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE
---
the operator videos aren’t accurate and are from very earlier in the game’s development. mute has an acog on his mp5 but no acog in game.
---
I'm surprised to see Steep in this sub.
---
Nope, she never had a shotgun, her main weapon load out has been the same from the beginning.
---
r/ihadastroke reading that but thank, funny very cool
---
Your giving me a headache STAHP
---
Yeah, Ubisoft story-telling braincells tend to do that.
---
Tried that too... didn't work... I'll try reinstalling steam and the game again. 
---
Thanks anyways
---
oh
---
I mean even allies can't move the evil eyes and use the Yokai and I don't see this op as being a techie.
---
Bet my guy, I'm looking for people to goof off with

Well I don't have a FIX, but THUNT is more like a lan thing, it doesn't require you to be on any server. You always have 1 ping on it. That's why it won't happen in thunt

you're not gonna like next season then

Next do meet the heavy with tachanka

silence
---
Oh shoot I didn’t think of that. I just found the idea of taking gadget from defenders interesting kind of like mozzie how he takes attackers drone for his own use.
---
youre joking right?
---
Who's?
---
Yeah I’ll probably won’t like the attacker hope he/she has an other option for his/her primary.

Hello R6-Mega-Bot, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dssrgv/get_juan_tapped/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
U right.
---
Thatcher is good where he is, maybe after a proper thatcher substitute( rumored for next season) they could look into it.
---
Well A DMR is like the CAMRS, the 417, etc. A Sniper rifle is bolt action, like you'd see in krunker for example, where you have to crank it after every shot, whereas for a DMR, you just keep spamming the trigger until the mag empties
---
Okay or I could take buck, Ash and zofia and shoot out the wall without exposing myself to enemy fire even with a shield your still probably gonna get shot as soon as they see someone bust through a wall
---
What would be the use ?
---
Goga used this headgear in the match against BDS
---
Mate, you are acting like that will make him invincible. AdS get burnt out, firebolts are undetectable by ADS, loads of people use flashes. Sure it requires utility but no one is going to waste 3 ADS on a tachanka. Firebolts, under the floor or naded. Tachanka is a horrible pick because once the enemy finds out your position he gets bad. 
---
Example you think putting him on red in bank would be smart but once that get flamed, he can't use his gadget anymore.
---
Because some people find enjoyment in playing well and winning but don’t like the total sweaty-ness of ranked. Just because you saw some Reddit post where a team played as snakes the whole game doesn’t mean a team full of rando’s wants to do it with you. Find a 4-5 stack and do as you please, until then judging people for playing the game properly probably ain’t the move.
---
Good shit
---
Almost as bad as Kapkans who mine the objective room and any windows they can find.
---
Hell on earth if you were defending and almost too easy if you were attacking.
---
Just to make you sad: where will you place Nokk when the pin will be released since we don't know where she was born?
---
Just you. I think they are not alike
---
As I said on other answer, I bought these pins on The Koyo Store.  For the moment, all available operators are on my map.  When others come out, it will be updated of course! 😉
---
Or these last are on a mission under cover... and so, this information is classified 🤫

---
Oh my god it’s not just me... been saying the same shit forever. Siege was never designed for it, just a side effect that people exploit to try to get an easy Win. Not much can be done about it unfortunately.
---
Yes he can. In some cases.
---
I sniped someone with her secondary shotgun before, and my friend used her to pop up the hatch on Bar in clubhouse and demolish most of the other team before the Vigil fell through the hatch and had to find his way back. I've seen a lot of Amaru suicide rush failures, but I've seen quite a few good plays when she's used for more than an "omg i'm on site first, yEeT" concept. The idea is that she's supposed to be more versatile with regards to speed with rappelling and getting through hatches from below. Yes, she's loud af and that's annoying when she can be heard from practically across the map, but when used by someone with some brain functionality, she can be very useful.

could have been worse dude

This could just be coincidence.

We do need Finka 2.0 with movement speed boost
---
Okay mate if ya say so I'm sure it's true
---
Were a sledge?

since when were snipers supposed to be low skill ceiling

Get 5 planes in a row yesterday.

GIVE US ALL MAPS UBI!

It‘s a game, so why not?

oh, aight

I don't think you need to specify that you're on pc with 90 fov, us console players play on 60.

That’s Valk

More, of this

I'm assuming you were downvoted because there was nothing stopping the idea you were replying to from applying to console players, making it a redundant question.

niiiiiiiiiiice

would be a nice throw back to some good times

New attacking operator has flippers so you can hear his duck like footsteps from a mile away
---
Valiant effort my friend
---
Zofia with the LMG
---
How lol
---
because its probably part of her operator concept? i am cool with no interrogation but hack into attacker phones for location reveal but people will call me madman for changing whole operator concept :( Her luison was designed for DBNOing firsthand than kill. Her luison will have nothing different than other pistols except being a nuisance of DBNOing if she has no interrogation ability
---
Ubisoft
---
You have achieved comedy
---
Hope its low

Hello NotLucas21! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

Should you still have any unanswered question, [let the moderation team know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRainbow6 "Click here to compose a modmail message") so they can improve the guide for future buyers.

One of the ops gadget is gonna be a watergun and it can disable enemy electronic gadgets
---
It's an app called overwolf. You can check the ranks of people in your game during the match.
---
What play style do you like?
---
Zofia
---
Its ranked. And he was Plat in NA where we were playing at the end screen as well so the picture was right.
---
Yeah, but if her interrogation is worthless, nobody is going to care, and since you already want to change the Luison to lethal headshots, it already is essentially no different than any other pistol.
---
I'm getting metal gear solid 2 vibes, send in THE FOXHOUND UNIT
---
Bruh we gettin' mermaids
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Who gave this fucking platinum.
---
Yeah that makes sense so I used to play the 33 all the time but recently I've started stacking for ranked and my teammates don't want a thatcher to rush
---
same
---
You can play this with friends really easily. It was a ' community game mode' before the event
---
I want an acog on that, or better yes a glaz scope
---
*sorry I was on phone*
---
Dont get me wrong, im in agreement that the other sites are much more viable and if Mira gets through the ban phase someone has messed up.
---
I just don't think it's a poor site by any stretch
---
And yeah picking bars is a good way to throw people off, I'm just not comfortable on it yet
---
The whatnow?
---
we lost a tournament match because of this bug on clubhouse like 1 month ago  every time we used thermite charges  same thing happened
---
Who?
---
Not gonna lie, first thing I read was Operation Shifting Tiddies. 
---
I am pretty hyped though!
---
nokk as a defender
---
I guess I might be the only person that likes this map.
---
Damn tgose gents and lads are the worst. Its allways them yelling at me from bottom score how I am such high lvl and still Silver 1. Doesnt matter I'm top fragging. If they could just stop caring about ranks. That'd be great.
---
^i ^need #MOAR
---
idec about the game but I'd watch the shit out of a TV show with those characters
---
Nice²
---
hope a big tsunami of buffs for guns and acogs for everyone
---
Me and my boyfriend colored those haha
---
just Git gut its not so hard
---
/s
---
Man , that sucks
---
what do you guys think about allowing cosmetics on prismas? i feel like it would be a good change
---
Looks like an angled grip, reflex and a flash hider
---
Probably one of those brain dead Ash players who think that shooting at you with their granades launcher will make a difference
---
Do you guys have any tips? Ela's recoil is too high for my taste. Especially, since it seems to recoil horizontally as well. I always use the shotgun with her
---
yes please, Fuze should just Fuze his team in his victory animation
---

---
jesus christ thats jason bourne

I swear if EA buys em....
---
Yeah I know what a weasel
---
What is the accesories you have on the Scorpion Evo?
---
Favela would like a word with you on that.
---
That’s hot
---
When that’s done please post it
---
When will they release this season?
---
Sv 98 brother. At's what he needs
---
Shotguns are shit on attack.
---
Just click on the head, its not that hard
---
What does it mean though
---
And why not? The weekly challenges have roughly an expirancy timer of one week, but does it take you a whole week to play 3 rounds as sat in multiplayer or play 3 thunt with twitch etc.? I get it that it is a special event and they want to celebrate that/encourage people to try it out but as someone already said here these specific quests inside the special gamemode suck ass.
---
I’d rather play the pvp aspect of the game before one day you gonna have to pull out ur nuclear rocket launcher to check if they r hiding in the floor boards
---
Feel sorry for Bandit
---
I just checked your Etsy, how do I select quantity on mobile? I don’t use Etsy and I couldn’t find it, sorry.
---
But why
---
A question about the reload animation, is putting in a new mag really enough for that gun?
---

i am going to do an epic gamer moment

I showed this to a friend and he became violently ill
---
It wont be nice

no

What material is that shield made out of?
---
They already Took the Fun out of casual
---
As far as I'm aware Kali is the Hindu goddess of Death. You'll probably recognise her name from the Temple of Doom chant "*Kali Ma... Kali Ma... Kali Ma!"*
---
If you're using the app and looking at coasters, it should let you select the quantity on a drop down menu?
---
A siege players eyes are based off movement
---
I've seen this happen too much now. Varsity made a video on it recently
---
I was using the website, I’ll download the app and check again
---
Ok then thanks
---
Let me dream
---
MEGA HYPE
---
you dream of making things stupid?
---
Yeah you can
---
Pc and I'm not I'm sure what region.
---
I just called Yves Guillemot and let him know, he said he's on it.
---
A drone who can see another cloacked things.
---
Dude, I love this idea, i am 100% in.
---
Better, it adds layers to some operators, and counter echo, really well done m8
---
I will buy your entire stock
---
I think the last couple of bullets before you got downed, first hit his visor which made it look like a headshot, then I think you shot his arm/shoulder giving the blood as well
---
I play in plat one solo and you won’t believe what I’ve already seen. Like there are situations where a mate gets inted and an other is just in the next room doing absolutely nothing so....
---
Look at the top
---
Wish console could get that kind of recoil control... obviously you can with a XIM.
---
It has to be, at least when aiming at chest and above, otherwise that weapon will be useless
---
That could be a pretty dope idea. It could be used similar to a deployable shield on defense and you get like 2 of them that you can stand behind or as an attacker carrying the shield that is weaker and maybe reduces damage if seen, but if you are on cams that are at a different angle or behind the person they can clearly be seen.
---
Yeah the fact there isn't a way to shoot our lights and that there is no night vision operators makes absolutely no sense considering it's something that happens is real life all the time.
---
Ok then put one on top and second on the bottom
---
That's hot
---
Both breakable walls in the corner were reinforced
---
Why is this subs icon so specific
---
See the edit it makes even more sense to be a 1 shot killer.
---
I was playing all. Casual on Xbox last night haha. We won almost every game.
---
"Watch this, cabrones." !!!
---
Yes. Thta wouldnt make it op.
---
Love this spot
---
Ah yes the greatest counter of all time, bullets
---
It's no recoil as long as you shoot both at same time
---
Maybe they are joining at the blue team?
---
yAaaa
---
Why got this more upvotes than most creative posts. It doesn't seem fair to me so no upvote, sry....
---
That’s what I thought but they were never in the game, I checked the leaderboard and their names never appeared.
---
wait, spam emails usually contain some form of scam or at least a malicious link, does this not have one?
---
You know wearing bullet proof armor will not preventing you from being killed by bullet shot but people keep wear it for some reason.
---
I am so hyped about the sniper rifle, but I really hope that the defender gets a weapon comparable to Jägers in form of damage output
---
Russian guy who puts small entry things in doors and windows to explode people who run through
---
Regarding that owl... I think its more of a Mask, like tribal mask of sort.
---
I know
---
Dude they were definitely scouting for pro league /s
---
nah its about a second off, time to retitle
---
But I play xbox
---
It's just confusing and has a weird layout
---
What was the enemy team doing lol
---
Anyway, good job!
---
This is bs we need to nerf her until she's not even a viable option
---
It’s not a hard breaching round, it destroys gadgets like Thatcher. At least according to leaks anyway.
---
Use your drone
---
Recoil? Never heard of her
---
If no flashes limit his use 2 of them for 5 or 7 secs then it would be fine.
---
Favela, Theme Park, and Tower

He should Fuze 4 hostages instead of your team

I'm the boomer yet here you are still thinking "Lord Tachanka" is funny. That's literally how an actual baby boomer uses memes, long after they're dead and not funny anymore. If anything I should be calling you a boomer.
---
lmao obviously u can lean and throw, i meant the holograms have leaned model instead of standing straight. Alibi hologram being leaned will make atackers puzzled for a sec properly unlike rn, it doesnt work until they are out of time and its a small room
---
Yes. YEEEES.
---
Good spot.
---
Question does nades still explode or are they disabled?
---
theres still nice counterplay against it, the c4s you can throw work great as does running out of games room, valk is great to help with both of these
---
I get that, but it’s annoying as fuck when you can easily win, get dat renown, and not fuck your teammates because you lost one round.
---
Don’t think so usually they only change the layout of the map they don’t change the surrounding area.
---
I
---
*TASTE*

***SALT***
---
Sounds like you weren’t around for Glaz’s glory days.
---
u/vredditdownloader

well, at least 1 lol
---
I would like to deploy also the prisma in crouch position. But will she get the buff? I think not, her win delta I good
---
If you use push to talk set it to something closer to wasd
---
Username adds up lol. 
---
&amp; good teams know both the jump out and the C4 are coming.
---
11/10
---
I mean sometimes I tag somebody twice and then toss it and actually get the frag
---
new UI, 40+1 mag, all these are added after the recoil nerf. This is definitely quite recent
---
Destruction, and four, I think.
---
Glaz: Am I a joke to you?
---
Wooohaaho, siege never stops to surprise me.
---
there is nothing to learn about elas recoil. its random
---
Not really, i dont watch him.
---
I 
---
**TASTE**
---
IMAGINE REPOSTING THE SAME COMMENT OVER AND OVER.
---
Death, time, and doomsday according to the internet.
---
As an alternative is something neat ofc, but in a real match is hella annoying.
---
I hate not being able to see shit on the outside because of that.
---
Got any clips?
---
Specially the glow in the dark is like: hey im here why dont u go ahead and kill me?
---
That’s smart I will definitely try this.
---
What is this? 2017?
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Short bursts and the proper attachments. You have to be spot on with ela’s smg. It’s not like Kapkans laser beam. I find aiming around the high chest/neck area then the gun recoils vertically almost guaranteeing a headshot and at worst a badly injured attacker.
---
Loin
---
Maybe the defender can put it on the other side of the wall. Or maybe putting it in a drone hole covers both sides.
---
Hello xfurce, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dsyf4q/did_they_fix_the_nokks_aim_style_or_just_my_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Nice lmao, gets proven wrong and calls everyone who is against his bs opinion toxic. Stay in denial bud.
---
I was there for one nerf though, i was crossing my fingers for a buff, then they nerfed her with more random recoil :(
---
;)
---
Who could doubt Echo's hotspot and Zofia's falcon?
---
hes gold1 lol
---
That’s not the new UI are you fucking high ? My guy look at the [order](https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/Ela) her nerfs came in because you clearly weren’t playing at the time.
---
Oh, that first one looks a bit cool. Some kind of DMR with long rage soft breach, maybe?
---
Imagine maining a relevant op
---
Not salt, just truth. That was a nice clip and play, but it's kinda a dick move to destroy noobs in casual. But I guess it's just the game.
---
:( ouch
---
See you in hot
---
Ignore him my dude. He just called me toxic too for calling him out on his bullshit :D
---
\&gt;a one shot kill sniper rifle  
---
  
---
yep, time to get back into R6.
---
If I were you, I would change to muzzle break. I'm also on Xbox and the recoil is much easier to control. Bucks ar has almost no horizontal recoil
---
lol
---
1.  Place trap under window or in planting position
---
2.  Profit
---
From what I've read they plan on making the Jager alt a 1 speed. Which will be DOA.
---
I wonder if would hang upside down?

Lol he comments got deleted fast🤣

The worst is when you have an enemy team that all anchor and hide in different corners of the hidden obj. 2 minutes of each round just spent looking in every single room, and somehow no one has a drone left. Happened yesterday, fuck this map.

Marley?

Attachments mess up their no recoil slightly so usually hackers go with only sights.

Gotta go for the head as always, lol

Recoil is made easier on console because they have to use analog sticks to control it

It was casual lol we had no choice
---
Very underrated comment
---
When you know you play rainbow too much.
---
You can give some advice without being a condescending dick, you know that right?
---
So the defender(right icon) will be flying like Zennyata in Overwatch? : D
---
For ranked where you're placed against others around your skill level? Yeah, this is true. The coordination that comes from a 5 stack is going to significantly improve your chances of winning any game you're in. 
---
For a casual game where you get placed against people who play at the absolute highest competitive level? Fuck no your ass is probably gonna lose unless you're queued in a sweat stack, even if it's just 2v5. Even then, the level of coordination pros play at and the insane IGL capabilities some have just meant their 3 or 4 randos are gonna shit on you too as long as they listen and the pro is making callouts
---
This was longer than ten seconds from the first headshot
---
I just found it while messing around with in casual, didn't know if it had been found or not
---
As a console player, no, he doesn't have even one clip like this I assure you
---
I’ve used default for over 1k hours and it’s always felt fine to me.
---
12 seconds but 10 sounds cooler. Good play
---
Never copy someone's DPI and Sens. It will **not** make you better. Just find something *you're* personally comfortable with and stick with it.
---
Q and E?
---
Q and E
---
A) check when was i last active on that game, i absolutely despise it now B) how is my username revelant in this arguement? C) Everyone on pc uses MnK, if everybody has an advantage, nobody does. Callouts are 100% better made on mic, which both platforms have access to. Whats the point if typing something out when you can just say it?
---
Imagine going through someones post history to find dirt on them, you're actually the definition of a sweaty redditor
---
hi
---
So how do u strafe and lean at the same time like mid battle?
---
Im i the only one who uses holo on glaz?
---
Isn't there something to do with pixel skipping if it's below 800? I could be totally wrong but I want to say someone did tests with small mouse movements when the dpi was below 800 and it had something to do with dpi and resolution.
---
Edit: I found one video discussing it, the video I watched was years and years ago. https://youtu.be/8XNUp70mDlQ
---
I have it memorized perfectly fine, it’s really not hard to memorize it, the map just sucks. They took it outta rotation because it sucks. Can I borrow some of ur IQ tho bro since I’m lacking
---
Yeah, it's always that room against the windows
---
This clip is using the new team UI and control UI that was introduced in the past few seasons, significantly after she was nerfed. Besides, she's still absolutely killer at close-mid range
---
That was ranked \^\^
---
So the Jager knock off guy is gonna be irrelevant if he is a one speed. Jager has a great gadget, gun a speed. Even if he has a better gadget, that still won't drop jagers pick rate unless he has a good gun and is fast
---
"Reported for aimbot" Im willing to bet that's what someone said after that
---
Shoot a guy on the face and they have to wipe it off like a lesion
---
Yes, Aiming on pc is easier, but that is a double edged sword, it’s easier to you to be able to make good plays, but it’s also easier for your opponents to deny you from making good plays.
---
Although if he's an ATK caveira's silent step would counter it  
---
If he's DEF nokk's HEL would counter it
---
Where abouts in Asia? I'm in Australia and always keen for a few games.
---
They have won 9 rounds out of 9...
---
Definitely a custom game, you don’t have 9 rounds in queues.
---
I have a friend that is plat 3 and we play casual all the time. He is super chill and doesn't even say anything about kill stealing. Most of the time people are toxic to him if he doesn't try hand in casual.
---
:o they have a slightly altered version from the whole China controversy? Absolutely unacceptable ubi! I can’t even see the icon in game but I’m mad 😡
---
There is a glock, smokes primary
---
Yikes dude, I haven't been fan of them adding unrealistic, fantasy operators and gadgets since after velvet shell tbh. I understand that they have to if they want to continue releasing 2 ops per season though. I really enjoyed the grounded approach Siege had during it's early days, but maybe that's just nostalgia kicking in.
---
Another terrorst stopped one step closer toa. Better world
---
Maybe he killed himself?
---
idk I don’t really think about it in the moment, I just kinda play.

No it definitely is. Look on YouTube he did a video on how he managed it
---
 [r/ClaymoreCult](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaymoreCult/)

Ph. Can speak good english though :-)
---
And they’ll add this to Xbox how? Because they’re trying to keep both consoles the same and you can only hip lean on PC by using mouse and keyboard
---
Ela’s gun doesn’t have onr

Leaked trailer
---
You're completely right. RIP. Maybe mute jammer can still deny activation of there is one.

Maestro and rook
---
yea, that would be much better \^\^
---
Is Kaid a 1 speed?  Wow.  This whole time I thought he was 2.  Definitely one of my fav. operators!
---
Clearly Ubi must think this is no joking matter since they bottered to fix Jager's birthday skin having the emblem rotated 90°.
---
I just use Q&amp;E... good finger dexterity can make for leaning and straffing

Yeah he’s a slow old man lol.

Awwwwww yeah, I like this

And game balancing choices.

this season is lookin sick af so far.
---
Why? Because I'm sick and tired of seeing people post the same stupid idea 7 times in a row? Nah this idea is garbage look how far this dude has to hold the shield in front of him to make himself invisible it would be completely unusable not to mention how absolutely dumb the entire concept of this is. It deserves to be reported
---
It was leaked a few days ago by dataminers, it looked like that.
---
Whoops. Meant to respond to the other guy. But yeah hard breach that ignores batteries completely is really dumb. They should be making an emp type operator that makes bandit tricking harder instead of somebody else that can completely ignore it.
---
I can see why your parents feel literally nothing for you.
---
Not possible.
---
My opinion is wrong but sure bud
---
You’re a wrongun.

Edit: OMG just looked at your profile. YOU REALLY ARE A FUCKING WRONGUN!!! 🤢
---
by dot sight you mean holo or red dot?
---
Remember, remember, Glaz died in November
---
On the right next to Kapkan?
---
Doesn't Kali literally just mean Black? lol
---
You can't blame them. Play unranked instead! :)
---
How come?
---
She’ll probably have like 3-4 bullets that can destroy reinforcement.
---
Data limits.
---
The engine can’t do it. 
---
Also the amount of work they should do for all the different possibilities is huge.
---
If there was a little more development in it it could be more portable
---
And yeah like I wouldn’t imagine a fucking missile launcher that counters a grenade or a flashbang
---
Maestro and his acog MG is OP as fuuuuck
---
A couple months ago and i wish i wouldve recorded it this happend: my friends and I were drunkingly playing siege, i ended up in a 1v5 as doc
---
So here is in a kind of rwtarded way what happend
---
(All translated from german so it may not sound very natural)
---
"I need to take my heroin" *i pull out my doc heroin gun* *then just as i pull it out 1 ash comes through the doorway* "OH FUCK" *PROCEEDS TO RANDOMLY SWAP THROUGH WEAPONS WHILE HOLDING DOWN LEFTCLICK PROCEEDS TO HIPFIRE HEADSHOT ASHE* "the fuck i need my heroin" *pulls out heroin gun and then 3 other dudes show upi again swap through my weapons like a maniac again holding down left click and proceeding to hipfire HEADSHOT all 3 of them while screaming of fear* "what the ffuck was that did i just kill all of them" *i whip out my heroin gun again and AGAIN a hibana comes through the same doorway as ashe(the other 3 came from the other side) and i again swap theough my weapons BUT MY P90 IS OUT OF AMMO SO I SWAP TO MY REVOLVER AND BOOM HIPFIRE HEADSHOT TOP OFF WITH REVOLVER

More vertical

I haven’t had the chance to look in game, school just started when I found out.

Invite me bro. We can play casual
---
She would be "viable"in competitive sense where you want to pick best ops without having solo play ops (cav/vigil). She would become the real trickster and pain in ass forcing attackers to pivk Thatcher/iq more often but she should be like that. It makes sense on her too

This comment. Now i want answers ubisoft!

Yessir
---
Yea cause Mira says stopping power rounds. so I’m thinking how like zofias gadget works where the sniper rifle is the gadget and she can switch between the two types of rounds.
---
Yea I'm down
---
I disagree. Certain ops make u and the team better.

Lesion, Jackal, Buck, Valk, as example. All are strong and give you free kills if used right. Plus the weapons except for valk are top.

Aztec God of Fitness

Her win delta is good because she has really good guns. 900+ RoF and 0 recoil? AMAZING.
---
My guess would be that thw Lance doesn't breach the wall it destroys batteries and mute jammers
---
Look at me, capullos!
---
I like the skin idea but I think it is too strong if you do the pose as well.
---
But Ying if your on console, unless your really good with dmrs. Dokkaebi is good but Ying is the better choice
---
csgo is slowly getting there as there is alot of smaller stuff that had to be changed, if i remember the panorama UI update was a big step towards full source 2 conversion
---
Oh my god
---
Goyo, Amaru and Nøkk are the closest ones
---
I think you're misunderstanding a lot of things.  First, even if we assume that what you think the gadget will do is correct (which it almost certainly isn't) if you throw a grenade, it detonates X - 10 seconds after you throw it, with X being the number of seconds you cook it for.  There is no holding it for 90 seconds, the pin is already pulled.  That's just foolish.
---
Second, grenades are the direct counter.  The way the gadget works is that it pulls thrown objects out of the air and attracts it to itself.  This way you can't "burn" it with flashes, if you throw a flash this device catches it, pulls it towards itself and holds it until it detonates.  HOWEVER, if you throw a grenade, the device catches it and holds it until it detonates, thus destroying the device, but wasting a grenade which is a much more valuable asset than a flash.
---
I think the problem is you have no idea how grenades work, how to cook grenades, or how this gadget will work, and it certainly seems like you have no idea how to use grenades in Siege either because no team would ever push an objective based on a grenade throw, and no team would ever push an objective based on a gadget use without first getting intel that the gadget was efffective.
---
/edit, to add, we know that an explosive projectile will destroy the magnetic device once it catches it, the dialog that you linked to even says collateral damages within acceptable parameters.  A single explosive projectile will kill the magnetic device.
---
That’s literally a awp
---
Start with a low sens, make sure to find a mouse that is comfortable for you. Other than that, getting used to it just takes time.
---
Much obliged
---
I would main Wamai just because his name is Wamai
---
Yes that way you waste your frag grenades on destroying the device instead of using them to kill defenders
---
Big kurwa
---
Yes
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night kid
---
Should I buy Maestro or gridlock
---
Do your daily and weekly challenges and you earn tons of renown. Unless you only play situations and terrorist hunt, they give out plenty of renown.

---
No ... kali is name of attacker 100%  
---
Wamai IDK yet
---
No problem!
---
It’s literally a awp in r6 can’t believe it
---
Yeah that’s true, hopefully he gets like the Galil from COD or like a really favoured primary from defenders.
---
There's leaked CGI trailer floating around
---
This is one of the stuff that console players can't do
---
It's not about being easy to say or not, it just sounds ridiculous.
---
HMMMMMMM ASH sniper let me see the 11
---
We are looking into it.
---
He shot echo like two time and damage would be less than 60 dmg per shot and more than 55 dmg in order to one shot him with smoke.
---
Damn that even hurt
---
If it pulls in a frag and then sets it off, you can only do it once and you have to be careful that you dont suck it right towards a teammate or other device.
---
He's joking
---
It would be nice but I'm not sure if we'll get new gadgets, I think that sniper the attacker is getting is her gadget and not her primary. We might get reused guns again
---
Это очень горячо
---
red dot, the round one not the square one.
---
It doesn't matter if it glows when you and your enemy see each other at the same time or if they see you first they'll be able to kill you either way. As long as you aren't trying to hide in a dark room which can be pointless if your enemies have their brightness settings set to high, then I see your point tho. I'm wearing Lesion's entire halloween set and I still drop people no problem lol
---
Ash and Jager main be like
---
Hey everyone, 
---
We're aware of the Ela icon that's been used on this asset and we're looking into this already.
---
One time i was in a casual, 2-1 and I didn't clutch. They vote kicked me because i died to the last guy in a 1v5, even though I had 11 kills. Siege community in a nutshell.
---
It’s an emp launcher
---
Not until it gets an ACOG.
---
1 shot kill chest or head (obviously) and 1 shot down but not out if in the leg? Not sure about arm shots though
---
When he puts his shield on he seems to be a little slower than usual.  Just speculation
---
Try ela with burst fire on and the flash hider as attachment...feels weird at first but damn, you get good with it not only is there much less recoil but is also much more manageable to control, that plus you learn to choose your shots more carefully and save ammo
---
Depends on your level of play, but since you’re asking to buy ops I’m assuming you’re somewhat new to the game? I’d say Gridlock, all you’d have to do is throw your gridlocks in the objective, smoke the areas defenders will peek, then go in for plant. Whereas Maestro requires some knowledge of the game to get the best use of your Cam placements, and the LMG is a monster but to new players the recoil just might be a lot, Gridlock’s weapons are easier to control and she’s got the easiest knowledgable gadget. Hope this helps your decision. :)
---
Clash but you can’t see her from the front
---
Yeah, I really don’t see where you’re coming from. It’s just a name. I’m fairly certain Wamai is fairly common in certain parts of the world (I’ve met someone with the last name Wamai and I’ve read multiple papers by people names Wamai). I guess names are just names to me.
---
Did you yell...LETS GOOOO!!! after that? Lol
---
I can see it... it’d probably be op because when you’re running around and stuff happens. This guy would be pretty op.
---
*So anyways I started blasting*
---
it's supposed to be Kenyan I believe but I don't know what the name means or for Kali either.
---
Everything is one shot to the head :)
---
Way to hurl insults when you're proven wrong instead of just apologizing like a decent human
---
No... Finka is now watching you
---
Buy maestro lul
---
I mean stat wise he isn’t but you have a good point, you could just switch to your deagle to run easier too or remove your shield until your in place (window or angles)
---
It isn't fake, that's the real deal and I'm gonna but it as soon as it's out
---
Are you on pc or ps4? I have both and if you have ps4 we can get into a full stack, I have 3 other friends.
---
Care less and you’ll have more fun
---
Oh, so you're just a racist then? Cool.

Very true!

that's what she said eh

Verify game files maybe

A floorbang, in Casual, drawn out over 54 seconds, and it gets 2400 upvotes? OK...
---
Set lean to toggle and hold?
---
Uninstall battleye then reinstall?
---
Tried and still got the same problems though. I did almost everything from verify to reinstall the game.
---
I want her boost noise gone.   If I’m sneaking on the other side of the map, I can’t hear shit when she boosts me.
---
Exactly,
---
I'm not bragging about my 20-0 casual games where I'm a gold and I'm destroying silver and bronze people 
---
*oh wait*
---
Is that jackal player being played by Dorthy
---
do more ops pls
---
The magnet gadget: Could have a very short life span if a grenade is cooked as it will explode near the magnet, destroying the gadget (weaker ADS).
---
If the magnet does not disable, then bad flashbangs may become detrimental flashbangs as it drags it from behind the couch trajectory, to above the door and everyone's head thus flashing everyone.
---
The magnet has to disable or else he/she would just be bargain Jaeger
---
*destruction and a few other things. Not death.
---
Hyped
---
Cause actions speaks louder than words , Pulse !
---
Different queues
---
I'm oversimplifying. 
---
It's much harder to do, it's not impossible, but it happens much less frequently and there's more luck to pulling it off. 
---
Go watch shroud play pubg or siege. There isn't one console player on earth that plays like that, that makes flicks like he does. So yeah, while you can show me a clip of you doing a 180 flick with a controller, it is so much harder to do that it feels a bit lucky and takes away from my being impressed at your skill. Shroud can make the shot 3/5 times with a mouse while the best console player can't do it as often nor as quickly. 
---
To give a more dramatic example, it would be like you claiming to be good at golf and then sending me a video of you hitting a hole in one.
---
Finally I can relive using it in FNV
---
Magpie is Jager's gadget name, if I'm not mistaken
---
Lore wise, Jager is on the spectrum and also very cocky / narcissistic, so yeah. Competition is not wanted.
---
So I finally see you play R6.(Im from your For Honor channel)
---
May I ask what rank you're?
---
That's the problem I've played so much but irregularly and usually without sound I also pretty much know all the maps.
---
I disagree. The jumpy recoil and high fire rate makes for easy headshots even when you can't aim.
---
Oh, that's to bad.
---
Sounds like hes a character that has a  very specific job or role at higher levels.. a niche if you will.
---
Yee
---
the defender name is Wamai
---
https://www.ancient.eu/Kali/
---
No that's entirely sensible.
---
Yes but there is more than that
---
Do when does this new season come out?
---
Well considering Kali's sniper rifle is her ability and not her main gun, I hope that Kali has Jackal's PDW9 for a primary with maybe Ela's shotgun, for Wamaii I hope he has Vigil's Daewoo K1A for a reused shotgun idk.
---
it's seriously terrible on xbox and PS4. there's no reason to use it tho
---
It’s not supposed to be better, it’s supposed to be an alternative.
---
Jokes on you, I'm the favorite child.
---
Yep.
---
This time last year we had a group of 8 or so plat players on almost every night.  At this point I think maybe one person out of 50 friends list primarily from this game are still playing.
---
Still check in time to time but tbh it’s far from what it used to be.  More and more about gadgets and less about gun play.
---
2 issues 
---
1. People will only learn to play the same maps over and over again. At one point it will be boring and you won’t be a "good" overall player.
---
2. Queue times will be longer sure for a popular map if won’t be that long but let’s say my favorite map is bank and no one wants to play it then I’ll have to either way a long time or take bank out and play maps that i enjoy less.
---
Yeah sure. My Uplay name is ILikeTrainZ672.
---
Idk maybe put it right next to where someone tried throwing a frag
---
That’s not how Kenyan people look like
---
It would just lead to d2 heroes.
---
He’s on the spectrum? How do we know that
---
Damn i wanted it for the evo
---
It might not destroy the magnet. The trade off could be that the explosive still goes off, but the magnet has more charges (unlimited sounds strong, but certainly possible given Ubi balancing). 
---
So if you’re concerned about a smoke plant, you’re going to want a Jaeger ADS to destroy the smoke grenade before it goes off, because the magnet will just catch the smoke grenade instead. However, if you’re concerned about a few frags/cluster charge coming in through the window, you can put the magnet somewhere where it will grab the grenades instead, and pull all of them away from you. If you used Jaeger for that, his ADS would eventually burn out and you wouldn’t be protected anymore
---
It wont be huge... at least as it goes in the description
---
It is not to hard breach, it is to counter devices
---
only she should have the noise
---
CURRY FROM  DOWNTOWN
---
So we gonna ignore she said biometrics disabled meaning the sniper scope can probably see through walls.
---
That was beautiful
---
Who, in the video? That’s just Mira with her hair tied.
---
Hey can someone explain to me what’s wrong with the icon? How it’s offensive ? Thanks
---
100% this. The hypercompetitive "this gives a miniscule advantage" and "omg I can't see at all despite it being visible with more than average difficulty" people have been far too vocal, and Ubisoft has listened to them far too much. The game's gone downhill since they started doing that.... It wasn't what attracted early players to the game, or kept them interested, or had them tell their friends.
---
I used to get new people playing Siege all the time. I used to talk about it a ton. I used to buy people copies of the game if they were on the fence.
---
That's gone. It's not the same game.
---
Before the Glaz nerf, so like *maybe* Wind Bastion or something
---
Well in the video you can hear a drilling sound and an explosion it’s highly probable that it destroy the reinforcement:
---
I'm big sad because I didn't get the head gear zzzz
---
it's a bannable offense . Cause it's considered a Macro which is considered Cheating
---
So a hard-breacher glaz and a less effective jager... i mean it’s better than the last season
---
OOOOOOF DAMN nice shot
---
The new operator for Rising Tides
---
What in God's name just happened?
---
Not like this... It wouldn't be cool... he would have a shield... and do like the game artwork
---
Good. Snipers as primary weapons don't work in this game. We've had Glaz for 4 years and he's still a nightmare to balance.
---
Oh context. Got it
---
Which an ability to withstand is also weird
---
NICE! I play csgo so this level of aim is amazing.
---
You're now comparing a professional player to an average player.
---
It doesn't matter if Penqu plays casual or not, he is up there in the highest levels of R6-skill, he won't encounter players way more experienced than he already is.
---
I'm not saying **casual is harder per se**, but more inconsistant when it comes to team balance. In high-ranked games you mostly have similiar-skilled premade teams playing against eachother, whereas casual is often full random vs 3-4-5 stack due
---
I've played this game on-off since 2015 so I think my words have atleast some weight to them.
---
Based on its placement location, maybe it can be thrown like a grzmot? Roamer with the ability to quickly neutralize throwables would be interesting.
---
It is ??
---
oh, I mean I agree 100%
---
I mean she has a headgear similar to that I'm pretty sure.
---
Also Nomad has long hair.
---
i love him
---
Then it would make kaid good... just as the attack must be cordinated, so does the defense... it's fine, also, i don't believe it would be that ez to shoot through the hole
---
Okay yeah I saw alternative subs elsewhere and you nailed it. Thanks.
---
He handsome
---
Maverick :
---
#Am i a joke to you ?
---
So sniper that puts nice holes in a wall.
---
I’m sorry *ANGLED* grip!?
---
You idiot it’s maestro
---
Yeah exactly I play nomad and Mav occasionally too
---
Black face?
---
Oops
---
I especially like the awareness and timing to dodge the blitz flash. Enabled the whole play.
---
Throwable cams like valks are actually a real thing used by Navy seals, lemme get a source.
---
How's this?

https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/20/dragons_egg_land_warrior_to_the_stan/

Yup
---
Hello Vov_ko, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dt2ua0/memes_r6s/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah I’ve done a “pick your poison” on that one,
---
On one hand the 12 is hard to control but really good if you can hit the shot where as the 75 is reliable but a literal brick in your face
---
MY GOD
---
Flash hider or comp? I can't tell
---
Don’t forget thatchers EMP is possibly the most futuristic and unrealistic device in the game.
---
&gt;And again, I didn't read it all. After I reached the word "kid", I just stopped right there, believe or not.
---
Nice way to discredit your argument yet again. 
---
 I don't believe you didn't the first time and this time I believe it but I wouldn't put bets on it. 
---
&gt;If you feel like you won an argument against not native speaker somewhere on reddit and it is a huge achievement in your life, well, good for you.
---
You love your Fallacys. If I had a quarter for every fallacy you pushed I'd have... Probably a few dollars. I digress, yet maintain the fallacy point futher stating being a native speaker or not of English is totally irrelevant you fallacy ridden boi. 😌😴😳😌
---
 It's definitely an achievement for the day now that I understand your running because you probably understand your wrong but don't want to change your opinion. Even if let's say your true to your word, I'd of still won the argument so yhea I'll take it. It's a nice start to my afternoon. :)
---
&gt;Still, I think you're wrong here, but as I've found out already, that's a dead end.
---
Sorta yhea, you just use fallacy to try to rationalize your point. It doesn't work though because it's easy to call out and your best counter argument is "yOuR WaStEiNg MeH tImE". 😂 "I nO EnGlIsH NaTiVe SpEaK" ignoring its irrelevant and that you seem fine enough to elaborate on your thoughts to conure ideals others can understand to why you think your justified. It's pathetic really. 
---
&gt;That's my last message to you, you don't worth more time, sorry.
---
Hot, I love winning while they run. 😂 😍
---
Kaid or Maestro ??!?
---
Yeah it’s a real thing which is cool, but in this game it’d be gamebreaking.
---
How about first they copy uniforms and weapons? Please I want to use my skins
---
This sounds entertaining if you find it.
---
Why is this censored I honestly dont get it
---
Hack
---
Disgusting
---
Yeah same
---
Yeah it’s ridiculous how much space it takes up but it’s a headshot machine
---
Perfect way to sum up the new op.
---
And they say smoke grenades are non lethal
---
This is why headshots do 120 dmg \^
---
Last time i saw someone with that headgear and rainbow is magic outfit
---
While I'm always excited about the new content, my fav thing about these videos continues to be Mira's voice and her characterization through her narration &lt;3
---
If you can say your play style we can help. And well if not Sledge is always a good goto attacker. And Rook for defence. JUST REMEMBER TO ALWAYS PLACE YOUR  *ARMOUR*
---
I like this.
---
Isn't pulse black? Are you black? I'm confusion
---
because its rare. Legendary doesn't equal quality
---
So new jager and girl with op sniper rifle
---
try hard in casual god damn
---
Who even uses the shit recycled birthday skins?
---
It's like USSR and Capitalism, 2 things that dont go together
---
Yeah I used to run for a while but got irritated with how big it was and switched to the 12
---
Edit: though I just started using red dot on the 12 and I’m actually surprised because it’s been working really well for its standards
---
All jokes aside lol they released that for the Gameboy? I thought it was just for PS1
---
I don't even remember the last time I played him
---
Just imagine living like that irl
---
I am slightly heavy weapons guy
---
*X BOX RECORD THAT*
---
Hey just a question unrelated to topic, how do you add that thing beside your name. Like you have Hibana Main, I wanna put Hibana main also. Hope you can answer
---
someone's clearly trying too hard to be funny or savage
---
I’m not sure, depends on how she actually plays. I just doubt they’re gonna get it right first time
---
I’m pretty sure in NA, the reason most jager ash mains are so good at flicking is beacuse they practice it so much in the operator select screen
---
Up tilde?
---
Because there is no leaning without ads'ing on console they could just add it to the left thumbstick push while not ads'ing
---
Remove useless “ads” button and replace it with default dance instead
---
Actually the one in this photo is a mich 2000 with  arc rails,  the ops core has cut outs over the ears for ear pro, while black beards helmet ( the crye airframe has a two part design that overlaps at the top as such https://tnvc.com/shop/crye-precision-airframe-ballistic-helmet/
---
So he’s a deterrent?  Do not useless lmao.
---
Calling it now based on the logo, the two ops are going to be part of some fictional unit like CBRN or GSUTR. I also have a dark horse guess of them being PMCs but idk if that would break the lore
---
Dude its a fricking joke
---
As in i would be getting vietnam flashbacks when the game was supposed to go china proof
---
No shit its the china version
---
 Nothing gets by you huh?
---
Lucky you didn’t got banned for being boosted by a  cheater tho
---
*electric crackleing noises*
---
Finally a counter to Capitao! And I’m glad this clears up the attackers gadgets as some people still thought she was a hard breacher.
---
Could you stop reposting it each 10 minutes please the answer will always be no because it’s broken.
---
Go to the sub main page, there is the three vertical dots on top-right, from there you should have the option to do it. 
---
Just opened it and put it to Valkyrie for the lulz
---
damn I miss AVA. I'm still sad that dogtag failed, played the shit out of it for those 2 weeks despite the issues it had.
---
No it wouldnt
---
I've not gotten the chance to read the books. Are the books all in the same universe? Or can it be confirmed? I feel like somewhere I saw that there was a connection between rainbow six and splinter cell but I don't know about R6 and JR.
---
This would be pretty cool only effective if the op is not moving at all and non deployable. Wouldn’t be that overpowering because not full coverage and let’s be honest a shield that can’t move is basically Nitro target practice.
---
About a year ago, Ubisoft tried to censor the game to appease China so that it can be sold in China, and they altered some icons to comply with China's dumb rules, and Ela's was one of them, also, the community got mad, ahh, I remember that like yesterday
---
It was a mistake
---
Is the skin the gift? / challenge
---
Ubi was originally going to censor skull imagery along with other stuff for the global version of Siege for a Chinese release and Ela’s icon had a skull.
---
Do u actually think the Red Sea is red
---
So someone finka boosted with rook plates wouldn't fully die to a headshot?
---
What is that sniper gonna do to Castle barricades? Lord knows he needs a nerf.
---
Just switch of bomb for casual In settings.
---
dang it i was gonna do that
---
The attacker has a bolt action sniper right? under it she has a nomad-like launcher but it shoots a projectile that destroys gadgets, for example in the video it's shown how the robot shoots it in a reinforced wall and after that it destroys the bandit batteries that are touching the wall too, like a contact effect (Tatcher like) 
---
The defender's gadget is a magnetic device that absorbs grenades and detonates them, so basically like Jaeger but it also triggers them...
---
You'll see all the details Sunday when they make that live
---
Did you get this idea after you saw one of the other posts about this idea?
---
Are you my ranked teammates
---
How is it an alternative if jager is always picked and never banned on rank? Sounds like another useless operator just like warden
---
Lol the Ela icon is still the same thing. It's just a nicer...expression I guess?
---
He is my second most played attacker and I even bought his elite skin. But look how they massacred my boy!
---
Because you are playing casual it uses a different ELO system to ranked pretty sure
---
agreed and great u/
---
If you don't like casual then they made unranked for a reason, why not give that a try? And the meta of spawnpeeking and run-outs isn't going to change any time soon, better to just adapt to it
---
This is ACTUAL bullshit.
---
 I pay attention to those holograms they don't have attachments so it's easy to tell if someone is trying to pull a fast one. Just because you can't process things quickly and make a snap decision doesn't mean the rest of us can't. I find Alibi extremely weak and underwhelming her gadget isn't fooling an experienced player. It's morons that don't pay attention that get screwed by her.
---
As long as they don't let her be a hipfire monster again. I saw too many bad players just run full sprint, never aim down sights, and kill in 1 or two shots. It was insane.
---
I like her iron sights, those are always just personal preference for every weapon, some you like some you don't. 
---
I hate the interrogation ability in general, wouldn't mind it just going away. She already has a strong ability in not making sounds, interrogation isn't a must. 
---
I wish she didn't just dbno everyone, there have been times where I flanked perfect, downed 3 people, then couldn't finish them because I was out of ammo, by the time I switched to my shotgun the 4th player was there to take me out, and revived everyone.
---
Doc
---
The major trade off is that it can absorb an infinite number of non-explosive projectiles AFAIK
---
You being able to make the attacking team damage or kill themselves is possible but unlikely and I suspect won’t actually be a major factor
---
This is all conjecture until we actually get to play with it
---
I'm not upset, just mildly annoyed people choose to only read half a sentence. Who needs context? Also I am on the spectrum but that doesn't really mean much.
---
Is this pic in the us, if so were you guys in a convention or in the public street?
---
There should be an attacking op called EMP that sends out an emp blast that can effect teammates but it stops all gadgets and phones even echos, causing them to glitch and take a moment to come back

People underestimate how much of a spectrum autism is. Autism itself is defined as a social impairment. If you are unable to comprehend social cues in the moment, you are perhaps mildly autistic. The severity of autism is related to how complex a cue must be before it is not processed.

Generic name is Active Defense System, codename is Magpie, elite skin variant is called Ringed Neck.

What the one with the sniper is a mini thermite and thatcher see can go through wall soft and reinforced and isn’t stopped by bandits the thatcher bit

To be fair about every human could land on the spectrum of you looked hard enough.

It also says in the same report that he was adept at machinery because of his stern uncle  instilled it in him at a young age and he’s protective of his team because he didn’t get that warmth growing up.  I’m not saying he can’t be but to armchair diagnose a fictional character beyond a shadow of a doubt is ridiculous.
---
All im hearing is that im right
---
What about hibana, she no longer interacts with jager devices so I wonder if she will with this magnet, and also are they explosive enough to destroy it?
---
There’s no longer any throw back mechanic in the game

Согласен с тобой

Our Thermodynamics lecturer told us yesterday that as Engineers, we're all a bit on the spectrum... You're goddamn right we are
---
I thought, in order to make him viable, it would have to be able to catch as many non lethal grenades as possible. All flashes, yings, smokes all that stuff. But as soon as a real nade gets sucked up it destroys it. It also has the potential to make all nade throws be a bad nade. Imagine an ash throwing in a flash before vaulting in a window and bam, flashes herself.
---
You can learn a lot from plats 3, analysis what they’re doing to wreck you and find a counter.
---
I mean...does she ever not?
---
YO i only have that camo on that gun. Twinsies
---
You just mean it won’t be LOS? Like it isn’t blocked by walls etc? 
---
I don’t think that’s the case because in the cgi video we see that it only activates once the projectile is in LOS of the magnet. Even though that doesn’t necessarily make sense in reality
---
Hire an operator who can fix lights.
---
Super Duper Close Range detonation: Maverick 
---
Close Range detonation: Thermite
---
Mid Range detonation: Hibana 
---
Long Range detonation: whatever operator this is
---
I have the same
---
hiya, diamond goyo main here
---
𝘌𝘈 has joined the server
---
Pro players always cook their grenades, you would never be able to react in time except maybe for smoke nades
---
Did they swap her actor from ingame though? I really can't see them both being the same voice.
---
That is dank
---
Operation f(x)+1 tides
---
he's probably unranked lol given how he's spamming the thread
---
It has an emp blast? How is it similar to thatcher
---
10/10 WOULD LET THIS GUY NOT FUCK MY WIFE CAUSE IT GET ME STARTED
---
Ayyeeeee
---
It’s actually half an inch wide, just to clarify.
---
They said something about biometrics enabled. What could that mean?
---
Jaegar and this op together would annoy the shit out of Fuze. I like that.
---
The new defence op would go well with goyo, if they throw an explosive it magnetises to a "magpile" that is near a goyo shield. The explosive goes off detonating the shield. Perfect combo
---
At first glance this looked like an operator suggestion that can turn into a dog or something
---
Sir, this is a Wendy’s
---
Yeah it most probably will
---
What sniper rifle is that? Is it a real gun, or is it made up? Can anyone tell?
---
Yep thermite with no need for thatcher like I said
---
Ah shit! Now I’ve got him started
---
Mozzie isn’t a niche at all. He works on every map on every site and has an insane amount of utility all around.
---
He works as a poormans mute while also having super hard to detect cameras that attackers are hesitant to shot, oh and they can move around.
---
Then he has very good guns and a shotgun secondary for utility.
---
And then he has also has the nitrocell.
---
Im actually pretty surprised he isn’t one of the most picked defenders.
---
Yeah haha, and they released another rainbow six for the Gameboy Advance
---
definitely
---
I assume he’s a defender.
---
This would be so broken with bandit. 
---
Thermite place his charge thatcher trow his emp this dude trow his emp as well thermite can’t blow up his charge bandit trick repeat and boom no hole in a wall. 
---
You could use mav or this new op in order to counter bandit tricking but the defense could bring kaid for the same results.
---
Noice
---
could be a woman with masculine features  or even a trans woman like the former SEAL team 6 member
---
Here. This is the sane one.  
---
*^^^^^purge ^^^^^him*
---
Welcome to 2019.
---
Bandits gun is best in the game IMO
---
Ya go ahead and add me I also have no friends to play with. Sry I took so long to respond it wouldn't let me sooner.
---
That’s one way to humiliate and demoralize your enemy
---
Seething, I say.
---
The buff he deserve
---
Yeaaaaah, and I am SURE they did It to test several things, may I link my theory and thoughts here?I made a post in this subreddit, but I really wanted more people to discuss about it... I wont put any links if you don't want me to

This is the link of my speculations...

In Grim Sky, Ubisoft knowingly pushed out the season with a bug in it that dissallowed players from queuing. This bug affected a close friend of mine, who was unable to play for almost two entire weeks because of this problem. When it was eventually patched out, Ubi offered no compensation or apology to those affected (like 35-40 percent of the playerbase at the time). Ubi gives out bans to players who are boosted by cheaters anywhere between 2-15 days, and once the ban is complete the player is given a renown booster for their lost time. This means a person who broke TOS is punished less harshly and even given compensation than those affected by the GS bug, who also didn't receive comp.

Hello JAXONXII, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dt5495/delta_force_operator/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

After rewatching the video. It doesnt seem to make a hole at all, unless it's a bullet size one, and the explosion seems to be from the impact itself not on the other side, but then again it cut before we could see everything so I assume we have to wait until reveal.
---
Pozazdrościć tylko umiejętności, Panie Gracjanie
---
They had to do "headless horsman" icon for Ash.
---
Sounds balanced to me
---
.-.
---
While thatd be pretty cool, I don't think this community would be mature enough to handle that, I mean look at how they reacted to Gridlock being muscular
---
D A T A L I M I T S
---
It wasn't my intention. I was gonna flank him but definitely understood where he was coming from. But instead of killing someone , he could've spoke in the mike
---
Hopefully the iron sights get a little buff if she gets it though ):
---
Evidence that a game character is autistic. Please sir tell us how we investigate this?
---
A bio makes a few notes on his character and that makes him autistic? That's a stretch without any other pieces of "evidence" to back it up.
---
you can if you want to.
---
You want to be technical it’s my little bro’s account that he lets me use because I buy the year pass and it gets put on both of our accounts
---
Same, now i play IQ
---
Or maybe you're just not good at socializing? 
---
Not everyone is a social wizard, some people are just wizards.
---
his operator name is Wamai, the gadget is called the Mag-Net
---
she doesnt call the gadget magpie(as thats Jagers device) she says lets see how you stack up to magpie meaning how does it compare
---
Fix the game
---
Recoil
---
Pixel peeks
---
Line of sights

Bullets come from operators head
---
Bugs

Netcode fixes
---
Yeah 
---
They tweeted about it some hours ago
---
Not in the slightest. DPI changes how sensitive your mouse is too the physical movement of the mouse across the mouspad, sensitivitiy is how it is digitally translated onto the game's movment. The higher dpi means that your mouse may be a lot more sensitive to your actual physical movements and overcorrections. In game sensitivity and DPI are absolutely do not scale linearly.
---
It’s real
---
They said it could not be done
---
*can't find her hitbox*
---
No it isn't there's a bullet for hard breaching and a bullet for disabling gadgets it's not her gun ubi said NO to new guns
---
lately, i started not only to miss night maps, but also an entire roaster of maps(i just don't like these rotations of maps in casual at all) AND not a recycled content.....
---
Take my upvote and get out.
---
Oh for fucks sake
---
loin
---
Hi! Have you figured out how to fix that issue? I own the same laptop (HP Pavilion Gaming 15-cx0056wm), with the same setups, and now I'm facing the same problem: random black screen.
---
Thanks
---
Wtf? Since when have cheaters been rewarded with renown boosters? Im gonna need a source for that. And once again, you're complaining about a bug from over a year ago. We've had a nearly flawless season tbh, no insane exploits, no features removed, and non-overpowered operators. (Which by the way arent "Stolen reworks", like you claim ubisoft does "All the time").
---
Ah yes, he's so famous for being protective of his team.
---
Yeah but I feel gold and plats are ok because I’m a G1 on my main acc and I don’t have this problem most of the time. However when I’m goin against silvers these kids play like the fate of the universe is in their shaky hands. I will say it is funny when I got pissed sweat and my team and I manage to get our sweaty asses out of 0-2. The amount of times I see toggle is funny
---
Attacker launches some kind of projectile into the room as they rappel into the window. Gadget intercepts projectile and sucks it back to just under the window. The attacker is now standing right where his/her projectile is.
---
Like zofia shooting out a concussion grenade thingy, and then suddenly being right next to it.
---
Oh I see, I guess I’m not gamer enough to understand.
---
A universal skin will be on every gun ever.
---
That was hella fast, but the second I saw the post i  knew this was not intetional cuz you don't ruin the game and ban people for a few chinese bucks, keep up the great work
---
They called him a madman
---
Im sure someones done it check forums.
---
Yes, it definitely needs an irons buff
---
Can we still get packs I thought we still had till the end of the week
---
Not once. These aren't the first they've used, these won't be the last.
---
Unmanned laser car drone batteries
---
Global warming isn't fucking around
---
It was a good while ago so I don't know if it could still happen
---
Yes that would be frustrating but clash in a 1v1 is ez
---
Where's your proof? They already started they can't add any new weapons to the game.
---
console?
---
It does, a contact us link
---
The primary difference that I've read and watched (from the Ubisoft article and teaser) is that he can counter capitao bolts.
---
High caliber sniper is something I’ve been wanting for a while and I’m glad it’s becoming a reality
---
Yep exactly I used to solo que full try hard got to plat 3. Started to get repetitive, now my friends and I run at the enemies holding live grenades or lock ourselves outside as defenders lol. Not in ranked tho, wouldn’t wanna ruin anyone else’s game
---
That cool
---
Wait... Then how u lean with prisma in hand?
---
definitely something i didn't think about. worth a shot.
---
You have to wait until NEXT SEASON to fix an ICON? Lazy fuckin bums
---
Damn we haven't had a light blue in 3 years since Buck and Frost, This is fitting for the new DLC name too.
---
It looks like fanfiber made that holy. Nice work.
---
I can agree that most of the skins you see in shops are terrible.
---
About price of Elites - It's kinda the same price as for 'Legendary' skins in many other games, I think.
---
In LoL you did need to spent similar or almost the same amount for legendary skin.
---
In Pubg devs were not afraid of releasing 30$ halloween skin.
---
But I get your point.
---
Keep in mind that you can sometimes drop 'legendary' skin that can not be seen in lobby. Those skins look good, especially weapon ones. 
---
'Epic' skins like 'BI' are also one of the best looking skins in the game. 
---
I myself don't like most of MVP animations on elite skins. I find them cringy(eg Mira, Pulse).
---
Black water skin
---
Thank you
---
That's unfortunate comrade your right life could be worse. Sorry for your misfortune:(
---
when is the reveal
---
The right one is clearly the Indian. He reached transcendence so he isn’t bound to the earth anymore and starts levitating. Maybe the operator is very religious and compared with his Magnet gadget it could fit him.
---
The left one is a bird with 3 eyes. The new operator has a sniper (maybe with extra zoom) I think you can imagine what that means.
---
Now that's something worth dying for
---
😉
---
It creeps me out just imagining I had to hold a flesh covered gun or uniform lol I like it though.
---
 mostly bullshit whenever i played it but sure
---
Not sure I'll look.
---
Spotted the copper
---
There were only two universal skins. Very pretty though.
---
I'm glad night maps were removed from ranked and casual, it adds nothing to a competitive FPS and only makes the experience worse. PvE is where they belong.
---
I held F and i am still alive
---
That was a Kobe and a yeet in one, forbidden technique right there
