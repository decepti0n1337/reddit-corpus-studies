I don't play rank

No the real ranked is when the server gets ddosed üëåüèª

I read the title and was like "Who could ever love the scorpion?"

How would it be fun? It‚Äôs a shit gun on a 1 speed op it‚Äôs the most useless thing ever

It's not meant to be good. It's meant to be fun which it is

Because it‚Äôs a shit gun on a 1 speed who normally anchors ?!?!

In this situation, you sound like the most toxic person.

Aa

What level

Nice. She's still a bitch tho
---
looks like mira elite
---
Thank you for the line comparison. I‚Äôm wondering about the IQ one as well since Jager and Blitz are 100% same.
---
Castle elite skin
---
i've been ootl for a while. what happened to kronovi?
---
Or how good are you
---
Am I really seeing this black ice on a shield
---
I mean Twitch is part of the GIGN but Doc &amp; Rook drop their empty mag when using the MP5, so nah.
---
Moved over to Rogue afaik.
---
i have bloom off and valk cams are obvious as hell
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter dude. It‚Äôs happening on all platforms
---
The game should not be catered around fun it‚Äôs a competitive game so it should be balanced and treated as one. And not just add something for shits and giggles
---
Try it, you can find them at gamestop for cheap. They really improve your game skills

---
Yea sadly it‚Äôs happening on all systems
---
True that.
---
I am proud of you üëç
---
Yeah but just for fun like on casual or something.
---
I got the same skin yesterday, never seen it.
---
K/D doesn't show much in terms of skill anyway.  Don't let stupid numbers or idiots that comment on it determine your skill level....
---
But at the same point in time, her ability makes her almost as quiet as Caviera, but unlike Vigil, you get no camera feedback outside of Yokai and Mozzie cams.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Her weak weapon means she always has to flank and get close, which is what she's supposed to do. A good rifle would make her able to be practically anywhere and she'd be a nightmare, easily taking down enemies from a safe distance, then disappearing and being practically impossible to find.
---
I personally think she should've gotten the K1A, but not giving her a rifle, especially an ACOG, makes sense IMO.
---
There is no but only claymore roomba
---
Oh
---
O H
---
I play on PS4 it has happened to me 3 times so far this season. I‚Äôm in plat 2 which is why it‚Äôs more rampant because they are close to diamond
---
Ok my phone boutta die, in level 80 something. My in game name is Sunscreen_boi add me and i will play in like an hour or so
---
Seems to me like you can't do without so I don't think they improve that much
---
Do what ever  you want man your clearly not seeing what I‚Äôm texting
---
I hate that stabby boi
---
It's a one shot gun for defenders. No other gun is like that.
---
What cunts
---
Im a pepega dw
---
You can say that again

yep. i dont even like that skin, it's pretty ugly

Keep in mind that OP didn't design them.
---
Anyone notice on the elite how his eyes are so far apart? It‚Äôs like if he took off the gas mask he‚Äôd look like a praying mantis.

‚ÄúYou have been spotted.‚Äù

And that why chunk is OP.
---
Clearly whoever down voted that comment, doesn't even understand it

I can amaru EVERY time

Huh, so Vigil really can disappear.
---
Nokk's outfit is the official uniform of the Danish spec ops. It's not exclusive to her as a character, all danish spec ops wear that uniform.
---
Who else stared at this at least 3 times getting more suprised each loop
---
Yeah, I know that. I just thought you were trying to say in general it proves nothing, so my bad. In this specific case I would've used a clip however sadly Ubisoft won't do anything for you having gotten the penalty, just like they done nothing to compensate when the negative XP and elo glitch happened.
---
Pretty sure you noticed by now but all of them are traced. 
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/b2yXHvr](https://imgur.com/a/b2yXHvr) 
---
Here's comparison done by another artist on here by shrinking the original artworks and made semi-transparent before overlapping them with the OP's works. You can see that they are exactly identical in terms of every lining and proportion. It's 100% traced.

True that
---
You can hear her entering tho
---
I think you're a lucky soul haha, I don't play a TON but it does happen quite a bit to me, though I do largely play casual. I know, that's my own fault, but I just don't have the time nowadays to commit to ranked much. I'm sure there are fewer dickheads on the latter mode.
---
Finally.
---
I haven't faced it on PC, but I'm glad they are identifying the offenders.
---
At least several ppl noticed immediately with two different fanartists are calling OP out on this one. 
---
It's sad but there are shit ton of Top Posts here that are just repost. 
---
It's a shame but Artists don't really have much power on Reddit unlike in Instagram where the Artists can just file copyright and demolish reposter/tracer's account.
---
I have limited time to play so when someone is going out of their way to ruin someones game its not fun and its not worth putting the time in when i have 100s of other games to play
---
My friend had this problem, launch the game through uplay instead of steam, that fixes the problem for most people.
---
Fuck off you defensive snowflake stop reposting without credit
---
It was my favorite feature dude shit made the game a 1000x easier
---
I was Plat in my 1st season, op health, never been more since now that I'm returned where I belong! For cause of boosted noobs, ddosser, team killer and other shit like that,this elder is a good season 4 me in a while
---
*sigh* I guess I mean pc serves
---
It does, thank god I switched
---
Haven't even bothered playing ranked this season, all you get at high gold and above is just DDosing and sweaty plats playing cancer ops and spouting abuse whenever you kill them.
---
Probably won't even try until mid season re-enforcements or at least until the DDosing issue has been addressed
---
I miss it so much lmao
---
pretty much except no one objects to it because I don't play with snowflakes
---
also america number 1
---
And what if that doesnt fix the problem?
---
How much longer till you get back on Pc you think?
---
Read the patch Notes, Ubisoft is aware of the crashing, they‚Äôre working on a fix.
---
6*
---
I only play on Xbox but thankfully most of the toxicity is in silver and up. Lucky for me I‚Äôm a bronze and everyone‚Äôs either not using a mic or is super chill.
---
Why do you want to know?
---
well at least someone else had a good experience with that :)
---
I dont even know tbh bc i have to but and build a whole new pc
---
;)
---
Counts as toxic behaviour
---
Thacher's eyes tho
---
Dope
---
It‚Äôs literally the best elite in the game
---
[removed]
---
I can't find the artist dude, also a lot of people still says I didnt source the artist because they didn't even read the comment section so it's kind of pointless
---
Come back to me, because that should work
---
Yo, Its like that one meme of a white chick surrounded by black guys/African Americans
---
U mad bro?
---
Op for two seasons, broke the game and the only operator to ever get perma banned in pro league
---
Oh shit, non of it is salvageable?
---
I got a really nice epic skin!
---
On the G36 :(
---
It didnt fix my problem
---
You'll get better. I didnt do placements until I was about level 50 and had roughly 70 hours on the game.
---
Damn your the one that sounded mad snowflake
---
https://youtu.be/3lUQVMyCHWo there's going to be a ban wave soon
---
&gt;who rage quits because they missed a spawn peek anyway?
---
the majority of spawn peekers lol
---
Try validating your game files in steam, if that does not work the next step is a full reinstall.
---
Congrats!
---
None of it bro and even if it was i wouldnt use ut everything smelt like rotten milk when i got back bc it was left there for a week

hey man, no one's forcing you

honestly haven‚Äôt had a problem with the shields, they were basically the same thing before were they wouldn‚Äôt fit in doorways. ela‚Äôs shotgun will probably not be nerfed because of how much she was nerfed. What‚Äôs your problem with kaids shotty?

Thanks

you wasted your money when you bought this game

i feel like he‚Äôs pretty balanced, really, only low ranks use fuze. once you get gold+ you start to not see him anymore, people learn how to avoid him and more people will be off site and a cluster charge going off is a perfect opportunity for a cav to interrogate you.

---
To sum it up in super short points, find a consistent squad, be willing to play support ops like Therm/Thatch, and have good comms with your team (callouts/strats)
---
Apart from that the best thing you can do to improve is play more. Even if it takes 1000 hours - keep playing and improving
---
my fault you can teach a monkey how to use google you're acting like a whole buffoon
---
The TCSG-12 is essentially a dmr so defenders with a dmr is too strong in your opinion but you have no problem with a defender having an LMG? Also Ela's shotgun has worst in class stats in just about every category, the only benefit is fire rate which makes it good at close range; you know, the range shotguns are supposed to be good at.

I hate when this happens it should automatically activate them or there should be a setting too with the amount of times this has happened to me it‚Äôs insane

I don‚Äôt think I could even make it there with all the issues with console honestly - I‚Äôm happy with diamond :D
---
I know, it‚Äôs really sad
---
Tracing artwork is definitely not "inspiration".
---
The moment he spawned I knew what he was going to do. But then had a doubt thinking "oh, maybe it's something actually different because it wiuld be so obvious it it was."
---
nope.
---
IRL there is no such thing as a sniper rifle.

They are normal rifles (usually with attachments like scopes and bipods) used by snipers

If I dossed, wouldn‚Äôt I have zero losses for the season?

Central us servers? I thought there was only west and east coast.

Monty and Thermite still get banned a lot

No one knows for rn but the free 7 day battle pass will eventually happen this season while the full Paid battle pass is next season

The sad part is this is unranked and he ran clash every round. Even walking outside to shock people. Lame ass op with an even lamer playstyle
---
First shia on hot ones now this? Now I gotta go watch the movies again.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a ‚Äòpush,‚Äô more so persistence and obviously playing for as long as I have. I‚Äôve been Plat since Operation Chimera and every season since I get that little bit closer - until I eventually got there :D
---
WAT rainbow 6 royal????
---
Finka Shotgun
---
With all the issues with console combined with how long it took for me to get diamond? Probably not - I‚Äôll sure as hell try tho
---
I've never seeeeeeen it
---
What siege really needed, an even faster Ash
---
Just slap that juicy Halloween mask on it and he looks like new :)
---
Bc he's super important for the  attackers and if you have defense first he's a good one to ban
---
It might be that he can disable defender electronics like bandit‚Äôs shock box.
---
Is there any sign of a N√∏kk Ar inside?
---
True, I‚Äôd be willing to bet Jackal gets banned more though. At least in my games in the low to mid gold range
---
*please make hibana as pretty.*
---
Ok never mind, I‚Äôd try to find a consistent squad if I were you - helps a ton in the higher ranks
---
Well, thatcher is kind of broken. He‚Äôs got one counter, Jager ads, and thats only if you throw it in site or something. But that doesn‚Äôt usually happen.
---
Anthony Anderson was like 40 years old in this scene too

saying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt hack‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to help anything, getting mad and retaliation is exactly what the hackers want. i don‚Äôt hack, but i used to on CS:GO and that‚Äôs where the fun came from. so really just report them and keep quiet, if you don‚Äôt do anything then it sucks the fun right out of it. record it, send it to ubi/reddit, there‚Äôs not much you can do but hope that battleye does something about it.

Lmg u still have a chance against. , ela shot gun is pretty op even on medium range fights. The fire rate needs a nerf

oh i didn't know that, still the art is pretty cute
---
I have an excellent wifi connection but my ping never stays lower than 20.
---
I'm just a level 60 gold I noob so don't take my word for it, but I feel like solo ranked is a game of luck and not so much skill. You can do really well and be in a team with high ranks, but if they don't communicate or think they're a god tier player you will end up losing and no matter your individual performance this will affect your rank. 
---
I kinda hate the fact that individual skill isn't really taken into account as much as wins when you've solo queued. I understand that a five stack's skill shows through their wins and losses, but a solo queuer can't do much about RNG. Now I just play a ton of casual and try to seek out good gold/plat players to team up with.

If I get anything more than a 3k I drop one word in chat.

No

He changed to creative mode
---
Bro....what are you even saying?
---
We do not have the rates chart for after the buff. The last chart we had was the day the buff was released, so it was before Glaz got better.
---
And no, there are people who use him. Yes, he's niche, as a high damage Marksman should be in siege. So, if you are citing data, it is only logical that we wait for the post buff data to be released.
---
Yea I agree Black Ice is nice and all but it shouldn't be uploaded to reddit for karma. Who tf cares if u got black ice; it's not worth it even if u got some skin that has a 0.01% chance of dropping. It's rare sure, but not rare enough to brag on the internet.

Problem with KD is that there are so many other things going on that aren't counted. Droning, cameras, operator gadgets, callouts, defending objective(s), watching for roamers or people entering in weird spots. Just because you aren't breaking even in KD doesn't mean you aren't doing these things which allow others on your team to score kills.

No I think they are doing some testing on those maps because instead of making new maps they are gonna start reworking old maps

Ubisoft themselves have stated it is cheating, they just can't enforce it because adapters trick consoles into thinking they are controllers.
---
And you constantly make new accounts to discuss the similar, if not the exact same topic, only to delete your older accounts every time the discussion is over.
---
I responded often to most of your past threads to see where the discussion go but you are not being subtle at all when you are using similar accusation such as "ppl don't like you and you are rude to everyone" when people disagree with you without actually having any evidence to back your claims that someone is actually rude in the past while you are probably going to delete this account sooner or later as well.
---
I guess so, should have probably said, like if it scans an enemy then it will become inactive and wont scan anymore, but also work like a lion ping where it pings a couple times
---
It‚Äôs definitely against tos, I believe if they could actually detect it it would be a permaban, but with the mnk adapters‚Äô constant software updates it‚Äôs impossible for Ubisoft‚Äôs software to tell.
---
Happens to me too. Might be your blood pressure spiking during intense moments. Do you smoke? Smoking also messes with circulation.
---
Yes
---
Fuck I‚Äôm stupid
---
Smoke, love his new elite
---
In my personal opinion, the Smoke elite skin looks nice. The second most casual elite skin in the game, second to IQ‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, you can‚Äôt change my mind that Smoke‚Äôs elites skin is pretty frikkin good
---
Could be worse. Could‚Äôve gotten the R6 Mix Tape Charm like I did......
---
We don't need anymore operators that can scan people and spot them. There are too many of that in the game already. Also, any anti roamer gadget needs to have a disadvantage to the attackers as well because the anti-roaming utility on the attacking side is already plentiful so there needs to be some sort of balance.
---
There is so much that I love about this. The unflinching Lord. The amazing wallbang. The loop so smooth I didn't see it. God this is good.

Look at it that way: sure, with the free battle pass you'll get a portion of the items that you can otherwise pay for. If the battle pass doesn't exist at all, all those items could be available for free for everyone. What's most likely to happen is for some of the cosmetics that would be added into the game for free to instead be added into the (paid) battle pass. In this case nobody except Ubisoft wins.

I'm just guessing OP is pretty young and doesn't know the possible consequences. If this was on Instagram the original artists can easily terminate OP's account.

If you read through the comments, two different actual R6 fanartists are calling OP out.

Made my pp hard

It‚Äôll happen, just gotta be persistent

I got it in my third alpha pack ever and ash is my least played character
---
My unluckyness is immeasurable and my kd is ruined

Just get good

A buddy is having it happen every match. I have a pro and I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but it doesn't happen as often.

After adding the 20 rounds it deserved, it‚Äôs my primary on twitch again. And lion if random gives me him.

That's crazy!

I mean, i dont have friends to play with either because almost every one bought a good pc and moved to pc while i only have one that i bought from like my countrys version of craigslist for 300‚Ç¨, which barely runs siege with 60fps on minimum settings and i dont even have a good table for playing shooters on pc. So i completely feel where you are coming from.
---
 So i just have been playing casual too but now since unranked is a thing, i have started playing that instead.
---
Btw i am like lvl 141 if i remember correctly
---
And you probably play on pc aswell judging about you talking about your uplay friends never playing
---
I like that one, albo NOICE
---
[Nice](https://youtu.be/ZtgYceAo8IQ)

It's so dumb that you need to activate them. When a new challenge cones it should just start counting
---
Not too sure tbh, I think it's just your rank locked at end of season?
---
Can't say never heared of it then again I absolutely NEVER get legendarys
---
Yeah, tbh it's fine. I got a good chuckle of it too.  The struggle is real.
---
Of course it is wdym it‚Äôs beautiful

I use the elite homeboy, I know how to play frost 4.2k peak,  the barb wire is super handy

Thanks mate! I'm sure it will, just gotta keep grinding!
---
Good gun too. Nice
---
I actually get 110-120 on Weu but that's not my problem, I'm unhappy with the Seas server, last year I used to have 60 ping in all of my games, now I get around 200 in most games I play on it, which f's up the hit registration

Honestly, I can't say that I agree. My r6 ranked experience has been far, far worse than my csgo ranked experience. Between the number of cheaters, griefers, and throwers, playing with ransoms on rank is a nightmare, and I'm convinced that it's near impossible to get to plat without queueing up or having a string of lucky games with decent teammates.

The SMG-12 is one of the only guns in the game with random recoil, how is there any pattern?

Sorry rushed through that when I wrote it. The formula is what is written in the blog post I linked.
---
The missing part is to find your desired 360 distance I used a program which you can see a tutorial and download link to [here on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyWE9kIw-Yk).
---
It has Siege as one of it's default and tells you what your 360 translates to in distance which is how I figured out the distance you wanted to use in the math problem.
---
Actually amazing

only on console

Cheers, bigman. You have no idea how much this means to me.

Yeah, Ive done it to friends and have had friends do it to me, which I think is fine. I just hate when a stranger does it.

Yeah, i‚Äôm blonde and my brother has almost black hair too. Still, Ela can‚Äôt have hydrogen-blonde hair when her eyebrows are clearly brown. (Or I guess she could dye that but I feel like that‚Äôs unlikely.
---
Black ice LeRoc would be so cool to have
---
as long as your below gold 1 youre safe i think

Oh ye forgot about the eyebrows. Hydrogen blonde is can be natural (incredibly rare) but yeah brown eyebrows and H-blonde is a big no no.

Its not ping fluctuations, thats every console players screen every game no matter what.

Insanely unlucky hip fire lol. That‚Äôs actually hilarious, if that was me I would just go off
---
I can agree but sadly this post won't help anything, the game is still gonna be toxic haha
---
Lvl 157 no black ice
---
I just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible. The barrel is pointed downwards not to mention the printer to her left blocking a portion of it when she tags me. You guys are probably right but that is some grade A bs lol
---
Aimbot?
---
She's a good early warning, trap op. Valk is good for the extra intel if someone is watching but Ela you can place and wait without being on cams or needing others. plus the stun effects give you that slight advantage when engaging.
---
the ar and pdw from jackal
---
Kaid is my favorite defender. That shotgun with a silencer is a pure sniper rifle
---
I look at her as kind of the opposite of Finka.  Finka is frequently very helpful and you're pretty much guaranteed to help the team with her in ways that are unique to her unless you just don't use her ability or use it completely mindlessly.  She doesn't *feel* that great though because you don't get that "that worked because of me" feeling where you know you did what you could only do with Finka.  Instead it's "I used my ability and the gun fight was won, maybe it would've been lost without but maybe not."
---
Nokk very rarely does anything that couldn't have been done with Ash or IQ, her footsteps with her ability are about the same volume as theirs crouch walking and her ability to evade cameras is so rarely useful.  However, when you do get the chance to walk past a camera someone is watching and get a free kill on someone that thought they *knew* no one was there it feels like "holy shit that's so strong and I never could've done that with any other operator."  Which it's true that you couldn't have, but it so very, very rarely happens that it actually isn't strong at all and almost every round you play her you'll end up with a useless ability while you could've brought someone else whose utility is always useful.
---
I'm not sure how exactly would be the best way to buff her, I feel like 3 speed would at least be a good start but I don't know if that'll be enough.  Right now though, picking her is essentially betting that you'll get really lucky and have one of those rare rounds where she's useful.
---
Goyo also had the Designated Marksman Shotgun
---
HAS*
---
_Caveira_
---
Nokk: Buff the gadget and her equipment over providing an ACOG. I know you didn‚Äôt suggest for an ACOG but so many people do, and I agree with you that she doesn‚Äôt need one. Here are a few suggestions ‚Äî&gt;
---
- Remove Waveform effect off Yokai Drone; Keep it on Mozzie Drones
---
- Provide her with Smoke Grenades and Frag Grenades, instead of Breaches and Claymore. This gives her more options overall and provides her more value overall. 
---
- Provide small buff to the FMG9 (and MP5K) whereby their damage is increased to 33 (from 30). This would help Nokk but wouldn‚Äôt impact Smoke too much especially as players often run the shotgun and SMG-11 combo. 
---
- Lastly, I‚Äôd louden crouch walking for all players, which will in turn pseudo-buff Nokk (And Cav) die to them having a movement quieting ability 
---
These small changes would improve her a lot, and make her just more valuable to the team, which is her big issue at the moment. 
---
Warden: Id again just rather see gadget buffs over speed or weapon buffs ‚Äî&gt;
---
- Remove Movement penalty to vision while seeing through smoke, when glasses are active.
---
- I would also give him an additional primary weapon which would be Frost‚Äôs 9mm C1. Provides an alternative feel compared to the MPX with lower fire rate but higher damage. 
---
- Remove Barbed Wire; Provide Nitro Cell (Swap with Goyo, who bow gets Barbed Wire over Nitro Cell)
---
These small buffs would help. I think he‚Äôs just fundamentally niche and there‚Äôs not much we can change to help this, however because of this, he should be strong in his niche. These changes achieve that
---
So I might as well get ela first
---

Caveira makes me want to shoot myself.

So basically, siege console is f**Ked.

Yes. That perfectly describes it

It literally just happened to me lmao

Yeah I agree. Didn‚Äôt even make the attempt when this started. Happened about three or four times for me. Sticking with casual and unranked for now.
---
Downvoting cunt

Are you a soft or hard breacher?
---
Tell that the turtles.
---
Due to how squads are bullying solo queuing players . Ubisoft made RFF works on the entire squad to prevent part of the squad players TK that solo queuing player
---
I definitely second this. Comparing me and my squad mates seems unbalanced if you only look at numerical stats. I have the highest win/loss and K/D by far (my K/D at the start of the season was like 1.7) when compared to my buddies, some of whom are rocking like a .7 K/D. But when you look at our gameplay we are all pretty much equal in terms of skill, we just fill different roles. I tend to frag the most, but I‚Äôm pretty feast or famine- either I go off on a tear and get 3+ kills or I die 1 kill in. One of my mates is insanely good at clutching late round- I don‚Äôt know how he does it but his game sense is superb and he just knows how they‚Äôre going to play. And my last buddy is our utility guy- any op you need run, he can do it. He may not be raking in kills left and right but he‚Äôs certainly someone you can depend on for filling any role. And in a team based game having a wide variety of strengths is honestly better. Just wish the community wasn‚Äôt so hot and bothered about personal stats all the time, they don‚Äôt mean much
---
Unranked is for practicing for ranked. Ranked is for potatoes to ruin their teammates MMR.
---
Last time Ubi revealed her face. It didn't go so well. *Coughs in China*
---
Pet the supplies. Good supplies.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôm starting to put suppressors on every gun, idk why but it feels like a different gun/game.

Also I love getting yelled in voice chat about having a suppressor equipped

This community disgusts me

How about no. She slows you, damages you, can be a real pain in the bumhole if you are in a 1v1, and bulletproof from the front. Good luck if you are playing bomb and you have the defuser

It just finished it‚Äôs newest season last month, and it was great. I had no idea what jojo‚Äôs was a few months ago, but then my friends forced me to watch an episode and I got hooked.

No the real ranked is when you get ddosed, your half of your team throws, one teammate leaves, and the last one can't even shoot straight. That, my friend is how you play ranked üëå

If it says it needs to be done in ranked or cas, then no, if it doesn‚Äôt specify, you should
---
Finally a worthy opponent

Even modern warfare 2 didn‚Äôt have this toxic of a community, people talked a lot of shit but they all wanted to play the game, in this game people tak shit and troll and derank and grief and throw and everything in between, constantly.

I thought that as well, looking away has never saved me

It got changed during Y1S3.2 (Mid-season reinforcements of Dust Line)

lol nah man, I've been playing since release. Still play regularly. It's like a reddit meme that she doesn't have a broken hitbox.

That is so not epic

&gt; bullets coming out of the guns sights not the barrel 
---
if the bullets came out of the barrel you would never win a gunfight close to a ledge. If you're rappelling up or crouching behind something you would need to expose your entire upper chest just to shoot back, you'd never win another gunfight. Why would you not want bullets going directly where you're aiming?

No idea.  Maybe they‚Äôre not experiencing it themselves so they don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs wrong.  Usually a semi-regular blue screen is a sign of internal problems but with Siege doing the exact same thing for hundreds or thousands of people, you have no reason to open up your system, void the warranty, and try to fix a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist.

An instant return TK for a TK based simply off of someone trying to be a dick or not caring about forgiving you is unfair and selfish to the rest of the team. You're will to basically handnthenenmy team a free round win for the satisfaction of killing someone who TK'd you. Congrats, you fuck over an entire team because you want to solve a problem. What if someone wants to mark it as intentional but doesnt want the person to die for this very reason? Are we just going to keep adding more options? The RFF works fine as is and even better when they implement squad RFF. You're trying to complicate it and make it less helpful to the team at the same time.

How is it different?

They need to remake that and animate them
---
That was not a good thing for me to read in this room where I'm meant to be quiet.
---
Silver 3 is at most 2399 and plat 3 is at least 3200 so there‚Äôs a decent amount of room for it to be possible there.
---
I should do that, I mean technically I do have the ultimate edition and should have all of Its contents

You got ddosed console is super easy to ddose on console idk how they do it but they manage to 12 year old Timmy gettin Trojan horses on his shitty Xbox i guess

The only people who claim you can't control reciol with a controller have never used a controller for more that 5 minutes. It's more difficult but very doable.
---
Usually because people can easily distinct the sound of his cluster charge and just move around it, that and he‚Äôs a 1 speed so he‚Äôs loud and clunky. Usually when I play him I use the charges for destroying gadgets.
---
Dude uploaded the same clip 3 times
---
So... whoever took this, OP I‚Äôm guessing... got accidentally shot by Doc, because he forgot to grab his stim, then shoots doc. Doc survives and gives him the health this time, and OP kills doc...
---
Unless the audio tells that they‚Äôre friends, this would be a griefing report against OP.
---
As Doc didn‚Äôt look like he meant to use his pistol.
---
But what do I know. I listened to this without audio.
---
Do you guys play together?
---
Just wait till you play Ela.
---
I love how no one is getting the point of this complaint. Watch the video!! She was turned around
---
[Here you go, smartass.](https://imgur.com/a/ARrf04M)
---
Because he is slow and his gadget is slow and makes a very audible noise which makes it easy to avoid. A lot of objective sites also have little to breachable surfaces to even place his gadget on, eg Armory/Lockers on Border. Putting his gadget on windows is pointless because it's so loud that anyone on the other side will take notice and kill you so that's a death trap for sure. That leaves only fuzing from above as a viable alternative, but playing from above is much better done by Buck or Sledge who can open up many lines of sight and put much more pressure on the defenders below.
---
Its always done this on like every platform idk why tho
---
Knew you could do it
---
I think they could make it a LITTLE tighter and push the camera forward more but other than that yeah it's fucking awesome.
---
Said by a bunch of random people? Well then it must be true!
---
I would assume they did. I don‚Äôt see why it would be a temporary ban
---
You should have bombed him.
---
This is amazing
---
I have! I just like Frost more for some reason. Ela was the first one I played and I still play her occasionally :)
---
Where yall get the guns
---
I almost always run Suppressed. Im sure it's not optimal on all guns, but it works well for me.
---
no, he does one ping every 5 seconds, alibi does several quick pings, lasting only about 5 seconds. So Alibi spot last 5 seconds, Jackals is like 20 seconds.
---
IMO its because there are so many ops that are better than fuze to use. Ignoring pick-bans, a normal comp probably includes thermite/hib, thatcher, zofia. The other 2 could be jackal, gridlock, 2nd hardbreacher, capitao, bb, sledge/buck etc. With fuze being so niche and even with his buff, you are risking your life for a very low% chance for a kill and maybe some gadget destruction.
---
If you want an actual knowledgeable answer, try asking the pro league sub, they will know a lot more when it comes to why its not played in pl.
---
New sledge skin

Dont cheap out on credits. Get them legit or dont get them at all unless you want a ban or a scam

Welp, time to start practicing with the extended barrel I guess

Play with a squad because randoms are unreliable always since like 2017 that was a annoying thing
---
Bruh it makes a smaller Diamond referring to a smaller reticle that is more accurate at long range, so we can just agree to disagree, but ur wrong, look up a youtube video dumbass.
---
Might also wanna include the recoil direction mitigation that rouge9 did, great graphic tho!
---
Nothing even happened
---
Sorry I thought you mean the visual style of the pings. I don‚Äôt think Jackal would be good at all if his scans only lasted for 5 seconds. I like the 45 seconds idea though
---
Feels kinda lazy no?
---
Mostly everyone really
---
Ya it wasn‚Äôt really special
---
You did it you crazy son of a bitch, you did it

Boy if you don‚Äôt buy diamond right fucking now

Already got it broüòÇ

---
Racking up kills as an individual player isn't necessarily important. What matters is you can kill when in counts and ensure the win.
---
What sort of ops do you use and what roles do you usually play? It may be that you're just not playing fragging ops, which is completely fine as there are many more aspects to a player's skill.
---
Unfortunately, Blitz was fighting for the other side at the time. We lost many good men to the rush.

Lol, I have never had any problems. (Ps4)

No problem my man, now give Ela her impacts back.

Realistic as in style. CoD, Siege, Battlefield, PubG are realistic. Overwatch, and Apex are kinda cartooning. Not the gunplay or health, but the art style.

You know blitz IS German right?

---
I still can't tell where it loops
---
I wager that is because "folks here" are not players who play this game for fun but rather for ego boosting by the responses I have gotten so far...
---
Unranked lacks any motivation to play as I have stated, because it does not have ranks to grind. My main argument is that the skill level is arbitrary in the first place, since last season I was perfectly fine playing with them. Now one unlucky ranking phase later I am excluded from playing with them which completely ruins the game for me. No-one plays unranked because it is honestly just bad. You constantly get matched with the same sweaty wannabe-teams that use it for training.
---
Ubisoft needs to target the actual boosters and not full parties of 5 friends who want to play together. Why not adress the MMR balance rather than restricting players from playing the damn game?
---
Thank! I'm glad:3

Sounds good bro. Thank you! As it happens i've been playing the MW Beta on PC for a couple days now. Damn it's fun haha :D

Im sad cus no1 is playing alibi :(

It‚Äôs never said but closing and reopening does the trick cause when the title appears and you load the game up it gives you the option.
---
Why‚Äôs echos mp5sd look like it was one of the first fully automatics made
---
There _were_ people getting paid by boosting players to diamond.
---
I probably would‚Äôve picked someone else over Ash but overall they are pretty decent bans for Coastline. It‚Äôs a shame we don‚Äôt see this kind of stuff more often.
---
Golden clip but the title combined with the aim is ironic
---
Bruh stop stealing content
---
Yeah thats hella cool, I never got to see this screen but it would be alot cooler.

Try playing the more difficult sites. And if your attacking get a group of friends ban jager and go berserk.

Fuck you
