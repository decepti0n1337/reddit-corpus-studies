That's not what that means at all though. The win delta is a measure of winning percentage above or below average. She has an above average win delta meaning you win that percent more than normal. If somebody had a +2% last season and +1% this season then there winning percentage went down that 1%. It doesn't mean she gained any additional winning %.

That maestro nerf is dumb af. Honestly as a maestro main, is rather have them take his acog away than that stupid nerf.

Thank you so much for the help

I mean really thank you

I think the simplest is to match make at the elo of the highest player in the party. Queue w/ Plats, and you play in Plat, etc.

Well, Frags are obviously out of the question, yeah, changing her secondary gadget won't balance her AT ALL, so, a rework would be a good idea because if they keep nerfing her, she's gonna be too weak, like Nerfbeard overhere, I'll create an animation and I'll send you a link

I love Clash but what can they do that won't make her annoying as fuck. The switching from gadget time is brutal but necessary, she was too capable before then. I like the idea of her being teammate reliant.

LFP586 is a revolver

SG-CQB is a shotgun

Another fun cav counter is to use the lion drone when they interrogate, suddenly everyone can see everyone.

You do realise that the horizontal metal ventilation system on your left has a drone hole right? and a ramp so twitch drones can get in

I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. I like the idea of Nomad’s gadget. Gadgets to slow down roam era are neat, but there needs to be counters to it. They have the perfect solution. What is it? Terrorist Hunt C4’s. They are proximity based, emit sound, have a delay, and can be countered. My idea is that airjabs should emit sound that is a little quieter than that of a C4. Having a delay makes her way more interactive and balanced. If it’s on a doorway, a t hunt C4 can be shot if you’re quick enough. Airjab’s should be the same way. They can also be detonated if you step in and out quickly (you won’t be affected). This would cause the airjab to go off, but the attackers can’t just get a free kill. You could be downed or you could be baiting. This idea keeps what she was meant to be, while also allowing for interaction and counters.

Maestro change is unnecessarily harsh and is a significant buff to twitch but otherwise good update.

---
First off, I’ve had my idea before they announced theirs. Second, they are only adding sound. They are not adding a delay. It’s a pathetic excuse for a nerf. Lion was nerfed too. They took away one use of his gadget and they also increased the cool down time. It did nothing to reduce how ridiculously broken he still is. It’s the exact same situation. You know the airjab is there, but in most cases, you can’t do anything about it. Same with lion. You know the gadget is about to go off, but it doesn’t matter. Standing still is not a counter, just like not flanking is also not a counter.

Rainbow 6 Siege is entirely unaffected, this was the case in alpha stages of the ID change system. Everything will play as usual if you change your name.
---
You’re fine. The name change really doesn’t affect anything. The disclaimers are there for that rare instance something should happen, Sony is safe because they warned you

Isn't the f2 still considered one of the best guns in the game? Honestly seems interesting to remove the acog

Was fully expecting this in the comments

Then you don't have any financial responsibilities or obligations. Once you're an adult and do you won't have a problem with people trying to make as much money as they can.

What the fuck? You can shoot the airjab? How can you not do anything to them. Especially being able to hear them. Them being delayed is useless

If it’s in a doorway, you don’t have enough time to locate and shoot it before it detonates. It goes off the instant that someone enters its proximity.

why not a breach charge? because you could do the same just way more limited?

Teams will still take advantage, it's a weird thing with lion because overall his delta isn't very good, but if you looked at his delta for 5v5 it would be a different story, he's kind of like ryze on league of legends, when he's played in solo que by less skilled players he's gets a very bad overall win loss, but the moment you put him in the hands of a skilled player, playing with a team he becomes a highly contested power house because of what he can bring when communication is involved  
---
And it's not just the 4seconds is also the 3 seconds you need to set up to be sat still,ost players are very predictable so go to the predictable spots, in this time the ying nades are flying in the the finka boost kicks in, with anything from a thermite blowing a wall open with a Thatcher stopping all your gadgets, the main problems with this is there is next to no counter play, hence why lion was banned in the pro league, as ying and finka are still a string combo but the fact lion forces you to sit still while still been flashed pushes them over the edge, and the fact this can be use as a late game strat after roam clear but can be just as if not more powerful as a rush tactic, lion allow too much flexibility to a set up, without putting him self in any damages gaining too much ultily for just himself nevermind his team, but without having counter play

Most the time if you know it's there you can still hit it. Plus that just means it's a good placement. Like how you often can't hit certain jagers from a doorway. It's unfortunate, but with a delay the airjab is useless

As for his gun, idk what to tell you except that you are wrong. The ttk is insane (just below the F2 and C7E iirc), manageable recoil, ACOG,  and 81 bullets. If that wasnt enough for you how about having a shotgun pistol for destruction just because.

either way your highest rank was gold 4 and your kd is .88, also you can't prove that you've been playing on friends' accounts, and even if you have like I said your highest rank was gold 4

If you don't want him to just have 1 reinforcement he could always buy one of the cheaper operators that only cost like 250 or 500 cause part of the game is grinding for them and it's more rewarding to buy them

There is not soft solution, The console tells the game that its a controller.

And for you other point it doesn't matter because every sight is on a screen or a tv they all look almost identical on 2 different screens and there is only 2 variables there that make a difference. 1) there sight like if they required glasses or contacts. 2) colour blindness as they may change the colour of the retical they see and could possibly make it harder to distinguish the sight fron the target

Playin blitz is like throwing a dice, you never know what the fuck is going to happen. Everything from a boring kill to get smashed through the shield is on the board, and that boi was not a lucky blitz
---
Actually if you know how to read it says they did a ranked reset they changed they way ranked works but before that they had a ranked mode that also said beta. All the changed was the elo system and added ranked rewards i still have my plat charm from black ice and it said beta go watch gameplay vids because you are wrong
---
Still doesn’t show any elo gain or rank up to silver 1.
---
Nothing like a dude snapping onto your domepiece at breakneck speeds
---
Yeah but you’ll spend a lot of time on the evil eyes and dead teammates can always watch them to warn if a shock drone is nearby. Then you can use the evil eye to destroy it.
---
Yes just do the same steps as you would put it on the first time.
---
The match ended 4-5 we put up a good fight, but my team and I definitely would have won if they didn’t have unfair advantages
---
Nice

You are already dead.
---
How is IQ better at destroying it then other ops, she lost her frags (RIP) a while back
---
Thank you I've been practicing for a while

Use her shotgun and just wait for people to get close to you. Also just do custom matches and run around the map to get map knowledge

Wait, that’s illegal

Oh and then they vote to kick the guy who was last alive too.

That's the magic of the game lol, I like having a chance even in a 1v5

I would look at ur vertical and ADS tho, I see ur recoiled control is a bit off, lowering them could help. Maybe 80 vertical and 35 ADS just try it out and tell me how you like it

No thats different. You don't always get free alpha packs. It's a one time thing thar they give to players that they usually pay for. That's a gift. If you're never paying for attachments anymore in the first place what are they gifting you?

Hello KingC3M, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bc9eyd/why_blitz_is_op_and_shouldnt_be_in_the_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Okay, the thing is that fifth of the operators already counter him, even hibana can destroy his evil eye in most situations. I don’t think his evil eye is too much of a problem. If he’s watching a softwall, you can easily counter him by just having someone stand in front of the evil eye, blocking line of sight. Not that you’d want to, I’m just showing how easy to counter he is. The reason he’s so powerful is because he requires thinking. He’s like a smart buck, a smart buck will play vertical and open up lines of sight to hold smart angles. Maestros the same way, his lmg is to pretty bad with its random recoil spread. The best way I’ve seen maestro be played is to use his evil eyes as obstacles by ticking down attacker’s health and catching them off guard. He’s not powerful like ash, where she just has good guns and is really fast. Most people just set them up off site and sit on them the whole game, or at least people below plat. He does need a small nerf, but thatcher is already a pretty highly picked operator, nowhere near as much as ash or bandit, but neither is maestro. And strategy wise he’s only really good on a few maps, mainly ones with site that have connecting softwalls that lead outside. But with ash being one of the most picked ops, she already will almost always be the one to destroy the evil eye. I really think he needs to either have long range capability or short range capability. His lmg is insane up close, and his evil eye is extremely punishing at long ranges where his evil eye is harder to hit. He can easily half you in a few seconds at any range. I just don’t understand why he can now theoretically be countered by *Every* operator. I’d rather have thatcher just destroy the eye itself. But maybe I’m wrong, I’ve just always felt like maestro was in the same boat as echo with them both needing intelligence to show mastery in usage of both operators. Sorry for the rant but I just really like maestro!

they’ve said before they can’t because of data limits. not because they’re ToO lAzY. don’t act like you know what you’re talking about when you don’t

I mean they did mess it up in the clip didnt they?

its the worst :/ and it never stops

Yeah in a year maybe. Ubisoft apparently thinks its A-OK to have a twitch drone kill evileyes by themselves at range.

Yah, I've tried restarting matchmaking. I didn't try restarting the game. I'm not sure if that would have helped.

I do have steam

As a Maestro main and Italian, it *hurts*. It **hurts** as hell seing Maestro being nerfed.

Why Ubi? Why my brother Maetrso? Blood of my blood... He did nothin g wrong, he didnmt hurt anybody. Yet, he got nerfed

I wish they had that long of a story for everyone

Look at second hand gear if you want a GTX1080. Game seems to hog a lot of VRAM so if anything get a decent VRAM card like 10GB or more.
---
That's not possible. It would only be disabled for 2 seconds which is not really enough for Thatcher. Unless the disabling effect is different for Thatcher and Twitch.

Blitz was fun to play as and required skill back then. Nowadays if I ever play blitz in ranked it unleashes a hailstorm of "toxic" op choices

F in chat for us maestro mains. Look how they massacred my boy. Jokes aside but WHY. His gun and gadget is strong i get it. But its not like maverick who doesn't have a counter or anything. Currently on the live servers, ash, zofia, sledge, maverick, anyone with frag grenades, hibana depending on the evil eye spot, twitch and thatcher disables it for 10 seconds. If they really had to nerf him, they could have just added 5sec or so to the disabled time. If this patch goes through to live servers, twitch can destroy both evil eyes just during prep phase. Imma be full on honest, im disappointed for nerfing an operator who is picked just a bit above average according to their designer graphs and this is not the route to nerf him, should have been a last resort if he was like completely over powered.
---
Sorry for the long post but \*sigh\* its just so dumb on how they're nerfing him.
---
I still have nightmares from a secure area match with a 45 minute round because you could get under the stairs and still secure. That and all the goddamned plant spots where you can defuse. That and the spawnpeeks. That and no roam clear.

Those guys are bad

Hope you were a P90 guy, because you are now.
---
I'm actually ok with Thatcer being able to counter it, but twitch I am not. The best placements for evil eyes are off site, where it is far more safe for twitch drones to roam around. Also you have more range sure... if you are constantly on your camera the whole round (which is also not the best idea). Twitch puts herself in no danger either to take out an evil eye, which thatcher would.

Use kontrol freek you'll be faster, I not care about if they used K&amp;M because I feel no different maybe he's fast when they use the drop shot 🤓

---
They have 2 data analyst, it has been mentioned few times in different interviews
---
The hot breach podcast that had epi as an quest went in to detail how they approach balancing.
---
Community complains about operator and how they will go and look all of the available data sources, so that they could identify the underlying problem rather then simple symptom of one
---
Ubisoft did release huge data dump at one point (can't remember how long ago)
---
So you were being annoying and got team killed makes sense
---
The 5! Horsemen of the apocalypse vs Frost? Seems legit if you ask me
---
A Ryzen will do, vga I’d go min 1070 on 1080p
---
Fr lmao. I try to enjoy his content but he cries too much about very mundane things.
---
I love that they put the logo on the small side.
---
Excuse me what the fuck?
---
I bet you tk for no reason.
---
Nerf's so nice you say it twice
---
Wow!
---
Lol we really need that 7 second defuse timer
---
Isn’t frost one of the operators the dev team said the could explain why the get pickt that much in some season and in others nearly never?  I think Kapkan was also one of them ....
---
Pretty neat detail, yeah
---
Mine is for the ump45
---
Posted here about 60 times. Beaten to death.
---
Exactly, everyone I seem to play with seem to be butthurt jerks
---
Oh, I specifically searched for it and couldn't find naything
---
Is Jesus dead?
---
That right there is the 7 level of hell coming together...
---
🤠🤠 me2
---
So thats why the art seems so familiar.
---
jesus man what the hell is your sens
---
that's mainly because of input method. still it doesn't make console players irrelevant for ubis balancing when there are so many of them
---
If you balance for trash your game will be trash is all I'm saying
---
whenever I play blitz, the flashy thing never blinds my enemy. ;-;
---
I have heard about trick shots. But this is a different league.
---
A third time would has been useful

A well placed piece of duct tape will see you right.

Hello KingC3M, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bcap7w/why_blitz_is_op_and_shouldnt_be_in_the_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
i don't understand why people think this is such a problem. i play this game everyday &amp; have mained almost everyone @ some point &amp; IQ's AUG positioning never once fucked me over.
---
kinda looks like mnk tbh
---
Jeez you don’t have to brag about it with everyone
---
Considering that the Spectre can detect Mute jammers, I highly doubt they can disrupt its signal to that extent.
---
I think they removed it at one point
---
It is mnk, i play r6s on pc and that doesn’t look like the sloppy movement i know from console (talking from experience) it looks like mnk.
---
i think they changed it back cause of smufs
---
how about we don't care and the mods didn't remove meme posts until now ?
---
Toxicity shall not be tolerated

HAHAAAAAA

They are just... asleep. There is a 10-hour window in mod activity... every goddamn day.

That's right 😅

They explained this years ago, just FYI.

I thought it was just me. Thank God

When did they remove this?

damnit knot a gain
---
What I'm getting from this comment thread is, you're bad because you ran out and died, it's all your fault, this game has terrible desync issues, oh and you shouldn't ran outside /s
---
you know it's spelled queue, right?
---
The lord takes many forms
---
The game thinks your 'win/loss ratio' for this season is comparable with those bots. If you haven't played a lot of matches this season the confidence range for your mmr will be huge. Same result if you had a bad week at the start of the season, it's harder to climb later than earlier (it's also harder to fall later)
---
What
---
The fuck 
---
Does this mean
---
Smokes already a good operator, and while you may not agree, I think his fmg-9 is better than the smg-11, and it always has been.
---
Damn risky as hell playin Bomb on Xbox every time I play Bomb it’s all mouse and key boards warriors lol
---
Actually, in IRL, it really depends. I prefer Red Dots for my IRL real weapons. Part of why Red Dots work so great is that the color Red is a low-frequency color. That means it doesn't blind you or cause distortion with night vision. Red light doesn't distort your visions or awareness. So Red Dots are perfectly visible without impairing your ability to see in the overall darkness. 
---
Green has a higher frequency than Red, but it's not as much as Blue. So Green is "Brighter" than Red, but it also has only a slightly marginal impact on vision. As a result, Green Dot sights are perfectly good for daytime usage. I have found one shortcoming of Green dots, and that's when I'm using one in the woods. Literally everything is colored green, so my Green Dot starts to blend in with the environment. 
---
So, IRL, it's a matter of "Mission" and preference. Red dots are dine. So are Green dots. It's worth noting that most night sights are Green colored to the the Tritium used to illuminate them. But that's it's own topic because now we aren't talking about the color of Reflex Sights.
---
i dont know how many times i have to tell you that u dont know anything about this game😆
---
Yes it is I, The 200 year old man!
---
Maybe I'm just reading it wrong but *if* the overall attacker win rate went up more than Ash's win rate, the win delta should shrink right?
---
Ok mr can’t kill a blitz
---
Doc:**pulls revolver to his head* merde
---
Mr gold 1 i play against esl teams
---
I've been playing a lot of Maestro lately and in fairness there's late rounds where he's just mopping up. Well placed evil eyes, the alda and an ability to point the thing in the general direction of the enemy are about all you need. So he's probably too strong all right.
---
That said, F for the evil eyes in their former glory.
---
in EU and SEAS , yes it is
---
An image taken seconds before IQ wall-banged him by seeing his PDA from 5 meters away.

Buff Ela

When the prep phase ends and you hewr a shield.

*confused screaming*
---
Nah i like too sweat
---
You mistake disliking the 1SHS mechanic as the same as calling for its removal. I'm fine with it staying in Siege but all these stupid posts proclaiming the 1SHS mechanic is a brilliant mechanic with absolutely no faults is just moronic.
---
How are you gold 1 lmfao
---
You are right. I was only thinking on the rush strat, but the roam clear is very effective. However, you would probably want to remove jackal or dokk to add a thermite as you implied, so it wouldn't be that exact "cancer lineup" in the video and would arguably need more thought to accomplish it.
---
Aimpoint???
---
Did you know that there is a tachanka song, like a real Russian one, not fan made?
---
Not only that, why is it recorded with a phone when it could have been trimmed and uploaded straight.
---
If the only reason you're picking Twitch is for the F2 and she's still one of the highest picks with the best reward there's a problem.
---
Thank you for your opinion guys now I’m prob gonna get Mira or Maestro
---
Well I’m just gonna go now...
---
and everyone in it...
---
The was smooth af
---
But I thought blitz makes the game unplayable so how can you sweat
---
Tower is a museum right
---
Boink
---
thats better
---
hes german?
---
Thank you! I've never seen it used as it was intended, it's always trolling and griefing.
---
Post yours, mine isn’t even that good.
---
This is why i dont play ranked
---
Ive been trying to perfect this on bank.  Lol glad to see people use Nomad for this fuckery lol
---
Yeah, this is my personal experience. I didn't play against either literally at all for like 2-3 seasons then now I'm getting caught in traps constantly because I just don't look for them. I've genuinely thought that frost mats were just map pieces that didn't do anything then walk over because I completely forgot what they even looked like.
---
Where did i say he makes the game unplayable know ur facts before u write a comment ma guy
---
Dont play ranked easy
---
Chanka-san
---
EHL EHM GEE!
---
Well you complain about him so I’m guessing you saying he makes the game unplayable, but your thing “mysteriously” got removed so I couldn’t check
---
If you can keep him alive until the last minute or so of the round he is very strong.
---
If you know where they are coming from and have all 3 canisters left you can shut off their entry for a full 30 seconds, forcing them to come in another way or wait it out.
---
As for the SMG-11 I have started aiming low, the kick (on console anyway) should bring you up to about chest/head level by the end of your mag if you burst fire.
---
That’s gonna be a yikes from me
---
Maybe just coinsidence. Or maybe the new ops have just been bad against her
---
Players clipping through walls is nothing new though, it actually used to be worse on release.
---
Would have been better if it was match point. Ultimate fuck you to the team
---
Fack I read "hello little sluts"
---
Nur ein Mädel, Kollege
---
Fair point, didn’t consider that
---
Oh no
---
Ah, I see you're a fox woman of culture as well.
---
I like the alibi reveal a lot
---
Can confirm. Me vs 3 on the other team all huddled in the same room just waiting for me to rush; so I take my time and try to breach tactically. I keep getting chastised and yelled at to rush even though plenty of time left. I rush. I die instantly. Vote kick initiated.
---
No that wouldnt be fun i do all my art free hand
---
Lmfao
---
Bring Your Child To Work

Reminds me of the cat in the hat meme.
---
His head was probably clipping through the wall. Ignore the comments about desync.
---
Yeah and I drew his nose so he looks like a pig on accident
---
CoD Ash mains switched to Jackal en masse.
---
Thanks alot
---
I can't help but remember that Finka has a thing for Tachanka.
---
So if I love you that means you're a fag?

Yeah I’ve had that happen to me to.

And that's exactly why I stopped playing after Blood Orchid.

Rainbow six siege anime confirmed?!

Mira and Mozzie both have excellent automatic primary weapons though. Kaid's pistol is not that great after the nerfs, probably a better sidearm than Mira's shotgun, but not exactly a better sidearm than Mozzie's shotgun, although that's debatable if you can control the recoil on Kaid's pistol. With the total ammo of 61 for his TCSG12 the possibility of running out of ammo was already there just after making a rotation and some peek holes, with the ammo nerf you will be required to bring impacts for the rotation or another operator with a shotgun, OR you might get stuck with just the pistol if you survive the round for long enough.
---
If anything the max ammo for the TCSG12 was perfectly balanced, where you couldn't make insane site prep with it if you wanted to kill people using it (while surviving the round to the end), but you could do enough to make it work in a scenario, where no one else can do the prep. It's not a bad gun by no means, but the pickrate of TCSG12 is inflated, because of how bad the AUG is and the fact that it doesn't have an ACOG. It's also worth mentioning that Kaid's winrate delta is below 0% at the moment, so this nerf makes little sense, as his shotgun isn't annoying to play against like Clash with her old shield to weapon swap speed per say.
---
Unfortunately, we got Rainbow is Magic instead
---
I was killed by a nade
---
This would be so much fun
---
Doc all the way - his MP5 is 👌🏻
---
Any updates guys? I have been in this mess for months and the support doesn't have a fix for it they just reply with "currently investigating".
---
I'm not the only who thinks that would be a fun thing to do right?
---
Where is the link?

I know he hit the helmet.

Neither. Stop with those posts, you’re only adding to the rule-breaking spam.

wait, so you use third-party sites? Why you're using it? Or Is it Ubi itself use a third-party site to gain access to your account.

I used your app a lot when I had my old android phone. Is there going to be a iPhone app?

They will most likely have changed it for when ranked comes out of beta

Love ur work! I have one big issue with the rank-system.. i have played 14 games this season (i'm now silver 1 //last season gold 2) and i hav 2 AFKs and 4 people leaving the match (on my team) and we lost..of course^^ . so i deranked 6 times only because these lovely players...
---
R6Companion was removed by Google without any explanation. Apparently its been happening to a lot of Indie developers in the name of Associated developer. I honestly don't know what to do about this, It was not a copyright ban, just some random ban. To many many users who are looking for the app and wondering what happened, I have managed to upload a new version of the app in Play store. Check out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamerguide.android.r6tab
---
neither, Bandoc
---
Lol i really need to get back into rainbow i remember doing fun shit like this
---
He’s also on the same team. The recruit’s holding a grenade.

They're losing so naturally have to with this "strategy" in order to get a round and still can't even manage that
---
Go to the sub's home page, tap the three dots on the top right and select *change user flair*.
---
I swear Cav can get killed from downing 2 or 3 people, as it’s happened several times to me. I wasn’t the Cav of course, and it might just be them lagging out, but once the third man is down, the Cav is gone and the last recruit alive pulls out a nitro and starts teabagging
---
I think you will not be able to update the app. You can no longer find it in Play store. In the new app I have updated details for Mozzie, Gridlock and map Outbreak.
---
Oh ok cool then I will use my old phone for this app
---
Im about to get Jagers elite skin but I dont know if he's going to be nerfed again can someone give me some advice please?
---
What out of 9 people 2 was rude with him so it fine if he ruins the match? This logic is exactly the reason that I have not played a game without leavers in a month.
---
Fuze ma guy
---
#vaultblitz
---
I thought you meant when not in use by maestro and was like dafuq? but now I understand. seems fair to me
---
it’s really not, unless maestro tries to shoot you with it or places it carelessly.
---
I thought he was already reverted back to 1 spd. IMO the whole flash CD isn't going to do shit, you're done as soon you get flashed once. The 4 flashes that follow is just the Blitz playing with its food...
---
If anything i think the flash should fall off a bit closer and you should be able to outplay the flash, like turning away to not be blinded. Takes some serious mind games, timing and/or luck but at least there's something to give you a chance at winning in close quarters.
---
I don't understand what you mean by "too weak, like Nerfbeard". Is today "opposite day", because unless it changed in the week I haven't played, Blackbeard is one of, if not, THE best killing ops in the game.
---
We're gonna pretend you never said that
---
Tryhards..
---
Tachanka means machine gun cart in Russian and they were very popular with the people. So there was a song made about them.
---
Just a normal mechanical pencil
---
What a mad lad
---
My best guess is that they downed the hostage and your smoke killed it?
---
he isn’t countered by 3/4 of operators, it’s nothing near that. his main counters are zofia and ash, and then after that you have maverick, sledge, buck, finka. If the evil eye is placed behind an ads or two, none of them can do anything about it without using up all of their utility. Dokkaebi, Thatcher and Twitch aren’t hard counters since they can’t destroy it as of yet. 
---
Pair that with the indisputable best gun on defence and it makes the best overall operator on defence, so it only makes sense to buff his counters.
---
Look up “Tachanka song” on YouTube. It’s the first one, it should have a picture of a red man on a cart using a machine gun on a yellow background.
---
Still waiting on the F2000
---
With the amount of talent on this Earth, someone definitely could. So hopefully they see this and I can get it some day lol
---
Except if they destroy gadgets that open up sightlines for the enemy team. They're better off dead sometime for the good for the team.
---
&gt;A lot of times the evil eyes will be in places that you can't watch them
---
The contradiction is amazing.
---
turn it off in matchmaking preferences. I only have house on.
---
Those are some pretty harsh nerfs for a character that is statistically underperforming and the only compensation is a smoke grenade?
---
Thanks dude good sir next time ill mute them and honestly i think im going to call kids squeakers but im not going to be toxic and be a dickhead to young people. As long as they dont REEEE into their mic all game and be shit talkers all game anyway Thank you for the good wishes and good luck to you as well.
---
You mean like the turret watching them? Because idk if you've ever tried to shoot a twitch drone with one but it isn't easy
---
The good old days, I watched someone somehow run through two of them without dying the other day, no finka
---
but if he dies the cams are useless. i dont think hes pre lion op he doesnt need nerfed into the ground. there already is a power balance so
---
Yeah those big slow drones are much harder to hit than the normal ones.
---
I added you
---
but she’s just not though is she, it comes down to *so* many different factors why she has a high win delta. You can’t really believe frost is the best operator on defence unless you’re a bronze player
---
And whiners...
---
what, call you out for bullshitting or for being an idiot?
---
So you just want Maestro to be watching for twitch drones all round? What if you set them in the prep phase and she destroys both while you're reinforcing on site?
---
practically everybody has this issue you just kinda have to deal with it ranked is not worth it atm
---
And hackers.....
---
Let's be honest. They did it so the new defender next season wouldn't be totally redundant.
---
I know for a fact I could get both evil eyes without getting my drone destroyed
---
Then your game broke. I played a terrorist hunt game where i tried to kill as many people as possible with the zap. It takes a long time
---
&gt; So you just want Maestro to be watching for twitch drones all round?
---
Have I said that?
---
&gt;What if you set them in the prep phase and she destroys both while you're reinforcing on site?
---
Then you're a clown
---
Yep, done made him useless.
---
Oh great ignoring Tachanka again
---
look above using the evil eye , and they wont shoot it unless it's on the ground or placed lower on walls
---
Lol
---
Ok cool. I’ll as you when I get home tonight
---
the souls captured by recruit with his m870
---
Just because you match up with friends doesn’t mean you automatically win. That’s never how it worked in any competitive game and it sure as hell doesn’t work like that in this game.
---
It'll also leave you with no anmo and alert every single enemy to your presence.
---
Evil eyes can be easily destroyed by sledge
---
It was to the guy who didn't vote to kick.
---
A part of the placing of the evil eye is a place which will be easy to shoot enemies from (with the laser)
---
Lmao there's no way to automatically win. Playing with friends will help you not lose to things outside your control.
---
I don’t think he needed the nerf honestly. He had many counters already and this is kind of overkill.
---
they deserv it!
---
Is mozzie fr getting a rework tho?
---
Can you please leave, if you are here for being toxic and rude against everyone, just leave. If you read other comments, other people like theses so just stfu and leave.
---
The presence part is annoying but could lead to some fun strays where someone flanks while the other breaks that hatch, but when you’ve got 401 bullets total, I don’t think ammo is a problem
---
I'm stuck in gold
---
Did they get rid of Twitch's ACOG smh
---
Yes but now you dont even need sledge. You just need Twitch
---
3 months? But according to the other commenter he had this issue for more than half a year. Is this confirmed that this will get a fix?
---
Thats some incredible shading too do with machanical pencil
---
casual is for learning maps and aim training. comp is where you learn strategies
---
have you ever watched pro league? it's pure strategy
---
G2 don’t care about pro league anymore. They are a lot more focused on tournaments that give a lot more money to the winners. They’re “saving strats”
---
oh fuck i forgot he was 8hp
---
hmMMMMmmm
---
Ranked has a different learning curve to Casual. If you have map knowledge and have come to terms with the mechanics of the game you will probably learn a lot more from Ranked.
---
Just don't go near it if you aren't going to take it somewhat serious, it completely ruins the experience for those trying to. Your mic and communication is your best friend.
---
Life Is Strange plus Rainbow Six Siege = this
---
I like that about the Frost Elite, it’s like a little nerf to her because the mats are easier to spot
---
"Esl ready"
---
Also has like 68 dmg / shot.
---
It counters breaching as a hole, it just conveniently counters Maverick as well, as he falls in that pool of a breacher. Interestingly, it doesn’t actually stop a breach, just stops you getting to the wall, so hibana is a counter to this gadget. It also counters Thermite a little, and would increase the importance of Twitch’s drone and IQ to get rid of it. It is a simple, weaker alternative to wall denial, that wouldn’t negatively affect the game in any way in my opinion. 
---
Doesn’t mean I’m right though, just my opinion
---
Give Frost her deployable shield back plz &amp; thx ^.^

you're silver, you have no idea how powerful he is

Shes fine, shes not overpowered. People just get pissy about globals but if we nerf her over and over shes gonna be useless. shes in a good state just chill

It would be a pretty interesting mechanic actually 😂

Some of us roaming fools don’t even get on cams except for right when prep phase ends lol
---
Have you seen the context?
---
That last part...it hurt me...
---
Grow up
---
Soooo... casual?
---
This happens to me a lot. I'm not sure what causes it, but I might have a fix that can help. Whenever it happens now my friends just let me know that they can’t hear me at the start of the round so i just alt tab into discord and it starts to work again for no apparent reason. Even when I go back into siege it works fine but as soon as the next round starts I have to tab in and out again. Hopefully this fix works for you too.
---
Actually, you don't even need to open the wall there. You can place it on the visa vending machine and it will see the 3 hatches and the entry to visa and spiral stairs. I've been using that spot for months. 
---
Though it has a clearer line of sight your way, the opened wall won't give away that something's up, so it might go unnoticed more.
---
I also recommend a black eye in the same spot.
---
I take Casual pretty serious, and it seems like im the only one in the world that will use callouts in Casual, Ill give it a try.
---
I mean this always happen to me in ranked ;-;
---
Shit... now you win.... you sont next time 👺
---
Cause you Frost baby;)
---
He's having a bad day. We all do from time to time.
---
Through Nvidia Geforce :)
---
It happens to all of us. Casual is nowadays more serious than ranked lmao
---
Casual. if this is added people wont use it what do you think the point of trolling is
---
Ya but they can't change anything else in the matchmaking to keep those people out of ranked. Those people exist purely to troll other people's ranked games so they would select whichever had the most people try-harding
---
And ash mains.....
---
Honestly I don’t think it’s gonna be that big deal
---
I believe it did, but the pistol did not have a thread to attach on
---
&gt;	We are looking into reducing the amount of frustration generated by Blitz
---
How about a 2 speed shield op doesn’t get an instant kill melee.
---
Serious?
---
Oof haha
---
Maestro is too strong right now and adding 2 more counters isn’t the end of the world, he’ll be fine. Anti gadget operators should have a way of destroying his gadget. And getting a thatcher to use up an emp on a eye rather than a important wall or doorway/window is a fair resource trade. Even if Twitch can destroy it with 2 shocks, that’s still twice as much as any other gadget takes. Plus Maestro can still have a chance to destroy the twitch drone with the eye if he can spot it before it gets close, there’s a little counter play there too.
---
Really good! Have you done Frost or my boy Buck Daniels? Sorry i'm Canadian.
---
The way he just crumpled is the best lmao
---
Thats what im trying to get people to do not instantly mute us but give us a chance and see if we're being dickheads in REEEing into their mics. I also get annoying kids and its a pain, they scream like hell and get triggered and start caling you the whole dictionary and curse out at everything you do, just realise that not every squeaker is obnoxious and some of us are actually mature enough to not get muted of the bat

Being annoying in ranked, so with this ubi can filter out those people
---
What is your rank right now?
---
fine, four shots then. still statistically the best gun on defence by a country mile
---
IQ mains we out here

Remember no console

pretty sure its an exhibit about the tower itself

Hello xBecxPrimeEvilx, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bcf0va/r6_shotgun_no_damage/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Oh ):
---
How is his LMG?
---
My main problem with the nerf is the twitch one because 1 twitch drone can destroy both evil eyes. Plus i see people saying ahit like jusy put it higher but that doesnt matter with twitch
---
Or cargo shorts in a literally frozen yatch
---
Ah you caught me, just my best story of beating a diamond with Mnk recently...LAST TIME
---
So to explain what I'm showing in the video:
---
When you go to display tab, You'll see the Video Memory changes when changing the resolution from (1366x768 59.79 Hz) to (1366x768 59.94 Hz) even though it is the same resolution and the thing is if you change it to (1600x900 59.94 Hz) you'll see it has the same video memory as the previous one even though it is a bigger resolution. The game became blurry after the latest patch because my monitor supports (1366x768 59.94 Hz) not (59.79 Hz) so that explains that the game has a bug that it shows you're on (1366x768 59.94 Hz) but on reality you're on (1600x900 59.94 Hz) . I discovered that this was the reason of the game being blurry yesterday. Upvote it pls !
---
yes, put him on bb.
---
no it’s mérida
---
When in silent step you do reduced damage
---
*Cries in 90% alpha pack*
---
How has this uniform not been created...New outbreak? alien invasion.
---
if any one of you sick fucks even THINKS about doing what i know you're gonna do...
---
Great, has an acog too. Want to go for headshots though as it has a decent bit of recoil.
---
lol If youre diamond you should definitly stop paying peoole to boost you, diamond that cant handle blitz is literally less worth than a tachanka
---
I agree, but I’m more concerned about smoke win rate being so low
---
Ahh yes we like that here
---
I agree he needed a nerf but they went to far with the twitch one
---
Agreed, I feel like a second shock should just disable it further or something. Destroying it is a little much. I guess it’s kind of like Mira, though. He’ll have to actually defend his evil eyes.
---
Isnt this witchhunting?
---
This is why love Ubi
---
"Oooo piece of candy"
---
Bless you
---
Can you get the glacier xkins from alpha packs?
---
uoy sselB
---
Especially in high ranks, it’s complete cancer.
---
Last question. What is the best strategy for him and the evil eye.
---
*sad up song starts playing*
---
Honestly wish he was just slower but stayed a 2 armor. A 3 armor tanky Blitz sprinting at you slowly is just as frustrating, just in a different way.
---
He had to lure them into a false sense of security lol
---
Vote to Kick 1/4
---
I don't play him that much, but I can get into that mindset easily enough
---
Did you ever figure out what was wrong? Is it just Siege or is it multiple games?
---
Watch pro league matches or look up YouTube tips and tricks
---
Echo is at 0.0 win delta and has an average pick rate.
---
*Perfectly balanced, as all things should be*
---
You could make it available if they get a specific number of negetiv points
---
I agree. People take ranked far too serious if they think a slightly unbalanced map isn't good enough for them. A pro league team can take advantage of the 1% advantage the attackers have on a certain map, us no names will be fine.
---
I think his gadget is part of it,  but we have to remember the fact that he has (IMO) the second best defender weapon on a 3-speed. I agree we need another defender who can deal with projectiles but that’s not the only thing keeping jager so popular.

Read the lore. 🤷‍♂️
---
What if castle had a fucking war cry that gave his team a 50+ hp boost for the rest of the match?
---
And the bullies report him and he died like a hero
---
Exactly
---
Some people prefer controllers. If I ever do get a PC, I’ll honestly plug my PS4 controller to it &amp; use it. I’ve been using extremely high sensitivity for three years &amp; I can keep up with the MnK users that I am forced to go against in Plat. It’s probably the fact that I’ve held a PlayStation controller in my hand since I was five which was 13 years ago, so I’m just extremely comfortable with them.
---
No. These cartoons are retarded.
---
When will this patch be released?
---
In Apex Legends you can go from 70 to 110 and it won't lower your fps
---
Or it means that vigil, ela and alibi need to become more appealing so that we'll see something other than Jäger in a fragging roamer role.
---
I somehow doubt that Jäger's 70% pick rate is caused entirely by his ADS. A lot of people just pick him for the carbine.
---
:(
---
Well I’d see it as harder to know where the hitbox is in general
---
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
---
# YES!!!
---
Damn you got him good
---
I would have gone with all traps + Tachanka but I like this too
---
I already tried messing with the .ini but still nothing, at first i thought it was for the 1366x768 resolution only but i found someone who has 1600x900 and still has the problem. So i really dont know whats causing it
---
Yeah but still he's still op for everyone else. He really only had one counter and he needs more.
---
Shooting them?
---
It's new this season, I think, but you're definitely not the first person to post it.
---
Got my first Legendary in months last night, it was the Buck Wild skin for the ACS12.  :(
---
Holy shit
---
I think a selfish alternative to Jager as in only he is immune to projectiles (hopefully the new rumoured USSS op) may be the only answer to the Jager problem
---
\&gt; plays a part
---
This is the most important part of what you said though. The Devs have said multiple times that this is not the only resource they use for balancing changes. And even beyond that everyone is just assuming Jaeger is going to get nerfed. We've heard nothing mentioned about him by the dev team, nor are they ignorant of the fact that he is the only anti-grenade operator.
---
Elite skin confirmed

Gagarin's space suit would be better.. with those large nostalgic "CCCP" letters on the helmet.

Still the best run out gun in the game don't @ me
---
Mozzie with the classic 0 IQ play
---
Most of the legendaries are garbage so how about just no dupes and maybe a bit more percent per win
---
Bandit with that T pose 😂😂
---
New defending operator:
---
Name: UNO
---
Gadget: Reverse Card
---
When gadget is deployed, whatever projectile is thrown into a window or door frame gets sent back out at the attacker.
---
No it’s not wtf
---
Looks like toy's story
---
Get rekt Blackbeard player
---
With the upcoming Glaz changes though I feel like these two ops will counter each other pretty evenly.

Mute&gt;

Excuse me WTF?

Use less ammo cut a hole
---
Oh 
---
I'll delete the post then
---
Nobody:
---
T-Pose Bandit: T
---
So it is possible! Maybe they will actually update situations now.
---
Nope, division is an original concept and story. They put his name on the games for marketing.
---
I don’t laugh I piss my pants and hide because the boys are back
---
you're putting words into my mouth, I literally just said twice that I never claimed they shouldn't have an opinion. I'm saying that yes, someone who has more experience and plays at a more competitive level has more validity to their opinion, is that really so hard to understand?
---
What's the problem with using Skype?
---
Don't worry, they aren't alone. I also prefer Skype over Discord.

I'd be down with a progression-based unlock system.

Give me a ping Vasily. One ping only please.
---
Everyone has problems with Skype apparently  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Playing ranked just to hear "It's just a game bruh", my fav
---
Yeah it is, I believe some of the operators names come from the book, but I can’t remember who. Also a different version of pulses device is demonstrated, and smokes gas takes part as well. Very interesting book, and many of the characters take part in other parts of the series at well, so I highly suggest reading them!
---
I heard once that his jaw is so sharp and hard he was able to cut diamonds with it. 
---
In all seriousness, I emailed him when I was 12 or something about how his work inspired me. Dude actually replied back. I was floored. He even corrected my spelling. I was mortified but grateful.
---
That’s fair, I kinda meant in the sense that it requires attackers to throw their nades, etc at the ADS. But I suppose that’s a good point. It’s nice to have the passive utility
---
Absolutely not. I want op operator mode top
---
Still not your stuff so idk
---
What the fuck is this thread? Also half of yall don't even know who he is but play all the Ubisoft games?
---
Why are you even asking this switch already 😂
---
He has a 7 second flash cooldown now
---
GIVE ACOG TO SMOKE’S GAS GRENADES
---
The games with his name are based off of his books. Like siege and the division
---
Agree.
---
Yes and that doesn’t fix any of the problems with him. He still sucks to play as and will be annoying to fight against regardless of the cooldown
---
The 5.7 is a better choice. The PMM just has such a high damage that it's far better than the GSH. The real crime was using an smg on plane when a shotgun is available
---
I don’t think it has anything to do with him. Pretty sure the story is new, and Red Storm only did gun design, so he probably had nearly zero impact on the game (besides maybe inspiration from some other works of his).
---
young sexy father
---
Could you imagine how fucking bright the night would be in a rural area if this is what it would look like in suburban?
---
This was a casual match and we were a 5 man premade so no worries :)
---
Then a theme park shortly after.
---
What I usually do is place them where people usually back up into.
---
Why do you say Japanese people need region lock? Suck up the fact that you're losing
---
Yesss this is what I did when I read it and it made the experience so much better. Being able to see who was where definitely increased immersion in the story
---
I once heard from Varsity or KingGeorge (I don't really remember), that all the operators will have their different versions. A great example - Kaid and Bandit. One can Trick and be deployed on 4 different surfaces, also has a great gun and can be a roamer, other is a choice for those who want to use his gadget at the right moment and throw it from a distance.
---
I mean, Ubisoft will just have to do these things. I personally hate getting naded, so playing Yäger is the play. So, all in all, you are goddamn right buddy.
---
I remember after about a year or so of playing siege and Division, I got pretty used to the name Tom Clancy. One day, I was looking in the bookshelf in my dad’s room and found those books. Never knew until then
---
Young Sexy Father
---
It was taunting you with how slow it rolled down

All the movies, all the games are based on his work.

Rest In Peace. I’ve read through every Jack Ryan book in anticipation of reading Rainbow Six. I’m currently halfway through Executive Orders. Once I finish this one, I’m finally on to Rainbow Six! Thank you for the great books and for everything else, Mr. Clancy.
---
Nice work! Do one for the FBI
---
i would like to see a console graph but not low ranks
---
I actually got to meet him. I struck up a conversation with him in the concourse of the club level at an Oriole's game and he invited us into the owners box. It was awesome.
---
Details are exactly my thing, so sounds good to me
---
The ones who walks with his own
---
I’ve read most of the Jack Ryan stuff, and realized about a week ago that I had skipped Red Storm Rising because of this. 150 pages in right now and holy god it’s good
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUK
---
casual
---
Then, we will have to develop strats to counter this. Mira and kapkan players lose their gadget to Twitch in one hit. The good players adjust and either wait until the drone is dead or unable to come after the gadget. Mute is the best counter to protect your evil eye. This nerf is not the end of the world. My team has an *impact the shock drone on sight* doctrine where one or two players actively hunt drones and reinforce outlying walls/hatches. There are always methods to protect your gadget. 
---
As echo says, "efficiency is clever laziness."
---
I say, "plan to fail and learn to adjust."
---
Fucking this. That was the book that got me into Clancy. Started off slow that first chapter, but I read it all in a day, I was so hooked on the story. Definitely think a mini-series would be great.
---
*"BRO WHO THE FUCK PLAYS LION AND DOKKABEI?! THIS IS META ABUSE"*
---
and then at the end of every training session
---
"*gg ez*"
---
That sounds *really* fucking creepy even with context.
---
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN THHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEE ASSSSSSSSSSS

Learn how to use paragraphs before posting.
---
This was mentioned in a class I recently took on gravity and magnetics. He apparently got flagged when he mentioned that the Red October used gravimetry to navigate. In reality, the US Navy at the time *actually used* gravimeters so they had to have a word with him. 
---
We geeked out in class for an hour on how a submarine could use gravity gradients to navigate, which only made me want to reread the book.
---
Ubisoft owns the name Tom Clancy when referring to digital media, IIRC.
---
*Ding crouch-spams wildly*
---
That's awesome! Only ever heard great things about him.
---
Woulda expected you to be in favor of American ops with that wall of text you built there.
---
Can confirm he emailed back to fans, he told me when I was around the same age that Sam Fisher was loosely based on John Clark.
---
The one with the shield. Always.
---
I mean they did make clear and present danger into a pretty decent movie which is also a pretty convoluted plot with numerous pieces and characters.  
---
That said it would also have made a great series, particularly reset time wise to be occurring in present day in the current political climate, with the US media looking at Latin/South America again, it would be a nice little updated or nuanced version of this story
---
"This movie is so unrealistic"
---
*Reads his actual history*
---
"Okay what the fuck"
---
no but i want them to add a shield operator who can actually burst through walls like that for his ability, imagine the fun on house 1v1s
---
or someone with explosives rigged to the shield
---
Congratulations this is now my favorite look for smoke and it looks like what happens when Smoke shares some drugs with Bandito

A shield op able to bash forwards........ Brigitte
---
I'm like halfway trough. It tells the story of Rainbow Six, an international anti terrorists unit. Main Characters are cool, Rainbow Six is ex FBI or something and the members of the team are pretty interesting too. It's a nice military thriller.
---
Ubisoft needs to take some serious time and play their own god damn game before fucking it up for everyone else. There are serious issues with the game (desync, hitreg, performance, just to name a few) and operator balance is 100% not one of them right now.
---
You don't need to read a Tom Clancy book to like Ubisoft games, you gatekeeping bag of foreskins. Especially when you consider that only a small part of games created and published by Ubisoft actually have any affiliation with Tom Clancy and even then it's only surface level like marketing/narrative foundation.
---
Go back to /r/books with your elitist trash. Literally anyone with 2 years of free time and the patience to read several paragraphs detailing the ins and outs of air to surface missile ordinance can read a Tom Clancy book. You're not special.
---
no excuse for that

He took the time to reply to fan emails, which has to count for something.

He’d be rolling in his grave if he knew how Ubisoft was making a alternate version of Rainbow to bow down to Chinese authoritarian censorship.

Is the Ghost Recon franchise based on the books? I have no idea.

ok how the fuck am i supposed to know that someone has dyslexia
---
and I think you're just trying to mess with me now wtf a nazi?
---
had to check road map again for myself i was like wait what XD, Nigerian flag is white and green
---
Thats a so common bug at rainbow six siege. You need to restart game.
---
I don't believe that chart. The numbers are definitely made up. I know this because Tachanka is at the bottom. If the numbers were real, he'd have a 100% win rate.
---
Unless it's being perpetrated by the the United States' imperialist war machine, his dick was rock hard for that shit.
---
ok thx👍
---
Idk why they just cant give you a code to put in and redeem it like that. They have to make things extra complicated. Also any news on twitch prime uniforms by chance?
---
I know, I was being cheeky.
---
That's what the test server is, all of this was tested and they decided it was a bad idea.
---
I clearly staited it earlier and the nazis were fascist like you

Has he written any new books lately?
---
yeah, but i said niger, not nigeria, they're different countries
---
when
---
Oh. Idk there are just so many dumbasses in this comment section that don’t even know who he is or what he had to do with the game so
---
That's why they don't change him....

Just posted the Operation Dust Line controller!

so you think people with a lower rank shouldn't have an opinion. wow so about 80% of the r6 community shouldnt have an opinion if they are gold or below. incredibly fascist of you. And for you saying about my spelling i have dyslexia

you said that after I commented on your spelling

Threat vector, first I read
---
And you still said it nazi
---
While the original team/book did indeed have a “Doc”, it’s not Doc actually from the game. That being said, while not a pacifist, the in-game biography for Doc shows that he does place a very high value on human life and prefers not to kill anybody if possible.
---
Oof
---
*plays sad music* fuck me bro...
---
what? so?
---
I mentioned your spelling before you claimed to have dyslexia

u a nazi

But that was a long time ago, I think it should be done again for the public to decide with the way the game has evolved

No u

Sorry but going pro is not as easy as you seem to think, you can’t just say you want to and expect people to pick you up. To go pro you’re going to need a great team, qualify for cl, grind many experienced teams to make it to pro league, and not to mention being really good at the game. Considering your rank and situation, you are far from pl.
---
They don’t have IQ or Rook :( I’ll take a Ela tho

That's a start. Also, try warming up with t hunt and switching up playstyle. Not to be that guy but newcomers have it better now than ever with the newcomer playlist and stuff

Personally I hate tower more than skyscraper. But I can definitely agree with you on favela
---
While we can debate the literary quality of his writing I think most would agree Clancy’s the undisputed king of the military techno-thriller. Even six years after his death I’d struggle to name another writer who even approaches his legacy in that field.
---
The other thing that strikes me is how phenomenal he was at the business of writing. The man turned his name into a brand that spans novels, spinoff books, author partnerships, movies, video games, and tv shows. It’s an elite club of authors that have achieved that kind of success.
---
Should be more like Overwatch's system for staying as a team
---
Please do
---
Very true.
---
Jackal will remain strong IMHO, unless we have a fake Jackal 2.0 wannabe. He cuts the time to hunt roamers in half on maps with super strong roam strats. Those extra 60 seconds you can get by not having to hunt roamers is insane.
---
Made me giggle

I love favelas.  So many wood walls to destroy.

Yes get the deluxe definitely worth it

Yeah, the UI as a whole needs updating tbh

Why does everyone have to copycat the top post for easy karma like shit dude have some dignity

Funhaus managed to kill Carrie Fisher AND Chyna.

I thought mute was a three speed for a while :shrug:
---
1) You shouldn''t leave just becouse you don't like those maps.
---
2) I really don't remamber witch map was Favelas.
---
3) Skyscraper has a lot of potential if you play it right. It is not a rushing map thats for sure but in most positions and right reinforcing you can get angles that look to windovs and doors.
---
In attcak skysxraper might be frustrating against spawnpeekers but normally thr positions and entry points make it a challange and an equal ground for both sides.
---
4) What i am trying to say is that if you take your time in attack and reinforce right in defence skyscraper is a good map to play in.
---
You: *Calling me toxic*
---
Also you: *writes a long paragraph about how I deserve to be in silver and how I’m probably bad.*
---
Tower is 10 times better than Skyscraper. 
---
Skyscraper is just runouts and spawnkills and in general just chaotic while Tower is slow paced and tactical like Siege should be.
---
r/siegebob
---
The characters aren't the same. The Team Rainbow seen in the book are OG Rainbow. They even appeared in the games until Vegas. The Siege team is completely brand new. But yeah, some of gadgets like the heartbeat sensor stem from the book. I appreciate Ubi kinda bringing Rainbow back to its roots.
---
Yes fool
---
1 year is 1 year and within that year are 4 seasons consisting of new content such as ops, map, events, cosmetics etc...
---
Siege is so much better after you have read the book. You feel more connected and understand everything better. Hereford Base especially is fun to play because you imagine characters like Ding from the book fighting at your side.
---
Thanks for the magic Tom!
---
Happy Birthday

It happens to everyone else as well. You have 1 in 5 chance of it happening just like everyone on the enemy team.

They're honestly solid all around. Each one of them has a clear purpose in the meta and are easily distinguishable by their gas masks, which are all cool as hell in the first place.
---
I'll try it, thanks for the comment. Favela is the map where it looks trashy and complicated, from operation skull rain.

It is eight operators correct? So that would be way more then $10 I would assume.

How are they beefing him

Could 9?

A great author and a decent man. In the first few days after 9-11 Mr Clancy was being interviewed (probably because of the plot line of one of his books) and he was the first voice of reason asking that people remember that extremists do not represent all Muslim people. A true class act.

but I do think full diamonds Vs full P2 is abit to much, maybe if you had a play 1 and they had at least 1 plat 2 it would be fair
---
What's "legit gold"? I thought all ranks were legitimate...
---
Well he'd still be a badass either way so it could be worse. But still lame
---
Nice thanks
---
Tagged my friend because he plays smoke or at least used to
---
No lol; but the top guy on the other team
---
Boosting was using keyboard and was super toxic because I killed him every time and it just made my day.
---
That would make sense I guess. So Kanal would favour attackers and Tower defenders maybe?
---
Thx bro
---
Used a controller not MnK
---
rip tho
---
It's my birthday too, but that's not important.

He is just standing there...menacingly!
---
Yeah, but *why* are they two of the worst maps? Don't need an essay, just a quick explanation.
---
Idk what to say other than look and listen closer
---
What makes him the best? Sure he’s good but he isn’t amazing. His traps are countered by looking and punish rushers. And Monty can run right through, countering Kaplan
---
It took us 4 years to find this...
---
tru and my main changes pretty frequently, I don't really have one
---
Pretty sure that everyone in that lobby thought you were hacking
---
Zofia because of the withstand and her weapons + the ability to flash
---
People are telling me to make it into a cosmonaut instead of an astronaut which makes total sense and will as more soviet stuff. I might make one in the future
---
El chapo's house
---
But still play correctly and shields aren't a problem.
---
They will tho. With next season pick&amp;ban will be introduced into ranked. Also they'll redivide the ranks ( https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousAlluringLEDRiPepperonis )
---
Yep 😝
---
I’ve been kicked for holding an angle AS AN ANCHOR as in one of the key things anchors do
