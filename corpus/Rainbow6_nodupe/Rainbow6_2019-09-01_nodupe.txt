True, I just don’t want to have another gadget needed into eternity

Nah black ice is pretty cool, I'm talking about black ive
---
What about odd job as a three speed one armor and a pee shooter
---
Youve probaly aready did this but you can change the ram it uses from 2 to the amount you have it personally boosted my fps with mods from 10 to 300
---
I’m from England, but why the fuck did I change my accent 🤣

I want the pee ice named “tastes like lemon”
---
*Thomas was pissed because he had never seen such bullshit in his life*

Ok call of duty pap camos
---
Omg is this copper? They didn’t reinforce the hatch and had no idea where you were coming from LOL
---
I love xbone
---
You should be able to mute yourself or talk, but I think it would help because people usually hide away in discord or Xbox parties and avoid communication which is necessary in a game like R6.
---
Am I the only one who'll think about about the Key and Peele sketch whenever someone mentioned black ice
---
I can totally dig it
---
The top one should be called blood ice
---
if you mean minecraft, i already did, highest was 10 GB, i have 16,but the shader plus our server is fucking with me
---
:)
---
The bottom 2 look dope dude
---
Honestly, Ive done alot of these up to the point where I choose the throw the game by going thermite, planting the defuser on a hatch and blow up said hatch if there was a bomb in the trophy room

Nice

This looks a lot like mnk. Are u using it
---
Interesting...
---
Lol we already have Amethyst and Emerald, which looks very similar to black ice, but the bottom one looks liiit like that Ash that somehow didn't die.
---
pulse and castle's ump is great, capitao's smg is nice, but i prefer his lmg

She’s dodging the bullets!

No, I’m coming from thousands of hours on ps4 and I’ve recently switched to Xbox to play with my friends
---
Nearly all spawn kills are easily to counter, as you learn where they come from, if you come to expect them, it put the defender at more of a risk than you as a attacker. 
---
I hated spawn kills when I started playing, would rant and moan everytime I died from it, more experience I had in game the less I died from then, and killed them in return, the one thing that taught me how to spawn kill, was simply by learning to spawn kill, if you know what LOS are used for the spawn kills, and what places you can do run outs from, and also pre broken ground floor windows to open during prep to run back in 
---
There has been a few unfair spawn kills, unfair meaning the attacker has no time to react, have been removed or are as easy as learning now to spawn on that spawn point. 
---
Siege has a steep steep learning curve to start with, exspecially if you playing against players who are already experienced
---
The bulletproof camera is what really makes it
---
Attack: Radar- a hand held device he looks at and it will show a small dot on his device when someone moves but can not defend himself and the device has to cycle back before another ping. 
---
Defense: Ping- Ping has a small device that she can put on doors and windows that allows her to tell which direction enemies are coming from.

he panicked so hard
---
I would play pulse his gun is pretty similar but his gadget is much better
---
Yeah, but we don't know the price and content yet.
---
I got $20 that’s says you made a smurf account and went into newcomer or casual to shit on players trying it out for the free weekend. Seen these “ace” videos too often already this weekend

Idk but it seems youre too young to even play the game

Ubi: Introduces a system with the potential for more (**free** and paid) cosmetics that are obtainable simply by playing the game when players have been asking for a way to earn cosmetics by playing  
---
Community: Stop monetising the game and copying more popular games  
---
Also Ubi: Doesn't add a training area which will probably need to replace a map rework in order to have the manpower to create  
---
Community: Why don't they listen to us?

That's not the only season to not get a new map. There wasn't even special events in every season back then like there are now, literally the only thing a "full dedicated season" was then was a map(sometimes), 2 ops, and a mid season patch. Like I said, your only argument is it hurt you feelings. Get the fuck over yourself.
---
They are in the next season they said they were taking more actions against them
---
Thanks, it took a while so that means a lot

We shouldn't let it die, but holy shit people need to stop using it for like 3 months and have a limit to how many times the meme can happen a day, because it is a goodish meme when it came out.

There's 2 in the game and both are trash conpared to the other primary weapon(s) available to their respective operators.

Expanding on your idea maybe you can randomize where the targets appear in the range, and even go so far as to add friendly targets that add time if you hit them to try and encourage you to id what you're shooting at. You could also create different maps for the range. This could reduce the ability to remember where targets are, but at that point ubisoft should just improve T-Hunt rather than making a shooting range.
---
Now NOW ABSOLUTELY I love this skin
---
Thank you, now I’m going to delete this pointless post haha

You can’t say it’s a set amount with absolutely no proof...

How do you farm it?

this wasn't me, that's some other low level randomly killing 3 other guys

Does it help you during multiplayer?

Absolutely stunning

I’m more interested about the Apple justice left on the ground

Should have got black ice
---
This looks amazing, original, and very well balanced truly! Definitely would be a hard class to play and totally would be banned in rank in higher levels due to his quick on the fly changing ability, honestly I could Ubi doing something like this as they could easily add assets maybe from other guns to it? Since that stock could form from zofia’s gun, and the stock from maverick, or another AR. Just wonder how his bullets would be like since all guns used a different amount, and how his movement would be with all that ammo on him and gear.
---
I've set my dpi really high and then spun and it was the same when as I had normal dpi. I just don't know the exact amount

Good for you I'm glad you're still doing something you enjoy while being a parent
---
Looks dope man love it your excited about the elite OH YOUE SHOULD TOTALLY TRY THE ELITE NEXT no rush just sounds cool awesome job man
---
Funny I had an operator idea for this, you could detach the light to stick it in shelves all walls to make blind spots and make it hard for enemies to tell if you were there or not
---
nope sadly
---
Yeah like I said the MW2 approach to a shooting range is the best idea if there was going to be one. I get the feeling a course like that would be narrow so even having random spots wouldn’t be enough if there’s only two spots to pick from. The course would probably have to be longer to account for that. A time trial like format is the only way I could see this work and even then I still think an improved T-Hunt would be far better.
---
That’s what I’m trying to do. Figure out the amount so the sensitivity is the same when proned. I just need some numbers so I can do math.
---
Damn, I love the middle and bottom ones, this is awesome!
---
BIG BRAIN
---
Yeah, ive had this idea before. Its a good idea but honestly it should just be a mechanic in the game. I do enjoy your idea tho
---
No? MMR is watered down in TS
---
Nøkk is decent, a copy &amp; paste of Vigil minus the jammies I guess, Warden is just a slightly different version of Ying if you take away her candela and don't move to use her shades to not get affected by visual obstructions.
---
What's happening to my map?
---
Being removed from map rotation
---
In my opinion it's not worth it, you would need a ton of desk space to turn around once
---
Already did, reported to Microsoft and r6. Now it's just the waiting game.

Is kaid getting an acog for his aug?

of course. This is Xbox right? Add me @Redeagle482

Removing the best map in the game? wtf ubi

---
Oh thank you!
---
Wtf I just noticed you were on console. That's better than my aim, and I'm on PC...
---
Nope because Ubi doesn't believe in cross saves
---
Hm, interesting tactic, but I would not care that much to be honest
---
It's alright, Thanks anyway

Nat type 3 doesn’t lee you connect to games of that kind.  You’ll need to be on Nat 2 at least.

T hunt is a shitty mode filled with about 60 bots with aimhacks and suicide bombers that can take up to 7 headshots. A headshot has a 40x multiplier. Only go in with a full squad or in public. Solo only if you want to test a new load out
---
Where’s maverick
---
&gt;and third two other operators specialize in stopping reinforced walls being broken, them being Kaid and Bandit
---
Neither of them in the team lineup. 
---
I rarely play Mute but if I'm ever in a situation where I have spare jammers I'll often do stuff like this. Is it easily countered? Of course Thatcher and Twitch will definitely screw me over (and to an extent IQ, Maverick and virtually everyone with frags). But in the off chance they're dead or not picked at all, it's one less wall I need to defend. 
---
So yeah, while I see your point I wouldn't say it's "wrong". There's arguably better or more meta ways of doing this specific job, and perhaps Mute may have been better used in another way but he is a very versatile operator and this would be a perfectly valid tactic...
---
( ... although obviously, this Mute was a bit silly here using so many jammers on the one wall. Room for improvement there!)
---
Do you know what operator stat means? I have over 1,000 with hibana
---
Sorta
---
Just go on settings on the dashboard, got to button assignments and you can change your controller controls there. And why does it matter? You can’t even crouch spam anymore.

Bottom looks like it's about to rob me of my balance
---
While it was better than the other special events, Outbreak still had the same problem as the later ones, and it was that with such a limited operator lineup, and the critical path and objectives being the same every time, the mode became stale by the end of its cycle.
---
The team that made Outbreak was actually training themselves to make a new game, so Id hope Rainbow Six Quarantine will be a much better experience now that we did the Pre-Alpha test lol. Also explains why all the other events are much smaller in scope in comparison.
---
Don’t try to flex an ace on here when you’re cheating using a mouse and keyboard on console. Garbage.
---
Thank you ^^
---
I honestly despise people that ruin the game for everyone else. Especially the newbies that just wanna play.
---
Ok, gotcha 👍🏻

No problem

Just use the fucking Goliath.

Dang, don’t try, or rather hope you’ll get it and maybe you’ll get it.
---
Clash without a team is just a bullet magnet. With one she's fine. But the FO-12 statistically even with the extended barrel does lower damage at CQC and long ranges than any other shotgun that's a primary. It only exceeds other shotguns at mid range damage numbers as it's one of the only shotguns to have a set mid range fall off range. The French semi auto shotgun has almost identical numbers for damage per pellet at ranges if all shells land 1 pellet at least. Which for buckshot in the game is very generous as the shotguns have a set range to where the pellets can go before derendering. At least to my knowledge.
---
Thanos-ice!
---
No, no ... this was quite helpful I thought MMR adjustment work a different way ... Thanks for your clarification, for real.
---
Not at all. But I think he was saying that all other content drops were not close to as significant as a shooting range would be, therefore they'd never put in the effort to make a shooting range.
---
Epic
---
Yeah I see.. I have a question, I was thinking wouldn't they have more finished games if that was so? Then I thought if they just left before the match was over they would get a abandoned penalty on their account stopping them from matching for some time. Seems inefficient.
---
I like the idea, but it would need to be either a fat drone and be slow, or be really weak, like 50 damage at most,
---
I would buy
---
Anyone know when the new season launches?
---
Yeah. Only in ranked though.
---
It's not that impressive but I'm still proud
---
Guess I don't please explain
---
Go to ps4 settings&lt;accesibillity&lt;custom controls
---
No, I don't main, but when I do play him:
---
Attack: GSG9 with M870 with smokes+frags
---
Defend: GSG9 with M870 with nitro
---
True
---
I'd say this is impressive, my first ace was on favela and they were all on one the rooftops (level 8 rook mp5 acog)
---
Umm what platform can you play recruit in ranked
---
Good choice. I run the badger build: red dot, angled, suppressor on commando 9.
---
The scope alone is the reason why
---
So... You peek here often?
---
You can look at their profiles and check their friends list
---
Welcome to siege, the game where some people are so confident that they kick everyone they can
---
Never eat the yellow snow
---
Thanks. Still an ace which is not easy to accomplish
---
Nice, there's a high chance they'll reuse that gun on a new op too since it's underused with Ash mains I think.
---
Combo it with my idea for the laser now, the ability to turn it on and off
---
Stupid idea
---
Monty is on the FBI’s most wanted list for molestion of an entire special forces by ‘clapping them cheeks’
---
Inefficient kinda, but how else can they lose mmr, as you said this guy plays on multiple regions and so does the friends likely and so they won’t have enough players to surrender and so must leave
---
I have this charm
---
There’s a lot of problems with pf but the skin system is amazing.
---
Your right about that, they are hard. I started a little bit before Phantom Sight and I have only gotten 5 aces over my lifetime
---
I use m870 on defense and random weapon on attack so m870 defense is something I can respect
---
What happens when you pop it!
---
When you say with cameras what do you mean?

I wouldn't exactly consider using the auto trace tool in illustrator as drawing...

Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
That's better. I hope your socks come out of the dryer wet when you're in a rush to leave.
---
Nice work! Looks amazing and was quite enjoyable.
---
Are you and your party usually carrying your randoms? Or do you naturally play well altogether?
---
This 21:9 resolution is beautiful, thank you

I swear i saw this from the sniped guys perspective

i hope you trynna eat ur microwave food but the middle is still cold as fuck
---
Every company during pride month
---
Honestly don't know. Can't find them anywhere.
---
It’s definitely overrated, yes, it’s better in many circumstances, but not always.
---
Imma be honest with you champ in my opinion this looks horrid
---
Kaid snuck into armory and swiped an acog
---
Gregor &lt;3
---
dont trat this like it's call of duty rushing in blindly will more often then not get you killed, take it slow and watch your corners
---
I’m just comparing quick peeking animations from the standard game and the TTS. I agree, but it’s an extremely useful skill to have in this game. I’d rather quick peek to bait out shots and spot enemy locations than wide peek the unknown and die immediately.
---
3rd and lat one are amazing
---
Hey, PS4 here. Youre not alone! Queing takes a long time because of the low amount of people in the server, especially mid day on weekdays. Try queing for WJA, it takes one minute to find a match and its only around 50-60 ping.
---
If you wanna know how to use different servers on console, go to custom game. Press the option “online”. Then create a playlist name it whatever you want it doesnt matter. Click on the data center and change it to WJA, and without exiting, go to edit playlist and save your changes. Voila! You have changed data centers for one match! When you exit and go to ranked or casual, you will be queing in WJA. After each game, if you wish to play in another data center again, simply edit the playlist you already made, save it, then boom you have another game in another data center. Hope it helps!

Thank you! Bad news is I think I'm hooked on making cosplays.
---
It will actually take a lot to make her "too strong" overall. She is currently a 2 Speed with a weak gun and no utility. 
---
While Nokk's gun is the most noticeable issue, her fundamental problem lies in the fact that her stealth is underwhelming and can easily be replaced by IQ who can take out hidden cams/drones/gun mines to help her entire team avoid the Defender intels. Nokk simply doesn't offer anything really new when her quiet aspect is not much better than 3 Speed Attackers crouch walking around. 
---
I also suggested in making her 3 Speed and the reason is that it can make her offer something more unique than the other 3 Speed Attackers just with this change. She will be able to be played much more aggressively by being able to re-position herself quickly and quietly than the other 3 Speed Attackers in general. It could justify her having a weak gun and having no utility for the team to benefit. It would emphasize her solo play style and strengthen her stealth aspect all without buffing her firepower. 
---
Especially since she's currently only better in terms of flanking/re-positioning when compared to the other 2 Speed Attackers but not when compared to the 3 Speed Attackers who also have their own utilities to help out the team. 
---
Ubi's fear of Nokk being OP seemed justifiable but I think they went too far. Their own data ironically showed her being the second worst Attacker and having a very low pick rate despite being new. With Glaz buffed and Amaru coming soon, Nokk can easily be buried and forgotten in her current state.

It would be the greatest feature to exist in the game. I would pay pro league players to use my account to get me packs just so I can have fun zipper time
---
I have never (and I mean NEVER) played Warden or Nøkk in Ranked. 
---
They’re both fun Operators to mess around with in newcomer occasionally or just shit Stratton Casual but both are way too weak and underwhelming to play a useful role on a team in Ranked.

Questions:
---
Which platform(s)?
---
Do you need a full team, or are there gonna be 1v1s, 2v2s, etc?
---
Do you need discord to participate?
---
While your point on the term "overpowered" is reasonable, we did have two absolutely overpowered operators in the past and one of them broke the meta just by himself and had 100% pick rate in pro games. 
---
It also doesn't change the fact that ppl will pick the most efficient operators in team comp and neither the nerfed Glaz nor Tachanka are that. No one in general picks Glaz just to have the highlight and almost every other Defenders benefit several times more by having a good comms and cam usage than Tachanka ever will. It's not that Tachanka is not good in 1 vs 5 situation when that basically applies to everyone pretty much. But Tachaka (and Warden) is the only Defender who doesn't help out the team efficiently enough to ever justify in being picked. 
---
It's similar to how Nokk's job can very easily be taken over by IQ who not only finds the hidden cams and drones but also many other things that could hinder her teammates while having much stronger guns than Nokk. 
---
There's a good reason when certain operators have both low pick and low win rate.
---
I know someone who looks like vigil

This post is so underrated

Did she lose a finger?

Don’t get mad over not being able to locate based off sound, it will come with time, lot of my friends get mad when I can tell where enemy’s are, cause I can hear them, it will come, just got to wait.
---
Pc, full teams and at least one member needs to have discord as to make it convenient to set up!
---
Kapkan Trap which shoots a robe that bulls the attacker on the ground so he has to free himself
---
Proximity Castle Barricades 
---
Spider Drone which can either crawl/jump up walls to position a sneaky attack camera or/and shoot a stick web which can block Black Mirrors for some time or deactivate ads / Kapkan traps etc. It would take some time to shoot the web so defender would have time to locate the drone and the net would be based on water so it would disappear after 20-30sek. It would look a little bit like Mozzis pests
---
So in other words, not for me, not for me, and not for me 😞
---
Yeah
---
So many people complain about bb, and if you really think he is so broken, why don’t you use him when you’re on attack? You aren’t being cheated because if you really think that he is the difference between winning and losing a round, you should use him while attacking, because if he is in fact “broken”, then you should have no problem winning all three of your attack rounds with him.

Omg the pouch that has a face carried over into the cosplay
---
Sorry mate... It's 70% off on steam Right now!
---
Good luck, and most importantly *have fun*! I'm still pretty new to the game myself, but I'll pass on some info that the people who got *me* into Siege gave me.
---
1. Play a *lot* of Terrorist Hunt to improve your aim and help you gain confidence!
---
2. Leaning is key!
---
3. Try not to run a lot- too much noise and doesn't really benefit you.
---
4. Aim. **Aim.** ***Aim.*** This one took me a bit to get into my thick skull because I'd never played a shooter before. XD
---
5. Just have fun and learn! It takes a bit- but you'll find your groove eventually!
---
I'm always game for playing with other new players, so if you ever wanna play, I'm ClickFactori on Uplay! Happy gaming! :D
---
*Bandit want to know your location*
---
the wild ela main in it's natural habitat. *Toxicity.*
---
Thank you kind sir
---
They're trying so hard too
---
LOL sensitivity x100
---
Just not worth the pick over the other operators. 
---
Do I have fun with Nokk? Yes. 
---
Is she worth picking over someone like IQ in Rank games? No.
---
Click on your name and click add tag
---
Right, but also how you mentioned there's never a justifiable reason to pick warden, if you know they will use glad w/ smokes, ying rush, or blitz rush that would probably be the only reason
---
Another thing to mention is how there's going to be alit of gadget swapping happening next season, as well

Are good PC's 70% off too?

Gotta love when everyone decides to rush instead of being smart
---
Nice I got c8 f2 mp7 super 90 smg 11 m59(sas shotgun) 9x pmm gsh 18 ump45 and m10 shotgun
---
😂 I wish I need one too!
---
That’s really sexy
---
Underrated comment
---
tag yourself I’m all the ops that died
---
Many people don't seem to understand that if you play with just ONE friend it almost completely prevents this
---
That actually looks good
---
Cool beans
---
That is actually amazing! Chimera was the best operation I have played in my opinion. Where did you get it? I may just get it for myself...
---
I think that it shouldn't be a attachment, I think in casual there could be black out maps where all the lights are off and it's night and all ops could have this flashlight on their firearm.
---
Great call outs too.
---
Yeah ik but all my friends that play siege dont play bec its too hard lol
---
The more ranked you play and if you keep winning and losing back and forth you start gaining less and less elo
---
Dokkaebi... 😭   But out of those three, I’ll say Ela or Black Beard, both still have great guns though.   As for Lion, I’d say his ability still seems useful when used carefully.
---
Too hard? They just bad bruh. Whats ur rank?
---
Baked beans
---
It is frustrating but you can find one person to play with or if they start to to you or keep voting to kick just leave
---
Lol like gold 1
---
"Free weekend"
---
That actually looks dope as fuck
---
Uh cool glaz edit
---
Thanks for the advice
---
There was a glitch where u repeatedly hot breach jumped into a window w/out blowing the charge and it made u invisible and invincible while rappelling or something.
---
It depends on how many games you’ve played, I’ve played about 100 and I’m getting around 30-40 ELO
---
bottom one is actually dope though
---
Whats ur timezone?
---
He tried to spawnpeek his own son.
---
that's actually awesome
---
Level 85 still no black ice and my level 36 friend got bucks ar and smg 1 already :(
---
Surprised u don't laser sight with those attachments
---
What fucking idiots. Why give up the advantage of you having to go to them? I'm not saying they would have won but it would have made things more difficult for you.
---
Central daylight time you bout to ddos me lol?(im in u.s its 12:47 texas)
---
American school bois before cleaning up their room
---
Lmao
---
It's a bullshit tactic.
---
5 players create smurf accounts. They throw ranked matches together in order to obtain shit ranks. One or two guys switch to their main account while the others continue to smurf. Main accounts obtain high ranks while never having to play against evenly matched enemies.
---
I have that as mine. It’s amazing
---
Forgot to clean up after the match
---
The brightness.. the lag.. the actual play itself.. this entire video makes me sad hahah
---
Y tf would i ddos you? Im tryna see if we would be able to play with each other
---
Looks like a ending credits screen
---
Lol i was playing
---
Bruh
---
## bruh 😡😤😂💀😂
---
Depends.
---
Blitz is still silly. He's fair enough. Fuze is underpowered.
---
Monty though, when fully extended, he's invincible to a degree where he WILL WIN a 1v1 AT ALL TIMES unless he is a sh*t monty. That's why pros call clash the "most balanced shield".
---
Nazeebo frogs for the win
---
No you haven't told me that one... Go on...
---
That’s what my boy was sayin
---
I remember my friend shit talked the gun for so long then he got stuck with it for one round and it's now the best shotgun to him.
---
And after the 600 Ms ads nerf, yes even more self contradictory.
---
He's right.
---
They need to make all plants in game bright red and give enemys the same outlines as team mates!!! How is it fair that kapkan can go prone in a pot plant and be completely invisible?! 
---
I'm pretty sad about how plain the game looks now. All we needed was an under-barrel leaf blower. https://youtu.be/sl6KJj10Iac?t=466
---
Nope lol
---
Isn't that basically a limit? Haha. But regarding the duration, how long do we have to wait? Because whenever I search, everyone (Reddit, Ubi forums, Steam) is saying 50k in 24 hours.
---
Theyre unfun to play against yes. Broken? I dont think so
---
&gt;I always start a game with a nice " How are you all today?"
---
Wish I could play with you. So wholesome.
---
P90 and MP5 suggestion is mostly just based on having ACOG on Warden. Though if he becomes 2 Speed, I guess it won't really matter.
---
You can do that? Good because I main Fuze and already realised that those two don't belong together
---
Phantom Sight erasure
---
It's basically for that mode as I said, people used to abuse and changer to that limit, other modes have no cap.
---
so confused, I bought the game recently and started out with 6 ops, is that not intended
---
Yeah there is a lot of smurfs in newcomer. Also the queueing time is extremely long.
---
I dont think ive been kicked out of a game solo for 6 months. People exadurate this so much
---
He is ded
---
I'll give him a test drive
---
I got one at lvl 70 for the GIGN shotgun, fucking worthless
---
Or if they choose to keep his lackluster ability and buff only his guns, they can make him 2 speed, give him the p90, keep the acog, take away the smg12 cause we don't want that on an acog'd roamer, take away the impacts and shield and give him something less powerful.
---
Might be off balance, but I'd like to test this on TTS first.
---
Rather unfortunate that he has been banned.
---
Looks good
---
Map knowledge and game sense are the biggest factors in getting better, there's no one way to get good, it takes time and practice

You kidding me? Doc and Rooks primary has trash DPS, them with ACOG doesnt mean it’s op. If a Doc or 
---
Rook kills you it means they were the better player
---
Ideally, you should get it back because it invalidates the entire match.
---
On a brief side note, hats off to you heroes for getting rid of the scum!
---
Which server?
---
Same reason its on steam and not exclusive to uplay. Its to reach a wider audience and give more choice, therefore more money
---
the fuck
---
in war, no one wins
---
Yeah make targets that randomly crouch, lean, sometimes drop on the ground have conpletely random movements and force the players to do the same things at the same time to reproduce real game effect. Do you know any game with with like that? Because without it it will be just glorified shooting range where ppl will delude themselves that they can get better. In every game, where they added shooting range under the pressure feom the playerbase, like PUBG you see those guys who spent hours on the range and think that they now mastered recoil and ecerything whiff every shot during an actual match. The better solution is practising your reaction time and precision on flicks with aimbooster.
---
Thankfully they kept it to just the r4c. Wouid hate to see it gone from the para or the m4.
---
Maybe i am having bad luck but i am kicked from more solo casual matches than i finish
---
Yes,i have a pretty good understanding of the maps except for the new kafe and maybe outback ,game sense is a tough one that i would say im getting back slowly ,i do watch you tubers like flanked and varsity so i guess i do look into stuff.thnx for reply
---
They tried but they can't. Sony and Microsoft have  to something..

Imagine Ubisoft giving us something we want.

So this is the power of Ultra Instinct

---
No matter what, the entire match gets invalidated if there was a hacker in the lobby. Doesn't matter if you had them on your team or if they were on the other team or if you lost or won. That's why it's always better to throw as much as possible if there's a hacker in the lobby.
---

I used to main IQ and then gradually stopped. A couple days ago I got black ice for the commando and bought IQs elite the same day it's a good match.
---
I think she still needs a nerf. Her Hitbox is so messed up sometimes. Twitch‘s F2 got nerfed last season cause of her pick rate, now she is picked significantly less. Ash‘s might be way higher so why doesn‘t she get another nerf?
---
Same rules as reinforcements. My favourite trick is to immediately replace a castle after its been destroyed just to confuse people.
---
Bandit gave him drugs
---
I actually wouldnt mind this if it was an occasional thing. We dont always need the same ol animations.
---
*what’s good pinhead*
---
Nah, the fire bolt would've completely blocked off the right side wall from bandit, allowing for a quick breach
---
Capitao/Maverick is the easiest way to counter this.
---
If someone practices a frag lineup, you can get a kill from outside.
---
Yeah I was not enjoying this match one bit lol
---
This reminds me of the movie Contact

Are you sure because a different person posted this before you

Do you believe in gravity?

Try BFV
---
They just have to let the ability work while he's crouch walking and it's golden. An ability that only works when being still or when moving paaaaaaaaingully slow is going to be awful no matter what it
---
Because everyone that plays this game is an angel and that won’t ever be abused.

I remember that once I was playing with 4 friends, we camped in a room far away from the objective while one of us played knife only. He aced

I actually did [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b3hwea/this_is_how_a_flashlight_at_least_in_my_mind/) 5 months ago and people did not like the idea
---
Im Sorry but is anybody else annoyed by the free weeks cause i had to steal 30 Euros from my brother and now its free but come on
---
It’s called DDoS’ing, and is s federal crime, look it up if you want more info.
---
Anyway, people do it to easily climb and use it as a crutch because everyone knows, when you’re getting shit on in a video game, go boot up the ol’ laptop and commit a federal crime so your ego doesn’t get hurt!
---
But seriously, this has been a problem for over a year on console, Ubi doesn’t care about it, they’ve made that clear with not even buying the highest tier of Battleye lol.
---
Sad but oh well, I just go play COD or GTA when it happens. 🤷‍♀️
---
Just get 10 people together?
---
I play verry agrivse on both defense and attack i usally go 3-2 speed operators i play on pc to but my biggest problem is that i win and win and win but never rank up its really weird
---
How do you think I feel
---
I dont blame my team beacuse they never do something wrong expect die 
---
some times
---
I have ascended son,and it is my time to leave
---
Still cool to have both
---
This is an good idea for mvp screen
---
Tyy i feel abit better now
---
I have friends but they dont wanna play they just sit and mow in casual and its so boring
---
well, they are cowards;)
---
Good idea
---
Cant find 1
---
I have friends and decent aim but no one wants to play ranked only casual
---
How do you get those?
---
Blitz and caveira
---
IQ in need of a solid piping
---
The one from the wild west event
---
Yea
---
I have this black ice but I run the shotgun so yah...
---
I’m honestly fed up with the free weekend
---
Are you on PC or console
---
I suggest you find some more friends to play ranked with and then you can also play with your other friends in casual.
---
If you are on PC then I can help u out and we can do some ranked if u want
---
Vigil in the background: HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
you tried lower settings?
---
Cav should get a headgear without any makeup but a hot af face, i would buy that....
---
it's called "Free Week".
---
I doubt Ubi will give her a different gun. Which means that there are few ways to buff her:
---
1. Make her 3 Speed. 
---
2. Slightly buff FMG. Enough to make Nokk feels better but not enough to surpass SMG 11 so that it won't really be considered as a buff to Smoke overall. 
---
3. Make her gadget last longer. Add extra seconds (3 at least?) so she can be stealthy more. 
---
4. Take away the hard counters like Mozzie and Echo who can render her stealth near useless. 
---
5. Allow her to bypass traps like gu mines and barbed wires. 
---
Any of those can work to certain degree.
---
Looks more like it used to be right?
---
well jackal has a overall great ar quick reload high rate of fire he has a underrated pistol and a secondary shotgun his primary smg is also really powerful as well however if you want to play competently with jackal well rip because he is the most constantly banned operator on every single game 
---
maverick his ar is average but the one thing major thing i hate about it is the low ammo pool (reserve bullets) i tend to run completely out of ammo every couple of games his gadget is pretty gud tho his ar15 is powerful but since the mag caps at 10 with one up the spout if you dont pay attention you will run out of ammo but that is mitigated by its quick reload his pistol is also average but if you want to play ranked youre in luck he still does get banned but not on the scale of jackal i dont know it depends if you want to play competitively
---
Shit that might be me
---
Lion dok finka Jackal blitz 
---
Defenders I don't care about.. let's nerf maestro though.
---
I just wish u could toggle the laser sights on and off in game...
---
That name though...
---
Not "Elsbieta". Her name is Elżbieta
---
What's your ads and deadzones? I tried 72/72 with 55 ads, it was pretty good on ranked but still not perfect for me. And could I know your rank if you don't mind me asking. I'd love to try out your sensitivity if you're confident that you have very good recoil control :)
---
The dos and don'ts of this post is more useful than above
---
The 417 is probably the worst dmr in the game and her f2 is or at least was one of the best guns in the game
---
You can actually still go there.
---
The lightning is painful as well
---
Hi Rogue-9 I just subtitled your video, I did it in brazilian portuguese and I hope you like it (I know you probably wont understand) and I really want to keep doing it with the next videos, but ofcourse with your permission! Really like your channel and I want to help it to grow
---
may have lost some muscle memory bro but when i got back from my break i played the shit out of terrorist hunt
---
just play some terrorist hunt before going into casual
---
Is this a suggestion or is it an official thing planned to happen soon?
---
Still way too high, ACOGs are only 2.5 and thats more than enough for 90% of the maps
---
Remove Lion because his whole concept is completely broken. Clash because her concept is quite annoying but caveira is also really stupid.
---
What causes that death?
---
i used to play competitively but not anymore because of the ban thing. so i think jackal it is
---
thx
---
my deadzone is lowest wich is 5% i believe and ads isss i have to Check ill tell you then it might be 60or smthn
---
im gold 4 but i play with plat 3-1 and im first or second on the leaderboard and cant get higher every season i get almost to plat and then i lose like 20games and after that i rise slowly
---
yeah i just used the f2 and it is pretty good , i’m just used to playing with semi autos in other games so that’s why i didn’t give f2 a try
---
I feel like Maestro is pretty well balanced. His LMG is really good but his gadget has so many ways to get destroyed that I don't see it as a real problem.
---
its my thoughts but still for new people all off this can help but yes i do agree
---
Same thing happened to me recently. Not sure what causes it, though...
---
Heu meoladiejxirenfic ctslgi3vvgfl3bofrr8fwbwUwUbushdid911bxkfnebdkdl
---
Why is smoke looking at his canister as if he is thinking of adding another chemical compound to add on his already deadly fumes.
---
Maybe add a mechanic where the eyes/screen adjusts to the brightness so that it doesn't last for a long time.
---
well when this event was added my game always crashed when i opened it soo.
---
Precisely that, you pretty much remained invincible while still rappelling, which made it pretty stupid of course.
---
I am one of the few to know what's actually in the canister
---
For siege you’re almost always going to be better off with an automatic weapon. And for the operator since you like playing aggressive you should probably try jackal and just hunt down the roamers
---
This is a suggestion
---
My god, that looks so much better. Her face actually looks really good now.  
---
Hope it's improved from the side, but the design and structure is way better now, eyebrows are really good too... This is such a good improvement.
---
I imagined it always on mostly because there aren't anymore buttons for console to toggle it on or off
---
They are only on the base ops, too much work after that i guess
---
Link?
---
😂
---
It it a good idea to get blackbeard and hibana with my 600 credits?
---
What did you said?
---
Beyblade beyblade let it rip
---
Hey, what platform do you play on? If ur on Xbox, I could help you out a bit.
---
Cmon, with thatcher its more like 15 pints
---
200 Lv Doc killed you and disconnected your controller. Be thankful he didn't delete siege.
---
I thought of that and it would be extremely cool
---
If they're the only ops you need, yes. If you have the Y4 pass you might be able to get Echo instead of bb since you get a small discount but
---
Thanks bud! :)
---
I just went deaf
---
Fastest ace ever is 0 seconds from first kill aka a nitro cell ace
---
Darth Thatcher the old
---
That does sound sick
---
*LUCK*
---
Is there any other operator apart from blackbeard of hibana worth getting for my 600 credits
---
I got 2 of them
---
Maybe make a super-realistic mode where no objective icons are shown and the game is played exactly how it would be seen in real life. I know this may make defending easier, but is a cool thought
---
The best beyblade is Burn Phoenix, 🚫🧢
---
Ping abuse is not a myth ON CONSOLES. Shit, when I play against high ping players, I constantly suck bc hitscan just don't work properly. I have proofs where I see an enemy and shoot him but he dies only seconds after bc bullets just don't register on them.
---
Which ops do you need
---
No u
---
Hey, do you play Xbox? I'm silver 4 and could help with that learning curve, as I've only really begun to begin experimenting with groups of operators and strategies, but I could help with fundamentals
---

No, because this would give an advantage to players with modded controllers that have extra buttons and people who use mouse and keyboard (both are banned)
---
If you were more than semiliterate I did say that for some reason it counted as a kill on the scoreboard which I didn’t pull up because I cut the clip down for Instagram- and the only unimpressive thing about this is your negative ass, grow the fuck up and let people enjoy the game.

Speaking of it, how would it even be snot, his nose would have to be too far apart? What is this abomination that apple made? 
---
It has come to my attention that apple made one poor kid motion track all of their emojis to make them.
---
His nose is now in the care of a foster family cause apple made him work 80 hours a week.
---
Stop nose abuse
---
They are both amazing defenders. Mira can counter rushing and echo can stop attackers from planting the bomb
---
I would personally go for Mira as I just love doing different mirror placements and peek enemies before they can even see me

Its to the point where im not even hyped over a legendary anymore. I've gotten maybe 3 i liked from over 20 legendaries.
---
I used to get teased alot by my 5 stack when the game released. Didn't know anyone irl but anyways, they all called me "Owen" because I'd go 0-2 or whatever constantly. I took a year away because lets face it siege at launch was a dumpster fire. I came back around the time Lesion was introduced. I played for awhile by myself for a season and one of them shot me a message asking if I wanted to play. It was the same team and they still called me Owen. I went 13-2 the first game and the the rest were at least 9 kills a game with no more than 4 deaths. The closest anyone got was 5-6. I'm not even good I just had the autistic rage of a thousand owens which cleared my head. I am no longer called Owen and I can only cum to the thought of that day

---
If they are caught, but since it is hard to prove it doesn’t happen often, but using them is blatant cheating/bullying as it costs a minimum of 100 dollars to buy just an adapter to trick your console, if you use one please stop because it is cheating and ruins the game for everyone else unless you have a disability where you can’t use a controller
---
I can't even tell that there was names, great job friend! I'm always amazed by people's Photoshop skills

Holy crap that's so good! Do acquire that skin only from lootboxes or can you buy it?

Ok but thats the challenge?

50 mobility, full damage, fire rate and magazine capacity bars? I know a few people who would love ashiad's gun.
---
looks exactly like if someone flipped the pose of someone drowning in GTA san andreas
---
Damn and you got to level 80 with only 1 Black Ice? As soon as started investing all my renown has into packs I got a black ice every 4-5 months or so, I guess you just had bad luck? :(
---
Yee...you could also do only headshots but with no limit on how many times you can shoot
---
Lmao I meant the clip oof

I'm here, what's the job- oh.. yeah, i have no clue you guys are on your own for this one.

There are so many cool pics... download the APP zedge

Yeah boi!!

Vigil for fun, Kaid for performance.

Maybe don't

So cool I’ve never seen someone get 2kills, also in a casual match!!1 
---
Good job!
---
Dude that’s literally what I am saying. Holy shit
---
Oh, that clip took place over 2 years? Damn years don’t feel as long as they used to

Seriously a lot of people on reddit annoy the fuck outta me. Especially spam downvoters...

I approve

The clips 2 year old, I do good England grammar yes

If the clip is 2 years old why is it on Reddit? You have a basic responsibility to protect minors from such things, I’m not angry, I’m disappointed

When does the new season start?

It asked politely after I left it to mature in a cave for 2 years

But it isn't a rifle. Regardless of real-world traits, it's still considered a submachine gun.

Everybody would disable this. It is needed in the game even though nobody likes it

In the next season the leaving penalty will start to stack up.
---
basically guns similar to: pdw9, spear .308, c7e, v308, and ar15

It doesn't anymore. They changed the rules around to prevent draws. In this situation defenders win now.

At what point was Warden ever meant to be a Jager alternative? Literally nothing he does is anti-projectile.

Ahh I gotcha. That makes sense

ohh yea nice idea

The loss of a camera is a pretty direct nerf.
---
Ok ive tried twitch but I dont have it
---
I've seen less than 5 mics in the last 2 seasons including ranked. Its really sad, I remember a few years ago everyone was doing callouts and talking shit, it was awesome

Perfect, thank you very much, just what I was after 😊

Believe me, it is. Definitely happened to me the other day on Xbox

Seasonal skins work for any weapons released up to that year. So a Year 1 Seasonal skin will only work for weapons released during or before Year 1. A year 4 seasonal skins won't work for any new weapons that may arrive in Year 5 or after, but will work with all weapons released up to now.

Do you think that's because his entire utility is meant for info and 1v1ing? Would that mean it makes more sense that he win? I didn't really have much problem in gold with monty. Not trying to say that you're wrong, just wondering if that's always true.

What happend the game looks like a shit post

Thank you

Oh shit it is retired huh, I just remember the dramatic finishes in morioh and the cairo buildings

I'm on PS4 too and it's free to download but not by r6s page shop

But by a r6s free week page shop or something like that

I know, I was just saying if Ubisoft were to do a series of nerfs on Lesion that would cause some of the community to complain, this is the idea I had.

LEARN THE MAPS. This is huge understanding wich walls should be reinforced and which should be destroyed this alone can be a big help. Call outs and where people spawn kill. For aim practice do terrorist hunt with rank maps to help with aim and map layout (on realistic).

That makes sense, I’m on Xbox and gameshare with my friend who also plays R6. Thanks!

You should spend all reknown on operators until you have all. I personally think that the year pass is worth it every year since you get acces to the new ops every season 1 week before people without year pass and you get then for free!

Even better!

Personally I think all surround sound in headphones is a gimmick at beast and a an active detriment at worst. If headphones have true 7.1 this means that they have more and smaller drivers rather than the two larger drivers you get from proper stereo headphones, resulting in less overall audio fidelity. 
---
I've never been crazy about the quality of sound from stereo headphones that have VSS, but some people swear by it. I personally find that as far as gaming applications go it reduces the clarity and accuracy of sounds.

If you have a pc. Mouse and keyboard, they have a decent advantage over us controller guys/girls.  Its hard. I play console but have mnk experience.
---
Actually, you're right, I'm terribly wrong. One's gotta know when they're, right? I just hope they end up bringing more variety to the game instead of just being greedy.

To be clear I do not know if he is dead or not and this is not me.

My thing on mouse and keyboard, if you want to adjust yourself on PC controls. Sure, use a keyboard. But, stay out of ranked while doing so. It’s annoying to deal with in casual, but it’s casual. In ranked, it’s to much of an advantage over others using a controller. I mean I can’t stop you, but if you have ever played ranked while someone has M&amp;K...it’s frustrating.
---
Sorry to hear. This is the most toxic game I've played. Great game, but toxicity can ruin it for me at times too.

Thank you 😁😁

Next season Caveira and Capitao should be 10k.

Ela,Lesion and Ying should be 15k.

Maverick and Clash should be 20k

Why would you ever re-peak that angle with an smg-11 when ur that far away lol.

Why throw two uncooked nades at one doorway and then rush the doorway? Cook it and throw it or throw it out. And don’t throw two at once. It won’t have more of an effect unless you get super lucky on the timing.
---
Two years ago I was asking myself the same question and was going to star playing with a controller when one of friends told me to try the PC controls, I was anxious to do bad at first, since it was my first PC game.
---
But boy, did it pay off
---
Mastering it will be technical of course, it won't come in one day, but in the long term, you'll be more precise, quicker on some things, and also be able to be at the same level as the other PC players.
---
One of the best advice I ever received and now, I hope it will help you too.
---
Hope you have fun and are able to find cool people to hang with like I did
---
Cheers
---
I mean, that wouldnt be too bad seeing as its on a 2shot single fire weapon
---
Yeah that’s always been my playstyle but I used to be the guy that would clutch up in the tight moments and now I’m either dying so fast or my teammates are and I get rushed like mad and just position myself badly.
---
The defender would need to melee (All) the windows twice for that to works and if the window are Visibly broken, it'll be as dangerous as putting a kapkan trap midmatch on an already broken window( I guess it's better to find an other entry point)
---
Nah ps4 my dude appreciate it though
---
Usually an uninstall and reinstall will fix these issues but if you've tried everything you probably tried that.
---
I think it was to keep them scared/frustrated so they would stay outside or be very unorganized if they ran in like headless chickens.
---
Toxicity in all games is rampant because games are like a microcosm of real life, which has always been full of toxicity. I don't understand why gamers are so surprised that humanity is garbage.
---
hence why ff should just be left alone.

The op screening would be A1. Some sap picks sledge and has to actually bust a wall on the first try. Ooooh 💋

YES. and no its not OP, mp5 with 30 rounds to headshot vs high recoil 2 shot semiauto.

Yes! I though the nails could pop out and hit the floor in an "Ping!, Ping!" kinda recognizable sound

---
Lesion for defense and gridlock if you want an attacker.
---
Nope, there’s an 84-round drum mag for the PM too.
---
Sure! So the way this device works is essentially the same way an RPG kills tanks. When it detonates, it burns a small hole in the armor, spraying molten armor fragments and explosive gas inside the armor,but leaving only a small hole. 
---
An easy example to picture is imagine if fuze stuck his device to a wall, and instead of pucks, it released a shotgun blast.
---
Quit playing and sell your game

u can say it after 500 hours

Bullshit. The pmm is perfect as it is
---
In Tarkov? What am I saying that’s crazy irl as well
---
Is that really new news though? I personally already have a love-hate relationship with R6
---
I was though i had my hand on my controller the whole time occasionally pressing buttons
---
To *install* the game you literally need anything
---
I think you just have to realize that this is a game, in the long run, it doesn't matter if you win or lose. Every time you die you are exposed to a situation where you can ask yourself, 'How could I have performed better?' I realized a while ago that I can learn from my mistakes, and it has helped me a lot (I'm obviously not the best player, but I'm better than I was). The only thing that matters is if you're having fun.

Jäger and Bandit would do anything for this
---
I have that one also and its great
---
Looks good!
---
Why does he need to be nerfed?
---
It would legit be a sniper rifle
---
Not doing that
---
A Blackbeard shield would suffice.
---
Give me 500 bucks and I’m down
---
Give it a skeleton key and I’m in
---
I could ask around with some people but idk
---
Attach a KS-79 and i’m in
---
Why did you vote no
---
Different CTU's different training? Nøkk's Jagerkorps training seems to have more of an emphasis on stealth and leaving no trace then Valk and BB's Seals training
---
Omg! Not all of the Pillar Men were killed.
---
Ok then
---
Congrats! One of my favorite guns to use.
---
His gadget is he can make the defender’s gadgets run away like his dad did
---
Because it's not fair he gets to automatically win half the fucking bomb site with literally zero counter, since Jager can't stop him anymore.
---
Pengu was talking about this in his latest video, it's fucking absurd how his firebolts are so insanely powerful yet have zero counter play.
---
He's also a 3 speed with an okay gun, meaning there's no reason to never not play him.
---
I've been maintaining a fork of r6maps, with the most recent version listed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cyeykj/r6maps_fork_now_updated_to_ember_rise) ([direct](https://github.com/purechaose/r6maps/releases/tag/4.3.1b)).

I did not see that lol
---
You should try Escape from Tarkov. 64rnd mag in the Mak is fun
---
Just submitted my app. I hope you guys are still accepting?
---
Don’t give them ideas
---
I'm probably gonna get banned for this but
---
Why would it be loud? And light wouldn't make you slow.
---
Yeah same
---
Give it a rook armor bag and I’m in
---
What
---
Sooo, when is this ever going to come to live servers?
---
I hope not I don't like the lmgs in this game either they have manageable recoil but the ads time is just so bad on most of themif we don't get the G36C can we at least get the normal g36. Also on your first point I agree but I agree from afar I'm not saying buff the gun I'm not I'm saying give it to someone that can actually use it. That's why I said give it to thermite cuz I hate his 556xi and the only other option I have is a shotgun not even a good one.
---
Still semi auto with big recoil tho.
---
When you're on the phone in a cartoon
---
Actually the banshee uses a radial blowback gas system while the UDP (pdw9) uses straight blowback. 
---
It’s different, unlike the guns ubi has been recycling the past several months
---
To avoid this bug you gotta knock off anything hanging on the wall before you put the window down, or it'll get stuck underneath. Learned this the hard way
---
I get that all the time on bank
---
Put a tachanka turret on it and I’m in
---
When I play ranked with my friends
---
The reloading is loud and slow which is a choice whether to reload his gadget or keep fighting every second counts in seige .also I know light wouldn’t make you slow but the gadget is like a continue flash bang when you get his by one in the game full force you are slower
---
Besides we have a technical test server why don't you just try out some of this shit there not like it's going to hurt anything it's literally the test server
---

Spittin dem facts
---
Horizontal 
---
I use 60V and 100H
---
But that's down to the player of course,
---
And make sure your ADS is a bit lower than your normal sens
---
r/softwaregore
---
Ah yes, the banshee. Proprietary gas system and all 
---
They could also use the Angstadt UDP9 integrally suppressed gun as well, however we already have the pdw 9 which is from Angstadt as well
---
It’s not bad but at least from what I remember of Irish folk lore banshees stalked 1 person at a time so maybe if you select a defender but asides from a flash bang /concussion grenade effect make it so they her things like windows breaking or foot steps
---
I just think idea needs some tweaking that's all.
---
Yeah but mira and ela are first so maybe she will be the 3rd
---
Cant wait to get ganged up on and stun locked.
---
Give it Blitz's flashlight and I'm in
---
I can already imagine trickshots with this setup
---
he emerges
---
I actually think it would be sick if they make a new pistol with a drum mag.
---
Im so close I have like 3 attackers to go
---
I got the exact same thing
---
Exactly.
---
I’ve been a bandit and smoke main since alpha.
---
Most matches now there’s no point in running Kaid unless there is a hatch because everyone is going to pick shields or impacts.
---
You are better off anchoring with someone else than Kaid or just using bandit and batteries to supplement mute and roaming.
---
Yeah totally see what you mean there are so different many ways this operator could work but it really comes down to the community thank you so much for the feed back
---
Please get me up, I'm down
---
we know. it's part of the game. it's still an addictive piece of shit i can't stop playing.
---
And it's working
---
Explain please? I’ve played cs:go and would much rather play siege any day?
---
I think we know, I choose to believe that its more about the love for the game that keeps us going.
---
Your flair disturbs me
---
Why no ? Please explain
---
OP’s using mnk but it’s because OP hurt his wrist
---
Amen
---
🏅
---
It's in a way more competitive state than it used to be  during Operation Health
---
Oh yeah that’s true it could be like jackal where it just selects one person or something .
---
Should be kaid down there since he took all the acogs
---
looks like a neat bac3
---
I need new pants

This doesn't happen if you don't peak outside as defense. This spot is completely useless if you...actually, you know... defend.
---
Truth is the game was rigged from the start; there was no polish map to begin with
---
r/whoosh sorry 😂😂😂
---
Deluxe edition does not include the original ops, only year one

Lmao I totally said fortnite bad because I'm an avid hater of fornite because annoying kids woooo.

Yes I realized during that game that the primary shot gun was a no go
---
Unless it was a competition of the most toxic games, it didn't deserve shit.
---
Make it a reality and use the Mare’s Leg on BF4

---
The games god-awful outdated single-player engine creates tons and tons of issues among hit-reg, desync, terrible looks cosmetics for characters, game devs that couldnt care less, the game is positively overrun with bugs and problems, rampant hackers, and my personal favorite: unbalanced operators.
---
Ah okay that sounds more familiar
---
Makes a Great Wall paper
---
It's a joke
---
Dear god
---
Nice dude nearly beat the record
---
I can basically learn simply that you are an engineer doors teaching the jerks how to make a door in a right way
---
Well I do have OP blocked and I refuse to play with him because he's a cheating sack of shit, so there's that.
---
Remember and Aim Down when checking corners.
---
I was thinking the 5.7 would actually be godly, as it basically fires a mini 5.56, which is a fast boi, and is also pointier, which is better for armor. The Beowulf would also clap major cheeks too.
---
Idk why.... BUT YES
---
It would be cool and not unreasonable if they just made it so they were bulletproof during the duration of his animation, so once he placed it in front of him he can’t be shot while he’s pegging it in
---
I know, I haven’t even bought Nøkk and Warden I just don’t think they are worth the renown, especially for Ranked.
---
No, no that's impossible, NOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I’ve been there man 😂
---
Nøkk is ehhh but warden is more useless then the 417 probably
---
Oh dont get me wrong I love one and I'd love to irl own one. 
---
But its certainly a pea shooter compared to the Meusoc and Deagle. 
---
And nothing compares to sneaking up to someone and yeeting a full mag into them. But if I'm warming up I run 5.7
---
PROMOTED
---
I think that is the case right now. The problem is there is a loooong 2 seconds before the barricade comes down to his waist, even then he can be shot on his foot
---
IKR especially with the constant Blitz ban in Ranked.
---
I think the Twitch should’ve have me there tbh
---
I feel like I’ve seen this before in a gif version of this that looked exactly like this but was animated.
---
Quite sus.
---
What OP would look best as Colonel Sanders?
---
Gotta get those GB points.
---
Exactly plus blitz has always been crap I mean all you need to do is throw impact nades and just kinda crouch spam. Much harder to get shot or meleed so making warden still useless
---
Always stay calm never get to wild. U will never know where people will be. Have fun. And don't let a loss stop u.
---
That's a null argument really, as long as you can recognize that it's a pattern, voting yes on kicking a clutching player without the clutcher getting involved in chat/voicechat and successfully winning the game. If a person follows this set pattern many times over, without utilizing the kicking feature for much else, they could be given some sort of penalty.
---
This would really just be a way to disincentive people from doing it, as when you know you can be punished for it you won't just do it for the meme.
---
Wait how do u find your drivers on your computer and how do u uninstall em I’m not very techy
---
? Is it the key binding reset?
---
Im still waiting on a dual wield operator.
---
i know, but some things are looking way better, especially when you have a good friend that can build so good that it coukd be a youtube channel
---
You should try limiting your FPS to something below your max FPS but above your monitor refresh
---
I also started in wind bastion, but I’d say it’s worth just saving up tbh
---
This actually happened to me earlier I was pissed off
---
It’s a horrible and inconsistent shotgun
---
It’s funny for memes though
---
Yeah I only find Blitz irritating and dangerous if I’m playing against Diamonds that are Blitz mains.😓
---
haha funny thing, the right monitor died today
---
Once I hit high silver/ low gold in ranked there's very little toxicity. Queuing with teammates helps too. 
---
The new friendly fire system has been working pretty well.
---
I have done nothing but teleport bread for 3 days
---
So would everyone just prefer Siege to be a CS rip-off then? No ops because you can’t balance them, no unique weapons because you can’t balance them, no ADS because you can’t balance that. Why should a game lose its entire identity to try and abide to this sort of shit?
---
I see thanks for the heads up.👍🏼
---
Update C+ Distributables
---
Only skilled people should use him. My friend thinks he is good with blitz even though he dies first while I play clash and almost never die. It's usually to some stupid teammate but whatever and he is wondering why I'm telling him not to get clash next
---
should be sept 10.
---
No worries
---
Last one is on stairs, don’t rush him.
---
LOL yeah it’s safer to play Monty TBH.
---
It’s good for making pretty big holes in walls, kinda a budget buck

# Delet this

But minecradf

---
wat? no it should be balanced. cs:go is has better balance and is comparable since they are both tactical shooters. that's why cs is used. im not say the game should be more like cs, im saying it should be balanced
---
I like that flare, too bad I don’t have a pc to change mine
---
Second round we lost the first but its cool having people who arnt total jackasses on my team.
---
I think that's the only black ice im missing for GSG9 very nice!
---
They mean the chances to get it out of an alpha pack,which is rare.
---
Not the amount of players who have it
---
use ur drone before pushing, unless theres no time
---
ignore, mute and report toxic teammates
---
Yeah that’s true
