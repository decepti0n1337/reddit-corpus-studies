Best temporary solution. Bye now losers!

I bought the standard 20€ edition about 2 weeks ago. All base ops are available for 1000 renown. And I was saving up for Maverick (25000) and now I'm collecting all base ops after which I'm going to the more intricate ones.
---
Right, because we all put Secure and Hostage in Ranked mode. It was us that did that.  LMAO at kids like you who think they're good.
---
I hoesntly just prefer Secure Area. I don't care if that makes me a worse player or whatever. You switch sides anyways so I don't really see how it's not considered competive. Each team has an equal opportunity to win and it comes down to skill and strategy in the end.
---
In response to u/MTheTomeSweeper, the opportunity was there! 🤣
---
You're right, they're the type to complain about it being a dumb change, get stuck in gold, and stop playing.
---

---
^^Sorry ^^not ^^sorry ^^^Secure ^^^Diamonds*
---
An alive defender has priority. Even if it’s your valk cam for example. If no one is on the cam then a dead defender can control it, but the second a alive defender switches to it they get the control.
---
Yea it’ll probably be just like the last one lol
---
people who play this game competitively want ranked to be like pro league. if you don’t like it then play casual
---
Basically what the other guy said, they also changed how cav and capitao looked too, now cav actually looks Brazilian
---
But at the same time, people don't fucking plant and would rather go for that last kill.
---
Diamond.  The problem is that the character's utility is entirely dependent upon him surviving, and succeeding in fragging through the smoke.  
---
It's a fragging anchor. Every other anchor has universal utility.  Situational/individual utility has almost never been meta in this game.
---
Let’s hope they actually fix it
---
Not when people stop playing
---
Warden with the donut operator mustache
---
For practice rounds, agreed. If you’re looking for a legit Thunt you need to deal with the bombers. But for just map and gun practice, I’ve been feeling this way since White Noise
---
Dealing with runouts its better than dealing with glitches
---
Keep it to my guy, it's pretty cool to see it fill up more and more
---
With all the glitches, cheats, and toxic dummies.. They're working on it.
---
They're not even going to be subtle about it, huh?
---
Now that you mention it damn I wish it was that
---
It's pretty much a placebo button.
---
FYI, any op with a deployable shield can do the glitch this time around.
---
pisses me off they gave those shit guns

That could just be new animations/attachments for those guns or operators in general. If they are real they are terrible choices, Valk’s marshmallow shooter is only balanced because her kit is so strong, it’d be terrible for a 3 speed. FMG9 is probably the worst smg on defense and attackers generally get better guns to balance them out. Unless the stats are completely different, it just doesn’t make sense. Guess we’ll find out Sunday.
---
Ok, but people are paying for the Season Pass and they are free to not even give new weapons but choose randomly some of the old ones?  
---
Come -fuckin- on, that's just ridicolous.
---
One is a defender and the other is an attacker.
---
Yeah, slowly filling up.
---
Holy shot they actually did something.
---
Credit where credit is due, good on ‘em!
---
They said that they might could provide a fix to the exploits next week, so I guess barbed wire will have to do the trick until then lol!
---
Anyone know when this starts? And will the horrible glitches be fixed before then?
---
Well, in the real world if you own a franchise like Rainbow6 it takes work.
---
I don’t need a sob story about developers. There are games without glitches. If this game carries on with the glitches, then me and many others will leave the community.
---
That is highly relevant information for them to know.
---
Good (or not so good as a Clash main) news OP  [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-349909-16/update-live-exploits](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-349909-16/update-live-exploits)
---
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY KEPT IQ'S GRENADES!
---
I haven’t been playing because of the exploits, as soon as I heard of them I just stopped. The game is toxic enough at times as is. I’ll wait it out then hop back on
---
I keep thinking Dad warden memes are going to be a thing
---
Wow, I am actually thoroughly impressed. Ubi actually doing something about the problem instead of letting the entire game go to shit for 3 weeks while it's fixed.
---
Good job on them.
---
garbage. like always
---
It does have its own strategy but it just really isn't as balanced that's what makes it more competitive. I would just try to play some bomb in casual to get the hang of it more
---
They don't care we can even threaten them and they still won't listen to us, I remember when people asked for Dokkaebi for the K1A that Vigil has because they complained she only had a DMR and shotgun, it's not fair but they've never added new weapons for a DLC operator, But the least they could do is let us use an ACOG for the FMG-9 that's the shit I don't like.
---
Hopefully we see exploits in future being dealt with like this, and hopefully more quickly. Good job.
---
On another note I would like to point out that since year 3 we have been getting only one version of new maps, a day version. I would love to see the recent maps of year 3 and 4 including the future reworked versions to have a night version for casual playlist added to the game, more map versions seems only fair for the lack of "new content" we are going to have,
---
This isn't Titanfall bud. If you're asking this you clearly weren't here for Maestro's release. Shit actually ruined the for me for like 2 weeks
---
Not if you actually hit someone with it.
---
They're "rainbow" operators. They are no longer held down by their previous units. They can use whatever weapons they choose. Just think about them walking in to rainbow HQ and picking a gun off the wall.
---
Top 10 anime battles
---
I GUESS SHE GOT SOME BIG ASS HANDS THEN BC ITS A FULL SIZED DEAGLE
---
The spark seems to indicate I dinged the copy machine or whatever, right? Because my ACOG is definitely right on home boy's brain when I pull that trigger.
---
at least give them the ones that are good and fun to used to valkyrie and smokes...................
---
Understandable, definitely would practice up on it as they are super super helpful
---
That's a mine field my guy
---
Still think it was a missed opportunity to give the FiveseveN to the secret service since they actually use them but that's just my personal gripe.
---
Is clash gone. Can I come back and play now?
---
This is the funnest part of the game, legit enjoy unlocking all them. Have fun!!! I’ve played since year 2 so I didn’t have as many
---
dear diary....
---
Lmao I saw the gadget on her glove and couldn't help myself
---
I play to have fun with friends while also being competitive. If ubi wants all players to have a esports like experience, then just make another game mode. I like the idea, but I also enjoy not having pick and ban on ranked
---
She will disabled tonight.
---
Ok retard
---
lmao
---
Clubhouse needed a complete rework of the top floor, like Kafe got for the bottom floor. Then ubi buffed the other floors just a smidgen.
---
Yes!  Now how i have friday saturday sunday and monday free i can get renown!  Thanks ubi
---
I LOVE playing this game competitively, but the 3 round rotation really didn’t play well for me.
---
Casual is too casual these days.. you can’t play seriously on cas
---
Agreed. This exactly.
---
The gadget animations are so smooth, I love them already.
---
Without ACOG?
---
Oh lord no not as an op, but as a game mode like outbreak.
---
As someone else mentioned a lot like the half life mod: Hidden Source
---
Does this mean Nobody will have Claymores, or just IQ?
---
Hey! I was about to say that
---
in their defense, the DMR is not that bad and has at least an acog
---
I do have a lot of ops to play, which is why I’m not upset that much. It’s mostly my mates who I’m worried about, as they only play a few ops.
---
I hate the "Less queue times" excuse, there's 2 sections of the game split into 3 gamemodes. There are millions of players on all the time, It's not like I have to wait that long for a game.
---
Really, the same weapons? 
---
Yeah I bet USSS agents use MPX smgs, unless they do.
---
And Fromandskorpset are definetly going to be using loud and cumbersome 50 caliber hand cannons as their sidearms.
---
I hope they at least change Nokk's pistol.
---
I think it can be justified lore-wise as all of the CTUs being connected within Rainbow 6. Not that I think the choices make sense, eg. real life secret service using short-barreled P90s means Warden had an obvious reuse case. But yeah, I agree.
---
They are already disabling clash, deployable shields and claymores tomorrow. Check the @Rainbow6Game twitter. No need for these changes.
---
I personally don’t notice any difference with Cav but maybe it’s cus the make up. But I mean Echo still looks like a Japanese-American
---
Nobody will have claymores by the sound of it.
---
Oh look, she's being removed, looks like I was right.
---
Likely nobody.
---
Totally agree. Disappointed
---
It's like they took a bunch of rarely used guns and gave it to these 2 (obviously the deagle being the exception because it's mandatory for Valk and BB).
---
Yes it is. There’s a skill base system in both casual and ranked
---
Just tryna say something. Ain't gotta be a troll
---
I'm 90 percent positive that it depends on your rank.
---
You just have to play more to learn them, it really doesn't take as long as you should think
---
That's a good question
---
What're the glitches? I don't think I've seen them, to be honest.
---
Nobody
---
I was here for maestros release, but I'm talking about all operators, CSGO style with recoil and rng. Maestro was a lot different with his hip fire spread, and I don't want it in the game. It's a discussion
---
I guess.
---
Yeah I'm one to play all 3, but sometimes like to play secure of I'm solo queing.
---
Does your grammar even works lol
---
You make a good point. I hope though that we will nit see the current 4 rounds to win.
---

Their special abilities are pretty good so maybe this is their way of not making them too op.
---
I'd rather get to play secure and pick my objective for once, Can I not get fucking bar on clubhouse or VISA office on consulate? I hate those open rooms that I would logically never pick.
---
But still tho, I enjoy not having pick and ban. I think it’s a great idea, but it would suit another game mode. Maybe this other game mode rewards more elo or maybe it’s just personal preference? I’m not sure, but I’m not all that worried. Do enjoy playing hibana tho, rip
---
yes we waited 3 months for a free update with dlc that isn’t hard to earn that doesn’t cost real money
---
just curious you think the r6s lore is cheesy rn?
---
what do you mean if they're 100% accurate? you do realize people could update their tts in a certain time frame and put their uplay to offline allowing them to access the tts with all the new updates including the new kafe rework lol
---
and although this IS how they're going to be, it's not final, that's the point of TTS..
---
Are you blind?
---
They haven't taken IQ claymore out....
---
The difference is you don't *need* the season pass to get them. They're available for everyone, whether they're unlocked automatically or unlocked with renown
---
I'm fine with that, I want the new GR to be dummy good

Clash banned in general

---
Im talking about you must im not talking about op rn but like whoever would have gotten perma banned
---
The MPX isn't that bad, imo. But having the FMG-9 as the only auto/semi-auto choice on an attacker is a big oof to me. It does align with the patch notes adding Mozzie's sight to the FMG-9, though.
---
Clash glitch
---
Stop your whining. They already Said that they will Lock clash, claymore and deployable shield. Just learn to wait like everybody else.
---
Warden has the P100-C in this trailer which was in the leak
---
Break clashes barbed wire it ruins it.

Thats true, but I feel as though if I stop him this time, it’ll discourage him from doing it again
---
This seems to be a good update, but fuck the Hereford one
---
Alibi used her Mx4 in her trailer
---
Ranked, Pro league?
---
thanks man
---
An hour ago. I do not use Twitter. I just learned about it. I have been trying to play all day. It is still ridiculous how long it takes them to Change things and figure things out. The game has been out for 3 years. A lot of this should be figured out already.
---
Hacking on PS4 is legit. I’ve gone against a few using a the shown hit box hack. My teammates watched him follow me through the wall as as I tried to flank him multiple times but he was always looking at the doorway I was going to go through and was prefiring before I was even through the doorway...
---
I'm fine with Warden's loadout but Nokk is just weird, they gave her a mediocre smg with no ACOG, if they want to reuse her guns they should at least pick good ones like vigil's primary or something similar.
---
Shit secure area really
---
I don't understand why Nokk got no AR and ACOG, even IQ and Ash got both. And they're 3 speed ops, which Nokk is only a 2 speed.
---
Someone else noticed this!
---
I’m playing right now and all of those are still happening.
---
Nevermind. Twitter R6 said they are disabling clash atm due to exploit fixes.
---
Did we look at the same thing beside the downstairs it’s exactly the same
---
HOLO FOR FMG-9!!!!!
---
Removing a weapon = changing the loadout 
---
You big dumb
---
I said before the round started(Bc he was using Jäger with shield) that if he did the glitch, “I swear to god, if you do the shield glitch, I’ll tk”
---
Huh. I guess I just assumed it was middle of the road. I don't play smoke much.
---
She would’ve been the PERFECT operator to give the Honey Badger to.
---
That and she’s disabled on the selection screen
---
Because you’re a cunt
---
Lion's V308 is a completely different asset to Mira's Vector, it's like saying the 416-C and 417 are using the same asset just because they look similar.
---
Maybe your cheat games cancelled out
---
[Is indeed real](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-349909-16/update-live-exploits)
---
Kanal is next season and then theme park
---
Not to be an asshole, but it's your own fault for forgetting... When you spawn in, don't just immediately run off, always be patient and hesitant
---
Yeah. I just hope a great operator like Nøkk is ruined with low-tier weapons. The FMG9 I can see, but the Shotgun is literally ass. Plus, sometimes what make an operator IS their unique weapon. But we'll see!
---
Ranked
---
&gt; they use ø
---
&gt; with that special ö.
---
Pointed that out, just didn't want to go look for it.
---
Yes, Danes might understand both, Norwegians will understand both, Swedes will either have a difficult or impossible time to understand, that's what I  meant.
---
If it wasn't obvious enough, I am Swedish.. I've had Danish friends and unless I'm a special kind of Swede, they are not easy to understand, much less when they use their own language.
---
You have an easier time just speaking English, which we do when we find each other online.
---
If you want to understand what I hear when they speak, imagine someone shoving oatmeal into their mouth and speaking. Idk if that's a common saying about Danes, but that's what I think of when I hear them speak. 
---
Of course, there might also the case that I'm actually in the minority having issues understanding them.
---
Awesome
---
If you can't play nice you get your toys taken away. Suck it toxic fucks.
---
What is the glitch with claymores? What are people doing?
---
Nah bro got it ages ago
---
Nøkk would’ve been the PERFECT operator to give the Honey Badger to. Both of these loadouts are pretty shit and disappointing.
---
I wish it was the regular HOLO sight
---
What is the user you summon to to get a copy of the video

Hello jackgraham151, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpko9j/if_it_isnt_smurfs_on_console_or_the_clash_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
&gt; IDK what the heck game you're playing then I see Cav constantly
---
High level and comp bomb
---
&gt; some of the best players in the world play Cav. 
---
No they don't
---
&gt; Serenity17 made her famous because he could carry any team with her.
---
Not in the scene anymore and was a Jager main in PL
---
&gt; She doesn't see Pro League play because people are trying hard, but in standard ranked people don't go full sweat so she's good.
---
You don't have to go full sweat to deal with a Cav.
---
Cool thanks everyone!
---
what happened?
---
I feel you dude, every match it's a bunch of idiots combining glitches. I always team kill anyone abusing it but then their friend always tk's back :(
---
but you get them instantly without any grind. Anyone who spends 40 bucks to get the season pass for 7 days early access especially if renown isnt your concern (which your implying by the EA idea that everyone instsntly has enough renown from day 1 of a season) is honestly insane. If you can't see the absurdity in this logic then fbm.
---
yeah and I'm cool with it. I'm not some sweaty player. I may be a caveria main which means I need to roam but I just muck about with friends
---
I am not fond of random threads but nvm.  
---
I think that most ops are fine as they are right now, but some fixes could be useful.   
---
Ela should receive back one thing out of three: 50ammo mag, 4th mine, impacts. Her first nerf was strong enough to make her really hard to use, and one year after it could be time to restore her to a role more similar to that of Alibi rather than a roamer like Jaeger/Bandit, AKA all about their guns when it comes to roaming.  
---
Alibi Storm Mx4 could receive some little love. Moving it to 28 would allow Alibi to deal with 2 Speed easier and encourage people to play her more. This or, just as with Ela, she should receive a 4th Prisma.  
---
All LMG should have the same ADS time that Gridlock has, in order to be competitive choices compared to the ARs, which are in general superior weapons.   
---
I am quite unsure about Zofia having 2 concussion grandes. 4 were too much, and 3 were fine IMO, as they were extremely similar to Ash 3 flashbangs. But now that Ash was nerfed, maybe Zofia is ok with only 2 concussions.
---
God I hope not, get that filth out of my fucking video games
---
I love the wardens running animation it’s like an actual FBI agent
---
Lol you don't get a pass because you've put hours in. Enjoy your ban.
---
her loadout still contains the claymore its just disabled until they fix the bug not the same thing
---
Ok but I think that the gadgets where actually pretty good
---
It’s really weird to say but I’ve only been TKed one time this whole season....I guess I’m super lucky?
---
Until they come out, we can't be 100% sure, so I am still considering that small possibility of them being different.   
---
Or at least, of them having a 3 option.
---
Yes. It's in the latest designer notes
---
Siege don’t listen so I would think it would be better to show the community what console is like
---
why no twitch?
---
Yes actually, my beef with the FMG isn't the stats.
---
No point. They can’t use shields now
---
They are making these changes because it makes ranked more balanced. Just because you are not used to it does not mean it is worse. Statistics say that bomb is the best game mode. Having 3 round rotation is also more balanced because it emphasizes on teamwork. You are able to see your mistakes from last round and instantly fix them as a team, resulting in better plays from everyone. 3 round rotation also makes winning every round even more important. Pick and ban is a great addition as well because it stops people from using op strays and the same operators every match. Finally, making ranked more like pro league can result in more people watching pl because they are used to how it’s played, which is what Ubisoft wants. It’s all to improve player experience.
---
A majority of people claim that they are placeholders. Sorry not exactly confirmed, but lots of people agree.
---
Pretty sure the leakers were joking...
---
I just remember seeing this a while ago and it getting a lot of attention. Someone beat you to it
---
Like I said.... we'll see how it plays out.
---
What?
---
Yo momma
---
She, as well as anyone who has a deployable shield and IQ are broken. I goes invisible and the deployable shields will get clipped to the chest and head of operators making them near impossible to kill.
---
Its not in effect for me yet? How long till its out for everyone
---
Everyone’s complaining they’re not adding new weapons, but I’m totally fine with having recycled weapons, especially the FMG-9 because up until Nokk the only op who had it was smoke and he rarely used it because of the shotguns utility. Plus the new reload animations make them feel different too.
---
i like the vortex and the regular holo, i can use both but i can see why you might prefer it
---
ewwwww
---
I know you aren’t supposed to give out info, but are the weapons for warden and nokk placeholders or actually their weapons?
---
hi just curious, was this at comiket?
---
Really?
---
but it basically DID come out, that's my point. the only reason they'd change anything now is if the community reacts really bad to a certain thing or they notice something wrong they need to just tweak
---
they did
---
Yeah i know. In norway we have a saying that all danes have a potato shoved down their throat. But atleast in written language they're all incredibly similar.
---
No, LongFall7 was just playing clash. Hellbut did do the clash glitch and on attacking walled us all
---
what platform is that on?  i literally just played a game with a clash glitcher.
---
I'm personally not mad that they reusing guns, it's that the selections don't really make sense. It would be more accurate to real life to give warden an mp5 and nokk a shotgun other than the six12 among other things
---
Another thing you should try is Frosts Super 90 shotty. It’s great for pushing an attacker and destroying ppl
---
Thanks
---
WE DON’T CARE POST THIS ELSEWHERE
---
i dont really see how it’s different but ok
---
The Division and Rainbow 6 universes are different, thou it's nice to see ubi kinda draw them together like that
---
You had a cheater on your team my dude
---
I don’t think they are, it’s certainly possible, but the D-50 doesn’t have barrel attachments unless they changed that too. We never really know until full release, but I’m surprised they are just refusing guns.
---
Yeah, because then people playing Echo would have more options available to them. Hell, Echo couldn't even *do* the deployable shield glitch. It didn't need to be removed from him.
---
What happened?
---
No problem.  Patience is arguably one of the most important parts of siege, so try to work on that too!
---
So for defense and roaming, I'm partial to any 3 speeds really.  I tend to use jager, bandit and ela the most, but cav and vigil are the ops made to roam.  Jager has a fantastic gun so definitely give him a shot.  
---
And on defense you can never go wrong with barbed wire as a gadget, no matter who you play!
---
i’d love to see me shooting the vector with an acog. it’d be silly
---
Yeah, these are the reasons I thought they were placeholders, but with it only being a few days to reveal and the fmg getting the new sights got me worried.
---
Siege never set out to realistic anyway
---
Yep. Why would Ubi waste time in making new weapons?
---
&gt; Bomb is run around and spawnkill and roam as much and watch bomb from two floors above or find some cheesy way to watch bomb areas and shit.
---
What? All of those thing are at least as effective if not more in secure area. The bomb areas are bigger than the secure areas so its harder to cover them from off site.
---
Obviously someone on your team was a cheater, so they removed the elo you got from winning said matches with cheaters

I hate to break it to you, but it wasn’t an ace. Someone on the other team TK’d. Also your scum for being a fuze main.
---
there’s so much to say honestly. best way to learn is either t-hunt or casual. and don’t play newcomers mode. that locks you to 3 maps. if you wanna learn maps just play all of em. the learning curve is a bit steep so you’ll definitely feel outclassed most of the time but you’ll get there.

also drone as often as possible. this is something new players don’t do enough.
---
In game she wears an anchor on her shoulder, which is part of the frog men’s insignia. Until/if they change it, she is mislabeled and is frogmen
---
I wouldn't be so sure:
---
https://youtu.be/y87K1EkSAK4
---
There's already a video out - shows their abilities and weapons + weapon attachments
---
I refuse to believe these are their weapons at all.
---
No witch hunting dude it’s against the rules
---
The content is still there, you just can't get a rank for it...
---
Man what a proper mess Ubisoft has to clean up. You think Clash will be back after her Anger management  therapy group?
---
They revealed the new operator abilities. Nokk will be stealthy like Caveira and can hide from cameras like Vigil, but on attack. Warden can see through smoke with his glasses, and they also reduce flash effect like Ying, but on defence. Now everyone seems to think Ubi is out of ideas, but everyone has been asking for a flash and smoke counter, plus I've always said Vigil would work better on attack so now we've got that
---
There's also the case that they may have weapons that other operators already have...
---
Ubi made the joke themselves you gong
---
I’m saying there’s the slightest chance that the viewmodel animations are for their actual guns and not the placeholders. It’s looking more and more likely that these are the real guns though sadly. Seriously, fuck Ubisoft. I’m never buying a Season Pass again.
---
He’s literally a part of the US secret service
---
You can go ahead and leave Clash out of the game permanently.
---
My goal in life is to make it to negative ping
---
They just made 4 big maps and 4 events give them a break guys, the gun switch up can be really cool for the fact you don’t know if it’s valk or ward and stuff like that
---
Thx dude
---
the locked bomb sites make up for the economy thing. You have to defend weaker sites with each round win.
---
Obviously Clash being disabled is good, and any operator with a shield can shield glitch, but isn't it only IQ that can use the claymore to be invisible? Why disable it for all OPs?
---
This was my original thought as well, but if you think about it all the secure/hostage controller players will now be in the bomb playlist as well so it might balance out a bit.
---
Because everyone who plays this game are fucking 15-22 year old militaristic level alpha clearance weapons experts who have probably never touched anything beyond a hunting rifle, if that...
---
I've been away from the game for like 2 weeks. What are these glitches they're fixing?
---
okay, shottys have been a favourite of mine, will give it a shot :)
---
Joking. I said /s which means it’s sarcasm
---
**How about both**
---
Just fluff.
---
I think this would be a good idea, but I’m just worried it might just become another black mirror at that point, and might become a bit overpowered
---
No u
---
Must be PC, still glitchers on console
---
It definitely needs work. Not going to lie there.
---
I. Can't. Wait.
---
Isn’t the only attacker with a primary SMG Jackal whole also has access to one of the best assault rifles in the game?
---
You are a very good man. *Salutes*

---
they just tweeted this
---
Well done soldier.
---
Not available in the us?
---
Yeah it sucks the same shit weapons
---
Lol. I think I’d give them a week or so then all of this will go away. I’m just surprised that they have a disable function. Just came out of nowhere like these glitches. People complaining on this sub because they lost a ranked match due to this should’ve known better then to play ranked in this environment. Let’s just be thankful the R6 team has this under control now.
---
Ok didn't know what that mean I feel stupid now but thank for clearing that up for me in the future  I guess half woosh
---
Did you watch the video? Aesthetically is exactly the same, so that's a lot less work.
---
They added walls to the main entrance and they opened up kitchen. They also added some walls on the top floor and added a new balcony.
---
That's not a new map by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Lol you should see me on console
---
Thank God. Tired of dealing with the glitchers who cheat and say it's part of the game.
---
Lets wait for the real reveal before complaining, it’s only a few days away.
---
I highly doubt he’s German with how he looks and I doubt a German would be in the SS lol
---
this kind of reminds me of bartlett u.
---
a little huffed about Nokk being a 2-speed,  I was hoping for a right proper stealth op, and the extra sound kinda ruins that whole dealio
---
No he’s not.  Fuse is in the game to keep people from camping the objective.  Don’t like it, go upstairs and get him.  Unless he’s on a roof.
---
What do you expect? they have no idea what they’re doing. That game is horrible.
---
Pretty slick how you just gloss over the main complaint in your final sentence and put a "may have".
---
Ubisoft damage control?
---
Only bomb...   
---
Wow..
---
It was already a abysmal idea reusing guns, but they also have a shit and super odd load out. If this is true ubi needs to change shit.
---
Yeah i just looked at their twitter page, looks like clash will be disabled tomorrow on consoles.
---
yea lmao no problem better late than never
---
*you're and getting an ace means you kill all that you can on the other team, so technically it was an ace due to that tk... motherfuckers are dumb
---
I saw a video of nokks ability in action and it had the same partical effect as the division agents and warden had the same thing when he activated his so maybe they’re sharing tech with the SHD and team rainbow?
---
Screw pillar stairs. So many angles you can get shot from. Never going up those.
---
straight up aren't placeholders, Nokk has special default skins for the SIX12SD, FMG-9 and Deagle.
---
Warden's MPX is light grey instead of black like Valk's, stop spreading misinformation.
---
Nope. Just not assuming anything like everyone else.
---
Also, is it really that terrible if there's no new weapons? It's not like it's the first time
---
I’m not your father
---
Yeah, but it shoots ar rounds and is modified to have a drum mag
---
Sorry I should have seen the “lesion main” tag and agreed that the kid didn’t know what he was talking ab
---
I don’t get it
---
That just reminded me, if I ever stop playing, I could sell the account for like 30 bucks!
---
Thanks man :) obviously patience is a big part of the game in some scenarios, but that’s why I love playing r6 rn, just a nice fresh new way fps for me, since I mostly play d2 and bo4. will give all the ops are shot, not trying to find a main. Once again, thanks for helping a scrub out, greatly appreciated
---
It's just something I thought was kind of funny, just a joke. I'm not being serious.
---
when they fix there so never
---
I mean, if you wanna go off the weapons they actually use then it’s P90 and MP5. Or Remington 870.
---
The FMG is a cool design but I don’t think it gets much mileage in the real world.
---
No
---
I really thought nokk was gonna have two slices of bacon as weapons to balance out her ability. 
---
I was right.
---
***give***
---
Thankyou Ubisoft for removing the glitched elements that are hurting our game
---
I'm just fortunate enough that I stopped playing before the shit hit the fan. Still gonna miss seeing my favorite trash talking brit.
---
Titan main?????
---
like u
---
Well to balance that out thеy could probably make it to were either the barricade covers the entire door frame or make glaz be able to see through it
---
Ha jokes on people who expect this I play those characters I dont k ow the ballistic shield glitch and dont own clash. I wouldn't do it anyways because this shits dumb.
---
Mmm...doubt.
---
It is. Secure and Hostage are inherently not balanced. And no I'm not. When the proleague playlist was here, this entire sub was asking for these changes to make it into ranked. The game and operators are balanced around bomb. Bomb should be the only mode for ranked.
---
Hello TekRek201, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bplpzo/this_shield_glitch_is_getting_really_annoying/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Is the buggy sound gonna get fixed by then or will I still not hear an ash entering a window next to me
---
Do you play consol or PC?
---
That is so disappointing lol
---
One could only hope, I probably reported like 5 guys this week directly to Ubi support just for a chance that elo would be adjusted for everyone who was in a ranked match with them.
---
Remember pretty sure you have to go offline of Uplay too. So hmm.
---
WHY ARE YOU YELLING??
---
I DONT KNOW ABOUT ANY BUG!
---
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY CLASH IS DISABLED.
---
Probably the closest thing to anything like that was when Thatcher had a shotgun in splash art but not in game. But that was when the game was vanilla and he got his shotgun in Y1S1 i think.
---
I'm dying inside
---
The new ranked changes post have almost 900 upvotes and counting. People want these changes.
---
I feel like the term cheat should be reserved for the people that abuse glitches. Not because they have a different preferred game mode. But who am I to decide haha
---
Clash could shoot her weapon with the shield on top of it and IQ could turn invisible.
---
lol Ubisoft came out and said they design maps and operators around the bomb gametype because they feel it is the most competitive way to play siege. I’m not going to write you an essay on why bomb is more competitive. If you don’t understand why you can do the research on your own.
---
Plus you can still play the uncompetitive modes in casual.
---
You don't even see it though. You don't even see it while fighting someone. I mean, I barely notice skins when shooting at someone unless it's super obvious elite skin. Let alone the type of clip they have on their vest.
---
Warden looks like a dad for some reason. Like I expect him to shoot someone, then around, and crack a shitty dad joke or leave for steak and beer or something lmao
---
-Its a bug or a feature?
---
-Yes
---
You're right. I probably shouldn't say cheat but it is true people take advantage of secure to grind MMR easily. Maybe "abuse"
---
very clever ubi
---
Cav has the second highest win rate of any defender, clearly she's a threat.
---
Not to split hairs, but the Secret Service uses primarily European weapons - Sig Sauer and H&amp;K are from German, and FN is from Belgium. The only American gun I can see that they're trained on is a Remington shotgun (if [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service#Weapons_and_equipment) is to believed).
---
Not to mention the US Army for the longest time had Beretta handguns as standard issue - an Italian manufacturer. The US uses a lot of foreign guns.
---
I’m honestly just gonna quit the game for the next month or so until the glitches are patched
---
Vigil: ... didn't think you were real.
---
Nokk: I'm real when it's useful.
---
How's BOPE's reputation among civilians IRL?
---
"hey we should make the cameras pause when she passes by"
---
"Nah mate we can't do that because the cameras are in real time"
---
Oh I can't wait to stomp on all the Secure Area noobs. Ahahahahah
---
Can’t we say the same for echo?
---
Its about consistency man, if she doesnt use a AR, she doesnt need AR mags, while we are at it, 3 armor operators that wearing shirt and not a single piece of armor also pisses me off a lot.
---
Warden looks straight outta Team Fortress or something.
---
Good stuff man, im doing the same thing
---
Fucking trash players needing glitches to win
---
It would’ve better if they affected the raindrops, but great work nonetheless!
---
She has acog and its a dmr.
---
Be all over tomorrow and these fake rank placed kiddies and no lifers are gonna get twatted back to bronze. REJOICE!
---
They accidentally released it, try now
---
Kaid technically has 2 acogs, Pistol and shotgun,
---
idk those people lol im from asia
---
Are you going to cry with the new ranked changes?
---
Hello BalestraLunge, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bplrxd/le_glitch_has_arrived/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
To me he looks more like Gordon from dark knight
---
Also not trying to argue with you but look at my edit. I’m just kinda being devils advocate/ looking for the silver lining so to speak.
---
I’m so disappointed they re used guns... makes me way less interested in playing now :/
---
Part of IQ going invisible glitch I guess
---
It's too predictable, only a couple of decent ways in on attack, and only so many places to actually stand on defense. So it involves a lot of window angles, which means a lot of run outs. From the videos I've seen on the new version it looks like the clubhouse variety of remakes, not hereford remake.
---
Your payback is going to happen when he's going to demote 2 divisions and have a garbage mmr, don't worry and stick to casual for now
---
They got the G18 in Rainbow Six Vegas 2. I think the real issue is they’re using the P-10C for clash and mozzie and that gun is a direct competitor to the Glock 19. They’d probably play very similar and someone would probably get mad if one were better
---
No, pretty sure it was Paladins
---
Because there's no new content to look at
---
Because it sets a precedent for all future seasons. If we were content with this then they'd take that as an excuse to barely release any new weapons anymore.
---
One thing I never really understood was how people found these glitches. Pure chance and randomness or what?
---
I completely agree. IQ isn't the same without nades. Oh and also it prevents glitching
---
Ah then maybe not you then. It's mostly an American thing here. Even got some "friends" I play with who are all "I'm so gun expert I'd join the army but... (insert excuse)" types.
---
Attacker with MP and Shotgun? doesnt make any sence....
---
As I said earlier, being able to play whatever game mode breaks the idea of ranks meaning anything. A gold secure compared to a gold bomb player have very different skills and understandings of the game. This game is meant to be balanced around bomb. That's what all the ops and maps are made around. It doesn't make sense why you should be able to play secure or hostage in a competitive game mode. You still have casual if you want to play.
---
What's happening here?
---
its got better stats than the mp5. get your facts right
---
They’ve give everyone 26 DLC ops up to this point, ALL available for free if bought with in-game currency. Not to mention they just put them all on discount plans. And you’re complaining because the two new ops aren’t exciting or new enough for you. Right.
---
People don't seem to understand the 30 fps meme but ok sure.
---
I'll just see my glorious PC master race ass out then.
---
Tbh i just save vids of them doin this crap (really just the IQ one since its the worst of them) and send them to ubi on a ticket since you can add media or a vid link. They usually respond saying thank you and they'll pass it along but who knows what happens
---
Better than i'dve done, at least you lived through all that
---
That's my dream, they can't fix her shield and she is forced to retire from six, or she has to learn a new ability... like yelling louder.
---
Laid has an acog on his shotgun
---
"On your right you can see the train museum, pride of our good city since 1839, fully deserved only two years after St-Petersbourg and on your left a suicide bomber ready to take us to the pearly gates. Hello suicide bo-PRPRRPRPRROHHHFFF-"
---
I get downvoted to hell when I say I’m just saving them up..
---
I guess this subreddit hates people who want to open up more than one..
---
I'm going to have to completely disagree.  
---
While I think the "they allow new strategies" idea would certainly apply if they affected their entire team, they don't. Both new ops have self-centered gadgets and only bring themselves to the table. That's bland, and takes away from the strategic options that could be available to the whole team if the ops instead brought some kind of deployable or team-wide gadget (but also no more globals please).
---
I play both and I was in console, he did the invisible IQ glitch and the shield face
---
Thanks for the link man
---
Kinda sucks that they don’t get original weapons tho
---
Meh, I just want cool abilities and stuff. I still think they should add throwing knives to the game or an Op that has them as a gadget.
---
RIP Sweden lol
---
They justified it by saying Ubisoft needs to become aware like they dont already know. Just using it as a moral high ground to exploit.
---
Hi-diddly I attackerino
---
Does this season seem trash or is it just me??
---
This is the best thing to come of all the reveals
---
If Ubi had kept frags on her, then this wouldn’t happen.
---
I get it its funny cause recruit and tachanka
---
Wow you mean to play non competitive game modes like secure and hostage I need to play a non competitive match? I understand people liking secure but if siege wants to be taken seriously as a competitive game (if you don't like the competitive nature of siege that's why casual exists) they need to leave non competitive features behind.
---
Iq can use her claymore to basically go invisible
---
Bomb is by far my fav gamemode and i still hate it on consulate. Depending on the strats it can just be such a shitshow.
---
Ok I’m sorry you hate when people have fun differently than you. Even if they’re silver it doesn’t mean they cant have an opinion.
---
Make a sacrifice of blood and flesh to the matchmaking gods. Shall they be pleased, you will be granted your wish of a good team

Hello BV-RE2PECT, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpm4ka/when_you_see_your_teammates_try_using_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
"Why can't we pick clash?" 
---
You know why.. -_-
---
Please, tell me if the guns are placeholders or not or if they might get acog.
---
Then just learn how to play bomb? People wanting ranked to actually matter isn't 0.01%, the real minority are people like you who actually want secure in ranked, instead of focusing around the game mode that the entire game is balanced around.
---
New weapons for sure. I think it's ridiculous how Warden's SMG-12 literally still says 707 on the side.
---
He just calls them "pickle chin ah boi" and they fucking desinigrate
---
Well the FMG makes no sense for a special ops soldier in full battle gear, compared to a purpose built smg. It would however make sense for someone who's job involved being covert.
---
I agree but like I said, I'm pretty sure the guns right now are just place holders, I'm sure they'll update them when their ready. I was just using the USSS Sig example to explain why warden wasnt necessarily going to get "American" guns
---
whOA THERE, BucKo. It’s ok to be bronze.
---
ooooohhhh, that explains it
---
whats wrong with theme park?
---
I figured he looks more like Tom Selleck.
---
Well, I've seen YouTube content early plays have place holders soooo.
---
absolutely didn't
---
How can you put competitive and unbalanced in the same sentence? They're mutually exclusive, you can't be both. As far as I'm concerned every esports title should have the Ranked mode be as close to league play as possible.
---
I also liked the comparison to the conductor from the polar express hahah
---
but the new animations...
---
It's honestly shows this subs true colors (ranks) that people are actually bitching about ranked being more competitive.
---
"How can I stay gold 4 when I actually have to play bomb and cant just stomp the brainless secure games every day??"
---
Yeah I hate that the highest level of play all play bomb it's so bad to see balanced gameplay and dynamic rounds.
---
r/woooosh
---
I team kill every time I saw a random use the shield glitch or clash glitch
---
All the damn time! Aim bots happening too damn often!
---
First off, it's a magazine. Clips are for M1 Garands and other stripper clip loaded rifles. 
---
Second of which, just because you don't see it for yourself in gameplay does not mean that it's not worth doing for it's own sake in order to live up to the accuracy standards set by previous games. If it's worth doing (correctly modelling magazines in pouches), it's worth getting it right.
---
Nevertheless, a potential reason why some ops carry magazines for weapons that they themselves don't use (like STANAG-compliant 5.56 mags for ops that don't use guns that use them) would be that they carry those for their buddies (like Clash carrying a single polymer 5.56 mag that looks like it fits a G36, the rifle that the SCO19 actually uses).They carry like a spare mag or two that they can toss over to them in a pinch. That might address the discrepancy.
---
Why do you not want the game to improve?
---
This sub is filled with shitters
---
Looks like we have no reason to play ranked anymore. Let's just stick with...... casual.
---
Because hes ned flanders
---
Custom games not effected =)
---
Its like buck and sledge, right off the bat they came out with buck, who does essentially the same thing as sledge, just in a slightly different manor. Both a great ops, and both are attackers.
---
Im totally fine with an attacker doing something similar as a defender and vice versa if it makes sense.
---
Its the same as the uncompetitive maps. Not competitive -&gt; Theyre not in competitive. Aint that complex.
---
YES, here have my updoot. I really want an op with an m16 or mk18
---
I'm all for balance really, but restricting the map pool and gamemode even more is just unfun. If you didn't like bomb or the small playlist in ranked oh well fuck you then.
---
probably deployable cameras. but what about hacked drones?
---
It can be done with any op with claymores i think that’s why they removed all claymores not just iq’s claymores.
---
It isn't a step in the right direction yet.
---
Those are placeholders. If ubi releases all those guns now , what's the point of a full reveal on Sunday?
---
My understanding is that they traditionally couldn't do this. I would bet this is something new which has been implemented (and thank god.)
---
ok
---
This is fucking stupid as hell. Let people play how they want to play, pro league can continue on being super fun and entertaining. But should take alot more than just one gametype to be considered a ranked player? Like what the fuck ubi? 
---
"can't wait to stomp on all the secure noobs..."
---
In reality the pros should be the ones playing every game type, running secure strats at a high level in ranked can be devastating ie taking billiards first on coastline and opening it up. It FORCES people to play differently. Running bomb strats in secure has the SAME effect ie taking upstairs first on kafe, opening things up and using miras and all kinds of other shitty bullshit to fuck with the already unsuspecting attackers.
---
Bomb players who are going to talk shit, cool, you got your way, but let's see you achieve the same rank you have in bomb by playing both secure AND bomb. The sword cuts both ways.  I have achieved diamond on Xbox by playing both game types and it is ten times more fun then just playing one or the other. If anything make it mandatory to play both? 
---
Anyway fuck you ubi, you fucking suck, fix MnK cheating on console, make cheating and glitching easily reportable and actually do something about it, fix the damn issues you should have fixed day one.
---
Yeah and deployable shields and claymores are also temporarily removed
---
Why don't you equip these two  recruits with new guns?Why are you so lazy? You don't even need new recruits  after that？
---

You know that's actually how you're meant to run with a rifle, with it pointed upwards in one hand to maintain safe muzzle awareness.
---
Yea I have been having trouble finding ranked matches as well.

I know right, lol

Hacked cameras are still thermal. No reason why they shouldn’t see her since you can still see her heat signature

have you done an AMA yet or something like that yet cause i want to know more
---
r/woosh
---
doing us a favor
---
Its supposed to be a joke and I hope people get it
---
How so? Bomb only is a great change to force people to actually play the game mode Siege is balanced around and pick ban was a long time coming and adds another layer of depth to the game. I don't see how this is anything other than a step in the right direction.
---
um im kinda out of the loop, wtf is wrong now?
---
She was never playable. Kappa
---
I love this. More information to the community around changes and what they are looking at is great news.
---
I’d like to give a big”HAHA” to the idiots who said disabling Clash/Deployable Shields wouldn’t work &amp; to the assholes who’d constantly do them every match.
---
/now, how is a hacked mozzie drone thermal?
---
Nah, orginially I posted it because there were 6 people on one team, I didn't realize one was a duplicate. I'm not scared of plat 3s that's normally where I'm at.
---
Am I the only one upset that they are disabling Clash, but for IQ's invisibility glitch they are disabling claymores across the board?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ideally I would've liked that barbed wire get disabled for only Clash and claymores for only IQ; but I think it's unfair to disable Clash entirely for a glitch contingent on having barbed wire and then for an IQ glitch contingent on having claymores disabling them for all attacking operators. Either both operators should be disabled, or all barbed wire and all claymores disabled (the latter being a worse choice imo).
---

Pro Tip: *I'm joking*
---
I thought we were the only ones facing the trouble. But US too? What the frick man? I missed the six invitational skin because of that.
---
WHY DOES NO ONE REALIZE THAT WARDEN IS NED FLANDERS
---
I seriously don't know what you want by saying "just want to have a challenge" but also "without try harding with pro league settings". A more competitive environment could not be a better place for challenge. And hate to break it to you, but "try harding" is just an excuse when you get shit on. If you're not trying to win, go play casual. Ranked is meant to be competitive and if you're not trying hard, how do you expect a challenge?
---
Already in mega thread.
---
Haha nah I could of made it smaller but I just made this really quick.
---
It's for Overwolf, and it's made by R6Tracker
---
Neither of the two new operators have access to ACOG
---
Top floor changed alot
---
Yeah  
---
And a FACKIN GHOST, apparently
---
Yea I might just need to get used to it since I’ve been playing secure area my entire life. And it will be nice too to have defenders protecting 2 sites instead of just one
---
bagsflop that's my tag
---
A whole bunch of nokkle heads, eh?
---
Always got casual if you're into secure
---
Oh I thought you meant dokkabi hack. No clue about drones
---
It was explained to me that the strength of her ability outweighs the weakness of her fire power/ no acog. Even then, she has one of the highest rate of fire guns guns in the game plus c4 (mayne the only 3 armor that has c4)
---
As competitive as possible huh? Let's only have one map then and ban about half the operators.
---
When people do this glitch it is ruining the round for everyone, so he deserves it
---
I'm loving it, fuck secure bots
---
wtf those animations are disgusting
---
Thanks I appreciate the “compliment “
---
Kapkan is another 3 armor with c4, i believe
---
They can have fun in whatever way they want, but they can't also expect ubi to cater to them when they evidently have no idea what they're doing.
---
Some guns do use the the button, some don't when they could use it. The M4's reload uses the slide, and that gun's predecessor (M16) popularized the button in the first place.
---
🦀 🕺, no more 🛡️ glitch
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Tachanka and recruit memes aren’t funny anymore. They were mediocre back in 2014. Now they arent funny
---
Console has to wait for tomorrow sadly, at least we know it’s coming!
---
They break the game some way or another with practically every update they release.
---
I get 2 or 3 each time. When I play the enemies always get shocked by it lol. I do like to spawn kill though most don't think a frost will go for it, it seems
---
It’s so painfully mediocre not very good DPS either
---
I pushed a few teammates back, took a ban and knocked off some HP after I returned on top of a few reports. Play fair of get on those cams from the grave.
---
I don't want the last word, this isn't an open debate. It's reddit, and you reply to people who reply to you. You are beyond pathetic, thanks for conceding defeat though!
---
I mean, dont get me wrong the new walls are looking good, but it hardly counts as a new content.
---
Looks better now we can play kitchen with no problems ❤
---
I actually like favela.
---
It's confirmed that all we are getting is a map buff, reused operator abilities and reused guns. Its not looking good is all I'm saying.
---
Not for the first six episodes of the series
---
Just wait until the reveal. They haven't actually told you what the weapons are and you're crying, so maybe you give me proof (not a goofed TTS) that they AREN'T placeholders kid
---
Console is still suffering. Send help.
---
hey now, that's commissioner gordon you're talking about
---
Nah, I read the New York times article it's referencing(the second link), it's from 2015, which was prior to women actually being allowed in the Navy seals. So to me, this has to be referencing something different like support ops or something. I don't mean to be dismissive, I see your point, I just don't think those members are true seals.
---
As all things should be
---
ok, don't play ranked for the rest of today and wait for tomorrows patch to go live
---
Mucho toxico
---
then you beat a hacker.
---
You may be right in that it’s not “seals”, but there are female ops that do indeed support seals...time will tell I guess.
---
How?
---
I don't really like spawn peeks or spawn kills because I feel like it robs gameplay and adds unnecessary stress, but that's just my thoughts.
---
And yea that's because Frost's gun isn't as powerful or managable as others and she's not a huge roamer.
---
Normal, -SD, -K...
---
What’s the fourth one?
---
Should have gave her the Aug or something
---
Yes, except the Doc is only level 420, which is arguably worse
---
My condolences.
---
I am probably more so than you hoping they are placeholders so we get some actual new guns. However the deal for me to paypal you is that you gotta prove it now lol, otherwise it's just a dumb bet with some ass over the internet who knows just as much as I do. Imma leave this conversation as it stands, unless you feel like backing up your statement about placeholders I wish you a great day. Don't forget to downvote this comment tho!
---
Honestly the biggest issue with Insurgency, for me, is the lack of player base. I had the same fears you did when I first tried it out, and it's definitely a much more hardcore almost mil sim like tactical game, whereas siege is still relatively fast paced. If you and your team don't use smoke grenades multiple times every single push, you will be annihilated by snipers and campers, you have to be super tactical and coordinated and with random teammates that isn't always a thing that happens. 
---
I've put like 100 hours into it since it came out in December and the gameplay itself is a ton of fun imo. The biggest issue is that the playerbase is so small so you're almost always playing with the same people, and queue times are annoying as fuck. I had to go back to Siege because in Siege you almost never wait more than a minute to find a match, whereas every insurgency Queue is a 1-5 minute affair. And that's just for casual, ranked is virtually nonexistent, you have to queue for like 15 minutes sometimes and who wants to go through that.  The other major issue is optimization, the game just doesn't run well on anything less than top of the line GPUs. I have an r9 390 and I get like 60-90 FPS max with all my setting on low/medium.
---
For $30 I think it's absolutely worth it if you like tactical shooters and realistic gameplay, but it can be really frustrating and unforgiving, so much moreso than in Siege. Playing Insurgency is what my friends and I jokingly call "PTSD simulator 2019". It really is a good role playing game if you want to roleplay as a faceless grunt on a battlefield. The sound design is terrifying, artillery rains down around you and every explosion from grenade to RPG to missile strikes will make your ears ring and disorient you. It's insanely impressive how great the sound design for each weapon is. It's honest to god scary sometimes when you're trying to hold an obj angle and explosions and gunfire are going off, friendlies are dropping like flies and you're trying to squint through smoke and fog to survive. 
---
It's chaotic and brutal, and it's very realistic in the sense that 1-2 bullets from pretty much any gun will kill you, no matter where you get hit. 3 if you have armor. Explosions have a realistic radius, so good luck trying to survive if one lands anywhere near you, even if it isn't cooked. It's a very, very unforgiving game, but I've had so much fun with it, just the atmosphere of the game is what I find to be really entertaining, so even if I'm getting slaughtered it's a lot of fun.
---
Do you have a source for that? All ive seen is they use FN five sevens, glock 17s, and some sig Sauer p226s
---
Lmao I always do that and never catch it
---
It's the natural result of Ubi giving defenders Maestro, Echo, Valk, Mozzie, and deployables in addition to default cams.
---
It seems Ubi has a bad habit of building up a certain meta and then having to release operators who exist soley to counter it.
---
Same thing happened with the trap meta and the following release of Lion &amp; Finka.
---
I mean technically you could say IQ does not need a gun either, as she already has a killing tool that never loses reception, however I think most people would agree that taking away her gun would make her a far less effective operator.
---
I wasn't for it at the start but after 40 times I joined it. I am really good with her gun. One of my favorites.
---
Honestly I feel like they shouldn’t release any new maps till they have reworked all the casual maps to be in tune with the meta.
---
Glaz used to be blue?
---
I can guarantee you that the people you see on this subreddit here are the minority. People who are so interested in the game, that they regularly talk about it and inform themselves about it constantly.
---
The majority are casual players who rarely voice their opinion, if at all, online.
---
I know ddos and stuff but whats lag switching? Heard first time...
---
Arguably the worst shotty too lol
---
As I said, I play on console and the glitching is rampant. Do you play on console? If you play on pc, this may not pertain to you. But if it wasn’t that big a problem, do you think Ubisoft would take gadgets out that are CRUCIAL to gameplay out just to divert the issue temporarily? We may not have exact information but obviously Ubisoft also think it’s pretty bad or they wouldn’t have made a statement about it. And they would have that information to make a informed decision sir.
---
The mpx animation looks pretty weird, I'm still hopeful these are placeholders.
---
hostag screm
---
Deserved
---
Downvoted 🙂 have a nice day (ps you're still wrong)
---
The best way to go
---
Yeah I was sorting by new and have been for a while, thank you tho
---
This game is easy just map is the problem all players just look in the face
---
Probably, since this GIGN operator carries two standard gadgets and can't extend the shield.
---
&gt; Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about. At all. 
---
Because your experience is different? Or do you have any hard proof? You are one player in a specific part of the world. Your experience is not shared by everybody. What I am seeing is the usual outrage from the hardcore community you always get. And when this happens people always cry "Game is dead!" Eve Online for example has been dying for the last 10 years...
---
Yes actually, but coding might be a cunt. Idk how exactly it would work. And moving it around might be a bit weird
---
The guns are placeholders
---
SEA PC and no problems.
---
Lol on console the invisible glitch was around for a decade in chimera
---
Nøkk lookin' like she needs 5 more infinity stones
---
I wish her gadget was more useful. It's just so lackluster and not that useful against better players normally
---
hes been a 2/2 for a while now
---
No. I am simply not joining an outraged mob but look at the situation less emotional. Obviously people already gathering their pitchforks dislike that.
---
Emerged from yesterday? This shits been going on
---
Can we agree that the skins are really cool? Especially for a default version?
---
Hello Jl2409226, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpn0vg/i_feel_like_i_ubi_should_focus_all_of_their/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I used mine on echo and ela just awhile ago. I think it's for those ops that are able to do the glitch.
---
Not invincible, I've seen one killed after getting stuck in a frostmat.
---
He looks like Joaquin Phoenix in 'Her'
---
Here I thought that I was the only one who called it that
---
i bet echo and maestro mains want to kill themselves without deployable shields
---
Definetly not
---
IQ's claymore is temp removed and deployable shields are also temp removed. 
---
Console will get the update tomorrow
---
PS4 player here. I quit playing in January and picked up overwatch instead as I’d been playing siege since day one and needed something different. 
---
Decided to boot up good old siege this week and noticed this in every game. My buddy and I were trying to figure out why they have clash such an insanely OP buff and then realized it was a glitch. 
---
We ended up going back to overwatch after playing 2 hours with only 1 or 2 fair games.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Or, you know, fix the bugs
---
Then get over it lmao
---
Like I said they need a different rank for secure or just leave it. Who was it hurting keeping it in? Make everyone happy by not taking away game modes people enjoy
---
...who is it?
---
Most pros still use the SMG-11. In fact I’ve never seen anyone use the handgun in PL. That’s a doubt from me, dude.
---
Making the whole Rainbow Is Magic playlist takes more work (which only last for 2 weeks) than making Nokk and Warden. (which will probably last for another 5 years)
---
This looks like a Half-life animation with how alive and fluid it is. Definitely wanna see more updates like this!
---
Xd got me haha n1 fat boi
---
Why did I fully expect Skyrim to start playing after you got flashed tho.....?
---
Open up the door!
---
Damn straight I can't help myself. You're in no position to talk about personal attacks as your last message contained one as well. I play a lot of siege as well; a shit ton. Although I don't stream, so good for you. I've been here since day one. I've seen everything there is to see so far. I understand these things which is why I understand that a little advantage for Glaz, an operator that's been here since the start, with an advantage that's been here from the start, who is also getting nerfed in the coming season, on a map that is no longer in ranked, is a miniscule problem
---
I expected either Smoke, Castle, Montagne, Tachanka, Buck, or Echo.
---
Lol if they gave her Vigil's gun those people that are already complaining about her being "Vigil on attack" would complain even more. I think maybe they should buff the FMG 9 even more apart from adding the new scope considering it's underpicked anyway, though I do think if she had to have a SMG, something like the PDW9 or even the MP5SD wouldn't been better.
---
Deployable shields are still in, at least in casual.
---
Imagine playing a game when you don’t have fun... yikes. If you play cuz you think your gonna go pro or something just stop now while your ahead bud
---
They're bot getting nerfed 
---
Its just a glitch and they're holding the gadgets and clash until fixed
---
im so proud of this community
---
Read the other reply then read what I said
---
Smurfs having "fun" while re-ranking by surrendering the game after flexing.
---
Lol at him claiming his ‘friend’ is a pro and says it’s unusable considering every pro uses the SMG-11 just fine. It was horrible for a short while, but now it’s pretty controllable.
---
I agree with that, but I guess we can't stop ubi now .
---
i get some strong Commissioner Gordon vibes
---
This is a great response. Well done to everybody involved.
---
Definitely that too

---
oh didn't know that thanks
---
I do agree with you that the ranked changes and map reworks are quite good additions to the game. However I just think that the new operators are quite lazy. Yes we do have some operators that are variants of each other (like you said Thermite and Hibana) but between those two operators there is quite a big difference. (Hibana allowing hard breach from a distance and generally making it more safe to hard breach for the payoff that her gadget affects a smaller area, whereas Thermite you are quite exposed while activating your gadget but are able to breach a bigger area). However Nokk is VERY similar to Vigil, with both of their abilities being a single button press gadget that grants a form of 'invisibility' from cameras for a short duration of time, without any noticeable trade offs/ pros and cons like the ones that Thermite and Hibana have.
---
i think i need an mri i might have cancer
---
This is fake right
---
Pro League rules, pick and ban, bomb only.
---
lol OK
---
But still hes a 1 speed defender without acog and dogshit guns and situational ability that relies on the enemy using their utility in a way you can utilize it.
---
Why are claymores banned?
---
Warden behind a Mira window or that new shield could be crazy strong. His MPX fits that sort of role too like the Vector where they are headshot machines.
---
Yes, only bomb!
---
without nerfing BB
---
If they had different guns (semi-auto DMR + shotgun for Nokk and PDR-C + folding gun for Warden) they'd probably get less shit.
---
yeah. she has arguably the best gadget in the game so people who get headshots/have good aim pick valk and it pays off tremendously. vs picking an op with a slightly better gun. the gadget + c4 + 3 speed makes it worth practicing with her to get headshots because it benefits the whole team.
---
and it’s quite the lip tickler too
---
Exactly, less balanced. The whole fucking game relies on being balanced to be any fun, bomb is the most balanced and as a result more fun and competitive. It's a competitive game, if you don't want to play a competitive game competitively then play something else and stop making people who are actually taking the game seriously play unbalanced and non competitive modes.
---
I’m the opposite I love playing sledge so I just whack Maestros cams
---
I have player numbers for Steam alone on PC who did not show any specificly heavy decline. Doubtful on consoles everybody jumped off.
---
It did seem to go very long
---
Yeah but sometimes people don’t want to be sweaty tryhards and but still don’t want to play shitty casual. CONSTANT GRIEFING AND LEAVING make it not as enjoyable as ranked ironically

It was a claymore glitch for invisible IQ, I haven't seen anything about drones.
---
Yup, that would be the best compromise
---
confirmed new attachments for the fmg and d-50 which are being reused on nokk scares me
---
This wasn't that hard to find.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l1f-gctwxVo

yup, like how capi got the new m249 scope
---
As a Tachanka main thats all i wish for 😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
Good move from Ubi, can finally stop team killing again....
---
I hope the load-out with mpx was fake, it's ok just with Valkyrie and with his 21 damage per bullet on a few m of distance.
---
When will they announce the free weekend?Really wanna buy the game on PC as I just shifted from console.
---
THIS! would be a awesome ability.
---
Fake your enemies out and then raise form the dead.
---
Well he is level 170 so not to long
---
I love favela lol. It’s fun running a shotty as bandit or mute
---
Mission successful.
---
That logic doesn't work because Mira and Tachanka don't have ACOGs
---
Maybe take a nap?
---
OMG I thought I was the only one who thought that too!
---
I really hope ur right
---
No you can’t. That just disables maps for terrorist hunt

Going to o be in some "One in a lifetime pt. X" on YouTube. What a luck.😂

I’m not mad I god black ice for the fmg 9 a while back

Option D - He's hiding from an angry Thatcher

Thats because you cant see it ;)

Nice try what?

Pls fix quick i cant play ranked like this
---
Outback is balanced and a great map
---
Lol you're literally pathetic. You can't counter anything because you know deep down I'm right, you're acting like an entitled bitch but can't admit it. Maybe delete your dumbass post?
---
The game is literally balanced around bomb, its the most balanced ie the most competitive gamemode. It isn't an opinion to say that bomb is the most competitive game mode, it's a statement of fact.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpjqss/051619_live_exploits_update/
---
They're doing it right now. Get fucked mate 😂😂😂😂
---
Suppressed Deagle? What sorcery is this!
---
Yeah, they made it James Bond-ish. Good job Ubi! :)
---
A reminder that Ubi has IQ and Alibi using pistols not available to them in their artwork, and IQ's video has her using a shotgun that only the FBI has access to in game. Also Thatcher did not originally have a shotgun on release. They do this a lot, even with their offical media.
---
Yah ubi dont be like that we got solution u f***
---
Which is still possible
---
FBI ?
---
Yeah but in mobas, most heros of the same class have distinct and different abilities and stats, whereas Vigil and Nokk are literally the same "press gadget button for invisibility from camera" operators.
---
I mean I'm looking forward to Nokk but find her loadout lackluster but I do have black Ice for the FMG-9 so at least it's got that going for it.
---
I hope if these are final ubi explain the reason behind not adding in new guns, I wana believe they're just placeholders.
---
Hope this is going to be right.

Ranked isn't the for fun playlist, it's the competitive one. Don't play ranked if you won't play competitively.
---
It's sad they gave him an MPX. Now we have 2 people with pea shooters on the defending team.
---
Lmao you think that's from Ubi.
---
[removed]
---
I like the potential for baiting that this idea has. Freeze while you’re on it, then just wait somewhere else for them to catch the bait
---
😂😂😂😂
---
This is beautiful
---
Because ranked is the best game mode. Casual doesn't feel competitive or challenging and t-hunt is boring. People trying to rank up by the end of the season don't want to encounter glitchers because it ruins the game and they end up in a worst place than they were before
---
Hope there is still old school ranked. Constant bomb sucks.
---
Advanced Droning is a whole control scheme. Would screw up players more to disable that. I'd imagine they wanted to remove the Claymore from all ops just in case it was possible with others.
---
A small price to pay for salvation.

---
This cosplay looks exactly like my gf
---
No, her Claymore count will just stay at 0.
---
It is.. a little bit sad to me.. Not gonna lie.   
---
Thing with having to go casual to play secure or hostage, I'll find myself stacked with/against golds/plats (or even silver sometimes) that will decimate me..   
---
And that's really no fun.  
---
Rank was a way to play against high copper/bronze (even though y'know, smurfs and weird matchmaking """were""" a thing...) and have more balanced experience in game modes that were realistically funnier to me..   
---
I really hope that "simplifying" those modes will have a absolute effect of making thei matchmaking more efficient by also simplifying their algorithms or whatever manages this part of the game..
---
Love how they're showing off, hope they'll do that for next operations as well.
---
On Xbox most definitely as every game I’ve risked playing over he past few days in plat the bugs have been abused relentlessly, pc the clash bug has been remedied by removing her however the shield glitch and the iq glitch are still there and being abused heavily, again in the plat ranks.
---
However by this evening clash, claymores and shields will be removed on both console and pc.
---
People think Clash is op? 
---
Allow me to lul
---
Warden is eeasily my favorite character from looks alone. Doesm' hurt he's from Freedomland either
---
It isn't an opinion to say bomb is the most competitive game mode, it is an statement of fact. The entire game is balanced around bomb and as a result bomb is the most competitive game mode. It would be instead like saying call of duty is a competitive game when it in fact, isn't. You can like the casual game modes, that's why casual is there.
---
How could you forget the Lord?
---
It’s camouflage not intimidation.
---
Am I the only here that thinks Nokks loadout is more suitable for a defender then an attacker? An attacker with no AR or LMG just seems weird to me given the last three years of operators.
---
Well alibi is holding a pistol in her splash art but she has 2 revolvers
---
I knew I wasn’t the only one who saw this resemblance
---
"Won't another ops gun" was that english...orrr...?
---
Also a pinned post by the devs
---
Well there is a solution but Microsoft and Sony won't do it. Make it to when certain games like Siege are booted up you can't use the USB ports. They can't use the adapters if they are locked out of the USB's
---
As said in another comment: Glaz downs all enemies in 2 hits apart from 3-Armor + Rook armor. 
---
He doesn't Need more damage, but he COULD receive some additional mag
---
Christ is ubisoft incompetent or something? They constantly leak their own stuff to the point where it's weird if there aren't leaks.
---
That too
---
You never know. He was exploiting the IQ hack so I shot his claymore then he team killed me. Some people 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
God I hope these people get console banned /ip banned for cheating
---
This post is sponsored by the Gotham City Police Department.
---
Yay no more solo queue ranked !
---
i mean ive played games on pc before, so when you see the really smooth movement you idk kinda just 'know'. I usually message them nice k&amp;m just to piss them off and well yup then it confirms it if they dont deny it and say it ok to use it
---
Yea the glitch is perfectly balanced indeed...
---
With it being a teaser it is something that is soon to Come out teasing stuff like what he does and his equipment If he has the mpx in his teaser it is pretty confirmed that one of his Guns that you can chose from is gonna be the mpx
---
Xbox is fucking trash with its bans. It'll start costing them customers eventually.

---
"Beta"
---
Inaccurate, where are the toxic t-baggers?
---
This thot did this every round plus shield glitching with jaegar
---
Oof, I don't like the forced Bomb.
---
We were 3-1 up in a Ranked game and someone on the other team started exploiting the Clash &amp; IQ glitch every round to bring it back to 4-3 to them. we clawed it back to 4-4, they were on defence the last round so we knew we were going to be facing Clash, me and my mate took Sledge &amp; Buck and bombarded her with grenades, got the kill and won the game.
---
Cheaters never prosper.
---
&gt;No one thinks the MP5k is good
---
That's where you're wrong
---
And Mute got the smg-11 because the dev team wanted his pickrate to go up without breaking him by making unnecessary buffs.
---
It might be weak for an attacker but it's absolutely not for a defender.

it’s not even a global ability this time, so idk what you’re talking about?
---
Everybody upvote this guy, instead of banning the operators just ban the gadgets. THATS ALL!
---
Noted. Thank you.
---
Manners. Maketh. Man.
---
I would assume it’s because of the Russian map, and it’s not really Kapkan and fuse, it’s just the spetznaz unit fighting an enemy. They probably had an idea of maps with specific character models like in CS and then scrapped it in favor of unique character designs and gadgets, to distance themselves from any other FPS shooter(mainly CS). It’s amazing how much this game actually changed from the original design and desire from Ubisoft. I can’t remember the YouTubed but someone made a really good video about it going into details. Anyway, this game has grown despite some major setbacks(Lion, blitz, these new glitches) GLHF
---
Damn, they really missed the chance for a run down house in swampy/marsh like area for Nøkk..
---
Ok. I haven't played siege in about a year. I know they recently implemented a new friendly fire system because people complained about the old system. 
---
My question is does it still ban you eventually for doing too much friendly fire damage OR they gave players the choice to retaliate now?
---
Yeah of course they do? Nøkk was modelled after these guys.
---
Thanks for this Ubi, I think this at least shows that this could hopefully take effect even faster in the future if any more issues like these occur.
---
Nooo :c

Dude, what. Am I the only one who likes Secure anymore? And now whenever I play Ranked I’m going to have to end up being the last one watching two bombs(And I don’t usually play characters that can make rotation holes). Great.
---
I's say give her Smokes/Flashes
---
They probably got rid of her Frags for good reason
---
No it's not that logical. 
---
First, there are many ways to balance a new operator without breaking the norms. Why removing an essential feature of the attackers: acog? Imo giving her fmg-9 with its crappy dps is already a big trade-off, maybe a little too much. 
---
Second, you're implying that a not-yet-released operator is powerful, which is very subjective. How many times was it that this sentence has been said?
---
Never seen her real face though so maybe she is cute.....
---
They've been doing it in pro league for years, the highest level of professional play 😂. Stop pretending you know more than the devs, dumbass.
---
I just feel like a lot of people use it as an excuse when they die to a player genuinely better than them. Technically speaking everything that's possible with K&amp;M on console is possible with a controller, it would just take a hell of a lot of practice.
---
Take Fortnite for example, standard set up to be good at that is K&amp;M, yet there are some monsters with controllers. 
---
Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, you might be able to detect it easier than me, but I just think a lot of people are far too quick to label someone a cheater.
---
Child. Thanks for playing

No! Why spaghetti. Can it be Greek salad?

You really are missing brain cells. They dont take it out of the game you illiterate fuck. They just cant use it. Jesus christ. People like you shouldnt be allowed to breed. We dont a generation like you running the country in 30 years.

I'm also not a fan of this change. Solo bomb is terrible.

Not really.

He's not being toxic, he's being practical.
---
PREPPING NOODLES!
---
-Noodle Chef Lesion(elite guess)
---
Technically yes. Ash once had an ACOG on the R4C so she's not alone.
---
This.
---
He was trying to become invisible
---
It WAS bug fixes, but after y4, it is not related since design team and bug fixes team and balancing team are all different.
---
The grenades belongs to capi
---
Alibi is holding a gun she doesn’t have access to in one of her trailers
---
https://twitter.com/rainbow6game/status/1129040814808752130?s=21
---
I dont think you know what toxic means...
---
Yeah but Ash is Y1S1 operator that still has ACOG on her worse weapon . Damn Ubi
---
Absolutely worthy it!
---
I thought you were saying Gordon Freeman b4 I saw the pic
---
Eh... i like the idea of it. I would move her up my tier list
---
New guns Irrelevant to me, since gadgets matter more, and fmg primary means I have a reason to get the liquid skin.
---
You are bad guy, but this does not mean you are bad guy
---
probably bc Lesion is really popular op and more people will buy his elite than say, smoke
---
Exactly! We don't really know who he/she really is!
---
Am I the only one that has never encountered any of the glitches?
---
That's a yikes from me dawg.
---
Heheheheheheh
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
I mean he also has an SMG-12 and a shotgun so the best loadout probably won't end up using the MPX anyway.
---
Tk'd someone who was doing the glitch with clash. Then enemy team praises you :D
---
Oh I know. I did for a little while when I started bc everyone was so much better than me. But after a while of playing bomb I like it. For me it's more exciting. Especially post plant.
---
I do because i play with alot of toxic ppl
---
Damn love it
---
Until I see it at Milan, I am not forming any opinion.
---
But if I absolutely have to, I'd say it doesn't bother me. Fmg is ok. Smg12 on a 3 armour is **hell yeah!**
---
I bought every season pass so far and I couldnt give less fucks about recycled guns
---
Clash has m4 mags on her rig
---
Yeah agreed.
---
Harry's dad?
---
Dude IQ is big and chunky Gachi
---
The problem here is not that your arguments are invalid but that this descision excludes a lot of people who have developed a preference for SA in the last 4 years. As of right now it seems to be over night aswell.   
---
Why not just tell the community that you are going to steer the ranked game mode towards bomb in the future but still give people the option to play SA?
---
Will you take care of reported players? That’s the question. Maybe you should ban ´em.
---
It's been current pool + new map for a while know, in this case nothing changes because Kafe was already in but the seasons after will see the new maps added into ranked.
---
New maps are part of the ranked pool so the meta around them will actually develop and because there is a large percentage that refuses to play casual but since introducing this I don't think they've ever changed the pool like they at least seemed they were going to if not actually said as such.
---
I don't think it should be a vote, they should just be removed after 5 minutes.
---
Lmao same!
---
You are very good man
---
*Bandit intensifies*
---
Oi swag-7
---
Valkyrie needs no buffs. If you think even 2 or 3 damage is not much, it is.
---
Valk doesn't need a buff. Either guve warden a new gun, or let it be. Valk is already the most versatile Intel op on defense. A buffed gun is definitely not needed.
---
I'd love a hi-res scan of this masterpiece
---
Short shorts with socks and sandles
---
You're not a good man, you're a Hero
---
How did you do the white lines in her hair? Every time I do water color, shit goes everywhere.
---
Valkerye... You're a good man... Thank you
---
Damn is it just me or do barricades look different?
---
There was nothing about visual changes in the patchnotes...
---
YES
---
I'm all for it, but at the same time, bomb is the only balanced mode.
---
Not on pc either. However taking advantage of a glitch is not really cheating sadly. There is no report cheat button by the way only a toxic one which is not cheating.
---
Finally, a menu screen i can actually get behind great!
---
Idk, I rarely shoot teammates, and I've never tk'd so many that I got kicked :&lt;
---
i can't play bomb in ranked, I always playing secure area. it's just too hard for me and my friend play to duo on bomb. I mean duo because most of players I met in ranked don't even have micro
---
Yeah sure, and giving her an indestructible Blackbeard shield would also make her better. Doesn't mean we should do that.
---
She's fine where she is, why are we focused on her when we have operators like Fuze- who are desperately in need of a buff.
---
plsno
---
If you do not count Blitz &amp; Montagne, then it's true.
---
Yeah. That’s why I said the server you’re playing on OR the country you’re in.
---
Sound rework is planned in y4.
---
The entrance looks kinda like the ching chong maps

Hello RJSSJR123, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bppfgp/temp_ban_everyone_who_did_the_iq_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah, i rarely do it too. And bare in mind that was pure bad luck that I tk'd the guy 3 times. Rarely happens, but still it would be nice if the guy forgived you would not get kicked.
---
An acog on the mpx would be insane. It's already a laser beam
---
This could be distracting, activating it would be much better, imagine going down the hallway with a fuckton of Cam FOVs blocking the view in the hallway
---
But why don't let them have a tradeoff of 1 less op or wait?
---
That's three stripes and very racist against slavs
---
Yeah. Idk what made them replace Bartlett with Favela.
---
What this guy said.
---
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
The only audio I have issues with is Maverick's torch
---
Yea it sucks ass lol hopefully its fixed by tomorrow
---
You're a good man, thank you
---
Probably a sight (no magnification).
---
Scopes have magnification.
---
Why next kapkan?
---
Not all hero's wear capes some looking you
---
He has a BP vest underneath his shirt
---
Best one yet!!! Jk jk sarcasm obviously
---
Ranked needs balance. You can't have the mode be fundamentally imbalanced.
---
Bomb is the only fundamentally balanced mode. Which is why PL is bomb only. Which is why it will be the future of siege, as ubi said ages ago.
---
I'm happy with this change. Promotes balance.
---
Because they are both creepy as fuck
---
Would still see more in this than we did in that night battle in GoT this season
---
I miss caps grenades. If they aren’t going to give him any breaching capabilities he should be able to go full frag especially since his guns are ass
---
Will i find some angry Glaz mains, that got nerf cuz of Warden?
---
Well it is still a different weapon right? These are just the exact same weapons.
---
why doesnt black ice melt
---
They are Danish, right?
---
I love it when this toxic community can work together to stop the garbage! It’s a beautiful thing!
---
The real question is... Do you still get your gold charm?
---
I have this vision where I just run yelling wololololo like spongebob and then running face first into a wall and die
---
What map is it?
---
That’s a drone for us
---
I genuinely can't understand why this has so many upvotes. So instead of fixing the problem on a fundamental level, you want to just ignore the problem exists by swapping claymores for frags? How about when another game-breaking glitch comes along involving claymores? Do the same thing for that operator, too? I'm really glad, or I really hope, you don't work for a gaming company.
---
Fucklesion
---
Diamond redcrow, plat 1 windbastion. Currently due queing with my gold/silver friend doing stupid loadouts or using a controller (irl friends) so this season has been a mess lmao
---
You do realise Ubisoft can stop that they chose which operators get which.
---
Leak said it was supposed to be a P90SD
---
So maybe to equal it out is to make him a 2 speed 2 armor operator? Make him a tiny bit faster? For his role he needs to move quickly.
---
Same but I have no issues
---
{-}7
---
The loadouts HAVE to be placeholders, they can't give one of the worse defender weapons to an attacker without even an ACOG.
---
No it's season 5 Walter White
---
Eh, its looks a little claustrophobic now while the kitchen is massive. Still, enjoy this rework more than what ever they're doing to my poor boy kanal. If you're gonna kill the entire map, give us a way to play it in custom games.
---
Don't spoil please
---
Good work m8. They Ruin the Game for everybody.

Nice job.. i loved how you captured the angry in their eyes...

You can buy them for 25,000 renown each 1 week after release. Paying real life money is 100% optional in this game as all content (minus a few cosmetics like elite skins, and the alpha packs we get in events but even then you get some of them for free) can be unlocked with ingame currency.
---
25,000 renown doesn't take that long to get and as long as you have all the operators, you should be able to buy the 2 new ops every season with no problem
---
To be fair, they come from these units, so it makes sense they have their weapons.
---
i supose my comment might come across as incorrect, i had meant that there arent any, not that they arent allowed in
---
What are you even talking about? xD
---
I dont know!  Maybe they are gonna expand their data soo!
---
u/jewslayr, you’re a good man. Thank you.
---
They have more spray paint on them but I personally like it.
---
Excellent man. Everyone should have been doing that once these issues we're found again.
---
I am still switching, i'd only play to get money for Warden bcs he is the only defender i  want to buy (i don't like Vigil, Maestro nor Mozzie.)
---
I'm honestly fine with not having new guns, as long as they can put more work into debugging and tweaking the game in a positive way.
---
My buddy got reported to PSN for sending “Fuck you” messages to all glitch users we came across
---
I feel like ubisoft has gotten lazy
---
Carefully, he's a hero
---
Your actions are those of a good man but your user name....
---
Thank god I can still go into the back room and beat my meat
---
Were they actually doing the glitch or did you just assume because they took those characters?
---
I agree, it also negates the issue with balancing the weapons. Would like to see a little more variety of sub machine guns on the attack though, just a personal preference for me though lol
---
The wasn't even far the barrel was literally inside her lol.

I agree, I started playing back in Skull Rain and I still think issues from back then weren't even fixed.
---
I dont have problem whit reused guns only i expect more even whit this cool operators maybe they will reveal the new guns in sunday and this are only placeholders so lets have hope!
---
I think that they are more creative than this and can find new guns to implement into the game
---
You did outstanding, that exploit us not at all fair.
---
Maybe they have 2 different primaries and they only showed one in the trailer that's already in game so their second primaries are new
---
I understand where your coming from, but I disagree.
---
*polar Express intensifies*
---
U was bad guy but does not mean u was bad guy
---
I'm not a fan of the new 1st floor because of exactly that; it feels like a damn maze. The kitchen is a whole lot less defendable now too.
---
No it's real man, I've seen it happen, was killed by an invisible IQ and the kill cam showed them outside
---
Mute is one of my favorite operators
---
Maybe but for the pistol I thought they could have done more with them like have warden with a glock
---
I understand I guess that what I’m missing. I was more focused on the click and bang every defined who is moving is on your screen. By changing it this way I thought it be more interact rather than make him a run and gun operator. I don’t use him but guess he could be used in a way you describe for some people.
---
The game is a cq game
---
I understand it would need licensing
---
Ye I'm hoping I'm correct though

Hello invalidchaingaming, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpq1e5/people_that_use_glitches_in_this_game_and_others/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Clash is gay so you’re fine
---
The more playlists the more they split up the community. Splitting up the communty is bad. Most noticeable on the queue times. Ranked was split up in secure,hostage, bomb, casual and ranked but now that there is only bomb left in ranked you only have casual and ranked players which should overall make queue times a lot quicker. Also diamond secure area only are by far different players than diamond bomb players so now your rank should actually show your skill cuz there is just one mode to get your rank
---
You’ll be happy to hear that Ubi disabled Clash, IQ, and Deployables until the glitches are fixed.
---
I like what they did here. This is much better than what they did with Hereford. Still wish they'd add back the original Hereford map, but... oh well.
---
you are very good man everyone who agrees salutes to you
---
Smoke grenades are extremely useful. I see them used quite a bit in a ying/glaz push to OBJ.
---
Yes.
---
The sad part is that they did they because you started reinforcing a wrong wall or just your level was too low to them
---
I caught a jager doing the shield glitch and spawn peaking and I nearly threw up from the shear amount of toxicity radiating off of him, I of course team killed him and left the game shortly afterwards
---
Can you please fix the blurry screen issue that came after Y4S1.2 patch for the 1366x768 and 1600x900 resolutions? I've already contacted the support and they told me one month ago that they're investigating the issue but nothing happened and the closed my case ! I even told them what exactly is the bug cause to make it easier to fix
---
No, This is Patrick.
---
I don't understand how people are calling Ubisoft lazy. They try to base their guns off real weapons. Do people not understand that there are only a certain amount of modern weapons here in the real world?
---
Ill say first pve dlc. Thunt is more like a warm up.
---
Did they really? I'd heard that some people wanted it, but I never thought they'd actually do it
---
Castle
---
Thank you
---
People are mainly angry because they gave the new ops bad guns. Nobody would be disappointed if warden got an mp5 acog and nokk got an mp7. Plus if their focus next season is to fix the game, then why release 2 ops with lackluster guns. Just give us op health 2 and nobody would be angry because we got no ops, as long as they're fixing the game the playerbase would be satisfied.
---
What? We have already seen ut in action

---
ok so then what was the point of commenting if you just want to quit anyway
---
I'm pretty sure they have to get a lot of reports in like a certain amount of time or it just does nothing on console. I could be wrong though
---
This whole Y4 is a recycle with map rework and now gun reusing, M249 has introduced it slowly
---
And what about someone is using external hard drive ?
---
Ok. 
---
It all started on Kafe 
---
Our Buck opened the front entrance and I saved him from Kapkan, but Valk ran out and killed him, but I killed her too. 
---
Then, I went up to the walkway near study and placed a Claymore at the window near the balcony and Cav jumped into it and I killed her. 
---
By this time, it's a 3v2 with my team consisting of Ash, Glaz (my friend), and Ying (me). And the enemies consisting of Bandit and Rook
---
I down rook but Ash doesn't kill him (knowing that I'm going for the Ace) but Glaz and Her are killed by Bandit and Rook is revived. 
---
I go up the window that Cav ran out and Bandit is waiting for me. I just start randomly shooting in his direction until he walks into my bullets and dies. (I have 12 health)
---
Rook blows up the Closet wall and doesn't have enough time to pull his gun and I kill him.
---
K Mr.Grammar
---
true but they prob made it cbrn because of outbreak
---
Careful he's a hero o7
---
It's better than before at close range because of the damage buff but yeah, the recoil is a lot worse

Best way to do it is use mute and presidential plane meeting room and just get headshots behind the chair.

I like her guns

What map?

Invisibility glitch

You are a bad guy, but that doesn't mean you are a bad guy!

Problem is that the loadouts ended up being all over the place. Like Warden got the MPX but somehow the D-50 ended up in Nokk's hands ? If anything, Warden should have "US" loadout (Service secret) and Nokk could have something around GSG9/SAS. They re-used GIGN/Spetznaz weapons, might as well do the same thing for other "vanilla" weapons/ctus.
---
Nokk : AR33, FMG-9, P-10C.
---
Warden : MPX, M1014, 5.7 USG, D-50. 
---
The AR33 is an ok AR and would fit Nokk enough to not be "broken" or "a must pick" seeing she seems to has a pretty good gadget. No reason to give her US loadout when she isn't from there at all, I don't understand. I mean, we have literally guy coming from the US but doesn't even use US loadout aside from the MPX. I don't think she needs a shotgun at all + I initially thought of GSG9 loadout but that'd make her a bit more powerful than planned. (M870 rush anyone ?)
---
Nah
---
More like a Jame Bond vibe, but physically he would be more of a kingsman indeed.
---
I wish he had new weapons.
---
Yah
---
Universal weapon skins are also made with the fmg9 as a placeholder. I mean the defender has clash’s pistol, which surely isn’t intentional.
---
Ubisoft usually split weapon types available to Attackers and Defenders. Sometimes they share options, but usually have different choices. 
---
Attackers are meant to be the only ones who receive DMRs, LMGs and assult guns, whereas Defenders have SMGs. 
---
The balancing of the game works so the defenders always have worse guns with reduced range. This can be seen comparing Ying and Lesions primary shotgun for example. Similarly Sledge and Thatcher get ARs, wheres Smoke and Mute get SMGs. 
---
There are exceptions, such as Maestro. However this is otherwise the rule - and the new operators guns are both used by Defenders in the game. She has no attacker loadout
---
_DESTRUCTION 100_ . I appreciate smart answers, even against me :))
---
This will probably get removed. Its got the witch-hunting all over it. Dont let people ruin your day. If you get tkd just leave. If i get shot i turn and kill the one who shot me if i can so they cant play the round then i leave. (Unless it was clearly an accident, teabagging once is generally an im sorry bag, teabagging alot generally is a nanana thing and ill kill.)
---
bomb only game mode that's bullshit
---
On Xbox when you report for cheating it states that abusing a glitch qualifies as cheating.
---
By that reasoning, almost every operator in this game would have an mp5.
---
I really think we need to wait for her to come out before asking for buffs. She's a 3 speed attacker who isn't hindered by cameras, she has the potential to be seriously strong.
---
Fragmite
---
This. So this.  
---
It's one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in this game.
---
Don't forget that rainbow border to get attention
---
Good, now can you take video requests and ban people who cheated and bragged about it? I spent the last few days getting killed and messaged by people, multiple of who bragged about how nothing would be done about them cheating and they would get off scot-free.
---
Start perma-banning these fuckers if you have concrete proof and that might deter some of these scumbags from doing it in future.
---
It's absolutely ridiculous that they can abuse game breaking glitches, boast about it, and get away with it easily.
---
I assume you left out the part where everyone on your team shed a tear for the passing of his little, robotic friend. 
---
What a beautiful story. Bless you for sharing.

Hello Big_Fat_Ginger, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpqu0i/thatcher/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
Agreed, but some appear not to.
---
Ghost recon is developed by ubisoft Paris. I.pretty sure the Montreal team does siege, they probably are finishing watch dogs 3
---
She was a universally useful 3 speed with frags, now she's only a universally useful 3 speed without frags. Her frags gave her far too much utility.
---
Then you could say Nokk has a "nice test" on the silent moving ability mixed with being invisible to cameras and also potentially other passive abilities that we haven't been able to test in multiplayer (due to tts only being playable offline). She is new. She is different. Boy have I always wanted to surpress the deagle too.
---
They played us like a damn fiddle!
---
I’m excited too, her shotty paired with a Doki rush will be insane.
---
Isn't that mr hummus
---
Just say YES.
---
I paid for the season pass, which has always brought in new content. Don't tell me that it's justified for them to not deliver on this now because they had to borrow the dev team for something else. I want op health 2.0, but don't bait and switch me. I paid for a service, don't tell me that you can't deliver now because you sent all your workers to do something else. That makes no sense and isn't justifiable.
---
I once runed from the securimg camera and they were al coming to teamkill me so it's not a I'm sorry bag
---
MOM! No on wants to play with me......
---
This is why I quit siege. Honestly the only PvP game I play now days is for honor otherwise it's co op pve all day (spacelords vermin tide 2 payday ect) PvP is to toxic for me and if you don't play a single PvP game for a while and get good at it you have to waste time trying to get good at all at once. Basically all I'm saying is that PvP is starting to not be viable for new players soon because some people have no life and get to good at the game there is no way to win. and we need more Pve games, I honestly don't know how I strayed of topic so much from the vid but what I am saying is my opinion and I hope someone agrees
---
You are a good man 👌🏽
---
honestly I feel u man but I mean I’m kinda into the looks of the attack that’s about it
---
Xbox has screenshot and video recording capabilities
---
This seems to be the year of reversals. This season we got a trapper/barbed wire on Attack and someone with access to the standard drones on Defense. Next season we're getting Vigil/Cav on Attack, Glaz/Ying on Defense. I'm fine with this, as you've pointed out.
---
I will say this however; until the official panel, assume the weapons used are placeholders. IQ and Alibi use guns in their portraits that they have no access to. IQ uses the FBI shotgun in her Operator video. Hell if I remember right, when they added actual Operators to the old Siege boxart, a couple of the Operators again had the wrong gun. Ubi's official media tends to do this.
---
&gt;No it's not that logical. 
---
She's supposed to be a close quarters flanker. Why would you need a long range sight if you're not peeking angles?
---
&gt;First, there are many ways to balance a new operator without breaking the norms. Why removing an essential feature of the attackers: acog?
---
"The norms" make a video game repetitive and stagnant. Change keeps things fun and competitive. Besides, an acog is not "essential." It's helpful, not required.
---
What do you play on? My message is self explanatory to the mentally capable
---
I am a bit disappointed for this season for the same reason, no new weapon the unique ability are a combo of the previous we already seen but if you think about it maybe less work on the realization of new weapon, ability etc. could be healthy for the game, no new weapon could mean less bug and more effort on fixing the game issue.I agree on the FMG-9 is not a good weapon for an attacker overall but we should try her before judge, maybe her ability is strong and the weapon fit her without making her too overpower and also fit well her gamestyle, who knows?  
---
The change at the ranked are fine, with the 3 rounds rotation of attackers/defenders you must know how to attack/defend at least 3 different objective to take the absolute advantage. RN if you play 1 defense then 1 attack then 1 defense you probably play every time the same site (eg on Villa you play Aviation then attack aviation and at last you defend Trophy and then attack again aviation supposing to win 4-0) with a 3 round in a row as attacker or defender instead you play 3 different sites to take advantage on the enemy, so if you are a defender or attacker you should know how to play a 3rd site making the ranked more competitive on the tactic side.

Thanks for not crediting u/calls23

---
As I said you can only pick up guns from the enemy team! not from your own team.
---
But what about the magazines? Would you have to raid the body or would it be like call of duty where you have every mag in the world?
---
Pre built? Or did you build it?
---
&gt;If it were up to console we would have all the maps and modes in ranked
---
Any other completely unfounded claims?
---
ash kill jager yum
---
Or blame both for exploiting it
---
You would have to raid the body, having unlimited mags would be too strong for r6
---
No. I was told you were the best.
---
No console player has ever asked for the devs to take maps and modes away. That's a weird pc thing.
---
They said they didn’t due to complications
---
I agree with you.
---
They have not been disabled on PS4 yet. Just had to surrender due to this garbage.
---
I write big caplocks so I must be telling truth. Wake up sheeple.
---
Totally agree with your comment though Athe_king
---
This is also something you can see two ways. Ranked is a competitive mode OR it is a normal mode which keeps a "public record" of your performance. I'm leaning towards the latter, as most of the players even in ranked are there actually to have fun, not to win the title/championship.
---
Agreed they should be band 100% but it's also the people who choose to do the glitch should get some heat as well
---
Actually?
---
Loooool secure is just not competitive enough for ranked dude and all the maps being in ranked is bad because some of them are just terrible like imagine playing Yatch in ranked that would be hell
---
I’m a console player and completely agree that some maps simply are NOT correctly balanced for Ranked play.
---
So... Basically glaz on defense
---
Same. So stupid. Glad they are putting out a temporary fix quick because it was all cheaters last night
---
I thought I saw the deployable shield glitch the other day in a game, was pretty messed up but thought my screen had spasmed.
---
Woah
---
&gt;Hopefully more quickly
---
It's been less than a week and they've unveiled a new system implementation to remotely lock out aspects of the game and it's already live and working on the servers 
---
All in ~5 days with little to no hiccups 
---
I'd say they're working pretty quickly on this and it just shows that they're working on long term fix systems like this without letting anyone know. 
---
They're doing a great job!
---
Glad you catched that, and reading your comment, we do think alike about this.
---
You’ve done a service to all here sir. Coming from someone who used to abuse the doc glitch (I regret my decisions, I’m sorry for I hath sinned) I now think that any glitch abusers should be smited by Lord Tachanka himself.
---
Kinda what I was thinking, I got corrected by a frind of mine on Kaid aswell
---
Thanks for response. I will wait until Monday or so. But I have friends that play R6 and they said tts is working for them.
---
Yeah she was reportedly going to have a scar variant as well as a Galil. And then Warden was rumored to have an MP5 variant I believe. Sad we didn’t get those guns but still love the design of both characters
---
*What even...*
---
Not bad kid
---
General Kenobi
---
&gt;They're enemies
---
No, they're not. They're other random players who are playing this game, just like your random teammates. Again, they're playing **the game.** This is not a war. Ultimately we're just playing to have fun.
---
Nøkk is **SHE**
---
competitive enough for ranked lol, it's just a ranked mode. This isn't pro league, the mode is fine and you can get plenty of tough matches. I have great memories of Yacht in ranked.
---
This is a blatant repost, what even are the mods doing?
---
&gt; No console player has ever asked for the devs to take maps and modes away. That's a weird pc thing.
---
You simply have no idea whether or not that's true.
---
If you know anything about the game you’ll know they’re gonna play extremely different to any other operator. (Both attack and defense).
---
https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1129040814808752130?s=19
---
Would definitely murder balance. Imagine playing against a 3 armour with a vest who gets ahold of Twitch’s F2? I wouldn’t even bother pushing the objective at that point lmao.
---
Actually back in the day ranked on Yacht was pretty fun.
---
Nokk is not going to tank Valks pick rate.
---
Even if it did,[ she's currently very above average](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/dnotes4.1.3_defender_347919.png) according to the numbers
---
They’re still enemies lol. And yea I’m playing the have fun. Idc if the ENEMIES are having fun. Winning is fun to me, doesn’t matter how I win. I’m immersed into games so I don’t think of it as just a game lol
---
Doesn't matter whether or not the clock runs down, there's still gonna be that one person who takes 5 years to load.
---
You are a bold one
---
"Give me karma plz"
---
It is
---
Hold F to plant diffuser
---
Oh boy, I’m a pro league wannabe because you don’t want to play Bomb?
---
House is a bit of a shitshow, but if they made it so that you can draw a match then it would be fair. Any map would be fair if we only played 3 attack then 3 defend.
---
If this is a quick scetch, i'd love to see your dedicated art.
---
hahaha i love this
---
The thing is that Secure and Hostage are inherently uncompetitive by their design. Being ranked or not isn't what decides whether a game mode is competitive or not, it's how it plays.
---
Or would you consider House or Favela competitive maps if Ubi happened to add them to Ranked for whatever reason?
---
r/wooosh
---
Hello fellow redditor. Ignore this. I am commenting to be able to re-access this later.
---
$15 for gadget skin DLC
---
I like this theory a lot actually.
---
Currently their supposed loadouts really don't make any sense lore wise. Nokk with an SAS shotgun and smg and Warden with MPX and SMG-12
---
Typically new OP's loadout at least make a little sense lore wise like with Lion getting the French DMR because he is French and Finka getting the Russian shotgun
---
You committed crimes against Reddit and her people, what say you in your defense?
---
Umm hello? Are you dense?
---
Am I being stupid? Since when did thermite have grenades...
---
Fuck that Clash
---
Ok imagine playing Favela in ranked then. As far as I’m aware secure is still in ranked anyways so what’s the problem
---
You're supposed to restart matchmaking once it reaches 3 minutes.
---
Unfortunately Ubi goes with the vocal minority. No way I'm going back to casual, and no way am I only playing bomb on a few maps.
---
Anyway, tweaking MPX damage a little bit won’t make a huge difference anyway.
---
Did you just asume xer gender? Thats toci
---
I for one am ecstatic that bomb is the only game mode now. In time everyone will learn it and everything will be made right in the world. In the mean time get yourself some FREELO on all the kids who don’t know what’s happening
---
I just don't understand why they thought all game modes in ranked was a problem. Literally nobody asked for this. I play bomb exclusively, but they completely alienate a whole section of players by making these decisions.
---
Personally my slight annoyance is at Ubisoft for this at this point, the Clash and IQ issues are new but seem to stem from the same process that allows the old shield bug.
---
This bug has popped up several times over the life of this game and been "fixed" each time, IMO given their past it really seems like this is just another thing given a band aid fix then forgotten about rather than the core issue looked into by the devs.
---
I was just trying to joke around why the fuck do you guys take things so literally and downvote me to hell ffs.
---
MPX has one of the longest time-to-kills among the SMGs
---
Shit outta luck. You wanna use your harddrive or stop cheaters
---
Ah yes please can the devs let Caveira pick up an F2 and R4C
---
I mean it would definitely be weird at first but its a risk reward, it would punish teams that aint working together or bad droning i suppose. plus as I said the gun has to be retrievable so it would have to be in the building and close. I dont see why not, plus maybe we are going to see the f2 nerf soon too
---
Here comes a comparson that would make jesus himself envious.  
---
  
---
If you have knife, you can do cutting with it. But if you have a Swiss tool, you can do slightly worse cutting with it, but also a lot more of other stuff. Which one is "better overall"?  
---
This goes for many things in life. Sure you can be good at something you can practise in a controlled, familiar environment. But throw a surpising situation in your face and then your skills are actually put to test.
---
OHHH! IT AINT ME, IT AINT MEEEE!

Find a good sense and practice your 180’s constantly. If you can 180 30 times in a row without over or undershooting it, then you know your sense. If you can’t 180 on a dime and don’t know your sense, you will never be able to clutch against good players with her.

Thank god because the "literally unplayable" became real. Every ranked ps4 game I played this week had this freakin glitching clash, deployable shield and iq. Absolutely terrible experience, mainly because I coming home late and so every evening have time for like 2-3 games and not being able to enjoy my favourite game sucks.
---
It doesn't bring much counterplay because the new OPs ARE the counterplay. The meta atm is very intel based, and people have been talking about for ages that aside from Jaeger we have no counter to throwables. These new OPs are intended to fill those roles. Also, in terms of being shot through smokes, the counterplay to that is not use Smokes like a retard now there's a new OP, but from your comment that might be asking a bit much

A damn good man. On a damn good team. Your teammates didn’t even give it a second thought. They knew why you did it. And they accepted it.
---
Bong here. Just got back from work. What are these glitches everyone is talking about?
---
Now ban claymore and depmoyable shield
---
They said "tomorrow" yesterday.
---
You are bad, but this does not mean you are bad
---
Id honestly be all for this if they both had at least ONE unique weapon like how Lion and Finka have. Maybe a DMR on Nøk and some kind of slow ROF high damage per shot SMG on Warden.
---
But they had unique weapons nometheless
---
Oh god he runs so stupid xD Because he is a 3 armour it looks so quirky.
---
You're actually retarded, please stop
---
You're saying that like Monty doesn't have that sick knight one
---
Where? The blog post only went up today.
---
Clash is actually [SCO-19 (shown on her vest)](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1RLNS_enUS826US826&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=ndDeXOmGIqfH5gKs6ouwCg&amp;q=SCO-19&amp;oq=SCO-19&amp;gs_l=img.12...0.0..2307...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz-img.LnvMDKbGtCM) which makes her akin to FBI SWAT and BOPE.
---
If they want to utilize the game's counter terror unit aspect, I think they should make Warden part of the Secret Service's [Counter Assault Team](https://www.google.com/search?q=counter+assault+team&amp;rlz=1C1RLNS_enUS826US826&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoyO7T7qLiAhUxxVkKHbdiA44Q_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=920), making him an expert in protecting sites and hostages.  Hence, he's a defender.
---
Glitches going on surrounding them
---
ON YOUR SIX!
---
*Yells at operator, revealing his position, rather than shooting the operator undetected.*
---
That's the same for an attacker who gets pinged by cams, mozzie drone or evil eye.
---
Better title “Big Brother is with you”.
---
Because the OP might as well not exist, the only reason I ever think about him is the shitty memes
---
Nah, problems are all platforms
---
Hahaha yeah, lowkey wishes he was a 2 speed then it would look awesome on him! And the shotgun running animation would fit smoke soooo well!
---
They definitely didn't expect this game to take off like it did so it seems the architecture of the game was never intended to have constant changes like this.  So you change one this a 4 other things break.  Siege 2 will be more flexible I would think
---
I meant the two way glass. If the attacker can see me behind the shield then I don't want to use it. I didn't really use shields much before this anyway though, just on certain maps and objectives, but I can always just roam.
---
He was in ghost recon wildlands as well, downloaded a free trial of that game just to play the special event he was in, sucks he seems to be the antagonist in breakpoint but I don’t and never will care about the ghost series enough to actually play it so whatever, still i wish someone made a punisher game with him as the punisher, dude did a fantastic job as Frank Castle.
---
Doesn’t make warden any better though he is still going to be the worst anchor in the game
---
What i meant was, if they're going to give her an smg, give her one that makes sense.
---
You’re a good man Theon.
---
what if the run and reload animation is for everyone so valk would also get the new mpx animation and every op would have the new running animation, would be cool tho
---
The actual glitch takes awhile to patch, Dev's don't work weekends, so for now they vaulted the broken things.
---
Invisible god mode iq, clash shooting through her shield and the deployable face shield glitch
---
Nøkk is going to be amazing. Imagine being invisible to Echo drones while planting now. 
---
And Warden is gonna be a great Glaz counter, like we always needed. The Glaz-Ying plant meta can finally be countered.
---
Because she is d  u  m  m  y  t  h  I  c  c, and I practiced with her the most so
---
They will announce one when there will be one, until then, its at Ubisoft's planing and discretion.
---
Clash would have her gun out while other enemies would see her fully extended. This would make her invincible while she could shoot back.
---
IQ would become invisible to people after abusing a claymore glitch.
---
Everyone with a deployable shield would have the Jaeger glitch from a while ago.
---
Its in pro league and csgo thereofore its better. Bore off mate its shite
---
When is Lion going to be able to use the second pistol on his chest? I mean it's totally the next logical step after his nerf right?
---
No.
---
Well I couldnt replicate it then, and didn’t see anybody doing any glitches
---
A temporary fix until they have a working one. Go ubi for not taking for ever to fix bugs that people use to boost themselves in ranked. Good job ubi.
---
My head Canon is that the Division takes place in a universe where Rainbow failed to stop the white masks.
---
Note that I have never played the Division and am pulling this from my butt.
---
Ye I got all the default ops
---
I thought the same!! I saw the running animation and for a sec I was like "oh that's cool he keeps his gun upright" but then I saw how slow he was hahaha
---
Yeah Monty can take the force of close range shotties without flinching. Plus Doc is jacked af and Lardex. Sledge and Thatcher are really strong but outmatched.
---
Did I say he would be the best anchor? I was pointing out to the other guy what the point in his gadget was. I never claimed he would be good.
---
They may give him an Acog for the MPX considering he’s a three armor
---
Right like 9 people said hibana so I'm guessing that's my next pick
---
Look man no where in the tweet does it mention claymores or shields.  I get on to play some ranked and find out that both claymores and shields are still enabled.  The tweet only talks about clash being removed tomorrow.  I really don't understand what is so hard to understand about this.
---
Damn, wasn't expecting Ubi' to pull an Epic and straight-up disable certain content until a fix is made, but I can respect and support it.
---
I just hope they are this diligent and faster next time to prevent as many people from losing Rank as possible.
---
I’m much more disappointed than “upset.” It’s sad that I paid money for a game that I hardly play anymore simply because I want to support the devs. But the lack of effort from them makes me question why do it anymore. I felt like I was doing them &amp; the player base a favor, to keep the game alive. Yet they’re going to let it die from lack of effort? And again, it’s not reaching to expect new weapons. They set that as the standard *every season prior.* we didn’t set that standard, they did. If you rewound just a few days, no one had ever heard of a season where new weapons didn’t come out. It’s like saying “just because your last 12 cars from us had gas pedals doesn’t mean this one will. Can’t just assume.”
---
Clash didn't even do the glitch right lol
---
It took me a while to find camera spots when I first started playin, my best suggestion is to go in a custom match with IQ and go around the map with the electronic scanner to find all the cams in a map you play on often
---
Why did you post a picture of IQ instead of making this a self post?
---
i will defend the youtubers publishing these glitches.  
---
now now, don't downvote me just yet, hear me out.  
---
just imagine if no one published these glitches, then so many people won't know about them, but some will always know.  
---
now, it (the glitch) will be an issue, but not as big as it would have been of everyone knew about it. if it will not become a big issue, then it would not be top priority for ubisoft.  
---
c'mon we all already know how ubi handles these kind of things, no glitch was solved earlier until it became a big issue in community.  
---
the glitch would exist for longer in game and would hurt more in the long run. and that's really bad, as opposed to a few days of pain.  
---
in their defence, they just let people know that glitch was a thing, they were never promoting the glitch itself, saying "hey people, this is a thing, let's abuse this shit out".   
---
these videos are also necessary on tutorials about how to reproduce the bug/glitch.  
---
now an argument could be made that "oh you could just directly submit it to ubi, don't make it public".  c'mon man, it's been 4 years already, we know how ubisoft acts to r6fix issues and direct glitch reports. no serious action is taken Unless it becomes a serious issue.  
---
so there's that, I've made my point. let's not throw shit around and let's just have a civil conversation if you have counter-arguments to my points.
---
Why not? Your video shows nothing of use.
---
knock but the O with cross over (ø) has a different sound (cant explain)
---
 They were so quick to single me out and they didn't even give me a chance to show what I could do.
---
&gt; to fix bugs
---
Which fixes are you speaking of?
---
are u dumb
---
Anyone got any remaining clash relics?
---
FOR THE LAST TIME ITS NOT A HOLOGRAM BUT A VOLUMETRIC DISPLAY
---
His gadget, CHEESECANNON
---
Answer the question
---
the guy tk the other, but also dies because of reverse fire
---
they tweeted that it was tomorrow they disabled her
---
There’s this thing called a headshot...
---
Depends on how real you make it look. SO go for extra realism to spice things up
---
🦀🦀🦀 CLASH IS GONE 🦀🦀🦀
---
And why is that a bad thing?
---
So I'm curious, any one got any details on what the claymore glitch caused? I saw the shield glitch was back in a form and that Clash somehow shot through her shield, I hadn't heard anything about claymores so I'm out of the loop there. 
---
Either way, I'm just glad to see Ubisoft taking some faster and more direct forms of patching exploits. 🤗
---
What is so bad about it? You all keep saying it’s bad with no good reasoning lol
---
It sucks bc I play iq every once in awhile and always get tk'd even if I'm moving right after spawning lol
---
"So yeah. I guess I'm back!"
---
New Kafe is far better, I’m actually excited to play on it next season
---
I think theres a glitch that let's you usem
---
Then stick with controllers? As someone who plays wtih PS4 I'd still rather use a controller than M&amp;K in a world where they are smashing people with the latter. But it's no longer an issue if everyone has access to it. They literally can't do shit about it. The only logical thing at that point is to allow it so everyone has a shot.
---
Friendly fire probably activated when he downed his teammate and when he kept shooting he killed himself. People the only person left was down he instantly died
---
Wait is the tts up or something?
---
Is she only banned on PC or on console (Xbox One) as well? I just played an hour ago and people were still abusing it
---
Nah that’s just rainbow is magic
---
I'm usually at Plat 2, currently Plat 3 though. I didn't stop playing ranked while glitches were active so I had a losing streak because of that. I'll earn it back this weekend though
---
&gt;Regardless of the reason its better for an issue to be known than have it lurking around waiting to spread, its good it is spreading this quick as hopefully changes will happen on ubi side and fix this before the new season, imagine this glitch popped up on the new season.. its a bad look on ubi, i get it but atleast they are fully aware and have ways to reproduce the issue so this should be fixed easily.
---
Nice, but to many memes and overlapping audio.
---
That's where my idea comes in. It's intended to be a middle ground for everyone:
---
The MP5SD6 would be the collapsible stock version of the MP5SD that echo has. It would have a faster ads at the cost of recoil.
---
The PDW-9SD is jackals PDW but permanently suppressed and with a 30 round mag. Again higher recoil but that's the only change this time.
---
The .22 mag is actually a hi-standard pistol (used by OSS during ww2 and the cold war) with an integrally suppressed barrel and lower recoil at the cost of damage and range.
---
The five seven is the five seven. Nothing special but an option for hi-capacity. 
---
The resources are already there- ubi would just need to tweak weapon values and change the meshes for these guns to work.
---
Compensation is not required. 
---
I bought every season pass and could care less if something gets disabled to better the game. Fairly certain they have a some type of clause in their ToS that defends what they're doing at the moment from compensation or worse, lawsuits. 
---
I hate for this to sound rude honestly, but there's no need to act so entitled over something trivial as some content being inaccessible for the time being for the greater good. If the character/gadgets were removed from the entire game I would be a little more understanding of the matter and there woukd be a larger uproar.
---
Honestly I see Ubisoft giving out some renown boosters or a free Alpha Pack anyways as they're usually pretty generous and grateful when they don't always have to be.
---
Anyways I hope you see a bit of my rambly-ass point and let the frustration disapate. Have a good day Spider'. 😄
---
You can name any gun, and if play with it.
---
They both died but only one of them should have died
---
Lack of effort?
---
Major system changes + redesigned Kafe + 2 brand new ops + pick &amp; ban in ranked + reworking smoke's gadget function = lack of effort because they're decided to use existing guns which will hopefully bring attention to them and get them tweaked to being competitive ... Right.
---
They're literally gun models, if you think they opted to opt to using pre-existing weapons as some sort of lazy play to avoid work ... you're actually a special kind of stupid.
---
Alright you go work at Ubisoft since you know so much
---
Well you can’t do the clash bug if you can’t play clash. It’s a temporary fix, as I said before but a welcome one.
---
I actually recommend paying for 1 or 2 ops considering how cheap they are. But for operators I would go with Hibana because Nøkk is not only going to be played by everyone for the first 2 weeks, not giving you a chance to play her, but also she’s probably gonna suck
---
the guy who did the TK got killed because of reverse fire, but the dude being shot died too. If that happens what is the point of TK, it's suppose to stop toxic behavior, but this just makes the game wrost. 
---
Before this of change, if u killed your friend you would still be alive and have a chance to win the round, here you don't get that chance and just lose the round. What I would like to see is not for both of them to die if it's a win or lose condition. In this situation I would like to see the dude being shot not dying, and the dude with the reverse fire on die.
---
But you are too fucking dumb to understand how this is bad I guess.
---
She is greyed out because Monty got all six infinity stones and snapped her out of existence
---
Thank you for the feedback
---
i dont think thats the case, i think he is asking because the amount of people abusing the glitch is astounding and he is simply frustrated
---
supernova?
---
it comes tomorrow on console
---
The glitches is the reason why but the ranks under gold do it all the time
---
Why? There needs to be a tk (or x dmg) to trigger the system. Any further damage they do will be reflected.
---
Likely balancing. If you had a black uniform on while this happened, you would be at an objective advantage.
---
Normal play - dead meme - average play - dead meme - lucky shot - dead meme
---
And it loops on
---
Something to do with using a claymore and a drone to glitch out IQ where it turns her invisible.
---
Yup, I would be quiet. Not being a smartass, I'd be supportive of waiting for something I own to be fixed if it serves a greater good or need than my own. That's how life works most of time.
---
I don't think a single person has ever been banned for cheating. There's no point reporting
---
Why?
---
Thanks cap!
---
I legit can't wait!
---
Idk how the fuck did people find leaks?
---
And the artworks doesn’t actually show him holding any shotgun.
---
U're a national hero
---
Where might I find this? Looks like bank
---
so you basically let boosters carry you to win , am i right ?
---
Awh, there it is. Can't come up with shit so you bring out the strawman claims and attempts to attack me. Lul. You're a fucking clown my guy.
---
You read the notes?
---
Cav vs nokk is gonna be fun
---
Lmao "useful"
---
Yes a change like that would be welcome
---
Yea
---
The way I saw it explained earlier is it's like book
---
Your opinion is wrong, mate
---
I do agree to an extent, it should function in a way similar to other games ive seen, where when you have the offense activated, any damage you would have done gets inflicted on you instead
---
True lol, it was just one of those things that made me think. Just like when I ask why a drone can jump but my character's can't hahaha.
---
Well , the stress test fail :(
---
PC
---
&gt; the guy who did the TK got killed because of reverse fire
---
Were they not killed because the victim pressed the "this was intentional" button...?
---
&gt;If that happens what is the point of TK, it's suppose to stop toxic behavior, but this just makes the game wrost.
---
Why don't you go and read about how the system works before making a post like this?
---
&gt;here you don't get that chance and just lose the round. 
---
Not true at all.
---
&gt;In this situation I would like to see the dude being shot not dying, and the dude with the reverse fire on die.
---
Which is what happens with subsequent damage.
---
&gt;But you are too fucking dumb to understand how this is bad I guess.
---
Kid...don't talk shit when you don't understand how the system works and appear barely able to write your native language.
---
at this rate we can start doing mirror matches, nokk, glaz, gridlock, dokkaebi, and monty, vs vigil/cav, warden, lesion, mozzie, and clash(after shes unbanned for cheating the training missions)
---
It's not that easy brother. If you allow MnK for all people are gonna still use adapters be put with controller servers.
---
Shield count to 0 is sheduled for tomorrow, read the article on r6 website.

I’m on PC I’m down

Read the notes.

I’m on PC too

It gets disabled tomorrow for console
---
Can’t go on Xbox rn. Port for HDMI broke
---
a free op or 25k renown for everyone who has all the ops i hope. although a 50% renown boost for a week would be way better
---
If reverse friendly fire was already activated, then only the shooter should have died. If it wasn’t activated, then only the person being shot should have died
---
Wish they could just disable IQ’s claymore, gonna be runout city for a bit
---
Oh christ, i wouldnt even notice if they were doing it then lol 
---
How's that fun to you ? now you're a cheating bastard then
---
He's not gonna have an acog. Him and the lord only 3 armors with no acog

Well done! My only criticism would be that the audio mixing can be a little out of imbalanced leading to some deafening moments. But as I mentioned, well made! Especially for the first time.

No, that's Gordon Freeman

What do you mean? This is by far Ubisoft’s most successful game. Barely anyone talks about Far Cry, AC, or Ghost Recon anymore.

Does it not kill the person if their tk is deemed intentional?

If you hit the intentional button the person doesn’t die

its ubisoft paris that work on GR , not montreal , so siege devs still work on siege

Shes actually not, her shotgun is pretty good at the moment. Idk who would ask someone why they have an OP unlocked in the game, a lot of people have had them all unlocked for a while

He's the lesser evil. Remove all shield ops and cancer global/tracking operators from the game, **then** you can delete my Lesion.

Just temporary sadly.

My friend told me the same thing when I mentioned how fun it was. Especially when they already killed you, one time a guy did it again in overtime and I was hoping he'd kill himself by shooting me so I was more disrespectful and punched his claymore. Then he just fell down dead. Very nice, but no more Ranked for me till it's fixed

Yeah, any explosions, maverick, and sledge can all break them, twitch and thatcher kind of. Also if the evil eye is on a soft wall of floor, breaking the floor/wall with buck will destroy the evil eye

Good job buddy.

It's a better alternative than to do nothing and let the game become compromised by game breaking glitches.

marvelous, especially the James Bond reference.

Hmm yeah if she can plant while invis I actually do see that being useful

Warden could smack anybody don't @ me

Why i can use claymore if it is removed? I play as capitao

Yesss!!!! So I'm not the only one who thinks of The Kingsman when I see warden!!
---
And nearly invincible. She can’t be shot, but she can still trigger traps and be hit by explosives
---
You got me there, I did think of him when I draw that 👨🏻
---
Thank god. I lost a ranked cos of that glitch
---
I feel like r/ShittyShittyRainbow6 is a better place for this but thanks regardless.
---
Wtf are you even on my dude? For the better of esports? The majority of people who play games don’t give a damn about esports and this is a move that caters to the 1% of LARPers on the internet. Rocket-leave has a strong esports and ranked for every single play mode including non competitive ones like rumble and it hasn’t affected them in any way. Same with a lot of other games.
---
This whole “just play casual” is such a stupid thing to say. I don’t want to play 3 minute matches with people constantly quitting just so I can play the game mode that I like. There’s no reason to remove this. 
---
This is just Ubisoft being lazy developers not wanting to maintain different modes of ranked. I hope this hurts the games player base.
---
Clash is abusing a major issue currently in game that allows her to have her shield up and shoot through it at the same time, he is killing his teammate to give the enemy team a fighting chance.
---
I made an opinion post yesterday check my profile I feel the same way!!! It separates the community besides we already have preferences if you wanna only play bomb ranked then only have bomb selected!
---
you be dissing my rainbow trout?
---
That’s exactly how you should play casual
---
big facts.

Thank you, mama raised me right! Haha

Right? Like everyone looks really tactical but He looks like a good neighbor
---
Wait, the shields are disabled? I thought only Clash was
---
I wonder if there are more on Xbox or PS4 🤔
---
No biggy, this is adorable all around.
---
“I’m gonna get you little muppets!”
---
Doesn’t change the fact that all prom with warden has him holding a mpx
---
That is so sad, Bomb is the worst gamemode on many maps. I only play secure area and hostage because these modes are far more balanced most of the time. If Ranked only has bomb for real, i wont play reanked again.

This is fucking embarrassing, get a grip, it is literally a bunch of pixels and you getting all emotional, the state of this...
---
I don’t think there are plans for siege 2. I’m pretty sure they just intend on keeping this game going for a long time like csgo
---
Beautiful
---
It’s just their to show you have reverse friendly fire on. It turns on when you kill/down a teammate
---
Omg can I get picture with you?

what does your main rig normally run?

PS4, because you can use mnk on PS4 without any external hardware

Hello NuclearDrifting, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bptr6m/please_strike_and_ban_channels_that_show_how_to/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Bruh no, this is a Rainbow 6 subreddit, go to r/Minecraft or r/gaming to circle-jerk karma with your friends.
---
The crown is to show that you are the squad leader if you are playing with friends
---
I don’t think that’s true, you need an adapter to negate the lag.
---
She is spook

Good thing i am a man of culture and know you were being sarcastic UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE

Ah, thanks for the explanation, i’m on OPs side now
---
Give chanka 3 turrets while you're at it.

thats looks a bit like Liam O Brien.
---
What was this post?
---
Thanks! And I know, I had to completely abandon ranked after my already not great rank plummeted! Oh well, I’m excited for pick and ban next season! Hopefully will minimize future problems
---
It’s to notify you and the team they reverse friends fire is active for you due to a recent teamkill. Anymore damage done will be reflected back to you, or if using a gadget it will damage the gadget.
---
yeah guys thats mister hummus
---
No, you need to kill five enemies.
---
Of course you won’t get a refund lol
---
I was aiming where the ping was but you’re right.
---
Tachanka would be proud :’)
---
2/3 answers so far not even answering your question because they see the RFF symbol and go on autopilot.
---
Pretty sure the crown means squad leader.
---
The crown means you are the squad leader of your party
---
Clash is gone, depolyable shields and claymores are still available, but I heard they can’t be placed by certain OPs who can do the glitch
---
Silly geese, you guys explained the triangle not the crown.
---
See the issue with that is there are 2 C8 variants in the game already and both do different damages with different firerates
---
I don’t blame you. I don’t glitch but I’d let my team do it after my enemies do it. Grenades are obsolete most of the time thanks to Jaeger being one of the main ops people do that glitch with. Flame bolts would be cool but most Clash glitchers are running around the map and will most likely be paired with a shield glitchers. The airjab nerf (The noise they make) couldn’t have come at a worse time because they were our best bet if they were silent. Lol I don’t like the fact the glitches are this bad.
---
The IQ glitch can be stopped by Pulse but she can also see Pulse, Kapkan traps, and poison needles. Frost mats would be cool to combat that as well but most of the time enemies are avoiding those as if they don’t work on invisibility glitchers
---
Debris really shouldn't be client side either. It's so frustrating that a barracade  can be not see through for me but other people can see through it. It's all where the broken pieces land
---
It’s still there,

What a weird turnaround for this sub, just 64 days ago this was said and got like 1K upvotes and Six Forty something on the one further...

The point of the triangle is where the gun shoots
---

---
100% Good man. Playing with honor has to be part of this game. This isn't some stupid BR game. Where you brainlessly run around. Siege is all about playing against operators, understanding their abilities and then trying to prepared tactics that can help you win. Ubi never wanted you to play vs a person that can free fire w/o any retalitation being possible.
---
Looks like a game rendering (not a bad thing it's super good)
---
That is beautiful! 100% worth it! I wish I had thought of just destroying gadgets! Sounds so much more fun and satisfying! Lol
---
How are people still not knowing this?
---
Is this for console? Also has IQ been removed too?
---
I mean, should we ban everyone who has a glitch that happens to them? Are you saying this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKsWuHHrDYo should get banned too?
---
How about this guy who was glitching to be immune to bullets https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0PEjxz7Hpg
---
No wonder this game's dying.
---
Found the diamond 12 
---
In all seriousness im a gold fam. I play bomb when i want to. And thats the key WHEN I WANT TO.
---
If you straighten the pin beforehand, it's pretty easy.
---
Totally agree, he's too strong in pro league. But I never see him played in ranked.
---
I'm not saying I don't believe that the people you interact witht think that way. I'm sure most of them do. However, this is completely anecdotal. Bascially everyone i watch (streaming and youtube wise) think the changes are awesome and would even like to see ranked have a map pool that directly mirrors the maps in pro league. The people I play with are also in agreement that this change is for the better. In fact, the only place i've seen an conplaints about he upcoming changes are on this subreddit. And they never gain any traction here either so it doesn't seem to be the majority of the players opinions.
---
Ranked should not cater to non competitive players. That would be dumb as fuck
---
Good man what you did isn't nearly as bad as what your teammate was trying to do.
---
Whats funny is if it were as cut and dry that this was a wanted thing by the majority the votes on this wouldnt be at 0 meaning its getting up and down voted at the same rate.
---
Thank you, that’s so nice! This same guy in the clip was shield glitching on defense as Mira. He had a shield on his head and his mirror in front of his body. Luckily, he got taken out by a grenade before I could get to him.
---
oh yeah I got a duplicate for the L85A2. I was so sad.
---
IQ becomes invisible and can’t be shot
---
smoke got a new animation to do something with the smoke canister clipping through walls, and as far as i know, warden is the only one getting this animation along with a sprinting one
---
Why are you suddenly pivoting to ubi when they aren't relevant in this context?
---
Agreed
---
I'm level 142 or so
---
He is a strong character, but not broken.
---
Here are some solutions.
---
1. Bait him with the tracking. You can do this with a teammate. Set up a cross and let him run into the fire.
---
2. Don't roam as heavy.
---
3. Fight back. If you know where he is and where you came from, shoot down the way and hopefully you'll hit him.
---
The most competitive settings should be used, I 100% agree.
---
Xul10 was the Clash and Zar\_Hank was playing with IQ when the game was over all left at the same time so probably they are in full party.
---
I started recording after a round where clash killed the whole team, we still managed to win.
---
(I died 5 times in 6 rounds for glitchers :c)
---
She would be too strong with frags but I think if they just temporarily disable claymores until the glitch is fixed that will be the best
---
Is this only Clash or are Claymores and Shields going to be gone today as well?
---
Yeah, the only new weapon between the two of them is Wardens pistol
---
Crocks and nothing else
---
I love everything about it and honestly wish they would limit the map pool as well. Which I understand not everyone agrees with. But still. With the number of times Meme Park seems to come up in the rotation I really wish we at least had some sort of map voting system
---
It's an all right weapon as far as defenders go, but on an Attacker? Eh.
---
Dokki has your postion revealed only in the range of your operators ears what means you wont be heard tru 2 rooms and also you can disable your phone.
---
Lion is great but has a cooldown and has you stay at a position for 1 second.
---
Jackal makes your run around the map being paranoid where the next enemy could wait for yo ufor 30 seconds straight while also being unable to follow your old path.
---
Mr Stark...
---
craziest part, my first black ice came off of a two percent chance to hit.
---
9/10 I can make it back to OBJ, while I do believe that either his recoil needs to be nerfed or his damage, the f2 is the superior weapon (just had to say that). I do wish that mute would counter him when standing on a mute Jammer. But jackal is the only hard counter to roamers. The pings should go by faster and it shouldn’t last as long
---
Instagib like gears 4 shotgun!
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
&gt;I play the best operator in the game, Jäger.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
You’re just extremely lucky. I’ve only got one black ice and it’s for Frosts shitty shotgun. This one is the least rare because you can buy this black ice in the shop in a frost bundle
---
They can keep banning their Ubisoft account, and even permaban the his main account if he makes more to avoid bans like that. Make an example of scum.
---
He may be warden but i prefer warden from for honor.
---
Who are you watching cause get flanked icycat and a few others are already speaking out against it mind you if you are only watching diamonds and plat 1 and prob some plat 2s yes they do if you watch the majority of normal people none diamond and high plat they dont. That makes up the majority of the player base.
---
What you said is such a shitty excuse for them to be lazy, they have 3 months to make like 5-6 guns, Ubi has like 15000 employees and makes so much money, they could easily make a few guns
---
Hello ChDsK_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bpup39/i_did_not_play_a_single_game_of_ranked_without/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That’s what I’m saying lol I don’t think he cares with the amount of money the guy is making. look how many views he gets per video
---
And they added new animations and textures for them, it wouldn't make any sense if that wasn't because that will be indeed what it will be avaiable for them.
---
Jesus that’s lucky man, the last one was the L85 that I got
---
Most people just don’t know how to play him right
---
Dude Kleiner with a beard is the sexiest thing I've ever seen.
---
*Exploiting.* read what I wrote. Obviously if it happens on accident no. If they continuously use a glitch over and over, yes. They absolutely should be banned.
---
People like you act like everyone has the same luck. I’ve only ever gotten one black ice.  It’s like the lottery winner who won multiple times saying the odds aren’t big as everyone is making it out to be
---
These ops are recycled thanks ubi
---
No, you need 5 kills in a round
---
The day R6S became the House of Horrors
---
What a nightmare these glitches have been
---
Roam with a teamate and bait him into them. The intel the ping gives is outdated the moment it goes off, unless you stand still for some reason. He's going to come for you. If the enemy team is too good at roam clearing or you simply cannot beat the jackal in a one on one gun fight then switch up your strategy and anchor on sight or roam close to the obj so you can rotate back safely. Jackal is annoying for sure but he is far from broken.
---
Windows settings?
---
The new op has to be standing still to see through smoke.
---
You have passed the test, commander
---
So far I'm totally not looking forward to trying to smoke plant on a mira window with warden behind it lol. It's especially nice to have him after the maestro cams got slapped a bit.
---
Both M5 and MPX are nice guns, but not for 3 armour 1 speed ops.
---
oof, I really want it for the Smg-11 or the SAS shotgun, that would complete me, since I also have the mute elite, on top of sledge. I know that's a lot of money but I tend to buy one every few months.
---
I feel you. I have always felt like the pro league maps are what should be played in ranked. I'm getting pretty frustrated playing skyscraper and theme park. At least the Kafe rework will make that map a bit more playable.
---
Same here! Super excited.
---
Lion believes that the ends justify the means (which is why he’s my most toxic op) and Thatcher places more value on human life.
---
Wtf you are illogical this entire conversation started because you said only small studios listen to streamers/youtubers for community input. I said even big ones do and used ninja as an example to compare streamers from siege to. You said that massive means rich and I am saying ubisoft is a rich and massive studio there no pivot it was there the entire time.
---
Thank you! I can start playing now!
---
There are factors?
---
I cant even see whats different about the headgear. Maybe im just rarded tho.
---
I agree as well. Glad to hear it! Bomb is the only competitive game mode in my opinion.
---
Mute said something oh he's pissed
---
I think my point is pretty sound mate, how does letting me play secure in ranked, have any affect on you playing bomb? Other than you’re salty because some secure only players might have higher ranks. But them having a higher rank, has no affect on your rank
---
44% of us call ourselves Scottish.
---
Thats Clash' pistol... lol
---
They deserved that
---
Yes yes yes yes yes!
---
I highly doubt it, but sure
---
But why can you damage her then 🤷‍♂️
---
most have actaually been from low percent chances actually besides the ones i bought a pack for, I got it for the 416-c last night from buying a pack
---
I would much rather have you pick 1-5 instead of random. But I still feel like people wouldn’t fill roles which sucks
---
I hope so but it’s kinda far fetched as the test server leaks have been released with those guns and don’t forget about the teasers so kind or a long shot tbh.
---
&gt; you said only small studios listen to streamers/youtubers for community input.
---
"Outside of tiny studios, they don't generally."
---
Nope, read it again.
---
&gt;I said even big ones do and used ninja as an example to compare streamers from siege to.
---
Ninja is a shitty example. He is an anomaly.
---
&gt;You said that massive means rich
---
Again, not at all what I said.
---
&gt;there no pivot it was there the entire time.
---
In your mind, where you apparently just make up what people are saying to you.
---
RIP My neck
---
He said Nøkk's loadout is still in the mist, and only Warden's loadout is most likely final.
---
OH NO HE'S HOT
---
;(
---
Clash’s glitch literally involves her shield. What would they do?
---
This looks like Escape From Tarkov scav
---
I love the shotty tbh
---
You do know your supposed to re-queue when your queue timer is over the estimated time right?
---
behind thatcher
---
What's wrong with having old guns? You already know how they work and you don't need to unlock new skins for more guns since you can just use the skins you already had and if you get a new skin for the FMG-9 for example, you can use it on 2 operators instead of 1
---
Especially after a few pints
---
Its pronounced nuck too! Imagine calling out nøkk
---
Went from plat 2 to gold 1 in 2 days because of people doing this. Consider yourself lucky
---
No she is Cav, but vigil. She is not broken whatsoever, if you use your eyeballs you can see and hear her clearly. Just get off cams some if you know there is a Nøkk
---
Basically you bug out iq with a claymore and her scanner making the player somehow desync with their model but the hit box is wherever the player is but the the model is where you did the glitch making you completely invisible for all intents and purposes
---
Yeah, that's the best case scenario.  I'm all for new guns, but I've felt for a while it's time for them to have an Op Health style refocus on bugs and balance, at least for a season.
---
Oh I thought that was sledge. 
---
**WAIT WHERE’S SLEDGE**
---
Thanks, I will do that.
---
Oh shit, thanks dude. Feels like I've been living in a lie before this.
---
I don’t think they should ban you from playing if you leave, but rather ban you from finding another casual game for say 10 minutes. Normally I play casual when I have to go soon, but I agree people who leave just to find a different map shouldn’t be allowed to
---
Big Facts lol
---
The higher the ping of the person you are peeking, the easier it will be to kill them. Peeking someone who has 9ms gives you essentially no peeker's advantage at all, while peeking someone with 100ms ping will give you are 25% more time to react.
---
Splitting up the playerbase is exactly what they shouldn't do. Ranked is supposed to be the competive game mode and they are adjusting it to reflect that.
---
Finka is pretty good and supportive. I’d pick her up.
---
Yeah but I like people being completely unaware of my location
---
I mean it prevents plats boosting coppers.
---
Might as well have 1 gun for all ops, makes it easy no? I mean that means they just have to balance 1 gun, make skins for 1 gun and not worry about it, you are right
---
Oh yeah because the sunscreen on her face as well. For sure will happen.

This video around the 1:40 mark goes over his ability and loadout. https://youtu.be/0GFG5WgLWxo
---
Nice
---
Weird
---
Looks pretty dumb anyway...legendarys are so bad....
---
Honestly the gadgets are very unique and interesting, warden doesn’t have an INVR vision like Glaz, and Nøkk has invisibility to cams (a counterplay to the information meta on defense) and a alternate version of silent step, which lets her be a stealth anti intel attacker, we don’t have a stealth attacker let alone a stealth intel attacker. She is focused exclusively on CQC and she seems very fun.
---
Press and hold the o and the little tab with different o's will come out. Like as if you were adding an accent on a letter.
---
Cøkk
---
It doesn't though these bases are normally seprate anyway. And whos having queuing issue average for me when the system isnt messing up and forgetting me in the queue(if you are having long queue times thats normally why its not from a lack of players its a glitch they still havent figured out in the matchmaking system from years ago)  is around 45seconds
---
Yeah no recoil good rof m8 every mediocre player can make pretty easy headshots with the mpx and yes the smg 12 isn't easy to handle but has one of the best ttk so what's ur exact problem with his loadout?
---
Yeah I fully supported operation health back then and I'm all for another one if it means ensuring my favorite FPS has a longer life. Hopefully the lack of new content doesnt drive people away this season, especially since pick and ban is coming to ranked along with some great changes to some older operators.
---
That’s dope as hell. You should do cav next

Imagine having a warden playing the mirror in the basement of oregon. He can see everything while also being able to immediatly take action rather than having an operator having to sit on cams.
---
True but I'd take a High Powered long range, long scoped rifle vs a mpx or shotgun at distance🤷‍♀️
---
Te sacabo!
---
Kaid is great for hatches and does something nobody else can, but mozzie is great for intel and can deny intel, similar to Mute. I’d suggest Kaid because there are so many intel defenders but nobody else can electrify hatches.

Wait Really?!  Why don't people knoe about it? Most of the replies i got told me i need it.
---
1. Him having the MPX is not as bad as you make it. Valkyrie has the exact same gun and is constantly TOP 10 in winrate and pickrate. A pea shooter but deadly accurate.
---
2. He easily has one of the best gadgets on defense. With Ranked becoming strictly bomb, he hard counters the most important equipment in that gamemode and makes Capitao only half effective. He makes the during plant situation way less favorable for attackers due to not having to randomly chuck a C4 in a direction. Him and Mira are definitely going to be a thing.
---
Oh shit. Thanks dude! Feels like I've been living in a lie before this.
---
It would be nice, but you might as well just use a USP or something then, since a .45 ACP D'Eagle would be FAR too impractical to be worth it.
---
I would be so mad at you for killing me if I were any of those guys haha
---
Friday &amp; Saturday I believe
---
Accept they arent....
---
Never mind then.
---
Thanks my glaz main friend will be happy to hear this
---
I love it and will miss nothing since I made the switch from secure to bomb during year 1 season 3. But I can understand how hard it will be for a lot of players.
---
That he's and camping style hold the objective operators that has no ACOG
---
Doc, echo, maestro all have acogs all kinda do a similar job
---
the entire weapon selection for this season is just lazy
---
I think it's because they already have every gun these ops use irl and use a part of the dev team for ghost recon breakpoint. For me that isn't rly a problem because the ops look awesome and they are balanced
---
No love for the earliest season. Black Ice imo was the best ( and thats only because thats when i picked up the game and have loved it ever since)
---
Agree.  It should make sense to a certain degree.
---
For Warden, I also think Ubi should add the SR-16 that the Secret Service counter assault teams like to use irl.
---
Make it a hybrid of Jager's 416 and Jackal's C7.
---
The idea is that Warden's utility will be extremely limited (since it only benefits himself and also not everyone will be running smokes and flash grenades) so to counter this, he should have a top tier rifle in the game to anchor with (he's not a 3 speed so not an ideal roamer).  Essentially, it turns him into the "Anti-Vigil".
---
A shorter barrel doesn't really make that big of a difference.  It might only be a few hundred fps slower
---

---
Ill miss the Hostage glitch... oh wait actually I wont at all
---
I'm so glad last season we started playing bomb (for no reason other then we got sick of secure )
---
I'm gonna be honest, I was expecting a childish rant. Cheers to you for accepting it and being chill with it.
---
They are removing claymores and deployable shields in the upcoming update so they didn’t half ass anything, I see that pretty clearly.

---
Well enjoy it while you can!
---
I didn’t see it
---
Especially if you were Jackal or Blackbeard, I panic-flicked onto Jackal and BB should've killed me.
---
I mean, literally everything thats changing with the game is being done with the pursuit of making it more competive. But if you don't have a better response than "nuh huh" why even respond?
---
Although someone says there that the sound seems like an un-suppressed 9mm handgun... It works, but it's effectively useless.
---
I actually put considerable amount of effort into this.
---
And I also did an update to my previous post, to not multipost, here:

As much as THIS makes sense, ubi wont do it, half the time i feel as they really dont know what theyre doing with ever dlc release
---
Good find
---
nokk should have 2 side arm options. five seven and deag i believe, at present. i'm fine with both, honestly. Her FMG9 is stupid imo.
---
I love siege and welcome the change
---
a lot of things remind me of warden
---
Is there any proof about the dev team going to Breakpoint? I heard it before
---
WAIT THEY ACTUALLY TOOK HER OUT? Did they fIx IQ?
---
It was the best decision my squad and I ever made in regards to the game. Its really where Siege shines as a competitive fps.

---
But then I wouldn’t be able to play with my friends, even if they’re a rank below me! How about 1500 elo gaps max
---
Suppose it depends on the calibre, as far as I know .50 AE is a pretty... Niche cartridge, but there are options for things like .357 Mag, so...
---
Yes but he can see through smoke doc echo and maestro can't do it as easy so it is balanced out m8. The video was leaked where ubi explains the intentions behind the ops and they say glaz has a range advantage against him. With a acog this would be denied.
---
I want a Dr. Phil elite skin.
---
They removed Clash, claymores and deployable shields. Bugs are not fixed but can't be done
---
Secure is just TDM pretty much. It's also way harder to attack on secure
---
Same here. I've never played anything besides bomb, but I feel that they shouldn't have removed other modes. Pick &amp; Ban is awesome though.
---
this was an unintended move from ubi so they had to remove it again . sorry mate
---
"Re-positioning quickly is vital for Warden's gadget" but is 1 speed
---
Idk Maybe. but maybe not lol. never tried it. Just thought of it while watching you clip.

but tbh I like Valk's Peashooter

Thx man

Yea, Ubi thought Glaz was too strong to be able to toss a smoke into a room and be able to waltz i there taking out anyone before they even realize who’s there. It sucks, but it’s whatever. Another thing that I want to note that I find amusing is that, with Glaz’s rework, Plane is is still most likely gonna one of his better maps. What makes it amusing is that they have Warden, the *Secret Service* op, his best counter on a presidential plane

Ah yes. Our one true love. Fragmite
---
Yep, it’s similar to Lion and Finka and the guns they share with GIGN and Spetsnaz
---
I feel like too many people are giving ubi a pass, if enough do this will be a regular thing.
---
I play bomb pretty much exclusively, so I won't even notice the change. I always spawn with defuser unless someone specifically asks for it because I really enjoy trying to find that perfect moment to plant. Secure Area involves much less strategic thinking and is kind of boring after a few rounds, imo.
---
Shhhhh they don’t like the truth

what the hell, thats even worse, how come i've never noticed that.

Reveal is this weekend.
---
I can just tell the community is gonna lost their shit and ask for new guns and an ACOG for Nokk, I hope they don't repeat this for Year 4: Season 3.
---
It was hot fixed on pc an hour ago. Go into a casual game and see if it has her claymores
---
It makes laser noises and they show up bright on his thermal cam.
---
not a huge fan of the fact that both new ops are side swaps though
---
I'm sorry but these operators weapon load outs are just wack like come the hell on... granted both ops seem really fun but tbh the Danish operator should have been a dude. Its kinda fishy that for the past 3 seasons weve been getting female attackers and plus I know there has never been a female navy seal and yet we have valk but come on ubi.. go by the books for once
---
ye ik I saw the other comment, I heard the rumour like half a day ago or so
---
Have you played it? No, right? Nobody has.
---
Why don't we hold back on the criticism until we ACTUALLY play it? It's not like raising our voice on Reddit is going to make the roll back their update.
---
And besides, pros have expressed excitement about the new ops, so it's all about ACTUALLY playing it before judging.
---
Best way to tell is if they’re looking around and changing crouch stance, something Xbox controllers can’t do
---
Add text
---
I personally like the idea of switching around offensive and defensive roles. I'm not sure how it would work for some operators, but I'm interested in seeing where this goes.
---
Right in the feels.
---
Alright bud. You clearly have no idea what the tweet said even though it was quoted 4 times.

Option F- hes just looking like a normal operator and thankful he finally got a good unifrom ?¿ just a shot in the dark
---
Some think she has no assault rifle because it would make her OP with how her ability is which is a lame excuse, Guarantee nobody will ever play as her again once the hype goes down same goes for Warden but his weapons are a little better than what Nokk has.
---
Neither of my Friends play it
---
The fmg-9 is a really good smg!

Exactly.

Besides, fmg 9 is a good reason to buy liquid skin.

The hell you on about?
---
God these comics make me want to pick r6 back up, but no one I know still plays :/
---
A bit confusing to call these “skins”. They’re head gear and uniforms for the new ops. Anyone seen the new seasonal *weapon* skins? They were in TTS before Y4S1. 
---
I have the season pass to unlock the ops, so the new skins are the most exciting thing I can look forward to saving up my renown to buy.
---
No difference
---
The problem lies in grouping secure ranks with bomb ranks. Why should someone playing an easier game mode be able to achieve the same rank as someone playing bomb? Secure lacks what siege is all about: strategy, teamwork, and communication. Different ranked pools would probably be fine (Casual, Ranked Secure(Casual 2), and Ranked Bomb). Not sure what that would do in terms of splitting the player base.
---
Oh, I see what you mean, I believe it's a bug from giving teammates armor from rook or simply healing them
---
Did they say that somewhere?

yeah same happened with Gridlock

at first "OOH NEW TRAP OP NEW GUNN BBIG THICC" but then "nah fam she's a 3 armor ew"

Sure how many do you want ? And wow you r a true hero we need more men like you

regardless of relevance, i was still talking about how MnK is used in other console games, as its not native in siege.
---
he reminds me of someone from ‘The Office’
---
Thx man really helps me

Oh wow Michael Ubisoft wow for real you are saving my day this guy is gonna regret it AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

is it next season or is it already active ?

From my sources it’s smokes

Oh no, I hope your Kopfschmerzen will get better soon! P.S.: where are you from?

Mine is probably okay send me all of the ones and keep the rest I've told my professional friend hahaha he says there's no problem because he is taken it care of

She gon.
---
Ummm not gonna lie that looks bad ass... you mind if ya can send me a *List* on how to look like that? I'm going to a game party and your suposed to dress up as your main. I got like 2 months till it starts but hey help would be appreciated
---
Like let him type like how he wants to type like.
---
Lol I hate playing against him but I do enjoy playing him when he works, that's the thing though he never works for me. I have 6 clips of people shooting directly through my shield, it's gotten to the point where if I choose him my friend talks me out of it because he knows it's going to happen lol
---
Lma0 this was obviously a neckshot so it did no damage
---
WoW a true hero 
---
A real hero you should be in avenger man
---
Oh fuck. I play nothing but intel ops on defense, and they're all going to be worthless for a while if nokk is popular.
---
Both ops dont seem like theyll change how any points are played or effect the meta. And the gun choices seem super odd. First time reused weapons and the reuse every single one. Fmg9 six12 and deagle are 3 of the worst guns in the game. So for now, yea it does seem the laziest
---
How were they exploited?
---
Was about time. Secure area and hostage are just.... No.
---
me too, and if you caught someone use that "glitch" u always get the same answer "u can simply vault there and if it's in the game it's not a glitch"
---
How long did this take???
---
How though. Deployable shields are poor and hardly anyone uses Clash. Attackers lose Claymore though. Other way around I feel
---
That's not what Operation Health did, it focused on servers mainly and setting up a foundation for the future.
---
Blame the engine and the complexity of Siege, Ubisoft quarantining these catalysts off is the best thing they could've done.
---
Not the guy but just look up siege year 4 season 2 leak and it should come up. It got the ops abilities right but it got the names wrong, but the names were actually the name of the operation, phantom and sight=Phantom Sight.
---
The shield would replace their head making it impossible to headshot them
---
Okay but any other game that I own works.
---
Battlefield 1 and 4, and Rust for example.
---
Fair use covers a small portion of content however and Ubisoft could make a very strong case that the content the creators are putting up is harmful to there IP, which it is, ergo Ubisoft would still have strong groubdsnds do demand a DMCA takedown.
---
... the iq glitch?
---
I mean, it is really just a Glock-18 in a converter kit by Magpul
---
Currently on console, the iq glitch is still live.
---
Secures fun enough
---
Now this is pod racing
---
I'm out of the loop here, can someone explain?
---
"Clash is currently unavailable. Check back when people stop exploiting their sman shield. Have a nice day"
---
Surely if anything it would be the other way round? She's literally being added to counter an intel heavy meta at Pros, where in low ranks barely anyone picks or uses Intel OPS, it's just a fragfest and she's got DOGSHIT guns.
---
You could have a deployable shield in front of your head like blackbeard but fully bullet proof. 
---
IQ could go invisible using steps involving her claymore.
---
There was an exploit where clash would look as if she had her shield in front of her when she didn't making her bulletproof but able to shoot still.
---
And ubisoft is gridlock. Tryna fix the server since forever
---
Yeah but do we legitimately, genuinely, actually need it? Do we need to do anything other than give callouts and hold your stomach and pray when downed?
---
Most definitely not.
---
But like a few more hours and then it’s gone
---
I'm pissed that Nokk doesn't even have an assault riffle with acog
---
just a visual thing.
---
A tts that wasn’t supposed to go live yet. I hope it isn’t the load out but it ain’t lookin good.
---
It’s a glitch not a hack, but either way he’s a bitch
---
I’ve seen no mention of a time by Ubisoft.
---
''exploring possible solutions that still allow Shield Operators to feel like a solid frontline choice.''
---
Make their shields actually work, and not having a 50/50 chance of not being bulletproof. That's all the shield ops need.
---
10/10 Would definitely allow to get stabbed.
---
I got the figures today as well. I can confirm that the gold figure should have the pistol holstered on her right hip.
---
It's just cosmetic, just something you adjust in the customization screen.
---
~~Don't tell me how to fap to this.~~
---
Yeah I’ve just never seen that glitch before now.
---
Just saw some footage and it looks like at least Nøkk has a different reload animation. Much more stealthy and low profile. Hope warden has some unique reloads as well
---
That extra slot is for ops like lion or twitch who have 3 guns.
---
Damn... time to make her my new main.
---
Its an IQ invisibility glitch. Do a certain chain of actions to dislodge the character model from the player.
---
They are trying to fix it atm. https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-349909-16&amp;ct=tcm:154-76770-32
---
There is supposed to be a temporary fix soon but it has appeared yet
---
not a hacker but a glitch that makes iq's model stuck in a certain spot. The IQ player will look invisible to everyone and the killcam gets messed up.
---
Glaz holding Thermite’s AR
---
rip “clash main”
---
Teenie weenie string bikini
---
I'm gonna keep it real with you, no that won't ruin it at all. this is exactly the same for vigil, and guess what? he barely gets killed cause of thatcher or iq
---
They got rid of clash and are going to remove claymores and deployable shields soon.
---
My squad bud has that and isn't a hacker. For sure.
---
Not all, but yes, they use a barcode so as to make it harder to search for them. Ubi should consider looking into them.
---
It's all in the gaming chair.
---
OOF
---
:(
---
Missed, there’s no bullet magnetism in siege
---
Jeez that's rough... What region are you in that they would take so long to ship?

I got my figures today. I reside in Canada.

---
Definitely. The white square on her chest even says "Beach Patrol"
---
Tig ol’ bitties
---
Am of sad.
---
Vigil isn’t really influenced by his gadget as heavily as Warden will be by his. I get IQ isn’t really going to do much to Warden, but it will still be infuriating to just be kill by her through a wall of floor.
---
Pretty much
---
☝🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Haaaa yes pleaaaase!

My vigil one came in early today
---
Um, Ok.
---
Just you replying to me like this tells me you’ve got nothing more to say, so thank you.
---
You might of
---
A.) You might of deleted an important files
---
B.) Tried to download something that went along with siege and it corrupted your game
---
C.) Had a error with your internet connection (Nat Type, IP not registering ex.)
---
The logic for dismissing my second argument doesn't make any sense. Your logic is that balancing decisions should only consider intended uses of capabilities rather than their possible uses. By this same logic, it would be fine for balance if Twitch's Shock Drone dealt 50 damage per shot to defending operators. The reason pros choose Twitch most times is to deal with Black Mirrors and defender gadgets, so the balancing team need not be concerned with the operator damage component.
---
You're right that nitro cells are more useful as throwables and still would be even if this ability were added. But any time a defender is downed before throwing their nitro cell the possibility I outlined is a concern. Yes at the present it's only a concern for pro play, but balance in the pro game is very significant despite representing a tiny portion of the player base.
---
Me likey!
---
Though I'll probably never use it.
---
Whenever I see a Castle or Maestro being played, I want to see where they're placing their shit, but 99% of the time, the cam person just goes off to look at something random. It's always really frustrating. 
---
I would love something like dota has (even if it's not realistic), where you can watch in game either following the cam of the casters, or look where ever you want to look. 
---
It honestly makes watching TI (The big dota event) every year really fun, even if I haven't touched that game in a few years.
---
Why me....

Looks like they take more foresight and game sense to use properly than the ultimate click a button ops lion Finka but I get what you mean

Game is now heavily unbalanced without claymores. Especially for solo queuers.
---
Idk, I don't really mind the load outs they have since allegedly a lot of the team were re-alocated to help out with the new Ghost Recon game. It's a good time to probably also balance said weapons or rework them... *idk, just my 2 cents.*

However if we have underpowered ops the game gets extremely stale and doesn’t bring any new things to the game. An overpowered op gets people talking brings eyes on the game. Where as with underpowered ops people don’t come back for the new season. With overpowered ops people come to check it out. And both of these can be patched so I can take an overpowered op if it means players stay interested
