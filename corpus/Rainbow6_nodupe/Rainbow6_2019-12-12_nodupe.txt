I think I like to roam in defence, but not a defined style on attack
---
Anything higher than 900 fire rate benefits greatly from the compensator. F2, Mp7, Mx4, Skorp, etc.
---
Ok buddy
---
A repost
---
when you kill more teammates than actual enemies.
---
I think what they mean is that the LGBT community it strongly over represented. There also is apparently a difference in those relationships according to colleagues and stuff ifyou can fill out that your gay on a college application and have a higher change of getting in because of diversity score
---
Bro your having a argument with a dumb ass 15 year old over a meme
---
&gt; You literally seem to be making the argument as if I exclusively play Cav
---
The way you talk about Mira screams Cav main that is far off site that doesn't rotate back. If you are actually doing a roamers job of wasting time, holding on to map control, and rotating back when needed they are very rarely ever a detriment. If a team has that much site control that they can play the Mira windows then there was a massive fuckup and you weren't going to win regardless of those windows being there. 
---
&gt; she has zero utility is objectively wrong. She is the most powerful Intel op in the game, that's not even possible to argue
---
If any of this was remotely true her pick rate in PL wouldn't be similar to Tachanka's. You don't even need to look at that either as the most recent Ember Rise Win Delta chart shows her right next to him in the underpowered/too weak category among Plat's and Diamonds. She loses majority of her value once you make it around mid-gold. She is incredibly easy to just trade off even if she gets the down.
---
The most powerful intel op in the game is Mira lol. I'd also much rather have an Echo, Maestro, Pulse, Valk, or Lesion when it comes to intel gathering than Cav. 
---
&gt;  But she is also very not useful in a lot of sites
---
I could seriously walk you through every damn ranked site in the game if you need me to and reiterate why this is wrong
---
&gt; because it's literally a different game than anyone in this sub plays
---
Far from it. At its most basic level the same stuff matters. Your average player obviously isn't going to come near it strategy wise, but the essential principles apply if you want to be successful in game. What areas of the map are important, what areas need to be cleared, which flanks to hold, which walls/hatches/vertical lines of sight need to be opened, etc. For example just because the team someone is playing in Silver on Border doesn't know they need to clear upstairs before attack Vents/Workshop doesn't mean you shouldn't play up there. When I first moved to PC my usual group got by on a lot of that sort of thing while our gun skill and movement wasn't nearly as good as most teams we were playing.

Lmao
---
In what Store?
---
Was this from the show or edited?
---
obviously it does. recoil diamond doesn't refer to hipfire. it's the way siege calculates recoil, which is semi-random.
---
each shot has predetermined recoil and a random aspect. that randomness is the diamond. it's called that because the total amount of random recoil is fixed, so more horizontal equals less vertical and vice versa, giving the possible outcomes an upside down diamond shape.
---
Just a side note your flair doesn’t work I only see cav, clash, recruit, doc, and buck

Mute (Mark Chandar) is incredibly intelligent while smoke (James Porter) is equally intelligent but comes off as a bit stupid sometimes based on personality. This artist reimagined the SAS ops as a family and Thatcher is describing his 'kids'

Any word on how to get Montagne’s elf skin?

Im really enjoying the new season.
---
Pretty legit
---
Smh. Butthurt because you enjoy the same joke rammed up your ass over n over. Sad.
---
Honestly I feel pretty great about this season. The new ops are interesting, some of the trouble stuff is getting nerfed (hello, jackal), and I have enjoyed the map rework. Also it's so nice to have good maps in the rotation for ranked. Less shitty maps means more competitive games. I don't really see a lot of toxicity tbh. I know it exists, and I'm not denying it's there, just that on pc I really don't see it nearly as much as I read about it on here.
---
Just watch out ,check windows and dont run like moron towards building
---
I'm pretty sure it's always been indestructible
---
If fuze was in the picture...
---
I see where you're coming from and tbh I agree completely about the ops and the maps, but I still don't know why I can't enjoy the game anymore
---
If the site was upstairs, than that’s what you get for roaming with rook
---
Nah there have def been quite a few spots you can bust up. Now it seems the whole thing is solid - which is an unfortunate change to say the least.

Hey how did you get your language changed to German with English subtitles?
---
It's possible it's burn out? I get that way about siege when I play for a long time without letting up. I take a couple weeks or a month off, come back, and it feels pretty fresh again. Whatever it is, I hope you find something you do enjoy or enjoy a break from it! Good luck out there :)

---
I always assumed this was a bug, not a nefarious way to push the new ops.
---
I know that. Only French, Spanish, and Portuguese are listed for me. Deutsch/German isn't appearing. Did you happen to buy a European copy and of the game?
---
good, now go compete with the rest of the world

I mean that's cool and all, but isn't Siege set in a near future? They could put Heroes 9 or the next Assasin's creed, ya know.
---
Weird stuff is weird.  I like it.
---
Hmm. Is your region set for NA?
---
Neither, it says GSG9 right in the description. Special Forces
---
Technically your knife did register hitting the shield. And for the shotgun: your aim was in the middle of an empty space under montys armpit so the spread didn't cover enough damage for an injure. As you may have noticed there is no indicator in this game for stray bullets hitting the target. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Why hide your laser when you can just not have one at all?
---
and my axe
---
aww dang it, i was about to post that
---
Do you have a defense T-Hunt that's good for aim prac?
---
Mira that's on the wall, who's the thiccest one of all?

Played for a bit then stopped for ages. Stared again a few months ago most kills in a game before this was 5
---
Please do share with others my dude! That's extremely helpful for me. Im glad you liked it.
---
nice try smurf. /s
---
Cuz you either have one and get the benifits and cons  or dont have one and no benifits. Thats youre choice for the round
---
Wait when did they add actual games? They used to be silly ones.
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
Okay, because of all the negative feedback, I'm just saying that neither me nor any of my friends actually use the laser attachment, and there really is no reason to. I just put up this post so that laser attachments actually affected the person using it in a positive way, rather than giving away their position.
---
MY HEART
---
I think people miss the point of this spot. If you are going TO 2nd floor, FROM 1st floor, this is a great placement. No one will stop mid stair case to figure out how to shoot it. Thats IF they manage to see the lasers... now if you are going to 1st floor from 2nd floor, obviously its easier to spot. But no claymore is placed at the top of a stair case to stop people from going down... so this is less in the immediate line of sight for players running UPSTAIRS.
---
what benefits?
---
Why is this so heart warming ?
---
And then IQ comes out of nowhere and shoots Mozzie in the head and curb stomps recruit.

Hey, ik I can look this up, but how much does it cost to buy one?
---
I have never experienced this and am relatively new to R6S, as some people consider. All I could say is good luck!
---
Tighter hipfire spread, especially with shotguns
---
Nah they are just trolling, I'm diamond and lvl 240 and still get kicked as soon as I join
---
No because they can still pre fire thru it
---
It’s not sharp
---
No. The map is too iconic, it’s *the* map of siege. It has too many issues to fix that a rework would turn it into a whole new map and destroying its iconography. I’d rather they stick to reworking competitively unviable maps like Skyscraper or Chalet. House is just too special.
---
Yessssssssssssssssssssss
---
Dude if you are droning, opening up walls, planting, holding angles on defuser post plant, you won't get as many kills as an ash who's just running about fragging
---
Kali is bitch
---
It’s really sad that they think they’re good. It’s like using a motorcycle to win a bike race then calling all the cyclists trash. Use a controller or switch to PC you childish cowards. And No, using one to “level the playing field” is a BS excuse to also cheat.
---
Oh you either pop off with the Deagle or you lose. Nökk is for punishing people who aren't paying 100% attention. She's not a great op, but she's not super low tier I would say.
---
When?
---
Oh that is exactly what I meant lol. 
---
That'd be so fun to play as, and absolutely broken to play against. 
---
Cheers to all the old timers that somehow have stuck around through all Ubis bs 🍻
---
wut did I just read. Warden isn't shit because his weapon.  Jackal will always be crazy useful any roam heavy map, not because of his weapon. Nokk is just nokk. Same as Amaru, I feel they're strat reliant ops and you won't see that till high tier play.
---
Is Waimai good? Btw how do you pronounce his operator name?
---
"Some Chinese building"
---
You know that's what it's supposed to be, right?
---
Every time I see one of these posts I wonder how many online multiplayer games the poster has played lmao
---
this is **so cute**
---
A new hop
---
A building with absolutely cohesive interesting theme? Ok
---
This is probably the poorest organized list I've ever seen.
---
Damn..... someone found footage of me trying to kill a drone again.......
---
I’ve played a lot and siege is by far the worst
---
It’s half a sec, rogue-9 did a video on her but that time is pointless since it really is enough time for some to stand in front of you,360 and still shoot you in the head
---
Tbh while creating the list, i was rushing myself

I’m on Xbox, if you want somebody to play with I’m happy to help. You can add me @Xvvn if you’re interested.
---
Nice

Now this is a great post.
---

---
Awsome. You look ready to snap a few femurs.
---
Frost smg doesn’t really need to be recycled and the Mk14 and the K1A won’t be obsolete because of bosg acog, people are trying it because it’s new but if you want to be competitive you need to play the other option .
---
bust through that hard wall, yeet in flashbangs, and get a hold on the obj with your fraggers! yee haw

Lol

Funny
---
Says the guy who uses “fag” multiple times as an insult. Get over yourself man.
---
Disagree with last statement
---
Muzzle break is useful for vertical kick. Of course, you should take it on semi-autos, but it is also useful for guns that have strong upward kick but negligible horizontal (iq’s 552, buck’s c8 whatever).
---
From what I recall, compensator does nothing for vertical recoil and just reduces the horizontal spread, muzzle break reduces vertical recoil greatly for 1st shot and then less for subsequent bullets, flash does a bit of both and is almost never wrong to take
---
&amp; when he does argue he uses slurs &amp; derogatory terms in order to get his point across. It’s insanely silly.
---
to play with friends on other consoles. I don't want to unlock or buy all the ops twice.
---
Feels bad. Did you consent though?
---
This is the way
---
Or round losing, if it's the wrong Mira.
---
Any idea  I just hear good things about this indie game really affecting and poetic and the artistic direction is really beautiful but never play
---
This so wholesome, without being overdone. Low-key Fuze would be great in it!
---
yeah but her "real" name is Jaimini Kalimohan Shah. The codename kali is just a nickname/shorten version of her name. Unlike the other original operators that has codenames related to their equipment.
---
"a bit"
---
Learn maps and know what are the best walls to open, you should always open the most important wall first (for example the armory wall on border)  then you can use your second charge on any wall you think would help the team 
---
Never rush out of spawn or challenge spawnpeekers, thermite is a high value operator (meaning he's  important to the team to win the round and needs to stay alive until his job is done). Once you have opened up any important walls you can do whatever you think needs to be done, usually it'll be planting the defuser or watching angles for your team.
---
That's the basic mentality to have when playing thermite, a few more tips are: 
---
-Thermite should be your main "droner" ( drone out an area for your team mates and give call outs)
---
-The assault rifle is generally the better choice, most people are only gonna use the shotgun when missing around, pistol choice is between more bullets or more damage 
---
-Claymore or flashbang are both good choices, claymore can be used on maps where run outs are popular and flashes can be used 
---
-Thermite never stops being useful, he's great for both new comers and competitive players, and nobody will complain about thermite mains 
---
-Always protect your Thatcher, he's your brother from across the pond
---
Nope
---
Now, touch your toes
---
That shows if you are in the pregame lobby, not if you are in a match or not. 
---
Its just left over code from the old days where you were stuck on the lobby page just chatting with the other players until the match starts. 
---
You can pull out of the lobby without getting an abandon penalty.
---
Congratulations ya played yourself
---

Basically horizontal recoil such as when use ela scorpion and it goes impossible to predict from left and right

You cant compare 2 support ops that have 2 different roles and then determine which is better since they both have different set roles even with one who is a hardbreacher and the other intel.

---
Tking someone because he didn't do what you wanted him to do. Entitled and juvenile.
---
How the hell do you recommend that they detect and ban that are using 3rd party controllers.
---
Cause thats what the game sees, all M&amp;K users are using 3rd party adapters to convert the M&amp;K into controller input. They arnt just using M&amp;K native, thats already disabled in r6s. 
---
Also what do you think will happen with your new sub, random people reporting random players for M&amp;K, The support staff isnt going to randomly start banning people off because some guy online thinks a player is using a M&amp;K.
---
Not everyone who gets posted on the sub will be reported, once it reaches a certain number of upvotes then the cheaters will be reported
---
Ahhh that's hot... That's hot

---
I was thinking about that, but that would’ve given away my position upstairs since they knew I was holding blue stairs already

They are fun to play. You just have to learn the map and adjust your playstyle/operator choices in order to suit the map.

Its an audio tracker from nahimic. Dont have it installed atm. But if i remember right then this is how you remove it
---
Press the windows key and write nahimic.

open the program and look at the leftside.

The audio tracker should be there or in the settings
---
open it and find a disable
---
Might also be under keybinds think the keybind is alt f1
---
Hope this helps :)
---
That’s not the whole story though. With the fall of the Soviet Union came a massive wave of privatization, commodification, and outright shutdown of countless economic and social programs/services. That precipitated into one of the worst drops in life expectancy and quality of life in recent history. Wasn’t just political reorganization.
---
Even the buff and spooky boys are nice and love to help the poor...
---
How do people remember all those weapon names
---
False, a longer barrel increases weight acting at the distance from your holstering shoulder, which counters the vertical kick a weapon has, meaning less vertical recoil to counter manually.
---
My shitty selective memory (can't even remember WW2's most important dates but i can precisely tell each operator's loadout)
---
Yea the Indian serves are grow quite rapidly
---
I like it, it would be interesting to see if it was a static price or if it was dynamic one based on the your chance of getting an Alpha pack if they implemented it.

Oh well

And an instant reply? Oh boy, I can safely assume you are up past bedtime. Better go to sleep kid, you got school in the morning

Mine was 14 kills 4 deaths. I would kill almost the entire enemy team and then die to the last guy. That game also had my first ever ace.
---
They're trying their best.
---
Yeah, I saw this pro league strat on his channel.
---
Goo and Kali ARE codenames lol.

so what, if you want Balanced stuff go play ranked or unranked. Quick match should be a casual mode where you just have fun, not another version of ranked.

Meh. People get all emotional and shit about their videogame rank. If it really bothers you, I suggest that as soon as someone acting dumb af you just go ahead and mute them. Make callouts and shit and be as neutral as you can be when someone is playing something picky like mira on certain sites, and just roll with the punches. 
---
It doesn't feel great, but muting works 100% of the time. Some people might make the argument that muting them works against you cause you miss calls and shit... trust me... get used to trusting your ears more than your peers. I'm not saying their calls are useles... just that your ears rarely lie. Just like a dogs nose never lies. 
---
Good luck out there. Eventually youll probably make some friends and they can tag along. It makes everything much more cheery.

They should make it so if you lose connection after the game registers your down is by the lusion gun the interogation automatically is implemented. That way no risk to caveria and the rage quitting hurts his team.

Just a few seconds is all you need for unreinforced ones.

The reinforced ones have some strategies that are either fastest/safest/a bit of both.I use the X strat from one each corner to the opposite, it's said to be the safest and still quite fast.

Compensator on any guns that don't have high first shot recoil or little side to side recoil. Fire rate isn't the primary reason for picking it. Muzzle brake used to be pretty competitive with flash hider before it got nerfed twice. Silencer isn't popular because most of the time it doesn't take half a second to kill everyone unless you miss a lot (and in that case you'd probably need an attachment that actually improves recoil). Also not everyone plays with the white fire markers on.
---
Maybe just hacker then
---
oh Yea close to the toilets, I forgot
---
Ye I wanted to post it on european time it was 2am when I posted it
---
Personally i find i have to be pretty close to my 'victim' before i start the hunt, and it depends on the situation, some rooms you'll have to sprint through to keep the element of surprise either way, sometimes its around a corner.
---
you can usually use her ability on the other side of the map to get in and sweep for roamers while your team distract nearer to site, also, this is usually the easiest to pull off on your own.
---
either way, i find her job is either rush site unseen and frag at least 2 enemies, or to roam clear the rest of the map. she's not very versatile, and is better on particular maps that i can't think of off the top of my head.

Mute.
---
Top row 5th across I'll try add the new ops by the end of the week if your interested
---
If siege is there, wouldn’t that mean if the operators would were to boot up the game they would see themselves and the exact situation they would be in, since siege exists in that universe?
---
I would love a 3v3 game-mode, super fast rounds, with simple level layouts.
---
Ying.
---
She's is prolly the trickiest operator to get to work, but once you figure her out she's amazing.

---
Mute is underrated?
---
[Little known fact, but the shot _has to hit_ for it to register.](https://i.imgur.com/EO76yRn.png)
---
Weight isn't tho only factor in recoil, the reason a longer barrel is associated with higher damage is because the gunpowder spends more time under high pressure (before the bullet leaves the barrel) and as a result burns more completely which in turn increases the exit velocity of a bullet.
---
On long barrel guns (rifles) the barrel is usually long enough to where this effect is negligible, but in shorter barrel guns like handguns, SMG's, or SBR's (the latter two are the guns in siege with the extended barrel attachment) this effect results in a significantly noticeable recoil increase. And i know for a fact that this is accurate, cause i actually own a desert eagle with a 6 inch barrel and a spare 8 inch barrel. 
---
In other words, #FALSE#, recoil is not that simple.
---
Zironic's nade
---
After the reverse of the candelas she isn't the same more

It may be unbalanced but many people enjoy the map. If it was in ranked I understand why it would need to be removed but removing some maps like house from casual doesn’t really make sense to me
---
Always carry a few impacts in your bathrobe pocket too, just in case.

Its okay, skyscaper is unneccessarily huge with multiple redundant rooms. Sometimes I find entirely new sections I've never seen before.
---
I mean the more time passes the more people forget about warden so more situations of people using flash bangs
---
that drawing is amazing
---
On short barrel guns, a longer barrel will increase recoil, i left a comment explaining the effect to another reply.
---
This is correct
---
Let me fix this

This season's event will be about the Six Invitational and apart from the skins and filtered, it will be a new map set in a stadium
---
Fake. You can't hit an hipfire shot with the BOSG. The bible forbids that.
---
Wdym. They have less drones which means less intel to attackers.
---
You can’t see it clearly
---
my first thought was “oh shit they’re droning”
---
Mozzie or Mute. They fulfill a unique role in that they can deny droning from the attackers, and Mozzie takes control of the drones and uses it as his own, Mute can completely deny them as long as his hammers are up, forcing the enemy to face check a lot. Both are extremely fun and extremely useful. When the enemy brings Lion and Dokk, you’re gonna want Mute on your team.

yess finally doing 360 no scope

New map leak in another 1000 posts . Use search function for god’s sake

What about it is a spoiler? I mean there is no plot, no story that could be "spoiled".
---
here are some leaks about the mode
---
1. there will be a new map
---
2. there will be a pick and ban

3. all operators that have a r6 invitational skin will have it as default

I didn’t know that one though
---
This might sound bad but a school map would be cool, and realistic.
---
when you get shot at, there's a white line that appears on your screen indicating the direction the shots come from, so if you shoot at someone and you have a suppressor on, those lines wont appear for the enemy.
---
Literally a different game back then, people hate on it now but they have no idea what it used to be
---
Well yes but I suck at grenades and captao is banned every time I play him so I have to ban clash too
---
They trick me an I dont caer anymore
---
I’m fairly sure you can’t. The toilet blocks the wall off I think. Haven’t played siege properly in 2 seasons so I could be wrong.
---
That doesn’t mean the map is in Brazil
---
Why it was here for like a week and I got to play it twice
---
Nah. His guns are below average (the exception being the M590), his gadget is situational as hell, and there are far better ops to bring than him. Only time I use warden competitively is when the enemy brings Ying and smokes consistently. 
---
You wanna run shotgun and machine pistol? Play Mute or Smoke. You want a 2 speed with the MPX? Play Valk. You want to deny smokes and flashes? Play Jager and deny a shit ton of other things as well. You want to deny smoke plants? Play maestro and get a fucken MG32.
---
ooo nice

How many times are you going to post this? I have seen the same post 5 times from you already.

it's useless to chase them and not help reinforce or lock down the obj. if you can get a few of them really quickly, then that's good. but chasing them is just dumb.

I guess after that it seems a little balanced. Cool operator overall, want to get it clear that I'm not hating on you I would use this operator if it was in game.

Ya I'm not even sure if that was alpha or pre-alpha. I know the clip you're referring to. Can you imagine how frustrating it would've been if people could open up the entire ceiling to drop through? I think a lot of times games like this compromise realism for fun in a lot of areas. I really enjoy the balance of the 2 right now. That's only my opinion though.
---
Please put Tchaikovsky over this. Please.
---
It's also insanely useful for beginners. You can't get lost in that map and that means you're always able to understand what's going on and what each operator is capable of doing.

What leak?

it was big brain placement

My game takes like 60 gig

Makes sense if you think about it
---
Is that a bug or did you find a way to mod the game ? It would be interesting to use that trick to open all maps.
---
who the hell doesn’t like leaks? that shit gets me excited af
---
Probably Tactical Combat ShotGun if I had to make a guess
---
Yar yar days
---
That's the thing; my logic is that you would want the first shot to be accurate for covering long distance angles, since with MP5s's natural low recoil, you would most likely hit the head even if the muzzle break first shot was aimed let's say to the neck... I think I'll tinker with flash and muzzle a bit more and find what's suits me the most, thanks
---
Even if you're playing to win then both teams still fight on a level playing field.   
---
Map imbalance becomes a problem for ranked when the game starts producing too many stalemates which makes it harder for to gauge the overall MMR.   
---
But stalemates in casual only mean you're playing more rounds against each other.

Somehow with the reverse damage TK seems a bit  useless... you lose one teammate and can be reported for griefing as well.
---
Best is to report and kick the offending player if possible.
---
Usually if you ignore their childish behaviour, they stop as noone seems to react or they just start TKing in which case there is nothing else they can do the rest of the game.
---
The issue here is that solo queuing usually in competitive games leads to these situations and it cannot be fixed without a strict ban policy or strict matchmaking rules. Most pvp games now try to throw toxic players in a single lobby, but it does not work well since you never know your toxicity meter or how to get rid of it - in the end, it just generates more bad teammates.
---
The feels man, I've had those days and have been both sides of this video lmao
---
Each has it's own advantages. Advantage of deleting is you can have them in obj. Advantage of redirecting and blowing up is you can have them at entrances from where attackers throw stuff, basically making them rethink their throws, or waste utility OR out themselves at risk OR move away.
---
Jäger is good as place and forget. Wamai is good for wasting time. A LOT of time.
---
Mozzie is a 3 speed
---
I’ve hated every single change they gave to warden. He was fine as a 3 armor, he’s already an anchor and having 3 armor would let him tank shots while standing still to see through smoke. He needs impacts so he can run a primary SMG for range and not rely on the SMG-12. I really want him to get the P90, but buff it up a bit. Reduce recoil for sure and maybe increase damage. It’s a perfect primary for warden. 
---
I have no clue how to play Goyo, but most of the pros do. They all agree he needs a nerf, so I trust them on that. Amaru’s Gadget can be good, but it’s dependent on the map. On consulate, she’s great. 
---
Nøkk should have a good gun, but I want her to have an AR rather than an SMG. I think attackers should have AR’s and defense should have SMG’s. It’s how it’s been for the past 4 years, so idk why they change it for Nøkk. I would absolutely love if Nøkk got Zof’s AR. It’s similar to the L85, one of the most balanced guns in the game, isn’t too bad with a suppressor, and has an acog. If not that, I guess the M4 or C8-SFW would be fine.
---
it gets worse after you've been playing for over 2 years and go back and look at your first clip

That combination is pretty good one, the Ryzen stock cooler also works extremely well considering it comes with the cpu. I also splurged a bit when it came to aesthetics and spent an extra £30 on a gpu that had addressable rgb lighting. An AIO would be good but for a 2600 it is a bit overkill. If you're into overclocking however and getting the most performance possible I could see why you would go for that cooling option. Here in the UK for about an extra £20 (around $30 I think) you could get the Ryzen 7 2700 which could take advantage of that AIO a lot better since it has more core and threads that need cooling. But the setup you have going on does sound pretty good

its not about walking through, its about making her more versatile

Good to know. I know the stock cooler is a pretty good one which is why I felt pretty good about using it for a bit and honestly an AIO I mostly want for the aesthetics and the “cool” factor without spending a billion dollars on a custom loop(which is also awesome and I think would be awesome one day). But the ryzen 7 2700 doesn’t sound like a bad idea either if it’s only that much more expensive. Good to know! Thanks!
---
This is amazing.
---
r/decreasinglyverbose
---
Okay yes no can’t compare roamer to anchor, every time you’re picking ops for a round, you’re essentially compare all of the ops to see who would better suit the team you have, which you basically kinda said anyways. The point I’m trying to make here, is to me these ops offer no new advantage that would make me want to switch off of my old role. Yes Nokk offers a good intel denial and hides you from cams, but I would rather take IQ take down the cam, push site. Yes Amaru has a fast movement ability that’s not in the game that gets you on sight, but I’d rather rush as Ash who is fast af and has an undeniably better weapon, plus utility the whole team can benefit from. 
---
When you’re taking a soft destructor you look at Buck and Sledge and go “Do I want more overall destruction, or do I want less that has a great range and I can also use as a reliable weapon close quarters?” Every time you pick you are essentially comparing the ops in the role you’re filling, and I don’t think these ops (Btw I mainly mean Nokk, Warden, Amaru, And Goyo) have an advantage in any role that a pre existing operator doesn’t do better, or a pre existing op that doesn’t offer more

I can understand your pov, it would be an interesting way to play her

I did slight research, minimum is a gtx 460 about, accourding to siege specs, and accourding to a website, the graphics card you have is as good as an Gefroce 820M, accourding to GPUBoss, GTX 460 is better for gaming. Accourding to another website that compares graphics cards, the 820M, has 2gb of ram, compared to the 768 of the GTX 460. But, in every other spec, the 820M is out powered almost 2:1 or more. So I doubt it will run the game, I mean, if you want to have the game on your steam or uplay account, go ahead. If you are ever going to get a better laptop, than yes, get the game, if not, it might not be worth trying without further research on the strength of your graphics card. I doubt it will work, then again, its almost christmas and can get a new laptop most likely. Good luck!

Yeah I'm trying to find reasons to still play. I'm tired of the inconsistent matchmaking where I get placed with bronze/silvers against plats and  they all leave mid-game. Its exhausting after a while. Its not as easy as it sounds to find competent people to play with on discord either, most are spergy and annoying. The good ones are nearly always plat or above and expect you to perform and don't play for fun.

You're obviously new to siege but thats ok. There are maps that are objectively unbalanced, house is one of them. Doesn't mean its not a fun map to play on, they all are if you're just messin around.

Whos the operator?
---
I guess 2000 hours plat 1 is new
---
seriously, why is the second russian operator on attack and defense not in the same row as the other base game operators
---
mildly infuriating
---
The games just toxic, I dont encounter toxicity too too much anymore but I play in squads with friends usually queue with high levels.

What you’re dealing with is high ranks creating new acc or dropping to low ranks just to bully the actual low rank people like you.... up in high gold and low plat this isn’t the case but people apparently like bullying the new guys...

Nah, I think I pass on this one, looks ugly in my opinion.

Lmao looks like it

I first thought this was a combination of Oregon and old Hereford rooms. But after slowly watching more and more the video while "mind locating" me in the actual Oregon based on where he is in the video, I really think this is a reworked Oregon.
---
* There is no more small and big towers 
---
* He enters the building in Master bedroom, right above the Main entrance
---
* "Target" room door from "Armormy hallway" is a window in the actual Oregon. And this entire room + red "office" hallway + office room are replacing the Attic (he shoots at windows in red corridor, same windows on the attic and the red hallway + adjacents rooms width equals the attic+both halfroofs width in actual Oregon)
---
* The hatch in kids room to kitchen is still there, kids room seems bigger (maybe including the small part with the double window south of kids room)
---
* Big tower is the blue staircaise
---
* When he goes down blue stairs, you have the soft wall to Meeting + the path on the right, he goes left to a new "garage" hallway
---
* But there is no more meeting, it has been replaced by a smaller "Piano" room + Living room (you can see it when he's inside Piano) and a new "garage" hallway on the west side. You can tell this when he goes back to Main entrance after exiting the garage. In the actual Oregon, coming from Main entrance to Meeting, you can go left or right, now left is Piano room, right is Garage hallway
---
* The garage room is 100% new aswell, making another entry point into the building. Same width as the old garage which is now Lockers room
---
* Old classroom is still there, the Main entrance seems intact. 
---
* The he goes into "bathroom" hallway, with the same bathroom, same "yellow" staircase heading to dormitories (walls in yellow, they like to compartmentalize maps by colors now)
---
* No more toilets on the left when you go towards the deleted small tower.
---
* Dining is still there, with some cover on the left when you enter it from outside :D
---
* And there is an exterior staircase from Dining door to somewhere up.
---
Try to watch the whole thing with my notes if you can't map yourself in the actual Oregon while watching, you'll see :)
---
I did not say that. Read again.
---
I said cheaters are still able to play for almost the whole season before getting caught and it has been like that since year 1. Moreover, it does not mean much banning their accounts as it seems they come back.
---
Thermpus gonna put children in his sack and beat them with a stick.
---
But like Just play better. It’s not hard.
---
People on tiktok are brain dead
---
Nonetheless, it was a nice shot.
---
using the 725 too
---
Wow very cool nice Work
---
Wasnt that scripted (i.e. custom match)?
---
Why tf is it called bang art lmao
---
'Art Bang' elite
---
Agreed. They just went crazy on it
---
What crazy theory? It's Tom Clancy Lore that they train in simulations fighting each other.
---
I'm ok with slow changes to the permanent maps. Keeping things essentially the same reduces the amount of time you have to spend relearning, helps keep people from freaking out about losing their favorite maps, and allows for better balancing of poorly designed bomb sites.
---
After 3 minutes just restart
---
First of all, yes you have indicator that tells you someone needs as stim. You can **all the time** see health of you teammates at the top of the screen. If you hear a gunfight or explosion, glance if your teammate who was involved is ok. If this is too difficult for you, then don't pick the only operator that can heal and leave him for someone who actualy have a clue how to play him.
---
There are always people who **are healers** and do their job and morons who pick a character with healing ability then play it like a tank. Don't be a dick, mate nad git gud.
---
Don’t sprint much, 400 DPI look sense around 10-40
---
Ads sense at around 83. Careful of spawn peeks.
---
Meh, it's a silly game. Plus, recently I didn't see any cheating in R6. When it was indeed bad, it was worse than that cartoon game. People would straight up teleport under you and kill you as soon at match started.
---
Because it's a lot harder to stop teammates from running into explosives and shit well after you throw them (on accident) than it is to stop firing your gun when someone is running by you. It's incredibly easy to avoid shooting teammates. Just be aware of whats going on. But if I throw a grenade in a room and ash rushes in right after and blows herself up I really shouldn't be punsihed as harshly, if at all.

---
Thank you, at least I have confidence.
---
You would be able to open and close these
---
With the comments people made about health I doubt they will redo one soon. It’s much needed but people always say shit about health when it actually helped the game a lot.
---
I like the idea but but Ubisoft sees The game is getting larger and larger so they are getting more teams too focused on certain aspects of the game so before you know it the game will be better Hiring even more people
---
Yes I guessed that, it doesn’t bring *that* much.
---
I didn't know they put Lady Gaga in Rainbow Six.
---
2 of the 5 people killed each other.

and it's a big problem

Thank you

---
Never happened to me, but I'm sorry you're being tk'd.
---
Um this game is rated M buddy...jk anyways you can’t play official pro league under 18 but most of the tournaments I see on like IG pages I don’t think they have an age requirement? I’m not 100% but I’m pretty sure it doesn’t matter
---
Ya got spunk so you might have a chance to beat me
---
Oh most definitely
---
What’s a victory if it’s doesn’t involve taking risks?
---
*Cod operator screen being call of dutyied*
---
Mission failed we'll get em next time
---
Paint ball potential.
---
yea i agree it should mainly be ctu’s but id also like a few ‘normal people’ not from any CTU’s
---
I was told by Ubisoft support that skins in Siege have different values across platforms, so they can't exactly see what items you have and transfer them. There might be a slight chance of success with screenshots, though I have not tried this strategy yet.
---
The bugs back😕
---
Breh faze be lnocking down your door
---
* 8
---
They go down the pecking order in terms of which op is played the most. I assume ela was next before her shotty got nerfed
---
I mean that’s what Kali is technically, she’s from her own PMC group. But Rainbow is supposed to be like a coalition of the worlds best to stop any terrorist attacks, so they’re most likely gonna stick to CTUs

Who did my dumbass miss? Oh yeah warden.

Dude idc what everyone else says I love it, the historical counterculture context and the aesthetic, it's got such old-school-cool vibes, plus it serves her character and story, 10/10 &lt;3

FYI the title says "live the moment"
---
Oh I thought you said oh god thinking I want to see pregnant women to die for finale or smth. :)
---
You cant just ask who's better. You have to look at the operator's guns and ability and decide. If you have good aim and prefer high damage, Kali is for you. If you want a safer bet as an operator with a semi-useful ability and nice lmg, pick ying. Up to you.
---
I liked it at first and as the trailer went on I started to hate it.
---
favela is super fun
---
I mean... You don't need to pay hehe
---
Thank you sir i'll try that

At least it's better then IQ's shit ("elite) skin.

I love it......but her guns are so shit now

Ela was never "thicc", the only people who said otherwise are people making a joke and white people who call anything not a literal stick, thick.
---
Papers please.
---
It's RNG recoil,  can't be controlled.  That's why it's bad.
---
I have a feeling ur imaroadcone alt acc
---
Are you guys having issues fixing her? No offense but you seem to be disabling her almost every other season because people keep finding ways to exploit her. So glad you had happen to catch that in time though. It's important for people (Both devs and players) to catch and report these issues immediately to make the game more enjoyable.

Mira Inspiración seems to come from the Spanish civil war (1936-1939). And digging a little bit, here is a very iconic picture of a 17-years-old soldier in Barcelona, which looks veeeery similar:

There’s a few. I got banned for calling out a dude for MnK

i'm mad i got it spoiled by videos of hackers who already had it

Don't hate the player, hate the game. Besides, I don't know why he gets so much hate anymore. In his current state, 2 clicks from any gun with an RPM over 500 and his shield is already broken

She’s here now!

If they had a KBM playlist for console so they can play with PC I'd be so psyched for that.
---
IQ's is one of the worst, elite or not.
---
If only Tachanka was a little more **chunky** and Mozzie a little shorter.
---
Big oof
---
Ok now that’s not okay.
---
Diamond player, I run 35, 72,30
---
That’s a good one
---
Only a week but still fucking stupid. Fuck these mods man.
---
Wait... am I missing something here? Didn’t they make the hostage immune to fire damage a little bit after ember rise? Did they undo that?
---
Yeah, it's a no from me dawg.
---
Looks straight up terrible. And I'm usually very open-minded to stuff. There's enough negativity around that I usually shut up or at least include some positivity. But this is bad.
---
I don’t have the game but the M4 was always the fun I used in cod. Guess I’ll be an asshole soon but I’ll try not to use shitty perks and and stuff with it
---
No need to rush. Take all the time you need
---
Thats unlucky i got a black ice within my first day
---
"Hi! I'm Ela Bosak and you're watching Disney Channel"
---
The celebration is trashcan
---
It’s so bad, I love ela but this is just disappointing
---
It would make her immune to damage as well
---
Were you playing casual? If you get kicked (by an asshole 4 stack or something) before you fully load in it will show this
---
Always said her’s would be 100% better if they threw a Kevlar vest over it or something. Like he had been at the gym but had to run support on an incident suddenly.
---
if only her gun wasnt complete dogshit at longer than 10 meters

Hello ravenobj, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e9ulvg/breaching_with_ocd/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I just want an echo elite already
---
i’m not gonna do that but i appropriate the gesture
---
Why is this a prob-
---
You know what, nevermind. I learned not to question the internet anymore.
---
Cav elite for R6 Invitational, then? Or are we done because of the 2 Elites a season rule?
---
Bear in mind I play Xbox. Might not be as optimal for PS4
---
I play with friends but none of us are really that good and they don’t really care about the game as much as I do.
---
She already has an amazing pistol and both primaries are still fine
---
The elites haven't been that cool recently nothing compared to Thatcher or fuze
---
No im saying if you dont have friends to plau with or your team doesnt seem interested in working together or helping yoi then dont play an op that relies heavily on teamwork.
---
Yeah its just how we work we see are favorite streamers say this and that and then it becomes you way of seeing that one thing honestly people can't think for themselves but that's a different topic altogether but yeah most people that say there op have probably never played them mor then once
---
No but I'm assuming that in a game developer's POV, why would you want only one thing to be good? It doesn't really make sense.
---
Rip brother lol
---
He's incredibly insecure.

We got you three to one

“I like those odds”

Nah that's Marcus from Gears of War!

Monty is used to waiting, and getting shot in the back of the head by teammates.
---
Her face just doesn't look right
---
My wallet looking at me like “please no, not again”
---
I don't think that's like... a strictly wrong point of view, but you can certainly see something being too powerful and nerfing it just to bring it in line with the power curve of the SMG without worrying if people are under picking the SMG. I'm sure many players, like myself, choose their weapon based on sites and maps they are playing. 
---
I don't think it was nerfed strictly under the guise they wanted the SMG picked more. Just that they were seeing some over performance with the shotgun.
---
Major TERF vibes
---
Okay so I did a little more research for ya, it looks like it’s related to a graphics card start up check make sure your graphics card is updated or reinstall the drivers. Try that
---
all i want is to stop getting shit for ops i dont play
---
She just vibin
---
Love that outfit. Not a big fan of the hairstyle.
---
or is it!
---
Yeah but sometimes its fun to challenge yourself with playing different ops like its easy to just rush with ash and frag but then to change to monty and be so bad at doing anything its just not fair you just get bullied and don't get to fight back
---
No. Her gadget is broken as hell, and if played correctly in CQC she's absolutely bonkers. 
---
Why do you think she has such a high winrate?
---
Ewwwwwww why that’s so bad
---
I wasn’t talking about you doing it, and it’s arguable that that’s a spawnpeak
---
Then pick blitz instead for solo. Or play other support ops.
---
Bugging bro. The recoil is already stupid because it’s high and it’s random.
---
Dang Lara Croft still up there...
---
Noooo my girl is gone again- I genuinely like playing Clash big rip
---
Truly Elite

Gunhero1230 on Xbox one

Theyre not rotated equally

Why does it remind me so much of Mira from just cause 4

I agree
---
No really, I can solo to plat 2 recently. Sometimes random players may help a lot.
---
It’s cuz u have the wrong version, the new version is called shitting toads

I tried it everywhere, Reddit was my last hope. Someone told me that only bodyshots now knock, arms and legs are ~97dmg.

To be fair I've always enjoyed Tower, though it's not my favourite

Lol I played for like one weekend and remembered what cod mp is. 
---
The campaign was fun just needed to be twice as long.

Same, maybe refund for half the price? so we get something back
---
Everyone is forgetting about the Ash elite skin in Chimera, although it was only a variation.

Lmao fuck that shit. Insurgency sandstorm is 15 bucks this week.

It's definitely not an amazingly pistol, the only great thing it has going for it is the sight
---
Ya
---
ya i have 7 hg for iq only time i play her is for the daily and ubisoft club dailies
---
If you had an account back then :( I switched to PC after and I can't get it

Its got good damage, good reload and a built in sight
