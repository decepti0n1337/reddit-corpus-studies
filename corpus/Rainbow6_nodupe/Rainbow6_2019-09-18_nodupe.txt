Yeah, I’m all for nerfing shields but that was honestly almost useless nerf. I mean, if you’re one v one you’d just knife the dude again. Or hip fire confirm kill if you suspect someone’s nearby. Only Doc can be a threat in this situation anyways.
---
---
---
If you play on PC you can at least still play the game.
---
I agree with mozzie and gridlock being perfect, both of them have brought gadgets that have effected the meta
---

---
Nokk and Warden were two ops that were extremely underwhelming and added nothing to attack or defence 
---
Goyo I think will be like mozzie, I feel like a lot of players will create strats with him quickly, while Amaru is similar to when gridlock launched, we just need to give it time to see how useful she is
---
This is exactly how I play both Kaid and Nomad. AUG with holo, ARX with iron sights, AK with reflex, leave the acog with the pistol when I wanna get some snipes in
---
Dude same thing happens to me, it’s the funniest thing.
---
My second alpha pack ever was a duplicate. Quit the game for a week.
---
No game has lasted for ever *yet*
---
Imagine thinking someone taking 1 kill ruined your game lol (oh and it’s very ironic)
---
Restart your router/modem or disconnect things from it
---
Even then yeah you can just spam knife the fucker to oblivion
---
For those who wanna know what the Japanese says (In the order they appear):
---
- 私 は 死にたい(Watashi wa shinitai): I want to die
---
- クソチームキル (Kuso chiimukiru): Shitty teamkill 
---
- この オタク を 蹴る(Kono otaku o keru): Kick this nerd
---
- アンインストール(Aninsutooru): Uninstall
---
- 犬のキャスト(Inu no kyasuto): Dog’s Cast (Name of the channel I think)
---
Why do people do this and think this is funny. Like seriously I thought this was a glitch but according to someone it’s not and I’m guessing people who put their shields near the hostage can get banned.
---
I think hitting them with a projectile does like 5 damage alone so that is what may have killed them.
---
I mean, it's not like they missed every shot..
---
House takes me back to the first siege reveal it’s iconic
---
Um because i'm sick and tired of people posting aces or clutches that literally a cave dwelling 5 year old could pull of even if they had never seen a mouse and keyboard/controller in their life
---
Bro, was on pc during placement, got DDoS twice, or maybe three times, placed Silver 2 after fighting my damn hardest with plats and golds. Silvers and below generally don’t have a brain, if you solo queue. Still salty bout that one
---
I said 2 godly players
---
It was a flash, I was making joke
---
Kk then... I guess every night before I go to bed I'll just have to go into unranked and kill my team. So they can tear down that bullshit!!!
---
I feel like they changed the algorithm for the packs. I used to get epic/legendary stuff all the time, now all I get is commons
---
Monty requires communication and the player cant be a dimwit. I see way too many Monty players standing in corners when they shouldn't be, standing out of corners when they shouldn't be, and ADSing when a melee or even hip fire would suffice. 
---
Monty can act as a mobile attacking Mira with skilled teams and can protect plants, revives, and prevent defusals. He is also pretty intimidating as you dont know who he is calling out and just stands in OBJ half the time. Menacingly.
---
Why tf is there a report option for hacking on console. Can you even fucking hack on console?
---
I ran into the fabled SSG 5 Stack once and I started saying ever church prayer I’ve ever known. The game was a mercifully short 0-4
---
"I can only get kills when I dont have to use a gun" 
---
- I translated it for everyone
---
This reminds me about the guy complaining about r4c acog and how its unplayable now
---
I’m aware I was just trying to figure out what happens
---
Is that al madrigal?
---
Good, Kk then... I guess every night before I go to bed I'll just have to go into unranked and kill my team. So they can tear down that bullshit!!!
---
Oh ok, sorry for the confusion, carry on
---
Never seen a game take away content punishing long time players to cater to noobs. Its sad really
---
Imagine being this much of a pathetic child you think throwing a what is essentially a digital tantrum every night will make Ubisoft change anything at all.
---
I know that Nokk had an AR to begin with (Galil according to Pengu who test played her apparently) but where did you hear that Warden was 2 Speed to begin with?
---
I never heard that part before.
---
Ahahah
---
Nah I just like the extra challenge of getting right next to a fucker and a shield helps a fuckton. Yeah I guess it’s time for me to switch back to capito for my knife kills
---
Situational ah-what?-ness.
---
this happened to a friend not me, but I understand where you’re coming from. Also, the goal of this post wasn’t to downgrade siege in any way lmao, just a small thing that happened for a split second and I wanted to slightly mock the phrase that people use constantly.
---
I mean they should do something about it but i dont think they should do this
---
Oh sorry that must affect you so mutch
---
Restaurant and Tea room are two viable sites on Tower, even media centre can be made viable.
---
That makes 3 for tower.
---
Skyscraper? Tea room/karaoke is 1. And maybe work office with the castle strat if you’re lucky but it’s still shit. Skyscraper is garbage.
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

First spotted by "Sean" on the R6 Discord server this afternoon.
---
Did they take it out from the rotation completely? If so that is stupid and I predict it will be back in no time if we complain enough
---
Solo? If you are very very good with him. Otherwise no.  
---
In a Team: definitely. Not every time, but if you play well together and know exactly what strat you want to execute.
---
Ye sits just annoying ya know like play the game right it’s pretty much Makie ring her useless ya know
---
Take my upvote
---
Is cool if you think he’s good
---
Grassy ass
---
I just had a stroke reading this
---
That boi garbage
---
My bad auto correct
---
Fritwilliams shutup little bro you gotta learn what pulling your weight is and playing your part its that's what voting and having a voice is
---
I've been looking at it backwards the entire time
---
I know right
---
Monthly rotation. 3 in 3 out. Shoulda never been taken out in the first place is my point. And while you may be right i dont see enough ppl talking about this.
---
You should not be friends with that person
---
You can still play in customs
---
I disagree do you know how long it can take to get to that level I’m plat 2 level 120 and I’ve been playing a fair bit maybe that’s just my struggle with leveling up but id say I’m not that bad of a player just my opinion been playing over a year
---
In ranked you can only see level, I think your in unranked lol
---
Yeah, it's been taken out of casual rotation too, along with I think 5 others map (Plane, Yacht, Theme Park, Tower and Favela)
---
I’m currently plat 1 so I’m not sure if it’s to do with rank. If I have an unranked person or one of my mates who is a lower rank with me, I’d usually find a game on Neu pretty quickly. (Last season that is)
---
Such trash they should call him Oscar the grouch
---
Yeah, you have a voice. But so do I, and I'm using that voice to tell you you sound like an absolute idiot. Don't whine about something and not expect people to respond.
---
Lol
---
Either unranked u can’t see ranks
---
I've been playing this games since launch son dont test
---
Is imposible to get an ace with him
---
Recruit bitch
---
Lol. This is why you should never get kill hungry.
---
Makes me wanna tk
---
NOT TACHANKA
---
[removed]
---
I have gotten plenty of mmr back. But usually it takes so damn long. And that's if they even catch them. I have played with people who are very obviously cheating and they play FOREVER without getting banned.
---
Imagine seeing a drugged Scottish man running at you with a breaching hammer and a gas mask. Sledge is scary
---
Any source on that, I'm curious and would love to look into this more
---
And I'm not the kind of person who can't accept getting outplayed.
---
Scarier than caviera...
---
You’re too dirty for your own good.
---
Ryzen 2600
---
Castle be like
---
Well they do say if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
---
sometimes! it's a fun challenge and when you get them to land it feels amazing :)
---
Well now you have the unranked playlist. Literally same game as ranked minus the stakes. So you and your new friends could do unranked until they're at the right level, which would be better for anyone you queue with. Played this game for 3 years and never been banned btw, that sounds pretty sus.
---
Looks like opfor didn't main sniper in TF2, always hide the laser next to where you're watching so people can't see it
---
And not only that, I've had a friend who actually did an experiment to see how long he could play with hacks on an alternate account and he lasted through all of burnt horizon and phantom sight, he hasn't started this season yet but he is going to try
---
RIP your battery life
---
Hey man I got a gear s2. You think it'll be the same if you help?
---
It's not his thought. He stole it off twitter.
---
KG had this problem you might have to uninstall and reinstall your drivers.
---
I will be so mad lmao
---
Because he stole the pic.
---
&gt; highly doubt hundred/thousands of players have the ability to launch a DDoS or are paying for it.
---
There are free to $1 a pop services for random simple DDoS services online. We are talking about googling for 5mins and finding the service not some hackerman shit.
---
posted it as a vid instead of gif
---
Bruh. I’m done with this shit
---
The Good ol' AFK trick, I've done countless times mostly as Alibi or defenders. Here at Eastern Servers, most people are so salty they will do the act of T-Bagging you before you get knifed.
---
it might be yo intonet
---
Oh also I suggest make your vertical lower than your horizontal
---
If your talking charms they are rewarded for placement ranks for every season
---
oh i'm just saying they're way too busy with other shit and that kind of demand is like way low on the list of things that need to be in the game
---
Having Root access and setting up working DDoS Protection on a server thats handling multiple online game services are two completely different things.
---
true
---
Wait, what happened?
---
This is why you DON'T RUSH.
---
but it sounds like you are. Your post is about being beaten by a silver and unranked players as a group of golds.
---
A silver solo player could very well perform better than golds who always play as a squad. The MMR difference between gold and silver is minimal. Instead of looking at this you are automatically assuming that they are hacking and the game is broken.
---
If you have evidence of "obvious hacking" then submit it directly to ubisoft support. The players will get investigated and banned.
---
What's up with the coordinates on the border there? Do they mean anything?
---
[They have publicly acknowledged it multiple times and even have a full team trying to figure out ways to combat the issue.](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-au/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:185-352452-16&amp;ct=tcm:185-76770-32)

CONNECTIVITY Description: Players are losing control on their Operator and then being disconnected and presented with an error message. Status: We have dedicated a team specifically to these connectivity topics, and have identified a couple of issues that are sometimes interpreted as a “Denial of Service” attacks. These issues are a priority for us.
---
#1, where did i or anyone else mention excercise? 
---
#2, i wasn’t trying to be condescending, i was just putting in some perspective.
---
#3, Where is it implied that none of us have hobbies and responsibilities? You should never assume that just because someone is on the internet or playing a game, that means they have nothing else going on.
---
And finally, maybe i wouldn’t have to nag you if someone taught you to be polite
---
When you missed the shots with FAMAS i almost blinded myself

“BETA” 😂😂😂
---
Click your name then hit user flair
---
True. People aren’t even hiding the fact they’re using M&amp;K anymore. I’ve seen several people lean without ADS.
---
My bad I don't check this sub often
---
It honestly surprises me this and Chalet are still in ranked. Hopefully they get taken out next season u til they get reworked. Grievances aside, nice job! Hard to defend that map.
---
Thermite charges laserbeam the entire map so you have a thermite sized gap through everything that was in the two directions that the charge was facing.
---
Actually you wanna look at her pick rate vs her win delta. 
---
When she had a 70% pick rate her win delta was through the roof and her plat+ pick rate was 90%.
---
I use comp on the l85 for barely any side recoil, and with a vert grip it already has low vertical recoil, you should try it
---
I play Ela with fo12 and the range is pretty good. Can't use the scorpion due to recoil
---
Unless you play against anyone who is aware of the angle then you just get prefired
---
Not a one tap. He used two bullets
---
Actually, that's me getting TK

---
For all the people who say: iT w4s Unr4nk3d, it happened to me also, only in one match, but i was able to see the rank and rateo of the opponent team
---
&gt;And that dev update is from July ..
---
What you think fixing a DDoS issue is a 2 week content push or something? 
---
Its going to take time, months even. You'll be lucky if they can find the main issue, Workarounds, make a fix, Test it, and release it within this year. 
---
This isnt a simple ingame lag issue or a shield glitch they can just patch up.
---
OP did say they're new and u/JerryFromThePub gave a helpful tip to a newcomer. Frags are **rare** &amp; **powerful** and should be used *whenever* possible. Red dots give away player position🤷‍♂️I wish someone told me that when I started.
---
I love that skin for the F2
---
Thank god someone didn’t say this was unranked
---
If R6 had weapons sway, diamonds will go to copper

I keep on getting told doc is black while many images say otherwise. Can someone tell me what is doc’s canonical race?

Clutch or take the dick

I think ddosing counts as cheating
---
the golden comment
---
My birthday is the 27th lol
---
Very true. Many of my daily friends are taking a break until Ubisoft helps us. Just hope they dont take too long..
---
Operation health had nothing to do with DDoS protection or hacking. It was used to fix ingame server issues, lighting and other core gameplay issues that was there at the time.
---
He’s number one rank in the world because of DDOSing. I’m gonna say something about it and hunt the witch.
---
yea I thought someone would talk about thicc
---
Nope
---
This has been going on for a while so I wouldn’t hold your breath, I’ve already been DDOSed 3 times this season
---
He’s actual trash in game. We played one defense round and they lost then went back to DDOSing lmao
---
As in cant protect the holder? Or still powerful. I'm quite sad his ads time is very slow now
---
You’d think Ubi would catch wind of that. But hey can’t do anything because microsoft won’t let them.
---
Literally the same I’m literally downloading siege on a pc now you gotta start over tho
---
if they want to  play MnK they should just play on PC. MnK on console is shitty anyway
---
Just 3??? I played two ranked games back to back and got ddosed..then jumped into unranked and someone crashed the server there is no fun allowed
---
steam version requires you to be on steam, which then opens up uplay
---
This is true. I played the new season literally once. Not playing again until this massive pile of shit gets fixed
---
I feel lucky compared to you
---
Which Bundle should i get? 
---
The game
---
Deluxe
---
Gold 
---
Ultimate
---
You might not be playing for a while :/
---
Yeah but then they'd get their asses kicked
---
This would trigger me incredibly.
---
Precisely :)
---

I’ll take anal bum covers for 500
---
&gt;If you guys actually flooded support with videos of the Ddos in action they’d do something but hardly anyone is,
---
We shouldn't have to. This shouldn't be an issue in the first place and Ubisoft continues to ignore it for yet another season. I'm definitely doing my part getting proof and reporting.
---
&gt;instead they come here for their  positive karma and expect something to change
---
No, I think it's because people are fed up with this bullshit and want to draw attention to the gamertags of these knobheads. 'No witchhunting' this guy literally brings it upon himself being the top ranked player on Xbox. His gamertag shows up on the front page of the r6 tracker yet only because HE HASN'T LOST A GAME. It's so fucking obvious when he has a 1.05 k/d with 2.33 kills a match yet that's apparently good enough for best Xbox player in the world (spoiler: it's not).
---
Vanilla only mode, with ops before the nerfs. Acogs and all. Thermite and IQ with grenades
---
What could Ubisoft do lmao? Even if they saw this, they dont know what game it was, who your friend is, or what the actual cause was. If it's not on Ubisoft's end, then your friend needs better internet, and there is absolutely nothing that ubisoft could or should do about it.
---
Don't you mean goyos shotgun?

Kick him he was the only guy alive

Oh... Right... I'm playing on PC, and I can't use the public voice chat because my internet is fucky and it disconnects me from the public voice chat entirely. I can only play with discord squad if I want voice and I hate it!

I am
---
it really bothers me that you can cancel the reload animation after you've already ejected the magazine. I wish they would change that, so you'd have to actually be strategic with your reloads.
---
If that were me, the nade would've bounced off the wall and kobe'd me instead
---
I can hardly even finish a house T Hunt with an  R4 C on normal difficulty. I would get slapped if I tried doing that.
---
That was a gamer moment cheif
---
been there lmfaoo. those rocket league skillz pay off lmfao
---
Happened to me yesterday.
---
I was playing Mira on Fortress in Commander's Office. The rest of my team went roaming leaving me to anchor. Doc on the team got one, but they left me 1v4 with over 2min left on the clock. The enemy fucks up here and enters site one at a time, allowing me to equalize the scores.
---
In the end it was me and Lion spraying at each other as he strafed across the north doorway. I ran out of ammo in the vector and had to switch to my shotgun, as he and I got each other down to sub 20 health. I didn't have time to reload because I heard him trying to find an uncovered angle to hit me from.
---
Eventually the timer gets down to 15 seconds and he has to push into site. We dance around the column for a bit and finally he gets a lucky hit in and finishes me. 
---
All the while me and Lion were being shitters my team had a vote kick for me on. After I died I dared them to kick me since they only got a single kill between the four of them. They did and that was that. 
---
Rant over.
---
Inb4 "ubi cant do anything about it." Now I may not be a programmer but surely it cant be hard to track people who constantly stress the server
---
My friend DC-ed, he didn't do it on purpose. How the fuck is this not Ubisoft's fault for making a system which cannot differentiate between those who really break the rule in the game on purpose, and those whom are innocent and get this penalty happen to them unfairly?
---
Honestly this is the biggest reason why nothing ever gets fucking fixed. All the time guys like you always make excuses for Ubisoft. "How is this their fault?" "What can they do?" 
---
This is on them because they made this game, they made this system.
---
Lol dude I get this shit all the time on PC
---
Best feeling in the world
---
That console aim though. It sucks cause that was just them running into your bullets and not your aim.
---
Idk if ubi...confirmed his race? But he looks far from black
---
You’re really good 🤘😄😍❤️.......👌👈
---
Thanks?
---
That is very unfortunate
---
I haven't been DDOSED once this whole season. I don't know whether that's plain luck or what but apparently it's a huge problem right now.

How long did that take?

K lets fuck

Yeah but did you use *a fucking pencil? *
---
SAU’s comics depict him as black
---
well don't know about your platform but the only people left on xbox are adderall popping future-school-shooters so this sounds about right
---
Fs thanks
---
Well siege was designed to be a competitive game, and ranked is meant to emulate pro play. Thats the whole point of it.
---
I usually play support but we had a bad start this game so. I went fragging the whole game
---
Yeah I play unranked a lot and I’ve never been ddossed
---
You and your buddy are reposters.
---
Yeah and Chowder, cool man
---
It depends on how you did last season
---
Yeah but did you use *a fucking pencil* ?
---
55% of reddit posts on reddit are reposts get over yourself
---
Impeccable timing
---
Tbh Nothing is more discouraging when you're last alive than a team trying to kick you instead of helping
---
I definitely can see that as being a plus, but out of curiosity. What mouse do you own?
---
Dude I was playing unranked and I put in a door way Simone broke a hatch and I had defused down and they ran in and they fell down the hatch and they didn’t have enough time to get back
---
nice

---
I dont think there is one tbh. Complainers gonna complain. Others cant see your level in game in ranked so just go for it when it unlocks.
---
If you're dealing with this kind of jager, then go rook and don't put armor down unless he puts his gadgets down. Or turn the team against him. Make those gadgets seem very important.
---
Are ya ready kidssss oooooo
---
Nice.
---
I made it to plat 3 last season for the first time, had my Elo rolled back twice due to closet cheaters feelsbadman.

I miss playing old Blitz but i reaaaally dont miss palying AGAINST old BLitz. Old Meme of "Blitz wins 1v1s" is long dead :(
---
I will never understand why people still actually use the laser sight unless they're either brand new to the game or use it on shotguns. I personally use one only on the Supernova just so I can make it usable.
---
Sledge and Rook were my first 2 ACOGs. They were very easy to get used to.
---
Frieght train BLitz was a scary scary time
---
Yeah, on console you could just game share with the new account and use the account as a smurf, on pc you can't do that, the only time you'll see smurfs are free weekends
---
Yeah sorry i tried to edit it out, but i used ps4 to trim it and so it made it's way in lol
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
Ah yes Nice
---
You should friend them.
---
Literally everyone
---
Ok chill lmao.
---
It’s better when you do it with a different opp cos it plays the breaking animation so you end up pistol-whipping them in the face
---
for saying that, let a man be happy

My teammates do this all the time. It’s honestly annoying

Level 99 and not got one yet (PC)
---
It’s the internet. 
---
If someone saying something is corny makes you unhappy, you’ve got some things to reevaluate.
---
Im sorry that had to happen to you man
---
Hacking, almost everyone is doing it
---
IT HAS SKINZ?!!!!
---
PS: sorry for any grammatical errors english is not my first language.
---
Have you heard of the 9mm barbed wire yet?
---
i think you should reevaluate your attitude 😂imagine being that much of a bitch
---
Honestly it sucks when this shit happens at higher ranks
---
I feel your pain
---
level 104 and haven't got one yet (PC)
---
Ikr, i swear the idiots die early and just start kicking those alive, like why? They literally carrying your bitchasses
---
30-35 as I remember. Now I'm 93 and still got only that Black Ice for FMG-9 (I don't like this weapon btw)
---
Level 15 Pistol Black Ice lol
---
Right now i am Level 180 or so and got a lot.
---
For calling something corny?..
---
Uh, you sure you aren’t taking this too seriously??
---
oh i’m just having fun cutie pie
---
If you say so
---
I feel the way my luck is my first will be on a pistol
---
well i think i’m the one that typed it at least
---
Damn looks like you are in for the long haul
---
What did this have to do with the fact that you are amaru? You can do double kill with any guns
---
John wick isn’t dead yet
---
It happens alot when you holding an angle and right when younshoot the enemy your teammate pops out trynna steal the kill or something and dies
---
Goyo’s shield are honestly more of a hazard for the defenders than the attackers
---
Ok..
---
One day I had a clutch 1vs5 while talking to my mum. My friends were very confused.
---
People need to chill in these comments
---
Lvl 4, first alpha pack ever. I was so surprised
---
You got casual sweet
---
Talk about getting the luck early on
---
lvl 125 and have like 5 or something
---
Nah there’s really not a big difference in plat 3 and gold 1.
---
Thats some luck right there! Any chance you have the lottery numbers
---
My first ever alpha pack was black ice for the smg11.
---
Jeeez quite a wait for your first
---
That’s just me every night, traveling to the moon
---
That luck though
---
22 lol
---
I think everyone would have it then cuz there's no drawbacks
---
No ubisoft are to blame because it's their mistake
---
Not jealous of you....
---
Your English is perfect bro.
---
True, but I'd sill like to see an extra 15 seconds on the prep phase
---
same thing happened to me after i got 2 aces in a row
---
People complain about runouts on skyscraper but little do they know theres way more broken runouts on fortress then skyscraper
---
Thx xD
---
Nice one
---
Figures he’d deny it lol but I wonder why he deleted the post? Some coincidence lol
---
Do you actually unironically believe Kafe or Kanal are worse than before?
---
Lit af
---
Hi Im buck and im here to fuck
---
Honestly, are you surprised?
---
Well maybe not whenever possible. I’d still say that smokes are better on Glaz and arguably Dokkaebi.
---
I hope no one was stupid enough to hand that dumb bitch a ball of explosive shrapnel
---
Big brain plays
---
I mean if one just stuck the defuse they woulda won
---
DPI 1000 with maybe 11/12 sens. I am comfortable with it. All I faced the sync issue.
---
But where was the pencil?
---
&gt;DPI 1000 with maybe 11/12 sens.
---
I ain’t crying you’re crying
---
Maybe some new operator will get it in the future
---
I’m like 90% sure that’s from a clown fetish video on YouTube. I know that because kritical did a video on it.

Hello R6ogplayer21, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d5tky4/r6_glaciar_skins_in_actual_weapons_plssss/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Hopefully
---
Its not a bug. They said they added Year 2 stuff into the alpha pack pool.
---
Move along now, nothing to see here!
---
I agree! Which is why Monte was their weakness I believe. They just got too nervous around Monty.
---
Nutty

Same except I was more comfortable with the reflex sight than the holo.

Headshotting bombers with BOSG kills them in two shot.

Ya happens to me too I could be typing and will completely freeze and can’t alt f4 or tab or use task so I have to go to the bottom right and restart my pc.

I couldn't care less.

You're trying to generate fake shit just for clout to compensate for what ever you're missing in life. 
---
🤪🤪 Keep spreading that fake bullshit though 😱 someone may eventually believe it and you'll get the clout you always wanted 😘😳😝😝😝
---
If I were you, I would try 70 horizontal sensitivity and 37 vertical and 38 ADS sensitivity.  It will be uncomfortable and wierd at first but once you get used to it it will make you alot better trust me. Just practice snapping to angles instead of walking around with ads
---
Exp lvl doesnt count.. skill counts. There are lvl 60s which do better than lvl 200 players. 
---
Just educate yourself and learn all the ranked maps, learn how each room is called and how the operators are named, learn to give callouts and everything should be fine!
---
Stop?
---
Dude, I remember a while ago when me and my friends were fucking around with fbi shield recruit on favella once and we were hip-firing at random stuff and somehow I got a wall-bang hip-fire headshot, but I forgot to clip it and It made me very angry and sad
---
Yes this too makes me sad :(

The support staff thats looking into the reports.

Keep in mind that majority of online gaming services dont look at every single report that comes in. Most of the systems only pass on the account for manual review if the account has multiple reports under it.
---
As someone in Plat on PC, it's not really hard to get into. I've seen more variety in skill in Plat than any other rank, it's weird.

Pro fuze

Everyone loves these but I think I hate the charms so much that ain’t won’t even try to push to champion this season, charms were the only thing I cared about.
---
i’ve also been experiencing it since ember rise, do you use AMD?
---
Meta
---
My expactations were high and i was not dissapointed
---
Late reply. My bad.
---
So essentially, at the end of the day, the tip matters rather than the blade curve?
---
Happend to a player on my team yesterday, not ddosing the whole server but specific players. Never had problems before that, but it seems like people are starting to do it on PC now aswell.
---
Wasn't lone wolf available offline? I could've sworn I played Thunt and Situations offline
---
Cause the first year and a half people didnt really know how the to really play the game. 
---
Hell 5 man rushing the spawn was a real thing that happened on Pro. People just stayed in the obj room with maybe one other person running around lost. 
---
With establish meta these days, people know what to do, new operators and map knowledge maps like house, favela, plane and bartlett are extremely unbalanced.
---
Was going to say that it was a cool clip but not to crazy then saw that it was a controller now I am impressed
---
It’s a clean skin
---
the game has started to crash hella lot
---
A great legendary for a less than mediocre gun.
---
I uninstalled it at this point, They can’t fix it soon enough. DDoSing is actually a crime but since the “Console Community is small” they won’t take legal action 😐
---
Add it back to casual. That we have ranked I see no reason why all the maps aren’t in casual
---
Season Ember Rise K/D is 0.91  according to R6 tracker
---
Can we please stop having this exact same screenshot posted every 20 fucking minutes?
---
I agree with this
---
Just know you were ddosed by someone who has to cheat their way to victory because they’re so bad.
---
A yes, we're meant to tweet them about \[REDACTED\] cheating his way to number one, right? Because why wouldn't we want to know who to actually report?
---
Yeah what’s the go with all the dead people in your team trying to kick because you died? It’s a very strange logic lol
---
They aren’t the same some vary slightly also we need more bandit mains keep it going
---
From what I hear this system will be a great improvement but even in this system a team of bronze 3s can play against a team of gold 2, and a team of silver 3 could play against a team of diamond 3
---
Now I have heard alot about the skill and experience difference between golds and plats so the difference between silvers and plats must be massive, yet they can still matched against each other.
---
In an ideal world there should be a 600 mmr limit to matchmaking but they will probably have player number issues coming in with that small a grouping.
---
Ubisoft support will tell the mods of subreddit to change your flair

I experience it mostly on acogs and i have Nvidia graphics
---
Console probably. Controls are kinda bad
---
Defuzzler
---
As in being kicked for team kill? You won't be kicked if it's your first TK that game. And if you have reverse friendly fire from a previous TK... you'll just kinda die. Won't be kicked by the game though.
---
Same. Played season 1 on console
---
Tbh I don’t think Ubisoft could do much to prevent this. It would really be on Microsoft’s end. These people use adapters that connect to consoles and bypasses the console and act like it’s a controller. Most of those adapters even come with macros and turbos.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. After a while he starts to feel like a one trick pony
---
Ahhhh a fellow shredda

On Xbox it seems to be the case. Sat here searching just hit the 10 minute mark

After patch only, u?
---
&gt; He literally said that you don't get the others.
---
Which has what to do with me saying they have different functions/downsides?
---
&gt;Those would be its downsides.
---
The player forgetting to do something is not a downside.
---
Ggs
---
I don't see the point of this game mode tbh. If I want to play long, sweaty matches, I play ranked. If I want to goof around and have a laugh, I play casual, which gives me access to more maps too.
---
If the unranked map pool had all of them it'd be more attractive.
---
This still happens but if game is on the match point (2-0, 2-1 or 2-2) no more backfill or no more vote kick happens. I lost tons of matches after 2-0 to 3-2 because of no backfill.
---
[here](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/8Dl5h)
---
sorry for late response
---
In that you're talking about an entirely different thing.
---
&gt;Your issue with the laser is that you think that a pregame choice should have potential negative consequences.
---
I think there should be tradeoffs. Don't try to paint me as saying something I've not.
---
What about them?
---
Yeah I get that it's also xbox's problem, I just don't understand how UBI can't have some sort of detection of sensitivity at least, these guys can literally move faster than the console sensitivity cap on console. I really hope they can think of something, at this point the ranked aspect of the game is dying because of it!
---
They can only do one thing. Allow M&amp;K then split the players.
---
I wonder if M&amp;K users will still cheat the system to play with controllers?
---
If there would be any consequenzes they would not do it. But these guys are "Look here im cheating and tell you what, you cant do anyhting against it and ubisoft would neither"
---
They Know that the will not be punished...
---
Literally 5sec queues (ps4)
---
Do you have a source?
---
Personnly I don't want to solo ranked. Whereas I do want the ranked rules. If I want to improve my solo play while not having to worry about dropping away my rank and thus possibly not being able to play with friends as a consequence. Casual is just quitters and people messing about  which is fine but not what I want to do right now.
---
Guess it's just Xbox then?
---
&gt; There's no downside to using a grip or a muzzle attachment
---
Except there's a very definite choice regarding what attachment you're using emphasising a style. So yeah, there is.
---
I guess so
---
Need to be added in ranked after somoene quit early surrender button to not lose elo
---
Yeah fully agree with you. It’s like if you like playing k&amp;m why don’t you just play on pc ? Most of them just can’t compete on pc and trying to smurf through consoles like no life’s.
---
Well, Mr.Wick is not dead yet.
---
Hmm, alright, for solo queue it makes sense. Didn't think of that, I never play solo.
---
and the amount of cheaters is too high. I play pc and ps4 and it is crazy... ps4 eu DDOS everywhere pc cheaters in every second or third game.
---
1) It's to prevent goyo from just placing shields near hostage and baiting the enemy team into shooting them accidentally to lose.   
---
2) Who plays hostage

Hello HermeticHePe, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d5ux3u/high_ping_gave_lesion_a_new_gun/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
yes
---
it relies on if you're playing on console or not, if youre on PC I doubt you'll get ddosed, but on console Its like every game in the higher ranks.
---
controlling recoil patterns are 10x easier on PC, it's a know fact. this is why PC and console aren't cross compatible is ranked situations.
---
This is a reference to the Polish Hussars
---
So not like in counterstrike? That suck’s
---
Would completely undermine the reason it was introduced to make it ignore stacks
---
And if you do all 10 placements together do you land in the same ranks?
---
No as in it's a federal crime 
---
In the US there's States Laws and Federal Laws
---
It's the difference between laws that vary state by state such as the age at which you can get a drivers liscence and laws made by the Federal or larger National government.
---
DDOS in the us is considered a Federal Crime meaning punishments for doing it are much much harsher and there's much less leniency towards minors who commit said crimes 
---
Such as if little Timmy was made he was losing and started DDOSing
---
The Fed Gov would charge him and yet while he's a minor hey may get tried as an adult depending on his actual age and or his immidiate family in the same household may also get put on the hook
---
As well him and his family would likely also hey Sued by his personal ISP
---
Small tip, turn down your sensitivity. It is clearly too high which results in you struggling with easy kills like the finka and the twitch here.
---
Yea i mean  it does get rid of all the boosters
---
I know what federal crimes are.
---
I was asking if you really meant the postal service by USPS.
---
Not to mention, only country in the world.
---
Oh I see now that was a typo it was meant to be blacklisted by ISPs

Learning the maps was the first big hurdle. Once I got past that everything else was more manageable. Operators weren't a big problem since I could just focus on a few. Then I learned strats and used terrorist hunt to improve aim.

I don't understand how stupid casual players are

why are you so impatient???

I'm hoping this picks up momentum.  It would be nice to see any improvement on the current system.

Ditto. I was playing a game last round I got 3 kills with cav. It was 3 vs 2 and my game froze. I had to restart the comp and just right now after opening the game it froze again.  Wtf. Also I'm having high ping at times after the recent update even though I used to get 60-70 ping and I have a 100 mbps connection that's working fine.   
---
I've seen a lot of other guys complaining about game freezing during matches but experienced it twice right now after a long time.

Ok I’ll retry because no one really likes it :/

Thank you, it took all of my brain cells to come up with it.

Honestly for bandit I prefer iron sights.

no more Gold IV? o.o

They can't really do anything about it.

That was a cav, fool

This how we know that you’re new to playing her, you’re running the smg over the shotgun

Use her shotgun, you’ll see why she doesn’t need a buff.

Also, in insurgency, your gun will still have that 1 bullet in chamber...

And if you do full empty reload and sprint slightly too early, you'll have full magazine, but empty chamber, learned that the hard way =D

Ps. I miss the double tap reload from insurgency...

why people downvote every Ela Buff discussion?

Couldn't be more wrong. They might not be replying to every little bitch crying about it, they're obviously still taking it seriously. Lost players means lost sales of future cosmetics. You just can't do anything about a DDoS, even if you find and banned the people doing it, there's a million more accounts to use and do the same thing. I'm certain there working on some kind of solution, but it would obviously take time. It could be prosecuting people doing paid services to scare people from doing it. Or coming up with a way to kick the person crashing the server, there's no way they're simply ignoring the issue
---
I get that, it feels like it only works in some situations but if you played with her when she first came out you’ll know why it’s like that now. That thing and miras vector when they first came out were the equivalent of an a10 cannon.
---
I read this as doosing
---
Hermetic weapon!
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
I have that same problem and it kills the game for me, it doesn’t matter how well I play I feel like the opponent always has the upper hand.
---
How did hibanna not see you
---
I see where you're coming from. Fair point but is there not a way for ubi or the game to tell the difference between being inactive/lagging out/leaving?
---
For console the way it works is you click the button and that’s it....nothing happens. Ever

Finally after the year I had this in my saves, I finally found him

Did you know that on Skyscraper in the Karaoke room you can find a game cartridge with Rainbow Six Siege on. Meaning you can play r6s inside r6s...

could of very easily just heard him

team mate might of called him out
---
all the other guys ran out like blind chickens so it's fair to assume he expected the last one too
---
Yeah same here

Every time my friends and I are DDOSd this is the exact message I get back and it’s so frustrating

He could see her before he shot

You never used to get banned if you lagged out, but people started abusing this and would unplug their routers when they began to lose, basically self dosing, so they removed that feature.
---
What's a thirst? I'm too old, I don't know what it means. I'm guessing he meant you shouldn't rush people just because they are solo.
---
We had someone post on here an image of a team of silvers vs a team of plats.
---
? Please, slow down the clip and you will see that Ubi actually has pretty decent hit reg. First one is wide, second is on him but on his backpack which is NOT part of the hitbox, so a miss. Third is below his face/under his armpit. Again a miss. 
---
I downloaded your vid and put 0.125 speed on. They all missed.
---
That was the  worst best high kill round I've ever seen
---
Well... Americans are known to copy names from other characters that isn't from America, that's their thing.  But look,  Nøkk has a flag on her shoulder,   u can't really see what type of flag it is..  is it a Danish flag? Iceland flag? Finish flag? Swedish flag?  or maybe... Norwegian flag!?   we will never know until we get an answer from ubisoft, until now this will stay as a myth and no one will ever know truly where she's from,  this is just a theory ,  but maybe in the future ubisoft will give us more "background" story from her.
---
Well i think it doesnt matter if you get them a week eralier on t-hunt or custom games.. just go into them in your favourite mode when they got released. 
---
If you want to know them before release.. download the TTS and play them there.
---
I think it’s today.
---
No padels

From my understanding the only way to get ddos on xbox is to have the enemy team in your party. They can get your ip address that way. If you get disconnected from a game but your internet is still working you didnt get ddos. If you completely lose internet and need to restart the modem you've been ddos
---
How

Me: r6 trying to get me to buy things I want.
---
My wallet: nope

right i answered your question for you and that's what you take from it? who hurt you?

That’s not a legendary skin , that’s a rare with legendary slapped onto it, cause it’s absolute shit
---
Lol new to reddit they have no idea what they are doing
---
whilst being DDOS'ed even. But what did you want to show with this clip?
---
There is a 3 piece set unfortunately but the proleague uniform goes perfectly with it
---
That was great haha
---
That bad boi shoulda been yeeted down the hallway... But I have definitely did this in game...
---
Fallout 4 bullshit if you excuse me, those kind of  weapons were very rare in new vegas...... *except for the 10 mm pistol but they are an exception.......wait what am I saying? Fallout new vegas is the same game that had a dig brain chain gun and a shoulder mounted minigun and then there are the fatmans.....just forget I said anything.
---
It should be today. I'm hoping they'll be up in a couple hours.
---
Leaning with out aiming
---
Thanks for the complete answer :)
---
Seems like R6 is more fun now than ever
---
What map / spot is this? I don't recognise it :/
---
I experience it more like this: Teamates: " he is left, directly to your left! Behind the wall left to you!" The guy in your team which spend the first 2 minutes in a corner on the other side of the map facing the last alive enemy with 5 hp: peeks to the right side
---
Should be today, new operators are exclusive to year pass holders for a week after release.
---
Toxic and not even a good play or anything like that. No need to Tbag after downing someone with the highest damage pistol in the game
---
ah nice thanks :)
---
thank you :)
---
i agree with you, he needs a heavy buff
---
should be out in 1 hour and 15 minutes
---
Bro this is amazing, i didnt know you guys can play up there. How is the view? Do you like it there? Pls tell me more
---
He was blackbeard so everything is fine
---
Yeah that's the title, but what am I looking at, is this a bug due to the DDOS. just something buck can do with his shotty?
---
Just play with a bad internet connection like me and you'll never know if it's DDOS or your router
---
 if you look at the top right there's all the server errors.  its  probably just because of that and not actually possible under normal  circumstances. Post a video from a custom game or thunt.
---
Damn that’s actually quite impressive that you managed hear them on villa! VILLA!
---
Before Nøkk was released there were a lot of hints for the next operator to be danish in trailers and such. So i think she is danish.
---
It's great ! I can see an amazing view up here, including the doc who is about to blast my head off 5 seconds into Chalet !
---
You might be tight but i think all the nordic countries have nøkk or something similar coz im from sweden and we have nöck
---
I know that goyo is like smoke but the attackers are able to basically force his hand to killing the hostage even if he placed his shields too close by accident. Also I know that removing hostage damage from goyo’s shield is a bad idea and can be abused but they should at least have it so the correct person gets blamed for shooting his shield and killing the hostage.
---
VICTORIA AUT MORTE!
---
I unironically use the AA-12 on alibi
---
I only played casual until unranked came out, now I just play unranked.
---
It's funny because in unranked I rarely see high agresive players like in casual (for example that vigil who spawnpeeks and proceeds to runout for the rest of the round)
---
Best thing they added imo
---
Okay. Thanks. I knew they come out a week after. Normally its tuesdays but for some reason they didnt come out for me yesterday.. been waiting haha. Thanks though appreciate it!
---
O-oh
---
I actually had a similar problem with the same type and brand of adapter a while back. It ended up fixing itself when I got a new router that was also tp-link. I know that’s not always possible, but it might help.
---
This doesn't even look like DDOSing. Looks like shit internet.
---
Oh
---
My buddy and I were ddossed in a unranked match. In a 2v4. We were the 2.
---
In the TTS, people sacrificed themselves to bait the enemy into burning the hostage. Ubi decided to make all Volcan shield hostage dmg to count to Goyo, and attackers abuse the shield to accuse Goyo TK the hostage.
---
Oof?
---
Nah this is it
---
It might be that everything around the scope is also zoomed, which is not how scopes really work.
---
173 wasn't from one game
---
Haha yes. They wil think that i was hacking if i would do that xDD
---
Feels incomplete without the Unicorn headgear but it still is a nice contrast. Btw that Monty is too clean! Blood Orchid Uni?
---
On casual? Yes
---
On unranked? Hell no.
---
Exactly lmao but if the Clash is good and there's enemies near hear it's a bit hard but it's nothing you can't deal with, just how you deal with Monty
---
Amaru has entered the game
---
My guy, how high us your brightness?
---
How the fuck is this their fault? In valley you just spawn and run right and they can't hit you.
---
The IQ is literally just shooting because she got killed there like once and now has to assume any operator can instantly run 15 meters in one second.
---
Probably because the season dropped in wendsday and not Tuesday

The problem used to be that the red dot had a thicker outside and thus took up more of the screen, blocking a large field of vision. They've changed it within the last year so that it doesn't take up as much space anymore. It's probably on par with the other 1x sights now tbh, but people still like to act like it's the meme sight. I vastly prefer the red dot to the other two, although sometimes I do enjoy using the Holo. I also prefer the red dot to the ACOG on Buck's rifle but that's preference
---
If you lost against a cheater you would get MMR back, but the value you see here is the combined result of all cheater encounters, you won against a bunch of them it seems.
---
My friend died to a Warden, I thought it was a Valkyrie, so my dumbass threw all 3 of my flashbangs at him, without him telling ME IT WAS A FUCKING WARDEN

PC right? This isn’t console...

now that’s a lot of damage

Looks like a bunch of rats/mouse traps

Shit-tier damage, thats it, but luckily, the ROF is high enough to hit headshots for me
---
The music
---
Happy cake day? Hopeyou have a great day!
---
Gg, you won against cheaters. How dare you.
---
Wait, I can’t tell if you’re joking or not
---
Underrated comment of the day
---
Someotimes when i play COD:BO4 i can see people through things. It's a glitch
---
Ah. Yeah, I'm retarded I didn't even notice there was music nice ace man
---
Ah okay. I could've sworn it dropped on tuesday. But im wrong haha. I understand now. Thanks haha
---
I stopped Rainbow for now. I got in my Placements Matches 4 Times in a row ddos to lose . After i reached Platinum 2 i got again Like 3+ time in a row ddos. I dont Play this shit until IT get fixed
---
But you can't even see if he activated it in this case... :/
---
You're saying we should punish people for having bad connection. I disagree. Not sure why that's so difficult to accept lol
---
Yea
---
Yes, they added a few of them.
---
I think the ones added are the pretty old ones like the uniforms that isn't part of a bundle.

Hello TomTomson458, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d5y0tj/this_is_not_a_call_to_action_but_a_possible/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Yuck. Dropshotting is for virgins.
---
Be patient,  There is usually somewhere where you can get an angle on him if it's a 1v1, if you have one or more teammates, you are one of your teammates watch him, he can't do anything when he has his shield extended. If it's only you and are against one or more enemies, you're kinda fucked if the enemy team does not mess up. But most of the time they will get thirsty for the kill, just make sure not to focus on monty, but don't ignore him.
---
What a retarded little kid who ran in front of you
---
We get it, you Smurf.
---
That C4 was so fucking satisfying
---
The trick is to kill the enemies before they enter. Just run out shortly after they rappel
---
God, I miss the HUD, I want Ubisoft to add an option to be able to select a HUD you want, cause I miss the Chimera one so fucking much
---
In that case op I am sorry for calling your post a bullshit post. I apologize and I shall delete my post
---
If it was DDOSing or server stressing, pings would be WAYYYY higher. Look at the pings. They all seem normal except his own.
---
Same here, never have I felt so powerful but so weak in a competitive fps before. You can be killed in a seconf from so many different angles and directions but if you play your cards right it's entirely possible to go full rambo-mode and take em all out. It's so good.
---
This is obviously PC.
---
It's because his father doesn't love him.
---
Great shot
---
Pro gamer move
---
So the Game ist dying now if Nobody can so Something a to Bad .
---
Well thanks for the downvote dude, coulda simply answered the question. Jeysus...
---
maybe, i've been dealing with this ever since phantom sight
---
Same on PS4, it a well known way to get around paying for ps plus as well.
---
It's not *literally* impossible, no. Hyperbole is a thing though.
---
You must have won against some other cheaters
---
Do you just draw what you want? How long does it take?
---
Why are you trying to ban Mira? You cuck.
---
I didn’t downvote tho.
---
????????
---
I looked at it again. His ping is normal and so is the teammates pings. This is probably Ubi server lag, not a DDOS attack. Any Server Stressing or DDOS attach would make everyones pings go above 1000
---
Could also be the map?... This is purely anecdotal but I was trying to walk through a breached wall on the top floor of Kanal and it kept rubberbanding me. I eventually had to walk around the long way and it worked
---

---
But we all get kicked? 7 games I  a row were 1000+ pings
---
The red dot says it all
---
&gt;You're saying we should punish people for having bad connection.
---
If they continually choose to play the game and fuck with nine other people, fuck yes.
---
&gt;Not sure why that's so difficult to accept lol
---
You've not put forward any reason to agree.
---
its not enough meme unless you use the shotty pistol
---
The garage on Oregon is not their spawn. The lines of sight from that garage is blocked from cars. Be more aware. What rank are you?
---
This isn’t exactly true for defense if aggressive just means roaming- I mean like 3 guys holding down bombs while 2 really good players annoy the shit out of the attackers
---
Marley? Is that you?
---
Every body in the comments saying stuff like “well done” and “wow you’re really good!” But in console this will happen and everyone will call the opponent console bots that are oblivious to everything and say you won that only because of that.
---
Y’all really don’t know about recording software huh?
---
Well I prefer so go fuck yourself
---
Oh well I was going based off the video evidence where the pings were normal. I have had that happen once in a while and it goes away because it was the rare Ubi server lag. Now that I see your pic it is 100% DDOS in those matches. In the kanal one I do not know for sure.
---
I think Amaru is fine and buffing her will only cause problems. She has a good gun (sure IQ has better gadget and 3 speed with same gun) but Amarus gadget can be really good in some situations.
---
Warden on the other hand has complete dogshit guns and is a one speed. He’s like tachanka level shit. He’ll tachankas ability is probably better. He either needs 2 speed, acog on MPX, or a better gun
---
now
---
You know you can play old Hereford right? (first scenario) The interesting thing is that the kafe scenario is on the reworked kafe.
---
I entirely agree with you, I personally haven’t expirenced this in a ranked, I did in a casual though. I also had last season. But yes a simple ban is too nice, I think at least a perma ban.
---
this one is particularly annoying
---
It has become so insanely easy that literally everyone is doing it. It is almost like they have no security up to defend against this. I just hope that some one takes action soon against it either preventative measures or legal action because this is nuts. Others games can have things in place for against it yet we dont
---
(unpopular opinion) Asc and keratos is the best mashup in the game
---
It could be. I personally have played kanal atleast 10 times since the new season (love the map btw), and no rubberbanding or other issues other than DDOS.
---
Nah actually i'm playing on Mars
---
On pc close game and launcher and reopen everything 
---
On console turn your console off and after that on
---
Unless you're a confident black beard main, in which case you use it to bait people
---
Haven’t gotten booted and I play at a mid plat level. 50+ games played this season. Even if it’s an issue, just hope they boot the entire server. Or hope to get on defense first. Not something UBI can fix super easily.
---
No, I have a great computer but I messed up the video while exporting the video. I only spent a 1 or 2 minutes on it anyways
---
Me too buddy, me too.
---
Mans over here doing the lords work. Great job
---
Kafe is more interesting now in my opinion. One truly f-ed up map is Hereford in a way that there are so many ways of spawn peeking. I don't know about kanal as I haven't played on it yet.
---
Figure that out on your own?
---
Unless you play in bronze than yea it happens basically every round
---
Besides, I find its easier to not push garage anyways. Hatch or cellar normally arent reinforced as much, so its easier to push.
---
Cant unlock them now? it has been a week so...
---
Victorus Aut Mortis!
---
They were bots lol
---
Me when i see only one guy on the enemy team Conflictedsteveharvey.Jpeg
---
buff the scorpion's damage or recoil, and slightly nerf the FO-12. keep the gadget the same
---
no we need to stop talking about it ubisoft has addressed that it is an issue that is being worked on
---
I have Uplay plus and been playing with the new ops.
---
They fell like dominos
---
Goyo is repelling and Amaru is playing with fire? Ok.
---
I had a contest with my friend a few months ago to decide who’s better. He ran ela while I ran alibi and we tried to see who would have the most after two matches. I won because nobody ever expects alibi shotty
---
Echo be like:  What are those
---
 
---
Dead memes Oof
---
I believe one of our guys DDOSed because my friend hit message stop or I'll shut down lobby after that round we got disconnected
---
talk to support
---
Goyo is definitely the more practical of the two. Amaru is very situational.
---
They already make it so if you got kicked out of a game or the entire server shuts down; you don’t lose elo. It’s not something they can fix easily. People need to realize it. Just suck it up. I’ve played 50+ games this season on a mid plat level and got booted once. Just find certain times that little kids aren’t on as much.
---
I used to draw the different floors of maps very often in school xD i got pretty precise after a few ones ;P (like with hatches, furniture, doors, windows, etc.)
---
Do different regions get access at different time? Because I just checked and they're not available (EU btw).
---
Hey it’s me, your dad.  
---
I’m ploud of you
---
&gt;Gives my team the best chance of winning the first 3 rounds 
---
That is the most broken ideology in siege that many believe in.
---
There's absolutely no guarantee they can't win 3 straight after win you because they'll have the exact same advantage as you did. You can't just squeeze an extra round when they stand a good chance of rolling over you for 3 straight.
---
You ban that which can handicap them for the entire game. Clearly, your teammates know what they were doing banning thatcher.
---
My I think 4th alpha pack around level 15 was black ice for russian sub-ak (Tachanka and Kapkan). Now I have it in Thatcher's weapon, IQs LMG (right after I got it I got an ace with it), MP5 and French shotgun
---
Nice drawings
---
What server?

Yeah, well, some people are stupid. At least you got Cav to make it worth it.

They have never worked for me even tho I am linked

I'm pretty sure jagged edges get fixed through increasing anti-aliasing? But most people suggest leaving that off anyways so do what you want

Neither they both suck ass
---
this is so bad it's almost good. almost 
---
this is gonna cause a lot of people to die tho since the mohawk think will give away your position more easily
---
I played 16 games straight against DDOSers 2 days ago. It’s so bad right now.
---
A little tip. If you make an account or change your name to adding “BootServers” in your name, and you leave during ban phase (looks like your pulling IP) if the enemy team has a booter, from my testing they hit the server off 100% of the time. It’s actually pretty hilarious
---
Just don’t solo queue? It’s better to have a full team with mics and communication than 1-2 people on your team talking then a 7 year old coming in at 1-3 saying you suck.
---
Sorry bro didn’t see the first kill so must’ve been a 4K still nice tho, but don’t try and say it’s an ace if you can’t show all five kills for proof
---
Can't deny this point
---
Shut the hell up
---
Not to shitpost but I really hate how everyone’s lucky enough to get some shitty ass opponents in video games. Not just Siege. Everyone clips an ACE and the whole time it’ll be players who literally just suck at a game.
---
Why TF did your team leave
---
haha funny purple glove man joke
---
I play at gold-plat but go off
---
He’s trash
---
I never understand why people just feed  when the other team is down

If they’re not using their utility, then they are bad. You shouldn’t have this issue unless you’re at a silver or lower level.
---
Diamond skin on mine. It looks like Dr Dre robbed Liberace

Than you are either the luckiest person alive or your enemies are actually retarded.
---
Big rip but still nice done bro
---
That mf drone be wildin
---
it's good but the sights are trash
---
OK, I restarted the game just now and they appeared. Talk about perfect timing.
---
The ammount of DDOS complaints under that tweet though, geez...
---
If it kills them them in one shot it's a one tap regardless if I missed the first couple shots
---
You may have played against/with cheaters and didn't notice them. Ubi will just delete the game as if it never existed. Ubi may even delete all the games that the cheaters played on without checking if he has cheated on that particular game or not, just to be sure.
---
They see him rollin'
---
He would be better if his gaget dint had to be used standing still
---
Or more commonly from the same angle, as soon as you look away, even just to a different part of the screen
---
They're available now
---
Vertical sound travel is fucked up, which is quite noticable near stairs. And sometimes it feels like someone is walking over me, meanwhile the enemy is somewhere else.
---
You only need 3-4 lol
---
um why
---
Not a big deal on casual
---
Again, find a time where booters arent present as much. Late at night or early in the morning.

I’m torn between the C75 and the SMG-12 because the SMG-12 melts people at close range, but the recoil bro. My main problems with the C75 are the muzzle flash, the iron sights, and the smaller mag capacity. I just can’t decide
---
Trust me I know, but it’s good for cutting off the common rotation from B bomb into Laundry Storage. It’s nice to have two hard breachers to open meeting hatches and laundry hatch a well. 
---
Say the defending team has a Kaid and a Mute. You’re kind of stuck if you don’t have a Maverick or a Twitch 
---
My point is just simply don’t ban useful attack operators when you’re attacking first and same goes for defending
---
It was only for the first 2 rounds (while they were defusing) so I thought that first but after that it stopped
---
Comando is ass aug gang
---
Okay thanks

Yes, when I’m defending I will 90% of the time ban Thatcher but never on attack. Okay so tell me you you’re going to use Fuze to attack Oregon basement. Floor above laundry isn’t destructible

An old friend that's no longer a friend of mine said how awful I am so I made a dedicated solo queue account and got plat 2 first season on it. He boosts and cant even get above gold 2. The kd was 1.7 while his was 0.8. Felt good to prove him wrong.
---
What res is this?
---
I wish they would do it every 2 rounds at the least. 3 is annoying and defenders usually have the upper edge on most maps.
---
There’s no trade off just less recoil
---
I know, that still doesnt make the ACS12 dmg and killing power not underpowered.
---
Ok. Next.
---
It’s common to see that wall get destroyed in high ranked games that’s why I’m emphasising the point on keeping him. 
---
When it comes to Maverick I’ve noticed a lot of people aren’t comfortable using him or simply don’t know how to, the amount of people I’ve watched struggle to open a hatch is astounding

Agreed
---
I was poking fun there lol obviously Fuze isn’t as versatile as thatcher, but as for the attack defend mentality I ban him either way, cause say we start attack but do really poorly right? Come out at the switch 1-2 well now we have to win the 3 defense straight to avoid overtime. As for laundry on Oregon tho if thatcher is banned I go for meeting hatches and my squad attacks from blue tunnel back stairs and meeting hatches
---
So why is it such a widespread issue on R6? There is an insane amount of people who DDOS on R6 console.
---
I haven’t checked today lol
---
Finka. Under picked with decent primaries and a good secondary. The LMG is great cuz it's an LMG, what more could you want. The Spear could be better in terms of damage output bit it's not the worst. And she gets the SASG, which is great for boosting and rushing objectives. Her ability is super useful too.
---
Use her for the memes with the suppressed ~~air~~ shotgun.

he doesnt - you are plat if you reach at least 3200MMR he only has 3199MMR so he didnt make it yet.
---
U heard me
---
Yeah, floorplans can help with map knowledge
---
Yeh her ability is very useful
---
Lesion. Even if someone shoots a mine, you can tell where they are coming from. If you play him right, he’s a top 3 defender without a doubt.
---
Don't waste your time man, it's pointless. Ubi won't ban ddosers

oh you're right, didn't remember the thread title properly

And to a certain extent you don’t have to worry about boosting

Droning in casual tut tut tut

Also Fuze talking like American soldier not Russian one. "Sir" instead of "commander", "comrade" or by military rank.

Dokkaibei because of her sniper for long range kills and I normally switch between the SMG pistols for shorter range kills. Hacking the cams is also extremely fun because when the enemy has valkyrie cams it is really fun to troll objectives. Plus with the frag grenades I've had some fun kills with calling phones and tossing a cooked grenade in and getting the sweet notification that I got someone.
---
me and yung.regret were stacked into that game i was yung.gleam thanks for the carry you were nuts
---
I get this reasoning, but dammit I want to get ranked too. Just because I’m a shitty player means I can’t get ranked? I don’t feel bad for top ranked players that yell at other people for being bad.  At the end of the day, it’s just a game.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be - grimace
---
Yeh she is quite fun
---
There are actual hacks that let you shoot through bulletproof surfaces, and see through them (obviously). Sometimes i wonder how they're programming to let these sort of things happen.  Of course there is also client side stuff, so it can be difficult to know which is which sometimes.
---
I've only got two ops left and I can buy ela with renown so I'll just get finka
---
&gt; The DDoSing isn’t Sony’s issue it’s Ubisofts.
---
Given as Sony run the PS4 servers...
---
thats an amazing idea, specially on defense
---
There’s no way that was even going to work I think
---
I mean, there's no global authority on what qualifies as a one tap, but considering that the term was largely popularized by CS:GO where it has to be the first successful trigger pull upon spotting the enemy, I hardly doubt most people would consider these one taps.
---
or just dont run into people's prefires
---
Why is there separate league for women?
---
I think the current state is good.  Shields are no longer overpowered (although still very strong) at low to mid skill, particularly on console.  Better to make an op too weak at some skill levels (see Lion, Cav, maybe Ela) and balanced at others than balanced at some skill levels and OP at others.  And I'm not sure I see a way to rework shields so that they are similarly strong at all skill levels.

Tf was she doing? BMing?

I don’t play casual often I was just saying ranked is toxic, I don’t play often anymore but when I did I was Plat a played exclusively ranked, its just a pain in the ass to have 1 bad game and people screaming at you for 1 bad game, personally even in ranked if you get 0 kills while I’m going to be internally pissed at you I’m not going to say anything mean, I’m going to try to encourage you because it’s more likely to have you do better.
---
&gt;It is because you're only mentioning the negative rather than the tradeoff.
---
I think you're being disingenuous at this point because the positive aspects are obvious. We're talking adding attachments so obviously those stat changes are the positives.
---
&gt;&gt;Regardless, why do you think there should be tradeoffs?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;To make the choices more interesting and more defined.
---
Moving the choice to show a laser point mid-game (which is what adding a toggle does) is literally the same choice but with more flexibility. It actually opens up gameplay options. You can make live decisions on if you want to use the laser as bait.
---
&gt;&gt;Don't you think adding the vert to the L85* should have a trade-off?
---
&gt;I think there should be more options so that there is an actual choice to be made.
---
This is a yes or no question that you have intentionally dodged because it is extremely analogous to the laser.
---
Last night it was a 1v1 on defense against Amaru...just kind of predictable..she jumped off roof by double window on top of Oregon to the bunks side and I knew exactly what she was gonna do with 15 seconds left. Rappels into objective side window. SMACK
---
I mean, why waste time going up ranks when you can just do that do go up your "actual" rank in 30 minutes ?
---
People are going to be toxic because there’s no reason not to be, even if there are different reports now and bans being handed out a lot, the normally toxic players, if given a reason not to be other than being a good person(which they probably dont give a shit about if theyre being toxic in the first place) probably will make em think about it more. who knows, but just punishing them hasn’t done much. At least in my experience so far this season.
---
controller is so painful
---
The kill feed literally shows the first kill.  Don’t be stupid.
---
test it out, i got 2 aces in the same match with it, i am surprised that it only get buffed every single update, it is incredible
---
again i couldn't disagree more. Literally all of these clips are of people running in on a person playing tactically and dieing to them, look at the front page it's literally clip after clip of it. High level play like you're mentioning is the same way, if you run around like you're playing COD you will lose the game, the reason the for that meta is to get in position faster, to peak quicker, to be more tactical.
---
But you’re on pc so that’s expected lol
---
My flair is da best.  LOL JKJK
---
Should we expect ubisoft to do anything about it...... nope. They only really care about PC players. If a tuber like macie jay complains about something, they get to work on a fix but any issues or problems on  console they turn a blind eye to. Sad really. It kind of seems all their games are being developed with PC in mind first and hopefully a nice port on console second.  
---
If they really cared about MandK and ddos then they would have done something about it over two years ago..... proof they dont care is evident within the console versions.
---
Start of match
---
"You need to secure the contai-"
---
"BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
---
They should just steal CS:GO vote kick system. If you kick to many people in a short time you get out on a cool down before you can play again.
---
I like that idea. It would also help players save clips that they forgot to save in the heat of the moment when they made a good play, tested out a new strat successfully, or had a funny accidental kill.
---
I think this is the one where the devs just experimented and decided to see what would happen if they made a ridiculous objective. Attacking that objective feels like you are walking up to lambs ready for slaughter.
---
it just looks satisfying lol
---
Bruh

yeah i know but i dont really play comp

Are you not running 144fps or you are not getting refresh rate of 144hz i m confused little?
---
Law enforcement
---
sadly no, there won't be any MMR restore, basically since this match counted as a defeat because of the abandon you get, and they can't know if you left because you wanted or was forced out.
---
OWO what’s this a gwammar nazi UWU
---
Yea, that

I can't find the post but I believe u/ubinoty made a statement about this.

Any updates regarding constant crashes on PS4 that seems to be associated with Ubi club challenges?

In that context last would mean the season before this one I think.

Nah. It's happened to me and you wait in a queue for like 5 minutes and nothing happens

Ok I am officially confused now. I'll just assume it was last season aka PS.

Wait is he playing with Swantopia!? He's a legend
---
We are working on a fix for crashing on PS4 and will have an update soon.
---
You could make a Machinima John Wick movie with this footage jesus
---
OwO now that’s what I’m tawking about UWU
---
Ignore every other comment. They are wrong. The reason why is on PC, Ubisoft hosts the servers. On console Microsoft and Sony host the servers and they are much easier to DDOS.
---
Try it. Favourite gun by a mile, and I'm not an admirer of guns. Legit amazing.
---
Put that aside, and ak12 wins by a mile.
---
Thank you very much!
---
The other two game modes aren’t designed for competitive play on the maps. They also don’t use the same objective strategy like bomb does. Its only ranked and unranked. If you want to play the other modes play casual
---
Do you know the YouTuber the rusian badger? That's why :D
---
Probably, but I think he was like less than level 10.
---
They used to go directly at the individuals, back when the voip publicly displayed the ip addresses of everyone to the server. I got hit twice. Internet was down for 45 minutes each time.
---
Thanks ... i dont know why reddit community downvoting me for no reason + they dont trust me at all ... i can't understand these people .

Nice, well done.  I really like the Fuze one..... cant think why though 😏

Had one game where we were losing 3-0 and someone DDos'd on the final round 🤷 made no sense but whatever
---
Ight Imma head out
---
I play on pc and console and I can guarantee that console is worse. You don't have text chat, but the people you have to deal with and the multitude of ways people on console can be toxic is way worse than pc. MnK, DDOS, and that doesn't stop people from sending you DMs. If you join someone's party who doesn't like you, they can DOS you personally and basically knock your whole router offline. Trust me, console is worse.
---
Headshots on shotties have a 1.5 damage multiplier. They dont instant ko, but they deal more damage.
---
Hey, how is ddoss done in siege? You’re playing a game and somebody does this when they are losing? What happens and what all is affected? Can somebody explain to my stupid ass please?
---
So they thought this was an appropriate change but diamonds being able to match with silvers and coppers is perfectly fine
---
That wouldnt be a problem if I didnt hold that thing half an inch away from my eye.
---
Fantastic. This is exactly what should be happening right now.
---
The worst is when you start on attack and go into defence 0-3 bc of the scummy dossers
---
Yeah countless posts with red connection issues and broken hitregs it's 100% users fault. Not to mention pings for everyone outside EU and US.

oh shit really?

Going down from 3 matches per server to 1? Damn, that's a 66% cost increase!

---
The Ddossers:
---
"Gentlemen, synchronise your death watches."
---
Why didnt I think of that
---
Again not what I'm talking about. I've submitted videos where we stayed the entire time and lost. Not from getting kicked but from being unable to move in attacking rounds. There should be a system where a team who loses like this gets their MMR back.
---
Pass
---
If I had to guess, it's the wide use of DOS services on console that make it seem like it's a normal thing to do. You get a few shitty individuals that DOS to win, then the people shit on by DOSers find their own DOS service to combat DOSing, then the trickle-down effect just multiplies. Not to mention, a lot of the console community is very young and really don't have the mental processing power to understand how serious DDOSing is.
---
Who’s Obama?
---
yeah I don't believe that guy. if he is telling the truth the only way I could see it happening is maybe his team was all Gold 2's who were right on the Gold 1 edge, and the 3 Gold 2's on the other team were low Gold 2's on the Gold 3 edge?
---
I hope Ubisoft reads this.. ban the player with the PSN name NxghtmareR6
---
Trying to play?
---
The best way
---
Nah, fuck em, play adult games, win adult prizes
---
It doesn't work like PC. I think that should be obvious. 
---
Also, I don't care if you don't like it. It is how I prefer to play and I am not breaking any rules. If you don't like it, go do something else.

Or if you're on mobile click the 3 dots, then "View Sidebar" then "Flair"

That's incorrect. There is no multiplier.

Maybe turn down some graphics settings to get your FPS up.

not only text chat but voice and sometimes theres few toxic shits shoots you till you your ~50 then quit.

Yep.

They listened. I'm not even on console and I'm VERY happy.

---
Nah I don’t watch streams never got into it
---
Let's be honest. Your comment should be framed and put in place of this subreddit's banner. Every clip is a bot with a controller killing even worse bots while peeking in the worst way imaginable
---
I guess
---
You don't?
---
I don’t think the legal action will pan out. Most of these services are hosted offshore in a country like Russia. So the C&amp;D letters will be ignored. You escalate and want to prosecute? Russia won’t extradite.
---
This is more along the lines of what I was thinking in my head but I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
---
I expect accurate clipping! Make sure there is 0 extra seconds or provide proper info!  
---
Jokes. lol. Nice kills though.
---
At what point did I say blitz (or clash) were good and we'd pick them, and also I think wed not ban thermite so we can still use him, my friend can kaid trick anyway
---
Really nice 👍
---
As much as King Geroge rages about shields he makes a massive point that they are literally to op if played right

What does that have to do with anything

We were talking about how look Bandit's bike looks.

Tbh I didn’t have a problem with fuze shield/monty however blitz is another story but still

No Shield operator should be that fast

Soft MMR reset
---
He used an ash charge on a baricade, jumped in after droning out and PINGING (why??) frost. Even if there wasnt a mat, if frost didnt move and held an angle, that would be it. 
---
He is probably low gold, maybe silver. The enemies were stupid too. Its casual or very low unranked.
---
We're referring to the Microsoft Azure team to work towards server solutions, it's not related to xbone or PS4.
---
anyone know what will happen to people who played a few matches with people who DoS
---
I'm having the same issues on PC since the Ember Rise release, doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing, the video randomly freezes with the audio continuing, alt + f4 doesn't work so I have to go to task manager and end the unresponsive process
---
I've never had this issue before the update but since then it's been happening frequently enough that I'm just going to take a break from the game. My PC is all up to date and should easily run the game
---
You and your friend definitely aren't alone in this, game is as good as broken for me atm
---
We have DDoS issues, but we also have cheating in the form of aimbotting, wall hacking, speed hacks, and more. It’s just not possible on console so the kind of people who would use those hacks likely default to DDoS on console
---
He’s laughing because you thought the u/That_so_sucks actually made this. Whereas in reality, he just slapped subtitles over the Ghost Recon Wild lands cutscene. This is almost infringing copyright laws because he didn’t even credit Ghost Recon/Ubisoft. You’re not to blame, because I didn’t know at first, but now you know what happened and you can make an educated inference off of it
---
Considering your new I should tell you this now, dont use red dot sight.
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFrick.
---
I just bash my face against the keyboard.
---
This is probably the strangest big I've seen
---
Do it while you still can
---
Exactly. They are damaging a product; the product consumers bought and they are ruining the value of what a company has invested in making/supporting. They would deserve jail time. "It's just a video game" some people say to these scenarios (like Epic/Fortnite suing a cheater and kid who advertised cheats). I counter that video games are part of a big and lucrative market and it really is no joke especially these days.
---
Honestly it’s probably not personal just kids getting pissed at the game. They would react in a shitty way no matter who it is. Not sure if that helped but hopefully you get some peace of mind knowing it truly doesn’t mean any thing
---
Pfft, Fuze has been doing that since Y1S1. But cool ace +1
---
Lol damn true I'll delete and try again !!
---
I think it's top 1000 and not 5000, but otherwise yeah you are correct
---
Good now, we delete the evidence.
---
Nah, that wouldn’t remove it, what happened was he won matches with cheaters in his team
---
HAHA this is so satisfying omg
---
I was messaging them after and the messages were just mean
---
GOOOOOOODDDDDDDD, I hate school and Work and shit, I’ve only had once, hour long chance to play Rainbow since Ember Rise went live
---
Not going to lie, I felt a lil silly when you pointed that out. But respect for explaining that to me.
---
I’ve never played Wildlands.
---
Peace brother.
---
Casual also has an MMR score that you just aren‘t told, so if you’re smurfing into copper as a diamond you don‘t just keep ruining everyone’s lives in Casual. If you are ranked against plat as silver it means you play that well in casual, it’s not crappy matchmaking. Also, stop thinking of it as ranked lacking modes. Ranked is designed to be balanced around a single mode to be as fair as possible. So it’s more like casual has additional modes, not like ranked lacks them. If you don‘t like bomb then find yourself some likeminded teammates to go play the other modes without trolling and remember that your skill is still being rated, you just don‘t know about it.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Says the guy who suggested someone be a creative director because he slapped some wrongs subtitled on a cutscene stolen from a game. Certified genius right here, folks.
---
dont Need to put those Clips on reddit. Every soloQ Player has atleast 20 Clips like that on their Computer lul xd
---
I thought it was for balancing reasons
---
Thank you!
---
Honestly it’s never a good idea to take it outside of the game itself. If someone starts being a dick just throw the game harder and piss them off or just tough it out for a little. Siege unfortunately is one of the most toxic games out rn and it’s popularity doesn’t help.
---
And here you are. You wasted your time posting on reddit, where people literally can't help you even if they wanted to. And then you waste even more time replying to comments. Stop doing things you don't like.
---
Lol I thought he had animated it. Never played Wildlands. That too hard to understand?
---
Great can you work on hitreg to please. Honestly that plagues the game more than ddosing
---
Well what do you think ranked is intended as in Siege?
---
It is why my aim is a potato
---
I have been TK a few times in the past bc my name.
---
Like everything, no reason. (Maybe one "I hate jews")

Lucky none of them were on comms

Thank god. Last night my power went out a few times, Went from a 30 minute ban to a 2 hour ban.

I'm not saying I agree with you, but could you imagine being in jail for that. 
---
"What are you in for?"
---
"Murdered my whole family with a comb.... you?"
---
"I cheated at video games!"
---
how do you know who's doing it though or do you just send all 5 names? I want to start doing this too if it'll help in any way.
---
Ohh my gosh that’s so funny haha you’re very funny
---
How are they figuring out who to ban?
---
Same thing I was thinking.
---
I thought you knew.  Interro reached out backchannel and boom!  Update posted.
---
/s (if that wasn't clear).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On a more serious note, this feels very good.  Objectively, I knew Ubi had to be working on this problem, but hearing how seriously they have been working on it makes me feel more valued.
---
Happens so often in casual xbox smh, sucks
---
I already reinstalled it once, currently doung it again.
---
I play console, can confirm this is not super rare. Difference between this ace and mine was that I had the Vector. Why anybody would single file into a room that their other teammates are constantly dying in by the same person is beyond me.
---
&gt;  because it averages out 
---
and its insane that it still does that
---
How does that work with people that lets say have multiple accounts on the same console?
---
Translation,for you gentle boys.
---
Access to PlayStation Network through this account has been blocked due to violations of the terms of service and use of the PlayStation Network.
---
Don't push as a defender hold down the obj or if you're a roamer get a kill and get back to obj to defend it don't stay away to long. Most importantly on attack use the first minute to drone and get in a good spot.Play for objective dont play for kills
---
No.
---
If you’re pre firing the correct spots, because you know them from experience, and you used your brain to think “hey, I’ve got killed from there, there, there, and there before....so I’m gonna pre fire all of these spots because that also where I would sit to hold an angle.”
---
Maybe its “brainless” as a high level player because you are so used to doing it. But learning it certainly takes a brain to go, “I’ve died to this before”.
---
Uk depends but mostly neu
---
If you blink, some Unidad could come and kill you.
---
I slowly raised my sensitivity by like 5 every time I got used to it then stayed at 70
---
Cool
---
Crashing has definitely increased on Xbox as well, if you weren't aware. Don't think my game quit or I lagged out once last season but it has happened around 1 in every 7 games or so this season. Thanks for finally getting back to us on the server stressing issue.
---
If they keep getting banned, it will be a waste of money. Also, they are doing more than just banning people.
---
Goyo all the way Amaru is way to situational unless you play for fun then definitely go amaru.
---
ngl I stopped playing for the past three months only just jumped back in, I got into apex n Borderlands just came out so I've been smashing that
---
It's almost exclusively console
---
Well done.
---
Don't have to go after every last one. Just catch the bad ones who weren't careful and make an example of them.
---
Amaru's actually a lot of fun and the lmg is actually way better than I thought. 
---
Goyo has great utility in area denial and also has one of the best loadouts in defence imo.
---
Nice! I have one with finka as well, it was the most random one, I was completely distracted the entire round, as I was in a heated debate in discord with friends that I wasn’t even playing with. Just autopiloted through the map and kept finding enemies. I never even used my boost, and it was the only round my team won the entire game (it was ranked). The rest of the game, I went 0-4, it’s like you can never predict when you’ll have a good round.

More likely the tweet was auto-scheduled and the launch was botched, given it's Ubisoft.
---
I prefer the compensator.
---
you do realize the season pass saves you 200k renown? and that's not even counting the extra little stuff you get with the pass, so it would be more like 300k+ renown
---
You had to say that twice? Wow this guy an intellectual because he didn’t need to get up for and internet conversation. Who would have thought.
---
At last something good!
---
Wait...
---
Paying 90k renown for 200K’s worth of operators, 10% off everything in the shop, the permanent renown booster, the 600 R6 credits, 8 headgears and 8 uniforms for that season’s DLC ops would be a silly marketing move for ubi

I usually say you can't flick on console, but I'm proud of you.
---
Between Sony and Microsoft sure, but consoles and pc no
---
There's nothing they can do in most cases as the terms of service you agree to when using them say not to use them on networks you don't own/have permission. I've actually used them for legal purposes in the past and their quite useful.
---
I’m really starting to think you’re a fatass introvert that has no social skills so he spends all his time on the internet trying to make himself feel good.
---
Cav, because I either accidentally kill the enemy fully or die trying to sneak up on them
---
I feel like mozzie is basically a combination of mute plus valkyrie but he has better guns 
---
I'd say if you want Intel just pick valkyrie 
---
As time has passed I've gotten better at mozzie and I think he's a very versatile operator, his gadget is great, he's got 2 good primaries , he's got a secondary shotgun and he has access to a nitro cell.  If you want to play as mozzie here's the advice I would give (this has helped me but disclaimer I'm not an amazing player)  
---
During the prep phase don't deploy any of your pests, reinforce wherever you need to and make any rotate holes your team needs, now this sounds weird but destroy as many drones as you can during the prep phase, the reason for this is the less drones the attackers have the more useful your pests will be, once the prep phase has ended deploy pests in spots where a drone is likely to pass and then basically you are free to anchor or roam, these pests will be extremely useful later in the round because that is when enemies will start to drone out the last 2/3 defenders remaining and because their time is running out they are probably going to drone as quickly as possible, this will probably lead to their drone being hacked, once you have hacked the drone and you are somewhere safe then I would say use it against your enemies, the lower the amount of attackers the better, odds are they are going to enter from the same place their's drone came from so you can use this information against them and it makes winning the round much easier for the defending side 
---
That's basically the ideal way to play mozzie, assuming you survive until the end, but if you are killed your pests will still be useful for drone denial, the reason I play like this is to limit the amount of drones the attackers have, if you use all 3 pests during the prep phase and destroy the other 2, the attackers still have access to 5 drones but if you destroy all 5 and save your pests that could leave them with only 2
---
Sorry if this was a bit long but I thought it might help because this Playstyle has definitely made mozzie one of my favourite defenders so I thought I'd share
---
Little fucking Jimmy isn’t even old enough to play R6S; slap his pecker and his parents’ for shitty parents.

Of course I did. But wouldn’t they understand?

---
2q ewwww t2
---
Instead, they trashtalked me
---
Not ubisoft's fault, Sony is notorious for not allowing crossplay
---
Thanks dog that means a lot
---
How does this happen?
---
the subtitles dont match the vocals my friend.
---
Just because everyone else does bad things, doesn’t mean you do them, too. Yet, you did nothing to change the scene. The whole premise was literally the same, and someone who didn’t know what it was would think you did the animation. Whereas in reality you just put a slightly varied version of the subtitles, ad lib.
---
Just people who can't play high rank on pc so want some easy victories on console, the sort of people who never managed to win the family game of monopoly so became the banker to secretly steal money to ensure they won and then kicked the table over when they still manage to get beaten by their 5 year old cousin
---
This is a great idea but ubi wont listen
---
No this game just doesn't work
---
True, but fortnite has it. And the new cod is putting into their game. Ubisoft needs to work something out between the 2 major consoles
---
"its not the act of having the enemies team in danger thats troubling us, its who they left behind."  
---
"Who? That Nobody?"
---
"that nobody... was Ex6tra wick..."
---
No prob my guy, keep at it.
---
I rearranged the footage. I didn’t just slap on subtitles. And who said those people did bad things?
---
Interesting, I'll consider this. I'm fairly seasoned and decent at the game but I always feel vulnerable playing him or using the drones. Whereas with Valkyrie I can flip out my cams, check a spot near obj and be good to go. I appreciate Mozzie and applaud any good Mozzie mains because damn if I cant use him very well. I find Valkyrie to be more aggressive in my play style and it fits how I play
---
Your probably right but glad to hear you agree!
---
My shadowplay has 2.5 minutes range, on the first game i was a defender and the last player was scared to give me the ace so he made it more than a 4 minute game that i couldn't save.
---
Well the super shorty is made for creating murder holes for you to use with your primary or creating really holes for falling or opening hatches, not killing

People ddos and think its ''cool''. Its actually dumb and you risk 10 years or more (depends where you live) for ruining someones game, is it really worth it? It aint even hacking lol
---
Or I could pull my mouse straight sown
---
I cant even imagine see those numbers. My ping is always between 9 and 28 but in a match i was in last night it was 298 for the first 2 rounds. The other team won those rounds and magically everybody's ping went back to normal. Not sure if they were getting ready to ddos if they were losing or not. Also had my game crash to the xbox home screen in between rounds for the first time ever.
---
Thank God, ranked is pretty much unplayable at the moment. 
---
The most frustrating thing I've ever experienced playing this game is when the enemy team starts ddossing and then has the nerve to accuse you of being the one doing it just to be even bigger assholes.

Operation health part 2

Ты что думаешь, что на этом сабреддите совсем нет русских что ли?
---
I mean, if you wanted to make something like that video with Hitler being mad about stuff while having random subtitles, you literally missed the point. *That* was a joke. And what *you* did pretends to be serious. But it doesn't work.
---
Theirs a glitch were you will be put in a lobby but for some reason it may not fill the lobby immediately, leave the Lobby and join a ranked again
---
That guy must be fuming
---
Well, that explains your comment then.
---
Dad?
---
you break the law, than you expect the law to break you. jail !
---
or you could have a blazing fast rpm
---
It's found in the fan kit
---
If turning down the graphics brought framerate up then you are reaching the limit of what your GPU can handle.
---
I’m aware. But I couldn’t change what they sounded like.
---
Because as csgo pro players always say, a good play is mostly happening because the other team did something bad and you took advantage from it.
---
Found in the fan kit
---
Hey OP I just wanna say that contrary to all the hate you're getting I thought it was a pretty funny edit!
---
the original video https://youtu.be/uXBtMglqe08
---
I used to post constantly asking ubi to do something about ddosing, and I used to always get comments like "there's nothing ubi can do, ddosing isn't and issue you can fix" yeah well you can suck on a fat one.
---
Yeah basically it would be fun to see what they would do with the gadget to
---
you'd think she's be smart enough to not hold it so close to her face
---
Yeah we can watch the arrow get stuck in ballistic armor
---
You can purchase through steam but you’ll need to link to a uplay account and have to open the client to play
---
I think I'm just gonna stick with borderlands for awhile.
---
Whoops, my bad wrong subreddit, forgot people here can't actually take criticism of their gameplay and anything that goes wrong is the fault of either a hacker, ubi, hit reg, their teammates or is a funny moment, never actually their fault.
---
Also they can’t punish console players directly like they can PC because it has to go to Microsoft and Sony which they won’t enforce because they don’t see DDoSing for a 20 min match not worth the effort.
---
&gt;  up to 10 years in prison
---
Thats the key word. Normally those chargers are limited to the people running the botting services. The clients normally just get a small fine and worse case its a community service thing.
---
I've got it through steam, and it's no problem. Just remember your u-play login for the first time you open it
---
Thats the new iphone dude chill
---
Tourettes guy improving gifs since 2004
---
So its more reasonable to just get the game through u-play then
---
Lil update, my pc (gtx 1060 6gb, cant remember the cpu) gets average 150fps on siege so you should totally get 144+
---
Well, there's a lot of robbers, and people hate being robbed I'm sure, and I expect the justice system to treat them the same. No ones being harmed but money is being lost for the company and after all its clearly a crime that would probably land each of these offenders 2 or 3-ish years. There is no reason for someone to not be investigated given video proof, statistics and matching information from a player to a face.
---
The best of friends will vote kick you and leave so you don’t have to wait for them lmao
---
i understand now.
---
Ingame is an animation for a bolt action sniper tho. like the one when you shoot and are about to shoot again.
---
Sadly no ingame gun model so the leaker Rony used Ashs R4C and Meusoc to test out the animation. Guns only shot once and did the animation before shooting again.
---
So maybe we get next season new weapons again? Or next year?
---
Well not exactly, steam was easier for me to see who of all my friends play it but either way you have to go through uplay
---
Does this take effect on console? I haven't had that many people DDOS me n the boi's, but I have still lost a few ranked matches because of it.
---
Y'all working on my PS4 crashing every 20 minutes? I can't play till its fixed.
---
&gt;They invented TOR lol
---
That is not true. You can read up on the development here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tor_Project
---
Amen
---
As an IQ main I am triggered
---
That was beautiful. Granted if I was on the other team I'd be pissed. Teammates that bail on you suck!
---
Oh okay. Yeah I was only asking to make sure I didnt make an oopsie and screw myself by getting it on steam. Ty for the quick reply
---
Peak siege was y1s3
---
Also on PS4 🤕
---
IP bans dont work, its way too easy to a new IP. 
---
Most countries you just have to restart your router. 
---
Its going to be an account ban.
---
It really just depends on which service you prefer, cheers
---
so basically just Sparrow from Call of Duty but without the explosive part of the arrows
---
Why?
---
MMR rollback system will kick in for any players in matches with banned DDoSers &gt; rainbow6.com/mmrrollback
---
I stand corrected. I do know they have invented a lot of tools though :P
---
I get paired with 4 stacks or 3 stacks a lot really fun getting tk'ed and having warden bans
---
Ok captain obvious.
---
You’re right that most likely he was on the cheater’s team and they won...
---
But you’re wrong about the other thing you said. When a cheater is banned, all the matches he played in a nullified, as if they didn’t happen. That means you lose elo if you won with them **or** if you beat them.
---
Atleast you got the re-frag😂😂
---
Good job mate👍
---
You gonna actually stop it from happening on consoles as well or just focus on PC? :/
---
This games entire meta is fire rate but fucken nahh lets add the awp in this bitch
---
Yeah shit would be cool not completely viable as a character but just fun and cool
---
You should equip the ice cream weapon skin on tachankas shotgun(if you got that skin)and then a pink cupcake charm.
---
You're very naive if you don't realize that one of the function of law enforcement is to protect profits above all else. They infact do work on this sort of thing because it is directly impacting Ubisoft's ability to conduct their business.
---
On top of that, if a botnet is being used on a videogame it can be used on other things as well. It behooves them to track down the proveyers of any sort of botnets.
---
Steam 
---
Helps keep your games and friends in one place
---
You’ll still need u-play though
---
Can someone explain what these attacks are? Stupid question but I have no clue what they are.
---
I dunno really. I guess I just played better back then and preferred the operators of that time. No hate but I just ain’t a fan of what siege turned into
---
They don’t actually have a way to check which games they cheated in, and in any case Battleye bans in waves, not the first time it detects you’re cheating.
---
You can't cheat on xb1 and ps4, closest you can get is aim assist abusing with kb/m adapters on games like fn. 
---
R6 also does hwid bans
---
Hard to use but if you’re good with shields is very good
---
Gotcha
---
If you played him well . He is a nightmare
---
Go around as IQ in custom games on maps just going around finding all the cameras, helped me immensely when I first started
---
Boohoo, someone ruined my game, so its justified that they are put into the barbaric and unreasonable US criminal punishment system.
---
How can they tell who is doing it or not? I’m asking out of ignorance cause I am curious. Also, how can you tell if it’s happening to you or is just general connection issues?
---
Me and my buddies started reporting the problem when it happens.. no idea if it will help but yea it really sucks
---
So is piracy.
---
Enough people do it and it becomes almost impossible to enforce.
---
No its the worst gun
---
Can anyone explain what happened? I'm out of the loop
---
If it's anything like PC. Grouping multiple times with known cheaters gets you banned as well for boosting.
---
Thx man
---
Turns out it was just a bug xD
---
also type "you love to see it" in chat afterwards
---
Zofia is my favourite attacker because she has no whacky skins, I'm not sure how to feel about this headgear, maybe without the mohawk.
---
Goyo, Amari is kinda trash
---
Its there going to be Region Lock as well??
---
dude it’s just a game, chill out
---
Stop blowing my brain
