Thermite spared you

It already exists.  It‚Äôs the new camera position.
---
 She‚Äôs fine the way she is
---
I like Styx and I wasn't even alive when it was popular :(
---
Turret in window
---
Does she really need another nerf though?...
---

---
Anyway, she knows the user doesn't have a pulse because she's able to see defender's phones as soon as they are dead, that way, she doesn't rings the phones she see. 
---
How does she see said phones? Well, I could come up with a bullshit excuse, like "smartphones nowadays have so many sensors, they know when you are carrying them and when you're not, one of these sensors being the ones that counts your steps. Dokkaebi has always access to everyone's phones during the match, hence why she can call them, however, if she detects that a defender's phone isn't reading their user's data through the sensors, she doesn't call that specific phone, but pinpoints it on the GPS. She can actually pinpoint everyone's position, but she chooses not to because, since their sensors are active, the information wouldn't be precise (like when you are running and try to see the GPS, the information isn't as accurate as when you are staying still), and of course, unreliable information it's a no-no"
---
Or something like that. I'm not saying that's the reason, but we can always find bullshit ways to justify things, the same way we can always find reasons to say a mechanic makes no sense, like on this case. One of the most obvious being "why won't the traps trigger themselves when an ally is walking over them? How do they know who are the enemies?" And another bullshit excuse would be "the defender's communicate with each other in order to let them know where are the traps, so they all avoid each other traps through mechanics that'd be too hard to animate for the game"
---
I think she could use a slight buff tbh, or just a change. I don't enjoy playing her very much, and a change would make her more appealing.
---
Oooooh, they did Exhile Vilify. Love that song
---
(D2) wormgod caress ornament?
---
Would be op on defense
---
Okay on attack
---
i call that face the face when hit reg doesmt register your headshot but registers theirs so their face is weird from the bullet smashing into their face
---
the f2 recoil isn't random like the scorpion, it's literally just straight up. if your shots are "random" with that, i suggest learning recoil control.

And yet here we are, arguing it

Yo I was in that game with you. PhaseA
---
The only change I can think of is to make her fire rate faster a little bit
---
Really though, I always feel like I do my best after I havent played for a while.
---
I didn't realize that it wasn't Josuke until i read this comment
---
You simplely lack the brain power outwit your opponent in such a pristine environment. The open area always for you to make your own rotate into a new dimension of playing field

Lion is OP? Yes because no one plays him (on Xbox) no on plays him (on ps4) 
---
I personally don't follow pro leauge players because it's way above my head and honestly I'm not involved. Not that I would know about anything from that time because I started in grim sky. Apparently I haven't learned enough in the short time I've been playing though. And yes I know every op has a unique strength but no one has anything on par to this in my opinion
---
did you have the bad connection or did he?

Doesn't everyone that knows how to play pre fire before going through windows? I've almost never seen her being used by high ranking players..

You can play article 5 with friends. Invite team to lobby but tell them not to join immediately, start article 5, when at the skip cutscene confirmation tell teammates to join the invite, continue to skip cutscene and away you go

Whats your play style in attack and defense

No, I cannot.

I open stacks of 50 when i can, only dissappointment
---
Why do you think Echo's and Lion's gadgets are on the inner part of their arm?
---
It's quicker and easier than taking your hand off of a gun and twisting your arm 90¬∞
---
I believe that! I die everytime on that map when defenderd are camping somewhere and you sneak around they still hear you like youre slow walking.
---
Leave the Famas alone, I beg you

Because je sucks, he needs to be buffed.

Oh and you speak for millions of players or you speaking about yourself? Gridlock is never used anymore if she is it's not often so nokk won't either not after the month is up.

It was easy to remember and a super relaxed map to play on. Same reason people love house

Am I the only one who thinks it would be so cool to see factions from other raimbow games like raven shield and stuff like that? I dont think the like main characters from previous games would be necessary but it would be a cool callback to the old games.

why wasnt he punching the guy directly?

Not how it works, if the last man is downed and in the obj he doesn‚Äôt insta die, rook ensures you go down without dying unless you‚Äôre the last guy

Man, I absolutely adore your style! I love the use of the red to contrast the cooler hues, the rain to create a noise in your overall piece, and the bloom effect on his goggles. I was wondering if you've posted this on twitter or somewhere else because I would love to share it!

Oh cool, a Truck Shepard cameo.

You might as well have thrown a potato at him and it would've probably somehow done more damage

---
Is this cyber bullying?
---
/u/Thaqil
---
This gives me a couple of ideas as well. This could work a few ways. I believe these would work great if they anchored on doors like how Kapkan does it.  
---
1. Metal detector. When someone crosses over it then it'll emit a sound like the metal detectors work on other maps, giving only an audio warning that someone has crossed that path.
---
2. Global Trigger. Gives the team information on where it was triggered emitting a low audio cue to let the attacker know they've triggered it but it doesn't "Track" where they are. It just gives away their position for a second.
---
3. Operator Informed. This gives information just to the operator who placed it. But they have a unique wrist UI like how IQ has that has a list of active proximity alarms and the room they are in. Like 2F Bathroom. Image running around with your main weapon you get a notification that an alarm has been triggered you open up your wrist UI so you are limited to your pistol and it tells you exactly which one was triggered.
---
Sorry for jumping into your discussions but it just gave me a few inspirational ideas.

Rainbow‚Äôs site has a built stat tracker I believe
---
r6stats.com
---
how does the game not have it in built? like it's an amazing game but literally everygame for 15 years has stats
---
and this does not? wtf
---
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Siege
---
That title summarized the whole video perfectly
---
That was a filthy peek
---
You can see specific operator stats by clicking on the op and clicking details and statistics. If you want to see all ops in the same place you have to go to the site
---
Tbh why are legendaries worse looking than epics and even some commons.
---
How is her gadget op? It just shoots a grenade launcher which is good for destroying defender‚Äôs utility. Plus ash ain‚Äôt OP she‚Äôs just good at killing.
---
I play solo since i dont have anyone to play with, but when i did i usually only spoke when i had a callout
---
OP as in original post(er)
---
I'm Lv.180 and I have only gotten universal skins twice, which is the green one and yellow one, they can be implied to everything, so they are good enjoy.
---
Well at least now u know :)
---
A unique answer.
---
Solo or squad? Playstyle?
---
yeah thanks! I'm gonna make a more accurate one and then post it
---
This comment doesn't fit here one bit.
---
Ghost recon advanced warfighter has this weapon. And since it‚Äôs somewhat part of the Tom Clancy franchise I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
---
I used to do it a lot but I find it boring to do. It removes a lot of the challenge that I play Siege for. Usually when I fail at it it is because I missed my shots.
---
Im the same but when I play with friends my competitive side is heavily subdued  and I would do something stupid to make people laugh but sometimes(usually when they are playing dumb, not for a joke) I get a little angry but not full hatred but in solo I get so caught up in the game and winning and I wish I wouldn‚Äôt but I can‚Äôt help it
---
They reduced their health, on the live build it takes three bullets to destroy, but now it‚Äôs going to be 2 bullets
---
Indeed. Speedwagon's spirit is watching over us all. May we be successful in all of our bizarre endeavors. 
---
Amen.
---
I hate it when I‚Äôm playing defense and i nearly get killed by a kapkan trap. Rip mute though
---
I'm not saying that universal skins are shit, just this one as most guns are already grey.
---
In games modes such as casual not everyone is going to use their microphone so being able to ping is the only way they are going to be able to relay intelligence to players still alive.
---
I would consider maybe having this as a setting in ranked / custom matches where voice is more prominent.
---
Looks like an outbreak headgear
---
I... Wrote 2 sentences. You wrote a paragraph
---
No I got this a while ago. It may not be new but it‚Äôs definitely not good
---
I'm pretty sure in the rules it says we are supposed to be platform neutral so you can just take your toxicity to some other subreddit buddy.
---
Go to "change user flair" on the subreddit's page

I think  the seeker mine would be good here. It can function like twitch's drone or like a normal drone and you have to manually detonate it and it can do as much damage as one of Kapkan's door mines.

---
Idk sounds like something a gay person would say
---
This.
---
This is why I don't watch R6 YouTubers anymore. They think being toxic is funny and 'content'.
---
My advice for your friends is to always expect it. It happens a lot, so treat every round like it‚Äôs going to happen. And there are always spawns that are worse than others. I‚Äôll never spawn Police Line on Consulate, for example, because the spawn peek rate there is high and it can be hard to survive that one. Then there‚Äôs maps where I pick spawns specifically hoping for spawn peeks. Construction Site on Oregon, every time. Bring it on, I‚Äôm expecting it. 
---
It will always exist, so tell them to get in the habit of pitching rounds through windows and sometimes waiting 10 or so seconds before you run out from spawn, just because it throws off spawn peekers
---
You come back fresh and relaxed forgetting the poor games.

I‚Äôve had this exact same thing happen to me multiple times when I was only on WiFi, although I do enjoy memes about Ash and her hit box
---
It should only show if the objective is discovered by drones; that way it‚Äôs balanced.
---
Cool but GPNVG18s (his NVGs) dont really produce lights like that. The only light you can see sometimes is a filter light on your face. But the lenses don't produce lights. 
---
Other than that good job!
---
On PC not really. There are some audio issues but it has been like that since y1s2.
---
You actually missed all the shots if you slow it the last shot went over her shoulder but in real time it looks like it hit.

Why do so many people on this sub want to shoot dogs

They can't fix your shitty connection
---
Pretty sure it's because siege is a training simulator through and through, I mean, why would Mira be making gadgets for attacking ops when they're killing her.
---
It's his internet connection
---
Not necessary but it will reduce input lag by a little. G-sync or not, I wouldn't recommend playing siege on on anything less than a 100hz.
---
Oh yeah fully agree. I don't do it for the renown either, it's just pure completionist urges haha.

Cool, thank you!
---
Even if it weren't, I wouldn't change it.
---
I don't earn enough to splurge on names.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
Heheboi
---
But when you initially pick a spawn point, you have no idea where OBJ is. I get you can change in prep phase, but who gives a fuck at that point
---
No
---
And yet the clowns will say "play casual , fuck off" . At least secure area should stay . I don't want to face worse tryhards than casual tryhards
---
Hahahhahaha
---
That was ranked.
---
In terms of executing the change you're right, that would likely be a property update that takes like 30 seconds tops.
---
However, one aspect of implementing changes in applications that many people disregard is that determining what the right change is, how much of that change to implement, and how to measure its effectiveness after making a change all need to be considered.  For example, would making his blowtorch louder simply cause attackers to coordinate the torch with other loud noises going off so it wouldn't actually make Maverick any easier to detect?
---
So Jackal was The Thing all along. Wheres Kurt Russell when you need him?
---
I seriously get aneurisms from questions like this.
---
Warden would grave been better off with the KAC PDW which was only bought by the Secret Service
---
Ok, I thought about that last night, get outta my head
---
Every day is unlucky for me

I didn't, so thank you sir for the information.

They probably will have to uninstall then.

Sony and Microsoft are just grabbing your cash.

That‚Äôs the thing, it doesn‚Äôt show it so you get better at map knowledge

I don‚Äôt play glaz too much(only have 40ish hours), but to me, the problem is the time it takes for it to activate, the smoke will be half gone and the second you shoot your going to have to strafe  or else you just get shoot because of your vapor trails.
---
then ubi has done nothing and more likely nothing has changed . And ubi will lose a quarter of it's player base

It‚Äôs pretty good tbh
---
Nerfed his scope but buffed the shit out of his muscles
---
It‚Äôs unlucky. You don‚Äôt need to make a post about this. 
---
If you care that much, find people to play with.
---
Yes. Great gun and utility.
---
Kinda eliminates drones no?
---
The game needs more diversity in my opinion so I'm introducing two very sophisticated operators a defender and attacker. Warning the names do need work please comment with better names!
---
Defender: Roundabout
---
Roundabout lost her legs when she was 7 years old. She was hit by drunk driver causing several fractures in the bones leading to infection then eventually, amputation. She was constantly bullied in school growing up and always felt like an outcast so she hid herself away and built gadgets and gizmos. She enjoyed tinkering away. Who needed friends when her gadgets would always be with her. Her ability would be her wheelchair it would allow for fast movement (I know theres a joke about stairs) her chair would be equipped with "Tracking mines" that would be recharged like a lesion GU mine and placed from the bottom of the chair. Any attacking operator would be pinged within the radius of the mines with exceptions to Nokk. The mines would be invisible unless using IQ or a Thatcher nade. Gridlocks ability would not damage her (as shes got no legs) instead it would slow her down significantly by puncturing her wheels.
---
Attacker: Stumpy
---
Stumpy lost his arm while working in his father's robotic factory when a machine malfunctiobed causing his arm to be sliced off. His father manufactured weaponized robots and sold them to the highest bidder regardless of their morals. There was ofcourse people that went against the idea of selling weaponized robots to drug lords and terrorists. There was a revolt one day when people stormed the factory destroying everything his father worked so hard to create. During the unfortunate event Stumpy's father was killed. Stumpy felt lost for the first time in his life as his father was always by his side. He wanted to show the world the good side of his father's creation and reworked the arm of a concept design to replace his prosthetic. He used his newly made arm to help the world fight against terrorism, he never took any rewards or payment for helping people, he did it out of kindness. It was at this point Rainbow acknowledged him and invited him to work for them. His ability is his arm ofcourse loaded with miniature smoke grenades that can be shot from the wrist. The servos in the arm allow for faster hand movements (dirty minded people go nuts) allowing him to reload and swap weapons faster. As for counters Warden is immune to the smokes and while standing near a mute hammer his arm operates at "normal" speed and his launcher cannot be used.
---
Originally this post started as a massive joke and I got way to attached and dedicated. Sorry!
---
Yes, he has a high skill celling and is really good even for a new player.
---
Wait a couple weeks for next season to come out, idk if you‚Äôve seen the new operators but they look interesting
---
Top right corner on the main page of this sub
---
I use 1 claw to electrify wire and a wall and I'm sure many people do similar strats.
---
Yes bandit is a good Operator, his ability is really good to prevent breaching and his mp7 is an okay gun.
---
Alright my name and tag are not a lie. Im going to tell you this as I know the truth about my operator. Two words, she's shit. Not just shit she's the worst roamer in game. Statistically her pistol is the lowest damaging in game.  Her scorpion was nerfed about 5 times odd Ela's 6 nerfs.its damage like her pistol is pitiful at a max of 23 which is lower than her pistol. After 20m it gets even worse as it drops to 15. The vertical recoil is okay but horizontaly is just stupid and only allows a effective firing range od 2ft infront you. Her secondary gadgets are overall useless to her as shes a roamer whos given a barbed wire wnd shield which are usually only useful for objective sites which she usually isn't in. Her mines though are very lackluster. They can do alot in a 1v1 or 1v2 but when they most if not always go off it's the beginning of the round when just about every enemy you see has a friend behind them. It doesn't help that they aren't lethal, don't waste your time as the effects just wear out,  and are very easy to see. Ela also compared to every other defender isn't given a choice of long or close range firepower. As every defender has access tui a smg/carbine and a shotgun allowing for varied range engagements while Ela cannot make that choice and is only given close rsnge abilities which makes her be able to be outgunned by even her own team.
---
Right now Ela is 0 for 6 in nerfs and has yet to see her firat buff in game. She's the weakest out of every roamer by far especially with lesion just being a better version of her in many ways and  jager and bandit being mostly must picks for a team these days.
---
What ops do you have?What is your play-style etc.
---
That's not the point of the game.
---
Siege is about entering a building full of hostiles and strategising as information is rapidly presented to you.
---
That's one of the few realistic elements of the game left.
---
Best bot 101
---
Typical fanboy who can't stand a critique to its favorite game :(
---
Have you ever recorded your gameplay and watched back those encounters?  Throughout the history of the game hit registration has been a disaster for sure.  I've started doing that with encounters where I felt I landed what felt like a dozen bullets yet died and I have to admit I was surprised by what I found.  My experience at least has been pretty consistent with what Ubisoft has claimed over the past year or two:  with hit boxes that consider EXACTLY the character model of an operator without any buffer (which most games offer), most of those encounters saw me missing most of those shots.
---
Perhaps my experience isn't typical and hit reg is a huge experience.  However, I do encourage anyone to record their gameplay and look at those videos.  You may be surprised by what you find.
---
This makes me go hmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
The whole point is so that you don't see it. It¬¥s so that people with better map knowledge can do better, and that people who have a bad map knowledge will learn quicker.
---
One of the best
---
And I get surprise heart stoppages from statements like that dude's.
---
Red doot my brother
---
No he is right. The game doesn't start like that people just leave. it's unlucky, but more common in lower ranks
---
Can‚Äôt deny that but the recycled weapons put me off, warden I can see and being worth it
---
Sums up every kid to ever play R6.
---
Nope. Ela is fine
---
Yeah but isn‚Äôt the whole point that you don‚Äôt know where the objective is until prep phase
---
It's.... wait for it... Legendarisch!
---
They ain‚Äôt doing it to avoid adding new maps, they are trying to fix a map that isn‚Äôt very good to then make it viable
---
That looks like Forza Horizon 3...
---
By the way, what's a proper translations for capullos in this context ? I've always wondered
---
Kinda the same for fuze, more situational than anything, his clusters are ok, but Jager counters them with his ads, mute as well (not entirely sure about that but it should work) and the clusters are loud as shit.
---
Thank you Father, amen!
---
Technically speaking the gadget isn't disabled, Ubisoft just updated the starting number of claymores and deployable shields to zero.  As /u/dankine pointed out, this is likely because they didn't code a way for the gadget to be actually disabled on the fly.
---
Yoooo it's me Tsuku, thanks for sharing this on Reddit bro, also I appreciate the credit man, mad respect! üòÅ
---
already since 21th of May
---
2 of his charges counter all of his ads and mute does jam them so they can‚Äôt shoot
---
I don't understand the game???
---
Oh okay then
---
Nothing wrong with her primary? Her SMG is borderline useless, you make it sound like I want her back to release state which couldn't be further from the truth.
---
Well I‚Äôm glad i got my pc‚Äôs internet fixed
---
But you're sweating in casual then
---
chillax with the whole race thing, loads of people do it.
---
Her SMG shreds? What platform are you on?
---
Cause since it‚Äôs event skins it will cost more I don‚Äôt have boosters or vip boosts
---
But that's still so stupid
---
I think we are the same damn person,  we both like to rant. But even with how much I love paying my Ela I've kinda just given up on the game. As s its not just her with these problems,  its more than just her who ubi neglect aswell as the players. Not even just the operators but certain maps, gamemodes, and mechanics are just left to rot which I'm just sick of. I've plsyed the game for about 2 years now and the more time i play the less fun i seem to actually have. Destroying the enemy tesm with the fo12 over and over isn't fun anymore. There's no chsnge and when there is its just ruining another part of the game. 
---
Kinda why i switched to.war thunder as my main game of choice.
---
The Turkish . The Spains and the Russians also . Not just the Arabians
---
No I‚Äôm simply playing the game correctly lmao why are you so trash? Wtf is wrong with playing the game how it was supposed to be played in casual?
---
\*Mozzielock
---
Yes, a toxic game.
---
Ah good old desync I'm here but not here.
---
Bronze brother. Copper is a really dark brown.
---
at least you're crediting the creator , not like those 1 inch dicks who post something not theirs and not crediting the original artist
---
Well me and MY Bois want to play secure area, because it's tactical but not too tactical, and in an irl situation it doesn't make that much sense
---
Why do you think Ubisoft doesn't care?  There is no way for them to reliably detect someone using a keyboard/mouse on console; to start using heuristics comes with significant risk of punishing false positives.  If you're relying on user submissions, that is a very manual process that would take time for Ubisoft to sift through, and even the most blatant-looking case of keyboard and mouse use may just be a top 1% skilled player with a controller.  Similar to the legal system, it's better for 100 guilty men to go free than to convict one innocent man.
---
You can get the same angle from rappeling on the building, right?
---
Maestro looks so confused...
---
Wait, the low rank with the high ranks?
---
Shit I‚Äôm bad and play with one friend who‚Äôs at least 8 ranks higher then me. But I got no one else. And I‚Äôm fine with that because at least he‚Äôs not a racist.
---
Friendly fire: this page lacks consistent knowledge, *you can help by expanding it*
---
Ok thank you for confirming mute, never tried it.
---
A north eastern african servers would solve a lot of african players ping and better ping for arab players.
---
one more week and then TS will be over . Phantom Sight's release is the week after the next one . which should be 11th of June i believe
---
It's a joke; Maverick, Lesion and Dokkaebi are annoying to play against. The whole list is a joke
---
*Your position has been compromised*
---
2 draws
---
He T H I C C
---
He makes content for the 75% of the player base (silver ‚Äî&gt; Gold) which there‚Äôs nothing wrong with. He has opinions and whether they‚Äôre right or wrong, he expresses them. 
---
No hate on his behalf. Yes he got nomad wrong but Clash was correct
---
WHY ARE THEATRE WALLS REINFORCED
---
If people only followed the rules first . Cause the "memes" rule is like not even existed
---
When you hack a twitch drone
---
So because this obvious premade had fun time and had a laugh in this game they're playing wrong?
---
&gt;(((IDF is too much of a "sensitive" matter. people will be butthurt over it taking it above and beyond where it should be.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;its a game. treat it like one. have fun in it. 
---
&gt;the whole idea of R6 is special operators from across the world joining together to beat some organization (that you mop the floor with in terrorist hunt)
---
&gt;so why shouldn't everyone be welcome there? the whole idea of R6 is universality. not universalty.)))
---
Yes, it shreds when you are 1 foot away from your target at which point you might as well have her shotgun and aim for centre mass.
---
Her SMG is meant to be her ranged option, when her SMG has less effective range than her shotgun, that is a problem.
---
I play on PC, and yes whilst recoil control is much better there you would need to have the reaction speed of a god to counteract the horizontal recoil.
---
in newcomer I could see your point, anyone playing ranked should know where to spawn based on which objective is being played that round, its pretty much basic map knowledge tbh
---
No but like you have them as an acronym
---
What's the problem here?
---
 I see 4 scrubs and one guy who is decent.
---
As long as you coordinate and play as a team you shouldn't have any problems.
---
But also if you cant br a team player and this bugs you so much go play casual you filthy racist casual.
---
YES THIS!!!! I've been saying this since year one ffs.
---
Lmao try spending time outside
---
are you colorblind?
---
as a realistic player, Solo is basically massive BS
---
yikes
---
Or u just learn the Maps. Not that hard huh?
---
Ewww you teabaged
---
I have no issues at range whatsoever. I play on PC and I think it comes down to being able to hit headshots really. Even then I still don‚Äôt have issues. I mean I‚Äôm not spawnpeeking with it (I use the pistol for that) but I see no other issue. I think she‚Äôs just one of the more difficult ops to learn.
---
How many new maps are actually liked by the community as a whole?  Two to three (four tops) out of 11 (I'm including Hereford because with the complete overhaul it essentially is a new map)?  With those odds and given the success of the rework to Clubhouse, I'd much rather them spend time fixing up some of the maps which are less hated than most new maps but have some undesirable quirks than continue to pump out maps that have a better than 50/50 proposition to be hated by the community.
---
also that dummy thicc
---
Once you get used to things you'll love it. I've been playing for over a year and im still pretty bad, but i love the game. In contrast my friend got the game played for 2 weeks and left it. He gave up really easily and wasn't willing to keep trying
---
When all this is over, syphilis is on me.
---
This would defeat the point of droning I notice that a lot of higher level players find the objective then hide their drones this would just make it so they don't even need to enter the building with them
---
Uh, no.
---
I love that skin, because Damascus steel is beautiful
---
The title doesn't matter doe
---
&gt;End of the round I ask why and his buddy says because I‚Äôm a hacker and that he saw me snap on a guy‚Äôs head. Here‚Äôs the kicker I did not even have a kill in two rounds
---
They were obviously trolling you. Next time this happens you ignore the troll because that's what they're trying to do, they want attention from their victims.
---
how about maps from other Ubi titles? there are places in Wildlands, Assasins Creed, and Watchdogs that could work. 
---
Ex: Nudle HQ in Watchdogs 2

Know hit with hd?

Shut up crybaby.

Oh, well it seems as though I have been playing in casual for too long

recruit?

Mad cuz bad dummy

Like you yer cool

Can you believe that some people turn on their console/PC just to lose because "I'm nOT a TRy hARd" üòÇ. They're just in denial that they're shit at the game. 
---
Winning is significantly more fun, so those that can't make excuses.
---
I literally have google fiber never get drops in any game but this game seems to think I‚Äôm living in Madagascar sometimes.
---
Beautiful
---
Zofia and Ela : are we joke to you ?
---
Honestly right now, his shield never works, they shoot right through it. Yesterday I got on tapped right through it.
---
\&gt;FPS on a console
---
There's your first problem.
---
It would show after you find obj though
---
It's kinda like the Spanish shotty. Not great but will one-hit-kill people who are trying to put a sledgehammer down your pants.
---
Recruit is already in the game
---
U dont u use her shotgunü§§
---
He‚Äôs suggesting that after you find obj it shows up in the change location screen
---
PC
---
It all good tbh a lot of people play casual more than ranked so they might not ever know
---
The barrel is always pointed at something, so that is null. She isn't pointing the gun at her face. Barrel isn't pointed at herself, or anyone else, and her finger is off the trigger. Pretty standard gun safety.   
---
If a fly landing on your ear causes you to panic, put your finger ON the trigger, and have a negligable discharge, then you probably shouldn't handle firearms, or operate heavy machinery.   
---
Again, this in and of itself isn't dangerous. You can come up with a thousand what if's, but there ARE scenarios where having your firearm in a position similar to this can be reasonable/optimal. Would I recommend this for range shooting? Of course not. That is a completely different environment.
---
I‚Äôm 100h you‚Äôll be level 50 max
---
Yes i was talking in rank match not casual
---
OR u could just learn the map
---
PS4 Players are so sad

By the Gods it is possible

oh my fault lol, probably around 30, haven't counted them
---
He‚Äôs suggesting it pops up after you find obj
---
Sad times
---
Indeed
---
Thank you for clarifying take my Karma as you will
---
That literally what op is suggesting
---
 Secure area is much  fun when you play solo not Bomb
---
Defenders: Intel. Echo is op. maestro and valk are frequent.
---
Attackers WAS smoke/flash but that's about to be shaken up with glaz nerf and warden.
---
I wouldn't say he's OP. With good teamwork, you can counter his rush to kill you. He may have his sights on you, but not on your teammates.
---
I don't get this logic at all.
---
"practice in casual, not ranked!"
---
"don't tryhard in casual, tryhard in ranked!"
---
can't have it both ways.
---
Jackal is like the ONE balanced op rn
---
Yeah, but Lone Wolf is great in a squad of three. Atleast the three easier game modes.
---
Holy duck i want this. It's 2nd year i play and i still respawn on the wrong side
---
Yeah, I'm Normally an RPG guy myself, someone suggested seige and here I am lol.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/codeunbreaker
---
They have merged into something you cannot comprehend
---
It really wouldn‚Äôt though because it would appear after you find obj
---
I think you have learned the Ubisoft servers.
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
u/codeunbreaker has not said the N-word yet.
---
I've put 75 hrs into R6: Siege since release. I have a job and a girlfriend, man....
---
We love casual
---
The only time i try hard in cas is 1 round for warmup to ranked or when i check the other team and its golds/silvers considering im copper
---
And also what ever B is on ps4 :)
---
People play casual to dick around and lose. Or meme strat. What rank are you, because if you have a .5 k/d and just argued with people about how you sweat in casual, then said you meme in ranked. I think that your about copper III
---
Thats rough
---
Ok the concept of twin ops is actually kinda cool. Your ability idea needs some work though. With twins, one on each side it would either make that season boring cause your only really getting one op but cool at the same time cause they would have to have different loadouts. Like really there is alot you can do with it.
---
Good
---
they tried to meme you and paid the price lmao
---
that's why I don't follow my teammate, I make my own path lol
---
Yeah but what he‚Äôs suggesting is showing obj on the map after you find it to help new players
---
No that is not what people do, in 99% of the games I play in cas everyone is playing seriously, ranked is for memes
---
I still aim for his dumbass face
---
F U
---
Feels really bad
---
That's pretty fucking rude asshole.

Most accurate cosplay give seen on Reddit, real good job man.
---
People found this out when kaid was first introduced
---
That could work as well. Although if knocking the throwables is random then i could see the defenders getting fucked by it.
---
Imagine playing a competitive ranked mode and complaining people are trying to be competitive.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
no it just ads a 27 round mag to your ammo pool.
---
you have 3-5 mags (depending on the weapon) that rotate so imagine having 2 mags left shooting one till you only have 5 bullets left, reload, shoot the other one empty, reload , and your greeted with your other nearly empty mag.
---
so basically you keep all mags unless they are empty making you think about if it makes sense to reload your mag with 10 bullets left
---
Crazy concept if ur scared of people being pricks mute them or only play with friends
---
Hey glad main üëã

Mozzie had a baby with gridlock

Predicted something people have been suggesting for 3 + years.

An operator that can make custom floor hatches; I got a bunch of them when I was young and dumb, i‚Äôm willing to show them if they are wanted
---
Thanks
---
I stand corrected!

Why do people like you feel it‚Äôs so important to speak your opinions?
---

I‚Äôve been running it on Jaeger for the memes and it‚Äôs surprisingly done really well for me. Silencers in general work really well for my super lurk-y playstyle

Is that the extended barrel? Ewwww

Eww an evil geniuses fan
---
Low, as with most strat roulette starts, I would imagine. Although the Jackal + 4 shotgun recruit hunting party strat is a fuckin blast
---
like I am not against it, just have a more competive casual, I like bomb only, but sometimes I wanna play bomb casual and there is nothing to do in that situation.
---
Oof
---
not new but that‚Äôs just straight cheese
---
People made this post into America vs Europe. And I just wanted it to be a joke. That‚Äôs what I meant with arguing
---
takes only 1 bullet to stop
---
It‚Äôs about a billion times better than Mira and Jackal‚Äôs, but that‚Äôs not saying much. It‚Äôs serviceable. It has short range but it‚Äôs fairly reliable at its effective range. Basically the polar opposite of the supernova
---
depends... for how much you're willing to sell it. because I was thinking about getting a smurf
---
It's because it's a waste of money to produce a map that won't be in all the versions. So the censorship still screws us on new maps and cosmetics.
---
Well it‚Äôs wherever the goop lands when it‚Äôs launched and so if anyone gets killed by throwables from the goop launcher, then it‚Äôs either poor placement of the goop launcher or poor positioning from the defender
---
if you don‚Äôt restart the queue after 2 minutes you‚Äôre just wasting your own time. it‚Äôs common sense

Strat roulette is always a great change of pace when you/your squad lose a few in a row and need to get some frustration out

It's not stupid at all. Logically, why would any company just waste money for marginal benefits. It's not like they'll make a shit ton of money from a casino theme, which is the only way we would get it now.

IMO, no. It will be too easy and most matches can seem to be the same with this.

There are ways to do things, like naming it ‚ÄúCalypso Resorts,‚Äù and rebranding the building more as a Trump-Style high-class hotel with gambling elements toned down, but the basic essence and layout of the original.

Use your imagination.

Ranked is there to have fun too. People forget that. It‚Äôs a video game. Yes it sucks when people do things like abuse glitches or are toxic but at the end of the day if you‚Äôre not having fun, do something else that you will have fun with

Wait how do you make custom versions

Not really? I would a casino map but we would be more likely to get an elementary school at this point.

Throws battery‚Äôs at people with wires on the end. Mira

How about when kapkan traps were insta kills

Came here for the THICC comments. Not disappointed.
---
Yea a lot of buttons are already taken. Maybe allow auto sprint to leave R3 open?

Madworld
---
It's not NA because there wasn't an eagle screech.
---
Okay but kaid is something new and special while he could be helpful to slow the attack but in the end it wouldn't be a difference to J√§ger
---
Sure it ain't the 30th?
---
Update: I restarted for what must be the 6th time and no warning, queued for a minute and I‚Äôm in a game now, still not great for how long I waited
---
Online anonymity gives people a hard-on for the urge to be toxic.

Playing Fuze on hostage is the only way to get dat hexa-kill
---
Set your birth date to 44 BC and play with Julius Caeser before he died.
---
You're really just proving my point: sweating in casual is totally fine and it's only "bad" because weak minded people like you dont want to try. You're actually delusional enough to think that trying your best is toxic.
---
You must not have been playing video games for very long if you think some people arent going to try their best in any online pvp setting. Winning is fun. Get over it
---
pretty much every game is toxic bruh, people hack in minecraft servers.
---
GOD TIER AF
---
This hurts to read

Turns wallhacks on for the friendly team. Thermite.

How? I only have 2 black ice and I've been playing agesüòÇ

He'd make a good attacker. 2 speed, 2 armour, can use thermal goggles to see through walls.
---
Yo wanna 1v1 me bro
---
[deleted]
---
umm, wrong post?
---
You wanted to pick thermite but someone else took it at the same time you did, causing the game to pick ash for you
---
So you recommend that people never spawn at a certain spawn location? Doesnt sound fair to newcomers and just sounds really stupid
---
Hans...get ze flammenwerfer.
---
Well it worked for you here, even if it shouldn't have. Tbh I was worse when I started out
---
You indeed did it to em
---
You have to defuze this tense situation
---
I agree, due to the competitive nature of this game.
---
Were they not insta kills at launch?
---
Most likely! You learn something new everyday!
---
When you fail at meme killing the last guy, you have to try your hardest the next round.
---
Crazy dope. Can we play video games together?
---
Can't say, i've never played GO. But hardly a match goes by without some form of toxicity. Of course there are 54 more players in a game compared to siege, so you are bound to run toxic bois more often.
---
It may be too similar to jager, but what i know is that jager is the only anti projectile operator in the game which is why his pick rate are so high even though he's not op. We need a new anti projectile operator, however coming up with an anti projectile gadget is pretty hard.
---
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt play an explosive operator in hostage, or don‚Äôt play hostage at all
---
also needs a mouse wheel to zoom in and be able to move it around and select floors
---
Yes they were i was referring to that before they buffed them
---
I'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks mav is a hard breach. My buddies disagree.
---
HAAHAHAAHAHAHA your dad is epic
---
&gt;Well the p10-c has a sight which other guns don't have
---
Go check Ela, Zofia, Maestro and Alibi's sidearms it literally has the same sight as the p10c, the MPX is good for headshots only, the ARX200 is strong as is the C8 it wouldn't balance them well either.
---
Hey wait I know Hzrd, he's me, funny shit.
---
anyone else hate it when people put out videos like this showing how you can get onto certain things or glitches/bugs that you can do to get into a cool spot. Like just let the elite few people that know how to do them do them.
---
XB1
---
The way I see it, you start off trying to get basic skins just to look good. Then you get good-looking skins. Then, when you've amassed an arsenal, you only use skins that match your current look. The fully evolved form. Then, and only then, can you say that you've mastered an operator. 
---
I have precious few of these, but those that I do I value highly.
---
[like this](https://puu.sh/DzP9V/6c3d2a2213.jpg)

Good I fucking hate shields with a passion
---
Damn yeah, it might be, what about June 67th?
---
Yes, too accurate
---
Especially when you step on them and they stick on your foot xD
---
Buff or nerf cuz buffing insta kills is.. welp OP üòÇ
---
You would be correct
---
Probably because they want a chance of actually killing someone.
---
Mans got the russian badger loadoud
---
Real question is why is he using the commando?
---
Nerf sorry lol

Luckily this is a run out and not a spawnpeek.

---
The worst meme I've ever seen. I love it
---
I think most would agree that having a new, unique weapon model is better than skins. They've been putting out distinct weapons with identical or very similar statistics since the legacy ops, so I don't see why it's an issue now.
---
And to be honest I'd have been fine with the FMG-9 going to Warden instead because it's basically made for him, with P90 as another primary option. Nokk could get some MP5 variant. Reusing existing weapons isn't a major deal if the selection makes more sense, and they could make minor modifications to them like they did with Gridlock's M249.
---
This does bring a smile to my face
---
What's your lvl?
---
I feel most relaxed when I'm owning everyone I see
---
Well rising player base recently means that all types of people hook to the game nice or mean and i would disagree about pc. Sure toxicity every so often but I‚Äôve been playing pc for only about 40 hours now and haven‚Äôt ran into one toxic player
---
The games getting easier and less tactical and more run and gun. Hat along with toxic cod players playing it more with the ability to Tk
---
I see this as an absolute win.
---
Nut nut nut nut nut
---
Rook with an red dot. Yup, definitely your second game lul.
---
30 so I just unlocked ranked
---
Creepy af
---
It took until I was level 135-ish for me to get a black ice, I‚Äôm level 187 and I‚Äôve only got 3
---
Warden is another possibility but ur right
---
I love how they all look up with horror and try to retreat on the killcam. üòÇ
---
Also, going shield recruits? Duh, they well deserved that fate!
---
I don't think I've ever seen a Mav make a hole large enough to at least vault or crouch through in comp.
---
Ok thanks
---
&gt;It‚Äôs a special type of printer that prints on cloth , I just went to a store to print it
---
Wah wah you people need to get over your selves. If you post an image on reddit anyone has the right to use it. Being giving credit is a bonus
---
I‚Äôm gonna main warden lol, who cares if every single player doesn‚Äôt use the new ops
---
New for silver lmao
---
This is something you'd see on a T-Shirt site with garbage generic graphics &amp; quotes.
---
Gross.
---
Nothing but the username is accurate.
---
I usually run Monty or other shield operators because of team killing
---
When i heard this i thought they were adding more ranks, not just changing the colors.
---
How do you get multiple flairs
---
Did you cry?
---
Well then it should be easy for you to realize no one is pretending to be anyone :)
---
This actually made me angry
---
I wonder what people think about ranked, of course they are gonna make it more competitive, of course you‚Äôre gonna find people who will try to win, what do you expect in Ranked?
---
I want a defender who has the ability to make inaudible sounds like Maverick's torch, or Nokk's HEL, or supressors or crouch walking, etc.
---
 I usually say that I stepped on poo with those mines
---
FUZE IS IN PLACE!
---
I mean that would be a lot of things electrocuted for thermite and hibana. You would have to drone in almost all rooms for roamers. Plus i dont think rook has enough armor for everyone especially if you get one guy that likes to destroy the pack. But alot of cameras would help with that.
---
He does, it's in a bundle. All the GSG 9 Ops got one!
---
I call a tryhard someome that only knows to play aggressive without even droning, and if he dies then he calls the teammates trash
---
Go to the edit flair (assuming you alredy know, then go to edit flair, go to one of the flairs and start putting your emotes (use this as an example :caveira: :jackal: :mute:)
---
Echo is not meant for spawnpeeking or runouts, I personally use him for denial.
---
Set up in a place where if the enemy enters, they cant prefire you, and set your drones in the entrance to site and wait for the bastards to flow on in.
---
You wont belive how many times ive stopped a rush or a full on push onto site, clutched games with those magnificent bastards.
---
Thank you Yokai.
---
Then again, he‚Äôs using red dot.
---
Oh shit there‚Äôs different types of  plats? Lmao I think I might stand a chance in new ranked
---
Ofc then I used the tears to masturbate.
---
Thatcher comes off more like Gaz, had he survived the events of COD4...
---
That's not exactly toxic tho, detonating a c4 into your team is toxic, or shooting a downed friendly in pubg or r6. I could see how someone may think that hacking in Minecraft could be toxic, but in most cases it's usually just gonna be a x-ray hack or something
---

We are 80% sure she had a birthday in the last year so celebrate this week by destroying 20 cameras or captured drones to get the charm.
---
Definitely didn't look hard at all since I'm on here as well. Please take down the post, I don't want you reposting my stuff like this
---
If only you knew how laggy that looked from Monty‚Äôs perspective, though. Positional latency when in full shield with Monty is a nightmare against 3 speeds because you can be live tracking the opponent perfectly, keeping them centered in your screen but they will still manage to desync the server by juking rapidly left/right and slithering around Monty‚Äôs back like an anaconda on their screen, even though from the Monty‚Äôs perspective they are tracking you the entire time.
---
Good play, and technically he DID get outplayed because he doesn‚Äôt understand how to play around the poor latency of the game (sitting full shield in doorway, constantly backing away from you and never standing still would have been much smarter plays), so that‚Äôs on him.
---
Nice clutch not hating at all! Just wanted to give you some insight into the cruel, laggy world of a Montagne main.
---
Use the force Luke
---
Congrats
---
stop bullying the coppers
---
I love Nomad honestly. I could see her being higher up. Decent weapons. Good ability. Balanced speed and armor. I wouldn't argue putting her up a tier.
---
I completely understand your point, and I sympathize with it, but you‚Äôre asking for civility on reddit.  That‚Äôs just not gonna happen.  Anywhere on the internet where people can hide behind a username and have no real repercussions for their actions, you‚Äôre not gonna find civility.  The internet is an environment for breeding toxicity. It‚Äôs just one of the downsides that we have to live with.
---
He had to tear down the castle and replace it with a normal barricade. That‚Äôs what he was posting, the kill just happened
---
One of them was plat!
---
It's a soft wall, the enemies can see you on the other side and can wallbang your legs
---
i love Ashmilia
---
yessss
---
i'm sure that her win percentage is pretty good anywhere from copper into mid to high gold.
---
Does every clip that exists on a subreddit have to be so extraordinary it makes you piss your pants? Calm down, Jesus.
---
All the time
---
That's would probably work.  Then you could choose to use it as an ak or as a dmr
---
I only ever play casual, and some games I full on go try hard others I just play for fun. I only ever get toxic when others are toxic. Of i see low levels in the game i try and give them some tips on why they died or what they could of done to do better.
---
Grey car, black leather interior.  Plus I forget to close the sunroof.  Also, metal shift knob.  21 years old, native Atlantan, and I still make mistakes like a newbie.

i saw the chart that ubi released about the win % and frost was wayyy up above
---
Calling me or sum

everyone that doesn‚Äôt deploy anything dies with there utility, just because u named like 6 operators that don‚Äôt the amount that die with there utility are greater. you don‚Äôt have a single clue about rainbow, you bronze

i didnt realize they were meme stratting until i scrolled down lol

---
This is my cousin. He is the best console player I've ever seen, and I've been begging him to post his stuff to this sub for awhile. He is old &amp; married, and doesn't play R6 anymore so he said it was fine. He clearly doesn't give a shit about his youtube channel, as the videos have like 20 views each. He said he made them for him and his buddies (hence the weird intro and character).
---
The craziest part of this footage is that he said each video is from 3-5 days of gameplay, he solo queues 90% of the time, and he rarely has his mic turned on, so the plays he makes are based on instinct/sound and not callouts. I hope some console players enjoy seeing what is possible with a controller.
---
Sunroof allows some heat to dissipate, but yeah, every car ive owned has had a metal shift knob, and after the 86, ive learned to keep an old shirt handy to cover it
---
Glaz I could help. Haha sorry couldn‚Äôt help it. Yo I will want to be careful he is getting a heavy nerf where you‚Äôll have to be stationary to use thermal sights

okay you sound like you must know everything about the game, so please tell me, where should I be playing Doc in my tier list?
---
Found the plastic rank player.
---
I'm not easily amazed by the majority of the clips posted here but that made me laugh out loud.
---
Bro that happened to me once. I was IQ and I was downed by a wall I was trying to breach. Doc gave me the stim shot, missed the headshot with his revolver, and I detonated my breaching charge and killed him lol
---
Pfft, the teacher probably felt too threatened to give it a 100.

You got ubisofted

I sure can, being toxic creates toxicity, not hypocrisy its just the truth.

probably a or b group, how many hours do you have because you don‚Äôt seem like u know anything, bronze player trying to make a name for himself.
---
I once though of a hard breacher that would use some sort of magnetic stuff to instead opening a hole, he would just "unreinforce" the wall, making it a soft again.
---
They took them out
---
What do you mean twenty minutes, it's either 4/5, 3/4, 2/3 or 2/2 required to surrender. Stop lying you do not need 5/5
---
In casual the aim of the game is to win the round, what does it matter how much effort someone puts in to win? Some people played the game for so long they just do what works for them.
---
Being toxic is one thing but are you claiming that being a try hard is toxic?
---
It shouldn't be, i cba wating for other guy to click surrender if I need to derank
---
Bad troll even worse b8 lmao
---
no it just has to be a little better than 2 easy kills in a round. if you thought this was reddit worthy then you must be in copper
---
I think it's because people just enjoy being an ass. I for one am HIGHLY against spawnpeeking and runouts, but there's nothing we can do to prevent them. Learn to counter them and hope that most people aren't dicks. The teamkilling fix works, but not as well as people would believe. The TK forgiveness feature is a godsend, though.
---
Oh okay then r they going to bring something else with the next update???
---
....and? why does putting down a barricade belong on reddit
---
I meant that if u use it in full auto, it would shoot normally.  If u use it with the hyper burst it would act like a dmr

I'm breathing a little heavier, I'll admit that
---
Team killing in general should be a team vote thing. Since the release of the new mechanic I've had more people running in front of my fire trying to get me to hit them and teammates just being nuisances (following me around and just being loud to give away my postition) if you team kill it should be a team census saying hey. Was that warrented?

Why? Because he used words you can‚Äôt understand? Sorry, maybe everyone should speak like illiterates to slow down to your pace of learning.

Dude chill he thought it was cool that doesn't mean you have to. For all we know he could just proud of his first couple kills

They removed them temporarily to stop people from exploiting glitches with them
---
Kinda haha I just wanted it to be her more at least
---
I think it would be neat for them to make a map unique to both versions out of respect for their laws, though it's extremely improbable. And honestly, I think that Gubi should just release whatever cosmetics they want and let China decide whether or not they allow them on a case by case basis. It's more stifling for the devs to have to adhere to their rules, and China has no right to hold people who don't live in their country to their rules, which ia more or less the end result here.
---
Cringe.

I'm all for it my guy.

Wow my first positive post, most of not all the comments have been pretty positive. Thank you for your thoughts,  it seems that I've found the only few good ppl on this subreddit.

Yeah. I understand your frustration because I too raise my concerns and they are immediately ignored. It‚Äôs really upsetting to see the community being so exclusive of others worries. They don‚Äôt even try to make them feel better, they just attack and belittle the person, which feeds into their worries even more.
---
Thank you so much
---
Not really a woooosh but üíÄüíÄ

I would to see a defender that puts down some motion sensors that ping any enemy moving in their radius. The op would probably have 3 of these.
---
That nose. I like it.
---
Nice mate
---
Wait that‚Äôs the true chad way to frag
---
Nomad is broken if you know how to play her. Since claymores are gone she should be a top pick right now. She has good guns also. Alibi is just a fragger
---
And this face doesn‚Äôt even remotely looks Asian. She is Japanese and Ubisoft had her looking like an American in Spec Ops cosplay.
---
That is a very strange reaction.
---
So smurfs? I fucking hate them. They will be what kills Siege (especially on Xbox).
---
Your welcome sorry if it is kinda of confusing

How does that even work

Laughs in mechanical traps

I miss deployable shields.

---
The siehe community just baffles me with disgust sometimes.
---
Mouse and Keyboard support is not officially supported by Ubisoft in a range of their titles including Siege, however the use of extensions to manipulate the console into thinking a controller is being used but instead a M&amp;K is connected, this method is undetectable and the reality of it is that Ubisoft can not determine who is using these as a method to cheat. Thus rendering the problem unsolvable. 
---
Only way to CHEAT is to use these adapters.

It is slow, tactical and unforgiven.

" Will I get left behind and perform really badly compared to more experienced players?"

Yes, as in any competitive game.

RFF will never be enough unless it follows you from game to game. Let's say you get RFF turned on, it adds a point that lasts a week. If you have three or more points than RFF stays on until one of the points falls off. Something like that.

I would but most of the time when I play Siege, my team always has a camera operator like Valkyrie or Echo, Mozzie is also a very popular pick for most player it seems, every time I play i always have a Mozzie on my team, and he doesn't seem like he'd fit my play style as much. A lot of my friends do tell me to get Maestro but again, he seems like a popular pick and about 89% of the time, my defensive team already has a camera operator so there is no point, I do understand Maestros cameras double as a turret but I will most likely forget I even have them by the time the round almost ends, I thank you for you're recommendation but I' gonna have to say no. again thanks anyway!
---
Thats so cool! I hope I can get that good!
---
No after you find it it shows up
---
Bomb is more objective based while secure is more based on you getting kills and I enjoy getting kills I guess. Still bomb is a better game mode but secure area is not horrible enough to get it taken out of ranked

Lots of good points about gadgets but I don‚Äôt think any of the gadgets have to transfer over 1:1-just used as an inspiration. As far as Division not being part of the same universe goes I think it‚Äôs conceivable that agents exist there just hasn‚Äôt been an event to activate them-basically shared universe split timeline.

I have been thinking of getting Lesion but he is a popular pick for most players on my team, I have already said no to Dokkaebi and Echo because i don't see much use in Dokkaebi (at least in my play style) and a lot of my teams always have a camera operator so Echo is out of the picture, I will consider getting Zofia and Mira, Buck doesn't seem like a good operator to me, I don't tend to rush to the objective because of traps and people that hide in corners with a submachine gun or shotgun. Thanks anyway though!
---
Really? I don't remember that. But ya, that was one of my first thoughts, that if they stayed hanging it would cause a lot of people to be shooting dead bodies hanging in the windows. Not to mention client side bodies would be a huge window issue. It actually makes a lot of sense for this to not be in the game
---
like i said you dont need skill. leagues allow any rank, thats not to say you wont get stomped if youre not skilled at the game cause you will cause most leagues have some skilled players. but it still doesnt matter. play competitive if you want to
---
Yeah I think I have it now. Is 60fps the highest I could get with this??
---
Nah if they were legos you would just fucking die without warning
---
Unfortunately
---
I'll look into it
---
There is TTS on consoles for multiple games and has been for years... The days where it took weeks for an update to be pushed through Sony or Microsoft are long gone... Its not an excuse anymore :)
---
Kind of
---
You should be able to get much higher, that is just where I am with my PC(which has similar specs) due to my monitor only being 60hz
---
I am getting 60fps now. Is that the highest it can go with this PC do you reckon
---
Noice, didn't know.
---
Yeah you can't buy skins for alibi as it puts u at a disadvantage
---
But its still lower...
---
Twas me üòÖ
---
We can't and it's a bullshit... Consoles need testing too and if other games can do it I don't see a reason why r6 can't do it too
---
If only ubisoft would read this
---
Makes sense. Most CTU's use basic stuff like M4s and MP5s. There's a very small list of weapons Ubi can adapt legally. I imagine Glock is probably their biggest challenge, since its one of the most used CTU pistols, but never been used in a Ubi game since Vegas 2. 
---
Best way to see whats coming is to compare R6 to Division 2 and see what we're missing. 
---
Interesting to note that new attachments might be coming. Would love to see the Aimpoint Pro take over the Micro T2 on some ARs. DMRs should also get their own sniper sight to take over the ACOG.
---
link your PSN / XBL account with uplay, install uplay and you will be able to use the TTS
---
There should be an icon to show whether team mates are in a party or not like in Apex Legends.
---
An upgrade to the ping system would be nice too
---
Idk how you have your tag as a lesson main but I too am a lesson main, I'm glad there is some sophistication in this thread brother
---
Only if your monitor can do more than 60
---
or maybe by just tapping interact it will change the pose

I‚Äôm impressed and a little terrified that those people thought they would be able to win against a Mira and a Maestro, assuming that the anchors could hit their shots like the Mira did.
---
Yes, you CAN get banned. Goobisoft can‚Äôt detect it easily. It‚Äôs considered cheating, cheating can get you banned. Let me know if I need to write that out in crayons for you to understand.
---
Sneaky ;)
---
it's a nice astatic but not worth all the problems it could cause
---
But why are we arguing? Huh? For your bigger e-penis or wtf? I made this easy for the casual or the beginner players. Just fuck off dude. It is not important.

This operator brings no utility at all, it can only be used to get frags. This is rainbow six siege not call of duty

Lmao is ur flair that porn meme with the white girl in the middle surrounded by black men
---
How did you get that fancy flair
---
I think according to the new patch for Phantom Sight all attacking observation tools glow yellow, so maybe have that gadget stay in sync with the others (also n√∏kk's and nomad's gadgets glow yellow)
---
Wtf I've never seen somebody get 700 renown from a game
---
are you talking about the MMR?
---
You CANT because its never HAPPENED and NEVER WILL, you are a brain dead retard congrats

&gt; You have been SPOTTED!!!!

Fixed.

Sorry to be a pain, is this Monitor good enough ‚Äî&gt; https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/pc-monitors/pc-monitors/benq-zowie-xl2720-full-hd-27-led-gaming-monitor-grey-10177736-pdt.html

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll only let me go to 60
---
I said the verical recoil is lower, not the diamond...
---
No, I get over 140 and you have a better graphics card than me
---
my highest was 1100 with a full booster team and completing a chalange

Hello XxTheLennyGamerxX, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bvd5vw/i_john_wicked_the_cqb_basics_in_42_seconds_give/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

i'm sorry that you had to deal with this traumatizing experience
---
we're here for you
---
But you need to control recoil just as much. You need to pull down just as hard. That‚Äôs why the muzzle break is best for semi auto weapons, burst firing, or weapons with a very hight first shot recoil, but lower continues recoil.
---
Usually, the flash hider is your best friend for automatic. Helps with first shot, but also helps a little with the recoil of remaining shots.
---
The compensator is also good, but on guns with a high first shot recoil it can be pretty ineffective.
---
They could just do what they did with buck‚Äôs DMR and make it so where it‚Äôs anti macro but able to be shot fast
---
Casual has its own mmr. So if you go switch servers your casual mmr is reset. So you are literally playing with new players or really bad ones. Get a new account and play on EU. It's the same shit.
---
No, you are clearly being a douche. I‚Äôm new for reddit, I don‚Äôt use it that often so I don‚Äôt really know what ‚Äúkarma‚Äù is. Also you contradicted yourself. He typed it by accident the face because he didn‚Äôt know that typing the face was against the rules apparently. Idk why you are defending the fact that someone got banned for typing 3 slashes in the chat. You are super dense and there is no reason to argue about it anymore because of that reason. Good day.
---
Probably the one that is physically possible.

Lmao mad respect
---
Elite skin gadget leak!
---
Cock and balls

Bad idea IMO, assuming this means that PC and console players are now in the same matchmaking pool that could really screw the game over for the console players.

I would personally enjoy some ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù from you

Question: why does no one use a scope on Bandits smg?
---
Listen dude, people are dumb. It had like a 75% success rate.

BattlEye monitors applications running on your PC for things that look/act like hacks.  It does absolutely nothing against people who exploit glitches or act toxic toward other people.  While it's not impossible for hacks to exist on console, at this point if there are such hacks they are so rare that it certainly isn't worth the cost to try to put something like BattlEye into the console version.

lol i‚Äôm dense and a douche because i pointed out the fact that you‚Äôre lying to try and get your friend unbanned? nice logic. i don‚Äôt know how many times you want me to tell you why /// gets you banned but i‚Äôm not saying it again. i hope your friend stays perma banned because it seems he 100% deserves it

When they die maybe still have them fall down, but after a few seconds they fall, and have the rope still up as a reminder of their death

And a 100% sweaty no-skill rate.

This counts as "News" flair?

You‚Äôre safe m8 also I think they may just add them back when the new season drops, just because they‚Äôre already reworking the deplorable shields to be better

The most significant factor would be the 144 Hz as opposed to the 1440p.  The extra resolution is nice to have but is unlikely to do much for your performance, but a faster refresh can help with how quickly you receive updated information on the game state.  Getting both is the best of both worlds (provided you aren't accepting a ton of input lag to do so), but any performance boost you see will come from the higher refresh and not resolution.
---
Holy shit I never even realised that.
---
It's obvious you didn't
---
Nah, dp12.

Game came out in December 2015 makes the game 3 and a half years old.

He's referring to the fact that it's Year 4 of content.

Sprinting cancels swapping weapon action, switching between airjab and rifle counts
---
Pretty clear you didn't switch it off
---
Not really, on ps4 at least. The touchpad is also a directional button. You could just uses either side to lean in either direction. Devs refuse to acknowledge the DS4‚Äôs touchpad as more than a select button for some reason. Its actually 4 inputs: left press, right press, top press, and 2-finger press.
---
Wait explain I haven't heard any this
---
I just started the game 3 months ago and its absence was one of the first things I was surprised about.
---
I think they said something about completely removing the system we have now and would implement a csgo like system where you can play with lower/higher ranks only if you 5 man squad. Hopefully we get it soon
---
Also no sulks or images like the one in club house
---
WHAAAAAAAAATTTT?!?
---
DEM BACK MUSCLES!!!!
