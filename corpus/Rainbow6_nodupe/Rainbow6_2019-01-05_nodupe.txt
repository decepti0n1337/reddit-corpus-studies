All I know for you to do right now is practice t-hunt until you‚Äôve gotten accustomed to the gun mechanics on pc. After that, slowly increase your mouse sensitivity when you feel comfortable with your current setting. Only do this when you feel *completely* ready with your current sensitivity though

---
Fair bro, that's just what works for meüòÖ
---
Sure just saying what results my experience got me, he's my main since day 1,but without headshots I'll just continue stacking up assists and losses
---
General Repsot
---
I'm saving up for cav, which will be my first bought character 9ther than jackal (which I got for free). Hopefully her pistol might do some good for me and my aim. 
---
except the french revolver has trash irons AND low capacity so what‚Äôs the balancing there
---
I love watching clash get destroyed. Hate that operator
---
Happens to me a lot 
---
She's fun, try her shotgun so you'll always stay in range that gets you max pistol dmg
---
Thanks for the tips dude! 
---
What does this mean?
---
Yup, I'm clearly a dumbass for suggesting trying out a fast paced arena style shooter to help get your bearings on a KB&amp;M.
---
Np, and good luck 
---
It's an old repost. 
---
Ah yeah, that one. That‚Äôd be pretty useful for R6, I agree.n
---
I‚Äôm yet to come across any real toxicity on PS4, those with mics in my teams are whiny kids from around Europe, I‚Äôd rather have someone toxic on the mic instead of a 8 year old...
---
I did this on oregon basement took site in 1 minute 
---
Not what I mean. I‚Äôve been multiple operators over the last few days I‚Äôve played and every time I‚Äôm flashed only my HUD disappears and leaves the enemy thinking they blinded/disoriented me and they rush and die because I can see. 
---
8 operators is fine keeps the game fresh. R6S is a game that you cant learn overnight. You can learn the basics and whatnot within a few days. To master the game you need well and truly over 1500 hours or more. 
---

---
Ubisoft has said it many times before each new season the new operators should be stronger than the previous. They analyse how strong they are and balance according. Tbh lion is the only op operator since then no operator has been this game changing. I believe ubisoft are producing well balanced ops but just tweaking them down a bit in areas where they are too strong.
---
Same for you man! 
---
Hahaha. I agree fully haha. Squeekers kill my game.
---
give this man an award for the sacrifice.
---
Yeah that's pretty much how it would ideally work but I feel like your karma shouldn't automatically come back on days you aren't toxic. While this may be harsh your karma should only be able to increase at the end of every season by a fixed amount depending how toxic you were. That way if trolls wanted to ruin other people's fun they would have to wait a long as time. In this time they would most likely get bored and move on to other games or try to be less toxic on siege.
---
Ah ok lol.
---
People ignore that lmg. Like why it's literally the same as the rifle with a 150 round magazine
---
Nada
---
is it just on the main page when you open it? I can't believe I've missed this. Also how long is it gonna be up? 
---
I don't even know why G2 hasn't signed me yet.
---
Shield ops require the least, playing Montagne you're main job is intel and gaining ground. 
---
But if you're really worried about your aim then work on your pre firing. It doesn't matter if your aim sucks if you shoot everything 
---
You basically had connection problems when you were watching the replays. Thats all.
---
Ah, so this bug is back. Haven't seen it for a year or so
---
I was in a game with someone with 9989 ping
---
Or when they forget they are not online and it‚Äôs by a person 
---
Join g2. let pengu carry you to the champion. 
---
I quit like 2 months ago, I got tired of all the bugs every update and the toxicity
---
Or give the joining player a reason to stay, a increase in Renown or Extra percent towards alpha packs. I will always leave a ongoing match. I want to play not spectate a 2:0 game then re-queue just to be placed in another. 
---
I did see more luck when playing blitz, and prefire doesn't work in the long ranges that I die to a doc or a rook 
---
My win loss ratio. 
---
I'll carry Pengu, he's nothing compared to me.
---
Go off the first track ping. Then treat it like any other call out.
---
Oh no! My 'a dick', what about it?
---

its useful for certain meta mira spots like on border in the small office watching CCTV balcony its easier to just crouch behind it and standup to shoot then using reinforced walls
---
Pound punchers 
---
Nah I disagree
---
&gt;it only happens in the R6 community
---
That's not true at all. I've seen this happen in Overwatch and Call of Duty. Maybe it doesn't happen to streamers as much in game chat, but that's partially because Blizzard tends to be more ban heavy and you can't tk in Overwatch or CoD in most game modes so muting is an effective counter to it
---
Well it‚Äôs not my fault your gun does 17 damage.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot for doing that. Only you are to blame, not ubi

It would be fun sometimes, but it already happends sometimes. And I would hate it if it would happen more, since I'm not a pro player. But that's just my opinion.
---
I tried this with a teammate. Does not go well. Blackbeard gets his shield destroyed quickly and trying to keep linked up means you are an easy double kill  :(
---
I made it. /u/MoreCazador
---
I saw this on r/owo
---
That‚Äôs good
---
Oh well, from what I've seen and experienced its completely random
---
More like r/deepfriedmemes
---
And it's not my fault Ubi dropped 12 nukes on me in Grim Sky even tho I was balanced in Parabellum
---
I'm high as fuck right now so this was the funniest thing in the world to me. 
---
I see you peeking me from behind
---
that‚Äôs a long sentence
---
It‚Äôs a run on Ik üòÇ
---
Nah, having another counter to Hard Breachers isn't bad. Right now we have Mute, who gets countered by Thatcher and slightly by Twitch. This would get countered by the fact that it restricts your allies movements until that wall is gone.
---
Convenient deleted message on your end, eh? I'm guessing if we actually seen the entire conversation, you wouldn't be a saint either.

Cause and effect relationship.  People keep posting this, *because* of those other posts.
---
If the mods would just address the problem, then posts like this wouldn't be spammed.  The difference is that the posts screaming about bugs, Ubi responds to the ones with the most upvotes and sys they're working on it, they're addressing the problem.  The *mods* however, are not addressing the problem, and instead watch the sub like a hawk waiting for someone to forget to add a flair so they can swoop in like birds and shit all over it.

His answer made sense? What don't you understand about what he said? He's worried if he queued with someone probably around or above his level it might skew matchmaking and place them versus diamonds.
---
If you can see them, they probably can see you, dont line up perfectly before taking a risky shot
---
It was legit just "L" idk why I did that I'm just pressing buttons on xbox

@CE

Exactly so why should they nerf bb if he is perfectly balanced too???

My PS4 ID used to be plz kill me (I know it‚Äôs dumb, I was 13 yrs old and made it in 2009) I bought siege when it came out first and boy the amount of times I got killed in casual and rank are A FUCKING LOT!  I literally can‚Äôt spend a day in siege without dying like fifty times! I stopped playing the game right after Outbreak mode and planning to come back in the game because i miss tactical gameplay and not fucking run-and-gun-like fps games. I also feel for those girls, my friend which is a girl used to play with me on a daily basis and most of the games we play were the rest of our team are friends, they start fucking with her immediately and try to be funny in front of their dumbasses.

So is it a visual bug that his hammer is pink or have I missed hammer skins

it happens. I still love and play Siege(since Red Crow), but not on everyday basis...

And i m pretty OK about it. I mean, it's good that i don't play it often. Otherwise, i would be "burned" too fast (like Dota  2, where i had 5k hours. I don't play it anymore).

Great Novel. Read it as my IR book in school. Could barely out it down. The operations are the best parts.
---
Were faster than you, OLD MAN!
---
This is what drove me away from it. It‚Äôs a really fun game but there is no middle ground... Ranked it‚Äôs so sweaty and stressful to play at times. And casual is full of toxic people. 
---
You git gud with it
---
He looks like them dudes that be asking girls where his hug at

Starting to drone and learning to community with my teammates. Any team that does this has a huge advantage.
---
&gt;that seems highly improbable
---
I know, I wish I was joking.  I started around the middle of White Noise.  I pave only ever gotten three epics, the rest are from saving up renown and buying them.
---
They are banned in pro league to allow them to get more time with them. I don't think anyone considers them OP. 
---
No I'm saying this is evidence why witch hunts can't happen

I know! I was questioning his complaint

pretty sure maverick is a 1 armor 3 speed my guy
---
\#ratemysetup
---
No they are not considered cancer picks imo. 
---
To me, cancer picks are ops like Ying, Lion, Blitz, Dokk, Jackal, etc, basically anyone who has potential to be really annoying. Neither of those ops are annoying to me
---
https://youtu.be/QuhJkTB5ppY
---
Not to trash talk here, I mean this genuinely, but I actually practiced a fuck ton with pistol only just so I could run pulse with shotgun only. It was a bit of hard work but I imagine with elas red dot on her pistol it might be even easier for you to practice using only her side arm for longer range engagements, then after you get used to shotguns effective range and can quickly assess which is more appropriate, you'll probably be clapping cheeks all day.
---
Tried this today. Somewhat successful- Will test more
---
Just use it to your advantage then while you‚Äôre at it
---
People cant be as toxic on ps4 since most people don‚Äôt have mics, and there is no typing on console
---
More twitch packs get released every so often 
---
are you joking or they added raytracing for this game ?
---
Thats happened to me so many times after getting clutches
---
Any info on them anywhere? Most likely is somewhere.
---
They only aren‚Äôt in pro league so the meta can develop 
---
cursed_seige
---
They aren't banned. They just decided that it wouldn't be wise to immediately introduce new operators and a new map into pro league. They'll be allowed in a month or so, I'm not sure how long the 'ban' was. 
---
no its fucking not who do u think u fucking u are i just wanted a fucking legengemdery
---
I appreciate it bud
---
I'm a console player and I can 100% attest to the fact that we are generally worse at the game. It doesn't justify being insulting people for the platform they use (which I don't do - I play on Xbox) I get annoyed by "pc master race" people that insult people for playing console instead of pc, but just watch anyone that's good on PC and you can tell that people are capable of way more on PC and typically have better aim even at the lower ranks.

Awful analogy. It‚Äôs much more like being given a gift on Christmas except the box is made of glass so you can see what‚Äôs inside. Except you aren‚Äôt allowed to open it until after New Years. Any normal person would be at the very least somewhat annoyed having to look at that gift every day but not being able to open it. Considering that the renown would go to the Gingerbread skin for a lot of people it‚Äôd be like if the gift was a Santa Hat. You‚Äôd be entirely justified in being annoyed at having to wait to wear it until after New Years.

Same. I basically only play Ela for the SMG. It is kinda trash but being able to shoot like 4 bullet bursts at a head is a god send for headshots while going full auto in close quarters shreds. Her smg is a headshot machine. I can see why some people hate it though. It has definitely seen better days 
---
Not too shabby man! Especially considering you just started playing on Christmas Day!
---
You have the leaning down better than most people I know that have been playing for a few months (you actually switch sides depending on which way you are aiming where a lot of new players forget to do that). Also good choice on where to plant the defuser so you could watch it easily from outside.
---
Keep improving dude, not a bad start at all. And it‚Äôs the feeling of getting an ace and other things like that, that make the game so enjoyable. Cheers

What I‚Äôm trying to say is, sometimes the new operators are very similar to vanilla ones, making it where you can practically have multiple operators with similar things

Yep, check out those red icons in the top right corner.
---
why cav????? she is a useless operator why would you ban her
---
The entirety of the ranked system feels half done and overall abandoned to me. Likely they were planning something but the game caught fire so they just went eh.
---
Figures
---
Someone might get hurt.
---
Almost all communities have some form of assholes, but I hope that we as the R6 community can do something more about it
---
Your going to love it, it even describes sort of how the game works.
---
She was always a 2 speed
---
Twitch has been a 2/2 since the game released.....
---
its really easy to counter a valk on sky, and the map is already so attacker sided
---
Every time this argument comes up, it's literally *always* the same in every community. "Why are they policing toxicity, the game is still fundamentally broken/flawed/imperfect/crappy-looking, etc?"  
---
Every. Single. Time. Any gaming company ever has made any effort to police toxicity, even a half-hearted one, there are always people trying to make the argument that they should focus on the *real* issues, it's honestly a cliche. There is no reason they can't or should not do both. Whether they want to fix their broken games is a completely different argument from whether or not they should condemn or make attempts to reduce toxicity, programmers aren't community managers.   
---
As for your last point, it's purely anecdotal, every single gaming community is a toxic cesspool to somebody, somewhere, and an angelic pillow fight of a brawler to others.   
---
People will always troll. Yes, there should be systems to manage that. But people will also be insulting little shitbirds of human beings, and there should be systems to manage that, even flawed ones. This "just give up on policing toxicity and make a great game" mentality is the definition of self-defeating prophecy, but honestly, it's almost entirely forwarded by the kinds of people who need these systems the most.

2 huge problems, it seem uncounterable. At worst, it does nothing, at best, it immediately takes out 1 or more operators. It's a 0 risk high reward operator. I think it would be much better if the explosive symbol was small, or it was just off colour or something, and any explosive could set it off. That way there is risk to using it. Very few operators have a no risk gadget, and the ones that do can't kill with a single one. 
---
Not really hacking but being a loser and exploiting a major problem nonetheless. Hope they got put in their places.
---
Three times today mate 
---
It does, except for smurfs. Stop making excuses for yourself, bronzer
---
&gt;but I imagine Ela‚Äôs red dot on her pistol might be even easier for you to practice
---
I‚Äôll try it, but I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to ditch half of an operator‚Äôs kit because one side is horribly UP.  It should just be balanced.  There‚Äôs already limited customization in terms of weaponry, and Ubi‚Äôs inability to balance properly only limits it even more.
---
I do good with the EVO, I‚Äôve gotten used to the recoil, but using it puts me at a massive disadvantage, so much so that I‚Äôm willing to try the shotgun and pistol.
---
&gt;you‚Äôll probably be clapping cheeks all day

Yeah, that‚Äôd be nice.  Normally it‚Äôs Ela getting hers clapped cuz Ubi nerfed her too hard.

Same thing happens to me sometimes so I just resort to ‚Äúbetter‚Äù means of winning (lion, glaz, Blackbeard, ying, etc) lol. Or just stop playing like a week and it‚Äôll be good

My fingers have been crossed for black ice on the scorpion evo for ages lol.

It's great. It wastes utility while also potentially killing unsavvy attackers. I love it
---
I was hyped when I unlocked that honestly. 
---
Don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but I've always been frustrated that I couldn't melee through a window that bullets (besides Glaz) can't even penetrate! Now I have this handy shield that ignores them altogether!

Yeh
---
How is that a bad thing?? It‚Äôs called synergy. Bandit and Kaid go GREAT together on certain sites (restaurant on Tower immediately comes to mind, as well as garage on Consulate). There‚Äôs no way to have this many operators without having some overlap. Buck is similar to Sledge but has some differences (can breach vertically but is much louder). Zofia is similar to Ash but has some differences (has two concussions but is only a two speed). 
---
Just imagine if some of the base ops were to come out today. There would be uproar about how ridiculous and OP Pulse‚Äôs cardiac sensor is. A fully extendable bulletproof shield? Disgusting. A sniper?? OP as fuck.

Obviously, some DLC ops have been ridiculously over-tuned at launch (Blackbeard, Ela, Lion) but my point is that people generally overreact to operators simply because they‚Äôre new and change the game in unique ways. Remember when people thought Jackal would break the game? This gadget ‚Äúridiculousness‚Äù is only described as such because it‚Äôs still relatively new. The gadgets I highlighted earlier would also be considered ridiculous if they were to come out right now. People are (understandably) hesitant to embrace change.
---
Long story short, variety isn‚Äôt an inherently bad thing. There have been some missteps with DLC ops but for the most part they‚Äôve changed the game for the better. Can you imagine this game without Hibana? Or Mira? Or Lesion? You may not like all those ops but they all changed the game in significant ways. 
---
With all that said, a vanilla mode would still be cool lol
---
Seems legit 
---
That would be hilarious.
---
As if it wasn't it was a laserbeam of buckshot
---
I would uninstall if I was that bandit.
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact stats alrighty
---
Sounds great just join the discord, it has very little people in it I just made it recently so I‚Äôll know when you join and just ass me when you see me online I guess 
---
I use 20 ads 34 v 34 h 
---
It‚Äôs low but I‚Äôm decent so idk 
---
ruble trouble
---
Nice channel, mate!
---
Subbed!  üôÇ
---
me too but all i know is vector lowest damage gun, at least from what i found
---
I KNOW REPEAT. ALL CODES HAVE NOW BEEN USED DO NOT TRY.
---
He was legit really cool about it. It was definitely a "What the fuck?" moment.
---
For the fucking billionth time this is a shit idea.
---
Stop talking that cave is the only thing horrifying about rainbow six. I don't think you have seen a blitz running at you at full speed.
---
I feel like elite Ash is not that impressive though....
---
It told me that too but I still got my reknown 
---
This is just one of the few glitches I have encountered over the past two weeks. 
---
Me and my friend kept encountering a "left side" sound bug, where all the ambient noises on the map are normal and ok, but any sound made by any operator all comes from the left. It got us both killed multiple times, whenever we flick left but the guy is actually on the *RIGHT*. Even loud ass gunshots close to us will come from our left, when it's clearly a guy camping on our right. 
---
Moreover, sometimes our push to talk just ceases to work randomly. Like, you push the button but the mic prompt with your name at the top right doesn't pop up. When this happens, not only does your push to talk not work, but you also can't hear your teammates who use push to talk. 
---
And then there's totally random sound glitches which make me extremely confused. A few days ago, a Sledge smashed his way into the small wine storage room connected to basement wine cellar on chalet, but i didn't hear a single. Fucking. Thing. Of course I died, if I heard it I would have flicked on that Sledge so hard. 
---
Fuck off ya perv
---
Got my first ace as well as my first 1v5 clutch. I started in very late 2017 so this was my first full year of Siege. I‚Äôm a completely different player now than I was in January 2018 so it‚Äôs been fun to see myself grow
---
At least we‚Äôre both Ela mains tho
---
Ay nobody's perfect lol
---
Bet I didn't get no credit either :( Everyone's erased my name from it lol, I knew I should have watermarked it
---
we're all ela mains now
---
Cyberbullying. 
---
It happens to me all the time 
---
Lol u beat me to it 
---
I love how you call those people empty headed apes, which is toxic, Ironic. However, don't be toxic or insult people simply because they have seen worse, doesn't mean that this isn't terrible, because it is, but they're simply saying that there is worse seen from people who don't upload videos on youtube or stream on twitch.
---
When I get on Siege I want to play complete matches. Not already lost steamroll lobbies. If I join a match in progress I leave anyway which makes that team wait longer for someone that maybe doesn't mind joining in progress. Kudos to those who join them and stay. They should not be penalized for a loss and should receive extra renown.
---
The way I see it, people that don't want to join in-progress will probably leave anyway and most people do stick around. Just allow those who want full matches to have it and leave join in progress on by default so the majority of players that don't care will continue to join them.
---
Says who?
---
I dont think we need 400 points per division (eg. s3-s2), but i thing there needs to be a gate for each one, similar to LoL, where its 100 elo (approx 4 wins or 6 losses for traversing said division)  and at the top of each division you must win a BO 3 and each rank (eg. Silver-gold) is a BO 5 (numbers can be adjusted, but this makes it so that players dont have to have a 5:1 w:L to stay in diamond, and dont get plat by playing less than 15 games
---
Wow kapkan is bouncy
---
Thats just phill swift as an operator
---
Nitro deployed!
---
Would be awkward when this lineup gets owned by recruits

So they booted you because......???
---
bless this Earth
---
I am a Ying/Fuze main. But on Ying, my strat follows with a blitz.
---
Ying and Blitz as the two needed ops for rushing, a hard breacher. And two randoms.
---
 I have a breaching charge equipped on myself.
---
Blitz has flashes
---
Others will have a set of smokes, flashes and stuns.
---
We usually run a thatcher or twitch to take care of J√§gers.
---
Rushing strat. A Smoke grenade or two will be tossed in first and then followed by a Candela and a flash. Both Candelas and flashes are thrown in at the same time followed by more candelas along the way as ying rushes in first. Everyone else follows afted ying. Blitz usually goes in first ahead of ying, but if blitz die we all go in after ying
---
The point is. Already a smart Ying player would look away or wait for the flashes to go off. (ANY SMART PLAYER)
---
The only reason this is a concern, is due to the fact that I was getting flashed purposely by toxic teamates.
---
I guess balence is a concern but not to me with the strat im still running. I've never been flashed when rushing in with my team cause im the first to enter. The fashes are usually always behind me.
---
191263: ‚Äúkills with cluster grenades‚Äù what?
---
This is trashy, don‚Äôt do it.
---
I actually don't think they look similar at all, shape of eyes, cheekbones, chin and mouth is completely different
---
It was on purpose. If it was my fault I wouldn't be so bothered, and like I said. I was playing with a friend. If ubi would make it to where you can play ranked as soon as you start I would have been in ranked. I shouldn't have to avoid an entire mode in a game because the community is so toxic and it goes beyond tks. I have gotten death threats and shit like that. I understand that this game is more realistic than say CoD, but that doesn't mean that killing friendlies ON PURPOSE should be okay.
---
It is just saying no hacks on console 
---
No they didn't add ray tracing.
---
If they did, this bug wouldn't happen for 99.9% of players, who the hell wants to play R6 siege at 50fps at 1080p with an RTX 2080ti?
---
Is that a new Corpus machine?
---
Buck breakers
---
Casual is awful for toxicity ranked is much harder but everyone is usually a bit nicer if you don't screw with them
---
Go to ubis actual website and not the club one. 
---
Fuse 
---
How much are Ubisoft paying you? lol
---
Sounds like a blind typical Ubi fanboy wrote this denying all the clear crippling problems in this game.
---
&gt; As for things like sound bugs those take months to fix and if that‚Äôs your reason for being upset then oh well get over it.
---
SOUND, which is one of the biggest sources of information in this game, something which Ubisoft prides itself on in this game, is so broken that explosions and gunshots and footsteps all go in and out randomly glitching, and you say "just get over it"? WOW. WOW. Amazing advice man. Fantastic. Maybe you need to get your head out of your ass.
---
Oh, wait, correction: you need to get your head out of Ubisoft's ass.
---
&gt; Grow up children and learn to realize siege is one of the best FPS games on the market.
---
When the pro players, and the pro scene which is really raking all the money in, is complaining of this game being fucked, then you just wait and wait for it to start nosediving.
---
I can't even imagine what will happen to Siege when Insurgency comes onto console and actually keeps their game running proper.
---
Your post is so idiotic, I have to wonder if you were being sarcastic this whole time.
---
why the hell dont u have many subs.
---
hank hill intro is fcking gold
---
Like nerfing the effects on attackers electronic gadgets
---
I know, it was a joke. lel
---
Not a hack, but an exploit all the same.
---
Ubi seems to take their time in fixing shit like this.
---
I do if it's really bad but it sucks in a game that relies on a lot of team coordination and communication. I only ever talk to give out call outs anyways...
---
Actually yes, mexican forces battle drug crime organizations just like the bope its not bad to have them

Seas here. I would have wanted a friend to play with, since I solo as well and its sh*t.
---
Well, it wouldn‚Äôt be logical really. How would the game decide when to give those gadgets ‚Äúextra range‚Äù? At least defender gadgets are deployable. 
---
I don't see why you couldn't let twitch counter it, a little container that just releases the explosive harmlessly that can be spotted by IQ

Blackbeard is really good, pure gunplay with defensive gadget that compensates for slow reactions and errors and

Custom cut order?

Then where the updoot at brudder?
---
No, we NEVER made any references to colour or race.
---
We DID NOT bring racism into this.
---
I didn't remember Okoye's name because it's been a year since I read a black panther comic, and I always prefer comics to movies.
---
Unlike you, we didn't bring in racism into this, so you are either trolling, terrible at that, or you are pathetically racist.
---
This sub has a good track record of being non racist, in contrast to the game where people are racist. We DO NOT want racists like you on this sub. Let me remind you, NOBODY in this post made a racist remark.
---
As for "black", my best friend is a woman and is of darker complexion. Her younger sister and I have shared a very strong brother-sister relationship for the last decade. We 3 have been friends since school. So yeah, unlike you, I don't look at colour when meeting and greeting people, so I'd suggest you take your sorry, racisg a*s out of here before you make a fool of yourself.
---
Not the ones that are paid off though, obviously. We don‚Äôt need an OP that plays for the other team; no one wants a 6v4
---
I do already. 
---
But yea, I don‚Äôt really wanna talk about it. Got banned from this subreddit before for giving ppl my shop link in DMs. Not gonna mess with that logic anymore.
---
I‚Äôm just here to upload.

But thanks for the compliments! Means a lot to me :)

Congrats! At that moment your Siege connection sucks, but you can obviously see Jager hitting and ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù the barricade but it didn‚Äôt register on your screen.

Just remove lion lmao
---
Just get out if copper and itll be good
---
very smol boi.
---
If for specific you mean their abilities, yeah I've some ideas,but perhaps sounds like crap.
---
Defender: (1 idea)
---
-Throws a "sombra device" that makes an area dark and hard to see for everyone except for you beuse you are using night vision googles in the whole team you can only be countered by glaz,Thatcher can destroy it and IQ can spotted
---
Attacker:(2 ideas)
---
-Use  a "k9" unit  
---
-can scavenge allies or enemies dead bodies to steal their abilities (except for caveira and vigil),throwables or drone/cams
---
Her Wrist thing should definitely be lit up to keep consistency
---
Finka boosted blitz, with a *lion drone coming in for overwatch*
---
Thats what i call a horror movie
---
Pre-order. It‚Äôs out on 25th
---
I play on console but my reccommendation is that u use ranked to practice instead of casual because its a lot less toxic. Also dont worry about quiting ranked matches if there are griefers or whatever as your rank gets reset every season and there is no point just sitting through it.
---
Do you want them to stick out more ? 
---
My hand is less accurate with hold, so i use toggle and im on PC.. it is not a good thing though.
---
Honestly if you‚Äôre going to get into siege you should just bite the bullet and buy all of the previous and current season packs.  It‚Äôs a big purchase but you should be able to get the previous ones bundled and the year 4 pass was just released. Having all of the ops is very beneficial and worth it  I didn‚Äôt want to make the purchase for all the ops but I can say once you do it you‚Äôll be happy. 
---
Haha i didn't even notice
---
Press control lol
---
No worries man. I understand too. Grind is real on this one. Love Rainbow. Got to get "more good".  When I lose 2-3 matches straight, I go to casual to unwind. Lol.
---
I like to hide in a room people normally don‚Äôt expect and put one of his drones on the door
---
As a canadian black ice is scary af so regular ice

Yes I know but purple is my favorite color and she's got purple sneakers so I don't care xD

Please

Same here. PC, Steam. Haven't ever received anything. :S But doesn't seem to be the first post of it. See it periodically still being posted.
---
Hey free renown
---
I don't play rainbow much anymore but when I did it was pretty much every single day. I loved the grind and how intense and meaningful the rounds could feel. Gg homie best of luck. 
---
That looks amazing! I always wanted to use blender but I can't model at all and it's difficult to learn for me 
---
Because people are awful.
---
Best way to deal with Monty is team work, tell your team where he is and call out a flank route, keep him distracted while your teammate takes him out. Shields often hug walls so advise team when they are up against non re-enforced walls they can shoot though to kill them.
---
I was thinking they were talking about hit reg.
---
Its a bug, you can't hear anyone nor can you talk even if you had a mic plugged in.
---
Interesting, I might try it then! ^_^
---
Looks like an outdated graphics driver to me
---
Gingerbread
---
I thought we could invite to a casual match... Guess not.
---
Unironically IQ. She the best. All the way. 
---
Thanks!
---
First 50 ranked matches of the season
---
That‚Äôs quite a lot 
---
Honestly I‚Äôd pay for a rook and IQ one
---
I had it happen before where at 3-2, a 1v1 ended in us dying to the same claymore and the round ended as a draw and the score was 4-3 and we kept playing until we lost by 2 rounds 
---
There's one!
---
Yep this happens at least twice a game
---
De-sync maybe? Idk, it is Siege after all.
---
Thank kind person
---
repost
---
I believe it! And I shit you not as soon as I made this and posted it this exact scenario happened to me 
---
In my experience any kind of vaulting or reppelling goes straight through the shield.
---
Come play this great game but please get good in casual before trying ranked!
---
See this guy gets it.
---
100% / 5 = 20%
---
20% of 5 is 1.
---
You said 2.
---
Your maths is bad. 
---
I‚Äôve been using 4:3 with 85 fov and its always been a sweet spot for me
---
Plane, meeting room. Play mute, bandit or Kaid, reinforce all the walls and funnel them through the door into meeting room

Games have been so toxic since Xmas that I won't even play with my main account. I just dick around with my smurf (no toxic stuff) and I couldn't even play the other night. Got on for an hour and was voted to kick or tk'd that entire hour I just got off it was a waste of my time. 
---
Stop it, you‚Äôre scaring me 
---
I did a lot of testing a year ago, I used to play 16:9 with 75FOV, i found that 83 FOV with 16:10 will give me the same horizontal FOV as 16:9 but it will give you better vertical field of view. That‚Äôs the reason I play 83FOV at 16:10.
---
It do be like that 
---
Seeing any R6 content related to a cinematic makes me wish they did a Story mode
---
get ready for a weird relationship with the game. You'll love it, you'll hate it BUT you keep on playing ;)
---
on attack:
---
watch out for cameras, shoot them when you see them.
---
also, spawnpeaks... if you spawn in, dont just rush in, watch out for windows. People tend to break small parts just to look through them and shoot you and thats shit...
---
on defense:
---
always.take.rook.armor
---
In general:
---
Map knowledge. Know the maps so that you can go through them better and know where popular roaming places are etc.
---
communication. Give callouts, be positive towards people, compliments etc. Makes the game more fun 
---
use alt to slow walk. You have walk, running and slow walk and slow walk is really handy to be more silent.
---
Listen closely, use the sounds. After a while you get to know every gun sound so you know who is attacking/defending . You will hear from where an enemy is comming so you can position yourself, you hear a bleeb somewhere and know "hey they are overthere" Sound is really important!
---
thats my small list, if you want to know more, just ask :) Have fun {=}7
---
I quit when my game stopped working after wind bastion. Worst fucking developers ever. My game has stuttering and shit like that, i write to support, many people report it on reddit too, and it is reported on r6fix, but no! No one gives a single shit !

No I don't. I want to make him fun for both sides. As I already mentioned in one of my replies, this idea is very flexible in that you can just change few numbers if you feel he is underperforming or vice versa.
---
Shield takes too long to recharge? Lower it to 10 seconds. Flash duration is too low, bump it up to 3 or 4 seconds.
---
He shouldnt be buffed nor nerfed. His abilities just need to be tweaked to make it more fair and skill based than it is now.
---
you're up against the wall AND I AM THE FUCKING WALL!
---
&gt; I've been using 4:3
---
So you can't aim?
---
he's talking about having 1K renown flat I suppose
---
It's toxic
---
Just a lighthearted joke. Does everything on reddit need to be analyzed to death for the sake of accuracy?
---
I've seen most people say their FOV is set to anywhere from 70-80 for Holo, and 90-94 on ACOG when using 16:9 (1080p / 1440p)
---
Damn that looks so good! almost looks like its official! /s

---
Ye
---
Wtf its too op
---
nah dude, their background stories are very intriguing and i would like a movie about them, but i tell you that dokkaebi would be perfect for a porno (read the lore)
---
Terribly wrong.
---
Pengu oscillates between 16:10 and 4:3, but MAJORLY uses 16:10, which is what he's been using for a very long time. He uses 4:3 whenever he feels like it, but his competitive setup is still 16:10. He uses 4:3 primarily when he was to use 1x ONLY or iron sights like Bandit's and Nomad's.
---
He isn't going to shift to 4:3 permanentaly anytime soon.
---
Contact Sony and request a new ID state you have had complaints its encouraging suicide and upsetting people. Will 100% change it
---
I did that in battlefield once. Deagle and all.
---
That was a clean kill, my friend.
---
Professionals, and players who played CSGO are more comfortable with 4:3. 4:3 in CSGO is a very competitive AR.
---
You cannot unsee what you have seen.

r/comdycemetary
---
Yeah i've used that aswell idk how much it matters i just didnt like the fact it was just based off your dpi and you couldnt set your sens to your r6 sens as far as i know, thanks though
---
There are a lot of official gaming forums that keep things clean this way. With the right implementation, this could be incredibly effective. 
---
Player moderators that have the ability to immediately request or issue bans would go a long way to fixing the problem of toxicity. 
---
It's a program that will have some rough edges and it won't always to according to plan, but I think it would be a worthy endeavor for Ubi to create a program that finds and vets player moderators. 
---
Uh... you can't really say that since resident wvil 2 isn't even out yet...
---
Could be in an Australian bundle
---
Thats thrash 
---
Multiple people have said this already but all you have to do is either change your shadow or anti aliasing settings, go back in game, and it should be fixed, and you can change the setting back aswell.
---
He looks like a babushka
---
You must be new here.
---
That's been there for years. Nobody has an issue with it.
---
I actually find the opposite, there are alot of people that voice chat because of needing to be tactical. Is it just rare to hear people talking or is it never, as if it's never your voice chat might be broken. Also ranked people definitely talk more

#**ASCENSION**
---
You do have a point, but that brings up another problem, because that means ranked has been in beta for about 3 years now.
---
Rainbow Six Patriots was going to be just that. 
---
I completely disagree  I got better from playing casual and playing in a competitive mode when your not ready is worse than practicing your aim on people who don‚Äôt care in casual
---
*Mindless Fragger* is what I call those players who plays for kills, don‚Äôt turn this game into a fragging mania. Ive literally seen so many so called solo fraggers that doesnt even know how to callout, use gacgets properly etc. Even diamonds one, theres so many of them to boot. Everyone seems to forget that this is a tactical shooter. When Lion was released almost everyone was so gunghoo about fraggin, rushing, and getting kills. I dunno but, im just sad  that this game is straying from that tactical shooter thing. :(

That's not true at all. It allows realistic scattering and reflections that aren't possible with current technology. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMSuGoYcT3s

It's a technology in it's infancy when it comes to videogames so obviously it's not used to nearly it's current full extent.

Definitely gonna be BB. I haven't unlocked all yet, gonna take my sweet time, but for sure BB.

Cause he's broken. Don't @ me. BB by design, is fundamentally broken. I refuse to play broken ops (don't play lion anymore, have barely 30 minutes on him)

From personal experience: I was plat last season but right now I'm gold 3 because I haven't played much this season so I can assume this holds true for others. The season only works off current mmr and not past... It's very unfortunate for high and low elo players alike 
---
One of best elite skins in the game lol, makes it easy to play him.

His gaming chair is too powerful.

Mw2 wasn‚Äôt as bad. That game didn‚Äôt require as much team coordination and i don‚Äôt remember rampant TKing. People still wanted to win 
---
You added the /s.
---
I'm glad you listened to my feedback. 
---
Is that why siege is under H O R R O R
---
Ah, I see. Unlike the S, the X just has vents along the sides. 
---
I know it's a month after you commented but do you know of there is an end date to buying the pass? I've looked everywhere on the game and can't find it :/

Hello ThrowawayFargoND, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acvcj6/anyone_else_consistently_getting_this_in_a_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
&gt; would be perfect for a porno 
---
*Heh. Hehehehehehe.*
---
Maybe do it like in CS where there are Icon of how the round was won: for example a orange Skull which means the oramge team eliminated all enimies or a blue clock which means the blue team won bc the ither team had no more time
---
The colours contradict the signs though
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
They have a banana as gun. 
---
Jesus calm down bud
---
oh it does bc rn im high gold and i would like to know if i played against plat
---
I mean that isn‚Äôt how sarcasm works
---
why? the orange team won twice on attack and the blue twice on defend
---
She‚Äôs not I just fucking hate her
---
Nailed it. ü§ôüèª
---
A pacemaker? Bc those go near the heart... Not the intestines 
---
same
---
Yeah, you're right. It's a joke about how Ubisoft keep adding strange abilities into the game, totally irrelevant to the game with no connections at all. 
---
Kaid definetly for me elas recoil is just too much with too little damage
---
Wha?
---
I get what you're saying but that should not be the solution to toxicity. 
---
If you bought the game on steam and are trying to get credits through the game it will take you to your steam wallet. You could try to get the credits online through chrome or explorer or whatever you use. That is the only solution I know. I also don‚Äôt think you can get much if you only have $4.
---
AW CHRIST NO! THE NETFLIX ADAPTATION
---
Yeah obviously I'm going to get a lot of downvotes and people telling me I deserve it for having cheated in the past, but beforehand I played for 1-2 years on my PS4 and I really want to be able to play the game legit again  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
The answer still stands, and has stood, for years. Don't solo queue. That's as good as the answers get 
---
What, Orange won attack, blue won defense then orange won attack then blue won defense, so now it‚Äôs blues turn to attack 
---
Yeah giving the possibly most toxic gaming community a vote to punish button seems like a grey idea that wouldn‚Äôt ever get abused
---
I genuinely thought the end of the sentence would be "SHIA LABEOUF!"
---
I wish my mistakes ended this good. 
---
There was blood coming straight from the shield when it got shot
---
Could've atleast had BANDIT as the MVP
---
the actual siege font is scout btw
---
Got a 2 for 1. It's a good trade. 
---
Just because it is part of the game doesn‚Äôt mean it ruins the game.  Run outs after a certain period of time I consider strategic and a good part of the game. But straight out spawn peaks need to be fixed on some maps such as bank.  
---
IMO jackal backstory should be a movie. Brother gets killed in his sleep and now he is a chronic insomniac who has trouble letting people go.
---
That dude shouldn‚Äôt have a gun
---
You can't be in that mindset, you won't improve.
---
I can't personally guide you towards improvement though, that's your decision. 
---
Ask yourself, do you really want to be better at Siege? 
---
/r/R6STeams 
---
Ah, right. I completely forgot about the match time differences.
---
That, and picking spawn points.
---
I see these complaints posted daily, so while I do agree this isnt some revelation of sorts and we will be seeing this dozens of more times before things change
---
I get quite angry when I join a match and BLAM (gets killed by my teammates). Happening more often than I'd like (which is never).
---
Lmao on fortress it‚Äôd just be defense-defense-defense-defense
---
Xbox
---
I love seeing stuff like this, it looks dope.
---
What‚Äôd he say?
---
Now I do...
---
I think the best way to balance Kaid is to take away the TCS‚Äôs ACOG, give it to the AUG, nerf the .44 mag‚Äôs mag size, and give him a third barb wire, maybe one to Bandit as well. (If Bandito isn‚Äôt doing well, especially if he is worse than before)
---
Using your logic, there‚Äôs no reason to have the amounts of wins each team one. Anyone without a chimp Brian can figure out the winning pattern
---
I would also add to Sexual Harassment:
---
I play siege with my girlfriend from college, she usually played on a crappy laptop on 1280 x 720 didn't have a microphone.
---
Her dad got her a pretty good PC and I gave her my previous microphone.
---
She loves siege but 80% of the ranked games we are in would consist of people team killing (In Gold Que fyi) because she spoke. Grown men saying very inappropriate things. We do mute them from voice/text but it still embarrassing for her and I can't even imagine how others have to literally hide there gender online to not be embarrassed.
---
If you are orange and win Atk, you are blue now so that means the team won again
---
Old CS habit?
---
They‚Äôll probably watch some of your game clips to see how you were behaving. 
---
I really need to fix my mindset if I am going to improve
---
You can't hack on Xbox.
---
So I doubt it.

have you never accidentally teamkilled shooting a camera or enemy gadget.
---
I thought we already discussed how flawed ASCUII‚Äôs suggestion is?
---
I am not a native English speaker
---
Yes obviously. Why should someone get punished for that 
---
Orange won atk first then they switch sides onto defense which means blue can't win defense bc they're on atk.
---
I think its glitched it says i am #18 on xbox im not tho
---
Finally someone is with me. I often join ongoing matches about two times in a row.
---
It would probably just be a bunch of crying, being beaten, drinking, joining the army, being beaten, crying, and drinking.

Might as well get rid of kills and deaths too, people can count, right?

It can be a tick and cross

For the meme.

If I could control that gun, everyone can be able to control it

I think u mean... bullying?

I don't get why people talk about camping I mean it's Rainbow six siege not call of duty in this game you hold angles and you have also a drone do find the "camping" defender
---
I actually quite like fortress. The Objectives are balanced the flanking routes are good. But i do think the roof access should be placed differently. The map isn't that big. It's only the rooms that are

Exactly
---
It started as a last gen title and was in development for 3 years.  Then scrapped for Rbs due of the fact it was cheaper to make Siege than reworking things for all platforms of current gen.
---
Or at least that is what was stated in a few articles, and can inferred based on interviews with leads and managers.
---
I think you need a break from video games period my friend.  They are suppose to be fun and if you are only playing them to win and get this upset when you play bad then I think you need to find another outlet for fun for a while. 
---
People are too toxic on this game. It‚Äôs disgusting how nasty some ppl are, I mute erryone :) . Cannot get out of Plat tho!
---
idk what you're talking about but I don't really care you can check in game if you want. Color doesn't change round to round.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they only can and will take action with video evidence sent in via support ticket. I like to think that anyway because I think about how many times that button is pressed every second by people, sometimes not even because people are breaking any rules, and it would be near impossible I would think to differ them. But with video evidence they have it all right there and can take action 
---
I‚Äôm all for all of these, except for turning off ‚Äújoining ongoing matches.‚Äù   
---
Populating half filled matches is a necessary part of matchmaking in a game.  A better fix would be adding a bonus renown/ bonus alpha pack chance for playing on-going games.
---
Shouldn't rascim and sexual harassment be under toxicity?...
---
A book
---
I mean, in a perfect world, that would work. But I doubt thats even possible in the game right now. It def wont ever happen.
---
I already do that, diference is i have to waste half my ammo to open lines of sight, impacts would make a lot of sense. 
---
Are you playing ranked 
---
I would love a Netflix series on the r6 operators with each episode featuring one backstory per character, hell it could even run a few seasons
---
And that too
---
So, first, you assume my race, then used the term "black people" and attach them to criminals. How is that not racist, pea brained idiot?
---
In my country, colour isn't a thing. If you commit a crime, you are jailed. I don't know which country you are from or which country you assume me to be, but pray the country you are in exiles you so they don't have to tolerate your racism, immaturity and cheap behavior.
---
His Nintendo 
---
Honestly yes because the game has been going on sale and stuff recently and bringing in a lot of new players, that are probably like whoa you can team kill? Whoa you can grief? And are probably just abusing the crap out of it because they can
---
I hardly ever see vets playing like that but new players? They don‚Äôt care 
---
No
---
Would prefer the impacts to open lines of sight
---
Hello Bacon-man-5232! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

Then play ranked you‚Äôll play with people your rank

Of course, give the guy who gasses people a shawl. I'm sure that'll go over well with everyone.

Well yeah but you know, don't expect upvotes everyone knows this and this is a super low effort post.
---
IF YOU START ON ORANGE YOUR GOING TO STAY ON ORANGE ATTACK OR DEFENSE
---
Critical thinking isn't your strong suit huh. Why does it take you so long to reply? Not even reply really you don't have a clue what I'm talking about because your colorblind attitude might as well be completely blind. If you wanna be deaf and mute hit me up. 
---
Youre a big guy
---
Blitz is pretty scary so yes, siege belongs in the horror category. 
---
Just voicing my opinion
---
Trust me, they do.
---
Ubisoft can‚Äôt discriminate against those without dedicated servers and further more if you‚Äôre not actually playing competitively in a league, ranked ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Ubi 
---
Again, I said it was unlikely after initial confusion. 
---
The first ban is an IP ban and I think if the system gets another ban (ie you bypassed the IP ban), they HWID Ban. 
---
Anyway obviously you probably shouldn‚Äôt have cheated but hopefully you aren‚Äôt just trying to be able to play again so you can cheat again

Just a crazy stupid idea that I hope won't make it to the game.
---
Oooh thanks i didn‚Äôt know

Oh I see we r arguing the same point sorry, when you said colors don't switch I thought you meant they don't switch with the teams they're on.

This has been a thing on weekendgunnit well before Wind Bastion.

The rule over there is no unused rail spaces, so you fill it with EVERYTHING.

It didn‚Äôt work, if you want to learn maps play thing it‚Äôs easier and you can be slow.
---
Certain maps wouldn't be played probably.
---
There certainly is native support for mouse and keyboard on PS4. Sony sells the Hori Tac Pro for this very purpose. Couch gaming with a mouse and gamepad. Which also means its completely legal to use on that platform. 
---
Personally think this is great, I have the R6Tracker app on my phone but this generally looks cleaner and easier to navigate
---
The big thing for me is adding pick and ban.....fuck man I want this in ranked soooooo badly.  It makes TM's so much better to play.
---
What is it about this game that makes people so toxic? Like I love this game but some times the way people act make me not wanna play. 
---
They'll still have hearts and minds! They'll just be splattered all over the wall

IMO, her recoil only needs adjustment on console. Dunno if its just me, I can control her recoil pretty well on PC, but that could just be me and my high sensitivity plus having experience with the FAMAS in BF3 and BF4. With experience, I can confirm on console that her SMG is extremely terrible.
---
Don't get your hopes up on this,  I'm still waiting for a a chat that doesn't save messages.  
---
We need it for communication with the team.  I know in a perfect world everyone has a microphone but honestly not everyone has one.  It's super annoying when someone doesn't have a mic and they do call outs in chat and it vanishes 5 seconds later. 
---
Lately I've been playing with people who don't have mics/don't use them. 
---
Tl;dr add a chat that stores messages ubi pls

happened to me in a match once

just because i failed to rescue the hostage
---
everyone on my team tk'ed me

iq's face is ugly and valkyrie's haircut just screams "cAn I tALk tO yOuR mAnaGEr???"

Why do some people say it is balanced differently on consoles, and some people say it isn‚Äôt?

Might want to reorder that pattern.

This was taken a while ago, it would be updated to be the same lighting/art style

I'm all for getting rid of racism and sexual harassment, but I fear it can't be done or a least without another ban bot disaster. They should introduce a system to queue with people that speak the same language as you, and a comprehensive commend and report system. The option to forgive or punish should only kill the offending player in casual since that can turn a simple mistake into loss in ranked. Repeating teamkills and injuries during the first seconds of round should warrant suspensions.
---
In game yes. She looks wack as hell. IQ and Valk easily top Dokkaebi though. Easily. Dokkaebi is flat as hell. Looks like a stick insect 
---
because they're noncompetitive

I know its not the individuals idea ofcourse, he made a huge video with his takes on these 5 issues.

Agreed

Gold Valkeryie :p

Where Did You Get Those!   There Dope

She's as thicc as iq and thiccer than valk + she wearing tight pants like iq and she's cute

This is the problem,and youre part of it, everyone says change wont happen because "thats just how online games are" cool and water fountains were just always segregated until people stood up for change(or sat down as it were)
---
Muting doesnt help ingame toxicity and honestly the average age of gamers is probably the oldest its been and we need to start acting it, holding people accountable for their absolute toxic bullshit that they would never do without all this anonymity
---
And I know what the response will be "just get tough skin" but thats a bullshit justification so you can continue to act like an insufferable prick to others
---
no he is not and have u seen the angled grip?
---
Ace" lol my bad i have a stupid LG g7. Doesnt like when i use correct grammar.
---
It's an artist's interpretation.

Grammar failed him when he needed it the most
---
Also not cool to AFK OC 
---
Face palm 
---
I do have a gold Valkyrie just not enough room for her and her normal version :(
---
you landed 1 bullet. i don't get your complaint
---
Just let him TK you and have him take the ban.
---
You were toxic too man. 
---
I mean hereford is set in England and Clash is British so likely, I just hope we get another Canadian operator tbh.
---
He isn‚Äôt acting as an FBI agent though as part of Rainbow. He is specially assigned to the organization.
---
I agree that the fmg is similar to the mp5. That‚Äôs it 
---
I was just being a jealous bitch. It's got to be sledge if I'm honest
---
Yeah its definetly not an easy fix at all... especially toxicity in general thats why this post is so contriversial (think i butched spelling cant spell while walking sorry :P)
---
Also good luck defining what those are for ban purposes. Until very recently people have been banned for saying that they had the Black Ice skins in Spanish, and Pakistani people for replying paki when asked where they were from. 
---
not to be a NERD but r6 technically doesn't use elo
---
detective 
---
I don‚Äôt think any such operators exist I know you can‚Äôt see teammates in your scope but every defending op should be yellow in your scope.
---
And mix gadgets as well (if they dont need the elite skin). I would love to use for example rook elite armor with my customized rook.
---
Wrong special unit.
---
It could be really cool though =[
---
I mean it was working till the latest patch....
---
Yes it makes coordinated teams and tournaments better bc people are all on the same page, pick and ban in ranked will be a clusterfuck
---
Everyone shows up
---
Yea I know that 
---
well now I gotta go try this out
---
Comprehensive report system. Toxicity is too vague and almost meaningless. 
---
Been wondering the same 
---
Whatever imaginary points my rank is based on, i wanna see the change lmao
---
isn't it like no team has won on attack yet
---
Pass those plates around.
---
Can someone please explain to me what the little icon is next to the score? I‚Äôm on console and always try and click on it and nothing ever happens. 
---
May have been teammates 
---
You didn't even pronounce it the same...?
---
I think it's a bug in the newest season
---
notices bulge owo
---
but it says that defense has won? 
---
I guess Hereford was still based in UK just for having a british map for SAS ops and having something from the books. New Kanal could have location changed
---
Ok look, it was a long night but yes, I did mean FSS because I think that we need more Russian characters because we need some more Russian sights on attack and on defense.
---
The only thing about where he is atm I think hes literally the lowest played operator in pro league. (Him or Tachanka pretty sure)
---
For pro league maybe. But otherwise it seems completely pointless
---
Any tips?
---
I like the forgive and punish because it gives more power to victims but it gives even more to toxic players. Why teamkill someone each round when you can get them kicked from the game by running into their breach charges? Teamkilling is a pretty difficult thing to solve.
---
I don‚Äôt buy that. If they don‚Äôt want people to pick recruit, then why have him the roster?
---
It is yeah, it was working fine since i started playing a year ago
---
I dont believe toxic people should win, i dont believe they should be in casual at all, i want the nontoxic people to win, also i like hearing people rage 
---
So you were the tker and him the troll? How did he manage to bait you twice?
---
yea i was also confused about that. Orange wins attack and then blue wins defense doesnt make sense because Blue would be on attack
---
Official Ubisoft store, just remember to choose PS4 as your platform: https://store.ubi.com/us/video-games/recommended/rainbow-six-siege/?lang=en_US
---
It actually does
---
Wow, this is useful never knew that.
---
What's bad about this new map? I liked it a lot more than Villa
---
Fortress is a good map.
---
He tks twice then injures so he doesn't get kicked. They just runs in front of you while you shoot. Usually more then 1 guy doing it.
---
Thank you for understanding why muting isnt enough. The vast majority of men have never experienced firsthand what its like for women in games like Siege and dont understand our options are either keep quiet, or have to put up with the repeated reminder of how women in gaming are treated, and regularly mute people that would've been normal had we stayed quiet. Oh, and then sometimes they'll just TK or other shit if they realize they've been muted.
---
It could just be something simple like an extension of the Article V mission.
---
Cinematics with random ops just chasing down the ecoterrorists responsible for whatever happened.
---
Outbreak showed they can pull that off.
---
If the complaint is size, just make it free DLC that you can download and get rid of.
---
[Same.](http://imgur.com/a/I52IIvH) we think that both teams were getting it on some players and not others. I only saw the issue on the snowy map with Train Museum. When you go to cams it's fine but I included a picture of what my character looks like from cams. I believe that other people spectating you can see from your perspective ok.
---
Nice! I almost went this direction, but decided on [something different....](https://imgur.com/gallery/j9c0HfM)

---
here is the leaderboard with the names on the opposite team
---
thing is that they should punish people how leave a match. 
---
In a game where gathering intel and team play is the "meta" (*but we know that meta is lion dok rush crouch spam and lean spam*)‚Ä¶ leavers shouldn't be able to get another game until the game finishes may be not a ban but as long as the game is ongoing you have to play. 
---
If someone get afking in casual or leave and don't join back he should get banned for not respecting code of conduct.  
---
thing is you can't blame ubi for joining ongoing match we need to do something against people who leave 
---
This isn‚Äôt toxic 
---
Is it really like that in game? Maybe shes just super small or something lol
---
Do you wanna win or be a scapegoat for your friend? 
---
I agree.  I like attacking and defending several of the objectives.  We play bomb exclusively though, maybe its a bad secure map?
---
for us it was on oregon, only our team got it, the enemy team was even teleporting with drones and was running out on us and shizzle
---
I like it on any types of situations either way
---
These are great keep it up!
---
You mean Backwoods?
---
My first ever round of Hostage ended this way.
---
I would like that but you gotta be careful not to make the screen to noisy, I look at some screens in games and gives me a headache at first because there's just so much information there 
---
And ammo count on the hud too just count bullets N00B
---
No, it doesn't. Were your mistakes forgiven? If yes, your statement kinda makes you look like a hypocrite, but regardless of circumstance, it makes you sound like a Dick. 
---
P.S.: i don't condone Cheating, but how would one redeem himself, if not given the chance?
---
No offense but I I can't even see how much elo I've gained i don't think this would work yet.
---
This is an actual game mode? I thought it was a made up thing. 
---
I actually really like fortress but I think some things need to be changed. Like the fact that you can see people through drone holes every game I play on that map someone on my team dies through a drone hole. Also a few OBJ need to be changed, like the one with the big window and only one hissing spot in it and yet you can still see people in it. Also that run out thing on the roof needs to be fixed. 
---
Sennheiser
---
Did you use a 3D model of the X-Kairos to make this? If so did you use the one from thingiverse by any chance?
---
Cheating means you don't deserve to play the game ever again in my opinion
---
Could have muted, but instead teamkill and are no more toxic than the person you killed. 
---
For you.
---
I know it's gonna sound like another "just do this" comment, but you gotta focus your utility on the ext spa balcony walls and the shower walls in the hallway to force ppl out of there. Make a big ass hole in those walls and make them feel uncomfortable in that bathroom. It will flush them out into the bedroom, weight room, hallway or construction, all of which you can hold down from the spa balcony.

we have a full video recording of the clip if someeone would be interested we can put it on dropbox or something like that
---
Machine pistol upgrade. 
---
I 100% agree.  Even if the bug wasn‚Äôt completely intentional, I imagine they‚Äôre in no rush to let people see how unbalanced their matchmaking is again.
---
But I guess ranked still is in beta.... in the fourth year of the game.
---
Fidget spinner movie
---
Where is the video of proof
---
it's Ash, doesn't count imo
---
They are all the same
---
Pretty Radical, don't you think? If op wants to play,  has seen the Error of his ways and remedied them, he at least deserves a chance. 
---
I'm OK with not seeing that during the game but I'd like to know what I went against 
---
Really?
---
How come people say Ash has no hitbox then?
---
Thats a bit of an exaggeration, most of the community is quite nice though the toxic ones do leave an occasional bad taste afterwards. Man people on this sub willing to show you ropes.

Lol I just noticed. I saw this photo at like 3 am so I wasn't fully there
---
What did you mean a death timeline? And when was it removed? I started playing when the Canadians were released and I dont recall that.
---
No, I don't care about cheaters. But everyone their own opinion right.
---
It's a joke people have run into the ground.

So, this has happened to me. A simple solution is to take the save file, copy it as backup and delete it. I think I turned off cloud saves on ubisoft's launcher and then ran the game, changed some attachments on guns, then restored the save file and turned back on cloud, I think. If you need more detail, look up 'r6 siege user profile failed to load' and there should be a better description. I generally get those kinds of issues every few updates, so I just backup the save and put it back, messing with cloud saves along the way.

Hello tdawg2216, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acy3gm/problems_with_r6_thread_post_your_problems_with/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Same as Tachanka being a God?
---
I just did this and the moment the prep phase ended I got headshotted from the other side of the map 
---
Whats rule 34?
---
you know the name of the players that were against you, or did you not take a pic of that?
---
I dont believe toxic people should win, if nobody else reported them for toxic behavior, i'll make sure they get their break
---
the benefit of a reflex is that it increases your sensitivity. if your sensitivity is too low, which many people believe to help with recoil control it can be very difficult to compensate for the first few bullets because you can't pull down fast enough. try upping your sens would be my recommendation. 
---
As of now, people are automatically punished. The punish button would at least give the more mature people who realize that shit happens the ability to forgive. If everybody just hit the punish button, it would be effectively the same system we have right now. It's a step in the right direction.
---
That‚Äôs correct. When it‚Äôs match point, nobody can join or be kicked 
---
What other game did st like this? I‚Äôm not very knowledgeable so I would like to know
---
And make it useless on console.
---
u/ubinoti
---
Its year 4 we dont know when it starts
---
I think the fix would rely on finding out when there's a pattern of toxic behavior, so it doesn't punish players for accidents. This is why "offenses" could be tracked over a number of games, to make sure there's a pattern
---
I really disagree. He's very strong imo. What do you think needs a buff on him?
---
I do this a lot lmao
---
It gets it all
---
You realize this was how the game's loading screens looked at launch, right?
---
Patched.
---
Not yet
---
It would be fixed if it required everyone on the team to vote yes for it, not just all but 1
---
Kill the hostage as fast as possible? What so you mean by that?
---
we deal with this problem in cs with my friend's girlfriend but we will usually verbally attack them and gang up on them in the voice chat if they mess with her. you mess with one of us you mess with all of us
---
I believe I‚Äôm technically correct because of the order the weapons were released.
---
What‚Äôs worse is the .50 in the AR does less than the .50 in the deagle. 
---
10/10
---
It has no so significance, just a carry over from the pc port. 
---
I switched to PC a few months ago. No regrets.   
---
since then i have come across the teleportation cheat once. It was my worst game ever. lol
---
but it's worth it to me.
---
That's the story of Ubisoft tho...
---
They changed the home screen button... that didnt need to be fixed, before they fixed game breaking glitches....
---
Kill cams aren‚Äôt accurate at all. What‚Äôs shown in a kill cam is usually a rough idea of what‚Äôs happening, not an exact recreation.
---
Another idea would be to allow us to chose spawn location and objective rooms in casual
---
We don't even know if they will have a sale at all
---
Would the load times be that bad though? They're being loaded in for the match anyway
---
Good luck it takes several reporting to get someone banned. Better to get them to TK you and get banned. 
---
I'm so confused ATM, what do you guys mean about 0-4 and 4-0. It's 2-2. Both teams won 2 and lost 2
---
::10 years later...::
---
when they say outside sources don't they mean like third party software; I've seen plenty of comments on threads asking for better graphics saying to just go into the game files and change the settings
---
I believe Ubisoft was talking about putting the year 2s on sale for year 4 which would include doke
---
Stop bitching rogue priven it doesnt giveany advantage
---
Not a digital code, would have to deal with shipping and where I live that would be a week.
---
Your drawing? cuz I want to buy
---
I kinda like it. Pretty smooth, with visor reflections and other **DETAILS**
---
Yep, Classic Ubi cares about and prioritizes fresh/new content over quality of play
---
Same. 
---
This is the kinda shit netflix would do though.
---
Her gadget isn‚Äôt underpowered at all, can be used to take out barbed wire, and evil eyes, a ranged soft breacher is a good ability
---
Not to mention shes a 3 speed with one of the best guns in the game 
---
You can change the ini all you want but it likely don't do anything out of ehat you can already do *in game*.
---
Everyone saying "Theres more important things to fix first" either havent been playing very long or are just idiots.
---
"Fixing" minor shit that doesnt really matter in the long run BEFORE fixing game breaking stuff is Ubi's MO...
---
hence, the chat filter was born!
---
Castle is a good op, you just don't know how to use him
---
How about finally fixing the debris when you melee a window or door so you can actually see through it not have the debris in your way. 
---
Do you mean the operation black ice opening screen or the in game skin. I can get you the opening screen if thats what you mean
---
The 9mm pistol deals as much damage as a .50 AR
---
The pistol damage is the odd one out currently, no?
---
Huh gotta check that beams if its really true thats helpfull af
---
Miras vector &lt;3
---
I run out of ammo way to often
---
What platform do you play on? If you play on Xbox, is the guy throwing the game called LigmaMadeMeGay?
---
I just realised that Cav has a blue crowbar but other ops seem to have a red one...?

won't forgive Ubi if they downgrade this like Volcano
---
wdym ‚ÄúOperator Weapon‚Äù? Are there weapons that are none-operator?
---
Not new. I got this skin like 4 months ago
---
Don‚Äôt you dare utter that name again.... DO NOT SUMMON THAT ABOMINATION 
---
Wait what
---
How does one trigger this?
---
Get a drawing pad and some actual software. If you can do that with a mouse and MS paint I'd love to see what you can do with better equipment
---
We neeeeed a punish option this is a great idea!!
---
A troll can already get people banned by getting in the line of fire. That one is hard to tackle. But at least by tracking toxic behavior over a number of matches we can deter the blatant TKs and those who shoot teammates down to 1hp on every match. This is just an idea, I'm definitely open to hear other ones
---
I would love it because i‚Äôd never fucking play Lesion again
---
Yeah I saw that video the other day and it is true. 
---
Of course he‚Äôs a clash main, cats just want to watch the world burn.
---
Yep, we‚Äôve been talking about it a lot for the last few days.
---
People already found a workaround. 
---
I meant it like what‚Äôs your favorite weapon. Thinking about it is should just fix it 
---
So I'm not the only one who noticed!
---
Why the hell does it take so much longer to load into a match in progress? 
---
As if we weren't already disappointed by joining an ongoing match, we also get to deal with a minute of this shit!?
---
lol no that number is simply the 22 ops per side
---
did you just fucking x3 on MY TURF 
---
;)
---
Our team traded at 1v1 3-3 which key to 4-4 but it wasn‚Äôt match point and we kept going back and forth until we won 2 in a row 
---
Ash's g36c
---
We can‚Äôt tell, just for safety
---
While that‚Äôs true I in think the context of my original  correct because of the chronological order of the weapon releases, like I‚Äôve said. If they were released at the same time or the pistol came after, I believe it would be the other way around. 
---
But if we‚Äôre comparing without any context you would be correct. 
---
What exactly are you wanting to stop? All it is is someone crouching and uncrouching rapidly, it doesnt break the game. It's not even that hard to counter, just shoot for crouch head level, they'll crouch into a headshot
---
Razer Kraken Pro V2,i have it and its pretty good
---
Fair point
---
So i know that on a weapon with black ice u can see a black canadian flag thats what i want like only the canadian leaf on top of the blackice background. No opening scene. No "black ice" text. Just that. Do u know what i mean??
---
I can tell you! To get from level 300 to 301 you need to accumulate 141,500XP. Now let‚Äôs say you average 2700XP per match (taking wins and losses into consideration), it would take 53 matches to level up to 301.

Welcome to the club, switched to my Pixel 2xl a little less than a year ago
