Eh, posted because I didn‚Äôt know about it and it was the smallest amount of funny.

ohhh
---
Bro, anyone else see how IQ almost missed those guys? Lucky she had the upper ground
---
Report him. I hate it when the game is ruined, for anyone.
---
Nah it‚Äôs GoodüòÇ At least I can play it
---
At least you don‚Äôt use mouse and keyboard on console! It‚Äôs really getting out of control. They think they‚Äôre so good. People really need to cheat to win. It‚Äôs super sad.
---
Hopefully get the 2 other people not queued with him to take turns TKing him with me
---
Not as op as it was previously before the update but still easy to tap on heads
---
OpFor as Opposing Forces instead of using terrorists vs counter terrorists
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA
---
I didn‚Äôt get anything
---
I don‚Äôt think you are getting them ‚Äúagain‚Äù, It seems like they have added them recently
---
No other drawing tool would make it this good

Oh ok that makes sense lol

Im in the break room of Tims lol'ing at this

Never got one üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
When I see something that says "collaboration with X" I was assuming it was a video montage and not just some text thrown on a white background.
---
Hey it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs no possible way to play keyboards and mouse on console (unlike pc)!
---
Ok, thanks
---
what is that brightness  holy fuck

Truly

When your c4 turns into a proximity mine/claymore

Tastes the same tbh

I agree, most of us have been asking that for a long time

WTF is a Cicada?

As a Mexican I don't know what the hell is that thing.
---
Oh that bag make him look fine
---
Yes
---
Invisibility / sorta intangibility. Pretty sure her body gets stuck at spawn where the claymore is
---
Oh u right didn‚Äôt see that lmao I‚Äôm blind
---
oh huh thx
---
She had a glitch that made her invisible last I heard. That's why claymores are banned. It was part of the glitch
---
The bullet should just disappear for siege because that‚Äôs accurate hit reg.
---
I call this piece "excessive leaning"
---
So they can ban claymores off of everyone Fine but can‚Äôt ban barbed wire off of clash?
---
Bruh moment
---
I mean it's cool but I feel like it would be worth it to budget more time and money for actually improving the game
---
Still one of my favorite jokes in gaming lolol
---
That‚Äôs the experience
---
!remindme 15 hours
---
Two quick questions. Do you play Xbox and is that your profile pic on Xbox?
---
Same hear dude, on the same day as well
---
Last time they just took away claymores
---
10/10 for style, how she gracefully pirouettes into a Kapkan trap.
---
You know, this is kinda cute honestly
---
But realistically only Thatcher uses that pistol (P226?) because he has no choice.

It‚Äôs 12 am and I just shit myself because of this vid, I was really not expecting that

It feels like a bot made this in a different language, than google translated it 100 times, then they just plugged stats into it

I‚Äôve seen Brick Mansions, I think he‚Äôs literally a non speaking thug in it
---
Ah understood
---
For God's sake read the patch notes
---
They‚Äôre working hard to fix something that shouldn‚Äôt be in the game to begin with. It would actually be a good business decision to give us a little bit of renown so we could trust in Ubisoft a little more, the more trust we have in them the more money we‚Äôll spend
---
Halo had a mode for capturing footage and saving it incorporated into the game. Siege doesn't.
---
This happened about 5 minutes ago, and wasn't in any matches prior
---
Oh yes, worst 3 years of my life. Nothing like people literally flicking bagels back at you.
---
It works fine. If you get 3-0d it means you aren't learning from the defeat and you deserve to lose.
---
Hahaha! 
---
At this point I will be surprised if Clash or Deployable Shields will ever return!
---
Seen this several times but Pokemon Trainer watching Squirtle drift away is always hilarious ([0:38](https://youtu.be/OMGY23AleHs?t=37))
---
Ubi give nades!
---
Read the patch notes it's literally the first thread.
---
Nice job but this is shit
---
3 round halfs works fine. This allows more sites to be used and far more variety in those sites, before hand there were so many people who had no idea how to set up anything other then the 2 meta sites. This change forces people to learn more sites, which in turn increases the skill gap. The "they only have to win 1 " argument doesn't work at all, they only have to win one if you don't win at all, and if they 3-0d you there is literally no reason you can't 3-0 them when swapping sides, aside from your team being worse then their team.
---
Dude I swear to my mom, that was a head shot........I fucking hate this game!!!

I mean if you were used to the other monitor, you're going to see differences between that one and the new one. You just have to adjust
---
Read the patch notes or the other five posts about this where I told them to read the patch notes
---
Anyone wanna explain
---
or play M rated competitive games
---
I started laughing when it said your team had a soaring victory when all the defenders died. It's not like it could have been a plummeting loss.  üòÇ
---
Omg read the patch notes
---
I got the one with the jogger headband thing
---
Exactly it's so annoying just scroll down a bit and you'll see y
---
Fair enough, I genuinely just wanted to see any form of reason but if I'm gonna go mad searching fuck it lmao
---
I agree, the way the game is played you can wear a clown skin and It would make little to none difference.
---
Fair enough, I guess there's no point in searching for why
---
Or having an operator people have likely payed for removed for 2 months! It's really sad and they are pretty much acting like nothing is wrong with it. Honestly the community should be much more upset than it is by this. 
---
I honestly feel like Ubi should give something to people who bought Clash to at least acknowledge it.
---
My first was a 1v4 clutch I already had a kill that round
---
If you‚Äôre as good as the other team then you should be able to win 3 times on Defense, it‚Äôs the same thing, as long as your team is better than the other you‚Äôll win
---
Bomb is probably the most game mode in casual right now so I recommend that you just switch bomb off in matchmaking preferences.
---
Enough said
---
You can kick people from ranked matches???
---
Ayyyyyyyyy
---
So you aced on noobs?
---
I miss the shark fins. :\ 
---
Honestly, just give us the purple tarps! We want to stand on them!
---
YEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!, Is one of the best feelings in this game....besides or winning against a salty camper team.
---
No...they used a booter which kills your WiFi
---
Check your matchmaking preferences ( can be found in settings)
---
I just opened ubi club then went back to rainbow
---
Ohh, ouch...
---
Unless you live like right by the servers you probably aren't gonna be able to get 9 ping even with a wired connection
---
He sounds like the average secure main
---
Thanks!
---
"But you proved to be the tougher squad" 
---
*YOU DIED*
---
We get them in Texas as well
---
When they disable my main Gal IQ...damn glitches.
---
I mean, Ubi has always been shit at fixing this game and generally just pretended nothing was wrong for a long time. Though this is honestly ridiculous at this point. Many people paid money for Clash and she has been gone for so long.
---
Well no one really plays hostage too much. You‚Äôre gonna find the most games on bomb and SA. What system are you on?
---
Forget to switch accounts there?
---
Okay. Yeah i think im kinda far from the server cause i always connect to either cus,eus, or scus and i live in Wisconsin
---
I meant Sparrow and Firewall..
---
Clutch it or kick it
---
Hahaha.  Mine was 5880+ üòÇ you have to love bad software counters.
---
Awwww look a canadian
---
I don't consider rainbow a Pinnacle for realism. And I don't see why I ultra advanced hacking system can't fuck with audio files
---
Well I wear the black uniforms and they see me when I can't see them no matter what so it won't change anything.
---
Why i don‚Äôt play anyone with frags.
---
I got the same email yesterday.
---
I don't think anyone could or would blame you.
---
Of course I think they did this on purpose. No one who plays video games is that stupid
---
To elaborate, I have had the achievement to win hostage defense. With so many greefers and resets on the progress for the achievement I never thought this day would happen. Now, with a change from that achievement (that I did btw) to win secure area...I'm in tears 4 years later. 
---
SIEGE THE DAY!!!!!
---
You use a compensator on pistols
---
I'm guessing pc?
---
All you need is a snake and you are set!
---
Do you got a date and platform?
---
What's the IQ glitch?
---
Tell that to Jeff Kaplan.
---
Yeah, just edited thank you, PC and tomorrow
---
Huh nice, the ops I play are banned, deplorable shields are banned...
---
What‚Äôs the point of me playing the game -,-
---
Homie this post in no way correlates to universal experiences, a kid was a dick so I said some smartass shit, relax
---
Damn, I play ps4 sorry
---
FaZe
---
I laughed way to hard at this
---
My teamates in ranked.
---
How about no.
---
Huge RIP for the enemy team.
---
My point exactly... Prine example of why its bad.
---
He wouldn't listen anyway. Especially to a console player.
---
The Luigi strat exists in R6 aswell.
---
Depends. If something is picked 90% of the time it's clearly too useful or wanted. Even if they don't win a higher than normal amount of rounds they still appear to be a higher valued choice over other choices. It's fine for an operator to be simple and common like ash, but I think if you see something more than 50% of the time it's boring. Not to say that you should weaken an op like that, but make other ops more desirable.
---
Also No
---
Yeah
---
I guess it just depends on the person I usually go positive while using DMR but I enjoy being challenged
---
Xbox one
---
That and a grenade denying defender
---
Using it as a factor isn't a bad idea. Actually it's a good idea and does positively effect balance BUT doing it mostly based on pick rates is stupid and will negatively effect balance
---
By chance... Were you in a game with a guy named Prevanish? I know he has been ddosing
---
Maybe they should focus on the game instead
---
I no longer play on console, but Holy shit FINALLY they're playing with response curve.
---
Aiming on Siege PS4 always felt so clunky to me, even for a thumbstick.
---
Mine is just a png of the bronze symbol
---
I'm fucking crying
---
I didn't think about it till now, but I still kill drones as mozzie, then if there are late game drones I get those
---
Pretty sure at least 103 days ago we had the Year 4 Roadmap, which showed the nationality of each operator.
---
Ahhh ok explains a lot, cause I was playing around an hour ago and didn‚Äôt see it since I‚Äôm on PC, they also fixed drop shooting in the patch so that‚Äôs nice
---
Ethical would be sending the vid to the devs only not posting on YouTube
---
It sounds familiar but I can‚Äôt say exactly.
---
yes but nothing else
---
yea but her pistols are ass and her shotgun's built for being an anchor defender not rushing.
---
With the lighting changes and them removing tower even black/dark outfits aren't an issue to see or really give an advantage. Your eye gets trained to silhouettes and you have to just react or you're ded.  They also took out nighttime in ranked on maps that had day or night.   
---
When you look good, you feel good. Wear what you like. They even have bright white outfits and skins available.
---
I try to nab two drones for the prep phase and save 1 pest for info Denial late game
---
We knew she was Danish... that‚Äôs all we needed to know.
---
Every guy with a moustache looks the same.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any drop shooting and hope I don‚Äôt see it in the next seven days. I am a bit annoyed that this bug even exists but even mode annoyed that people are actually abusing it in Casual.
---
Do you have any delicious Tim hortons item hacks that the employees can make?
---
Switch the honey badger and it would be perfect
---
How is this sbubby?
---
Can‚Äôt end the game mid-game.
---
Thats some rick level shit
---
#AAAAAHHHHHHH
---
When they shoot drones caught in Mutes jammer üëå
---
No wonder the service at tims fucking sucks
---
S H U T
---
This is what we need!
---
The game really be like that sometimes.
---
It's not a proper play session if I don't say this at least 6 times.
---
T h i c c
---
That's what i'm saying. Finally, someone gets it.
---
[removed]
---
PC is harder due to what all is possible but I'd say if you can learn it and preform it there you'll be better off
---
Only thing I could suggest is finding some friends
---
Is this a new IQ glitch where IQ hacks the enemy's IQ?
---
Hes better than doc spawnpeeking hes a more viable spawnpeeker than doc and his ability is still semi viable after death unlike doc
---
Prob the system see your friend who hit diomand and match you up with god players and then those lower level kids get carried.
---
Having played both Tf2 and CSGO this is not the case.
---
That was like, a year ago. It shouldn‚Äôt have an effect now, I only said that to show one of my friends is just really good.
---
They will release on the 25th.
---
Would be a hella good if you can coordinate with Nokk
---
I see that all the attackers with breaching charges have been moved form SB 1 (in the initial chart) to SB 2, but Nomad has been mowed to SB 0 even though she has breaching charges.
---
I updooted everybody who commented on this comment. Now you get the updoot for making a response to my bullshittery.
---
r/getdownMrPresident
---
But doc can at least heal himself up if the spawnpeek goes poorly, while if the Echo player gets hurt there's no re-recovery. And if he dies, his drones just become cameras as opposed to having another player use echo and helping deal with monty, or deny a plant
---
Overall I think everyone agrees that if you wanna spawnpeek rook is a better choice than both of them
---
***P E R H A P S***   
---
  
---
idk i never watched the sopranos
---
I mean. Frost and Kaplan still have the best/easiest to use weapons in the game. Their traps are as everyone should know, forgetful traps. When you see either on the defending team, you are careful until that last minute and everything gets crazy and you just forget they have traps. It isn‚Äôt by any means the best thing ever since Frost downs and Kaplan takes 60+ health away and both are countered by using eyes and the other with thatcher. But they *can* be effective.
---
Personally speaking, they have great guns, just not traps that do more than maiming. Still, if I could pick the easy way and get kills over getting frustrated with a really stupid recoil pattern, I‚Äôd play Kap and Frost more than I have with Ela as of late.
---
Oo I got the same kd but mine was on the 13th
---
And you're getting one for giving me a laugh
---
Think there was a glitch with them, you could go invisible or something
---
Cause ubi doesnt know how to fucking fix their shit.
---
It spread to IQ too now? I hadn‚Äôt seen it until today
---
Could be worse, could be sent to Guantanamo Bay or one of the ICE detention centres and be justified since they only detain foreign brown people. /S

Currently 24/24 10% deadzone. With Galaxy kontrol freaks. Once aim acceleration is gone I'll turn that off

Next time try to be original when posting
---
I mean it‚Äôs all just how it works for the person using it. I personally like the Reflex and Holo, I just use the Holo because it looks cooler. Both work equally well for me. But there‚Äôs no reason to criticize someone‚Äôs choice of sight. If it works for them then that‚Äôs all there is to it.
---
when you cheat and still lose lol
---
Pretty sure its in Waco, Texas
---
yes i too remember december 1 2015
---
You dare to challenge lord tachanka?
---
Buck and  Blackbeard for utility and amazing weapons along with nomad for being able to cover my ass Rook and Doc for helping my team and vigil for his amazing roaming capabilities
---
i dont believe it was him the guy im talking about has a more american accent
---
Thanks Peter for explaining the joke
---
Ash because I have the most fin playing her
---
The only time I get good looking kills are when I freak out thinking my teammate is an enemy
---
What exactly does this? We won an easy 3-0 (ended just before the end of the first round) partially because of this.
---
Ela, and whoever on attacking I feel like playing. But I main Ela because she's got a very nice shotgun, everything else is pretty shit about her though. But her shotgun is amazing and can out gun and out range most smgs and even assault rifles. That's until the outdated engine the game runs on stops registering the pellets. But she's also got my favorite character in game and story since she actually is given one that's not all sunshine and rainbows or so outrageously stupid or boring that it just makes no sense. She has struggle, and emotion. Something I like to see when I'm playing a character. Helps you see what they might see. That's a bit too much right?
---
Bingo!!! Site of the branch davidian standoff and ultimately, fire. I always bring capitao along for that.
---
If the sound actually worked this would be cool
---
David Koresh, another crazy man with a following.
---
There is a site calles R6Fix for that, there is no need to post in on YT to gain the revenue and the easy views.
---
That‚Äôs what you get for leaving zofia or doc like this
---
We did end up coming back for the win, however it did take a while to reconnect. Once I reconnected I came back to the middle of the 4-3 round in which we lost. Then I came back fully had a hard time picking operators again but wasnt disconnected thankfully. We were defending downstairs in kitchen. We got  lag switched throughout the prep phase making it so we couldn't do anything. Then when the prep phase was over we quickly barricaded everything we could and held down the bombs no roamers. Being distracted by playing and not cheating they all played like chickens with their heads cut off and died one by one. We ended up winning the game and omg I felt good. I was able to keep my Plat 2.
---
Do you think you know who did the server hitting, I was give names or anything BUT I think its obvious.
---
How about one
---
It's pretty sad how upset you're getting over this.
---
Holy shit are graphics really this bad on console?
---
Not anymore.  Now coppers are 50/50 noobs and gold 3s who are too shit to get any higher so they sandbag to score easy kills.
---
Why do you care about points? I'd call this a pointless idea. ;)
---
smfh
---
you're an ape
---
It would be so easy for companies to make it you can‚Äôt go into a ranked match with people who are not your rank
---
The entire game is random. Even pro team matches are inconsistent, and everyone and there mom is stuck in high gold low plat
---
Ashes Hitbox
---
Fucking true
---
Jfc I started working at Tim's last week. Gonna be here full time for a few months wish me luck. But tbf so far it's been fine, other than my manager telling me to do hours of training at home after working a 9hr shift which in def not doing.
---
That's why I hate him so much.
---
I've been wanting a noise generating op for such a long time

Yeah, that would be nice but there‚Äôs maybe a reason against uniforms that change her actual character model too or something
---
He just need an acog.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know this existed
---
I like the red dot on shotguns and smgs but I really can‚Äôt get into it on anything else. I don‚Äôt really know why
---
What are the odds?
---
Also I've seen opponents often tk each other when there's only 1 op left and they're just thirsty for kills. It's halarious. This is just amazing.
---
You are just trying too hard.
---
Very original
---
Not in ranked in ranked its just pure cancer.
---
Reason I never play without at least 2 other ppls in a squad lol
---
3.6 roentgen, not great not terrible
---
I knew about Clash and It's glitches, but I figured they patched IQ's already
---
Glad I'm not the only one to notice this
---
His filthy penises touching everything he walks on and grabs...
---
4 speed 0 armor operators be like
---
Complains about Kapkan, but wants Year 1 back, do you even play the game?
---
I like the red Dot and hate the Holo for most guns
---
The Chad shotgun alpha vs the virgin rifle beta.
---
Shotguns are great though. People just dont know how to use them half the time.
---
Those guys are idoits
---
I meant year one as in fewer operators not actually just year one operators because some ops like mira actually make some sense.
---
That‚Äôs one op
---
Game literally unplayable
---
No.
---
For the 1000th time, SHE HAD AN AR WHEN IN DEVELOPMENT BUT IT WAS DEEMED TOO POWERFUL
---
Actually i have been trying to stop using acogs so much and i found the red dot to be a good transition as it keeps a similar round shape to that of an acog
---
Sounds like an opinion my guy. Can't force that on people.
---
I think yeah, but  Idk why
---
Just in case she gets her hands on a fully semi-automatic assault rifle
---
Why you gotta block marvies @ like that give the homie the clout he need
---
For the deagle obviously
---
Bruh, I hate to say it but... this might not be the game for you.
---
Who is this
---
bruh üòÇüíØüòÇ
---
I didn‚Äôt get one I have been playing since launch
---
No because this game feels like league of legends or dota 2 not a fucking fps.
---
iq and claymores aren‚Äôt but clash and deployables are
---
Yes you can force everything on everyone if it makes something better.
---
That looks more like a homeless man than nook!
---
Sounds like a rapist but okay.
---
I am
---
she had an assault rifle in her early development that's likely why

The entire premise is to have different tactical operators not to just have a bloodbath. Sounds like you would prefer insurgency or Tarkov or some other meatgrinding fps of a game.

I have had a fun season so far :)
---
oh god haha, I bought a "light" spring for one of my rifles triggers back in the day, I wanted to see how light it was so I put a dummy round in and dropped it from a couple feet onto the rubber of the buttstock, it fired... I was like "uhhh, I think maybe that's a bit too light"
---
Love the feeling of the button press followed by multiple kills
---
Atleast he's honest
---
Warden just needs a new gadget bruh u got glaz who was nerfed into the ground, blitz who's banned in ranked 24/7 and ying who has a kinda lower end pick rate. On top of that just throw a nitro into the smoke/have echo use his drone (the blast basically covers the whole cloud in my experience) and flash bangs already dont work half the time. 
---
Wardens been out over a week and already needs a rework. Cool idea, bad execution.

There was a part were recruit puts a breach charge on a reinforced wall...

The vast majority of R6 players love the variety that Siege provides. Taking away that freedom just makes the game boring. It would still be fun, but not being able to play Cav or Buck would be a waste.
---
Either support or public humiliation. Either or, no in between
---
They didn‚Äôt make enough off Elite Skins and ‚Äúsurprise mechanics‚Äù to pay for a visual rework
---
I do like those games as well but most ops gadgets are just cancer and dont have any tactical value or purpose.

I exclusively run the red dot on the Famas and lesions SMG because i feel that recoil control is more do able it for some reason.

Buck makes sense but cav doesnt not at all, and i dont know i feel like it would be more enjoyable with out aids in every room.

Haha, my friend calls it that all the time and I got into the bad habit of calling it that. My bad!

Well I‚Äôll tell you know for further reference the farthest damage shotgun at range goes 1. Bosg (the double barrel slug shotgun vigil and dokkabei have) 2. Kaids semi slug shotgun 3. The French shotgun while ads
---
Oh fuck your here too?!?! Both in wwz subreddit and r6s?!?! Ffs
---
You can hear those from a different map
---
This is why we pray to Hitreg
---
As a console player I run the red dot on almost all of my weapons. I believe that it is better than an acog on console because you don't have to be super accurate with your stick movements. Kaid's Shotgun for example, I have gotten a lot more kills using a red dot over the acog on his shotgun simply because it's easier to aim with a stick.

How did you download your video? I'm on mobile and it won't let me lol.

Hehe

O ok

You can throw the bullets?
---
? What‚Äôs that
---
Ok got it
---
This game requires a lot of metal focus. So if you get in a grove then leave and come back you might not be in the same mindset. Also the amount of tiredness will effect you. When that happens i usually switch to casual so i won‚Äôt gamble with my rank.
---
Look at the user

I think this belongs in r/shittyrainbowsix

Today.
---
For her friend :D
---
I do like the idea of making it like rook armour, every player needs to take 5 seconds to put it on, and seeing how 5 seconds can be the difference between a win and a loss, I think it‚Äôs great, but maybe not the ability to choose the amount you use, if someone gets downed you could tap it for 1 hp and the person would be revived
---
This is a weird way to flex, but ok.
---
Hope it helps OwO
---
but i had time since i peeked it, i had a few seconds at least til they could‚Äôve been there. and anyways in a 1v5 you have to take some 50/50 risks to win them
---
It does and ok OWO
---
 Same asf
---
Kaids reason to be nerfed
---
gotta use that shotgun
---
Most teams throw 5v1s because because they get thirsty and try and get the run out. Everyone breaks off and goes solo to hunt the last guy which is pretty much the only way the last enemy op has a chance to win. It's fine in casual but I hate it when my team starts dying when they do run outs in ranked games.

---
So this is what they're doing instead of fixing bugs?
---
AR33? Yes that wouldve been a greater choice.
---
Worst attacker fuze, gridlock and glaz. They are highly situational and especially fuze requires the enemy to be kind of bad and gridlocks gadget isn‚Äôt very useful in at least 3/4 of situations. Both of them are the kind of attackers you don‚Äôt want to have on your team most of the time because there is always a better choice. Glaz has been killed by the last patch imo.
---
Underrated attackers would be IQ and capitao. They are both natural enemies of common tactics and annoying operators. IQ can hunt down a vigil when jackal is banned and can see and kill echo and his Yokais when he uses them. She can destroy gadgets through floors and ceilings and is hard counter to kapkan and lesion.
---
Capitao is a good plant supporter, he is fast, his AR is strong his area denial can be used as a counter to an active bandit tricking at walls.
---
Worst defenders would be tachanka and caveira. They are both very useful ops, but only against bad and unaware enemies. The classic tachanka spawnpeek works best on casual only maps and is otherwise his turret works mostly against people who don‚Äôt drone. Caveira works best against people who don‚Äôt save their back and don‚Äôt drone. Imo all ops and tactics that require your enemies making mistakes and being bad at the game are bad.
---
Most underrated defer would be clash, she can be bad if not used in team play but she is a hige pain in the ass when played in a good duo or trio.
---
Same boi
---
You could say the same bout the bosg however you only really get 2 try‚Äôs with it before your dead while the other one it‚Äôs spam fire that‚Äôs why I like it but I don‚Äôt like playing him
---
On Xbox she was banned yesterday evening UTC
---
It's the most annoying when you're playing glaz and theres no fukin way you didnt at least get a neck shot
---
Oh shit, he‚Äôs a Kevin, poor boy must of had it hard

Ok yes thats a fair point but then atleast do a Operation Health 2

they hated him for telling the truth

fps is visible if in the bottom left w/ game info. I have a 240hz monitor and the game is capped at 235, but I probably average 180ish. my ghetto g-sync makes fps irrelevant though (for the most part)

So I went through every sight attachment in the game (again), and gave them a rating. Ratings of each sight are broken down into: Housing, Reticle, Viewing Area, and Total score. If you have any suggestions or I missed a sight, please comment. Hope you it helped you make a decision on a sight. : )

Put the pitchfork down, son.
---
&gt; while having arguably the best defensive weapon
---
er what?
---
You're comparing it to top tier SMGs that aren't aided with top tier secondaries (except kapkan). Cav as a whole can do a lot more.
---
It isn't Cav's weapons that make her underwhelming at higher ranks, it's the nature of her gadget. She relies on the mistakes of solo queuers, something that gets lesser as you climb the ranks. Her counter is a simple drone, and when you add anti-roam utility to that, she's useless.
---
No way

You're beyond human evolution.
---
Acog, option to include angled grip, 30 damage, suppressed with a decent rof and no recoil.
---
This doesn't have anything to do with Ubisoft.
---
You're really trying to say that the mp5sd is one of the best defensive weapons? Actually seriously?
---
Also, I am not totally sure why R6 as attracted so many DDOS's, it could be due to the pure competitiveness of R6 over games like Overwatch or could be something to do with the fact that other games like Overwatch use proprietary game servers whilst I believe Ubisoft hosts on AWS, which could be easier to locate and target, however I am not sure. It's definitely something that needs to be looked into but I don't have any definitive answers.
---
Ps I‚Äôm fairly new to reddit and I just wanted to correct myself *player

I'll work on that

I got absolutely nothing from Ubisoft and I have 3 accounts, I don't get it.

Maestro can't deny a plant, also his LMG is hard for some people to control, as for smoke, he does have a big impact but nobody likes playing him so there is no need to ban him if he isn't being played in the first place :)

Hello zlkexpz-II, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c3ohr3/easy/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That depends on what you call playing. Can I see the screen? Yes. Can I move? No.
---
Battlefield 5 is a mess and its still in a much better state than siege which has been out for 4 years compared to 6 months
---
Nothing, just saying. Also you save up some bullets. He used about 1/3 of the mag to spray him.
---
My friend has gotten canadian pistol black ice twice
---
WAIT so thats why the reason I have good aim in other shooters but not in siege
---
Lmao thats siege for you. I was in a ranked game once for placements on border and was making callouts for my team. They completely ignore me then talk shit to me for being bad after we lose.
---
Happend to me a few times. Game was 2-2 I was like 7 and 3. Got tkd for no reason when I asked him why he said you got quickscoped.
---
I get your point, it's just pretty unlikely (borderline impossible) that someone with her bodytype would be in a elite military unit
---
You do realise that the MPX is a 26 damage 830 RoF SMG, and the FMG-9 is a 30 damage 800 RoF SMG right?
---
FMG-9 is actually pretty much the same if not better than the MPX.
---
Yeah but eventually when you go against players with good placement you will not have time to snap up as they‚Äôll hit the head first
---
but i do all the weekly and daily challenges from the game menu and ubisoft club
---
I only see cap on chalet to counter active bandit in snowmobile and iq is mostly used as a pusher like ash in low to mid plat elo.
---
you know whats the worst,
---
Jackal, he can identifie the 4 different kinds of footprints the defenders leave and can somehow track and identifie them
---
Really fun, Honestly suprised he doesnt get banned more often but lots of fun to play, the Alda is incredibly strong for a defender weapon and he has an excellent gadget to go with it which is really rare for an operator to get both excellent guns and gadget.
---
Classic NA aggressiveness
---
I was kinda the opposite when I had my R6S dream, I'm the weakest link firefight wise on my team so of course my dream was me clutching hard as hell. I was pissed when I woke up and found out it was because my teammate/roommate was playing Seige which triggered the dream xD
---
In my 10 placement games their was only 2 teams I played with that had the mental capacity to plant the defuser instead of the defuse carrier chasing kills.

Happy Birthday!

The thing is that normally it's not THAT BAD. Meaning normally people at least play the game like it is expected to.

This isn't a new complaint but it's very true. While I dont encounter cheaters very often I know they exist in high numbers in this game due to battleye's poor anticheat. The server issue is very apparent. People seem to be connecting to games from what seems like multiple continents away and makes for a bad experience.
---
I mean  in generell. He has so many ways you can play him and use him as an operator he is a good mix of some of the best operators in the game currently .
---
Yeah, I have no idea why casual seems harder than ranked, I also hear more callouts in casual.

Had that today... 5v1 and we were on the 5 side of a 2 entrance room. Instead of, say, two people covering each entrance, they just immediately ran around to find him and he shit on everyone 1 at a time till it was 1v1.
---
...then I just held position and waited for him and won. Like, wtf team?
---
i guess the game crash to some people when going ranked , and i like how you muted the enemy team . less toxicity to worry about
---
I like both of them. Both are fun ops to play with. Strategic wise Nomad is the better choice. You can protect the bomb better after planting.
---
so basically
---
Your phone is a USB drive.

I've been and still am playing on mobile data since the day I bought it(in a different country though). It uses around a 100Mb every hour
---
Yep, also gun shots will help you identify who‚Äôs who
---
Wonder why...
---
He has come far, to think he was introduced in year 1 with the purpose of his shotgun to be more of a killing tool, glad they made it a breach tool pretty quickly.
---
Definitely one of the best DLC ops for sure, you are right.
---
**G-SYNC ON**
---
His MVP animation just doesn't make sense to how it's connected to his Nano Tox, it just feels like an animation meant for a more tech savy op.
---
AcceptÂ∑¶
---
Lol, why are complaining dude? She's a trash operator anyway! Hope they keep her out of the game! /s
---
Don't worry, should only take them another couple of months! Half a year is a reasonable time for her to be gone, right?
---
Whenever I‚Äôm in a 5v1, I‚Äôm the one person who stays on site and holds an angle.
---
Logitech G102 You can get it for about $20-$25
---
Ok thanks for the help
---
Kind of curious...what is strat roulette? And you‚Äôre right...don‚Äôt force stuff on people!
---
Usually, people say Sledge is a good starter. Decent weapons and his gadget is straight forward. It is a hammer that smashes soft/ non reinforced walls. Rook is a good starter defender because you just drop his plates and thats it.
---
To get better, learn the maps and communication. With map knowledge, you know how approach the objective and flanking routes for you or the enemy. Learning maps comes from practicing and playing on them. 
---
Talk with your teammates and ask for feedback. Ask what they need and request what utility you need. For example, you are breaching a hard wall, but it is shocked, ask Thatcher to unshook it for you. The important things are calling out enemies and setting up cross fires and kill angles. Quick callouts save lives or make trades. 
---
Remember, this is a team game. Kills and top score mean nothing if you lose.
---
Looks green to me
---
Lmaoo nsfw
---
Hate to be another but the LMG is hard to beat, especially with that nice new acog. Maybe that‚Äôs why haha

Damn my man really said "üî´üòµüí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üíÄüíÄ"
---
No you go play casual. I want actual pro league. If you want anything less then maybe you‚Äôre the filthy casual?
---
smg definitely. what‚Äôs so good about doc is he has a ACOG sight which is rare on defense. if you get good map knowledge, it‚Äôs possible to juice your self up to about 200 hp and run out of the building the map is in and spawn peek for a kill or two and then run back in. The acog helps a lot.
---
That‚Äôs only in thunt
---
There are always going to be assholes in the world. People seem to find these players ans get kicked all the time, but its happened to me like, twice? And I play solo all the time.
---
So I think you are letting one or two or MAYBE three bad experiences quash the overly majority of the good ones. There is no design system they could implement that I think would make the kick better by restricting it. I am for making it easier to kick, you should only  need 3 as thats the majority. I get griefed by afkers more than some vote kick and Id love to be able to kick them even if theyre in a squad of 2.
---
I know but I never get into a match no matter how long it takes.
---
Do you possibly have instagram where you can DM me more drawings of operators made by you?
---
I'm not a great player either but I found it funny that OP said "I won't practice because I'm not good.".
---
‚ÄúBut now your girl‚Äôs gone missin‚Äô and your house has got an empty bed.‚Äù
---
You have a kind of wallhack so just wallbang
---
If you used the shotgun you would‚Äôve killed the last one no problem
---
Imo instead of all out countering shields with no option for them to do anything about it, tachanka could maybe force monty to drop his shield, shoot out blitzes lights so he can't flash and perhaps do minimal damage (maybe 5hp per shot through shield)
---
This would allow shields to appropriatrly react and push a different way while still having a decent pool of health
---
This is so sad can we get an F in the chat
---
You‚Äôre one of those new breeds who thinks that the only sense of humour that someone can have is your own.
---
Sorry no, I don't have insta anymore and this is the first one
---
There is an automatic system for kicking people who are AFK or who TK (with voting now to identify if TKs are intentional). What you‚Äôre proposing is essentially to get rid of voting to kick. Which is how it is in ranked. 
---
Sometimes people are just annoying or toxic. Being able to kick them is a perk of casual. But maybe Uni should at least disable kicking in the newcomer playlist so that people have a safe refuge from getting kicked for not being very good.

That's fair. We'd have to buff Tachanka's turn radius though. That way he could be countered but only through teamwork.
---
Haven't you heard of using bullets for body armor?
---
Seriously, maybe she had another weapon originally and then they changed her loadout
---
Read the reply to dankine for why I think it counters the mobility problems
---
I think it just means he‚Äôs out of practice, family

We all want complete PL settings but it‚Äôs gonna take ubi a while to take them into ranked

I sent a ticket to Ubisoft support about a week ago. Obviously nothing happened.

This would be awesome! But I‚Äôm assuming there would be a way to tell if it‚Äôs the real sound or not?  Getting that without making it obvious would be a delicate task but would be awesome if it worked. Imagine faking the noise of planting to bait someone in, or breaking down a barricade.
---
I had the exact same issue, everything else was fine, but nobody could hear me. It turned out one of my ports had closed on it's own and reopening it fixed the issue. So you might want to check your portfarwards.
---
It could be a fix for it but I‚Äôm more worried about attackers that have things that can get around the shield like frags nomads Gagets and Zofia and other stuff like that which can get around the shield on a front on attack it would be good but in higher levels of players there always distraction and flanks
---
LLLOOOOYYYDDDD
---
I truly believe Tachanka is s tier in the right hands, but that no one has the chance to learn him because he is so off meta
---
Why are people so bothered and offended by this?
---
Hey guys, watch me clutch.
---
Nice carry.
---
How did you get it?
---
I haven‚Äôt played this game. Can someone tell me if all the (seemingly) unnecessary leaning is normal? You‚Äôre standing out in the open, why lean?
---
Obviously you lagged out. Let‚Äôs talk instead about your key mapping. You‚Äôve got gadgets on keys 2 and 7 on the numpad. I‚Äôm struggling to imagine a layout where that makes any sense.
---
For me it just appeared in my inbox one day, I don‚Äôt know how often it happens or how many people receive it
---
thx bruh apreciate it:)
---
yeah I was a finka main, but Idk why I stopped playing her will try her out once more thx :)
---
MP7, SAS shotgun, M870 and SMG-12 (most if not everyone hates the smg 12 iron sights but i actually love it, i feel a lot more accurate with it, relatively speaking)
---
Lmao yea,im MaryBeHere
---
Honestly i dont remember the game much but i i do remember your user
---
gg brotha
---
Btw i main both buck and nokk XD
---
Along woth zofia
---
No I have not bought the op yet I was going to wait until I got all the responses so I could determine my choice
---
What‚Äôs entry fragging
---
Pretty solid
---
Then i think buck or zofia are your best options. If you already have them then n√∂kk is good.

It does sting a lot!

Idk man, language is messy

God bless the F2

They probably chewed out the last guy even tho he didn't run out.
---
Yeah. I thought I was recording but if the software stops recording when I tab out
---
Yeah not everyone wants to practice a video game. People have lives and shit and don't need to be the highest rank or best player. They enjoy the game, enough said.

You have to turn up the volume. I heard it clear as day on factory iphone earphones

Yep. This is what I do

I was 2 man, and our teammates (the three man) started TKing us at 1-3 losing, I was wondering why then as the doc died, we were ddosed and gained MMR for some reason, was feeling conflicted tbh

Can you explain how the withstand leads to toxicity?

He straight up never said "Im not gonna practice cuz Im not good". He said "yeah I'll never hit plat" which was probably more of a joke than anything serious which you INTERPRET as him seriously saying "yeah I'll never hit plat oh my god Im so bad". Homie plays this game casually and you were a dick to him in your response.

Dont try to patronize people

Zofia is balanced

I have to downvote this ...

Casual? Feelsweirdman
---
‚ÄúDumping kids‚Äù bro your an absolute bot.

I think the angle it gives is a bit too strong, once you're up there you can cut off all rotations from aquarium to hookah if the wall is opened.
---
Had this exact same situation in a game with Twitch. I had to go AFK to answer a phone call and when I came back it was a 1v5. I jokingly told my 2 friends to "sit back and watch me get this easy 1v5" and I fucking got it. It felt so amazing.
---
Hey that's not nice
---
Because he said gurl he's sexist? No, he's just a trash person.
---
It is a very good spot.
---
Nice one. You should replace him with Echo or Jackal. Because they don't play ranked any more.
---
There are some really bad takes on this sub, this ones by far the worst.
---
 *chuckles in sneaky*
---
I got it on that and i started using it. Its not that bad and its literally got 0 recoil
---
Wish I would have saved my clip cause it was beginning of the round and the defenders basically wiped my whole team, and I was last alive as thatcher.  I got one guy with a claymore second one I was firing through a window to be safe and accidently killed him the frost charged me and I got her went towards site killed a guy watching a bad angle get shot to hell by a bandit he retreats to reload and I hide behind what little cover I had and when he peaks again both our aims went to shit but I managed to come out on top
---
I feel like it‚Äôs a bug, on console at least, I play on PS4 and occasionally thermite explosion will be silent, even breach charges I place down or enemies place down will blow up silently, hasn‚Äôt happened extremely often but when it does it‚Äôs extremely disorienting and annoying

I just love peeking around a room that I‚Äôm in a little more only to find out that an entire wall is open out of nowhere. Or to get killed from a hatch I‚Äôm underneath bc I had no idea it got opened
---
How about we just give him a new gun? Yknow probably one that‚Äôs good cause we all know the peashooter is just a terrible gun
---
No they wouldnt. They could just code wardens mpx to be unique from valks and give it whatever attatchments they want without affecting valk. The game would recognize both mpxs as different guns but to us they would be the same.
---
Yeah one time it was a 1v5 and I just stayed outside for 2 mins and I killed 4 spawnpeekers or people that ran out. Then it was a 1v1 and I won.
---
and me opening 1000 packs and not getting it
---
I was thinking about a wind-up of 1 sec, and now I think i could buff the uses up to 6.
---
Yea, I‚Äôm usually on drones in defense so I know when it‚Äôs getting opened and I make callouts accordingly, but I can see how annoying it can be in solo q
---
Disagree strongly.  If you balance only around the top players, you eventually end up making the game less enjoyable to average players.  And they decide to go play something else.
---
I'm not saying that you balance the game for average players either, just that since the experience is very different at different skill levels you have to consider a variety of skill levels in your balancing.
---
just buy on instant-gaming, cheaper and no problems
---
Yeah that's a shout
---
You gotta pre-aim higher bud
---
I got an Astro A40 Tournament series headset as a gift, and it is among the best quality audio that I have heard. The mic is first rate, detachable, and swappable. The mixer is super helpful, especially in games like siege where the explosions can overwhelm the ability to hear call outs. Pro players use high end Astros pretty regularly.
---
They're gaming though, so they may not be up to your standards.
---
Your first catch of the day?
---
No any new coding would glitch the game to where warden has infinite ammo or some shit because Ubi. They shouldn't tinker with anything right now
---
Its useless its on Ash
---
We enforce murder all the time everywhere in the world. 
---
Just because some people get away with it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not enforced as a rule. 
---
Ubi literally cannot enforce their rule because they cannot prove people to be doing it. Therefor, should make it easier for everyone to use a MnK. 
---
This game requires a headset to actually do good. PS4s come with a controller and a mic, but no headset. Ubi therefor makes people buy headsets to play at a competitive level. It wouldn‚Äôt be a issue if they allowed people to use MnK. 
---
If you can‚Äôt enforce it, you should just allow it
---
I would love one for the mp5 goddamn..

These were my tanks except in bronze and silver :(

---
You clearly are an idiot then. Seriously now fuck off you are seriously pissibg me off.
---
Wtf? It would be no different from adding a new gun in the game. You obviously have no clue how any of this works
---
They say recruit is at a disadvantage without any special ability, and with only one reinforcement. Take this video for example: no one else gets frags AND smoke grenades. Or 2 types of any grenade. Plus the german shotgun shouldnt be on attack, no attacking operator uses it. Recruit isn't at any disadvantage frankly.. and thats the problem with him. Maybe when the game first came out he made sense but he is far too powerful with his loadouts now. And new players wont use him if they have other ops to practice with. It makes 0.00% sense to have a character choice like that in a game like siege.
---
Sorry i can complain about it all day, recruit has never made sense to me. But ive only played for a year and a half.
---
That's awesome. Never knew it was based on a real location. The more you know!
---
How ever many I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Yes we need recruit
---
As an attacker I hate you and hope you had a horrible birthday day. As a defender I hope you had an amazing birthday lol
---
I always try to predict where people are to get wall bangs. They more you play, the more you know the common spots. Also people are creatures of habit. So if I‚Äôm one round someone spawnpeeks one round and it‚Äôs successful then the next round they might do that same spawnpeek again.

Yeah it's probably not that easy or they would have fixed it

I have shot through Tachanka‚Äôs turret shield, killed Tachanka, and the shield was perfect fine. Also I could write you a book on the amount of bullshit deaths I‚Äôve seen Monty players go thru.

I just went up against 3 gold's and two unranked. And we had a silver a bronze, and 3 unranked

For fuck sake, not only did I answer like 3 comments ago because you where crying I didn't when I have mutiple times. Go read it back again and find out.

Again keep wasting your time..

I play as a gold but got ranked a silver 1, my team deranked me to Bronze 2 pretty much

I‚Äôm now realizing this but what if his saliva is poison and the toothpicks he always has in his mouth are actually the gu needles and that‚Äôs why he has a bunch of gu‚Äôs he just brings a pack of tooth picks to battle

---
Unranks make it tricky. These guys were all together and since 3 of them were ‚ÄúCoppers‚Äù they matched against silvers and bronzes
---
I play like a gold, get placed in gold normally, but this season I either got unlucky or nobody knows how to play ranked because I was top fragging almost all 10 games along side my duo queue
---
No its not , CS:Go and dota does it.  
---
The code is open source : https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets  
---
All Ubi has to do is set up their own relays but with no money for servers as is thats gonna be hard.
---
The server's should crash safer though to be fair. They can't stop DDoS from happening, but they can stop it from affecting the game as significantly by tracking those who benefit from the DDoS (i.e. which team is losing at the time) and banning people who clearly are involved like that and dishing out MMR for people who are the victims of this.
---
I see lesion and ecjo a lot but not nomad and thatcher

That doesn't quite help me but ok

I can pretty much only solo queue aswell as I barely have time to play and play at stupid times, but when I do play it's just cancer.

Ok why is nokk bad?

Know what to do, make a post saying why you believe why k&amp;m should be aloud on console and see how manny fucking people agree with you, since you believe that it's the best thing for the game...

Only answer this question

If a rule can‚Äôt be enforced, is it a stupid rule?

Why or why not?

(Your murder rule is wrong because around the globe it‚Äôs enforced all the time)
---
It‚Äôs not that easy to add server migration?? Cod mw2 had it lol

I did. 3 people agreed 2 people disagreed. Deleted it after 24 hours because no one else was commenting on it.

So the other reasons are irrelivent also...

I‚Äôm not wrong; but tell yourselves whatever you want. You people are the exact reason why everyone hates reddit

Ok so he has value against one rarely picked operator, yay

He's still weaker than every other defender in terms of utility and fragging
---
Jackal

Get some too, im talking about the big icon on top of the ennemy, cmon gimme downvotes
---
Led zeppelin is pretty great
---
It's ridiculous. Siege makes ubi so much money. They should be willing to invest in it
---
She's just situational
---
Cmon Ubi! Just ‚úì fix ddos ez!
---
Jeez that's nice...
---
tl;dr This game is in terrible shape right now and I quit playing because Ubisoft doesn't do anything or doesn't know how to fix it.
---
That's why I stopped playign this game in the middle of the Burnt Horizon. Technical state of this game was mediocre since release, but right know it's worse than some Early Access games (and as we know, technical state in most of them is pretty bad). Somewhere between BH and the new season Ubisoft said that 3 most popular glitches (invisible IQ, Clash with shooting shield and operators with deployable shields on the head) won't be possible to make in Phantom Sight. One day after PS launch, deployable shield bug appeared again. Few days later bug with Clash was also discovered. Few days ago glitch with IQ also returned. Problem with ddos'ing is quite old, especially on consoles, but it's also possible on PC and it has gotten worse this season. I quickly realized that this game's problem is similar to problems of some bad mmo-shooters (like these CS copies and so on) and I don't (and I'm 100% it's not only me) feel satisfaction of playing this game anymore. Do whatever you want with my opinion, but I'm talking about what I'm seeing. Good game turned into trash because Ubisoft doesn't know how to fix it or doesn't want to fix it.
---
*Tryhards squeezing at Red Doot + suppressor*
---
Personally I think N√∏kk would be a better choice
---
Why did you remove the ping?
---
Do you not see clash on attack?
---
It's blurred just for the anonymity
---
Lmao that‚Äôs what I thought
---
3 defenders banned 1 attacker
---
I dont know if this is a positive or negative comment lol
---
i chose the galaxy ones, concave
---
I get that, but its mostly not about the kill denial but the fact that in a different situation it could've fucked him over. It's about the fact that the debris doesn't work
---
Keep up the good work.
---
‚ÄúWhat do you mean you‚Äôre out of acogs? I want to see your manager!‚Äù
---
I mean with that attitude you ain't exactly promoting any real incentive for replies.
---
At any rate, Ash's hitbox isn't busted, it's just that every player that goes for speed and kills happens to main Ash, and having mastered the art of Sonic the Hedgehog speed mechanics they simply move about with every form of movement the game allows, sprinting crouching, leaning,...etc. 
---
An unholy combination of spastic movements that are relatively hard to adjust for when aiming causes the person on the receiving end to think that they should have hit, when in fact it's very much likely to be a miss, ass to that that hotboxes aren't as big as utility rigs and helmets and what have you and plenty of grazed shots will give impression of hitting while dealing no damage as there was no hitbox on bullet trajectory.
---
While it has been brought up that one shot headshots may be worth looking into, there is currently no real say if any change is planned, the more reasonable suggestions where to have guns like DMRs still be able to do so and have other gun types work with damage multipliers, which overall would make headshots a 2 or 3 shot depending on the gun's RoF.
---
While we may be really far away from any kind of implementation of the sort, we did get a slight change for the better in this regard with this season's wall penetration, now bullets will be fully absorbed by the third layer they go through so you can only really get a headshot through one wall at most.
---
Lesion all the way
---
now i'm sad cause i didnt got an email :c
---
Do you know if there is any arabic text/quotes on the map? As far as I know there is no arabic shown on the map.
---
I obviously know it's working as intended. I'm saying that's it's a game flaw. Not until they completely fix every hitbox and make it consistently the same there shouldn't be one shot hs. Maybe from higher caliber rifles sure but a pistol from across map should not 1 tap you. It's not a dumb question. Thousands of people share this same point with me. I've seen it time and time again. I asked for a civil discussion and people are too childish to even have a fathomably civil response. Roaches
---
I mean if a 70 yr old that was in any special ops unit for like 20 yrs or so came to a private military group and could shoot and move like he's 30 I'm sure they'd use him for something.
---
Because Ubisoft. It's always been that way
---
Lesion all the way my god his gadget is godly and his guns are too
---
Theme park good, I agree. Skyscraper bad. New hereford good. IQ lmg good.
---
Vigil‚Äôs K1A does no damage with me basically.
---
Lesion by many everything's
---
How do you get the operator main for you name?
---
Why did you censor the ping? It's not exactly private information.
---
I believe you should buy lesion, cause he can stay in the obj and has a really nice weapon

Hello starvingbug, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c3tgn7/i_think_there_should_be_a_rotation_of_game_modes/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I wonder if what I‚Äôve experienced is a result of people doing this in other matches? At random times during some of my rounds, everyone on my team starts rubber-banding and nobody can seem to really do anything effectively. Sometimes I‚Äôll be trying to bandit trick, and I‚Äôll just get stuck trying to place down the battery and die from the charge. Other times Thermite‚Äôs charges just don‚Äôt do anything until everything stabilizes.
---
It‚Äôs not as bad as what you‚Äôve shown here, because I can still somewhat move, but a lot of time will still be wasted trying to cover ground on the attack and some things just won‚Äôt work. Really curious to know if people doing this in other games resulted in my games being affected in a less severe way.
---
I like lesion he has a pretty good smg and his gu mines can get you some assists. The only downside is that he only gets 2 for prep fase.
---
that song makes everything better
---
Right! I‚Äôm surprised the n√∏kk didn‚Äôt take my head off
---
Red dot and compansator. It's less horizontal recoil when strafeing. Also stop spraying after the first 20 shots because it becomes borderline unusable.
---
It happens
---
Maybe contact ubisoft support?
---
What attitude? I only had an attitude when two people were jerks for no reason. And no. No no no no. Her hotbox is still broken. Countless others say the same thing. I have numerous videos of me shooting her with blood being drawn and then she apparently never got hit? Okay
---
This is exactly why you've got to blame Ubi/game. Because of those micro-moments, which you can either explain with dozens of guesses, or you just can't tell for sure. It's all about Siege ‚Äî you can't tell for sure about anything what happens. You even can't tell if you're playing with hackerman, since all shit is possible in here. And you just can't deny that Siege has always had problems with hitreg and hitboxes, which eventually became a squirrel eye to match up with, so you can never tell what went wrong. This is why everyone understand the difficulties Ubisoft faces with Assassin's Creed engine implemented within an online fps. It just doesn't work as good as it should be, but we, players, are used to it and love it as it is. Micro-moments aren't a good thing to bear with, honestly. Never had communities of Quake, CoD, BF, Titanfall, etc.etc suffered of such problems. A bit of simplicity, that's what Siege/engine lack of, honestly.
---

No shit. I just dont understand why I go from 700 to 100

---
L85A2 was my first black ice and it came off a 2% chance to hit
---
When you increase your turn speed, WHOOOOOOOOO-
---
Don't trust killcam health bars blindly, at times they fail to show up updated with the real health value, also "countless say the same thing" isn't really proof of anything, many people said Lion was fine before his nerfs and that Blackbeard is weak, if Ash's hitbox truly was that badly fucked we'd have had concrete proof already all over youtube with custom game tests to discern where Ash's hitbox doesn't work blatantly, if it's a latency issue that causes a desync that's an entirely different matter overall.
---
Also as much as you may dislike some people's replies you deem as "Cancer", replying back about them in just as negative a manner doesn't really help pass your point across, fire with fire is a self destructing spiral of doom.

Man that sucks to hear, I've been playing this game for a while and I feel like it used to be less toxic- in casual at least. I've noticed once a game has been out for a while the players that have been playing it non-stop seem to grow bored or something and begin to troll others. Look at Overwatch. What I don't understand is why people like that don't just take a break? Nobody is forcing you to play the game. 
---
I hope you're exposed to the more positive side of siege more, it really is an amazing game and I think you too will come to love it at some point.

I like how you almost murdered Mira when you went in to tea
---
You ask for civil discussion and then decide it's not worth it? Odd change of mind. At any rate, if her hitbox was truly fucked we'd see Pros talk about it as much as they talk about other issues in balancing and the like, so far Ash's hitbox hasn't been one of them and to be fair it's just a long never ending meme at this point that "she has no hitbox", again it's based on people using speed and movements to their advantage and they could do that with any other 3 speed attacker, it just so happens that Ash still is the go to choice because of her guns.
---
umm Frost.exe not found
---
No. It‚Äôs a crux of the gameplay.
---
Hey can I just say that I love this and you‚Äôre amazing
---
He‚Äôs the one who wrote it he could make a new one if he messed up
---
this guy just gave a legitamate and good argument  and you being stubborn can‚Äôt even take it and just repeat what you‚Äôve been saying. If you won‚Äôt take another answer for the question you‚Äôve asked than why even make it a discusi√≥n.and what do you mean what attitude all you did in this response is show the exact attitude he was taking about.
---
A glitch idk what it is but it‚Äôs apparently game breaking
---
Right back atcha
---
Invincibility glitch cowboy
---
Almost being the key word
---
You‚Äôre being a prick dude.
---
Thanks !
---
So I'm basically being punished for not playing for a few seasons? Fantastic, really.
---
How about 5 uses the the shield is broken similar to sledge better balance the use of an auto weapon on a shield?
---
Its Commissioner Gordon!!!
---
Hey ubi, can we get our boy recruit back in ranked?
---
Thatcher is samurai boi
---
No seriously how when others were doing it first? Why does everyone gang up on the person who posts almost always on Reddit? This site is the real cancer.
---
thats some elon musk shit right here
---
4 recruits and a finka juicing them up.
---
Yeah, when I got it it was like 0.8%... Sad
---
WiFi isn‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs a perspective glitch
---
Wow fuck them for trying to make games easier to run so more people can play them
---
I'm Level 70 and I have no Black Ice :(
---
Oof
---
I don‚Äôt think I have seen so much retardation from anyone in any game (I‚Äôm talking about the ddoser)
---
Teach me
---
Because it‚Äôs easy as shit to render a menu at 700fps. Rendering an actual game at that is a different story. 
---
Are you trolling?
---
Yes, I just hope I get it one day.
---
I have only 4 although I‚Äôd choose legendary over black ice any day (level 127)
---
I hope it too man, I got Black Ice for J√§ger and Bandit after 600+ hrs lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure ‚Äúretardation‚Äù sums this video up good lol
---
No glorious smoke, no kapkan, whats wrong with you?
---
What's the future like besides being filled with hacks?
---
It was first as well, it seems that the lower chance of alpha pack you get but still manage to get one it will be more rare

It‚Äôs fucking dumb. My house hit a power surge and I lost connection and I got an abandon sanction. They really need to update this for unintentional disconnects.
---
I like Maestro for placing the cams in good spots and only using them to pop stuff like Fuze charges, Thermite charges, and Hibanna pellets.
---
The problem arose when I tried to run Ark Survival Evolved, another game that runs battleye. Also, since I bought the game on steam it cant run without it.
---
Ash is not used because of a "broken hitbox" she's used because she is probably the best entry fragger available in most situations because of her speed and weapons
---
Alright, didn't know about about "/s".
---
A bit confusing, because some people really take some month to realize what they unboxed.
---
If youre like to hold angles the go with black beard, nomad or gridlock

Hey don't flame the guy... My first season I was copper 4 now I'm mid plat

Have you read anything? Before this broken patch dropped, everything was fine. Now it not. 
---
It‚Äôs negative but not towards you.

Hold up, when did kaid get a nitro cell???
---
*uh oh*
---
I didn't ask but I should have!
---
Just spam equip and unequip on the same attachment,it doesn't need to be 50 different attachments. I got it in about a minute of doing that
---
I've done it seasons before, it's just the sheer fact of 4v5's, boosters, shit teammates, I haven't seen 2 wins in a row in a while
---
nah he was through the next wall
---
Jackal is overpowered. I don't care about his win rate, he brings way too much to the team in roamer clearing. Same goes for Dokkaebi, but at least in her case you can't pinpoint someone's location or track them from across the map for half of the round.
---
Pussy
---
Yeah as some on that plays on PC. This person is not on MnK

2 black ices at level 85? RNG is strong with this one

It's not going to look like pc. It's an emulator so it looks like an insanely fast controller. He admitted to it.

I hate that jaeger is useless in this scenario!

Don't skip the killcams

When i first started playing this game one of my first alpha packs was a black ice mp5 lol

He admitted to it. Watch how jittery the aim is.

When they first introduced the packs I always got up to like 70% chance before getting one, maybe they're just paying me back for that
---
I know what you mean. It's been inconsistent with me but that's rarely
---
They just took away his barbed wire and replaced it with the nitro. Which was pretty lame
---
Imo in no particular order..
---
Mute, Castle, Jager, Doc and Echo
---
I haven‚Äôt played him in a while, I was confusedüòÇ
---
Hahaha just realised! My gf hates it because on the back it says "let's get lost" and sounds like a 15 year old girl IG quote.
---
They said they are working on it. Don't know when we will get it though. That is, if we even get it. Ubisoft can't even deal with bugs and glitches right now.
---
Your counterpoint is ‚Äúit‚Äôs not nazi propaganda because it‚Äôs effective nazi propaganda?‚Äù Compelling!
---
Not that jittery. Even if he was, you didn‚Äôt lose the gunfight because of mnk
---
Most likely because you aren't the brightest

Yes I got turned on... but did I not hit N√∏√∏k in the head the first time

Still helps him perfectly hit his shot on me. It shouldn't happen anyway even if that is the reason I died. If you played console it's easy to tell he's using mnk

What do a sniper and artist have in common?
---
Sounded like he was closer, but I'll take your word for it
---
#really big fucking hole coming right up
---
Mute, Echo, Bandit/Kaid, Mira, Pulse
---
Valk. Frost. Cav. Echo. Lesion.
---
By saying seems right.i meant like the stats were fine, not like my accuracy is that good lol
---
Nah nothing blatant here. You just want an excuse
---
Is not someone better than the castle? (Only my opinion)
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 as well, and I‚Äôve definitely noticed the toxicity in game has gone up. Just the other day I was playing a game of ranked and most of my team disconnected and it was just me left. Some of the enemy team sent me messages stating I was a piece of shit, trash at the game, and I should uninstall. I‚Äôve been playing the game for a couple years now and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty good at it, a steady gold 1. This has never happened before and it‚Äôs such a turn off for this game I‚Äôve come to enjoy and share with my friends. I hope there will be something that can be done about the TKing and toxic chat.
---
Ooo I want it big
---
Look when he kills my teammate then jumps in it's obvious. I said he admitted to it tf.
---
*thunk**thunk*thunk*thunk*
---
HOSTAGE HAS BEEN KILLED
---
get close, ADS if you‚Äôre a bit farther, pull trigger, watch em fly
---
It was a casual match
---
Hey cmon that's me :(
---
3 and half but the first alpha was more than 4 years ago.
---
Yes he kills your teammate (with mild potato aim might I add!) and then he hops in, sees you, and shoots. You telling me he said so isn‚Äôt proof.
---
My counterpoint has nothing to do with any political viewpoints.
---
I'm just stating the obvious : if you don't want to promote someone, you need to not talk about them, even if it was to give them bad press
---
As I said, this is the [Streisand effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)

&gt; The¬†Streisand effect¬†is a phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely
---
**Streisand effect**
---
The Streisand effect is a phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

Wow there magic man.
---
The original reasoning for adding the yellow outline was to make him more viable by allowing easy target acquiring and response times. The issue is that the avg kill distance is about 9 meters; most encounters will be at close range. This makes him too useful at all ranges especially with smokes. Without his highlight, it becomes a below average dmr with an acog. I believe Rogue 9 showed this in his spreadsheet on all the analysis of all the weapons. While it has highr per shot damage, the much lower fire rate gives it a much lower kill time.
---
Due to this, Without the highlight, his rifle without the outline is inferior in most aspects to some random guy with a dmr acog. Not good since Glaz is an entire operator centered around his rifle.
---
It's jittery asf do you have eyes?

mnk players suck

Oh, yeah he was flying and teleporting through walls the entire game lol....
---
too many cheaters in the past week...
---
That's when the cool ideas come xD

This happens with all weapons. When servers start shotting themselves, reloads don't register, hit reg is ass, and it's really broken altogether.
---
I wish there was a way to report people who are using a mouse and keyboard on console
---
Omg thank you so much, I was so concerned that I might be heading to Uranus instead or even Pluto, I kind of impressed that you did work it out yet at the same time slightly worried
---
I know but as long as the joke makes sense I‚Äôm fine with it. A lot of people call her ‚Äúknock‚Äù same as many people call Kaid ‚Äúcay-d‚Äù

Haha thanks

Ubisoft pay MS to rent the servers.

Seriously tho  the last half decent spetznaz is dead lol

That's from pluto

YOU GOT FUCKED. You can see him kinda glitch but he shoulda been dead

Oh yeah don't ask what I was even doing because I have no fucking clue lmao
---
Uh... I think finka is fine where she is.
---
Yes, i know thats what i've been saying .   
---
What do you think Valve has their own everywhere , they too pay others to rent the servers.

Game servers use UDP packets there's no traditional way to prevent attacks on that.

Why would Microsoft do all the legwork .

I think she‚Äôs fine too just not that fun and not that useful

Well that sucks
---
I just got this achievement today, this is my first victory since the start of the season  
---
So either that achievement was already here and i somehow didn't unlock it in over 3 years, or they just added it, but they removed Secure Area from ranked
---
And the OG Hereford can be found in the first situation.

He‚Äôs just hitting a wall I don‚Äôt se-HOLY SHI

I‚Äôve got a friend who takes heads with it all the time but it just feels like it shoots nerf darts

MPX is a pretty great headshot machine in my opinion

gold has its own separate hidden MMR system, rank is not taken into account

thank you, comrade

Rkooooo.. outta nowhere üòÅü§£üòÇ
---
this is also not correct.
---
Okay I‚Äôm impressed
---
Np
---
My placements seemed easier than normal then it got real sweaty. I placed gold 1, won 2 more games and was a win away from plat, and now I‚Äôm back to gold 3 :) I‚Äôm not mad ur mad
---
i mean i think that is still missing the point. any other person with smokes and a dmr can do that better then him then.  [Dokkaebi](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Dokkaebi)  can do that job then
---
Hey, I've seen a lot of pics from that screen. I dont know if im just stupid or what but I can't find that in my client. Where do you go to see stats, ranks etc like that?
---
Me with any shotgun in any game
---
Thank you. In nearly every video I saw it was either the guys fault or the guy who played ash got a high ping, or somethin similiar. Don‚Äòt know why they all scream she needs a nerf. Probably just screaming what others are screaming to get some attention.
---
Ranked or cas
---
R/whoosh
---
O no
---
How do you can "Fuze" Main to "War Crime Main"?
---
Don't use the p10 Roni
---
Yes that's a latency issue, your client didn't receive all packets at once and when the info reached your game she had shot you for plenty of rounds that equate to a "Superbullet" from your perspective.

I always vote ban him

What do a artist and a sniper have in common

I wouldn‚Äôt call it stealing, I would call it bettering humanity as a whole. If anyone can edit this I would love that.

This makes me think of the alien from the alien franchise
---
Literally
---
What language u speaking
---
I object
---
Yeah I was like, why is the other team not banning and I'm the only one on my team that's voting, so confused... I also got that fat 15 minute ban from disconnecting.
