They nerfed sheild ads time
---
Ah, okay. Thanks!
---
Do you always go this far to try and prove people wrong?
---
Oh, cool.
---
I thought this was a rando pretending to be Two Mad until I saw the username
---
Wow stalker much? Look, I may not be a high rank on console but I can see where Ela is balanced. Her recoil does need tweaked a bit for the Smg but if they don’t do that then her shotgun is the only option. She is hardly played as is so asking for her to be nerfed is ridiculous.
---
It took me less than thirty seconds to have anything to do with this
---
Depends on what style, how much shading, background detail, full model or waist up, how many characters.  Pm me and I'll see
---
Yes tf2
---
K ANAL!!!!
---
So?
---
Bruh
---
this needs MORE UPVOTES
---
I agree. Would you do it to a jäger ads? Or a bandit battery?
---
## bruh 💯😫🤙😎😎
---
The playable characters in Titanfall (from which this HUD is) are referred to as Pilots (as they pilot Titans).
---
Should i call you Caitlin now?
---
No. No one should. They’re just being toxic assholes.

---
It’s worse in ranked when it happens
---
That's a drone, silly. You're supposed to run at it with Ash. A drone doesn't have enough speed.
---
Nipples hard as diamonds got me good haha.
---
Ok nevermind,I'll take broken headshots
---
😂
---
Thats why i don’t play ranked. People pull your ip if you lose against 5 people even tho they died first
---
So I didn’t go far at all to prove someone wrong
---
I'm pretty sure it explains a couple of the gadgets (Like the heartbeat sensor for example).
---
Wait that shit genuinely happens on pc.
---
You did. Anyway I’m bored of this bye
---
The limited event stuff is different from the legendaries though. Those are actually limited and I admittedly will drop $10 on packs if I really like em. 
---

---
I think Ubi has found a really nice soft spot with their boxes. If were forced to have them, I'd prefer their current system vs EA/others
---
No point tking, just incentives people to carry on.
---
You tell me
---
Ubisoft, please patch this. #1 issue with the game right now
---
Same. I'd take Bartlett every game over having to play Yacht or Tower.
---
The sensor idea is loosely based on the one from the book, but technically not tge same.
---
My last two legendaries were the same shitty charm
---
Too bad it's so underplayed :(
---
Every thing tom clancy takes the divison background and then takes the siege logo and flips it and copies and paste the siege art work no effort there I am pretty sure it is just a staff in the company that is a ubisoft fan.
---
It could also be a custom game. But I agree, it’s certainly not casual

Wait, what?! Why?! Oregon is one of the best maps, not just competitively but just for fun! What the fuck?!
---
but its not t hunt so im guessing its a glitch
---
Same. Got my whole group saying it.
---
Then tk them, ez
---
Wow I dident know someone reached champion rank already.
---
Raid Leader for Mira leaked months before it came out, I saved up renown, I bought credits... When it finally came it dropped as an alpha pack legendary. I spent all my renown on packs, not a single legendary.
---
Fucking hell
---
The last two legendaries I got were duplicate charms
---
Thanks for the clarification. I guess I need to read the book now xD
---
To be honest from base game they have been a little broken
---
Thanks will do, these handful of comments don’t define me as a person btw so I’m pretty sure I will have a wonderful day :)
---
Yeah it's confusing, but this will only effect casual, unranked and ranked will have the same maps the entire season
---
I got this one too. Level 102 my first legendary and i got this shit.
---
*Just a little shtick*
---
Can I get an F in the chat.
---
Stolen from the shittyr6s meme
---
I think they should at least buff the recoil, I mean every other dlc operator released after ela has a better gun.
---
After I killed him he messaged me privately on xbox live accusing me of hacking
---
then don’t play Mozzie
---
Ha-Anâl
---
Ubisoft makes all the elites actual uniforms used by whichever country or nation or whatever the op is form so sadly this won’t happen.
---
But can it beat the all recruit dream team?
---
PlayStation players in a nutshell
---
Ah
---
For clarification, he recorded this on his phone using remote play. He played with a controller and recorded this through his PlayStation, only to play it back on his phone. It wouldn’t be possible for him otherwise to knife.
---
As a casual pleb, this infuriates me. They shouldn’t be fucking with the casual map rotation except to take out trash like Favela and Yacht. The rest of it is just dumb.
---
I got the same charm, best legendary I've gotten yet (no black ice gang).
---
It is funny.
---
Best part is I don’t main ash.
---
Ok
---
Is their a list anywhere with all the Alpha Pack heads and skins?
---
I’ve played it. A lot of run outs and cross map window peeks are denied but there are plenty there and enough so it feels like the old kanal.
---
The sites felt about the same to defend, better to attack because you can make it to the building alive now. There are still far too many short 90 degree hallways that form claustrophobic choke points. 
---
The top floor is still a slog. Just shooting in windows hoping to get a couple of picks while 2-3 come up the back way to take out defenders while they are distracted with window fighting. Basement is fine unless you are dumb enough to think the door going into basement is a good idea. The door might as well not be there because it’s essentially instant death for any attacker. 
---
A lot changed about the map. It’s an amazing looking and cool map. It’s still worse for ranked than fortress and theme park in my book though. 
---
Oh ya and god help you if you find yourself in the hallway between buildings. Attackers lose that 9 times out of ten. 
---
I don’t have an issue with run outs. I like skyscraper (tho I admit it doesn’t belong in ranked). I just think the run outs that are available on this map are stupid because defenders if they get In position first can see attackers before attackers can see them (this is not the case on skyscraper where even the most annoying run outs are countered so easily they might as well be free kills). 
---
Kanal got a fresh coat of paint and a few new stairs. It’s still no where near to being a good enough map for ranked if you take into account the maps that were removed. If they were not removed I wouldn’t be making this comparison or complaint
---
What
---
You misspelled Finka
---
Are you playing Casual or Ranked? Some people just do it to be annoying, some accidently do it; but yeah, its annoying as fuck when it happens
---
Is it a glitch
---
Balanced, like all things should be.
---
I would also cry
---
Ik u just posted this but u could prob get something better out of r/R6STeams
---
It's pretty much suicide if there is anyone anywhere near the window
---
some guys don’t know how to lose, gotta go with it :P
---
hackers in casual on console? doubt
---
Cheers mate
---
most of the time thats how it goes
---
The more balanced a game is, the harder it must be to clutch. A 1vX should technically be unwinnable if everyone played perfectly and the game is balanced
---
If that were me I would have been too slow and come in right after he defused
---
This guy deserves to be witch hunted.
---
And I, you
---
Dude he is pretty darn good as is, I think he is perfect where he is
---
Most of siege is map memorization that comes with play time. Knowing sight lines, breachable walls that could create new sightlines, knowing where attackers might come from or where defenders might be hiding. Watching pro leage, youtubers, or streamers can help you learn awesome play patterns and specific operator tips which will help you out a lot. But just playing and making notes of how you die and where other people put their gadgets will do ya good. 
---
Side note: if you end up getting really into siege, this video will be awesome to look back at
---
Me slowly grappling up to the top floor to put exothermic charge down and go through a trap door

I liked club houses rework, but hate Herefords. I haven't got to try kafe yet.
---
Made me laugh too. It’s kind of like a cartoon lol.
---
....that’s not how it works. again, you can’t witch hunt on this sub.
---
i thought the same lmao
---
Good ace, but why not reinforce that wall; ez.
---
I was only able to get this clip but there was a doc that was obviously hacking. He and one other just spawnpeeked strait one tap headshots
---
Its too sad microsoft wont let you bully people anymore on xbox live. Fuckers like this really deserve it
---
That little boy sounds like he sucks at Siege honestly...

Lol, hi jehdro

I guess if ubisoft can make adding this "battle pass" worth it I'm just gonna ignore it lol

I really don't know

Plat 3? Didn’t you just post on r/R6Teams asking for Gold 1? What rank are you? Why did your squad ditch you? Is it because they’re tired of carrying you?

Same

Thanks my friend!

Maybe if you wernt such a sped and rushed stairs when the squad said no.

They see you yet you cant see them yet

---
I’m gonna miss the Easter egg of the guy trapped in the container

I was so confused at first. I knew I had seen it before...

There are golden ones!? Well I guess I'm just camping the rainbow six line at the next E3 then.

you were shooting the backpack and then when u aimed up abit you were hitting him in the shoulder..

Idk maybe shooting through his uniform

He needs training wheels
---
I have 1200 from the year 4 pass. Do I get it?
---
You shoulda gone for the sledge kill
---
Makes sense minus Fuze considering the map.
---
I use classic although I couldn't tell the difference when I switched it
---
Which ever you prefer
---
Hey man, this looks great! I love to see artwork on this sub. Just keep practicing (especially with the thumb part lol), and you’ll get even better!
---
I make more than 200 per casual game
---
Everyday challenges, boosters helps a lot and if you want casual, fastest way to get renown
---
Classic is much faster. I use 52/52/28 and on updated its quite slow but on classic its quite quick
---
Whichever you like, try both and use what fits your play style
---
And don't worry about what people say about certain  guns being shit, I use Thatchers AR all the time and it works (everyone says to use the L85 but I still don't)
---
Was there a Mira player ?
---
With mineral oil
---
I wouldn’t be super opposed to him being a sort of blackbeard style op, but I think most people would definitely disagree, but if he gets the shield speed decrease it might be balanced enough to work, especially as a 3 armor op. Then he’s significantly more mobile than before but still a dedicated anchor. But it could cause a lot of issues that I’m not factoring in right now. I like the idea you have but would the DP-28 replace his primary or would it be separate from it?
---

---
No, ignoring any "realism" since it's fictional you could argue it stopping the bombs from going off or not. It's simply a game balance reason. Before the defuser goes down defenders have the time advantage, it's their job to run the clock down. As soon as attack gets defuser down, it's flipped, now defense is the one that needs to get aggressive and push for the disable. Defence doesn't need the advantage of a 0s disable because they already have the advantage of attackers being required to push them.
---
Disabled battleye and hacked it.

I thought that you can't buy those special event packs with anything except Ubi credits (real money).

If you've got some friends, doing hard mode t hunt with several people can yield upwards of 200 renown. It's very easy to grind, especially if you have a booster.
---
No Castle needs a damn elite. You guys already have a bunch of shit.
---
it was nice while it lasted
---
I don’t think so tbh. She offers little utility to the team and doesn’t really have a role, from what I can see. 
---
I’d much rather see her be able to breach quickly if she wants, or keep the flashes if she wants to be more aggressive. Both would work fine depending on playstyle
---
Except Bartlett
---
Yeah I play 45/45/45
---
I mean the fire rate compared to most other guns in pretty mediocre but otherwise it’s solid
---
Including👏Bartlett
---
What room you were defending ?
---
What do they do
---
I main Ela currently and in her current state she is one if not the worst defender in game. 
---
Her scorpion is the only primary in game without a recoil diamond. As well only doing a max of 23 damage which is the 3rd lowest in game. 
---
Her pistol does the lowest damage of all handguns and only has a fall off range of 12 meters making the sight a niche at best. 
---
Her secondary gadgets are quite useless.  She's a very aggressive roamer and needs to be as her guns are very limiting. Yet she has two stationary gadgets she doesn't have a use for. 
---
I can't tell you who to pick but I'd not recommend Ela. She's fun but not viable. She's been nerfed 8 times last i remember and buffed once. But not really as the veryical recoil buff is negated by no recoil diamond.
---
I really like it. Plus she got that new acog which personally I prefer. Thing is a laser. 
---
Her assault rifle is good but shes just one I use lmg on. I reccomend trying both and see what you like. 
---
Never really seen a ones substainally better than other arguement.
---
u/The-Main-Goyo
---
Can’t remember
---
Very nice comrades
---
I got this charm about 2 months ago and I lost all my joy and happiness
---
I mean loan wolf. You get more practice and can get more time on the map for more map knowledge
---
I feel as if Negative Attitude counts as Grievance
---
Congrats man
---
He doesn’t need a buff
---
So you’re telling me an Amaru will repel to a window, place a breach and destroy the castle, while then having the repel back down, go back a bit, then grapple in, which is so time consuming, pointless and risky, that Castle is still as much of a counter as before. 
---
She gains no benefit for herself by doing so, because at that point, she may as well hot Breach in. This is why Breach charges would work just fine and should be part of her kit
---
Aug is worse statistically, but it's easier to use. Much easier to hold down fire and drag to the head rather than spam click while controlling the extreme recoil. Just like G36C is easier but worse statistically to R4C
---
Personally would much prefer if Nokk become 3 Speed instead to allow her rotate around much more aggressively and it will definitely make her stand out on her own even compared to the other 3 Speeds. As of now, her quiet walk is barely better than 3 Speed Attackers crouch walking around. 
---
That aside, regardless of Nokk or anyone else getting it, I am worried about Dokk getting frag in general. I can already imagine getting a call and soon after frags just raining upon me.
---
Not to hate on the guy who made this, but if SAU-SIEGE did a version of this I think it would look really cool
---
Yeah it is a situation you're right. The ammo box is only in terrorist hunt/situations. My bad
---
Well, last time there were 2 kinds of Halloween themed items - ones were Crimsonveil collection (locked behind packs for real money), while the store had 5 OG bundles, available 45k for a headgear, charm, weapon skin and uniform for Hibana, Ash, Pulse, Buck and Mira.
---
Maybe they are a bunch of Dicks . SQUAD reverse friendly fire is coming
---
Why pay for a lawsuit when your player base already pays you for everything in game? /s
---
I hope you didn't lose a rank because of this.
---
I think it’s something with ubisoft not wanting to stir up controversy
---
The maps aren't the issue, I've played for a while on xbox. Its mostly not wrecking my wrists lol.
---
I have bone growths in my wrist that suck when it comes to keyboard and mouse.
---
Recruit and his friends find a new drone hole
---
RTX2060 should get way more than that. I run a 1070 in my zephyrus with ultra details and a little over 1080p and I get 120fps consistently.
---
Well that is the entire idea she went with so I can't be mad at you for commenting this XD.
---
I know I’m excited
---
Stolen, and not deleted by the mods, even when it's a meme.
---
Ok then
---
I’ve used muzzle brake exclusively since like season 3. I always thought it was the best.
---
This looks badass
---
No
---
And smoke boxed maestro and beat him.
---
PMC Ela would be badass, but we get this. I always loved how edgy Ela is, but this is just tacky. As an Ela main I thought for sure I'd be buying her elite now I'm sad.
---
12 dollars? Nah
---
U 100% sure they were a squad?
---
Also I forgot to mention that my friend has never even played R6. She asked if she wanted us to draw someone cause she was bored. I sent her a pic of dokkaebi fanart and she went from that.
---
What's your level?
---
Nah man, xbox(( Wish they has cross play for console at least.

---
Now do you use it on everything? Because for me there were always certain guns I would run comp on but now I’m rethinking things!
---
Well making Nøkk 3 speed wouldn’t do too much. Considering you have to crouch walk/walk to not glitch and not make any noise the difference between 3 speed and 2 speed is minuscule. I think Nøkk is fine as a 2 speed but giving her frag’s would make up for her lackluster weapons and lack of an ACOG. But I totally agree that Dokk has no business having Frag’s. All you have to do is ban Jäger and she can get an EZ kill.

Ubi removed it temporarily due to an exploit

of course. gotta make sure you don't actually get anything GOOD one every 30 packs in ~150 hours
---
The top right symbolizes this well
---
Just save up the bundle I’d imagine isn’t going anywhere and you can’t buy elites with renown
---
nice job dude 👍
---
People just get so into themselves with that bs, and Siege is already toxic enough. I went into a ranked game today and a 14 year old was screaming about how he was the second coming of christ with his elite skins...it was horrible
---
just posted the hibana variant if you wanna check that out
---
Also, it's just more fun to open the packs even if I know what its gonna be
---
Sure
---
*Starts looking for a certain number*

Or to numb the pain if you lose.

Breaching Charge from twitch I guess

You forgot about the new op

I’ll be glad the day they add a new op with the AK re used

Yup most shield characters work better as a distraction...people tend to really pay attention to shields and forget about everyone else

The counter to Blackbeard is your left analog stick. You literally go another way.

New Hereford is hated on way too much. The main problem is the map looks like shit. Every room has the exact same feel. That's why they made Outback the way it is where every room is clearly different than another. Though that map has its own problems.

Do you know how much the licensing costs for each "new" gun they add to the game?

What's the name of this program ?

1. Why would you put the charge where it is visible to the enemy?

2. Breaching charges only do up to 50 damage behind the charge. It’s been that way for a while now
---
&gt;somewhat bad
---
Ha get nerfed nerd. They changed it so they don’t do as much damage on the placement side. If you’d put it on the opposite side, gg ez
---
No.  Not me though
---
I think it's referring to the rules like being able to pick the site as a defender, and the 3 attack/defend rounds in succession before swapping to defense/attack. As opposed to the alternate attack/defend rounds in casual
---
I just assumed because is has caveira and vigil next to allies
---
I love this elite, and after all of the elites, i only like three.

This, miras, and valks.

The licensing costs tons of money. Not to mention, i remember seeing something about they are only allowed to license so many.

No? I really see no problem here.

Is this legit?

we talking dollars or r6 credits my guy

Yea exactly. People complain either way

Haha you spent $500 on this game.  That's hilarious.

Yea, at least give her a recoil diamond.

Like seriously she has one of the worst weapons on defense rn.

Not 100% about Gridlock on Theme Park, but Jager is one powerful ban if done right. Bunk Daycare might be very hard to defend without him.

yeah its all about those legal reasons...

Your gameplay must be pretty boring then.

I’m honestly not too sure but it was on the steam home page for R6. I hope it is. They need to rethink Frost tho.

Nope that's not right. I definitely remember multiple occasions last year where as long as the reinforcement was covering you then you were good and couldn't get shot

I would not stop playing this excellent game because of these issues. I only offer ideas to make it better.

Alright, hopefully. I just got ranked, and got put in Silver 3 for my first rank, knew that couldn't be right because I get clapped in Silver 3, now I'm in silver 2,  was in silver 1 for a bit
---
Yeah idk what the hell is up, I attack more than 9/10 times. Super annoying.
---
Well it's console, enemies are worst than terrorist hunt on PC tbh
---
Old Hereford
---
Nobody cares
---
Jesus i wish i was half this good
---
Where's candella?
---
You think play players are immune to rushes or something? The only player that fucked up on their team was that Doc which, in result, costed their entire team the game since there is an Operator with a superior gun and ACOG in the middle of site. The other defenders literally did nothing wrong. People don’t expect a Sledge to randomly walk into site because some dumbass didn’t reinforce or is AFK
---
How is that not feasible? If they have a moving model for the player it can’t be difficult to make a static model match that.
---
Anyone know what the capitao change means? 4 fire arrows?
---
I just bought this guy :(
---
You forgot Ying charge
---
Nice mega cool gamer move. I wish I was good enough to do mega cool game moves.
---
You didn't obey the call to a recruit rush. That is heresy of the highest order
---
Damn that’s cool.... until it never drops for me from the alpha packs.
---
No, I'm just saying it's stupid. Never really cared before but now everyone spams it and its annoying
---
I know, I just have nobody else to share it with.
---
Where is his bicycle?
---
dat t bag tho
---
They are reworking Theme Park next season so the game mode could be released with it
---
Hippity hoppity, fuck off
---
oh, idk I just like playing him
---
Step 1: learn to play Caveira 
---
Step 2: learn to play Nøkk 
---
Step 3: use the knowledge of where Caveira could hide to stalk and ambush her with Nøkk 
---
Step 4: bliss
---
I don't get it. People always try to use it on walls when it's *clearly* a mellee weapon
---
I don't really know the exact number of how many alpha packs I got in certain hours. I never counted it because whenever I'm expecting to receive one when its over 40% or so, I don't, so, I stopped expecting and without realizing it, I had amassed quite a few numbers of them. Well, this is based on my experience, but, I often received epics more than I get rares, sometimes legendary just popped 2 or 3 times in less than a week, I'll just shrug my shoulders and say &gt; okay then, nice.
---
While I can see where you're coming from and is questioning them myself, I think the main reason is just them wanting us players to spend as much time as possible in siege(like a internet company that want their customers to stay subscribe to them every year). Also, the curiosity of wanting to obtain said legendaries is also one of the factor as to why they set these legendaries in alpha packs that are only available in alpha packs only.
---
Lastly, this is Ubisoft after all, its all a scheme to make some players to either buy the elite skins, &gt;&gt;&gt;season pass&lt;&lt;&lt;, seasonal skins, booster pack, and alpha packs via r6 credits.
---
Did he say anything? I imagine that he would be pissed lmao.
---
YEET
---
Better then me
---
Ok.Thank you for informing :)
---
You would think so too. It's most likely a limitation with the game engine that prevents them from doing that.
---
Step 1: learn to play Caveira, Step 2: learn to play Nøkk, Step 3: use the knowledge of where Caveira could hide to stalk and ambush her with Nøkk, Step 4: bliss
---
I have 230 hours, which about 60 of which were spent with my computer on but I'm at school, or sleeping. and I never really got into the game until like 2 months ago
---
It is an issue people can see you before you see them because ubi put the perspective camera into the middle of the head making half of the head exposed when peeking a corner. They did this because of the lean spam but tbh I rathed it better before.
---
That's awesome!
---
Its casual lmao. And you should go recruit rush with them as well.
---
'La Casa de Papel' is Spanish for 'the house of paper', which is fitting considering the plot / plan. I believe (but don't quote me on this) that 'papel' /paper is also a widely used slang for 'money' in Spanish.
---
Whats the difference between this and hot breaching?
---
Its your own fault. You didn’t answer to the call of the power rangers
---
Out of curiosity, which weapons have a black ice skin?
---
Actually hella nice, upvote and like from me
---
True that lol. Can't wait for next season for that fix
---
Enjoyed
---
Lmao this is great
---
If you’re using castle I would advise you not to
---
$2,000?? Yeah..yeah i'd say you might be. Jesus.
---
I like how he's using a mouse and keyboard and not a single comment has pointed it out, yet console players always claim to be able to spot mouse users instantly..
---
Hrrrrrrm
---
Depends onnthe ban, if it was doing something scummy i hope you stay banned, but of it was an honest mistake not hat harmless ect then it shouldnt ip ban you
---
Welp looks like I’m quitting R6S!
---
MnK
---
Someone's jealous
---
The games literally not gonna die because u have no1 to play with
---
Work on aim, make sure your sitting comfortable and your arm wrist motions are fluid and your dpi sens. Are configured correctly, everything else will follow
---
It's like arresting someone for stealing a free balloon. They're allowed to do it, and they did it. They didn't break any rules.
---
How do you propose we base it on skill? Since your the expert apparently.
---
You read my mind, or comments... Possibly both. Possibilty.
---
I'm surprised I haven't been accused of a MnK yet on PS4.. I have one clip of me getting 3 headshots in like 5 seconds, 2 of which look like I'm using a mouse..
---
Quick! Give it the spoilers flair before the people who care get triggered and cry.
---
Can you quote where I said I was an expert, and I would completely remake the ranking system?
---
Youll get more if you wont play Tachanka :/
---
The game will die from the toxicity and people leaving.
---
Epic gamer moment
---
Can i have ur cola?
---
Lesion was never seen again...
---
T-5 and SASG-12 are just a bit outlandish for an American Operator. I can see the MP7 and FO-12, though. The F2, may be dancing over the line of balanced and OP.
---
K-anal*
---
Literally just ran into a 5 stack of guys, 2 of them were plat 2's and were very obviously using MNK on Xbox. One was a gold 1 and i want to say a copper smurf and a bronze. It was ridiculous. We took 1 round, but i'm in gold 3. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm now in a game RN with another plat and a bronze smurf. Really looking forward to the MMR gap.
---
Done!
---
Meaning the new bios for the old operators.
---
Just want to let you know that I kinda went on a bit of a tangent at the end so I'll mark what isn't actually relevant to the current discussion so you don't have to read it. Also I don't know if I came across as hostile in this but if I did, I would like to apologize.  
---
This basic balancing hasn't really been upheld it seems, otherwise Warden would have gotten a better gun. Even if we just count that as an outlier there are other Ops that have both good gadgets and powerful weapons. I'd argue that Mira has an ability of equivalent strength, if not stronger, than Valk yet she also has a statistically better gun so should we nerf her Vector? A lower damage or ROF should do nothing to her in terms of viability since its a "Headshot machine" as they say, but it would bring it closer to where the MPX is.   
---
Speaking of weapons that could be brought down, the T-5 SMG, also statistically better featuring a better fire rate, higher damage per shot and still being a headshot machine because of its rather low recoil. Lesion is an operator with a powerful ability, perhaps not as game-changing as Mira's but still an ability with a lot of utility. Unless you want to argue that Lesion's ability is weak enough that it warrants a giving him a weapon of such strength the cop out answer of "Good gadget = Bad gun" won't work.  
---
\---------Below this line is not relevant to the conversation happening in this thread--------------
---
Also lets talk about the usage of "headshot machine" in response to why the MPX shouldn't get buffed, I know that you didn't use that excuse but I feel that it's a fair time to discuss my grievances with it.  
---
Due to the fact that headshots are effectively one hit kills in this game all guns can be called headshot machines because you only need the first bullet to hit the opponents head. In a perfect world where everyone clicks heads instantly all of the guns, save for shotguns, would be equivalent in power as long as they fire as soon as the click is registered. Unfortunately we do not live in a perfect world, and a lot of people can't just click heads all day every day. This leads to guns having slightly different play styles, but also leads to certain guns being stronger than others in most situations. Due to the "Headshot-centric" nature of the game guns with faster fire rates are preferred over those that have higher single shot damage but a lower rate of fire, it's a lot easier to land a headshot when you've got a bullet hose. Think about DMRs in this game, how many of them would the average person use over the other weapons offered to what ever operator they choose? Save for those that can't control Buck's recoil on the C8 and those that would rather have a DMR with 20 shots rather than a "DMR" with 2 on Dokk most people would choose the other less semi-auto options. Rate of Fire has a large impact on the power of a weapon so other factors than "It has little to no recoil" must be taken into account otherwise any weapon with little to no recoil should be nerfed to have the same DPS as the MPX, weather that be through nerfing damage per shot or rate of fire. Let's hearken back to that perfect world for a second and imagine that two changes have taken place:
---
First, every gun has been changed to have the same damage (3) but kept their original fire rates the same.
---
Second, the accuracy of all the players has been reduced to a level where they aim mostly where they want and they all make the adjustments to aim at the same rate of once every 50 ms. But this lack of initial accuracy forces them to miss the first shot.
---
In this world headshots are still king and bodyshots are nearly worthless but now that the first bullet always misses the guns are once again on unequal playing fields. Lets say that the last two players are using the MPX and the T-5 SMG, they both round the corner flick to the opponents head at the same time, 50ms after that they both readjust their aim to be directly on the head of their adversary. Doing some math that, honestly, may be incorrect I found that the T-5 fires a bullet every \~67ms and the MPX fires every \~72ms. Due to the differences in re-fire rate the T-5 wins this engagement every single time simply due to firing a second shot faster. That makes it the better headshot machine and any gun with a faster re-fire rate than the T-5 would unerringly win against it when put in the same situation.  
---
The point I'm trying to make here is that just because something doesn't have a ton of recoil doesn't mean that you can simply say that its balanced and needs no tweaks. Thinking that the MPX is in a perfect place because its on a strong operator would only be an acceptable thought process if you also think that the T-5 and Vector both need nerfs.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand that Valk is a powerful operator, but that alone is no justification for not listening to those that may have objections to the current strength of her weapon. Personally I think the MPX would be in a good place with a damage increase of 3 raising it to 29 damage per shot with 830 RoF and giving it a DPS of 401, which still isn't as high as the DPS for the T-5 SMG (420) or the MX4 Storm (412). This change would still put an emphasis on prioritizing headshots but at least it wouldn't be where it is now, where its headshot or get killed after landing 4 body shots on a 2 armor and still have left them with \~7 hp
---
&gt; Why is it based on matches won, not skill?
---
I dunno dude, sounds like you know better than the devs.
---
That’s too easy of a win dude
---
wow thats stupid
---
u/RedditFiberzs
---
Thanks for voting up my comment 😂
---
That’s such a dick move but I also love it
---
Still waiting for that echo elite
---
Wow
---
ill admit i use castle but its the only op I'm good at and like using, and roamers tear down my walls when the prep phase is over because they don't care and i get killed trying to put it back up, its not my fault they don't leave before i put it up
---
i am plat 2 and we still ban him, i play cav like crazy if we do not ban him. I love to run around but he kills all the fun by pining me on the other side of the map
---
Wait you can see from both ways? When did they change that?
---
Operation Parking Lot
---
I dident say losing was always roamers fault, I just get annoyed when there’s 4 attackers near site and there’s 3 people trying to take on one guy across the map from obj
---
So you aren't new?
---
Then honestly our conversation is pointless. You are well aware of the game, then. I legit thought you were new.
---
Seas is a toxic nuclesr reactor filled with dragons. It's either really hard or really toxic.
---
Oh shit really. Thank god
---
"Bro you're just bad at the game."
---
What guns are you good with out of the Vector, Supernova, SMG-11, ITA12S, G8A1, TCSG-12, and the P229?
---
For sure. That's how the good ones do it. Stand there menacingly. Gets the job done
---
You play with coppers to bring the average rank down to play against easier opponents
---
Nice one!
---
Spam the shit out of crouching.
---
"i didnt say losing is the roamers fault"
---
*title is "fuck roamers"*
---
*makes post complaining about roamers*
---
lulw
---
Well, a lot has changed since then, so no, it wasn't pointless.
---
Yeah it’s not hard to be a monte, just gotta know your there for support not for kills
---
I mean there is a window 2cm beside that which you can just vault...
---
No operator is toxic, only players can be toxic
---
There are dumbasses in the R6S Discord server who defend this bs and say "just dont use skins" like where F is the logic?  
---
You can match your uniform and skins with the holograms if you just don't use them, so its not like it is a balancing issue, all this does is stop players from being able to use a skin for an operator for no good reason. Ubi doing it is one thing (maybe its a technical issue) but if you try to justify this from a gameplay point, you are a clinical imbecile.
---
Yeah I was heated in the moment of making the post, guess the title was exaggerated but still, let’s say I have a distaste for roaming as much as people do
---
Get goyo
---
Amaru may same more fun but trust me, goyo is godly wether u run vector or shotgun with acog
---
No hammer on first kill though =(
---
steam and uplay are different downloads
---
You would be surprised at the amounts of people who don't talk, that I get in ranked. Maybe I just get used to it, but when I do get someone with a mic, they're really hypocritical when they "call out all the time".
---
There's a fine line between playing ranked like casual and not having a mic in ranked. I'm not saying that you can't be mad towards someone playing brain dead in ranked, you can totally have at it. But saying that ranked would require a mic?
---
I get that it's a team game, and I get that it's helpful to call out so that your team mate doesn't die. But it's unrealistic to expect players to be like that all the time.
---
Oh fuck
---
Yeppp. Same story with me tonight. Almost took one too. Next season these losers will have to figure out another way to cheat the system.
---
Well I guess you’ll be happy that a new unranked mode is coming out.  Supposed to play like ranked while not being as stressful or have as much stakes. Also, to prevent this in the future, just find two other people so you’re in the majority of the team and try not to take casual so seriously. Tk should stay in casual because it’s not supposed to be serious although I do see the argument that it shouldn’t be in ranked.
---
You need to help them roam. 
---
You don't have control over their skill but you can try to make their job easier with info. But if he's dying like an idiot then you wouldn't want him to be an anchor either. Idiots don't help no matter the role.
---
It was always like that. If you have a big scope and the defender is wiggling around you can tell from the front-side. It's just not useful most of the time.
---
Well for starters the cancer meta has been imbued into the community, so almost every game that reached overtime is basically people freezing you and rushing you and catching you off guard. Pick and ban is a treat but takes a while to master unless you have a stack. Comparing Chimera and now, now is definitely harder.
---
You became the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
Edit: am plat btw ama
---
He's John wick with ballistic shield.
---
The original concept was one way glass but they said they had decided to change it after some testing.
---
Yea, they'll still be able to Smurf but at least they can't boost. 
---
The thing that sets me off is the reveal at the very end of the game. Like goddamn if I had seen it at the begging I would've left immediately.
---
Oof
---
Get Amaru. The g8a1 with the angled grip makes it a beast of a weapon now. Certainly helps that the recoil have been reduced as well.
---
Goyo is fun but both his choices for primary weapons are a bit meh. Sure the TCSG shotgun is strong and I love playing Kaid, but it limits the way he plays significantly. You have to hold the objective and play long angles basically the same way you play Kaid. As for the Vector, it's an okay weapon, but it's not really that good for roaming. Low damage and low capacity.
---
Satisfying
---
really?
---
He does the "news" several days after they were announced. Coreross is better in my opinion
---
u/Redstarboy
---
ja moin wahrscheinlich mache ich Grammatikfehler 😁
---
Google rb6 stats. There’s a site where u can check pls rank.
---
"Everyone around me.. is an idiot"
---
so.. basically the consoles are at fault.. x\_X they are the driving force behind the p2p debacle
---
I agree about the first part but pick and ban really isn't that hard to understand, just ban jackal, montage or Blackbeard (preferably jackal) and on defense just ban lesion or echo. Mira as well on maps like bank and Oregon.
---
Volume III
---
To stop Smurf’s and too make sure you atleast know something about the game before going straight into ranked, but imo 30 is still too low
---
Awesome, congrats dude! Keep it up, will ya?  I got my first ace a few days ago after 5 months of playing. My cousin got his first MVP not too long ago as well. (He’s new too)
---
I miss it so much
---
It's just impossible for ubi to fix, other games don't have as much spaghetti code.
---
I laughed while poopin
---
Imagine if Amaru knocks Clash back like Nomad airjab.
---
Some doors will just need to be left open. I'm not saying all doors, but some. I would suggest watching some streams of higher lvl people and observe how they barricade. Maciejay is a good one to watch on twitch. Map knowledge and knowing how to use all of your gear is key. I would suggest using a different defender, in my opinion castle is a low tier op. I would say mute or smoke would be very good for you.
---
What are the benefits of 4:3 stretched?
---
I’m switching to Mira when I can, castle was temporary because I couldent find a defender op I liked
---
Well, they only host one event a season, this season was showdown, next season is 99.9% Halloween event  and I cannot see how the Money Heist skins would fit into the Halloween event. This means that the skins are either just an addon to the game or they might be linked to an event in Y4S4.
---
What did you just do to these poor people?
---
Lmao it's the greatest feeling (soon after call out got a twitch drone) the best
---
Hopefully Y4S4 event.
---
Jokes on you I've been plat every season and was diamond once and never brag abo-FUCK
---
Have my upvote !
---
Well, there goes what remains of realism theme of rainbow six
---
Wow that gave me cancer
---
Echt schön, dass Ubi solche kleinen Details einbaut ^^ nur schade, dass man außer der Überschrift den Rest nicht lesen kann
---
:)
---
u/Mrbrutehater
---
I use them. The lack of smoke trails, sound and danger indicator has saved my arse countless times
---
What is 0.3%? And where did you pull the overall number from?
---
I don't need sleep i need renown
---
That would be great
---
How in the hell were they play with those reinforcements??
---
It needs to be compared to time played and deaths to show if you're among the top imo. In R6 stats I can see I have 7,6k kills and 6,4 death in lifetime. And that runs from day one so I've had a lot of time to rank up those kills. 5-600 hours I reckon. Yet I have never gone above gold 4 rank. 
---
But as you say, having fun is what matters.
---
Be warned for non steam games, it tend to crash when playing from a phone with it.
---
What's it like to be plat?
---
More like tachanka buff
---
Alright so both of the operators
---
So does this mean harry is the professor?
---
Wouldn't say 'unfair'. It should be common practice to drone out that entrance during prep. If the defenders have a strong position, don't push it. It's not like there aren't alternative routes to take from the back alley spawn.
---
I'm sure your game is on a ssd if you are sporting those specs. 
---
So make sure windows DVR(or what ever it's called) is off  it's under the Xbox app this could be hurting you as well as make sure GeForce experience has instant replay disabled.
---

This lanyard would be a nice addition to my stack of lanyards I use for work
---
same i have so many skins and charms that i either worked hard for or was really lucky to get which i cant access whenever playing with friends on another device
---
I’m really hoping they drop the limited time packs for the Battle Pass. I feel like this would at least make it so that you know exactly how much money you’re gonna spend and still get what you want.
---
As for in-game Alpha Packs, I guess I like the idea that they’re hard to come by. Idk maybe if they brought back the old ones they discontinued into the shop or something? I mean it’s not like we can sell them for obscene amounts of money so I don’t really see why not.

It's because he is stational. He cannot move an therefore cannot hide or dodge bullets. The shield is a compensation.

That's because the Prisma isn't using Alibi's player model. Think of the projected "Alibi" as a [one-piece 3D mesh](https://i.imgur.com/YWM8RCU.png) that's part of the emitter. Could they load [different textures](https://i.imgur.com/GctAz8q.png)? Almost certainly, but Ubisoft would need to make low-quality versions of every single uniform/SMG texture, and this issue also sidesteps headgears that don't share the same beret model.
---
Whatever you need to say to make you feel better about yourself :) it's ok
---
Might also be a kind of new sponsor to Ubi that asked to be promoted in some way, but I think it isn't related to Halloween since we saw that we have the Halloween skins as well (like bandit crazy doctor etc.)

Whoa what a Gamer !

Who is this obutu? He leak all new content
---
Sad that I didn't played this mode. Hopefully there will be a nice game mode next April 1st
---
So i wasted my money? Great.
---
No sadly this is only for PC :(
---
My wishlist for this has always been to take the LMG off the bipod, give it to him as a primary, and put a DSHK on it that can shoot through shields. Also give him a Skorpion as a secondary for full suite of Cold War collectibles.
---
*Electrify yourself now!*
---
**Barricades his body**
---
Ubisoft: Adds new deployable shield
---
Also Ubisoft: Takes deployable shield from like half the defenders in the game
---
I love it.
---
Yeah that’s neat and all maybe I’ll get it once uni gives me all the fucking charms
---
When you cant fuse walls so you gave to improvise.
---
What? You do miss all but three or so round.
---
Sure you can still get it, some of it, over time. But here’s my question to you; how long is that going to take? What is the time difference between grinding though playtime and just flat out buying it all with real money?
---
Good strat xD
---
How the frick 
---
Happy cake day
---
I have seen the other players perspective of this exact clip
---
Ah, I made the mistake of purchasing him thinking the lord nickname originated from him being op.
---
I’ve seen people put mats in wire in gold and diamond. Point is a player with a fucking brain still checks for frost mats thought with shield strats even if they know it’s their there are 3 guaranteed outcomes. They step in it. They waste a frag or they die by trying to hop shield and shoot the mat. 
---
I will take one of the 3 guarantees over the hope that someone is dumb enough to step in a non hidden frost mat.
---
Hope it has acog
---
Theres already two other headgears that show her face with no paint
---
I'm way lower rank than plat, and that shit would never work in my games I feel like. There would be legion mines in the teller room, a kapkan on the door, the workshop wall would be hard, and 2 players would we watching the approach.
---
Hereford was fine? Please remove the rose tinted glasses, old Hereford had one staircase defenders could use for rotates if attackers took an obj and you werent on the same floor already, you lost, every objective had a wall door or window leading directly outside(which everyone used to bitch about, which is why they are careful now to have at least 1 room between outside and bombsites
---
Old hereford wasnt terrible like Favela or Bartlett but saying its worse than New Hereford is completely fucking stupid
---
her face got already leaked months ago
---
😨

That's a shame :( have you linked your account?

I know man, i know

Ok guys, I got you, now I see that OP Health 2 isn't a good way, anyway thx for comments. GL in games

Looks like a fly

I’ve done that a lot of times and have replaced the thermalpads 3 times already

I am currently in Gold 1, but I don't think I am that high level. I'm good at callouts and rallying my team, but not good at shooting the other guys. I'm at a ~2 W/L but 0.5 K/D. This could be 5 mes on this team

or they shoot through the pixel gap that is currently guaranteed with shields. i haven't seen anyone fall for the shield trap in ages. they do fall for smart placements.

Hello GhostHaydon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ctvkzq/garage_in_tts/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Those look awesome! I painted one of Bandit and Jackel, I must say it feels great recreating something from a game I love.
---
Are Valk or Pulse either of your mains?
---
We anchor shields into doorways now
---
I’m usually on archives hatch because for the workshop objectives there is always at least one person that goes through archives without checking hatch easy kills
---
I basically only play during that time. Are you telling me that this isn’t the norm?

Balance, but yeah it does seem a little too early at the moment.
---
Was hoping you switched back to the drone to watch the aftermath
---
I feel that applies to rainbow is magic, madhouse and showdown, simply because they deviated from the normal playlists so little. This however, seems a lot more unique, it being basically spooky hide and seek

Meghan J. Castellano takes four new recruits for a test run.

Seriously was hoping we would find the second perspective of this eventually by chance. I fucking love this shit. This is peak reddit. Our sub has accomplished this before, but that doesn't make it less fun the following instances.
---
What's the point in putting it there?
---
While that is true, Nokk is one operator whose job can easily be taken over by 3 Speed Attackers since her quiet walk is only slightly better than 3 Speed crouch walking. 
---
Cav and Vig are both 3 Speed Defenders who can rotate quickly. Nokk is a 2 Speed Attacker with FMG and no utility for the team to benefit from. I can't imagine pros ever taking her in a tournament over the other Attackers.
---
Oh ok, have you contacted playstation support, because they might be able to help
---
Don't get me wrong that's hella cool! But man all the defenders on site in a plat game triggers me a little. Why the heck don't they have toilets/square corridor control? And why the hell aren't the toilet/tellers walls reinforced?  Really mediocre Plats
---
Dw u should still definitely have him
---
I’m sure it’s not my console, R6S is literally the only game which makes it THAT loud. All the other games are quiet
---
This was disgusting to look at. Are you trying to give me a stroke?
---
Mute them.
---
I can hear you screaming the whole time for that last kill
---
That shit is gonna hurt more than taking away 10hp when its starts shooting bricks at you.
---
Hi reddit
---
I was confused why he would even say that.
---
Big brain time
---
It's like gold 1, but everyone is an asshole
---
The last crouch fits in so perfectly
---
I think everything about it is cool but the gas mask looks so weird and that alone makes me hate it.

I wonder what went through that fuze’s head once he set it off.

It could when you shoot it at a window and could launch another piece of metal or other material or due to its imperfections the grappling hook could hit the barricade then realine itself but right now they dont have much info weather or not she is op or not

Obviously I tried to edit this a little, its because I used to make bad overwatch videos and now decided to make a siege one. If you want to check it out, its not even two minutes and has more footage like this plus volume, if you want to check it out here is a link

just turn the calibration ingame higher

How do you get that doc main thing?

you mean the Brightness bar in settings?

Well i did, but i made very awkward sounds afterwards. I thought its to cringy :'D

The “mystery” is why I despise loot boxes. Just give me what I want, not 1 million skins I will never use.

Not only is that really uninspired, especially next to Thatchers and  Sledges, but it also doesn't fit Smokes personality at all.

Smokes elite had so much potential, there are so many historical examples of interesting hazard protection outfits that the fact his elite turned out to just be a T-hunt terrorist with a red hoodie instead of a grey one is kinda insulting.

Or give them back to IQ
---
I agree
---
Haha, I really am actually. I will keep an eye out for the new Op's artowroks in hope for another hint.
---
it’s like when me and my brother would injure the hostage on defense then prone in front so the enemy kills it trying to kill us
---
Hot breaching on PC is disabled isn't it? So isn't this useless?
---
Less toxic on PC, text chat, but much higher sense of skill and a much higher skill cap on PC than Console.
---
Ok ok let's stop arguing. I still think it'll be an useless feature to this game.
---
r/dildont
---
More tryhards on PC. So you will face against a lot of tryhards that are cocky and will do anything to rile you up. I just mute the enemy team chat so I don't have to deal with that.
---
Oh no, this is highly exploitable. Now I'm gonna go and... not do malicious things with this information.
---
It's always 4 or less
---
I never claimed it would be a good feature, I don’t particularly care if they do I just disagreed greatly with your comment on CS
---
What a fucking flex
---
The game is still super tactical. Besides last season phantom sight i think all of the ops are still awsome and different than each other.
---
Spread it

IT WAS YOU

like any of us have 4 friends.

Speed. Violence. Momentum.

Is this map already out?

HERESY!
---
Does it look as shit as the cat one?

Same lmao. It's been what, a week? Since the doc's post?
---
It's almost stupid that Ubi designed the new op to be for competitive gameplay only. They forgot hostage and secure area existed.
---
Sept 10th is when Ember Rise goes live for all platforms.
---
even though this was a massive debate when she came out and we got the reasoning behind them not doing it and even then people still bitch and complain about it.

It's dumb that you need to win 3 rounds in a full squad.

Wasn't the cat day challenge just reaching 20 kills?

Nice idea to put a 5 stack challenge in the middle of summer when half my people isn't even playing ubi lmao

Try not to see logic behind it all

You literally saw a guy punch the canister in the video and it exploded. And twitch can open the canister on Mira's window.
---
I only found it out recently, 
---
My friend was all "Pick Mira and we will go up top, I saw this cool thing on youtube"
---
idk i dont have friends so i wont be able to get it, wasnt able to find anything out of google either so idk.
---
I would like it if you could play it solo or with a pre-made squad.
---
For "aesthatic purposes" because ubisoft doesnt need to fix their game
---
Multiply that by 5 and welcome to console, I've been on both (Xbox/PC)
---
I got stimpeeked yesterday too haha
---
Did you look at the image?
---
Lazytown
---
BUT DAE LORD LE FUNNY RUSSIAN MAN??
---
while the idea is quite nice, I think it would honestly make her a lot stronger than intended. Rather than just being a patch up for Alibi clones not showing skins, it would make it MORE confusing and difficult to discern what's a clone and what's not since you're not going to JUST be looking for Alibis.
---
Yeah. And since all gamers have no friends this will be hard. (this is a joke)
---
It's weird to see two posts of the same thing from a different view point
---
Because i ranked Plat 2 last tts
---
BECAUSE OF THERE GAME ENGINE IF YOU LISTENED TO THE REASONING THAT THE DEVS PROVIDED WHEN PEOPLE BITCH AND COMPLAINED ABOUT and whats the need for caps?
---
I saw the docs POV like a week ago lmao
---
oh right lmao it right above it.
---
Calculated dude :D

How tf xD

Make ninzya have no cap on how many times it can be used but make the cool down time longer and make it so the ability can be activated like cavs silent step
---
Thanks dude
---
And there's still counter play to it because Goyo could probably pick it up and then just take the jab at face value
---
She’s like Buck....but less boom boom, and she can counter Lesion. 
---
You find yourself hitting Lesion traps a lot....bring IQ. No reason not to. Use the 552 Commando. She’s a good op no matter what elo you are.
---
Yeah I posted this as a reply lol, weirdly enough this is footage from late april
---
Because they bought the starter edition (which makes you buy operators) and people prly took the only operators that he has
---
Fucken but ch of cockgobblers as usual in here
---
That’s a mighty bruh moment
---
He's a friendly doc
---
Never talk to me or my son again
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
I apologize for my stupidity but I don't get it..?
---
Important for you as a new player to learn the default camera spots and than again in high elo to counter valk and echo
---
I think Goyo is gonna prove to be the more useful operator so if neither stands out as being a better fit to your playstyle then I’d say him.
---
Hey I’ve seen this one before!
---
Wait so if i understood this correct does that mean they’re taking maps out of the casual pool?
---
As someone who doesn’t care about ranked in online games i only play casual and this kinda breaks my heart.
---
If you think so...
---
&gt;wow, you're just flat out wrong
---
Why Just saying i m flat Out wrong (Sound Like you swallow something but i dont judge you :) ) and Not say why you think i m wrong? Like wow her recoil is so good i need to Play her all the time! Or her Gadget Work together with her gun so smooth! But you Just Said i m wrong...
---
Now i will tell you why you are wrong:
---
Ela is underwhelming for many reasons currently.
---
Her scorpion first off is the worst primary in game. A very simple reason as to why as well. That is because it's the only primary without a recoil diamond which keeps the guns recoil within a defined area. The Scorpion isn't given one making it the worst automatically. Not to mention it doing a max damage of only 23 which is the 3rd lowest in game.
---
Her pistol now is also one of the worst. Not the worst, one of. I say this as it does the lowest damage out of all handguns in game and only has a fall off range of 12 meters making the sight on it more or less just a niche at best. As you can't get the fullest potential out of the thing.
---
Her secondary gadgets are underwhelming as they're literally useless. Ela is a very agressive mobile roamer. She needs to be to get the most out of her very limiting guns. She needs to be able to get the first drop on an enemy and catch them by surprise. As if she stays still she'll have a much harder chance of engaging them. She's very aggressive and mobile yet she's given two stationary gadgets she can't use much at all. Both being practically useless as they don't give her utility, nor any gain on an enemy. 
---
Her mines are underwhelming as they're very average for what they do. They're very good in late game situations when there's less enemies on the board but almost a mediocre piece of equipment for early game. They don't last long, only around an average of 5 seconds if only 1 goes off on an attacker. They're not plentiful, not hard to spot if you look for them, don't come with markers above them, and finally aren't very deadly. They don't need to be deadly but compared to every other trap they're very mediocre at best. Kapkan's trip wires take away half your health and are very loud as well as making a mini smoke screen which blinds the attacker. lesion's gu mines cause damage and a lot of it. If not removed manually the attacker will die, it takes much more time to remove as you need to find a safe area to remove the mine in which takes time, you can't run so even more time taken away. Even if you remove the mine you have a decent many more to worry about. Not to mention you act as a very appealing target to even the worst guns in the game. 
---
Ela in her current state of 8 nerfs and "1" buff is very underwhelming indeed. I say 1 in quotes as her vertical recoil buff was a buff. But in the same patch the recoil diamond becoming non existent really took any merit away from the buff at all. In my opinion Ela was heavily over nerfed and really deserves a buff or two to get her into a spot that's even called viable as currently she's definitely not in a good one. I main her and even I'll say this, she's one of the worst and weakest operators in game by a long shot.
---
2400 costs 79ILS, while buying the 1200 twice costs 78ILS
---
Loce how your using an xray mod aswell😂
---
Ye but they are adding on 270 in addition to 2400 so 79ILS is more of a bargain.
---

Jokes on you I have 2 and have been play for 3 years

Seriously, and he zoomed in on it? Like he’s that proud of saying “say hello to reddit.”
---
I want to feel you up, brother.
---
If I remember correctly, people found ways to abuse it so you could build up thousands of renown by leaving your system running (Whilst asleep or at school/college etc.) so Ubi nerfed solo T-Hunt so it wasn't even worth doing anymore to stop people abusing it. 
---
I guess people still could find a way to abuse it in matchmaking, but who knows.
---
He looks like Pablo Schreiber here.
---
Yep, when playing with at least one other person you get 100+ renown. Solo gives around 30
---
u/robohead101
---
Ash and glaz.  Ash because you probably have a tryhard aiming skills if you main ash and glaz cause it's not gonna make a difference.
---
Because it's impossible to measure everything you do to help your team win.  Some things could be counted (kills, gadget use), but you would be missing important things like how effective that gadget use was, droning for a teammate, making good callouts.  And you risk creating perverse incentives where what is best for your MMR isn't what is best for the team (do you spot on the cam and get credit for it or make a callout and get none?  Do you play it safe and increase your chance of winning the round or go kill-chasing in a 3v1?).
---
With a large enough sample, everything else should even out, leaving your W/L (and therefore your MMR) to be determined by your skill (including your skill at finding good players who want to play with you).
---
tavor as well
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I heard that it worked like a month or two ago. Wouldn't be surprising if it still works. The whole extracting hostage seem to be the fastest one.
---
Vigil's K1A feels alright with a suppressor.
---
I've seen people use a suppressor on Ying but idk if that's a strat or just a MeatyMarley thing.
---
Cav M12 suppressed synergizes with her 3 speed build and her primary gadget.
---
But when you're playing and down a teammate, don't you wish someone would 'join an ongoing match'? Your match?
---
Lol on the other hand the look Capitao is giving is like he’s realizing he’s getting to old for this.
---
Sucks but it is what it is. Send to be more prominent at beginning and end of seasons. Weird

Just buy a booster and play ranked or casual  rank doesn’t matter anymore it’s 2 weeks before season is over

Not really

That's the problem with online gaming.

Adults and children unfortunately have to play together.

It's a masterpiece.

Play ranked, no one takes it seriously anymore.

Yes. But people who team kill and then kick for no reason don't deserve a new teammate anyway and don't waste my time with their game.
---
Would be dope.
---
The year 3+ ops have artwork of their background next to their bio.

Would be great having the same for Base Ops and Y1 and Y2

You could say they flatlined

Yes. Instead of going close range, im spawnpeeking with it.

I guess that's fair. He's definitely changed but his content hasn't lost any of its appeal for me
---
And do a better job cropping
---
No need to rush for renown, just play ranked exclusively for the next 2 weeks and you should be fine.
---
If you only play ranked no one will ever see that.
---
Yes he is, he's the character that can pickup female only characters based on their period cycle. The closer she is to her period, the longer he can see her on the map.
---
I did something similar to this once when I was pretty new
---
I got an ace with recruit on Oregon once.
---
THE DRAGG
---
They really need to tweak the interaction tbh I would be fine if the hostage was immune to certain gadgets like the Vulcan shield, fire bolts, smoke grenades ya can't always control some of the AOE of the gadgets
---
So basically any point in the day
---
I don’t know what I’m supposed to be laughing at..
---
This is old, probs a spectate bug, if u arent maestro, if not idk
---
That would be..... interesting to say the least.
---
Well that makes me feel better for buying all the yeehaw packs just because I wanted Mavericks hat
---
I feel like they need to tone down the shemagh or make it look more like a shemagh rather than a little kid wearing a scarf that’s too big. Welders normally wear overalls that’s not OSHA standard!

For me I get wallbanged through five walls and the terrorists can teleport. Wtf is this

r/cursedimages ?
---
Uh just control the recoil. And burst fire. It's not that hard
---
There's a few reasons:
---
1. Allows Casual players to experience the game with the Ranked ruleset and map pool without having to actually worry about ELO.
---
2. Allows squads with a lot of MMR variance to play together without being forced to play Casual. This was needed with the new 1000 MMR rule in Ranked.
---
*pornhub intro plays*
---
Watch some YouTube, I think Rainbow overall has gotten to where even mid ranks are reeeeaaaaaaalllllllly good compared to when I started and I think a big part of that is probably because everyone learns everything without having to learn it by getting shit on by someone who already figured it out. I’ve never been anywhere near copper but I still have benefited a lot from various YouTubers. I think Get Flanked and Braction were a couple of the best for me when I wanted to get a little more serious about Rainbow because of the way they focus on “here are common mistakes, here’s what you should be doing, and here’s why” type things instead of just throwing trick after trick at you to memorize.

Pretty sure you need to download the app on your new phone, somehow get a barcode up from the authenticator app on your old phone, then scan the barcode using your new camera. This will make authenticator sync to your new device.

I claimed I was badass because I said that going to a high school with a stupid outfit isn't worth of respect and isn't funny?
---
An antidote most likely. Just a guess
---
yeah i noticed you replied to it after i posted that.
---
It sucks that maps are being taken out of casual but fuck house this map can go away forever and I'd be perfectly happy
---
I got Ash R4C and Twitch F2 with Black Ice and I know that’s really good but I don’t play either of those operators. I really wish I had it for the Commando and the L85 or even Bucks C8.
---
My biggest pet peeve is when people Tk you, or get you killed on purpose, then proceed to win, it brings me sadness.
---
What have you done to my poor Ela?
---
Maybe "massive" was an exaggeration, but why would people use a skin on alibi when it does in fact constitute a disadvantage. Also what you say is true, but reducing the quality of bait for a skin is in fact an issue, is it not? It's not about being creative, it's about solving an issue. Finding ways about the issue puts the burden on players to change their playstyle and not the Devs to make the doppelgangers look alike.
---
The cosplayer was indeed some British dude
---
2 speed would have made more sense, as soft-roam would fit him perfectly.
---
Got it the first time thanks
---
Wow omg that guy sure is rekted. We should just completely ignore the fact that Ubisoft sold the Year 4 pass without actually informing people that they will reuse weapons for every season except the first one. Let's not focus on that but just talk about how he owned some random dude on twitter.
---
Русский чтоль?
---
Storage lockers lives matter !
---
My friend would probably like this as he plays a lot of rainbow six siege. I don’t play it but it looks cool so I thought I’d look around on here
---
Overall sounds nice but it would be oberpowered in bomb dedusing situations
---
R6 I’d you want but left 4 dead or dead by daylight is fun
---
They're pushing fewer weapon skins, though, because they're starting to reuse weapons.
---
😎👍
---
This isn't terrorist hunt though
---
Kanal has taken 9 months to rework, give it a while before they consider adapting it based on feedback. Thats how it works, although I'm specifically looking at Hereford base right now.
---
Since you asked about tricks, the grenade and drone throw is the same speed and trajectory. I don't believe C4 shares this tho.
---
september 10th
---
How did that 2nd last guy not kill you he defo had time to backstab
---
Dronning isn't fun. Some people (me included) play casual Just to have Fun!
---
Nice job using xray
---
Yeah. Look next to the ubisoft logo
---
So does this come out when the new season starts?
---
The best part is it was a Jager.
---
Do you actually think you just invented the lord chanka meme wtf lol
---
Love that they went back to the older ops and fleshed out their character.
---
Completely different thing. Prisma is one model, headpiece and torso are not separate like on the player. They would have to create tens of prismas for all different cosmetic combinations and that it's not worth it.

WOW! I’m glad someone found this now because if that went into the live game that wouldn’t be cool.
---
It's not better if it's stupid
---
It’s still a huge advantage because of the window slits, you can peek it like a mirror.  It also really exposes attackers if they try and push through it because the vault sound is so obvious and easy to target.
---
Yes. Yes you are a joke to us
---
Thats so true
---
Terrorist and Article 5 are mixed in the same playlist to avoid long queues. You can play terrorist hunt and get this map with the gas.

Muzzle brake. It's what I use and it works well for me. Though you really wanna find what works for you so I'd suggest cycling between that, a compensator and flash hider until one sticks.

Gridlock she is actually slightly original and helps the team

*twitch takes off mask* IT IS I, THE REAL ASH!!

That’s a completely new product and an upgrade in tech. It’s not even close to the same thing.
---
Oh yes people who think the battle pass shouldn’t be monetized are going to kill this game. I guess we’re just going to completely ignore literally every other single thing that monetized in Siege already, you know everything? You’re quite literally pleading poverty for a company that is doing more than fine.
---
When did I say I invented it? Stop trying to be a dick over stupid shit guy it’s literally the dumbest shit ever.

He was used in Clubhouse with PMM and shield in like June

That's not even fuzes fault either those guys were idiots to charge in there like that.
---
yea man i feel the same. everyone is sad about house but in reality the map triggers nostalgia for everyone and they don't realize it's a shitty map.
---
How mind helping me
---
Yea hibanas gun if you fire full auto is gone in a sec just gotta keep the bursts short. And don’t shoot out barricades with it it takes a whole mag lol
---
You gonna zoom in and shoot confetti from 20m away? Or zoom into IQ's rear and fire a *tight spread*?
---
just because you consider it teaching doesn't make it not boosting.
---
if you want to teach your low level friends strats then you can show them in custom games or casual. you're telling yourself it's teaching but what you are doing is boosting, no other way around it.
---
That's the thing everything else looks the same.That is what threw me off at first.Kinda sucks it looked pretty sick when it was blue. I'm no eye doctor but maybe it has something to do with that specific  color

I bought standard pack cuz everybody told me to and it was to late when I realized starter pack’s name has changed to standard.

The shotguns in siege are some of the most inconsistent in any FPS games I've played, because of the bullet spread and other weird factors, like ads-ing, laser sights and current movement speed. They used to be way too strong but now they are super unpredictable I expect that you will find that sometimes firefights will be easy to win and other times they will seem downright impossible. As someone who has used shotguns a lot what I recommend is this,
---
1: make sure you have a secondary weapon equipped that you know you will be able to consistently win firefights with for any long range, mid range or direct firefights (by direct, I mean that an enemy knows your position and is a distance away that makes them a huge threat to someone using a shotty)
---
2. Use the shotgun only when you can be sure that you can get the first shot, the advantage of a shotgun is that if you catch anyone by suprise or can force them to take a hit you are at a huge advantage.
---
3. (Especially on defense) don't be affraid to run away if you aren't sure that you will be able to get any worth while picks. A lot of the time it's better to take longer to get a kill than risk only having a minor impact on the enemy team
---
4. Work out weather you should approach a fight ADSing with the shotty or using hip fire. Using the ADS function can reduce spread and help you guide your bullets into  the center of a target however, using hip fire is usually more beneficial if you think that you might have multiple targets or a target being super erratic because it will allow you to react faster to them (unless you are some sort of aim god, which considering ur using a shotty seems less likely (not an insult btw)) and as a result unload more shot into them faster.
---
5. Try to avoid sprinting when engaging, moving slowly greatly reduces the spread on all pellet shotguns so you have to try and reach a balance point where you are still a threat because you can have map presence whilst you are also a threat because you are going to be able to land shots. Moving slower also gives you a huge advantage in the sense that not only will it make you harder to hear before you blow someone's brains out, but it is also a very unpredictable strategy to most players, it seems very unintuitive but because of that it can SOMETIMES help you secure a kill on someone who gets surprised that they didn't hear you sprinting forward and getting the extra warning that you were coming for them.
---
6. Come to terms with the fact that sometimes the game is really gonna screw you over in a firefight with a shotgun but sometimes it will give you a probably undeserved win. It helps a lot once you can just accept that.
---
7. Don't underestimate the damage a shotgun can do, the in-game damage numbers don't really tell the whole story.
---
8. When picking a shotgun, speed, effective range and dmg are all important. The best shotguns in the game normally have a very high fire rate with a passable range with damage actually being the least important. Slower shotguns are really not recommended but if you use them then the most important actually becomes damage and then the other two (IN MY OPINION)
---
9. Don't forget about all of the wierd and wonderful ways your operator can help you get a kill with a shotty (with pulse it's kinda obvious) but with operators like alibi, lesion, kapkan, ela, frost, castle etc. Any way you can slow someone down, know where they are or distract them even for a split second is a moment of time when you can engage with that first shot and have a huge advantage in the fight.
---
Note: all of these are super situational lol, sometimes this stuff can help, sometimes it won't and sometimes it might be shitty advice in your current situation so good luck trying to find the best ways for you to secure kills with shottys in every situation you are in.
---
The SIX12-SD is ridiculously underrated. The best shotgun on offense bar none IMO. I use it in ranked all the time
---
A holy f*ck thats a massive amount of explosives coming right up.
---
I love it
---
Hello WolfgangxZ, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
There are a lot more items that you can get in Overwatch though, so the chance of you getting exactly what you want out of a loot box is slimmer. You may get a highlight animation, a voice line, a sticker, a skin, etc. When I get a Legendary in Siege I actually get excited, when I get a Legendary in Overwatch I wish it were coins so I could actually buy exactly what I want. But I still can't buy exactly what I want when it comes to the limited time packs. I don't quite understand why you're highlighting that you get free event loot boxes when it's just normal ones during a  limited time event, I still got normal skins and stuff from the summer one. But here's the thing, the people that make these skins? They have to get paid somehow. You can't buy Alpha Packs from siege until the event and the people that buy those, elite skins, and premium bundles/skins are the people that pay the entire team who works on Rainbow. So if you wanna bitch and whine about throwing $2 there way for a pretty fairly priced pack be my guest. But maybe you should realize, Ubisoft has over double the amount of employees than Blizzard has (4,500 BE and 9,000 Ubi) and Blizzard makes money off World of Warcraft's subscription based playerbase and many other games, what Ubisoft is only making money off DLC for AC and For Honor (pardon if I forgot any other games) and cosmetics for their games. So if $2 is too much for you to help support them then simply don't buy anything just don't complain at the same time. Albeit their business model could use work, their seasonal loot boxes are fairly priced and the outfits and weapon skins are of amazing quality. Call me a fan boy if you want but I'd be perfectly fine spending $20 a paycheck on this game.
---
and spooky woman slays with it too

Dang that sucks, you should contact ubi
---
Gimme those icons now

Me too

I kinda like this view. Restricts vision a bit more
---
If you have time to fiddle through the settings, OBS has one of the best and lightest screen captures better than shadowplay.
---
Just remember in REALISTIC they have aimbot and walls
---
Correct, It’s treated as a regular game. I think I’m down like 150MMR this season off DDOSing alone 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
So sledge just went from headstrong leader to casual, crazy leader.
---
Not happy. I preferred the previous bio.
---
Bruh dats a big suppressor
---
But you chose to pay for the skin. It’s not like playing Frost was locked behind a paywall. Swapping out the camera would have been a better call, and they might give her BW again later. Ether way, you chose to pay for her elite. I love Frost, she has one of my highest overall K/D ratios and is probably my favorite flex defender, but she’s not in elite gear because I chose not to spend the money. 
---
All and all this is a good shift for most people who run her.
---
Don't kink shame him
---
It THICC
---
&gt;No, he doesn't. Remember that the pass doesn't provide the content. The content is already in the game, and everybody has access to them. So what you paid was what you paid when you bought the game. 
---
Objectively incorrect.
---
The season pass pays for unlocking those operators without grinding AND getting them a week ahead of everyone else without a pass.
---
So it's still less value for money as there is less weapons they get an exclusive first hands on for paying.
---
Not to say I agree that it was ever possible to get that type of 1 week advantage but I can see why one be jaded.
---
&gt;Ubi told the pass buyers what you'll get with the pass. You get new ops and extra stuff. Nothing about guns. Just ops. And the ops are new. It's not like they released Buck or Frost again.
---
Well I question that in regards to Nokk who is basically a worse Vigil on attack.
---
&gt;Ubi isn't at fault. Literally not at all. They delivered what they promised on the webpage. Deadf**k kids can't understand, and that is not Ubi's problem.
---
The charged the same price for the season pass, but it objectively has less value for money.
---
That is their fault, and while I personally don't care (and i bought the season pass for the first time this year) he has a valid point.
---
Stop brushing off his arguments because you don't care about recycled weapons.
---
He killed them all by mind controlling fuze.
---
I understand that people want this, and it would be cool, but if you're using Prismas in this fashion, you deserve to get shot.

It fits the snekybeky-ness

---
&gt;Objectively incorrect.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The season pass pays for unlocking those operators without grinding AND getting them a week ahead of everyone else without a pass.
---
&gt;So it's still less value for money.
---
That value is dependent on the player. No promises were made for the specificities of the ops. Just the ops themselves. Which we already paid for at the start. You pay for a package of benefits, VOLUNTARILY, to support the game. Rather you pay to support the game VOLUNTARILY and are rewarded with benefits, and some op specific benefits. So you decide the value. The real value hasn't changed at all.
---
&gt;Well I question that in regards to Nokk who is basically a worse Vigil on attack.
---
She's ain't vigil. Period. She's Cav+vigil, well designed but badly optimised. She'll see a buff soon.
---
&gt;The charged the same price for the season pass, but it objectively has less value for money.
---
Again, terms and conditions of the pass were met, so it is these kids that overhype the value.
---
&gt;That is their fault, and while I personally don't care (and i bought the season pass for the first time this year) he has a valid point.
---
&gt;Stop brushing off his arguments because you don't care about recycled weapons.
---
I'm not brushing off his arguments because they are about guns. I couldn't care less about a rando's whine about virtual weapons of mass destruction not being "unique". I'm brushing him off because his argument lacks logic, is self contradictory, and pointless.
---
Back when you could go to overtime by tying the round at match point I finished the game with 28 kills 2 aces lost the match 6-7

I like how you bots always say use the TTS subreddit for this stuff, but in regular r/Rainbow6 there's a TTS flair

Definitely, you can cover an angle where the doorways can't peek you but you can drop an AOE on them and burn out anyone who tries to push.

Even better put your gadget behind a castle barricade and watch the breach team kill themselves going for the Ash rush.
---
by gadget you mean a c4?
---
this is probably rank silver gameplay on console...

I thought it was only supposed to count as a shotgun?

I didn't think anyone past the age of like 6 stood up while playing video games 😅😅

No. The issue with her is she doesnt mimick skins or camos, she can only be standing up, and the penalty for shooting a fake one is pretty much non existant. You must be a silver or gold player because up in higher plat she is useless in terms of her gadget.
---
#LIBTARD DESTROYED
---
Lmao the most change we've gotten to guns that affects how people play is when Bandit and Jager got their ACOG's removed.
---
The attachments are more influential than the guns, you could take the UMP, one of the worst guns on defence, slap an ACOG on it, and I guarantee you we'll see Pulse spawn peeks even in Pro League.
---
Like the gun doesn't really make a huge difference. Gadgets are everything though.
---
New guns mainly provide minor changes to gameplay. Never anything major though.
---
I dont think a silver is qualified to speak about higher level play :)
---

I like the current one though, just the blue streaks in her natural hair colour. Plus the blue is from grom!
---
All the change was adding a icon to let you know if you were under the effect of an EMP (you’re reticle is gone or you are playing vigil pulse or warden and can’t use your gadgets)

Yes

Like there are so many gadgets that can make you win games and/or fights you would lose otherwise
---
It was indeed.
---
I wonder if they will actually listen to the community and swap or add that gun for her
---
Yes he does
---
You cant place down bandit charges if you get hit by it therefore bandit tricking is unable to be done
---
Why tf are you all running supressors though lmao
---
Sure a high kill game is great... but from my experience in my glory days is.. nothing beats a team that can coordinate and get plants off. I remember I would carry the hell out of my teammates but if the other team can equally do their part, nothing will really beat that. Siege is about teamwork and I learned that the hard way when I struggled to find my squad until I finally found that. You can’t just get lots of kills and expect to win, planting and working as a team really wins you games.
---
IT HAS DOORS
---
Reminds me of just stacking bodies in Vegas 2 😂
---
I’m pretty sure you still can, that’s what a lot of people are saying.
---
Sweaty alpha 22
---
Yeah definitely especially because everyone knows fuze has 3 cluster grenades and the tube just did 2 so obviously he’s gonna do another
---
It’s almost like DPS is partially dependent on rate of fire
---
I'm calling you clueless because you actually believe that Ubisoft are likely too lazy to make new weapons when they spent months upon months on maps, operators, and cosmetics, but weapons, which are the only component of this game they're required to license due to strict trademark laws on nominative fair use, are where they're not putting in work. 
---
You have a Mira main flair. You're aware that Ubi had to pay, likely out the ass, to get the Vector in the game? The patent on that gun is not even 20 years old.

didn't get this comment, are you implying I'm silver?

Yesss. you can spam it tho and two hits is enough to kill.
---
Rare footage of other point of view
---
Judging by the fact that warden is losing his impacts and not getting the P90, I would say they don’t care.
---
I main gridlock and I approve this message
---
Has there been any confirmation because I've seen a few people say the emp will prevent you from placing a battery down
---
It’s almost like what I mean is that ar33 is preferable because higher rate of fire means a better chance for a headshot
---
Nah, thatch only needs the pistol. Who needs a bullet throwing machine gun when you got a beauty called the p226
---
I’ve got mine set to 5 minutes then I just crop the video
---
As said somewhere else in this thread, you gotta have both to win. Take Caveira for example, you can lurk and sneak and get in the perfect position but if you fuck up your shots (as i often do) then it doesnt matter
---
We have reached got tier levels of bm
---
I feel like the people who are complaining about the lack of new guns are the same people who complain about the “unrealistic” cosmetics and “ma immersion”.
---
I mean I’m doing that... but why put a bandaid over a wound and not just stitch it up aka, buff the fucking gun
---
God damn you wouldn’t know how triggered I would be if I was one of those attackers

All of these are cool and I do wish we had more Ela hair dye options, but I'm cool with the current Elite color.

I think people didn't see a proper proof yet
---
People see kills all the time whether its in game or YouTube or other platforms. Typically people show clutches or spawn peeks or great gadget placements or multikills or sneaky kills because it gets people interested. Just showing a compilation of kills... You know what I mean? 
---
This isnt a shame post. If you made this and ate proud then more power to you. But if you want to grab peoples attention you gotta do something more shocking.
---
I have very good game sense but my aim is bad.

What barrel are you using? Take the barrel off , for example on Ash’s R4-c , the muzzle flash is a fat star shaped one, not dissimilar to the friggin assault rifle in Goldeneye.

This isn't the only game people complain about this problem. If enough people complain, leave or both Sony will be forced to do something.

well i have, but then they still would go on about the same thing over and over again...

Oh baby r6 is long from going anywhere lol
---
lol ill try this, ty
---
That was so gross, good work
---
DM me
---
Cheesy ass strat
---
You should get R6, with the new season coming out there will be a boost to the amount of players playing. Also siege has a 10 year life span that the devs want to complete so it would be a long time that you would have to wait for the new game
---
This community has been going for 3 years strong lol it's not going any where. PS: I also play on the PS4 as well. I've never had a problem finding a match.
---
Hehe, I like making people fly. My friends get scared whenever they hear an FO-12 as well.
---
People have been complaining years and the adapter has been out for years, ever since ps3 actually. So I really don't see them doing much about it
---
i've told them this millions of times, but they still think that its just any old shooting game. My parents are really stubborn btw
---
It's harder to do that on console but I could definitely try that more often.
---
Can confirm more more more and even more than any one tap or bustin a fat nut
---
Except they're not fixing it. They're implementing a very soft 'fix' that will still allow Plat 3's to queue with Silver 1's. Aka instead of going to copper they'll just go to Silver 1 to boost. Nothing is fixed.
---
I remember this time in my siege career on xbox it was interesting to say the least all I can say is put yourself in more of that position it really helps you keep your cool cause I remember when I got worked up cause it would be a 1v5 and I’d always die because I was freaking out, but after a year of playing the game and getting in more 1v4 and 1v5 situations I finally got my first ace and then went to pc

But you go right ahead and keep insulting anyone who mildly disagrees with you like a stuck up twat.
---
&gt;The devs have gotten lazy and fucking lie to cover it up.
---
I mean it's certainly possible, but licensing guns, 3D modelling, animating etc all take a lot of time, and frankly, we already have 100 unique guns or some shit, when will it be enough?
---
Guns also are free content, you don't pay a dime for guns, so essentially what you're complaining about is free content... Which is just insane imo.

Can confirm even more more more more more more more

Hmmm, maybe ill let my parents give it a try for themselves, and see how that turns out. Then ill probably slowly tell them this. thanks

Is smoke working for the bad guys? Bc in the intro video thingy for all of rainbow it showed a load of identical gas canisters being put into a box by the white mask twats

God my sister is pissed that I brought this up when we were sleeping together.

Sweet man so i guess that its fine then. I mean i don't even play console so it doesn't affect me. The point is if more people complain then things will change
---
The other guy must be happy

He has the SAS recruit with him
---
No I’m complaining that they are lying about licensing and balancing being issues (it’s not and if balance is an issue that means guns are important) it will be enough when they stop selling battle passes, season passes, elites, skins, limited packs and esports skins. They literally have the most possible micro transactions you can have and when budget cuts roll around the consumer friendly stuff gets tanked and this sub will just roll over and open its wallets.

Giving anyone other than ops like Glaz or Clash machine pistols was a mistake.

UBI DOES NOT MAINTAIN THEIR OWN SERVERS. If you want servers anywhere around the world you need to go bitch at microsoft, Ubi just pays to use microsoft servers.

I know they like to cycle the legendary rewards ever 2 months or something like that so an accurate list isn't exactly possible, but I did see a post from a year or so ago that had them on it, although a lot of them were also exclusives (alpha testing, ranked charms, etc) as for your math, I appreciate the dedication too it, but there's a lot more to it than that. Say there are a hundred people, out of those hundred, after a win only 2% of them get an alpha pack.
---
 Another game, that's 4% getting an alpha pack, so since 2 have already gotten an alpha pack, it's highly unlikely they'll get another one. Let's just say they didn't get lucky and get another, 98 people, only 4% get a pack. 
---
That's about 3.92% so 4 people would most likely still get a pack. That's 6 people. 
---
6% for 94 people, 5.63% 6 people. So 12 people after 3 games has an alpha pack. 
---
8% for 88 is 7.04, 19 people after 4 games 
---
10% for 81 is 8.1, 27 people after for games 
---
However all that isn't exactly necessary as we all know, the percent chance isn't necessarily guaranteed, you could play 100 games and not get that 2% chance, you could get 2 in a row, anything could happen. Also, I looked up the time to level up on Overwatch, I personally suck at it so I don't level up a lot, but I read from a few people it takes them anywhere between 1.5 hours and 3 hours to level up (obviously the 3 hours is probably a noob like me) everyone has different tastes in their type of gamble I suppose, I personally prefer Siege over OW just because even if I go 0-4 I still get that 2% extra chance which really does add up. I average around 15 alpha packs a week, and I really slowed down on Siege in the past couple months, just started playing again after the outrage with Apex, as for OW I gotta take your word for it because as a level 15 whose top character is Bastion, I don't think I have much experience in their loot box and time to level systems.

Now in general, I definitely think that Goyo fire should kill the hostage and penalize whoever shot it. This, though... This ain't ok.
---
OSHA would not approve

When did I ever say it's fine? I'm just saying nothing is probably going to get done because the adapters have been out for years and Sony has licensed one. You taking what I'm saying the wrong way.

Holy shit, you ok there bud? Got some personal issues going on ? That’s an extreme over reaction to a simple comment. Why do I even exist? Bit much don’t you think?

They only did this so mozzie seems taller

Change placements of drone to advanced.Change also sensivity of aim using scope
---
Or, hear me out, people just don't play him on hostage? Like people have never complained about not being able to use fuze on hostage. If I'm remembering correctly Smokes gas has also always hurt the hostage as well, but people haven't been complaining.
---
MMR* and I like that guys name, l-lentai
---
I remember someone tried to argue that team killing shouldn’t be in siege but think about it. Somebody hops on your Tachanka turret and won’t hop off. Or somebody is trolling so you just have to kill the guy.
---
I have no idea, I encountered him in casual because I don't like to play ranked. I didn't even realize he wasn't even a high enough level to play ranked so now I'm even more confused.

You seem to have really good aim, the only thing u should try to improve on is which way u lean but apart from that, I felt like I was watching a high gold player, maybe even a low plat 3

What?

I get that no need to be rude but I said console* not pc not gonna spend 100$ for a special usb adapter to play with m&amp;k on the PS4  on it
---
Same :(
---
AWESOME
---
No it’s not at least you have one :(
---
Idk while this is definitely usually the best way to use it, it's good to mixup every now and then. Sometimes one in a weird spot on site will mess someone up trying to clutch I've noticed.
---
Yeah I agree, team killing should be in the game but I really only do it when I'm playing with my friends and we're joking around.
---
attacker next season should have their own weapon
---
Oh right, lol I was thinking it was seasonal
---
I mean they couldn't have done it from the start.  There wouldn't be enough Ops to use all the guns.  I'm sure they got to a certain amount and thought alright we can mix and match guns now that we have a good variety.
---
I think the main reason people are so bothered is because they simply don't like change, feel like Ubi is getting lazy and/or feel like they are getting less "content" in the game.
---
Yeah what. Literally a 6 second google search will show you all of those existing in the real world.
---
AR 33 got a recoil buff with grim sky. It's really easy to control now

I get it, I just dont think its funny

I wouldn't call it free, I bought the season pass and new operators having new guns was something most people expected.

Tbh I was trying to find the best way to showcase the skins and I kinda forgot to unmirror the white version.
---
You're a couple decades behind...
---
papa bear
---
That is true, but when you come up against a team whose aim is as good as yours and can use gadgets you'll lose. How many pro teams are at the top just for their aim? It's never just about one or the other.

I hate that the last for operators are reused guns, like guns are such a uniq thing of an operator, and is a large psrt of the operators way of playing and not having uniq guns just makes me feel like i am just playing a reused characther
---
At least you didn't get kicked for it
---
Can I get a hint?
---
U mean add blonde where the blue is on the normal elite skin?

Its ironic you’ve decided to say the same thing on every comment of mine. Get a life

No one gonna talk about the miami hotline-esk meme background aswell?

Warden
---
I'm not mad about new guns, I'm fine with it. I just wish they at least give 1 good option for both attacker and defender, re-used or not. The defender is getting two good guns, and the attacker is getting two meh guns. Last season nook got two shit guns (for attacker, the SMG is alright on defence)
---
Please keep it down, they might nerf Blackbeard again!
---
yes.
---
I always thought it would look better if the colours changed
---
It's ironic that the child crying about guns in a video game is telling me to get a life lol. Hard day in middle school today? It's also ironic you've literally stated the same thing about 6 times in this thread but it's only ok if you do it? Odd.

You better have used the FO-12 because the Scorpion is the worst primary in game.
---
Oh thank God I was so worried....

Oh.... jayy just made a video with that and said to visit it and i didnt find it i just saw this and wanted to see what was going on so😂
---
Wait you can play a secure still in ranked?
---
I never said it didn’t offer value over a period of time as after they got their shit together they did. What I am saying is that they do not need monetization as everything in the game is already monetized. I’m sorry but a season pass and battle pass would be too much for any normally without even bringing up the rest of the monetization. As far as I can tell they’re not hurting for money and have done nothing but recycle abilities, guns, and maps for the this season so far so they are not getting a pass for this from me.
---
Your view on cosmetics continue to make me sad. You’re basically stating that art departments aren’t important and that they only thing that matters in a game is the barebone mechanics.

It's better when they're new to DDoS and they boot themselves and cant join back hahaha

Not completely true as C7E is ran over PDW most of the time.
---
I didn’t mean literally snipe lmao. Figure of speech my man
---
Not exactly.
---
The M249 is a real LMG, it just can't feed stanag mags (the mag well is there but "pliers and a hammer" becomes the new cycling system), the Roni is a real conversion kit it just is for a Glock not the CZ it uses in the game (if you look on the in-game model the ejection ports even don't line up because they put a gun that doesn't fit in it!), the Deagle is famously unreliable to the point having a not uncommon complete failure after a single magazine, the PDW9 can't feed the Glock mag it uses in game reliably, and features a burstfire the real gun lacks, the Automag is not only out of production (like the SPAS12 that Valk uses) but is also famously unreliable (Deep Impact had a diver on staff to retrieve it because of how Eastwood would chuck it off the peer every time it jammed) and the Saritch never had anything made that wasn't a wooden mock up.  The entire design is basically visually a copy of a wooden wish list.
---
These examples fall under the "largely fake" or the "unrealistic" classification, the M249, Roni, and Saritch being the formeer and the Deagle, PDW-9, and Automag being the latter.
---
I mean I like it but if everyone else hates it then shit so do I, fuck this menu😂

Ngl it stroked ny ego a bit

Is it really that hard for people to aim on console? I feel like I constantly get headshots and I play on Xbox.

If anything I'm jealous of people who can hear normally. As a hard of hearing person I have to play with someone or I'd never know which side of the room you're hitting me from. I can't even hear that barbed wire he was looking at that I assume jiggled.

See this is what I mean, you say no others say yes.

Do you own the game on on steam store as well as ubi store?

No it's just under utilized. It got quite a fair bit of play at Raleigh. It has a faster rpm and ttk.
---
Yea but people still get butt hurt because Gridlock uses Capitao's LMG and the Aussie variant of IQ's Aug, and Mozzie's Roni uses the same pistol as the Grom even though it's built for glocks.

Where does it say that the Terrorist attack uses the same chemical compound as Smoke's cannisters?
---
Can't distract them with a bullet in your head cuz u lost the gun fight
---
OI. I see you bitch
---
wildlands has much more guns than this. Honestly we could use a gun or two a patch that's new, imo. Next year will probably be like that, but I'm fully expecting either new guns for Nokk and Warden to make them viable, or better existing weapons for them
---
"frequent updates" lmao
---
In my opinion it's not really the fact that they're recycled is more that from a character standpoint, each operator chooses their personal weapons and that's why each are unique. Not to mention in an fps the gun is on screen at all times so it basically becomes your "character"
---
Hide and delay them until they either have to stick the defuse or sit still.
---
May I ask why? 3/4 attackers go into a room at once because everyone is greedy for a kill, I would be triggered if I was Fuze.
---
What i guess is this sub rules says otherwise
---
And hey I’m excited to see what the new Ops bring to the table. They seem interesting and more better than Noct and Warden. Licensing guns? Fair enough as long as it doesn’t turn into a long standing issue. Kanal? Ehhh idk I’d have preferred to see brand new map after we just got a reworked map instead of something new. And why shouldn’t I expect a new map? I mean is that the whole point of the constant monetization?
---
Wait wait wait when did I say I expect free skins for the life time of the game? I said it saddens me that you find cosmetics to seemingly be throw away assets that hold no value compared to gameplay. Hell I own 9 elite skins that I’ve purchased at separate times due to the fact I love the game. Additionally have you ever played a game with a battle pass before? If you have you and I both know how bare bones the free track generally is compared to the premium track which doesn’t bother me in games like Fortnight or Apex Legends which are free to play. This game is not and also has a $30 season every season that doesn’t give you much past early access to operators and a slight discount in the store. My sense of entitlement? How the fuck am I being entitled? Literally everything in this game is already monetized to high hell and I’m entitled because I don’t like them adding ANOTHER F2P payment tactic to their premium priced product?
---
Yeah that’s high plat on PS4. Only way to win is to defend second and win all 3 rounds and then win the defending overtime rounds. We almost won against a team like that then they kicked everyone offline
---
all  **Outbreak**  post need a upvote , oh boi 😭outbreak thx dude
---
Seeing silencers on more shotguns would be great, something about a buckshot of death that you can't hear that appeals to me.
---
That's what mind games are for.
---
They go to plant you trundle up, they stop planting to hunt you you back off.
---
Repeat ad nauseum.  You wouldn't believe how many thirsty carriers I've seen cost their team the round cuz they went for a kill over a plant at 2 seconds.
---
Or pick Echo, Maestro, Smoke, Lesion, etc and use your gadget to damage/kill them.  Won more than a few games that way too. 
---
Especially with a Gu mine, cuz now they got *three* things to worry about, can they plant before the needle kills them, can they get the needle out before you push them or time runs out, can they kill you before the needle kills them or time runs out.

I don't have an issue with them increasing the contrast, kinda like the elite skins but it should be at least a little darker. Maybe it could have a dark to light gradient from bottom to top?

I did a sort of list on my youtube : https://youtu.be/A9AfkAIAFuI

My post constantly get's deleted. But, I bought the ultimate edition of the game ($140) and I was wondering if I would be getting the battlepass and the year 5 pass?

"Glass filled turd" implies you must find someone else just as equally enraged, have them eat glass and shit it so you could then eat the glass turd, shit it and then the other person eat your glass filled turd turd....and this simba.... is the circle of life

My guy, ddossers cannot get tracked down and no feature can be made to any server to fix it. It's never been done before and it isn't ubisoft's fault, its trashy people who need cheats to feel good. Don't blame ubi
---
Why did you make me see it
---
Nokk still has a gun though, what you've said has nothing to do with the post.
---
I know I was just saying it's literally impossible to do so and both the shotguns listed are very mediocre for range.
---
R6 tracker
---
Data limits. I dont know the ins and outs but from what i understand the game is getting to big.
---
Ubi has to get licences for guns. If they don’t get one, they can’t put that gun into the game. But the better question is: Why does Ubi not Design own weapons?
---
Thought you were being a sarcastic fuck. Still looked it up smh. Thx either way then I guess
---
What is the point of the $30 season pass then? What is the point of buying that when you have to buy a completely different pass to actually get everything for that season? Jesus Christ it’s literally a subscription on top of a subscription!
---
Ok but why not put recruit! He has smg-11 too!
---
Whats up with these small, completely unneccesary changes?
---
If you haven't gotten either you're probably new, get blackbeard and just use him for a while, he'd pretty op and will help you get better at the game a lot.
---
Free skins, and other rewards, even if I don't buy the bp
---
The thing is, the L85 is still a great gun. I however find the AR33 easier to control. And that's my point. He's got two really good primaries. The L85 I think is better for a slower methodical player. I find the AR33 better when I'm running point for a hard breacher as it's fire rate makes it better for close encounters. 
---
Then you give him one of the best secondaries in the game? It would be too much
---
Ok refer to original comment here I said partially
---
Thanks. I miss the it :(
---
Even better then before
---
Recoil is terrible that’s why I don’t use it
---
Okay then what happens when someone pushes you mid round what are u gonna do you have to be able to win gunfights yes game sense is need but gun play is also important

If only he wasn’t banned every ranked match 😫

A YouTube video about this https://youtu.be/7zQDjWVVgrg

You also shouldn't post pictures of the scoreboard as per the rules of the sub, yet no one follows it

By that logic everyone should have fucking amazing and OP guns, because it doesn't matter if they're too powerful right?
---
You want less M&amp;K by allowing even more to join in??
---
Why didn't any of them plant the bomb?
---
Why are you asking me? I don’t have any influence lol Ubisoft needs to come up with this. But personally if it was a medieval skin it would be cool if he like extended his shield and just stood there, if you watch his op video it’s really laid back and he’s very solemn
---
That was short and concise, did not know about the 6 parts and the visual aid was useful. I appreciate this, even more so for not taking five minutes to explain it
---
Is there anyway to report or something.
---
That’s it? I don’t get what your saying?
---
Why are you repeating what he said?
---
I run angled grip whenever I can. Considering we dont have point fire if does way more than make mag dumps easier.
---
Ah, you are a fellow man of roblox culture, I see
---
In Britain they use feet and inches
---
I just want to give Console players the option to consent to playing with PC players. If a team of 5 has all controller players on their team then they should vs 5 controller players. If a team of 4 controller players has a M&amp;K on their team that they have consented to then they play with PC players or Console players that have also consented to playing with a M&amp;K players.

He looks fine by me, r4c recoil even on console is unexistant, the fast flicks can easily be achieved with high sensitivity. Nothing out of the ordinary here

So we gonna forget fact that even orginal ops are reusing guns all orginal defenders except SAS and GSG9 have the same weapon loadout ffs

I’m also a Xbox player and I can almost 100% guarantee he won’t get banned because Ubisoft doesn’t give a shit about m&amp;k playing and cheating on siege Xbox

Plat 2
---
They don’t care about mouse and keyboard users unfortunately. Why I stopped playing the game because once you get up to the higher levels,me with a controller is at a disadvantage. I play console because everyone is supposed to be on the same playing field.
---
Ouch. I would be getting into an argument with you about this but it really is the truth
---
I literally don't get taking maps out of causal. They said something about newbies learning the map, don't we have a green potato playlist for them already with a reduced map rotation? what the fuck ubi.
---
I criticised a flawed viewpoint, and the guy clearly doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
---
Ohohoh
---
Nice
---
I’d almost be willing to let that happen so these fake Diamonds on Console can get put down a few notches and then brag about how good they are. Even G2 Pengu has experimented with M&amp;K on console and said “This is outright cheating.”
---
It *affects* the game but not decides who will win.
---
Put a team of skilled no life bois against a team of gadget nerds and the latter will be demolished.
---
I completely agree.  There are a lot of weapons.  just switching Operators each round will allow you to play a new gun all night.  Its not like there are only a few.  
---
I dont understand the complaints myself.  Since most people main 2-5 characters anyway.  They jummp on the bandwagon of a new character for like 2 weeks post release then go back to there mains.  Or adopt one of the op's as a main.
---
Every player above plat 3 looks like this lmfao he’s definitely on a controller
---
I was just agreeing with the guy it was a rhetorical question but that's impossible to tell through text
---
I honestly dont care all about it tbh
---
Only love I’ve gone through it themselves
---
I watched a vid by varsity and it was sad cuz he went 18 and 2 and his teammates did nothing and still lost

For me we should at least get one unique gun idc about rest they  can be reused but not even one unique gun just feel lazy

these things cant be fixed, similar to ddosing

old looks more gritty, I prefer the new layout, looks more clean and modern, maybe the sky is a bit too bright but makes for a good contrast between background. Maybe it looks a bit unreal and sterile now.

The Deployable Shield rework might just work with Warden though. I don’t think he’s losing any versatility, at least not in terms of secondary gadgets.
---
What the fuck is the point of this post may i ask
---
Exactly lol the gold peaks think everyone with decent movement is cheating in some way
---
The issue with this is XIMs. The plug-in directly takes MnK input and reworks it to mimic a controller, and there's no getting around that. As for cross platform, frame rates, fov, and aspect ratios are all exclusive to PC, there's too much of an advantage to PC players ignoring the fact that recoil and movement are already favoring them.
---
This guy is fine. Nothing out of the ordinary here tbh
---
They would let you turn it off as all games do so the Mouse and keyboard users would just turn it off. Doing nothing
---
We got trashed on but oh my
---
That is a DDoS and yes its a big problem this season sadly
---
Im never gonna remove it &lt;3
---
How is it a boomer movie if it came out in 2001?
---
Not technically a spawnpeek but a dummy good angle
---
The classic:
---
hE kIlLeD mE, hE mUsT bE uSiNg M&amp;k Or MaCrOs
---
They confirmed they were trying to rework him over a year ago where have you been
---
So just reduce the router firewall my pc
---
I think it’s weird that every Gun shoots in like a burst with no recoil.
---
No he's the one taking the photo lol, I got to be the one covering the K.
---
DDOS attacks can't be fixed by ubi. Microsoft hosts azure servers, that's what is getting attacked. Maybe make it difficult to determine which server is being used for the game making it harder to target it?
---
I don't play to much lately with all the WoW content out/coming but I have good success on low plat with her all the time. Not having an AR hurts sometimes but there are absolutely uses for hey gadget y'all are sleeping on
---
Vigil hasn't had two primaries for a long time.
---
Ewww, ez user
---
So action club roughly
---
Nah it’s blowing up on tik tok as a challenge or something
---
No, you were looking to be an ass.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
man of culture
---
I did say above that only Controller users would have the option to turn off playing against PC/M&amp;K users. A M&amp;K user on the other hand would not have this option.
---
People really can't understand that they can't add to many guns
---
Hard to say. They need a sort of licence to launch more weapons. No one knows for sure sadly.
---
If you play this game long enough, no gun actually has recoil, it's easy to grind its pattern in thunt and what makes the r4c so good is it has no recoil from the start
---
I watch it so infrequently I didn't know that. All I know was I never saw her in the most recent major. Thanks for the info.
---
safe bets would be echo and maverick
---
lol people who are good at this game shouldn't be bothered by one PLEB on their team.
---
I thought they are protected against DDOS attacks. I still have his nickname, can support do anything to him at this point?
---
u/Gaming-Is-Cool
---
They must be saving some data with that for new gadjets Kappa
---
Sure dont worry, just thought id clear things up
---
How exactly has Fortnite, the dumbest game in History done it, and it’s free lmao?!
---
Like the other 10000 posts . He looks like the one from Sierra paradise outbreak trailer
---
I love the shroud hoodie on Mute lol
---
Wow it keeps getting worse... remember the old full body pictures? good old days
---
Against a well coordinated team your team of recruits wouldn't even get in the building.
---
Yeah they made it very good. On the right from me you see Valk.  There Was mozzie, ash and castle too. And other op that i forgot
---
Of course it should.  But it should punish the person who put the hostage in the fire, not the original owner of the fire.
---
If a defender uses the hostage as cover and I shoot the hostage while firing at him, my team loses.
---
If I drag a hostage into capitao's fire, my team loses.
---
If I drag a hostage into Goyo's fire, my team should lose.  If I break goyo's fire onto the hostage, my team should lose, the same way we would if I fired a firebolt or threw a frag at the hostage.
---
That guy is super racist eww
---
Of course that argument does tend to fall a little flat, namely with the defenders and the SAS.  
---
The L85 is quite often the better and more common pick over the AR33 so you can't use that to determine if it's a Sledge or Thatcher on the field until a gadget is used.  Then the defenders frequently use the same gun.  The UMP, P90, MP5, SMG-11 and VSN 9x19 are all shared between the Ops of each CTU.  Plus the MP5SD shares the same suppressed sound as a suppressed MP5 on Doc or Rook, and IIRC the Mute's MP5k and the GIGN MP5 also share the same sounds.
---
Looks like school yearbook photos
---
So he can breath underwater and the condit shoots enemy’s?! Too op plz nerf
---
Probably because it would take longer to get DMCA’d opposed to YouTube.
---
Maybe we’ll see this strat next lan
---
Oh crap, didn’t know that. That’s actually way cooler than I thought, when I tested her I thought her only utility was windows!
---
I will upvote for you so this reaches the mods
---
It looks ugly but i think we'll get used to it.
---

It is, definitely

Nope, it's a game changer for sure

Mortal kombat!! Dun dun dun dundun dun dun dun doo doo do do do doo do doo do do do do do.
---
People only choose the ar-33 over the L8 because only thatcher has it lol
---
Balancing and bug updates are good for the game but it's not anywhere near content.
---
Dude almost typed allah in chat smh
---
It’s not gone yet
---
I believed I had it as well 😂
---
Yeah she’s really cute
---
One look at our post history is enough to confirm he's a totally different person.
---
He's posting on PC master race and I'm posting on r/halo and Halo is an xbox exclusive. 
---
But as this chain has proven not a single one of you has any form of critical thinking or reasoning.
---
Some people, believe it or not, are actually capable of thinking about things from other people's perspectives even if we don't agree with them.
---
I know, it's like I'm a fucking wizard or something.

You clearly are if you don't know what an analogy is, you're so fucking stupid it's kind of mesmerizing. You can't read, you have no argument, I'm honestly surprised you can vaguely spell correctly. 
---
Imagine being so fucking stupid that you can read but choose not to read someones response and just make up random shit, couldn't be me but apparently it is you
---
I think the new ops look good and new kanal looks fun
---
Man I just wish the new attack could use a pistol
---
Sau played against shroud in the creators cup at the Raleigh Major on Sunday past, got a couple kills on him!
---
https://youtu.be/fXEmbUkDkgo
---
Burnt Horizon actually. It was only tts several months before that as well
---
I think I prefer the dark background, but I like that they’re mixing it up. The white doesn’t look awful
---
This is how it looks now? Ew
---
Your analogy has to make sense if it is to work in the current context. You have no argument other than confirmation bias with no desire to see whether or not that is the case. 
---
Ya I choose not to read things that make no fucking sense
---
I get what you're saying but in the long run it really just doesn't matter at all IMO, the colour of an ops background does not alter the game at all.
---
I just want to play as Anton Chigurh.
---
Why he 3 feet tall tho
---
we all know they ain't porting their game to a new engine and this AC engine wasn't meant for shooting games soo, idk :(
---
Idk
---
They aint even add a map
---
Same with the current season
---
God the artists need to stop changing stuff that literally no one has asked for.
---
Ubi should make it so you can play any map ever made in custum
---
Check Microwave gaming channel, he uploaded all new Ember Rise legendaries.
---
(That is were I saw it)
---
r/boneappletea
---
If you get the chance, play with Dok and Kaid for and bit, then try the AR50 and you'll notice the side recoil it has. If they want to give it more and take the side recoil away along with the damage increase I'd be a ok with that
---
The battle pass is just stupid
---
It’s worth 1800 R6 credits but it was just a visual glitch so don’t worry
---
Lion has sledges hammer Jesus
---
But where will we find a Heart of the sea?
---
Why is mozzie, the shortest op in the game, the tallest on the op portraits?
---
Let's be real the gadgets are useless
---
How doesn't it make sense? Are you actually this fucking stupid lmaooo, and no you're just so dumb you can't process what I'm saying, I say "how do you test if Shroud actually has a god level of aim" your response "yOU jUsT TeSt It" "how exactly do you test it?" "yOu HaVE nO ArGueMenT, aND mAkE No SeNse"
---
I have you one way of testing it. 
---
What have you given other than “shroud isn’t as good as people think he is.”
---
Nothing. Nothing at all.
---
You’re a good friend man. Hope your buddy does well and you get to hang real soon!
---
He talks a lot of crap for a 2700 mmr
---
Bro they totally reworked kanal, it's not even the same map anymore
---
Love the show but disliked for not giving it to the Spanish ops
---
Like, the country that the show is set in?????
---
Yeah you can’t go past 9 rounds but back before operation health when you could “draw” rounds if you drew at 4-4 you played  up till 13 rounds
---
Oh man the most thinly veiled excuses.  Cuz it's not like alts ever are used to post to different subs to obfuscate user history or circumvent bans or anything!
---
Funny that you claim to be a /r/halo regular yet are apparently unaware that that sub's been losing its collective shit over MCC coming to PC the past year.  But hey what would I know, I'm just [definitely a bigger Halo nerd than you](https://m.imgur.com/a/cAJjp)
---
Of course the other amusing thing is you talking about "understanding other people's perspectives" while completely wiffing on my point.  There's some sweet sweet irony in that claim.
---
Maybe you should take a step back and consider whether your interpretation of what he said is actually correct or if you're just reading what you want to read and pretending it makes you somehow more right than the rest of us ;)
---
Nah, just straight up wreck her. Make Sledge hard counter someone besides Castle, since he is already inferior to Buck in most regards.
---
No new weapons.
---
No "true" new map.
---
Half the seasonal weapon skins.
---
The laziness has no bounds.
