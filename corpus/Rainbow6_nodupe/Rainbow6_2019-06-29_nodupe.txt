You could probably make a brick of C4. Get a brick, some olive paint, a nokia cell phone, some wires, a red light, and a beeper.

Yeah sound propagation is total garbage. Apparently they‚Äôre going to be redoing the entire sound engine, which is going to be great once done (hopefully). But unfortunately no idea when that‚Äôll be done.
---
THIS SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME
---
I miss the grenade throw back option. It was always a gamble. Will I throw it or will it explode in my hand? At least give it back in casual or something.
---
You should have gone for the head
---
Keep in mind each bar is per 100 Elo increment... so gold is by far the most common rank
---
And now I want an R6 crossover for Gungeon
---
I bet that was actually a peaceful 2-3 weeks
---
Yeah.. how, it's a population chart of all players..
---
Because it's meant to make you think that there around the same amount of silver 1 as there are gold 4, and then it slowly drops off from there, when I'm reality it should be stacked.
---

Oh yeah it‚Äôs big brain time

Yeah, I actually somehow missed that part, it still seems misleading to me tho

What happened to it? I've been off for like a week and a half ok vacation. Did they rework it yet?

Gold has 2 bars for a reason.. they're telling you there's more gold, it's on you if you can't read a bar chart.
---
This way looks alot better than having some tall ass bars take up the whole screen.

Oh nah man I just play ranked :/

If I get a kill, and I didnt hack, glitch or otherwise exploit the game, I deserved that kill. Easy as that.

This happened to a friend and I in operation health but it was the last match to get our rank and we started at zero. As previous gold players the climb back to even ranked was hell. Ended the season as copper three.

---
most tom clancy games are made/published by ubi and the one's that aren't relevant to ghost recon or six siege. the two game series tie up and even though the lore and ezio on villa, there's always gonna be easter eggs. Cav, Twitch, Valk, and Fisher have appeared on ghost recon. coincidence? probably not. they wouldn't just add them. The 2 series/games are probably and most likely in the same universe having being made by the same publisher/creators and having characters from other games appear on a game in the same series/line of games.
---
Great angle by sledge there. I see no problems with anything
---
Am I reading that right, does that say in-human?

Yeah that‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs happening, reset it a few times but it keeps going

I think the point that I didnt even see that there were tqo bars proves his point a bit. It may look better but is harder ro read, I guess its preference whats more important. I chose the stacked version.

I‚Äôve only experienced it on xbox and would keep happening i would hard reboot and it would work for a little bit but it would eventually keep happening, i think i saw somewhere its a glitch that happens after you play a certain operator. I don‚Äôt think theres a permanent fix until ubi patches it

I think if you kept them invisible but reduced the amount of traps he gets to five would bring him in line. I don‚Äôt hate Lesion, I use him quite frequently due to the fact that he is such a powerful operator. I do think he needs a little work done though.
---
I can't change the title. It is what it is already. Im sorry. Credit is Peri_Pericote.

Not if ur on console

Lol I just hit plat and before the end of the match where people saw the ranks they kept asking who i was queued with that made them match with me. ‚ÄúShocky guy behind the thing in the room‚Äù
---
Indeed.
---
Getting salty about someone else's actions that don't affect you is childish behavior. I just got this game like, 2 days ago but from what I've seen on the sub and in-game, this game's community is awful and you are a part of the problem.

Not everybody is as savvy. It's just more convenient to whip out your phone

N√∏kk is very similar to Caviera. Her gadget (HEL) is a mix between Cav and Vigil. When it's active she's invisible to cameras and silent when walking/crouch walking and when she's doing anything else there's a slight glitch effect on the cams and you can hear her. I hope this answers your question :)

Does other players see it too or is it only a client side bug?

Remember when you used to be able to throw grenades back?
---
They know people have jobs, sleep, and other activities and that‚Äôs why they make the price of the booster the way it is. If they allowed you to pause it, it would be like you use it for 168 hours straight of playing siege. I don‚Äôt even have that much time played in casual.
---
So they would increase the price as you obviously will get more renown out of the booster, losing them more money as you will buy less renown.
---
Simple business...
---
Bro why does everyone hate on the 417. That thing hits like a truck.
---
Thank goodness Ranked is bomb only, otherwise there‚Äôd be a problem.
---
If you want a more accurate plate carrier, she wears a Crye JPC, you can get reproductions for pretty cheap from Zshot's factory rejects.
---
 Everyone would love it but Ubi would never do it, if you could pause a 7 day booster which is 168 hours whenever you dont play, you would have that booster for a very long time, i have over 450 hours in rainbow and to have that bonus for basically a third of my time in this game that would be crazy (in a good way) especially because you can get a ‚Äúfree‚Äù 7 day booster with Ubisoft club

---
Same here
---
Ok
---
Spawn peeks are a strat of gold ranked players. The border between gold and plat is deffined as the point where the spawn peeker is a free kill. 
---
IDK if you chose to ignore it, its just advice. Just dont try to argue againts it.
---

Laser sights are actually good because it improves the accuracy of the gun and u can also see where the first bullet of the gun may go to
---
Mouse and keyboard doesn‚Äôt make you that good I don‚Äôt think many ppl understand this the mouse and only mimic the controller movements it isn‚Äôt mnk and that still doesn‚Äôt explain his 8.8 w/l
---
Hold up, is that why so many people leaves matches after a lost first round? Because it doesn‚Äôt count as a loss then?
---
It's usually because most of the time it is difficult for them to fix bugs. The clash glitch for example was an extremely special case with a few steps to reproduce it, and flaws in the system at each step have to be ironed out. It would cost a lot to take legal action against hackers, and showcasing glitches aren't against the code of conduct of YouTube. Yes they could be more open about development but they aren't slacking off intentionally.
---
You certainly were not behind cover, not even close
---
Right
---
May you help me as well
---
Lmao the sledge was a bot
---
If people just stopped playing the game ubi would have no incentive to fix the game because it would be dead? bringing problems to the light is how things get fixed.
---
I think you need to see a doctor
---
This is the first I've seen of it lol rip wth was that
---
She wouldn't be like how she was when she first came out, you bastards need to get it out of your head that a buff to her to make her viable amongst the others wouldn't kill the game. It'd make her have a reason to be picked which she has lost any of if not all of to be.
---
And make it double
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the beta, and I‚Äôm just now learning of this. Wow.
---
This. Nokk is the most unique Attacker so far and deserves a special gun just for her. We could have gotten a new variation of MP5SD or a completely new silent gun similar to Cav and her silent pistol. 
---
Instead, she has a box machine pistol that doesn't even fit her character and she losses to anchors like Maestro and Echo.
---
Or they would know they need to smarten up and actually start fixing stuff. Send messages, keep playing and buying skins and they have zero reason to do anything.

It‚Äôs more that I‚Äôd rather have an underwhelming operator than an overpowered one, anyways I feel like as is with the scorpion she fills her niche as a roamer and with shotgun she is the most potent roamer in defensive... if they do not change her shotgun she should not receive a buff at all she doesn‚Äôt need it

Bro r6 is broken. I‚Äôm sitting at platinum 2 and I gain roughly 40-50 Elo (that‚Äôs if the game is being nice) and I‚Äôm losing 60-70 no matter what. I understand they trying to make it a ‚Äúgrind to get diamond‚Äù or whatever but that is where they messed the system up. I just beat a team on all plat2 and a plat1- Gained 33 Elo. I just lost to one plat3 and the rest gold- lost 71 Elo.... they need to fix how their MMR works bc in my opinion it‚Äôs not even close to fair and accurate.

Wow thank you for the Reddit Gold! For those who are interested, I found this at an internet cafe near Sydney Town Hall. It seems to be the launch version, in LAN only offline mode. Terrorist hunt, online MP, and the cosmetic shop doesn't work, but all weapons and their attachment are unlocked. Also the observer mode appears to be in beta, there are no key bindings for it.

Had lots of fun running around the old clubhouse and seeing all the lighting differences, as well as GSG9 ACOGs and Smoke's Sniper 11. Also fiddled around with Twitch's old drone and Glaz's red scope and pre-buff rifle which doesn't break soft cover, and pistol recoil needs a little getting used to since none of them have muzzle brakes.

**everybody gangsta, gansta till the EMP rolled up**
---
Nokk is actually a Rook 100% confirmed
---
That game mode is super slanted to the defenders though. Clash can glitch straight to the objective.
---
Maverick
---
Rockin it
---
Honestly at this point fuck mnk i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of an advantage I can kill mnk players quite easily but this is game breaking literally no matter how good u r u won‚Äôt gain anything
---
Tachanka ain‚Äôt that bad
---
Thanks. Been wondering this myself
---
UBlock is your friend
---
It was for watching the Vegas Minor. There were percentage chances that increased the more you watched.
---
Aug for iq plz :)
---
Oooooooof
---
Nooooo, it‚Äôs definitely ok and funny. You convinced with the title, that‚Äôs all :P
---
This is so beautiful....
---
No we're asking how to have multiple icons like the original comment.
---
Starcraft has 7 maps per season, overall it had over 50 easily. I would even think 100+
---
&gt;can't have everyone in b+
---
You absolutely can have everyone in one tier if they belong there. Realistically most of the operators should be A tier if you make an objective tierlist based on competitive play.
---
&gt;Mav is insane
---
What exactly about him is insane? Yes, he's silent but he's not unbeatable. It's enough to just place a Valkyrie camera outside of a wall he may breach and you're completely safe. He is good but he is absolutely not S tier.
---
&gt;Finka is great with coordinated teams
---
Unless your whole team is rushing with the SASG-12, I don't see how that's the case. The 'benefits' she gives are negligible and the recoil reduction may even work against you.
---
&gt;Ela is still very powerful if you can handle the recoil
---
That's the problem with random recoil, you can't perfectly handle it which means Ela is still trash at long range and against pixel peeks. She's a worse, much more situational Lesion.
---
&gt;fuze is great if he is used for area denial instead of kills
---
How are you going to use him if the objective you're attacking doesn't have a soft floor above? Fuze is one of the most situational operators in the game. And I remind you that against any decent player a Fuze charge on a window is suicide. 
---
&gt;Ying is inconsistent
---
Her candelas are the only consistent flashes in the game.
---
&gt;maestro has hajillion counters
---
Which in turn is countered by smart Evil Eye placement. Even if both of his Evil Eyes are destroyed, he still has the best defender weapon.
---
&gt;Bb is powerful but lacks team play
---
No, he doesn't. Blackbeard can sit on a window for the entire match and deny rotations from the defenders so they can push in.
---
&gt;blitz is easy to counter
---
If you can setup a crossfire, yes. But otherwise he's strong in a 1v1. He's not very strong but he shouldn't be in the lowest tier possible either because there are worse operators than him.
---
&gt;mute is a lesser bandit imo
---
They serve entirely different purposes, they're not even comparable. Bandit denies hard breaching, Mute denies information and counters Lion and Dokkaebi.
---
&gt;pulse is great but tends to lose every gunfight due to the guns
---
You shouldn't be engaging in equal fights anyway with Pulse. You should always have the advantage, use your C4, wallbang and prefire. Not to forget how much intel he can provide.
---
&gt;Sledge has practically every other soft breacher better than him
---
Umm, no?? The only soft breacher that's objectively better than him is Buck.
---
&gt;lion is very unstable imo, his current state is very underpowered and could use something more
---
You can argue that he needs a slight buff but he's not weak either. He provides something no-one else can, making the defenders sit still while the attackers push in.
---
&gt;Thermite is heavily overshadowed by hibana and Mavs versitility.
---
All three of them serve entirely different purposes.
---
Why is bandit high?
---
Either way, it's quite neat
---
What do you have to buy
---

---

---
Thanks, Yoji Shinkawa is one of my inspiration!
---
Texting a number to buy something doesnt seem sketchy at all. Maybe put up an Esty shop or something to make it more official.
---
Ok I might be interested let me think a little bit
---
Ok thanks for the advice.
---
Yes all the time i thought it was my headphones but they work fine after a little while
---
I'd put the top of the f to a more brighter red and the bottom of the s to the same colour. I'd say it's good though.
---
there are a lot of wrong things, but ofc most are right
---
Etsy wouldn't work though since they're design requests
---
I got demoted from Silver 2 to Bronze 2 After 1 loss. I ragequit After getting teamkilled 3 round in a row
---
Unless you know how to do it?
---
&gt;what? i play bomb only, and if you are too, you know that barb wire is hella useful. put it on stairs + electroclaw to destroy drones and damaged attackers. not even twitch or ash can destroy it. 
---
No, it is not hella useful. Tell me one time a claw or battery has been dedicated to wire in PL and I'll concede. If a drone or a shock drone is getting friend in the wire, then the person who is droning is a dud and doesn't know how to pilot his drone away from obvious sources of danger. That is an insufficient reason to consider shock wires as useful utility.
---
&gt;Kaid was intended to bring more electricity on defender gadgets, not just hatches. that's why his Rtila works with AoE.
---
No, he was to aid bandit who was already overworked since bandit had over 3 sources of counters and he was the long anti hard breacher. That was what was asked for both bandit and J√§ger.
---
And even if you are doing it to shock wires and shields, it is fine if the shields and wires are in the range of a wall that is already electrified by a claw, but if you are dedicating a claw or a battery to just a wire with the "hope" that bad droning will lend you a drone kill, then you are wasting valuable hard breach denial utility.
---
I've had it happen quite a few times now, restarting has always worked.
---
Shhhhh
---
Zofia, if you can, get maverick tho, he is a really good hard breacher

That's not suspicious to me at all, really. You can see the over shot and re bounding to correct twice quickly. It's not a steady lock and snap....

Yes, people like you are exactly the kind of cretins that thrive when subs don't enforce rules.
---
Thx!
---
The Mozzie tends to die though without catching any more than 1 drone, so why not just catch the 2 whilst you can and position them?   Considering that in the last minute they are more likely to be in a gun fight and unable to utilize the drones. At least having 2 from earlier in the round means you can have them ready, or just placing the pests anyway into site entrances at the start would deny that later droning more effectively than keeping them on you
---
No lag then
---
I'm assuming English is your first language?

If you're over 18 and never spoken English or learnt it in any way it is a super hard language to grasp. So it's not as easy as just saying English should be the only language in games

This is a great format

This isn't useful

I disagree with the region lock unless it is a manual choice. I recently switched to PC from PS4 (diamond and such on Ps4) and I have been playing on higher ping. I looked at the data center and the default one had me in NEU (I should have had NAE). I had to go in and switch the center (which was not hard) but it was very frustrating.

lvl 432 and still learning things, the skill grind never stops and you can go backwards, played since launch but was silver in Skull Rain. I probably use that charm more than any other, silver looks nice, thats really all the ranks are good for anyway. Have since been Diamond/plat every other season but its not easy. 
---
Interesting that he mentions that he was "good" back in Black Ice when the game had like 22 ops, there are 46 now, so its not a fair comparison. I don't envy anyone trying to learn the game now, especially with all the bullshit operators like Lion, Blitz, Finka, Jackal etc. Just keep grinding and try to play with/against people who are better than you and you'll pick up little things that can have a big impact on your performance.
---
My attitude also changed alot over the years since release, being more laid back and not caring too much about what rank you are makes the game alot more fun (and usually i end up performing better as a result). Clearly this is the kind of guy who is fine until the team starts to lose, then he will spit and curse and blame his team-mates before admitting he could have done something to help or encourage/support/communicate with the team.

Absolutely not.

Sure some of the ops are useful. However I cannot convince someone to buy a season pass for this season or the next with the state of the game is and how long its taking ubisoft to resolve issues.

100% cannot tell someone they should throw money at ubisoft currently when you can get the ops for free.

1. PC has a ddos problem rn currently as well, ddosers aren't getting banned there either.

Im really liking the pixel art of Vigils dad. Very realistic!

Because his eyes can see the heartbeat and his sensor is just a decoy to hide the real truth.

Not necessarily. You just have to take it slow and let them peek you.

Mozzie is a 100% blast to play along with the fact that he‚Äôs a pretty great intel/counter intel operator. Not to mention pocket shotty utility and his primaries are pretty great along with the fact one has a pretty snazzy reload.

BB  cuz jackal is banned almost every round and even if you track somone they prob inside the obj anyway and sometimes his visor gets glitched and doesnt show any steps. Bb has a free headshot shield if you are quick enough to kill the guy otherwise the second boolet will be ur demise

Yes, you gotta hold it.
---
I also play hibana frequently and I can tell you it really isn‚Äôt that bad if you burst it and only use it at 15m or less which is the range it should be used as it isn‚Äôt a primary and should only be used in CQB panic when you run out of ammo.

Lesion is a fantastic starting operator. To be honest my only tip is to play more and more and more. Playing more, you will learn great spots to hold angles with, just make sure to watch kill cams. Maybe watch some youtube videos on some spots.

I would recommend lesion, and for attack Sledge. Sledge is a very basic operator, but I still use him constantly because of his good gun and his gadget is helpful for soft destruction. Let me know if you have anymore questions :)

Don‚Äôt play ranked as you do casual. 2 different play styles. Casual can form bad habits in ranked. Casual is more fast paced, a lot more action, and can be sloppy. Ranked is a lot slower pace although shorter time, and chess like when it comes to out thinking your opponent. 
---
I find myself doing better in ranked than casual because everything slows down, and your rewarded for patience and strategy. Where as in casual, by the time the round starts Ash is in the room with me and Buck is blowing open the ceiling above me, and Fuze is bombing the hell out of me üòÇ

When it comes to a basic strat or defense layout I always think about that. When it comes to playing the game itself and trying to kill/survive, play off your instinct - do what comes natural. 
---
Look at interviews of high level sports players and they all say you can't think about what you're doing because you over think it. Adapt to the flow and try to 'naturalize' the game in your mind. 
---
Also, its a video game! Make sure you ARE having fun.
---
Fuck people for not wanting to play a shooter with controller, right? Where will we get if the actually let people enjoy a game by using proper input devices?

All these M+KB haters on here are always so extremely toxic. Would be a good deed banning them. If they can't argue their point in a civil manner - and they never can - then it just shows that they do not even have an argument.

How would it split the playerbase?  Those who choose causal get all 20 maps, those who choose ranked will get 14 and those who choose pro league will get 7 maps, in theory someone who's using the pro league option and someone using the causal option could end up in the same game on clubhouse for example
---
I‚Äôm just asking why the fuck is it legendary
---
As other people have mentioned there are reasons why you would not place all your stuff down. There can even be advantages. I will sometimes wait until later in the round (when I know where the attackers are coming from) to put down my wire or shield as opposed to just putting it in a semi random spot and it winds up doing nothing.

People shouldn't be punished for actually thinking strategically.

Ubi why u bully me

Stop bitching and grow up. You shouldn‚Äôt play games online if you can‚Äôt handle someone being rude. Just mute them and move on.
---
I rarely ban Lesion because he's an operator I play a lot and often have success with. You need to consider your own strengths as well as what may hurt/help the opposing team.

It pisses me off because my KD is better than them so I can only play with my friends who will say no to the vote kick which then allows me to get more kills than the guy who vote kicks.

For those of you who think I‚Äôm toxic, he‚Äôs my friend and yes it was intentional

when its secure obj and you realise the last attacker is montagne

---
You can now ban operators in ranked
---
That was not joke idot üò§üò§
---
I dont have that problem,  only play bomb
---
So by your logic u should just pick no ban every round because every operator has a counter

You can sorta see his eyes on the six invitational skin if you look from the side

Nice, I'm sure they'll be plenty more in the future.

Was more of a change since hes faster now with his shield out. The rifle is mediocre, kinda like Thermite  rifle with slower RoF. He has a 2 shot DMR tho if you like that more.

Isn‚Äôt your ADS a percentage of your sensitivity? Example if my vertical is 50 and ads is 50, ads speed will be 50% of 50, which is 25. Or am i wrong?
---
not really for the pistols with high damage
---
absolutely not for low damage
---
The only one that you should is IQ.
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs just me, but I have a hard time even spotting people with his thermal scope while moving. It just blurs things slightly and dulls colors, so having an acog could allow him to have a decent zoomed scope while moving. 
---
Also I believe his scope has a higher zoom than an acog, though I could be wrong.
---

If you can hit headies, the lower dps won't matter... Also if you miss shots they won't get the shot notifier and you can keep going
---
You can set it to be the same but it will still depends on which sight you use so you'll have to manually adjust it every time you switch between an ACOG and a 1x sight. [Here](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-346294-16/fov-and-input-sensitivity) is a guide on how to tune it but it's very complicated so I'd suggest just going in the in-game settings and changing it there until it feels good.
---
That Caviera killed me lmfao
---
i always feel it makes it easier to see even without thermal but others seem to share your sentiment.
---
How much renown an hour does this get you
---
I‚Äôd say so, nice use to take out drones, cameras, etc. Not a noticeable enough damage drop off (besides most operators mainly rely on primaries anyways). The only one I‚Äôd say to be cautious about is sidearm SMGs. I know that personally I use Echo‚Äôs sidearm SMG more than I use his primary. So maybe in a case like that you could weigh out if you want those few extra points of damage (but as I said previously I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very noticeable anyways).
---
Thank you but i doubt I'll get to many aces lol. Im not a great shot but i have map knowledge and a damn good headset.

I think very low, but not pitch black lighting and toggle-able night vision would be better. Flashlights that have a 'spotlight' effect can make people nauseous the same way low FOV can.
---
Doesn‚Äôt fix the current problem though
---
no
---
I mean I guess, unless you're matched against a good Echo player, in which case he'll hit you with the Yokai a couple times, then peaks out and kills you while you're disoriented and trying to plant.
---
I just want my obsidian :(

In the early days you only unlocked 1 operator, so i tested it with my friend. Conclusion: You Are gonna get recruit.

One time I was accidentally  fuze even though there was a hostage but I didn‚Äôt kill the hostage with my grenades.

I usually would agree but it is kind of obvious to be fair

It‚Äôs almost like he can be countered or something

Looool

oh sorry

I just shot it 4 times with the LMG

Thought smoke was the next one
---
I mean everything about this operator says he is flexing bruh!
---
I get the feeling you didn't read my response.

which one

It wouldn‚Äôt matter, what they use makes it seem like it‚Äôs a controller being used

A 1/2 armor?

I hope so too

Problems not with ubi, the makers of these m&amp;k set ups are fast to patch any attempt to fix the detection.
---
How much you wanna bet it‚Äôs a glitched cam
---
Leison, hands down, most annoying and always useful on any map
---
No point in that. Imagine a situation where a hacker solo queues for one game before his boosted friends show up. The four stand-up, honest, great players quickly realize what's happening and decide to surrender so that the enemy doesn't lose to a hacker. Oh wait..... Unanimous, you said...
---
Or a console troll in silver 4 who tries to deliberately throw, shoots teammates, runs into friendly fire etc.. His 4 teammates are having a terrible time in the match and decide in their party chat that since we are gonna lose this anyway, why not just make it quick and find a new game with hopefully a better teammate. Oh wait...... They can't, because you forced them to have a horrible experience for much longer and they decide to call it for the night, because that one jackass ruined their hype and they didn't even have a possibility to vote for a surrender and end it fast to find a better lobby.
---
I thought ubi removed the starter edition?
---
I personally don‚Äôt really into the super edited kind of videos,  but I could see people enjoying it, it‚Äôs a nice video. Keep making these

I Don't Care You Whining Turd

I like that the top two comments are "cursed image" and "blessed image" both at 11 pts

---
lol i read it. I understand the coping at that they cant fix everything but no matter what people shouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with it without any punishment what so ever even if they aren‚Äôt on my team people shouldnt be able to throw a game or worse without any consequences it ruins the game and thats part of why this season sucks so much.
---
You main. Go away
---
100 percent by favourite game worth the money
---
3rd party software makes it look like a controller is plugged into the console, so it wouldn't fix anything.
---
No. The point is that when you mute the castle barricades, breach charges don't work on it.
---
I have the wow charm and it reminds me of my many alpha pack commons and stupid legendaries that look like a common.....

So they did. But my cousin still only has 3 operators. They could all get banned.

No problem actually 1 problme i don't have xbox
---
Yes I did. Rainbow Six Siege by nature is a very competitive game, and garners most of its popularity and reputation from this. If a player is not competitively motivated to play with his team to win, what other reason could he possibly be there for? Other types of fun? Like what? Team killing, hostage killing, vote kick bullying, or throwing? We have a reverse friendly fire system now, so we don't need the vote kick feature. The vote kick is abused way more than it is legitimately used. Most competitively inclined players would agree that it's better to have a toxic teammate with reverse friendly fire on that won't do much rather than no player at all cause of a vote kick and having to wait for matchmaking which may not even bring another player.
---
I &lt;3...

Watch videos about all the new strats and ops. And start playing lots of ranked

One of my favorite characters, it's too bad his ability has such a short range.

Everyone always forgets about Kaid

yep, same happened to me.. i guess you also got an insta loss and suspension for like 15 min?

(I was being sarcastic mate... besides I already play like a copper 4)

Yep it's true, it just sounds weird to me that a copper fragged 16 times in a gold 2 match ahah

Yeah it counted as a loss because you weren't participating.

Russian swaggersouls? Oh hello

I think 90% of ash mains enjoy Zofia just as much... ik I do and I switch between them no problem lol... also any ops with nades and twitch with breaching charge or thatched... need I go on? Castle is a pointless op
---
Amazing Story 
---
Never apologize
---
Probably not, mostly because it doesn't need it. If I see an Ela they are probably running the shotgun but that's because it is the better weapon.

Hip fire when he was turning around

Play with friends or at least find some friendly regulars.Playing the game solo is usually frustrating.

It‚Äôs never too late, but I feel if you learn the call outs, don‚Äôt charge in blindly and work with your team you‚Äôll be fine. Also you willl die. A lot
---
How do you use leans like that? As a newcomer to this subreddit and game, it seems like you are using your lean to aim, kinda like strafe aiming. Can someone explain how this is applied?
---
1) Its rainbow
---
2) Its very toxic so be prepared
---
3) Find your best sensitivity for the best aim
---
4) Don't barricade 
---
5) Start of by playing Rook on defence and always place his armour and play Ash or Sledge on attack
---
Yeah it was a 2v4 and we had 15 seconds so I was super fidgety
---
I'm bronze IV, last season I reached plat II. Every game I play is either people dropping ranks or diamond smurfs that destroy me even tho I am top fragging. This game is extremely volatile. If you're having fun, then you are really having fun, if your getting fucked, there is nothing that you can do and it completely fucks with your brain.

you can use mnk on ps4 but you can‚Äôt hip lean. it‚Äôs not possible
---
People who ban Cav, why?
---
With an adapter even then it can only mirror what the controller can do, not add extra binds and if you mean native support siege does not have it. Sorry the response took awhile I had a cooldown.
---
Is that a SCAR or the CZ 805 Bren?
---
I‚Äôve spectated multiple times and they lean lmao
---
I like how it is now. As long as they can keep the map pool somewhat large and balanced then I‚Äôm ok with it. I‚Äôd rather not play only 7 maps like they do in pro league. I‚Äôm all for variety and quantity, again as long as the maps are balanced. The only maps right now I‚Äôm ranked I don‚Äôt like are Chalet and Skyscraper as they are extremely unbalanced for both sides and haven‚Äôt aged well at all.
---
Unfortunately the event based Packs usually are limited time only.
---
m8 that k/d total was back in the days when I was playing only casual back in white noice and crimera, you can literaly see that I didnt know shit, i have 16h as a Thachanka and thats all in those 2 seasons, and as you see in my stats I play mainly support, and what should I do? Fucking yeet in as a Thermite? I dont think so.
---
then it‚Äôs a spectator glitch. you cannot hip lean on console
---
I just have to have like 3 mains because it seems everyone wants to band Jackle :/

sadly nobody in your matches will recognize it

Black Ice is one of the most coveted skins in R6.  It is often considered much better than some of the Legendary Skins.  One of the most detailed, creative, and artistically beautiful skins in the game.  It was released during Operation Black Ice as a seasonal skin and due to high demand Ubi put it back only in Alpha Packs.  If you search Black Ice on Youtube you will see that people are usually super happy to get the BI skins on any weapon.
---
I know I'm gonna reap the downvotes but...
---
I don't think it's such a great book.
---
Tom Clancy has a good prose, his characters are believable, but there is no tension in his storytelling, no meaningful character evolution, the plot itself is basucally an action movie pitch, where you know the bad guys' plan all along with no twist.
---
Yeah, the book and the game have nothing in common. The closest anyone in the books comes to having a gimmick is the snipers with bolt action vs. semi-auto (Bolt wins, because America)
---
Oh, and the Italian guy who is really good with a pistol, but he doesn't show up until The Bear and The Dragon.
---
Why the rank system needs to be changed, definitely should be the highest rank is what you fight
---
Idk why you need to be invulnerable when doing it? Just have it as an option for whenever your on cams
---
Yeah Ubisoft hasn't put in non-ADS leaning of consoles. Even on mouse and keyboard you can't. You can't bind a command that doesn't exist. Must've glitched/ hacked.
---
It happened to me on PC, too.
---
lol ‚Äúhack files‚Äù 
---
xbox one/ps4 modding doesnt exist
---
edit: it WAS TECHNICALLY possible on xbox one but it was only worked on mw1 remastered campaign and it was only moon jump, doesnt even exist anymore tho

Has to be a DDoS, there's only one guy with 22 ping, while the rest are in the hundreds.

Dynamic lighting, real time reflections. Proper shadows, significantly higher data limits, more complex destruction and physics, and most importantly a completely redone ditection sound system to name a few

What about storage sdd or HDd because my computer has an it 4670 8 GB ram 1060 and it runs the game high graphics 75 fps so it might be something like a slow hdd if your using one

It shots slug rounds, which are shotgun shells but only 1 bullet so therefore its a shotgun

No it couldn‚Äôt of lol
---
We can do this lads!

The only things that change with level is when you pass level 30 you can play ranked and pass 50 you can‚Äôt play newcomer. I think they are the only things that change.

When you kill someone he goes like:You got GNOMED

He aboutta hit the fattest nae nae in history

What a bitch

It looks like a STG-45

This is getting pathetic at this point

This is fucking funny af bro lol

Why are people banning jackal
---
Agreed. I started high silver this season, got to Gold, then went on a losing streak into bronze. Now it takes several wins to go up a tank. It's frustrating
---
He can smell feet
---
1. would counter too many ops
---
2. jager situational??????
---
you literally just throw ads, reinforcements, and barbed wire all over

obj then go roaming or sit in a corner

If I had to guess spamming &lt; or &gt; repeatedly

I believe Rainbow is the one who says stuff like "1 Opfor remaining"
---
im on ssd. 
---
ive tried removing shadowplay and experience.
---
turning off all overclocks.
---
new graphics drivers
---
Right, using an adapter isn't the same as mouse and keyboard it can only mirror the controller and will have aim assist which is therefore cheating so it is why I said you can't use mouse and keyboard. Sorry again I have a cooldown.
---
I once asked a friend to watch my back and they were jump scared by a valk in the jigsaw mask.
---
If you're on PC you can alway play R6TM on facit, they follow pro league rules with some very minor differences. I strongly recommend to try it out, it's more fun than ranked and casual, it doesn't effect your stats and there are no hackers or glitchers. You're mostly gonna play with golds-diamonds. Queue times can be long tho, and most people play in the flex queue. 
---
Read here for more: https://r6tm.pro/ on the bottom you can find useful links.
---
Same thing happened to me last season. I spent 15 days to reach silver. :(
---
CZ BREN, personal favorite of mine
---
Now that's a good meme
---
I am level 60 lol. I don't even know the location of cameras.
---
Maybe moot will be a better option than discord you can say what device and rank and find teammates around your skill level
---
But you are literally using mnk. You will continue to have a cooldown until you make smart comments and get karma lmao at this rate you aren‚Äôt going to
---
When nomad thinks she‚Äôs safe...
---
Goodnight.
---
It's the BREN, similar to a scar
---
What about 1 no longer obtainable charm/skin twice per month?
---
You can‚Äôt say &lt; or &gt; anymore
---
that‚Äôs fuckin awesome
---
All credit goes to u/d0nutfr3t. PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL IN THESE COMMENTS. We might be able to keep it up this time.
---
lul casual to have fun
---
more like just remove pick&amp;ban it's fucking useless and annoying and 98% of players don't use their brain when banning and i have to sit through more downtime in this loading simulator of a game just to have the same damn ops get sent to the corner for timeout
---
Use the ump unless you like running at people like a madman if you do the shotty is better
---
It is hold for Sledge, but most mice have the ability to middle click by nudging the wheel with your finger so you don't have to lift off the left button.
---
Yup. At least try. Not deal with little bitches who can‚Äôt compete in ranked so they squad up with low levels and wreck shop.
---
Lmao no just get upset that they cant just make a toggle filter as well as the fact that a shit ton of what are random words for most ppl get banned cause other ppl use them to be racist

Here on PC ive seen 2 suspected hackers that were maybe just good and 1 ddos. this shit really isnt that bad tbh, people are over exaggerating, Yes it FUCKING SUCKS to have a hacker in your game. but its just 1 game. and i would highly doubt it you play against a hacker every game. 
---
Second of all. clash can fuck right off. that operator is frustrating to play against. I do miss deployable shields tho. 
---
and ubisoft is fixing the game right now, hence why they took out deployable shields and clash. you want to play against gamebreaking exploits? Oh no you dont, but you would complain about it regardless. The only thing i dont like about this season is that it doesnt have much. You got ugly seasonal skins. warden sucks ass, nokk is ok. no new weapons. No new map, although i admit the kafe rework is pretty good.

I‚Äôve done the same man, shits great.

This is so salty it made me thirsty

Hello comrade

Please feel free to leave a review about the Plat 3 Doc Spawnpeek room online. If it wasn‚Äôt satisfactory try the Sweaty Ash Main room, where everything is speed up 50 times and you dont have a hitbox.
---
Or maybe the map is just ass from a designer standpoint. The defense clearly has the advantage.
---
Ash is there for you to serve all your thirsty needs .

No, leave it in Casual

All I can say is: Oof.
---
That must have sucked
---
Yeah its a ddos. you also have people giving you 0 fps and 100000000000 ping. Just dont think anything of it, send a ticket of their name. and youll get your shit back.
---
It would seem I'm being torn to shreds for an unpopular opinion, just miss the good ol days of tower x
---
Lol that was funny
---
Were you not referencing why echo doesn't get called?
---
And room doc kaid and gridlock
---
Not just ranked tho, has also happened to me on cas
---
Could not believe it, took me a second to realize what was going on.

Not nearly as effective since machine pistol super recoil nerf üò≠üòµüò™üòìüòøüòñüòñüôÉ

`whats in the canister`
---
Shhh it‚Äôs a secret.
---
While that is completely understandable, it reached the amount necessary to be in the Top of All Time 4th position with the amount of support it got. Just say it broke a rule or something and that's why you hid it, it makes me feel so much more embarrassed for you that you have to lie and say it just "vanished" from the hot page.

Marley, I didn‚Äôt know you used reddit
---
I was today years old when I learned of this
---
Are the charms the highest rank or current rank?
---
spilled wine on the wall too
---
Yeah I saw everyone posting their one taps and remembered this one
---
Welcome to wood IV

When it freezes do you have to restart to fix it? cause i had this problem about a year ago where i had a wireless headset and when ever i connected or dissconected my cable or any usb while playing i would have a freeze then i would have to close it through the task manager so maybe you got like a lax cable that connects and disconnects and causes the same issue for you.
---
Well glaz‚Äôs rifle i believe can do collaterals
---
That is definitely not a bottleneck. The i9 goes great with that GPU.
---
Am I the only only one who actually digs the skin?

Most people are saying legion so I guess I'm a legman main noe

Because if you do your obj becomes a death trap to your team. It becomes an enclosure.
---
For me the scary parts are when I'm on defense, and I hunker down in a corner, and just listen to the footsteps, especially with good headphones. Hearing stomping on the other side of the wall can be quite unnerving.
---
As someone who has pretty bad anxiety, I do so much worse when my teammates do that. It's counterproductive. If you want me to clutch the round, there's a much better chance I can pull it off if you shut the hell up and let me focus.
---
Well that‚Äôs a fucken lie
---
Just came here to let you know you are stupid
---
It‚Äôs the same on Xbox :(
---
the skins ok but i already have the guerrilla one which is imo better
---
Sad thing is it‚Äôs so true, not just on playstation but on Xbox too
---
That‚Äôs a DMR
