I wholeheartedly agree it’s a shit gun skin, but maybe pair it with the trench Doc elite for *some* effect? Might get some use outta it then 
---
---
---
Only in copper.
---
I definitely wouldn't mind if the current Amethyst was a skin, but they really shouldn't advertise it as a gemstone skin when it's completely different from the others.
---

---
That's the issue I and others have with it. You buy any other gemstone skin (or if you have Obsidian from whatever gave it) you get a "shiny" blocky skin.
---
If you buy Amethyst you get a weird sandpaper fade thing that looks completely different on each gun.
---
&gt;New leaning. This is mostly opinion but I don't understand why it was changed. I know it was for QE spamming but I never had a problem with that. I'm convinced the new system was designed for coppers and console players where they were limited in movement. I also noticed that shots that should not be hitting are killing people. I have died to people not even peaking or aiming at me. I have also done the same to others. I get a head shot when i clearly missed. I don't know if this has to do with the new leaning, but I thought I would include it.
---
[This video shows exactly why lean spamming is a problem.](https://youtu.be/FoLXUs46uWY?t=154)
---
&gt;New maps in the map pool. Why? What is the logic behind putting a brand new map into the ranked map pool. I have played I think 4 or 5 Outback games and won 1 of them. Maybe I still would have lost if I knew the map, but I can guarantee to you that I would have done better if I knew it. They should put it into all modes except ranked until about a month.
---
There are two main things to consider with the ranked map pool. First, many players refuse to play the casual rule set. In order for them to experience the new map, they will only be able to play it in ranked.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Second, and more importantly, there isn't any real benefit to players for the new map to be left out of ranked. Casual will never be taken as seriously as ranked so long as the consequence of winning or losing is irrelevant (at least publicly); this prevents any matchmaking system from having any hope of consistently matching evenly skilled teams and thus any data regarding map balance from casual will be nigh useless. Thus, keeping it out of the ranked rule set will not help Ubisoft determine whether the map is balanced for ranked. Thus, the map will eventually make it into ranked regardless whatever casual data exists.
---
To go one step further, what would keeping the maps out of ranked for an arbitrary amount of time accomplish? If your goal is to not have to play the map in ranked prior to learning it, you can choose not to play ranked until you learn the map through casual, discovery casual, terrorist hunt, or custom games; there's no reason to prevent players who either are comfortable with the map on day 1 from the TTS or don't care about having a map they don't really know in ranked from having the opportunity to play it. Then if you were to do that, you'd actually likely have a better ranked experience as many teams would already have their initial ranks when you started in ranked yourself rather than you queuing with everyone at the start of the season.
---
&gt;Map Pick: We all know what this is. I hate to make this comparison, but like Call of Duty. Simply 2 maps with a random if those two aren't wanted. 
---
There are currently 13 maps in the ranked pool. If I assume there are 5 favorite maps, the likelihood that one of those two maps is offered is 64.1%. You would literally see one of the favorite 5 maps nearly 2/3 of the games you play (plus you'd get one of those top 5 maps 38.5% of the times the team chose random on map selection). Even with the slight variety among those 5 maps, that's an awfully frequent chance of getting one of those maps.
---
This what gonna happen if they nerf Mozzie.
---
Thought it was 100,000 renown
---
Literally unplayable
---
What? No Far Cry 5?? smh my head
---
Yes, liked this map more than a lot of the year 2&amp;3 maps. Don't like outback either.
---
yeah,I  had used that skin,before my friend said "the shape of the gun is like a banana."
---
You have to understand that not all bugs are immediate issues, and I’ll say this, it depends on the game, with how Ubisoft is working on and updating rainbow six siege, they can’t really afford to fix every little bug that comes out, as for rockstar they can because their updates are spaced out quite nicely, and because of the size of say, rdr2, it’ll take quite a while to find a bug, and even then it’s probably just a bug in a back corner of a map
---
I think all 5 of the players in that clip are coppers
---
I'm now running into a problem where my teammates are shooting my drones when attacking because they think they're hacked. Like, can you not see that my drone isn't covered in red LEDs?
---
Probably trolling on casual lmao. You’ve just been in bad luck.
---
But wait.... British Men lose smg scope
---
o ok didn't know
---
Then that's bullshit 
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Lol I had the opposite of this happen to me earlier today. I stole her drone and as soon as I got on it, she rushed obj and one tapped me.
---
Good question tho, never really tought about this! Thanks for the answers! 
---
My question is how you didn't down thermite at point blank range with a shotgun
---
they are sounding like Bethesda to me (they also have done this multiple times since fallout's new game came out). And my friend who mods ark (thru the steam workshop) also has gotten banned by battle eye just a week ago (note he doesnt actually play ark just uploads mods from the dev kit). What is going on with battleeye right now
---
I mean for the attacker everyone knows that peek
---
Because everyone who plays on PC is Pro League material
---
I’m not dissing your main, but high key she sucks dong man, she’s only good with a coordinated team and that’s pretty rare 
---
Only joking. But could you? 👀 
---
All these vigils but none use their ability. Smh lol
---
I’m sure that’s what balances him. He can already capture 3/5 starting drones, enjoy him now before they nerf him down to 2. 
---
I had the same issue happening with me earlier and restarting the game didn’t change anything in my case atleast. I just kept playing while talking in party chat until a few matches went by and the issue resolved itself. 
---
I have Spotify on 5% and it helps me focus better than silence.
---
Nah R6 has a crazy weird FOV and camera, its why shields are kinda broken
---
Good job. Place your barbed wire.
---
thanks for the recommendation! 
---
Everyone knows. But some dont watch out for it.
---
Rip I’m on xb 
---
Probably where they got the concept even though he's korean smh
---
I only started after it was removed, but if they got maps like Favela in rotation..
---
Depending on the difficulty 1 or 2 bombers might spawn in the reinforcement waves, but on normal its bomber free and its great
---
90k with season pass 
---
email. I assumed that counts since ubisfot calls it 2 factor authentication?
---
Du-du-du. It wouldn't work very well unless it was seperate dus.
---
do you see the /s cause i see the /s you salty fest 
---
i meant kaids shotgun specifically
---
You shot them chest/shoulder and then died
---
it’s not an elite lmao
---
Ubi gonna do what ubi does best. Make mistakes
---
Personally I think If they changed Glaz’s ability to shoot through windows and somehow made runouts harder, it would be a much more appreciated map.
---
It does and it should work after an hour or so I guess
---
I thought after her nerf she was no longer useful. Then I ran into a player who destroyed us with Clash. So yeah.. in the right hands and with some coordination she’s pretty decent. The fact her gun is no longer a burst helps too. 
---
I love listening to music while shotgun or blitz rushing in casual. These strats need to be executed quickly, and with no over-thinking (of which i often am guilty tho), and music helps me in that. In these situations, if you get flanked you're dead, and there's no reason to fight it or even care about it because you're in **casual**. Please try it, it's waay more effective than it should be.  
---
Listening to music in ranked is just taking away one or 2 of your 3 ways of detecting other players (sight, hearing and friendly callouts).
---
yeah
---
I think that's the whole point he was trying to make, making it randomized in casual keeps it more fresh by not making you play the same sites every game.
---
U N P L A Y A B L E
---
not sure if your taking about another post or this picture 
---
Yes please. I barely get Brazil map too
---
Its super easy to mute people. I honestly wait til they do something annoying because more often than not people will just say useful bits of intel. But I’m ready to pull the mute trigger. 
---
Honestly more annoying listening to 12 year olds giggling about shitty Trump jokes than the ragers. 
---
I knew what it was as soon as I saw the title and I still got so excited !
---
As much as I'd like to see a solo (or solo/duo) queue, it unfortunately wouldn't work unless the game prevented teams of 3 or 4 from queuing. Otherwise, squads of 3 and 4 would never get the players they need to round out their team since those players would all be in the solo/duo queue (even if you gave single and paired players the option to join the larger queue, I doubt there would be many who would choose to enable that option).
---
Personally I'd like to see a 5-man queue and a less than 5-man queue to at least prevent the teams of incomplete squads from going against potentially very coordinated full squads. It wouldn't be as game-changing as your suggestion, but it also wouldn't leave teams of fewer than 5 in a position where they can't find teammates through matchmaking.

I can See was them all must of just got the game
---
Not gonna lie, looks fake. Or it’s a seasonal skin found in limited packs
---
That's why I play with my friends xD
---
for some reason I do not trust this
---
Please stop posting this with this picture.
---
lol was everyone bad earlier seasons ?
---
Wait. Is that a thing?
---
I bought the game like two weeks ago and it’s been... interesting. 
---
The last bullet was aimed directly at his head because of the recoil.
---
Cry about it, there are far more oppressing matters in the game of r6s other than a “/3”
---
If that makes you upset and not the terrible hit registration or the shitty sound design than you should play a different game.
---
I feel like this season especially is being really hard to solo queue and win games. 
---
What
---
I literally just posted this
---
It gives me more confidence and let’s me focus more on shooting than listening.
---
K thanks
---
And the server says you died before firing it I'd presume
---
Just don’t spam, let the sight go back down before firing
---
?
---
Yo can you send me this vid? This is actually genius
---
Absolute unit. 
---
That was his headgear.
---
Beta
---
well take "elite" out off it... what happend to this skin?
---
Mute mains rise up
---
Near meaningless label
---
Ugh, ps4. JustKidding, not really but kinda

It was about twice as long as mine, ranting and bashing the commenter above for saying they were bummed but understood. Typical "you're stupid and ungrateful and I can't stand people like you" sort of stuff.

Noice
---
sorry bout the discord overlay
---
Kinda hard to watch ngl
---
This gave me a stroke trying to read it 
---
My thought process was if the past kills/deaths always affect you than if your stats are 600K/1000D, you HAVE to kill 400 people without dying once to get a 1.0 KD, you can't just drop a 1.0 every game after that and expect it to catch up, 1200/2000 still makes a .6 KD. Unless they incorporate an average into it, people that take a long time to get better at the game will always have an awful KD. 
---
It would effect it. The kd is kills/death so if they drop 1kill/1death it would go up. If they continued with like a 6/10 it would go down
---
Omfg been playing since year 1 and I never knew 🙃
---
The disrespect!
---
I like it
---
id say it’s even my favorite gun
---
I don't even like the fucking volcano skin, they can  do it even more better than that.
---
Some skins in the alpha packs, are only wood and metal, idk man, try to be more artistic... Add more colors...
---
Like the fucking M1911 Iron-Man edition
---
Placement time...
---
corey, trevor! smokes!
---
It’s stupid posts like this that push more important fixes back further. 
---
this is too wholesome. Good man
---
Give it a try. Your fears will be fed away as soon as you are in a match and everything you will think is... What the hell are you gonna do the next 3 minutes? 
---
Now, seriously. Give it a try, every match you will learn something new, you will find amazing, average, horrible, all kinds of teammates but that's part of the game and when you feel comfortable enough, use the voice chat. Even though it is not extremely necessary in order to win. You need coordination and sometimes that's something it happens naturally. 
---
As a final note: I had the chance to play (and talk via Skype) with a French girl in Overwatch. She was an amazing girl (and I say, was, because I lost contact with her). As soon as I read you were French, you remind me of her immediately. 
---
So, good luck and great art btw. Keep up the good work.
---
Thanks I got an original Xbox somewhere. 
---
Bad bot
---
Someone else posted that a hacker froze the game and their computers so maybe that's what happened. 
---
Fair to like it, but not what it's advertised as and nothing like what you expect.
---
Legendary? If you say so.
---
Ok
---
Any every other FPS subreddit.
---
I have to be honest here, though I love seige and play it everyday, seige gives more oppertunities for toxic users to be toxic. Relate?
---
Is this the way to Amarillo?
---
r/crappyoffbrands
---
Ok. Thanks
---
I got another legendary right after this one, took a pic of it, and forgot to post it.  Not as good.  But I still really like it. 
---
I'll be fair with you. In my original post I said "this took me 2p minutes and isn't the final project" but you couldn't know that because I kinda... deleted the original...
---
To be fair you can get the best of both worlds by toning the music tone to the point where you can still hear footsteps and also the music in the background (w/o having music cancel the noise).
---
I cannot play well w/o music. I get jump scared and panic easily by explosions and sudden encounters or flanks. If i get shot at my hand immediately shakes while i shoot back. Music removes all of that for me so i tone the music down so i can barely hear it and also still hear the sound cues from r6s.
---
Wow! - in Australian 
---
Thank you. I’m glad to see I’m not the only one who thinks a legendary skin *has* to be a glowing rainbow with sparkles. 
---
I like these subdued, realistic legendaries a lot better than most of the “good” legendaries.
---
Ehh its ur opinion personally idfc whether I play console or PC I just want 2 play and enjoy the game if I switch 2 PC I switch 2 PC if I dont I dont 
---
Please don't make me answer that 
---
This is unacceptable
---
Its a new feature

It sure do.

Hibana elite with hibana pro league skins on her guns &gt; hibana pro league and hibana elite. 
---
Thanks! My gamertag is Stretchaffe I’ll add you right now
---
Why it's Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege of course
---
can someone explain why he didnt die from the explosion when everyone else did? was it simply hp difference?
---
So? It’s Ela
---
Ubi needs to get on that shit
---
u/FiestyLighterFluid how many hours did it take to get to rank 94? Just curious. 
---
That's what we were thinking, meanwhile I couldn't close the game or anything. She could take up task manager and boop gone. Started to freak out lmao
---
Yeawhat
---
Oh yea this happened in a ranked match with randoms btw 😂
---
One time I was destroying a window that was across the map from the objective and I got a headshot.
---
Why is it that when anyone posts a clip, every comment is trying to diminish it?
---
I remember you flair, you changed from IQ to Cav.
---
Try red dot its hella accurate btw wat do u think with the glaz rework
---
Oh god, mute them!
---
Yeah I'm dumb, I was just really wondering if it would be that difficult to raise my KD. 
---
Yes, yes indeed 
---
Guys this is recruit. Not pulse
---
Talk about a broken game
---
You telling me Thermite can place his charges on the wall now?
---
Holy shit dude 
---
See that's crazy to me, I have to keep my spotify anywhere between 15-30%. Just loud enough for it to be audible to me but not enough for it to be intrusive.
---
Granted I've gotten to points where I just won't play Siege at all if I wanna listen to music.
---

No, Twitch’s drones should not be immune to Mozzie’s pests?

Aye and then everyone gets chlamydia

---
Danny Trejo?
---
Litterally screaming: JOEY YOUR LEFT FFS!!!
---
They nerfed her pretty hard recently, she’s still good but definitely not as good as she was. Are there other operators that you’re thinking of getting?
---
I mean it should have been Warframe
---
Can you do that?
---
No I’m talking about diamonds can queue ranked games on their diamond accs with their bronze friends and carry them to a rank they don’t deserve. I think they should add a system like ow where for example plays can only queue with diamonds and golds and silvers or like diamonds can only queue with plats 
---
I have 15 and 25 lower it to be honest the lower your sensitivity the better your accuracy this isn’t call of duty where you need max sensitivity to turn on people 
---
i used to do this with the baliff

Honestly when's this happens its just a waiting game between both teams 
---
I have it for some random pistol (just realized I did equip all on the new shark skin and I dont know what pistol that is now fuck) and the shotgun for Tachunky and Kapkan. So I guess I’m a tachanka main now.
---
Golds can only queue with plays silvers and bronzes etc
---
I’m thinking of finka, lion, ying, and maybe jackal, I just can’t decide
---
Unpopular but still respectable opinion 
---
Dokkeabi is certainly a good operator, with the recent nerf for me her biggest draw is now her weapons , her shotgun is like a sniper and her single fire is good also, smg-12 and c75 auto are both good sidearms also
---
Oh that sucks
---
It isn’t fun because ela is missing an eyebrow on a skin nice 
---
Can we get an f I. Chat for this man waiting an eternity for the round to start
---
 Yes I’d rather get the skull rain barret 
---
it's a ranked kd. still playing w/ same group
---
I guess we aren’t use to the white line yet
---
Definitely jackel, he’s such a pain so therefore he’s good
---
AFAIK they have never said that attachments would be refunded, other than in the case of some one-offs like Jager's ACOG and such, where they were removed from the game.
---
Believe me, I'd rather have the renown back for all the attachments I've bought over the years too. But I'm not broken up about it. The game is better off with free attachments.
---
What?
---
Yonik
---
Lmao he had to be salt bae after that kill cam
---
I buy them so I have all the ops for a year a week early and for less. Plus you get the universal gun skin for everything. Not a bad deal 
---
I’m actually confused 
---
Eyelashes are irrelevant in true combat
---
I know I want to too plus the yager kill 20 drones order dosnt help I just feel sad when I stole my first twitch drone a doc shoot it 5 sec later
---
Happened to me had my drone stuck in a mute jammer, then mozzie grabbed my drone was stuck like that until I restarted my game.
---
Man I guess I’m just lucky I have never dealt with that, I’m sorry about that. I 4 stack usually and occasionally I 5 stack of our fifth is on. So I don’t have to deal with as many randoms as you may need to
---
i hate this shit. you can say something like that about literally any joke and ruin it. if you dont find it funny dont upvote it and move on
---
I bathe in the bloothe
---
It’s in the settings under matchmaking preferences

You can turn off certain maps and game modes

You still need ps plus yes, siege just opens up everyone including those without it during the free weekends

Are you legitimately retarded?

i got an alpha at 53.xx% and at the next match i got the alpha pack at 2.30% (got a common)
---
What a satisfying subreddit
---
i paid money only because this skin has such a reputation of being a shitty paid skin... i have the blue which looks awesome, gold which is cool i guess but this one... THIS is the skin people talk about. had to have it, and hope they dont change it

No rrason to cry over that. This bitch needs to stop

I have expect it to shoot the guy running away from the execution in Skyrim intro with all the Skyrim memes going around.
---
Definitely has something going on with it right now. Acouple days ago i went like 3 games of killing drones and not getting them recorded on the challenge then it all came in at once the next day. Ive also been stuck on smg kills for like 2 days but im a mozzie smg main...  
---
ash has absolutely no recoil rn, i consider that buck's recoil for ash will be even worse because she has a higher fire rate and that obviously mean more recoil than buck

Every time you're matched with a random who's a good team player and communicates on mic, why not add them to your friends list? Seems like you'd be able to find enough people for a full squad fairly quickly this way.
---
hey its cob
---
When the mastermind ask u to blow yourself up but u say no at the last few seconds 
---
Unplayable.
---
Eh, I don’t really like joining public discord due to past experiences but thanks for the information and the offer, I may take it up at some point down the line lol.
---
You really have to think about the decisions you're making. If possible record a game or two and then watch for all the mistakes you make. 
---
Consider how many angles you're exposing yourself to by standing where you're standing. Are you making yourself in control of the situation, or are you just floundering hoping to capitalize when the other team fucks up?
---
Are you prepared for the next fire fight? You really need to be ready, in your mind, to fight for the room/area you're trying to hold.
---
Also, sometimes you just have bad games. Your eyes don't feel so sharp, your mind is lagging, your teammates are miserable and toxic, something can be off and you have to walk away for a bit. 
---
You probably still got a common for someone you don't own
---
This would be better as an option you can turn on. Like „idle operator selection“ and then you can chose what ops you want to get picked, maybe several ops for both sides. 
---
Yea after this clip happened I quit siege until operation health was over and my response was “Seems legit”
---
She looks like Tom Cruise...
---
This is perfect.
---
I don't get this. Is it just grouping them with other ops with similar abilities. Or are you implying the ops branch off each other and are combinations of two or more? 
---

It’s a discussion :D every idea is welcome and at the end we find something we all could work with

Only on console

Welp, it depends. Are you on console or PC? I tried a few games on my friend's xbox and that was the most toxic gaming experience I've ever had in my life.

As far as my personal experience on PC, the community isn't too bad. I'm over rank 100, and have only encountered toxic players a handful of times. Though it's worth noting that I almost never solo queue, always duo or triple. Having at least one friend around tips matchmaking away from toxicity (at least in casual. I've never played ranked)

You don’t have to worry about recoil if you always one tap them 
---
Worst fear is a running Blitz
---
Ah, my mistake
---
Personally I like to just put my cursor on their heads before I shoot
---
Ok. Everyone is really chill and the owner is chill too. It's not strict.
---
Pro tip: Can’t handle recoil? Stab animation doesn’t include recoil
---
Watching Russian badger I see

There’s an operator named ‘fuze’ who was meant for players who like clicking buttons but not aiming.

Ever heard of a deployable shield?

Wow! I haven’t seen this one before! This is so funny! 😂😂😂😂

i got the same skin and honestly you can't tell the difference between the lebel and no skin, at least if they made it like rusty or something since it will add a bit more extravagance that just replacing 2 metal parts with wood

From my experience you need to adjust your ADS... If you find the right spot then recoil wont be a problem.

This isnt feedback and i will be beyond pissed if this is implemented. Being level 352, I worked hard to maintain a 1.7 near 1.8kd with over 1.5k hours in ranked as a diamond every season. Removing it would be a fuck you to the people who tried to maintain it this long, we can't even see peoples levels anymore, it makes no sense in removing either of those 2 from the game. It seperated thosethe ones who were high level high stats and those that werent

Okay so you're one of those kids who think everything is cringe. Got it.

But the issue is that even in the kill cam he was seeing, he couldn't see himself. The guy shot nothing in the kill cam while in reality as we saw from the screen shot, he could see a large portion of his head. It makes sense in reality that he could see his head, but the kill cams are showing him shooting air.
---
Lmao your pc got taken over the Illuminati
---
Streamers play through of the game

The last of us I believe ... not sure if that’s the game tho
---
I prefer team pay to win. Any team full elites. Earlier tonight I was Thatcher, best friend thermite, rando's were ash, glaz and fuze. It was a blast. 
---
Did something similar to that but everyone had an elite set on
---
Hive mind I guess. Maybe it’d be better if it were Korean operators and not Taiwanese. 
---
They did say it was a mix of Clubhouse and Oragen. 
---
The elite weapon skins for rooks guns have grown on me with time. At first I thought they were boring 
---
it was a joke 
---
i play music in the drone round and the beginning of the rounds, game gets boring sometimes.
---
He suggested it on a specific operator... What are you even saying. 
---
This isn't what MMR rollback is. MMR rollback is for when PC players play against hackers. It's a system so that when those hackers get banned. The MMR they have stolen from legit players is returned.
---
I dunno if it is also on console but that's what it's for.
---
What you're experiencing is just how MMR works at the start of the season.
---
Kind of, everyone except on one person had an elite skin. Same game too LOL
---
That is a cool skin, but not that cool:(
---
Every new op the last few seasons has had a unique sight for Theo gun. He means their red dot should instead look like this, just for them, like Mozzie Holo, Nomad Reflex, etc.
---
Internet speed isnt really an issue when it comes go games it's usually ping, make sure the servers you get are actually your area and weird ones, if you're on PC you can fix it in one of your config files I think. Also look into ping issues with siege on google, could also be packet loss which would be an ISP issue
---
Vortex as well. Great company, products, and warranties. I have a Vortex UH-1 on my AR.
---
Oh wow, that's actually kinda cool.
---
That almost happened earlier in the same game, except one guy didn't have an elite skin
---
How long will this event be going on? I can’t sub to bikini until April 1st and I don’t want to miss out on this
---
This makes me nervous honestly.
---
Yeah I don't know what it's called MMR loss or something. It's just really annoying to deal with

I hate the NRA as much as the next dude who wants the NFA repealed, but they have actually done a lot of good to some people. It isn't easy starting up a gun-range/gun-club.
---
There's a massive bureaucratic nightmare associated with starting a gun range. In Georgia you have to pay 10,000 bucks for some fucker with a Geiger counter to make sure the ground isn't radioactive because... reasons... Never mind the ridiculous liability insurance these guys must pay. OSHA lead safety inspections (not unreasonable, IMO, just saying how expensive it can be).
---
Compressor room i think
---
For those who are interested the name of the range is Rio salado sportsman's club. A good range to shoot, for only $20 you can spend the entire day there. Im surprised you didn't get yelled at OP the staff there is extremely strict about everything.
---
I'm not getting progress on any club challenges right now.

Its unfortunate but the season pass ain't worth it unless you don't play often enough to earn the ops. But if you're buying it for that, well Ubisoft considers the cosmetics fluff to pad the price.

I'm level 235 atm and i still have yet to get a single black ice. It's come to the point where my friends who have picked the game up a few months ago have one or two.

Sorry I can’t see what you are talking about because it is recorded on a phone even though every console and pc has a recording device available or installed by default and you chose not to use it. 
---
It makes it so it's much more comfortable to spend money on the lottery, good luck to your Numbers!

Honestly it's the fact that it's a team based game that can be very challenging. Factor in the friendly fire and 12 year old whiney kids and you get a cesspool of a community.  People will team kill you for anything, I got tked today for using the new character then kicked right after and I was at the top of the leader board. Honestly they need a better reporting system and punishment for team killers. Reporting people to fair fight does absoutley nothing and its bullshit.

Its not right to put ash in the same category as bb and lion just bcoz she is slightly harder to hit. She follows basic game mecanics, unlike operators above, but she has a little more chance of wining gunfights. If a player has Better aim, than ash he is fighting against, he is still more likely to win, which is not true for bb. 
---
Article 5 is absolute trash.

I’m in the south so ranges are a bit more casual and lenient. But there’s still ALWAYS that fudd at an outdoor that tells me shooting three shots in about a two second time, then drawing my sidearm to follow up 3 more shots is too dangerous. Even when there’s nobody else around. 
---
I knew something was off with the leaning mechanic. Who has the advantage while learning? The one holding the angle or the one who's peeking?

no there isn't. it's a glitch.

AUG is probably the easiest to control.

No. It's basically saying that whenever Cab gets an interrogation, all the defenders just rush the outside attackers

God, you arent kidding. Theres a range I love visiting cause its cheap and the staff are super nice, but the old rangemaster rules with an iron fist. Got kicked out for "firing too rapidly" despite the fact I was firing a bolt action single-round capacity rifle (Lee Enfield .410). Ive seen him chew out and toss people for loading magazines too quickly

If you forfeit the match your spending time being banned for quitting a ranked match. Why waste that time when you could tough it out, and then start a new one right away. Furthermore, the other team would probably appreciate the challenge of a team who is committed to fighting back. It’s just good sportsmanship. 
---
It is not german🤬🤬🤬🤬

Its that this shouldn't be legendary, it isn't different enought o be that rare

Okay thanks

Reflex shots hit on the point of the triangle not the center.  Holo I believe is the dot in the center.  It all comes down to preference and visibility.  I'm gonna assume you're an Ash main who lost the R4-C ACOG?
---
Yeah I understand though I guess I'm just salty for placements lmao 
---
You obviously have never understood to accept the surrender? You don't get banned, you lose the match and queue for new one. I don't leave the match, I'm just trying to get people to understand that we could be spending our time more wisely than being demolished by a team we shouldn't be playing against.

The fact that the 249 uses mags is just fucked up

i hope i could buy this in real life alpha pack
---
In that case you should allow attackers to be able to destroy their drones as well. He already have 3 that he can either capture because you don't care about notification about pest, or he can shoot it straight at you... so when I see him, I should be able to self destruct the drone, especially if its 5 seconds till the end of prep phase...
---
Mozzie is actually on the edge of being OP as is, being able to capture 30% of attacker drones anyway.

Now the question how long they need for a patch :/

Yeah but imagine, your team is retarded... you're shooting with a LMG+Acog and they all run into your line of fire, congrats you made an ace in reward you have a 24h ban because before you also accidentally TK your teammates...

Yeah like everybody... Unless you're crazy and stoopid
---
If you buy an Elite you think its cool you will start playing that operator 
---
If planned so, maybe best with IDF ops since they made it.
---
Regarding teamkilling, I assume you are a new player. That is perfectly normal because you haven't got your game sense yet. That phase will pass as you get a feel for when your teammates are likely to walk in front of you.
---
As for teamkillers going after you, either shoot him dead or let him shoot you then next round frag him. If he kills you again, he is kicked out of the game. If you kill him then you are even. Depending on the teamkiller, he will either target someone else next round or come after you in the last game where he will frag you and he will be kicked leaving your team 3 v 5 at the beginning of that game.
---
I don't see how this is taste of their own medicine... They want you to get banned. They got a win. 
---
That's only true if you don't aim for the head. Which you pretty much always should be.
---
That’s not the point. The point is that he took someone else’s art and reposted it. Which is a shitty, internet-attention-seeking thing to do.
---
Sadly i don't have that archaic gun law either.
---
As a casual player didn't know that, thank you.
---
Um.. they're good? Idk what you want us to say 
---
I’m surprised no one knew it was that one zombie game. I got it right away, but that’s probably because I played it like, 50 times already
---
Other people at the range. "Fing crouch lean spamming asshole."
---
At least 1,500 of those better be hostages. 
---
i understand its realistic and all, i just want to make sure its the same for everyone and not just something you can disable it in options
---
Pointless. Why? Jams only happen if you do not upkeep your weapon and these are operators. Their weapons are good to go
---
The question is going to be asked, and as one Fuze main to another, how many have been killed? My record is clean
---
I play xb1 r6 vertical:60 Horizontal:60
---
Pc or what? Because I want to know how to become an expert Fuze
---
Tannerite and 55 gallon metal drums. It's fun shooting them and watching them explode but the real fun happens when you have metal shrapnel covering a 50ft radius.
---
Personally, I’ve only seen it in replays, but in the replays, the arms also get shot which mean that it’s not just a killcam thing

What happened, did I miss something

I've actually been keeping track since Black Ice. I've actually not killed a hostage since I've kept track. HOWEVER, when I first started playing (I've been a day 1 player) I know I've killed two hostages in casual play. First time was on accident (I thought 10m was a good distance away), the second was for laughs.

Do you understand that kd does not mean lots of kills?
---
It's just a ratio, you are going to tell me the support player who dies more as thermite is actually better?
---
You can have only 2 kills per round and one death and have a kd  of 2.
---
So that's worse than the "support" player who dies 5 times per round and gets one kill because he is not a "fragger "?

You need to get your logic checked it's lacking.

Send a support ticket and get in contact with Ubisoft Support. Even trying asking for compensation since one of the biggest rewards I look forward to in the season pass is playing the operators early and it looks like you lost that ability.

They may be doing the Jager weapon skin challenge. People get aggressive when skins/charms are involved.

I realized that maybe we were talking about different headgears. I meant the default one.
---
If they put a gun in the game it's meant to be used. Glaz has a fire rate heavily faster than the bosg and a lot of bullets before he has to reload. That's why they nerfed it.
---
imagine if ADS was realistic in Siege, it'd be a helluva different game. 
---
Next week Nomad, Kaid, Clash, Maverick. Next season Ash, Rook, ......, ...... 
---
ok? 
---
If they can take away an attackers acog, they can do anything. 
---
It's because you brothers files are for his account not your so no matter what you are to do it wouldn't work because it's not for your account.

I remember seeing this at least twice before this.

*slow, impressed clapping*

They said they won't take acogs from 3 armours

Even though I haven't played Ranked yet (so I'm unaffected by this issue), thanks for the updates and communication with the community! :)

I was clowning him. It’s not each their own but it’s something that I think everyone should experience at least once.
---
My rifle is two pieces (upper and lower) i bought separately both are from Palmetto State Armory. The rifle itself is chambered in 5.56, but I was shooting .223 ammunition.
---
Because it’s a close quarters weapon. There’s no point to put a longer range engagement optic on an MP5 
---
They give only one set per season?
---
Usually how we do it in the American army too. I see some guys do the knee thing but it looks uncomfortable 
---
Yes and no.
---
Yes: His gadget placement either needs to be quicker or quieter. Either or. I've learned that at high level or even lower level play, Fuze should be played with his WEAPON in mind, not his gadget. I play Fuze for his ability to frag with his AK. The highest DPS rifle (I think third overall in the game, but the best overall in terms of all distances) is great. If I have an opportunity to use his gadget then I do, but placing on windows is super risky due to sound and speed of placement.
---
No: I've gotten used to playing as him in his current state. I don't think it's some massive Fuze rework we need, it's a speed-armor balance rework the game needs. The focus is very highly favorable to 3 speeds. I wouldn't say no to a speed buff to Fuze though(especially because they made Blitz a damn nightmare at 2 speed in combo with his shield run ability). 
---
Jajaja
---
ehhhh...
---
about one season?

Just google “diarrhea”

Ubi doesn’t count teamkills that happen just before or after killing an enemy. E.g. when someone runs in front of you when you’re in a gun fight

That’s a very, very, small benefit

Seasonal skins have certainly gone downhill since Y1/ Y2. It always feels like there’s only one decent skin per season now, and even that’s not worth 28k renown.
---
I almost screamed imagining this

Well once I get back home, maybe we can play

Metaphorically yes, but also headshat is what I use for the past tense of headshot

I was just messing around with the attachments and found thats what I like on mine

I live in Kentucky and never shot a gun in my life until I went to Las Vegas. 
---
Unusual representation of wealth, nonetheless accepted
---
No because pros play differently then average players and prefer low recoil weapons over quiet ones. That's why most pros like the MPX and UMP despite the rest of the community hating these weapons. 
---
Jar Jar Binks
---
Distance of the range has nothing to do with it.
---
That said, some people who are into shooting are what are called "fudds"(After [Elmer Fudd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Fudd).), and tend to feel that things like manual actions, single shot guns, only loading one cartridge/shell at a time instead of using a magazine, and waiting several seconds between shots are the only way to use a gun.
---
**Elmer Fudd**
---
Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in  the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series, and the de facto adversary of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself).

Can you post link to these website because I didnt find any good website where would show new layouts of new maps. It is hard to learn new map especially these labyrint maps.
---
ingame, spam qec and you'll see ;)
---
(spam leaning and crouching basically)
---
No witch hunting 
---
Yeah using his gadget with his weapon set is low key a skill. Many times I use his gadget as a trap or a distraction for me to get roamers.
---
Yeah it’ll happen lol
---
Ideally, you kill the cav only. But TK is better than interrogation. Most people get this. The salty teammate who doesn't probably deserved the TK anyways. 
---
Well nothing much that happens on internet forums changes anything directly. It's just people communicating.
---
Thanks though

Mute, block, report.
---
Also the lean is something you should practice anyway if you want to get practically better for shooting scenarios with cover. It's hard to practice at non open ranges. Use a door stood up directly in front of you. Don't crowd your cover. Three or four feet back. When leaning practice your transitions and put your inside foot forward. Slowly push your body weight forward on to your front foot until you barely pixel peek past the cover. Actual leans are less a full body lean left or right and more a geometry trick for holding long hallways without exposing yourself/longer angles and keeping cover. Also try it while down on one knee. While gun Is pointed in a safe direction have a friend check how much of your body is exposed while doing so. Have fun and be safe. Open ranges like the desert offer a lot of fun training you can do that can mix up the basic I'm shooting at targets things.
---
How long were you already waiting, that you even thought to take the first picture?
---
It sucks, just got to move on to the next game, and just report them.
---
What were you shooting?  Because shooting a .22 casing at anything farther than 20 feet with a pistol is kind of unlikely. 
---
I think they call this parracide
---
&gt; 240p in 2019
---
Wow someone got mad. And you just made s list of why you need gun control so not sure what you're point is. 
---
AFAI noticed: sound range got dramatically lower, steps sounds are audible from only few meters (no matter how heavy operator is), issues with thermite, thatcher, hibana, maverick &amp; mute are still there, drones tend to be completely silent when not jumping (small hops while stationary are still there).   
---
Other things worth mentioning: overall lower FPS count on every map with the same settings, spectator bugs (looks like enemy shoots air on killcam), new aim camera placement is buggy, reverse dropshot is here, hit reg is "weird", some weapons s.a. Maverick M4 doesn't land shoots in ACOG arrow, client-sided debris got even worse, C4 is completely broken... I can find at least dozen more issues.
---
No
---
Defenders, roamers more
---
Yes, sometimes
---
I have no idea, you might be able to find out through google, but they do on black fridays, and on holidays, idk what else there could be tho.
---
Instead of reinforcement, make him barricade doors and windows 50% quicker.
---
We have gun control. You hear me? We HAVE gun control. It ain’t work.
---
how does this be fine but i post a post about a genuinely good alpha pack post and i violate rule 7?
---
Yeah coz ranked seems to matter sooo much these days... like I haven’t played a single serious match this day I’m not even kidding. Every game we’re ppl “trying to drop to copper for some reason.... team killing and team damage 
---
Our criminals rarely have guns either 
---
Only organized criminals have them and normal „unarmed“ officers don’t deal with those 
---
Also they have their gun in the car or hidden 
---
&gt;Does this usually happen after the start of a new season due to some sort of invisible rank 
---
yes. Casual has a separate rank which resets at season start.
---
Fun times for better players, less fun for others
---
Ut is ment for athis
---
1. Recoil to my knowledge doesn't change. But if it does it's very minimal.
---
2. Tracers appear but they are incredibly hard to spot.
---
3. Suppressors work best on high damage or fire rate weapons.
---
4. Yes it can, but it's very uncommon for it to give you away. 
---
Carlos Ash Sanchez
---
When i play ash i do roam clear, so i think of ash as of perfect off-site warrior. She is fast so i can rotate anywhere, i can create rotations very quickly and flashbangs are very strong in clearing solo enemies. Also i might pick ash if i dont know Who else to pick just bcoz she is my most played operator. I dont think of her as of an operator i pick just to abuse bad netcode or something. 
---
Please do Jackal after the original ops, I think you would nail it with an outrun style background 
---
Additional Notes:
---
&gt;I couldn’t get the lower floor to bust with sledge. 
---
&gt;&gt;Explosives work best to blow it out
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Frags CAN be thrown through the holes
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you can’t get the subfloor to blow out you can shoot it out
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maverick will make the quietest holes up there. 
---
I’ve never been killed using this and I play in the low plat realm. 
---
Yeah bro white privilege 
---
On a side note it’s cool to see someone not using an acog and apparently if you don’t use an acog according to some you must be a “new” player 
---
I reported all three of them after the first match. I really felt bad for the people that they were entering text for. They were all so confused and getting so mad.
---
And a mad max elite skin would be better 
---
Tell me again what's reasonable about 922(r), the nfa, Dianne Feinstein's 2019 Bill, and all those other *common sense* gun control out there. I must have forgot.
---
Was it the part where putting foreign furniture on a gun with more than 10 foreign contents lands you 10 years in federal prison, or the part where putting a stock on a pistol lands you a 250,000 dollar fine.
---
Sorry, I just keep forgetting.
---
Is requis the new danish op?
---
Watch it after he scopes out. It’s there. 
---
What?? No pros choose those weapons for that reason. They are playing valk, pulse, and castle because they are viable operators. Has nothing to do with the weapons.
---
Oh my sweet summer child....you didn't play in the gold era of Call of Duty multiplayer or CS:GO
---
So was it correct to read this in an aussie accent
---
Is this the new danish operator??????
---
Watch again. Something in the top right. 
---
I’ll join today!!!
---
I’ve come to really like the Holographic since the ACOG removal from ash forced me out of my comfort zone. :) entry fragging can be slightly more difficult but I find CQB-mid range engagements much smoother with the Holo. 
---
Well if they have weapons in their car its a different story but if a cop is completely unarmed then what would they do in the rare situation of a shooting but wait for armed backup while people die.
---
thanks I hate it

I wouldn't lean so heavily on the police.  Even in a country like ours (the US), sometimes the police won't risk their lives to save yours.  The Parkland shooting was an example of police being present, and able to intervene, but stood back and did nothing while kids were killed.

Just saying old pro league sets are coming back out. Rook/Ash Y4S3, from then on two old sets along with the two new ops from every season will be getting one. Til then next season is mozzie, gridlock and the two new ones coming out next season. Loving the rook pro league. Can’t wait.

Had that too, had a crew that played rainbow with me, I got banned and couldn’t get it for a while, in that time they stopped talking to me and one day joined my discord screaming and I banned them both, I realized they changed their nicknames later and I tried to apologize but that didn’t work, but ever since I got new friends and they are infinitely better :D

He’s a diamond, on match point, when it’s a 4v2. They’re almost guaranteed the round, he’s been diamond EVERY season, and he’s one of the highest levels in the world. Rank doesn’t matter to him anymore. He’s already proved himself. It was a joke for his stream and he came back literally 2 seconds after this clip. 
---
Nowhere near the scale we have nowadays. Every page usually has someone lighting their own team up in ranked, or leaving instantly. If you think both modes should have mm then you're a casual superstar.

Thats what he's asking, I think. Would you feel safer when cops don't carry guns because they don't need to or when they do just in case sonething does happen?

The large mag makes anchoring against pushes ez. His gadget is insanely strong. He has an acog. He is one of the most banned operators and a must have on certain sites. He is literally one of the best operators in the game.

Isn't that how it works ? Lol

Honestly on PS4 here Casual is such a toxic, shitty, and sweaty hellhole. Ranked is way more chill minus the fact there are Mouse and Key users from time to time that pick Ash and rush in not giving two shits and still manage to win somehow.

Yeah that’s the only elite my buddy has so when we saw the rest of the team rockin that goodness, my other friend and I screamed at him to go Ash (who he never used to go). He was actually confused as to why we were asking him... then it clicked when he saw the light.

In a life-threatening situation,  the average person’s heartbeat can be upwards of 175 beats per minute. A  well-trained tango is able to stay cool, keep calm. Their heartrates can be 70 to 100 beats per minute.
---
you cant control horizontal recoil. also you cant control it perfectly every time, so better recoil makes hitting that tiny head that peeks you where you initially miss a lot easier. or in cases where you spray transfer, pre-fire but enemy wasn't where you expect them to be etc. damage doesn't mean much if it takes same amount of bullets to kill.

I have rainbow and I play regularly. I highly recommend trying it out and you'll have more fun playing it with friends. If you want the game, get the standard. The starter puts you at a huge disadvantage in the long run. They may have even pulled it and now its only standard, but I'm not completely sure. It's very competitive and involves a bit of strategy. 
---
You'll play through situations and terrorist hunt for a while before joining your first casual. A lot of people just mess around in casual but it's still enjoyable. Ranked is where the real fun is in my opinion, which you can't play until you're lvl 20. 
---
Ranked involves lots of communication among your teammates and it is pretty much essential to winning a match. Callouts and tactical planning are key to ranked matches. Ideally everyone will pick and play certain characters with will give you an advantage in a round. Having a Thermite or even a Sledge can open up opportunities for kills. 
---
I recommend the game and I love it. If you don't like it, simply refund it. Good luck to you and have fun (:

i bought the fuze elite when it came out because being from the soviet union, his throwback uni is just awesome.  the animation with the soviet anthem in the back is even better. 
---
then i got jager because of the uniform, gun skin and the animation.  thatcher was just for the uniform and the animation.  frost because ive used her since she came out  (sniper 90 was awesome btw).  
---
and now i got hibana because she's one of my most commonly used ones.   
---
with all of those i would say only hibana and frost were because i use them a lot.  fuze i used a lot at launch but he still get some play time.  thatcher and jager i use seldom but just loved how those elites were made

Same here . i hear gunshots sometimes on my left constantly during a match

TIL that operating a weapon in a completely safe matter, practicing excellent trigger discipline, and always practicing the 3 rules of gun safety is being an idiot with a gun. 
---
Wow.
---
I meant put side to side. they look like the poses they do when they shit talk each other in the beginning of the round 
---
Trust me dude. I played with randoms last day, and got tgree recruits. Be recruit too, just for the first 1-2 rounds. It makes them happy. After 2 matches I got notmal ops and they didnt teamkill. Make them hapoy, and they’ll let you live. Or at least I hope so for you
---
sure that would be the easy solution, but that's not my point, i don't want to play recruit and i don't think it's fair that these players get to make that decision for me. i know this isn't the first or last time this will happen. My point is that these players are toxic and it tilts me. 
---
This sub is dedicated to the series why would we say no 
---
Now I do
---
THIS IS A BLATANT ATTACK ON AUSSIE VALUES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
guy on the enemy team wouldn't load in, I invited their three stack to my three stack's party and ragged on the random non-loader until they eventually got fed up
---
Do you have diamond camo?
---
Blitz isn't fast anymore lol. He's about the same as a normal 3 armor now.
---
I can see why people like the GEO ones, even if I think it's dumb because it goes from pretty clean dark one to a lighter gray with orange weird stripes. SDU(?) is just the same but even worse especially with Ying. Going from a pretty dark to a light gray/blue combination.
---
But the main thing all those I listed have in common is the fact it's simply a recolor of the original one with *maybe* some random-ass camouflage pattern slapped on.
---
While the 2 latter year 1 op releases (BOPE + SAT) got unique headgears and the same continued later in year 3 with CBRN (Lion+Finka) and GSUTR (Mav+Clash) and as I mentioned, half of GIGR (Nomad) got that as well.
---
I just think that the ones with unique headgears are infinitely better than the ones with simple recolors/re-patterns. The current season probably has the worst ones for me because I *hate* the weird "fall/autumn" colored camo on their pants/shirt + headgear. Maestro is close second though.
---
I’ve never been big on DLC/extra monetization in games but I justify these because I’ve kind of stopped buying games since I started playing siege. So ubi making 20 bucks every 3 months from me doesn’t feel exploitative or scummy. Plus for the most part the skins are really cool!
---
Here it is:

---
Will this address any of the lost MMR issues? or is that still being worked on to make sure it doesn't freak out and break more things? 
---
more like michael myers 
---
You should take his helmet off next. And there better not be another helmet under!
---
unseenable entry point in Outback is fixed?
---
Why acog so OP? I’m new 
---
This ain’t Call if duty! This is Rainbow six siege ! 
---
I don’t know they seem the same to me lol
---
It’s part of a worrying trend though. At some point the acog will be removed from the game entirely.
---
Clearly we all know exactly what Ubisoft is up to on any time of any day. If they're not going to fix up the entiiiiiiiiiiiire game all at once, what's the point of fixing anything at all? 
---
(/s)
---
It's what they do, now. They take the abilities of one or more ops, then give it to the other side.
---
See Clash and Gridlock.
---
That kinda sounds like a hardware problem because you’re only getting 90 fps with a 1080 while my 1060 can hold 90-120 on ultra. Maybe your gpu is being underclocked for some reason?
---
She caught the weeb virus man, be respectful!
---
Restart the game
---
It really just doesn’t make any sort of sense because the point of a belt fed weapon is that it’s *belt fed*. That way you have more firepower at your disposal. If you’re just gonna put magazines in it why bring it? Just use an M4, or even better an M27. Both are smaller, lighter and more reliable than a SAW. 
---
Which I *said* in my original post.
---
&gt; those things theoretically could be made of wood. Wouldn’t last very long though.
---
So you're solo queuing? Solo queuers aren't allowed to complain. 
---
Assert DOMINANCE

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Have. When i got five dronekills and they didnt show. But it just wont do it

It's ridiculous. Any other shooter I play the sights actually work.

---
&gt; It's a 8 year old game, there are thousands. And older sets are wayyyy cheaper than newer ones. And you can get any set as they arent limited time only like some other ponzi scheme games. 
---
My point, thousand of sets inside those lootboxes, you could potentially buy thousand of those lootboxes before getting the set you want (unless you can directly buy the a la LoL, in which case I don't really see the point of those lootboxes).
---
 
---
&gt;Dota is a MMORPG and its Pass starts at 10$ 
---
It doesn't matter what genre Dota is, my point was, there's a lot of games with BPs, but FN's is one of the best. Also your response implies Dota doesn't have in-game money/money inside it, which means it's inferior.
---
&gt;Only the ones who had bought the Pass previously and only after you grinded for it.
---
No, everyone had access to those challenges, which were quite easy I'd add (As almost every challenges in this game), but yes, you did have to "grind" 1-2 hour(s) of gameplay to get S8 for free.
---
&gt; Yes, you may have gotten it on sale (even though I have never seen it go below 20$ so lol sure) but whether you found the grind fun is purely opinionated. Very few of the base of FN is grind happy while most despise it. But to each their own. 
---
First, you're right that you can't get it below ***$20*** anymore (you previously had "free" copies with some version of the game, which I proceeded to sell) .
---
Now, don't get me wrong, I despised the grind (as I do with **a lot** games), it's one of the reasons I stopped playing, but still had a ton of fun with what the games had to offer (the weapons are freaking awesome imo).
---
&gt; Just saying that StW is not the answer. 
---
The answer to what ?
---
&gt; You dont, you gamble the more exploitable V-Bucks and because FNs playerbase is largely on the younger more impressionable side which is more easier to dupe into spending their parents money or better yet getting scammed by malicious sites. Dota 2 is a MMORPG with complex mechanics which inhibits most younger players as that isnt the type of demographic that is attracted by the genre. Less younger people, more older people who should know better. 
---
Those are just scams, and there is a scam for basically everything on the internet, Dota 2 has actual gambling sites.
---
And while FN's playerbase, most 12+ wouldn't be "inhibited" to playing Dota 2 if they liked MOBAs, also, adults addicted to gambling isn't that much better anyway. 
---
&gt; You just changed you viewpoint. After I pointed out Dota 2, your first notion after hearing the word lootboxes was to belittle the game and its monetization without knowing anything about it. I gave you another game with better monetization imo and your general response was 'lootboxes? That game trash inherently' so dont go trying to play the high ground now. 
---
No I didn't, just because I think I'm right doesn't mean you can't disagree, to me, lootboxes is cancer no matter what, and from the information you gave Dota's monetization falls short.
---
Your whole argument from my point of view is that $2 lootboxes (which contain one set and are dup-protected) is better than $20 (if you don't buy BPs and StW, which give you free vbucks) Set, I strongly disagree with that, you'll end up spending much more than $20 to get the set you want (from thousands of sets) unless you're extremely lucky, your answer to this is the marketplace, but if it's close to anything I know, any set worth getting is probably around or above $20.
---
They need to buff vigil and turn cave back to normal
---
Well thought out rebuttal 
---
I came up with an operator idea forever ago which was an attacker that put out a device that heavily muted and nullified all sound in an area. I wanted her to be a counter to bandit tricking and a good fragger because defenders wouldn't see her or hear her bullets. It would work for all sound in an area so there was some semblance of defenders being able to use it as well.
---
I really hope the attacker isn't just a toggle . It's been done before
---
&gt; DUPLICATES 
---
I'm well above level 300 and have spent ALOT of money on this game so 99.8% of the packs I open are DUPLICATES followed by more DUPLICATES then MOAR
---
DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES DUPLICATES 
---
yeah i just got this - also told me i got disconnected and didn't earn any renown, even though I could stay in the game. Weird
---
I'm just confused as to why
---
We fixed lean spamming but now you're going to die before you even round the corner
---
All my friends think I'm crazy when I say that Mozzie is really Owen Wilson, finally somebody agrees with me
---
It's been a core aspect of this game from the beginning though. It's the operators who have no particular counter that end up being vary degress of OP, such as Lion, Mav and Glaz (since his thermal scope). 
---
‘Course that’s an ace
---
My friend sent it to me

It’s been two seasons since the bad sound and FPS has been an ongoing issue since the end of last season. No acknowledgment from the devs about either issue even though countless pros on twitter and a lot of my personal friends being affected by it

---
Same
---
Mine has been on 19 for the past two days.
---
Same for me. Very annoying.
---
I leave at any time whether it is 3-0 or 3-3 or even 0-3 if acts as if I am still in the game and that I've never left and if my team wins I get a W if they lose I get a L  but I never ever get a 15 minute ban or anything 
---
Not that they've mentioned
---
That’s what I was thinking 
---
I am a recruit and i have blown myself up more often then all of al-qaida together.

If you ask me why, theres no real answer on that. I know im not the only one.

Its like sex.

Oh shut tf up

I rarely ever see Jackal run that often. Feel like he is in a really good spot as is.

Yeah, I played since alpha. I miss those days. Breaching charges filed the room with dust. Players talked and tried to play as a team. Running seemed a lot slower. Those awesome splash screens. A lot of good shit gone.

How does one download R6 and still have time to play?
---
&gt;100% pickrate in pro league  
---
100% pickrate in pro league =/= OP all the time.  
---
He and Echo are both picked and banned heavily in PL for two reasons: Intel and Plant Denial.  Not for how strong they are.  
---
&gt;Clash is pretty OP  
---
If you're someone who has no idea what they're doing and can't communicate worth shit with your team.  
---
Her abysmal pickrate and *A LOWER WIN RATE THAN TACHANKA* disagrees on her being OP.  
---
&gt;Mav is very OP  
---
If you're not paying attention.  He's strong, but no overpowered.  
---
&gt;Kaid's shotgun is a sniper  
---
With heavy recoil and steep drop off due to being a shotgun.  Doesn't mean it's OP.

*pineapple noises*

No.

They are modeling computers for CAD. Nivida quadros 40-50fps on all low lmao.

I actually forgot about this, it was soooo good lol
---
See the only reason I disagree is because bmi in general is bullshit. Medically defined she has a bmi of 32.3 which is under the obese category. Now take someone like Brian Shaw 4x World's Strongest Man. He is 6 ft. 8 440 lbs with a bmi of 48.3 he is considered severely, severely obese, yet he goes to the doctor regularly, is completely healthy, and can probably rip my literal head off with his bare hands. I'm not saying they couldn't add more "definition" to the model, but there is definitely reasonable doubt that she is still well within being "healthy". But that's just my 2 cents
---
This got me killed yesterday. Our team had just planted on A site and I was running from hatch to the window to cover the hallway. I couldn’t vault so I repelled instead. The enemy obviously heard me and ran out from cafeteria and killed me while I was stuck in the repel animation. 
---
The sun ruined its eyes by staring directly at the earth

No, it’s designed to be on the weaker side to help balance her extremely powerful gadget

Would the healing cap stop at 50 or could you over heal like doc?

Same issue

I feel like there should be the text “Press any button to continue “

Leasion is one of the strongest ops
---
*The Lion Sleeps Tonight* would be better sound effect here
---
This guy
---
Hard restart your Xbox usually works but also this happens when you have multiple accounts running. Good luck 
---
I feel like her ability is so useful that her mpx is an average weapon for balancing reasons, so i personally would say no buff
---
The p90 in my opinion has, since beta been considerably underwhelming and weak in relation to the 'standard video game depiction of what a p90 is, but again it must come back to balancing ,,my opinion is it does need a major buff to be fun right?
---
But thats why im not a dev lol
---
*He sees you when you're sleeping*!! 
---
for a sec I thought you put the ops next to their corresponding icons but okay it's still pretty lit
---
No, PC. Steam started download 1 GB of stuff for r6
---
Lesion OP, Echo pretty damn good, Vigil is very good if roaming
---
 Valk is very good but is only good if you are playing with friends because it requires communication which you don't get all the time with randoms, same with Clash as she takes a lot of coordination
---
It fuking sucks 
---
Valk, lesion, mute, kaid
---
Pressing 4 while your whole team is still at the spawn location that is how you use him wrong 
---
#R U SURE
---
“Smoke main” doesn’t know the secondary is called smg-11 
---
Good idea but we can improve it. 
---
Every weapon has its set inspect animation, but if you have black ice equipped your operator just calls everyone around you broke. 
---
You actually can't fight back as a defender. It's a one way angle. On the defender side, they're below the instructable part of the ceiling. It has never been fixed since the games conception.
---

---
It's a lot of fun and I suggest you try it. But go with an expert first. 
---
That’s a fair point but Siege is busted in my opinion for the first weeks after a new season. The idea of the rich staying rich and the poor staying poor is probably true. As a pretty decent plat player it’s unfair when my squad goes up against these new kids and likewise when I go against absolute legends lol. My idea is far from perfect, but I do believe something of my measure should be done to how siege ranked works. 
---
There aren't any. He asked for an alternative to r6db which closed down. There is also https://maps.6guides.com now which is r6maps with fortress added.

It was a pc bug fix. Consoles Will get the fix via patch 1.1 probably
---
Dokkaebi's glasses are so huge it covers more than half her face lol
---
Daily
---
"xbox casual" seems redundant, it's like, double casual
---
They brought Favela back into casual because people missed it, but left it out of ranked due to it being imbalanced. To my knowledge there was never actually an intention to rework it..  
---
Bartlett was so massively hated by the community that Ubisoft kinda just swept it under the rug to be forgotten. If they are planning a rework for it, they are being hush hush, and even still, the rework would have to be so drastic that it might as well just be a different map entirely....

Yes, yes it would

You're basically playing cod at that point. Secure and Hostage have no business being an option in ranked. Change my mind.

You could also just have it so you can’t see the rank

any idea on when the patch will be put into affect

Just use holo lol

They made the map even worser
---
For ranked games the maps are clearly to big imo. The time pressure dont allows to play tactical. But hey, this game became weird anyway with fucked up shit like echo or clash. 
---
Oh I see it now

IF they at least did something VERY minor like share the leavers barricades on defense it would make a world of difference. Just allocate them to the remaining players randomly.

Thank you! I really love nomad and her "keep moving forward" attitude. She's a huge inspiration for me :)

A well-concieved plan. However, there's great risk.

*Hardcore Cosplay* 10/10

This is my experience through this whatever you want to call it. i have had this happen multiple times to me (but they were when i was in different regions so i thought it was the ping so i shrugged it off). If you see towards the end i pull up the scoreboard that his ping isn't something that would seem to impact what happened. I looked at this clip 5 times and i see me dropping from behind the wall. He didn't see anything and just sprayed.
---
I would love to hear from y'all about this let me know if i'm stupid and my head popped out or something. Please be nice to my post and others thank you very much.
---
Also i know i suck but we have those games so don't be rude just focus on the main topic.
---
Another thing is that you do see my gun just drop. that is after he kills me that you start seeing my gun and stuff before that nothing is seen. 
---
What do you mean? I've always done like this
---
Yeah it feels bad man 
---
He deserves something better.

If I get a lot of karma: “a surprise to be sure but a welcome one”

I’d love that a ton. Even if they added a recruits only playlist that would be a blast to play.

No, you arent my boss

It's a small thing, but ALWAYS watch killcams, even if they tilt the fuck out of you. You might learn a thing or two (new angles, strategies, etc..) from the people killing you, which you can then use against other enemies in the future!  
---
Also, DRONE DRONE DRONE!!! Don't just treat droning like a mini-game, try your best to keep them alive and use them to the best of your ability to give your team better intel and better callouts!

No it won’t this will take away the hole one shot kill ability and make him a good spawn peek op. They sadly cant buff him to fix him. He needs a rework. A complete new gadget might fix him.
---
And you won't have one if you keep drawing like this lol
---
unlikely but if it happens u can be the one who refunds the money for all those r4c skins
---
I went on a drone hunt craze for 3 games, just to get the black ice skin right after the 3rd game.. 
---
That third sentence was the reason he wasnt reworked to begin with.
---
Yea I didn't realize Ubisoft had a sale rn
---
Twitch drone vs twitch drone, brother vs brother

Yet I have, now what? Not everyone likes the same and that's why the world is interesting

I take great pleasure in being the 69th upvote on this post.

I'm simply telling the truth. Not getting spawnkilled is by far one of the easiest things to accomplish in this game. You simply take 2 seconds to be aware and watch for shit, if you do that you drastically reduce your chances of being spawnkilled. Can you still get killed even tho you're aware? Sure, there are always going to be spots you didn't know of and simply bad luck, but that's part of the game. A little gamesense and awareness will usually save you.
---
Does this mean I never get spawn killed? Of course not, I get spawn killed probably once every day. But every time I do it's because I played stupid and didn't check shit, and that's my fault for playing stupid.
---
*also downvote = salt*
---
Big gay
---
That’s pretty awesome. 
---
Idk mozzie looks pretty feminine to me
---
At least OP would be prepared for an assassins creed cosplay if they do get rid of some
---
I play ranked quite a bit though and I do great with maverick. Everyone else who plays maverick I noticed does great too.
---
Thanx

Zofia is Voldemort!

Not if you're the kind of person who beats ther fam

When you get past silver, the time to get a match takes longer fyi 
---
Well if you’re feeling generous...
---
You had to have played *before* the event started, and then you played during it also.
---
She has a travel book? Do you have any high res shots of it? I didn't even know that was a physical prop!
---
I didn’t downvote you weirdo. I didn’t say I was playing stupid, just annoying how there are four fuckin windows a boosted doc can run out of and gun down at least one person before they can react. Sure we could take our time to learn the map, my fault. But its still fucking annoying. 
---
Sexy. 
---
Oh ok that’s how I missed it then
---
With a leg holster for counterbalance
---
Im plat 3, and it never tames 2 min to find a game lol, last season used to take more than 2 minutes but not this season so far
---
I think it went over your head..... 
---
I'm pretty sure that version is the one that had to be paid for, literally just a dark version of the free one.

Can someone get this operator a Nomad main flair!

Get a job
---
I can’t see the T-posing Recruit?
---
Nice one pre
---
Maybe the clip is longer then that I jus cut it down but he isn’t doing anything mostly just walking in circles.
---
Possibly I also turned on my laptop a minute before it happened but I always do that so you might be right 
---
As is the way of things
---
Just a joke bud but oky
---
I've played for 3 weeks and got silver 1. I am complete garbage if you're that good at silver
---
I really wish the Oil Spill skin was universal and not just pistols, one of the nicest skins in the game in my opinion.
---
Oh no an OP that might actually do something for a team other than abuse glitches.
---
I will agree on one point. Maps where there are like 6 different windows facing a spawn like Themepark are terribly designed and drastically increase the chances of getting spawnkilled because you have to literally check 6 windows on different floors right out of spawn.
---
I’d say sledge personally because his gadget is always there 🙈 
---
on tk damage reversal doesn't do anything to help in your current story.
---
Nor would it help if the griefing team would rotate TKing the same guy so they would never get punished.
---
I’m literally trying to get the exact same uniform and headgear right now
---
my first black ice was for the fmg, and I also have a black ice for the m45.
---
brother, is that you?
---
nah I did nothing they just killed themselves to me
---
Honestly depending on your rank I would just leave as it's just a game where it doesn't affect you in real life.
---
I never had an opinion on either of them, then I got black ice for the g36... so in my opinion, g36 best gun
---
Thatcher is useful if you have a thermite or hibana in the squad, sledge is good all round operator with a good secondary. I would choose sledge.
---
Sledge all the way. 
---
I don’t see the point in thatcher, really... I mean, wow, you can un-electrify walls..? 
---
Someone please prove me wrong I don’t see why people like thatcher someone educate me 
---
Exactly. This is just the normal salty post thats quickly typed up after losing a ranked due to two leavers as one of us got bodied by a runner out every round. We just never learn. After a while it’ll be like nothing to counter them though, just like theme park.
---
This makes me very mad...
---
I agree
---
Damn that sucks. I only noticed last night because my squad wanted to rush so I was running into the border like an idiot trying to vault over it lol
---
When the other team is about to lose they lag up the severs which causes a connection error and sends everyone back to the menu. This causes the match to be nullified. No one wins or gets the loss. It ends up just being a waste of about 20-45 minutes of your boosters and time.
---
Took me months to find out that sledges hammer can deteriorate
---
You expect her to work on her bike all day without going to the bathroom?
---
Maybe 50, I have work but when I play I only really do ranked
---
ok fine

here's a kiss *Muah*
