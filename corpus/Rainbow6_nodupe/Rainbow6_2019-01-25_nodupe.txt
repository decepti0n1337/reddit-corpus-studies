They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM.

Can't wait to see their gold play button unboxing
---
Smoke has good uniforms/head gears, bandit or hibana deserve an elite before him 
---
Castle Harlem Hellfighter!!!
---
What did you just say?
---
Yes! Give him a Harlem Hellfighter skin!
---
The only rework Tachanka needs is wheels on his turret
---
This passes as a joke today, huh? I got old really quick it seems. 
---
I just want the elite animation bruv. Let me and my smoke brothers have a second in the spotlight 
---
I have double the time played as rook as my next closest operator. I can't count the amount of times I wished I had armour, even playing as other 3 armours. Yes, his mp5 is one of the reasons I play him, but his whole kit offers way more than just the gun
---
I N F I N I T E.
---
The one where she does ash to mouth.
---
Something that I always notice in new players is that when they are in defense, they never leave the point (base) and they reinforce everything or if it is an offense, they follow each other until they get to the point instead of exploring other entrances. How can they learn the map if they don't explore it? It doesn't matter if they die, that's what R6 is about to learn, I don't want a simple game.
---
I dont know but it is in the patch notes. 
---
Thanks \~ *The enemies*
---
Trust me I don‚Äôt disagree but that‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt get one for a while because of the team liquid head gear or uniform. I‚Äôd love a plague doc uniform but it won‚Äôt happen 
---
I'm all for making more games like Titanfall 2.
---
Ok
---
I'd argue its more that teams in pro league demonstrate all the time how to use him correctly in his current format, so its easy to see why he isn't a priority.
---
You can zoom in with the torch?
---
Would u stop using ur main if he got that in an update
---
Yeah
---
Depends on your play style
---
Maestro is the shit. 10/10 would recommend 
---
Nice.
---
r/softwaregore
---
Not only the devs, but the community as well. Last time I pointed this out I was -100 downvotes. 
---
I most definitely would.
---
Harlem hellfighter would be sick!! But I don‚Äôt see it happening more of a 1980/ swat theme to be honest but change my mind. ( we just see lots of WW1/WW2 elites I‚Äôd love to see something different)
---
A situational op with that low of a pickrate should have a better win rate, especially considering this is taken from Diamonds and Plats who should have a decent idea on how to use him.

---
When will the person that got reported get told? I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be a permaban or much of a ban at all but when do they find out?
---
I'm gonna be real with you chief...  Nobody likes these patch notes except you
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more! But you have to think realistically. While smoke is a big player on defense, he hasn‚Äôt been in the Meta. So realistically I‚Äôd see a maestro or cav or bandit before him. 
---
Not gonna lie this is PERFECT!
---
Maestro use to be a god with his op hipfire lmg. Dudes still good.
---
we do indeed like that out here
---
Was excited to see Nomad until I realized the skin is for her AK ):
---
My b 
---
They find out if/when it happens. They're not told they've been reported, they just get banned/suspended if Ubi decides to do anything
---
Yeah they have voicelines for a lot of stuff like throwing grenades, seeing a player, losing sight of a player, stuff like that
---
I get the point that the mag capacity was to high with 50 bullets per mag. But ela had those 240 bullets before. And I dont really get it now why they took away those 40 bullets. I mean she does less damage with higher recoil so you need more bullets. And btw Ela is the only operator which I ran out of bullets with more than 5 times. 
---
Thanks my friend ill be sure to make more! Be sure to follow!
---
Soooooo good my dude üëåüèª
---
The trend of new ops being more well rounded made old situational ops look less enticing.
---
Do.... you know what toxic means
---
I‚Äôm assuming you mean rooms filled to the brim with C4? If that was the case, I‚Äôd be down for this.
---
His issue is the gadget 
---
Maybe only in Terrorist Hunt. Or like others have mentioned, if they ever add a training mode.
---
Agreed, remove Clash and Blitz, and rework Fuze's gadget, take away his shield, and make him a 2 speed. He'd be far better then.
---
*cries in ADS*
---
I entirely agree, this game needs to be slowed down before rushing is the only meta
---
I‚Äôll have to after the other ones but sure
---
IF she is in proleague after the 3 month evaluation. There is a chance she is not put into proleague yet and they have to balance her more.
---
I also need friends, oh wait I‚Äôm a console peasant. üôÉ

Plus the mpx is a laser. 
---
R6S is the most toxic game community I have ever been apart of. I'm disgusted with all of you. Why don't you people wanna have fun? Is team killing and vote-kicking people you don't like fun to you people? 
---
:(( I love console tho. My friends forced me to move to pc
---
u trippin man
---
I hear you. I'm still hoping for the best. I legit won't be mad if they'll announce an Op Health 2. 
---
Bandit 
---
Clash's win Delta holy shit that's bad.
---
So, because one person does it no one is ever able to do their own of it? 
---
So, I'm gonna preface this with I haven't looked in depth in to ttk and bullets needed, but does the -2 damage change the bullets to kill at a distance and they wanted to make him less of a long range OP?  Or from full distance was is all tested too?
---
No, critical hits are when you deal twice as much damage. It doesn't happen every hit. A "it's super effective" hit is triggered when a moveset is superior to the defending pokemon's type. So let's say you hit a Squirtle with a Thunderbolt, Charmander with Hydro Pump, or Bulbasaur with a Fireblast. The move is the weakness for each of those pokemon, so it will instantly get the "super effective" text, but there is only a small chance the hit will be a critical hit on top of that.

---
I‚Äôd say they nerfed twitch mainly because she was blatantly too powerful (op in my opinion), but pickrate is certainly a part.   
---
Ash isn‚Äôt being nerfed for the same reason they‚Äôre holding out on a frost rework (which I disagree with but that‚Äôs beside the point.)  Ash is difficult because her gadget is already underwhelming, but just nerfing her gun‚Äôs would leave her in a less than desirable state.   My suggestion was always to remove Ash‚Äôs acogs, but give her an extra shot or two on her breaching launcher.
---

It will probably work averagly lmao. Picking that team isnt an instant win if you cant aim and dont have map knowledge 
---
Does anyone have a link to the other design patch notes like this one with the graphs?
---
Lesion is super good
---
The fact that he's the only operator in the game that can instantly hard breach with absolutely ZERO gadget counters will make him still very viable. Think about theater in coastline for example right now he can just torch the back of it and instantly kill a Mira watching her mirrors with the bugged sound making it impossible to counter without just staring at the wall 24/7 at least 50% of the time. If Ubi makes him super loud like they should IMO he's still going to be able to put insane amounts of pressure on whoever's in theater (who the hell else can disregard all your breach deniers AND also make holes in reinforced walls INSTANTLY?) but at least they'll get a sound cue making it fair. There's also still sites like Cash on Clubhouse where he'll still make it literally impossible to deny a breach. It's not gonna make him too weak.
---
Digimon‚Äôs better

Leaning actually used to be slower before they realesed Para Bellum. Quickpeeking used to be something that made good players outstanding, now you only need to spam it...

Also what was that shameless plug for?  A podcast or something?

Yes sir!! https://discord.gg/gDb9pqr 
---
Lol I play Tachanka now what are you talking about? But for real I think a mobile Tachanka is at least a good start to make him more viable if nothing else. Unfortunately his concept was kinda flawed from the beginning. Personally if he could set up and take down his turret much quicker that's all I would need to play him all the time. Maybe make him a two or three speed while at it

Use a other door?

If you've been locked out of the site by a Monty and there is no way back in, you either got out played or had a bad round.

It all depends what type of player you are. Kaid is a good beginning of match heavy defense op, then you have lesion for roaming and good in last stands and such.

Ah, I see. Rip OP

Very cancerous indeed. I agree with your point. I play on console and this kinda shit pisses me off

csgo has way more spots for higher levels, especially boost spots since most people wont expect them

It's not worth trying to win anymore. I'll just get kicked or tkd anyway.

Won't be playing or buying the next pass until you fix the crouch, e,q spam. The trash matchmaking and these degenerate 'smurfs'. Finally get this shit out of beta. And nerf Ash already and give iq her nades back ty. But I am fan of the cav and mp5 nerf.
---
Keren i just want the kids...
---
If trash aim gets a headshot throw a critical hit in, Love it!
---
now about what ops to play when you just start off play things slow don‚Äôt play risky for defense play rook and make sure to place the plates down for attack try out blitz flash people and punch them with your shield 
---
That was great! LOL
---
Most kills happen on 9 meters distance. While Lesion's SMG starts dropping damage after 18 meters and 18 meters is a lot. So those -2 damage won't really do anything unless Lesio tries to spankill across the map. :)
---
Very impressed!! Good stuff

i haven't been on Reddit all day, my bad for not noticing.
---
Honestly they might not of been able to recreate this in their testing. When it comes to bug fixing in a game/program, you need to be able to recreate the event that has caused the bug to happen. This allows you to look over the code and see where the problem is coming from. In this situation however it is being created very reliably, so while I can understand a situation where the developers might of not been able to recreate a glitch in order to get it patched out, I can say there should be no reason this should still exist in the game next season after witnessing this clip other than a lack of time. I‚Äôd assume they would be able to get this patched out soon, or else it‚Äôs going to be even more bullshit if we see this continue into next season.
---
I guess ubisoft has Ashtism
---
‚ÄúThat looks way too real‚Äù
---
This map needs to burn in hell
---
Honestly never know where I am on Favela and I've been playing for a long time XD
---
I don't think they see ash as an issue. Finka has less than 10% pick rate so a higher win rate isn't a good representation of her balance especially across all ranks (this chart only covers plat and diamond.) I don't see the point in talking about every single little piece of information when it would just be non info: "We're going to continue to look at [operator]'s win/pick rate in the coming months" is pretty much what you would see since any changes they are thinking about making go through many iterations and alterations before coming to TTS.
---
These charts aren't the only thing they use to balance operators, as evident by the fact that Ash, jag haven't been changed in a long time. Expanding on what I said about Ash; a 1% win delta isn't significant, while over picked, this is simply because she's the most comfortable operator. Some players in plat and diamond are there virtually because of their aim. They like to use ops like ash, jag because they're the easiest to do what they excel at. (it is a shooter at the end of the day) While I think it would be good to see some changes come to Ash on the test server to fine tune her a bit more, I really don't see how she is an issue. She doesn't bring much utility to her team and she isn't frustrating to play against. (Maybe just the player out aiming you which they could likely do with many other operators)
---
It's not that loud. It's annoying but pretty quiet.

nice repost

From what I personally have heard and seen, PS4 has the worst r6 community

Wow that's very interesting. I'm going to tag /u/ubinoty on this comment. Can you please forward any info you heard from the hackers to her. That would be very helpful thank you
---
Thanks, Ifunny has over hundreds of copies.
---
Haha alright üëçüèΩ
---
This sounds like a really great idea.  While I agree that Tachanka needs some sort of rework, and this idea sounds really cool, it kinda goes against his bio, since he likes using old weapons.  However, I think that his bio is really what's killing him, because it makes potential reworks very limiting, as they have to be using old weaponry to coincide with the bio.  Take my upvote.  Btw, if you have any more rework or operator ideas, come over to r/R6OperatorCreator, a sub made specifically for ideas like this, or ideas for new operators.
---
it‚Äôs against the sub rules and this is posted every 5 minutes. just because this is your screenshot doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a repost. why not scroll down for 5 seconds and see how many of these there are 
---
Sorry, just felt like laughing at this. I know its a repost. Just saw funny memes of one of my favorite games
---
That‚Äôs so weird. Can u still shoot at frost from your POV?
---
Who tf actually puts a PC in the living room hooked up to a TV...
---
This is my opinion m8 you're not changing it
---
I think his main problem is the fact that he's a two speed operator. He should have never went up from 1 speed. Even back then Ubisoft changed FBI recruit shield down to 1 speed because they thought he was too powerful.
---
I also only play FPS games on my PC. Casual games so much better on console, because its plug and play. On PC, I always get the temptation to squeeze every frame to get the best quality. Also, games with quick save/load (feature only on PC, on games such as Deus Ex) ruins the experience for me. Im a completionist/perfectionist so theres always temptation to use it.
---
Also, console casual fanbase are a lot bigger so games like NBA 2K have more players online.
---
no shhh, he's super bad, he needs a acog...totally
---
How long have you been playing? I'm kinda new to r6 and I'm wondering when this whole thing ends

8400 can handle 1080ti with 3% bottlenecking. My specs are perfect. Its maxed out on my 1070. Ikd what you want to say. Good day.

lol nobody does say that. mute is a strong operator and is picked plenty in high level ranked and pro league. 
---
What?
---
I would totally do it. I don't have a GBASP to put my cartridge in anymore but I load up emerald on an emulator every once in a while.
---
Who even said mute was bad...

Didnt know so sorry?

Because it's a half assed apology. Sorry for pointing it out, you snowflake.
---
How to lose a match in under 30 seconds.
---
I'm really loving Nomad's and Clash's.  Maverick's doesn't look half bad either.  I love these.
---
That's what their 'balancing' is. 
---
Mario became a heavy smoker I see
---
That's bs, the interrogation should happen once she slits their throat.  Instead of nerfing her, they should fix the bugs and glitches and little things like this first.
---
ok the flair is fluff not question i dont give a fuck if you actually explain to me how it works i made this as a joke
---
Yeah, Blitz will still shoot, you'll just be exposed like you see in the video
---
There aren‚Äôt miles of guts, there‚Äôs like 30 feet
---
I respect your statement
---
Okay I see your point except:
---
1. clash is already getting a buff
---
2. You missed my point which is just a way to bring her out of the gutter 
---
Look I doubt that you get tied for for least picked op and a literal off the chart in negative and not need a buff. Guess who's also in her place and getting a buff because of his pick rate combined with his win loss. Tachanka. The only difference is his hasn't been confirmed as to what exactly it will be nor when it will happen only that it will
---
Basically ubi uses the charts made from over all win/loss and pick rates to determine which ops need balancing. For instance this may be one of the first seasons blackbeard may survive without being hit with another nerf. The pros are saying hes okay were he is (though I disagree) so now it's up to how hes playing generally in the community which while his win/loss rate is currently high he does have a lower pick rate plus general voice is hes much fairer now then he was when he released.
---
It's a very useful tool for ubi to use and with out voices we can also speak and suggest to them further ways to help and test out. Right now it's a general consensus in the community that clash is vastly underpowered and is also way to easy to counter now that nomad is out.
---
Also lion is mostly only broken because his gadget has no counters. I do have a post on reddit about a way to possibly fix it with a buff to mute that would also allow for a minor counter to finka in the process. I'm bringing it up because in general I study the game and I'm a purest to it I believe keeping the gadgets on ops as close to the original as possible and finding other ways to balance them better. I haven't looked at the post in a while but it also covers a simple way to buff tachanka too.
---
Have you seen lean spamming blitz? It's actually terrifying.
---
His head is literally breaking the sound barrier.
---
Shields are so broken. So insanely broken. Leaning needs to be fixed and shields need to stay synced to where the user is actually facing.
---
Also a knife fight against a shield is a 50/50 win chance. Sometimes the shield can pull some insanely crazy bullshit, and sometimes knifes seem to kill right through a shield. There's no consistency.
---
My ideas: 
---
- Shield users cannot lean.
---
- When sprinting, shields go down.
---
- Blitz down to 1 speed.
---
- When knifing, they actually pull out a knife and move their shield to swipe instead of a smack with the shield is an instant kill. Or, a smack with the shield should do half health damage.
---
- Shields for clients should be synced with movement. Regardless of anything else.
---
Same with other operators as well tbh. Head glitching is becoming a massive problem. Moving fast enough with a lean peak means the animation on the client never occurs and they never see the peak. I've died countless times and I never even see the person peaking at all. I've even had a Fuze walk halfway into a room before and kill me whilst still not showing up on my screen.
---
Maybe it's an issue with their syncing, or maybe it is animations being broken when any amount of lag is there, but it's so fucking stupid and needs fixing 
---
no retard do u have eyes look at the flair
---
Can we give Tachanka a skin that he wears a metal bucket as a helmet
---
Shield melee animations are wack as well. Several times in the last few weeks I‚Äôve knifed a shield, only to have him counter melee me, instantly while his shield is out to the side from my melee, so I die to melee when he shouldn‚Äôt even be able to use the melee button. 
---
Agreed. I got tired of their music quite quick so I just turned it off and put on Spotify in between rounds
---
LMAO shields are fucking broken bc of Q E C spam and the fact that they take no skill. Shields are played frequently in pro league and high ranks have gents rules against shields bc they're so op
---
How many times was this called out on?
---
;)
---
Everyone needs to stop posting "shield is broken" videos, they're essentially reposts at this point with how many there are. Email it or tweet it to @RainbowSixGame if you want ubi to know about the bugs and what's not working. Everyone stop posting them in Reddit constantly. We all know they're broken. We don't need to see it constantly.
---
which ubi wants to be copper according to the matchmaking
---
Maybe lean/crouch spamming is the problem and not shields?
---

Don‚Äôt remember blood orchid. Sounds cool though...

They should add increase vertical weapon sway when switching between crouching and standing while aiming imo but then again I‚Äôm not a dev so I don‚Äôt know how things work lol

Ubisoft is a small indie company, give them some slack. /s

I bet this "bug" is just to disguise the fact that high and low league players are in the same party. Rather than address the issue they do this instead.

I'd add in another factor, they nerfed Zofia who, while lacking the 3-speed, functions similarly with her gadget of breach and clear.

---
Wanna take a step over from r/DestinyTheGame and say same thing happens in any PvP based game. I was calling for a broken weapon to be nerfed months ago, but constantly had people saying the same shit, to get gud, or play better. Devs don't care if a weapon is broken until a large streamer or a massive gathering of the community say it's broken and needs to be balanced.  Took months before Bungie decided to fix it, next Tuesday, after meta data said it was one of the three highest kill exotics in all of PvP ever.  
---
I think it is but then again i just joined the community a week after christmas and learned about black ice a week ago so meh
---
Y u do this to j√£ger

I dont give a fuck, let blitz be like that...in a game where he shouldnt exist

How do u see this
---
Or they can use strike pack (paddles on back)
---
This is great, also would help if they stopped making maps that try and cram in too many rooms.
---
It and WaveSplitter. Didn't want to say names because different community.

There will be 100 ops and 80 percent of the player base will still Ash, Jager main

Id compare it to my stats but it wont load

Those are still dedicated servers

That kinda bullshit is one of the reasons I hate shields. Like yeah what happened you you is bs but so is being completely covered while shooting. 
---
M‚Äôkay we can be friends
---
Why were you turning the camera to the right as of you are hiding it? xD it doesnt work like that..
---
Best bet, find some friends to play with, at least until your back in the saddle.
---
What do you play on
---
PC
---
Reason I can‚Äôt play casual is because of people leaving all the time 
---
Please fix this ubi pleeease.
---
How‚Äôs u check 
---
Exactly, and it really is just dumb luck on the part of the defender, since half the time they spray and just happen to hit you. I'm a mid plat on console (I like controller and am a poor college student so I couldn't buy a crazy PC if I wanted) and I play almost solely ranked and spawn peeking just feels like it runs the game sometimes because like you said, unless you're actually looking for it you die, and even then you still could be in a bad position. 
---
I've always felt that what makes siege truly unique is that it is a game of skill, experience and problem solving, and I treat it a lot like chess. You try to predict moves based on previous opponents but have to adapt to the situation. I dont think saying "git gud" is good for the community at large. Whenever I come across newer players I try to give them some tips I've picked up through playing and they are able to bring new interpretations of things I may have never questioned. But some people may not truly grasp the game as well as others and I feel ubi tries to help those people by nerfing or adjusting operators that help weaker players enjoy the game instead of getting frustrated and quitting. For example I personally agree with the Cav change because I feel that at lower ranks shes a menace. If you dont know to watch or listen for her or if you are playing against a really good cav (smurf or legit) she is tough. At higher levels this just means the approach that many had for cav will change, or they wont play her and that's okay, because the game needs to evolve as it always have in order to stay alive.
---
Saw the same thing today and thought wow can‚Äôt wait for ....oh god! What the hell?
---
It happens to me in ranked constantly. 3 rounds in a row the other day. 
---
Hm?
---
U should go see a doctor cuz i think u got cancer all over u fucker
---
Oof ps4
---
So... fix lean/crouch spam and shields aren't as bad...? You didn't really disprove my point that the spam is the problem.
---
Where do u find that
---
Rip
---
That's how shields create tactical pressure though. You hold a doorway and push people away because they have to fear your hipfire if you are close up.
---
If you see a shield in this position and don't have the option to rush him, simply shoot at the shield to ruin his hipfire accuracy, problem solved.
---
People act like shields are crazy op and then don't do the simple things that counter them, like basic communication with your team and not standing still while they line up a quick scope headshot
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I noticed that happens more in the lower ranks . I‚Äôm high gold it doesn‚Äôt happen as often to me now 
---
Teehee I‚Äôm your waifu IQ. Teehee
---
Yeah well I am in the lower ranks lol, so it doesn't help me..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Damn you know my healthcare just wont cover that much
---
Maybe Echo was playing Shadowverse, I guess.
---
o'course i do! :D
---
Console gameplay.
---
Rook and IQ
---
I especially hate run outs that rely on the 2 sec delay to be spotted right at the start of the round. Like peeking is anticipated but a full body or bodies really isnt and it really isnt how a "defender" is meant to be played imo.
---
I would say Frost. Can get a good few clutches even while dead, Blackbeard depends, are you facing enemies that are constantly headshotting you? Blackbeard will give you a split-second advantage but you need to use it wisely as the shield is weak compared to the old days. Both BB's guns are very stable IMO.
---
Blackbeard is kind of a selfish Character, if you care more for your team pick Frost. It's your choice but I would say Frost, her guns and gadgets are solid but Blackbeard offers Gun-play advantage for yourself
---
I play Xbox so can easily tell if someone is on a smurf because of people‚Äôs gamerscores and I swear like half the game is always smurf accounts 
---
Yep. In the current state of Siege I'd reckon Monty is the only balanced shield. Soft crowd control and very little offensive capability as mentioned by the other dude. Meanwhile, Clash and Blitz both have HARD CC (shock Ray/flash respectively), massively increasing their offensiveness, which can be exploited due to the fact that they are shields. 
---
Even when Blitz was shit teams still had a niche for him. Santos Dex back in Y1S4 (now FaZe minus Gohan) used it pretty effectively against cTm (now EG minus Retro) during the invitational. Recruit shield was still kinda meta back then but Blitz's hard CC still made a difference when coordinated properly.Now due to the fact that he's a two speed and you can sprint with the shield up, the necessity to plan your battles is gone. Closing the distance is easier than ever. Mint on DarkZero wreaks havoc with current Blitz even if it looks like he dies without doing anything. 
---
I think Clash would be in a good place if her shock ray didn't slow people down, and Blitz was in a good place when he was 3 speed and could sprint with his shield up. CC on a shield should not be combined with offensive ability. It's annoying, broken and uncompetitive.

Hey! Thanks for linking the original art, I just lost the link and stuff. The feedback is very useful. When I'm back home I'm gonna try the tips you gave me. Have a nice day! (I'm gonna reupload the better edit image in about 3 hours. :D)
---
I just say  no u
---
Nein.
---
That would be pretty helpful especially if you can toggle it on or off.
---
And maybe even make it so you can see the range of mute jammers or maybe even jaegers magpies like how you can see kaid‚Äôs gadget after he places it. 
---
Yeah i understand but ubisoft doesnt care about the issue while they know that people want black holo
---
&gt;Ruin his hip fire accuracy
---
&gt;still get one tapped on the opposite side of the room
---
I'm not saying they're op I'm saying getting killed by some RNG bullshit is fucking bullshit especially when the only option is run away before they get lucky.
---
Because she doesn't want Ela to take care of her baby. In Zofia's opinion, Ela's gadget is bad parenting.
---
I guess that's why recruit shield rush works; no need to worry about rotation syncing up if your only key presses are shift+w followed by melee 
---
Your aims on point though so satisfying. Ggs 
---
Agreed!!!
---
Casual matchmaking is hell, if you get a nice hang of the maps go play competitive, it is really better to learn there, at leas for me it was.
---
Same
---
It should show you the screen but with a flash symbol that tells you how much the person was blinded, like in cs go demos
---
Well, you **already** can see the jammer range while placing it.
---
thought only kids did this
---
steam version and uplay version require their own different sets of files
---
it‚Äôs casual and they‚Äôre giving hard callouts lol
---
Imo it takes away skill
---
Currently at work until 7am. You could add me
---
Sounds good I‚Äôll send you a friend request tomorrow 
---
If you buy it from uplay, you can't download it or play it from steam. Steam has another version of the game that you download from steam

So what does this mean? Their fov is different then normal ops and puts them at a disadvantage or something?

Okay sweet

---
I have like 200 something hours on Buck and Blackbeard I think.

We will see. I don't know if this is what they mentioned, but, they mentioned fixing something with "shields" (shield operators or deployable shields? Pretty vague) 
---
&gt;100 RS6 Credits for winning
---
That's when I knew it was too good to be true!
---
I‚Äôm just here to be downvoted too.
---
My preferred solution is to delete Blitz. I hate that operator with the fire of a thousand thermite charges.
---
So right man, this just happened to me last night smh
---
Why not both?  Maybe nerf the R4-C a tad so the G36 feels actually competitive.
---
What the fuck
---
Yea I‚Äôve got that down pretty good, I think my favorite thing to do so far is to smoke rich plant with him and just stand on the diff and let my teammates take them out 
---
please don't tell me you think the R4-C is simply "above average". 
---
I play ash when I'm having trouble landing my shots because her gun is a crutch.
---
Its not above average, its arguably the best gun in the game, by a very very large margin. 
---
Play the decoy.
---
Exactly.
---
I mean, it would be a good choice selection: for more tactical approach, you take G36C with ACOG, and for more aggressive play, you take R4-C with 1x sight.
---
Yeah i was wondering where the main problem was, the only time i have issues like this is when im putting in in a tight spot and it moves me while im placing it.
---
That‚Äôs insane I can‚Äôt play either one of them...

That movie style letterbox makes it look perfect
---
This is simply because they refuse to move debris over to sever side, making inconsistencies like this common in Siege. Very frustrating when this is supposed to be such a competitive game.
---
That's there. Dark skfe if ping abusing.
---
But at 300 odd, you're either kicked, or you are rolling over people like a god.
---
Give him 2 reinforcements on defense
---
I agree. I hate global operator abilities. They're cancer and are not supposed to be in a competitive game like siege. 
---

The hit boxes aren't the issue with your unregistered headshots, the more likely issues is the way the game registers the bullet vs the blood. The game will register the blood a frame or few after your bullet, you may shoot someone in the shoulder, move your crosshair to their head, and even though you hit their shoulder blood with come from the head because it's where your cross hair was when the game register the blood. Macie Jay has shown some frame by frame shots that show this. 
---
Not saying this is definitely the issue as occasionally headshot do not register, but it's more likely the issue above. 
---
I imagined that as she walked towards me. Thankfully it was just the bullet. Didn't make much of a difference though.
---
Pro level resets.
---
Ubi fix 
---
Heard about the borderless fix.
---
Does the sound gets messed up after one alt tab while in game?
---
Because if yeah, then guess I shall switch to borderless till it gets fixed, but I really hate the input lag.
---
Almaty, Kazakhstan. No idea what's inside tho, probably some hunting rifles and targets made out of cardboard and cans.
---
A few days ago I died as a monty from someone directly in front of me, while my shield was extended. Looking at the death replay, from the enemies perspective, my shield wasn't extended, so he shot my knee... (I was already on low hp)
---
Agreed its really bad ,I'm on a break right now cause of it
---
I feel like it's similar to a map like border in a way (which is also one of my favourite maps)  map knowledge is all you really need, for example say I'm defending drug lab, I'll take a lesion or frost, with frost I'll trap the drug room and bathroom windows down stairs and the window next to hatch upstairs, with lesion I'll stay upstairs and trap train room, stairs and caf√© so I know if they're coming from there with anyone I'll watch the main entrance, this is the easiest way to take out attackers since they'll probably want to come from there 
---
Attacking drug lab I'll go in anywhere except main entrance, enter through cafe or even the hatch above the second floor, it's important to drone out and take out roamers, then you'll have to deal with anchors but this is usually easy if you've killed all roamers because they don't have alot of ways to exit the objective 
---
That's just how I usually approach the map but like I said, map knowledge is all you need, in my opinion the map is similar to border in alot of ways, roamers can easily take out attackers but if the roamers are killed the defenders job will be more difficult 
---
[Here the are](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-342849-16/y3s42-designers-notes-mid-season)
---
That's how everything in this game is. I have two clips from the very same match not even an hour ago, both of Fuze; on one, the puck managed to be launched by a previous one's explosion and fly across a sizable room to me on the other side at a high speed, while on the other I placed the charge on a soft wall and the pucks only punched through my side of the wall and bounced off of the other, coming back into the room I was in and killing me.
---
You started it.. 
---
The only time I leave a game is if the map is terrible. Tower is terrible. And I dont want the ranked match pool - I want to choose which maps I do and dont want to play. Is that so bad? 
---
Valkyries cameras or lesion mines don't need an Area of Effect, but I see your point
---
Improving your aim
---
Because that would mean more coding and ubi doesn't especially like that.
---
Anything on the sound getting fixed?
---

You could even use your own tactics, how ever you play on border could also help(mostly how you defend on that map) , good luck!

---
Say hello to Borat for me.

Greatest country in the world!

Why not give Castle a passive to speed up deployment of barricades, fortifications and shields. It would play in to the map manipulation skills even more and would be a unique placeholder for the rework.

All other countries are run by little girls.

*"I trust that the ceramic trauma plate I'm wearing will stop a .357 Magnum round traveling at four-hundred and ninety meters per second. I trust myself not to move, not to flinch. I trust my team mates and they trust me."*

Because she is the only fragger that's a 3 speed with one of the best guns as well, all other 3 speeds have worse guns and need to stay alive because they have heavy utility.
---
Dude what are you talking about, i play this game from year1, lvl 259, plat every season, there is nothing wrong with the mechanics, it's the spamming that should be dealth with like i said that that bunnyhopping and spamming the lean should be fixed. But even i can lean as fast with an AR in real life,yes there should be something to prevent from leaning left right 20times, but the lean itself is fine. And yeah from the moment you spawn you are a target it's allways been like that. Use cover and coordinate with your teammates and you'll be fine the thing that makes this game "arcady" are most new gadgets and "1button" abilities. But hey, if they don't bring out operators people bitch, if they do : people bitch aswell.. it's never good enough for some people. Have you playes this game in year 1??? Bc it is ALOT better now 
---
Border and oregon, more simple to play than something like fortress which is a tangled mess and no clear path what to do
---
Border... and I feel like Consulate is in a good place too.

Why did you post it four times?

---
all my characters have trash aim
---
Right now they are experimenting with Kaid and Nomad and if they like the results then they might implement it on older ops in future updates.
---
If you really dont see the benefit of a game company ensuring its community is having fun when playing its games, then I cant help you. If the solution is to just enjoy the game for what it is or play another game, then the game will die out. Ubisoft used to be so good at interacting with the community and changing the game to make it more enjoyable, but it's become so bad that people are begging for operation health 2.0
---
Never noticed that
---
Really wow man, on a pc yes on a console where a controller is the default input method then it's just for the advantage.

Well it has a lower damage than most ARs, with a long ADS and reload speed. The only reason so many people love it is because of its ROF. But because of the low damage its TTK is lower than some of the other attacker ARs.

Well thanks for being polite about it

Can never go wrong with Lesion, he is probably the strongest defender atm. He also works with any map, site and team composition.

There should be lobbies devoted for controller and lobbies devoted to keyboard mouse, allow people to use them, but only against other players who use that device

Ubisoft said that keyboards on console is considering cheating but it is kinda hard for them to find people who uses keyboard on console.

Don't lose faith brother, Ubi will one day find a resolution for this problem.

It baffles me how people can be so wrong yet still try to justify their toxicity. Idk why this particular incident triggered me so much but it did so sorry lol

If you want to choice between those 3 i would say Lesion. He is very strong and easy to learn.

I can assure you im not hacking, if i were i would be a bad one. You can look up my stats if it makes you feel any better. I did know they were both there, and i knew where the holes in the garage were, so i began at one hole and strafed towards the other with the turret. 
---
I'm sure they're gonna change there mind when "BigNigga_69" rants like a virgin on a reddit thread

nope, i generalize a whole platform based on 3 months of crying kids that are 14-22 about how bad people are, in the same trash ranks as them. i am guessing you most likely fall into this group as it "hurt your feels" 
---
It used to be so that the animation ended when you hit their throat. Since ubisoft extended the interrogation timer, instead of making the straddling a bit longer, you have to wait until the knife has been pulled out of the throat for the interrogation to be completed.
---
That would've been great!

As others have already said, you can't do lean from the hip on consoles, no matter what you use, on the other hand, you can actually learn how to crouch and aim at the same time with a controller, plus you can also use a controller with paddlers for crouching and aiming. Cheers!

I was playing a bomb game last night and when I go echo I throw my drones out after I see/shoot or see a twitch drone being shot of now I throw them out at end of prep, I done this and left it on the ground to head to a relatively safe spot, for one of my random team mates to destroy my drone ( a friend watched him ) then blamed me for letting them plant, I did not team kill him or hurt him in any way but I was sop fucking tilted.

Not unless you buy the complete edition

That's not fair tho.  It should be right when you stab them.  It makes her way too easy to stop.  The interrogation is powerful, sure, but it's almost *impossible* to pull off.  If you manage to get that far, and you stab them, you deserve the interrogation, because it's the enemy team's fault for either going in alone or not droning enough.
---
Look at this clip.  Sledge just drops in without checking any of the corners, and he gets punished for it by Cav, and now she gets cheated out of an interrogation she got fear and square.  I hate that.

You a trolin, right? 
---
Even with MnK it‚Äòs impossible to lean without aiming(exept after throwing C4s and Smokekanisters :P)
---
You can also swap your circle/b button with R1/Rb, use clawgrip, or get a Scuf/Razer/Elite controller, so you can crouch while aiming ;)
---
The problem is fooking laser sights 
---
This just sounds like a rant from a kid.   
---
You rage quit 2 games due to not liking the map, YOU choose to leave your fault.  
---
The joining a match already in progress isn't something to whine about as since you left yourself someone else will be in your same situation. A way to counter it however is to try and find a premade when playing with friends 2/10 games I join seem to be in progress.  
---
You can't always play the full 5 rounds that's just stupid. Either it's going to be close and 2-2 for final round or 1 team will stomp 3-0. Sometimes it goes 3-1 :D when there's a breathe of hope of a comeback but it aint happening.   
---
So just forget all of the people banned for toxicity and team killing? Craig Robinson and Justin Kruger have done an amazing job with rainbow and with about 48 (I think) operators in the game it's hard to make everyone happy. Ubi knows that team kills could be accidental. I got banned for a week by accidentally team killing. The bans are at a good place right now.
---
I have:hot chopper-556 xi,Amarillo-mp5,grand inquisitor-mp5,troublemaker-charm,tavanier blue-doc,birchwood-glaz,conceal-kapkan,golden ivy-416-c,killjoy-m249,also skins for the Russian smg ,shotgun and the gign shotgun but can‚Äôt remember there names 
---
That's why you shouldn't reinforce kids' room. 
---
No waiting 
---
i actually tried but it stil didn't let me :/
---
Adds Titans to rainbow*
---
BUT can you get 3/3 Frost mats on the roof?
---
I also hate how sounds change on guns every round it seems
---
But they have a shield üòã
---
Umm I was joking... Yeah an essay long Reddit post isn't really gonna help that much.
---
Thank you 
---
The irony
---
That's nice though
---
This would be really interesting. I never intentionally TK but I‚Äôm sure the number is quite high after 1200 hours. 
---
Thank you for clarifying peniscunt... Very cool.
---
console for ya
---
Haha lmao skill
---
Were you crouch spamming or not?
---
You realize these stats are for plat and diamond only right? So she's been viable at very high level of plays. 
---
No i wasnt, when that guy spawnpeeked me yeah i did, but the rest is a no.
---
Maybe a Future Operator ü§î
---
How is that more unrealistic than the other WW1 steam punk Elite skins? xD
---
Hope they fix it I can't win any gun fights even one time I was killed by a kaid ducking and weaving with the worst gun in the game 
---
All I got were the recovery codes
---
Technically it's masturbating
---
If you can‚Äôt beat em join 
---
People get so impatient I stg
---
Found it funny that you started moving straight after it stopped like you were the defenders! 
---
You sir are correct 
---
You cant... You have to connect ur 2fa to ur phone or email. And everytime you want to login you got to enter the code you get from one of those options
---
Yeah i see your point
---
I play on xbox so u literally need ten fingers on both hands to do it which probably means they change their controller lay out which is even more sad
---
If you think that broken mechanics is a good way of balancing shields then uninstall my good buddy.
---
Everytime I get knocked back by airjab I always spam space out of habit to try to roll back like I do whenever I get knocked in Dark Souls 3 and try to roll out
---
what elite skin do you think is unrealistic? because they're all pretty realistic. I hope the suggestion you made was a joke because no only will they never make an elite recruit (rightfully so) but especially one so goofy and just plain dumb
---
Nope. You have to add a code from either your email or a code from your OTP app. You just didn't read the instructions.
---
Another good idea, small stuff that i never realized and ive been playing for years lol
---
Lmao
---
Lol Lion is spooky for attack and defense I guess :P
---
It's a sort of if you can't beatem joinem scenario
---
Erh, if you take away that minimal damage she does with the shield shocks what motivation the opposition got to move away from her instead of getting close for melee?
---
If you melee Clash unless the player is skilled enough and got luck on his side she can't even try to block shots aimed at her legs and she'd become a Mont-light on defense, much easier to defeat.
---
Her walk speed is already one of the slowest I ever played - which is especially annoying when nobody listens when you tell the roamers to reinforce the hatch above the objective and you gotta do it yourself with Clash.
---
With her shield clanking with every step and shes yelling like a drunken pirate, you can crouch-walk any 3-speed operator near without getting noticed as long as shes occupied by someone in front.
---
Her swap speed is already so slow that even when an opponent turns his back on her and you immediately start to swap, even with the slow-down effect the opponent can still turn back and shoot her in the face before you can get your pistol ready and god forbid aim.
---
And nothing will be done about it.
---
No, I'd say Glaz is better than Glaz. One has a scope, other has a scope
---
The lean and crouching just needs to be put on a stamina like cs:go and fortnite has done
---
But those aren‚Äôt always call outs, they‚Äôre room names but some are ridiculously long, and it‚Äôd be cool if you could customise the name to whatever you want as well
---
Its 2019 and people still dont know hoe to take proper screenshots
---
I wonder if they will fix this. Repeatedly crouching should only hinder you. You should have to stop to crouch and it should hinder aim. I feel the same way about leaning left to right, it shouldn't give anyone an advantage. I know its a video game and not supposed to be 100% realistic but the concept of leaning left-right repeatedly while shooting a gun is retarded. If your on a console these game dynamics really reward MnK players.
---
Haha no worries, it‚Äôs my strategy anyways
---
No problem thanks for the input. I understand how it‚Äôs supposed to work, the problem is that it isn‚Äôt. 
---
I'd rather they'd fix it 
---
It says TNP
---
I don't understand your question 100% but the answer is no
---
We will see i guess
---
Then you didn't follow the instructions
---
No offense man, but Clash is one of the easiest operator to defeat when shes alone if you don't turn your back on her and/or get right in her face and melee, and if she is backed up by someone, attackers should have the brains to flank instead of continuing to push the defended direction
---
Sorry man, I am not fully sympathetic. In one of your other comments on this post you say that r6 is a tactical shooter. Crouch spamming no matter what is not tactical, it‚Äôs cancerous and an exploit. I don‚Äôt like how he TK you and I‚Äôm happy to see that you didn‚Äôt TK back. Overall I like how you kept your cool but you show a bit of hypocrisy. You say how r6 is a tactical shooter but you crouch spammed and also said the lion, dokke, jackal, blitz team comp is fine. Just because you can do it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ok, and it‚Äôs certainly not tactical.
---
Video example on ps4
---
https://youtu.be/jxzg_4_ixkk
---
Holy fuck. What the hell is that thing
---
Iq and hibana 
---
Btw people would also run in front of you just to annoy you
---
Get good.
---
That was a reflex, but still, the penalty is not getting killed by yout team. And that team comp might be strong, but its defendable.
---
The crests on that make me cringe, especially France and the UK. C'mon Ubi, do [some](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_emblem_of_France) [research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom). 
---
**National emblem of France**
---
This article outlines present and historical national emblems of France, including heraldic coats of arms, first employed in the Middle Ages, as well as more recent, unofficial non- or quasi-heraldic emblems.
---
The French Republic currently uses two emblems.
---
One has been a symbol of France since 1912, although it does not have any legal status as an official coat of arms. It appears on the cover of French passports and was adopted originally by the French Foreign Ministry as a symbol for use by diplomatic and consular missions using a design by the sculptor Jules-Cl√©ment Chaplain.
---
**Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom**
---
The royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, or the Royal Arms for short, is the official coat of arms of the British monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II. These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the United Kingdom. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the British royal family; and by the British government in connection with the administration and government of the country. In Scotland, there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the Scotland Office. The arms in banner form serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, known as the Royal Standard.

---
Well most people use Hibana on hatches not Thermite lol
---
I think the only thing they have are their acogs. I think this nerf is enough. They are not op. Their gadgets are mediocre, and rook with the highest win rate has a low pick rate. Doc has a hugh pick rate but a medium win rate. I think they will be fine.
---
Me happy when kixstar happy :)
---
True
---
FINALLY !!! Hopefully this is what Ranked will be like next season.
---
finally!!!. i am so happy. thanks ubi
---
And not all aces are 1v5.
---
Hopefully this is them testing some possible changes to Ranked
---
Let's hope so. I for one am not gonna play any ranked while this is available. 
---
me2  :))))
---
Imagine the size of that dudes calfs.
---
Why do you want a 6th pick? Or even an Operator reveal? I‚Äôm curious.
---
Alright boys! Who's ready to sweat for those packed?!
---
*China wants to know your location*
---
I thought mayyyybe it would work until I watched one of Matimio‚Äôs videos from a few days ago where he talks about that. I realize now that it just wouldn‚Äôt work.
---
I don't see a universal skin in the post? Link?
---
Exactly! Its now or never, we've waited long enough.
---
Yes!  This is awesome!  I‚Äôm so excited!
---
This looks really cool. Too bad I have finals rn.
---
I‚Äôm praying hard
---
People probably wont play since there is no ranks and all that will happen is diamonds will go against golds and slap
---
I thought so, we and my squad are playing weird games: on some we play against monsters with diamond charms, on others we win with no effort at all. 
---
Last seasons we were all Gold 1 with 1-2 in Platinum, now all Silver and one Bronze. 
---
Idk what to think, we never been top players but not even so terrible. 
---
How many packs are we having? Only one? 
---
Thatcher‚Äôs headgear kinda makes him look like David Wallace from The Office US.  Does anyone else think that?
---
Is this in game or a design he made?
---
i solo queued into a game last night with copper, bronze, and silver on my team. so now i start asking people what their rank is.
---
you can buy the packs with R6 credits (i think 270 per pack or 6400 for all of them)
---
The sentence is confusing. "be" should be replaced by "buy".  Secondly, are you talking about twitch unlocking or bundle unlocking? Like which one are you considered the BS one? 
---
I dont/never have used him but friends who do really like him
---
Thanks for writing that article. I can only hope it gains traction. 
---
Will points be shown in this game mode?
---
Really hyped for this
---
YES. 
---
Am I the only one who would be happy with a OP health 2? The games slowly getting to a state where it kinda needs another one. 
---
So yes shields are broken, BUT it also looks like one of the two players here is lagging hard.
---
Well, that's like a lie unless you consider pcb traces wires 
---
Meanwhile ash is the only Jewish operator...
---
More depth, no more "they have frost" *bear trap sound*, some small mind games with 6th pick.
---
It adds depth and removes getting killed by shenanigans.
---
Could you imagine the horror of a spawnpeaking blackbeard?
---
My S A V T A 
---
THIS IS FUCKING NICE !!!
---
What other options do you have?
---
I currently enjoy playing buck, his DMR hits hard, and since they‚Äôve improved the recoil on his c8 it‚Äôs also quite good.  He‚Äôs kinda like sledge but I prefer his ar over sledge‚Äôs and he has another good option in the DMR
---
This is so cool, I just hope the packs aren't too expensive.
---
Wtf, on the ubi phone app, shows that I have 14 mins left to complete the challenges üòÇ
---
Holy sweet mother of Jesus. I've been waiting for this for *so long*. Lets go boys!
---
Can we got that as a wallpaper?
---
It's just fucking grey I already have that skin and it's a universal one I'm so glad that this is some of their top priorities for this game
---
The last week or 2, I think servers have been unstable as I've been connected to Brazilian servers a few times (I'm from the UK) 
---
I like to know who I play, so I can strategize before I drone. I like sixth pick because it adds an element of suprise/deception to enemy team, it can also serve as a tactical replacement to an operator that may not be as good/serve to your team's benefit.
---
First noticed it in-game but it says this in the post as well: 
---
"The 2019 Collection will be available for the entirety of the event and will feature a Headgear, Uniform, Weapon Skin, and Weapon Charm for the following Operators, as well as one Universal Weapon skin"
---
The full set cost 60$ wow, it's way too much for what it is.
---
I rather pay 20$ for an elite skin than buying those packs &amp; "hope" that i get what i'm looking for.
---
Even if 30% goes to the 6 prizepool, i think that  ubi' could win more if they review the price of those packs (at least 50%)
---
Also, so fucking nice that we finally have this kind of matchs, me &amp; my friends were upset everytime we have to play on Theme Park, ty Ubi for this. 
---
These are elite level skins 
---
DAMN GIMME GIMME 
---
As a casual player (playing ranked just stresses me out), I'm rejoiced to play it. Hope that if we like it we will get it as a pernament or weekend mode forever.
---
I do agree it is not the ‚Äòbest‚Äô example, but he didn‚Äôt get banned for smurfing as it is not a bannable offense, he got banned because the system thought he was being boosted, which he wasn‚Äôt.
---
if you like vertical gameplay, it's the best option
---
Usually the texture is drawn with that color. It's not as simple as typing in some code. They'd have to completely repaint it. You could apply a tint through code, but it'd look pretty bad. This is, unless they textured it white and then gave it a tan tint. In that case, simply changing the tint to black would work. That is likely not the case, however.
---
True, but how many times have you been taken out by a trap during a last second push? It's the same premise, just scaled down and put on the attacking side. Is the same argument gonna be viable for Gridlock* when he comes out y4?(if those leaks were true)
---
*Gridlock's gadget is supposed to be a barbed wire on attack that does damage the same as a Lesion trap.
---
It‚Äôs also worth noting that some of the money is going towards Pro League as well, and I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs an opportunity to support the scene. There are more graceful ways to do so, sure, but it is what it is. There isn‚Äôt very much to monetize in Siege. This combined with the Ten-Man style playlist will hopefully bring a lot of attention to the more competitive side of the game.
---
Scariest operator in the game 
---
No I'm sorry there are 2 operators a season usually, so there are 8 operators a year (4 seasons in a year). 
---
That I did.
---
I own the elite skin so the MVP is a thing. But the new discovery game mode overwrites the character skin. 
---
Thanks. I haven't been able to play today so i wasn't aware
---
I wonder if he'd be a decent pick as a 2 armor.
---
Almost seems like a macro 
---
Never ever say that BLYAT { - }7
---
Okay thanks, I was confused
---

---
It's nothing new 
---
I understand that Ubisoft is a business, but the prices they're charging for these packs are insane to me. You need to spend more money on these packs to get them all than you have getting the base game.
---
If you're going to waste more money on in-game items (that only provide visual value and not much else) than you have on the game, that's when you know it's becoming a tad bit suspect.
---
No he had someone behind him,you can see smoke get shot at by the indicators,he just wasn‚Äôt hit at all
---
For the most part this is what I do, but sometimes it comes to a point where my call outs or any communication is overshot by the nonsense. Which especially in ranked when communication is needed can be frustrating to stay quiet about.
---
Thanks r/Rainbow6, very cool!
---
Ubi pls can u stop with this cringe Clash bullshit? I just recovered mentally from Grim Sky main menu.
---
Nomad is a good choice
---
Haha nice
---
Oh okay, thanks for clearing that up for me
---
Nut
---
I personally don‚Äôt like this event, I like sides being switched every other round. Not every 3 rounds.
---
Thermite goes to stick a charge on a reinforced wall, and it just backs up a couple feet.
---
Perfectly balanced. 
---
How?
---
Yes hed be so much better. His gadget isnt bad, just situational. Its his slowness that brings him down from other picks
---
The new Proleague Mode
---
Of course it was an elite skinned pulse
---
Pro League Mode
---
Huh, I completely thought I was wrong. Thanks!
---
Im on after 6pm: HibannasVageena
---
Is that an actual thing?
---
no she is not banned in pro league. they added a rule where the pros go a season without the new ops to allow time to get used to them and make sure they‚Äôre not OP. that‚Äôs why Kaid isn‚Äôt in pro league and why the new ops won‚Äôt be in at all next season. she is good but she‚Äôs not OP
---
They‚Äôre just skins. Buying them is supposed to support pro league and so is the game mode.
---
he was at the bottom of the stairs hes not supporting the montagne what so ever, no one even went to the room doorway. bunch of bots
---
I would love to get one of these put on a canvas, blown up and have it as an art piece in my gaming room. This is awesome work.
---
So is this on live servers atm? 
---
If you've been waiting that long, why weren't you saving up? 
---
Who dat 
---
Oh damn I didn‚Äôt know about that
---
her airjabs are actually pretty easy to see. covering 4 flak routes is all well and good but means nothing if nobody‚Äôs covering them. she‚Äôs not difficult to counter and she‚Äôs not OP. 
---
He was watching the bottom of stairs that enough for me,I prefer if someone didn‚Äôt push with me,I‚Äôm the one with a shield
---
But you cant do anything while you are knocked out, you are left exposed for a about 2 seconds and most attackers place the trap about 1 room behind them so they can get the kill asap, same thing that was about lion (you can still shoot during the scan)
---
$50 for 24. I mean it's a little much but at just over $2 a pack you can get a few cool ones. Some of the uniforms are elite level so if you get those the are worth it. The skins and charms are pretty cool so for the whole set it's pretty expensive but it can be worth it. I really wish you could pick and choose which ones you want, even if the free ones were random and the ones you paid for you could pick. 
---
How much is it to buy them all? Not that I'm thinking of not buying them.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect it to be in packs again
---
I don't see an issue with it. It is just a special playlist to celebrate the proleague invitational.
---
And I pretty much only play casual anyways.
---
Fortnite also tried to get rid of the keyboard &amp; mouse thing. 
---
Sadly it didn't work out for them.
---
Hope Ubi will get to a solution soon. Playing Ps4 from the beginning but lately it's not fun anymore at the platina regions.
---

Clash has to be so ugly on every art, or wot, Ubi?
---
Please, this needs desktop resolutions! Please senpai!
---
Are you sure they did that on purpose?
---
And so far i have seen the new skins on dokkaebi,ash,doc and pulse 
---
yeah they didn‚Äôt want a repeat of Lion so they added the grace period for the new ops 
---
I started playing in Operation Health. Tried bomb, found it boring. Sure it is the most balanced gamemode, but that isn't always equal to fun in my book. I find secure area to basically be the middle ground, not as balanced as bomb but neither is it as unbalanced as hostage. And it's tons of fun. Making Bomb the only gamemode would kinda kill ranked for me. Why bother competing for a better rank if i don't enjoy the journey? I hope they don't leave other gamemodes in the dust.
---
Dropshot fix took 8 months get used to it boys
---
Make them with renown AND r6 credits. 
---
if you do that you get isolated if the team actually knows what they are doing, good luck w that.  
---
hopefully they'll fix that exploit. also, can't you just shoot the charge? it's on a soft floor and it only needs one shot to be destroyed
---
No, Six Invitational set 
---
I‚Äôm respecting you üòÇ 
---
Wait the challenges aren't out yet right?
---
Flashbangs work similar to normal frag/HE grenades. You have a securitypin which releases the catch of the handle. After releasing said handle, the primer of the grenade will be ignited and detonate after a certain amount of time. So logically you should be able to cook flashes but also not be able to put frags away after cooking them, seeing as you would have release the handle and thus the last security mechanism
---
No you don‚Äôt?  I mean if you just nonstop press it then I guess but you have to not press it for like 1 second instead of button mashing and it resets that cool down
---
This sucks, I tried watching it today and it says not available in my country. Wish they would of given the rights to other streaming services where not available, or at least have the option to buy it. I have a VPN and can access website, but the video never load just the sound.
---
I think ranked should be bomb only and casual should be current ranked, with all three obj types. Hostage should not be in ranked for sure in my opinion.
---
It's probably a test to see the response. So if you want it in ranked, I recommend giving feedback other than whining about it being casual and instead give feedback on the actual gameplay. 
---
That‚Äôs not the point though. The point of this is to donate revenue to the pro league prize pool and help improve pro league. They can‚Äôt do that with renown.
---
&gt;it comes to a point where my call outs or any communication is overshot by the nonsense
---
That's definitely frustrating.  If I'm playing Solo and people do that stuff I just mute them and do my own thing.
---
&gt; Which especially in ranked when communication is needed can be frustrating to stay quiet about.
---
Hmm.  Yeah, I can see why it gets you upset. For one, don't solo queue in ranked.  Ever.  It prevents stuff like this happening.  Two, if it *does* happen, then mute them, because if they're just gonna be talking just to be toxic assholes then there's no point in hearing them, because all they're doing is preventing you from hearing the game, which is *vital*, especially in ranked.
---
There only doing it to test out how it does with the majority of players before they bring it out into the ranked 
---
Its not vigil, its buck
---
Right I do agree that the animation lasts a little too long. I think you should be able to at least hipfire spray while you're knocked out.
---
he‚Äôd be used a fuck tonne if he was 2/2 imo. Best dps in the game and his gadget is pretty solid for clearing out barbed, traps etc and getting the odd lucky kill 
---
Would you prefer that the community just keeps quiet and doesnt raise issues they have with the game? We should just shut up and deal with whatever Ubisoft puts forward, including bad maps and frustrating experiences? If people didnt complain we'd still be playing Bartlett University
---
Well there will be a lot of people who will buy it with r6 credits. It will make the community happy 
---
r/Aimbot
---
Ohh. Well you could contact ubi customer support chat on their website. Still ask for her though. 
---
Just play I guess? I just got it randomly
---
Was so excited to try to earn the new skins, but Loot Boxes.
---
I‚Äôll say the same thing I did in another post about them. They‚Äôre a bit pricey, but the profit also goes towards the Pro League prize pool. Ubi still wants their cut of course, but in this case I‚Äôm more than happy to support the scene. 
---
No it's not on purpose. You have to own the elite skin for it to work. So it should work for ash, doc and pulse. 
---
Xbox North America only my bad
---
Because it costs money to make things. And they need money to support pro league, which is what the packs are for. 
---
I do however wish you could pick them if you were buying them (but not the free ones). I just bought the doc elite and then bough 4 packs and got the doc uniform. 
---
The elite skin is way better IMO
---
I haven't played R6 since the zombie mode so 
---
he's Canadian. it's in his nature to attract pucks
---
It just really rubs me the wrong way how much money you need to spend. I don't mind supporting the pro scene but these prices are rather insane
---
In game. I still have Kaid and Nomad, prolly a bug. 
---
No we don't 
---
I think Clash is one of the few operators whose operator model looks better than the operator card art
---
"I doubt your experience because it doesn't match mine" isn't really all that constructive. 
---
Totally agree, thats also why I almost never play casual. The other day I decided to jump in a casual while I waited for squad to finish a ranked, got tk'ed right as the round started, my first time playing casual in like two months and remembered why.   
---
My strategy is to ensure I am at least Gold 3 off the bat and solo queue ranked in gold 3-1 matches. Low toxicity, people actually trying to win and not as many MnK players as plat. Sweet spot imo so I still solo queue. Would be so awesome to have some kind of trusted admin system so normal players had the power to kick or ban players for unprovoked team killing. 
---
Hostage can go, but secure area? No thanks. The only gamemode i can both have fun and feel a bit of balance(Basically a middle ground).
---
OP what phrase??!!?
---
This is exactly how Ranked should be!!! 
---
Lion is good but I love finka 
---
*Nothing personal, kid.*
---
No. This is prolly a bug. 
---
Ye your defenitly right the prices need some tweaking I mean the outbreak collection was over $100 and that was with the season pass. The only ones I feel weren‚Äôt that bad were the summer ones since there were only like 10 but even the Halloween and this collection are like $60
---
But what about m870?
---
Thats dope
---
Relationship doesn't necessarily mean love or something like that. Actually i kinda like your idea though.
---
Wow this is actually really deep. 
---
I got it on my free pack
---
A solution to this would be providing options to choose which mode players want after they select ranked in the menu, instead of hiding it in option.
---
No... but it probably should have (Atleast lion should have been banned)
---
They only play best of 1‚Äôs during play days and best of 3‚Äôs at lan. Trying to play multiple games of that a night would be super draining and you‚Äôd have to make sure you have at least an hour to play. Plus considering it is ranked then there is a very good you could have someone quit super early and not come back. You could be stuck with really bad teammates. 
---
Smoke is a bully lol

Place it on a wall, put a hook on the end and use it as a keyhanger
---
üòÇüòÇgood to see that quote is still used
---
Nice, I was playing on Oregon the other day when I got an impact kill with Zofia aswell.
---
God clash still looks like a fucking retard, who runs the art department.
---
30 drones or 30 kills?
---
A big bully lol
---
I'm a solid pure shit 4
---
What is 6th pick exactly?
---
You mean od, right?
---
They don't track real time. Wait for some time, or restart uplay. 
---
I would like the ban phase to be in a separate game mode/preference please ubi :)
---
But is it "Useful" tho... I feel like I'm a bit of a better player after seeing this now.
---
Will playing this affect our match making rank? 
---
100years
---
I just don‚Äôt think secure area or hostage should have a ranked mode. Someone grinding out diamond in bomb is insanely more impressive than someone doing it in the other modes. Games do fine with extra uncompetitive modes. 
---
It will not be, no.
---
I can hear "YOU FUCKING MUPPET"
---
Don't be an asshole
---
Very simple without making it look like shit
---
#*ahem*, minimalist wallpaper guy
---
We're brothers. We play in the same house on opposite sides of a wall...
---
Go get that ace. 
---
decent 
---
Dude Maverick has no fucking chill.
---
What do you mean, you can just hold the jammer while you are trying to place it
---
kiX laughing? what?
---
Oh boy yeah
---
To combat this, if a teammate leaves within the 1st-2nd rounds, cancel the match. Being stuck with a bad teammate is inevitable, I only 5stack to avoid this.
---
Rainbow Six Invitationals themed start screen we got short time ago
---
I hate that fact that you play defense multiple times before you play attack. If that‚Äôs how ranked will be next season I‚Äôm dropping this game.
---
I got it in my 1st free pack
---
Ubi actually released this!? That's amazingly bad
---
If you can't see it how come OP has a picture of it?
---
Well they made the right choice
---
sorry the others were square and i got requests to make an iphone wallpaper one
---
There should be a pro league rules que, because I actually enjoy ranked rules as they are, but would enjoy pro league rules as well, so having both would be ideal
---
Well if 25 packs is 100%, then 1 pack is 4% so 20/25 is 80% chance of getting the thing you want
---
You could still have 12 rounds after that where they could leave and not come back
---
I don't get this feeling. Do people really prefer to play 3 rounds on the same side? Especially with 4 rounds necessary to win and many maps favoring one side? Feels like it would be unfair. It works in pro league because they have a set schedule with a fixed number of matches on both sides so it balances out, and also map bans so they have a bit of control over where they play which side. In ranked none of that is guaranteed. You may play blue team 60% of the time which means 60% starting on attack and they could mostly be defense sided maps. It's not nearly as controlled. 
---
Plus wouldn't 3 rounds on the same side just start to feel repetitive? 
---
Is it just to "play like the pros do?" 
---
[r/uNeXPeCTeDthANoS](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5921194/10-fun-ways-to-euthanize-yourself/amp)

that‚Äôs.. morbid. 
---
I‚Äôm probably potato 3.
---
Not FOV. Tested it from 60 to 90 FOV and even tried different aspect ratios. Same shit every time
---
Yeah but ive seen stuff like how tachanka loves one of the female ops and yeah id like more storys or lore if you would.
---
So plus the three I get I basically have like an 8% chance of not getting either?
---
Buying the game, the season pass and cosmetics
---
Oh okay, well the sale is for Europe too, but I don't have an xbox.
---
I should have mentioned I'm on PC.
---
Most people see her with Thermite.
---
This is true
---
Didn't forget, it's just not there. I wanted to get this up in a reasonable amount of time. It's still the same issue, you can see by the way the shields move.
---
Then make it severely punishing for abandoning a ranked match. There's no way to completely stop people abandoning matches.
---
Does anyone know how u view the new challenges to get the new packs plz
---
love the event mode. Much more competitive than beta ranked
---
Hello C_J_K_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajrs5h/thinks_i_seen_tbis_before/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I believe it‚Äôs $30 for all of them, but I‚Äôm 100% sure
---
tfw a post has 666 upvotes and you change it to 667
---
I am sorry if you understand that, problem is not player base ping or players with good connection/bad is netcode from Ubisoft as not looking for lean spam crouch or your problem. 
---
They do not fix shit for player base, just for pros and tournament that‚Äôs all.
---
Im pretty sure that's intentional 
---
Yo keep making these! They look awesome!
---
Destroy 30 drones as defender in the new playlist.
---
270 credits each of you have the season pass 
---
we are going to be rolling in renown when we get this üò´üò´
---
Same, which makes it interesting that it's Pulses heart, potential love triangle drama inbound? xD
---
Thank you.
---
It's just like casual now. Spots of people leaving get filled up. 
---
When they released Kaid and Nomad, they talked about how their device has the sphere of effect showing when it's placed, and then they specifically said they were not going to go back and do this for existing operators like Mute/Ela/Yeager. I really wish they'd reconsider, it would be very useful for knowing the limit of your gadgets.
---
I bought them and  am enjoying the game way more now! Highly recommended! 
---
There has been for quite some time though. I do agree that the lack of kill cam makes it more competitive, but if you read what I said, it could cause a lot of issues with people exploiting things this next season
---
Limited time. Every weekend for four weekends.
---
But it is probably a test run. If the community receives it well, we can hope for a full implementation.
---
poor bandy (;_;)
---
When do they make Ela thiccer ?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm sorry you got tkd but that was funny I didn‚Äôt think you were gonna say I‚Äôm trying to quit haha 
---
please implement this into ranked ASAP. This is the change we NEED to keep the game competitive, healthy, and fresh. Pick ban alone can change so much, thank you for trying this out, ubi.
---
Meh. I didn't like this idea when they announced it for Pro League months ago, and now testing it, I don't like. Siege isn't there yet where bans are needed IMHO. There's just not enough operators yet, and 5 man, and small maps already. 
---
Not a fan. 
---
How the hell do you comb a buzz cut? dumb animation imo
---
Is this what you get in your first pack for everyone?
---
This is SFW, though it would certainly be frowned upon in a workplace.
---
Like always.
---
&gt; There has been for quite some time though.
---
Which doesn't change my statement.
---
&gt;but if you read what I said, it could cause a lot of issues with people exploiting things this next season
---
I did read your post thanks. We need a replay system, not kill cams.
---
This^
---
That‚Äôs really interesting, thanks for the info!
---
It's called a flair, when you visit a subreddit on the right there is edit flair 
---
It be do, it really be do. It do what it do.

The fact is that PC is where all the tests are so making changes based on console decision would hurt PC players game play as they have a lot less restrictions. When UBI make an OP they want to see what it looks like in Pro League as that is where the money is so they get the best to test it, It's much easier to see where the operators are at on pc then fix them on the test server
---
Thought I recognized the voice but I couldn't tell from the "face cam".
---
not to flex but emerald 1
---
It's technically a glitch
---
[deleted]
---
That would be perfectly acceptable to have a replay system
---
Can you upload a screenshot on a different weapon pretty please?
---
I don't think he's angry at all?
---
No you can get it but you don't have a big chance
---
Why...
---
It‚Äôs bigger than her win rate
---
I only solo queue as well and I hardly play ranked bc I don‚Äôt have anyone to squad up w. I‚Äôm gold three rn but I don‚Äôt think ima play until I find people for this reason. 
---
Thicc guys save lives*
---
What? You didn't even hit him. You shot the pole and then claimed he ducked under your shot. Simply untrue, sir. Untrue.
---
I legitimately laughed at that and ppl just looked at me like something was wrong
---
I kinda feel like there should be voice chat records. It would help out SO much. Honestly because of that, that's probably why I never see anything done about the people I deal with.
---
I love how Clash looks here, I don‚Äôt know why, but I do 
---
I need one with Frost please!
---
Also kaid can't counter a thermite charge in time because of the delay on his gadget
---
Im not sure, maybe they will refund r6 credits but that unlikely. What is more likely is a little renown.
---
Lol why would I be mad at banning ash or caveira? What do they provide to team?           
---
Tell me do you ban kapkan as well?
---
Money and R6 Credits? You have to be FUCKING kidding me.
---
That‚Äôs pretty bad, I‚Äôve never had something like that I feel for you. Even if I was the jackal and you walked in front of me I would‚Äôve hopped on the mic and apologized Lol at least you won tho 
---
I don't see how that would be OP. 
---
1.)Claymores are a secondary gadget so you can't take breaching charges with it
---
2.)Unlike breaching charges they would only open a small crawlspace in soft walls, if an operator wanted to traverse said hole they would leave themselves extremely vulnerable
---
3.) you only get 1 of them as opposed to being able to take 3 breaching charges.
---
I'd say what's more infuriating - Ubi being too lazy to redesign them to make some actual use of them. Same with Tachanka.
---
Bandit is the middle battery
---
&gt; I kinda feel like there should be voice chat records.
---
In a perfect world yeah but come on, it's just not realistic.
---
&gt;Honestly because of that, that's probably why I never see anything done about the people I deal with.
---
So record clips yourself and send them to support. You can't complain about nothing being done when you're giving them nothing to go on.
---
Ban operators is so great
---
Did you turn it on and off? JK, check your master volume in game, it may reset 
---
Bandit as an anchor...fantastic buff!
---
thats how casual works
---
Ash Wednesday...you never heard of it? 
---
jesus christ how horrifying 
---
Pc Keys are rectangular and console buttons are round.
---
I honestly kinda want outbreak back tho, just to try it out since it would be something new, no matter how bad it actually was
---
Yes but in Ranked, you're usually playing with randoms and if that 5th operator is unknown, very often do my teammates get interrogated even when I say "we don't know who 5th is, stay with someone".  
---
Point is, just stop making Ranked different from Pro League.  If Casual wants to have different rules to help new players, fine but Ranked should mimic Pro League so we can actually practice for tournaments like the weekly without having to use FaceIt or some other third-party application.
---
almost cried at the end when the screen went black and the song came on
---
It wouldn't replace those tools or harm their place in an operators kit, you would only get 1 and it would allow more flexibility for the gadget.
---
That's nice
---
You‚Äôre a cunt
---
The M870 is a paradox. When I run it on J√§ger or Bandit it feels like total shit, inferior to the fucking Supernova. When I run it on Recruit it feels like gods gift to man
---
Operation health 2.0?
---
Nah I‚Äôm actually pretty decent but this guy and his friend were just toxic inbreds who accused me of doing stuff I never did lol 
---
I agree ranked should mimic pro league 
---
It's entirely superfluous though. You have breaching tools.
---
Depends if you have the season pass though.
---
They took the most ugly operator already in the game and somehow made her look worse. I am amazed. 
---
Mostly everything on pro league rules is great, I think!
---
I‚Äôm a fan of picking sites and spawn locations. And rotating attack/defense after half match.
---
Yeah I know it happens all the time but this particular time tilted me lol 
---
this seems more appropriate for a comment discussion, not an entire post. other than that, i have literally no input on this. 
---
Love the screen.
---
Love the new mode. Make it new Ranked plz.
---
Rust 3, oof!
---
Unfortunately no, I wish I could ban his account and his friends for a while for toxicity but that won‚Äôt happen smh 
---
Bandits got better guns and nitro so hmph
---
Dirt 4 with a patch of grass
---
It's played when you start up the game for the first time, if I remember right 
---
Ranked should try and copy Pro League as much as it possibly can in order for this game to be taken seriously
---
Even for a short-lived mode, we need to minimize the ways of possible toxicity
---
Dude I plan on it once I REALLY have time to sit down and collect those recordings. And once I have shit setup to do so. For now, bringing some attention to it in this form doesn't hurt anyone.
---
only if you buy it for your main account. buying season three for your smurf account won't magically give it to your main. 
---
I didn't claim I would've killed him lul. If I wanted to hide that I wouldn't have put the slowed down segment

You get 5 for free right? The first one off the rip and then 1 every weekend for 4 weeks? I could be wrong

Thaaaaaanks you somuch !!! I looked for here

Yeah a lot more almost every game and they do it just bc 
---
Yes uninstall starter edition first. You have used 1/3 free answers r/fromosky
---
Lol noob I have 98
---
To each their own. Don't really see that it will do very much given as it's already against the rules.
---
Np, I can play later today if you want booby-teeties
---
I thought this was about macros, not missing shots.
---
I would guess it's the ranked mmr system but separate, so everyone starts now at average elo and over time they'll diverge
---
Correct
---
Pls more of this nicely doen
---
honestly, all of the game's original lore fell away once the dlc really became a thing. yes, there was that university map, but for the most part the white masks just kinda disappeared, partly because (i assume) that there really isn't any story mode. too bad. 
---
Bit of both.
---
yes
---
Chicken shit 21 
---
Functionality we already have in spades ie superfluous
---
Hahaha how is that a fact? We know how strong they are? Is that a stat? Clash is ripped as fuck. 
---
They're seeing if it's popular enough to have it's own playlist.
---
A lot of people have requested it, now Ubi is seeing if it makes monitary sense  
---
You're probably not wrong, but I figured I'd do what I CAN as of right now for it.

Is this limited time?
---
It says shooting range with 3 letters?
---
i think it would make sense Bandit is picked more than Kaid, not every player has Kaid.. unless the data you speak of is only players with both operators?

Fix screenshots plz

I guess this won't work with the reddit is fun app... damn

That's not what is bothering me it's your renown how do you have so much
---
but the remote claymore you've described can literally be replicated by a breaching charge - similar damage and a technically lower profile. i don't really see the point. 
---
Must be from all that crouch-spamming she's been doing lately. Really good for the glutes.
---
I think the new cosmetics might be bugged. I got the dokkaebi headgear but after playing a game i was also wearing the uniform on the endscreen.
---
it was the produce of a free period at school, i suppose he had limited time/resources. would have been a cool extra feature, i agree
---
I just checked, it's at max.
---
where did you lose your r6 credits? how would buying more things solve this? enlighten me. 
---
Cmon bro i aint got time i use reddit ocassionally and on my phone only
---
Watching a shield get outsmarted gives me real joy!
---
6 charms... If I bought 4 packs and got 4 charms out of it I would be really mad
---
I thought it was a fifa back ground... 
---
The added functionality wouldn't eliminate the claymore's potential for area denial, it would still be perfectly functional if an operator decided not to use the remote trigger.
---
Hearing the things people say to my little sister (who is 13) is really annoying. People asking ‚Äúare you a girl‚Äù like its the next best question asked before ‚Äúwhat happens after we die‚Äù groups of 4 would shoot her down to low health or just kill her because shes a girl. Harassing her and telling her shes a ‚Äúdirty slut‚Äù or an ‚Äúugly bitch‚Äù i tell her when stuff like this happens she presses the menu button and she should go down to the little ‚Äúleave to menu‚Äù option. Press x twice and your good

M870&gt;Weird Slug Sniper thing

I mean, it is an important buff, but super situational. Does pengu ever stop complaining though? Every time I see someone post a clip of him, that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs doing. 
---
lol you don't get anything back
---
I love the gamemode please bring pick and ban to ranked&amp;casual I don't think I can play without now
---
Now you're arguing against things I've not mentioned.
---
I honestly don't like both of her guns, one feels awkward to use and the other doesn't have enough bullets for me.
---
Some people would do anything for the slightest competitive advantage!
---
This is absolutely gorgeous
---
Prolly cause he‚Äôs a base game operator and Kaid is 25k
---
To be fair Interro has nothing to do with Ubisoft, he works for ESL, he most likely doesn't know shit about Ubi's intentions afar from a few tidbits he might get from personal friends.
---
That's a mom bum if I ever saw one...
---
No I meant there used to be a way to put 1 shot of pellets on a reinforced walls and be able to climb in it.  It no longer works 
---
happens with every remotely competitive game my dude. i do have to admit, siege has a lot more broken to exploit tho lmao
---
We just need more time!
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear that I made you laugh
---
You're kidding, right? Do you not have eye balls? Maestro is massive compared to clash. It's like saying, "how do you know Brock lesnar wouldn't break Conor macgregors arm?"
---
So if anything they would be PC Fascists!
---
Even if u get 61 fps in game a 144hz is 10000% worth it. Make sure its a 1ms refresh rate.
---
I want badly pulse uniform, mira and thacher headgear
---
I agree 
---
Someone explain why Bandit is sad. I understand Maverick made the words, but I don't understand because I think Bandit is better
---
Wonder if that's a family member or savta.
---
First idk know why you are replying if clash is not ur main and clash is way to easy to counter 
---
Yes this has been happening since forever but this douchebag still thought it was warranted bc he swears he got the kill and after I showed him I got it he just says ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù lol it‚Äôs crazy. And if you think about it‚Äôs impossible to win a 1v5 if the team is actually communicating and pushes you at different angles at the same time. The only reason people get aces is bc the enemy team made enough mistakes for you to win, so if it‚Äôs a good team you‚Äôre up against you shouldn‚Äôt be votekick s for not winning that lol and yeah I need people to play with bc it‚Äôs just terribly bad now unfortunately 
---
You're wrong. Quite a useful ability.
---
Thats cool
---
I feel for you guys that sucks 
---
Is it possible get some with renown?
---
Heretic
---
man if you need your thicc fix then just play rook 
---
6th pick in ranked would lead to a lot of fights over who gets to use it and how. Probably TKs and what not, we all know the average IQ or a triggered Ash main.
---
Nice
---
Check your volume mixer in Windows. It may be turned down, happens to me sometimes. Just right click on the speaker icon in the bottom right corner and select volume mixer.
---
its lava skin,u get it if u bought the new season pass
---
As soon as you can play ranked, switch over from casual. You‚Äôll need to learn the maps to really get good, and it takes so much longer to do that on casual. Casual has a much larger map pool, full of unbalanced or not fun maps, you don‚Äôt get to see your spawn or what objective you‚Äôre defending ahead of time, plus it‚Äôs full of people meming and tking. 
---
Yes, you will get 300R6 credits back per extra pack.
---
Let's not kaid ourselves FTFY 
---
Get anything good??
---
Yeah I know just this time got me really mad lol 
---
hell yea it is
---
I really hope the gamemode ends up sticking around in some way it's much better than current casual imo. I'd like it in ranked as well but personally I'd like points to be disabled reveal phase and six pick for ranked only and maybe the current mode as is for casual. 
---
Yes!!! Thank you, been waiting so long for this.
---
Nono, the long protrusion needs to still be there, then it will be perfect 
---
Even though I wanted to tk back it was all I could think about the whole game and it threw my game off bc of it lol 
---
bandit tricking &gt; hatches
---
Guns are good i agree but the ability isnt good enough because drones get an effect when they are near him making it honestly pointless since you still get to know what room the vigil is in
---
This is pure gold
---
Vigil needs a buff? Oh god no he doesn't he's already a good string operator, One operator who needs a change is Frost although you can argue she's balanced. 
---
\(^-^)/ hugs for Bandit
---
I would say you are not man enough to say this in front of me. I will be at the six invitationals in Montreal feel free to remind me who you are when we meet. Shits like you are the reason no one is posting any cosplay content on reddit. Thank you.
---
Still, you done an awesome job!
---
Then don‚Äôt buy them. Ubi makes this amazing event and you‚Äôre mad they want to make money off of it.
---
Whatever. Your loss
---
yes. but that's how much chimera and the halloween packs cost...I wish I could just buy the damn universal skin without spending $50
---
Kaid is just something else now. Rather play bandit
---
yes.
---
Take the current ranked rules and turn it into the new casual. Take pro league rules, minus the amount of rounds personally, and make it the new ranked. I think that‚Äôs pretty simple. 
---
&gt;making it honestly pointless since you still get to know what room the vigil is in
---
Nope, you can tell a rough area. Sometimes not even which floor.
---
Go look at their bios. Maestro - 6'1" 191lbs. Clash - 5'10" 160lbs. 
---
Yes but with 6th pick you never know which operators were really chosen, you're always left in doubt. And the 6th pick is usually used to throw off the enemy team, for example choose a Pulse and the enemy might not be prepared to be C4'd form below. Choose a Valk and the enemy won't know they're being watched and might not look for cameras. It works on offence by making it look you're doing a set strat but say choose a Monty or Glaz as a 6th pick and the enemy won't prepared
---
What is crouch peeking?
---
The new playlist is a ton of fun, would love to see it as the new ranked. Makes a lot of sense to me for the ranked playlist to be the same format the pros play. 
---
There out?
---
Sounds op as hell, but a cool idea none the less.
---
There has to be some reason why companies are scared to pull the ban trigger when their games are being modified. Is it because their customer support gets flooded with salty cheaters claiming they didn't cheat?
---
Leon ur fat

haha get fricked

But I cannot see him and he can see me. I don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs there and I can‚Äôt shoot back because of it.

\-I have enough vram

I‚Äôve been drawing UwU in the wall
---
Maybe if there was a shittyshittyshittyr6?
---
Ash is 100% a wasted ban
---
They‚Äôre working on it chill.
---
I mean, technically, Kaid is the old one.
---
Oh God did you get smoke peeked? 
---
Actually OP said different operators when he said about console stats. They're gonna be different so operators would be modified differently. Fuck tard
---
Just tried out this game mode and I already decided I'm not going to play it again.  I know people say to give it time, but when they're touting that you can "play like the pros" when it's only half of what the pros have, I don't want to play it.    
---
  
---
I thought it was going to be 6 on attack, 6 on defense (with overtime or not, I don't care), with a ban phase, 6th pick phase, and the proper map pool.  But it's this weird mashup of that with ranked rules.  Make the mode be EXACTLY what the Pros have.  It makes no sense when literally every other game has a ranked mode and it's the same as the mode their pros play.   
---
Don't have the current ranked.  
---
Don't have this weird mashup you created.  
---
Make it exactly the same as Pro League.  There's 0 reason for it not to be.  
---
It's a bad idea to have this as a seaprate game mode.
---
Ranked queues already cross 5 miniutes, and only interested players will play the pro mode, where queue times will be worse.
---
Plus, honestly, given the pathetic state of ranked now, how is it that you don't see this as a welcome change?
---
Oh no I totally agree it‚Äôs stupid but at least you had a chance, unlike when the door is wide open for them but intact for you. Yuh know 
---
Ubiquitous soft are too soft on the players for leaving. Bans are not bad enough and not frequent enough.
---
I would love if they kept this mode on because sometimes playing ranked.....is a pain and causal, well is casual
---
It's nice to have a pro feeling play style that isnt as sweaty and comp and feels casual.
---
You are going to get a very bias answers from us. I would say get it, the game is a lot of fun. But like pubg there is many bugs so sometimes bullshit things will happen. If you are ok with that I would say get it.
---
I get that and i probably will buy them it just seems a little steep. I wouldnt care as much if i could just buy wjat i want. But having rng decide what i get isnt appealing
---
Well, let's hope they consider it
---
this is what ranked will be. it might not be in casual 
---
my friend too. I just want Ash skin

Yeah and hibana too we Want Thicc hibana waaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I play with drunk friends 9/10 so this is refreshing to say the least. Plus we can pick where we spawn, and have extra rounds just like ranked without the placement. 
---
Yes
---
I downvoted you one time to get your to 67 upvotes so everything can match üòÇ 
---
It isnt really a casual coz it work on a ranked game match system
---
You‚Äôll likely get 300 credits back if it‚Äôs anything like the Halloween event, which it almost guaranteed is.
---
I‚Äôve been saying this should be in ranked I‚Äôm glad others agree 
---
Pro League map pool while good is also limited. I prefer the ranked map pool over the PL pool, especially for ranked.
---
Last event the packs were bugged, I tried to ask in this forum if they wer ebugged but auto mod deleted my post
---
But not everyone play as a team even in ranked
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt speak Canadian 
---
Fuck yeah i love alpha packs 
---
Re
---
honestly the best way is to just watch PL and pay attention to how they set up sites. u/Kaosx also has a youtube channel where he breaks down maps and meta ways to set them up.  you can also watch VOD reviews from Supr(former pro for Rogue and Era), Meepey(pro for Team Secret), and Gotcha(Coach for EG) they have a lot of good insight on the meta and overall good analysis for the scene.
---
Yeah.
---
I'd like it if they mirrored ranked and pro league (with minor adjustments) and keep this mode as casual.
---
It's about damn f**king time casual lost that extra minute.
---
On xbox, she\`s insta-ban with Blitz, and i like it :D
---
Nope, not in its current form I don't.  
---
I want Pro League style settings exactly.  This mode is a weird mash of that and ranked.    
---
I'd rather play R6TMs.  
---
25 max for all the items no dupes. And yes you can buy them. 
---
You are literally stupid, look it up for yourself. Pc has less Rainbow Six Siege copies of the game sold than consoles combined. Also, anyone can make unlimited smurfs using a new email so smurfs don‚Äôt inflate the numbers of copies sold moron.
---
so what. it‚Äôs a good addition to the game whether you‚Äôre in a squad or not. try communicating with your team

But still you need a team otherwise it‚Äôs just chaos

He said balance them differently, not make them different, asshat.

Got it at my third pack
---
I did a bad. 
---
That still doesn't stop the desync between clients, which is the whole point in making debris server-side.
---
Yes you can for r6 credits
---
That's why I proposed that it take 2-3 seconds after an operator puts the detonator before the claymore's laser re-arms.
---
No, not necessarily.
---
Hostage is a sh*tshow where you use the objective as a meat shield, and secure has the biggest waste of time called "contesting after the timer has gone 0". These  2 are the reasons why secure and hostage are utter bullshit and garbage and trash and nonsense and a waste of time and life.
---
The only way those would be played would be if they rework it, which they said they won't because they want bomb to be the future of siege because it is inherently more competitive and versatile..which is good. Trash game modes shouldn't last long in a game aiming to last a decade.
---
Well if we can survive the pubg bugs this cant be too bad, Is the gunplay similar? 
---
Prob cause the ROI isn't high enough in their eyes. They'd be wrong of course because people will stop playing in mass if this issue (among many others) is not fixed. They don't think it hurts their profit margin, and it prob hasn't really yet, but people will stop playing at some point. This game could live for another 5 years easily, or it will die in the next couple because they are either A. Incapable of fixing this shit B. Don't care C. Don't realize how big the issues are. I think it's cause they think rainbow has no real competition and they can get away with doing nothing

It took Ubi 3 years to add text and voice mute buttons to the scoreboard. Ubi take extraordinarily long to do even the simplest of things.

Yeah I mean it's not a ranked match, but I joining to matches that they leave

Yes, I got a cool skin for the Mossberg shottie
---
I was playing a ranked game and got booted by servers second round of the game. I then reconnecting within 10 seconds and played for four more rounds until we lost the game. I got this at the end of the game for apparent inactivity. Thanks Ubisoft?
---
WAKANDA FOREVAH
---
No official information yet but Ubi has hinted that they want to implement pick and ban in ranked.
---
it‚Äôs posted once every 5 minutes and it‚Äôs against the sub rules now. try reading sometime 
---
2 isn't 3 try a different map :D I believe in you.
---
But how much slower are we talking about? All you need to do is 1-3 crouches during a volley. You don't need a macro that spams 50 crouches per second. Wouldn't it make more sense to give aiming penalty based on this kind of movement? More spam = less accuracy.
---
There is also the case of not having to lose anything if you do leave unlike ranked where you will lose extra elo
---
I got a message say that the package is expired 
---
Gotcha I'll do that if I ever wonder what's going on
---
Operator banning?
---
Which is why it won't be in casual. Nobody said casual is where it is going to be added.
---
I'm thoroughly surprised people are missing the simple fact that this new one is for **TESTING OUT HOW PICK AND BAN WOULD WORK IN MATCHMAKING IN THE COMMUNITY**, NOT to add it to casual.
---
The test server or actual?
---
You get 3 attacker and 3 defenders...if someone chooses all 3 of your attackers or defenders guess what you get to choose...no, really guess...
---
Plastic 2
---
Another one to add to the list of things they pretended to fix, along with the new servers that they conveniently and quietly forgot about.
---
I think they fixed this around the same time they fixed the lighting, right?
---
It may appear I'm on my high horse... That's only due to fact you can't accept you're the problem though.
---
Nah
---
woosh
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I said if you play against the same one bam ash.
---
Don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll understand in a couple of years when you start learning to fill the truck‚Äôs ass.

Exactly. That‚Äôs why I hate the ‚Äújust do it back‚Äù crowd. I don‚Äôt want to hook up a mouse and key board to my console and I don‚Äôt want to spam random ass buttons just to crab walk around the map like some sort of spaz.

I think it would great if they added it to one of the weekends so we can try it out

Oh yeah looks like we do need trash people that insist on insulting others. Learn to take a break man

That's okay, the maps that were left out have their upsides too.

Or, y'know, sometimes people just have different opinions. But I guess that clearly means I suck, right?

Got falsely banned for hacking can‚Äôt, just too good

Killcams is a fair one, but at the same time I feel like there's some good reasons to keep it in.

And why not?
---
That‚Äôs my plan, this playlist is great.

You can really tell all the time and effort they poured into the game. They truly love their player base
---
Thats exactly my problem. I dont mind spending money on the game because believe me i have spent a lot but the money i have spent i knew what i was getting and not some ramdom item i dont want

My poor boye ;-; I have like 2 days of play time on him, I'll love him if no one else will.

I don't get it

Actually ended buying 8 moreüòÇ got the universal skin, full ash, doc, and pulse skins
---
Way to stick to your plan man. That's cool and collected.
---
Oh and dokkebai
---
Well LoL isn't siege and sure isn't LoL.
---
And you don't need 5 stacks for pick and ban. That's a myth. All you need is just text chat or mic.
---
Probably around 100
---
Well it's based off casual MMR so how is it much different?
---
Gimme that L O R E 
---
He can it's just an extremely small time window

It will help encourage it. Start typing on the keyboard or get on your mic and help coordinate. 
---
Your CPU is actually the bottleneck, there‚Äôs really no fix... what happens is that your GPU is producing *too* many frames... and your CPU can‚Äôt keep up... 
---
3 tricks‚Äî
---
1. Turn of discord overlay
---
2. Use a frame rate limiter (I know you stated you did that)
---
3. Turn *up* your graphics settings... I know that this sounds counter intuitive but it will make it so your CPU can handle the frames (since your GPU will be putting out less frames)

---
Your a jager main, you should comfort your brother 
---
Ah i see you
---
My bad, didn't read it properly. That's another reason to bring back the rematch feature! 
---
Would you say that makes a big difference? Pushing to the 144hz? For example I run the game at ~100 atm as high as 120s with beautiful settings. Would lowering the setting to hit the 144 be worth or leaving it as is fine?
---
Ironic because Kaid is older than bandit
---
Um... It's in the title... I met a girl during terrorist hunt....then I took her on some dates in game... The too pic is theme park. She died trying to come back inside...and bottom is a romantic getaway.
---
That should be an inbuilt matchmaking sorting system INSIDE the game modes, which should work in casual as well.
---
Assuming that pick and ban is for stacks only is a huge misconception. All you need is a mic or text chat. Pick and ban will allow teams to get closer and coordinate better, and ban idiots like BB, lion (rework coming soon), and blitz if somebody has a problem with him. And allows strats to be shuffled.
---
I, and countless others see that as betterment for the future of the game.
---
Same way I feel about these cartoons
---
And not lion?
---
I know that but if it is standard price why am i not allowed to buy them seperately, why am i forced to gamble and hope i get the item i want
---
Can we please get the Picture with the hammer from the announcement.
---
He's a close second
---
Yea I def can but I like having a beautiful game so I keep some setting high even though I don't need to haha. Thank
---
That will be very cool!
---
I'm atom 4
---
How do you get this because i got none
---
And what is this
---
Thoroughly surprised.
---
(Personally, I'd ban him and ying straight up)
---
Okay thanks for the tip! And gosh I'm excited now because I feel my tracking is down pat but flicking needs some work. Always feels off
---
Yeah the hat looks like it's not even on, just laid on top of her head.
---
A lot of people are speculating that this a test and will probably be the new ranked system next season 
---
Pros.
---
This clip ended early... You died didn't you
---
Honestly, he's a pain on console. I'm not surprised at all about him being banned that quickly. 
---
The time has come for you to find a new path, brother.
---
please tell me this is sarcasm 
---
Maestro's upper arm is bigger than Clash's head.
---
He‚Äôs banned because he is a broken operator and no one likes playing against blitz
---
:(
---
Unfortunately for pretty every single game out there on all platforms, Console near always outsells PC. Thats why games such as Call of Duty host their pro league on Console. 
---
Looking at Ubisoft as a whole for the last few years, about 42% of their total sales are on PS4, 25% on XBox, and 18% on PC - note thats Ubisoft in total, PC is no where near console. 
---

---
Reason i post that first is because PS4 and Xbox rarely ever reveal player numbers (partly because it'd make one or the other look bad). PS4 was leaked recently at over 15 million Siege players - which given we are at about 35 million total maybe now (30 million was in April 2018), its a significant amount. 
---
https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/4067/sony-leaks-way-to-find-out-total-player-count-for-all-games

Probably so. I'm not on console, so I'll stay out of this.

Thank you, devs, for this brilliance!

still don‚Äôt get it

Happened to me in a terrorist hunt. I was Monty and a terrorist butted me through a barricaded window and my shield for the kill. Smh.

Just glad the old background is gone

He is banned because he is a broken operator and no one likes playing against him

Thanks for the tips. I have resolution scaling at 100 n sharpness at 100 right now. Would it be better to change the render scale to 65/70 or just drop my resolution from 1980x1080 to 1600x900? Also is the jump from 100 fps to 144 fps really worth the quality loss? I really like how this game looks wouldn't wanna lose out on that
---
There's no joke. I don't get why you don't get it. I can't take her I'ma  date IRL because she lives on the other side of the country.
---
Yeah, let's make this ranked. 
---
Nope, just my opinion
---
Awsome thanks!
---
Pata bellum I was majority solo queing, grim sky was a mix of both &amp; this season I've been running with a few regulars and people from the lfg on Xbox. But yeah solo que  is damn crazy.
---
And your recoil sucks ass
---
Choose bomb only then? You don't have to play other gamemodesm
---
Bandit was born in 1974. He isn't old. Kaid is old as fossils!
---
Yeah maybe, but Bandit has a better roaming kit, and I tend to see more rompers than anchors, and he‚Äôs cheaper. So definitely that.
---
I hope this is a joke, if not, then you don't know siege.
---
My mistake

Lmaoo I would've been salty

There is a jukebox on that map that I think is playing the music you are talking about. It's only _sometimes_ cause people will shoot the speakers/jukeboxes to shut them up so they can hear enemies coming. You could launch a private room and go stand near it and see if you can play the music into something that could help ID it?

In the new gamemode, Mira, Ash, Doki, Pulse, Thatcher, and Doc all come equipped automatically with their new uniforms.
---
That's all of siege for ya lol especially with all the smurfing 
---
Only not good if you don‚Äôt know how to use him
---
She is ez to play against, unless they‚Äôre a good Clash who knows how to play her. Also how is my statement invalid just cuz I‚Äôm not a Clash main?
---
I l√§√üt played about 8 hours ago, so idk
---
the kind that‚Äôs posted here once every 5 minutes 
---
I saw this on ash...
---
I hope they finally separate the elite animations from the elite uniforms if you own the set.
---
I know it would make me buy more elites. Some elites i love the animation, but not the uniform, like jager, and others the other way around.
---
Yeah i am dude lol
---
Why does the renown suck so much 
---
Dont be upset its rng my first 2 packs were ass
---
Why angled? Don't you want as many shots going through the tiny hole as possible?
---
This is the hardest I have laughed in awhile!
---
Dream on XD
---
From the new packs 
---
are you trolling rn? bullets go through drywall like a priest and altar boy. headshots are one shots and sound can be used to hit people through walls. and the shield dude is blitz.
---
Can ads quicc to get them shots off
---
*Look.* I'm not in the mood for an argument with someone I've never met. Why don't we just agree to disagree?
---
The whole point is that the maps are fair though.  Last thing I want to do is play Theme Park 4 times in a row again.  At least this way, I'm not losing maps because I got defense - I'm losing maps cause I'm BAD.
---
No kill cam for the game mode. I don‚Äôt like it either 
---
Doesn't change anything about wanting to save them up.
---
r/wooosh
---
Oof
---
I think it should be a permanent third queue option
---
Does injured 20 mean only 20 health is gained from a revive?
---
Just had luck in solo que I take it?
---
i will not agree to disagree because you‚Äôre straight up wrong 
---
I see a lot of "bring this to RANKED!" well I don't want the pick and ban system mode in ranked.  I enjoy it more as an event. Here's my opinion as to why + extra sauce: 
---
\-Bomb 24/7 and defending/attacking for a set amount of rounds. It isn't a fun time. OKay Cool for pro league players. That's their sport/job it's fine that bomb is the only mode dubbed balanced for them that they play. See (1) for more on this before you say anything to me . 
---
I want  competitive gameplay with a variety. So IMO this doesn't work out. Not for the layout of the maps. Not with a pick/ban system.  If we are talking ranked how would you *not* see this as unbalanced?? I'd much rather see realistic mode isn't a thing.  As a defender it's more easier to hold an obj than to attack let alone plan one.  Everyone that only plays bomb are probably the vets of COD who only played S&amp;D where there was no team switch after each round. (Full disclosure i'm a vet from MW/W@W era I don't like bomb as much nor favored any mode in particular)  
---
\-Pick/Ban: **I understand that not every operator is used** but the freedom of choice not being limited is what matters. I understand OPs can be protected but It's the availability of ops that matters especially when I play certain ops that'd more than likely be on the ban pick list--No i don't wanna have to go to casual to play certain characters-- Also New ops would more than likely get banned by toxic players at low tier ranks. Also also...Pick/Ban kinda slaps the idea of adapting and TRUE unblocked potential in both attacking/defending in the face.. which I thought was what the theme the game? Creating and setting up #'s of opportunities to eliminate and best your opponents is far better than creating a fixed one.  So avoiding a pick/ ban seems best imo.
---
See (2) for more on this before you say anything to me.  
---
Stuff to think on:  I wouldn't want ALL this is on top of the fact that we have been further limited with content since the beginning. Game launched with little to no cosmetics,buggy broken, and no real challenges.. We see SPEND $$ for a gamble box for cool content. In my mind half the shit that's out now should've been in the game.  Maps included not this rotation.    
---
\-------
---
(1) I wanna draw the line on PRO players and you my fellow non-Pro reading this. All i have to say is I hate when games get directed modified for the sake of PRO play as their main priority. It's not always a bad thing and I understand it drives sales and revenue for the game but there's a fine line that always gets skewed along the longevity of a game with a "competitive mode". I don't want this game being shaped for a single mode as the main focus. Even when it's not it'll always be heavily considered.  I want it equal and what the community wants where there isn't forced changes. So far there's been nothing major.  
---
(2)   "But that's not competitive".yes it is. Damn right NOT having a pick/ban is. Referring back to 1. You're not a pro player leave that scene and play style to them.  By banning you don't have to worry about a certain OP. You can sit and rest easy bc you don't have the skill, team, or right gaming chair to take down 4 speed ash let alone a variety of team combinations.  True competition comes in developing a plan for whatever event not having some false peace of mind bc certain paths/ops/maps have been shut down on you.  It's more satisfying anyways. And Nothing is more satisfying than shutting down an Ash/Blitz rush.   
---
It do be like that sometimes 
---
It would add too much time honestly.
---
no need, just play 20 min with then and you got it
---
That‚Äôs not IQ
---
They are still a cunt either way.
---
Thats not IQ.. its Ash...
---
IK it is. Pengu's point is that it's not right to test a COMPETITIVE playlist in a casual environment of unfair matchmaking, leavers, etc.
---
I wanted it
---
TIL?
---
Nope, you are literally the only one.
---
the problem  is people think they should be OP but most dont know how to use then
---
The game is based on the bomb game mode, Ubisoft has said that bomb will be the center and focus of siege (originally was supposed to be hostage but that game mode was horribly unbalanced) so every thing that do is with bomb in mind. 
---
If you dislike bomb then you'll either just need to get used to it or move on to other games as Ubisoft has zero plans to deviate from keeping bomb as their flagship game mode
---
Fair, I guess you just gotta hope they don't notice you brining their walls
---
Missing the point entirely. Both are massively popular online 5v5 games, where full 5-stacks are the minority of the player base. Adding a separate 5-stack only mode is going to have similar effects on both games.
---
There was no myth in the first place, nobody is saying you need a 5-stack to play it. We're saying if it was added exclusively for 5-stacks, then it would be fine.
---
ok Im happy to know I got whooooshed
---
One people enjoy the struggle of grinding the ops.
---
You die because you run in like a dumbass bro, it's called being tactical, get used to it
---
That's the point.

---
This is amazing ubi thank you so much.

I'm not super sure but thought Ash's bans come from her small frame and high speed making her a difficult target to hit. Zofia doesn't share that even though her utility is similar. I think?

Lit, I have more time on hibana than any other options she's fun asfff
---
I played this gamemode for some hours now this evening. I really like it, the only thing that disturbs me is the matchmaking. I mean, for serious: Casual matchmaking...this completely destroys my experience
---
I wouldn't say its invalid I just would think that a clash main would know more about clash
---
I hope
---
It creates a new dynamic in each match and causes both teams to come up with a new strategy and approach to objs. The best competitive scenes involve bans like this. You aren't locked out of an op. They're still available in other playlists.

---
Why is this here
---
flair: official
---
Sweet, now what about mouse and keyboard use on console?
---
it‚Äôs really good to hear from you guys on issues affecting the game, and shows that you do listen to the community. keep up the good work
---
No way to just buy the ones I want.
---
Yusssss!
---
Thank you so much! This has become increasingly annoying.
---
YES. I hope people don‚Äôt resort to probe spamming lolll
---
A crouch and lean cool down (similar to CS:GO) would be a good idea.
---
I got a collection pack but every time i try to open it, it says expired
---
Finally ill get to Diamond!
---
This Update will be the best Update after removing the dropshots.
---
knowing Ubisoft, this update will come somewhere in year 7.
---
I thought this was fan made a few hours ago because of how silly it looked. I was surprised when I logged in.
---
q e c q e c
---
Can you address issues with being kicked for no goddamn reason and losing all the renown you wouldve gained? this is really fucking annoying.
---
This fix can‚Äôt come soon enough! Ranked is full of people lean and crouch spamming, some with macros. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 
---
Clash
---
#no further bruv 
---
I've got almost 240 alpha packs hoarded... never open any and spend all my renown on more lol.
---
Remove any movement. Maybe remove sprinting...
---
I think u/ItsEpi mentioned that it uses casual ranks, but I might be mistaken. 
---
Yall will be complaining till you try and crouch and the game doesn‚Äôt let you
---
A lot of monitors are being smashed right now 
---
Thanks. This is amazing news
---
What he said.
---
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING

Good to hear. In all honesty you could have adressed this a little earlier. I think all of us understand this is a complex game and implementing changes takes time. But at least let us know you're working on it.
---
Anyway, good news. 
---
Alright guys, get a head start on this. What‚Äôs the next ‚Äúgame ruining‚Äù thing we‚Äôll whine relentlessly about ‚ÄúUbi not fixing‚Äù?
---
That's great to hear. Thank you for your hard work. Looking forward to a good solution.
---
 The new game mode event and now this. I love you Ubi!
---
He'll Yah scew crouch spammers
---
oh yeah yeah
---
Lucky 
---
Name a more iconic duo
---
The crouching I agree with but I hope the leaning update doesn't effect a good player's ability to be able to flick or lean into a shot.
---
Don't worry, I understood... the second time..
---
thank you 
---
God bless 
---
This. This is all that was needed. SOME COMMUNICATION. We weren't expecting a solution straight away, we just wanted some acknowledgement that Ubi saw this as a problem as well. So thank you for the update, and thank you for looking into this.
---
I hate all the pussies on Reddit who onto complain about people who are better then them and they can‚Äôt be good like them 
---
NICE DROP SHOT KID ü§ß
---
No, you‚Äôre not getting downvoted for having a different opinion. You‚Äôre getting downvoted because you fail to understand the problem people in this thread are trying to address and instead focus on an issue that‚Äôs completely different. Your victim complex is also now a second reason to downvote you.
---
I never knew I could be so erect
---
Ok, THIS is toxic
---
Get_flanked has a video on this, it would probably be helpful.
---
Agreed lean spams whatever but eh I'll take what I can get 
---
Both yes, deal with it. 
---
Please fix before the Invitationals
---
Thats great news.. thank you guys ..
---
Make SIEGE great again. Thanks to the whole Rainbow Six SIEGE team.
---
About time &lt;3
---
Hopefully you guys cant get it sorted before the invi's
---
would REALLY REALLY suck if the biggest siege event is played on this patch :(
---
You can literally avoid bullets by doing this because of hit-scan. Hope it gets dealt with soon.
---
Just return the lean system to how it was before. You couldn't instantly switch between left and right, youd always have to go back to a neutral position first, then hit Q or E again.
---
Plz no
---
YES
---
*drugs... Drugs, drug drug, drug drug drugs....*

Hello shre-dder, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajux90/petition_to_give_clash_the_ability_to_say_the_n/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
*if they dont scan me they cant see me*
---
It's ranked rules xD
---
complete lies regarding 'PL' rules
---
nothing here is from PL except pick n bans
---
And one of the worst animations for an Elite skin.
---
You'd think someone as popular as Ash would get something cool, but I'll definitely take this uniform. 
---
Plus we can mix and match the normal uniforms unlike the Elite ones. 
---
It has been mentioned on the Twitter page that there is a good chance pick and ban will be coming to ranked.
---
Thank you! 
---
Honestly, coming from me, it's a shot in the dark
---
It's meant to be "competitive rules"
---
not an upgraded casual
---
Console mouse and keyboard needs to be looked into also.
---
What in the fuck is dokk wearing lmaoo ? 
---
Except lean spamming breaks the hit boxes. 
---
Honestly having the pro league rules permanently would really help me playing the game better and enjoy it more.
---
It's much easier to plan ahead and have a mental structure of stuff when you can know in advance what you can expect.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Ventilation 
---
That‚Äôs crazy I‚Äôve never had it to that extent but I feel for you bro. This Reddit community is cool but the gaming community is trash and toxic as hell 
---
Its not even that long her mouth just is fukn HUGE
---
Smoke
---
No recoil
---
I was playing smoke though so I can‚Äôt m8 sorry
---
R/wooosh. Community pranked you about lean/ crouch spamming.
---
Can you not take 2 years to actually implement the fix this time around?
---
Maps allowed in pro league... and I think pick/ban as well. Basically proleague playlist. 
---
I just filled out an emailed survey a few hours ago where I pointed out that one thing I thought was lacking from the dev team was good communication.  This is what I want for every problem in Siege.  Maybe you don't have a fix, maybe you don't even have an idea for a fix, but at least you confirm that you are aware of the problem.
---
Honestly even if the dev team came in here and said we know users think it's a problem but we don't see any real reason to fix it right now I would be happier than with nothing.
---
Basically what I'm saying is great job, keep up the great communication and I'm excited for whatever kind of fix you have.
