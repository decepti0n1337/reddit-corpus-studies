I don’t wanna be harsh but why would he want the sub to be personal stories? It just makes no sense.

---
Sometimes you need to put sentimentality aside and just think about it. There are subs for emotional support, but r/r6 isn’t one. This is the sub for gameplay and news. Not... this.

On console (PS4) it’s a choice between toggle and hold. I think the people who are talking about advanced deployment on console are referring to the drone thing where it doesn’t take you into the camera when you throw the drone which was added fairly recently on console.
---
I think toggle is the equivalent to the advanced one as it says you can cancel at any time in its description .

Everytime a new one of these comes out I die a little on the inside; because I know whatever ubi comes up with won’t be anywhere near as awesome as half of these.

didnt they ban like casinos n shit but naked bitches is okay to have? oookkaaayy

Keep it up man, this is sick

So is that technically an ace with only 1 kill?

Dont u realize how tactical it is to rush in and melee everyone

I’ve found the best way to play as Mav is to play in a similar manner to Jackal, start off passive and get increasingly aggressive as the time winds down/as needed. You really want to be sneaky beaky and make a peek hole in the wall you think their back/side will be to, then just one tap and biggity bam. Reposition as needed, being aware of flanks/roamers, using grenades as needed. *Especially if the enemy team likes to run Valk or Echo, they will be on their cams and not aware of your blowtorch.*

If played right you can 3k+ every round on a stupid team.

I don’t know about you but I can spam crouch and move just fine. Also I have no idea how you have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to kill someone crouch spamming at a window? All you have to do is shoot crouch height or anywhere in between for an easy kill, it’s not like crouch spamming mucks the hitboxes up. All it does is change there stance if you can’t hit a player who is change stance so insignificantly then I think that’s a you problem. I don’t crouch spam or lean spam, but I’ve never once felt that I was cheated of a kill or killed unfairly when I’ve died to someone crouch lean spamming.

 **Should** /r/Rainbow6 **talk about negative aspects of the game, like actual gameplay that is all based on crouch and lean spam on high levels and it is fucking atrocious?**

All I see on this subreddit are comics and useless fluff. It used to be a resource for discussions around the game.

The one with the descending MW3 style rope elevator hurt me the most, because that was a next level of sick.

As a flex support player I  disagree, it's hard to drag incompetent ash mains to a win

My question is if anybody else has had this or if anyone knows how to fix it, I tried relaunching the game and that seemed to fix the gunshot loop, but some of the other sounds still weren't there.

I know how they do this and there is absolutely nothing you can do to make them stop. It is on purpose, if you see the blank op icon in top right, that means hes not even in lobby with op chosen. I do not want to tell people how to do this for obvious reasons because it WILL ruin this game if widespread. They can make it so the round will not start for over an hour if they choose. 
---
Yep, thats the exact issue this post states. The last patch botched something and average fps is lower and frame drops hit harder/
---
I cringe at how people think us Aussie’s are even if it is just a meme

The console patch notes came out today. The PC patch notes came out February 5th.

while I appreciate your optimism without many numbers, influence or money I dont think we can. Toxicity is a good example. It basically runs rampant in anything below silver is a mess and there has been virtually nothing done about it. 3 years in and people can be massively toxic, this is why I give up. One person in particular that I constantly run into still has their account proving that they dont care in the slightest as long as the game still rakes in cash.

Holy shit dude that's actually a dope name for an operation, and nice visuals as well!

I would love if you stopped making retarded posts.  Dumbass.
---
Looks pretty damn delicious, nice job!! Very intrigued to know the title of the sheet music you've chosen? 
---
It’s even better when you draw one on OBJ &amp; secure it with the end of the final kill cam being you turning back to see your beautiful artwork.
---
How long will it take people to realize that there are different departments at Ubisoft. Certain people work on fixing mechanics and certain people work on visual bugs. They both are doing different things and aren’t slowing each other down.
---
This is the first time it's happened to me, the only thing close to it was not hearing barricades break when further than ~15m, but nothing as extreme as this. 
---
Yes but it takes absolutely forever in my opinion go with the complete edition

Nice work but I don't want cancer as my wallpaper

That might just be poor aim man.

Sorry :(

Her damage was changed at close range, but it’s still a 2-hit down in most scenarios like before.   She got a buff in turn of damage drop off being reduced over range. Basically you can do more damage at range than before.

Maybe her accuracy/ recoil Nerf has got you tricked up?

---
AUSTRALIANS ARE COMMIMG TO R6 WHOOOOOOOOO WHERE'S LAZARBEAM
---
1. No its a 84 dmg slug shot so you need 2 shots to kill (3 if you're shooting across the map) 
---
2. Do you have any issues on other games or is it only siege?. 
---
Holy fuck, dude! This is so well-made! 
---
Its a 84 dmg gun unless you have the suppressor on which reduces it ot 71. 
---
Which sometimes can be a pain in the ass
---
Not really, I followed Valk to 2nd floor to get the kill because she spawn peeked. I only TK'd on round 3 because I knew they were going to TK me first. That and they all went drone inside OBJ while there were still 3 enemies alive. 
---
Yeah sorry I use the suppressor with it lol
---
Thanks, man! 
---
I meant "X" minutes, as in something balanced. I just threw out a random number that I didn't think was too short to way too long. All I'm saying is that there needs to be a loading time limit in ranked. 3 minutes is probably a sweet spot.
---
In a perfect world, the loading time issue would be fixed, but this is a quick set it and forget it fix that doesn't mean a player could break everyone's lobby *forever*.

Replace the "You realise I have cooldowns too, right?" With "I'm a useless prick that decided to waddle to the other side of the map and either used all of the stims myself or got counterpeeked by Ash 3 seconds into the round"

Damn! I'm jealous. That game is too good.

No, that's what "exclusive" means. Otherwise it would be pointless getting them

"It was said that you would destroy the terrorists, not join them!"
---
how many slugs per shot? it does 70 damage each at any range?
---
Absolutely, the content is already on all of our discs anyway.
---
lit
---
depends on your playstyle, she can be used pretty effectively as a rusher, top breacher, or sitting back picking people off
---
1.) so its one slug per shot
---
2.) only Siege as far as i know. BF4 lag seems at normal levels.
---
A slug is one chunk of metal, ABOUT the size of your thumb
---
A slug is a single projectile.   Think of it as a big bullet in a shotgun shell. Idk the damage drop off
---
I have been having this problem too and it’s only on rainbow. I play on PS4 and my ping is the same as yours and my connection is normally amazing yet this week I have been experiencing this. It’s strange because it’s not happening to my friends and normally they are to ones that lag like crazy but now it’s me. 
---
I was just listening to sabaton so weird

The 0-5 player ended up leaving and me and the other guy got it to a 4-5 loss we did a 2v5 for one of the rounds and won it

---
Somebody hire this man!
---
So sorry for your loss.
---
F. 
---
Ubi never put attachments on their weapons so this is definitely fake
---
Not really justification for this. One lost round is just an extra round to play later on... you didn't really have to throw/to or get on comms and baby rage... people make mistakes, what elo are you in? If this happened in a low rank like gold or something, then there was no point b/c they're still learning the game... if it was plat or diamond, then there's an excuse but jesus no need to a) baby rage on comms, b) throw and c) tk. TL;DR: Go back to fortnite kid.
---
&gt; jump 10 feet in the air. How are we supposed to counter that?

With Jager's ADS of course.
---
Gonna send this to my friend and get him hyped for no reason
---
Still won against the Americans in the Battle of Brisbane :P
---
That is cool
---
Out of all their games, I am pretty sure this one is their biggest cash cow.  They have shown interest in fixing the game and something as easy as Crouch spamming is in fact not so easy.
---
I would absolutely accept an offer from Ubisoft haha 
---
Kinda hard when you get one tapped instantly or when you play on laptop so your screen is so small you have to squint your eyes to see him
---
Thanks!
---
Can somebody link me to the original post this was inspired from pls. I can't find it :(
---
Kapkan and Fuze are both sort of basic operators that are very strong in lower levels but become less usefull as you go up with your rank.
---
I suggest buying KapKan since his gadget is one of the strongest traps in the game (in my opinion, it is small, does the same damage as an Impact grenade and is "hard" to spot). Also try putting the traps crouching and looking at the bottom of the doorways, doing so you minimize the chances of getting your traps spotted.
---
Invisible glitch is back?! SACRÈ BLÈU!
---
Ah you’re right. On my crappy little screen I couldn’t see the lasers properly. I need to try this sort of thing.
---
What difference does that make?
---
Yeah thats pretty much what it is.. no shame admitting it. I originally made this for my friend.
---
I really just started using photoshop, so i only know the basics. Im gonna learn more in the future. Next time im gonna try to make my own effects and background
---
No longer need jackal. Just follow the rope.
---
Wouldn't that be hard to do for every single person who dies?
---
Yeah I can see I face it pretty much every time I play ranked an yeah they’re good but they’re definitely beatable, I’m just talking about the people who are garbage using it what’s the issue they’re usually worse than the average player
---
I had fps drops too and the problem for me was that I was using discord and had the in-game overlay on which took its toll on my frames, but I turned it off and it went back to normal. Don't know if this is your problem or if you even use discord, but I'll throw it out there.
---
I can get behind this as long as it’s not in the Ranked map rotation.
---
Yes make one that says "operation heart surgery"
---
Was that guy seriously in diamond? Or is this sarcasm
---
I mean we already have 2 invisible gadgets. Ubisoft already jumped the shark with the futuristic ideas like holograms and fookin laser guns. An invisible person would be broken though.
---
Nomad is absolutely op but its going to take a while before the playerbase realizes it
---
That hurt to watch.

people are also forgetting the ultity maestro brings with his secondary shotgun pistol and his god-tier primary LMG. Even more reason to ban him over an Echo
---
It's great, don't know what you're talking about.

probably bait
---
sorry for post necro but im having the same issue as you are. I just uninstalled my alt thinking it was the problem before i came across this.

Operator ability: Man eating Kohala
---
Yes but when he does it it's a viable strategy. When an enemy abuses this game's broken movement it's abusing the game's broken movement.
---
If you watch any Siege youtuber than you have heard of Apex Legends
---
I hope ability cool down will last a whole round
---
Except there was still always going to be 2 different versions, just a few maps were changing a few useless background asthetics

Epi literally confirmed day 1 that unless you lived on China only the few map changes would affect you but there would still be blood and knives and skull cosmetics

---
I’d dispute this. Playing the game seriously all the time is stupid, and it really depends on when and how you are playing. In causal it never matters, and given the name, you shouldn’t take losing or winning seriously. 
---
Granted, you’d sure as hell have a good relationship with people if you do throw the match, but having people act like casual is a play to win format is fucking stupid. If you want to win and play seriously, then go play ranked, if you want to be stupid play casual.

While Mira and Echo are both great, they are not fit for all maps and objectives. A bad Mira can fuck the entire team while an Echo at his worst is only useless.
---
I think casual should have all the maps. And every season, they should rotate the maps on ranked
---
This is Valk's fault for not killing Smoke.

Don’t buy any. If you buy r6 credits you’re clearly not old enough to play this game

Ouch! That’s gonna hurt!

yeah ridgey didge mate.

If I were than Blitz I would be furious.

They hated u/blackbeanborger for speaking the truth.

(ubi banned cunt from being written in text chat, why would they ever allow their operators to say the word?)

Implying people dont just write "n.igger" and "f.aggot" in chat now instead.

I've genuinely never seen Fosters sold in Australia, but when I went on holidays to the UK its in every second pub.
---
My uncle buys a slab of it every week. Fuck, I'd drink it if it was free and offered because it's cold, wet and alcoholic, but spending money on it? Yeah, nah, I'd rather get a half decent IPA for a little bit more.

Only one that I'm over is calling us convicts, when majority of the people making up the colonies weren't convicts. 
---
Let me do you one better, when people say "sweaty" or "try hard" in ranked. Don't even know what to say to that, I mean that is exactly what ranked is for, trying as hard as you can...
---
I don't really have a specific playstyle in mind as i just started but perhaps breaching, anchoring and flanking the enemy would be a good start.
---
I’m sorry but this is just wrong. Doc being able to take on multiple firefights while soft roaming is insanely strong. The ability to heal others is entirely secondary. 
---
I’m not even going to go in to the whining about spawn peeking when even the damn pros do it.

Pretty impressive that you did it without blitzing anybody. Cya on the frontpage

Yea, wtf is that about? It’s like her mouth is inside out...
---
I myself agree. He should have 3 of them. Even win/lose charts from Plat/Diamond levels say Kaid's performing too poorly.
---
He trusted you, and you failed
---
I can dig it.
---
Well i have no idea as well. Maybe Tower?
---
CONSOLE PROBLEM on Blitz
---
I meant the fact that beginners try to do it, fail and leave their team one man short, that's my issue, the selfish part of doc is my problem not good peeking, that's another discussion
---
If you got a doc that can win the round with harassing the attackers with his acog, I'll have less of a problem, but just trying, failing and wasting the stims just to get one lousy kill? That's nothing to support 
---
Knowing ubi, there is no guarantee that it won't get faster... on a side note it's an indirect nerf to tbaging
---
Aww  that's so wholesome. 
---
Thats what I'm thinking but is the that accually classed as a floor due to defenders not being able to access it lol?

I actually do have that headset and it's great, I upgraded from a headset that was incredibly 'bass-y' but with this one, every level of sound seems perfect. My level of play noticeably improved, I've played on PC ever since release and I've hit diamond twice since having it. Never even considered changing it, had it well over a year now.
---
Don't have that GSX1000 though, what does it do?
---
Sound like it's a problem on you side, i bought over 100 alpha packs with renown and my game never crashed.
---
1v3 clutch while *drunk
---
I agree with that assessment. Perhaps Buck's difficult and erratic recoil is a deliberate balancing decision on Ubisoft's part to affect his fragging ability.
---
Also a snake.
---
Just happend to me as well with Gold 1 and Plat 3 players. I was queueing with a friend and two guys in our team randomly killed one of us or just shot us to like 10 Health. I was so close to finally getting to plat 3 ...
---
When you go to this community on the subreddit you are able to to go an option near the subscribe and make post button to add flair. The icon for main op is called a flair.
---
Yes they will 
---
Ye it looks like ''try hard'' but im just plat 2 so ye XD
---
I hope one of the ops has some silly banter with clash: "Oi, cunt, I need some support." "DONT CALL ME A CUNT YOU FOCKING MOPPET!"  Lol, priceless.
---
Wow
---
one word, "casual" still good shit mang
---
ohhhh im stuck on the same day now i get it
---
I’m using auto atm, I’ve tried 3:2 but I feel like it’s harder. Might give it another go tonight
---
Then sit in the room while Fuze, Sledge, Buck and Finka grenade the shit outta you.

rank 100 aint shit LOL
---
True. 
---
And crouch walking
---
Me: *takes 30 seconds*
---
Some kid: GET OFF MCDONALDS WIFI
---
ffs
---
Pretty much, that's also why he's a 2-2. 
---
Same reason Hibana has a smaller magazine, it's just balancing because those operators have a lot of useful utility. Just so happens for Buck they decided to slap him with a lot of recoil. 
---
Very wow
---
Christ your late bro
---
Quantity over quality ya know
---
As soon as you purchase them, it should be added to your account in-game, why? Have you not obtained the credits?
---
Well I'd bet it won't be changed before the invitationals, the potential fixes are probably going to involve messing around with how fast the leaning and crouching is.
---
Leaning got changed to this current way quite recently which broke the 'fast lean' technique, but created this crazy spam that's very easy to do for a lot of people. This wasn't well received by most people.
---
Crouching has been the exact same since the game released, if they introduce a mechanic similar to how CS:GO handles it, that may be too significant a change to implement right before the invitationals.
---
I was thinking "so what, just a normal kill on that cav" then I realised you also killed the guy in the doorway, holy shit.
---
I’m glad this [Valk Strat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/a0e0jp/valkyrie_censorship/?st=JRW0JHKO&amp;sh=d564ba39) is spreading.

What if your ubi avatar is a copy of the receipt 
---
These boosted diamonds are never actually good and are usually the skill level of the ranks they play in (high silver to gold) when they’re boosting. Idk why everyone gets upset by this. It’s not like they have the skill of an actual diamond lol.
---
if you go to fast it does that welcome to siege 
---
Eh I kinda suck, I dropped from Gold 2 all the way to copper 4. Mostly just play this game to pass time or dick around with friends now 
---
The % of the people who actually play this mode seriously is pretty small compared to bomb (or competetive at all) mode. So i don't think that it actually matters. 
---
Really? Damn I haven’t played iq in forever
---
I played on a 3 weekend during white noise and literally only played the first situation then and I got it. Think it was something about playing a game before March 8th
---
If anyone didnt know free Ash skin has outbreak symbol on top left corner
---
It’s essentially impossible to get banned on console
---
Yeah I agree, I only play this mode on my solo Q account or sometimes ill play a couple casual secures before ranked and just treat it like tdm.
---
I got all of them ._____.
---
this question is kinda obsolete since Ubisoft already said, that he is going to be fully reworked.
---
Thats NOT how you mount chipset cooler. It should be the flat bottom that got contact to the chip, not the side.
---
Flex , too hard for me . 
---
My friend got both the Ash Elite **and** the CCCP White universal legendary skin from his free packs and I was hella mad because the only thing I wanted from the whole collection was the universal skin.
---
Meanwhile I got Kapkan's uniform and head + tachanka's head that both (esp. Chanka) look awful. 
---
If there is a operator can throw some speakers to make some gun fight sounds. It will be a nightmare for pros, is it?
---
That’s from priesT plz give credit
---
That skin is hella nice man, I also got Kapkans head too. The thing is that I also have his Elite. Feels bad
---
*J Ä G E R* 
---
Oh.... How?
---
Tachanka on attack
---
I was honestly disappointed when one of the packs I bought had the ash skin instead of the universal skin 
---
You are correct but as I mentioned, my VRM section is too narrow to put heatsinks like those in the picture on the bottom side. :) So I removed the thermal tape from the bottom, cleaned heatsinks and glued them this way instead. And it works too. :)
---
I believe you mean ‘flair’
---
Have it. much better than the alpha pack/training dummy/white mask charms. I put it on Clash's shield so Doge can judge those who get tased. 
---
Still looking thicc 
---
Interesting. Appears that sending it is the only solution
---
Could we get this in church on club house
---
I thought this was a tutorial on how do the the glitch. I was waiting for it to start thinking this was a video
---
Lmfao
---
I got that I love it
---
I've been Copper 4 too during Blood Orchid. I was scared to play Ranked until recent days.
---
Delete system 32. (Seriously just have steam verify files or reinstall the game)
---
Love it. Sounds like something I would do
---
Comp is the worst barrel out of the main 3... Why would you even want it?
---
Why did mute put down all of his signal disruptors around the hostage? He didn't want a drone to hit her...lolz
---
People out here really acting like Siege is THIS toxic. 
---
Why are you downvoting him he’s right
---
Friends don't play him, randoms can't play him 😂
---
NA servers can be pretty dead on weekdays depending on the time of day
---
Nada de suerte con el hipfire. Todo skill heredada de Battlefield 🤔😁
---
That's a pretty good idea tbh wtf
---
What are you even talking about? 
---
Yeah, tell me about it. Right now I got my arse whooped by a “pLaT” teamm8 for nothing. I shot his ass next and he said that’s why I’m bronze, it’s not because I’m bad, not because I don’t play ranked for month or so, but because I killed him in revenge xd 
---
Nice work man!
---
U dont need to be aimgod to rank up. Just wins count. Supporters may be end up killing less or no ppl in a round while fraggers can maybe get 2.0 k/d or more on the same team. FRAGS DONT MATTER, WINS DO MATTER.
---
Exactly, it's just a fun consept discussion :D
---
Mr stark? i dont fell so good..
---
I'd rather just have a Deathmatch mode.
---
Can u make the game like Apex Legend on console? This game has so much input lag on consoles
---
yeah i figured, i just saw the opportunity for a “joke” and i took it 
---
"I used to do donuts, like 5 minutes ago."
---
They've literally had pick and ban in the game for the past 2 weekends and you're complaining about this now? The way they have introduced pick and ban imo is perfect, testers over the weekends leading up to invitationals to gauge how the community feels about them. Just hope they make it a permanent mode with a ranking system.

Well it hurts since there is someone on my friends list (who is around the same ELO) who has been getting into many ranked matches during this whole 3 hour period where I haven't gotten into a match once . Q_Q I gave up after i watched an entire movie and it still didn't work.
---
Yes, highly possible :)
---
Think about the Outbreak gamemode. It had really nothing to do with the original game right?
---
Though it was (for some) a fun game mode for a while.
---
I Don't think Ubi will jump on the BR train at all. They even made a BR-similar game mode for The Division, which was still vastly different from the typical BR game mode.
---
How much time did you waste for that ?
---
Make sure you have all game modes enabled, sometimes it can be harder to find bomb over secure
---
This is why I feel like Siege shouldn't have teamkilling. Toxic shit like this happens way more than resetting and it's totally unfair.
---
Would be fun to have a new situation mission with each season designed to teach the players how the new operators work.
---
Finally!
---
But Favela is just disgusting in every way
---
He looks like he just belongs there. Insane job, I genuinely thought the soldier was there from the beginning, that you didn't photoshopped him in!
---
For real?!?!
---
You downed him, had time to lay out barbed wire and battery before getting killed. You earned the T-Bag.
---
2 hours writing, months of thinking and imagining:)
---
THICCEMS
---
Fuze’s AK-12 has the best dps in the game. He also has access to smokes making him useful when playing bomb. You can even put a cluster charge above the planted defused and desolate when needed. Personally  I think Fuze is in a good place and doesn’t need a buff or a nerf. 
---
I miss the old Hereford Base me and all of my friends would do a hatch drop and it was so fun
---
Oof that Ash... You shouldn't get a third chance with the shotgun. 
---
Its definitely not the most legit, let alone safe
---
Yep! Hear is the video they posted on YouTube: https://youtu.be/-lX2KjU9USM
---
He was the hardest part of the entire piece to get to look natural haha. Thanks! 
---
why not just give her ADS jackal vision.
---
That’s what I am saying, this should of happen months ago, I would just like more game changes updates, game modes. Fix ranked and bring it out of beta
---
But how will it know? The system itself would be flawed and the community would get free renown anytime they accused and the teamkilled someone. I can see what your going at, but its just a bad idea
---
Oh right, I forgot about how much he's picked in pl. Same with castle tbh
---
Why is ranked in beta? 
---
Bandit with Rook Armor Plates?
---
and to be found to be inferior those maps need to be deployed in the ranked experience for a period of time. Getting numbers and perspective from casual is not enough. It needs to be experienced within the ranked environment. 
---
How long those maps are in there is a different story, and there is a whole other conversation to be had about the time Ubi leaves maps that have been found to be flawed in the playlists. Though I will say that I completely disagree with your stance that they should be kept out upon release. I see more benefits in having them there than not. 
---
Yes
---
Why do you care what the label is?
---
You win the spelling bee.
---
Okay?
---
Man, for real. Everytime I get the new Hereford me and my boys will collectively sigh or say “you’re fuckin with me.” 
---
oops. ('\^.\^)
---
That exists? 
---
Yep, looks balanced to me
---
Yo what res is this
---
Do we transfer our argument from the other thread to here, bro?
---
Nah just doing it for fun

You could always just add to OneDrive and upload from there? That's been around for a long while
---
I wish it was. 
---
However currently speed can easily trump someone who is holding the more advantageous angle because they can glide past as such speeds. 
---
The person who is in the better position should win that fight with when semi decent aim, but that really isn’t the case currently in my opinion. 
---
I do agree that’s how it should be though, hence why I made this post 
---
It was a joke dude no need to take it seriously 😂
---
You are acting as if we have map that are so unbalance that it equel an automatic loss as soon as it played or as if using lion/ela = straight win. Yes some are unbalance and should be corrected but sometime you need to find an balance between having perfect map and having original and unorthodox map. In the case of the old hereford yes it lack some rotation path for defender and attacker since there was 1 staircase but even there i still find the map way more enjoyable than the new hereford even if the map favour one side to another and unless your a pro/top player there is always a way to win the round
---
Diffidently a 16 speed 9 armor
---
Now **THIS** is called good challenge.
---
Just hope it doesn't bring in more toxic ash mains that team kill when you take the kill.
---
If he’s not then who is? Sure Fuze has some situations where he’s useful but he’s the worst attacker by a decent margin imo 
---
She's never been that good unless you're in low gold because people's aim is bad and they aren't as aware at higher levels. Cavs primary's are awful and she is practically never used in plat. Can understand though if you're in gold or lower.
---
My team would have voted to kick me after getting the third kill.
---
To be fair, the massacre of millions of innocents kinda overshadows a symbol's original meaning for peace...
---
Finally have something to use my 600 units on
---
Just experienced this play Defending Trophy on Chalet, get called after I am one health from peaking someone from a window, tuck and go to turn off my phone to just instantly die from beneath to an IQ. Was really pissed for a second and then was like that's a good play can't be too mad, going to keep this in mind for the future. 
---
O my lord, how to unsee that?
---
will we ever get that as a load-up screen instead of the default one?
---
They're also making it easier for the newcomers or noobs of the game and kinda forgetting about the other players
---
Morgan Freeman: "It was at that moment, he knew, he fucked up."
---
Just saying for whoever takes this seriously, this is a joke , I know there are many signs of the swastika in history, It was just as a joke.
---
Looks more fed up with him taking photos.
---
👌🏻
---
If he were 2 speed he’d be good. I just can’t get down with how slow and loud he is. The AK-12 is amazing though so he’s far from useless. He’s just kinda the weakest attacker by default but no attackers are as bad as the worst defenders like Tachanka and Castle 
---
The gameplay mechanics are fluid in this game though, and would feel very odd and jilting if they made it so your strafe ADS speed was significantly lower. That’s my only concern. 
---
That’s why lowering movement speeds overall, will also nerf this mechanic, while keeping it fluid. 
---
I do not in any way disagree with you though 
---
Nezha vibes
---
Might as well. It’s about the same issue
---
But how do you enjoy something that is fundamentally imbalanced? Staircases are the very fundamental aspect of a map, and, let's be honest, unless you had a knife fight or a tea bagging contest, a loss is a loss and a loss is a waste of time. I don't know about you, but seeing "lost" on the screen is definitely not as fun as seeing a "win" or a "draw", because, well, I lost! Add an advantage that the opposition inherently had by default, and you have a really sh*tty experience.
---
Ha
---
Well we sorted it out, so it's just the wait for Ubi to read it.

Oh gosh, is that positive feedback I’m reading? :O

I’d love them to see this but I’m not expecting it. I, in no way, have much influence. Let’s just hope this gets upvoted so someone at least sees it and maybe reconsiders speed overall and maybe take some inspiration from this (eventhough it’s literally a couple of stat changes so there isn’t much influence to take)

That’s an update that shouldn’t of been a priority,  the Chinese make up a very small percentage of the game therefore it’s not really important. All I am pointing out is when is the last time we have had an update where we can all agree that we were satisfied with the game changes 
---
Pulse and Hibana are a "couple"  it just a pic of her and pulse meeting for the first time
---
Relevance?
---
Brilliant!
---
We know Ubisoft didn’t intentionally put in a nazi swastika, they did put in a symbol that looks similar to the swastika but has a completely different meaning and context. So the joke is taking the symbol out of context and mistaking it for something else, so its ironic, which is the joke.
---
Yeah these are the kind of challenges I like, one's that make me laugh, cry and scream... and cry again.  Genuinely. 
---
I swear you got this from a different threaf
---
I’ve messaged you
---
Came for the video, stayed for the jams. 
---
Well done sir. 
---
Yeah I know some people are like that, but it’s annoying when you lose your rank for something that isn’t your fault. Just like Ubi keeps a record of team killing from issuing temporary bans, they should keep too a record for disconnections and that way they would know if people are doing it on purpose or if it’s just a matter of an accident.
---
Yeah cunt
---
what about them?

The worst thing about this is that I was the top score guy in that match and got disconnected when the match was 3-2 just when the Last Round to win was starting. Having just a brief 3-5 minutes time frame to reconnect to the match is annoying as my internet wouldn’t let me get online. When I finally was able to do it, a pop up for my 15 minutes ban appeared and my Silver 1 rank too.

So Motel map confirmed?

Hopefully these come out before the expiration kicks in, I have 355 points, but they’re all super old. Like AC3 and before old.
---
Judging from your username, I’m going to guess you play Ash and Smoke
---
just in time to fuck over everyone with a backlog of units https://welcome.club.ubisoft.com/en-GB/units/
---
But it would be a pointless "buff" since you would be hipfiring like this and therefore the pistol would still be the better choice when you are using her gadget.
---
Operation: Mad Max is a go
---
This is pretty much it. Play the game, get used to angles. Get used to pre-firing and quick-peeking. Find a sensitivity that's fast enough to flick but not so fast that it's uncontrollable.
---
My sensitivity is 65 V 85 H and 30 ADS and I've been getting some nutty shots, but there's people like ImJustTooGud who run pretty low sensitivity and still are diamond and really good at the game.
---
Repost with bad quality and a black dot on it
---
The rumors are saying the defender can control attackers’ drones and the attacker puts a red trap that when a defender goes to the trap it makes a noise and does damage.
---
aa ill take 10
---
It’s pretty funny, you just don’t have a sense of humour 
---
Some of these are just down right disgusting and others I'm watching and squinting trying to figure out how the hell you saw them.
---
Fair enough my bad then. 
---
I use stock photos and composite them all together! 
---
Stunning? They made Clash look like a "Moppet" and Finka look like she was stoned out of her mind.
---
I genuinely found them more funny than stunning but to each their own.

&gt; You can tell if a player is hacking or not 
---
how?
---
Why do you play siege on your Gameboy
---
I'm pretty sure Ubi can see all the hackers past games and who was playing in it.
---
So I have a question. If a match I played in gets reset, will I get a notification or will I just suddenly be down or up a number of ranks with no explanation? 
---
I see this being very frustrating for players who don't keep up with all the news on the game to suddenly be deranked with no explanation 
---
It's hard to tell in the unblurred photo, but I think it might be just an AR with a lot of custom parts. 
---
I won’t tel the media if you give Jager,Bandit, and Smonk his acog back.
---
RIP Caveira. I do not get why people ban her in every game I play.

You are beating a dead horse. A company wanting to make money from a massive addition to their player base decided to change their mind (and lose money) in order to please their existing playerbase. Instead of thanking them for actually listening to us you come back months after all is said and done and post this? Move on kid.
---
It is in place to prevent a player that loses matches against a cheater, but wins all other matches, from being catapulted into extremely high MMR, even though they might be a Gold player all things considered.

Return of the opera map from rainbow 6 Vegas 2 would be dope.

No you sound like your complaining about a op in a game holding an angle in a game about holding angles...
---
I like the idea of a filter for toxic words.
---
TOXIC.
---
WORDS.
---
Not fucking 'negative', Ubisoft.
---
You right
---
I wasn’t expecting at all lmaooo
---
Because the time we have as humans on planet Earth is finite. When we play a game of Siege we will never get that time back. It unfairly robs innocent people of the time they spent. It’s one thing to go after the cheaters themselves and those that actively stack with them, but for the solo q person this is terrible. It would suck to have been the solo q to carry from bronze placement to gold only to sent back to bronze simply cuz one of the scrubs you carried was actually cheating. It arguably is worse, because on the rare occasion a solo q finds decent randoms and hits “play again as team,” they could be punished for doing what a normal player playing normally should do. 
---
Damn look at the cinematography on that teaser image
---
It’s ridiculous. I’ve literally gotten it flagged for saying the letter V in a game.

---

you can write to me personally. I will give a link 
---
I have only played like 3 placement matches ill play with you but i cant do it right now
---
All games with 'All Chat' get toxic. Seige is no different from any other game online that isnt heavily censored or restricted. Just mute the ones who annoy you and move on. 
---
Seems fair to me. It basically wipes out the games played with cheaters like they never happened. The interesting note was you will never get more mmr than your highest level achieved . Could be bad if you had a string of losses due to cheaters keeping you artificially low in rank. It’s a very long climb back up.
---
Idk about that one. That's why there's the point loss
---
I don't see it as a bad thing tbh. I've seen recently that alot more ppl just go out and roam. This could hopefully have anchors do their job, instead of hunting for kills.
---
I've done everything i've been told and it hasn't worked. Now i contacted ubi support and i don't know if they'll answer because tjey told me it'd be a while
---
Maybe raise it to 80-90 it might help a little
---
  From what I understand in the ps4 community, everyone goes full troll mode in Hereford hostage because they know it’s a trophy.
---
or clash. imagine looking at a clothing stand funny and she leaps out from behind a counter and bashes you over the head while screaming the whole time
---
CJIRU or "Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit" is actually a special forces unit built exactly for CBRN related incidents - it actually is kind of annoying they made up a unit instead of using one that exists...
---
If she had her Nades back, she would feasibly counter almost all of the defender gadgets (bulletproof cams and maestro cams were around where her nades were removed). It wasn’t meant to stop her fragging ability. It was meant to prevent iq from seeing and destroying literally every gadget.
---
So the people on the other team who lost elo are just SOL? Get over yourself. 
---
Nope. The game will be effectively erased from history of all present players. Any MMR win or loss for that match will be reverted for all players.
---
Now, we need boosters that only count in game time... 
---
What are your graphic settings
---
dont know ur playstyle but ops have rolls, you would hold an angle like that with a dokk or a BB not an ash, ash is a fragging on, people drone for the ash and she slays. try and change my mind 
---
Uhh, the screenshot of the page that I saw had the names the other way around (But if it IS the case that this is the defender, I'll be very happy)
---
Tbh, in most of those clips I'm using the first thermal scope (the one where dead enemies remained yellow) which leads me to believe those are clips from a while ago where I probably wasn't a very high level so neither were my enemies. 
---
The only thing im trying to figure out is what took this thermite so long to kill ur dumbass.
---
really? I haven't heard of it once, this seems much too broken not to be fixed IMO
---
Get ready for all the weeb fucks screaming about how she doesn’t look like she’s from an anime 
---
No. Literally no one does this. The PS4 community is not as toxic as everyone says it is. There is a toxic minority which you rarely come across.

where did all my braincells go?

---
thanks, you can add me when is possible,  steam uplay gourdboi  
---
That's actually extremely fair. Thank you for explaining. 
---
If you lost a game with a cheater in the lobby, and you're currently at/close to the max MMR you have had this season, you wont be granted any/much extra MMR
---
D E T A I L S
---
I don’t think you get that I don’t care about the cosmetic. My point is, the siege challenges aren’t even challenges. All of them are just things you do in the game by just playing. It’s time for a challenge revamp
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Don't pick blitz 
---
Well I’m saying it as when I tried to get the trophy on 4 different rounds on Hereford on all 4 occasions my team was team killing or just generally not trying to win (one of the matches being on ranked) 
---
Gotta love casual
---
Blitz shoulder is always slightly exposed. If you want a shield OP with full coverage it's gonna be Monty or Clash
---
Begin Again
---
Is there any MMR punishment for leaving matches? If so, could I leave when theres a cheater and possibly get the MMR back later?
---
You play hostage on ranked?
---

Is it just me or are Glaz kills so satisfying?

If they do this I hope they add some more Ubi club challenges for Siege. I have all of them completed and have no points to spend.

Lovely work! What's the piece on the stand?

Okay so let's say obj is penthouse. The attackers are likely to put an insane amount of pressure onto VIP so you're probably out of there by the end of the first minute or so. It's an example of a part of maps where attackers are probably going to get control of fairly easily 90% of the time like the main lobby in Oregon and after that they can just destroy whatever ADSes you decided to hide in there if they haven't been burnt out already. Jager is a good counter against nomad if she tries to plant her airjabs into spots people are likely to pretty much anchor down in but is not a counter for key map areas that attackers are likely to control. And no you've never had to use someone with a destructive gadget to roam or else Jager would never have been a roamer. Obviously it's better to do it with someone with impact nades or even C4 as makes it easier to destroy claymores and make rotates but there were always ways around it like having your teammates make rotates for you in prep phase. 
---
inb4 his T-hunt line is just making motorbike noises

As far as I know give compensator 15% in hipfire spread after firing

Either rush him or bait him into a room.
---
I didn't say that other communities were much better. But this community is definitely one of the worst. Not even just the blatant, racism, sexism, and homophobia. Just the amount of teamkilling is staggering. I run into some cool dudes every now and then, but %70 of the time it's a bunch of shitters.
---
To be fair, the shotgun shoots fast as fuck boiii
---
HEEEEEEE
---
She's a fragger with tons of utility. So you basically play like ash but you have more options. She's weaker in combat than ash because your a 2 speed with a gun thats not quite as good, but your utility more than makes up for it. You want to use impacts for sight lines, hatches, and creating vertical sight-lines like buck. Use concussions to scout rooms, disorient camping enemies and to hit common holds. 
---
I wouldnt be so mad if the map show up more often. But it happened 2 times when I played last few days.
---
Looks good !
---
unfortunately cunt is filtered so there probably won't be a voiceline ;-;
---
that's the purpose of them. do stuff in game and get things for free. it doesn't matter that it's not "kill 52 players while bunny hopping through a window"
---
you're supposed to be able to get these challenges just by playing the game
---
i feel “Operation: Blue Chip” would be a good name for this
---
Don’t sit with blitz if you give them time to think you die put pressure on them and keep it 
---
That's like saying ela mines are easy to shoot because they glow red. People can hide them in spots like above doorways that you can't see or get a line of sight on to shoot.
---

Man, same. Wasted points in The Division and I don't even play anymore! 
---
That There
---
The thief robbed a bank, gave you money and the cops came along to get back the cash they gave you to send it back to their rightful owners.
---
Effort ? What effort ? Effort for standing there while the cheater is giving you the win ?
---
Again, the only thing that happened is that you lost some of your time due to this disruption. You earned points that the cheaters robbed from other players.
---
Before this, when cheater queue they not only fuck the system up, but also take the points you've actually put "real effort" to earn on top of making you lose your time.
---
Now they can fuck the system up and waste your time but don't hinder your progression.
---
So please, explained to me how having 2 bad things instead of 3 makes thing worse now.

Only the points from before march 2017. That's a looooong time to hold onto Club points. I doubt most people have a ton of points from before that time, most people use them gradually for the games they purchase and play. That was their intended use, after all. 
---
There is a calculator that you can use to check if you have any points that will expire. If you see that a few dozen points are going to expire, just use them on some unlockables in Far Cry, AssCreed, Division, Siege or any other Ubisoft games you own already.

Decently strong if used correctly. Fairly weak otherwise.
---
Her airjab is very strong for holding flanks, especially runouts. It is also decently easy to flush people out of hard points or just straight up deny map control for certain parts of the map.
---
Her guns kinda leave things to be desired. Her gadget's ceiling allows for that to be an okay thing, but because a lot of people don't use her well, that's probably why she seems lacking.

Depends on ur playstyle.

That. Will. Never. Happen.

You can already see that people either ban broken operators or those who are hard to play against like Echo. Siege is not a cozy little tactics game where you have communication and everyone is doing their part. Siege is a toxic shithole where some retarded Ash main will tk you or throw the game because you banned their beloved Ash. 
---
And most people who are below plat (and some on plat) have no clue of stats and which operator is better on a particular map, so your point invalid. 
---
P&amp;B is ONLY possible when playing as a five men stack. Otherwise it will be a mess of random bans, toxicity and simply bans of strong operators. 
---
Welp, guess shes thicc in a different way.
---
I think I'll get hibana
---
You do not wish to know, mortal
---
"It's Ma"am!!!!!!!"
---
Yes but it's still a primary goal of hunting roamers. Which is what Dokk and Jackal do actively every round. Dokkaebi isn't used at her best if she's sent directly to the objective. That's why she has a SMG with a high fire rate, to compete with roamers in CQB. 
---
Is it French. Oh yah it is!
---
Now let me use them for R6 credits and maybe I'll be happy
---
And Alibi looks way different from the render/in game model
---
Not really man. I definitely think something needs to be done about the level of sheer toxicity in this game. But what can be done? People will always be cunts. 
---
Sledge with shotgun is best sledge. Prove me wrong.
---
Same happened i just contacted support and they fixed it for me
---
Got the season pass and I’m so excited for year 4
---
Nobody tell me the name of the RS:V casino map i'm trying to remember
---
 hostage looks at the cam as if to say ‘see you on the front page’ 
---
No.  There's basically nothing you can do about is besides vote kicking or killing them back.  Reporting for toxicity does literally nothing
---
It’s the legendary outfit from the new packs
---
Calypso?
---
Hibana is very versatile but there are situations where a bigger hole is just more ideal. I think you should get Thermite first because he’s  like 5x cheaper and he’s more well rounded (2 speed 2 armor while Hibana is 3 speed 1 armor). But it’s up to you of course 
---
It's the new skin
---
that’s essentially what they did, but they widened a lot of rooms and added a few extra. plus they completely changed the aesthetic. only huge difference is top floor 
---
That's actually sick. I wonder how often you could pull this off in an actual game. I'm gonna get my friends in a custom 5v5 and hope this works lol.
---
I got like 60........ Dont think i will get any  :(
---
God forbid a mechanic of a tactical game force people to play tactically 
---
Are your service centers huge? I used to work at a service center for heavy duty mack and volvo trucks, it would easily be the smallest map in siege. I'm having trouble imagining this map at all
---
Yep
---
I wish. My friend who likes to say some  weird shit ( he's weird but he good at siege) yelled through his mic " I hope they find out your Hitler's long lost grandson and that they hang you from your feet while feeding you the blood of you family, then publically hang you".
---
Only ubi knows
---
Yeah they definitely are. They have a big role and can do a lot of damage.
---
It seems they are trying to shift the meta to be more of a standoff like the game started. Problem is you can have all the abilities in the world, the only way to stop a roamer is to hunt him and kill him quick. This won't change much for that. 
---
Don’t hip-fire?

Quick delete this so only I know about it

Yep, record them and use the report a players feature on the Ubisoft website.

---
You can DDOS any server client for a specific person, but there's not much that can be done. But if you find the person you think did its IP address, you can have your internet provider file a lawsuit, I'm pretty sure, since it's an attack on the company and Ubi. Don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure, may not work like this anymore, but I think that is what you can do.

Lawsuits, I realize, may not be a good decision to being disconnected.

The road to SI automatically uses the outfits from the packs even if you don’t have them

Casual clips REEEEEEEEE
---
Idk, they said they were going to add it.
---
I agree with the premise of this post, but can we stop pretending that women experience discrimination online more than men? Toxic people are toxic no matter who they're talking to, so stop expecting special privileges when the rest of us go through the exact same thing. Go ahead and downvote me, white knights, sjws, and feminazis, but just so you know, you'll never achieve the respect you want unless you can learn to think objectively and without collective agendas.
---
In ranked I wouldn’t ban her. But this is for all intents and purposes casual, and so I don’t really like having to call out for possible cav locations, drone around looking specifically for cav, etc. when I’m just dicking around with friends. It’s true that she doesn’t have great fragging ability and is generally easy to deal with, but she changes turns the stakes of the games to be higher than I would be comfortable with in a casual game mode.
---
It's a separate playlist that uses your casual mmr. The running theory is that this is a test run before they implement some or all of these features into ranked.
---
Agreed
---
But a trap isn't actively hunting roamers, it's about delaying them, redirecting them or identifying them. It might allow for it, but I don't think it'd be the primary purpose. Hopefully It'll be to delay, redirect and or alert you that someone is coming your way. 
---
Maybe like dokkabei on defense. Get a kill hack the phone and we get drones. But not move them just turn them like cameras.

How does this impact placement matches? Say you get a couple rollbacks in those but you don't tend to play a lot of ranked due to wanting more map variety...

Are you unranked again?

Community is so much better. I'm really struggling to get along with keyboard and mouse so I often still use my controller (sorry, not sorry). I've turned the shadow details down so I can get good fps, noticed a big difference.

That realization when Rook and Cav weigh the same. I’d be more concerned by sneaky girl stealing it.

&gt;It isn’t accounting for other player choices though.

I know, is something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/LleQF3J) better? I would really appreciate any tips.

Now you're just assuming shit. I've played well over 900 hours of this game. I'm not just talking out of my ass when I say the community is shit.

Also we don't like cancer ruining games.

Will post update soon!
---
That’s the number one reason not a lot of new people come is because of the childish toxic people here

Even big name streamers who tried to join backed off because of the toxicity

How many civilians do you think they would have killed in their bios?

Indeed this is by far the best one I've seen to date

man those gun skins look like absolute ass.

Then ill bow off 220 u coins

That happened to me when wind bastion came out and a few others mentioned it too. As far as I know they haven't fixed it. I've turned the shadow details down and noticed it has got much better.

You're asking female players to jump through all these hoops just to enjoy a game. You can't be fucking serious with this. This takes some serious moon logic just to justify letting toxic shitbags to continue being part of our community.

Can't you just do it in private match alone to avoid that?

Ubisoft Montreal as a company can make one hell of a game but their PR isn’t all that great *cough* E3 trailer *cough*
---
"UK and Maori"

"Australian Ops"

So they should censor what one culture says because of another one? 
---
Oh they added bruce jenner to the game?
---
There is a “no vote” button for spawn locations, why shouldn’t P&amp;B  act identically?
---
I don’t know what’s wrong with the current way this system works.
---
&gt;Everyone gets shit talked in games for simply being who they are. It’s sad that they’re people like that, but they exist. Have a squeaky voice, then expect to get shot talked for being a kid. Have an effeminent male voice, well then expect nuclear waste levels of homophobic toxicity. Have a geographic region that is easily recognized by your accent or screen name, then expect all kinds of trash talk along the lines of been a redneck, libtard, gay, and stuff regarding people from Mexico that even I won’t repeat. Women want to be treated equally, well ladies welcome to being equally shit talked. Many of these instanc3s happened to. E over the course of my life, and it has been either the moment my screenname appears in game to everyone else or when I speak with my mic broadcasting to the game. It literally the same, but I simply use existing functions to ignore the offenders rather than try to monetize the situation with YouTube videos. 
---
Yes. All those examples are true and valid and should be punished along with the assholes in the OP. Just because something is the norm or has been tradition doesn't mean we shouldn't work towards something better. It'd be much better if the equality you speak of was the equality of not being berated while trying to play a game. Let's work towards that instead of accepting this toxicity. 
---
&gt;I mentioned Jr. High school, because everyone alive has to go through that awful time of our lives where shit talking and bullying is common place, and the most valuable life skills we learn from those formative years are how to deal with it. And no IRL one doesn’t simply knock out one’s teeth for that because that is a felony crime called assault with great bodily injury.
---
Once again, U Wot M8? I don't know what Kumbaya, peace loving, "We are family" section of suburbia you are from, but this isn't reality and I truly feel for you for not knowing that. You cannot talk however you want to to anyone IRL without consequences. Do you honestly think people give 2 fucks about a law in the heat of a moment? Chances are, unless there is video evidence, witnesses and charges are pressed, a bloody beatdown will never be a blip on the cop's radar. People come up missing over shit like talking crazy to the wrong person. Once again, go to any bar, school or whatever and come at someone sideways, and you will see just how much consideration they have for the laws of the land. 
---
&gt;Yes, telling a person to their face in a serious manner that you’re going to rape them is policed. Where I live that is the felony crime of criminal threats; however, the reason why such an action is criminal is because of an element to the crime called immediate likelihood that the threat would be carried out, and a second element that receiver of the threat understood such a statement be serious as opposed to somebody obviously making it a joke.
---
No no no no no no no, you misunderstood my point. You're too hung up on the legality of things, let that go for a moment. My point was we as a society don't tolerate anyone who says to someone's face "I'll rape you", with the word "policing" not meaning the actual authorities, rather the enforcement regulations or an agreement. In this case I used bars, schools, brothels and everything else as examples of where things like that would be met with swift and immediate consequences from the people that inhabit them. Take the bar for example. If someone were to say "I'll rape you" to a woman in a bar, the police are going to be the last of their worries. There will be multiple angry people who will begin to manhandle and ultimately stomp out whoever said that. Obviously, that isn't going to happen on the internet, but why is it that we should accept that same phrase being so flippantly used in a game with no action whatsoever from Ubisoft? If your answer is because the person saying that they'll rape someone in chat or over voice comms poses no true threat and therefore it's fine, then I'd tell you that you are missing the bigger picture. The OP had around 100k views the last time I checked it out on Twitter. Shit like this is really not a good look for Siege and it keeps people from playing the game since nobody wants to hear that bullshit and whether there's a mute button or not is irrelevant when this people's impression of the community and they never pick the game up.

Well rip, i have only 10 club units....

Check tour computer for anything that can slow down your computer. I had a similar issue on my last computer and it ended up being a virus or malware (I cant really remember) that decreased my frame rate in game from 110 avg to 30 avg. I would suggest getting avast antivirus free and run a scan, then see what it detected and get rid of it. If this doesn't work then I would ask a more experienced person as I am no professional. Good luck finding a solution though!

Depends on who you play the most currently.

Legendary headgear leaked

Great, I spent all my points on Far Cry 5 and Assassin's creed because I thought they were useless.

Get both eventually but Echo is more useful overall, especially at higher levels of play.

Or Phil and Lil's Mom from The Rugrats.

I think he already did, and he’s staring at Cav running away without them, his hatred for her growing fast, and the temptation to TK her growing even faster......

Or he’s just trying to remember why he woke up with a baguette in his ass this morning after that party.

Idk, either or.

It’s a pretty easy switch imo. Only hard part is getting used to the keyboard. I solo queued myself to gold and I’m currently hovering between g3 and g2. Just need to find a comfortable mouse + dpi/sensitivity combo and you’ll be set.

Firstly, duh doi the dlc ops are gonna be "op". For one they were developed with the game and its systems already established so its alot easier to make an OP that does something considered broke. Like Blackbeard or Dokk, and the other thing is why wouldn't Ubisoft release really strong characters? It encourages people to buy the season pass and have access to them. Would you contemplate buying the season pass if it gave you a seasonal skin and a discount in the store? Fuck no you wouldn't. Ubisoft gives the season pass value by making sure that new ops are strong and that season pass is probably a pretty decent chunk of yearly sales which helps fund development of future titles. 
---
Well i bought the entire set upon release and got it at 23/25. Some got it without buying the set either from first pack or one of the challenge packs. Its all rng baby

Pc players aren’t that much better. I switched to pc last month and solo queued straight into mid gold. Not saying that’s a high rank or anything but the common opinion that console players will be destroyed by pc players isn’t necessarily true.

Your reaction is the reason it will never change. Rather than saying, "That's not cool!" you said, "It happens to men, too!" Whether that's true and to what degree is a separate conversation. You've simply diminished this one, giving cover to those whose behavior should be easily rejected by the community.

*meaty whack* “Outstanding move.

NO

That would be great but I don’t see how that would work with a controller

I burst out laughing at that.

This map was an absolute shite. I liked the aesthetics more but it was so poorly designed it was hated but most of the players. I wish they sticked to the visual side though.

I have about the same, they’ve been doing these points for years

Arent most of the operators picked in the pro league base game ops tho? :D

If you play bomb, echo is amazing and since he didn't get nerfed along rook and doc, he is really strong and my current favorite anchor.

This is so satisfying to watch

It's never going to change because it's the internet and people are people. There's no way to stop trolls. At all. If you find a way to deter them they will find a way around it.

Oh haha never thought of that 
---
Could be within a smaller radius as you could argue it has a much smaller signal when turned off but idk just shooting blanks
---
And a way of detecting mnk...
---
Dude. If your team loses with a cheater and they're banned. You get that MMR back.
---
Matches with cheaters will be reverted back to nothing as if they never happened.
---
Right well i alreqdy like Mozzie

YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
this was my first time team killing in a long time.
---
Nah he's Arthur Morgan 
---
They said FOV setting can’t be added due to increased hardware pressure.
---
It's fucking mountain mama in spanish
---
Not possible in a hardware sense since XIM tricks the console into believing its a controller being used. 
---
Ok is that Maverick with facial hair, or am I missing something?
---
It's coming anytime. Us players on the Forums have been talking with Devs and last we heard is that they're working on it.

Get ready!

Yes i do. But i don't like Fuze. Actually i hate fuze tbh lol. I got killed so many time bc fuze fuzing somewhere close to me and my screen shaking but enemy team player's screen is fine and dandy. That's why i don't like Fuze.

WOW TOXIC!!!!!
---
Meanwhile you can get the same amount of renown for a 5 minutes match of Terrorist Hunt.
---
Agreed, but what if the console tricked the XIM into thinking it's a mnk?! IDK I feel like there could be some sort of crypto-software that would resolve in the handshake which would declare it's not a XIM product.

The 1 game is Siege. It gets worse than Siege, far worse. You have to read before you reply

There isn't a no vote option for P&amp;B you just simply don't pick anything when it pops up and operators are more important than a location, at least to me.

Bet they add this after all club units expire March 31st.
---
"Which I guess is just jizz.."
---
*blunt skill increased*
---
I had no idea that was possible, I'm on ps4 though 
---
Ye well that seems legit👍🏿
---
Or they could just add M&amp;K to the game but the m&amp;k players would have to be on a separate server than the controller players.
---
I'm not saying it's not possible on a controller, just a big disadvantage for accuracy and leaning.
---
If Mozzie is anything like it's namesake, hes gonna be one annoying bastard for the defenders...bring Mozzie spray defenders
---
Maybe the logic is that his bolts are too fast and thin to be picked up by Jager's ADS.
---
I hope they add it before the end of March. I’ve been sitting on hundreds of these things for the longest time

How does green run in those shoes?

It's possible I don't know how since I'm on Xbox but Google knows.

Laser makes it so all of your bullets hit inside of the crosshair 
---
I know there’s been times where me and my mates have discovered a cheater on our team and teamkilled until every round/ thrown the game to a loss. Should we lose elo in this situation? 
---
that would fix nothing. people use a Xim to have a advantage. why would they stop using a xim if you could use MnK on xbox 
---
Was this Part of the outbreak? I didn’t play t too much 
---
That would fix so little of the problem on its own I feel. People like the XIM for the unfair advantage it brings. Few people would switch off XIM to regular mnk since they'd have to fight other mnk.
---
I really don't think you get the point here. This is feedback for the S.I. playlist (to hopefully improve in the future). You don't need to tell me what game mode I should rather play.
---
Says the one going out of their way to be upset at someone calling out bullshit
---
His pick rate does not justify a nerf. As for the ADS the projectile is too small. Bullets also dont get obstructed
---
yes..
---
you think Capitão needs a NERF? What game are you even playing 
---
Tbf if we can’t move them then far less people are probably gonna just leave their drones at spawn
---
Operation Far Cry New Dawn?
---
Nein
---
If he gets a elite hell yeah!
---
Well if we don't complain thousands of times they might not care enough to fix it ever. I'm sorry you and probably most of this sub is tired of seeing it. But it needs to be acknowledged by big companies.
---
oh no i get the point. you’re upset you don’t get more renown for playing. you get less renown for losing. that’s how it is in every other mode. 
---
Have you seen Maverick? It even works with the guys brand and everything.
---
Who ever said that
---
Nice.
---
Why does it always have to be attractive people in video games? Ugly people exist too

yes.. he was the "leader"

 Thanks for sharing u/TheSubs0!  Amazing op wallpapers, Private117!

it would give her counter roaming ability, the ability to see any anchors on sights through walls and her vertical play would become insane.

Siege has controller support disabled by default on console. Thats something Microsoft would need to do to but they let developers have the choice to allow for m and k support. Ubi disallow it but its still possible through XIM.

It's actually the other way around. According to ubisoft poland the attacker (Gridlock) is female and defender (Mozzie) is male

Thatcher looks like he's like SHIT! I fookin' forgot! Can I blow this Six Inch Blade?
---
I completely agree, all they need to do is connect loading dock and garage 
---
What's your sensitivity/DPI?
---
Why does Nomad looks like the Lotd Maximus Farquaad...
---
Why are they adding an expiration date in the first place? With no other way to get units aside from obscure achievements and buying games?
---
They just want to milk people by either forcing them to play games they don't want to, or buying more things on the store.
---
How many hours do you have. Follow up question you have room for one more, asking for a friend who needs to be carried :)
---
That gun would look funny af with a holo 
---
Awkward...
---
Ela is already posted (just check my post history) and iq will follow soon :)
---
Your at 69 upvotes i cant do it im sorry
---
Everyone voted 'no vote' ^^
---
That's when you break out the superior shield op FUZE with that dastardly PMM
---
Best handgun in the game, plus you get a high destructive gadget
---
As a Texan, I knew exactly what the link was gonna be, I absolutely fucking love buc-ees, beacer nuggets are kinda trash through.
---
No bans from either team 
---
Valk bird with the ela mine in its talons 
---
On certain guns yes. Like twitch’s f2, ash’s r4c, jackal c7e. I use it on buck so I can stand farther away from walls and shotgun them. 
---
I honestly respect you fir taking responsibility and not acting like you didnt have any part in the matter. 
---
Go commit carbon monoxide poisoning
---
Me 
---
Kinda obvious it's a trans though.
---
I’m interested!
---
R6maps if you want a layout. The recent dlc maps aren’t up there sadly 
---
There was the Outbreak thing too.
---
I think I’ll draw another one for ela, I don’t like this one much
---
That’s bad?? You seem happy?
---
The choice is obvious.
---
I don’t think he did lol
---
It's on a relatively high spot where it's kinda dark and it's also a small space. Go into a custom game and see how hard it is to see.
---
Id say wait for the reveal of the specifics of the new operators and if neither one really interests you that much, go ahead and buy maestro because he has a lot of utility and a solid LMG, not to mention an Acog.
---
Mom?
---
If your settings are set too high, and your internet isn’t great, it will send too many high quality packets with not enough internet. Try lowering your in game settings if you can
---
Wait until they revel the new ops then you can decide. 
---
This
---
Prove it
---
This madman is actually wielding the nailgun... 
---
This should be on r/oddlysatisfying the pistol shots were so niceee

thank you ubi
---
From what ive been told by many people, the kill cam is what the server side saw, so it will be slightly different from your client side. Not sure if true though. 
---
Why would I? No point in lying if they post my chat logs I’m not going to be exposed I just feel like a perm was a big jump 
---
You could have played it like a year ago in ranked or casual without smoke but now only the unsmoked version is in terrorist hunt if you are lucky. It is a 1/20 chance that it won't have gas.
---
Well tbh like I said in game brightness is relative to your tv as well so someone can still see you if they have default settings on rainbow but a little
---
Higher brightness on their tv so you probably won’t get a direct answer ya know 
---
Probably hax
---
This is so satisfying
---
I've had that since operation health.. Had to turn my GPU overclocking off, only game that would crash, even on low clocks.
---
BiTES ZA DUSTO
---
Jackal and lesion? 
---
I have no mouth but I must scream! 
---
Took
---
If only he could *READ*
---
Oh.
---
&gt;You're asking female players to jump through all these hoops just to enjoy a game.
---
I am asking all players. You are setting up some really pathetic strawmen here.
---
&gt;You can't be fucking serious with this.
---
I am.
---
&gt;This takes some serious moon logic just to justify letting toxic shitbags to continue being part of our community.
---
Another Strawman. I never justified anything. Such people will always be part of communities and there is no way of exterminating them. I just believe that all genres of insults are equal and the only difference is in the magnitude of the insult. To keep my point short, there are many ways to ignore or even fight this, therefore I dont think we should give these issues the amount of attention we are currently giving them.
---
Sexism and racism of any kind are bad, but everyone has enough ways to combat it. This is not an issue unique to female players.
---
Jackal
---
I conquered 
---
Appreciate the updates!
---
Knowing things are being worked on make a huge difference peace of mind wise.
---
I just want to say a thing about your first point, in a game like siege it is hard to balance it for everyone, if they balance it around normal users pros will be punished and there for the esports scene might suffer or maybe even die, the pros and streamers are the people who bring in the most of the playerbase and if those dissapear so will the playerbase, no playerbase= the game dies this means they have to think out a way make it work for everyone, which is why a game like CS is good as they cant Nerf a certain skill range in the same way.  But on the other hand if you balance it around pros the normal players get punished and they might stop playing the game which lowers the playerbase.   
---
im not good at english so these sentences might be incorrect spelled and other stuff but i tried my best  
---
Lol
---
My GPU isn't even OC. It started just after that stupid update they out out on Wednesday or whenever it was. Every time I hop into a game on attack it instantly crashes.
---
that sucks
---
Valks lost Twin
---
We had leaks at the end of last year actually. Some strings of their gaadget names and so on.
---
Nomad is totally checking maverick out
---
Context matters, just saying the word doesn’t make you a racist
---
. 
---
You need to use it in a racist connotation, which means you would have to profess that a race is inferior, sincerely, that’s the keyword, if you’re making a joke, then you aren’t racist. 
---
The kind of logic is what gets people arrested for making jokes in Scotland about their dog being a wee Nazi. 
---
Yes its casual and yes its console.
---
Still like it. Especially the ash-pain-sound is satisfiying caus normally you dont hear that too often.
---
Find a squad, or even just one person to play with, it’ll greatly improve your experience 
---
Fuze's mask and goggles are made for motorcycles as well, but no one complains about that, no?
---
It's not the fucking jawline lol she straight up looks like a male with make-up.
---
Tachunk, not only is he the lord but ive gotten pretty good at spawnpeeking with the turret...
---
yeah i was really confused and then almost frustrated. playing as Ash on a map covered in smoke maybe wasn't the best choice. i got blown up by that bomber guy within the first minute of the game. i could hear it but couldn't see it, and spectating my teammates was just as harsh. we won thanks to my teammates who have obviously been playing longer than i have, but i was still very confused the whole game. thanks for answering!
---
Paki is much more than shorthand and anyone using it in the UK knows it.
---
I have been called an idiot, said that I should die and be raped. Seriously, how the fuck is this different. People shit talk on the internet 24/7, just ignore and mute them. They stop when they can't get any kind of reaction.
---
75. It was way too dark on skyscraper at the time
---
That helmet is kinda dumb
---
We know they don’t get matched with them but it still could be a plat players friend who’s a copper. There’s no way for ubi to really know outside of MMR gained on that account, so in terms of rank, the teams are even
---
“Better with Friends”, not “Good Community”. Good try though.
---
You don’t know me, you’re assuming things to try and justify not using the tools given to you. Grow up
---
spooky ghosts
---
Tbh you should have enough time to get 25k renown by the time they release for everyone.
