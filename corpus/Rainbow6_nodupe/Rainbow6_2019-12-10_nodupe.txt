I've spenth 100k and got 20k back in dupes. Not a single legendary. I feel like I wasted my renown. I know it's not real money, but it's hours and hours of grinding without any kind of good reward. The system should allow for a secure reward. Or maybe even "pay me 100k for a non duplicated legendary alpha pack".
---
You took...everything from us!
---
It's one of the only ones I like, most of the elites look kinda grody to me
---
I just use the suppressor...it looks cool.
---
It's Nova Prospect from Half Life 2
---
Either way the red dot is still completely useless
---
Holo gives you a clear reticle in exchange for a blocky sight, Reflex gives you a small sight that doesn't obscure too much of your screen in exchange for a bigger reticle. Red dot has the downsides of both without any benefits
---
Looks more feminine than gridlock
---
Yeah now that you mention it I do remember hearing about the expensive and unique ammo. Didn‚Äôt know about everything else though, so thanks

The traditional 2.5 SSD is not even the future anymore, you can get a top tier Samsung 860 EVO 500GB for $60, and the less luxury SSD 500GB are around $40 only. That's just the cost of a standard video game copy.
---
Those m.2 nvme SSD are the future and a lot of people who build a new PC right now are into those, they do not require a SATA cable and they are much smaller, and of course speed is at least 5 times faster than traditional 2.5 SSD.

I should clarify... I have all the ops. So what you're talking about here with "wasting renoun" and "wasting my time grinding" aren't really a big deal to me. If I want cosmetics I'd just buy them. I don't play the game to get alpha packs. I play the game to play the game - so this whole argument about wasting time for an **extra** feature just sounds assinine to me. No offense.
---
Ok buddy üëç
---
I would like to actually see a video of him shooting that thing and not just holding it for the camera. Then I would be impressed.
---
I like that, I wouldent mind that in game either.
---
Isn‚Äôt it because they can‚Äôt legally add more
---
SasgAcog
---
Wait what?
---
yes you lose MMR unless you reconnect and win. you also get banned if you leave and do not come back
---
Yea and a 15 minute ban
---
So....we bots now?
---
&gt;The SBMM ruins it.
---
There isn't a full fledged sbmm in siege. Your kills don't count towards your rank. Only win loss does and the rank difference between you and your enemies
---
I'm aware they're two different playlists. What I was getting at was the level of sweaty players in Casual makes it feel like they merged the matchmaking queues of the two playlists without telling anyone to shorten queue times.
---
u/SAU-SIEGE, please make a pt2 where Recruit gets another one and is happy!
---
Tachanka help us if this ever happens
---
Another set of spots is to put them round corners where people come round aiming. Doorways and corners, people will walk forward while aiming and hit them, and in other places, they will come round and walk back into them
---
Operation Shifting Vibes
---
Wamai is brest op ever because of his dance
---
The community has so many simple buff ideas for Nokk that it‚Äôs ridiculous that they still haven‚Äôt changed her. Even if they don‚Äôt want to take the time to give her a new gun, they could make her a 3 speed to justify for her having no ACOG. Or give her smoke/frag grenades. Or make her ability quiet while sprinting. Or even just buff the ROF/damage of the FMG-9. Also, IQ has ACOG on the AUG while Wamai doesn‚Äôt, so why couldn‚Äôt they just give ACOG to the FMG-9 (as weird as it may look) to make her on-par with other attackers?
---
People are going to be sweaty regardless of what they do with the game. 2 years and I had sweaty players since day 2. That stuff won't change. All this change did was add a consistency amongst all gamemodes in siege, and it ain't even a dramatic change because the numbers are still the same.
---
I play casual a lot, and will do for about half a season more, and I know that things have been the same and will be the same because it is casual- people are entitled to play however they like. It is their money, after all. They have the freedom to spend it as they please as long as they don't violate the TOS. So you'll see both cluster duds and sweaty players. That's *their* way of having fun. You cant really complain against that.
---
Wrong sub
---
It's... The same thing. Just the name change, and they switched up how the rounds work a little
---
Before: Attack-Defense-Attack-Defense
---
After: Attack-Attack-Defense-Defense
---
You're still playing the same game, the middle two are just switched. It's not like this small change suddenly tripled the skill level of everyone in the gamemode
---
I dont know why but i genuinly felt for recruit here. I legitimately becaume sad from reading this.

Not even my k/d in the last two seasons is 1.5. I‚Äôm just so used to bs whilst solo que that I‚Äôm scared to derank. Also when I was stuck in elo hell I made it my ultimate goal to get plat one day as I knew I was easily good enough and now I‚Äôve got it I don‚Äôt wanna go on a losing streak and finish gold for the season.

---
The bear trap is the elite skin for Frost. And someone else can correct me of I'm wrong, but i think blue is for defenders looking at cams and orange (or whatever color it is) means an attacker is looking through it
---
[removed]
---
The fact that you know what im talking about says all u need to know about the mp5k
---
My main speech I wanted to give you, is that I would actually tell you not to have a main in ranked. 
---
I‚Äôm the support/flex player for my competitive team. I‚Äôm usually on thatcher/therm/lesion/bandit/kaid. However site to site, map to map, its more fun to figure out what ops are best for each site/map. Example: on kafe when I‚Äôm attacking and I know the defenders are going 3F Bar, 75% of teams don‚Äôt reinforce top of red. So I choose Buck, because I can open the hatch, and open the whole wall and walk right into piano. 
---
I obviously stick to team needs, but with that being said, you never know what your team will need, or what op isn‚Äôt being chosen that can counter the other team. 
---
As for casual, literally just have fun and don‚Äôt over think it. I‚Äôm a bosg acog main in casual now.
---
its just my opinion that fortnite sucks you can play what you want ;) dont be so toxic XD
---
Stop giving me nightmares. It's only 8 am here!
---
I go back and watch that from time to time. Really gets the emotions going
---
Blitz shield now has an acog, allowing him to more consistently flash defender. To balance it out we have removed his hand gun.
---
Battlefields engine was optimized better, sieve is very poorly optimized even on pc, drawing most resources from the Processor rather than the GPU. The frostbite engine is one hell of a machine, every wonder why far cry 5 never looked good? The engine is held together by popsicle sticks
---
Fair enough, you‚Äôre absolutely right about that.
---
I meant good guns, but it still stands. They would have all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù guns
---
Bois on r/R6ProLeague would like this.
---
Too distracting and confusing. Too much stuff to look at at once
---
Yeah somebody please delete him.
---
[you mean like csgo where the skins blended in so well](https://youtu.be/ALtFCxPGVC4) where the skins are [banned in most competitive tournaments](https://afkgaming.com/articles/csgo/News/2851-New-Character-Model-Skins-Banned-by-ESEA-ESL-and-FACEIT)
---
Where are you?!
---
Ow what the f**k? Took me a while to really find the outline.
---
I guess I got nothing to argue that, but I would at least like them to give us the option to change it even a little, even if it causes small fps drops, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try and put it in the game just to see the player bases opinion on it
---
Hibana o nana
---
Yeah gonna get it now
---
Yeah once again I‚Äôm not against it, I‚Äôm just annoyed that if they do add it people will be complaining that it crashes their game and they would beg to have their mmr returned for the matches they lost due to crashes
---
Oi I was gonna say this
---
Why are u so cunty?
---
Are we all just going to forget Mrs. Pauling?
---
.\_.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with it
---
Looks Great!
---
You valuable drone
---
Luv you too mate happy sieging
---
"Always stay away from them or you will lose you valuable drone"
---
I've seen this done with another game.
---
yeah you‚Äôre pretty good then
---
did they make it to 100 operators too?
---
They should add this in the game and btw the outbreak charm looks good, too bad I don't have it
---
Now that is a real man if I‚Äôve ever seen one!
---
Is it me or do none of the legendary skins compare to black ice.
---
This gun is in black ops 4
---
No
---
add gaussian blur on map background will great, every match will not be the same on pick menu
---
Fair enough
---
mozzie needs 5 pests
---
You should put a glass panel on the top. Make it look like a Mira window.
---
Year 5 should start March 10.
---
Same..cant play ranked with randoms
---
That could be pretty sweet. Unfortunately I don't own the tools to pull it off correctly.
---
It's enough to make a grown man cry...
---
ahhhh eeeee ahhhh
---
you made it?
---
can we have an inventory system?
---
NO STOP FUCK THIS FUCK NOO BABY YODA OH JESUS WHAT KIND OF CRUEL JOKE IS THIS!???
---
I knew this first day the map came out because me and my friends play hide n seek way too much on house.
---
Its based off a .338 Lapua with a sled Styre Polypropalene stock I know im late to the conversation hope this helps
---
No my mom doesn't wake me so so gently if I'm late. She literally screams like castle or twitch getting shot, times 10.
---
This is from BO4, it‚Äôs an amazing skin but definitely trademarked
---
No matter what people say rainbow six siege will be the best fps shooter for me.......hackers and toxicity is there in every game but even with it .......siege is fun .I can't really think of any other game that can replace this for me
---
yeah people in this sub think spawnpeeks are OP and un counterable and hate them with a burning passion because they are too lazy to watch for them or listen for windows breaking
---
Ironically I think this would make a great pc desktop where the desktop shortcuts would be the place of the operators' icons.
---
Or place a claymore at the run out spots not hard at all to counter
---
I have been a blitz and montange main from the start and there have been many big problems and it seems that ubisoft don't care about shield ops
---
I have seen no fix of the problem and the ads time change mad them almost defence less
---
Now make one where emperor bandit deep fries her.
---
I have such a hard time playing blitz, everytime I play him the enemies zero in on my shoulder and kill me in a few seconds. Anytime the enemies play him its like hes a mini monty and I can't hit him for shit.
---
i probably just suck lol

Hello nileslucas, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e8mezo/clash_glitch_on_accident_if_there_is_sound_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What I wanna do to myself during finals week
---
Ya mate
---
Very cool art design!
---
That‚Äôs why you alt-f4 before you to anyone then come back. It won‚Äôt count as you killing them since you left, so you can just come back. Does it make it right of course not, but this could allow you to not get banned. Secondly send the clip the Ubisoft customer support let them handle it, this is a well known issue in the community, it takes time to fix things in a game, the devs aren‚Äôt perfect
---
Yes.
---
What show? I took a little break from R6 after Halloween so I completely missed this "event"
---
This was the beta design for the blackeye
---
Yeah. The DLC have trailers on YouTube
---
It's the same for me, it's a tiny spot but with the lack of skills I miss
---
It was a joke homie, gold 2, 34 47 50
---
Scout is Maverick, because he's also 3 speed and he's from Boston.
---
I choose to not reinforce the wall
---
Hol‚Äô up
---
Propably patched due to some balancing shit.
---
They were literally the best maps
---
Did you miss the part where I said I was over level 200 lol. This isn't for me. It's a way to guarantee this games player count.
---
got any blueprints for me to see the full view?
---
Is castle seriously in issue to this day? I play him a lot and really I don‚Äôt see why people think about reworking him
---
Don't be afraid to shoot through random walls around the objective. 
---
When you're in a 1vX stay calm, enemies get greedy specially if you're on defending. 
---
I know some people might say to not get greedy with kills but let me tell you, if you're on like low tier, individual plays matter. Maybe if you're silver-gold/in a 5 stack then you can worry about anchoring. 
---
Try being good on the most hated maps, oregon, skyscraper, tower, you never know when time will come that you'll need to play it. 
---
My play style is focused around being hyper play? I guess? So you might not find this one tip useful. Always go above/below the objective if you can. Example: Oregon. If the obj is on second floor then go basement, they usually don't expect someone there. Unless you're on consulate or anything with a garage. Always go through the garage if possible. 
---
On defending, I really love to be an asshole. Not particularly roaming but it's somewhere close. I usually support the roamer as valk/tachanka/mute/smoke. Mute is for the drones, valk for drones, tachanka cause I like tachanka, smoke is just fun all around. 
---
Expect the unexpected. 
---
Also when you spawn in, instantly look for the cam, then aim at the window. Any window, doesn't matter. You have a high chance of being spawn peeked on lower ranks
---
You are speaking the language of gods.
---
What feature I would like is to have the ability to auto equip a charm on all my guns. Putting my end of season charm on my ops can become a slog
---
why tf he smoking a candy cane
---
What are you deaf or something? He said pick up the can shit head
---
Thanks to the people who pointed out that they win in a trade. Is this new? I‚Äôve been playing since launch and I‚Äôve never seen this before.
---
A really big fucking coming right up.
---
Try out r/siegeacademy and check out Varsity Gaming's Siege school (link below) it's a little old but the concepts remain the same. If you have any questions feel free to DM me, I'm mid high plat with a lot of time played :)

14 year olds when they find out a rapper died that they have never heard of.
---
they definitely need to add folder/filter for each rank of charms.
---
I thought it would be funny
---
goal accomplished
---
isn't there a charm you can buy for 1 renown
---
Guarantee the game's player count? Uhhhh dude, still, 20 dollars is like literally nothing for a game, whereas things like Modern Warfare is literally like 60-100 dollars
---
JoJo Stand
---
not JoJo Stance.
---
This skin would be shot down by Activision so fast lol
---
I never fear Cav in ranked... I fear my teammates when there is a Cav in ranked....
---
maybe dim or whiten the background a little, otherwise it's just too distracting and hard to see, but if you dull the colors, now you're on to something
---
Is that a triple barrel break shotgun?
---
Dual Wield was in MW2 too
---
If we are talking about double wall, yes. 
---
If we are talking about triple wall, you don't reinforce next to someone. Reinforce one by them that is 
---
000
---
teammate 1 reinforces first two and you get the third one .
---
never reinforce second one,  for him run time is 1-2 sec longer which for ops like kapkan or mozzie can mean using their gadget just a bit better (setting up with mozzie is painful enough so every second matters)
---
Taste the rainbow in a very different way
---
Make him shorter
---
you'll get used to it once you try it a little bit, same energy for breaching the wall in coastline(pool room), create a vault square gap, sprint and vault.
---
Never played r6 before (only watched youtube vids) but looks like a really cool trick
---
Mozzie should be S H O R T
---
Ok but actually tho it looks awesome
---
It's a game called gmod
---
What metal are you using? Things super cool but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs gonna be tiring holding and running with a shield.
---
Also not free but pretty cheap when it's on discount and it's on discount pretty often
---
Nope
---
Oh I would never of thought people are nice I don't think people would sarcastically say stuff like that becuase Its rude but thank you again
---
2/10, too tall. Jk üòÇ
---
Thanks
---
It says metal zinc plated, everbilt
---
30 in x 26 ga x 24 in
---
jackal is 2/2
---
God dammit
---
This is some r/cursedimages stuff right here
---
Why do that if you can panic. Shoot at the shield. Wander away from plant and turn your back and reload. What could go wrong?
---
Ppl who ban new ops have a smol pp
---
that‚Äôs why i was thinking more to the leave the characters in the game so leaving has no effect on if they die or not
---
If you don't hide under it like a kapkan main, do you even play r6s ?
---
Who is she and where is the real Valk.
---
Sorry! I've been rhere and itis the only way to get better you need to try harf and play all day
---
I just got off the game because we encountered one just like this. Our team called him out and he started to be the most toxic uneducated thing that has ever walked this planet. We all reported but we damn well know ubi dosnt do anything.
---
Sadly i was recording the whole day BUT the time he 1 taps 3 players trough walls without hesitation
---
He was mounted and loaded when no one else was.
---
PC Siege is a very different style of game to the console version. It‚Äôs much faster paced and requires a lot more attention and focus on playing well and improving. I would say being placed just 1 below your console rank on PC is bad going, clearly have a sense on how the game is played but you will need to adapt the quickness required for pc play in both movement and aim. Spend some time in THunt and mess around with you mouse dpi and send to find a good balance to help find your aim and standard movement with MnK.
---
After that, just keep playing and be patient as work on the higher ranks.
---
As the new season has recently started, you‚Äôll get a lot of players come back in who play the start of a season and then never again until the new season drops so it can be frustrating but keep at it and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll reach your desired rank in no time.
---
Also, find a dedicated group to play with, this can be friends or other like minded players through reddit, r6 discord etc... the team play this game offers especially when coordinating is super fun!
---
Hope this helps.
---
If you have to say "xyz is a real politican," xyz is more likely then not NOT a real politician.

I've heard some people are being banned for using kb&amp;m on ps4 but not sure about xbox
---
Pretty sure you and the other idiots that downvoted are blind. OP is showing elas gun. You are showing a bo4 smg.
---
No, you can DDoS the server IP and then yeah that would take down the server or you could DDoS someone's home IP
---
And it's always been punishable by law

You can't edit titles though.
---
5v5
---
4v5

3v5
---
2v5
---
1v5, friendly last operator standing
---
See, I feel like one hit headshots (althought some are totally lucky/bs/what have you and everyone can screech about those) are one thing that give me mega confidence during 1vX situations. That great equalizer that as long as I play well, capitalize on enemy mistakes, that one tap headshot means something. But I can see why people don't like it.
---
Oh my bad
---
Playing Sledge with a shotgun is always impressive!
---
All jokes aside, it's very good you understand verticality in this game, it's a huge part of it. You'll probably get killed hundreds of times the same way, good tip for newcomers is to watch the kill cams!
---
Welcome to Siege, good luck and have fun!
---
Do it. Flex on them bitches. You won't. No balls.
---
No sir, only one button. "Report for cheating/hacking"
---
If only you were level 420 instead of 40
---
You have any sources for this or just rumors? Highly highly doubt it.
---
To be fair the ONLY situations where them dipping on the death even means anything is when cav is in play. Then it's obnoxious and all that, but I wouldn't count on any solutions actually coming to fruition.
---
Fuck man are you blind? They are clearly different guns, just with the same skin. 
---
That's what OP is saying and he's right
---
So sad üò•
---
Badass. I like it
---
I've said it before but I could hold an angle for a day and a half and guaran-goddamn-te that at 12:01 on that second day I'm getting one tapped.
---
But the skin looks exactly like the bo4 skin
---
Sorry to hear that ü•∫
---
Every gun requires accuracy. She needs significant sway or something when shes moving while scoped its too easy to abuse the movement in this game.
---
How df do u see them from there
---
Seriously? I had no clue that was already available! Thank you man, you just made my day :D
---
What is that ginormous black eye on the bottom right wtf
---
Recorded no
---
/(&gt;~&lt;)\

No problem mate

Is this old? They took out night versions of maps a few seasons ago I think
---
Black eye is YUGE

That's so stupid

Yes, after the finka boost is gone though.

Rainbow 666 Siege

How's it like getting 1000+ duplicates ?

But what about my smurf? :(

Hello ShisuisLeftEye, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e8p8q4/new_clash_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Once I get it done I'd be happy to pull measurements for you. üòÅ
---
As for the top, we planned to treat it like a regular siege barrier, just sideways. I picked up some strapping to run along the front edge to complete the look.
---
The current issue is that the game loads in all charms when you open the page. By initially only loading the categories this could theoretically make it faster to load in.
---
I have much rarer things to flex. I'm surprised nobody noticed the charm flex yet.
---
Thanks!
---
Merde chalet.
---
People like visual things. It's easier to see than to imagine.

Tbh I still hate Theme Park even after the rework üòê

Thanks, I'm really fortunate to have it :)
---
Oh so you‚Äôre approaching me twitch?!

This is the approach I'd take, even if they DC it's tough luck at that point.

How can the one button both be walk as well as slow walk? I'm confused
---
Lol, gotta love the cameras they build into phones where they aren't the priority. Thank you üòÅ It's starting to look like a desk and less like the jumble of components in my head.

Damn this is good.

It's not though.

Well strange Kali players are always at the top for me I guess beacuse your likely a lower rank that‚Äôs why
---
What are you doing?
---
Ok cool but hey if you ever think about doing commissioned builds let me know
---
Irdk what happened i've tried re-installing uplay, I also disabled ipv6, still this shows.
---
Is that for one specific sever or all of them
---
i use a 502 hero
---
personally i like having lean on my top thumb buttons, PTT on the thumb resting button lower down and drone scan and melee on the ones next to the left click.
---
i use the DPI button as default dpi set to only one dpi amount so it can't change from that, coz this button is awkard as hell to reach for me.
---
as for the scroll side click, i think i have those unbound, they are too twitchy and tend to scroll up and or down at the same time with my big fingers.
---
but I've been told that people both love and hate this kinda setup... so whatever floats your boat i guess?
---
Lower rank? On unranked/casual?
---
About a week.
---
I'm sorry "doodle"? My doodles are stick men!
---
Maybe until February when the invitationals happen but i don't know exactly
---
So a week from now they‚Äôll be removed and new ones will be brought in?
---
Tesla has entered the chat
---
Should be yes. New pl always comes two weeks after new season launch.
---
Reminds me of a cartoon, like ben10 kinda style almost
---
imagine how satisfying it would be to get the kill as well
---
Mozzies way shorter
---
Btw I know this is kind of off topic but i was wondering if anyone knows when the Christmas event ( if there is one) would happen
---
We aren‚Äôt talking about unranked or cas
---
Appreciate the drawing üòÇüòÇ
---
It's certainly the platform you'd roll out on first. Their servers their console...
---
I doubt thee will be an event. Just skins and challenges. Could be wrong though.

For how long?

The seasonal skins don't work on any new weapons introduced after the season they came out in
---
They stopped doing them... something about an argument between them
---
Maybe the 20th? Just based of other games.
---
Because it‚Äôs a new gun from a different season

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

* This also includes video macros.

* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.

* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.

Yeah whenever I play against shields I go to knife them and they start doing the animation, where their shield goes to their side, but then they just stop and knife me back. I've been telling people about it for months but it seems nobody gives a fuck.

It's only for DX12 and Vulkan.

No, I really hate the sound of blitz break through a door and rushing to me

i even thought it was fixed after i reinstalled uplay, some say its a server problem

Saying you should compete at a decent level before doing ranked defeats the purpose of lower elo tiers.

Now i just wanna know what it was made of. OP still hasn‚Äôt responded if they know.

And they say siege isn‚Äôt a horror game
---
It doesnt change anything to 30 lvl. They dont even know the ops enough. Unranked is enough. 
---
People get restrict to play ranked in every game based on level because of game wise. 30 lvl is not enough for this game, nothing changes for new players
---
as a fellow console player (xbox), I know how shitty casual is, like every single retarded person in the whole world is queueing for casual, but with the addition of unranked, toxicity has went down by quite a lot, at least for me, but as a recruit main i can definetly see why you play casual instead of unranked

I'm sorry, my Thatcher elite and AR33 would like a talk

---
That extra idea is more because defenders could potentially decide to guard and save the DBNO for their Cav player and additionally it is an additional punishment for those that are leaving to avoid the chance of an interrogation whether she downed him or not.
---
Keeping in mind none of my idea would do anything if a match plays out normally without people leaving while specifically DBNO which is most matches and also my idea is purely to try and promote more normal matches which wouldn't see any of these effects.

If only the friends I convince to play could play like this when they are new

They said it was impossible. They said it was designed for missile silos. They said that I could not make it smaller and more viable. They were wrong.
---
2 and 1/2 months isn‚Äôt a grind lmao
---
I feel that'd be a great addition to the game.
---
that's a very generic stance, you often see it in every few drawings, even when I draw I occasionally use this stance, its called JoJo Stance because you don't see it very often and while it look weird, its also cool in a way.
---
Homie is in creative mode
---
Battleye is a separate program that detects hacks and macros. Since those don't really exist on console Battleye also doesnt. I think 99% of the bans I see on PC are Battleye bans. 
---
We also don't know how much freedom has of banning people on these platforms, can Ubi ban players or do their contracts with Sony/Microsoft limit them in when they can ban players? 
---
A LOT of the toxicity bans on PC are likely based on text chat, which is easy to analyze with programs and then review manually for bans. On console they have to rely on 1000's of reports and that's much harder to process well. 
---
What do you want to see people banned for on console? I can only think of toxicity personally
---
Do it! Just do it!
---
He means like for when both a headshot and penetration happen
---
op thought the guy meant stance despite the guy referring to Stand. its just a misunderstanding.
---
Probably just a regular steel sheet...I guess it weighs about 12-16 kg (27-35 pounds)

He looks like a Foot Ninja from the original TMNT comic, that style is legit.

I love the idea of being able to play a game mode similar to pro League. The only reason I dislike playing it in customs is because it feels like wasted time in a way. I feel like you could showcase top 5 stacks for this sort of mode as it could show where you place in your region as a 5 stack and would operate as a second type of ranking system.

too be fair how "chill" you find unranked is purely on you. i know people that take any game mode fairly seriously regardless. myself included.
---
the amount of times i get verbally attacked by teammates and enemies alike for being too "try-harding" is insane. why do we have this culture on these games where anyone playing it the way its meant to be played is seen as a negative. surely it should be the other way round.
---
Sadly no content is carried over.
---
I do have to agree with you that it feels as though the console player base, which Ubisoft themselves have stated to be larger, is substantially overlooked. A recent example is elas' shotgun which has been a terror on console since its release, but due to it being fine on PC it's taken over 2 years to fix.
---
Thats a shame.

Nice of you to try and teach them something.

You do know that that was a concept on this sub, don't you?

it's trainings

You think even if they made it slow fire rate like the scar h and gave it a huge amount of recoil? I‚Äôm basically saying make it like the Scar H, hard hitting slow rof, obviously tone down damage too
---
Use easiest gun and operator?! Ok
---
Damn it really is a shifting tide
---
And would you look at that? People hate what they don't understand, so they upvote trash and downvote logic.

Typical.

Then it should be avaliable for anyone and for free. Otherwite it's a P2W mechanic.

If it is a training why are they killing each other ?

I have never wanted anything this much in my entire life.

?
---
Read his bio
---
Too much work considering each bullet creates a new holes
---
Tbf it's more of an occasion in CSGO whereas penetration kills are so common place in siege. Especially if you're a ratty player like me. Genuinely about 50% of my kills are penetration kills. I never fight fairly because I'd lose
---
They were doing placement games, that's how. You should know because you did them too. Every season.

Security and break?

Operator loading screens put me to nowadays. Shame because it used to look so nice with the blurred map &amp; CTU logos behind the operators.

Yeah BB is still fundamentally broken. That gun is a guaranteed 3 shot on all armours.

In it's current state, and on dok's current state, any buff would be insane. Plus, mk14 I'd a 2 shot. That's worse.

L85s have a horrible reputation due to the A1 varient. The first one. The A2 was actually a decent rifle and fixed a ton of the horrible issues in the A1. Problem though, is it could never escape the A1 hate. If you notice sledge's rifle name is the L85A2. Thankfully because if he had the A1 he might accidentally drop the mag or worse lmao.

I also used to complain about things like that, but siege is not meant to be a ‚Äûrealistic‚Äú game anyway, so its kind of pointless.

I think she is in a good spot as is. Very powerful on a lot of maps.

Yeah! Sorry, I totally forgot of putting a pic.

Well she says if something runs on batteries she can see them and players usualy have a holographic wich runs on batteries they all also have phones too so why cant she see those either
---
Whats the weight?
---
But she should be stronger it only makes sense that her scanner can see those things
---
Pulse has wallhacks
---
Even if we make it better, people will still use the K1A and MK14 over it. There‚Äôs no point in buffing the BOSG because people will always use Vigil and Dokk‚Äôs other primaries.
---
Yeah that's true. It's strange though because even if you wait 10 minutes for all the charm to load and then scroll through the list, it is still super low frames
---
Kind meh'd about the top of the six being cut-off, but will still wear it.
---
Yea but it does make sense
---
Looks like the "For Scale" charm and "Plasma Pink" skin. Both are from alpha packs.
---
She can see phones when the enemy team is using them and I think the holo sight detection would be too op
---
But the holo sight makes sense it runs on batteries
---
Doubt they were actually looking, probably just figdeting.

Imagine how scared he had to have been, seeing a crouching, creepy swamp lady slowly moving towards you.

But then people would just not use holo
---
But you aren‚Äôt then effectively throwing when picking the BOSG. Shotguns in general are nearly always less viable than a full auto weapon yet when a shotguns viable (Cough Cough Ela) then it gets nerfed. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference between usable and throw in my opinion. If it‚Äôs more viable, more ops down the line can have it and the more it‚Äôs used and impacts rounds.

Allways the same in his videos. Oneshot with pistol, wallbang, dropshot, random kills, etc.

I see where you're coming at here but I think that vigils current kit is perfect other than some small changes here and there. Implementing a whole knew change to the BOSG although I would like it, as i use vigil a lot, just is unhealthy for an operator with such a great gadget.

Because your comment is directly contradicted by the video, in which it shows being able to vault up there as being a big deal to be used as a quick rotate around the enemy team. This is ideal if you only have one c4, or if you don't want to give away the element of surprise by using an impact to open the cafe wall first which is loud. Not to mention this is faster if you get it down which saves precious seconds when the defuser is down. So it is a big deal. So shut the fuck up

Here Here. Although I'm more of a Mute main but on attack it's Thatcher.
---
Black ice is everything best skin in the game
---
It's really just preference, I'd just try out both in t-hunt until you decide which you like better
---
Most of the time the speed makes the operator playable think how much lower ashes pick rate would be with generally mediocre guns and no acog on the r4 c that‚Äôs just one example and it‚Äôs a very similar circumstance for the other 3 speeds
---
Imagining Yoda with an Australian accent is surprisingly difficult
---
makes sense
---
no, you listen here buckaroo, you absolute fucking disgrace of a Maverick main, peeking melee holes in reinforced bandit/kaid/mute walls I will have you know that I *despise* any and all Maverick mains, especially if their Xbox name is RadiantTaxes.

No fucking idea, I'm amazed at how they managed to do this o.O

That's what I thought. Scurry on back to your hidey hole. One day you'll value you the lesson I taught you here, but that day is not today.

I receive those exact messages all the time

Dude, do you have fucking parkinson?

Idk

Bruh you sound like a fake roadman

yooo dude im also gonna make a workin blitz shield. the leds are gonna be costy tho
---
What the fuck...
---
Oof
---
Listen here you filthy, wretched recruit main, if you cant afford an operator you dont even deserve to be talking to me. I'll have you know that I have Gucci black ice on every gun in the game, I have every op in the game, and if you DARE insult me I will tell my uncle who works at xbox to ban you from this game for life you little ploopy
---
welp

Part 3 pls I need yozzie and recruit to have a lightsaber duel
---
Low key I actually hid part 1 because I kept seeing it and getting depressed. This is just what I needed to see to get through dead week.

REpost
---
It isn't really that big of a deal.  I have 118 AP's currently with just bit shy of 700k renown. Once I hit million I predict that my APs are somewhere 125-130 and with 1mill renown I can buy 250 more.   
---
If you just buy long ass renown booster and do 1 hour of Thunt grind per day you would rake ~300k per month.
---
Hey buddy I thought you were leaving??

Nice recovery.

Wait this can't be accurate, I played Tower last night on Quickmatch. And I have yet to see Hereford on Quickmatch.. not sure what to make of this. Their website is either wrong or they have yet to update the playlist.

Part 3 pulse shoots Mozzie through the wall. Sad recruit continues.

NO.

not a repost but IK its been done before thats why I ironically flared it creative
---
M870* and I agree
---
thank you~
---
It literally mentions on the blog article that this giveaway is to have a chance to get this skin before it's release, but who reads stuff amiright.
---
thanks!
---
I don't understand...  
---
You say
---
&gt; [This video](http://static2.ubi.com/pxm/RainbowSix/MJS/Victim.mp4) linked in the blog above clearly shows that there is clearly SOME advantage when peeking with a higher ping 
---
And then you clearly state 
---
&gt; **Required reaction time = Peeker's Reaction time - your ping** 
---
Which in no way, shape, or form involves the ping of the peeker. Which is exactly true, by the way. Peeker's advantage exists, and has absolutely nothing to do with the ping of the peeker.
---
But as you clearly say here 
---
&gt; minus my 40 ping means I need to have a reaction time of 160ms or less to win that encounter which is lower than the [average reaction time of humans](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/statistics) 
---
So imagine your ping was 400ms, as in that video. You would need a reaction time in the negatives. And that doesn't actually mean prefiring, since you can only hit your target once he is visible to you, and if you have 400 ping and the peeker is visible to you, you are already dead.
---
Here's one of the only [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JaCcsmjYM8) that actually explains, in detail, the equation for peeker's advantage.
---
No its called adhs

Flairs aren‚Äôt meant to be used ironically.

You need an update it looks like. That's the only solution as you are missing game files. If there is no update available uninstall and redownload

I am absolutely CRACKING up at how dead wrong you were about the clip. So embarrassing

Just leave man. Leave before you get yourself hurt.

But if i move my camera while trying to knife someone won't it has a larger attack zone so a easier kill ...
---
Are you always this confused about everything or is this just a schtick you like to do?
---
I‚Äôm not lying. I just understand that it‚Äôs a part of the game.
---
Are you threatening me because you're behind a screen? "Before you get hurt" like what the fuck. It's a 20 second clip. You're not better than anyone over this, so maybe stop acting like you are
---
I think you're small-time buddy. Simple.
---
ok I take back what I said.
---
I was expecting rampage
---
This is so much better
---
‚ÄúKaid wtf‚Äù lmfao

Can you pls stop with these post it makes me depressed that I‚Äôll get a good legendary alpha pack
---
Nope, the device appears on the other side too. Don‚Äôt ask me how this is possible without leaving a hole.
---
I'm a console player and can confirm this. If I got a dollar every time I died because of how bad the controls feel, I'd have enough to buy a PC that could run Siege.
---
Are you ok?
---
Nice.
---
La Llorana be creepin'

Yeah ignore the guy who can throw around handheld EMP‚Äôs, the guy who can heal all your wounds instantly with one shot of medicine, and the guy who can stuff 4 car batteries in his back pocket. Those guys never happened.

You can literally go back and then click the check mark so it all goes back to normal, ur a fucking idiot
---
Are you ill
---
Bank has literally 1-2 spawnpeeks per spawn location, it's not that hard to remember them and counter them. It really isn't that bad compared to some maps where you have to watch multiple windows/angles at once.
---
Not new, but sweet none the less.
---
Um it‚Äôs been out for a long time
---
Shitty Thermite too
---
Kaid should never be able to trick a Thermite if done correctly.
---
Just tried to play a few rounds TH, had this map four times in a row.
---
I already knew that,you twat.
---
It takes time to do it every time I play siege and switch to another game,which happens constantly.

Who wants to tell them?

No it‚Äôs not

If fuze gets black ice shield. I'd bust a nut.

You know thunt maps are entirely selectable.

TIL people don't map filter on Thunt and they play it in ways other than solo.

Why is the case still on

Does the match show in your history and did you lose LP?

I thought it was actually in game dang

How do I check that actually??

You were hitting her chest and then moved your sight up so it was on her head but you died before shooting her

U can make it so ur accesibility on ur menu screen like ur music is so you can jus click it from there stop crying
---
Totally on point.
---
Go on your profile -&gt; match history. If this game you were playing doesn‚Äôt show there after a server crash (what should be the case), the game counts as never existing. Then you shouldn‚Äôt have lost any LP. And I just thought you‚Äôd know, how much you had before that game. Many keep track of that
---
&gt;Too complicated a solution for the problem.
---
How is that complicated ?
---
This solution also could benefit in ranked.
---
If you leave, you character stays where he was, so if you come back soon enough, you'll have a chance to finish the round. It could even randomly pick an operator if you haven't rejoined during pick phase, and make him spawn.
---
Bro bralette university was one of the very first maps.... it is the map for article 5 aswell.
---
Indeed. I especially enjoy the randomized order where seasonal ranked charms are scattered throughout the list willy nilly.
---
Yeah your right, its kinda similar machanically
---
Yes it is for multiplayer and you can opt it out for terrorist hunt.

He was the second most banned attacker behind jackal

Is it weird i say both?
---
Camera there wouldn‚Äôt be too useful anyway. Probably was considered in dev.
---
Oh what? That fucking preview video confused me. It‚Äôs really uncommon in my experience to find counters to bandit, kaid, mute using their stuff at times and positions you can do things to stop the gadget itself. Weird way to set that gadget as destructible in a manner it‚Äôs not going to be acted on much. At least it‚Äôs relatively easy to deal with
---
Casual has its own rank-system but you don't get to see it. At one point, some players start messing around in casual rather than playing seriously which means they lose and therefore their casual "rank" decreases. Then they end up going against newcomers even though they are more experienced.
---
What? I also main Nokk and the only reason she‚Äôs kind of meh is because her primary sucks

For a casual gamer, 60 hours is a long time

Yes...and I said why that matters still in the last few sentences of my post.... I actually call you out that youd say this exact thing lmao so thanks for that laugh.

You say the graphic wasnt real enough.
---
You say its just a game when I pointed out it is a real graphic and there are good reasons it's used.

You don‚Äôt seem like an aggressive player then so I can see how you don‚Äôt take advantage of it

Is the Yoda just mozzie with ears stuck on his helmet painted green and a blanket on
---
Of course you can but I think it would also be good for people who join ongoing games and get put in a lobby just before the new round starts. They are assigned a certain operator, maybe they don't like the current loadout but they have no chance to change it. Happened to me some times because I choose different loadouts for certain ops depending on the map.
---
where? he had a insanely low pick rate BEFORE the nerf [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-352473-16/y4s23-designers-notes](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-352473-16/y4s23-designers-notes)
---
Yeah why don‚Äôt they show before operation health ?
---
As a Puerto Rican, can confirm.
---
One of his comics iq shot recruit's baby yoda doll thinking it's an enemy gadget and a comic before that i think since mozzie is the shortest op in the game sau siege made a baby yoda version of mozzie. So in this iq is apologizing for shooting recruit's doll so she gave him a baby yoda version of mozzie.
