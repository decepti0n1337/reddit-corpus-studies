Ahhh yes, enslaved red and white blood cells

Mute is very good. Warden and Nokk have no effect but very limited situations. With the ddosing at higher ranks and the ops having no effect on gameplay this is basically Operation Health 2.
---
Finka is crying alone somewhere
---
An SG rush with twitch is also hella fun
---
I would think twice whether should i step the mat
---
I always do that when there's 1 or 2 left. That or pistols only if it's 5 v 3. 90% of the time there's one idiot who's against it or someone who just starts shooting with their normal gun like a twat.
---
Probably during season reveal on the 18th
---
Real mutes run the MP5-K. Real prophets run the MP5-K with iron sights!
---
Valk, she needs her fourth cam again
---
They didn‚Äôt see it
---
OP find and LFG and it'll take a while but you will find decent people to play with regularly. I've came across a couple girls on siege so far and they've said the same thing as you, if xbox casual is anything to go by the R6 community has a lot of growing up to do..
---
ok do you understand how game sharing works? You are sharing whatever content you have in your account with another person. Therefore since you have year 4 pass on your account who ever you game share with with also have year 4 pass. If you buy year 3 pass on your account who ever you are game sharing with also have year 3 pass. But if you buy a fresh new game of siege you will not have year 3 or 4 pass which you have bought.Right now you are only sharing your own library therefore you have the same content on your other accounts.
---
She has a high pick rate because of r/iwannafucktwitch
---
That is very cool and very specific tricking for one spot. Thank you!
---
Based solely on weapon I would say they are about even. I like lesion because his SMG has a good amount of damage but I also like Mozzie because both of his guns are good and he has a cool reload animation (I can't stop looking at it). It basically comes down to who's ability you like best.
---
It‚Äôs as if you don‚Äôt see it
---
Love it
---
[removed]
---
Is noone gonna care that the gun won't even fucking function because there is no trigger?
---
Idk, I mean yeah the F2 is the best gun in the game, but her drone is also very clutch.
---
Thanks
---
You know it.
---
Chiefs, I just had the worst game of my life, could I join?
---
We got trapped in a 5v4 once (leaver not ubi) the enemy team decided to take turns tking to a 4v4 when they could've taken a game slanted in their favor, shootout to those guys
---
No problem I did the same thing but I wasnt bothered so I just didnt pursue it any further.
---
That frame rate looks like you're playing on a console.
---
Alright, thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions! I think I'm choosing Mozzie :)!
---
Ooooooooooppeeeeeerrrraaaaaaaaattiiiooon hheaaaaaaaaallllllllltttth
---
The moment I finally saw the mute elite I bought it. Started to play him. absolutely love him. One of my mains on defense now.
---
Maverick or lesion
---
Not mute, he's super versatile with shotgun and smg-11 along with a nitro. Deny both intel and the plant, whilst being a close quarters terror to the enemy.
---

---
Warden - Give him the P90 with the ACOG and clash's machine pistol instead of the smg-12. Hess still be weaker than the majority of defenders, but he's at least firefight-reliable now.
---
N√∏kk I'm aware this operator is underpowered, but she is the sort of operator that would be super frustrating to play against (much like blitz) if she was of a viable power level. Make her gadget last longer, maybe give her a slightly better smg such as the mpx or mp7 (or just more variety, even if the weaker smgs, such as frosts or castles smg).
---
They're the only operators I would increase the power level of tbh. Other operators like cav/fuze are on the weak side, but would be super frustrating to play against if more powerful, particularly with random teammates (this is very much the case of what happenned with blitz). Some like gridlock are weak in most situations, but because they shine in others that makes up for it.
---
There is literally a reason I said to do it on the NEXT GEN. I'm not trying to solve MnK on Ps4 or Xbox one. I'm wanting a way for Ps5, next gen Xbox, and PC to play together without the PC players having the advantage. And with talks of backwards compatibility and what not, Controller players on Ps5 and new Xbox can play with players on Ps4 on Xbox one, with the wonders of Input based matchmaking. There is no good solution for MnK on ps4 and Xbox one, because even if it supported native MnK there's already the guys that have Adaptors.
---
Shot and run with drone
---
No problem! Sorry for the late responses, I was busy with something :)
---
Speak this into existence
---
Of course, what are you trying to say tho?
---
There is nothing more satisfying than killing a spawnpeeker imo
---
Jump over it
---
What is there to get triggered about you and frost had a wonderful dance
---
dude thats fuckin gas. I would buy that skin in the game and in real life.
---
I really want to do that in ranked.
---
Thomas the shield engine
---
Ok u right
---
Sledge, thatcher, thermite, ash (attack) and rook, doc, mute (defence) are all very good for new players. Simple gadgets, reliable guns. Try to be second in the building behind a teammate. Watch how more experienced players move between cover or clear angles. If your aim is good, the further back from an angle the better (due to perspective). Learn the counters to your gadget (avoid mute jammers and bandit charges as thermite, etc). Aiming and motion/positioning will come with practice, aim with Thunt, motion/positioning will only be learnt in multiplayer, and takes much longer to get right.

Now that's a funny one, hoss.
---
I love how he realized what was going on in that split-second, enough to turn and look again
---
I‚Äôve never seen GoT but my idea was basically yours but with more of the black ice texture.
---
They won't. Because in all seriousness, even at higher ranks, as admitted by most players, doc doesn't bring much other than his stim. It's headshot meta, after all, and juice doesn't heal headshots (and shouldn't).
---
Nokk when she tracked down Maverick

At least he‚Äôs actually using a controller on Xbox

I can't believe in 2019 this shit still goes on. Mind you I'm an old man so maybe I don't understand

If people are going to be obnoxious dickheads in ranked then yes.

this is satisfying

How do you get it
---
I dig
---
Cav's pistol is ez game for that. Not saying that was easy to do, but it could of made it easier for you.
---
Weird flex mate but alright
---
The general idea was too look more like someone used the butt of the gun to bash an attacker.
---
Yeah don't waste your money then haha
---
Ah. Might be it. We‚Äôre even on the same wifi

That is fucking sweet.

Well you don't normally want to bring items that look like they could detonate explosives out in public.

best way to prevent this kid spamning would be by reporting his "fuck you" message.

I only hope, this gun is like a G36 made for combat in mexico its actually hella cool

Shotguns all the time. No exceptions.

The devs cant really force the plays into moving slow. Even if they make off the operators 1 speed the meta will change back into its fastest possible state since the players know all the maps, lines of sight, common rotations and roaming areas. Its just the meta changes. 
---
* Originally it was the slow entry since all the players were new.
---
* Then it became the Rush spawn meta. 
---
* Then it became the rush into the site meta 
---
* Then it was the trap meta to counter the rush meta.
---
* That changed into the roaming meta rather that was countered.
---
* Then Lion dokk blitz meta became the anti roam meta. 
---
* Now its the Intel vs Info Denial meta. (echo, valk, maestro vs IQ zofia, twitch)
---
Fuck dudeeee what level are you!? And what's next on the list?
---
I just play casual anymore. Tries ranked for a bit last year and didnt like it due to bugs and hacks. I stick stick to casual(PC). At this rate im not sure they will have it together for a while. DDOS is going ro be more of a microsoft mitigation or they need to check architecture if their Azure environment. More than likely a microsoft thing.
---
i‚Äôd cop nvm it‚Äôs pretty hot üôà
---
Ah okay, i forgot how this worked, my bad
---
Rip i will always remeba u
---
Yeah I‚Äôd be perfectly fine with that
---
Probably a 4 stack that just doesn‚Äôt want or trust randoms.
---
I am level 231 but I stopped playing for a few seasons and lost all my skill :(   Next would probably be mute but I‚Äôd have to check
---
Why tho? Im not familiar with the "bot"
---
How on God's green fucking earth is having a bigger shield with glass for line of sight while being behind cover ever be considered a nerf.
---
Mean while. All I ever see in this situation is the other team "oh ez win"
---
Um, you're a god though my guy
---
No stop I beg you
---
flair?
---
they can‚Äôt do new weapons because of data limits and engine limitations. same with new maps. on top of that, they can‚Äôt pick and choose any guns they want. they need licensing to use weapons and they can‚Äôt always get it. they even said themselves they‚Äôre running out of guns they can get licensing for.
---
That‚Äôs not a Barretta .45
---
Imagine they had a collaboration where he replaced recruit and he only had pencils in his loadout
---
When you are holding a place which literally no one saw you in, and a drone (which the user didn't even see you with) happens to give away your position because the game decides that apparently they could see you with pinpoint accuracy, you quickly realise that the ping system is stupid. Automated scanning is stupid.

I mean. I don‚Äôt like having my kills stolen either.

I cant even imagine, i mean just going to speak in siege and instantly regretting time and time again, i mean i had to deal with being called *sqeeker* for a bit then. But that stopped and anyways they dont harrass you if your sqeek mostly mute tho. But iv heard plently of gals speak online in siege and instantly people who have not talked nor given callouts all game become arse holes and call people hoes. Its annyoing to see and i worst to feel im sure, all i can say is look for a 17 and up community that has strict-ish admins you can trust to keep sheit clean. Gl

I found a few helmets really resembling his on Ebay.  They are old vintage motocross helmets.  I'm trying to find his pants and it is a massive pain.   The pants and the helmet are proving the hardest to find.  Specially the pants.  It sucks because I'm the same build and height as mozzie and my girlfriend is the same height and build as Gridlock so we are wanting to go as a pair but it is becoming unfortunately difficult.

Most of the time what seems like ddosing is just a server issue, there is still a good amount of ddosing mostly in Asian servers and even if ubi  could easily fix it they can‚Äôt fix it all that easy beacuse they don‚Äôt even own the servers people play on the use a third party. Interesting thing if you do indeed get ddosed remember that the us government uses the same servers that we use well the same company not the same servers so report your fellow man if your in the United States or a un country
---
Nice
---
The only thing I was thinking of was "get your freaking armor" (Rook main)
---
a little column A, a little column B
---
Well, in no disrespect to your statement/ argument, my team knows that it was a ddoser as it came back up with 20 seconds left in the round and once we killed one of their guys, everyone lagged again until 2 seconds when it came back up and our guys all got shot from different angles.
---
also I have a video of me calling the alpha pack but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt wanna hear my voice..
---
It's kinda annoying too
---
That was fixed but i guess they kept the chat rules just in case someone found another similar bug.
---
Pure truth

Petition to rename her ‚ÄúF2 and also a drone or something‚Äù

someone is mad cuz bad

Stop leaving games

Dudes sweating hard after that

I leave when the match is over

Oerfect - this is dumb cant he just edit it
---
Wait that's illegal
---
How to win at siege: 
---
Step one: pick twitch 
---
Step two: don‚Äôt use your shock drone on gadgets, why help you team when you can zap every enemy once and be sure you end the round with at least a few assists, which count almost as much as kills anyway?
---
Step 3: rush with the F2.       
---
Step four: get MVP EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. 
---
(Optional) step 5: play maestro, also zap all the enemies for extra assist point that you don‚Äôt deserve!
---
There's also payday 2 so
---
Facts. Like I don‚Äôt get annoyed by any of those ops. It‚Äôs a mental game for people and I guess they feel they will always have the advantage to get rid of these ops when in reality that simply ain‚Äôt the case.

Hello COMileHigh, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cmmn0g/skin_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If you are just going to die quickly, get Mozzie. His spiders will just trap drones and your squad won't miss your death.
---
Kaid is needed for Kaid tricking hatches. Lesion gets more useful the longer he survives as his special recharges.
---
TLDR: if you don't know what you are doing, get Valkyrie if nobody else picks her - she can be deadly in the hands of a skilled player as you will have intel on where the attackers are.
---
Mira is among the most banned operators in Siege now. If you don't know what you are doing - and don't invest the time to learn proper placements for all the OBJs on all maps, don't pick her and get your squad killed.
---
They changed that. You no longer start only with recruit
---
Maybe, usually for that they leave right away, they got afk kicked at the same time... I dunno, it just sucks
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure why he is complaining. I guess he saw the gold but even then it‚Äôs gold 1 so he probably isn‚Äôt too far from play himself
---
Yep happens to me today
---
I think you should just be able to call timeouts like CSGO does

Haha, you are fun

Only if Nokk gets that Galil back. Otherwise I guess no new gun for this season.

yea dude just use the link
---
They changed the standard version to give all the original ops. He missed it i guess. The season pass gives you every dlc op that season as that come out. You get access 1 week earlier than non pass holders. It also gives you a slight renown boost, a universal skin, and a few r6 credits. I suggest getting either deluxe or gold. Gold would be for season pass if you really want to get into the game but deluxe if you want to play it but don't care for the bonuses
---
the only reason i don‚Äôt really use thermote is beachside he‚Äôs needed throughout the whole game and i usually just ‚Äúrush‚Äù to get early frags for my team.
---
No they changed it back to where you only start with recruit at the start of year 4.
---
This and the ability to cancel reloads after completely removing the magazine are two of my biggest issues with the game.
---
Yesss
---
You need to put it in the comments
---
I was watching a Drawfee episode on my side monitor, because who cares about casual, until I saw someone reinforce.
---
i‚Äôm not a new player i‚Äôm just trying to find the right operator i‚Äôm level 159 and i‚Äôm at that point in the game where i need to find the select few operators i need to get good with to rank up

New operator: earthquake, but it affects all parties
---
I got wall banged through a concrete wall and in villa I was kaid and a shot a blitz in the back with my shotgun like 3 feet away and it didn't work so i thought it just didn't register then he ran away and headshoted me without aiming 15 feet away I thought lucky shot then next defense same thing happens shot him in the back a few times 20 25 feet or so away and he immediately turned around and headshoted me without aiming and he killed 2 other people all headshots
---
If those are the MnK players on Xbox these days, then we're all safe

?
---
I was so curious about this but was afraid to say anything because I thought it‚Äôd be a ‚Äústupid‚Äù
---
Question. You know how Reddit is.
---
for most ops who have angled grips i use them with a holo
---
Imagine if CS has a penalty because you left a casual D2 lobby. Almost every fps game has a casual mode would be kinda crazy if you were to leave and get a penalty.
---
It‚Äôs the year ones none of the bases at least that‚Äôs the way it was for me
---
Capitao's lmg is powerful but he's still trash. A good gun doesn't make "the most powerful operator." Additionally, the perk of Kaid's gadget is far too situational, if useful at all. Why waste a spot with Kaid when you can just use bandit, who is more useful, more often. Your next will be, "But muh hatches!" Counter point, most competent players will reinforce the hatches and either have a roamer or a valk with an eye on them. Most competent attackers also don't just mindlessly rush through a hatch. Why waste a spot with Kaid, when you can have any other breaching punisher.
---
Pick Up valk she is the easiest for beginners
---
For me sights on shotguns(excluding slug shotguns) are useless because aiming with shotguns don‚Äôt improve spread, so I always hipfire with them
---
Why?
---
&gt;If that‚Äôs your play style then you shouldn‚Äôt be playing doc or rook.
---
I play Bandit on defence and the holographic works great.
---
Bruh moments
---
I bet there is a bank alley spawn rush that was faster
---
Just get the one that gives you all operators from Seasons 1 to 3, whatever it is called.
---
The problem with Mira is the same problem with Valk, or Finka- idiots pick them and waste their gadget. They're not hard operators to pick up on, but unfortunately because enough make stupid plays, the rest of us who know what they're doing pay the price.
---
Where‚Äôs the finish with a C4 whenthr mag runs out?
---
&gt;They changed the standard version to give all the original ops. He missed it i guess.
---
I didnt miss anything, you missed the change. Either double check your info or stop making stuff up when you give out incorrect information to new players. 
---
[Directly from ubisoft where they explain the difference between the versions](https://support.ubi.com/en-AU/Faqs/000032916/Content-of-Rainbow-Six-Siege-Editions-R6S)

"** Legacy Operators will cost 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 Renown based on how many Operators from a specific CTU you have unlocked."

Lesion is arguably the best OP in the game. Get him.

Assuming you already have the vanilla ops, get Jackal. Two speed with a great gun and easy to use gadget

Yeah pretty sure I saw this like a week ago.

Oh you sweet Summer child

Yeah, except when people camp drone holes in casual...
---
Unrelated, but how did you set your flair?

Wow i'm being called out right now

How did you record this

You don't.

Jk take your time and click on heads

Gotcha ty man
---
What‚Äôs the video called I can‚Äôt find it
---
If you‚Äôre gonna go through the trouble of writing a paragraph, might as well explain something. Telling me to ‚Äúto take speech classes at my nearest vegan fine dining‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help. What do vegans even have to do with anything?
---
DRUGS
---
Yep that‚Äôs why I left console it wasn‚Äôt fair to the majority of players actually playing with the right controller type. That was 2 years ago now and I can only imagine it got worse
---
Ok?
---
wow you use drones?!?! so unique
---
Dropped into solo ranked the other night, something I rarely do but got paired with a four stack and they were great dudes, serious but fun.
---
Game was going okay, didn't notice anything strange until one of them started to complain about his mouse lagging. The other was blabbing away about how to fix it and I didn't say anything. Maybe I should have but instead I just spoke when I needed to.
---
We lost that game, I was top with my trusty controller and the four "sweats" went their own way.
---
Why do console players feel the need to use a M+K? Especially a four stack? Just crazy to me, are you that bad?
---
Exactly dude, you don't get it. I'm not gonna write a paragraph this time cause apparently you have something against paragraphs for some reason, but you just need to reopen you're freaking eyes dude. Can you read English? Can you write? If the answer is yes than you're already one step closer to figuring it out. I figured it out myself and so can you. Maybe get some help from someone in the comments bruh.
---
Thank you for letting your kitty nap üòå
---
Nah, Frostbites
---
This is what pisses me off on console I wish they did something at least..
---
&gt; I‚Äôm not gonna write a paragraph
---
You just did
---
&gt;you have something against paragraphs
---
When did i say that

&gt;maybe get some help from someone in the comments

‚ÄúMy goodness what an idea! How didn‚Äôt i think of that?‚Äù

Check audio, warm up flicks, laugh at dumbasses that walk in front of me like I wasnt shooting.
---
Let the meme die
---
we need more of those and less police ones
---
you're not supposed to have them
---
When I bought it on PS4 I had them all instantly
---
yeah, before. not anymore
---
Usually you can‚Äôt cover all exits on maps that are heavy on the runouts.
---
Usually there is variance with the angles they can get on you when running out.
---
Usually it‚Äôs with a 3 speed that can be extremely hard to take out. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôd want any drastic nerf, and it‚Äôs not a real issue that needs addressing but down the line something should happen. 
---
Defence already has a huge advantage over attackers, and this is just another benefit they have. Nerfing this effects nothing as it would still be possible, and I feel they can integrate this into an operator. Here are some easy changes ‚Äî&gt;
---
1- Reduced run out timer to 1 second before you get highlighted (down from 3 seconds)
---
2- Lion has a passive whereby run outs are instatagged and enemies have a full body outline (like Old Lion). This should come with a second rework of the operator (removing all intel, and focussing on disruption). 
---
Easy fix. Reduces impact of runouts while still making them possible and viable, if done right. I don‚Äôt see how this negatively effects the game in any way, and only benefits the game
---
Starter edition?
---
I think a reasonable change would be to limit it to 1 lean a sec. You can still lean a while lot but in those split second fights you wouldn't be able to spam it
---
I have voted him out... This is only casual if you loose such a round ok but to look wait there 5 mins, this is stupid. Secure Area is such a stupid game mode...
---
Thank you reading this I just realized I been rush and drone less than before, thank you again for this advice and time that you took to write this
---
As a Jackal main it's so stupid how he's getting banned almost all the time. I suck at attacking operators already and now I'm forced to play Maverick and Thatcher.
---
I bought it of cd keys so I don‚Äôt know
---
It‚Äôs incredible how many people hate them. I have played more with Blitz than any other op, by far. I think he‚Äôs fun to play. 
---
He‚Äôs also not good. I can honestly say from experience that in a completely even match, Blitz is a waste of a pick. His lack of gadget versatility with his flashes combined with his only decent shield make him only good for one thing: punishing bad players. That‚Äôs why I play Blitz, and why people hate him so much. He‚Äôs literally made only to punish bad players. He should be a free kill to any competent team because he‚Äôs so vulnerable with so little to give his own team. 
---
Same thing with Fuze. Thats honestly so ridiculously bad that it isn‚Äôt even worth arguing over. Anyone who thinks shield Fuze is more dangerous than literally anything else, including AK Fuze, is tripping. 
---
And then Monty. While he‚Äôs tougher to deal with, he‚Äôs also not an issue usually. I‚Äôm never like ‚Äúah crap, there‚Äôs a Monty, this is bad.‚Äù He‚Äôs a nuisance and nothing more. Monty players are easy to bait because they don‚Äôt expect you to ignore them. Try it. One time I had Monty right up on me while I was next to the defuser. Instead of giving him what he wanted I literally just plopped down and started breaking the defuser. He got excited, like they always do, and wasn‚Äôt quick enough to not catch bullets in the face the second the shield dropped. 
---
I got flamed for it the last time I said it in this sub but shield ops aren‚Äôt OP. In my opinion they are actually more of a risk than a reward, and have been in a good spot as far as balance goes. You get a shield, but are essentially a slow, sitting duck with low firepower and no long term protection against many strategies. I made a list of like 12 ways shields were weak and could be easily countered and people didn‚Äôt like it. All I have to say is that it speaks volumes about you if you think facing off against Blitz is anywhere near facing off against attackers like Blackbeard, Ash, or Jackal, who have kits that are much more advantageous in every scenario.
---
How much did you end up paying in total for it?
---
Np mate
---
:(
---
Pepega
---
lol if u put him in a game with me or other pc players he is the first one to get bodied he is not even good at the game
---
He talks about a hiding spot of his OP and get droned by enemy team not a hiding spot for his drone...
---
12 pounds
---
I always push for twitch or thatcher. Then defense is jager or bandit. Especially if you don‚Äôt ban last. The enemy team always panics and takes out echo, cav, or clash for you.
---
That would make it really frustating when trying to clear corners and in other situations
---
Do you have to be at the Major to get it? Or do you get a code with an expensive ticket or something?
---
I dont have a link but on something like r/interestingasfuck has a post showing troops that are identical to vigil.
---
Thanks!
---
Then it's prolly the starter edition, but getting the base operators is easy
---
Kindly refrain on suggesting massive changes to the game when you are new
---
You don‚Äôt.
---
Why is my phone buzzing? Plz help
---
And iron sights
---
He's such a balanced operator I think. I love him.
---
that makes me feel happy and sad the same time.
---
holy
---
That makes sense
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH TACHANKA MEMES FUNNY HAHAHA
---
So . OOOH . I wanna be like yoooooo . Talk like you . Walk like you , too
---
best skin concept i ever seen
---
only 90s kids remember
---
I think it looks really good but I also wouldn't mind if there was a variant like black ice but with blood on the barrel and dotted through it
---
Flash hider is better for bursting, compensator is good for spraying, and muzzle brake is good for single shots.
---
I agree with him getting his barbs back, but 3 claws, potentially letting him electrify 6 walls, would be broken. Even if you use 2 claws to electrify 3 walls, he can still use his 3rd to electrify 2 more walls. 
---
Also have to remember that twitch and Maverick can make short work of a bandit battery. Kaid has the ability to hide them.

Rook and thatcher.

Thank you my boi
---
better should have learned to read in that time.. duuuude
---
I suggest you finka bout it before deciding
---
Do you think there's a problem with the ranked mm system?
---
If your on about the office obj use castle and go to the room right at the top of the stairs. Put castles on the two windows closest to the door and then one on the door at the side of the windows. It prevents attackers from rappling at the spawn and getting shots through the windows. In general just don't go to that area of the building you'll most likely get picked off. Also use a bandit or a mute and reinforce the walls at the back of the objective and prevent them from blowing them up. Also blow up the wall with an impact to the room at the side for a rotation. Have a roamer like vigil and then thats it really just watch out for the roof windows where attackers can pick you off from.
---
Something you haven't managed to show is true.
---
Probably because it is getting more rampant now. Dealt with this on other games so it isn‚Äôt too shocking having to deal with losers who can‚Äôt win in their own. Good luck in Ranked!
---
Just because I used the word dude shouldn‚Äôt mean you have to be an asshole about it
---
Although it‚Äôs casual, and supposedly new players, so they most likely aren‚Äôt planning everything down to yin‚Äôs throwing a candela at that exact moment.

You can see more of the sites (including daycare assuming they blow the wall out), as well as down the hallway to the stairs coming up from the haunted/bathroom area if you only jump onto the falling down light fixtures. Your drone is less hidden this way, but has amazing line of sight.

Poor Chungas.
---
if i could do that on pubg üò™
---
Yeah. Bomb is by far the best mode and should be base mode for players who are new to learn the maps. With having 2 sites, you have to learn a lot more hence why it‚Äôs important.
---
no

Hope to finds some diamonds tonight night night

yeah, i've had some weird audio location issues before where behind me would be dead in front of me etc but nothing where the audio completely shuts off and then on constantly before.

Well, it seems it could get worse. I have xbox and for sometime I've thought of buying siege on xbox as most my frienda were on xbox but now I'm glad that i haven't bought it. All i can say is good luck
---

---
hmm
---
Swear I‚Äôve seen this before. Maybe not the paint but the concept is extremely familiar.
---
Yea these people live in lies and if something challenges them then they feel the need to put others down to bolster up their ego.
---
It's how it works, theyre nothing but negative people and feel that it is right and okay to hurt others feelings and fun.
---
Yea I know what you mean and that sucks because for the ones who don't do that shouldn't feel that way.
---
^ This :v
---
I've used that since the map was released. Can't believe people still don't know about it
---
Ur right about the point having fun with video games. Cheating takes away the fun of r6. An example is also casual, why is everyone so sweaty there? I personally play a lot ranked and casual to warm or have fun with friends or alone. But if I‚Äòm not clutching for example I‚Äòm getting vote kicked or teamkilled wtf.
---
They did before by blackbeard but then instead of giving him a better camo they made him barbie. Ubi is not good with camo choice.
---
Yeah I honestly never even knew that was a thing but I hope that doesn't happen anymore because that sounds really annoying. But yeah sounding like there are once play is very annoying
---
As I said, there's no official statement from Ubisoft but fact is that matchmaking changed for a lot of people at that time.
---
Where‚Äôs the trigger
---
How ? He was given credit at the top of the screen just through something was funny so I shared it with others don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with that
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Lmao ok
---
Yep! I‚Äôve used it since right after release. It‚Äôs amazing, but I never see people use it so I figured I‚Äôd throw this out there. üëçüèº
---
Is he still a worthwhile op to get after the patch?
---
Casual is the new ranked and ranked is casual its been that way for awhile. All the Smurfs go to level up accounts and people who hit diamond go play casual. It's dumb but that's just how it is unfortunately
---
You can‚Äôt transfer sadly
---
I bet you like the taste of your own shit
---
Ps4 silver xD
---
You really did ruin his fun
---
You‚Äôre first shot hit the left shoulder and the recoil took your next two above his head
---
1. You should be aiming down sights
---
2. Even though you lined up you feet with the prisma on your screen doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs lined up on anyone else‚Äôs
---
&gt; You‚Äôre asking people who treat casual as a warm up game mode to play casual more so the people who mostly play casual can finally play balanced matches? So basically, you can‚Äôt fix it.
---
I don't see that there's a problem with the system as much as the system doesn't have enough information yet.
---
I don‚Äôt see it
---
Mav is my favorite. Partly because I like the basic US Army Special Forces gear and the Solid Snake headband but really because the blowtorch is by far the biggest mindfuck gadget when it works. Guys stop banning Mav pre-game please üò•
---
This would be so unfair lol
---
Ahh probably should have analysed it more before posting, thanks for explaining it kindly
---
Is that considered assisted team killing.
---
Console FOV is a hell of a drug
---
it sounds like you're talking about casual matches, i was referring to ranked matches
---
Hopper was a US Army Vietnam vet, so this is basically Stranger Things Season 3.
---
You autistic ps4 players cant get higher than silver lol
---
Holographic Centipede
---
I like skyscraper but 3 times would be annoying. If if wasn‚Äôt in ranked I‚Äôd jump out the third match I was put there
---
Just someone putting spaces on the end of their text so it wraps
---
He's American lol
---
If you're playing in casual and they bring thatcher, they almost never coordinate enough to stop bandit-tricking though
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure. In UPlay I believe they have a comparison chart for editions. Also, it‚Äôs very likely to be a free weekend on the 16-18 during the major. They usually put the game and all editions on sale. So if your willing to wait I‚Äôd hold off for two weeks.
---
It was in the top community concerns.
---
Nah, compensator is used for horizontal recoil so you're good.
---
Do you not play ranked than?
---
From going to level 190-210, I gained around 150k renown. He has probably bought all the operators and still had this after
---
editions got changed since 12th of Feb this year dude
---
all attachments are free on the guns, I think they got rid of the trap that was the 15$ version of the game that made you work extra hard for the base ops, the only thing you spend money on is dlc ops and cosmetics for guns and ops
---
A lot of things are taken into consideration here. Example, hit reg has a long and confusing history in siege. Lately i found it out to be great (er) but sometimes you may miss a shot that looks like a headshot. Hitboxes are weird and the bottom of the head may be confused with the neck so you think it's a headshot but it's not
---
It's been on a youtube video for well over a year. IceyCat maybe? Definitely not new
---
That‚Äôs kinda lame ):
---
Thats the thing, i dont see anyone else typing before it a couple times
---
theres like for version of r6s ranging from 20 to 100 bucks. which one is the starter edition?

You might wanna slap an acog and flash hider/compensator on that mp5
---
this took 14 slaves to make
---
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. honestly i wasn't caring much about that change so i forgot xd
---
Usually if we get 2 of the same maps in a row we just get it over with then go on Apex or something. As long as they make it where you can't play the same map again for 4 maps then it will be fine.
---
He may be better, but it's more fun to play aggressively with Twitch or an entry fragger.  In general, people don't play support ops nearly as much in casual and those they do tend to be faster ops with better guns--Twitch, Hibana, Capitao.  Slower playing ops like Thatcher, Thermite and Gridlock get less play.
---
I know but you aced and then lost
---
look i‚Äôve been playing since February and i‚Äôm level 110 something, I play this game like a craxkhead and i‚Äôve gotten my fair share of commons
---
It‚Äôs not that subjective, they both have great utility and can do important jobs no other operators can, and are often banned in Pro League matches because of how strong they are on certain sites. You could make the argument they are bad picks on certain sites, but you can say the same about Mira.
---
Loll
---
Loads of spaces?
---
Spare change?
---
The best in terms of controlling recoil is vertical and flash hider. Removing sights doesn't actually improve recoil control, it just appears that way. So you're probably better off using holo/reflex
---
I dont have him yet
---
Well. You could change your profile a little bit. So they won't notice. I know that sucks but theres no other way dealing with retards. And you could also use voice chat and claim that you are a little boy xD.
---
Mozzi  vigil.  Lishon 
---
Jackal. Nomad. Zofia
---
Yeah defo
---
Try 5 stacking or get an eu friend NA servers are more toxic than a hospital in Chernobyl it‚Äôs just shitty 15-20 year old virgin neckbeards with there friends that have nothing better to do I imagine it‚Äôs not like any other community though there absolutely everywhere
---
Look at this link and figure out on your own. https://support.ubi.com/en-US/faqs/000032916/Content-of-Rainbow-Six-Siege-Editions-R6S
---
Would recommend deluxe or gold if you want. Not the ultimate.
---
MAVERICK IS WORTHY
---
Offense is Buck and Blackbeard defense is Rook and Doc
---
I am level 80 on xbox and gold 2 and frequently play casual, and I never find mouse and keyboard players, maybe it's an NA thing?
---
Well if you want to play it but know this game is not like any other in my opinion there is a large learning curve and the community can be toxic somthimes but if you like it buy it
---
I heard it was grappling hook and a shield with a type of explosive (oh good more shields :///)
---
ew blitz... i mean yeah great. I mainly play Ash in attack and a little of others. On defense i play Jager, Bandit, Vigil... any 3 speed honestly
---
The only time I‚Äôve seen that is if someone puts spaces in their message so it makes a new line for your message to look legit, but as you said, sometimes the only thing in chat is your message, so idk.
---
They all basically play the same, apart from shields, so I play everyone.
---
Because toxicity is key, I guess.
---
I honestly go with the digital deluxe edition cause i play on console and it was only 14 dollars and its going great and u should at least use some money to buy operators that are good but for stearters like jackal and the australian biker

Don‚Äôt blame you sadly. Very hard game to play without friends. I‚Äôve been solo queuing ranked for years on PlayStation, but casual is so toxic lately.
---
Average age is much lower
---
Yeah thanks and good luck to you too and it sure looks that it is getting more wide spread  knew a little about it from dota 2 but it was still extremely rare and mostly Just tournament's where there was money on the line!
---
Just close the game and restart it its a visual glitch
---
whenever we bum rush I can flex üòé
---
You won't take damage from it, but you still get the red triangle
---
Is that a problem though?
---
Personally, I think there's some appeal in confusion and chaos. Siege is very much a game of intel and playing off what your enemies don't know is both beneficial and fun. It's ok to not know all things all the time and it's exciting to have some unknowns thrown into the mix every now and then.
---
Hell yeah, if recruits could have skins that'd be lit
---
Yeah but i'm just begginer and i made a little mistake and they tk me. I saw they do this with evrybody else.
---
I don‚Äôt think we have answers for any of these. Just speculation. I doubt a dev will comment on any of these.
---
Just going to put this out there, we all need to remember not all ‚Äòsqueakers‚Äô are toxic or be made fun of. As I am considered a squeaker and it doesn‚Äôt always relate to age, it relates to height and as a guy who is 5‚Äô2‚Äù I get made fun of my voice and get kicked for it. So I know there are the toxic squeakers, but give them a second to prove they aren‚Äôt a 13 year old.
---
Wait I thought I already replied to this, but I know I have potato aim. I just know literally everyone has this happen to them and thought it was funny.
---
All of them are annoying to go against, cav and blitz are very personal bans tho as they honestly aren‚Äôt used as much as would be expected from the frequency of bans.
---
The plug in breaks anything uPlay related on my machine. Yet it seems to work for others. I know there are a lot of crashing issues.

I know I have lost ranks because of this dumbass washer machine glitch and shield glitching
---
Mute sufferd to much and decided to hang himself
---
I think you have to melee it
---
You can buy the ultimate edition bundled with the year 4 pass which will get you all the current ops and access to the 4 new ops coming this year
---
Damn dude I just thought it was funny
---
Still, there's no point even having pick and ban. May aswell remove those 4 from ranked and remove pick and ban. Its just boring when it's the exact same 4 operators who aren't even overpowered being banned every round

On an account where I only have Vigil unlocked, I use IQ and Twitch on attack and only Vigil on defend. Might buy Hibana when I decide to stop leaving ranked games on the final round to derank and actually earn renown.
---
In that case I would rather have a Maestro. He can screw with attacker and destroy gadgets.
---
Sorry, i thought i deleted this, i looked in to this and i found out its not, my apologies
---
Custom flair.
---
Honestly ubi has a pretty good track record with picking weapons out but if it came down to personal preference I would be handing out DMRs to everyone. 
---
Shotguns are quite nice on attack if your capable with a pistol/ SMG on the side.
---
I like the idea of a burst only rifle as long as it came with a single fire option. 
---
Perhaps make him russian and give him access to the Saiga and Ak12. The Saiga has been proven to work on attack with Finka and the Ak12 is balanced on a 1 speed like fuze.
---
It literally misses tho
---
It‚Äôs free real estate
---
TIL, cheers!
---
Also your elo is Gain/Loss is predetermined at the beginning of every match no matter if you dropped a donut or if you got 20 kills you will get the same gain/loss that‚Äôs decided based on your rank and the other ranks in the match
---
how do u get that
---
I main Thermite and Hibana, but I also like Twitch. I feel like I need a hard breacher cause without one it‚Äôs hard to attack maybe. I know on some maps hard breachers are not super necessary but I feel safer with one. On defense I main Kapkan and Lesion. Right now I try out smoke, I bought him a while ago but never really played him
---
Clash was a mistake
---
Offense is Hibana. I will usually switch it up a lot to keep my skills polished with other ops.  Defense is Rook or Frost lately.  I use a lot of Ops situationally as well.
---
right he‚Äôs very good, but easy to spot and easy to counter. sledge, maverick, grenades, twitch, thatcher, etc. are just some of the few who can destroy the gadget. whereas echo is hard to spot meaning his only counters would be thatcher and iq
---
Nice thanks
---
Get a squad of 5 and it's much better
---
Isn't this a clip from one of Marley's videos OP??
---
Name bro pls
---
I don‚Äôt know if I like this. My hand would get too cold while playing.
---
Why would you remove 4 operators because they are a common ban? It makes no sense as bans are usually map based it‚Äôs only the few like jackal who is just annoying that is banned on most but there are still those few games where jackal isn‚Äôt banned
---
When I drone, I scan every Prisma I see, unless I see the Alibi is stupid and using cosmetics, but it's easier to scan than look for an angled grip or something
---
Wow, that's exactly right, I made a post about the DDOS and mnk the other day, it's infuriating and makes me not want to play the game, I don't mind losing but if I lose because of a mnk on console or someone DDOS the server to win or to avoid the loss it's just tedious and ruins my whole experience
---
WTF ubi ?!
---
Has theme park even been out for two years?
---
Ash and Doc, though I‚Äôve spent less and less time with Ash after her ACOG got removed.
---
This task a grueling one
---
Especially a glaz that shoots ankles
---
As long as I can put it on the smg11 I'll be happy.
---
I mean, I didn't know an exchange of ideas means an arugment? I'm not saying everyone needs to be boring and identical but I am not opposed to character models more accurately representing their respective CTUs.
---
Siege at its core is about adapting. What do you do if they reinforce a wall and you don't have a hard breacher? You adapt. Same goes for Intel. If you don't know where people are or who people are, you have to adapt.

I had Valkyrie and Lesion do this to me on a casual match I just ran around trying to get away for two minutes with them chasing get until the two other people on my team got all of the other team, and finished the match I then got voted out of the match, although since it was casual I just found it funny.

Well, that could be a case of the wrong crowd getting a hold of it. Unfortunately you'll run into dickheads everywhere in life, especially on the internet. A lot more people seem to be open to a Serbian operator in this sub.

he's not flashy so people don't play him. he's one of the strongest attackers in the game tho.

He‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm sick of seeing this and people posting about playing against plays queued with coppers. It‚Äôs being worked on.
---
Because it was set up
---
I used smg 11 in a custom and there was no range no matter how far no matter if they have rook armor a headshot was a oneshot
---
Yes.  He can take out breach denial devices, destroy lesion mines for a last second push, and has decent guns.
---
It's called mavs head gear
---
More
---
This is beautiful
---
Yes with all the abilities in the game he counters a lot when you play him you help the team alot 
---
His guns are great too and hes just a badass
---
you'd leave your back exposed. But I guess now I'm asking if monty's shield blocks explosive for teammates as well?
---
Amazingly done
---
Holo + flash on smg11, laser on shotty. Use the shotty to open up site as needed, then hold a stairwell or entry. 
---
Also learn how to burst fire the smg.
---
This charm has all the sauce man you are crazy
---
His first shots hit the bar and the rest are above and around the jager if you look closely
---
RECRUIT ELITE WHEN
---
Beautiful
---
He can stop maestro‚Äôs evil eyes
---
Yes he is very necessary depending on what site your attacking
---
Ps4 is hell
---
Mp5k +pistol...recommending shotgun is dumb cause it depends on what map your playing
---
xbox too
---
I think it‚Äôs little situational factors. Such as how you can kind of predict how gunplay will work in a space, jaeger will more than likely already be on the team and that‚Äôll counter the candelas a little unlike a blitz. A good blitz is more annoying than a good ying imo. Then there‚Äôs thinking of team‚Äôs comfort levels. Somebody may be more comfortable fighting full guns than a shield.
---
Still kind of toxic though. Are you implying you would have team killed him if he didn't accept it?
---
Sweet unique universal charm... or cool overrated weapon specific camo? Hmmmm

I learned to play in 2019 and I‚Äôm comfortable

Oh the joys of internet debates lol, you can disagree with me all you want to but the matchmaking‚Äôs been fucked all season. The devs need to fix it and I‚Äôm pointing out how obviously broken it is. Carry on my wayward keyboard warrior lol

You don‚Äôt get a grenade warning with fuze

Ight

It may be broken but you are overexagerating by miles. I play on console and consoles have had issues forever and never, have I ever had this bad of an issue which makes it almost impossible to imagine since I have played since day 1.

Ahh glad I searched before I made another post. I cant get on either on xbox

Look man Idk what the tally was before I left for Colorado last week, but the two days I‚Äôve played since I‚Äôve been back (bout 25-30 games worth) it‚Äôs been almost every game. Stop nit picking and get behind making the game better and more competitive üòé we‚Äôre on the same side here lol
---
Not as far as I know. Is it your Internet or are your friends having issues too? I was on ps4 this morning
---
Most of the time they are smurfing or underleveling and tend to be playing against like coppers and shit. Watch matimio, guaranteed quality content.
---
Amazing drawing and it looks like the man is sporting a red dot. Say no to sight discrimination

Yea my friend and I had a competition to see who can plat first and I got it like 5 min before he did, I got half way through the old trophy where you had to win 100 df thunts and then gave up cuz it was boring

---
They had a matchmaking like that before during operation health but they removed it because it took to long to get into matches
---
Yeah
---
I'd prefer the longer tee time if it meant I could play with and against people my level. There are millions of people playing this game and they seriously cant find 2 to fit in?
---
Dude how could you not love Bartlett and all of its *door*?
---
How has this only got to 300 likes?
---
Well if you have no preference or need for a defender over an attacker, and vice versa, then I‚Äôd go with Nomad. I feel like she‚Äôs more helpful on attack than Kaid is on defense
---
I would play red dot on that one shotgun, but it depends on the player as well
---
I agree.
---
Yea I'm having this issue
---
I managed to strain my back from arm aiming too much, now I have to wrist aim.
---
Feels bad man.
---
\*insert soviet national anthem\*

1 this is called communication you should have received a call out that there was a thermite beside u on a certain wall 2 NO this should not be a thing why would we want muffled drone cam noises if that‚Äôs what we are using there is no point. 3 find a safe spot to drone or use cams and there is your fix
---
And even though nobody asked, here's a swedish cover from 1980 by Vikingarna:

Yeah if you go to check Xbox live status (xbox.com/status) purchase, content usage , tv, music, video, and my games and apps services are down.
---
Are you new to the game? I wouldn't mind playing to help teach you if you are. The learning curve can be stupid annoying
---
Seems kind of sketchy, this for real?
---
People treat him as if he's a god on this subreddit, but most of the examples of his one taps or whatever are him killing random lvl 100's wandering around the map aimlessly.
---
I can understand both your points here, however what about on defence? As I said with the other Redditor, when you get thermited when you're sitting in cover on a reinforced wall and you can't hear it, it's super annoying to die to it.  Neither of the people who have defended it not being like that, have forgotten about cams. Defence is fun, but that happening is BS.
---
dont. laser sights are easily spotted at higher ranks.
---
I mean, I‚Äôve literally never played it before. I‚Äôve only seen vids.
---
Imagine, Friendly fire isn‚Äôt a thing, and look what happens.
---
Montagne will be stronger with teammates, with teammates safely pre-firing from behind monty.
---
People running into rooms being fuzed, pressuring defenders even more.
---
Attackers busting through thermite charges as they go off, getting the instant jump on the enemy regardless of how close they are to the explosion.
---
There are reasons why friendly fire exists in this game. If it‚Äôs removed, it will cause an imbalance in the game.
---
DO I smell another AnthonyPit Video
---
I understand that they want to make the games more competetive, but it takes away the fun aspect. Isn't that why we're even playing, to have fun?
---
My personal favorite out of the operators you mentioned is Valkyrie, but it's personal preference. Choose whichever one you like the most.
---
You say you like it, but you just stated another exaggerated reason why you don't like it. That's what the whole post is about, you not liking some youtubers content. I'm done though, I'll leave you to it.
---
Do you know why?
---
But why uncle Mute is poisoned too?
---
oh whats wrong with bartlett? 
---
everything.
---
Well if you want to play sometime or goof off my uplay is Importantly
---
yes, i just didn‚Äôt really know how to write the post lol. anyone that wants to join just has to go through a custom against me and play a ranked
---
I'm disappointed in you.
---
!remind me 1 days
---
thats only in t hunt, as in pvp casual
---
!remindme 1 days
---
Again, reinforced walls are practically the best "safe spots" and I'm saying muffled, not muted. So you can still hear the drone, but around you would hear normal. That seems fairly just.
---
Luck you I geuss?

These attackers were garbage.

Shotgun and smg11 or mp5k and smg11, depending on if you already have a smoke on your team.
---
I can agree to this. Having more ways to access the top floor and making some color differentiation with rooms and such would probably appeal to more people. Other then that I think the map is ok. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they took it out if they added those changes and brought it back later. The new one is my favorite map so I would hate for it to go away permanently since I know they spent a lot of time and effort into making the map more balanced.
---
It should just be some cardboard

I know, it's an attempt at humor, because there the gas. The "joke" is that of you get the gas out, it's fine again.

WHAT‚ÄôS THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL?

This is what i wanted to hear, i see how montagne would be op in that but about the thermite charge   could easily blocked by making team mates wait a bit 1sec lets say or they get hurt by the searing metal lets say 50 hp would be a bit of a nerf but it would stop attackers from hugging charges aoe kind of thing wouldn't be thermites fault if someone touches searing metal.

---
kinda fresh doe
---
Oh, thats like, 3 of my favorite attacking ops.
---
Zofias gun is super fun, and if you want to still be one of the most active fraggers in the team, she is a good choice, esp since she brings some good utility and her withstand feature can come in very clutch.
---
Dokki has a good tool to push and not instantly get peeked by a roamer, since you hear their location. The hacking of the enemy cameras is also extremely useful and pisses of Valkyrie, which is a huge plus. Her gun does good damage and has basically no recoil, but you are probably going to die to headshots if you aggressively push with it, since it is a DMR and single shot. It still can delete enemies
---
Gridlock is good in coordinated teams and/or in some maps. Like Dokki, she has smoke grenades, which is awesome utility, and she can close of common flank positions pretty effectively, allowing you to replace flankwatch. Her normal rifle is a headshot machine laser, but with bad damage, so you want to aim for the head, while her lmg is pretty controllable and has extremely effective suppressive fire. Awesome sight and decent dps make it a pretty well rounded gun.
---
So, it all depends on your playstyle. Active fraggers that want a bit of supportive power should go with Zofia, if you hold angles and hate roamers, Dokki it is, and if you tend to play more support and utility, Gridlock is a pretty good pick, esp in a coordinated team
---
Ehh idk usually it's either a 4 stack or people are just doing it to be mean. I ended up in one of those lobbies and got tk'd for not kicking the 5th person.

Xbox devs communicate with the game developers such as Ubisoft to resolve the issue on both sides and ensure everything is working. I assume by the time it's ironed out the page will be updated, as per usual.

Jackal is great. Amazing guns, great gadget if you know how to use it, waste of an operator in the hands of noobs.(they often die because of how they use it) but I'm not sure if you'll get use out of him in ranked.
