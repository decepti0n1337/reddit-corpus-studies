Hello, can you explain how it's working? How can they DDos big company server's? How they connect or know what to do? Should i be worried too? Cause if they can Ddos server they can hit individuals players. I just can't understand how you can Ddos something big like ubisoft

They all bullied him until they heard "LMG MOUNTED, AND LOADED"
---
PS4?
---
I mean it is slightly botched with me trying to make it slightly better
---
Cloggin the feed with garb gameplay once again :(
---
No one cares
---
Thanks!
---
Yup. Graduated in 2015.
---
you guys should force new people to play newcomer i've only been getting retards in casual  this day
---
Exactly why I refuse to ban leison. He's pretty nuts, but at least I don't have to deal with ash on site 6 seconds in.
---
Yes - same as ranked besides loss of mmr obviously
---
Definitely right at the end of last season. I couldn't get my aim right. Tried lowering and raising my sensitivity. Finally got it down, I changed my controller rotation option (PS4) from classic to updated and I've gotten my aim better now
---
Sorry i have disappointed you buddy
---
Because people don't know how networking works. Every single person who says something needs to be done about DDOSing doesn't even know how it works. If they did - they would realize that it's pretty futile effort. If someone could develop a way to get rid of DDOSing? They would be bill gates rich within a decade.
---
Nice
---
They're stressing the servers, no other game do I see servers stressed, ubisoft servers can be dealt with by a 14 year old with a computer and a program.

Hi guys can someone tell me how to fix the problem where there is a lock on the currency pack option in the r6 shop. I was expecting it to be fixed on ember rise but it still won‚Äôt let me buy currency packs.
---
"ayyyyy"
---
Thankyou that's great
---
S E A S O N  P A S S

---
You that new to the game, don‚Äôt worry about those two ops too much.
---
It would be better if you made the drone jump into your ass.
---
Or let them play in their respective ranks as they deserve? Or is ranked strictly for high skill players?
---
‚ÄúPlayed about 10 matches‚Äù...
---
10matches is by no mean a large enough sample to say something is worse lmao. 
---
Shields deserve a nerf, warden doesn‚Äôt need one, just like other operators he is situational still has a great load out.
---
Noticed the same thing during my last couple rounds, it may be a server side issue. Hopefully it'll get fixed.
---
People are stupid my man. However this update, they‚Äôre starting to ask more than usual lol.
---
As e
---
Sorry if this has been out I thought it just dropped
---
Only beta bitches complain about kill steals.
---
Well they shouldn't like it because it's a dead meme and painfully unfunny. I am in the "fandom" but most of it sucks. I fucking hate Fortnite and would rather play Tetris for the rest of my life than play that steaming pile of garbage.
---
I'm assuming that happened to you?
---
IF:( Revive - Invincibility = No)
---
If you‚Äôre that new to the game, don‚Äôt worry about the new ops too much.
---
Giving original ops elite skins &lt; giving dlcs ops elite skins
---
PS4 has had a glitch since the update came out that might be crashing your game. If you get crashes with a error message than its a glitch, not ddossing or anything else
---
It‚Äôs not if your it‚Äôs real fair and competive map if your having trouble with anything on this map you need serious help
---
Get a life you fucking virgin

Yo wtf I probably know you. My cousin Arika graduated with you lol

---
What is all this thing about twitch charms? Can somebody explain it to me
---
I‚Äôm sad they took smokes impacts
---
Placing gadgets feels really slow as well
---
Don't remember them but you probably do know me
---
virgin
---
You haven‚Äôt supported them from day one beacuse it‚Äôs always been one week after release that only season pass owners get them
---
Well you‚Äôre not getting em without the pass. It sounds like you‚Äôre new here. Maybe don‚Äôt get these two ops and get someone that can help you out. I recommend Frost or Blackbeard. Easy to use abilities and guns. And they‚Äôre cheap too.
---
I think they have one. But a t the beginning on the round
---
Our side
---
It's happened twice today in placement matches and i hate all of you who do this
---
Poor Mira
---
Then why don't they comment on this thread? I mean they don't have to go into specifics or solve this issue by tomorrow, but they certainly had the time to answer to a thread about pre-sets for weapon attachments instantly.
---
I noticed teammates footsteps were really loud but i don't play very stealthily so I didn't notice much else

---
Tbh they could get rid of the movement penalty and cooldown completely and he would still be under whelming. 
---
Needs an ACOG really to anchor, otherwise i think he needs reworking to be like Rook where he can hand the sunglasses out (maybe they have a single use on other ops).
---
One looks much more serious than the other, and the other has a bow.
---
Big disagree
---
Out of 6 rankeds in played today, amaru and goyo were banned in 6 of them. Fun part, it was me and a couple friends. No regrets.
---
Good Riddance lol
---
Very, very low. I thought I was the only redditor in the state
---
Lol
---
Asides that lmao it is a pretty good elite skin fits her character well
---
this isn't realism its a bug you know that but you want karma for sucking off a soulless company
---
I really wish they would've released a new map with ember rise. I would have loved to see a jungle themed map.
---
It‚Äôs still in custom matches. Tbh I rarely get house on casual anyways unfortunately.
---
Buck/Capital next please

If you subscribe to a Siege streamer on Twitch, you'll get their custom charm Ubi made for them.
---
They still have not fixed the audio issues, are you kidding me? What a joke. 3 new elite skins and yet they cannot fix fucking GUN SOUNDS?
---
I wish you could toggle this feature it is a tiny bit harder to get to where I want now
---
better than black ice
---
Vector is so good im glad that Goyo got it ,was feeling that was a waste to play Mira just for her gun
---
Hooool up... where's that cluster charge going...
---
chrome remote desktop?
---
I don‚Äôt see him anywhere
---
How did you find this it‚Äôs 98 days old jeez
---
You put a lot of effort into this, really good work. But there's a difference between DDoS and DoS, and I can guarantee that it isn't DDoSing that happens in these matches.
---
Also, I've only been playing Casual exclusively this season, on Xbox. And in maybe 5-10% of matches, we get DoSed too. There's no escaping it, it's ridiculous.
---
Pretty much
---
You have 3 months to get 50K renown, you could even play them on the test server... My rant is related as you want to play an operator in the first week that players can't counter, ignoring the pick and ban. Isnt that kinda p2w? Pick and ban is in the game so you can ban operators you don't want to play against.
---
Oh sweet, but how does it work, i mean ypu only subscribe and its done?
---
In old Kanal, there was a crate that, when shot, would play an audio track making it sound like someone was locked inside.
---
But with suppression?
---
Unless they changed it again, the shield break if you try to vault sideways. This is to stop people from shield glitching into spots that you shouldnt be allowed too.
---
I think just giving him MP5/P90 itself would put him in a perfect state. It would give him a same/similar role as Doc &amp; Rook but with more focus on countering instead of defensive (healing &amp; armor).
---
Isn‚Äôt it year 4
---
I get it
---
Not everyone hates those two really good guns you said.
---
Even with a suppressor you know its a glaz the second he shoots one bullet.
---
It's season 3
---
It makes you better at the game, right?
---
I dont play new ops for the first month. It's never worth it
---
The issue is, I like to play the game competitively, that's how I enjoy it and that's the reason for MMR is it incentivizes competitive play. When there's nothing on the line, it no longer becomes competitive and just a mess. I'm gonna keep playing Go4s, League Matches and Scrims but I don't have any for the upcoming week and I don't want to be drawn into the siren that is ranked
---
Lower ur res. A lot.
---
this
---
Angry response defending my position
---
The season we no longer really see them. 
---
Their pick/win rate was bottom tier already and with the new operators joining, these two are just going to be buried. 
---
Just gonna wait for Ubi to adjust them more once the pros are done.
---
Also use taa with sharpness at lowest and scaling. It will look like shit but it will run
---
It‚Äôs season 4 you idiot
---
You know what I meant season 3 .-.
---
Can someone please post this with the same caption but make it quiet until the end and put loud ass moaning
---
I recommend heading into ranked and getting your placements done asap and replacing casual with unranked, at least so far I've seen unranked players troll less and try hard more than casual (although maybe too early to tell).
---
Or go to r/R6STeams and find a squad that would welcome you and have your back while you learn the ropes.
---
It will be (somewhat) missed.
---
might‚Äôve been the game i was in. team where they did ban it. it was 3-2 in favor to ban amaru and goyo everytime. sorry, and if you are that person who went against us, very sorry and hope you enjoyed your win
---
What s the name of the pen you re using, please?
---
*Nokk's elite skin incoming*

Sounds like a seagull to me.

This is the reason.

Not CG trailers like the original ops and all the DLC ops after Ela.

I mean but I‚Äôve watch a couple stream and they get different maps every game. So is it just an Xbox thing then?
---
Its coming back as a standalone mode within Siege right? Not a LTE?
---
Whatever you say man. Yes yes, twitch hurt me, oh no. Keep being you. If you can't see the nain point of how good 980 firerate, then whatever. I gave my take, keep pulling things  irrelevant  from the main point.
---
Why not use a pistol to take out cams?
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Who‚Äôs standing where?
---
Yea I wish it was an option when I switched. Played Xbox since the game came out have lots of elite skins and older skins you can‚Äôt get anymore. All gone now
---
Play spin the bottle with my mom
---
So what is everyone‚Äôs thoughts on some of the casual maps getting removed? I personally feel like all the maps, even Bartlett, should be in casual.
---
How is smoke a Bartlett shooting survivor? Smoke was born in 1981 so he definitely isn't a Bartlett survivor considering the shooting takes place "now" so to speak.
---
Oh. 
---
*OH*
---
I don‚Äôt think so because they started trash talking over messages to bait me into joining their party when they tried to show off how l33t h4x0rs they were
---
Ok thanks :)
---
Oof. Well, good to know one of the ways to get banned by trolls, will avoid that instance now, thank you for sharing.
---
Yall clearly dont own firearms lol
---
Bruh I got copper lol
---
By adding 2 more seconds, That buff may as well not have happened because warden is still dogshit and the supposed "buff" did nothing.
---
Same here, it doesn't let me do challenge
---
Dem L E G S
---
Definitely Ubi's fault, not your team mates for leaving.
---
They said you should just report it to R6Fix as if I hadn‚Äôt done that already. Seems quite widespread, don‚Äôt seem to finish without someone getting booted out
---
I always ban Chanka. I refuse to fight the Lord.
---
Im gonna miss this map :(
---
Season pass is 30$. Buy that or wait 7 days for the ops to be available to the public. Unless you have the uplay+ season pass glitch. Then I can't help you
---
Vigil re-release I guess
---
Hi /u/BikiniBodhi
---
Wait, you can get vote kicked in unranked? And people are actually willing to get hit with an abandon penalty?
---
This makes me miss day one siege
---
And Kapkan EDDs, though both require you to down the hostage near the trap. And Bandit before they made it so electrified items didn't do damage to the hostage.
---
The game mode itself is hyper busted, and the only way for it to not be so is if Ubi makes it so the hostage cannot be damaged.
---
Weird. Maybe set it to 30fps and you will see the difference
---
Is it just me or does the game feel..... different? After the new update I played and the guns and recoil and aiming and everything in general just felt weird to me. I think I may be going crazy
---
Fuck off
---
There are already multiplayer game modes that don‚Äôt affect either stat (special game modes), so I imagine this will be the same

---
Yes I‚Äôm on the east coast but my buddy who is also isn‚Äôt having any issues.
---
You need to get a shower bruh, that was dirty
---
Kapkan.
---
Just the two new operators? If so, you have to have the seasons pass to access them right now. They will be available to everyone next week.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/MRwtOFx](https://imgur.com/a/MRwtOFx)
---
I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt have the season pass
---
This also could just be me noticing latency tbh. And not the fps lol. I was just curious if it was a known thing.
---
Is he located near you?
---
No.
---
I have a mouse key set to (numpad) enter. I've literally gotten to lazy to actually hover over menu items that i generally just drag my mouse near them and press enter on my mouse rather than actually clicking. This helps me be a lazy fuck.
---
Probably werent updated? Or the Operator screen... link it?
---
No they redid the sight pictures. The Scorpion still has no recoil diamond and is still the worst gun in game.
---
Blitz main. Lmao
---
Gone, reduced to atoms.
---
I love suppresors and silencers in every fps, even if it reduces damage I still love them.
---
The sounds of a silenced weapon are just so satisfying, especially pistols and the Spear.
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Y e s . . .
---
Thanks bro, will let you know the result soon!
---
Nah they had the ember rise opening screen/theme
---
They got rid of this map?
---
Shelbyville
---
You don‚Äôt need to buy them if you have the pass
---
Me too
---
Both me and the guy I killed need a shower.
---
Imagine being named gubbard. Lmao
---
It could possibly have to be something to do with the update if it started happening today.
---
What I meant was they could have chose guns the community would have prefered more
---
Like 270 R6 credits with the season pass VIP discount.
---
The shield nerf is frustrating :/
---
That surely isn't the case here, the go-boom shield was placed a dozen meters away. This mechanic just doesn't work.
---
Oh yeah I agree it looks terrible
---
Nice can‚Äôt even see the new ops.
---
Last night i booted the game just to see if this was still a thing, to my surprise I got in with a really good team against (you guessed it) Ddosers. We were putting a good fight until they got desperate as the win wasnt gonna be easy, one of the players in my team even messaged a person in the other team so they would team kill them, and they did for as long as they could, to that brave player I salute you sir!
---
Either way the match had a hard reset but left me with hope that people really dont like to cheat like that, well, not always at least
---
TL:DR: got ddosed, we were winning but in the end IT DIDNT EVEN MATTEEEER!
---
He‚Äôs about 2 and a half hours or so from me, same state, I‚Äôm further south. (Florida)
---
It now is a soft reset, so you start in a different place depending on where you ended the last season (or possibly your max rank last season)
---
Played my first game with him today. Was near a white grenade indicator which set off my trap and burned me alive. Stay far far away lol.
---
Put them in prison, like in americas army
---
But did you secure the dub that round?
---
I'm also in florida. Is spectrum your ISP? Im in central florida.
---
looks like i goddamn did it
---
Jackal is overpowered, N√∏kk is really weak against players who are aware, finka and Valkyrie are way better picks
---
Good riddance.
---
What's the Apple flavored soda given to frost supposed to represent?
---
Hey u/UbiNoty, thanks again for offering to help. I put in a support ticket and my Reference Number is 09733931. Just thought I'd let you know it cause it would probably help the support team get in contact with me. Thanks again for the assistance!

I think it‚Äôs possible, check if your manufacturer has a tool or program or something to do it. It could be a problem with the physical location where the game is stored but I don‚Äôt know

Last week i had this same experience killing each other at the same time
---
He‚Äôs probably drenched in salt rn.
---
What type of player are you? An entry fragger, support, etc? I personally don‚Äôt recommend choosing Nokk as yes she is underwhelming and Jackal just cause he is an instant-ban in ranked

You mean this

Isn‚Äôt this game supposed to be somewhat realistic? Welcome to realism. You cannot whip the shield and pistol around at the speed of light irl, so now the game reflects that. If you don‚Äôt like it, maybe pick a non cancer operator to main

The irony there lmao.
---
More like "what's it like playing with bellends"
---
Lucky :( he's been banned in the past few ranked I've played
---
If it helps at all, in pro league (from what I've seen) Mozzie has almost completely replaced Vigil.

Fuck skyscraper and the choke points. At least Hereford has good rotation options

Hes been picked in nearly every round of every match ive played so far lol

They most likely will, when Starter Edition was a thing I got it and refunded it after buying caviera because it wouldn't run on my computer, then a year later I got a new PC and bought the standard edition and I still had Caviera.

Yeah, if it continues to be a problem this season I‚Äôll be quitting the game as well. I usually reach Plat 1 (console) pretty regularly each season and without fail I run into at least a mouse &amp; keyboard user or someone who‚Äôs DDoSing every match. It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous at this point.
---
Anyone else not getting alpha pack chances after each round? I've been stuck on 2%.

No this is just joe. He works at kanal

It depends on your ping. The attack side is filled first so the better the ping you have and the faster you load in the better chance you'll be attack

If science means pulling two-ton pieces of metal out of your butt to reinforce a wall then it has gone too far.

Is not a fix is more of a feature that has to be removed. N Is true ubisoft dont give a shit about unbalanced gameplay. So we all have to just deal with it.
---
You can never play this game again.
---
Resorting to insults, that's disappointing.

I imagine the Rainbow Six team is working much harder than you or I to keep this game running and updated constantly. They simply can't afford to be lazy with the three month season schedule that they have.

I'm on PC and I'm getting the same issue, no renown won from challenges and daily, also no percentage added to the pack nor any animation to win the Alpha, it just says "Please wait, synchronizing data", restarted the game, same issue, nothing added, also did a verification of the integrity of the game files on Steam but the same happened after a round:
---
https://youtu.be/Bj3ZLnAxDvI
---
hinted? They get attacked by these same zombies and theres a guy getting affected with the same disease as the guy it the outbreak cinimatic. So yeah "hinted"
---
It‚Äôs a bug. No one in my group could collect on challenges and none of our alpha packs from wins showed up

Yeah, aight then ‚Äújerry‚Äù keep fantasizing over your video game women

I still dont like how they made hibana look depressed lol
---
That‚Äôs a negative there buckaroo
---
Im pretty sure they said they were making movements more realistic but it just feels slower and broken
---
Fucking finally something like this is getting front page of the sub. I stopped playing like I used to two seasons ago because of this. It fucking sucks.  Everytime I hop on recently I cant go even 3 matches without getting DDoS'd. I want to play the game more, and so do my friends, but it kills the fun when you cant even cash in your wins because some idiot on the other team cant handle a loss to their elo.

dont blame you. wouldnt do that either. if we only could get a moron to do it... somebody wanna get in contact with that coconutbrah?

miras new elite set looks great imo
---
Ubisoft is *WEAKI
---
Currently the shield will absoloutly not protect you, I think it wouldn't be so bad if I wasnt getting headshotted by crouched players I'm standing ahead of. He can be a threat but in my experience playing againt it, he is not hard to kill.
---
It's very refreshing not having to deal with shields as much this season since the nerf. I hate them all with a passion.
---
Amarus hitbox is smaller than ashs. Ive yet to see a headshot on her.
---
Wait a minute did they take hereford out of rainbow I haven't played for a while  What are they doing to this beautiful game it's been like 5 months since I haven't played what's going on what else has changed
---
they will learn, give them time, every player used to be like this
---
And adding the same guns to multiple op‚Äôs isnt any harder? One of the whole reasons Wardens still shit is because buffing his weapons would make other op‚Äôs OP
---
I can ≈õee that
---
1v1 me on Frogger
---
Remember when the China thing came up and everyone lost their shit. At the end they stopped that plan. It's a shame that the community won't do the same for other issues. I wish people would speak with their wallet. It's the only way to get their attention.
---
With the alpha packs you just had to close the game and go back in for me
---
Ah, I see, someone of culture
---
Except for the fucking strobe light effect.
---
it tells u when a hacker gets banned as well, and not all people can just buy another account. and some people who do get banned won't buy new accounts because they used hacks as a way to climb in ranked or cuz they are shit.
---
Yep.  Fuck Tower.
---
You got your girls dildo up your ass or something, relax it's a joke
---
HEY dont be racist and only include one recruit. C'mon man its 2019
---
That's like using a plastic straw!
---
Honestly tho crash would‚Äôve been a better name than clash
---
First off, it‚Äôs a game. No need to take it personally. In my opinion, the other game modes are not made for balanced competitive games, and that the harsh truth is that in order for Ubisoft to keep coming out with more ideas for this game, Ubisoft has to choose one the game modes to balance around.
---
I do be like that sometimes. I run into a good bit at higher ranks. Sensitivity set to 100, obvious mouse dragging. I just have to remind myself to flag who they are and not get into a peak war with them. They can be outplayed, but it's tough. Makes you better, but i do hate the fuck out of it.

Ya'll act like he was as broken as ela on her first release
---
Jackal was banned..
---
Jackal isn't even that good waste of a ban in my opinion
---
Yeah I have tried that but the thing is that I don't have any friends that play rainbow so it really really sucks
---
when I checked my dlcs it does not show year4 pass on year3
---
Honestly just removing or reworking the top floor will do it for me.
---
Nice job
---
I don‚Äôt think you can sell stuff on ps4 bro
---
The messages are there to make you aware of action being taken by ubi
---
You‚Äôre seriously underestimating the number of players in this game if you think seeing even a couple thousand banned players means that there must be a hacker in your particular match
---
Why dl ylu only have to pay 11,250?
---
bro i get this glitch all the time and none of my homies care but i think it‚Äôs hilarious ughhhhh
---
Huh, that is really interesting.. I have never seen thar before. Maybe they have a really low spawn rate?
---
Huh?
---
But you can buy R6 credits no problem right now... lol go figure
---
Pretty good except for the speakers. You can either leave them to mask your footsteps or shoot them to turn them off and hear the enemy better
---
That‚Äôs cuz they are pressurized and released through a nozzle, and possible liquid for some. While that‚Äôs how smoke uses it in his elite animation, it‚Äôs not how it works in game.
---
Getting high temps and weird glitch where whenever I start to run I crouch, ads, scoreboard opens and the text chat opens

I don't know. I don't have a hive mind. I don't speak for the public. I am nobody to judge a person's looks. For all I know I might look hideous in somebody's eyes, so who am I to judge the looks of a person?
---
It's the same with Villa, that map has no doors, windows, or exterior walls that lead directly to a site because it forces attackers to think and commit to a push. It makes the game more thought-provoking rather than just making it so attackers just get a plant down super quick and easy.
---
&gt;Notice how I said "y'all act" instead of "so your saying" when comparing them,
---
Okay so now we're just arguing semantics.
---
&gt;also if its justified for blitz then why add the nerf to Monty and fuze.
---
To keep shields consistent across the board, and these operators are not reliant on their shields like blitz. Blitz can sprint with his shield in front of him and has the ability to flash an enemy for an easy kill.
---
Monty is a support operator who should be with his team protecting them with his shield extended.  Fuze has his cluster charges and can also carry a rifle instead of just his shield.
---
Yep I thought of that but they just annoy me so much more than it should, perhaps just globally turn them down a bit for everyone. And besides, speakers have never stopped me from hearing someone‚Äôs footsteps.
---
I fully agree. Maybe Lord Blitz is here now.
---
 It was hard to do something alone before this season. This season, he almost can do nothing even with his teammates. 
---
Does the word "support" means stand still and do nothing?
---
I don‚Äôt think you get any weapon skins but you do get 600 R6 credits you could use to buy whatever you want. Also everything gets 10% cheaper e.g. operators that would cost 20k renown would cost you 18k with the season pass. 
---
Here‚Äôs a link to their season pass page: https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasonpass.aspx
---
Pretense doesnt make you moral or ethical.
---
I need to know what rank this is

Thought this was che Guevara for a second there

Yeah. Hopefully we‚Äôll get Buck this year.

They spelt it wrong it's suppose to be Deutscher

YAAAAS, THIS IS WHAT I CALL POD RACING
---
Ok, makes sense
---
no problem :)
---
Yeah looks really clean
---
New ops doesn't deserve season pass
---
She can be quieter lol
---
Oooh that was dirty
---
Take this down now. I don't want Ubi to destroy this art once they're aware of it
---
It‚Äôs a really cool detail, tho unfortunately it will mostly go unnoticed since the majority of players use weapon skins. 
---
Would have been even cooler if we got unique animations like N√∏kk and Warden did.
---
What do you want them to do? The servers aren't theirs, they belong to Microsoft Azure and so Ubi has no control and it pisses me off that everyone just complains about Ubi doing nothing when they said they put a team on it and that's about all they can do.
---
For me today the lag only started after drone phase ended, then it lasted until there was 15 seconds left so we all had to run in and die. That happened for every attack round and then it got better on defense until they planted the defuser and the lag started the moment he defuser was down. There are a 0% chance that was normal server lag.
---
I have a beefy computer as I‚Äôm a pretty competitive player, frame rate and refresh rate all matter to me. Subtle changes may go unnoticed for many people but like I replied in the other comment, the un-ads and sprinting delay is so obvious and clunky I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs hard to miss. You literally have to walk 0.5 second now before you can sprint after ads-shoot-unads every time.
---
In other words communist
---
Absoloutly! Thank you. Support how, dying?
---
It‚Äôs happening to me too! Yesterday before the new update I was going from 26 ping to 120 and lagging at all, today I didn‚Äôt have it until late at night but then it disappeared I wonder if it is for un√≠ servers

---
Right there with you mate. Buck NEEDS AN ELITE SKIN.
---
Use actual seran wrap for the shield.
---
The servers seem to be taking a hit today and player data isn't syncing up like it should which is why the issues with the challenges.
---
With Kanal it's been remade under the new idea that attackers must push into the building and commit to a push to reach the objective. That's why it's easier for defenders, though personally I wouldn't call it defender sided.
---
Bro chill. Look at r6 stats, the stats are updated. Look at the other threads talking about the same thing.
---
Holy hell we need this as a skin or him wearing a t shirt with the logo as an outfit
---
Yeah it‚Äôs some bug I have it too
---
No
---
I‚Äôm having a huge problem on PS4, I‚Äôm not getting renown after any matches or for daily challenges. I‚Äôm also not getting any alpha pack rolls...I‚Äôve restarted the game many times and it hasn‚Äôt fixed..I‚Äôm hoping this gets resolved sooner rather than later.
---
This is not an argument

Thanks, idk how I even reacted to it, most the times I replay it I can barely see the foot running through the doorway
---
Love it. Asseatnszn
---
Gas grenades are typically pyrotechnic devices - they're not pressurised containers of CS gas, phosphorus or whatever, they're containers of flammable powder that produce the desired aerosol when burn.
---
Just name it undercover
---
But it doesn‚Äôt have to be shot does it? If it‚Äôs something that can detect nearby movement surely it‚Äôs something that can be disabled/destroyed, making it a manual only defense ‚Äúweapon‚Äù
---
B8g mood
---
Unless Ubi confirmed for your specific match that it was DDoSed a 0% chance is not an accurate statement. Improbable is more fitting.
---
...
---
why?
---
"what's on the canister"
---
its a good opportunity for retards to be locked into a gamemode where they can be with each other its not my fucking job i'm not on ubisofts payroll
---
No, it‚Äôs literally a can of gas. It doesn‚Äôt require electricity.
---
Its shock sensitive. No electronics
---
That is true but at least on villa you can enter from the other side of the map and clear out roamers. On Kanal wherever you enter from it‚Äôs extremely high risk.
---
Because it is, it's just a model attached to his "teeth" at a specific angle
---
Spend a few hrs in t hunt and learn the map before making ignorant posts like this.
---
Make sure you have Maestro and either Echo or Valk so you know exactly when to set it off. 
---
Mira would work too.

&gt;Study finds facially unattractive adolescents lose social popularity when they act aggressively, but facially attractive ones do not lose popularity when they do it (x-post from PPD)
---
Explains why attractive bullies keep going up in life. Again, reinforcing Halo v horn effect via physical appearance.
---
Exactly. The only thing that can really be measured is how willing people are to go against authority or comply and how driven people are by morals or how self serving they are
---
More self-serving means more towards the evil end, more moral means towards the good end
---
More towards rebellion, more chaotic, more towards compliance, more lawful

Only somewhat decent op left is monty but only on certain maps like plane or Oregon

Shooting it or an explosive going off next to it
---
First game of the season. Teammates shot out 2 of my shields in the prep phase. Got me down to 4 health. Should just stayed in the fire, died, and activate reverse friendly fire on him.
---
Given that this is not really an issue on PC, I would not be surprised if we found out that Ubisoft has no control over preventing this, given how strictly Microsoft and Sony control things like deploying updates.
---
it's because they are crouching you dumb dumb

Thank you all

This is a great post. Thank you for putting so much time and effort into writing this. I hope this will someday get resolved.
---
And ALL of this is supposed to affect me how? That "scale" is theirs. Not mine. I choose not to judge because I don't care. You said it yourself,  right? People listening based on some "reason", such as "beauty"? People making hot/beauty scale? Is that scale voted upon by EVERY SINGLE HUMAN ALIVE IN THE WORLD? no, right? A small fraction. The rest either haven't seen it or don't care.
---
Yes, some don't care. Yes, they set "preferences", and those preferences are personal. And like I said, preferences can match. You find somebody hot? Ok. You find somebody ugly? Ok. I don't. That's your rating. Not mind. I don't have a hive mind. I'll choose what I want. So you can take that "famed" beauty scale and show it to somebody who is affected by it. Tinder doesn't work in my country anyway, so there goes a major chunk of your proof. People who you might consider "ugly" also might end up getting married and having happy lives, so there goes that as well.
---
I choose not to go ahead with beauty judgements. That's my choice. You are entitled to your own choice, which is also why you find amaru ugly while I don't. There's your variation in proof right there.
---
Completely agree that DDosing is horrible for everyone. The other day I was playing the first ranked game with a friend who is new (probably didn't help cause I was in plat) but we got Ddosed, he got kicked and got ban. Got off straight after that.
---
Except for Mozzie and Gridlock
---
F in the chat for new ops
---
He thinks the R on the headphones means rear
---
It's PS4 tho
---
Like I said up until now all nerfs  were tolerable and I even agree with the melee nerf. But this is way to far.
---
You need to damage the red box to set it off. 
---
Shoot it, Maestro laser it, Throw a nade at it, Melee it etc... Twitch cant set it off. 
---
Only way to set it off by vaulting it is if the defenders also set a kapkan trap on the same door.

---
&gt;Another replication of mate-choice copying: Women rate men about 1 of 10 points more attractive when men are surrounded by other women vs by other men or alone (Scofield et al., 2019)
---
This says a person looks attractive subjectively, but only insofar as it gives them social credit, and it only adds to their actual physical attractiveness score, it does not replace it or even have a 50% difference.
---
Which means physical attraction is still QUITE objective.
---
IF, if you really wanted to, state that Beauty based on Personality is subjective, you could've been totally right.
---
BUT you chose to state that physical beauty was subjective. ANd its clearly not. Not at all.

Yes it triggers at crouch height

&gt; I choose not to judge because I don't care.
---
If you're making a conscious effort, that is directly contradicting your natural proclivities. And it also invalidates your claim.
---
Hip fire was nerfed. Meleeing was nerfed. Shields can just be shot through. So your basically putting you entire team down a player when running a shield. There is literally no point in playing them so ubi either needs to rip off the bandaid and get rid of them or fix the issue.
---
Goyo is basically a Tachanka buff
---
and they took out plane
---
thats somewhat genius too
---
Yeah idk what it is I‚Äôve done research and looked into but haven‚Äôt found a single thing, my ping will sit at 27 and then spike to 1999 out of no where and if I get killed the kill cam will show them running up to the point the freezing happens then it cuts to me dead it‚Äôs so irritating
---
Stim pistol?

Elaborate, please.

I love how people say shields OP but 7/10 you get shot trough it because #UbisoftBestGameDevsEver

But seriously, all you have to do against a Monty is walk back and strafe hard

That‚Äôs just straight up disrespectful.

&gt;If you wear camouflage outside of hunting I'm gonna think you're fucking your cousin.

Eh, hunter gear is quite nice and durable, especially if you are an outdoorsy type. And besides that, camo is quite popular in streetwear and stuff like that for a few years now.
---
that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all, I‚Äôm saying that a good team should be able to hold their own in a 4v5 situation. 
---
In the case of w/e previous guy said, he‚Äôs likely incredibly shit at the game, then, yes, the team is better without him
---
i‚Äôm not saying you should leave a game just because you‚Äôre shit, i‚Äôm saying that even if you do leave a game, a good team of 4, can still win that match

I never play ranked at the beginning, that's when you get all the sweats and ddosers.
---
U get a charm

Try the mibr uniform with that headgear, I recommend it!

Link is expired

When they get better at the game they will realise that they aren‚Äôt, and some attachments are person preference anyway.

Oh cool , thanks

Nice and am happy that you have blackice for amaru
---
I would like an official word from ubisoft regarding the increase of DDOS. It is KILLING the game for many people.
---
Not on plane tho.. bc you know.. you can‚Äôt play it
---
iPhone 11 R6S
---
Agreed, I‚Äôm not playing for a couple days.
---
Same tbh becuase they fixed her model so she wasn't all round potato face now so an elite set with this face model=hard nut
---
Im guessing this is a bug, hope they fix soon
---
Smoke has a Uno reverse card in his pocket.
---
Its not about shooting someone, they are just too weak.
---
Unless you're in a tight corridor, even someone who is alone can flank u just by strafing, even monty is no longer well protected from the front.
---
I suggested Better ADS to compensate for the fact shields are easy af to shoot down now even from the front.
---
Play casual. Boom. Done
---
TLDR: Vanila Map (way too much). Nowadays is way too unbalanced for Defense and even for attackers since must be the map with more spawn peeks from the 14th map rotation that was in Phantom Sight. Almost every spot is very hard to hold on, only Trophy is decent but still uncomfortable. The atmosphere is really good, one of the best maps despite all the bad things. If they keep with the idea of reworking it. I hope they just change the rooms and dont make a shit fest like they did with Hereford
---
Select an operator from the Operators tab and go to the very bottom (below Bio and Details and Statistics), and an option for 'Showcase this operator' will be at the bottom, then tick it.
---
Well I play unranked and casual, will start ranked next week or the week after maybe.
---
Oof hit me harder in the heart why dont you üò•
---
Did he shoot his teammate?
---
for good measure
---
If you buy year 4 pass, you get all operators released this year and also the operators that are coming next season. There's also the operator bundles if you want to get the older dlc operators and buying the bundle is cheaper than buying the operators one at a time.
---
Mr kaid main is right. Play causal if you care to test them. Stop whining
---
Actually, they aren't doing anything wrong.
---
Spawn peeking isn't going anywhere.
---
However, in ESL, any kill gotten in the first 2 seconds of the round, by any means, is illegal. Which is right since for the first 2 seconds, you CAN be defenseless, especially on maps like bank. So they are covering up spots on some maps where you can get a kill in the first 2 seconds.
---
However, any kill even 1 millisecond after that is legal, and anybody that cries because of that is a dud.
---
that is kinda my point, since it is personal preference for most attachments why do weapons start with some equipped at all? it is an entirely pointless addition to the game that added fuck all other than giving some idiot at Ubi some busy work.
---
High Plat elo went pretty good. Got ddosed twice in 30 games.
---
Yes, the best game of all time.
---
The Thermite outbreak skin makes me cringe because he's using duct tape instead of bandages on his burns
---
Just oww
---
You can't
---
They just released with the new season, unranked (ranked rules with less importance)
---
I personally get by on it as an attacker pretty well. It may be that i don't play hostage and abuse Fuze a lot though.
---
Banning instantly helps cheat creators to understand what kind of bypass is detected, while banwaves are not allowing them to easily guess what caused their ban.
---
Fuze: *heavy breathing*
---
&gt;Ubi (and the fans) concluded that smoke also has a full hazmat suit covering all his body and a respirator so that he isn't affected. 
---
I knew I wasn't the only one who remembered this.
---
Guess they "virtually" nerfed his gas.
---
Well I didn't think this joke through .
---
Like I said, some attachments is better than none at all. Try using the smg-11 without anything on it.
---
aha
---
Hell yeah! Can't wait for them to be *playable*
---
thanks haha, i think its my only black ice :/
---
It is a 1 month rotation. That and house will be back after a month.
---
Fair i guess, maybe my eyes are ack but i never really notice differences above 60 fps, and i have a 144hz monitor
---
When you turn view bobbing off in minecraft

Ok, I'll look into that then. Thank you!

A month without plane , well ubisoft just list a player until such time

How I see it is, overall across the playerbase, it should balance out. That does mean that winners would have a lower rating than losers though... ü§î.
---
Hmmm.. Agree the idea needs work but I think something like this is worth working on more because it's so hard to detect and punish cheaters - a community driven solution could be more effective.
---
And jacal is still banned
---
Check cpu usage. Could be, like you said, a cpu bottleneck.
---
Furthermore...
---
It used to be, it's out of rotation right now
---
Well, just got my first crash. Middle of ranked...
---
minus the "limits" because those are lies
---
I'd be amazed if Ubisoft is really doing nothing to address this. It's game breaking and simply can't be ignored if they want to be taken seriously.
---
You can get all of them on YT, but it was really grungy.
---
Who cares about those? :D
---
Agreed
---
Remember, a ranked with jackal is not ranked
---
The elite skin still has a box on his back connected to smokey's face mask by a tube. I'd guess that's some kind of advanced filter, that other SAS members don't have in their masks.
---
They wouldn't mind. Total number of accounts just hit 50 mil, so with their crazy profit margin, they wouldn't mind one player going away for a month over a sh*tty map.
---
You'll start off as 3500 hidden MMR, normally the placement matches are around 100mmr per match. 
---
If you lose 5 thats -500/580(depending on the avg mmr of the teams). If you win the rest of the matches you can place mid plat, wrose case high gold.
---
She'll eat it all and you along with it
---
Even though that's 2 times too many, I'd play ranked at that ratio. I hear my mates are being DDoSed twice an evening (in 4-6 ranked games, they get DDoSed in two of them).
---
Time for some Anschluss, I see
---
Alr thank you and ya I was confused cause I heard someone won 10 games in a row and got diamond
---
Casual is usually more fun
---
it is in tower now
---
Oh man! Shes hot now
---
sama with me, even the alpha pack already  at 30% and the percentages does bot increase
---
Whatyca mean the limits are lies.
---
Well the official statment in the forums is the standard statement: The dev team is fully aware of this and is actively invastigating.
---
In other words: Nothing will happen...
---
Probably because the team you're facing doesnt have those ops and they feel it's unfair that season pass holders can play first and not them. Experience this for a week now. Omega LuL.
---
nice.
---
Season 4 defender is supposed to be an alternate to jaeger. 
---
As for elite, my money is on Buck after Ela.
---
Thank you sm that‚Äôs what I was wondering I‚Äôm on my last one rn wish me luck üòÇ
---
Nice I got Amaru 4k my first game with her. I'm happy with the new ops this season. Last season was pretty week so I'm glad we got two really good ops this season.
---
I played all day today. Completed my placement matches, Played some unranked. I haven‚Äôt noticed any of that being slow, ADS and gadget deployment seem the same as last season.
---
JK, just got crashed.
---
&gt;At its core, it's a security issue with the Xbox live service that they can't fix as the internet is by nature meant to exchange information using these IP addresses.
---
Not true. It's a simple fix, route the traffic through a Microsoft server first so the attacker can't see the original IP the sender is using. That's why your address can't get DDoSed simply by being in the same game as the DDoSer (anymore).
---
You'd think since console people are paying for the privilege of your online services the least Sony and Microsoft could do is make sure they're not exposing your IPs, but console manufacturers don't care enough.
---
A shitty map I will have you know sir that Plane is one of the best yet the best map in the game as it is easy to remember its nice and small for roaming and very accessible for point control
---
It's a respirator. Normal skin has it too aside from the hazmat
---
I agree. Being team killed and voted off is real fun till it gets old ya know. But Ubisoft keeps it bc it‚Äôs more realistic lol that‚Äôs a huge joke in itself.
---
Looks like Chris Kyle from American Sniper.
---
Well look to the left of the reinforced door
---
What about Smokes come at me, bro elite animation.
---
I hate her, it‚Äôs just that all my friends were talking about ‚Äúgodlike‚Äù her gun is and so I tried her out
---
this was in test server too and was called out. but of course it gets carried over to live server.
---
I don't know yet, got it at release and stopped playing for a while, now active since a few years. Maybe I will be able to answer this question one day
---
I get kicked from games because my team is a 4 stack and don't want a fifth. Legit happened 5+ times.
---
Weird how they didn't patch it, I didn't see the phone in the right orientation once since the update
---
It's not a bug, it's on purpose
---
How is this real?
---
Tbh loads of players still warm up for ranked, I mean I‚Äôm a gold 3 and lvl 95, I warm up in casual by playing as serious as possible
---
Changing the name isn‚Äôt enough anymore in most countries. You have to change the whole look of a gun and people would complain about that as well
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄHEREFORD IS GONEü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Late reply but you get the universal Volcano skin and the Lava 6 charm.
---
it's quit  unstable in asia, but not that suck
---
More like field-line tbh
---
This game wont last long if more and more people keep dossing
---
Usually, I can buy 2-3 new ops in a season, so just play the game. Don't forget the challenges as they givr you a lot of renown
---
Eh isnt that only if you buy it before march 2019? If i do still get it I'd buy the pass rn haha
---
Ela has an elite skin?
---
nvm, just saw the leaks. Looks weird.
---
I'd say 100 hours at minimum. I've played 170 hours and I still forget where things are in some maps.
---
Somebody took the time to do this it's nice, hopefully ubisoft sees this and the DdoSers and they read the thing, that has been written serval times "IT'S ILLEGAL".
---
I know people do it to rank up but what does it create? Fake diamonds who clearly don't have the skill of a non-cheating, organically earned diamond rank.
---
These players are laughable. You see the diamond rank and you watch them play and you're like... 'Waaaaat... They'll give diamond to anyone nowadays...' üòÖ.
---
Blacc
---
Few? I'd say at least half of them are not good.
---
&gt;Eh, some hunter/military gear is quite nice and durable, especially if you are an outdoorsy type.
---
I agree and own some myself, but I don't wear a camouflage unless I am trying to hide and I typically don't wear it out around town or to the store.  
---
 The hunter type where I live will wear their gear all around town and act just like this guys comment. 
---
Anyone who says anything about it is somehow less of a man with these morons.
---
I don't want to associate myself with all the braindead hicks who think camouflage and killing make you a man.
---
_literally unplayable_
---
Nice pun lol
---
700/800 hours
---
They could have included an operator screen like they had for the showdown thing if you‚Äôve got the full set equipped
---
another reason gadgets shouldn't be counted as teamkills
---
KS is a thing in R6 ??
---
What‚Äôs his gadget?
---
Ranked mode skill is not even comparable to PL skill.....
---
Yeah I know and Idk if that will keep them at bay it seems like it's a growing number of people doing it. There's even tutorials on YouTube on how to ddoss on siege LMFAO
---
What happened to memes being banned?
---
This dude says so yes.
---
I made a full bio of him his guns and his gadget you can check them out on my page the post would provoke explain better than I could :)
---
I understood that it comes later this season
---
Interesting, thanks man!
---
Tons of guns suck, you just have to go for headshots. Not every objective or map can support a roaming shotgun op, and when contesting a long hallway I'd much rather have the smg
---
Im seeing people on R6 tracker that have 3000 MMR and are plat 2 this season - really odd. I think that have changed it.
---
I wish she'd have gotten a skin based on her lore, not a shitty commie Che wannabe.
---
Even I'm getting it. I saw a post about it yesterday and I thought it was one random dude who got it. Probably new update smh
---
Blue recruit is the alpha you dumb bitch.
---
Play casual if you care so much
---
Yeah they ban you from it. Ubisoft is basically Mr Krabs
---
This is pretty broken... Lets lower the health of Blackbeard's shields to one hit and take away his deagle attachments
---
3 replies to a single comment, you really sound upset.
---
As for length of bans, I got a friend who got permanently banned
---
Same on PC too
---
U/ubinoty
---
u/its_epi u/kalyrical
---
last season a couple tracker sites were showing the highest rank they achieved before finishing placements, but the mmr wouldn't be shown until placements, so they coulda won 4 or 5 in a row and shot up, and then lost some and fell back down but since they had 3700+ mmr before it was shown, the site automatically sticks that as the highest. Idk if that's why but it's what I would think so.
---
I dont like the nose job. She Lost the Native look she had.
---
Been happening to me all day too.
---
*KS is a thing over 50 IQ ??
---
I was DDosed in a unranked game yesterday. Whats even the point?
---

gonna be honest, i don't remember, it's been a couple years. I would check [here](https://support.ubi.com/en-us/Faqs/000017027/Ubisoft-Account-Linking-Unlinking)
---
So Jackal and Lesion are free?
---
No I have IQ elite it's the same defenders just have blue
---
huh. it says the pass will be out the same time as ember rise. Thanks for the info
---
It's a breathing apparatus used by divers. Normally worn over a thermal layer so as to keep mostly free movement of the hands and arms.

Interesting, this barely happens at asian servers

I was about to ask the same thing

21 ping right there i dont chej it in the video but trought the game i had 21 ping

Happening to me too.

What the other guy said, a lot of time with the vector I feel like you mostly full auto, unless it‚Äôs medium range of course. But mostly, Mira is up and close so you fire a full mag. And as you said, the recoil is basically a straight line up so by adding that comp you don‚Äôt have to worry about the horizontal AT ALL. So now, just pull straight down and it‚Äôs ezpz

PC. I have a new ssd with new windows and I've moved so my pc or internet cant be the issue

Same problem here, I got Alpha pack but because of this I got nothing
---
barbed wires and nitro cells has been taken too
---
What?
---
Could easily be your connection. Have you checked it?
---
Hi Dario
---
My controllers generally start to generat drift after like 3/4 months of using them and it ends up getting really bad. 
---
My deadzone isn‚Äôt too high anyway, it‚Äôs on 8. 
---
But now I‚Äôve realised why my controllers don‚Äôt last very often so I‚Äôm actively trying to fix what I was doing wrong. What would happen is that I get called to go help with stuff (very often, at least 3x per hour) so in my rush, I‚Äôd place my controllers near the edge of my desk. Then, since I‚Äôd be in a game of rocket league or siege, I‚Äôd get killed or scored on. This makes my controller vibrate usually but because it‚Äôs near the desks edge, the vibrate makes it fall off of my desk and it always seems to land on the analog sticks. 
---
I never used to realise this but I only just found out a few days ago when I caught myself doing it.
---
Yes, you are. You clearly don't deserve to play R6S if you're not even able to launch it
---
What? Why?
---
you can't
---
I don't know what they did with this update to the controls
---
As for the toggle deployment I'd recommend trying to get used to it, it's very helpful if you're suddenly being shot and you need to cancel deployment or if your gadget isn't being deployed where you want it, I also used to hate it but once you get used to it you'll never want to change back
---
YOOOOSSSSSSSSS
---
it's not.this doesn't happen in any other game and lots of people have this issue.
---
it's happened before and after my recent move.
---
What are the pilot team skins?
---
no
---
Yeah, but a real life teargas grenade looks like that too, even though it works by heating up the otherwise harmless powder inside.

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

Alibi is best for denying windows and doorways(along with a shield), not trying to trick players in to shooting her or stepping in to the hologram.  When using her effectively, the skins don't matter.

Alot of people play Console because they can afford/have a decent PC to play PC games...

yes. the issue is not my connection.

Did you set your refresh rate higher manually? I mean in your Nvidia control panel (assuming you have a Nvidia card) not the game. If so that‚Äôs the issue
---
Originally before the game came out the smoke wouldn‚Äôt affect the SAS but it was changed because it was kind of a weird interaction
---
Guess you could call it faze paint
---
Which icons were you referring to then? Not the ones relating to connection?
---
Wait, did they not fix this after it was abused to f--k in the TTS? Is it still a viable strat?
---
I played 12 games today, I have a renown booster on and everything and I didn't gain a single but of renown, xp, alpha packs or anything. Like awesome update but how am I supposed to be happy with this bug
---
Not excused, grow some testicles
---
Restart the game your renown total and packs should update just did this it worked
---
I can use my r6 credits
---
what about ela's elite?
---
I'm a cav hoodie + mask main. the only Worthy caveira
---
Idk then hit up ubi support
---
And i am getting now renown for my matches
---
it's is well though of, but I don't think we need another hardbreacher, Both roles of close and far breaching is already covered by Hibana and thermite. But I actually see this OP added to the game, because Ubi to me it feels like they are semi recycle ideas and calling it new.
---
But anyway nice idea
---
Tried that. Still the same issue. Happened with my daily 150 renown challenge too.
---
Is it live?
---
Heh...heh 
---
#HAHA
---
Same.  I'm on Xbone, what's your platforms?
---
Seriously dude, the game just puts every symbol there since it can't comprehend whats going on. A bad connection would most certainly not cause low (in this case zero) FPS.
---
In addition to that, why should we only have a bad connection while playing R6, but every other online game is completely fine?
---
May i ask how much does the Buck Rogue Operator kit cost and when will it be available?
---
Finally some good fucking maintenance service
---
Hmm, one person doesn't have an op.
---
this deserves more upvotes

Something worth looking at.

No one is saying that's the case.

&gt;In addition to that, why should we only have a bad connection while playing R6, but every other online game is completely fine?
---
Routing. Connection sensitivity. Perhaps other reasons.
---
Do we have information about the Call Me Harry-Release Date?
---
ah shit, i really like the Rogue skin of the C8. Okay, thank you and have a nice day my good sir!
---
No you just lose the ops. I had a friend gameshare and come to my house. At my house he had all the new ops, when he went home he didn't have them.
---
I think in a bout a week or so
---
Laame no skill.
---
Mine is Mute and Maverick since my friend yoinked Nomad from me
---
It would be the strongest buff J√§ger got of all time. For an attacker having drone information is key at any stage of the round and by the ads clearing drones J√§ger could potentially get rid of 90% (9/10 drones) of attackers intel. Plus he would deny so much intel just by preventing drones from jumping around in a room

Same here

Before, in the test server, whoever shot the goyo fire thing would be the one considered responsible for any damage that comes from that fire. As such, putting goyo shields all around the hostage and baiting attackers into shooting could make it so if an attacker hit one of the shields, and the fire killed the hostage, the game would consider the attacker responsible just like if he had shot the hostage normally.
---
Is it just me that finds Goyo so excessive? The shields, the guns, and then both secondary gadgets being the ones that can be damaging.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I think we ran into our first ddos‚Äôers in ranked this week. Usually our ping sits around 10-30 but this game it randomly jumped to 400 then we couldn‚Äôt rejoin. Two people on our team the first round just sat spinning in spawn using their utility. Then next round everyone gets kicked. Could this be ddosers?
---
nah there is nothing strange when i play overwatch with the same headphones so it must be bug for some people
---
Tragic, rainbow needs to fix their shit
---
In unranked I believe you will be able to. I could be wrong tho!
---
Pleb
---
I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that, because if that happens, then people like me who enjoy all of the maps will only get to experience different maps once in a blue moon.
---
*imagination*
---
So you're telling me you've never been in a match where your team was winning, and all the sudden everyone's ping jumps to 2000+? Oh, but one of the enemies seems to be doing fine and killing everyone as they keep rubberbanding around? Must just be a tiny bit of server lag I guess.
---
I have the same problem but only advice i can give you is: look at your every death and think what could have you done to prevent it
---
Ok, so, I figuered it out, those are attachments you had on other ops, if you have Holo, Flash and Vertical on 2 out of 3 SMG11s, it will be placed on your SMG-11
---
Ok. Cool map though
---
2 speed, ok gadget, impacts and c4, good primary and a shotgun secondary. Probably the best operator they've released this season tbh.
---
I CaNt PlAy FoR a HaLf An HoUr
---
Most likely not even a ‚Äúddos‚Äù attack. If that match never even starts then everyone gets abandonment. Seems counter productive to me...
---
bruh shits hard on xbox
---
need to be within 1000mmr of each other.
---
Hmm one of these is not like the other
---
Restart , it doesn't update but when u restart ur renown is there
---
It's quieter. Still audible.
---
What set this off? "Want to play"???
---
Would be nice and make sense tbh. But it's eh. Ubisoft does what Ubisoft wants I guess.
---
Now that's the problem
---
Really no fuze holding the hostage jokes?
---
I know that.
---
I am wondering for real ranked. We ve been playing together since the BETA and it would be pretty stupid if we had to plan when to play together our placments since not everyone is online at the same time.
---
Wtf dude i was waiting for some 4k or something :p
---
too broke to get it in PC, plus cheaters and hackers sonid rather not play pc
---
Server? Eu? Na?
---
But I had absolutely nothing equipped on IQ's lmg and yet Amaru's came with a bunch of attachments.
---
Fuck the battle pass.
---
It likely only uses data from unranked...
---
I love it personally. It‚Äôs much more fluid, and makes playing on realistic more viable as a practice routine.
---
Wait, what leaks?
---
they got removed along side nitro rooms and barbed rooms
---
Ranked and Unranked have "different" mmr systems....

No shit sherlock

Yep same things happening to me as well on both PC and Xbox :(

Ik she just came out but probably amaru. When you grapple, defense will hear you coming. You also have to stop when you get inside. She‚Äôs just fun to play in casual sometimes and doesn‚Äôt help the team at all.

How u get multiple ops on your flair
---
It's worth mentioning that Ubisoft can do absolutely nothing to prevent a DDOS attack, the online game runs on Microsoft Azure servers which Ubisoft are only renting access to, any form of DDOS protection would need to come from Microsoft's side.
---
I do like the idea of cancelling the match if all player pings exceed a threshold. You could set a threshold of maybe 1000ms and if all players simultaneously experience a ping greater than that for a CUMULATIVE period of say 30 seconds then the match would just be voided, however, that would then lead to teams abusing this by stressing the servers if they are about to lose to prevent elo loss.
---
Champions rank has the only purpose to increase server ddoser. 
---
R6 it's my favourite game but I can't wait to play the new CoD while waiting for Ubisoft doing something about ddos.
---
Thats a no chief he still really good in high ranks
---
Is doc's ability 1 hit kill?
---
I willfully exaggerated on Mira, let's just say the she can really complicate things for attackers on most maps.
---
Well now I‚Äôm going to say that every time I get interrogated from now on
---
Lets be real, we all know many in the champions rank are going to be DDoS'ers. 
---
But 1.5 kills per game? - i realise that kills is not everything in this game, and actually thats the role i fill in my team as a support op. yet i still average 4-5 kills per game at Diamond/Plat 1 level, so for the supposed best in the game it shouldnt be hard to expect at least 3 kills per game.
---

It's a legit play. There are no peeks that I know of currently that you literally can't challenge. Spawn somewhere else if you keep getting peeked. Or shoot back.
---
Or you know, just whine on Reddit.
---
There is no worst operator. 
---
We all have different opinions and different play styles. That being said. 
---
Warden. I have never used his ability,  nor has it been used against me successfully.
---
"refused" is jut a flat out lie
---
Your aim can move in a fraction of a second, also there's a hand about that location.
---
This comment trumps all comments on this post made at the time of writing, and all that are yet to come. You have won.
---
Because they ddos the whole game so nobody is able to move and get kills
---
I think heard someone say that it wil be live mid-season.
---
The issue is DDoS'ers. 
---
Surprisingly people who use this strategy to get easy wins by freezing the entire game in place so no one can move get very few kills. 
---
You'd expect someone at the top end level of gameplay to get at least 3 kills per game.
---
Fugget About It
---
Thats ps4 competition for ya.
---
Yes unfortunately high ping and stutters
---
Exactly
---
No they lag the server so they can plant and you won't be able to destroy the defuser. If he was lagging it would've kicked him. The server symbol even appeared.
---
It's only 5 or so meh items that you'll probably get during a random week in the season.
---
If I call out certain people who abuse game mechanics, it‚Äôs not whining
---
My thought exactly
---
Me a too
---
Prob some strat where they go there and hide and drone to see where you are(she was probably a Youtuber trying to get content)
---
That rule has been buried since reddit was created
---
I was talking about past seaosn
---
Currently would bang
---
*Lights pipe*
---
Now this I like
---
Is it though? I understand dokk but playing with lion requires a team coordination where the majority of the players don't have.
---
See my point right
---
Are you on crack? Or are you copper?
---
Right
---
Imagine ch-ch-cheating and still be losi-I-I-Ing 3-0.
---
Depends on your playstyle. I like to play Dokkaebi because I'm not that good in gunfights. If I have to choose an Operator to win gunfights nice and easy I'll take Thatcher, Ying or Zofia.
---
Mute's MP5K has the nearly the exact same DPS but with slightly less drop off to the point that it probably won't have any impact on Nokk at all. 
---
Either her gun needs to be something with higher DPS (along with longer gadget usage) or she needs to become 3 Speed.
---
This is magic honestly the only person to die this way , if I could upvote the Zofia I def would
---
Exactly my point.
---
*extend*
---
I think what will happen is all the higher rank players (who lose to ddos) will end up in gold 2-plat 3 and play with/against actual gold 2-plat 3 players, obviously ruining their experience and ours.

Gone, reduced to bits

The original meme was a photoshop of a time he fake cried on stream
---
There‚Äôs so much cool stuff they could do visually with an op that‚Äôs designed to look like a unit. In terms of different armor plate styles. And yet... *wet fart sound*
---
&gt; Then, I can also use this thing to open up walls. 
---
Woah, a shotgun opening walls :o How revolutionary. 
---
&gt; so easy to get mid range kills,  I just have to shoot until they at least get injured at SMG range 
---
Not sure how this is relevant since any SMG will kill way faster at mid range than her shotgun and a competent attacker with a rifle will smoke you instead of letting you shoot at them. Her shotgun is fine. You're restricted to close range engagements and outside of that, any decent player will outgun you. I'm not sure why people have an issue her shotgun preforming good at close range like it and all shotguns are mean't to do. Just because the shotgun is good doesn't mean it needs a nerf and chances are, any other shotgun would do the job just as well or an SMG could do it much better.

I think his lore is cool, when his gadget is actually useful it's fun and I just seem to have more fun with him than other defenders
---
Happens a lot
---
Sometimes my team has an extra slot open, thing is I‚Äôm in school so I‚Äôm only free after three Monday through Friday and on the weekends
---
Where did I say they have said that? Could you try to be a little more dishonest?
---
Goyo is a decent ban considering how powerful he is
---
Go to the operator screen then click on the operators you want to show, on the customization page there should be a button on the lower left that says "showcase this operator"
---
Wait this would make smoke exactly how goyo was supposed to first be like
---
Or they could just buff smokes and stuns in order to make them more effective and likely to be used. That indirectly makes Warden a more important pick. Maybe faster throwing time or longer duration.
---
I definitely think he should have a nitro cell to better capitalize on his ability.
---
That would be a good compromise.
---
Bruh Charlie is in this. Destroys the entire enemy team with Fleshlights

The concept is kinda cool, especially with the new update prohibiting me to play with friends that have more  than 1000 MMr less than me

If the attackers blow up the shield and kill the hostage defence wins.

Judging by the immense twitch players and how many ops she can counter this will make twitch even more popular. The difference between giving castle a counter to the new ops and giving one to twitch is that castle never gets used in most objectives which is a perfect opportunity to give him more usage. Twitch is the exact opposite being universally good and giving her another advantage will give another thing the community to complain about

My main problem with this is that all the clutter is actually useful information (some more important than others), but they become a problem when directly in front of you.
---
I know I can disable them, but having them just disappear when they're right in front of you would be a much cleaner solution, giving us best of both worlds.
---
You don‚Äôt see this as a problem?
---
Basically you want a better Ash.
---
Could you please draw ela just her head to sholder don't want you to do that much work
---
I agree with all 3 ^^^
---
You shouldnt be on your drone the whole game same with maestro you should really just use it for intel and some of the time use the ability. Echo is hard to play but really strong on bomb because you can stop a plant. You should mainly play echo on obj he is an anchor role. You also have one of the only acog sights on defense so you should use that your advantage. Hope this helps :)
---
Guys am a retard leave me alone
---
Name doesn‚Äôt check out, get him boys
---
smoke elite is seriously underrated
---
didnt give an option
---
I don't really see how a nitro cell benefits his ability when his ability isn't functional due to him having to stand still (tho a flash and smoke buff would also be nice)
---
I do agree that there are too many clicks necessary to get to an operator menu (I've previously suggested clicking the op takes you straight to the load out menu, with headgear, uniform, etc another click away) but the new menu at least looks good to look at while you click through
---
No.  While every map except Coastline is heavily defender-sided, attack wins are easier when you know the map and have competent teammates.  Attack filling first isn‚Äôt an issue and just requires you to adapt to the situation.
---
It isn‚Äôt like he posted your post he posted his own experience so don‚Äôt act like your post has to be the only one, and that he ‚Äúcopied‚Äù your post so shut it.

Well, when I play siege and go to the shop, I don't want to turn brightness on my monitor down to avoid blinding myself and when I go to quickly customize my ops before a match, I'd like to not have an extra screen with no use whatsoever to get through.
---
On the weapon skins you'd be right... they'd be fucking majestical if the good ones DIDN'T COST 27500 REKNOWN. 
---
Also on the "not for you" thing. No. This looks like something slapped together over the course of three hours in MS Paint. It just looks wrong. This feels so out of place compared to the rather dreary aesthetic the rest of the game has. Imagine someone someone drawing something on the side of a military jeep with crayons.
---
That's just Ash with a bigger gun...
---
Yeah it does
---
this the most unique inside grappling tho, but i see where they coming from , so only hatches?
---
I watched a few videos and they all recommend vector so I put it on! I'll mess with my sensitivity thanks bro!
---
You can use it for hatches inside but not anywhere else inside. You can watch the Ubi video they released on them....
---
How many language arts teachers had to decide to just let you go on instead of holding you back and trying to actually teach you. You can‚Äôt even provide reasons for your own opinions. You call the menu‚Äôs disorganized which is just blatantly wrong. They‚Äôre literally in 2 sections separated by ark/def and I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre in order by release. Sounds fairly organized to me.
---
You say a lot of subjective things like calling the menus ugly or eyesores and you bring up no reason why you actually think this, you just repeat that you dislike it.
---
You‚Äôre mad that it adds ‚Äúanother menu a sane person doesn‚Äôt need‚Äù but don‚Äôt care to mention that they‚Äôve seamlessly integrated  the purchase operator menu into the new menu design. Which reduces the menu count by 1 evening the amount of menus overall. Not even mentioning how petty it is to get angry over clicking one more box, big deal? 
---
I think you make points and give no effort to support any of it be it factual or opinion. UI designers are not working on squashing your gameplay bugs, and it‚Äôs not detracting from that process. It‚Äôs so ignorant to get angry over someone actually doing the job their getting paid to do. You don‚Äôt get upset at your local fry cook for making your French fries, because that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs paid to do. Likewise if you‚Äôve got a complaint with a beverage do you go chastise the cooks? No you talk to a waitress.

The only reason why I am inclined to believe that the user actually did the edit is that they haven‚Äôt reposted any fanarts other than the one video just showcasing many different artworks/edits.

Okay... after the cinematics came out for Outbreak, I thought that the ingame pic and model for Thermite didn't look like the one in the cinematics, and wondered what Ubi would do about that. Now I wish they left it that way...
---
Well, that's also annoying. Both should work. If only 1 make it the skylight that makes more sense.
---
All of those headgears are alright in terms of looking realistic, but none of them imo are really cool looking. I wouldn‚Äôt spend any cash or renown on them.
---
Also it‚Äôs kinda crazy to say anything about Ela looks realistic with her tactical leggings and her dorky hair.
---
Why? I kinda like it, especially 2F

Sort of but not really

It‚Äôs a glitch. The devs already said that they are addressing it

Definitely a Ddos. Every time we got into a clutch situation, all of a sudden the server stopped working properly. All of a sudden we couldn't move and it just so happens that it only happened on their defense rounds.

I'll still use the commando. I've used that gun for so long the recoil isnt an issue for me and I know I can hit shots with that gun.
---
This was.. an interesting take.
---
New ops are only available for those with the season pass.  You‚Äôll have to wait for a week like the rest of us.
---
I‚Äôm by no means saying she can‚Äôt rush and get kills. I‚Äôve just seen this exact scenario 6 too many times and it‚Äôs only day 2 of the season.

Her neck is so bulky that it don't really fit her head but better than potato Cav
---
This is false. Reverse friendly fire is activated for Goyo whether he is dead or alive if his shields kill the hostage, regardless of who activates them. Gimme a sec and I'll edit to link the patch notes.

That‚Äôs completely unfair, why should you get into the same rank as me for exploiting unbalanced maps when I‚Äôm playing the balanced, competitive maps? They shouldn‚Äôt have decreased the casual playlist, that‚Äôs for sure, but the non-competitive maps should stay in casual with rules similar to unranked.
---
See edit
---
I usually use her for run outs, throw a hologram to a place they can't get to or one that takes alot of time. For all game they have a warning that a defender is outside so they will get used to it, this strat usually buys like 5 seconds outside before they realize your out there.
---
552 Commando still. Still feels smoothest and reliable with her.
---
The G8 is great and all but movement feels slow with it.

its not showing anything

Caveira and n√∏kk.

---
I‚Äôm not a big fan of her being able to grapple windows inside, I can see it being a huge problem. However, Ubi loves to fuck over attacking operators, everything in the game is defence sided and there‚Äôs one particular operator in defence who has more effects on his gadget than any other operator and he gets left alone. As soon as a strong attack operator comes along they get nerfed to the point they‚Äôre useless.
---
cant see anything like that
---
not visible
---
Got a 4k last night while I was just trying to learn the rework. Accidentally flanked their entire team and the last 2 came to me only to have a better angle on the windows my team was holding. It was magnificent
---
They only get that warning for 10 seconds after the decoy deploys, not all game. Unless they changed it.
---
u/i_wanna_fuck_cav
---
Yes, look at the post I linked. It is worse in higher ranks. People are doing This when they are defending to prevent the opposing team from making it to the site, or doing anything at all.

I haven't had a chance to play her yet but I can see her potential especially on sites with roof access. If her time to switch is slow like you say I can see rushing being a little difficult, but people said the same stuff about nomad and she's still a pretty top tier op. I just feel like it's gonna take time for people to start thinking seriously about what she can do and form good strats around her gadget.

Remember the old Glaz with the crazy high DPS?

They count for pistol challenge though. Has to be primary SMG for SMG challenge (so play Jackal PDW if you want to do it on attack, otherwise on Def anyone but Jager will work)

What I read is you want an animation with GSG9 and Spetznaz just railing Ela

/s as a history nerd something like Sledge's would have been cool.

Hello RealKillerYo, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d3brxc/is_anyone_else_experiencing_serious_lagging/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Literally all they need to do is keep us updated on methods they're trying. 
---
Like TTS
---
"We're implementing a VPN feature to our servers to test the increase in latency vs the protection against DDoSers on TTS" stuff like that
---
And then if it's not to their liking 
---
"The effectiveness of a VPN against DDoSing vs the ping increase makes it not worth the use of a VPN" 
---
or alternatively 
---
"The VPN has a negligible increase on ping increase and a massive increase against DDoSing attacks, and we will be implementing it into the game" 
---
Now I'm betting they've probably tried this situation, but just keeping us posted on the successes and failures of certain methods to counter DDoSing would be more than enough

thats not exploiting it imo, thats just attackers being stupid and is a legitimate strat

Turns out it wasn't ddos, it was a server thing and it happened twice in 6 games

That‚Äôs funny, last time I checked clash took some skill, to what extent is rook and doc a skillful and balanced operator?
---
Also I‚Äôm not a clash anymore I‚Äôve been lazy and haven‚Äôt changed the tags
---
It is an invisible mmr like casual.
---
Well yeah the impact will kinda be a oof for him because of impact tricking but it's not going to make him worse as the op is saying.
---
I'm lucky enough to play with a friend these days, and though I'm no pro, and I think I can hold my own with Blitz. Where I falter, my buddy covers me. You're right on your observation, though so far we didn't meet any tough resistance. We just made salty people who banned Goyo and Amaru regret their decision, I think.
---
you're a great human :')
---
You move faster with a handgun secondary equipped. Smg and shotgun secondaries don‚Äôt work. This rolled out several seasons ago
---
At least you can beat boosters
---
Yay clash is actually getting a headgear. My set can be complete
---
Thought it was weird that they're changing the map to be for an event and also reworking it like 45 days later. Maybe the event will have the rework

‚ÄúNo, the hazmat suit doesn‚Äôt make you immune to Smoke.‚Äù Seems pretty easy to me.

The reinforcement popped a goyo shield and killed teammates.
---
Fuck I thought it was a earth elemental from witcher till I read the title
---
they wont show up for you unless you have the season pass, next week they will show up for you
---
Went back and forth between 552 and G8A1.  
---
Definitely sticking to G8A1 now it has angled.
---
people always ban blitz, it‚Äôs a big waste imo. at least ban monty who has some sort of use to the team, because any decent player should be able to beat a blitz, and it should be simple if there‚Äôs more than defender on the blitz.
---
What was your score when it happened?
---
Exploded a goyo behind the wall
---
Pistols were given a movement speed buff while drawn back when they did the recoil changes.
---
Don't get me wrong, the fanmade one is fantastic, but you'd have to be delusional to think it's [better than the ones Ubisoft has put out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C61bhu8eI3o)
---
You blew up the shield as a result of reinforcing where the goyo shield was on the other side and that goyo played you by standing still.
---
Ok thank I wasn‚Äôt sure and I googled it but nothing‚Äôs showed up.
---
Oh that's hot. Thanks for the tip.
---
You think this is bad on Xbox? One time a ddosser lagged the server so bad that me and my team couldn‚Äôt get out of spawn or move a foot. He only started stressing the servers when we were on attack so it didn‚Äôt look obvious.
---
neither, wait for new ops
---
Goyo shield was to close to the wall, so you broke it
---
how can that explode if i reinforce a wall perpendicularly?
---
Looks like the new operator put his shield next to the wall on the other side and your reinforcement triggered it and killed those guys. Unlucky
---
***BRUH***
---
I only played two games yesterday and got a blue screen in one of them so that could be the fix

They should just make her secondary usable during grapple... to me it wouldn‚Äôt be op but logical and game changing. Meaning a frost could be an even better counter with amaru players being extra confident and the Mac 11 is powerful but empties in like 1.5 secs so there‚Äôs no room for error when grappling?! Just my 2 cents.
---
The process of drawing Ela is amazing, great job.
---
Processor? As per steam forums it's not working for most with older gen procs like core 2 quad and such.
---
The same way it breaks an evil eye on the other side, just breaks the shield and the fire pops as a result.
---
It's definitely been a little weird. We all (4 Stack) got separated at one point while queuing for unranked so we just had to play it out until we finished so we didn't get sanctioned.
---
Goyo placed his shield on the other side, you reinforced the wall which broke his shield, the game registers it as follows
---
&gt;you broke the shield
---
&gt;any damage dealt by the fire is dealt by the person who broke the shield (you)
---
&gt;goyo/ally takes damage from fire and dies
---
&gt;you are the source of that damage
---
&gt;banned for teamkilling
---
The fire will down him first bc it is friendly fire, but then it ticks again killing him, the downing him gives you reverse friendly fire if you didnt already have it, then the damage that kills him gets you banned for 30 mins
---
Its pretty dumb but there is t really a better way to set it up that isnt super abusable by non-goyo teammates
---
Same. Every time I see those outfits I die a little on the inside
---
Trickle down effect, as high players leave or avoid playing early season to avoid booters, booters play against lower ranks. Everyone suffers
---

 u/Its_Epi , u/UbiNoty reporting a flaw in game design
---
Agreed, but I think the software is still a viable solution to stressing at the very least, and Ubi can pressure Microsoft to improve their servers
---
Not ur fault
---
Ak12? What are you smoking?
---
It uses (possibly) assets like textures and map models from cs:go (office) and left 4 dead (hospital) and it‚Äôs made in sfm 
---
The characters (other then r6s) idk where
---
Why is that? Just because first time playing ranked or what?
---
&gt;Highest stats low recoil primary
---
What's the AK-12 doing on defense?
---
And btw it's not like Jackal, Lion, Maverick, Montagne and the likes don't exist, I would say offense has their fair share of strong ops as well
---
Break soft walls with few shots and some damage buffs would be great.
---
The AR-15 .50 has a full size Beowulf cartridge and is just 62 of dmg (the PMM is 9x18 and it has 63 of dmg), it doesn't feel that i am shooting a .50 Beowulf. Around 67 of dmg is great (High dmg, low capacity thing).
---
The "breaking capability" would be like the D-50 capabilty or slightly better, with 3-4 shots to open a hole in a soft wall.
---
Idk if a dmg buff to the MK14 EBR or the SR-25 is a good thing. Dokkaebi has only her DMR as a decent weapon because it is a laser beam but with only 60 of dmg that feels weak sometimes. Blackbeard is just revive the nightmare that was the SR-25 but, y'know, the SCAR isn't a good AR.
---
We have seen it before. A lot of times.
---
Damn, this is really fucking good
---
Still does 40 damage per pellet. You only needed to hit 4 of the 8 pellets
---
I will never play ranked until like 2 weeks after the season drops
---
no just because that's how tanked works even if you win all ten matches you won't get any higher than gold
---
With 50 million players,
---
No yeah, it's totally gonna die within the hour.
---
How did the bf1 medical syringe work?
---
Her skin was so close to be being good. R6 artists just don't know how to do woman faces and hair.
---
apples to oranges

you'll get gold 1 for winning all 10

stats don't matter

So pretty much what your saying is, stats don‚Äôt matter at all. I could go 20-1 but if we dont win, siege don‚Äôt care??
---
So pretty much individual performance doesn‚Äôt matter?
---
Hello chap i got plat bow wow
---
Finally, the buck elite i've been waiting for. I swear, if they fucking put him in hockey clothes im going to screech
---
I‚Äôve been a rook main since the beginning, suck on a rock
---
it depends on the rank you had last season, but thats not new
---
There's no way, you can surprise him by getting onto his account when he's not at home and buying it. ;)
---
Why? Just cause tachanka bad?
---
nope only wins matter stats only give more renown and xp
---
Can confirm, he told me himself.
---
The hair is too bright.
---
now it becomes apparent as to why cav mains are always on the other side of the map doing nothing. *they were rubbing one out*
---
Ever since the update yesterday I am getting insane microstutters. The frame counter jumps from 180 to 60 to 200 then to 80. I have no idea whats going on
---
PS4 too (diamond Level)
---
Neat
---
r/emojipolice WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED DONT MOVE
---
I have never seen that Blackbeard skin before. I want it
---
That's not how it's always worked that's a new change before you could just drop to copper or what ever and the next season if you won like 8 or 9 games you'd be back up to like G1 or P3
---
It's easily googleable, I don't know why it's such a big deal. Just find out the target IP and packet flood them. Simple shell script running on someone else's machine waiting for the target IP, start/stop will do. No way to trace back to you either.
---
So they should launch ops that are broken and overpowered like blackbeard?
---
Is that patched now?
---
How broken, so very stupid.
---
It just sucks because now I gotta keep looking at my silver two knowing that I‚Äôm easily a gold kinda individual player.
---
Your MMR from last season plays a big part.
---
bruh
---
To add to what everyone else is saying, the speed difference is pretty significant. A 2-speed with their secondary pistol out is as fast as a 3-speed with their primary out. This doesn't apply to 1-speed and 2-speed ops though.
---
Prodigio Pete tested it in these videos (both are the first questions):
---
[2-speed vs 1-speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optyC-kFyVU)
---
[1-speed vs 2-speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E8Ai8Ahsms)
---
Lit
---
Yep the higher the rank, the worse it gets.
---
Yeah ik but that's a new change and I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something to do with how well you fo in a match like csgo
---
unfortunately no, its apparently the only thing that the shock bots cant effect or destroy. It does nothing to it
---
Thermite main here that wants that chibi SO DAMN BAD
---
i'm a noob, so i dont know if this is a joke or is he serious af  
---
^(sounds like a joke tho)
---
So it's not the core shield mechanics your mad about, it's the bugs. Sounds like you had a salty death and came straight here
---
Do you run faster with pistol out than weapons?
---
Yep, same as Mute's jammer when you place it too close to the electrified wall.
---
that's the second season with that change, so it's not really new.
---
it's not hard to get  into gold or even platinum long as you have a good team 
---
if you need you can join my team i'm on ps4
---
Goyo's gadget sucks so bad.  It's basically time bombs for your teamates holding bomb to eventually die to.
---
I‚Äôve always had 9 ping on my wired connection however I noticed this season when playing ranked my ping would be fucked occasionally.....wonder why ü§î.....
---
How'd you get the op main thing next to your name
---
I feel like I saw something about your statistics coming into play with your MMR. If I find it again I will let you know
---
This ain't it chief
---
I think she‚Äôs actually gonna be a lot better than I expected. Go supernova and SMG 11 then you can basically use her like Buck but with the ability to get to where you want to play vertical extremely quickly.
---
And the grappling hook

This honestly makes me wish there was a season pass holder only playlist for the first week -__-

Why launch an op that is borderline useless that needs several buffs over multiple updates then?

in the latest update every person in a squad will get it if one of their squadmates teamkills

I‚Äôm sorry that you get hurt by words just don‚Äôt EZ

'cause pink skins on a supposedly serious tactical shooter bad.

Hey, I missed all my shots on a Rook after testing myself through a window but accidentally shot a Volc√°n shield and incinerated him right before I got killed by Goyo ...does that count? I think I made it a good 7 seconds

Wut

That is exactly what it means, It would have ended sooner but no one plays objectives.
---
This deserves my upvote, I don't give it out often, but this is comedy gold!

No META, play whoever you feel comfortable with and who the team needs.
---
wot?
---
This puts a smile in my pants... I mean what?
---
Yeah I see what ya did there lol
---
Not an unpopular opinion in the pro scene, I also don't think it's the best map, I feel like coastline, bank, clubhouse, new Kafe, villa are all better 
---
But I do think oregon is the best when looking at both competitive and new players at the same time , it's easy to learn and it's balanced enough to have stayed in pro league for a long time (was only removed when new Kafe was added)
---
Yes, that's why I said there's not 10. I'm confused here what's your point, are you saying everyone has to be in on it for this to be staged?

---
Gonna have to try that! Thank you!
---
Ya he gets an icon, it makes a sound, does initial damage, does damage until pulled out, stops you from doing specific actions (like planting a bomb), and they're cloaked... let's make it also stop you from running too.
---
When I started playing the game Lesion was the bane of my existence, so then I decided to main him.
---
Your post is not related to Rainbow Six Siege..
---
In the current ranked map pool, i just don't like kanal, chalet and skyscaper.
---
I love coastline but for some reason i almost always lose there.
---
Villa is ok and i like all other maps.
---
Oh I see. Yeah if you don‚Äôt do anything it‚Äôll kick you. He didn‚Äôt kick you himself, he just made the game think you were afk because you didn‚Äôt do anything
---
Use her grapple to get above site, use her shotty to blow out the floor and catch defenders off guard early into a round. Found a Mozzie like that yesterday and it was glorious.
---
Damn

Weird, i was able to rejoin mine

It unlocks your framerate, you should get around 60-70 frames

The best tip I could give you is to never play solo, finding people to play with is pretty easy.

If you can‚Äôt beat them, join them
---
Truly beautiful
---
Exactly. Having to wait possibly weeks or months to play specific maps in casual is pretty stupid. It's casual, why does it matter? Especially now that there's an unranked competitive mode.
---
In the past, seasons without 4 skins at launch received the rest through events or limited time bundles. I would expect a Halloween seasonal at the very least.
---
Na we just looking for a song not that popular yet lol
---
What's your playstyle? Do you like being a fragger or playing more tactically
---
Yes I was able to play with a controller with minor pain and it‚Äôs gotten worse, thanks for caring.
---
Gridlock is a very underrated operator with great guns and a good gadget
---
yes it is do you are have stoopid
---
I know but with 10 more bullets it would be a viable weapon for an attacker (nokk)
---
Decent rifle + killer smg + 2 nades + infinite softbreach

Who makes glass that clear jesus

light theme, bruh moment.

anyways, what's his name?

I'd also like to play a couple games tonight so you wanna sauce me your gt in a DM?

Either mnk or you're just good with the recoil. If the latter, damn

I hate skyscraper, I think it should be next to be removed, I think chalet is the  second worse 
---
I also really enjoy coastline

Well maybe people should stop leaking shit

If they released seasons at a faster pace the work would  just be sloppy

Show me what this ‚Äúpicture‚Äù has to do with R6? It‚Äôs not even from the game.
---
Idk what a fragger is
---
Same for me. The lag started after the patch (the 600+ MB one) prior to that I played right after I downloaded Ember Rise, 0 problems.
---
Why tf would you care about CTU name since literally the only thing you need to know is operator's name? It doesn't make any difference if you don't know which CTU Ash or Lion belong to.
---
Thats a nutty shot if ive ever seen one
---
N√∏kk literally has the same body structure as Gru from Despicable Me
---
in my experiences with this, my team was down by one and the other team started lagging everyone and it kicked me and my squad and we all got an abandon penalty. since we all got disconnected at the same time it ended the match and no one could rejoin to gain the victory. I'm not 100 percent sure but i'm almost positive the other team was also disconnected completely and thus got an abandon penalty.
---
I have to disagree with your chalet opinion, that map is probably the second worst map in ranked, after skyscraper 
---
Tower is dogshit and I'm never touching casual whenever it's in rotation
---
Gotcha. Wasn't really sure what it did and since it was on be default, I just didn't bother. Mind you it's the year one edition of course one and not the 1x
---
Can anyone explain what the side bars on the scope are?
---
Platform?
---
ye
---
So usual ranked. A dumb cunt loses the bomb across the map from site.
---
&gt; Amaru tho, she really isn't that good, I killed her quite often yesterday because she's so noisy. (she pushes security on coastline, I heard it in penthouse through the opened hatch)
---
I feel like her best use is rushing but not into site, but a roamer cutoff. Kanal is a good example. If the site is on the west building and you quickly rappel into the east building from spawn you're usually going to catch a roamer off guard, someone running to a certain spot or someone at a window looking outside for a peak.
---
Kaid's Aug was buffed
---
Goyo is pretty good maybe slightly op. 
---
Amaru is fun but i don't think she's very strong.
---
Kanal Rework is good, it's definitely better than before but ita super confusing for me rn. Also they shouldn't add a new or newly reworked map directly to ranked.
---
Unranked Playlist is good.
---
The new map pool is good but id prefer it if they left theme park im and removed either chalet or skyscaper.
---
UI change are nice overall but can be much better.
---
Ranked experience was bad, cos i had to play 3v5 and as usual randoms are trash.
---
Overall 7/10, nothing amazing but definitely not bad imo.
---
It also applies to anyone who swings in from rappelling too. I just recently saw it happen for the first time in about a year.
---
probably, spawn peekers are free kills
---
He looks like a teenage boy about to shave for the first time
---
Honestly I don't like how even if the attackers shoot the goyo shields, they win. It's kinda bullshit

---
when this happened to me the game did end and everyone involved got an abandon penalty.

yeah, my eyes hurt. Microsoft is cool for making Xbox dark theme by default
---
Yeah basicly
---
Not Black
---
Chalet has only 1 viable site, kitchen-trophy which is now even weaker cos of amaru.
---
Skyscraper is just spawnpeek and runout city
---
You need the universal pink weapon skin!
---
Right between the old wicket
---
Truly ugly
---
Which is which is the question though.
---
I could care less about whether he deserved it or not, this is just yet another example of the garbage knife hit detection.
---
because Snake uses his full arm instead of dropping it one foot ahead of him
---
For the various daily quests man. I really only made this because my GF was complaining when she logged on and we were starting some Casual and her daily quests or whatever just reads, "Play 3 Multiplayer Rounds As SAS, GIGN, etc.)"
---
&gt;Unlucky then. Edge case.
---
How is it fair to get banned by something that I unlucky to not identify?
---
&gt; You're talking shit. If they can't detect cheaters then no cheaters get banned and therefore you don't get banned for being boosted by cheaters. 
---
If they can't detect cheaters, how should I be able to identify them before queueing with one of them to avoid a ban? Again. i'm not talking about cases where the guys is just doing absurd things
---
How can you be sneaky when you‚Äôre dummy thicc, the clap of their asses would alert the enemy!
---
"You will never reach the truth!"
---
I_wana_fuck_cav is your best friend
---
I'm not talking about the cases where you have someone partying up with players obviously using cheats (teleports, random wallbangs that always kill someone, only headshots everysingle game, etc). I'm talking about cases that the cheater only cheats in specific moments to not make it clear.
---
Agreed. The map is in dire need of a rework, it was removed from pro league for a reason.
---
I don‚Äôt think so but it doesn‚Äôt tell me after rounds if I got renown or alpha packs.
---
Cause some people have a smol pp
---
Yeah, that's a good point.
---
Hi
---
I would add these but make the 417 go back to 10 bullets, Blackbeard‚Äôs go to the 10 bullets and Dokkaebi‚Äôs to 12. Long range weapons shouldn‚Äôt always have huge mag sizes if they are going to be buffed, otherwise they will accomplish what is supposed to be the LMG niche. Also if short range sights are going to be of any use of them the devs need to find a reason to use them. They are already outshined heavily on rifles by the Acog, and on the dmr‚Äôs they are almost never used. They even have laser sights, smh...
---
This is part of the reason I gave up on the game for the most part; the situation is just fucked on multiple levels, and add onto that Ubisoft doesn't give a single shit about SoloQ players and there wasn't anymore reason for me to keep playing except on the wild random occasion anymore.
---
Wrong, it‚Äôs an opinion.
---
Pp
---
Where's the rest of the clip?
---
You have to think more is what it adds. Fuxe the site and have your teammates rush in? They wont take damage while enemies are running around trying to take cover. Thats bs. Unfotunately some ppl are just toxic and abuse FF. Find some ppl in the r6 discord to play with.
---
Sounds like a whole lot of broke
---
So either you think that this was a regular match were people on opposing teams were working together to make this clip OR you think this was a match where 9 people made a custom game and few were messing around to make this clip.
---
I'm reposting I clipped it too short
---
I don't understand Elites anymore. Most of the time they are nods to history in some way, like a vintage version of the operator's country or CTU. Obviously this is harder to see with Smoke's, Ela's, and most importantly Lesion. What's the deal with those?
---
Hmm

Watching the flairs change live in this thread is very interesting.

To be fair, it's doing better than you are. At least it can make its own decisions.

Well now you can play unranked :) especially if you care about winning
---
Where is this going to be available? Twitch, youtube, both?
---
I‚Äôve been ddosed 8 times today; would‚Äôve been champions by now
---
So let me drone the window I‚Äôm gonna jump through which already draws attention to it, then let me shoot my grappling hook that can be heard from across the map at said window, then let the window break before I‚Äôm even there so I can get pre fired, good logic
---
Rip ace
---
Later n word
---
:( Hurts a little bit.
---
My favourite spot ever WAS on old Kanal ;\_; Second floor under the control room you could do a nasty setup.
---
New Hereford has a good one if you're main floor - build offsite in the dead end room with the drop hatch. If you're playing bedroom, you can put Miras in the adjacent room looking in and guard both outside approaches at once.
---
Chalet looking into kitchen/staircase from the trophy room.
---
Don't be afraid to move like 1 room adjacent to site and guard the approaches if site itself isn't too good for Mira windows.
---
That's not a "disadvantage" thats toxicity. It happens on defence too.
---
 Attacking first has no inherent difference from defending first.
---
That's how it works. But i'm not talking about people that queue up with obvious cheaters to get boosted, i'm talking about those that people queue up with someone that can't be identified as a cheater clearly. That's the problem with the way it works
---
No the system makes perfect sense. Judging everything off kills is retarded, otherwise thermite would never be picked and diamond would literally just be 5v5 ash mains.
---
Vote to kick has always been there though
---
/u/UbiNoty is there something we need to do on our end?
---
J agree that she should be able to grapple to more places, but I disagree with the weapon draw speed needing a buff because it would be frustrating if she could immediately kill you after entering a room, but she is new so it's too early to know for sure if this would be overpowered 
---
I'll say that she would be great with smoke grenades (I don't think she has any but could be wrong)
---
Had a game like this in unranked today. One person on the enemy team could move and he spawn peeked everyone as a doc...
---
I remember doing something similar in Halo 3 with the alien carbine. Just mags everywhere.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt you are the only who thinks that there should be some more gritty siege content coming out from ubi instead of lame lORe dummy characters. I think the ops are okay but I agree the cinematic is lame. More gunfights and I hope the upcoming siege spinoff shows a lot of grit and good story for the characters from the base game.
---

I‚Äôm not saying kills should be everything. I‚Äôm not trying to say that at all. But wins should not be everything, and that‚Äôs how it seems it‚Äôs going.

You need to wash your hands after that play, that was dirty lol

I suppose I can see that but even then, that would absolutely nullify a run out. If attackers are given wallhacks as soon as a defender runs out they might as well not allow defenders outside at that point.
---
She shouldn't have ridiculous draw time, but at the moment it's a little slow
---
Why are you playing casual?
---
im definitely getting the money heist vigil
---
Why tf am I getting downvoted ? I literally just said he has posted this before ( which he has ).
---
Ubisoft seem to forget the roots of Rainbow Six. In the book theyre an elite group of CTUs. The story is dark and gritty. The fanmade version captures that nicely, while the ember rise clip looks like something out of Overwatch...
---
Are you suggesting they either draw all the operators with all the headgears? Or that they render the operators in the selection screen? Because both sound like a lot of work

I think they should allow her to grapple to more in door spots first and if she's too weak then they should consider a buff to the weapon draw speed
---
That's retarded. I'm a literal Ash/Bandit main, but even I acknowledge that kills aren't everything. Wins SHOULD be everything, otherwise people won't play to win.
---
OMG HOOOWWWW???!! This makes no sense lol it should count as you killing them
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but if Ubisoft made it so when a server gets DDOS'd both teams should lose MMR, after all if you remove their incentive to DDOS why would they?
---
It‚Äôs just a custom one I put in.
---
I'm crashing on PC
---
also probably don't want to add the "random joining mid/late match" factor. So, having leaving penalty makes the occurrence of having to replace teammates a non-issue..? and makes matchmaking easier, I guess.
---
Rainbow is magic was the best game mode they ever added change my mind.
---
Just tried to kill battleye (Uninstalling and closing in task manager) nothing has changed. Thanks for trying to help though!
---
I just got DDOSed out of a game.
---
Then drone
---
This season I'm waiting a few weeks before I start my placements. It's more likely that I'll encounter less of this garbage.
---
thought of that too...was just an idea
---
 PLEASE, WE WANT OLD KANAL, NIGHT VERION!! :/  
---
TY and share it pleasse ;)
---
I know that, im talking about the *forbidden act*
---
How can game developers let this stuff into the final launch of a game? Baffles me. Game company‚Äôs please hire me, I won‚Äôt fuck up
---
Get Zofia for Attacked and Lesion for defender
---
did you use the deep dream algorithm on nokk's logo and glass
---
It's 150 bullets to total ammo, not 50 bullets to each magazine.
---
I just got DDOSed on PC, you‚Äôre not alone on console trust me

Is there a reason to not? Lol

Frost would be good addition to your arsenal

Yes I know. It was in the patch notes.

Lifeguards be like ..

If the guy is clearly queueing up with someone that use cheats explicitly, that should 100% ban him. But what about those cases where you queue up with someone that you can't say that is obviouly cheating? Is it fair to be banned for that?
---
"Oh, are you approaching me?"

.....

"No for real I cant hear anything"

Uh

Good job man
---
Maestros might suit you for defence bullet proof cams with lasers and a lmg primary
---
You could try validating the files in steam, it's possible the installation corrupted the game somehow. Otherwise a fresh install would be worth a shot

He got lagged out.

I deranked to copper 4 in para bellum and made it back to plat 3.
---
You're getting better. Keep going! Don't be mad when you get wrecked at higher levels it makes you better. There was a time when i'd see plat players and be like, "welp im screwed." and now i'm a plat player who has beat up on some diamonds. It's a steep curve, but it's such a rewarding feeling when you realize you've progressed!
---
Haha
---
It's not a realistic scenario for a group in a custom game to mess around and kill hostage? Have you ever played with friends before?
---
It‚Äôs funny bc butt n jojo
---
Because putting a laser on someone's head and then quickly ads and fire isn't string at all. They basically became the equivalent of BB with a better shield and shittier guns.

---
Oh that‚Äôs a good idea. Never though about that
---
And then your teammate leaves, forcing you to pay a 4v5. That shit pissed me off the most.
---
This is why I stopped playing Ranked on Xbox.
---
But even yesterday, we were DoSed in both Unranked and Casual. One guy even had 'destroying servers since 2003' as his name if you clicked on his gamertag. 3 of them had Guy Fawkes masks as profile picture, absolute fucking losers.
---
Sort of. I also forgot to mention watch out if its opened by a teammate becuz you can get killed from attackers
---
Why would they do that tho
---
legendary bait
---
Why would they do that
---
Yeah I viewed frame by frame.. you shot from his left shoulder across to his right.
---
His operator icon.
---
I know. 
---
But I just lost my shit about being DDOSed in goddamn Casual (who the fuck does that?!?!) so I posted a long complaint on r/xboxone to try and draw a bit of attention to the issue.
---
Oh
---
Yeah, that was until Burnt Horizon but were only up to Velvet Shell headgears
---
Fuze is Uzbek
---
Are you a moron or did you just bang your head really hard today?

When did it come? How many hours ago?

Do u Play with mnk? Or is it just high sensitivity?

Where is this tradition from?

Really! I don't understand why Doc spawnpeeks everytime...

Ehh, as shit as they are DoS attacks are better than hackers.
---
The faster it goes the higher chance of death

ddosing only works on console, right?

Very niceu Caesar-chan

Look at how fast I go down. It's literally one shot for me.

or under subreddit card on right "EDIT FLAIR"
---
Ok I guess I‚Äôll get both since they are only 10000 renown
---
Sometimes they have an angle on someone and die or the enemy leaves as they open it
---
With how much of an issue mav was for being silent, you'd think people would be okay with loud gadgets.
---
Why waste 25 seconds of our time on you running around? Trim the clip.
---
That spot is always funny for claymores kill though.
---
But it forces you to actually push to the defuse the bomb quicker?

Omg as a Thermite Main I‚Äòd love to have black ice for his ar

I wish for it to be a placebo but something does feel off.

I know right? T-Hunt is a fucking joke. Solo renown is a joke.
---
I don't mind when it's mere seconds. The problem is when we're over a minute and there is still loading going on.
---
It was probably Ember Rise coming out
---
Ubi really needs to find a good anti cheat not some shitty version of battle eye, one that can detect cheaters and if a servers being stressed

Give Amaru 5 nitro cells.
---
Same thing happened to me with kapkan. This I like the new pop socket
---
It could be worse
---
omfg shE THICC
---
The real question is who detonates nitro cells as soon as they land? The point of using them is to wait until the right time to get a kill.
---
Stand User: CAV 
---
Stand Name: Silent Steps
---
It‚Äôs a federal offense
---
Had a guy earlier this morning put one up in bedroom of ClubHouse and actually stood on the other side of it while I'm firing from the window. Easy hilarious kill
---
‚ÄúSiege Free Weekend‚Äù
---
stat websites are lowkey high af
---
Oh i havent got the update
---
People are banning them in ranked too. F for season pass owners.
---
After 3 minutes your chances of getting into a game is the chance of pewdiepie losing 50 million subs
---
Excuse me what
---
Yup. I mind less about the banning at least it's not just pure stupidity.
---
High sensitivity
---
What are you on about? Lol
---
I respect you opinion however here's my take. 
---
&gt;They're abilities are overall useless and more of a disadvantage and a nuisance than anything else to the team. 
---
I disagree
---
&gt;Amaru uses her hook to go up to a window or hatch and just die instantly
---
Those people are using her wrong I've taken teams completely by surprise with her ability she's so quick at scaling buildings that she is a perfect counter to run outs and peakers on some maps because she can get to the roof before the defenders can.
---
You have to use her smart and it's going to take people time to learn how to do that.
---
&gt;and almost all the time she takes the defuser and ends up being the reason the team lost.
---
This is not a problem on hostage or secure area plus the defuser can be dropped and handed off to a new person.
---
&gt;Her ability not only makes the game more annoying to play, but also does not fit in with what Rainbow Six Siege is generally about.
---
How is this the case? This is a tactical shooter game, grapple hooks are a very believable and useful gadget compare that to the near magic tracking of Jackal or the silent step abilities of Nokk and Cav. Just because you don't like it or because people don't know how to use it does not mean it does not fit in the game.
---
&gt;Goyo is also another liability that should be removed. His Volcan Shield is just more reason why playing hostage is horrible, along with fuze being notorious for killing the hostage, now we have another operator that does it more effectively and with no consequences to Goyo unless he himself shoots or melees the shield.
---
He's only a liability if played wrong it's simple don't use him on cramped hostage maps, also don't place the vulcans sheild any where near the hostage. Side point if the attackers are trying to recover a hostage alive booby trapping the hostage adds a new element to the tactics see it preventing attackers spraying in the rooms since doing so could kill the hostage.
---
&gt;In unranked and ranked playlists I almost always see Goyo get banned and when I play casual, anyone that picks him is either team killed or vote kicked, or they end up killing one of his teammates or himself.
---
This just can't be helped. The same happened to leigon. 
---
&gt;Overall I think the general idea of Goyo and Amaru were neat, but they need to be removed or at least nerfed.
---
This is never going to happen tbf.
---
&gt;but they need to be removed or at least nerfed. Given, I don't know how you would nerf Amaru
---
Some people are asking for a buff to her to allow her to grapple to more locations or to draw a weapon faster after grappling. So I doubt a nerf is coming anytime soon.
---
&gt;Goyo needs to just be removed without second though. Give the good people that got the season pass some renown in compensation for the changes and just do away with them. 
---
Why? Just because you and some people don't like him/can't use him effectively doesn't mean other can't. Deleting a character that people have paid real money for just isn't gonna happen.
---
I'm sure Amaru and Goyo will be deleted from ranked and unranked untill the next ops come out and are subsequently banned for a season.
---
Because it was stale. The sites were all held/attacked in the same way, hence why it was removed. It‚Äôs not like the map was bad or uncompetitive, it‚Äôs the most competitive map in the game.
---
Grenade ashcharge zofia if you knock someone into it with a nomad charge lol multiple ways
---
Had this happen to me the other night on PC. It was a high silver/low gold game so I can't imagine it was anyone in our game. I don't know much about servers so someone please correct me if Im wrong, but I assume that the servers Ubi uses host multiple matches at once, so if someone starts stressing the server like this would it affect all the games taking place on it?
---
Explosives innit
---
Impacts and shotguns are for making holes. Nitro cells are for damage, or for blowing a hole in a wall while you hide around the corner.
---
Hope they change it back
---
Chalet is big bad.
---
The song got me disappointed. Why you gotta do that to roundabout?
---
I think I read the same thing 4 hours ago already
---
You can buy it in the shop but its like 20000
---
No I got that update yesterday. Early this morning there was a small patch I guess.
---
Only if they actually buff him like they promised back in Y2
---
Kinda lol
---
I have never met someone who likes new Hereford
---
When I get ddossed, they stress it only just enough so that we cant move on attack and cant prep for the round. We always lose elo and they gain it. Really sucks
---
First day of the new season I was doing my placement games and I was on coastline. This random picked amaru and instantly grappled into penthouse (which was an objective). We somehow won that round but I can‚Äôt say it went well for him
---

---
Your first comment doesn't make too much sense tbh. Just don't get banned?
---
Cool, you‚Äôve been bad since the beginning
---
Mouf fuxk* FTFY
---
Honestly I think the map is way better than before and the defenders have to run further to get an angle on you. So you have more time to pre-aim the spots once you know where they are.
---
I enjoy it, might also be nostalgia value as it was the first map I ever learned well.

You should try the kids dorms on oregon. So few people sit in there (maybe 1 or 2) so if you can get up there then you have good control instantly if they are defending top floor.
