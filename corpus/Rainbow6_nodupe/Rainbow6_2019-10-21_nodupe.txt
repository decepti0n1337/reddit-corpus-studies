I stopped playing bc of ppl like this
---
---
---
It‚Äôs the warden seasonal weapon skin from operation phantom sight
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt speak putting skins on my main makes her useless
---
They're shite anyhow, don't fret
---
LOL. Ubi already posted patch notes for the next big update. Including a lot that contradict all these. So screw off you fake ass man. Maybe you should do some research before making fake stuff.

Shield broke, head sticks out past your pov
---
If you can‚Äôt win a 4v5, especially at your rank, you shouldn‚Äôt be playing the game
---
yea i always tried classic but the bombers would always gang rush me.
---
The new ranked should be a separate mode IMO. It's too different for that to be the sole competitive offering in a game like this.
---
Call it Pro Ranked or something, seeing as that's where the rule set comes from.
---
Did ubi change something? I've run into this issue multiple times now, on different maps the worst yet being the banner in west main lobby on chalet.
---
Implying that the hard breach isn‚Äôt banned in comp play, two extra reinforcements changes the game ALOT at higher level play. Defense already has enough of an advantage, they don‚Äôt need anymore
---
It‚Äôs not about winning. It‚Äôs crappy when it happens to the other team as well.
---
They shut down the servers
---
I do but that doesn‚Äôt look like rainbow
---
Or she might get a wedding dress. Why? Mostly because a bride would wear a veil that conceals the face's identity. So that elite outfit still makes for N√∏kk because it abides with her nature of keeping hidden.
---
The problem with Nokks is that would also buff smoke and he seems very balanced where he is
---
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt win with one hand tied behind your back, you don‚Äôt deserve your rank‚Äù FTFY
---
If you knew what Rainbow looked like then you‚Äôd know that that‚Äôs what it looks like when you check your stats through the Ubisoft club
---
You want to acknowledge her by her real name?
---
pay 2 win
---
I don‚Äôt understand
---
Tbh, smoke almost never uses the fmg9 due to his shotgun/smg combo he has.
---
OMG! monstrous aim üëèüèªüëèüèª
---
If you‚Äôre too fragging consistently but still losing, you‚Äôre not playing the objective correctly
---
Just cause you dont like it doesnt mean everyone else doesnt like it.
---
The pick and ban was highly requested feature that was tested before adding into the main rank mode. It was received by positive feedback from the community. 
---
The animation changes were done for backend changes that are commonly made to fix backend issues that help them keep updating the game and keep it running for the future 10 year goal.
---
Something something get shot in the head 3 steps out of spawn
---
I also play on console(ps4) I‚Äôm pretty use to it, I put a compositer and angle grip  on it
---
This except headshottting using an entire mag and getting killed by them
---
&gt;Not to mention how good C7E is and how even a dog could use his overpowered ability.
---
I mean ... Jackal is a breed of dog ...
---
He‚Äôs already being nerfed, but in a good way, high risk high reward, low risk low reward
---
Figured that.  All i know is we need a solo que mode .
---
I think his gadget is still great 
---
specially when you plant the defuser
---
Siege is the one game where one guy won‚Äôt be able to carry the team to a win. I‚Äôm sure you know already that solo queuing is not a good idea and it never will be. Just don‚Äôt solo queue, end of story.
---
jesus fuck that's overpowered but then if you have iq, it's also countered easily.
---
speaking of which, warden's ability should work like that hahaha
---
Twitch? Tf
---
Nomad is definitely s and clash being so low is debatable but other than that I can‚Äôt really disagree.
---
He stuck it back in. Reload cancels happen.
---
I ask forgiveness
---
It's down...
---
Hit your shots bro
---
Oh, I personally love her weapons
---
Those Mira placements kinda hurt me
---
Ask yourself after defuser is placed do you prefer to have Lion that will make them stop for 2.5 sec or Nomad Gridlock that will make them lose much much more time + they can die and their gadget will have imact.
---
agreed
---
I think he‚Äôs great could be S but choose to put him in A
---
Jaeger
---
Vigils already on both teams. Just under a different name.
---
RATTLE ME BONES
---
I dont know why people say jackal is op, he's really easy to counter but then again I used to main jackal
---
I feel like castle is atlest a b. The amount of shit you can make them waste just trying to open a window or door can be mading
---
I like to try new things in casual.
---
You sure he wasn‚Äôt banned/picked?
---
Bombers are gone finally. Terrorist hunt is awful at preparing players for PVP; Automatic nitro rooms, bombers, no default cams, the terrorists flinch when shot. 
---
Terrorist hunt can be fun, sure, but it does an awful job of preparing players for PVP
---
Restart your game
---
I was in casual. I‚Äôm checking operators and he‚Äôs locked.
---
just you, randoms have always been trash
---
I did. I‚Äôm gonna try restarting my PS4.
---
üò¢ bro im such a bot in casual compared to rank i much rather play unranked at this point.
---
L
---
Kinda but I cant put a sight on it
---
Now this is the gameplay we need
---
you have a good point 
---
can‚Äôt really disagree
---
Solo que at your ranks risk.
---
Try contacting Ubisoft Customer Support.
---
I know it‚Äôs your opinion and all, but why is Monty S tier, I main the man and he‚Äôs NOT that strong
---
Getting rid of crutch ops is a bad thing? That should bring more balance to the game.
---
NO, THIS IS PATRICK!
---
It‚Äôs giving you a 2nd chance for picking the 417
---
a tried many times to play her but i just can‚Äôt 
---
I always die the first with her
---
It could also be Yuri
---
Yeast
---
**FEET**
---
Nice
---
Shield didn't break, you can visually see the shield alive and together as I die
---
Harry is best boi
---
Why?
---
You might want to tell your friend to only have holographic sights on shotguns. But yeah I thought one of my friends had a bad aim and when I started siege.
---
Queuetimes.exe have jacked to 100
---
"You can stop worrying about terroists now"
---
And make already ridiculous queue times even longer?  It‚Äôs a no from me
---
Gridlock in C?
---
Who‚Äôs mike?
---
Who‚Äôs yuri?
---
Who‚Äôs joe?
---
Anytime you want really. A smurf account is just another copy of the game. But here is thing, this is not a fragging game. This is a objective based game so it's great that you are fragging out but you need to stay alive to win the rounds instead trying to get kills. Don't runnout on the last guy even if it s 5 v 1. Play safe, if your team is full a morons who want to runnout to kill the last guy then u need to be the guy who is just waiting in obj for rest of the time left no matter what time left. 2mins or 30 secs hold obj. If attacking don't hunt for kills. play obj kill players on obj makle sure it is clear and plant even when ityou have the greater num on atk. The amount times i have seen people loose round cus they go kills is high.
---
I hit my shots perfectly but still get no hit reg. My friends have seen it and it's happened to them too
---
Well shit, did they recently change it? I remember trying to add this exact flair I have and was told by multiple users it was not available on mobile. Guess they updated it, sorry for the confusion.
---
Ligma balls
---
R6S is a very popular game, it could easily handle a map queue system (especially because the majority of the players will gravitate towards actual good maps, so the queue times for good maps will not be long.)
---
Because he‚Äôs hot.
---
Reminds me of a stealth game, silently taking down some enemy soldiers walking in a one by one line.
---
No, thank you that sounds awful. I would welcome this feature in unranked and casual tho.
---
You are wrong.
---
Think of him as sexy Amanda Waller
---
I don‚Äôt really give a damn about French fries but if someone offered some for free I wouldn‚Äôt just smack it out of their hands and call em a dick head for it
---

---
417 op
---
He shot you in the noggin.
---
Yes, we need more art in Siege, /u/Hentai_Is_Art_69
---
My big problem with this is the color change. Color can be used to quickly communicate to players who is on your team, who is on the enemy team at a glance. With more monotone colors you have to take that extra half second to check the characters
---
Cav is in wildlands... and if you complete her mission and wear her gloves, all your melee kills are done like cav interrogations
---
Ridiculous queue times? Siege is by no means an unpopular game, it could easily handle a queue system (especially as aforementioned the majority of the playerbase will gravitate towards good maps, so if anything it could potentially lower them)
---
Did you win?
---
Pre sure this is still bannable
---
This is breakpoint
---
Me and my 3 stack have been getting bot randoms that leave after one loss even if we have point advantage. We finished Gold 2 last season and we‚Äôve lost 6 placement matches in a row so at this point I think we‚Äôre at silver 1 :(
---
But yes. I loved that about wildlands
---
BOSG ACOG

Hello Tranqxal, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dkt5mt/i_dont_even_main_ash/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
X
---
Because the game is not made for TDM.  The goal is to attack/ defend an obj. Half of the attacking ops will be useless. Most of the defenders as well. Also, it‚Äôs not needed. It‚Äôs not call of duty.
---
That's what I'm saying; crutch ops are bad, but they do exist - and being able to just get rid of them like that doesn't really work, because you need them - otherwise it's too in favour of the other team.
---
Operator&gt; cosmetics.
---
Yoink
---
All ways wondered that as well.
---
Ha, you‚Äôre funny. Sadly no I didn‚Äôt. Was forced to surrender. I didn‚Äôt want to get shit on anymore than I had to
---
Worst part about it is it was my last placement game and I had been tracking my MMR and if I wine that game I would‚Äôve been placed in plat. Guess Ubisoft just don‚Äôt like me
---
God i hope her elite has a karambit or a balisong.
---
It‚Äôs a no from me. Introducing a game mode like this in siege that just encourages players solely to hunt for frags is going to influence their decision making when they‚Äôre playing the regular game modes.  
---
There‚Äôs enough ranked gunners who only play for KD as it is. 
---
I‚Äôd much prefer a solo training area/range that you can individually address tracking. Flicking and situational awareness. 
---
I really don‚Äôt like the concept that my ability to properly warm up in a game entirely depends on other players around me. I‚Äôd much prefer a neutral solo mode.
---
YES
---
No not really, I'm guessing they were firing back at the Thatcher
---
No, no snapping or tracking you through walls. 
---
Wrong place wrong time in my eyes buddy.
---
Nope, just you
---
the only pro league skins available are the ones out currently. then they're gone
---
It‚Äôs only on Oregan that I‚Äôve noticed this. This specific painting for some reason. It‚Äôs indestructible and totally fucks up rotation holes. 
---
What happens with you? Is there other bugs that I‚Äôm just missing?
---
client side debris, Ubisoft aint gonna fix it ~~till 2020~~
---
Not really its so much easier to do anything on pc i never realised how easy pc flicks would be but uts still a nice shot
---
This is one of my more sane monty moments I wish I recorded some of my more illogical moments
---
Sk its not just me THANK YOU my freinds were saying they didnt see it to mess with me
---
I found it nice lol thanks
---
that would be cool, and you can switch attachments in game like warface I think?
---
smg-11 is basically a primary it‚Äôs really fucking good especially on pc cause i just laser kids who have acogs.
---
Outstanding.
---
That's a twist
---
People finally found out that we get shit attachments and we really need more attachments please ubisoft why is ACOG the only good thing ubisoft please god why
---
It would be kinda interesting. I'll never forget when BB first released a defender got him VIA some glitch, I can only imagine spawn peeks and being immune to a headshot would be fun af.
---
Don't fight a shotgun up close
---
I think it would be cool if you could edit attachmens during prep faze
---
also shotguns don‚Äôt need a buff imo all the pumps are very reliable and viable. the semi autos used to be op as hell. aka the sniper 90 and pulse with the semi auto shotty was very op.
---
What if she rushes you while stimed?
---
I try. And then i die.
---
I love to see it. #GetBetterAim
---
And maybe a suppresser you could take on and off of your gun but it would slow your ads
---
Headshots kill
---
Ya would die to the north spawn if they are really fast too.
---
I've definitely experienced this little guy. But only just recently, it also happens in West Main Lobby of Chalet. There's a big vertical painting (or whatever it is), I tried sledging through the wall to get into trophy. The painting didn't break, same as this, and completely stopped me from entering trophy.
---
Half the roster would become useless
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah I know. Just one of those times where I completely potatoed.
---
xbox record that
---
AAAND there's also my sub monitor. It supports up to 120hz.
---
I don't think their aim is the problem a pump shotgun should at least down from that distance
---
I see no aggression..
---
holo/reflex don‚Äôt exist i guess? and why do we need more attachments. the barrels are fine i guess suppressor and extended barrel could get buffed as they are terrible but everyone will probably still just use flash hider as it‚Äôs the best hands down. there‚Äôs no point in adding in more sights it‚Äôs pointless really people want a less zoomed scope like 1.5x but it will literally break siege and be meta changing.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you show the kill cam?!?
---
Proceeds to get common duplicate
---
FO12, then.
---
if you can‚Äôt kill someone rushing you with a shotgun you‚Äôre just bad lol
---
I think we sould have all sights available on all guns, I don't think any russian op mains would complain about missing their unique sights
---
Purple tinge.
---
It is possible. It happened to you and it happens to a lot of people
---
Now im imagining Kaid in a maid costume.

---
Gonna keep it real with you, I completed that t-hunt at bronze 1 a year ago.
---
If you aren‚Äôt doing it solo, it‚Äôs extremely easy.
---
Edit, I see you did it solo. Well done
---
Find friends to play with
---
4 seconds for the ‚Äúround won‚Äù ending
---
i have zero clue what u just said
---
Not a bug, it jumps up to 4 seconds for the ‚Äúround won‚Äù end phase.
---
Super long? It's not even 30 seconds. Maybe I'd see the concern if it was like, 2-3 minutes, but a 30-40 sec video is tiny.
---
Buck:Where's my gun

Glaz:Hehe

I thought Overwatch was toxic, but R6 is a whole other level.

Lol I qued up after a real rowdy ranked match with some randoms and the next match we were all put on opposite teams. So we got all 10 of us in a party together with the new teammates and had a real shit show of a match. 
---
Most fun I‚Äôve had in a game in a long time.

Oh connector and meeting? Yeah that's unbreakable. Probably a glitch.

Advice on how to kill a stationary Monty with his shield up:
---
Go prone at his feet, rotate to the side so your not pointing your gun right at him, then lean into him.
---
You'll lean right through his shield and can kill him.
---
This usually requires other teammates to be aggressive so he can't just melee you.
---
Call me harry
---
Not to mention Modern Warefare is 175 GB big, so good luck playing it on launch day.
---
Thanks, my lord
---
Lmao someone got their cheeks clapped

Imagine this: You dont know about the event and all your team goes with Trap ops
---
You can say, "he is part of elite sledge club now."
---
when u salty
---
I can understand getting frustrated with Jackal because of his recent overuse and overpowered kit but why Ash?
---
My favourite part was how you saved a screenshot but then just took a photo of your screen.
---
A few seasons of diamond, competitive experience in scrims vs t2-3 teams, activity in leagues, g04s, etc. And of course contacts.
---
A lot of moving up in the comp scene is about building your own little brand.
---
Ela shotgun on attack? The F2 spawnpeeking me? I‚Äôm gonna have to hard pass on that goofy shit
---
How did you grab your cam so fast?
---
Hope they do add it. It would be a nice QOL change.
---
Looks pretty good, but for PL it just has to be the default op icons for recognition purposes
---
Hope so, either that or a defusing strat I havent heard of lmao

I understand the meme but I cannot tell what is happening in the picture.
---
Probably a shoulder and or neck shot
---
You were never supposed to be able to.  It was an unintended exploit.
---
Fair enough
---
Rocket league actually bans those people tho
---
Sun imo
---
The amount of times you look away in siege for a split second to then get shot in the head is something quite annoying but funny as well.
---
Yes
---
With the new twitch nerf this wont be possible in the future.
---
Neither
---
I meant one person
---
She just has a bad cold.
---
Russia is cold, I heard.
---
I honestly have no idea.
---
That'll just inspire squads to have a person leave when they think they're gonna lose ELO
---
Thanks, i moved my phone instead of scrollling up and now, people behind me thought i was having a wank.
---
Ive got a few hundred of hours but i didnt know this thx
---
If you call defenders campers, please stop playing
---
Work on your operator knowledge then come back champ.
---
Region ?
---
Why even engage with the battle pass. Thanks for making the future of this game worse. Go back to fortnite
---
White. It looks really good on a lot of the guns and most of the guns no skin is black or grey anyways
---
US
---
That would be super cool to have on my shelf lol nice work!
---
Technically it‚Äôs not a bosg but close enough for me
---
There doesn't even need to be a zone. Old school survival was you needed to kill all opposition forces. 8v8. We had an entire clan and gaming site built around this. R.I.P. Darkest Winter. Ubi needs t bring it back.
---
That is not a Acog
---
Get in line I hvae been complaining of that since like early 2016
---
Anyhow Ubi has stated they plan on getting that changed in 2020
---
Ah, I m far away.
---
Remaster rainbow six Vegas!
---
Thanks for trying to help
---
This battle pad is a test, it has been said many times. This is a trial for the main battle pass they are going to introduce in Y4S4 and this is just to see if it is working well.
---
I like this but I don‚Äôt understand it
---
Why does she have a 1911 in her portrait picture? We just don't know

this isn't a spawnpeek, this is a mid-late game runout

Every time I play monty I die from getting shot in the back by a teammate.

Mag fed, pump action, scoped shotgun. Its beautiful
---
Swear to God. Overwatchs community looks so fucking good right now. I seriously dont understand how these ubisoft, cock suckling goons can accept this.
---
I would have rage quit
---
He's probably going to be banned a lot more in ranked if people know what types of prints to scan if they're looking for an op who's off site e.g.  pulse and caveria.

Maybe we should start smth like #UbiFixScorpion? :D

Thanks. I will ask him that
---
What if they increase the head shot multiplier on the single pellet that always lands dead centre?
---
Haha die gibt's bei mir im Kik
---
Ye I know
---
If there is a download do you need to stay in the game while it downloads or not, because he has had the game for over a week now and it still doesn't work?
---
That is a lot. And while I can appreciate all this in a game, it would fundamentally change Siege to a point that would be bad for the player base. Like this would have to be something in it's own game, especially when you consider changing damage stats for guns and creating a system for bleed outs and bodily damage.
---
Makes sense. Just make everyone recruit I guess.
---
That‚Äôs GENIUS!!!
---
I think you need a bit more practice with the fake patch notes hahaha
---
Ubi said they don't like the fragging potential of twitch and they are gonna buff her dmg and rpm *lmao sure*
---
These posts are always a good laugh.

You can't stop can you

Fuck you

Nice, reminds me of little keenu

nah, i would say metal gear did. snake got an eyepatch on his right eye. and there is a similar meme with him too
---
Forgive me sir for my foolish words please don't banish me
---
I can try to whip something up, but the quality probably won't be great (the video compression I get is bad, still figuring this out). But experience-wise I can give a lot of small tips for each operator, if that is what you and your friend are after.
---
Let‚Äôs not use sexual assault to make memes how about that?
---
People laugh at this kind of stuff everywhere. And even worse. If you don't like it, don't read it move away.
---
You're the dumb ass that comes to ruin everyone else's night and eventually gets kicked out aren't you ?
---
*Every* recoil is fine if u get the headshot
---
That gun is busted. So much ammo to open up a whole site. 1-2 shots anything and has auto fire
---
I'd also like to have something

Do u think he got higher rank than coppar 5? Imagine being coppar 5, am i right?
---
Hell no
---
Badum tss
---
Is that just me, or is one of them volcan‚Äôs symbol
---
hopefully we have new weapon on him, an he looks mute which is nice to me
---
Normally, I don't play agressive and rarely I go outside (because I die hahaha) but I never kill teammates for agressive play! 
---
But if you can get a 4-0 and start another match, what is the reason to make a 4-1 or 4-2? I have been losed so many matches having 3-0 for this kind of stupidities

Vigil is 3 speed, he could‚Äôve made it in time from the other side

Adderall is a hell of a drug üòÇ good job though

means a lot, man XD
---
Yeah I meant maid but tbh he kinda looks like Alfred peneyworth so its all good
---
I think they might break out old operators from older games to seige but how they look and feel will be different because most of them were spread throughout globe
---
isn‚Äôt it kinda ‚Äûweird‚Äú in a conspiracy way that this sticker is right in the middle of the picture
---
Wait what
---
What is QoL means? Quality of Life?
---
So me ending the game with 15 kills while you are in the bottom with 2 is not carrying? 
---
Atleast i have a normal hitbox
---
That‚Äôs a good shout
---
They give you win?
---
1000 mmr I believe
---
Carrying means doing it in succession (over and over again) even you have 1 kill games and i have 11 kill games aswell.
---
There is no 8v8 survival mode.
---
Yeah
---
1000 mmr from the highest person in the squad
---
Thanks
---
Alright thank you!
---
Thanks!
---
A lot of the time people don‚Äôt only leave because they have to or they choose to, there is a weird glitch where if you cancel looking for a game it will still queue you for a few seconds and if it finds a game in the server you joined but you won‚Äôt actually connect to it and you‚Äôll never know. This happens a lot especially on console where we enter games with 2 players and it happens to us where only one of joins after cancelling queueing so they end up playing a round with only one player
---
You should have just let it go.
---
It freezes right? And doesn't let you go back?
---
I vigorously press escape and click on the game part of the screen to get out.
---
Ah yes the C7E. So good I cant even come up with a good joke about this clip that doesn't make the gun sound bullshit.
---
I was so incredibly tempted, ngl
---
Why would you white out your own name, you obviously didn't draw this. To the actual artist, good job!
---
Flash landed right Infront of the shield, and the new shields allow the full flash effect to pass through the shield.
---
Just downed player, not enemy, send anyone you see down to Vahalla in a glorious blaze.
---
Nah its fine. Just go on the windows and you get free kills. Always bring hibana because you can camp outside while shooting into site. If you don‚Äôt bring a hard breacher then it gets defender sided
---
Would make it easier to solo fuze. Not that it cant be done now but it helps to have someone watching your back
---
Yes thats the point, he will make the kapkan "suicide"
---
Bro I once did this to a downed player through a reinforced wall. I used a claymore to down them tho, through the reinforced wall! Good times.
---
Skyscraper is fine. I have no problem defending and attacking on that map.
---
Chalet is eh
---
Yea, and it ruins the rotation, hope they nerf him soon.
---
Ur on console. Foh
---
And I thought I'm unlucky in this game
---
Do crazy shit like running out or going somewhere so far away from the obj that you won‚Äôt be expected. If you get a good play then you will usually get at least a second to act before they find or see you.
---
Idk your region, but on WEU I never have problems finding a match, 1 / 2 minutes max.
---
The problem is people like this guy who don't restart the queue after a few minutes and gets into an infinite loop.
---
My friends always kill me for playing aggressive because apparently mid game run outs are extremely toxic...
---
Beware with this method. A Mav was doing this to me on Skyscraper in Geisha. I just waited until he had done some of the down line and C4'd him through the gap. I think that was my favourite play I've ever made
---
the future is probably right
---
Nope i play pc oooof
---
Welcome to my world
---
Medal of Honor
---
That‚Äôs how a real grenade works. But in most games it‚Äôs usually just a kill radius without The effects of shrapnel
---
he pulled a captain america
---
This needs to be a real subreddit ASAP
---
Well idk if you play with a stack but if you dont i would suggest doing it i play 10 times better when i got my stack with me i dont have to worry about bad teammates and it doesnt mather who the enemies are. It's all about mindset aswell maybe do some unranked casual build confidence and then go into ranked with the feeling that you're better than them. Also if you stop caring if you lose or win will help you alot to stop anxiety and tilting etc. If you ever want to play just hmu.
---
Captain here. You've been playing Rainbow 6: Siege, an Early Access game in pre alpha stage of development made by small indie studio named Ubisoft. It's tehir first game and they are doing their best. Be more forgiving, they are working very hard. I'm pretty sure this is just a small bug, that happend only once, and can't be reproduced by devs nor other players. Keep supporting their hard work though and buy all Elite skins and Premium Battle Pass. They really need this money to feed their families and work even harder on their game.
---
\*Flies away\*
---
Oh yeah, I'm constantly paranoid about the C4.
---
I think he had the right idea. If they broke hatch they would have a decent chance of getting a shot on him. Valk was the one who threw the Nitro Cell btw if you look closely
---
Look like he's vibing tho
---
Okay just gonna say all I use on that gun is the iron sights it's not the right rear sight
---
Had that same scene happen to me at the same wall about 3 times in the last years. Ubi plz
---
It is
---
I almost won a 1v5 ranked, and yes I had to camp
---
New J√§ger ADS just his the grenades back
---
?
---
Pretty bad joke tbh
---
Just dont loose it lol
---
The real joke is that you they shouldn't have huddled up to him, and vigil would've been able to make the rotation to the other side.
---
I wasn't ready
---
the nade is ubisoft putting kanal into ranked
---
Thatcher is a 56 years old guy....time to enjoy your retire Sir, Maverick can do the dirty work for you...
---
Just one thing before leave...you can give your Ar33 to Sledge? He appreciates it so much
---
I felt so proud
---
Basically how all my friends think.
---
That is the deepest Slav squat I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
I think you‚Äôre a Frost main
---
He got reported for that for sure.
---
You kill him through the hole at the same time as he wound you through the wall
---
You have another teammate alive, so you would win even if you die but in a 1v1 you can give a kiss to that wall for saving your life lol
---
Sometimes tk'ing is funny this is not the time. Once when I was teaching my brother to play, I was shooting then reviving the hostage. My teammate shot me in the head, my brother shot the teammate, the 4th teammate shot my brother then the fifth killed him. It was great.
---
Thicc
---
Dude the game is 8 to 4 and there are a lot of other players in the game. What are the odds he staged that whole thing?
---
I don‚Äôt think I was running laser at the time but it‚Äôs unfortunate nevertheless
---
Yep. Here's to hoping.
---
Only the F2 can do something like that...
---
Oh.
---
Missed the joke.
---
Maybe i am
---
Buff the thicc waifu
---
Everyone liked that.
---
I have 3 friends who have mp5k black ice and elites for all my fav ops (including mute and frost) and if they get ela (which is coming out next season) I‚Äôll throw them off a cliff the Scar Mufasa way

It's like the little J√§ger

Cause buddy is for friends, and I'm not good at making friends *cries in corner*.

Historically game updates and events have stuck to a Tuesday/Thursday schedule. 
---
Some operations that have had a one day delay had them drop on a Wednesday, but it's only happened a couple of times before.
---
What the fuck were you trying to do
---
squad rff
---
this is alt+F4 material right here.
---
He ain‚Äôt even broke anymore though
---
alright hopefully this doesn't count as self promotion. i uploaded to gyfcat just like the rules told me to so yeah hopefully this is all good.
---
genuinely a problem that annoys me more than it should. hopefully y'all can't unsee this now either.
---
My personal all-time favorite way to die:   [https://i.imgur.com/KPlweVo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KPlweVo.jpg)   Window was open for him, me, not so much...

ill be your friend :)
---
Oh yea duh
---
Sexist descrimination against anyone who identifies as any other gender, wow, so if I'm trans I can't join, what if I'm gynephilic or don't own a PS4, that means I can't join?????
---
i hope you shot him
---
right?
---
Yaaaaa so much
---
Rainbow is Magic launched on a Monday
---
Her recoild should be better
---
yeah a 2v2, on house 8 - 4... imagine having fun in a game and making a mistake must be fake
---
Rebellious.
---
&gt; never melee unless it's your last option
---
disagree!!
---
I love using [KNFE OFFENSIVELY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu5ICvOU6fs)
---
Yeah, I would love a buff for a recoil or impact back.
---
that doesn't change anything, if they still post content that they didn't make then it's not good content.
---
poopoo
---
Will this be streamed?
---
When you stare at bomb and it not work
---
My last 2 ranked games were 1v5 and 3v5 :(
---
Probably mid season
---
Shotgun
---
With a surplus of nitro cells at the ready.
---
Good, you should never surrender! But, you shouldn't stay fixated on a loss.
---
So if we give the Captain America Super Serum to Recruit, who does he re-emerge as?
---
I approve this message
---
Oh, are you talking about the one that looks at drones on a cell phone?
---
(peek)
---
Oh yes. From my Overwatch experience I‚Äôd say OW is chill. 9/10 times the ppl aren‚Äôt toxic there
---
Feel free to use that line! It gives people a good laugh
---
Suppressors are good. Operators like Sledge and Jackal can use them really well because: 1. If you shoot from above, they cant see where the  bullets are coming from because it hides the trails. 2. You do not get a visual cue from the direction the bullets are coming from on your screen because it hides that as well. Suppressors aren't bad because NeRf DamAgE.
---
Yes yes exactly! And he wears some kind of military gear or whatever. Looks like a special force dude.
---
Map rotation is done once per season when season drops.
---
Shit joke my dude
---
Eh, that's 90% of my humor. Thanks for the positive feedback
---
LMAO was he at low health or was that just a one tap? That was amazing
---
OP you cool and all, and I feel bad for saying this but I wanted to see ya fail
---
I sure will! Lol
---
He should go to Spetznas cause that's one hell of a slav squat
---
It would be so hard to balance that they‚Äôll never do this. 
---
Completely removes the risk of a specific operator dying when you could take it and still use it. Say Thermite. If he dies, it‚Äôs a crucial pick and was a poor play on the Thermite‚Äôs behalf. He should stay dead. 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt then be able to pick it up and use it again as that defeats the purpose. Another issue is that this operator gets zero value until someone dies, which is too niche. 
---
Finally, what speed rating and pre-used weaponry would you like them to have?
---
He's literally pulling on her ankle while she has a dazed look on her face. Have you ever done this?
---
4ms is not as competitive as 1ms tns. There wont be ghosting I suppose with that model because it is not overshooting with 4ms
---
Seems legit
---
ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE
---
I thought the box he was on was his body lmao
---
See you on the battlefield, Judge!
---
For starters, this bitch would've died if you were an actual enemy seeing as she could've been mowed down easily with how shitty her aim is, and how open she was.
---
The sens I use on Console is 81-81 Vert-Horizontal and 41 ADS sense. Works well for me
---
Is there any recoil difference between PC and consoles? Because they have buffed the recoil diamond on PC already.
---
That's Mr. Potato Head to you
---
Yeah if you made it into the building they‚Äôre probably in obj
---
I still catch a grenade for ya
---
Yeah man imagine if custom game allowed you to pick the same operators, mozzie rush/attacc of the midgets would be horrifying.
---
He is not french he is russian
---
How would I upload it my self it's not my clip dipshit
---
Oh well, I'm not a pro gamer anyway, I just want good colors and high resolution for single player games, and the 144Hz refresh rate for games like rainbow six. Getting 2 different monitors is a bit too much for me though, I'm not that competitive.
---
You kidding me? Lol what a grammar nizi here! You just changed a few word. Who take grammar seriously on internet community? I mean, that‚Äôs not bad thing, but come on dude. I did the same thing like you did. To filipino. And i was 16. I‚Äôm not even live in your country but still using english. What a pity.
---
No, someone can just go up to the door and shoot out the miras

That‚Äôs precisely why it was erected.
---
He‚Äôs honestly just vibing tho I‚Äôm chilling he‚Äôs honestly so chill rn
---
Crazy how most of these clutch clips are on console
---
Lame
---
Don't question it...
---
It was erected because you used to be able to stand up there and spawn peek
---
Hes right though, you would rather expect GIGN units to have the same combat boots then having completely different ones, but then having them match boots with special forces with completely different gear.
---
Gotta get this idea in earlier then every other sucker
---
Yeah I get that bug sometimes too. I play on Xbox.
---
It would be it's own mode like the rainbow is magic event.
---
KABOINK
---
It works very well when I am able to set it up. I play solo so people tend to reinforce without instantly despite me telling them to.
---
I was able to win most of the time with this strat by either running down the clock or forcing the enemy to come through the hallway.
---
The downside is that I may need someone dedicated enough to watch hallway. Hard to find someone like that when every just up and leaves the site when it is 2 enemies remaining.
---

Ok how about this infidel, I‚Äôll make an agreement with you, let‚Äôs make a treaty and defeat this emoji using bastard

Proficient is the most difficult word for you? Lol. Get a friend who use english dumbass. Stop fucking aroud here. If there‚Äôs man who are not proficient in english, he/she can read my english. Bc like you said, mine is not ‚Äòproficient‚Äô. Literally same level of english. Please wake up, you are not professor. If you see a person who isn‚Äôt proficient in english and correct 2 or 3 words, that doesn‚Äôt mean you are proficient in english. You just do better bc english is your first language. Stop pretending like you are smart lol. You are just some guy who can speak english and arguing with some asian guy.
---
I know he wasn't hacking, it's just making fun of those who would complain. Anyhow, this is a beautiful moment.
---
Mine is usually the one tossing the grenade
---
This happened to me the other day. I was a Monty and the other guy was a Maverick. After a shot I activated my shield and he kept trying to shoot it. I was in a vc with the Dokkabei on our team so when Maverick got close to melee me he shot him in the head. It was a 5v3 before he tried to kill me
---
Great drawing! But why is he wearing a turban?
---
I imagine it‚Äôd be hard to give defenders drones to switch it around completely so the attackers on defense would still have their drones and defenders on attack would have access to the cams
---
I‚Äôm just laughing cuz u got him down in 1 hit with the Luison
---
I am curious since we didn't see the kill cam, was it a client side bug or server side?
---
Does he have a moustache?
---
üòÇ It was a great spectacle!
---
People say mozzie short
---
Current season shotgun buff + Extended barrel = TCSG12 with a spread
---
Unannounced thermite nerf
---
You lucky lucky bastard :(
---
That makes more sense
---
Actually I don't see many bugs on console, the only one I hate is the bug that makes ranked bomb only and bans operators....
---
Aviator is easier to attack than games, thus making it the attackers‚Äô target. While yes, someone can hold from behind, they‚Äôre bound to rotate back to site if the attackers are decent. Usually when attackers get hold of aviator with 30sec left, the defenders rotate to games and use smokes/c4 in order to plant deny. The mira window into games will only hurt this strategy. Games can be held perfectly fine from vault and bar, making the mira unecessary. Mira window can easily be taken out by a hibana from balcony, forcing you to have a bandit there at all times. Im just plat 1/2 though, so I may be totally wrong.
---
_He could save others but not himself_
---
It's funny for me that if he didn't throw himself on the grenade you wouldn't be hurt at all either.
---
Fantastic beasts and where to find them part three leaked images
---
OP: hey matimio for my sunday mailbox suggestion I think their should be an operator that destroys ceiling fans. His gadget literally just sends ceiling fans to the shadow realm to be tortured for the rest of time.

Just throw a flash hider on it and pull down my dude, flash hider just make all recoil patterns straight (execept ela's, i run angled, reflex and suppressor on it, that thing's broken as FU-).

There‚Äôs no point to surrendering anyway. I‚Äôm not the rest of the night was good with it being my only loss of the night.

Windows/Xbox game bar works fine for me and I didn‚Äôt even have to enable it, just tweaked some settings. I hear shadowplay is tr√©s bien as well
---
If you are getting enraged it‚Äôs 100% your fault my friend.  You aren‚Äôt the only person who runs into toxicity, it‚Äôs everywhere.  Just mute, ignore, and play your game.  If they are griefing then report and move on to your next game.

I would buy that, I like banana

Does it actually prevent damage though? I mean to the other players

Why are they all pushing like dumbasses?

Thats such a lovely idea. I think also they should stop fiddling with Tom Clancy games. He be rolling in his grave. Merry christmas to all.

It‚Äôs so a squad can‚Äôt tk a person over and over basically

A good portion of my tks are teammates running from half way across the map to stick their face into the peek hole I created to see whats so interesting.

Always fun going to the zoo watching how the apes play.
---
You missed my point again lmao. You literally can't fuck around. Unless you are vehemently into dying off spawn or dying very quickly over and over again. Bigger maps are always better because I can spend more of the round playing the game without being forced into a shitty position. It's not fun when you have to fight the map just to move at all.
---
Avenge me brother!

Cav is so fucking easy to deal with, though.

---
Looks great. First I thought it was the M45 FBI pistol.
---
I miss house :(
---
BB is even worse combined with the fact that Nomad exists. Runouts are damn near impossible when she's in play and it's really hard to deal with a good rappelled BB.
---
But it doesn't do anything in Rainbow I guess? Or do bodys lower grenade impact?
---
What if she kills em all
---
I agree with this, I‚Äôm just not sold on ops like Glaz that have selfish gadget uses and can only be good for fragging.
---
Its CASUAL, not ranked, CASUAL, just have some fun, god fucking damn it, people like you are the reason why I get pissed at the game, everybody sweats in casual, thats the superior strat
---
She is as close to a counter we will ever get. If you don't move while her ability is inactive or crawl around you won't leave any footprints. In fact, any defender can crawl around and not leave footprints. It is unlikely they will ever add an operator whose ability is simply just to negate jackal's ability.
---
New client out yesterday on pc. Been dealing with this all night after 2am, shitters need esp to win.
---
Easy mira, she has one of the fastest firing guns in the game, is a 3 armor, has a fantastic gadget, a sidearm shotgun, and C4. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs down to 15,000 or less yet but she came out ages ago so I would hope so.
---
Haha bad lol I‚Äôm plat 2
---
The balancing in this game is getting really sad. Really really badly done, Jager is in almost EVERY SINGLE FUCKING GAME. He deserves a massive nerf, a absolutely massive nerf. 
---
The attacking side is still spreading out with 7 attackers who are above and beyond the rest. All of them need tuning in some way. This is just really really bad, the warden buff won‚Äôt be enough, Glaz still needs more, Nokk is still awful, and Blackbeard needs a rework because it‚Äôs become apparently they can‚Äôt figure out how to balance him
---
Trap operators don‚Äôt need balancing they are rarely ever picked but they are picked when it works. I just had a game on outback where I played lesion to lock down the top of the garage. Everyone jumped in and got hit by the Gus, so the next round I played there with frost, hid myself at the beginning and then placed all my shit. I hit people on every single frost mat and we won the game easily because nobody knew there was a frost.
---
Don't worry little boy with learning disabilities. I don't hold your own rotting brain cells against you. Stupid people like you have to exist to balance the world.
---
They probably play Maestro incorrectly. Remember, these are the same people who think BB and shields are balanced. r6proleague and siegeacademy people are pretty knowledgable.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs completely messed up on ios. Has been for a long while.
---
Five Monty‚Äôs in circle formation push in.
---
No one uses it to see what the chances to win are, it is just a more efficient than searching up individual usernames on the r6 tracker. And the mentality part varies with each person
---
Our last buddy had already run away as soon as it hit 30 seconds he was hiding miles from site as well in a corner.
---
Well he's not wrong about a 2 speed AK12 being broken, but other then that, I don't see any issues with Fuze being 2 speed.
---
I agree. If you have the right attitude solo queue allows you to try to carry your team and yourself to victory. Sometimes in Siege that's not enough though. Hate to give myself as an example but you can check my profile cheese.bologna and see what I mean by that lol.
---
Damn you popped off, hopefully that got you to rank up out of copper
---
I know how that feels lol. Though I got Frost in an alpha pack one time. Didn‚Äôt even know you could get ops in them. 
---
Yep, it‚Äôs mostly there for casual players I feel. Winning a game is more than enough reward for me too.
---
Blackicegudgibupvotes
---
what money are you spending on operators?
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs a lot easier to avoid than people just shooting you.  Plus at the very least they will be less prone to do it because they die too.  It won‚Äôt stop everyone obv
---
I remember I used to rush across the map to try and kill someone I downed. Got interrogated once because of it, and now I know better.
---
No you just don't get my point. If you like CASUALLY getting picked off spawn and forced into corners then that's your problem. You don't play at the same level as me and you don't understand my problems. I'm not afforded the luxury of playing how I want in casual because of the hidden MMR. You just don't get it bud.
---
We fixed an issue with the website loading on iOS earlier, but if it's still occurring for you can you please submit a ticket to support.ubi.com so we can look more into it? Thank you!
---
For the most part, but having experience with mods that do the exact same thing it will make an already toxic environment much worse
---
tell your brother that i love him
---
Thank him for his service
---
Did they use nokk in league? How did it go
---
As you can see maestros in the dead center of the chart, so apparently it doesn‚Äôt matter because he‚Äôs perfectly balanced statistically
---
Yea sure, but I fail to see a counter to jackal that isn't just someone not leaving footprints like Cav.
---
And that is why he will be the common ban. There won't and cannot be a hard counter and the crawl/don't move strat isn't viable to be used for the whole round.
---
His pick rate isn't high, he doesn't get picked a lot and that partly helps improve his KD ratio. 
---
When his presence is anticipated, we can come up with some counters, like prefiring or out-speed him. But now, his pee-ka-boo becomes very effective since we don't expect him as much as before.

You should create a LAN game and it should work. Does work for me

---
I'm not saying he's a broken OP but I see so many people complain about the F2 or the 416 and I'm just scared of the Italian guy.
---
Yes, getting stuck into positions is not fun, but what im saying, is to fuck around by doing strats like recruit rush or run Zofia LMG, or do any stupid shit, like strat roulette
---
It doesnt mean they are strong, it just means that on the rare occasions they are picked teams win slightly more than normal. That could be due to any number of reasons that really has nothing to do with Kapkan or Frost. Which is why win delta's should be taken with a massive grain of salt. they are not really a great measure of individual operator effectiveness (in fact they are a pretty terrible measure of it)
---
The fact that they are almost never ever picked is direct evidence that they are, in fact, not strong operators.
---
They backed themselves into a corner with the introduction of Blackbeard and Jackal. Honestly, I'd probably include Lion too.

Hello XeroKibo, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dl3uwc/black_ice_is_broken/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
‚ÄúBalance‚Äù if they were a balancing team tell me why this game has been out for as long as it has yet we‚Äôre still talking about balancing. Lol.
---
Still doesn't prevent 4 man q from kicking that 1 poor bloke.
---
Can you fill me in on the joke?
---
I would rather lose ELO from a cheater 1 game than losing 71 without warning, that‚Äôs my point
---
Can you really get ops I‚Äôve never had one lol, and I don‚Äôt  understand why the beckon to the people who don‚Äôt play the game that much and not to the people who do
---
What about them
---
Right, but the fact that Cav hard counters foot print scanning doesn't make it any easier to deal with. You just trade a useful operator for Caveira who is highly map/site dependant at higher levels. Cav sucks at fighting straight fights unless you catch someone close with the shotty. Like, yeah, she's a counter to Jackal in a way but picking her doesn't feel at all like it helps you in the big picture versus him.
---
Choose one
---
You old as shit
---
PEREGRINE GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVES!
---
Nomad
---
Do i need to add a fucking /s for you?
---
Can't wait to recruit rush into a coordinated defender crossfire or get out aimed due to the ads time of Zof's lmg. You're telling me things that you might be able to pull off at your level but I'd be stuck getting capped every time. You need to catch people by surprise or be significantly higher skill level than the enemy team for that stuff to even remotely work and against Diamonds/Plats that's not the case.
---
It needs to be silent. They basically ruined him when they thought he needed a louder tool. I still play him a lot because I like his gun and 3 speed but people know where I am almost every time.
---
Honestly should have just hipfired with the bearing at that range. Could have gotten the kill if you hipfired with the remaining 10 bullets too.  Also adjust your sens lol
---
Hell spend a lot of time in T-hunt just using the bearing ONLY if you plan to continue using hibana. I did it with both the smg-11 and bearing to help my Echo &amp; Smoke play, and now I can confidently fight with those weapons easily.
---
Also looking around through the window with the shotgun out like hes gonna kill someone on the ground with it if they were to see him
---
The sweat enemies when they go against the randoms
---
Perhaps. I would more put my money on next week.
---
He should not be able to scan footprints. Being a mobile drone with an excellent gun should be enough. No direct hard counter would need be added then imo.
---
I think it would cause queue time issues and stuff. 
---
Personally for Casual I love playing Favela, House and Plane (would love to see Bartlett U come back to Casual for this as well) and seeing as the majority of the community doesn‚Äôt seem to like them, I‚Äôd probably be waiting quite a while to even get a single match.
---
I‚ÄôLL CATCHA GRENADE FOR YOUUUUUU
---
Het there lil doggy
---
If they wanted to change it to where this happened, then just shorten the defuse timer so it‚Äôs the equivalent of the full time of caught right at the end of the timer
---
Blowtorch can destroy evil eyes right?
---
This game and sub need more people like you.
---
wait a second
---
Oh yeah true
---
its not really that interesting. he has 1 amazing AR, a really good smg, soft destruction shotgun better than gridlocks, smokes...... even if he couldnt ping footsteps AT ALL and just saw them, he'd still be OP if used by someone playing him properly
---
and as the change stands, he will still be 95% as annoying and 100% as banned
---
Big fish
---
Fair enough. I figured you were on PC-im sorry you have to deal with DDOSers and shit man.
---
This is on Console correct? Unless you use controller on PC, this is more than likely just a visual bug, if intentional its an exploit of a bug, therefore cheating. Lucky wall bang? Not likely, that isn't a soft wall either.
---
Edit: I'm not too sure if the wall is soft or not, but cheats that don't involve internet services are extremely rare on Console anyway.
---
Agreed
---
Chili
---
Video games can be so wholesome sometimes, damn...
---
I wonder why? There must be SOME reason why they removed Acog on previous operators. Like I said I don't care about it on Attack, because it promotes slow, defensive play. (BTW you have to PUSH on attack) But on defense, an extremely defensive gadget does nothing but unbalance the operator.
---
It's not that simple though. Lesion is the answer to rush strats involving: Lion, Finka, Blitz, etc. No other operator is as good as countering that.
---
Thanks man
---
Mmm, a post by Yoda i see
---
I enjoyed that
---
He was 3 times silver, 3 times low gold and once somehow got to fucking plat 3. Last 2 seasons he was s3
---
i guess it could in some situations - you have less time to react if lets say nokk comes around the corner silently and starts bodyshotting you, or in situations where she's on a cam but goes invisible so now peeking to see where she is will take off like 40hp of your health 
---
like if she had jagers gun i could see her being too good, but still niche
---
for real!
---
When my teammates leaves and we almlost clutch and lose i cant stop to think ‚Äù if he/they did not leave we could have won‚Äù
---
&gt; five stacks playing like diamonds and my teammates going 1-7 while I‚Äôm 10-4
---
I‚Äôm having a similar experience. Been bouncing between bronze II and silver II because of stuff like that.
---
I seem to have hot streaks where I have great games with scores in the 5+ thousand range and then I have cold streaks were I go 3-7.
---
&gt;N√∏kk has had a slow start and her pick rate is quite low. To make her a more attractive choice, we are currently reviewing some suggestions to improve her loadout. We feel it is premature to change anything regarding her as an Operator for now, so for the time being, we would like to keep monitoring her performance. The last few weeks of Pro League have shown a few interesting uses of her ability, and we would like to keep an eye on it to see how she can evolve.
---
Does this mean Nokk could get a new gun? I'd love to see the MP7 or MP5SD on her
---
I only did just to check the challenges which would've taken 5 sec max if it didnt get stuck
---
&gt; Frost is seriously under appreciated
---
thats why her and kapkan are so high in winrate. you dont really see them, so you stop checking for their traps and then you hit one. if frost was highly picked, her mats would be almost useless
---
That looks suspicious 
---
Maybe aimbot but I mean he had his curser right on you
---
ubi rework is his shield is strong but metal, and just has a hole in the middle where his head is
---
That‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt understand. K/D doesn‚Äôt matter, playing as a team and good callouts do.
---
Except they're not. Ash's role is an entry fragger. Her entire role is built on getting kills. Twitch isnt even that strong in comparison with the other ops on the win delta. Shes clustered around Ash, Zofia, Thatcher, thermite and Hibana. Would you say any of them are too strong and deserving of a nerf?
---
Thats sick though! Its a little out of my budget sadly. I got my 1440p 144hz for only 250 euros though so that was a great deal :) The problem is that i needed a new GPU aswell so that takes up more then half of the budget i had!
---
Sounds like one hell of a gaming experience you are getting though!
---
It should
---
How old the footstep is determines how many pings. New steps=lots, old = few. If you scan the footsteps they disappear. So you can track them down by following steps, or choose to ping.
---
Exactly
---
Is that Steve Rogers?
---
Ela has a pretty amazing shotgun.
---
Twitch &amp; Jager have a high pick and win rate because they have gadget with no reliable alternates. Thatcher is good for edd n gu n ads, but a whole lot of stuff is just disabled not destroyed. When there are more alternates, their pick rate will change.
---
Nice work kid
---
Same here, EUS
---
Spawn peaked the other two
---
Dunno if he had walls or what, but it sorta just looks like he prefired.
---
Same for me pc EU but only for ranked
---
Maybe a cool down like on csgo?
---
And that's fine. Bandit and J√§ger are OGs. People will stick to their mains faithfully because they are comfortable playing with them, and when push comes to shove and they are on a losing streak, they'd rather play what they have played for ages then try something new. Basic human mindset. Take the tried and tested route, even if the new one seems better.
---
The 2 Germans have been here for 4 years, and haven't been OP for the past 2 years and have stayed unchanged. It'll take a while before they can be trumped by new additions.
---
Edit: you have to also consider that kaid is banned more than bandit. Granted that the graphs show presence rather than just pick rate, but the fact that he is banned is testament to the truth that he is catching on and people are realising his power.
---
Best part is when you then join a game while it's still loading and the audio shits the bed
---
This is so sad
---
Pretty sure he's just one of those cases where you gotta throw out the whole operator and start over.
---
After his years-long journey of changes, I'm convinced that as long as it stays mechanically the same, his gadget will only ever be either game breaking or utterly worthless - no middle ground.
---
F0-12 with extanded barrel, Angeled grip and laser sight

Well I was using 8gb 3000 MHz ram and then upgraded to 16gb. I don‚Äôt know if it improved my FPS or not because I didn‚Äôt pay attention but i think I got  120-150 and now I get 140-160. It‚Äôs possible that you may get some relatively low frames due to the speed but Siege doesn‚Äôt use that much ram. 
---
I also don‚Äôt know if Ram speed is a factor in how much Ram is used, like just now I played and I used 7700 mbs, but I have 3000mhz Ram. 
---
If you haven‚Äôt had issues with ram so far, you should be fine.
---
Boom.
---
Back to revealing spoilers.
---
I can‚Äôt believe this is missing from my memory.
---
Ok like 1-2 hours ?
---
Thansk!
---
We have the same problem on EU ranked
---
Yeah same on Xbox nyc
---
Lol, so close
---
Ok like 1-2 hours?
---
Jager has the best gun, 3 speeds, top tier gadget.
---
&amp;#x200B;

should be 2 speeds imo

He is

Hello LiberDBell, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dl629o/servers_are_broke/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Can confirm. They will be taking away impact damage.
---
Same here on Xbox NA
---
Well the main reason I went for a STANAG instead of the 552 proprietary magazines is because there aren't similar magazine models you can use in-game, so I just chose the ones on the most similar weapon (Thermite's 556xi) instead.
---
That being said, i'd say a 552 converted to use STANAG magazines is still far more realistic than a 5.56 20 round magazine somehow being able to magically hold 30 rounds.
---
Np
---
Repeated bangs.

I'm on PS4 Europe, even for casual matches it times out. Tried closing the application and opening it again, same with restarting the system. No response from the R6S servers it seems
---
Not anymore. It's a pretty normal semi auto now.
---
Yup no ranked on EU pc
---
Thank you!
---
He has the little indication because his traps are invisible, if you are lesion it will be mars and a waste of time looking are the ground to pick up his gu. 
---
He gets the traps during the round to balance him. Imagine in the prep phase you already have all of them. Now if you die at the begging you have like 2-3 gu. He‚Äôs a risk reward kin of op not like kapkan or frost that can place all their trap during prep phase.
---
The static lags my game as well which means that im garunteed death unless the enemy has shite aim.
---
I think that's a fair compromise.
---
Awesome, I wanna do that with Warden now
---
Can't you just......switch?
---
That Is going to hot
---
That what I did but it didn‚Äôt work so idk

I‚Äôm not really a *fan* of those

My man didn't even TRY to hide it
---
Hmmm.........
---
Don't tempt them to cut down the mag size to 20.
---
I mean, they still changed the magazine models on the AR-15.50 and the AK-74M after enough people noticed they were wrong, so I doubt this is a change that takes that much to implement anyway.
---
Yea it is
---
3 of us tried to play together and we couldn‚Äôt get it to work. We tried everything. Two of us were able to get into a t hunt together however we couldn‚Äôt get together in a ranked or cas. I was able to join a cas solo though...

Im the luvkiest man alive to say... No.

When ur as lucky as me u hit the switch button right when the animation starts and it diesnt switch and u die imeadiatly
---
i thought you were talking about a computer
---
Doesn't matter if enough people don't care, if there's a issue it should be fixed
---
Same with me, I did the exact same thing but there were no changes whatsoever :/
---
We may have to wait a little bit, while Ubi work out the issue
---
Or you can't pick an operator and randomly get Warden.
---
PC US same thing. Casual play
---
I've had it for about 3 hours now. (EU - PS4)
---
Holy shit when did you start playing
---
Next you'll say "we are invincible"
---
yep
---
&gt;!Oh it actually worked lol I didnt notice beforw!&lt;
---
If you think that the same WILL happen you are being very unreasonable
---
At launch lol
---
Zofia used to be near center as well, yet they decided to tune her down. Anything can happen.
---
Unpopular opinion I had for years: Jager is OP.
---
Keep in mind this is in past tense, I don't think he's OP anymore, 
---
He's JUST AHEAD OF THE CURVE!
---
He was not OP in a way that most people tend to use the word in this community; he's wasn't annoying like Blackbeard for instance. He certainly was annoying with his little 416-C when he had an ACOG and before guns like Maestro's ALDA and Lesion's T-5 set a new standard in TTK. To my surprise, all the power creep over the years made him balanced in a way (it'd have been much easier to go the other way and nerf the most powerful operators and we'd be in a more balanced place than we are now most likely, but k, let's have some guns on operators that fill the same roles killing in 0.1s and some in 2s). That being said, there are still a lot of operators that he is just so much better than. His gadget cannot really backfire, his kit is all around great. You shouldn't EVER have a Vigil picked on your team before Jager unless you **REALLY** need those fucking impacts or have some very specific bamboozle in mind/need a counter to Lion. The only downside of 416-C is the relatively slower ADS time, but this gun is so strong that it could totally be on an attacker (if you're going to keep recycling weapons then do this one, chief).
---
What Jager needs is, of course, an alternative. Besides that? Maybe a rework to how many grenades an attacker can carry and then a nerf to his gadget to account for that. Currently if you nerf Jager's gadget you would be totally changing how the game is played. He's picked not just because he is great, but he's **necessary** to defend some spots.
---
So there, not sure why all of this for your comment, but it felt like a required element to my response (which is basically only the previous paragraph) at the time I started writing.
---
Sounds about right
---
flat feet, knees inside body, proper slav squat
---
My question is why did YOU get reverse friendly fire???
---
&gt;Jager is overpowered. Insane pickrate and winrate. should be nerfed. slightly.
---
No he's not. Why does everybody say this? He's the only anti-projectile op in the game. Why touch the only dude who can do something essential? **You NEED J√§ger in every game now cause of how laden the game is with projectiles**. You can have 6 flashes, 4 nades and 2 smokes in one team, and that doesn't even count Cap's counter-less smokes and fires.
---
His gun is great but not OP. 740 rpm isn't something legendary in this game.
---
J√§ger shouldn't be touched until the alternative in s4 is released and settled.
---
Same on PC NA
---
Same EU. Had a couple of games but now can't find one in 10 minutes of queueing. And we're usually so good at that.
---
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL REVERSE FRIENDLY FIRE. bum bum bumbum bomp
---
I was just playing normal ranked with my squad and...,,, I end up laughing for about half the round not being able to move dokkabie and somehow survived without moving at all after hacking his phone because I was laughing too hard
---
Mine is working for casual just not ranked
---
That's cause you are up against duds.
---
Servers are down, ubis looking into it. Just wait like an hour or so
---
I mean, the 552 is pretty much just Thermite's 556xi with more recoil, so I doubt they are gonna do that anytime soon.
---
Hahaha nice!
---
Lmao probably
---
Can't get a game on xbox
---
Just shoot him 4head
---
Wondering if servers are down for anyone else, I‚Äôve been queuing with people in the R6 discord and then after a couple of rounds kept getting this trying to find a match. Happened in every game mode and whole R6 discord was experiencing it too.
---
I sit there for 2 minutes and then I get an error. Idk what‚Äôs going on.
---
How is that possible? You can switch whenever and wherever you want.
---
Definitely a glitch.
---
If it becomes widespread, yes it will. These are just plain facts.
---
The average player isn't like you or I who frankly couldn't give a shit for the most part.
---
All it does is adds fuel to a player base which is already toxic and incredibly volitile at the best of times
---
How do u fix
---
Are you going after Blackbeard mains now?
---
No one expects the Spanish Inquisition. So he needs nades. Mira has C4
---
Why is this the most true thing to exist in gaming in a whole
---
I agree with that, if anything I'd like to see a complete redesign of him
---
Sound is one of this games biggest and most important factors and I have a half working headset

Hello Rainwoman10, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dl761d/crazy_single/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I didn't realize I was talking to a dummy that has to have everything spelled out but here you go. You are mad because you are bad

What is it that is needed here...,?
---
i agree i also think they should take his guns away and give him 3 nades... since we are just saying dumbshit
---
Caused by extreme lag, which is why you had flashing icons on the top of your screen. The server couldn‚Äôt register that your shield was deployed because of how bad the connection was
---

---
It's the fluff section? Lmao
---
Oof.
---
As a kapkan main, the most traps triggered are the ones placed near entry and out of LoS, because that's where they are less aware.
---
I rarely get obj entry triggers because people are much more aware closer to obj.
---
Hi, sorry to bother you.
---
UK here and haven't been able to find a game in over an hour now. Restarting search and game doesn't help
---
He‚Äôs just used to rushing into places
---
I'm fairly certain [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rainbowsix/images/c/c0/552-image.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20151210180047) is not how a 552 magazine looks like, certainly not according to basically every photo i've seen of a 552 anyway. It does look exactly like [this PMAG](https://gunmagwarehouse.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/1200x1200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/a/magpul-pmag-20-ar-m4-gen3-556-223-20rd-magazine-mag560-blk_right.jpg) though.
---
Like I said if you don't like it don't use it.
---
i cannot either, when i do its a south Brazil server and everyone has 150 ping
---
That would be terrifying
---
Robocruit
---
That's almost 2hrs yo
---
Yes i did
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever successfully used a murder hole, but I‚Äôve gotten ‚Äúno u‚Äôd‚Äù way too many times in my short tenure as a maverick main.
---
The only reason I play him is for his smokes nades and shotty secondary.
---
My man out here tryna the scare the enemy by shooting near them
---
no
---
Same issue here. I got a 3 man party and cannot find a match.
---
It‚Äôs honestly better if he remains stupid good
---
no u
---
I would as well,  perhaps something along the lines of a side shield that doesn‚Äôt block full face or something similar
---
We are not special no moreüò™
---
i think 60 is too low you should try 70/75 i think this is enough for see what you need to see,
---
some players play with FOV at max but it isn't for me personally you should try and see what fits better for you
---
Servers are back
---
Lmao nice one!
---
Thank you
---
It hasn't been consistently miles above though, I think this could just be a fluke especially since no change has been made to him in the last few seasons. Like I mentioned to someone else here, Frost and Kapkan have very high win rates, and they mostly have for the last couple seasons, but IMO they dont deserve a nerf
---
fluffy??? lol
---
Mom said to give me the acog back or else she'll take it away from you herself
---
Damn right, fuck a dude that castles the door to obj.
---
*throws two flashes then nades, this happens*
---
yeah, i couldn't really remember how it worked last year. ok thanks for the info
---
From what I‚Äôve gathered, yea they are. I‚Äôm not currently playing the game, or have tried to yet today - but they posted something on Twitter about it.
---
Mid season
---
What are you talking about? The AK12 has almost non existent recoil.
---
Lol. Run outs are toxic?
---
Run outs are a part of the game and you HAVE to run out sometimes, otherwise yall ain't gonna win the round.  Running out is how you had to kill Blackbeard on a window after all. It's even more risky to run out nowadays because we have Nomad for em, lmao.
---
okay :(
---
Its essentially the meme section lol
---
I seventh that
---
I mean since each operator is distinct then players will know your ability and shoot you on sight
---
Personally would love MP7 or MP9. 
---
So much higher DPS overall.
---
I said WHY they are nerfed. Not why they SHOULD be nerfed. You really need to improve your reading comprehension. 
---
Why is it ridiculous? You claim Fuze and Finka are not not picked due to lack of utility. That is not the bearing for utility. The bearing for utility is win delta. The most useful and powerful an op is, the higher their win delta. That does not mean they will be popular, however. Rook is consistently better than Doc every season but Doc is more popular because he is more fun to play for most players. 
---
Fuze has needed an entire rework for a while. Many players know this but not why Ubi have not changed him on the slightest. His ability can be very useful at times and useless in others but it doesnt help he sounds like a herd of elephants. Finka is straight up powerful as with all global operators. She just isnt fun to play. 
---
If you keep buffing lesser ops, we end up with the original too popular ops then needing a buff. 
---
You SHOULD buff and nerf based upon the outliers, not the rule. There are only a few ops that are ridiculously popular. Make them less popular and the less popular ops become more popular. It is minimal and effective. When Finka and Lion were too strong, they didnt buff everyone to counter them. They nerfed Finka and Lion. The needs of the majority outweighs the needs of the minority. Not sure if you like killing the meta, but I dont.
---
Body is the objectively correct prononciation. "Buddy" is just wrong.
---
Happened a few times. Should have added a caption for *acceptance* by the end.
---
I hope it doesn't mean just buffing her FMG-9
---
Who said I hate R6? I am idiot, but not enough to play something that I hate
---
Talk about game toxicity is a reason to hate it? Even Ubi admits a toxicity problem in the game and I can't talk about it? I must play another game for that reason? well...using your argue, if don't like read my thread, you can read another one....
---
I was playing with 2 friends, by the way
---
He dropped of a couple of chromoses to carry more ammo
---
Oooooo I like breakpoint even more now
---
jk calm your tits
---
You can see midway through the clip where they knife instead of lean, which happens often with a controller , so naw just good aim
---
When I go online it works
---
This was posted months ago
---
ohhhhhhhh wait so this guy was meming on me how dare thy
---
It's not possible this is a fluke, that's not how averages work. 
---
And he got a giant ads speed buff along with all the other ops this season. I don't have to tell you why that benefits him disproportionately.
---
&gt; sens is too low to control guns like the bearing
---
Maybe if you aim using only your fingers, I play at 400dpi 10/10 75 (35cm360) and I have no problem controlling guns like the smg12 vertically. Gotta learn to use your entire arm instead of relying on just fingers to do the job.
---
Wow aren‚Äôt u the best console player
---
As a Jackal main, I definitely think that he should be on the banned from nades list. Smokes and breaching pads are good for him.
---
hey, i waited 110 mins for that it wasnt low effort
---
Maybe they should make her time to shoot and move quicker after grappling in
---
Problem is console would get STOMPED by pc, as has been proven in the past, so i reckon you should only be paired against other platforms if people in you party use them, would be nice tho
---
High risk high reward operator. Its 30 seconds left on the clock. Attackers think the room is clear to plant. They didn't keep track of who died and how. They aren't paying attention to the pile of corpses behind them. Suddenly one of them starts to get up...
---
Of course the meta would just become always shoot Roadkill whether you're sure they are dead or not. But it'd be an easy thing to forget.
---
It's not about using him "properly" it is about using him to his absolute limit. Pros do this because there is money on the line. Since Capitao can be stretched in a ridiculous amount of situations, they tend to do that. Most players will use him properly and normally. Using Pro League, the smallest community, as a means to reason with the rest of the hundreds of thousands of R6 players is straight up stupid.
---
Tell me the point of saying exactly what op said, but with extra words?
---
&lt;3
---
Oh the video is a joke, those were all lucky shots
---
Reeeeee
---
No problem
---
It wouldn‚Äôt really work because people would recognize the op and shoot their body no matter what
---
Guess who
---
Oh wow, something else unoriginal in breakpoint, nice.
---
When will that be?

---
that‚Äôs not how irony works

Not enough for a goddamn TK.
---
That‚Äôs awesome you got to play at that level. I only ever competed at the local/ amateur level but it was still some of the most fun I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve thought about getting back into it but it‚Äôs too expensive for me at the moment.

Ahh. Trap ops. They have high win Delta's because those who play them are good with them.
---
I mean Kaid has an Acog shotgun thats better in every way, recoil on the Bosg is still shitty as hell
---
Tru but imagine a 3 speed kaid
---
It be like that.
---
Keep in mind also that we haven‚Äôt gotten to watch pros use these operators. Often professional strats trickle down into lower ranks but that obviously takes a while
---
It tells you the key bind to self rez
---
He had to do it to ‚Äòem.
---
Mozzie is single-handedly carrying the season for me.
---
He's Aug could be better but he's pretty good
---
Hahahahaha. How bothered you have to be. I was being facetious, but whatever: Imagine getting mad at someone over some words on the internet. Good luck dropping your balls, boy.
---
Amaru is entirely situational and is only really effective on certain maps, usually the bigger ones too, but also REQUIRES you to drone out where you'll be using her gadget for entry otherwise you're begging to be killed for free.
---
i mean he was good enough to get an ace, don‚Äôt dump somebody just because they play console
---
It's based it around a very, VERY limited amount of players rather than what supports the majority. That's the problem with it. I'm not saying Ubisoft is evil for it, or that I hate them. I'm just saying that's not a good way to balance a game.

As spaniard ban rates infuriate me

Time to bring back Spanish Inquisition üò§
---
I memeber this post on the app itself a few months ago, you didnt steal this did ya
---
Kapkan not as thicc as everyone thinks.
---
Oh shit, yeah it looks like someone grabbed a prior version off my twitter
---
While I can see where y'all are coming from with it being basically like blackbeard 2.0, I still feel like itd be on it's own level because it's just one shot before they're back to normal one shot headshot vs blackbeard having 2-3 shots before it breaks. Maybe have two ops from the same ctu, one on each team, with the ability to even it out even more if that's such an issue. I just want some sort of defence from getting random headshot out of nowhere with bs bullet rng.
---
I have never heard of this. Mind saying more then one example
---
Ohh I can see how it locked to his head now. That‚Äôs lame.
---
kinda cheapens the rank.
---
NANI?!?!?
---
M8 I'm not mad. I'm at work and have nothing else to do. Like I said you are mad cuz you are bad
---
Ubi will do anything for cash
---
The bosg is already OP. Acog would just make everyone buy dokabei and vigil just for the bosg
---
Yeah I get that but how many people are gonna sacrifice a really good defender weapon just for that. I guess some people might but I don‚Äôt know.
---
This vid is near impossible to watch due to it being so fast at 1 second long. Hit reg is fine, been diamond for 4 season now and I've not had a problem. Just an over used excuse by bots
---
yeah forreal a, especially if you play Nokk, echo is super easy to catch with his pants done lookin at his drones.

---
Yep, that‚Äôs the downside of developing a competitive esport. Unfortunately there‚Äôs no way around it, you have to balance for the top 1% to make it a viable esport. Of course they do add some quality of life changes that affect lower skill players as long as they don‚Äôt change balance at the high end, where possible.
---
The Kaid note seems to tease at a new gadget coming. I hope thats why they are being vague.
---
So is the shield supposed to be useless or something?
---
Remember, the operator just APPEARS dead, not actually dead.
---
time to kill is pretty abysmal in R6S.... So not really something you can look forward to.
---
The Aug is good now
---
Keep in mind this is plat and above on PC. These games tend to have a set meta(you can even see it on the graph). Every game is a combination of Hibana, Thermite, Thatcher/twitch, Ash/Zofia, with a X operator (IQ, Buck, Sledge, Nomad, jackal).
---
Most 5 stacks will not switch those meta picks to another operator unless they have a specific strat they are trying to pull off like a Monty plant, BB window, Mav, or a dokki/gridlock.  
---
So a brand new operator that has a "okay" ability will not get picked as much. 
---
Similar thing with defense, You got the established Smoke, Maestro, echo, Mira players. to get them to change to a new operator in a diamond match is pretty hard unless they have a new strat.
