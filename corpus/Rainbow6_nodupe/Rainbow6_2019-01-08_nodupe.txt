Before posting I looked back through new posts to see if anyone already posted this but didn't see any posts, sorry if I missed them.

And dropped them.
---
Maybe it could have something like clash’s sights
---
Haven't played since they introduced holograms. Like really? Wtf Ubisoft. 
---
i think it's important to find a comfortable niche between shooting and strategy. if you go too far, you either end up with a game that's more about your reflexes, or a game where every round has people running off to the same religiously used corners and spots like in CSGO.
---
That button does nothing, it’s just there to keep us happy
---
The song is actually good.. tiktok actually killed it 
---
Well there is not really a way to know if you are shooting it on purpose 
---
Yeah, after Lion got autobanned in pro league Ubi had to realize his strength. He had a 87% ban rate at LAN.
---
Btw I made the thatcher one, your doc one looks really good, I had an animation for the thatcher icon so I’m upset gifs don’t upload correctly for some odd reason 
---
Just when i thought the world had enough cancer..
---
Why the hell does T-hunt require an internet connection and isn’t splitscreen is what I want to know.
---
This is true.. BUT I c4'd a month yesterday. He must've been low or the c4 hit him good
---
I'm with ubi on this - you need to aim better. IF you insist you're hitting the carrier and not the hostage, proof will be required 
---
I agree with every point that was made. Unfortunately, I doubt Ubisoft will stop the development of new operators or maps in favor of reworking the game due to the fact that people have bought the season pass and expect a return on that investment. 
---
ok but youre on page 80 I'm page 3, dont say things that dont apply
---
Lol yeah, I could just see what you meant, but I think that the winning team deserves the satisfaction of flexing gear...
---
Isn’t that just personal preference/situational?
---
It's Casual, nobody cares, stop spamming trash gameplay.
---
Yes they are bannable under external programs. Also related are the use of scripts, mods, and hacks.
---
Yes, it’s is a C4, one friendly remaining.
---
In fact I’m making another rn
---
I believe There is a setting called Vertical Sync, the original setting is maximum 30fps, after you turn that off/on it will change to 60fps
---
Really I didnt see it?
---
There is no Elo difference in this game exept diamond 
---
I saw Insane players in copper 4 
---
I saw bad players in platinum
---
I myself am umrankend because it doesn’t matter you will get a charm yea but not based on skill rather based on the skill of your whole team and the skill of the players you faced 
---
I bet you in copper to silver  are players way better than me and you and I also bet you that even on diamond are some booted noobs
---

---
Jus go whatch this  video about it  featureing Kickstar ( who is currently on platinum I believe but still playing better than many active pros ) https://youtu.be/mv3GK2R0dUo 
---
Take my money 
---
That button is a placebo
---
You’re like 6 hours late. It’s possible you could miss them. 
---
I love these videos. So catchy and so true
---
At 5 seconds in
---
Even in fairly high level play (plat) if you have peeker’s advantage and you have good aim and flicks you will win every gunfight. The sole exceptions are Mira strats, BB, and Glaz on small openings or very far away.
---
But I got friends who’ve been using macros to crouch and lean spam for a while now and they haven’t gotten banned :/
---
Stop these shitty tik tok vids
---
I mean they could make it so it doesn't count as a team kill if the enemy team is escorting it or something. At least griefers would still get kicked for killing in prep phase and such.
---
This way nobody can complain about “ruining casual” and whoever wants to just have fun can and whoever wants to take it seriously still can as well it’s a simple fix to the toxicity and Ubisoft needs to hire me
---
Anything on bank 
---
No need to get heated. Jeez this post was suppose to be fun...
---
I agree with what you say. But I do think some of the issues the OP mentioned should still be addressed
---
Uh that is clearly legos
---
LKF: Thatcher was a closer for the Yankees prior to joining S.A.S.  He won a couple rings in the ‘90s with them 
---
1. someone has to win if the hostage dies
---
2. if you would win for killing the hostage AT ANY MOMENT, it could be abused
---
3. if you wouldn't get kicked (and banned) for killing the hostage, it could be abused to throw games without repercussion
---
Yeah that's what I mean but I forgot about the sporting but even though mav CiA and Irene :)) (an operator for the future) delta force 
---
It’s always fun to run shotgun with Ying
---
Or I’ll say whatever I want and you’ll just ignore it next time instead of being a cuck
---
same
---
What about other 89% of my message?
---
This is r/gaming material.
---
Also it's a meme, going against posting guidelines.
---
Does that work with the normal PS4? At the moment I do not own a PS4 pro if that makes any difference. 
---
So accidents don't happen? You know what it looks like when the guy runs with it right? The hostage just warps all over the place following a player. Even if you wanted to shoot it on purpose you could end up killing the guy escorting it instead by accident. I won't appeal a 30 ban but still, this is too unforgiving.
---
That one probably makes something happen lol
---
I’ve been asking for that since day 1. I really don’t get why they can’t make that work
---
I can't even crouch and walk properly, let alone shoot and being accurate
---
Also placebo. I used mnk and tk’d daily on Xbox and was untouchable. They don’t care 
---
I came to think it's just absolutely random.. I see no link whatsoever with my skills and result and the people I'm matched against, 95% of the time it's against people that are way above my own threshold. 
---
Not arguing with that
---
Who else sees nothing wrong with this picture but the drone?
---
That’s epic 
---
The music itself sounds good but what its about makes it cringe and i hate it
---
Full team of Recruits sounds OP. wait...
---
I would very much like to meet your friend.
---
Does she look like a T?
---
Tachanka **is** the link between *mere* mortals and gods.
---
Well. Why do you think Siege is so popular? Itvbegan as a tactic shooter once... now it's arcadey and you have all these flashy comical skins around which are fitting for Overwatch, but not Siege.
---
You don't trash talk The Living Tombstone...
---
Also a direct ban without warning on the first team kill of a game which can happen anytime is ridiculous
---
This is fucking atrocious.
---
"Test it" 
---
I remember you could destroy a thermite charge while shooting from the other side of a reinforced wall. They took like 3 months to fix it
---
I mean that’s sorta what they look like IRL, it’s a combat handgun you aren’t supposed to be able to snipe with it just put the sights on a man sized target and fill that target with bullets.
---
Nerf LMG *WAT?!*
---
I like that it is a bit arcadey because i came from cs, but i agree on this one, no place for crouchspamming, even valve, the worst developer didnt let that into csgo. 
---
I thought this sub had a "no memes" rule? Are the mods here retarded?
---
Hackers used to use thunt offline to test hacks before implemented in online matches as offline hacks cannot be detected. There was also a problem of people hacking to get renown.

Last time there was this dummy ass kid talking shit on the mic and it was late night so I didn't bother to pick up my mic and say some so I send him a text telling him to stfu and the pussy told me he was bouta report me and guess what, he did and xbox got me suspended from sending other people messages, what a joke. I remember xbox wasn't controlled by sensitive sjw's when I used to play in the xbox live golden era (mw2, halo 3, bo2).

Pretty much every game bans scripts/macros. Only game from my recent memory that allows them is PUBG, unless they changed their stance over the last year since I quit (but blueballs is pretty set on shitty decisions so it's probably still allowed).

Absolute MADLAD!

Hey, was just scrolling through my inbox, and found this post. I got my first ace as caviera!

Nope, they have to complete a match before it counts.

Someone got banned from pro league for 2 years using them
---
Yes
---
What is wrong sir, what did my milk dud head do to you now
---
Big bet please do!!
---
You're welcome :)
---
Well, I wouldn’t recommend you to “train” on casual (due to trolls) or neither rankeds (due to being bad, you’ll place at bronze and that is full of more trolls) I suggest you to play some custom matches between you. I got a lot of friends that play siege and we play a lot of custom matches, even now, a new friend I met (who is on diamond, and I’m usually silver-gold) is teaching me some tricks on competitive and I really am feeling the difference, so go try to play with them and have some troll-free fun
---

Yeah ! I tought of that too, but I felt like the post was long enough like that.

Personal preference! Switched from concave to convex and I find it easier to control

So you would rather play this game on console then pc because you might run into hackers every 500 hours

So, you get a pass on being smart if they just learn to jerk 3 buttons at the same time? 
---
I pay my respect where respect is due- he included the r6 mixtape charm from the castle underground bundle
---
Buts it's not the skill gap people want in siege. The skill gap should be learning the map and using gadgets better not if you can mash keys faster than somebody. That's not what the game is supposed to be and if you can only mash keys really fast and run in with ash you don't deserve to be good at the game. 
---
No I gave up after an hour and the enemy team said the game cancelled after nearly 3 hours
---
You're right about Oregon, but there the problem is mitigated by all the potential confusion zones at least being in the exact same area.
---
Anecdotally speaking, I've also found that in this particular case there are at least enough defining features in each area to make fairly intuitive calls. The only bedroom with a wide bed is the "master bedroom" (intuitive, since it's a call used in many other maps to indicate the bedroom with the large bed), "kids' dorms" are marked as such in the game world and have immediately noticeable decorations (drawings on the walls etc.), and the room that shares a wall with kids' dorms is easy to identify by having the only "large window" on the second floor. The only one I've seen cause significant confusion is the central area that shares a wall with the master bedroom closet (most often called "generator"), since a lot of it's defining features are replicated elsewhere in some capacity.

This is me after a bandit puts batteries on walls I already electroclawed

Galaga: The gameplay of Galaga puts the player in control of a spacecraft which is situated at the bottom of the screen, with enemy aliens arriving in formation at the beginning of a stage, either trying to destroy, collide with, or capture the spaceship, with the player progressing every time alien forces are vanquished.
---
Galaxian: A fixed shooter in which the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and shoots enemies descending in various directions.
---
Space Invaders: Space Invaders is one of the earliest shoot 'em ups and the first fixed shooter. The aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser to earn as many points as possible.
---
We’ll need bigger maps, something like Tower

Nice job man I like seeing good edits on this subreddit for once

Sorry?
---
You right
---
How about Diamonds playing with all mid-high golds and still carrying every game? That is probably still considered boosting right? Just not as frowned upon?
---
Could be someone on your team doing it then. Does this happen across games, with completely different people on both teams? Do you notice the same line printed before the message with your name?  
---
As you can still move around and a text box doesn't appear, your computer itself isn't being controlled/hacked.  
---
There does seem to be a new wave of hackers, so it is possible that there is a hack floating around that allows for the names in chat to be altered.  
---
Man you dont need to apologize I want a apology from a siegie higher up or something
---
5 Lions.
---
Stop now we can’t do this
---
I totally agree. I'd even be ok with it just being like frost where it's just an automatic down and he loses one of his EDDs. There's been to many times where I've been killed because a 3 speed just runs into the building guns  blazing and just picks up kills due to the peakers advantage. 
---
At which point a headshot still kills so ehhh
---
Brackets would definitely be a big help to stop from boosting! But too bad Ranked is still in beta. I’m sure Ubisoft will figure it out one day
---
I’m starting to think ur right about it being my team mate. Thanks for the help, if it continues I’ll say something tho
---
It's ironic how when he got reworked, everyone was worried that not seeing the traps would break him. Funny enough, not only is he about as powerful as he was, but his effectiveness fluctuates significantly by season. A few season ago, he and Frost were among the best defenders in the game, with win rates almost as high as Rook and Jager. Then literally the next season they were as low as Castle. Make Kapkan instakill. I would be down. It would be a great buff to IQ as well.
---
Kills are king. Kill the other team and u win basically. Points mean nothing. I'll take a team mate with stats of 5-0 over 1-3 etc any day.

Getting kills isn’t everything, but it’s usually the other way around when you’re trying to apply it. If you’re getting kills, you’re definitely contributing to the team.

“Kills aren’t everything” applies more for those people who help with great call outs and support roles to help the people in the “frag” roles to get those kills.

Bro Overwatch dipped you off. SUE THEIR ASS
---
Have you tried restarting your PC or logging out then back in again? I'm on xbox so that's the best I can suggest. If it keeps going, contact ubisoft/steam and tell them what is wrong. They probably know what to do. Make sure the transaction is not going through until you get it. If they have been going through, talk to the bank and tell them what happened. Hope you get your r6 credits. Sorry I could help more
---
If you stayed with the hacker for like multiple games then ya sure you could get banned but just once and not even on purpose, you'll be fine

If you put her holograms right at windows and maybe doors your teammate can use them as a form of obstruction so the enemy can't see through or shoot through, and if you put them at windows specifically, enemies normally won't enter through there

---
At high level siege is really strat and coordination based but the sheer amount of broken OPs (blackbeard, monty......) allows bad players to win rounds they shouldn't
---
No, but you could always do that. It's just people bringing the crouchspam issue to the forefront gave others the idea to automate it. Besides, for most of the game's history either ping abuse or dropshotting have been the more effective methods of cheesing the game
---
Shes ok if you use her well

if the Genji switched to another hero, the guy that said I wanna be Genji can now take Genji

Idk man, I'm in the young adult stage and I've seen both 30 year olds and 10 year olds with the trend. I personally like the original song but tik tok caught ahold of it and the rest is history

And when you crouch spam and your hit box is teleporting all over the place doesn’t make it hard or near impossible to headshot the enemy?

I really can't go a match without hearing a racial slur. If I say "thats racist" apparently it isn't, despite them yelling a racial slur. I really think the toxic players are the worst, especially in casual when you just want to have fun but get killed when you spawn!!! I think the players are the problem, not really the game.

i love this perspective and love that you included some of the gripes ive had in seige for so long. vaulting, straffe speeds, crouch spam, utility spam. I recently just uninstalled the game and its a shame cuz at its core this is the best tactical shooter there is, but it has gotten so bloated with spammy, cheap mechanisms and metas that just cheaten the depth and skill of the game that competitive players love and make a game truly sustainable. I'm so happy to see the support this post got.

WHY ARE WE SCREAMING?
---
Ok but Ash and Jager are consistently strong picks for their solid guns, being 3 speed and having generically useful, straightforward gadgets. 
---
They get picked by top fraggers becuase they offer a good kit while being able to slay effectively too. But realistically, a top fragger will still be top fragging if they picked another operator. They don't facilitate CoD gameplay so much as they compliment aggressive playstyles.
---
Finkas ability is about as mechanically close to a Killstreak as you can get and it gives all the attackers Sleight of Hand Pro, Lightweight and Juggernuat and removes recoil. I'd say THAT is actively switching the game from Siege to CoD for 10 seconds, 30 in total across a round.

Everyone talks about black ice but short circuit is the best in the game.

My point? The M12 has one of the worst damage outputs in the game as well as a stupidly slow fire rate. My guess is that you're the faliled abortion here but you're too fucking stupid to realize it.

Right, sooo because I avoid toxic folk like you, that somehow devalues any and all observation I had over the course of the years about different playstyles and the meaning of tactical decisions over leaving things up to chance.

This has happened to me with other games and I’ve seen it happen to the Dark Souls streamer LobosJR. No one knows why it happens, I believe it might have something to do with either a damaged keyboard or it might have something to do with Nvidia/AMD’s built in gaming software.

shoot wall-reinforce-place mirror, no change needed
---
That’s why you put a laser on pistols as an attacker, I usually put silencer and laser on my pistols so I can take out cams and make less noise if need be and then in a panic I have a better chance of not getting absolutely demolished once I pull out the pistol and start hip firing as they run forward 
---
I really think that's a good idea, I've played Dota2 myself and I know about that system. Toxic people should be thrown in the "toxic limbo" where I'm sure they could feel like at home, much like in some games hackers get thrown on only hacker servers and can never leave. Looking forward for a new and reworked report system.
---
Right
---
I think a good player should be getting kills with utility based ops while playing for the team and the obj. Making a proper entry hole with thermite and also getting a few kills will help your team plant or get kills as well. Throwing down a good mute setup might stop your team from getting killed but playing vigil makes it just a bit easier for yourself only.

Happen to me twice but with the scoreboard.

5 hammer kills in a single round to unlock.

I played vegas 1 and beat it and never got v2 and then v2 was free on games with gold for xbox so I I played and quit halfway through the first mission because I went to aim down sights with the left trigger and I threw a grenade instead and killed myself. 
---
I couldn't taken in all the wisdom he was dropping on me in this game. I wish people saw this- the more beautiful side of R6 more often.
---
Damn, this is masterpiece!
---
Idk they must not change my IP address when I unplug my router then. 
---
You should be fine- I got more than that on a 960 i5
---
This idea has been here since the game came out 
---
Oh maybe the controls are just not for you. But like I said keep in mind many tactical shooters were had controls similar to this game.

I played about a half hour before claiming that r6 was the worst game I’d ever touched. Same thing happened with 3 of my now friends at different times. We all for some reason played it again a few weeks later and just fell in love. Here we are a year and a half later still loving it. Maybe you’ll come around to it
---
Stop being a jäger main /s

ok this is cool

Okay now hear me out for this one the role switched would never work why do you think they took jager and bandit acog away?

What's the "bathroom" blitz reference from cuz I never heard it before 
---
Hopefully man!👍
---
Imagine though. Soviet national anthem Blair’s throughout the map as five cluster charges go off, decimating anything and everything.
---
No they don't, they have one ads shot paired with an abused lean and crouching ability. This has even been talked about by "pro" players. There is an obvious abuse of shields.
---
You can't flank when you have them rushing site with 4 shields spasming left and right getting their free ads due to a finka boost. You lose in holding a loss on them because you can't hit them before they spas out of your bullets, can't shoot their hand if it's in a different place every other half second, then you get flashed and bashed. Grenades only take 30ish hp from the fucking Spartan wall in front of you. If you're roaming alone and one gets lost you might get lucky and sneak up behind one
---
imaging a lego version of rainbow 6 like lego star wars. I would buy that instantly.

Yeah I got way too used to modern shooters lol. Ghost recon and Vegas were good back in the day when i was new to shooters. Now it's different. 
---
Press f for all the regular drones lost because the twitch on your team is salty.
---
Uh how would this work on console using a VPN- I understand using a hotspot and a VPN on console but not a VPN straight up
---
Yeah man, I was thinking the other day about turning on an old shooter on the PS3 (not R6 Vegas) and I decided to play BFV instead.😂
---
Same with siege lol. There are a ton of tactics you use every round that you don’t even notice because it’s second nature. Push timing, positioning, grouping and team play are all tactical gameplay elements that you do without thinking about it. 
---
Sledge's hammer, Twitch's drone, Blitz's shield, Tachanka's LMG, Castle's barricade, Buck's under-barrel shotgun, Valk's camera, Cav's pistol, and Hibana's X-kairos launcher.

Just play another game then if you're over siege dude. It happens so just move on instead of typing 2000 word essays on how you wish you weren't over it.

Caveira's pistol is a charm too.

Marry her now
---
8GB RAM is a little low but your specs should be fine. That setup should easily give you 100 fps.
---
Siege rewards aggressive play and individual players too much. There's a million ways in which siege allows aggression. If the game slowed things down, it would leave room for tactical engagements. Siege allows for this aggresive top fragger play style that won't work in more serious shooters.
---
I have had an issue with shields I admit, but given that I play on controller only and hold my own against pc players. And them obviously being overused currently due to them using the lean and crouch spam that has been going on then yes, I have to say it's not a me problem

ACTIVE typically means they log in once a month - the chart shows concurrent players aka players playing at one time (on one PC platform since this doesn't even include Uplay).

Moved from ps4 last year. Biggest thing was making sure my dpi on my mouse and in game sens was similar to my ps4 sens, but a little bit higher in order to snap better and not kill my arm. I kept all keybinds the same except changed my melee and my operator ability to mouse buttons. Once I got used to these binds it made not only this game better, but playing any other pc game easier to pick up because they all have the same controls. As for settings I keep most on low with a 1600×900 res, but some like stretched. Basically I just changed everything to as low as it would go and still looked good to the eye so the fps would be as high as possible. Make sure vsync and shadows and all the stuff is off too.

I like how everyone forgot about twitch. Good luck getting anything done during prep phase.

It literally says NL on the license plate
---
recoil and explosions are a bit different. tbh i moved from ps4, and i often used to blow up myself on pc with nitro cells, in fact of i did the same with taking 30hp on ps4. recoil is way easier to learn and control though. 
---
Every season except this one so far I've gotten gold with a controller on PC, the differences don't seem that big with mnk I just don't find it as comfortable with mnk. If you're a better player just concentrate on getting used to the controls and your skills will transfer over
---
Crouch spamming, fast leaning and vaulting should be fixed. I'd agree on this. I have been playing this game when thermite used to have grenade and was considered very powerful operator. I know the game has changed a lot. Its moving very fast towards arcade style shooting game. The game that I purchased in December of 2015 was purely a tactical master class. Now it has rainbows and colors. I'd not want to see it turn into a OW or CSGO type game. 
---
What servers are you on?
---
Because i would like s fair one on one, skill vs skill. Not jump scare ambush surprise attack kill me before i can enjoy the challenge of killing you. It doesn't take skill to kill on a surprise. I can guarantee you, he cant win in a fair 1 v 1. So he must resort to spawn killing to pull his weight.

There has been a recent change for NA.
---
Team Reciprocity has bought out the Cloud9 roster. Skys has replaced Goddess on the roster, and Goddess has moved to eGang down in Challenger League.
---
As all things shoould be
---
Let me guess as per usual on a bad post there’s not a community manager in sight to give us any updates on what they’re doing to fix these things but when a post comes up praising them or the game they’ll be all over it. 
---
I would be very happy if they did it like CSGO, if a person gets reported more than X times it puts them onto the Overwatch list where a number of higher skilled/experience players will review the gameplay to determine if that player is cheating.

I would say west coast servers aren’t the best but they aren’t much better in the east either, did you happen to land on his head at any time? Sometimes hit markers are weird like that

Aw man that looks amazing! I see that you've done others as well and i was wondering if you were going to do Blackbeard or IQ? Either way fantastic work!

Bitch, go back to playing forza and archiving every post you get at least 100 upvotes on cuz ur scared of losing karma, no one asked for your opion, and nobody cares either, u just jealous that u cant maintain shit, let Alobe a clan, sincerely fuck you
---
If it works it works. Expect to get spawn peaked and shoot him back. Shit ain’t hard to counter. Only trash gets killed to that shit over and over. 
---
Also crouch spamming.
---
Thank you so much
---
The best part of the stupidity of the people that say that is it does and they refuse to listen to anyone lol.
---
That bra has nipple spots on it. Jeez
---
I mean cam placement is important, but being able to use that information is much more so.. in my opinion anyways. 
---
We still have idf on csgo why not here?
---
Expect the umexpected
---
Its old. Happens if you leave queue just as you find a game or if you are vote-kicked before you get in.
---
Like I said there’s only a specific number of spots a peaker can peak and reliably get kills from. So if you keep dying to those same spots over and over then you probably shouldn’t play the game. 
---
&gt;  Why can Cav's pistol down people faster than an AR? 
---
because statistically speaking the difference between being shot with an AR and a handgun are generally insignificant. Defensive caliber handguns .380 - .45 will incapacitate someone in an average of 1.87 shots. the incap rate of all centerfire rifles (ALL, including larger calibers) is 1.4 hits to incap.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If cav is shooting Hollow points, rather than ball ammunition like most people in that study, then i could absolutely reason with it. 
---
I don't know why but murdering someone with a nitro cell is always satisfying and feels mad disrespectful
---
Bois, let me set this straight. It is defuser, not diffuser! You ain't wanna diffuse good smells in the room to prevent Karen from taking the kids by calming her but DEFUSE a bomb.

Lion and ash are pretty good contenders for best ops overall, but it can always be dependent on the player.

I personally want to nominate fuze on casual but  I know no one else would agree

Game is trash, as every OP is still heterosexual. Unplayable. Doesn't represent me.

Lol no. You may not encounter blatant cheaters like this, but wall hacking is all too common, even on casual. Battleye is a fucking joke.

Shroud turned his hacks off ?

This clip definitely isn't on console.

Checkmate

I’m already thatcher

She wants that d
---
Did it work? 
---
Yeah i got after a while
---
No idc I didn’t play the 1st round. Maybe if i was in the 1st round we would’ve won. 
---
How did u know the team is losing? 
---
While where at it the m1911 can use some fine sights too
---
They would have to start suspending players who quit casuals first
---
For Oregon, I prefer to put the Electroclaw for the walls above in the ground, less likely to have an attacker check this part + it still works anyway for the walls below to get electrified. (most of the time attackers tries to plant on rear stage anyway)
---
Then play ranked instead. It's called casual for a reason.
---
Arghh right, i knew they were stronger but didn't realise that much stronger. But that was kinda the whole point, i didnt think any one would reslly give it a go ahah
---
I really feel like that couldn’t have been common enough to make ubi screw solo players like that.
---
It’s just my assumption. High probability when players leave as soon as they die the 1st round and maybe the team looses. In my experience I’ve 90% joined the losing team. 
---
They won't, if they do no backfills would ever happen, that's why there isn't an option to turn it off. then there will be too many 4v5/3v5's going around. 
---
Okay so I am not alone in this issue 
---
as long as it’s not frost, because you will be stuck in that trap until you die 
---
*I’m booting up the game*
---
If you would make the difference in winning or losing, you wouldn't complain about being 0-1 behind.
---
Who cares about losing in casual anyways...
---
Has nothing to do with reddit, since it was all over the gaming news! They tried to censor the game because of chine... and then decided to do it not because of community backlash and because china got their own client anyway. like seriously it was REALY big news everywhere!
---
Where gone hunt you down
---
Great
---
Maybe git fucking gud stop being a fucking skrub and help the losing team out

"booting up" siege is life it should already be booted up

Last time I tried to play article 5 I couldn’t find a game

Despite whether or not you believe it deserves 2500 upvotes is irrelevant considering it did get that many. You’re one person, one opinion, and a lot of people clearly disagree with you. 
---
We’re a specific community under the category of gamers. We don’t need more infighting amongst ourselves. We get enough flack and bullshit from mainstream media and culture who don’t understand us. Why tear down others of similar interests when you can celebrate them for their achievements?

I don’t blame you hahaha

I think this is actually a glitch because I place them like that and occasionally it will explode without killing the enemy or putting the enemy in DBNO.
---

I don’t think you understand what I meant.

Both players see the same timer up top. Use that to your advantage, and tell your friend, “do this at *instert time here*”
---
I am not quite sure what she is implying...
---
Also wrong colour.
---
Oh makes sense lol 
---
thats probably more correct then the one they show us in-game
---
What? I don't see any Photoshop. That's just Ash's hitbox
---
I already wrote the solution for this that ubi can easy implement. BF1 did this even csgo did this. Now it's r6s turn to do this.
---
Can you do more of these for other ops?

Just dont get placed there
---
People just got super sweaty

Ahh that’s hot... that’s hot

A playable tutorial would've been nice. Walk new players through the basics and show the difference between soft/hard walls and teach them how to use drones and some original operators gadgets/abilities.
---
While it is generally true that kd doesn't really matter and many people care WAY too much about it (quitting and rejoining in ranked because they were downed), it is still a small performance indicator. 
---
Of course teams need supports as much as they need fraggers so not everyone has to get many kills but a 0.4 kd means you die 2.5x as often as you get a kill which means a maximum of 1 kill per 3 rounds which means the teammates have to perform well to balance it out.
---
I think everything around 1.0 (even a bit under) is fine and it's not like I check people's kds anyway but I understand why VERY low kds turn people off.
---
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Bad players are one thing, but total morons who don’t give call outs or listen to them, take defuser and then run off to die alone, and worse need to be put down. A 4v5 is better than a 4v6.
---
That one has two sides though.
---
You didn't reply to yourself but posted a new comment which made it kind of confusing. But I agree on the fact that KD doesn't matter. Winning does, you can win matches without getting many kills and contribute much more than someone with a lot of kills. It's all dependent on the situation. 
---
This is both the best and worst idea I've ever seen
---
&gt;Anyway, I'll record if that second is giving such a problem
---
Make sure to bring an ADS just in case, OP.
---
It only sucks at bronze where nobody uses drones to begin with. 
---
It's allowed, you can report them for toxicity

---
Trust I know, I play Monty a lot and in 1v1 I got killed exactly like that , from view i was exactly facing toward enemy whilst him being in front of me too and I died.then on kill cam it showed my shoulder peeking a bit.
---
Time for some serious protection

Okay, okay, this was good... I thought I was going to hate it, I had the downvote ready :p

They denied my request, what should I do?

#Sledge and Fuze?

#Smash and insert projectiles?

I'd say some kind of 3D modelling program myself. Definitely stolen though, you'd know your own tools.

It is the whole package, the crouch  spam and the qe spam.

Kaid's gadget works in a sphere, did people not know that?

yeah, I get oregon hatach easily with the wall. Even with a mute jammer.
---
While it seems to be an old issue, this post basically proves nothing since there is indeed a second between both pictures (or do you say 23=24?) and one second is enough for Blitz to change positions.
---
The more you play, the less your rank deviates. That is completely normal as in theory, the more matches you should be placed in your proper "deserved" rank... ranks should be removed. Everyone bothers too much with ranks nowadays
---
Not just pre-firing, but yes. When it's completely clear that you got some shots in, but there's no blood and no health loss
---
Nah, this is fine. Blitz deserves this.
---
I'm not asking when they release did you not bother reading it
---
They're just special Canadians
---
I did read it...
---
Wtf? I can go on /r/Tetris, write a post titled Peekers Advantage Tetris, that irrelevant post will remain there forever, with peekers advantage being in tetris lexicon.
---
Peekers advantage does not exist in the lexicon of csgo community except rare or marginal cases. Just search /r/Rainbow6 and /r/GlobalOffensive for "peekers advantage"; search youtube for "peekers advantage csgo" and "peekers advantage r6s". You will see the difference.
---
On youtube for Rainbow 6, you see guides of how (ab)use it. Peeker's advantage is not something you can use, abuse or utilize in CS:GO. Here is a video that actually reasons, tests and uses numerical values to explain.
---
[https://youtu.be/3JaCcsmjYM8](https://youtu.be/3JaCcsmjYM8)
---
The result is, anything that can be associated to anything like peekers advantage is due to latency that gives negligible advantage FACTOR to the peeker which is far less than other advantage factors such as geometry or inaccuracy of the peeker due to movement, making it inconsequential. When you move on to pro-scene, peekers advantage, even in theory, is inexistent in the LAN environment.
---
If the video you shared is actually relevant, explain to me, how in most cases in that situation (Spawn AWP fight - Dust 2), Terrorist side is the one that most often wins and keeps holding that angle at every round.
---
Explain to me how it is way more commonly known that defenders in CS:GO are way more advantageous and explain how all CS:GO maps are CT-sided.
---
In Rainbow 6, you constantly peek and you always avoid holding an angle waiting. In CS:GO, they are indifferent; other factor play out.
---
To give you counter-examples, I went on Youtube, just searched "esl csgo", clicked the first video and found these moments in a span of few minutes, randomly jumping in the video.
---
How the peeker loses:
---
[https://youtu.be/Z7dpA1mGB\_0?t=1420](https://youtu.be/Z7dpA1mGB_0?t=1420)
---
How the static defender wins:
---
[https://youtu.be/Z7dpA1mGB\_0?t=2958](https://youtu.be/Z7dpA1mGB_0?t=2958)
---
And look at this one how everyone is statically holding angles:
---
[https://youtu.be/Z7dpA1mGB\_0?t=2844](https://youtu.be/Z7dpA1mGB_0?t=2844)
---
If peekers advantage was a thing in CS:GO, do you think pros would even cross the idea of holding angles like that in their minds??? Watch the whole match, you will see tens of moments and positions where pros hold static angles.
---
You were not just doubting me, but also insisting on the opposite, while not knowing your shit. Tell me how much you played CS:GO that you have such confidence.
---
I enjoy fortress a lot. I think the flow is a lot better than most maps.

95% of the players who play casual simply play to win. 
---
Hmmm
---
I'd be down for Ubi to introduce a weekly or bi-weekly mode that changes a rule each week, something in the same vein to Hearthstones Tavern Brawl mode.
---
Thanks! Rn I’m playing a couple of casuals to learn about the map
---
i love that WHAT after Nerf LMG
---
? 
---
Ye might be that youre on relatively unpopulated servers idk :/
---
It is something most ops have
---
Wow those are some high pings.
---
fOrZa iS fUckInG awEsoMe. Bitch its like the most boring shit ever, what so u press WASD and fucking win, so exciting, now could you go and suck someone elses dick please. 
---
Hmm are you sure about the compensation? You can buy the operators in a bundle after a year is done for about 20 bucks (year 1 and 2 are up, year 1 is discounted right). 
---
I'm checking right now, I own Jackal from year 2 but the year 2 bundle is still 2400 R6 credits.
---
The Season Pass is worth it if you buy it at the start of the year. If you buy it now, you'll get the Year 3 operators and their Season Pass  uniforms and headgears plus 600 R6 Credits, but you won't really be taking advantage of the 10% in-game store discount, 5% Renown bonus and 0.3% increased Alpha Pack chance. You will have also missed out on the early access to the Year 3 operators.
---
You'd be better off buying the Year 4 Pass now. You'll get all of the Year 4 operators when they are released (with a week of early access) plus all of the Season Pass benefits for the full year. There's a free universal weapon skin for pre-ordering the Year 4 pass as well, which is pretty decent. Since the Year 4 pass comes with 600 R6 Credits also, you could use that to unlock a Year 3 operator and then just grind for the remaining 6. It won't take all that long if you play the game regularly.

Lmao Kobeeee

Shroud is sitting in the open with non god aim
---
You should see the other clips I have of this dude. He was talking about having a wife on basically every game. He had to be high.
---
What I did was play Casual until I had all but the newest map mastered. The newest map I would go with friends and roam the map until I knew it.
---
I'm sorry im Italian my english isn't perfect.
---
Yes. I usually log out of uplay and it resets 
---
That makes sense too, although I think C9 was looking for a way out, I could be wrong but I think it was the same for Mouse, mouse offered a terrible contract to their players, that’s why they didn’t resign with the org.
---
Shroud gets owned
---
Amazing
---
Sort of. Xbox allows it for games that allow it. Battlefield, ARK, Minecraft, Borderlands (I think?)
---
Pistol? It’s aiming in general that they’re far superior in. Console is harder because controllers are hard to use - everyone potato’s. PC is easier because M&amp;K are easier to use - precise aiming. 
---
See how bringing an M&amp;K over to Console is wrong?
---
If your on my team and I can tell your using s keyboard I’m TK’ing you. You’re scum 
---
Didn't knew ppl use it. LOL
---
It's never too late, if you wanna get good just practice. Load up a custom game and walk around to learn all the maps and angles. Also watch videos from pro league to learn map setups. I'd recommend watching teams like G2, and EG. There's also a YouTuber called varsitygaming who goes over all the siege basics with his siege school playlist.
---
I dont think Borderlands is part of that beta program
---
Seeing clips like this is what deters me from switching to PC from Console
---
I think, one of the biggest problems right now (technical issues like hitreg, netcode and server performance aside) are crouch spamming and the fact, that the bullets come out of the sight instead of the barrel which makes those super tight pixel angles possible. In 99% of the time there's no way to win against someone holding those angles. This is not how a competitive game like Siege should be. 
---
sure you get 8 kills every game with a K/D of 1.0...
---
It doesn’t break the hit box but it should be removed
---
you can’t buy the Year 3 pass right now. You have to wait until Y4 comes out
---
and they said the perfect woman didn't exist...
---
Just use a normal name...
---
No? I coulda swore it was. Maybe a different game.
---
That was just in general. 
---
People get kinda touchy here when you don't go absolutely ballistic over K&amp;M.
---
It's definitely a problem, but just one I haven't dealt with that much. 
---
Lemme check

as someone who hasnt played this game that much (100 hours over 2 years coz had a lot of breaks and startred to play it again recently) i think its rly good guide for begginers to learn what which op does, great work
---
nope don’t see anything wrong *nope not at all*
---
Why don’t you like it? I think it’s one of the best ones they’ve made 
---
1. The problem is apparently being worked on

2. Ditto

3. Not seeing these at all

He should be touching his arse
---
Learn to check corners? Haven't had a problem with this map
---
HEY!
---
It's the one guy who steals clips from streamers and content creators. 
---
I think that instead of making the game more tactical it would mean even bigger fragfest. Planting the defuser would be so much more risky that ppl would just tend to frag it out.
---
here is a super easy fix for this,  just get rid of shields from the game. 
---
That is the ting,  when you play an online game you don't play on the same map with the others,  there are in r6 case's 10 different iterations of the map each created by the user's pc/console and all the data is sent back and forth between the servers and the machines you play on,  and because of poor servers/ poor internet/ poor performance of your pc the data can be wrong. I get it ,Ubisoft does a shit job at managing it, i had more consistent experiences playing WoW for example wich is a fucking MMO, they should put more effort into it but it's not easy.
---
Ubisoft is a huuuge company with a lot of money. They have the resources to fix things like that in no time or at least they should be able to. It takes them far too long to fix glitches and bugs. It should take no longer than 2 weeks to fix things like the Jäger shield glitch but it took them 3 months or so. 
---
I wouldn't discourage doing callouts but if they start acting like children after you do I'd recommend muting both voice and text and finishing the match silently.
---
1. Very happy to hear that. Do you have any official source? 
---
It's Ok just try to play with friends.
---
As much as I hate shields and am happy people arent playing them as much because of this issue I still want it to be fixed cause this shouldnt be happening.
---
I am SO proud of this community!
---
The spooky woman
---
You got to ask yourself though if there are more instances where there’s two soft walls directly above/below each other for this to work.
---
Damn, never knew this about the audio and I’m lvl 279, I’ve just dealt with it lmao. Got to give it a go when I’m on next, thanks man 
---
What time were u playing? This game is an oozing toxic cesspool between about 2pm and 10pm. From where the kids get out of school till their mommies tuck them into bed. Kids for the most part are the bain of the game. The best time to play is from 9AM till about 1PM. I get pretty good teammates and games between those hours.
---
Pretty fucking toxic. What data center are you and time zone?
---
They are not stoping them from working I’m pretty sure. It’s probably they are not fixing them in a timely manner
---
I think, with no professionalism that you need your eara checked 
---
And this is the way I'd like to watch on Siege Youtubers/Streamers. Just quick opening without bitching about common for 10 minutes and then screaming for another 10 minutes because Black Ice/Legendary. Simple, quick and clear. 
---
They do get penalized in ranked, just not casual, that’s what makes casual casual. You are not committed.
---
Sledge main for life. 
---
He never gets enough love
---
 Also u can do this in the garage on Club map
---
Castle rework because it seems similar or better said in mostly every thing better
---
Yeah, if this is happening, check the floor hatches above OBJ... I couldn't tell you why, but I have the same bug where they don't have shields sometimes, and usually their shields can be found halfway buried into the floor hatches.
---
fucking later sights 
---
Well obviously you have some hearing loss if this sound doesn’t annoy you.
---
It's about noise
---
Dear lord you took the words straight out of my mouth lol
---
You can buy them all with renown (which you get for just playing), or credits (which you buy), or paid season passes/bundles.
---
You sound like a fanboy that will defend ubi no matter what lmao... anyone that plays this game knows that shields are fucking broken.
---
W
---
Yeah, it depends on the keyboard. With mine it's very awkward pressing 1/2 while holding W.
---
This just sounds like castle to me? Correct me if I’m wrong. 
---
Also the first one which actually makes the operator look worse.
---
Is there a way to disable the MVP animations?
---
I like some of the skins but dislike the animations
---
5 blitz
---
You get a couple hundred renown for every game you play. Use that renown to unlock new ops or just buy them with real money 
---
You see i feel they(devs) cant fix because they(the higher ups) want to squeeze the juicey money 
---
Do you have a source on “30 million console players”?
---
Siege still has some of the biggest orgs in the world holding rosters, with Liquid being the biggest in the world. Honestly, the biggest problem with Siege pro league right now, as much as I love them and will always support them, is the G2 roster. They're in a position similar to the All Blacks in rugby in that they're near enough unbeatable. Even against their top seed rivals, matches never really feel like they're in any jeopardy because they just run away with it.
---
One of the other orgs needs to spend some money and secure a roster that can really compete, or we'll be stuck with a one team scene. 
---
Pls Ence, be sick again.
---
5 ash. now you can't shoot at anyone
---
You get the yellow money from playing. Each operator is 25,000 renown
---
Wow you're a real piece of work aren't you?

The community's been especially toxic this season. Whether it's due to Christmas players/smurfs, I don't know. But if you're having a bad game expect to get insulted and shouted at by your teammates, that's just the norm now. I'll never understand the mindset of these people. I've put far fewer hours into this season than any other so far because I'm just so demotivated to play.
---
Still a firm believer in the overwhelming majority of people are crying wolf.  I play with both MkB and controller. The times I get messages telling me I'm using MkB while actually using a controller is almost an order of magnitude more than when actually using MkB. You don't know what you're looking at - full stop. 
---
Looks like a fucking UBER driver. Just imagine what it could've been. A WW2 Soviet sniper, a ghillie suit, modern stealth sniper... SO many options, more than other operators.
---
And they went with this Syrian refugee looking motherfucker.
---
My friend, who is also a girl who plays this game, plays with a group of her friends so when she gets harassed, they back her up and try to kick the person who is harassing her.
---
I do it each time my drone spawns in that area!
---
You obvs didn't blast the Soviet National Anthem for all of the 3:45 mins to bless the pack with Lord Tachanka!

You really believe that this type of shit is ok? I don’t ever get shit like this on seige and new players seeing this kind of stuff on female streamers channels drives away new players. I’m glad you’ve got thick skin but for most it’s no fun to play a match where you can’t have a normal conversation or call outs with anyone or have an enjoyable experience because of your fucking gender. Also she’s not complaining just to complain it’s also to get the word out to Ubisoft about this bullshit toxic community and solve an easily solvable issue.
---
This happened to me last season and I got so salty. I lost two ranks from a single game
---
Already left
---
Don’t they all do that I think the frost one does this 
---
You should have used the Hound headgear on smoke 
---
Holding an angle for a minute and the second you stop holding your angle you die from that angle you were holding.
---
I'm not too big on the whole civilian getup. I would be fine if they pulled off some [WW2 soviet sniper](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/01/d8/ff01d8888bb601907c592453f95fcfb3.jpg). Also what special equipment did he get? a different ACOG flipsight? That is a laughing stock to me. 
---
Year 1s are 15,000
---
So all females are just supposed to never talk or engage in a conversation with anyone or never give call outs because of a toxic community that could be fixed???
---
A
---
Oh, i wasnt aware
---
Nerf Bastion
---
Then you're just ruining the game for people in Bronze, no?
---
Reminds me of Kafel https://youtu.be/5Q8LQx6Gaek
---
They probably did not sync it perfectly 
---
What is this post in relation to?
---
i’d say rework castle similar to this (but not as op) instead of a whole new operator. good idea though!
---
After 2 rounds there is a option to surrender most teams that are throwing a game will surrender its stupid and not fun to play against because they try hard the first 2 rounds most of the time. Ive seen people do this on console and pc. But im pretty decent on both platforms
---
That is no discussion right here please give constructive feedback 
---
At first I was like “You were getting spotted, another guy who can’t take losing.” Then I saw it from his perspective, damn
---
I don't think it bothers the majority of the community...
---
Except at a different time
---
I think you’re confused... the year 3 pass was released December 2017... the Year 4 pass was released December 2018... maybe you’re talking about the operator bundles? If so the year 3 one should already be available.
---
I agree with the angles but WTF is he talking about in regards to the clutter? Does he want an empty room? Does he not realize how cluttered other maps are? Does he not have drones or the other methods of finding players?
---
This is why pros should not be helping development, always think they know best
---
What would you consider it then. "If you disagree with me, you are wrong and refuse to accept it" 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8xrfru/cheeky_drone_spot_on_kafe_for_kitchen_objectives/ can even go further.

Most girls I run into in ranked matches end up being complete assholes to me and my friends and they tk near the end of the match just because they are girls and will always get support from the one person who really wants a gamer girl as their friend. I AM NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE, just want to clarify that.

There is plenty of ways to improve the reporting system to give a better idea of what people are doing. They can add a small list of the most common types of offenses and you can report and they can investigate like they currently do. Is it going to fix everything no of course not. But coming on here and telling everyone to get the fuck over themselves doesn’t provide any talking points for anyone to try and improve. If that’s how you feel keep the thoughts to yourself. This was intended to be a discussion not you thinking you’ve got it all figured out.
---
Yeah people suck. If you didn’t get harassed for being a girl you’d get harassed for something else, I promise.
---
Karma
---
20 mins? 15 -30 seconds on east coast 
---
The bandit is a second ahead but the blitz a second behind is most definitely looking at him but yet the bandits screen shows he isn't when it's a second ahead. So he is supposed to be looking at him and have a covered body. Yeah the hitboxes in this game are shit tier. Especially headshot hitboxes imo
---
Well, you certainly did do that. I'll be damned.
---
&gt;Everyone’s brave over an internet connection.
---
This. I dared some people to say that to my face, most of them wimp out. I'm also ashamed of my fellow country people acting like real assholes to those outside. Using a local language doesn't mean you can say whatever shit you like. 
---
They did pretty much nothing. You get banned when you reach 3 teamkills and if you leave a match you lose the same amount of elo as a player who played the match until the end. Yes, you get the 15 minutes ranked ban, but what are they really? You play a casual match and then go straight in ranked again. You get the fama penality too. Wow. Such a punishment.
---
Yeah I've had the same thing happen to me too.. just because I'm a girl. I need a 5 stack of girls honestly lol.
---
I never started we threatened to mute him. The exact way it went down was that we joined into game and the music turned on as soon as we connected. My buddy said “hey can you turn the music off please?” Didn’t respond and music continued to play. He then says “Ok if you leave the music on you’re going to get muted.” And you know the rest. 
---
lol 
---
Cyanide detected 
---
Same thing with Subnautica, its not an horror game lol
---
I think Mozzie will likely take Dokkaebi's logic bomb and get access to their drones that way like how Dokkaebi can get access to defenders phones, Dokkaebi doesn't use a phone to control drones so Mozzie will take her logic bomb instead.
---
Unless next season they have Dokkaebi's dead body drop a phone, However unlike  Dokkaebi where the team can see the camera feed, Mozzie might be the only defender who can see the drone footage like Alibi can only see pinged enemes.
---
If we’re talking bandit’s perspective, yes, it’s absolutely broken and that’s strange. Blitz’s perspective is just fine imo tho. It also sucks this is technically imaccurate since there is a 1 second difference on the clock, but shit happens. And, yeah, headshot hitboxes make me want to shoot my own head only for the bullet to travel through because of the broken hitbox.
---
Awesome!
---
Didn't cope just stopped playing 
---

Where did you get the info that the reason C9 picked up the roster because of Goddess?
---
Better strats and positioning to make up for them having the better shot
---
You call em out and then they say something about how you suck and then you move on lol
---
That's a fact!  I hate playing online games when I have to talk because of this. 
---
holy shit your agenda is obvious the clocks are different in game....
---
It’s way too op. If you are in a 1v1 the defender can just close the doors and hide on site and if there are no windows or the attacker is not a hard breacher or doesn’t have the keys, than he can just go f*** himself.
---
bruh just stop playing blitz you sad fuck lol
---
I think he means they’ll take over drones the same way as Dokkaebi. By getting them off of dead bodies
---
lol its a game it literally doesn't matter
---
I play the game and have fun, when games go how they should go. I don't have fun playing a 3v5 match. I'm complaining so hopefully Ubisoft sees this and actually makes something. I'm not the only one and this is not the only post about this. 
---
I just leave when theres too much toxicity. Even ranked games. I dont like giving toxic players the satisfaction of fuckig with me
---
It's catchy. Every tune tik tok memes are made of are catchy.
---
D E T A I L S

That is awesome! Well done
---
You see this Ubisoft?

This is getting out of hand

Do something!

Sorry this happend to you, we are not all apes
---
Got anything else in mind? I’m on a roll!
---
its a AAA company im pretty sure they only care what the pro players have to say sadly 💔
---
Truer words were never spoken.
---
Most people on this game are assholes regardless of gender though there definitely seems to be more toxicity to females. Unfortunately, all you can do is just mute and ignore them. I've noticed a lot more females playing on Xbox One and I can't account for private messages being sent to them but I don't ever notice anyone harassing them in game. Trolls will find any reason to harass, be it ethnicity, gender, anything really. Just mute them and block them if you can. That's all you really can do, sadly.
---
26876/50000 season passes sold to unlock roadmap y4 /s

But that would make him entirely headshot immune, in a game *revolving around headshots*
---
How does it not fit the theme? Plain clothes counter-terrorists can be very useful in high risk areas.
---
Tip dont sell em u will get strikes trust me
---
Good bot
---
That beautiful plank breaking from beta siege. So smooth, so clean. 
---
Does it also affect your audio?
---
Castel does NOT need a rework!!!
---
No
---
For everyone saying  being outside is part of the game, then why do they expose you when you go outside ? Use your head. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I never said that? Are you just making things up at this point lmfao? 
---
I'd like to use Mira as an example: 2 reinforcements, 2 metal frame, polycarbonate glass Mira windows, a nail gun, crowbar, C4, two weapons, &amp; 200+ rounds of ammo. You fail to realize that these OPs h\*ckin lift.
---
But it's Tuesday 
---
I get it, I’m not a girl but I still sympathize, I’m not gonna pull some “I’m a white knight in shining armor bull shit” but I hate when people act like an asshole to someone in my game, ruin that persons experience, and ruins my experience. 
---
So in the end the toxicity affects the person being harassed, and everyone else as well. It’s just stupid 
---
Love the new blitz buff
---
Yes even cheep $35 AUD ssd will speed up your game a lot.
---
By turning off the game 
---
Its wednesday. 
---
That's all that is good on this map. 😂
---
I agree. But in ranked/pro league, library/kitchen are much less chosen as site than top floor’s two. 
---
I like the idea that Ubi gave us 4 viable sites, but in practice, basement doesn’t serve any useful purpose. Plus, first floor are pretty much non-destructible.
---
It’s an online game. If you can’t emotionally handle stupid jokes mute the chat 
---
People like you are the reason people are depressed. Whenever someone talks about something upsetting them, you people just start bitching about how they're just babies. Get over yourself.
---
I am glad it works for you, I hope our society gets better before I die, this shit depresses me 
---
Ehh... I prefer the fireworks displays in Planet Coaster if I had to look at any in a game.
---
Okay so in a game about communication I should mute them, got it. 
---
That’s about as illogical as turning off friendly fire in this game, it solves the problem, but it breaks the game fundamentally. A mute button is simply a bandaid fix, it doesn’t solve the issue 
---
Every time
---
There was a post sometime recently on reddit addressing this. This all happens because UBI has an absolutely terrible management on their servers, often banning people for "hacking" when they are hard stuck in copper and have a KD less than one (my friend). There needs to be some kind of fix for this. Overwatch has endorsements given to good players. The higher your endorsement level, the more loot boxes you get and that is working somewhat from what I can tell. League of Legends also does something like this, but im not certain. But systems like this are falling flat on their face because nobody can manage all the bad behavior that goes on in game servers, but you can reward people who are a benefit to the community with ease and success. If rainbow gave out packs and endorsements to people who are benefiting the community, then this kind of harrassment would drop at least a little.
---
Yeah but if OP doesn’t have a screen recorder then why should he get one for just this one thing? Plus mashing buttons is fun
---
Damn dude delete this lmaooo don't post it on multiple subs and get mad when people call you out. I just read through your account and you're a weird dude. 
---
If you're a veteran player heck yeah it's worth it. Having early access to the operators and also not havi g to spend your renown on Ops so u can spend it on weapon skins and alpha packs and u get 600 r6 credits
---
Or blow up underwater hostages.
---
Stay on your meds bud. 
---
Thought they were the chibis you get when you buy one.
---
My advice is to make a discord with your friends and slowly add people in that you find and like from your games. Build yourself a community you can play with so you dont have to play with randoms all the time. That’s what me and my buddies did and were nearing 100 people, been great so far. There’s no solution to your problem because people are shit and rainbow 6 cant ban people for that. 
---
No doubt assholes ruin men’s games too, I won’t deny that but it’s not made as personal too often 
---
It's the instant replay thing I think
---
SOG would be nice, ak5c is such a cool gun
---
How is this Rainbow Six related? This is why Reddit should be 18 plus only 
---
Doesn't matter. It's **objectively wrong.**
---
MnK is way better than a controller, are you for real? 
---
Ps4?
---
Oh, okay, because the way you worded the comment was super weird.
---
Good luck finding a game without toxic players.
---
I am a real person yes. I've seen mnk players lol I'd rather have a controller player who knows what they are doing. 
---
Either play with friends. Make it less obvious ur a woman or mute and report for TK and throwing.
---
I do side with OP here. I have seen videos by streamers where they complain about different viewing angles for both parties. 
---
It has happened to me so much that the hidden angle Im thinking is much more open and visible to the other party. 
---
yeah, he has funnier voice lines than mute ;)
---
Teach me too
---
Great solution! Surrender to the tormentors will! Or we could post about it and discuss it in the hopes that Ubi sees and decides to take action against people literally ruining the game for others. Really weird how some in here think the misogynist and trolls are the ones in need of protection lol
---
What a good fucking solution the classic “suck it up” or “hide” advice, bravo you solved sexism

Usually I just get called gay, but that stopped being offensive when I grew up lol, or they just call me bad for missing shots or something. It’s never personal 
---
If you're stuck solo queuing I'm sure plenty of people on the subreddit would join, myself included since I usually play by myself or with a few mates.

Hello Captain_Seasick, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/adyxb5/am_i_the_only_one_getting_sound_bugs_when/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Assholes like you are why people are depressed. They open up and talk about stuff that's upsetting them for once in their fucking lives, and people like you start bitching about how they're babies and should stfu.
---
&gt;Why can't they just listen to the community and remove client side debris and everything we have been asking for?
---
Because they don't have magic-quantum-mechanics server that can handle everything. 
---
Because this isn't just a switch and they can't brute force everything just to solve problems. It's hard to solve issues when the game has an absurd amount of details and mechanics.
---
Its off centered
---
Ahh gotcha, find counters for blitz, finka/lion, and ash.
---
Thank you for existing 
---
Lol wtf
---
Now this is what a Lv 1 Crook looks like.
---
Talking about these experiences to the community is big cause I never really thought about this since I don’t ever come across girls 
---
Yet it’s true
---
i'm my teams main Montange in plat matches and it works pretty well so go for it
---
Thank you for your response 
---
People literally have made alt accounts to call me a slut after I blocked them and said vile things to me and were like, “it’d be fine if you just gave me your snap, then I’d leave you alone”
---
You missed? I dont get what you are trying to say here
---
I mean I wish I could sympathize with you guys but I cant... You're playing an online game trolling and harassment has been a thing since day 1 this isnt all of a sudden happening!! If u get TK'd a lot and harassed here is an idea try making friends and only play with them or just you know dont talk or you know only type... You guys cant bitch and moan all you want about harassment but literally NOTHING is going to change there is really nothing they can implement to combat verbal harassment 
---
Yes having the elephant skin equipped is painful 
---
Once again, why don’t they at least act like they’re listening by responding to the community saying these things? 
---
Maybe stop playing the victim or play ranked. 
---
  "If you think different than either you are the problem, or you ignore the problem."
---
Damn I thought only maestro could do this
---
That's true. However, MnK allows for much more precise aiming than with a controller because you're using your arm/wrist. It does depend a lot on the individual player's skill, but I'm willing to bet a skilled player on PC has better aim than any console player. 
---
I'm sorry this happened. A lot of times people harass me for standing up against toxic people. I say something, and everyone starts bitching about how I'm just a little pussy and need to stfu. I feel you.
---
Right, why would we let the people that play the game the most and have more in game knowledge than anybody else right? Lets just let reddit balance the game... That's how we got our broken Blitz.
---
The devs are also incapable of balancing cause they keep on bringing broken ops like Lion.
---
Doc shot through clash’s shield
---
every time man
---
Next time just look it up on urban dictionary if you happen to be a non native speaker as well, helped me a lot
---
Because if they just mash buttons then you get shit like this?
---
the stories are different, without remorse is just John Clark's background story. it would help you understand John more, but it's not necessary to read it first.
---
Reading the comments on this sub the female gamers' experience really seems to be ass. And that sucks, just like in your experience. Of course this community is very toxic overall, but being a girl just concentrates it on you as there now is someone that differs from the majority and is easier to pick.
---
This paired up with large part of the community being 13-16 year olds who will try to look like a cool kid by harassing women, it's not pretty. 
---
It's idiotic that some people have so little self confidence and a feel of self worth that they will start acting like ass as soon as they see a girl, either to look "cool" or get attention.
---
I've met a couple of female players in the game and one I have as a friend. Very good player, plays for the team etc. Although I have also noticed that she seems to be afraid of using her mic while there are 1 or more randoms in our team. :/
---
So yes even as a male who has not faced that shitshow, I'm there with you. I've sometimes gotten selected as a target for a clan for bullying/mocking and that's bullshit, having that so often must be even more. A behavior like that is idiotic and should not be tolerated! 
---
Rainbow 6 community is sadly full of toxicity and ubisoft doesn't seem to care. A major problem nowadays is bullying but ubisoft denies to listen to us. So dear fucks at ubisoft. If a parent hears someone screaming in voice chat OR sees offensive language in the game that their children play WILL THEY INVEST IN YOUR GAME? NO. WILL YOU LOSE MONEY? YES. Your game is absolute shit. Fortress is unbalanced and has 1 viable objective. The new ops are weak. Your old ops are way to powerful and you just remove them from pro league. WHY ONLY PRO LEAGUE AND NOT RANKED? Why dont you apply the same changes to ranked? Why do I have to lose 50 Elo but then gain 10-25? Why are there smurfs in my lobbies when I am trying to enjoy the game and carry the enemy team with 17 kills 0 Deaths?
---
Fix your game.
---
Make Ranked and pro league the same.(Applies to the changes they make for ops, OP banning etc)
---
Make good gameplay maps and stop focusing SO MUCH on the aesthetics 
---
Fix Hit Registration 
---
Fix shield ops
---
Add a "Join in progress match" toggle in the settings
---
Wake up battleye 
---
Do what CS:GO and Overwatch did: get a few trusted good sports volunteers to judge toxic behaviour and ban people if you are too lazy to do it yourself
---
I know you have the resources to fix the game. Do it or you will lose your supporters and Siege will become just like PUBG. Dead because of its bugs and toxic community
---
Last of all, I get that smurf accounts are purchased and I get it on PC. But on console the account is free to make and everyone can get access to infinite smurfs. Why not limit the accounts used by one IP?
---
If they're the last one alive then it kills them immediately after downing them. If they still have teammates alive then they just go into a downed mode where they need to be revived by a teammate. 
---
I don’t like it as it is hard to breach from above
---
What’s wrong with wanting to respect women in the siege community? If you don’t think that sexism is a problem in drive then idk what you’ve been playing. This is a definite issue. If you don’t see it, that may be because you are not/have not played with a girl on your team. It happens a shit ton
---
ahhh.. i see it now. thats op
---
I guess it depends. Do you find yourself the last one to load in almost every single game? Then having a faster load time might help with the toxicity that came come with it otherwise it doesn't really matter. I personally don't have it on SSD and am rarely ever the last to load in (in casual I've seen several vote kicks for long load times). 
---
It also, depends on how big your drive is. If you need to conserve space and don't have the load time issue then I wouldn't bother. If you have 1TB or something then I'd say go for it.
---
Well I like it.
---
You called your mom a bitch because she was telling you to do your chores which should have already been done so your daddy whooped your ass with a belt because your calling his wife a bitch who gave birth to you and has been raising you for 14 years and counting? Correct me if I’m wrong but you definitely deserved it.
---
Do what I do, I have an accent and I don't feel ashamed of it, when people make jokes about trump and the wall and deportation I joke around it to try and get along sometimes it works somethimes it backfires but if it does I just mute them and disable chat and play ny mu own. At  the end of the day more often than not I do better than them.
---
Yeah that’s pretty sad, it’s a bunch of thirsty idiots. Who cares if it’s a guy or a girl, just play the damn game, we are all humans 
---
No it can be changed and fixed, just because it’s always been here doesn’t mean it won’t go away, that attitude you have is why it doesn’t go away, people just don’t give a shit because it’s how they think it should be, if we collectively started respecting each other and actually as a society agreed it was vile to harass people online it’d reduce the occurrences drastically 
---
I don’t know your life and what your relationship is like with your mama, but honestly me I wouldn’t have let your friends come over until you cleaned up and honestly you were way out of line saying that to your mama, you humiliated her in front of your friends by calling her that . You should probably make up with your mom and  apologize even if you did get whooped then just laugh about it with your friends if they bring it up or change the subject 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
He definitely has moral high ground on you based on your posts tho
---
In my opinion
---
I get up on the trash can, then hop up on the satellite dish.
---
Must be your first video game
---
Amazing title
---
Honestly a girl getting harassed is nothing....
---
When youre a gay guy playing, that harassment is probably 50 times worse than youll ever get 
---
Just wanted to see if there was anybody else who dealt with this problem as well. Damn people find ways to get angry over nothing all the damn time.
---
&gt; based on your comment history
---
[real controversial statement right there](https://i.imgur.com/fEWdXyT.png), nothing like some good ol' fashioned ad hominem to make someone even give less of a shit about what you have to say.
---
&gt; Get outside, pet a dog and stop being so bitter.
---
lol, pot kettle etc
---
Oh I totally agree, my point is this pic isn’t a good example of the issue since it’s not verifiably the game screwing up
---
OP can say whatever he wants. If he can't realize that he provided a faulty result i'm sure if i can believe on everything he says.
---
If you know exactly what is the problem you can mail the dev team with a fix, since it's so easy to solve.
---
“” “” “” “”
---
Yeah. Plane and House are competitively shit. But at least they feel like places that could exist that way. 
---
Fortress has such an absurd layout I can’t even comprehend why things are where they are. 
---
Whereas I find Clubhouse and many older maps feels very realistic and natural in design. 
---
its true that on second could be enough for the blitz to move 😂
---
There are a lot of things wrong with that sentence. I genuinely couldn't figure it out until skyrth said something.
---
I was just trying to finish the game 
---
Lmao no not doesn’t?! This wasn’t some screenshots taken after saving a video replay of an actual match and then going back and cherry picking places to take the shots to show the issue.
---
It was op and a friend doing it to show what Is an actual problem... I main blitz often. Op has said so elsewhere. Get the facts before you make statements, otherwise you seem ignorant. As you do here. 
---
**MP4 Link:** https://lew.la/reddit/clips/adzs7q.mp4 
---
Most you can do is mute them i suppose. I have a friend i play with a lot and shes a girl from kentucky. She gets a lot of what you experienced every day, but not jus for being a girl but also how her country accent makes her sound like a little boy and incest jokes, ect.
---
She gets scared to use her mic sometimes cuz of these situations but i suppose just muting the haters immediately is all you can do. Theirs always the chance youll meet nice people and make sure you try and form full parties with them.
---
I do feel bad that you experienced this, but an important thing to hold on too is that it’s not just you. 
---
Online gaming is toxic, I’ve been doing it for 15 years, I’m a dude, and I hear it daily.
---
In an ideal world all these people should get hit by a bus.  But the reality is, lots of people can be dicks and you just have to not be a dick and be a better person.
---
Good luck Op
---
The problem is even if you keep your cool, what can you do? You can't see or hear, the only counter is to knife and shoot and hope you kill him. There are rush counters but no counters for the flash (besides mute technically) other than random chance that you kill them. 
---
Lol... dok is trash and so ade her weapons. 
---
Yes, custom games (maybe T-Hunt?) only. If you really wanna play it and get rewards Article 5 is still set there
---
casuals are casuals made and for casual players, while ranked is for more serious players, casual players most of the time enjoy anything that's a constant loss.
---
For casual players 1 good match and its all good while for more serious ones 1 bad match and everything is all bad. (basically)
---
Yeah do the last situation lol. Im not sure if its still in casual since I dont play that 
---
Custom games and t-hunt
---
Yeah cause worst case scenario you knife and shoot at least then you could hear where he is and try to get a more accurate defense. 
---
Their*
---
&gt;There were bad matches that left a bad taste in my mouth, but nothing that made me play worse like I was doing then. 
---
This toxicity is probably my biggest frustration with some people on Siege and it's getting beyond a joke now. Memo to all - *abusing your teammates is not helping you win.*
---
If it's not profitable its because a few teams are dominating a relatively small space. When was the last time NA sent anyone but EG and Rouge to a lan?
---
I mean maybe in a perfect world if he had a slightly larger shield and shield mechanics worked perfectly from server to server and glitches didn’t exist so that you could perfectly rely on your shield to do what it’s supposed to. At the moment you need the flash to prevent instant death as it’s very easy to kill a blitz that just runs at you with no aid. 
---
It looks good but has bad Bomb locations
---
Communication between the community and the devs has steadily dropped off. As the game has become more popular the communication has gotten less. Ubi is silent on addressing most of the problems the community has. It is quite depressing. 
---
Well if I’m in a squad I do my best to be effective with comms. Obviously I’m not talking non-stop and distracting if it’s not relevant. Not sure to which point you’re curious about.
---
If you get flashed by a blitz rush at where they where knifing. As a blitz main. First off this will throw the blitz off his game. And secondly it gives you a pretty solid chance for a kill. I've had it done to me and I do it to shields all the time
---
I played Valk lots before, during, and after the nerf/buff. I think it's back down to where it used to be, but my aim was off due to being so used to the buffed version
---
You're joking right?  That was obviously lag.
---
lol I truly understood nun of that but I believe you 😂 I love my finka
---
Ubisoft actually does react swiftly with this. 
---
https://youtu.be/BppZP5Ns7zk
---
3:30 in the video you see sexual harassment and ItsEpi bans them before they even finish the ranked game.
---
We out here noticing those D E T A I L S
---
I would argue it's very hard to kill him at close range currently. 
---
It's not even issue with bombsites. Issue lies within the map. There are so many breachable walls and soft covers, it's a heaven for Ash, Zofia, Maverick, Sledge and Buck mains. There are too many entry points, and likewise too many spawnpeek positions. Favela from a gameplay perspective just does not work well overall. 
---
i think more like a permanent thing so you can do it whenever would be better and make more sense
---
I find it best to run the SMG-11 with the M590A1.
---
You’ve misunderstood. The Razer Turret is just a mouse and keyboard. It’s not an adaptor so won’t work with Siege.
---
Yeah but lots of attackers have access to flashes in one way or another so why pick on blitz when he’s technically easier to kill than a Ying for example
---
That doesn't do anything
---
I would argue back that it’s very hard to kill *any* op at close range if they surprise you with a flash bang 
---
I always jump off the roof and try to land on the plastic chair by the stairs.
---
They don’t have to buy any of that except the mnk which isn’t expensive. You can’t compare all the other stuff they already have. I used mnk on console; it’s not expensive. 
---
i *would*... IF I EVER GOT FAVELA THAT WASN'T DAYTIME
---
And yes i know its not their dog so please dont comment about it :)
---
Not if you know their weaknesses. When you play as one you realize just how weak of an operator choice they are. They just have a playstyle most players arnt familiar with countering 
---
thats alot of damage
---
Ugh, yes
---
You can look away from flashbangs without getting shot in the back (usually). Then if there’s tables or desks and such Blitz can often rush without worrying about his legs being shot, c4 is easy to block or rush past depending on where it’s thrown. His only real concern is players using crossfire or traps. Have a thatcher or Montagne to team with and worse cancer comp than lion/dokk.
---
I’d personally balanced shields by removing melee, from them, but let them reload from behind their shield (Montagne would have to have undeploy his shield for this though). He can still rush in and blind but gets rid of that broken ass shield melee vs knife fights, so they’d either have to expose their head to kill, or rely of hip fire luck, which give defenders a chance to flank/juke/melee their shield away.
---
Awesome!!
---
Its like you're new to the internet lmao.
---
You keep bringing up blackbeard but blackbeard is so different. He's not a shield OP. Not really.
---
Because he can flash you along with the combination of a shield in front of his face, so you can't spray and kill him. Also he is not affected by the flash. At least young you can spray down. 
---
Yo I discovered this myself and was so happy
---
I’m honestly surprised this is PC. Most PC players are totally respectable to both genders. However in the event you solo queue and this shit happens, just use text chat. Once you get really good you could use voice chat at any time and they won’t talk shit because they need to communicate and win. Hell, I have a working mic but I still prefer to use text chat when i solo queue, even though I’m a guy.  I only use it in Ranked because I’m Gold 3 (*or was*) and I want to improve my elo. I still (somehow) got 15 kills and 3 4Ks last time I got a silent ranked game. 
---
fuck i put a lot
---
Zofia. Has a 2 in 1 utility and lmg 
---
Not sure how you are having problems with it? its about the same amount of recoil as other shotguns. 
---
Ew 
---
No, he's saying that 1) Room clutter is okay as long as its easily distinguished from enemy outlines 2) A lot of 90 degree angles creates to many spots defenders can lurk in. 
---
Some 90 degree angles are fine. But too many makes it unnecessarily difficult for attackers to check their surroundings. On other maps, even with no drones up, you can check angles one at a time.
---
kinda negates the point of them being seasonal now doesn't it
---
The point is that all he has is a shield over his face and nothing else and still is a viable operator. Blitz doesn't need a full shield, flash, speed, and the ability to run with his shield up. 
---
I actually got used to q and e as lean buttons quite quickly :)
---
I use my mouse buttons for push-to-talk and secondary gadget
---
You can remove melee as in higher elos that's the only viable attack. You don't use your pistol in higher level games 
---
i like it
---
Ah that is very true
---
Oh it's her favorite game for sure. But she only plays with me
---
Jesus wants a hug!
---
Sent!
---
If you’d make a Jackal one I’d want to buy it!
---
Basically one of the best compilation of all the things that needs to be said!
---
He does because he only has a pistol. And to be honest it's not even a good pistol
---
I mean I'd kill for the bandit set to come back but it was seasonal, they'll probably make new ones for the old operators when they run out 
---
The other ops though can flash bang themselves, so there is skill in throwing one and pushing. There is little to no skill in flashing and sprinting directly at someone. 
---
I have now played ~6h on pc and my aim is already better than with a controller xD
---
Maybe a dumb Ying who vaults, and you can spray down a vaulting blitz as well. A good Ying would candela and then shoot you from cover thus preventing a spray down. You can also spray down a blitz as well you just need to aim down and down him from leg shots 
---
u sound salty
---
If you try to correct your crosshair placement a bit you might just find yourself getting more aces! 
---
Nice job otherwise (:
---
They really should bring this back for casual. This map was always really fast paced, which is a good break from walking around theme park completely lost for 2 minutes.
---
That would be nice 
---
Jesus loves y'all
---
Agreed!
---
No, its really not, that thing takes you to the ceiling in one or two shots, on PC, it takes an entire magazine to teleport to the ceiling
---
I usually play like 2 or 3 Rounds before jumping into an online match so this should work, thank you :)
---
But he had a full shield and a very quick ads time 
---
Keep teammate high lights on kids. 
---
K then
---
No, the whole shield is impenetrable. He might have shot your shoulders
---
Haven’t played it. Is there a reason you have a problem with me using the pistol or?
---
I'm really sorry to hear that ;~; You have my condolences, while I have not experienced that nor will I probably ever...  I've still been harassed a fair bit for my icon/name. It's an adorable gryphon and I absolutely love it... just as much as some people love to kill 'furfags'. Whether it's verbal abuse, teamkilling, or chipping at my health to avoid the kick.
---
I hope Ubisoft steps up their game because you shouldn't have to go through this shit just because you're a girl. For waht it's worth, you're welcome to play R6 with me if you like. I play relatively often, I'm absolute ass at the game but hey... I play for fun ^ ^
---
Stop being a reflexive downvoter and listen.
---
When the time doesn't *at least* match, nobody can tell whether it was falsified or not (*pic, turn, pic*), therefore it doesn't prove anything.  
---
To be clear, I'm not saying this isn't a legitimate problem with shields - it is - I'm merely saying that using this tactic for photos and not even *appearing* to have taken the screenshots at the same time doesn't accurately demonstrate anything. Just stage the situation and sync videos from both perspectives, that way your audience can at least tell that whatever you're attempting to prove is an accurate test.
---
LÄMP
---
Im always "salty" but right ;)
---
Yeah smoke is client side and I've used them to pass doorways that I thought were fully obscured by smoke only to be seen clearly through it. I don't use smokes often but its happened a few times and really grinds my gears 
---
Yeah same
---
Cannot unsee that ever since I saw that video
---
This is the exact reason why I have all communications blocked and never use voice chat. It sucks yeah, but I rather play in silence and peace than get harassed constantly. 
---
And no range or health if you can hit any spot but the side of him. That feels balanced to me. If you die to a shields pistol its because you're not playing right. And all that means is its super easy to keep a shield put unless you leave a hole in your defenses
---
#*DETAILS*
---
I’m so sorry this happened to you. I’ve dealt with the same stuff. Being a girl who plays siege. It really sucks that we have to deal with this stuff in this game because some guys don’t know how to react around women. 
---
Don’t let them get to you, we’ve got your back and girls unite in this game. Keep on Sieging. 
---
If you are flashed and a blitz runs at you there is no spraying them. A good ying can use a candela to her advantage but a blitz just crouches and you can't spray his feet. 
---
Not in casual. 
---
Turn your computer off, or take it off wifi, also take your phone off wifi. 
---
Ah, to be fair I haven't played on PC, and I main shotguns on almost all characters that have them, so I have gotten pretty much used to fulltime recoil management. 
---
Internet can be toxic, that's why you can mute people, I do not know people that doesn't have R6 chat muted xD
---
Removing melee from shields isn’t a balance it’s a neuter. Shields’s already have the entire game stacked against them so to ‘balance’ a shield would be to give them more strength not less mate. 
---
Same here...i can get to like 56gb free, still short :(
---
Oh
---
Internet 
---
it really be like that sometimes
---
but seriously, the people who do this are complete assholes and deserve to be taken off the game, maybe if RS6 had a place where you can post video footage of people being toxic in VC's to give each person doing this in the least a 2 day ban which gets longer every time they get banned. Sorry for the experience these assholes gave you and I hope this is a much less common problem in the future.
---
Killcams aren't accurate
---
All three are good... I would go zofia, her grenades are useful.
---
I’ve done all of this :/
---
Yes but there are very few gadgets or op gadgets that require a lot of skill to use to successfully get a kill on attack. 
---
But if you are flashed you can't do that. You need a ton of luck to be flashed and hit him behind his shield. 
---
Na-nani?!
---
As someone who doesn’t know how to do all that, if I post a photo like this with less than one second difference. It’s automatically not legit enough to show a problem? They weren’t moving, they stood still for that shot. The counter means nothing at all because it clearly shows what the op was trying to show and also addressing the problem.
---
And who the he’ll are you calling a reflexive downvoter? Did you forget you downvoted me first? I’m not downvoting you because of reflex, I downvoted you because what you said I don’t agree with. Because in this situation the counter doesn’t mean jack. 
---
Competitive and ranked are not the same thing. In competitive everyone has assignments for droning and Cav players get spotted and hunted down. Having a player drone for you and pushing Cav with two players to refrag is an extremely effective way of killing Cav and it makes her quite useless on comp. Even if players are smarter with her (G2 and other teams have run her in the past) she really doesn’t bring much to the team unless she gets an interro which is highly unlikely in comp. In ranked things are very different. We play it for fun and nobody wants to have droning assignments and to be locked down to hunting roamers in pairs. This makes Cav a lot more viable in ranked. That’s fine. But if you run into her she can down you in 2 shots. In high plat and diamond the silent step strafe and prefire you and even if you land a couple shots on her she wins. Most fights in this game will happen on a range where Cav doesn’t feel the drop off from her pistol unless she spawn peeks. But 1v1 she will beat out most ops. With the exception of shield ops including Blackbeard. I’ve seen so many pros talk about this on stream I know I’m not the only one who has this opinion. I don’t think she’s as broken as a lot of ops in this game but that pistol is op. IMO.
---
And that's when you knife
---
If your on pc, insurgency sandstorm is out. Definitely recommend.
---
How did you get knock knock as your flair? I thought it was ops only. Also I’m single btw 😉 
---
Don't deny your heritage, son.
---
its impossible to get team for  Article 5 even on pc 
---
wish ubisoft would  just unlock the reward once you reach Article 5 now as you cant even solo play it 
---
real shit
---
NO he didn't get reworked... he only got CHANGED!!! How is lion who can basically stop u from any movement be less balanced than black beard?
---
We were promised with a COMPLETE rework for Lion!!! Not just some half-assed balance for casual games! IF the enemy has 2 ppl cooperating and one is using lion they can basically win the whole round!
---
Blackbeard changes pose, he pops a fatty THONK
---
Yeeeaah, I'm realizing that there's a fair chance that the people who type their callouts are actually female.
---
Every damn time
---
I don't play much, BUT...for some reason my in-game voice-chat just will not work.
---
It's pretty fucking glorious.
---
Nice.
---
Sup
---
Thank you so much for your help! 
---
I think it is a little worse then it was. You can't throw a cam from the Great Room floor to the wooden ceiling beam on Chalet any more.
---
So then run away? Rotate through the map. If you’re in a position where you physically have no way out other than winning the gun fight - those situations are what shield ops are made for so you can’t complain because of your bad positioning. 
---
It lets people join back in again just in case game crashes. Is that what you're asking?
---
I will now
---
I know the video, I just pointed out that this post is pointless since it proves nothing. The old video did.
---
Congrats!
---
I hope you posted this as a joke
---
Thanks for the advice! I thought I could deal with them since I didn’t want to make the game harder with lack of information flow. But then again..... Well. I guess you can call it a “pick your poison” situation. I’ll definitely take your advice into account next time!
---
better than tower IMO
---
The whole shield should be impenetrable but this game was made by 3 people using equipment made by starving blindfolded monkeys, so shields don't work like they supposed to sometimes. 
---
It's lik going to carnival but cheaper POG
---
When behind a shield your legs arms/shoulder are exposed to the player in front of you. Crouching makes you much harder to kill behind a shield. This applies to all shields except Montaigne when he is fully deployed 
---
It was, relax

Hired, for three hundred.

Truth.

What's subtle about it? Blitz melees Pulse, which is what he does. The he steps in a Frost trap and Frost is happy, obviously.

Siege always has realistic counter-terrorist scenarios. Rescuing hostages, fighting rock aliens, defusing bombs, breach and clear tactics. I think you're right about this.

Hey! This is my first animation! I'm a bit new to the pixel art community, but I've been playing Rainbow Six for about a year now and I decided that I wanted to draw my main. Any criticism/tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

He's only a Season old though.
---
Let some of the older Operators have their chance.

Where are you finding the complete edition at that cost? I thought it was like 130 USD
---
Have you ever heard of losing connection? The players that lose connection a match are returned to the home screen where they can rejoin the match. This wouldn’t work if you were immediately hit with a penalty
---
Yes, it will definitely help by a ton.

However, the problem is, there is almost always at least one person within the 5 v 5 match, does not have an SSD which ruin the load time for everyone else.
---
You have connection issuse
---
Oh no! Poor you!

I hear people talk about playing specific maps and modes on T Hunt. Is there a way to pick? I didn’t see a T Hunt option in the custom match choices.

But the night vision goggles covered her entire face too..?

You’re bad at rainbow, I can tell from this clip 
---
i thought i was the only one!

"Let it go! Let it go! Can't throw my cams far anymore!"

Aw that sucks! I hope that doesn’t discourage her from playing! Some people just think they’re the shit and that they’re cool enough to not be a decent person. I hope that this kind of behavior can decrease and not get worse....
---
Better question would be, who did it happen?
---
Why didn't you post when the meme was relevant?
---
Unfortunately, guys are almost always douche nozzles. Especially ones over the internet, because they're cowering behind the curtain of anonymity.
---
I play Overwatch and CS:GO in-between Siege, but thanks for the suggestion.
---
I wasn’t on Reddit at that time :p and just now used Reddit for the first time on my computer where all my pics and vids are saved
