Capital is similar to fuze he has a good AR and a better ability, he has a tactical crossbow which can shoot 2 fire arrows and 2 smoke arrows. Also he is a 3 speed so he's much faster.
---

---
Fuze is not used much in ranked because his ability is very loud and it makes you vulnerable when you're applying the cluster plus hes a 1 speed.

---
I had the song 'medicine' by Bring Me The Horizon running through my head while this clip played.
---
I'm just still baffled that Phantom Sight didn't get one.
---
Does the same happen with mozzies one?
---
AAHHH THANK YOU
---
A soul for a soul
---
Fuck Dokkaebi
---
Yessir
---
Yooooooooooo
---
Thank you
---
Yeah I was there! Thank you!
---
There is a way, just hardware ban the players who ddos, a ddos can be detected when an entire enemy team gets booted, or there are huge ping spikes to everyone at once. Sure it may not be this simple but there should be a way of detecting it.
---
Very nice 😂😂🤦
---
Ubi please

Scroll
---
The ranking system in CSGO is trash
---
I used to be MG but then my GPU broke and it took me a couple of months to get a new one and when I came back my rank decayed to fucking silver 1 even though my recalibration game was literally the easiest game of my life
---
Yes I bet you did lol
---
yeah. every free week we get another 1 million free players.
---
Thank you!!
---
Yes
---
Test
---
Oh boy, a very loaded question... Well I thrifted the shirt, wear black jeans, bought the patches/pin online from a BOPE collector, bought all the tactical gear from Amazon, and 700$+ later here we are... 😂😂💀
---
Just before I got decent with smg-11
---
Yessir I sure did
---
Relativley even competition is the most fun, followed by dominating. At diamond the skill gap can be massive and the cheese extra cheesy.
---
Yes yes I have 🤦😂😂😂
---
Thanks brother
---
Thanks!
---
Yep sure did!
---
No one knows
---
Finka/Zofia/Capitao LMG rush plant. Someone without an lmg plants while they sling lead at the enemy.
---
We simply don't know for sure yet. Even if you cancel your subscription today the Free Trail stays active until the end of the month. So we won't know for sure until then, unless Ubisoft makes an official announcement about it.
---
Awh thank you, I promise no matter how intimidating I look, I'm not that bad... 💀💀
---
😂😂😂
---
[removed]
---
AWH! THANK YOU!! It means so much to hear that you enjoy my streams... 💙💙💙
---
Yep!
---
Don't worry about it it's being taken out of the ranked map. Pool next season.
---
You can get on top as a defender using a deployable shield and some parkour
---
Yes I was
---
could you link me the patches? i would love to be cav for halloween or something
---
I dont think you know what toxic means...
---
I'm sorry, I just got a good ring of pictures from majors 😅
---
Awesome I love his videos and nice cosplay
---
I mean he made a clear point contributing to the discussion but everyone's jumping on his ass because they assumed he's bragging about his rank...
---
BRO THOSE FLICKS
---
He looks so happy :)
---
I'm 5"9 he's like 6" 5 hes tall, I'm used to being tall, it felt funny.
---
Agreed. Thank you!! 💙
---
They'll 100% do a graphic update with new console launch if it keeps getting more popular like it is rn
---
Serious question, is the hologram ADSing or not, I can’t tell
---
Nice... Solid, Catia, Edge...?
---
Farming in Thunt ... got all the chibis and a shit load of stuff from all time i spent blasting away at Thunt , but personaly i prefer Bomb as the mode, its the only one where you can try out stuff and have some fun for a prolonged period of time , i feel both regular Thunt and extract to become the same every round pretty fast and that is boring, plus its half the time playing , half the time in loading screens.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bomb takes a bit longer but as you develop your own "safe" spots to ensure the win and get that bread you have a bit more fun in the process .
---
A very good tip the OP gave and that its underrated its that Score=Renown , so all those barbed wires and c4s lying around are renown waiting to be farmed ,also in bomb a very good tip is to wait for the terrorists to start defusing and only then shot them in the head , 85 pts a kill , rinse repeat.

\*re breakable\* unbreakable would be broken asf

Damn, how long did it take you?

Mod? This is an online game.
---
It's gonna be happening when Ember Rise drops.
---
Zofia is a lot of fun. I’ve been playing her a shit load lately. Her gadget is powerful, having a claymore is super useful on a lot of maps, and her rifle is crazy accurate with decent rate of fire and damage. Would hard recommend picking her up

---
lmao every operators ability has featured a "game-breaking bug" at this point
---
No but he wasn't even on my head if you look. He's not even near my geady
---
No. I'm saying if you use it on an unbroken reinforcement it would become unbreakable. If the reinforcement is damaged in any way it just gets repaired. It goes from soft to hard, and then add this guy and make unbreak
---
How the fuck did she not kill you lol. Holy moly what a garbage player
---
Link to 1?
---
The flashhiders affect the first 3 shits the most, but do affect all shots
---
The compensator affects all shots by a small amount
---
And the muzzlebreak affects the first shot only
---
Recruit besto Jojo
---
If only they would put this in the game
---
I counted 10, including the hidden one behind the gargoyle.
---
Nice
---
Yes he will get the year 4 ops, I am currently game sharing as well and have seen it work.
---
A I see you're a man of culture as well
---
You’re probably not wrong. I mean, just recently we’ve had IQ and Clash, rewind even further and we have 5-speed Blitz
---
The mpx is so bad that you had good precision and still lost a quarter of your health.
---
You never hit her, and she hit you with the bosg... what's the problem here?
---
Nomad not killing you hurts my soul.
---
No not that I didn't hit her. Look at her scope and look at my head. She wasn't even close
---
I’m sorry everyone has made this joke not good anymore
---
That... that was beautiful
---
Very carefully
---
I heard she was the secret sister to Zofia and Ela but I really dont know
---
[REDACTED]
---
This title is fucking hilarious
---
wow parents that are slightly interested in your hobbies thats totally unheard of
---
Have you ever gotten a grenade kill in someone doing the runout spot on Fortress? It gives me the biggest feeling of power.
---
Haha this is exactly what happens to me 😂😂
---
Is that like a USB?
---
I think you meant to say "It's not stupid if it works"
---
Man, you're such a badass.
---
So the April fools event but on bank and instead of kid's toys, it's a realistic cops and robbers. Hmm. I think it'd be better if it was more like t-hunt dudes without guns and have special civilian skins, and the defenders spawn outside and have 1:30 to go in, secure the bank and tie up the civilians as hostages, then after the 1:30 the attackers come in as a SWAT team, team spawn, no unique. Attacking ops: shield op (Blitz), one breacher (thermite),  droner (Twitch), stealth op (Nøkk),  stunner (Zofia), and recruit, all of them in formal S.W.A.T. Tactical gear (guns and vanity). Defender ops: Armor (Rook), stealth (Vigil), protection  (Castle), camera/CCTV (Valkyrie), explosive (Goyu(?)), and recruit.

Its fully made dude. It’s gonna come out.

What do you mean? If you playing with friends tell them to ready and if with randoms it wont kick you.

Yeah like they said before stop spamming lean, I'm pretty sure they put a patch out so it literally does nothing to stop you from getting head shotted not to long ago.

yes it does mean you are in blast range, at least for frags
---
Just tested it for you cause i am super bored, and if your inside the indicator for the grenade (frag/flash) it will take effect either being taking damage or make your whole screen white, as soo as you are outside of the indicator of the frag grenade your ears will still ring but no damage taken, as soon as your outside the flash-bang grenade no effect will happen.(keep in mind to see the indicator you have to be in line of sight)
---
Yea just the best part of humanity tbqh
---
alright thanks i appreciate you going out of your way to help 👍
---
Must have been a glitch. I was with randoms and was 1/5 for a retry, but it closed matchmaking. Worked on my next attempt though (so far).
---
Ypu need to set settings for house get one friend and than go on normal thunt and play as squad only. Or you can play alone nornal thunt but that wont give you map house.
---
No problem just super bored :)
---
It’s basic logic to echo yourself then run all the way around the house and kill someone while being detected the whole time? Must not be that basic because I didn’t know
---
Good :)
---
Agree

I've had it get to 60 min then the game gave up and kicked me from the queue
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the cake itself. You said it, you're under 18. That makes this normal. My point is about how young people play the game, not about cake. And the fact that you type in complete sentences actually speaks volumes about your maturity. But let's be real, I'm just butt hurt about getting fragged by squeakers.
---
Yeah :(
---
She currently has 1080
---
R6 is still laggy and buggy sometimes
---
I think you’re gonna like Ember Rise

I have never seen something better

She sadly is weak OP, however I like her :3

nice and 40 mil are smurfs. including me. fucking idiots

The potato though

Pretty sure it’s a one time thing
---
Idk, looks like you’re the toxic one here.
---
so....its been 11 days have you posted it yet? I genuinely want to see how upvoted the post gets lol
---
Yes, a 5 sided square
---
Did you leave the game and then it crashed or did it crash in game
---
nah, I didn’t actually post it. was just making a joke
---
Sometimes people focus more on other things rather than video games

But I want to know it's not just me!

Shotgun shotgun combo is the fun-est way to play jackal

You on PC ? we’re settling it, Ned Flanders vs Jackal

I don’t get why people dislike spawn peeking. If you play as cautiously outside as you do inside you’ll be fine.

Yep they've come so far and now it's only 2 of those things! Great job ubi! 😃

200k player peak.

its like some of those 50mil are smurfs.
---
Such a fucking stupid response. You are literally ruining the round or game for someone, which is *unequivocally* wrong as there is a penalty attached. 
---
Go Play something else if you like to TK or think its just a cool part of the game. It is literally the worst part of siege.
---
“Oh hey I got it!”
---
I tried restarting before I made this post, and it was the same. But I just restarted it again and it's working now.
---
nope. epi already said it's basically a cat and mouse game. so they're not gonna even try
---
No. 
---
Not even a little bit.
---
It's really a nice thing for me, because I have no problems with aim and can outstand a few people in seconds, then they realize they said something wrong, and quit. (Happened in ranked over 6 times)
---
I doubt they’re from the free week considering [they have almost 500 hours playtime ](https://r6.tracker.network/profile/xbox/Woolies%20Pavlova)
---
Pro League is a pre-determined LAN setup.
---
I'm sure its in the contract of Pro-League about this.
---
As for 99% of the community (protip, Fuck Proleague), monitors should be chosen by the player.
---
Don't worry i have it too, we all suffer from bad packs.
---
I tried once on villa, I was afk I only put one Mira up, we didn’t have Bandit so Hibana opened it and I tried putting the Mira but it doesn’t work, instead I used the hole as a soft wall besides a Mira to peak from the new Mira, maybe it patched like 1/4 of the hole or less when I put the new Mira besides the hole
---
Well then they were really bad
---
You are heavily over estimating a XiM, you can get then off Amazon for like $120 which is less than have you're claiming. And I'm not saying it's a common thing but it is the circumstances of some people. And the deformity generally causes the player to not play very well in comparison to able-bodied opponents so the question I asked before still stands, is it cheating to play with a disadvantage?
---
I was thinking about making this opertor shoot one pellet and it would unfold kind of like gridlock's trax does but making a solid bulletproof wall with castle-like strenght. Good if u kill the Maverick and want to patch it up and such things. I think it would be really a great idea.
---
Yeah, fuck that!
---
*I'm fast as fuck boi*
---
But if it’s the size of a hibana pellet it’s going to be smaller than almost any hole made by any operator
---
You forgot to übercharge yourself

HK police are currently brutalizing protestors. "support the HK police bundle" a *bit* of a terrible phrase to have on a bundle at this point in time.

Oh it’s because I had it on my Xbox but then I also bought it on my PlayStation

I know I'm not saying they did in direct correlation to these incidents but I thought it was funny

I am severely disappointed from the lack of Dio poses.

I played ash Holo since year 2 so I'm pretty used, try to frag in t-hunt bomb.

Are u summoning the god of internet by any chance?

When it's on a massive sale, people stock up on keys/accounts I guess?

You can cancel it right now and it'll stay active till next month but won't renew.

That’s awesome
---
Lol
---
Face app
---
Depends on the round count but for the most part that’s still the best way t hunt doesn’t give you anything
---
I used to like Varsity and hes very good at the game nut he can be kinda arrogant sometimes. Like he was doing an episode of solo Smurf and I believe he was in gold and one of his teammates got an Ace and they were really excited about it and he preceded to shit on this kid to his stream talking about how Aces aren't really that impressive and that if you get it the game it really doesn't matter how many people you're going up against. Like let people enjoy something thats difficult.
---
Do ur challenges lol
---
When you spot the hostage
---
Montagne deserves it the most. Monty, then Buck, then hopefully Capitão
---
It took a big hit a year ago. It's been relatively stable since then: 
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/578080#3m
---
(see the bottom graph).
---
Takes a long time to que in newcomer consistently had 10+ minute waits
---
You don't have to keep rejoining, you can set t hunt to house only
---
Not at all unfair, imo. I play on Ultrawide too with my Alienware 34" and game sense, aim, and reaction time are always gonna be more important
---
I still get shat on by diamonds it's just with more screen real estate!
---
No, Infact it's not cheating to play with a disadvantage, Go on pc and use a wii remote, A nintendo 64 controller, A usb tv remote, It's not against the rules to play at a disadvantage, But using a XiM, Which is clearly labeled as a device that tricks a consoles system into believing something else is against the rules, Go on pc and play with an mnk fair or don't play with a xim on console
---
As someone who's tried a xim also, They're very powerful in good hands
---
Shop?
---
You forgot to spam ez in chat despite the fact you won 4-3 and did basically nothing the entire game
---
Now that's just bullying.
---
.
---
*Glances behind you to see piles of energy drinks*
---
It would cover area equal to an impact hole
---
I completely agree. Its just that sometimes when I'm playing with my friends, I can see an enemy and I call it out to them and they never see it. Just wanted to see what the community has to say and wanted to start a conversation

I really wish they'd discuss this. It's been requested since beta, and would be a major quality of life improvement for the game...
---
/u/ubinoty any comment?
---
I was doing newcomer and it took 25 minutes. We gave up.
---
I want: Zofia 
---
I think it will be: Montagne or Buck
---
That’s one hell of a spot, holy shit
---
Why do you go from little kids to toxicity? Not every kid is toxic you know.
---
Yeah if only lmao
---
I would buy IQs Elite and get the "Team Empire" Bandit Skin in the next season.
---
I just bought IQ’s. It has lots of positivity around it.
---
Not as good as Phantom Sight's season
---
Well yeah, I haven't really ever bought packs, I use renown for new ops and seasonal skins, so so this are from packs I got for playing
---
It didnt "look like a loss". The squad of 3 left in second round after dieing in the first round. So it was a 2v5 for 8 total rounds (not including the first round). Score was 4-5.
---
Not every, but most. Little kids want to be better that others, and it's easy to make them angry. Look at free games, where are tons of kids. Minecraft, Fortnite, Dota 2, CS:GO - it's the most toxic games because of kids. I was little kid, and probably all of us was too, so i know how it is
---
So is a business suppose to stop working towards making money after it hits some made up milestone? 
---
A company like Ubisoft has quarterly quotas to meet to keep their shareholders happy. And that will never end.
---
I think I've got over 30 legendaries, but I also bought a lot of packs
---
Now its buggy and laggy with a playerbase.
---
I honestly think they shouldn't add a battlepass, if it costs money it's just gonna be another way for ubisoft to take our money
---
Yeah im gonna buy her. Thx
---
If it was included with the season pass I wouldn't mind it at all but if it's separate that's seems a little excessive. People go gangbusters over items and cosmetics so it just feels like gouging people's wallets for rare or I guess limited time cosmetics.
---
They are meming
---
wow disappointed no jojo poses
---
Dont sweat it, usually in most US servers you get 4 stack squads that are just shitheads.
---
It gets even worse on console, with toxic shitty teens screaming like banshees over the mics
---
Instead of these being operators, I rather like the idea of these being representations of the personality of the average team.
---
Have you downloaded them yet? You have to actually download them after buying them.
---
I’d be fine with the battle pass if the game was cheaper
---
I would recommend watching how other people play the operator, then thinking of your main role as either team. I like to be informed of what enemy is where and who that enemy is, but I also like heavy firepower, or bunkering down.
---
So I main Tachanka, Kapkan, and Valkyrie.
---
Attacking wise, I mainly stick to being a support to my team or trying to clear enemies out of rooms. Also while trying to be in the know.
---
I main Fuze, Glaz, Monty, IQ, and my goal is to get Dokkaebi.
---
You need to know your strengths and weaknesses. If you’re not good with single shot rifles, stay away from people with DMR’s. If you’re better with BIG guns than assault rifles, go for Gridlock, Fuze, or Capitao. If you want stealth, Cav or Nokk, or Vigil.
---
Know your strengths and base it off of that.
---
where the ginyu force tho?
---
Haha yes, I bought her almost 30 minutes ago, and i like her weapons :)
---
Hate em.
---
Please explain?
---
that's not how you spell Hibana
---
Yeah if your game doesn’t move for a good 15-20 seconds, just back out, you’re gone.
---
Highest I’ve gotten is 10k, then insta-removal.
---
Jesus you’re dogshit
---
isnt he that one guy that never gets invited to cast or analyse idk what he does didnt play cs for a long timd
---
nice
---
Mav and Nomad are both good at their own thing. Nomad I see used LESS often as her gadget just isn’t too versatile, unless you KNOW an enemy is there or is near, and you can afford to run for a kill. I’ve died to Nomad more with just her seeing me, than her using her gadget on me. Not once have I been blasted by a nomad mine.
---
Mav, I’ve died to mav’s countless times. He’s stealthy. Take a cam out and go to town on taking out a small portion of a wall, and shoot into the objective. Maverick is dangerous. But Nomad is for the strategic player. Nomad can be a dangerous opponent if you know how to use her.
---
I’d say get Maverick. If you really want Nomad, save up and get her after. But Mav first.
---
Diamond is the top rank he had to get through 4 levels of copper, 4 of silver. 4 of gold and 4 of plat to reach Diamond.
---
He's most likely in the top percentile of Players. So yes flex worthy.
---
SLEDGE
---
Highest rank(until next season).
---
Yeah i think it is a little flexworthy
---
What a load of shit
---
Wow. That’s actually really good. I’m gonna send him a message now saying congrats
---
I think it is rather impressive, but I am nowhere near that skill level. 
---
Siege is a really challenging game for me. Everything happens so fast and it requires extensive knowledge of the maps and gameplay. It is tough to learn from mistakes because instead of just taking a hit then getting back to cover, most gunfights are over quickly, often with a oneshot to the head. 
---
I would be proud of earning Diamond too, but there's a line between proud and flexing for the hell of it.
---
&gt; If winning isnt fun for you then losing is
---
[no, that's a fallacious statement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_a_disjunct)
---
&gt; and in which case your opinion that you hold does not matter.
---
even if i did enjoy losing my opinion matters as much as anyone else's, but i don't. i have fun using interesting abilities and finding new ways to use them, as well as a good story if possible.
---
Is there still no Dubai server?
---
Yes it does. Maybe not directly, but it absolutely shapes the form and function of play.
---
Unisoft is not going to enforce strong punitive action on people that keep funneling money into the game.
---
That's why toxicity is everpresent, smurfs are rampant, and matchmaking in general is a hit or miss roll of the dice.
---
Yare yare

On the one hand we are getting new items and a story, but on the other hand ubi is taking even more money from us. If they made the battle pass free with the season pass it would be better

Seems like they're just overindulging on monetization at this point. You've got elite skins, premium packs, season passes and pro league skins (if you're into that) all for real money only.
---
It's just greedy at this point.
---
I really hope they give nokk a rifle or a better gun to make her more viable, because i love her look but thats it. Its sad that in feel bad picking her on ranked .
---
so we are not allowed to play casual because you don't want that? ok
---
You can buy the game secondhand for around £20

If that one thing makes you not like him you were never a real fan

Keep the credits for some cool skins that may come out in the future.
---
Grind slowly all the OPs one by one. I see the grinding system as a way to ensure that a minimum amount of time to be spent to full understand how the OP works and it's utility based on maps and strats
---
Am I the only one that has played r6 so much they thought it was a video at first and saw the reinforcement animation.
---
The "No U" triangle strikes again
---
It's probably something about putting more focus on actual ops and not letting dumb cheese strats happen in ranked but really we all know it's because he's op.
---
How are you meant to not have all the defaults?

So I buy nøkk?

No

---
Damn man I thought rainbow 6 was a video game, my bad bro.
---
Some people didn't get them. You never know. I got a couple of friends who bought the game a while ago, who didn't get the default ops. They stopped playing , and came back recently. Everyone had the default operators, while they didn't even have Tachanka.
---
And considering how easily she puts it on a wall, the glass doesn’t look that strong.
---
Now it is true that Mira wears some kind of exoskeleton so that could explain why.
---
Smart man.
---
Ok master let’s kill da ho beeeeeeeech!!
---
Finka is a good choice. But hey, you do what you want, if you feel like buying her, go for it, but you'll prolly find her boring really soon.
---
That’s what we like to call a cheater
---
I got Valkyrie
---
Acog is almost always the best bet. However, sights are still personal preference. A lot of professional players use 1x sights only or more often than they need to. Verticl from Rogue and Pengu from G2 are good examples. Also a lot of pro teams have strats built around a single player with an acog holding a specific area. Places like CCTV on border or astronomy room on Villa are common acog spots. So really it's just up to you.
---
If you are on PC, bucks recoil is fairly easy to manage. Just pull down. I also recommend the muzzle brake for his C8. I'm not sure why, but it feels so much better than the other muzzle devices. You can also try changing your aspect ratio or FOV to something different. I personally play on 4:3 90 FOV, but theres benefits to playing all sorts of setups.
---
Where is the ez spam in chat tho?
---
Anyone mentions fortnite dae fort bad wyat do mean
---
So a glitch? Or just some reason it happened? So is nøkk a good idea? Considering my operators
---
Even with a gas mask breathing can be heard just fine, if not louder...
---
That’s nice
---
just now i came off a match where mozzie and mute kept destroying all their shit on my shockers

This doesn’t mean that you can’t have high expectations of the game’s consistency. I like immersion above all.

I got jäger RIP acog
---
r/unecpectedjojo
---
Not a glitch, back then nobody got the default ops for free, you had to pay for them. And Nokk isn't really a good idea, but if you want to buy her that's your choice. Just saying you prolly won't use her for long.
---
it's always the PC players who start shit, all console players are aware that PC is better, you don't need to mention it every time you see a console player
---
Ahh I see. Well let me be the first welcome you to the ubisoft community! Hope you enjoy the rest of the game and its "consistency"!
---
Underneath the mask is just Soap from MW
---
I’m not asking Ubi to make the game a simulator. I’m asking Ubi to be consistent. Blackbeard’s glass is destructible as well as Tachanka’s, but not Mira’s ?
---
imagine making fun of someone for choosing a different platform than you
---
Kaid should only be used for hatches, change my mind
---
He’s not putting himself any better, he just thinks adding things that have grown from  may not mix well with the continuity of rainbow six siege, unlike skins this would be a whole 5 steps forward toward a rainbow 6 that may be represented more for kids, AND I’d like to remind you this game isn’t meant for kids even though many children play it. (Not directed directly at you Thomas if you didn’t downvote) Oh by the way, understand reddiquette before you downvote, because you’re not supposed to downvote things you disagree with but things that don’t have any value or are unnecessary like a bunch of random letters with no context/meaning.
---
Nokk's stealth walk is basically 3 Speed Attacker crouch walking. 
---
Just picking IQ is more efficient overall.
---
If I have no one else I really want to get other than dokkabei maybe, and if people say nokk is really fun, and maverick is ready helpful, would you say it's a good idea to spend 7 british money to get them both?
---
I think this is gonna be a waste of credit. Buying her with reknown is ok. But wasting real money on this shit operator, meh.
---
There is a CASUAL mode for people like that, and it's not a coincidence that they leave after getting spawn killed in round 1. I'm here to enjoy my game, I can't enjoy it when I'm getting outgunned in what should be a 5v5 match, your argument is so flawed to the core of what ranked is, and you're preaching to the wrong choir
---
Nice 3k ostad!
---
they should add a feature where you can buy victory poses. I think that would be a fun new addition to the game.
---
She’s farther back therefore she can see more into the room. Your right up in the window therefore your view is limited
---
A guy who has an arab name in nick, “fuzed” the entire team(Like terrorist). I think that’s the meaning of this.
---
imagine wasting money
---
But apparently she it fun. I would love a stealthy cav in attack
---
Sorry i didn’t understand your comment. I’ve been playing for two years now. 
---
Are you being facetious ?
---
The shotgun is better for destruction. Mira’s primary’s good enough that you don’t really need a secondary
---
Who said Nolk is fun lol? All of the community hates her.
---
total mind fuck
---
Dokkaebi is definitely a better choice.
---
Idk, people say she is fun to use. And it takes forever to get an operator that expensive
---
She’s frozen in carbonite and is off to see Jabba.
---
7:prey tagging mine/proximity tagging mine (P.T.M)
---
This gadget can tag enemies when they come near it.The range of the proximity mine is 60cm(4 school rulers).It can tag an enemy 3 times every 10 seconds.Although it cant tag an enemy through a wall,it still gives the defending team intel of where it is and who it is.
---
Why would he be toxic? He’s just voicing hi opinion on a widely controversial topic. People shouldn’t be downvoted because they disagree but because the comment/post holds no civilized conversational value or is unnecessary such as saying you’re pro-Israeli or pro-Pakistani when no one ever mentioned it. (Just examples, I’m just trying to educate others on reddiquette
---
What's with thaz valk cam wtf
---
I agree with everything you just said mins the newcomer playlist. They might as well call it the "bullied by Smurfs" playlist
---
So you do have at least 1 friend to farm the renown :)
---
Just get it done over 1 minute. You can drop the hostage (aka let the circle start) at around 57/58 seconds in since it takes about 5 seconds for the extraction to complete. 
---
I used to know that at least 50 seconds would do but I think it glitches sometimes so I'd rather wait a few more seconds each round to go over 1 minute than have several games saving those ~10 seconds but I don't get renown.
---
Totally maverick can do the work of tacher and thermite if used correctly if you use him effectively you just use one and a half of fuel to make a croching hole.
---
Nøøk is great to support other fraggers for example a Ash and nøøk can go both together cleaning the map because people will prefire Ash and often two or more will go after her when suddenly a nøøk pops out of nowhere. (I playing queuing with a friend and we love to use this strat)

Hadn’t thought about it like that either

Yes but you’ve also not experienced how much better the game can be with a PC. I use to be a console pleb for years man, still use my PS4 frequently. My friends gave me shit for years. I stubbornly refused to give in for years. I finally bought a PC 2 years ago and it has completely transformed gaming. All I’m saying, I understand it gets old to hear the PC master race bullshit, but truthfully if you tried PC you would never go back. With that said, idgaf what you use, so game on!
---
Took idk this

*update*

It never loaded, I ran out of time :/

50m players and all you care about are the proleague players.   
---
Heh.
---
Ok, that one was good.
---
They were having a convo until you came
---
And is a 100% mute's fault everytime.
---
You mess with then mute mute you get the shoot shoot
---
No Fuze isn’t a very good pick
---
kek
---
I'm glad you're o-kaid with that one
---
I read through most of it.
---
Looks like you put a lot of effort in.
---
I was wondering this too, I've been playing without plus since rainbow is magic until this free weekend event came out.
---
I’m new and didn’t know you could kill the hostage and killed the hostage with fuze to win the game for the other team
---
How is it awful?
---
However also on Oregon, in Laundry you can put one on the right corner closest to the main door and you can get the hatch, the wall on hatch and the wall next to the wall on hatch rendering thermite useless
---
Depends if there are walls that are more important. Used in combination with bandit it can keep a wall from being breached that could easily save the round.
---
I got 4 after just under 700 hours and have had 2 duplicates. Decided not to bother with packs anymore
---
Whether you want this mode or not, you do realise we've gotten a few limited timed events this year already right?
---
Kinda OP, so I think BlackBeard needs another nerf to balance the game
---
thanks!
---
You got any more of those pixels
---
It’s not a buff genius it’s already in the game
---
No, because consoles are not the environment for test servers. Having to get patches approved from the console manufactures would making testing ungodly long for no real benefit
---
Echo is better with ela you have to be close or pre out where they are going to plant for it to be effective but echo can do it while he’s halfway across the map
---
Dude, you literally attacked me about:”Anti-DDoS server” and know you just changing argument without saying nothing about  that I was right about the existence of the anti-ddos servers?
---
Can’t you just say sorry? I’m not here to hate ubi or anyone of you, I love this game and since I love it I fucking care about it! So stop being a wanna be hacker only to defend them. 
---
P.S if they an anti-DDoS is not enough there is other methods to let player don’t lose their Elo.
---
I just want to know, did you get the ace?
---
This is oooold. I still recognise the old hud.
---
Nah, most of the time it’s a blitz, Blackbeard, Montagne, lion, and dokkaebi
---
The Battle Pass coming with Ember Rise is free for everyone, So I am indifferent about it. It is in Season 4 that there is separate free and Paid Tier passes, that is the one I have some concerns about.
---
it's not possible
---
Every time I try and hold dining hall entrance from big tower the damage drop off is so severe is impossible to kill
---
Sometimes to save a life you need to take one.
---
It’s called the chalionm skin and you can’t get it in pretty much most weapons not sure up to which season or if it a avaible for everyone always but it’s available for her
---
Why would a new mode be bad
---
Did the binding get cleared?
---
No, I checked
---
It's usually static light sources such as shown [here](https://images.nvidia.com/geforce-com/international/comparisons/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege-lens-effects-interactive-comparison-001-bloom-and-lens-flare-vs-off.html). 
---
I was just surprised to find that it affects Valkyrie's cameras.
---
I am experiencing the same problem here in the US (midwest region)
---
But it's still just peeking. 
---
Spawnpeek is when you don't even have the time to click W before you're already dead. 
---
If you have time to retaliate or move, it's just peeking
---
Ah I see you are a man of this nature aswell

You love to see it

---
She looks like "excuse me wtf" meme XD
---
I don’t see how so many people don’t know about meleeing shields. It pushes the shield to the side and you can shoot them.
---
Your puns don’t work on me. They won’t release a recruit elite. Because no more recruit in ranked
---
I mean, it’s $15 per elite skin so it’s not much cheaper than cocknite
---
you’re a bonafide jackass. so rude for literally nothing at all
---
I usually turn off bloom as I dislike the overblown effect, but I have to admit it is interesting that it makes such a large difference here. I would not recommend turning on lens flare though as that's just distracting.
---
I counted like 8 hits...
---
Fan art where they actually credit the Original artist? Impossible!

Hello AshMillrr, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d0x80o/a_siege_video_that_will_echo_through_time/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
To fuck with their mind
---
You can make free smurfs on console anyways and hacking is only really an issue on pc
---
Rip to all mute mains
---
This happens to me almost everytime someone's getting boosted and we're on attack, have defuser down or have to stop the defuser once it's on.
---
At first I thought the servers were buggy, but after the 4th time I realized that they were ddossing. Also, there's been this wave of plats and diamonds getting boosted on silver/gold lobbies.
---
Ubi should fix the matchmaking.
---
Exactly
---
My friend mentioned it to me and I wanted to check. These are screenshots taken a few minutes ago on the live PC build. Same is true for the elite skin.
---
I wish i can know how people make this or how or even what they use to do such things.. i wish.......

Little kids already play the game, and not everyone who is coming from fortnite is a little kid, get your head out of your ass, this is my last reply to this thread, have a good day/night.
---
You’re red doodoo
---
No weapon has recoil on pc, think of balance for all installemnts, firstly. Secondly, glaz does not have an acog sight, and did you just ask if his primary use should be available to another operator ? Thats what makes him unique. Also, why reduce the movement allowed* if they're buffing it because of it's lackluster effectivity ? You're just not thinking objectively. Again, not all 1 speeds deserve an acog.
---
Look I’m not gonna say anything but I played as rook on my first go around and hid in a bush,opposite to where he is, and almost got an ace. You’d be surprised how many people don’t check the bushes for lead monsters
---

The rex is lurking
---
Defenders drop their phones when they die if the attackers have Dokkaebi.
---
Dokkaebi can see the phone icon through walls and hack it to access defender cameras.
---
Her call throws you out of your phone, so it doesn't affect Echo.
---
Same cheats that have been around for a while. Seems that Ubi is incapable of dealing with them.
---
The standouts for me are the leaning, wall and floor destruction and the pace of the rounds/game.
---
Recruit M870 rushes. They're one of the most exhilarating things you can do and if it works, your entire team is now god-tier
---
Honestly that kind of stuff really helps sports in general. Storylines and rivalries and drama makes it more enjoyable to watch.
---
This is too real...
---
Vocal percussion on a whole notha level, coming through my mind
---
Good

---
Ela in her current state is one of the worst operators in game as she has been nerfed 8 times and given 0 buffs if you don't count the sorta buff they gave her a while back.
---
Her scorpion is the only primary without a recoil diamond and does pathetic damage. The 3rd lowest in game.
---
Her pistol does the lowest damage of all handguns and has a 12 meter fall off range which is very poor. It's a niche as the sight does help but you can't use it to its fullest potential.
---
Her secondary gadgets are useless as she's a roamer but given two stationary gadgets. It's self explanatory.
---
Her mines are also quite lackluster just like every trap already in game.
---
Ela is in no way good and shouldn't ever be your first pick if you're just getting her. She's fun to play but in no sense viable.
---
Nah, when he dies, a random war-related quote pops up across every enemy's screen and obscures vision

Press on the image, it will take you to the imgur site, from there you can zoom in.

I'll agree to that. Its just getting tiresome even for him tbh.
---
Respectfully, I gotta say I actually never see any criticism against this game posted here, which is why I was so curious to see what the reddit playerbase would say, and what criticism of their own they could have.
---
don't know

Still blurry lol

Sure thing. My ubi account is just the same as anything else I use. Magic_Milkman.

What’s so bad about that loadout though? I’m not seeing an issue?

Somehow a radio jammer stops an ultrasonic pulse.

Also for some reason an ultrasonic pulse only detects things that move.
---
Claymore Roomba is a very dependable comrade
---
I’m sorry but I have to report you, recruit rushing is basically hacking it’s a guaranteed win, next you’ll be telling me you do Tachanka Spawnpeeks or Castle yourself outside and runout
---
To me, it sounds like they want to add an operator to counter bandit tricking, or make bandit tricking risky. And they want to add an operator that isn't burned out by wasting utility like flash bangs, so they can throw a nade. It will be meta changing, but not over powered in the slightest.
---
What did yer do ter me router
---
Yea I felt really bad for him lol
---
I've gotten into PL more of late so I probably haven't been tired out on it yet. We just need more players who talk shit or have a type of personality.
---
The person who makes the comics posts them here as well 
---
So anyone stealing the post of instergram is reposting the post that was posted on reddit as well
---
You called the game fun with a new cosmetic event while filled and plagued with cheaters. That is not a fun game for me. I'm all for new cosmetics and special stuff AFTER the biggest glaring issues have been fixed. So either you are cheating, playing with cheaters or stupid yourself for failing to realize that having cheaters around in a game is not fun.
---
As for the second part, it shouldn't take too much intelligence to realize that I most definitely understand that the developing team and the graphics team are separate. What you and other people of your kin fail to realize is that the graphics team doesn't work for free either. For the money spent on a big graphics team working on new gamebreaking visuals, they could hire more gameplay developers or upgrade their anti-cheats. They refuse to do so, therefore they consciously make their game not fun.

If somebody kills you and it is not accident, I usually just leave the match unless if it is ranked

Either this guy is in the dark or everyone else is getting wooshed.

“Makarov... knows.... yuri...”

Buddy your comments, you were bitching on about how operation health fixed everything
---
when you cant win because your bad ddos the server and ruin it for everyone else
---
Mouse acceleration?
---
that was beautiful
---
like i care about the new players lmaoo.
---
Omg lol that’s awful
---
I mean, yeah the visuals of ops have changed drastically since the originals. But that's not a bad thing, being able to tell what ops you're playing against even if you just get a quick glimpse at them is far superior than saying "They could have smoke or mute". Those two ops can change the game in 2 very different ways.
---
"cams and drones basically WH" lmfao what? If you let them get info form that, I mean you deserve to die.
---
Spawnpeeks &amp; runouts punish you for doing poor dronework, especially spawnpeeks. Having 5 people sit their drones on site in prep phase is fucking useless.
---
These complaints seem to be more player-issue than game. The game has a load of issues, but nothing mentioned in here is actually one of them.
---
Free weekend experience

Sometimes my jammer will just be a bit too close when I place it. Always apologize guys.

Waste of an operator then, could just play vigi
---
What if Tachanka could attach his turret to Shields?
---
e🅱️ic.
---
It was working fine yesterday the mouse acceleration is already turned off
---
I have had a problem that looks a lot like this. It was fixed by changing from borderless to fullscreen

Yeah but a system like that would ruin rare gun skins, ive had to grind a years worth of renown and boosters to get top black ice skins like the F2, Commando, R4C, MP5, G3, SAS shotgun and a lot more, but the rarity of those would seemingly be ruined due to the increase of unboxing black iced. Its like CSGO, if they doubled the chance increase of unboxing Contraband skins and Knives then the market for them would go down, and a $1000 knife might be worth only $700.
---
r/lefttheburneron
---
Shit dude! I never knew. Thanks.
---
It’s genuinely weird, it’s not like we’re attacking the game just merely pointing out blatant flaws with the system, I said we need more Alpha Packs and no more duplicates or just useless garbage that is clearly there to artificially make it harder to get what you actually want, shit like that is there to keep you playing and get you addicted to the packs via RNG systems and for whatever reasons these morons defend it saying stuff like Ubi are being nice giving us alpha packs, they’re a billion dollar company, they only care about money, at least the ones who actually make the decisions
---
here you go my man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-Wv2Y4QvPE
---
i have tachanka full uniform and his rainbow gun and a black ice skin i feel like its the best meme elite
---
The mute in this comic is me as mozzie when i lose a drone to an ally.... cept there is more shotgun involved.
---
The problem is the luck based system though. Look at how instead of just getting a pack after leveling up or some shit, you have to spin a wheel based off a percentage, and it takes about 40 games to make that wheel a 50-50 chance. And once you get a pack, hoo boy is that fun, you open it an it's just a piece of shit based off luck. It's just not a good system. I don't understand why there are so many morons on this subreddit that don't want to make something good better. I mean, why wouldn't you want more alpha packs? Why are you so against the idea of getting more alpha packs? It's bizarre that no one wants improvements.

idk then

:(
---
No that would be so OP everyone would have elite skins and diamond but you should still get it in the main game
---
I feel like it would be like warden, it sounds useful but when put in gameplay there's never the opportunity to use it effectively
---
This but instead of making a new operator to use this gadget just give that to Castle.
---
Like, you can castle barricade doors and windows so, why not walls? Like a "second reinforcement" to a wall.

Hello nohilary, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d0zbzm/stop_banning_clash_you_fucking_morons/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I had written something like this in my notes but I couldn't think of a way it'd make sense. honestly really like the idea because then it could deny rotations as well.
---
Oh
---
I don't think that has much to do with what I said.
---
Yeah though, that is a scummy move to pull.
---
Also completely possible he *thought* he fixed it, realized it wasn't an actual fix, but was too prideful to back down.
---
DONT EVEN GET STARTED ON MOZZIE
---
‘You’ have no reason. I would though because she’d have the most breaching capability out of the two, Smokes and decent weaponry. 
---
Zofia would have a good level of breaching, solid weapons and a good bit of utility with her grzmot mines. 
---
They’d be equally as viable I’d say
---
More alpha packs+getting rid of low tier items+removing duplicates=finally getting that one epic or legendary much less exciting or special. 
---
I'm not saying the system is perfect or that it cant be improved on. I think alpha packs should be rewards for level milestones. Maybe every 5 levels from 1-100 and then every other from then on since the leveling is slower. But if you made alpha packs even easier than they are to get now plus making the loot tier average higher, it makes them less fun and much less valuable.
---
Play cs go
---
I think it would act as a deterrent because it would make it so team killing would actively give away your position in most cases. And while there would be slightly more bans from innocent mistakes, personally I think that is a good trade off for stoping beginning of the round team killing.
---
couldve been talking about how my akill relates to others in my  region
---
Wait really? I had no idea about that... 😲
---
I’m just surprised he would actually make people aware of something that can give quite an advantage, given what I highlighted it seems as though he likes to be the only one that benefits from things that can give an advantage in-game.
---
Ok thanks
---
this proves nothing
---
Why would that matter? There isn't a single market for siege weapons, and the only thing the decreased rarity would be more people getting cool skins, which is like, why? Why should others not have to opportunity to get the top black ice skins? I'm sorry you had to waste so much time grinding, but that kinda proves a point that the system is broken. Grinding for an entire year, it's kinda dumb.

Join me comrade, become a fuze main and end the capitalist regime blyat

I would thoroughly enjoy punching him in that whiney bitch face of his.
---
Thanks
---
Surprised?
---
Nokk for sure her stealth will help you get to the objective and kill roamers easily and quickly ying is a good substitute but with the her candelas reworked she won’t be as effective as she used to be
---
YIS COMRADE
---
Thank you! It's ridiculous that alpha packs are so rare, with most cosmetics being awful (even the legendaries).
---
Isn't the drop rate for a legendary less than 1%? Then why is it possible to get a duplicate?
---
This system is only in place because YouTube whales like to post "152 Alpha pack openings" and they get a ton of hits.
---
Oh my God! They killed IQ!
---
You bastards!
---
YIS
---
Much less valuable to who? There isn't a weapons skin store like CS:GO for siege.

This is really really good

No imma gold 4 but I just practiced a lot with the f2

Just give em a big smooch and theyre blinded

It blows my mind that ubisoft haven't implemented a lot of QOL changes, overwatch has so many features that I wish siege would introduce, like being able to immediately leave a game with your group once your done, an enforcement system or something that let's you keep up with pro league
---
I wish there was an operator like this who could patch up holes in reinforced walls after a hibana or a thermite breach
---
It can’t be real. Free week in a nutshell I guess.
---
The free weekend did but it days it ends on September 9th(the sale) but I wanted to know if it ends on 9th or it is on sale till the 9th
---
Literally every gunfight  you have in this game.
---
Whoa whoa wait.
---
If Aoe healing didn't work on cap, how would it work on Russian lady?

I believe it's his video on nomad

Yeah I was just checking to let you know. Deluxe edition went from $39.99 to 11.99
---
Leech
---
Not reposted again, just reposted. He did create it though. I don't know why we are getting downvoted.

I think siege is the better game in terms of mechanics but overwatch has so many small features that make the overalls experience much more fun

Rocking the black ice as well. My man

inb4 people mass dislike cuz they think im stupid lmao

This man is obviously a conasuer of crip walks.

BROOOOOOOO

Exactly why I NEED TO BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!

My xbox broke so i got a ps4(because why not) and i forgot to buy the game till now

Fuck yes
---
Thanks guy. Dont shoot the messenger.
---
This sub is stupid you got downvoted for asking a question lmao.
---
It was not meant to be taken literally. Obviously sometimes it won’t work but often it is taken out
---
I still have nightmares of those stupid pests.
---
They kind of just have implement more quality of life changes they need a whole season just for that
---
My bad on my sentence structure. Flight hangover.
---
Why am I getting downvoted the original post is right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9o4glw/i_animated_a_siege_south_park_intro/
---
But the amount of bans with the early tk going up would be the next big complaint. Anyone angry would just try to get shot to get rid of them. Showing your position is a much better punishment in my opinion than that
---
Why did you post it again? https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9o4glw/i_animated_a_siege_south_park_intro/
---
Not sure how much he is but lesion is amazing, great on any map, and site, great gadget but you have to stay alive to use it properly and get the most effect out of it as possible, his SMG is great aswell, nice fire rate, hardly any recoil, has impacts for opening rotations
---
????
---
Not to mention I got fortress in my second game
---
Um no ones gonna talk about how this sentence is
---
Wow 90 giving me the benefit of the doubt there man!
---
I looked and it ends on the 9th meaning that, that’s when OP Ember Rise starts
---
I think they are referencing a quote at the beginning of the bee movie. It is supposed to be "...according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly..." which is in reference to entomologist August Magnan noting that bee flight should be impossible. However, the quote is misleading. Aviation has to do with the flying and operating of *aircraft*--to be more precise, human machine-assisted flight. Obviously bees fly by entirely different means.
---
TL;DR: Humans are stupid and I agree with you.
---
Epic. Well done
---
Ubisoft probably won't be buffing any shield ops soon because a lot of people find them extremely annoying, even though blitz isn't that strong, when he does flash you it's incredible annoying
---
Yes i thought it would't make sense, but next time you play r6 try looking closely to another drone in prep phase
---
lmao I played frost so much and got maybe 1 kill with the mats if im lucky then... this
---
Newcomer is like that you basically need to play ranked to have a good experience unless you like just running out and seeing how many kills you can get each time.
---
Lost out, beat up
---
Dancin', down there
---
I found you, somewhere out
---
'Round 'round there, right right there
---
Lost and beat up
---
Down there, dancin'
---
Right down there, right 'round there
---
They wouldn't give you 150 shots if you didnt need everyone right..... right???
---
I love frost for this reason. 
---
When my friend first started playing, he picked up frost cause he like her design and concept, and we were playing on consolute and this kinda thing happened to me. It was a 1v4 and I took down two right after the other two got frost matted from the same door way lol (two different mats)
---
haha no steal pls
---
It can cause amnesia if your brain isn't fully developed.
---
I dont think there's a digital edition on ps4 store anymore, though i have seen the standard edition in some second hand places for like £3-4
---
She's keeping her fmg9
---
that would be so memeworthy without that string of numbers in the way
---
that's the thing, it's not really that often if mute plays well... but yes if mute throws all his Jammers somewhere random on a hallway just to get rid of drones he plays badly... Mozzie can get the drones while mute uses the jammer defensively for everything else, like a breach charge, exothermic etc.
---
how can I never hit a drone like it has some kind of invisible shield around it?
---
This fucking edit LMAO
---
She can actively move with the heal, over the duration instead of cap having to have it in one spot for the duration. This makes it more feasible to have it as an actual healer, as it’s easier for players to get value and heals from it without it feeling odd. If you stay close, she grants nice heals. 
---
Risk v reward

K thx

Hello GoatThirteen, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d10fk8/recently_started_my_youtube_channel_woyld_love/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Give Nokk the glokk
---
Get an exorcist
---
That’s so sexy MMMMMM
---
That's good. it means siege isn't hogging cpu memory. There's an ongoing bug called 100% CPU bug. You shouldn't worry if you use less.
---
It is a problem if siege isn't using 100% of your gpu. Gpu must always be 100% used.
---
This is amazing
---
Crip walking.
---
Light bloom tends to be done as a post-processing effect, so it'll affect any bright enough areas on the screen.
---
I wouldn’t say difficult recoil, I’d say *challenging* recoil because once you master it, it’s pretty easy. But if you’re newer, it can be a hassle to control
---
Edit my guy 😎👉👉
---
Don't worry, i ain't a filthy reposter
---
Why did you both die there though? I thought RFF activates *after* your first TK.
---
Would be nice. Especially for controllers with paddles
---
Where's Bandit? D:
---
Wait what? I don’t understand what happened
---
no, as it shows on that screenshot, you only got +3. this means that you’d only get 30 elo if you won 10 games. its gonna take a while.
---
Looks normal for console
---
I think he just doesn’t know how to reply to peoples comments, lmao
---
I know what the dance thing is but what does that have to do with siege?
---
How is finka trash? She has the most busted shotgun in the game, grenades, and can give herself and the team more health. I understand lion is trash without a good team. And fuse is nowhere near trash. The only counter to fuse is Jager but even then he's getting buffed, the deployment of the charges it's going from. 2 seconds to 1.6 seconds
---
Nice cosplay! It seems cav is afraid of the the new spook gal! Good job on the stripes
---
Looks really cool.
---
I'm guessing you rejoined the game mid round after the breach had been made. It's happened to me before when I've disconnected
---
If you purchased it, you get it not him. It’s not you buy it any everyone gets it, unless you guys play on the same account
---
"I don't care, play nice"
---
lol nice
---
"But maaaaa"
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Don’t play newcomer it’s all smurfs if you wanna learn how to play the game do customs and learn maps with friends
---
You have to smurf to get them.
---
&gt; leaving casual matches instantly after death lol
---
Asshat spotted.
---
We need a parks and rec but remade with rainbow six siege starring IQ
---
I had this problem and while in game changed all the audio settings, hit apply, then changed them back to where they were first, hit apply, and that worked.
---
Were gameshared so normally it does work that way
---
The ranked limit only applies to people in your party, it's still possible that there will be people outside of the ranked limit on your team or the enemy's, as long as you aren't queueing with them
---
I’ve only seen this problem when spectating games I join mid round and it’s only for that round. Not that annoying imo.
---
Yes the game has a big learning curve. Playing and practicing are the easiest ways to figure things out. Watch the killcams, see what your team is doing. Find someone to play with that’ll teach you how things work. Watch a YouTube video. If you want to learn the game, you gotta be willing to
---
This video makes my butt clench.
---
Agreed
---
Wouldn't it be amazing if they made a real episode out of this?
---
Well then he’d have to go to the season pass in the store and install it, if not then it’s probably not going to work sadly
---
Just saying, why would he be asking if the mnk he owns are compatible if he wasn’t planning on using them lol.
---
Just my opinion, I don’t think every kill needed a zoom in and (annoying imo) sound effect. Otherwise not bad man
---
Console casual am i right😂😅
---
Damage dropoff is a tough thing
---
I feel Warden could be in his own tier, would refuse but can secretly out Crip everyone on this list
---
I don’t get it I don’t see anything
---
Cant or can? If cant i get the same bug. I cant hear teammates or talk. Its rediculous
---
Did you do the situations and many round of THunt?
---
There was no issue for some reason task manager showed that they ran at 40%. I used MSI after burner and saw the gpu was good and running at 98%. So I guess it's an issue with task manager.
---
Better, but still garbage...
---
Oh sorry, I meant can't
---
I assume it always jumped something like Boston Dynamic's sandflea, only in motion. Probably just a little solenoid arm that takes a second to charge up.

I have like 20 hours in the game now and have a decent understanding of all the ops and the 3 newcomer maps. It's not that hard, just learn to adapt. Keep getting spawnpeeked? Learn to counter and spawnpeek yourself when defending.
---
1v5 nice!
---
alibi gun be like: rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
I think the V308 is based off the Kriss vector, SMG12 Seems to be the TMP SMG and R4C is likely just a compact M4 renamed for legal reasons and the SPEAR is based off the FN2000

What about giving optional actions like double pressing to drop.

It's been over a year since I made one of these, I almost forgot how much fun they are.

might be a bee movie quote
---
When all the dogs that hate each other are barking at each other but trapped behind a fence
---
&gt; Alpha packs are way too difficult to obtain, so getting commons and duplicates really don't seem fair at all.
---
I don't think so. I usually get 2/3 packs once a day
---
Equaliser though personally I don’t know how to change it in windows or game
---
How come you left out your own rank? Silver?
---
Well it's at least 50/50, but it's still not that great of odds

I've been playing since year one with the season pass

If you play with mouse and keyboard on console you are a f... P...y 😁

I've tried it in custom with the bros it's pretty boring it's just tdm but everyone just basically uses the most op loadout
---
When someone leaves before that screen their name doesnt show up
---
I edited it with Resolve 16, why would I upload if I'm hacking
---
And that still doesn't make it irrelevant as there are already advantages to playing in console that aren't in pc. Like controlling the speed of movement with accuracy.
---
Wasn't clash not out last year tho?
---
Whats wrong with the temp fix i mentioned? And I didn't say ubi ignores console, but they easily cater to pc more. Majority of console players think this too, for a good reason.

Amazing! This is the most insane clutch i've seen in a while. 0 seconds left, 1hp left, against clash aswell. Well played!

"Someday i'll be old enough to stick my dick in britney's butt"
---
Hopefully unranked will help this out
---
because it’s easy to abuse maybe? people who DDOS now will do it anytime they’re about to lose. it doesn’t solve anything and even encourages it more
---
Yeah it happens to me as well
---
Because it's monkey
---
Happened to me as well a few days ago and I can’t fix it
---
I would delete the game if this happened to me
---
ESL officially announced that mouse and keyboard on console is cheating. Not like that stops anybody...
---
It's ok man there just bad recruit takes the most skill
---
&gt;anyone else has ever thought a hardcore/super realistic mode would be a useful game mode
---
Oh believe me, quite a few want it. And it gets asked here on this sub every month (search up, you'll find some good discussions), mainly because "apparently ubi promised a tactical realism mode" years ago but hasn't delivered.
---
So considering that Ubi wants to focus on side events that are still similar to the existing modes, I highly doubt realism would be coming anytime soon
---
Great, although the amount of gas aint...right...I think the light would be more dimmed by the gas, making more of a yellow lightning... Idk if ur a pro photoshopper but just to suggest that
---
I don't think in real life a soldier would survive a shot to the head just because it came from his team mate, that would ruin the tactical realism
---
“Oh hey finka! There’s a wild vigil over ther-“ *dead*

So who do you think will play this game in the next season if this fucking ddosing continues? Oh yes, you're right, all the ddoser noob kiddies :) I play this game since the closed beta, was dia every single season. And I am not the only one who will stop playing this game if they don't find a solution for the next season. But yeah at copper silver and low gold levels you can "lmao". Above p2 this game is unplayable for those who play legit. But yeah you can't understand what I wanna say, have fun with your ddos, I hope they will find a way and ban all of you destroying this game.
---
If you get the full use of the booster then absolutely yes. Otherwise, maybe go for cosmetics in the shop if that’s your thing.
---
https://guidescroll.com/2019/01/rainbow-six-siege-increase-footstep-volume-reduce-gun-volume-guide/ I found this on Google. I haven't tried it yet but it's worth a shot
---
I'm not an idiot to not see how shitty my main is. Her character is great but holy Hell in game she's a pathetic excuse of being viable.
---

Wait a second! Why would it drop when you are trying to plant? If you are going to plant in a bomb site, it plants, and if you are going to drop, it drops. Simple.
---
No, go to PC If  your gonna cheat
---
It's better than what we have now? Which is nothing. People are ddosing their way up ranks we literally have to surrender every game and get demoted and lose elo for no reason. This temp fix wont favour anyone, people are able to ddos games anyway when they start losing, after ddosing they obviously immediately win, this fix will ensure no one is able to take advantage of ddos. This no way encourages it more, rather discourages it since they can't cheat their way up.
---
Huh, it goes like 'Ffffffffff'
---
Then it is all the more confusing that you'd think removal of FF would be useful to the game.
---
But what did it cost?
---
Where do you live? And maybe your account is the problem? Maybe ddosed or whatever I see a lot of those posts on reddit a lot more
---
When and how, if you don’t mind telling me.
---
*NO RUNNING IN THE BUS* when she shocks one of the kids for running to the seats
---
After reviewing your post, I've decided that I cannot, on ethical grounds, not upvote.
---
Just knife him 😋
---
iirc casual also has hidden ranks
---
Wow that’s messed up. Do you think reporting the people will do anything? I was recording that game so I know everyone that was in it.
---
Everything
---
Genious
---
Hay why don’t you have the caveria main tag next to your name it would be better for you beacuse you care if people leave to avoid getting killed
---
Huh....
---
Wait,how did you die for injuring a friendly lmao.
---
Yet the coppers I am up against play like platinum players
---
Well, yes, but no. Analog keyboards.

---
If I remember correctly why are you getting beans at 3am my dude it’s much better to get them st 2 instead
---
Reporting does nothing. I’ve literally heard reporting on console doing nothing. I mean you could send the footage to Ubi and they might do something but I doubt it.
---
Yeah same I’m just amazed how they have to do some illegal shit to win and still find the game fun
---
Damn retard, go back to 9gag, maybe the humor wont fly over your head there.
---
Why do you people have no lives.
---
My friend just got siege and this is happening to her. It's fucking pathetic. It's going to make new players leave so quickly.
---
Lesion.

Lesion should have update to his voiced lines,

everytime,   
---
I mean, every. time.

He should only say "spreading the salt" while throwing those f*** mines
---
I am impressed you can even run r6 on a 2011 mac. I also have a mid 2011 mac and i lag when playing minecraft
---
That’s not proleague settings
---
next season, i think it's gonna have to be pressed by all 5 people, AND you have to be losing like the first 2 rounds or something like that
---
Overclocked to hell, dual booting windows

Been dealing with this all day today.  So aggravating!

Change your hat type to 2

An old ps4 could be traded for an old pc
---
Yeah, toxicity will forever plague gaming unfortunately. All you can do is just shrug it off and queue up for the next.

After seeming some comments I decided to set plot biome to swamp but I could get rain to work so instead I did a night shot.
---
That’s sad. Stay safe out there.
---
Make an imgur album and post in comments
---
Considering how she will still be that 2 Speed with no utility and still won’t replace IQ, I’d say she won’t really be broken. 
---
The idea of sneaky Nokk carrying it sounds funny though.
---
They did this on every round... IN RANKED PLAY, children are ruining this game...
---
What's that dance called anyway?
---
If it dont wanna work kick its freeloading ass out.
---
Tell that mafucker to get a job.
---
All quiet and nothing on cam.
---
You run out to corridor only to see Nokk fully set up with LMG.
---
Personally for me, because I hate being stuck as Wood IX
---
I have no idea. Guess they were friendly
---
I live in poland, and i doubt that i got ddosed. Everything else works. Also i cant acces ubi support page (it constantly breaks in some way.) But it doesnt work on other wifi\`s and stuff like that. I cant check other internet on my PC.
---
It’s a video game brother just have fun...
---
I’ll try. It’s just pathetic knowing how far people are gonna go just to preserve some shitty status symbol made up of a few pixels that means nothing.
---
If they said it, there would have been many discussion and praise on here. Nothing is here and Ubi haven’t said a thing about it.
---
But it would be very nice to have those changes.
---
I feel like there was one in chimera where an operator would be able to become invisible halfway through a rounds I want to say it was Hibana or IQ but I know for a fact it was different than the IQ glitch we had in Burnt Horizon.
---
wait, that’s illegal
---
Hello Esgee88, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d13afo/abandon_sanction_due_to_server_crash_possible/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It's ranked play, some people want to be serious about it and actually get to rank UP not Down because of trolls
---
But then you couldn't kick people who hog the defuser intentionally, troll or destroy friendly gadgets or something like that.
---
yeah its insane
---
Good idea ill do that for sure
---
Console has advantages that pc doesn’t??
---
Ikr but it's hard to shrug it off after 17 times straight
---
E
---
Why do people even use it?
---
I just restarted when i got this problem
---
I get that bro, I deal with that too. But like... you made a post about this. Like as if it really bothered you. I don’t know you, but this makes me think that you REALLY take a video game seriously. It may be annoying, but they’re just having fun. How many YouTubers have you seen do the same thing? Just have fun with them. If you can’t beat them, join them, I guess.
---
alibi is pretty fun lesion is extremely good and vigil is a decent roamer
---
thanks
---
Agreed. It’s just a stupid game.
---
I said i can\`t acces the router. Due to trashy ISP
---
Yeah literally the thing that will stomp them is the government taking a shit on them consoles they’ll use a be w up and account Ubisoft can ban them new account government fucking them then they stop so that sucks
---
I believe there's an option in the settings that allows you to customise your Terrorist Hunt Mode
---
god dammit I fuckin’ hate battlepasses
---
Ubi machine broke
---
How old are you?
---
They’re just horrible at the game
---
Either the 10th or 17th, The new event for the xbox and playstation editions state the 17th
---
Well none of them had mics for starters, and I don't take video games that seriously I go to university I have a job, when I get home I just want to play and enjoy it but can't when kids act this way so yes it does bother me
---
Toss a grenade on a soft floor and sledge the floor. The grenade should fall down the hole unless it’s blocked by a steal beam.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
so leave. Tf? If it’s not that important to you, what’s a little abandonment penalty? I might be the minority here but this shit doesn’t bother me
---
Glock 18 akimbo bling with extended mags
---
Good job! They probably just jealous they shit at the game and ur good
---
People don’t like the obj to be secured in casual. Seen as a bad thing with who I play with
---
Nice nice,very nice,Caesar-chan!
---
Report him maybe?
---
I dont see what the community can do
---
Go to settings and change your preferred game mode to defend hostage in T hunt.
---
Are...are you God?
---
Yeah and that's console plat 3
---
They are definitely in a discord call laughing at your reaction
---
I have how getting to plat is generally an achievement, but people who just get lucky in placements get it for free, like back in grim sky I didn't deserve it, but got super easy placements
---
Ps gets it on the 17th
---
Hey you double posted
---
Imagine being outside
---
Yeah anchoring WORKS but I prefer to say "F you" to his shitty deployment times and run around the map as him, deploying the turret on defuser if practical
---
But the stakes are lower.

It’s okay, don’t feel bad. A lot of people get jealous when you ace or clutch because they’re embarrassed of their own gameplay and possibly suspect you’re a smurf. 
---
I’ve only gotten a handful of aces but I was nearly vote kicked every time

I know, I wasn’t trying to flex, I was more making fun of there overreaction
