Well silver isn‚Äôt good. I‚Äôm not shitting on you, but ranked gets a lot better when you‚Äôre in high gold to plat. Just give it some time.

Yeap , item was carefully packaged and i dont have any problems with it also comes with a remote to change the lighting and colours also comes with a usb cable if u want a different option than using batteries

You can change the colours theres a remote to change it can even cycle through automatically its cool :)

Video doesn't show if OP sat there for 1-2 minutes waiting to load.  Based on how fast the vote happened, I would bet everyone else was kicking him just to get the game to start.  They were ready to kick him before seeing anything about him.
---
Just stand on a mute jammer if this is a blitz issue
---
Okay if you really think they're not going to change the controllers you are a fool that is a good marketing strategy to sell the next gen

Unpopular for a reason

If you put enough effort into something, greatness will rise

Having hit Plat 2 and then been immediately smacked back down to Gold 1, I can say that this is accurate
---
I mean, I play like this but not in ranked just casual. I'm level 235 but I don't play ranked. I'm always helping my teammates but i don't think that trolling an enemy is bad (in casual). What do you think?
---
You know, funny how a lot of the sexist, toxic people that harass women and kick people for no reason all sound like that...

Funny...

WOW thanks everyone this is the most upvoted I've been given ever

This option wont help.... Those faggots play mnk on console to have an advantage and an easier game....

If they would cue against other mnk players they wont have that advantage 
---
No just anchor and play someone like pulse and just don‚Äôt use it

I second this

whatever gets publicity and woke points i guess

Thanks man I appreciate it

Inb4 thousands of losers downvote and report you for posting a minor facial glitch you found funny
---
[removed]
---
You sound like someone who tries to anchor with Caviera and when your team gets upset at you for it, you hide behind the "it's my playstyle" excuse. 
---
Are you new to the game?
---
Or hear me out, people play the class the way it was designed to be played because then everyone has much more fun. People should learn that this game isn't COD. Characters have a laid out set of mechanics and while yes you can play them flexibly they were actually meant to be played one way and that one way will provide the most utility to the team. This is a team oriented game so people should play ops conducive to the team. Ie if someone tries roaming with Mira they're wrong and should stay on OBJ. There's a few ops where playstyle comes into play. Ash, and Blackbeard to name a few. Those ops are very bare bones and thus can be played differently but Jackal for instance is a very specific kind of character.

He has to be played a certain way to be useful. Otherwise he's just a less good blackbeard.

Mouth full of watermelon seeds strat. Gets em everytime. 
---
Rook doesn't even sound French 
---
Alibi is fun
---
The only reason you shouldn‚Äôt use her (if You like her) is if you don‚Äôt have good map knowledge.  Where she is a roamer, you have to know how to get to and intercept enemies.  
---
Your aim will improve no matter who you play as.

Tachanka gets a canister right into the main part
---
Play her a little when the new patch comes out and see how different she feels. You should also learn the maps better before you really try maining Cav. Map knowledge is required to be good at Cav or any roamer really.

Try going into sound settings and check if your mic might have changed to a webcam mic if you have a webcam there to say. (In windows)

It's been there for over a decade, they just don't want to put in the resources. Not saying it's laziness or anything.

Nice Ig. Depends on the map really. For example it's a god on plane. And pretty good on tower actually even though I hate the map.

I got 2 in my past 5 alphas after so many levels... For the fucking M1014 and 417. I actually can't think of any worse guns, they're probably the 2 worst guns to get it on. Even the G36 is better than either of those. I mean at least I got some but man that's a lousy way to use all your luck.

Sorry for the bad cam my recording software was being whack. I don‚Äôt recall any indicators during it and ran straight to that window from spawn. I‚Äôll make sure any future uploads are much better quality :)
---
Funny how people don't realize that ops move while standing.
---
It's a game
---
Why? It's pretty hard to get fooled by Alibi pretending to be holograms anyway. The holograms are static and low quality and don't have proper shading on them. They look like they're painted on the screen. The real ones breathe and you can't stand on a hologram pad because you can't actually line up with them. The posture that a hologram has, is basically impossible for a character model.
---
I don't think people are going to spend enough time looking at headgear and other things when a hologram stands peeking an angle that is commonly challenged. Or just place them behind a wall with a hole in front of them or in commonly prefired places. Those momentary alibi pings should be enough to do your alibi things.

Say that months ago with the Chinese censorship, dumb ass. You can't just reply to game breaking features with "It's just a game."

Distrubute that fine china to all
---
I've been paying since Chimara, lvl 130, how the fuck?!
---
Yucky she said too many cusses
---
I mean it‚Äôs way more effective than maestro
---
I agree with the rest, wait for the nerf to play her. By the time it's released you would have improved in skill and you would have expanded your map knowledge. These are both qualities you need to be a good Caveira main, and/ or roamer. 
---
It‚Äôs been proven that bomb is where the pros are at. Secure and Hostage are for the noobs. Look at proleague, they only play Bomb as it‚Äôs the one game mode that requires proper coordination and strats.
---
My caveira thanks people like you!

It helps if you don't have properly functioning eyes.

It still claims to perform better than the 4.6 in the MP7. I haven't found any real comparisons of the two though.

Made me laugh pretty hard X)

because they are smart
---
Yup, and then there‚Äôs bitch boy coppers complaining about cav when all you need to do is simply drone her out. But no Ubisoft is going to nefmrf her for whatever reason 
---
Congrats! I can‚Äôt wait to reach 200.
---
I'll try lol
---
Roses are red
---
My voice is very loud
---
Put down my container and say
---
__
---
i can agree with needing to drone out cav, but the amount she is used in low ranks is absurd, combined with the fact they main blackbeard on attack and still suck dick
---
happy cake day
---
Are you playing 4:3 resolution scaling 
---
Its just some jacket with backpack and mask xd so I guess It's still low budget
---
Yea, but the severs and hit reg are still broken 
---
&gt;They have no way of telling who's using a mouse or not. Proper emulation is seamless.
---
On Xbox they can.

Agreed, he's my fav. Even if you don't get kills, you rake in points on Injure Assists and Kill Assists after you learn how to place EDDs well 
---
Rekt
---
Actually in 6 months 
---
It‚Äôs the fire skin from ubi club get from playing beta
---
That‚Äôs somewhat true, but trolls/smurfs can also ruin the game for new players and make them stop playing and move on to something else which is bad for the community. 
---
r/comedycementary ?

IQ, Alibi, Ela and the last one can be applied to Ash, Maverick or Buck since all 3 of their main rifles are AR-15 varients.

---
its part of life? People will always scream that and it doesnt matter what they think so long as you know you did your job. 
---
The duplicate ratio in this game is ridiculous
---
Imagine having hacks and still only hitting plat
---
People are cunts man. That's all it is. Casual is the worst and then ranked can be just as worse sometimes. All you can do is get a nice group of 5 that way you don't fucked my idiots
---
My point is that the people who would make the icon are already employed at the studio. Also, I'd classify simplifying the wallbang mechanic by adding an icon as QoL improvement which it seems like you want anyways?
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad man. My bro did this as Fuze as well... I was standing next to him lol
---
RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
---
I went three years and got a bronze medal each time
---
Sure if you only shoot in 3-5 shot bursts but if you do that then why are you using the *scorpion evo*, yaano? 
---
I love Ela and I just wish they would buff her SMG because guns like that are designed for full auto but its literally impossible to control under full auto.
---
Couldn't he have just bound crouch to the scroll wheel?
---
That‚Äôs a reverse trap
---
Are you seriously fetish shaming in 2019?
---
That's down to the 5.7 simply being a wider round.
---
Your opinion is wrong
---
/s for the slow
---
It is tough, I‚Äôm able to control it well enough to where it works for me but it is quite a struggle. Honestly I just practiced in t hunt to learn the new pattern. I can use it in 15-20 round bursts and I do alright. It could use better recoil though.
---
It's easy
---
That's not how her gadget actually works, that's just one of her sayings. She can see any electronic which includes batteries
---
This is a good shitpost
---
Couldnt be, everyone on the team was questioning it as well. We all had mics.
---
Is this a troll post? 
---
Hows the switch from controller to mouse? Im on xbox and its probably the only reason i dont wanna switch and yes i know i can play with controller on pc
---
2000MMR points where I at least didn‚Äôt have a chance bc I am a Plat3/Plat2 and had to play against Dias
---
Against boosters
---
He‚Äôs trying his best ok
---
Yeah you probably just got confused with the glitch.. you will never lose 2k mmr
---
Time for some **serious** protection
---
Bring your sister shes a hoe!
---
Damn I got one when I bought the game
---
I use her pistol for long range and burst fire her gun at medium range. Close range you can full auto if you want. 
---
Smurfs aren't fun when you have one in your team or enemy side. Sometimes some people carry and it's ok but smurfs fuck up everything.
---
ok so basically a 2v3 in the end, still not bad
---
Real coppers are the ones who deserve pity, you know how many diamonds have copper IV smurfs?  
---
Simple Math: 20 Matches I had so far this season where I looked it up after the game. Yesterday I played against Goldy Noob with his friends in a Plat3/Gold1 game on EU
---
It could be that you've got a low level. I know when I started playing I'd get randomly kicked from games but with time it happened less. Nowadays whenever I see a random votekick most of the time it's for someone low leveled.
---
I do. I‚Äôve played ranked matches and I just got done playing one. And now it just won‚Äôt join a ranked match. 
---
Reminds me of the stasis necromorphs from Dead Space with all that spastic movement
---
You put that thing back and lets not talk about it.
---
Definitely should I manage to snipe with it
---
And ranked is a cesspool. The game‚Äôs in a rough place 
---
Dang that aug looks so cool! Digging the bull pup design!

Xbox aswell tbh 
---
Yeah I guess so. But still the Fo12 is amazing on console.
---
Would stop u from having to send a friend request. nice idea
---
Yeahhhh
---
Who disconnected? 
---
Well boys, we did it. We really passed the plates around.
---
You for using that sight 
---
More like cook.
---
Not everyone in every community is good. This goes for every game. You're just gonna have to deal with it or stop playing
---
Is that a  zipper ???
---
I'm defending the fact that people seem to insist these issues happen regularly. When in reality it's more than likely a multitude of other possibilities. They speak out of ignorance because they have someone explain it was "probably a hit reg issue" if they hit a shot that didn't register. I believe that you have videos you could have plenty, especially if you play over wifi, since that type of connection is very likely to have small drops causing difference in what you see vs what others see.
---
Also high ping can result in shots on your screen not registering because the lower ping player had already killed you, their info gets sent and calculated on the server faster than yours so you will see blood despite that shot being ignored. The times where I think you are talking about shooting many bullets into a player is hitbox desync. The hitbox is not in the same place as the player model, causing you to shoot but hit nothing. 
---
I never said the game **was** watertight, I simply said there are more than a few other possibilities for the clip being unclear.
---
I like how mira literally just sprays and prays two inches in front of you.
---
Cap can pull off awesome kills and is very helpful if played well, I say Finka
---
Every platform overall honestly
---
Looks legit 
---
Seems pointless. Who cares, for one. For two, it changes as the game progresses. Examples: You shoot someone, then team mate shoots the same person without killing them, making the final number different than when you dealt damage. You put enemy at 5hp, then they do a reset to 50 hp, again making the results skewed and pointless. Honestly there‚Äôs so much wrong with this game if they focused on something like this I‚Äôd be pretty upset when there‚Äôs real problems that need addressing first. 
---
Something is wrong with you friend :(

You're still limiting yourself to a 6-7m engagement range.

Like I've seen older videos and it was pretty bad back then. I don't see dropshot nowadays
---
Took 8 months of loud boisterous complaining. We are only two months in so probably 6 more months. 
---
Fak :(
---
What's your level mate ?
---
I probably will too. This is the only PvP game I play now. I‚Äôve spent a shit ton of money on cosmetics and such...but I‚Äôm just kinda hesitant to throw out my money when idk what it is I‚Äôm buying, ya kno? 
---
Yeah, but only on one shotgun on one operator
---
You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas. I‚Äôll bet you couldn‚Äôt pour !@#$ out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won‚Äôt go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.
---
You‚Äôre a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
---
You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
---
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?
---
Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.

You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.
---
You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You‚Äôre a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won‚Äôt have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
---
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
---
You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
---
On a good day you‚Äôre a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient

in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker.

You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
---
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
---
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
---
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
---
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
---
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
---
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
---
the laws of physics that we know. I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don‚Äôt have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.
---
The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn‚Äôt really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.

True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ‚Äùnormal‚Äù people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ‚Äùchallenged‚Äù persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äùright‚Äù.

Would probably help if they took the ability to go from left lean all the way to right lean. YOu should have to center between leans.

Either way, OP got outplayed.

Lets share it together my comrades
---
Dude Lion's been nerfed Pengu said so starting with Year 4: Season 1 he'll go through a lot of nerfs, Each rework is at the start of a season.
---
Hello there , Wall-E
---
You have no idea how much money I would be willing to spend if Cav‚Äôs Elite has a fucking pencil
---
Wish my lady played this game so she could use that line on me, now we are expecting:(
---
15k renown means that u want to buy a Year1 operator. 
---
So I think Valkyrie is a Good all around Operator. Her Cams should be easy to understand and her guns are kinda okay. 
---
Hibana could be another option, but her primary is with 21 bullet mag pretty small. If you can control Hibana'S gun she is also good.
---
Are those plates Corelle?
---
Wasn't Siege designed with CQC in mind anyways? We don't need acogs or a sniper imo.
---
Hibana , no doubt . since she got a leaked operator reworked unlock screenn
---
Found the autistic kids who spazz out n scream the n-word all game long while going 0-5 lmao üòÇ 
---
This has already been addressed. He has been nerfed some times. He is banned from pro league. He will have a rework. The devs said he will probably have a different gadget altogether. In the meantime takr him for what he is. The broken backpack boy
---
It's still only a thing douchebags do.
---
Xbox one
---
What the fuk did I just watch...
---
Oh I forgot about the Starter Edition. Then u should probably buy just a operator. (Speznas are too situational so maybe not them) 
---
I'm so glad she's possibly getting one, But I feel Smoke and Bandit are long overdue one.
---
He can one shot other ops but you can‚Äôt one shot him. That‚Äôs what needs needing. Use your brain. 
---
So you think finka is useless too ?
---
No problem 
---
Wow thanks!! ‚ó°Ãà 
---
‚ÄúHold on kaid, I‚Äôm trying to figure out why g2 has become worse these past few days‚Äù
---
Pass those Pwates around!
---
Mute was a counter I thought 
---
Trust me seige and coordination with rando is like oil and water
---
This has more to do with lag rather than anything to do with blitz. This is a similar thing to peeker's advantage and other parts of the game. 
---
and then maverick fucks your shit up
---
Did you really think I would leave the hyperdrive unguarded 
---
The lord always blesses us, even in the harshest of hardships.

Hey it‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs favorite plates!

hey that‚Äôs me
---
I had a similar situation where I got a Legendary charm, Estrilita, a little Unicorn charm.
---
I literally cried when I saw it.
---
I'm not kidding, I think I have footage of that somewhere still of me just bawling my eyes out.
---
level 1 recruit 
---
level 20 Glaz
---
level 35 Lethal Citizen
---
It‚Äôs even better when it‚Äôs Fuze‚Äôs elite animation 
---
since he's getting a rework he won't be getting an elite until afterwards are you some kind of mentally challenged idiot?
---
Didn‚Äôt expect to see this in siege. I surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
---
I just hit 22 and bought the game yesterday !
---
Those plates are a staple in all ghetto households lol
---
thx
---
Yeah I figured it was something like that
---
The game principal shouldn't matter in this case. If you drone out Alibi and know she is wearing a skin her decoys become completely useless. If I hear "Alibi is wearing white" every decoy will not be shot due to them not looking the same. This isn't a case of "Pay to win" its a case of "Pay to lose" currently that should just be "I paid to look neat"
---
I know they planned those names beforehand. They were just on the other team and i thought their names were funny
---
I can understand that, it is a pretty good charm after all, but i thought you could buy it in the shop?

What I can find, most pro / high ranked players are in the 400-600 range, with 900 for "sniper" roles.
---
Several tech channels have done stats digging, and don't know where the metric sourced from that said Higher DPI/CPI is better, the traditionally the opposite is true.
---
this game has so many problems its unbelievable 
---
if you want to nerf an operator, then we as of community should abused the broken mechanic until the pick/win delta skyrocket. this will make ubisoft to do some action.
---

you can't just post the names here..

ROFL i had this idiot run in and after dying he yells "FUCKING PIDAF CAMPER JEBANO"
---
It's a freaking year since that was posted? Fuuuck
---
Get out
---
I agree. It's an awesome game, but its toxicity is pushing people away. I ha e no intention of sticking around for another year of this shit. Just playing to pass the time until the better tactical shooter game gets released on PS4
---
This being my first post ever im not really used to but I read all the rules, where is this said?
---
How did the Ash not see where Valk was like she threw a grenade.
---
Lion throws a ball that can scan in a 7m radius, which updates every 2 seconds in the course over 5 seconds. Still outlines
---
This Ash got harrassed so hard
---
I have no idea... We were screaming at him as well.
---
Jeez
---
The systen should just place you in ranked games against the same rank as you then you win enough games to go up to the next rank then face people of that rank
---
if you lose enough games in that rank then you go down to the previous rank and only play people in the previous rank
---
Ability: Scan to see who didn‚Äôt pick up armor, can tk said person(s) without penalty.
---
ok, ok
---
I actually thought of making the drone effect and use it with your ball idea, so he throws it and the drone scans in a 7m radius
---
Mute‚Äôs a laughable ‚Äúcounter‚Äù to lion and Dokkabei imo.  Unless you plan on sitting on a jammer all round, he‚Äôs basically useless against dokk and lion.  He‚Äôs definitely strong for other reason though 
---
Yeah man i‚Äôve gotten like 5-6 bans for saying ‚Äùcome on man are you blind?‚Äù And the likes for teammates walking past the last enemy causing us to lose matches, biggest reason i switched to PS4, xbox is a dust collector for the past year and a half, the xbox glory days of gow/halo is long behind it.
---
It's not my idea. I just summarised this guy's for you
---
I do not remember that i had a giant NIEUWE OPERATOR ONTGRENDELEN on the right but sure :/
---
I find reflex blocks what you are trying to aim at, particularly when holding tight angles, whereas the "holo" redicle on the holo sight is less prone to this.
---
Happened one too many times.
---
You really are a one man legend
---
pfffffff i knew that :^ )))))))))))))))))
---
yeeaah, all you could see was the roof which definitely  helped our team win the round
---
It has high damage drop off though
---
Most of the people in the comments wouldnt survive mw2 voice chat

---
Rook also shared the win with lesion..
---
Tbh at this point im just gonna use breach charges and never melee
---
Zofia as well 
---
Smoke C4 too
---
I dont think it really is that much easier to see. Either people pre fire windows to avoid your traps no matter what, or they see it less because the spikes are disguised better by barbed wire ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
2nd rook elite skin
---
I like the design and concept but I think it'd be completely overshadowed by something like the keratos. That gun has high damage, low recoil, high fire rate, an one more bullet in the cylinder.

I can come help in a few after I shave real quick, but a quick test I remembered was that you can go into your ps4s audio device settings and then go into mic settings where you change how loud you are, you can hear yourself. 
---
You are truly an artist
---
I thought about that, but then I compared the damages. The BuLL would deal enough damage to put an enemy low enough to be a glass cannon for the rest of the team to take down. I primarily set it up as the assistant's hand cannon. It drops enemies low enough to quickly be taken down later, or one tap low enemies.
---
Thanks :D
---
As someone who always plays cautiously in games like this, this is why I NEVER stand on hatches, and if have to for some reason, it‚Äôs getting a reinforcement first
---
Yup. Completely agree.
---
Are you interested in some wares?
---
TLDR: hes mad at the game
---
That case it was safe to drop the shield to make the kill
---
it‚Äôs a huge buff ffs it‚Äôs less shots to kill at any distance and the same at close range. The only difference is that  if cav only gets one shot on you before you kill her you‚Äôll have 35 health instead of 1

I don‚Äôt think you can

Though I respect your smartassery, this is quite the opposite. He is merely nigh incapable of feeling pain. The mask, is not a gimp mask. It is actually a skull face mask, similar to what he is wearing. I spent quite a while painting, detailing and constructing it. I'm quite proud of it. Please, next time consider every available possibility rather than spewing the first thing that comes to mind to be a dick. Many thanks for your input, it has been noted and will be considered in the future modification of the character.
---
When did I mention myself? Get your reddit circlejerk bait out of here.
---
Frost is actually great.
---
Man, I wish I started playing this game earlier
---
What‚Äôs up w Villa?
---
Clash is pretty underpowered but we'll see with her new smg,  could be picked way more 
---
Same bro, same.
---
this was so hard to watch
---
Look I can't respect and alibi main they are the second most useless on defense 
---
I'm not quite sure what's more impressive: how Valk didn't hear ash planting, why Valk thought ash would be in the middle there if she'd just detonated a Nitro there, how Ash didn't hear Valk crouching around, or the flick that Valk did to clap Ash's head.
---
you played literally 2 games get over yourself dude you act like those 2 games define r6 as a whole and that shit is nothing compared to true toxicity like cav players who fuck your health over
---
Contact uni directly see if they can do anything

Cav is brown though....
---
These are awesome dude

I did but no response so far

Grind it out

Alpha operators cost 12.500 renown üò∂
---
When you say hard to unlock do you mean the original 20 or just all of them
---
This sounds pretty cool
---
Why isnt sledge 100 times taller than iq
---
Actually J√§ger would be better. Then it can spit on EMPs and nades
---
Yes the original 20 (16, they give you 4 for free with the starter) cost 12.500 renown 
---
Yeah Boi jij bent de eerste Hollandse nibba die ik hier zie
---
so uh why did you stop scanning when Ash was planting the defuser? 
---
I'm glad you like it. I thought the idea of silently turning your enemies into a voodoo doll was a load and a half of fun.
---
Uh, that wasn't really funny chief. Get your normie emojis away from me.
---
I want Blue smokes back
---
If you purposely lower the hostage's health to make it easier for the atrackers to lose you need to be put down

now thats why wangbangs feels less rewarding..

I just realized this was Rainbow 6. I thought it was bo4. Doesn‚Äôt change my opinion.
---
Kinda funny to watch but hoping Ubi squashes this shit quick

The logitec G-502 has a feature where you can let the mouse wheel free spin. I just imagine doing that to for a few seconds of crouch spamming.

Dark zero plays blitz a lot

What's even funnier are the people who queue with her and all female twitch streamers in general. You can tell just by listening to their demeanor that they're not there for the games. 
---
Hey, we all make mistakes, my guy. Again, I'm glad you're a fan üëå
---
If you want to learn the game just grind out ranked. 
---
YEAHH BOIIIII
---
SOME SERIOUS PROTECTION!
---
I mean.....that‚Äôs basically what an SMG that‚Äôs firing 9mm or anything smaller is doing, but it‚Äôs powered by power and not air.
---
Maybe that's a trap
---
UWU
---
I know. That was just a bit of sarcasm in the title because holy fuck this shit is everywhere now on console.
---
Yea that's what I'm saying it used to be first tk ban was 30 mins not 60
---
I'll only agree to this if Echo, Hibana, Ying, Lesion, Dokkaebi, and Vigil get Karate Chop instead of rifle but. That when I go for a melee kill I can do Mr. Mugatu proud and tell "KARATE CHOP!" Over the group chat.
---
Haha me to man
---
It was never good, the assault rifle has always been better option.
---
Lol what does that mean? And is it pronounced as it‚Äôs spelled? 
---
You don‚Äôt randomly use Lion to find out where roamers are. You use it when you know where they are so they can‚Äôt move. Then you can shoot them through walls, grenade or just preview them. If the move at all they‚Äôre a really easy walk bang due to the full outline being visible.
---
That voice doesn't match!

---
oh hell yeah!
---
You're talking to a bunch of bronze/silver who consider Ash an overpowered operator. Don't even bother with this cancerous sub.
---
Oh well, its console
---
i got ban and many of my friends got it as well and i want to know if i can get perma ban for that
---
I usually prefer DMRs over ARs because the C8‚Äôs recoil on Xbox is ridiculous but being a PC new comer I can see why people prefer the C8
---
Can make a macro that combines Q, E and crouch all in one, bind it to the scroll wheel. In my case it‚Äôs an MX Master; I can let that bitch spin forever and all I have to worry about is W and left click

It's hiiiiiiiiigh noooooooon

While I agree with what you wrote. Vigils backstory seems like a good foundation for a drama.

u can buy 16000 r6 credit for like 16$ if u would want buy them through game u have to spent around 100$ i guess
---
This aint it chief

Yeah I must admit his story seems way more interesting than that of Ash for example (the whole "his parents died" thing could be nice, agreed)

Oh ok then. Hope it is safe enough tho

Increase your sensitivity until you feel comfortable. It may feel weird at the start but in the end it will be for the better. Try increasing the horizontal, vertical, and ads sens.

About being nervous or overthinking things when doing something I think is bad. I think it just gives you a chance to make more mistakes or get caught off guard. Be clam and try something. If you die, you die. You‚Äôll get em next round.

Yes but you don't have fun by getting bullshitted out of rounds

Ela had frags?

I was trying to do that as well. Lol then health came out and said screw it and bought the season pass.

Mind boggling that this isn't how it was on release
---
Okay I dont play on console but from a pc Diamond when i changed up my playstyle to learn how to truly osuh and rush is learning the map layouts knowing where to preaim and how to properly peek. But for me i just had to play alot of ash and take risks and then remember usual Spots. Also entering on the other side of the map works for me alot of the times then pushing from there to the point
---
But it doesn't help against the cheapo youtubers, that derank to stomp on lower tier players.

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

---
I main him, but I also don't play ranked. No one drones in casual so his gadget is not good. I just play because I solo queue and his guns are great
---
Ubi can't even release a single patch that doesn't contain at least a dozen bugs I doubt they are going to ban one dude for c spamming 
---
Holy shit that looks amazing
---
Thank you for proper links and stuff
---
Bandit‚Äôs MP7 looks good with it.
---
Woah that's epic
---
Sorry, bud, not everyone cares about your opinion and ESPECIALLY ubisoft couldn't care less if you can't counter an operator who for most, is easy to counter.
---
You are talking about two different departement and it is always worth a shot and he is just not c spamming he is abusing macros and that is against their tos 
---
He is a frustrating player to play against especially in a 1v1, but there are simple strats to counter if you stay calm, totally agree
---
When a very talented artist meets rainbow6 siege ! Such a wonderful artwork 
---
I mean, it's pretty accurate compared to Outbreak mode's cinematic:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyzmpimZLis&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=210
---
That‚Äôs not it, and under downloads it just says Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbow Six Siege 
---
Tbh I don't think he is. You can change the toggle of your crouch and get faster than this. I think he's just exploiting a feature of the game and that's fine for tos
---
there have been hundreds of posts saying this. Ubisoft can‚Äôt do anything about MnK. there‚Äôs literally nothing they can do 
---
LMG is awesome. His evil eyes are assist machines. I just got an MVP with 2 kills over a guy that had 9 because of my support role with Maestro. 
---
Depends are u on Xbox,PS4 or PC
---
in my opinion he's one of the best anchors in the game. his evil eyes are great for intel and can do a good bit of damage to attacker gadgets if used properly, not to mention he has an LMG with 80 rounds and an ACOG. 
---
Maestro is really strong and close to being a must pick on some sites.
---
Kaid could become the same due to the ability to electrify hatches, but Maestro just brings such a strong and versatile loadout that you can't really be wrong with picking him.
---
Its not meant to be realistic...
---
Still more creepy than mad house.
---
I like the idea, but I would also want for Recruit to be able to at the very least be able to put a sight on his weapons.
---
She would be sweating bullets hoping he would get fooled by them then he‚Äôd just shoot her twice in the head. Maestro would die like a bitch while looking through his evil eye, god I can‚Äôt wait for chapter 3.
---
Ubisoft should remove recruit from the game entirely. recruit is never viable over an operator and needs removed 
---
But it checks out
---
They can cross platform people that use it. That‚Äôs a thing they can do.
---
Houseflippers
---
Mouse and Keyboard. 10/10 a problem on consoles because it 
---
A) Isn't allowed by Ubisoft
---
B) Give players an unnatural ability over others
---
C) Just a cunt move.
---
Every I spawn, it doesn't peak, it gors down hill from there.
---
Not even two years ago. I remember getting two last year.
---
M&amp;K users use an adapter to disguise the keyboard controls in a controller so Ubisoft can‚Äôt detect if they are using M&amp;K but I do agree with you on the toxicity in almost every game I go into. And matchmaking does suck.
---
Well ranked needs to improve . I don't care what any casual player says. Banning ops would be good for ranked imo so you don't need to play against cancer like lion 
---
True as that may be, the USP.40 is still a force to be reckoned with. When your primary is out of ammo and they're running down the hallway with super low health, that shotgun ain't doing shit.
---
You know this is one of those rounds where your team refused to talk or look at that Ash for the rest of the game, or they just chowed down on them in Team chat until they eventually quit.
---

Wow incredible work, love what she‚Äôs done with the aesthetic of the operators!

---
It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to know who is using M&amp;K and who isn‚Äôt. They can easily implement a system that scans player movement to see if it matches with that of a M&amp;K user.

shut up Libtard nerd b*ch idiot
---
Yeah but some people that are actually using a controller and are very good at controller would que up with PC users and that‚Äôs not really fair
---
I uses to play on mute during work's boring conference calls....and still wasnt this oblivious.
---
They care about number of players and that's about it. They are not going to do anything to lower their player base. They will let the toxicity go until it's too late. 
---
Depending on if you tk during prephase, the number of TKS you can do changes.
---
So 30 FPS is actually 29.97 FPS I think something like that, 60 is 59.Something, so it‚Äôs the same with 144hz. Also, turn down your settings. 
---
are you actually trying to argue that tachanka is in a good place right now
---
Amen
---
I‚Äôm saying if their buddy decided to be a scumbag and to use a keyboard and mouse and his friends are more than aware of it than they 100% deserve to be in a pc lobby.
---
It's a bug [that's fixed in Y4S1](https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/LIVE-7254-Doesn_t_show_ranks_after_match_and_doesn_t_show_individual_Elo_gain_after_match/) apparently. As to this particular subreddit when I tried asking a question about it my post was taken down and I was told to to R6fix.com so that's probably why you see no posts about it.
---
Good comment, there's no need to go full "console noooooobsss, console sucks" if someone shows a clip of "dumb" play on console. There indeed are very good players on any platform 
---
I fucking love you
---
Who knows. Perhaps they don't permanent ban unless it's by Battleye. Perhaps it was a short ban and warning.
---
Continued reports might get them banned longer.
---
I agree with that but there is virtually no way to be sure of someone using M&amp;K other than their movements 
---
In my extensive use of him, yes. With a good supporting team, Tachanka can be a beast in secure area, and even has some vague effectiveness in some specific bombsites.
---
(when you breach though that door)
---
I'll be there for youuuu
---
(I knocked Doc to the floor)
---
(Guess it's back to solo queue)
---
Turn off taa2x
---
no it‚Äôs not. that‚Äôs just 100% not true at all. they do not have MnK support on console so you can‚Äôt just plug in a mouse and keyboard and get on siege. people who use mouse and keyboard buy a Xim that gives the same output as a controller. Ubisoft has no ways to detect those. you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about 
---
Because im diamond and actually good at the game
---
I mean the cod campaigns have never been the focus of the games for a lot of people, it would be the same thing with siege.
---
Not the idiot who can't produce a sentence with correct grammar, or the idiot who creates a reddit account asking a question which could easily be answered by searching on google. Fine by me if I'm a typical reddit virgin, but don't join community and decide to call out the people who make that community. 
---
Hey btw this is on YouTube and since it is where‚Äôs the owners credit and link
---
Yeah. I will know. But a new player may not know. 
---
Because it‚Äôs a known bug that is being fixed
---
Nope. That comes with the year 4 pass
---
I agree. Make it so that you can select and lock in an angle for the drone to turn too when Echo is eliminated. This means everyone can use it when he‚Äôs alive but it will lock into that position when he‚Äôs gone
---
A new player would know. An idiot might not know, but you can't help those anyway.
---
No clue what pro league you are watching, but vigil is sufficiently picked in pro league. Every pro consider him to be a pain to deal with, and you don't get that remark by just having good guns. You get that remark if you are hard to tackle.
---
With Brendan fraiser for backup
---
Nice
---
Honestly at this point I think you ubi should just pay fans to do the elites man. That shit is dope dude. Did you hand paint? 
---
That never worked for me. Thx for the suggestion
---
Well, probably a vote system like the defensive sites... 
---
Thanks
---
Imagine Solo Queuing. Your random teammates are all gonna want to ban something different entirely from what you're wanting to ban.  Instead, the game just randomly bans an operator in place of what could've been a genuine vote because no decision was reached between 5 players.
---
A new operator would be banned during its Season-Pass-Only-Available week, because people who don't own the operator would think it would be overpowered without even trying it. Imagine Pick and Ban in Copper/Bronze/Silver ranks. Imagine Pick and Ban in Solo Queue vs. A 5-Man Stack because matchmaking is fantastic. ^/s
---
Pick and Ban with random players in a ranked lobby is not a smart idea. It'll get old and annoying and people aren't gonna realize that until it starts affecting their matches with their wonderful rando teammates. 
---
This sub in particular is always the ones to start a movement for something to change and then they begin hating it when its implemented. Blitz and Bartlett are because of Reddit.
---
A little too well.
---
I'm still surprised that an operator so effective in rushing and fragging gets a gun so perfect, while an op like IQ who could definitely use an extra damage on her AUG doesn't get anything, and Capit√£o is still sitting with a slow af gun.
---
Congratulations, you've officially made the single dumbest post Ive ever seen on this sub. 
---
Because nomad within everything has good recoil, the ability that she has is good, when the enemy suffers the impact, there is between 1/3 seconds until it rises, is a big gap to kill him while he gets up
---
Oh faak.
---
Time to call in lion.
---
(P.s. Monty will never fight lion. They are best friends)
---
good idea. let‚Äôs add a feature where only some headshots are instakills. that won‚Äôt ruin the game at all 
---
/s
---
Go fuck yourself troll!! 
---
Higher damage if you can hit your shots, but higher RoF if you can't so you have more opportunities to hit someone.
---
It's like an alt universe where Jackal doesn't spend all of his non-terrorist shooting time at the gym
---
Oh don't worry. It will.
---
It's been abused in pro league as well.
---
Hahaha you must be right! Wasn't expecting a downvote on my first post though.
---
There is this website called Microsoft 
---
That is not M&amp;K... Just look at the sluggish staccato aim correction. Why is it that any time someone sees quick movement and rapid button pressing they scream M&amp;K? 
---
Lion has a pretty shitty past, an abrasive personality, and has a "for the good of the masses" mentality, where Doc is much more a humanist and wouldn't want to sacrifice anyone, regardless of how many lives it might save. 
---
Not bad, do the lord next
---
Counter argument: yes it should and not everything needs to require pure skill
---
Nice work, pretty realistic
---
Maybe I should...
---
He makes a valid point.
---
Your post makes no logical sense. A headshot is a headshot. Doesn't matter if you throw your gun at it or you aim for it. Last thing you want to add into this game is a more complex system which brings in more problems, and we all know how good Ubi are with solving problems.
---
It's 50$
---
Now this beautiful 
---
Please stop.
---
Get some help.
---
Sooo what you're telling me, if someone is using the recoil to their advantage? (for example, 60 percent of my kills with elas scorpion are headshots... Wanna know why? Recoil can be advantageous) That takes skill doesn't it? Your idea doesn't make any sense... 
---
Ah yes, just like in real life. 
---
I know.....good times 
---
I know, right? Nomad really is beautiful.
---
His post had no counter argument and was nothing but an unintelligent insult. At least you posted something requiring some thought. 
---
I love how everyone froze after the teamkill. It seems like that always happens.
---
nut
---
Yeah 9/10
---
u/BikiniBodhi
---
It‚Äôs always either complain about realism or complain about things that don‚Äôt take any skill
---
THat was catering to PL at all. Even most professional players, like Pengu, were completely against the idea.
---
True, but you can't put a counter argument to that which is not even an argument.
---
No offense, but your suggestion should NOT ever be considered.
---
Cool then this game will remain to be shit like it always has been. 
---
Wholeheartedly Agreed.
---
You must not get a joke
---
This happend to me with Castle's armor panels lol
---
Yep lots of operators already do so, i can only think of vigil, lesion and ying at the moment
---
No wonder my game crashed. (It legit did)
---
you want to Alibi trick don't wear the uniform, it's simple. For all the people complaining, don't just grow up and take the uniform off, if not, don't trick and use them another way like the rest of the players. just saying for everyone out there being annoyed for no reason.
---
Recoil patterns are general and still have a random multiplier to them. If you one tap me in the head, you made a hell of a shot. If you aim at center mass and hope the random number generator gives you the right recoil pattern to get a head shot that was not a hell of a shot. 
---
The mp5sd has really bad damage drop off. Body shots at range takes a few more bullets than the standard version.
---
This is even worse than the other one xD
---
Love it 
---
Pretty much
---
Yeah but I was thinking about making mira speak just like the Spanish dub does

You aren't getting downvoted "because the mean IQ of this sub is like 5," you're getting downvoted for being an ass.

I do use M&amp;K. That's why I'm telling you this is more than likely not M&amp;K - I know what it looks like. And you may need to read comments a bit more carefully if you have come to the conclusion that I'm defending M&amp;K - it's a pretty crappy thing that exists, but the occurrences of it in games is so much lower than people make it out to be. I'm sure this discussion will go nowhere, so have a nice day.

I think its the marketing strategy. Check IQ Elite.

I asked myself the same thing
---
Don't you know accuracy through quantity?
---
Yeah I remember but for some reason to me it made it more realistic. But I‚Äôm glad they made it free
---
Are you talking about how you get disconnected from the game daily from this annoying bug where the game thinks that you lost your internet connection even though you never leave the discord vc?
---
Yeah, no. Ubi hasn't said a word about it
---
And you think Lion is fun, I don't really have to say anything else tbh
---
Personally I think his dmr kicks ass and had super low recoil, but I understand dmr‚Äò date very unpopular.   
---
For his AR, I‚Äôd suggest using a holo at first (with a flash hider) and then once you get used to the recoil on his rifle, switch over to the acog.  It‚Äôs gotten a lot better since his release.
---
Oh no... T H E Y R E  H O T

Always thought it would be cool if all the DLC operators came with a unique situation giving them a sort of back story like in their bio.
---
Maverk for example could be using his torch to escape some sort of compound.
---
Kaid could be denying the breach of his fortress
---
I dunno just something to give context to the gadgets maybe explain some uses for new players to get into the game. 
---
Do you have alzheimer's? We've already established I think lion is fun.
---
Ok. By the title I thought you were mad about it or something.
---
Who are they daddy? Where are they going?
---
He was being sarcastic
---
Youre an obvious mnk user then it seems
---
Did I miss something? All I‚Äôm seeing is horseshit aim on the acog users side. 
---
Sarcasm my friend
---
The terrorist‚Äôs aiming is extremely buggy, but honestly not worth Ubisoft‚Äôs time to fix/ address.  Wait until you get to see their literal aimbot hacks in ‚Äúrealistic mode.‚Äù  Maybe it‚Äôs realistic for pc players.
---
r/woooooosh
---
thanks dude
---
You need to inside the house little cub.
---
Don't try that fix until you confirm that it's the 100% cpu bug
---
Just open task manager while playing the game and check on cpu usage
---
You play against coppers
---
I just saw lean spam
---
The other team does get disconnected, everyone in lobby is kicked and it is as if the game never happened. Everyone on ps4 is Aus is aware of this
---
i can't express how much i love this video
---
This is amazing lol
---
The other day I got chanka, and in my 300 hours of playing I played him only once, so unfortunately it's not my most played one
---
Then when you accuse them of using mnk, they send you a picture of a greasy shit-stained controller on their crotch and refuse to show their setup
---
The casual experience part 13524963
---
Ooooohhhhh i didnt know that , so just to be clear their is no crossplay?? That must mean people are using a usb device to trick the xbox into thinking a controller is being used but they are using mnk????
---
But does u/its_epi know about this,, that would be cheating right?? Silly me i thought ubisofts silence was because they enabled cross play ????
---
I don't really know what happens behind the scenes in Ubi, but what I do know is that bug fixing is hell
---
I was recently placed into a ranked match by myself, but I was queued with a full squad. 1v5 for the whole game and the real zinger is that it happened again a mere hour later! I feel your pain OP
---
And I've established that I think that you are stupid, your point? 
---
Perhaps i dont have the correct terminology, but they essentially intentionally crash the game
---
Please explain to me how:
---
1. Pistol is going from 99dmg to 65dmg
---
2. Mag size is decreased 15 to 12
---
3.increased hip fire spread
---
Is not a nerf, because that looks like a nerf to me, and the only buff she is getting is the same type of dmg drop off as all other pistols in the game.
---
Yeüò©
---
Not too shabby!
---
did you turn the game off and on again
---
They can't do anything about this problem
---
Basic controller 
---
My point is this is an empty conversation with you repeating the same two things over and over.  I'm bored of it, so, glhf in siege
---
Ding Ding Ding
---
Eh, as an "exploit" its pretty tame. Not very hard to stop compared to something as Jager shield-face, or monty extend glitch. There's no sequence of events to perform, and them leaving is still equivalent to you getting a kill, depending on when this happens they may not even get back in for next round. And at plat two you most likely are not going to get the interro anyway, you'll just get traded out
---
Yes.
---
If you check your option &gt; customize control &gt; observation tool category, you will see there are 3 kinds of special action, special action 1 is for Evil eye's door, then what about special action 2 and 3?
---
I feel like Ubisoft has a fridge operator for that at some point, a bulletproof drone that cannot attack but can mark gadgets and feed to every attackers, and will need nitro cell to destroy not impact nades.
---
The epitome of what is wrong with this games playerbase right here. 
---
I dunno that seems like very high level console play with a controller.

I think console Siege is fine without hip lean. There isn't a dramatic benefit to hip leaning to begin with, and unless xbox elite controllers or scuf pads become mandatory you would have to make fundamental changes to how the game functions to get hip leaning to work on console. 
---
Since it's basically guaranteed that Siege will be supported on next gen console, maybe next gen controllers will standardized having inputs underneath the pad, and then maybe Siege can have hip lean on console. Until this unlikely scenario though don't expect hip lean to come to console.

You need to find a actual team to play with instead of solo queuing. Try and lfg or something if you don‚Äôt have friends that play

Can confirm

Yeah it‚Äôs the super long hallway to east stairs on border, 2 we‚Äôre close to me trying to keep us out of the CCTV room and the 3rd was all the way at the end and he just got really unlucky

Yeah the old Famas recoil that she had was absolutely beautiful, too bad they removed recoil from Ash and added more to Twitch? I am still pondering about this change.

Np! :)

I long for the renown I‚Äôve lost...

Ash. Rush in. Fuck shit up

Good shit.

Is 3-0 match point 5-1 with a guaranteed win on your teams side. You leaving brings you down but your team up. This is not throwing. You dont make your team lose, you make them win while you lose. If you were in a relay race and ran your part then sat down when you handed the rod off, you didnt make your team lose. You stopped running after you did your part
---
Still counts!!!

This, this is it chief

Hostages are acceptable casualties. FACT.

Me too!!!

For me its habit, I used to be a high player in COD on console and run, gun and reload is my core playstyle so when I came to siege it was the way I played. I don't reload as much as I used to but definitely starting out, I felt reloading was just a necessity so I can make sure every bullet counts.
---
Ding ding
---
Literally like a week before they made em all free I bought all of them, feelsbad.
---
T-chan &lt;3

1 bullet can deal 20+damage or a one headshot kill
---
I'm pretty sure that is jack black
---
It a habit built up from other games
---
1. Suppressors have their uses.
---
2. Add it up sometime. Call it 4 weapons total, 2 primaries, 2 secondaries. Unique, because DLC operators are special. Call it 3k for the suppressors alone, throw in another 2k for the other attachments. You're already to 5k, and I'm sure I'm being conservative about it.

Bandit must've been one third a cat. 
---
It's actually not too bad (:
---
There's literally only one door that you can enter the building from the outside. That's not an exaggeration. All other entrances are windows/hatches.
---
I am so glad that as a new player I never encountered this.
---
I need my weapons to be fully loaded, whether it be 1 bullet or 20 I still gotta reload. You never know when you might get that lucky one-tap 
---
Just buy V Bucks

Frost had to do it to em

**HURT!**

I hate it so much I learnt to do it... :)

Not ubisoft's fault people are shitty.   Unless it's ranked, quit immediately, don't walk in to troll traps.  If it is ranked, play smart and calm.  If 1 person tk's you, take some fall damage, and step in front of them while shooting for payback.  They get banned, not you.  And if there's 1 guy left that hasn't teamkilled you but you know is going to, that's the guy you use your free TK on.  If you're going to play their game, play it smarter than them.

Funny thing is they say its an rp 46, which is a belt fed machine gun, but the gun in game is modelled after the dp. 
---
To do so would mean spending dev time modifying the game's engine  and then debugging the whatever bugs result from those modifications, for what amounts to a minor aesthetic improvement with even more minor effects on gameplay. I doubt it's very high on the list of priorities.
---
What are you gonna buy with it, one skin?
---
 Maestro is reliant on staying alive until the end of the round to get full value. If he dies his Evil Eyes become bulletproof cameras. Good, but not game-changing. His Alda is a beast but aside from that he offers the same utility as others in that bracket.
---
G2a just like most key resellers aren't legit resellers that's why they're cheaper than official resellers. You can be lucky and get a legit key or you can get scammed and the key will get banned sooner or later. 
---
The only platforms that are official are Amazon, Uplay, steam and greenman gaming. 
---
This being said, I'm using unofficial resellers every now and then as well.
---
But that's just my opinion.

Tbh I really liked unlocking the base operators bit by bit, tho I'm talking about the vanilla release, not starter pack progression.  
---
It added a feeling of progression to the game and made you spend some serious time on *each* of them, even those that didn't appeal at first to you. Didn't want to feel like you wasted renown unlocking them without using them, so people mostly tried to play all of them.  
---
Unlocking that last operator felt like finally finishing "tutorial mode", allowing one to settle on mains, after trying all the options.
---
aw shit, so i have to buy it at its full price?
---
.... I don't think I'd have saved enough allowance to get there by the end of this month. well rip 600 credits

You look like a more attractive post Malone 
---
Think of all the specialist we could have purchased  üòì
---
Nope. I don't need to wake up I'm accepting of the fact that ubisoft simply can't handle adding things like this with the enormous amount of other bugs that plague the game currently. Don't be such a sour puss this is something the community has requested countless times I was just showing people how I practice getting used to a sense and practice flicks.

Why you bullying Sam?

Which used to be an evil renown trap: "Never know when you wanna go silent, better unlock that silencer now because can't do it while in match".
