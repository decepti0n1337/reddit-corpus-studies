They can't because of engine limitations that's why they said Alibi's hologram will never match her loadout and gear, it was said before Year 3: Season 2 and it sucks, There's no way to reworking her at all
---
Yea a lot do. Set them up right makes it hard to get to obj one way leading you on one door at times.

Well fuck, there goes my positive outlook.

Did you record this on a game boy color?

Dont see the word racism anywhere in this thread.

Damn an operator that is stuck as her launch default indefinitely sounds fucked :/

exactly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They gave Gridlock a new sight to make her special same with Capitao and his LMG,the ACOG that was on the LMG for Capitao before was chunky and looked really weird, I highly doubt they'll go in and change the ACOG for the DMR's.
---
Ah stealing a post and not giving any credit, good job
---
Doesn't that window already get pre'd though?
---
It got removed 
---
these things are meant for crowd control, having it instant down would make sense in my opinion. Gameplay wise having them instant down an enemy would also help out your teams Cav
---

---
Do my boy Mav next :)
---
The only thing they could do is buff her SMG and replace her impact grenades with a nitro cell, except that would make her broken OP. 
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
Autocorrect amirite?
---
What do I think? Too many people asking to buff shit. Just deal with it 
---
So basically blitz without a shield and doesn't have hit reg issues, okay.

It‚Äôs not that bad. She‚Äôs balanced quite well as is.

As a console peasant, I can say it is run by children who tk relentlessly. But I've spent like 400 hours in the game and don't want to lose all my progress by switching. In a year it won't matter, new platforms will come out and the population will tank on console.

I do. Every Pro League Set Grade X, Racer skins. AMA.
---
Yes they do. Some items are rotated in and out of the alpha packs on a regular basis. An example is echos rekt skin. 
---
It‚Äôs never happened to me as long as I‚Äôve done it
---
i think you don't get it
---
It actually becomes a better description to plat players
---
They actually wouldn't have to do anything more then position the sight on the weapon. The entire optic is already created and in the game all they would need to do is position it and Remo the other ACOG
---
Can't you see the work OP put into this? Shame on you

---
Well from what you‚Äôve said on other comments, you like to stay back, so an obvious choice on defense would be Maestro, Echo, or Mozzie, but I‚Äôd choose Maestro. His LMG is solid and his gadget is super fun and useful. 
---
For offense, Nomad or Jackal would be my pick. As Nomad, you tend to stick with your team and set up traps where roamers might come from, so she‚Äôs great for staying back. Jackal is a no brainer and I‚Äôm sure everyone else has explained already so I‚Äôll spare you the detail. 
---
5/10 will get you gold 4
---
There's not really any way to stop this, I have a friend who thinks it's funny to get the entire team to kick someone for no reason. 
---
Good idea
---
Lol'd way too hard at this
---
This season I won 6/10 and placed S1, feelsbad. 
---
lets be honest, it probably took longer to make this.
---
No. Kapkan is fine as is and is in a good place. Nothing really needs to be changed to him.

Nope, this is what happens when a shooter becomes popular.

Girlfriend didnt draw this DOWNVOTED
---
I played with a friend for his 10 placements and he got gold4 with 5/10 wins. Thats rough man
---
Knowing me, if I ever tried to do anything similar to this, I‚Äôd probably shoot that Thermite out of panic
---
KOMRADE YOU LEAK THE NUCLEAR WASTE 
---
Hibana hibana hibana hibana
---
Honestly you made the American flag look way better in these than I expected it to.
---
lol alright tough guy 
---
Unless you have someone playing up top won‚Äôt this get droned and destroyed pretty easily. I mean the hole in the wall makes it obvious something is going on and they‚Äôre not gonna just ignore the hole.
---
*screams in confusion*
---
I drink 2 liters lul
---
It was dope tho
---
I know right! The group I queue with kept getting annoyed when I say my Maestro cams move themselves when nobodies looking, now I have proof!
---
This shit had me weak lmaooo
---
Considering you spent 8 months on it. It pretty underwhelming.
---
I was reading some of the responses to other comments and here are my thoughts:
---
Dont pick maverick or Alibi. 
---
Maverick is nice and all but you have hibana and she has a lot more utility, as well you like to hang back more it seems and he doesnt really do that. If you really like him then hes not a terrible pick but hes definitely an op that you may say "I really dont feel like playing him" too often. 
---
Alibi is more of a roam type, though any op can play any role really, but her gadget has limited utility. 
---
Jackal has good guns but as a newer player his ability may just become an after thought. Jackal was my first DLC op and while I liked him and did well with him, I tended not to use his ability because I was just focused on getting in, and u would use it occasionally.
---
Nomad is good but is probably gonna get nerfed soon, not sure how but probably will, and having the acog pistol isnt really beginner friendly. 
---
Same sort if for Kaid, but since you are more into slow play so hes alright, but maybe not the best beginner.
---
 
---
I agree with the maestro choice for defense, the lmg is a good gun with lots of ammo and the pistols are nice. His ability is supportive and all around helpful. Also he says funny things.
---
For offense honestly I'd say gridlock. Shes got some bad rap lately but shes actually a great support op. Decent primaries, shotty secondary or great pistol. Good utility in breaching charges or smokes and a beginner friendly ability. 
---
At least that's my 2 cents, hope it helps. 
---

False? Buck can open up cowlings and walls from range and still has some sort of means of protection while doing so
---
I‚Äôve done it with a door barricade 
---
Well, it is. You aren't wrong. It is a pea shooter that fires fast and is a headshot machine with near 0 recoil.
---
However, thankfully, there's a reason for that, and it is her gadget's versatility.
---
i doubt it's gonna be a dual ride on that bike. that massive weight on the back gonna make the bike slide on the first 1¬∞ inclination
---
yes basically bandito affleckirito
---
5/10 has put me at gold 4.
---
Another dude got it at 6/10.
---
Depends on your enemies. You play against higher elo enemies and win, you get more.
---
yes
---
RemindMe! 11 months
---
I‚Äôm getting the same feeling the more play.
---
Is it the first week of him being released? 
---
If it is then that means very very few Season Pass holders
---
Well, you can't say Hibana is worse than Thermite simply because her holes are smaller. Don't forget that she doesn't need to stand next to a wall to simply place the charges. She is also much better at opening hatches.
---
Ash's charges aren't affected by gravity, unlike Zofia's. Her holes also much bigger compared to Zofia's.
---
Bad defense strats 101: send your entire team out to get chicken nuggets for you.

I‚Äôll do you one more.

No he has been out for a lil minute now for season pass holders I don‚Äôt remember the exact day they were released. But I also noticed people don‚Äôt play him as often as you‚Äôd expect.

Thank you for informing me if you search the life of a filthy casual it should come up sorry for the inconvenience

They need to make the alert range smaller. Every time I‚Äôm on attack I know far ahead when my drones is going to face mozzie.

Yo ya know what no. Fuck you. This shit aint "creative" this is effectivly a fucking repost and you have the FUCKING G U L L to post it with a fucking water mark. YEA fuckin good job following a shitty trend and taking logos someone else made and adding a flag to it. Honestly fuck off. You are not creative. And this applies not just to you but all the other people milking this fucking trend for karma. It was kinda cool the first time but not any more. And fuck you especially just cus u put a water mark on this peice of shit. Good night and grow some common decency.

How do you even make stuff like this? I want to but have no clue.

Looks like a t460p

I‚Äôve always wanted to do this, but I‚Äôm always far away in firefights whenever I play him.

Went to school for design. But you can always watch videos and just use and learn programs.

I‚Äôm that case I‚Äôm not sure why to do. I would contact Ubisoft support

There is nothing wrong with the hitbox, the character model has no visual rigging errors so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs fine too, the only thing that is wrong is we do not have the system Ubi promised that‚Äôd visually notify us when hitting armor 
---
Don't listen to the guys who are explaining that you fulfilled the guy's toxic mission. Punishment is the only way you can get the message across. 
---
The fact is that this game doesn't punish TKers. Even the new reflect damage thing gives you 1 free TK. And only then has Ubisoft even talked about "monitoring" behavior, when they should have done that from the start and suspend to ban people from the game. 
---
What platform?
---
What I‚Äôm wondering is who doesn‚Äôt use acog 
---
Do you have a link to that?
---
no, your fuze charges can still kill your teammates even with reverse damage on. also little dumb things were added like if you twitch drone zaps your teammates or your teammates drone, then your twitch drone dies
---
One angry boi
---
I can try to dig one up, it was in the update that changed the hitbox 
---
I‚Äôm not saying he wasn‚Äôt being one, I actually think he/she was being more of a dick. I‚Äôm just saying, why make negative comments and not give constructive criticism. Or just don‚Äôt comment at all
---
Nice vids! It‚Äôs crazy how big the skill gap is between the ranks, I remember like a month ago this random ass dude and his friend invited me to a party (Xbox) and both were plat 1, and I guess they wanted to play lower ranks so the squad was 3 low golds and 2 plats, but I think it evened out at plat 2 since the enemies were in plat. AND OH MY GOD it was crazy because everyone had insane aim and stuff that I‚Äôm not used to in gold, but it was actually fun because it felt like less of a mess. I ended up not doing too bad going 7 and 4, but yea it‚Äôs harder too see how much more organized high ranks are in vids and streams since everyone is at the same skill level.

Okay so Ubi never delivered on step two implementation. However, Blitz's gigantic shoulder pads are still a major issues of being mis-leading.

Uhhhhh, they don't all need reworking though.

Ubi should change the original logo to this masterpiece of desing

This level of detail and you‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre not on the designing team of Ubisoft? There‚Äôs no way with artwork this good you haven‚Äôt been hired yet.
---
would smash
---
Not that old
---
Exactly, but I guess my point is there‚Äôs nothing you can learn from instantly being destroyed at spawn. Fortunately I started before Burnt Horizon so went through trial by fire in Casuals. So when I do play actual newcomers I tend to get MVP (though I don‚Äôt spawn peak or rush out because I find both of those behaviors scummy). 
---
I just want those newer players to at least have a little fun before getting their ass slapped around in the real lobbies
---
I can do that with both pinkies in my ass but nice job tho

Same here. Like I still have a lot to learn and improve but I can soundly get a kill or 2 per round unless my teammates are God tier

This reminds me of my first alpha pack, i got a legendary headgear for Mira.

Why did they reinforce kids room
---
Reading past this is pointless to anyone else. This poster apparently doesn't have eyeballs.
---
True 
---
Bull fucking shit. He VERY CLEARLY shot him in the shoulder. Not the PAD but the SHOULDER. It is especially apparent when Blitz put the shield on his BACK and the bullets STILL went through. 
---
Same with the head. I think it was fuze? that was the other shield op. Shot him in the top of the head, he dies. Blitz, on the other hand, had the headhsot not even hit at all.
---
This proves SOME kind of shenanigans here. At very least, isn't there supposed to be SOME exposed part of a shield op that you can hit from the front? I mean ffs, he even shot the blitz through the goddamn HAND and nothing happened. 
---
Nice
---
May i offer trauma plates for your emp nades

Congratulations friend!

I‚Äôm about 3 weeks into the game and my friend who‚Äôs a Plat 3 says I‚Äôm on track for Silver 1 when I finish my placements (college is hectic so I don‚Äôt get much match time). So I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself.

I hope to get diamond one day and seeing other diamonds is pretty inspiring

Distance and position on the map has nothing to do with it. And it you are telling me that a 1 degree angle has anything to do with it you are dead wrong.

Once Mozzie caught my shock drone, and as I was about to shock it he also shocked mine, so both died.

Good fucking shooting

It‚Äôs just the smarter choice in most situations. The game mechanics make the ACOG better in terms of accuracy at distance. You‚Äôre getting heated over people telling you that? Btw the Red dot is a terrible sight, it takes up a lot of space on the screen. 
---
i tell u i leave a lot i hate op's idea!! 
---
How about 8 centuries?
---
You mean 8 centuries? Looks very ancient to me but still meets today's standard.
---
Amazing.

You‚Äôre a better artist than Leonardo Di Caprio &lt;3

It‚Äôs hitting his helmet, not his head. They announced they would do this in operation health

Jackal and Mira I'm a G.E.O. main

The old map was only good for casual since it was unbalanced as hell.

Ye i know pre built is Not the best but still better than overpriced Laptops with not that good Hardware and i dont read that he needs a Laptop for work 
---
Thank you for making my day,  
---
Twitch's corpse thank you too
---
How many aces you did with the lord..., 50 minimum! 
---
It is not a terrible sight. Accuracy at distance? I can shoot 300 meters with a red dot. Once again a lot of Siege players really have no idea how optics work. Red dot does the same job. 
---
DBLonline literally made a video about this two weeks ago. Then that annoying rodent CoconutBrah made a video about a week ago with this glitch listed in it as well.
---
Fucking cursed images
---
Wait, they changed the map?
---
Old Hereford was fucking horrible, but it was fun, all it really needed was better rotation options and the bottom and top sites reworked. Plus spawn peeking was rampant
---
To stop spawn kills sadly
---
All of I can think of is the SPQR skin from last season
---
Yep, it is still the same basic skeleton but "upgraded" 
---
SPQR
---
Para Bellum Seasonal Skin
---
Unobtainable anymore
---
Maybe you've never been last alive and caught the bear trap outside of the objective. But when that happens thamt round of the match tends to end.
---
&gt; last season 
---
-_-
---
Yeah
---
Ok :/ Was it a universal skin for shields? 
---
What?
---
Thanks! Thats the skin ^^
---
Yes, it was applicable to riot shields. Something you don‚Äôt see often.
---
New&gt;old but they are both fun tbh. The old one just wasnt good for heavily competitive play
---
IFFFFFFFF*
---
I don't know why this is so funny to me
---
Ok, sadly I missed it 
---
Please I'm begging you. Do you know anyone who can help us
---
it‚Äôs a lot stronger than the bosg lmao, it‚Äôs actually a good pick, bosg is when you‚Äôre messing around 
---
How da heck do you get 4-5 drones with only 3 pests?
---
If it were memes, I'm with you. They say memes not allowed, yet you see them rampant over here. Needs regulation. No longer "well, yes, but actually no" stuff.
---
If it is art, I'm sorry, that's subjective. You can't have a single body judge it's presence.
---
Falss god Lord chunky.
---
oh no then, I didn‚Äôt expect they take them back now. I should‚Äôve buy those earlier :(
---
Well all pl sets last for 1 season.
---
It‚Äôs like the 3rd week of the new season, most players have tried him for a bit but then turned off and gone back to their main. Only a few I would imagine would have actually taken a full on liking to him to instantly pick him every round instead of their other mains.
---
Vigil: Wanna know how i got these scars?
---
LISTEN HERE BUD I JOINED THE MILITARY TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY AND IVE HAD 14 GREAT DEPRESSIONS WHY THE FUCK GAME SO HARD SHIT 
---
Sooo... The round is over now, bit it looks like Rook got away with his bag of armor... if so pretty funny.
---
There's the meme...... there is no hope for this cess pool.... I thought you were my brother
---
i dont get bullied cause i aint a bitch BITCH 
---
I agree. I don't understand how this got 800 upvotes. Also it probably took him even less time than that.
---
What did he Do?
---
&gt;  from cameras and **drones**
---
Lion has a **drone**. Checkmate. 
---
I only vote kick if the person is that guy who is taking 20 years to load and someone else starts it, or if they are a tk ing sack of garbage or a haxer
---
These are the nicest flag icons I have seen yet, good job. 
---
Well obviously it's a big deal for them, if you've been playing a character for years with a optic, and it's gone, you are gonna freak out for a bit, and honestly it's such a big deal because there are thing you can do with a acog that's harder to do with a reflex, and vice versa. It's not terrible in game aswell, it's the best optic, but obviously you don't want to see. Also, you can't say it doesn't provide better distance, cause the optic says 1.5 magnification, any other says 1x. Also I don't think much people "rely" on it like your saying. Unless you play a attacker and defender with a acog, you still have to play defense without one. I think your a waste to try to convince though because you obviously have your mind set in one place.
---
That's real real hot. 
---
Ah k
---
a) I can't make this level of 'art' in that time.  
---
b) I don't have 4 friends.
---
  
---
My uplay name is "DeIta.-" though, in case u were still suspicious :v
---
Got headshot through the shield 150%.
---
Thus the 6k
---
Was lion now after the nerf probably lesion in my personal opinion
---
In my eyes I saw two scenarios. 
---
One: this exact thing 
---
Two: holding an angle for 5 more seconds, adjust the angle for a split second, get peaked, and die 
---
I think a small hop would be fine, not to get up on high places but just steps
---
No we can we can have a single body judge its presence make me mod and I'll literally disintegrate anyone who posts art of any kind
---
Yeah :)
---
Now that's a feel's bad man moment.
---
There was a T-posing operator on Yacht's loading screen, UNTIL RECENTLY! 
---
Not the first time gadget doesn't make any sense.

They were wrong

Oh hi Oscar

That right there is exactly why pure dictatorship and monarchy don't last long in this world.

Oh I am.

But I do have mind of my own.

No please let me do it it has to be done

yeah 100 block is pretty hard to get without cheating

Nope.

I'll give you ¬£10 if you get all cosmetics for Tachanka before you buy another op.

I think a funny one, was one about twitch, and it was just a white background.
---
Who's the bitch? A guy giving feedback about the legitimate toxicity in this game, or the guy who thinks it's fine that it continues? 
---
In case you didn't notice, all the other replies to my thread have been positive replies of support and encouragement. You are the only one calling names and cursing and swearing. It seems like you are the aforementioned "bitch" here.
---
Just to give you a heads up, I will be tagging community representatives u/Ubi-Zoro and u/UbiPasta here to let them deal with you. i consider it my part to get rid of any form of toxicity in this game.
---
I think it's obvious whose side they will stand on, especially since it's even more painfully obvious who started using swear words first. 
---
Nah. Outbreak Banana Smonk is rarest Smonk.
---
Are you a midget?

I call this the "Bakers Ace"

Doesn't make any sense. His drone pulses sound waves to detect movement, if anything Cav should counter it because of her SILENT STEP...

1. This is now my all time favourite R6S video clip

2. Maverik is an ass for not saying a word to Ash
---
In all of my 450 hours I have still yet to get one kill with a breaching charge.
---
Sidearm shotty definitely allows vertical play, especially post-plant, since you can throw your trax from above, and her LMG is a definitely more than ok. Especially love the new scope. Trax can make clutching very difficult for defenders, and her smokes can make them lose bunch of time as well. I like Gridlock.
---
How about not to self promote yourself ?
---
Can confirm any game I play unplugged runs at 30 Fps instead of 150 Fps

Make sure to afk block an important camera while exercising to punish your team.

How is it that everytime i dke aa blitz, its in the shoulder where the hitbox is missing?
---
Ok, this got taken down so I'll be taking recommendations until I get banned.
---
Dislike her gadget for being beyond science 
---
Sure it‚Äôs got problems, but at least there aren‚Äôt operators in the extreme overpowered states that there have been in the past. When I play with friends I honestly really enjoy the game and play it for hours on end.
---
Only works when she's on your team. It's a balance feature I think. 
---
Unstopable 
---
Lucky flick
---
what‚Äôs ur fps like?
---
I had this, it was caused by anti-aliasing in game. The lowest AA setting, the one below Off, uses CPU for AA instead. During the round the game will take every single bit of CPU resource it can get, meaning discord has none and you get your lovely stuttering and lag.
---
Try turning AA off or using a different method if you happen to have that setting enabled (sorry, not at PC to check and don't remember the AA method name)
---
Can you (or anyone else reading this) provide me with a link where they aknowledge that bug or give a status report? Thanks in advance.
---
Vigil counters Lion! Finally!
---
To make it more challenging: if you lose a match you have to average your KDA (add up and divide by 2) and then do that many of an exercise 
---
The room literally has cervezas in the name 
---
I want to know what people think of the video geez 
---
Agrred logical course of action 
---
Yeah, what op  do you recommend for my next piece of art?
---
I have black ice for smg-11
---
Got any friends to give it to?
---
Not one that I know of, but it sounds in the post like you‚Äôre only getting the cloud save problem, maybe make another addressing the fact you can‚Äôt play the game, could get more responses
---
I'm Asian so I'll let you guess
---
Aye. Might try these ones out, ty.
---
So soundwaves can pass through Cav?
---
It completely depends on you playstyle and what ops you already have
---
I want another companie to make a game similar and more tactical like r6 use to be like, because right now rainbow has no pressure to fix bugs etc due to having no real compeditor. As it a stands they take to long to fix things 
---
Well, in what way then?
---
If there is an operator that may counter it , it should be cav not vigil
---
The game itself lags out where it says connection lost to server. 
---
But I know what you mean about party ddos attacks. Im surprised Microsoft hasn't closed such a huge security breach. 
---
at 60 fps
---
F... I watched the invitationals for more than 5 hours, my twitch and uplay accounts are connected but, I DIDN'T GET THE CHARMS!!!
---
So basically l like i said: they didn't test enough on AMD cards
---
Angry box. Grrrre
---
Nice.
---
If you don‚Äôt have hibanna or frost try them but depends on whether you want an attacker or a defender and if you are super aggressive or you use tactical maneuvers more.
---
It all depends on your play style, personally out of those three jackle is my favorite. My favorite gun, a decent gadget, and soft-breaching capable makes for a fun time hunting down roamers
---
They could buff the size of deployable shields and make them go exactly in a door if you want but not give them mirrors, also bard wire could also be bigger, and they said a while ago that they want to rework flashes but idk how
---
Which collides with your "detects movement using sound", doing this means Cav is not solid and Soundwave can pass through her.
---
Lol, where's Zofia? XD Your sister is dancing for Mute!
---
Lion main detected! Post downvoted.
---
Whenever I try getting an ace either one enemy dies or I get killed in the 1v1.
---
Congrats 
---
I hat kind of fuckery is this?!
---
Well If you manage to kill 4 enemies, injure 4 allies and suicide with a grenade on the last guy, then yea.
---
Blitz and Mozzie. 
---
So say your mouse is on your desk, you wanna backhand yeet it to the wall behind you. *perfect control trust me*
---
I might be mistaken about cav's part, but I'm sure about vigil's
---
When he was launched I was wondering why the hell Vigil doesn‚Äôt counter Lion.  It should have been like this from the start.
---
&gt; jackle 
---
I am level 60 so I don't know what newcomer is like.

Seems he underestimate it despite being Russian

Lol it‚Äôs ok, just wanted to point it out. It‚Äôs Jackal

Don't they hate eachother?
---
I played ash 2 a lot more than ash so I am not going to call her ash 2.
---
Is jackle even a thing?
---
Well my autocorrect keeps wanting to get rid of it, so probably not :P
---
Yo same
---
Well shoot, my bad
---
You know, you would think thet would run these tests seeing that they are in the fricking ESL

Can you imagine the absolute shit storm this would create if a team lost a tournament because of this
---
 Yea but it‚Äôs cloak him to electronics the drone is electronic 
---
It‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs just a reddit post. Not really important 
---
well shit. I ran into this same issue but then i realized i had a 3.7 W/L and then realized the problem.
---
Balance. Its just in the TTS, if people ain't happy Ubisoft will change it.
---
Could have been the monty pro league skin, it's an older version of pro leage skin.

Alright, thanks for setting me straight

Headshots with the luison and knifing with cav doesn‚Äôt insta kill

Thatchers EMPs  do disable lights for a short period of time I‚Äôm pretty sure.

It's up to Sony

I think he might be talking about the +20 and +25 adding to 50
---
Lion is realistic tho
---
Yeah this is mostly chest and core
---
Ew
---
Go on then, how does it work? 
---
*spiderman meme intensifies*
---
urrrrr cav's luison is meant for easier interegations
---
Yeah honestly, I really like Loyalty.
---
Knifing only while in silent step doesn‚Äôt kill.
---
I hate griefers as much as the next guy but saying they're worse than pedophiles that use the cover of anonymity to dox and lewd children is a bit much
---
It would work kind of like sonar. I don't think the outline is as realistic as the scan itself but it is still pretty plausible.
---
Looks great!
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox but yeah I understand what you mean, except for Microsoft came out w an emulator so people can do it easier. It‚Äôs fucking outrageous

I'm someone who's been asking for old Hereford but I've never said that I wanted old Hereford in ranked and while I've seen a lot of cringy stuff on this sub (buff BB, etc.) I've never seen anyone else ask for it to be in ranked either. No one wants old Hereford in ranked, they want it in Cas because yes while balancing wise it's pretty bad it's a fun map to play on. I'm not a console player but from what I've heard (and literally everyone says this) it's pretty much impossible to play a match above Plat 3 without running into a bunch of mouse and keyboard users. Regardless of whether or not Ubi can fix the problem you do realize how frustrating it must be to play against players you have no chance to outaim in a game with no aim assist right? Ubi have acknowledged that M+KB on console is cheating and it's also the community consensus in all skill levels.  It would drive me nuts to play against people cheating EVERY GAME in higher elo ranked and it's what console players have to deal with, oh, and unlike PC where we already have cheaters who have been running around for years and STILL not be banned there's literally no chance for cheaters to be banned on console. It's a gamebreaking issue regardless of whether or not Ubi can do much about it and therefore you can't blame people for talking about it.
---
Saying 20% of all console players use MnK is a laughable exaggeration
---
Do you know why radar is preferred over sonar when not underwater? 
---
I checked ALL my skins and I only found that the australians to be missing their skin that I got. I was confused so I decided to go to the shop. It wouldnt let me see their skins that I bought with renown it had a lock on it. Im so confused. I check r6 fix and find out that other people are having this problem as well.
---
In plat lobbies or higher 
---
That‚Äôs not what that is, he got 50 for injuring same as anyone else, 20 for a headshot, same as anyone else, and an extra 25 for the lusion 
---
1)That objective only has one door;
---
2) Monty has no general counter except shoot him in the back, which is not a viable counter in a 1v1, add in that he can drop and pull up his shield very quickly and aim at you or melee you as soon as you start sprinting and you get a problem, especially so if you realize that Monty is a support/info operator, and yet he can advance to you, push you away from the corner that you are covering and in his teammates fire or else he will just melee you, while other info operators only get info and need a teammate or luck in order to kill using that info.
---
And it would be 20% of each game meaning 2 outta 10 people. I never said 20% of console players. You‚Äôre putting words in my mouth 
---
Nope just saw another post that explained it quite well and they mentioned sonar
---
Will definitely use this, nice find.
---
That's very smart. I'm gonna use it.
---
lmao did Lion turn into the Auto Sniper of siege (CS:GO reference)
---
Yes
---
monty is realistic, maybe not in application, but in concept.
---
but the rest of these, i agree.
---
it already turns the lights off in most maps, could be interesting 
---
Thanks dude I love you too
---
this is why callouts matter in this game. if he had said, "glaz I'm passing in front of you don't shoot," then there wouldn't be a problem
---
You're gonna get downvoted, so take my upvote. Ppl not pointing out OP's greediness pisses me off. What if he didn't get to kill that Lession or Jager and he claps the whole team? Killing a teammate on purpose, while risking it at the last round, just to get an ace like if that gives you any kind of reward, is really shitty.
---
IQ 2.0
---
bible down hang luigi
---
I wouldn‚Äôt in this case. If he wasn‚Äôt clearly performing as well as he was in those moments, then I would be mad. But he gets an ace, so I would just laugh it off. Wasn‚Äôt like it was intentional or anything, just trying to react to whatever he sees in the second. 
---
It's not like the enemy team did anything warranting teamwork. The player had excellent mapsense while the opponent just walked into his crosshairs at the places he was already aiming. 
---
I‚Äôm shields are realistic 
---
I don‚Äôt know if their is a realistic extendable shield 
---
You have Harry Potter‚Äôs invisibility cloak or something?? Where they looking? Lol

Could it be that you don‚Äôt play on console so you think that we‚Äôre just making excuses vs ya know actually looking in to the problem that is in fact a problem

You don't have the right to only play against people with controllers.

Welcome to the Siege world. I hope to answer some if your questions as best i can. I play on xbox so i don't know if there are any changes via console.
---
Drone spawn is random. But it offers a chance to explore different areas in the map. 
---
Character trial and error is just one of the painful but fun parts of Siege.  You mentioned some 3 armor operators you like. 
---
I main Fuze for giggles (attacker). If you havent seen him yet, his gadget launches projectile explosives through soft walls. Friendly fire is always a risk. But you can choose between riot sheild, lmg or ak. Just probably not for hostage.
---
Lesion is one of my favorite defenders along with Frost and Kapkan. All three are trap oriented, which may help you defend bomb better.
---
 Kapkan places entry denial devices that damage enemies as they enter doors and windows. Try crouching when placing on doors. 
---
Lesion throws out toxic goo traps that damage over time. There is a charge timer for these though. The enemy can also pull them out but it takes time. Place these in high traffic areas for best results.
---
Frost lays down bear traps (x3). These halt attackers in their tracks. Unless the attacker can self revive like Zophia (i know i butchered her name) they are stuck until an ally can revive them
---
 Attackers also take damage.
---
Just note all these traps can be destroyed by Thatcher or just by shooting them. Play with your preferred operator and trial and error.
---
As for learning maps, personally, when a new map drops i build a custom game and explore as both attackers and defenders. There is no better learning curve like just jumping in and figuring it out too. 
---
Don't forget Situations helps introduce you to operators and maps.  Terrorist hunts can also provide a more friendly insight on maps while offering combat without aggressive teammates. 
---
I hope this helps.

I play on incredibly high sensitivity on Xbox and to a normal person it would appear to be MnK but trust me I have almost 250 days of console siege and another 75 days of of siege, MnK complaints to actual MnK users is drastically unbalanced. I would say over 10-15 matches a day I see it once maybe if that 
---
It is some kind of artifacting. Which when I had this problem was an indicator of vram failure. Other games you try to run uses the same amount or more vram like siege or less? If it is less try other games with more vram usage and check what happens.

I think he's talking about it not letting him through the window ..not the fact that it's capable ....and you need to go higher than that to enter 
---
That's hot bro

easily possible
---
i mean that tk was pretty good tho 
---
Idk I feel that would make it hard to see anything
---
I think you meant ‚Äúhow many mozzies have been domed by maestro‚Äù not the other way around

Yeah pretty much every legendary sucks except some.

Im pretty sure he said peshmergaswe was ok

maybe it could be a little bit bigger, but you will still have some situational awareness

You still need to get the 3 stars at every situation :(

If you read anything I said I said that it factors everything in and not just kills

Nope, I didn't use the bomb to get up there so I dont see why it would.

This honestly seems like a better way to go against toxicity. But what about the fact that you can still do damage with explosives and you can still damage people by throwing your gadgets at them? Also what about Fuze? He needs to be able to still teamkill to prevent people from sucking into a room when he plants his cluster charge. Honestly, I think they should just remove friendly fire with grenades, nitro cells, guns, and throwing gadgets. I think that would solve most issues.
---
Ahh yes, the ‚ÄúBroken Age‚Äù
---
Very much so
---
You are one of the toxic guys no one wants to play ranked with, right?
---
I can't stop you, lol.
---
Ouch
---
Which doesn't somehow means the problem doesn't exist. 
---
Have you found a solution yet? 
---
I read that. And what you said is essential they get MMO for better score. And kda , that would just lead to people. Point whoring again which they finally got rid of for the most part
---
Kaid, I forgot the name of the gun but it's basically a DMR on defense
---
Idk you can hear things near you while on cams, so you don‚Äôt have 0
---
like I said, it factors everything you do in the game into whether you get extra MMR
---
Yo u should hmu on PC I need friends to play with
---
Sound is created by vibrations tho
---
The only thing they should do about the cameras and drones toggle is make it a little bit quieter.
---
What season was this?
---
No you can't hear anything near you if you are using the observation tool
---
Killer queen ofc
---
Restart game
---
I'm a simple man, i see drone, I shoot.

I personally have not had this experience on PS4.

It's not that easy what if I died by the last guy should get the renown they can identify if you are playing  or not 
---
u/Shyni3
---
Ah I see might try it if I got to match on kafe, though not maestro main 
---
Sry if I kill you with it üòÖ
---
But regardless of that it still would have to gradually decrease as you play matches. If it doesn't it would make the ranked system completely broken. The problem with this post as a whole and like 75% of the community is you're focused on individual performance. This game isn't about that. Your whole squad needs to perform, otherwise you shouldn't rank up. It's a team based, strategic FPS. So instead, find a squad, build communication and experience working together, then you'll notice there isn't anything about ranked other than glitches to fix in r6.
---
Is a suppressor good for that gun? lol i never use suppressors because pretty much everything else tends to be better
---
Ubisoft hahahahahah

So glad i stopped buying games from this shithole.....

Modern problems require old solutions

i definitely have a 1060

You‚Äôre right it was on sale a week ago

Here I thought playing console was just slow and easy, sounds like the players themselves are slow.

THATS ALOTTA DAMAGE

Yeah, I'm contemplating buying the deluxe just to have more ops cause I've played since velvet shell and I have 8 ops lol

---
A) Glaz is in the picture
---
B) There are 35 ops not in the picture. Why would it necessarily be Glaz?
---
"GlazgotJFK" had me rolling
---
Fair enough
---
Wait, I thought Kaid‚Äôs shotgun shot slug rounds. How did it blow that big hole in the wall?
---
Thanks for the reply man, so in your opinion, how long will it take me to get at least the 20 basic operators? And with the legacy system, as your understanding what ops will i get if i purchased the standard edition? 
---
Broken gun but ok
---
I know i used joke pictures here, but i really would like her gadget to be slightly easier to understand. when not in combat, its fine, but i am a bad so when i get into a stressful situation it becomes hard to read. 
---
Of course friend
---
It's OP? Lion (even post nerf) and Jackal are OP, literally 0 risk. People who leave are the salty players that obviously don't pay attention to what is going on. The fact that have has to initiate and complete an interrogate balances her. If someone is nearby, she can't interrogate. If someone goes alone knowing Caveira is around is their fault.
---
 This is why I can‚Äôt fucking play Montagne anymore. It‚Äôs such a pain in the ass, and yet this has been an issue for a whole fucking year.

I could be the guy that says he‚Äôll play but never hops on until it‚Äôs 11pm on weekdays

If you‚Äôre on PC even ultimate edition is 50$ rn and gold (which I bought is 25$)
---
I did that and all I got was the 9x legendary skin

I didn‚Äôt get my first ace until level like 100 lol

I bought the game a month ago and am getting bodied by smurfs in newcomers. One of them even tried challenging me to a 2v2 lol

I can't remember specifically but it wasn't long. If you use the ubisoft club to obtain the renown boosters you fly through them depending on how many games of casual or terrorist hunt you win/play.

That's what happens when mods are lazy and allow bullshits like this, something funny gets posted that gots a lot of upvotes, and for the next days the same thing is going to be posted, but in different form. This is a very boring subreddit imo because of that

Hello Alphadice, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b48yjm/shields_are_broken_at_point_blank_range_recorded/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Attack: Zofia and hibana because they're useful on every map 
---
And I'd also say nomad and lion because they're both overpowered, I'd argue that nomad is more broken than lion 
---
Defence: maestro/echo (especially on bomb) and lesion 
---
Looks like ubi being ubi

This should never happen. its like walking through a wall. The path is blocked you dont get teleported past it because of a bad connection. 
---
I got the Topaz skin a time ago for free.

---
They changed where your camera is placed when you peek, to reduce lean spamming. But it is fucked up. 
---
I prefer kspkan but he suits my playstyle better so it's just preference really. 
---
Your vision is lower than your character's head, so you'll think you're behind cover but you have a piece of your head sticking out 
---
I have push to talk mapped to one of the thumb buttons on my mouse, Far easier then trying to press u with the same fingers I use for movement.   
---
And I have the camera scan mapped tot he other thumb button to make it easier to scan while driving my drone around then pressing x.
---
üëå got 2 times
---
It‚Äôs it takes up more screen space than both other 1.0x sights and provides the least clear reticle. Personal preference is still a thing though, so if you really like it the go ahead
---
At least it isn‚Äôt a flag

Lean is on toggle by default. Just press it once to toggle lean then strafe.

No one. Every operator is unique and special. They synergise with each other. No single operator is the best . (Except ash , that b*tch is broken)

Coming from PS4, I'm not familiar with push to talk. Is like a temporary unmute button for yourself?

They removed Starter Edition and everyone who had Starter Edition can now buy the default ops for 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 renown.

Try running a game fix scan if you have it on steam, if not uninstall and reinstall the game itself, could be issues related to missing or corrupted files in your game.

Is that a fucking acog on a shotgun?

It only took about 2 weeks for me to get used to it, i do play this game ritually for around 8 hours a day tho 
---
Damn, that party guy deserves to be reported just as much as the hacker and the boosted player tbh
---
Damn, I may have to give him another try.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch that happens to many players, I hear it a lot on console
---
yeah ..it has matching headgear and weapon skin for vector...however its alphapack exclusive :(
---
I miss him :(
---
Any solution?
---
Team killing in casual should stay because new players will play casual and then go into ranked and go Rambo on his team not expecting to kill them

I *NEED* it üò≠

It looks pretty cool but I want the legebdary smoke headgear 1st :) 
---
Usually takes you facing one of the corners to vault up on it instead of over it. It's there, just annoying.
---
i had to actually squint to see what you were talking about.
---
are you guys really so opposed to a simple QoL fix?
---
That is the dumbest thing ive ever heard
---
Sledge is a default operator. Doesn‚Äôt everyone have him now?
---
i was waiting for the run out for a good 20 seconds. but no one came and as soon as i looked away he ran out lmao
---
Just makes it into a much worse, easier game. Lag switches don't work on dedis.
---
He is much stronger on console because its harder to hit his shoulders

Yo if they don't take each other on dates imabout to ask, or be the third wheel it's hard without a squad
---
Yeah I know where the vault prompt is, that‚Äôs why I was surprised when I couldn‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs not like other jumps where you have to search for it, I used to be able to just jump right on it 
---
i thought i was the only one who said bible hands luigi xD
---
down
---
I‚Äôd say Valk because I personally think she‚Äôs a bit easier to play and you don‚Äôt have to have well thought out setups like with Mira. Maestro is fine but every time I play him, the other team destroys the cams immediately. Only really shitty thing with Valk is her gun is really weak.

---
i want that weapon skin lol ...but alpha packs never give us what we want now does it :( 
---
I heard it‚Äôs because that count, counts situations, which don‚Äôt count towards the achievement. I‚Äôve heard other people say it‚Äôll pop at 150.
---
yeah but i was already dead lol
---
That looks fucking garbage
---
This is what gets me if csgo has made a good attempt at stopping cheating please tell me.Because vac is still broken.About the highcend play with other high end part.So you telling me I have to pay extra for a service that should have been provided for free?The competitive scene only being on pc is just simple.Pc is more competitive with stuff like mouse and keyboard.Pros even complain about hackers 24/7.A huge company like Ubisoft can easily fix or mitigate the issue since you are too picky and don't like the word "fix"

When did they retexture Valkyrie cams?

People who still fall for this year 1 spawn peek in year 4 deserve it

Wouldnt know, havent been on since wednesday
---
That was an impact grenade not a frag.
---
What health were you at? I think flash bangs do like 5?? maybe.
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs horrible.
---
‚ÄúWait, a si‚Äî‚Äú **Ash gets domed** ‚Äúohhh‚Äù
---
I agree
---
No for example my only legendary was the blue-green pack only valkyrie headgear and that was in 2017 :( if you don't know what it looks like tell me and I'll dm it to you :) 
---
I don't think there's ever been bullet drop
---
For a gun like ela's , recoil isn't as easy as "down"
---
To be fair. It's a pretty solid gun lol. Surprised they chose to make a semi auto slug and not a pump slug, in terms of balance.
---
I get that, I too play console. You just gotta be precise 
---
Ah as with most sets it seems. 
---
In this case that's an impact grenade, but frags can be cooked if you time it right and explode when you need them to
---
I am of the same opinion. 
---
Sorry you got spawn peeked
---
Sky needs a rework badly
---
You shouldn't main any one character in this game. If you main an op you are playing the game incorrectly. With the exception of maybe thermite. He is needed on almost every site, gamemode, and map.
---
Hm?
---
Fix your game would be more accurate
---
Your system might not be able to handle it in which case no amount of setting change will really help. 
---
I would try turning down extraneous video settings like shadows and lowering the model quality, other than that I can‚Äôt really help 
---
No.....
---
Relatable
---
and you just bad.
---
I don't mind it being night but I constantly look at the flat moon. 
---
no
---
The same could be said if you die to a spawn peek 
---
Then get them when you see me ping it after knowing at you.)
---
Splinter cell?
---
Lmao
---
I died 3 rounds to it. Holy fuck it‚Äôs so goddamn annoying. 
---
Who plays Kapkan without C4 tho? Still good job ;)
---
Thanks kind stranger.
---
it felt great to get that blitz
---
Thanks Glaz 
---
Very cool!
---
Still don't think they'd care to relook into a very insignificant problem. It sucks that this happens, but it is once in a blue moon compared to back then. They addressed it and cleared up 99% of the situations where it happens. We've seen problems happen in PL not be prioritized immediately.
---
Casual*
---
ok. im sorry
---
Mozzie took my twitch drone so I sent in my second twitch drone to end the life of the first and ash happened to watch me murder my drone, so then she shot my good one thinking mozzie had it
---

Only real solution to queue times is adding more people to whatever server you are on. Things that separate people such as playlist, server, rank, etc. will always lessen who you play with. There is no magic trick to finding a lobby other than queuing for a more populated server/playlist.
---
*grabby hands* I want it
---
Capitaos bolts have a gravity mechanic added to them, couldn't they just tweak that for bullets? Genuine question as I've got no idea how coding or game design actually works or how hard it could be to do something like bullet drop
---
Are u a wizard

Yea but if imma anchor I wanna anchor with a rly good anchor not a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù anchor
---
Everybody gangsta til the Jager start flyin‚Äô

No edition comes with base operators now

Just a friendly neighborhood game of tag

This isn‚Äòt a problem
---
Copper six stop crying over spawn peek 
---
He was at two health.
---
Its supposed to give you first 20
---
I bought them all with renown, I think they did that on purpose because there's a trophy on PS4 you can get for unlocking all the ops but idk, just a guess.

You CAN start worrying about grenades now

Not anymore. The system was changed on February 12^th

Because this game might as well be Far Cry online. 5 stacks vs 5 solos, coppers teaming up with plats, 9 ping vs 250 ping. Clueless.

So you're a scumbag smurf and a scumbag cav leaver.

Fuck you're just a total piece of shit. Do you need to farm lowbies for the clips you post?

Build a team off of LFG sites. Find teammates you work well with, and go from there.

Wow lol you get kicked for doing well, and for when you do poorly. It's a real Goldilocks situation.
---
Thanks so much i could not find this info for the life of me, oh and love your videos:D
---
100 brightness is nothing. It's just night maps are annoying to play on. As a defender you can't see outside and if you can it is barely. Playing a high brightness would not do anything. For example the Halloween event. I tried putting my brightness up but you couldn't see anything. So your solution is useless
---
Hans! Ho ho, look! Am the plane!
---
They never look above 
---
Oh, you are in J√§ger Himself's video ?
---
Nice, well played mate haha
---
The only issue with that is whenever ubi or the console people put out an update that prevents mouse and keyboard, the makers of the m&amp;k put out a patch that circumvents the update. It‚Äôs a game of cat and mouse 
---
I was saying put it on 100 because he said he had it on 80, shouldn‚Äôt even matter. I‚Äôm plat 2

Ah I see! Thanks again! Must have been someone else's camera.

It's casual

How? Do I just hold down the G button and wait a bit?

Haha it‚Äôs funny bcos were actually munition specialists in the AF
---
Or just do what this guy does and smurf for clips and leave when he gets dropped by cav due to her being too op.
---
Don't give advice, you're a fucking mongoloid.
---
It‚Äôs hard to avoid, they probably didn‚Äôt want you taking the #1 spot on the leaderboard. Just take it as a compliment of your talent and join another game, that‚Äôs what I always do.
---
I think they were low already at this point. Ash fell for my traps before entering.
---
That bot had better timing than me in my 500h in this fucking game
---
This season I swear it‚Äôs either a 4-0 or a 0-4 i‚Äôll probably just quit for csgo
---
Idc if you are plat two. I'm also plat 2 but when playing with friends that play on casual and want to relax they are constantly complaining about night maps. Maybe if you lower your ego and look at the lower levels then you might understand
---
I see that sneaky recruit.
---
How so?
---
I was replying to the other bloke asking what rank I was, wasn‚Äôt my ego but okay. 
---
MMR is in decimals, so it might be that there‚Äôs a small overlap in the rounding of the display number and the actual rank req that you happened to have hit?
---
This is an easy fix by truncation instead of rounding. 
---
I had one of those guys message me, they never actually used my cilp...
