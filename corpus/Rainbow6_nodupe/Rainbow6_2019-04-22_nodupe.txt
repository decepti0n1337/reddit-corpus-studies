We were once playing strat roulette and we won with 0 kills because the enemy kept killing the hostage

They had us in the first half, I'm not gonna lie.

Maybe make the change from white-blue-black less dramatic but it looks great!

I would black ice my car

Fun Fact 69420#: If tachanka is on the left of Vigil on the select screen it will look like God is so muscular that he invaded Vigil's space
---
Because people don‚Äôt blow the thermite charge while sitting in the closet with no cover, an impact is less important than a c4, taking a small amount of damage isn‚Äôt a big deal at the cost of taking out key utility, thermite has 2 charges, there are more operators with impacts than c4,  often times people push from the front door to upstairs so they‚Äôd destroy your c4 in the process, if you‚Äôve shock wired or kaid‚Äôd the wall the enemy team is gonna emp nade the area, and running downstairs to preplace a c4 can be a valuable waste of prep phase especially for operators with lots of prep phase tasks like Valk or Kapkan
---
why did they discontinue black ice after operation black ice?
---
yup
---
I'm really happy that the mods didn't delete this
---
Do you know now ?
---
Yes, thankfully
---
Mav or Jackal

I was playing since the start as well with about a two season break before Velvet Shell. Feel free to disagree. But in my personal opinion he was decent only needing minor tweaks right before the speed buff. He was a good op when used well, but most people just didn't use him properly. The speed buff broke him, and now he'll continue to suffer because Ubi instead of reverting the change, decided to cripple him in other aspects and will continue to do so until he is considered trash again.
---

---
I find that extremely disappointing, since I have been maining him for a long, long time.
---
When the fuck did downvotes mean anything
---
Nice work!

First of all, you can explode the c4 while they are placing the charge, and you don't have to pre place a c4, you can use a valk cam, mozzie drone or pulse scanner to see when they are putting the charge , throw the c4 and kill them
---
me like
---
You can stop worrying about grenades now
---
Black ice or something else? Sounds really cool and I can‚Äôt believe I missed it
---
I‚Äôve understood that if you place it right Trax will deploy where the player stands. But either way, even with an invincible shield there will be plenty of ways to counter him
---
yeah black ice for all the new operators
---
Goodü§£
---
You can just impact trick from below but I dig
---
Since this was reddit.
---
I almost didn‚Äôt see the /s lol
---
Aw man, I'll have to check tomorrow. I had no idea about that ;-;
---
It was his combo with Lion and Finka that made him broken but Lion got hit by the nerf truck and Finka is barely picked and very hard to coordinate since Para Bellum
---
I like you you've got the right ideas here
---
Yes the skin looks trash but have you seen a single pro league set
---
If that came out I would nut
---
Still waiting for someone to black ice one of their guns irl
---
I have mixed feelings but if we're prioritizing maps that need to be taken out of ranked. I'd take Hereford out first anyday
---
Operation health...
---
*cries in blitz main*
---
Btw well edited have some silver

Yep, same thing happened to me https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bfl9id/so_this_game_breaking_exploit_is_a_thing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
too much hazzle tho and not many people know it.
---
There should have been a kick option in the first place when you click on someones name
---
Didn‚Äôt get it off reddit
---
Good shit
---
Maybe not as an operator, we might see them as a character in a short movie since ubi will make short movies like 'Nail and Scalpel'
---
Blood ice
---
It also explains why I can't put the 2019 invitational skin on the new ops guns, lol.
---
How?
---
Yeah I know it does. It's full but still contested. If the defender leaves than the attacker would win.
---
There's a new energy drink that came out a month or two ago meant to be for gamers, and from what I've heard, its really good.
---
I'd rock it for sure on operators like Maverick, Vigil, Ying where I don't have weapon skins and any ops I have to run a universal. And I'd love for shields to have it too, would look really nice imo.
---
We've seen it before therefore we kick it to the dirt.
---
yes you are the only one
---
I mean you could speculate that but how are you sure that they're actually doing that? Every game needs a an art department otherwise it would all start looking like something out of Garry's mod
---
Yes we would
---
People who want to exploit this glitch right now i bet.
---
Would love to watch how things play out and the reactions when both teams are doing this and once the team that gets double defense in ot is finally known.
---
Haven't seen or heard either, do you think you could find the name for me?
---
Frik üòÇ
---
I apologize for the annoying mic guy
---
That‚Äôs very true, but the BOSG 12.2 doesn‚Äôt get much attention due to the K1A which is a much better gun.
---
....whut
---
Just the ability to turn off one or two would be nice. 
---
Making the game more custom to our play-style would be nice. Also would give Ubi some more info on maps that are liked and disliked.
---
More like I'm the Cappy Tao.
---
This!
---
Love the camera shake lol
---
Nope I could see it
---
Not to mention hight wise he is the smallest in the game so far
---
Although the ACOG would be overpowered I think they need to buff the BOSG 12.2 somehow
---
Were you 5man?
---
Isn‚Äôt thunderbolt essentially mozzie?
---
OH DANG I DIDNT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT :0 YOU SMARTY
---
Ill be able to look within three days I think. Ill save this post, if I don't say anything by then just pm me
---
huh?
---
Give credit to the OP, this is a repost
---
K thanks
---
No but like the objective is fully secured
---
I think I played against the two guys with the tag a few days ago
---
I only choose kap/Frost on certain maps where I know exactly where I want my traps. Frost is never an issue and with kap I'm always back in obj reinforcing walls by the time the round starts. So also never an issue.
---
I do the same thing with but with irons angled and a flash hider. It's all you need
---
Yeah. I know it is. If the defender is in the room the objective cannot be secured.
---
Do Maverick‚Äôs M4 and AR
---
predictable
---
Eh, the whole gradient should be moved back a little, the rear is too dark and the front is too light.

Deflected the grenade back at buck

That's really shitty yet really well done so idk what to say, I mean I can't do any better that's for sure but just saying I would rather black ice. Don't let this comment disway you from Photoshop. I can't Photoshop for shit shit so what do I know?

Eh, the rear is too dark and the front is too light.

omfg hahahahahahahha

Yes

Do it support my fellow recruit mains üòÇ
---
Np
---
YES BUT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH IT WAS SECURED BEFORE THE DEFENDER ENTERED THE ROOM
---
Jackal needs no rework, but I believe completely removing the scanner toggle and permanently leaving the footprints on the ground in exchange for dropping his trackals to 2 would be great. I want to ACTUALLY use Jackal in that detective role without having a dark purple tint and being basically required to trackal, only to then immediately turn the visor off. Some of the most fun moments with Jackal are stealthily following footstep paths without pinging, and I feel as though the image distortion when receiving damage and the purple tint actively deter you from using him that way.
---
- Ditch purple tint
---
- Ditch scanner toggle
---
- Reduce Jackal tracks to 2
---
He would feel less ‚Äúcancer,‚Äù with reduced ping spam, so more fun to play against and as.
---
[removed]
---
Is there not just a key I press to do it?

i mean ubi r never specific

that will never happen. they will always balance the game to pro league and high ranks as they should

Lmao, I got it on my first free alpha pack.
---
Please don‚Äôt do this to us it will make us want more then we will be to far and we can‚Äôt come back
---
What did you use?
---
Maybe Sony and Microsoft can work with them on a way to fix this?
---
There is unfortunately not much they can do, it would be a constant cat and mouse game between Ubi patching adapters then the adapter company patches that patch to go through again.
---
Reporting wise they have no hard evidence, they see a controller input due to the adapter, so they technically can‚Äôt issue a ban.
---
Sony &amp; Microsoft would have to enable full native MnK support &amp; constantly patch adapters to support the games that ban MnK.
---
They still have a very limited fire rate and ammo, so I don't think it would be anything like the micro smgs.
---
üòÇshe just disappeared

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúwanting to win‚Äù

Very true, it develops bad habits over time. Only good for snap aiming.
---
It occurred to me it was Lesion so I went in with a Twitch drone, but Consulate was way too big, I couldn‚Äôt do it in time.
---
Back in my prime, I got 5 aces in one game, still lost.
---
Yeah
---
Ahhh okay, makes more sense now. They also played Mute so we couldn‚Äôt see what was going on..
---
I thought black ice was for all weapons just really rare. Is it only made for ops made before and during when frost and buck came?
---
Gadgets should never in my opinion. Be based around mass damage of enemies. We have about what? 5 operators based on damaging? And of those 5, 4 are defenders, 3 of those 4 are trap based. So let's remove the trap based operators and the defenders and look at Fuze. The only operator with a gadget made for mass destruction and damage. He's, not in a good spot, his pucks are very avoidable and he struggles keeping up with his teammates. So how do you think another attacker based on mass damage would go? Even with Fuze having some of the best weapons in the game, he's still a joke, so how do you think this would go?
---
I got on the first pack after buying the rest of the 25 packs, I had 23 packs left, I bought it all, and guess what? It was the first pack that I opened
---
I sadly didn't have them. :(
---
Just like all other comments on this post, this is true. But this one, this one is the most true
---
Getting hit in the shoulder
---
Yeah. Call it blood ice. Put it in alpha packs. Boom. Or if they do another operation health that could be the seasonal skin or part of a special event. If memory serves black ice was a seasonal skin in one of the early seasons.
---
I've shot mosins in real life they take a while to reach their target but hit like a truck
---
I think you can change it on r6 from either Japanese, Russian or English(might be wrong on the languages) in the menu

Can we get a preview of the the tcsg12 in black ice?
---
i can atest this is true
---
I do well with her if I use the LMG or rush with the shotgun, but her Spear is terrible.
---
I didn‚Äôt get it off reddit and that didn‚Äôt make it and when did i claim it to be mine?
---
I play on ps4. They had to be op.
---
I have done worse so idk if I can say anything. I once had a teammate who got caved one (if that makes sense, I'm to lazy to spell today) and I was running away, and flicked on the 2ppl shooting me and it looked like I was using aimbot
---
Yep
---
Pretty much every clip we see from console players here are like this but sure.
---
I didn‚Äôt get it off reddit
---
maybe, but don't know if sony/microsoft even care
---
But none of guns match!

First on a repost, then talked about how we're all idiots, now here.

Nah fam that guns been Taken.

Geez, that is quite frigid

The

The .44 Mag had ZERO recoil, and 74 damage, Nomad's airjab used to be like Zofia Concussions, but got nerfed to Ela Ice Cream Cones, and Kaid had 3 claws, but got one taken away
---
Me like, aldo make the rework effect less and tweak damage
---
Idk what TF is wrong today, everything is going to shit for me, idk if this counts but
---
Been suggested several times before. General consensus is to not go AFK if you're no happy with who you get. After all you used to get recruit if you were AFK.
---
Agreed, people say it's better as it's more balanced, but in reality it sucks more balls than one of those ball shooters
---
Please dont talk again until you are atleast 7.
---
No
---
You‚Äôre an idiot how is having no credits in the title mean that i am claiming it to be my own and i didn‚Äôt find it on reddit it‚Äôs been sitting on my camera roll since last monday. Makes you feel stupid now doesn‚Äôt it?
---
God damn
---
Pardon??? Yes they do, Im pretty sure I have one.
---
Idk I have a video of me shooting clash with 10 rounds clearly never missing and she shoots me in the head once 3 seconds after I shot her. In the kill cam you can hear my bullets rip through her but she took zero damage and was at full health. I might post it later today. Btw it was not lag my ping never shot up and I had no indication in the top right
---
Tell that to that one game that I can‚Äôt remember the name off that changed the menu and a lot more people got toxic
---
Buy a mum
---
The standard Russian/French guns, sure. But not the Spear and the V308
---
Call PlayStation customer support. They can probably answer your question. If not, idk man that sucks.
---
This is true
---
Das hot
---
So what you're saying is that Lion and Finka have black ice?
---
No I wasted all my mirrors on my schools toilets
---
wowowow
---
Stop saying things like "get good" &amp; "stop crying" especially when you're not good. Even Pro players say shields are broken. On a team with better communication than you've ever seen in siege still loses to blitz, often enough for him to be a top 5 picked attacker in PL, there's a problem.
---
Montange and Fuze aren't the problem, blitz being able to sprint at you and get a free kill because he had his shield in front of his face is a problem.
---
Not their guns though
---
Drone in.. if its clear, drone it still, run characters that help the team,  attack- (thatcher, thermite, finka, lion, dokkabei, jackal) defense-  (doc, rook, mute, kapkan, lesion.) Try to get in a group of friends who know what they‚Äôre doing and have a set strategy for each round, plan it out before the round starts: where am i going to push? What am i going to breach? Who are the roamers? Etc. Hope this helps
---
lollll are you that dense? using someone else‚Äôs work in the real world and not giving credit is called ‚Äúplagiarism.‚Äù i know it‚Äôs a big word and you probably won‚Äôt learn. what it means until you get to the 5th grade but that‚Äôs what it is. nobody cares how long you‚Äôve had it on your camera roll. you didn‚Äôt make it. you reposted it. now get lost
---
LUL

Thanks man

What do you mean not their guns? Who elses guns would it be?
---
Watch get flanked on YouTube. He gives good tips. Also play with 2/3+ people with mics constantly
---
Makes sense
---
The guns only they have. No one else has the V308 or the Spear
---
Yeah good lord you outlined him. I‚Äôm empathetic to your struggle
---
Happy Easter!
---
Yes, but they still have black ice...
---
&gt;grill your balls
---
Yep, using that one
---
i see someone else already explained it to you. just because you didn‚Äôt get it off reddit doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a repost. it‚Äôs been posted here. it was on the front page. you didn‚Äôt make it. so get lost
---
Mx4 storm
---
If you're going to peak, do so quickly. Also never, on bombs, reinforce the wall/hatch that separates the rooms. You want that available for opening in case they move in to that one and not the other.
---
Did you not read what I said? I replied to you that they do and that I forgot about the standard weapons
---
I should‚Äôve included how I did it!! You can throw it from the door I ran out of. Put your cross hair above the top of the building and do a quick sprint throw. You can get it there without being spotted ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Can a nitro cell work cause you could use it to counter mavrick cutting with less risk and thermite trying to plant

Sweet!!! Happy easter

Nope. They have it, but not 100% if that makes sense. They have it for some guns, but not all of their guns

‚ÄúSprint at you‚Äù at 2 miles an hour with a shield you can usually shoot through. And he isn‚Äôt a top 5 pick in PL, get over yourself. He‚Äôd be lucky to get top 10 most seasons. He‚Äôs just not that good. It would be cool if you could stop lying to make yourself feel better about losing to a character that‚Äôs been pretty garbo ever since they nerfed his speed.
---
It did, which is why all of the games you went to were interrupted because the host disconnected
---
Get year 4 it‚Äôs much better in the long run especially if you are just going to eventually get all the year 4 ops eventually
---
Woah there no need to make us feel so in suffioer to u
---
Not just the seasonal skins, they had WW2 camos that were available for the first year for sure, most likely longer. Ubi "Vaulted" it and made them a rarity so now I have these "Legendary" skins even though they cost me peanuts years ago, the whole rarity system is a joke if what your saying is true. That would mean the most unpopular, least purchased skins would be the rarest.
---
Why did you delete your commen
---
Get the year 4 pass and Kaid. Zofia &amp; clash are fun and all but it‚Äôs definitely better to just grind them out and get the new operators a week early!
---
Also long did it take you to come up with all this
---
Yeah it's pretty cool, lots of cool ideas, I'm one of the mods. Yeah but I would pose the idea of balancing, like when you choose the dmr know you sacrifice rof for range and damage but the arrow gets rid of that giving him extremely powerful range potential. Also I definitely feel trading the 2 steel for another explosive would be a trade I make. Yeah lots of options are nice, but you don't want to make them so versatile that they are a must pick, so I would just be careful with balancing.
---
About one and a half hours
---
Hey u/_Emmett_, thanks for bringing this to our attention!
---
We‚Äôve been noticing these issues a lot too recently, and we‚Äôre looking into ways we can do it. There have been a few debates and even conflicts here in the office on how we can fix this, but we‚Äôve come up with a pretty elegant solution that we we‚Äôll be rolling out in the next TTS.
---
I‚Äôm super happy to announce that to fix this issue, we‚Äôll be nerfing Blackbeard. He‚Äôll no long have a shield. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention!

The best way to warn your friends

im dissapointed

The side step in disbelief showed your shock and awe ü§£ Nice shot

I‚Äôve been calling for a sensor alarm since chimera. It can work for both defenders and attackers. I‚Äôm a bit confused as to why ubi hasn‚Äôt given an operator this ability yet.
---
But skins in COD and CSGO are good tho, albeit csgo skins are expensive, but have you SEEN the weaponized and diamond camos on black ops 2, or the dark matter skin in bo3?
---
Yes lmao

I own the game on all platforms and I can easily say that PS4 is the most toxic, sucks that this happened to you

This is the only charm I want

It‚Äôs actually not on any uniform or headgear. It‚Äôs definitely not shit tier either. It‚Äôs still super rare and getting rarer. You see it so much because if somebody has it then they‚Äôll use it as a GUN SKIN. I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt play too much
---
I was aim training on that CS map a few hours ago, actually. It's amazing. You can control walls, obstacles, varying heights, headshots only, FPS boosts, make the bots run randomly, change the direction they're looking, change their armor, choose your weapon, even customize the scenery.

Who even plays inverted lmao

A funny thing about the internet is that I have no idea if you're being genuine right now

Yea I really wanted it when I first saw it months ago. I‚Äôm so hyped up that I got it

I bet it was a common duplicate

Shit as in good?

Not sure if you got wooshed or you wooshed me
---
It's because this community is terrible.  Unless I'm partied with someone under clearance level 60 it is nothing but sweaty golds, plats and diamonds, three quarters of which will quit the second they get killed.  Every third match has some toxic stack that you just have to pray is on the other team so you don't hear them screech a cacophony of slurs into their mics before spamming vote kicks, but at least I hopefully won't have to worry about tk's too much longer.  This is my CASUAL experience at almost every hour of the day, half of this game's multiplayer playlists (lol like there is an actual difference) are now borderline unplayable, the only real difference from ranked is that I might be mercifully set free from a match sooner.  And they don't want to actually police these people because it would be too much work for this poor indie dev.  That shitty racial slur text filter was the best we're ever going tot get.

They should count, but maybe because theyre new its a bug Ubi hasnt patched yet.
---
As someone who frequents the trading reddit for CS I thought that‚Äôs what it was at first
---
screaming yeet and killing all your teammates is better
---
I agree. They should have done a 2 or 3 second nerf first instead of a whole 5 seconds. This is the second Nerf I feel they've went to far the first time. First being lesions gu mines going from 8 damage to 4 (I think that's right?). I feel 6 would have been a good first test before dropping to 4.
---
I wouldn't doubt they did it on purpose. I agree though, I think whoever's alive should have the last vote.
---
Like your ps4 account got banned, or your R6 account got banned
---
Yea, and especially when it‚Äôs like 2-3 you still have a chance to come back

Even of it‚Äôs digital, no need to buy another copy on console you can activate your account as primary and use the games on other accounts so this guy is lol

Okay I‚Äôm regarded...also hey I dunno what TTV is. I just watched Dr. Disrespect playing and everyone in the chat screamed hacker and screen sniper when players named TTV... So calm your man tits. It‚Äôs not like I made this shit up.

Never thought of that, then again, the only other person I know who did this got banned for being Primary on too many consoles to share games xD Probavly why he rebought all his, no idea on OP now.

Mnhmm, let's go with hitbox rather than obviously omitted material that could be a part of the issue
---
Happy cake day!

Thank you!

When the objective is in the basement in that place. And when I‚Äôm Cav. I like barricading everything around the spiral stairs. I prepare to ounce when I hear someone break either 3. It‚Äôs just to delay them and give me time to know which way to start.
---
that sounds like fun lol my gt for xbox is up top (with the space included). i mostly just chill in casual so i can learn the maps, figure out call outs, and learn angles. if you wanna play sometime send me a message on xbox and let me know you came from here :D

Yea but then it cuts of rotations and possible flanks from either you or your teammates

It'll be a few days cause a communication ban cause someone reported me asking why they tked me

In this round. No one came up. So I man‚Äôd the stairs. Nothing more to say.

Nice comeback. Profound and well informed.

What blend mode are you using OP?

Votekick
---
Guess we don't play casual huh.
---
the problem beside what xiaoxiaoman92 said is also that you cant really practice much beside aim in T hunt, you can learn the map layout but you dont learn what to do and what not to do in different spots of the map because the terrorists are so bad its uncompareable to a real player, in t hunt you can just run past terrorists and not get shot at but that wont work in a real game
---
I didn‚Äôt realise there was audio until I read your comment. I thought he just dipped and was going to let them die which was equally as funny for me
---
Well, take the square root of how many times they try to shoot a hard wall over the average level squared, multiply by the fact that it has the word "new" in the title, then add the cube of how many shots it takes for them to destroy a drone.
---
Shit, all of this describes me.

Lesion talking about his bet with smoke

So, as a round ended yesterday, the game froze and I realised there was no end of round summary. However, the game wasn't hanged and after sitting out the (non-existant) operator select screen, I spawned into the round with no UI whatsoever except the chat. If you'll excuse my terrible gameplay and teammate-shooting, you can see that there were no teammate icons, site locations or even pings showing up at all. I'm not sure if anyone has experienced something similar, but I thought this would be interesting enough to share. As you can see, at the end of the round, the game just freezes (till the next round starts). This persisted throughout the rest of the game where afterward I had to restart the game as I could not exit the match.
---
The situations are just training, it goes over that I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
*record scratch*
---
 ‚Äúyep that‚Äôs me, I bet you‚Äôre wondering how I got here. Well it all started when the enemy team picked an operator with no hit box‚Äù
---
Welp it‚Äôs going according to plan feed me careless ash and twitch mains
---
I did have t activated as primary but when your perma banned, ps in activates it. It‚Äôs a dick move and I have but back 175 games
---
It‚Äôs about my luck on the skin I got, aka horrible
---
But how could you get bored? You would have all ops, tons of different play options and tons of different strategy options.
---
There was a time when they fixed that? Ever since I started to play in Blood Orchid, the debris always stayed in the barricade when I hit it. Always had to double hit that to get it out of the way...
---
Ubi saw how op recruit is. As a result they are removing blackbeards shields to balance the game

Maybe one day you'll get your own ops, hope so then 1v1's get more interesting if you know what I mean, but still gridlock is probs the second best 3 armour attacker in the game

Please get this noticed. I‚Äôd kill for this mode.

well done soldier

You made this?

I made this

You know you could simply kill Pulse through the elevator gap?

Surprise motherfucker
---
Yea, if they continue to 100 ops, hopefully NZ will get atleast 1 lol
---
Thank you very much for the feedback, really appreciate it! Now that I think about it, you are completely right. I thought it was a ragequit at first since he was "joking?" that he was sad because he was naded by recruit.
---
It was a joke because of how stupid this was lol
---
... are you me?
---
Problem there is they are not banning anyone Frommheit one or two reports. So many people are just eating the shit and get on with their life. NO. Report them, once enough reports are there, MS will look into them, best if you also record and upload them and mention that in your reports. If enough people do that, MS will eventually ban them.
---
I think cheat engine does this, where you can have unlimited time and unlimited gadgets, It's very helpful if you want to learn valk setups, etc. Haven't tried it personally though as it said you need to disable battle eye for it to work.

No don't get rid of the debris, that's crucial information and a part of the game.  Just don't make it act stupid like in the video, let if fall away cleanly, but not disappear completely.

I just learned that the bullets fire slightly above the sight which I didn't know. No need to be a toxic cuck

The good ol' times.
---
alright? you posted this here complaining about the game and didn‚Äôt even bother to look for yourself to see you missed. did you expect everyone to be nice about it?
---
Put it in alpha packs and make every one legendary. That way everyone feels the need to purchase more alpha packs since you cant save renown for it and it takes insane luck and real money! You‚Äôre welcome ubi
---
I literally just said I just learned that the bullets fire above the sight. I did not know that before I posted the clip.
---
Really cool, it looks like blood
---
Oh yeah I got double fuckes by shit like this yesterday. Not only from my point of view was the barricade unbroken but I also had my shield up. Deathcam confirmed this.
---
Except this way you already have all your ops, all your skins, etc, etc.. Regional ranks make smurfing way too convenient. With global ranks they'd HAVE to have a smurf, unlock all the ops, etc. The sheer annoyance of it would drastically reduce how much it hapoens.
---
90% of t hunt matches I do this happens. Like really man, I‚Äôm just trying to get a challenge out of the way or learn how to use a new op. Feck off
---
Well it would be easy as fuck to fix this shit. It‚Äôs called not letting the client side part of the barricade come in contact with the rest of it, so it would fall right through it, or you could make those pieces slightly bigger so there‚Äôs more pressure when it‚Äôs pushed out.
---
You can't just "remove" it...
---
As toxic and OP as it was, god damn those were fun days.
---
i remember when i played in gold and people used to try to bandit trick there. same concept i guess. gonna have a bad time.
---
What does "my first attempt at digital art ever" mean? You're saying that you got the software and learned how to functionally do each technique (brush choice, lines, gradients, etc) with it on *this* piece?
---
So when a teammate TKs me I have to stay in the match? Even when their friend TKs me again in the next round? Otherwise I get a minus point? Just because I don‚Äôt want to get TKd and then watch those idiots playing? Plus why should I spend any amount of time in an already list match? I don‚Äôt want to watch them loose another round and then spend another 4 minutes just to loose the match. I also don‚Äôt want to stay in a match where my team kills the hostage. There should be a major penalty for TK and killing the hostage. Yeah there are accidents, but if you don‚Äôt shoot those drones like an idiot and you don‚Äôt stand int the line of sight of your teammate, then there should be no problem. And I just cannot believe Ubisoft still couldn‚Äôt make an algorithm against TKs that could tell the difference between accidents and deliberate killings. Don‚Äôt tell me that TKs, specially headshots in the first 2 seconds of the round are accidents. The only solution if Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt make that algorithm is a major penalty even in casuals. Plus there should be an instant vote on every TKs: if the rest of the team says (including the player TKd) it was an accident, the player should stay in the game, but there could be a very short time limit to vote (5s or so), if the vote is unanimous or they say it was deliberate, the player should be kicked out immedietaly and punished with some major penalty. So the vote should be about keeping the player in the match and not about kicking out. This way even when there are 4 friends who just wants to kill the 5th they couldn‚Äôt keep each other in the game because the TKd fifth would vote to kick.

The post that had this I was the first one to say blood ice

Meh, stats do not matter in this game. All they do is pushing your ego and distracting you from actually gettings things done.
---
Feels bad man...
---
[you sure about that?](https://imgur.com/gallery/y4U7co4)
---
I don't get it
---
Exactly, that's why we need to make it count, people quit and take 3 minutes to get back, time that they could use to give callouts or select an operator. Sometimes they can't even rejoin, gu king the entire squad. It's also bothersome when you are making a mission and can't get the kill because of the quitter.
---
OMG that makes me feel so uncomfortable
---
It be like that sometimes chief
---
Lesion or Thermite/Maverick
---
Thx
---
I am sorry Macie =[

You should play ranked when you feel like playing it. Get yourself 2-4 ops you wanna play, learn the ranked maps via T-hunt and you are good to go. Trust me when I say that you will not improve by sticking to Casual. I mean it's nice to get a tiny bit of a feeling for the game, but usually Casual matches tend to be chaotic and therefore nothing like R6 at all.
---
BROKEN

Happy cake day

Ranked is less toxic, so, there's that.

I'm very happy üòä
---
The game is won when it says you have won and not when you have like 20 kills 0 deaths but still lost the round/game. Your KD means absolutely nothing. Nobodys KD does.  As I said, it only distracts you from playing the objective.
---
In a perfect world yes. But having that level of destruction across the whole map all run by the server would be impossible unless the game was 50x bigger than it is. The servers simply couldn't handle the calculations without sacrificing performance in other areas (hit reg most importantly). However there is no reason why things like this should happen regardless. Barricade debris should NOT be able to stay in place after being broken. It should always fall to the ground, if it's not touching the ground get rid of it. I know that's not a simple matter despite sounding like it, but it's an important part of the game. Hopefully it gets addressed this year but I'm not expecting it.

The Cut off Du ma at the end after both Mira‚Äôs taken down was priceless. Hahaha

I've played against Beaulo/Varsity before. Its just that I don't care. They're just people playing the game like you or I. Its really not that big of a deal or at least I don't understand why people make it out to be a big deal. All you're doing is being obnoxious towards another person/player because they're successful at it.
---
Thanks mate, much appreciated

I can imagine, hopefully they don‚Äôt have a Jager and I‚Äôll keep this in mind for my next game on Club House

Can your grenade disable fooking laser sights? That‚Äôs what i thought

no problem always feels nice when i atleast try to help people

Wich language is that? Btw thanks for showing that!
---
I personally like Marley becuase of the good gameplay mixed with memes. Whoever told you that you can't have both is seriously wrong.
---
I knew she was just pretending she knew what she was doing
---
The main reason I ask is as stated I've had some people tell me when I make my own content I can't have both it should just be one or the other. I try to mix it up but y'know.
---
You told me this already, and do you remember my response?
---
Damn you a cool guy
---
thanks lol

That's what I thought but I just wanted to get an opinion from more people instead of close friends who's opinions maybe biased since they're featured in my stuff.

That is really cool you played against them. I was just really startled when I played against him and killed him twice and made him ‚Äúrage quit‚Äù as recruit. It was just fun, I really like Macie
---
To add to this, we will also be removing Glaz‚Äôs scope on his sniper as well as removing Caviera‚Äôs pistol to compensate. Thanks
---
Fuck
---
Fuck..
---
They could have the debris get smaller and disappear after a bit or add more horizontal momentum when destroyed but this should be fixed.
---
And you don't even have to reinstall the game
---
Lmao sorry bout that, you'll get better with time
---
I only play house anyways lol
---
I‚Äôd say all of them but as of late for me I‚Äôd say Lion, Capit√£o, Mozzie, Smoke, Gridlock, and Clash. Been doing outrageously well with Clash for some reason lol.
---
don't need to be good to play ranked, the whole point of it is getting matches similar to your skill. you'll get better over time if you want to improve.
---
lol
---
But... you *didn't* make him rage quit. He left to save time to queue into another game. When he got downed the Vigil died and only Alibi was left in a 1v3. Why stick around knowing the round is most likely lost? Nobody does that. Unless you're desperate for Renown.
---
means i'm saving the post or something. If a new reply is made i'll be notified by it.

The sweet sound of a thousand Mira mains shrieking in agony is assaulting my eardrums now.
---
&gt; humble enough to take the L
---
he quit when he got downed lmao.  I don't even play this game anymore or have a dog in this fight, but he definitely didn't "take the L"
---
It goes through walls and the proximity is much larger than a grenade. Like with reinforced walls that have a bandit or kaid charge on them, all you do is throw the EMP on the outside of the wall and it disables them so thermite or hibana can breach it. Hopefully this helps. He is a really useful op.
---
Varsity gaming is goood and his solo smurf series is fun to watch ( no memes)
---
I need this for a certain defence main
---
&gt;can take down a whole team 
---
Maybe a team of silvers....
---
&gt;he‚Äôs broken 
---
He has limited range, his flash has limited range, he has limited ammo, his shoulder and feet are always open, when he sprints he exposed himself even more, and there‚Äôs 2 hard counters for him on defense (smoke/lesion). Theres also  plenty of other operators that can be used to slow him down and expose him for cross fire 
---
Blitz is good in 1v1 fights at close range and that‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs at a massive disadvantage in literally any other engagement or against multiple people. It‚Äôs laughable you consider him broken when he doesn‚Äôt make a blip on the radar
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs actually 100000 iq
---
No it isn't
---
Xurbdic/tuxbird is pretty good, he tends to not take the game too seriously but still displays good strategy and good jokes
---
Yeah we can all be better people to each other. Toxicity has no place in this awesome game and community.
---
Same i had no clue

I know I didn‚Äôt this is why I surrounded the words rage quit with ‚Äú‚Äù. As others have stated he left to save time. I just did not see that at that time

You are most welcome kind sir

Pro League is good for developing strats, murder holes, lines of sight, tricks etc.., a shame that it is so conservative and doesnt introduce new maps.

Smh my head, what a noob calling out the truly skilled player cause he is bad, smh my head
---
Honestly can‚Äôt wait for this season. Kafe will finally be Viable outside of Mining/Campfire Bomb-sites. The new toxicity system will be in place. Pick and Ban will come to rank with hopefully more changes to rank (hopefully being fair matchmaking because getting qued up against plats when you‚Äôre gold isn‚Äôt fun). Glaz will get his rework and will finally be a sniper like he was meant to be and not be a pusher. The deployable shield might get its rework. And finally the new ops which, if the leaks are correct, are gonna be a great addition to this game and it‚Äôs current meta. 
---
Next season will be a game changer in terms of Ranked, Toxicity, and Balancing. I have my highest hopes that Ubisoft can provide another great season since as of last patch they proved they can rework operators such as Lion without butchering them and make mediocre ops like Capit√£o into a good solid role for Area denial like he was intended.
---
THe Hell happened to Hereford base? Did it get overhauled? I haven‚Äôt played in over a year.
---
Yeah, and that's ridiculous, but a secret Very Very illegal organization like Team Rainbow should not be making themselves known through a logo.
---
For a game with such high player numbers like Siege, this would be the last of my concerns. I'd rather wait 2 minutes for a fair game with all players being at my rank compared to the what, 30-45 seconds normal Ranked queue times? Games with much smaller player bases would need to worry about this but definitely not Siege.
---
Your argument is "she's made to make her teammates break stuff for her and break drones of character that not a ton of people play". My argument is that she should be viable on her own.
---
Ya, and why should we have to suffer on some of the newer maps that aren‚Äôt so great. I understand the pros play them in ranked themselves but I‚Äôm just kind of irritated about it
---
Bandit, i heard something about a cav eliteskin
---
but that's happening rn too so...
---
honestly they should give her two mines and either correct her recoil or give her a damage bump, her shit is terrible rn.
---
But poor Tachanka...
---
it got nerfed, and people found new thing to abuse. CQE
---
Living and learning
---
But a group of solos versus a 5 stack is better? That's what currently is allowed to happen today and it's awful. I suggested Siege follow the Dota 2 party matchmaking and the way they handle this is by having a 2 stack and 3 stack on a team vs another 2 and 3 stack or just having 5 stacks only get matched with other 5 stacks. That way you never have either team with just a small 2 or 3 stack + solos against a full 5 stack.
---
that was kinda the point of op health
---
As a Kaid main, the AUG imo is now a better option than the shotgun. Dont get me wrong, the shotgun is still great and is one of the most fung guns to use in the game, but the pistol does the same job for me and with the AUG, I'm no longer screwed with close encounters
---
R/delusionalartists

I remember the first week Hereford was out the subreddit had plenty of posts pointing out this drone hole.  
---
It wasn‚Äôt unknown for long at all.
---
This map was removed a year ago.
---
 If your going to upload clips to join the anti Ubi circle jerk at least try something from this season. An event that occurred over a year ago isn't representative of the current state of the game.

* The same problem that came up when RFF was first pushed on test servers. If players know that they are safe as long as they stay below a certain threshold, they'll abuse this fact to deal maximum damage and still be safe.
---
* Toxic actions that do not result in point loss. Text/voice chat abuse, bodyblocking doorways, shooting drones to deny allied Mozzie, etc. How to deal with that?
---
Alright thanks for trying!üòÅ
---
Haha the Mira probably thinking you‚Äôre a cheating asshole
---
Welcome
---
You can submit a ticket but you need video evidence.
---
i get that some of the weapons shouldn't have it, like smokes smg, and i know the weapons are still strong but i think that the mp5 hasn't made a difference, with or without the acog, and hey, maybe you just perform better with different sights.
---
so more or less wrist aim mostly but arm aim for tuning around?
---
Outstanding move.
---
I like the idea of her, but her gadget, secondary gadgets, and weapons right now are just so underwhelming.
---
Erm what
---
Console only
---
hahahahaha
---
recent*, not sure how that happened
---
Well the thing with nomad is it's not always about kills, but if you wanna get kills specifically with her then you have to use her aggressively, that is, when you find where someone is, shoot an airjab to try and push them out, or try to bait them by engaging in a fight but place the airjab where they would need to push. 
---
Lion just got reworked and is most likely going to be unbanned in pro league when the burnt horizon ops are added to pro league (theres a buffer time) so hes not considered as OP anymore, but right now a lot if people are underestimating him so yeah.
---
Zofia actually has two types of grenades in her launcher, two concussion grenades and two impact grenades which are designated by their symbol and are switched like select fire option. The concussions have a special trait of activating if an enemy is near so if you shoot them in a room and they go off immediately, there is an enemy right there. If they bounce around and such, then there isnt an enemy in the radius it detects, but it will still concuss someone if they are close enough. The impacts are good for breaching fast and making lines of sight but both types are caught by jager ads so be careful. She has claymores and breaching charges and taking either depends usually on the map. Breaching charges in general (for any op) are good to bring if attacking a downstairs obj with soft ceilings, where claymores can be useful for more upstairs objs and on tighter maps. Zofia has an AR and LMG, both being good but I prefer the AR.
---
If you are definitely trying for more kills, then I would recommend Capitao, with the recent change to his fire bolts hes really strong, and is good at pushing people out of corners and getting the kill. I like his AR for reload speed, but the LMG has the new sight and that's what the pros use. 
---
But overall like I said before something to keep in mind is that if you want "more" kills, then you need to bring the fight to the enemy, and need to force the mistake rather than wait for the mistake. This doesnt mean blind rush, but as you play more you'll see that people tend to run similar setups and you can usually bet where some of the anchors will be and you can try to push hard and get them by surprise. My best advice though is to just play loose. If you are purposely trying to go for kills, you'll probably get sloppy, it's nothing to do with skill or anything it's just you'll probably become very focused on that and not paying attention to your surroundings. That being said, if you play ranked, or plan on playing ranked this mentality leads to the most important mentality of all in siege, the objective of the game is to win, it doesnt matter how many kills you get, as long as you win. So, play the objective, if its bomb, try not to let them plant, if its secure, know when the obj is being pushed and you need to go back, hostage, know when they have the hostage, regardless, dont get kill hungry. Also if you are in a 1 v something, or even in general, if you are fighting multiple people, and you are really trying to win, dont go for the downed kill. Too many times have I seen people throw away a clutch because they wanted the kill instead of just aiming where they were to get the next kill. Those kills dont matter if you lose on a 2-3 round that would have forced overtime, so play the objective. Hope that helps.

I got into Siege literally a week ago and Ela is my favorite character. Tbh, I find her first 5 shots to be lazers. I think shes very effective, I wish I could‚Äôve seen what she was like back when.
---
Honestly just sat with my head in my hands after that round
---
just saying that the acog doesn't have to be removed from everyone, which is the way this is going
---
One word Ubisoft
---
Of course! I‚Äôll friend you and we‚Äôll talk sometime

Yeah, that‚Äôs some crazy shit
---
You haven't played since yesterday. You feeling ok?

Download the xbox app on your phone, you can save the capture clips from xbox onto your gallery and upload them anywhere.
---
I've played R6:S and I have no idea what's happening here, can someone ELI5?
---
I don‚Äôt think it is, and if it is it doesn‚Äôt matter because sights are all preference
---
i thought for a sec you meant the tv
---
In blitz, if you shoot before the aiming down animation is done, the bullet will shoot like if you shot it from the hip.  Most people who use blitz, at least shoot once while the aiming animation is done, so that's what happen to you, blitz shot before the aiming down sight animation is done, and you got lucky that the random bullet spread to hit you.
---
I didn't know it was that bad. When is this going to be implemented?

I know, still not diamond

Ok, what about it

What if you‚Äôre a twitch main on attacking and a Mira main in defense

Find another game. I left r6 and I became much happier. Still visit Reddit sometimes to see what's new ( and there is nothing)
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wanting a rework
---
I don't have any sadly.
---
May I ask if that's your actual ranked or did you just throw
---
Wait a minute... attackers can take Rook's armor?
---
lol was about to give him shit for not crediting coconut brah...
---
That's the joke
---
it's where you damage the hostage so he has like 4 hp and lesion throws a gu at him then leaves, it then says that you have to prevent revive even it could still be prep phase
---
ranked is less toxic than casual most of the time. just try to ostay out of copper for the queue times and all the people who throw for fun are down there
---
Honestly, at this point, I would take anything to increase legendary/epic drops. It's pathetic to open 500 alpha packs and get 4 legendary items and 3 of them were dupes. Maybe got 15 epics and they were mostly garbage.
---
Can i see some proof?
---
What I meant about the "initial nerf" was the big one in Chimera which put her in her current state. Ever since Burnt Horizon her horizontal recoil has been reduced greatly and her vertical recoil slightly, comparable to the SMG-11. The damage is just so bad that you have to catch someone by suprise to bodyshot them to death. 
---
She's in a good spot right now, she just needs some slight improvements and she'll be a fairly balanced op. Giving her a shield made no sense, she is not suited for anchoring. Giving her impacts back would make her a good roamer, as most three speeds should be, and put her in a more comfortable state similar to bandit or alibi.
---
why post this twice
---
Yes, i originally made the model for a college assignment, so it still have the vector's regular folding stock, i'm planning on modelling the magpul stock later
---
Ofc
---
It's good bit I swear to God if we are doing this again. Remember the block creations?
---
Love how you never say platform
---
i would say certainly, i started ranked as soon as i hit lvl 20 and can physically not go back to casual when i have time for a ranked because of how much better it is.
---
When its easier and much better to just stand and watch the stairs and put other to watch tower stairs.....
---
Bro the amount of commons I get is so high! And if/when and Epic/Legendary drops it‚Äôs a dupe..

So you probably have the same thing that happened to me 6 months ago. I ordered 16,000 and waited 3 days as the charge was pending in my bank account. UBI Support said the charge didn't go through and that it would release back into my bank account in a few days. So I wet ahead and purchased 16000 more and those hit right away. Two days later I noticed I had 30,000 credits and was like WTF!? It eventually went through. No clue why that one purchase took almost 5 days, but it did.
---
Wow. What a useful use of ur time. Impressive tho
---
No bc year 2 had gold medallions y3 had tags and this year is skins. I like it bc I'm lvl 247 with 300+ charms and it's a bitch to sort through
---
More Solo content: Yes Please
---
Refund: Uh no just wait until the discount yourself or pay the extra to get it early. 
---
Realism: Yea it has kinda gone towards strange sci-fi stuff but there‚Äôs only so much you can do without branching out more. I think the alternative is to stop making new ops but that‚Äôd make people mad.
---
You really shouldnt post this stuff because then people will use it and it's not good for the game, just report it to ubi and continue on.

Yeah he stood on box
---
House is a great map for fun, should never be reworked for ranked or anything. It's basically siege's 1v1 arena al le nuketown and rust from cod. 
---
Tactical realism is again fun for messing around but the game is fine how it is as tactical realism is not very noob friendly.
---
Hostage was intended to be the pro scene game mode but didnt take off, while I originally played secure the area a lot, in the last few seasons I have switch to mostly bomb only, because that's what the operators are mostly geared towards and theres a lot more options in bomb for setups and attacks. Hostage is a fun game mode to mess around in but they should probably not allow it in ranked. I think secure should stay for now because it is a fun and relatively competitive game mode, but hostage just has a lot of bullshit to it.
---
I mean technically I didn‚Äôt take as long as possible so you‚Äôre wrong there. Then when we talk about skill and finesse I never claimed to be good at the game I played causal for fun I‚Äôm not a try hard which is what I assume all the angry people are on this post. But express away
---
The more you can bait jackal into tracking you, the better it is for your team. Bring the shotgun to blow out escape routes- hatches, soft walls to rotate through.
---
There was a video on the front page a few months ago.   
---
If I remember correctly, he placed his deplorable shield next to the box and stood on the box.  He walked to wards the wall on top of the shield and placed the Mira window before the shield broke.  Then standing on the boxes you can crouch and you‚Äôre almost entirely protected while looking through the lower Mira window and then open the top one to shoot out of.  Works pretty well because it‚Äôs super hard to angle a grenade or Capit√£o bolt through the hatch.
---
You can't even buy alpha packs with real money though.
---
Holy shit you couldn't at least try with the title? How are you expecting a serious response when you spell like that?

Ubi saw ur coment and to buff blackbeard theyll remove the shields, hope helps balancing the game xd

What I was trying to say is it doesn‚Äôt match well with most all uniforms and headgears. It just stands out and looks ugly
---
My issue with the refund was not that they did it, but that they didn‚Äôt tell us they were going to do it until too late. If I had known the operators would have been marketed this way, then I would have used my renown differently. As it stands, they only announced it pretty recently, meaning the damage is done and the renown has already been spent. That‚Äôs what pisses me off, and that‚Äôs what I think we should get a refund for. But otherwise I agree ^_^

Just did a sketchup project for a class and my professor wouldn‚Äôt let me do a siege building!!! Super jealous

Someone who has played siege for more than 2-3 hours gets a fair idea of what the base ops do. I wasn't rude to the guy, just stating the obvious. And it's definitely a circlejerk regulated by dimwits who don't have individual opinions nor can respect any.

I actually don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs THAT bad. The bottom line is I believe EVERYTHING should be obtainable trough in-game currency. Price Elite Skins at 150,000 renown I don‚Äôt care... I just want to be able to access aspects of the game that are locked off by a pay wall. There are many good live services, and R6 definitely has one of the better ones, but there‚Äôs still room for improvement with it.

If someone who gets team killed because they ran in front of someone who was firing, didn't watch the kill cam and then team kills you next round, they're just toxic in general. That's why I always watch my death cams and tell my mates to as well to see if it was intentional.

I haven‚Äôt played the update so I haven‚Äôt seen how good he is

Yes, but your playstation can detect the adaptor easily, meaning Sony could stop all adapters from working if they wanted no problem. They choose not to for the reason listed above
---
When I said it makes them money, its just that them allowing the adapters means players who want or need the adapter won't quit if Sony/Microsoft allow them to use it
---
I had the exact thing happen to me man
---
Yes, except chanka, yes, capitao can deny the Mira on oregon basement, bank basement, clubhouse cat walk

Castle for skyscraper, and slows down the enemy and makes them waste utility
---
40000 IQ
---
Recurit is below average. There are no attachments for weapons and far more limited utility. Doesnt matter how good you are at shooting/aiming your still putting yourself at a disadvantage picking recruit.
---
I saw MacieJay do something similar to this and everytime I play Herefold Base I go up there and can't find this exact drone hole.
---
They need to make it so the pieces disappear from oblivion, or they teleport to the floor.
---
a bolt action would be so fun

I'm silver but I have a good understanding of how this have works, your rank doesn't always determine that.

Nah silver at most

all smgs are and its quite annoying. I main Echo and when I run out of ammo in my MP5 I just take my fate and stand there because I won't kill them with the bearing-9.

Recruit: im here for a good time not a long time
---
You are correct. I own a CZ Scorpion in real life (faux suppressor variant) and it has incredibly soft recoil. Even if I mag dumped 30 rounds as fast as I can, the recoil is almost non existent. I plan on getting a Binary Trigger for her because why not, the gun is amazing. Excessive whining ruined her, she was nowhere close to pre nerf Blackbeard.
---
Siege is weird in that a 9mm MK1 does more damage than a 5.56 C8. I understand for balancing but it really bothers me so much.
---
He isn't useless. Your playstyle with him is the problem. He has survived gunfights against me because he can tank the 2 shots before his shield breaks and in a straight up gun fight, it's still very useful despite his shield being nerfed repeatedly.
---
But it isn't like BO3, IW, MWR, AW and that's good. Ubisoft isn't as greedy as Activision, so thank christ that not every publisher is the same company with a good track record that got tarnished because of money and money is everything in the modern world and that would never change until the universe clears out.
---
kinky haha 
---
its one good screenshot haha
---
she puts bulletproof windows that she can pop off. There's a little extinguisher thing that needs to be triggered. That's what the drone is shooting at with its taser.
---
That is actually dope.
---
No.
---
It‚Äôs not like I put him as the worst op ever. Calm down. He‚Äôs just average. I‚Äôm not ranking him higher because of his gun.
---
You obviously dont ranking capitao and vigil so low
---
Fair enough. Pre patch I could agree with most of this
---
Hey man, dont worry about this kill. Youll get better. Quick tip though unless its a shotgun laser sights only hurt you. The laser will show up on walls and can give you away easily.
---
You put him below recruit when he should be a or atleast b, and you put capitao at the lowest when he has the most utility, and ofc put ash and vigil up there
---
Wrong
---
I didn't make the list bro
---
Yeah I literally switched to the pistol for echo and hibana, bearing is so bad now. Made me pretty much stop playing hibana. I love smoke but it has been infuriating to play him lately with that recoil.
---
Vigil‚Äôs ability is just ok. I was thinking of putting him with castle and tachanka but I didn‚Äôt thank god or this sub would have teared me a new one.
---
800 hours 3 black ice.
---
Idea: a paleish ghost looking costume or full black stealth suit and the mvp animation is her missing (like valk) but you see her knife around the look and she stabs then walks to 1st (sorry I'm not good with ideas)
---
Smg 11 goes up and left just control pull down and right üòÇ
---
This actually in the game?
---
I‚Äôm not ranking him based on his gun. I‚Äôm ranked him based on his ability.

You playin with airpods?
---
fortnite bad
---
You said based on utility. His utility is literally one of the best in the game. Plus he is 2 speed. It makes him one of the best overall picks in siege.
---
No. SMG are op rn. Just aim at the floor and let the recoil do the job, I‚Äôll get ez headshots every time due to how this game works. RNG &gt; Skill
---
But it‚Äôs any gun
---
I thought the 3rd party ones such as Cronusmax were supposed to be undetectable by the console hence why people are using M&amp;K to gain the advantage whilst having the console think they're using a controller.
---
It just makes the devs look lazy
---
Pest time
---
It would only be misleading I I claimed it happened recently and if it's an issue that's been fixed. Has this issue been fixed? No? Well Ok then. Did anyone claim this video happened recently? Also No...so I was right you're just here to argue bc you're part of that "ruined community"

If you were extended then yeah, that's a hitbox problem (the first three or four seconds of the gif aren't playing for me so I can't see) but I don't think the shield having a stroke in the kill cam is related to that.

In a 1v1 clash is basically useless. The only way she can be effective running the clock is if theres a second person helping her. Otherwise you run out the taser, melee the shield and aim for the leg
---
The thermite actually did something similar to me last round, so time I spent doing nothing to him me and my buddy were talking about how I could get him back. Once I figured it out and ran over and got the barbed wire

That looks like a cool operator idea. Something like blackbeard but does protect you but if you go to a corner and look at thr wall you can see who's down the hallway

Yeah and my win loss is only low because I hardly play ranked and the first time I ever did was in Para Bellum and I got bronze 3. Ever since then though I‚Äôve been winning more and more with my friends. Got gold last season and I‚Äôm gold again this season.

U get mad after someone writes that?

didnt rant even a little, just found it while looking through some stuff and posted it because it was interesting.

The R6 community really is shit, you guys really just assume why everyone does everything. Specifically bc you want to be an argumentative prick. No rant, no complaints, just a clip of a crazy round that ended confusingly. Hell your last post a few hours ago is you whining because people on your team left when you went in solo. Something people have done since the game launched....years later, you still "ranting"?

Iv just never liked them because of the position thing. I think on rushers there good because you‚Äôre all about getting in there. But for cav I would say no because of her being a lucking roamer. If others tell you differently go for it I don‚Äôt play her all that much.
---
Thanks! That's all I'm aiming for is a foundation.

Toxic vote to kicks happen on more than just console. It's part of the game, but believe it or not the vote to kick function serves its purpose sometimes.
---
Yep you deal 96 dmg to the hostage and then throw a guy and then lesion leaves. Have not played hostage since forever but do turn it off in matchmaking settings.

Ubi plz buff

thanks man i really appreciate it.

You literally posted a link to the original post... Wtf...
---
You could blame your ping
---
Hibana‚Äôs a lefty?
---
I agree. I play Buck a tonne and only use an acog and never found it too bad.
---
*face palms in mirra*
---
i feel like theres a cav hidden somewhere...
---
you really pay attention to...details

As an European i can only agree. I was copper twice and i never got out of it. I just had to wait for the next season, so now i always reach gold, because i concentrate on the first ten matches every season. This season me and my friends got Silver 3 at first but now we managed to reach Gold III - which wasn't easy as well. In EU Silver we always won a match, and then the match after we got people that had Diamond and Platinum Charms. Like every second round. It was just like Ubisoft didn't want us to reach Gold. Most of these people were toxic, and about level 250. (I am level 157).

Fuck off with all these dumb skins and Black ice shit.

a year for 52 hours is literally 1h a week, that's not much for anyone

Interesting

Someone needs their inhaler lol.

The only difference is the stakes

Of 19 lmao

You have more than likely encountered them already but did not know what to look for. Once you have seen one in action its pretty obvious.

I find Blackbeard to be a very interesting case. Depending on the skill level of players in the game he can either be quite disappointing or an absolute monster. In lower levels most people don‚Äôt aim for the head often anyways and thus the shield can almost be a disadvantage when combined with his lower end guns (the DMR is better but most low level players always preferred an automatic). In mid skill level Blackbeard is best balanced. Most players are aiming at where the shield protects, but most players are still not good enough to make him overpowered because of his lower end guns (most Blackbeards don‚Äôt usually get 1 hit headshots at this range). At top skill levels however, Blackbeard is insane. Good aim plus a good brain and the ability to survive a headshot or 2 becomes very useful in gunfights. In my opinion Blackbeard needs to be changed to be more consistent at different levels of play.

Haha

me looking out for demons in the shower
---
The determination
---
Ok does someone want to explain what this is all about? I've played the game like twice and still don't know what people do
---
Person with the defuser on site takes priority tbh. If the rest of the team is fucked off on the other side of the map, they're the problem, not the guy who's given up waiting for them and planting.
---
I know the subreddit has been flooded with uncreative boring posts. Come on I‚Äôve already seen this exact one in blue, why do I need to see a version with the colour set to red instead of blue!

sad to say i'm his height and 17 :')

Doesnt he have pilot glasses not biker glasses?

I think it needs more work and you need a smaller helmet.üòÇ

Honestly I tried looking for some aviators here at home but used my Oakley's instead
---
please educate yourself a little, and look at the specs and pretty much only look for what kind of video card, and this has a "Intel¬Æ HD Graphics 620"
---
don't get anything that says intel hd graphics for any "gaming", at the very least, get one with a 1050ti, or even better a 1060 which are now a lot cheaper than they used to
---
Better than the alternative. At least its democracy.
---
Whats your CPU?
---
Headshots have a x40 multiplier they're not programmed to instantly kill.
---
Really? Heard good things about cloud 2s and astro 40's, just seen a pair at ¬£120
---
I love the use of the Bearing perfect example of how to use the weapon
---
yeah i‚Äôm looking for a 500 dollar one it doesnt have to be fancy, you feel? if you could find one i‚Äôd be so grateful
---
Uh why? I can understand the Twitch changed but why make a Hibana a better Rusher than Ash? The only difference between the two now would be the ACOG. Since their guns are pretty much the same
---
We removed acog on GSG9, so we decide to give them pre dust line super 90
---
I would if they had a mic built in
---
ü§´
---
Lol
---
Well i do think your idea of buying cloud series as a good idea at that case.
---
I think the map itself is solid, and only needs to be changed a little aesthetically. Just color the rooms/floors differently and make it a little less gross looking and it will be a fine in ranked. However, unless they bring back the OG Hereford many people like myself will never be satisfied no matter how great the new map is. 
---
All the devs need to do, is put "Hereford Classic" in casual, and ranked can keep a cosmetically retouched version of the current map.
---
Wow, you took someone's design and slapped a red filter on it, very impressive.

I use turtle Beach recon 50p there 40 bucks on Best buy and I can hear people really well. Also I don't know if you are playing on PlayStation but if you are and you use party's be sure to got to the party and setting and prioritize game audio

People are just toxic AF. That is the only explanation. You can't please everyone.

Me and my friends always talk with the randoms who queue with us. Met most of em that way.

Out of interest, what Rank are you?

I don't see anything wrong here. 1st impact hit the wall and second hit you spot on.

Catch up on sleep lol
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see a whole lot of downsides for most operators using deployable  shields
---
Yea, I feel if they gave her a special sort of scan or something, it will keep her moving towards pings. 
---
Or maybe sound queues that point in the general direction.
---
Be interesting if it was a secondary gadget, and not an operator gadget.
---
*personnel
---
You're being sarcastic right? I'm never sure with this community.
---
Hmmm what colour background should I choose for this red coloured weapon skin I made that would make it stand out and accentuate the details.... I know! Red!
