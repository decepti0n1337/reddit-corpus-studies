It would be cool but you cant ask for more if you dont want 30 minute queues

 I'm like a bronze 2
---
Wow
---
[removed]
---
Also I only wrote this post because I got black ice for it and I have to make it work
---
Who plays warden tho
---
Damn dude don’t be a bitch
---
Yeah definitely an AR.
---
This works on pc as well. If people aren't expecting it or aren't set up you absolutely can catch them off guard and take site.
---
I would offer to help but I'm at Plat 2 rn 1 game from Plat 1 and I wouldnt see it as fair. Being in Silver sucks from what I have heard either you have bad teammates or people just trolling the whole game. Best of luck man!
---
You need to learn how to aim my god
---
Playing with friends helps the experience, and a good youtuber to watch would be TheRussianBadger
---
I like the 3 armor defenders and for some reason the mpx is pretty good
---
Aww so cute
---
Nice
---
Even if it is your friend
---
Tht is level 263
---
If you can’t afford #### cool whatever I’ll give your best starter mains which is :
---
Defense operators
---
Smoke, he throws yellow colored “meth” gas
---
Mute, jams drones and plus breach charges and any operator that involves electronic stuff not rocket launchers or physical tho
---
Pulse, wall hacks achieved jk he senses enemy through their heartbeat
---
Doc, good medic
---
Rook, passing them plates(armor) to your team
---
Kapkan, door traps
---
And finally in defense yo lord tachunka who has an lmg
---
Woukd be cool and i would get elite ash on pc
---
Understandable.
---
Temptation Sensation by Heinz Kiessling. It's from a stock music library. I was just looking up the music of IASIP today, weird that I see it mentioned again
---
Preference honestly lol I play my Jäger with a holo and my buddy plays with a reflex. Which sight works best for you.
---
Thank you
---
You had us in the first half I’m not gonna lie
---
I dont know how i got it on ps4 in first place but indid
---
F2 is the Chad rifle instead of the virgin dmr
---
Now that's a lot of damage
---
I also aced my first round after getting black ice for the r4c. I guess it’s a common thing.
---
I took my own username because I forgot my old accounts login info hahaha
---
It’s not that bad, there’s just a better weapon in her kit
---
Ik the f2 and the shotgun are better
---
Absolutely love hunting down and knifing the last operator
---
But how come nobody is shitting on bucks dmr
---
It's not *bad* but automatic weapons are better.
---
Omg I remember the God of Light in R6 this clip is ancient where did u manage to dig it up from!?!?!?
---
I don’t fucking understand this shit how the fuck are you guys so fucking good dude i’ve been playing since BEFORE HEALTH AND IM STILL ASS AT THIS FUCKING GAME
---
F2 is the best gun in the entire game, no reason to ever use the DMR
---

---
Btw I have black ice for the DMR as well, I know it's tough
---
No, then you'll just have two diamonds shitting on the coppers and battling each other.
---
Is this a normal thing fellow Zofia mains notice? or do i just get unlucky
---
The rifle looks like the Spcae Trooper M4 from Escape From Tarkov but with the UH-1 holo sight
---
And their voices sound like helium.
---
I never knew of whom he reminded me but FINALLY I HAVE FOUND IT
---
I don't think he's meant to be the same person but they look so much alike
---
Literally no idea who that guy is. If it was the ninja of r6 I would've heard about him.
---
Make sure youre actually using the 1050, siege sometimes will use the motherboard built in graphics
---
How did he not headshot you? Only your head was poking out.
---
I had that with a constant 2v5 with my single premate just the other day
---
YAS
---
*First round with R4-C black ice*
---
*Proceeds to get 5 knife kills*
---
Who’s gonna cheat in copper/bronze? How about a Copper/Bronze player who doesn’t want to be a copper/bronze player? lol
---
&gt; Am I the only one who thinks warden is a weak op? 
---
Literally the entire community thinks he's weak.
---
Attacker operators
---
Ash, RoCkEt LaUnChEr
---
Sledge, the hammer bro
---
Thermite, breach charge that destroys reinforced wall and says “ a really big ####ing hole coming right up
---
Fuze, hostig killer with cluster charges that gifts the enemy a couple of drags in a room( good for everything but don’t use on hostage mode or you’ll have a happy little accident)
---
Blitz, Thomas the tank engine
---
Montagne, a wall just a wall
---
And finally recruit which is best on attacker just equip a shotgun a Gernade and breach charges and rush
---
That's about when I log off for the day.
---
I dont believe the title but damn the casual players in this one lol lookin at u doc
---
put everything on low except for shadow
---
make sure your nvidia thing is set to performance over quality, and maybe mess with more settings in "program settings" within "manage 3d settings" in the nvidia control panel
---
Probably because he wasn’t expecting me to be there but to be fair my flick to the right might have saved my ass
---
Toxic
---
Pc only
---
No I do not play with points, that's why I included the last bit to show that I did indeed hit him.
---
I mean I sometimes run lion with it sooooooo
---
On me your uplay, I’m on vacation right now but I’ll friend you later
---
That’s all you have to do to hide from any console player
---
Eh just message me when you’re off and I’ll clap you
---
Ash charge as well
---
Same! I could’ve sworn I used borderless-144 before but it seems you can only go full screen now :(
---
Whatever you say buddy
---
You did it you crazy son of a bitch. You did it!
---
You won’t do it now so
---
3/4, but yes. So can the current system.
---
What about it?
---
Because im not home??
---
Ah true 3/4. The current system can be abused but not as easily.
---
Isn't Clash American?
---
That’s a good set up my man
---
The black ice only make up 13% of the gun skin but commits more than 50% of the crimes
---
Lol next time remember that you don’t actually have to be nearby for this to work
---
And the occasional brain dead enemy.
---
Don't forget that it kinda sparked the inevitable rise of Rainbow Six Quarantine.
---
For me its a 50\\50, I either hear mav burning shit and panic and look around everywhere for it or physically watch the wall melt and hear nothing.
---
So you prefer G-Sync on?
---
What Marley wants but can’t have
---
I mean If you don’t have any that play the game already sure
---
If you’re asking about realism thermal information can’t pass through other surfaces.
---
His gadget is drop &amp; go, passive.  Whereas doc's requires him to be alive.  When rook is killed while spawnpeeking (assuming he is killed), his sweatshirts still help the team.  Whereas doc's ability is useless the moment he dies.
---
Thanks discovered it myself ;)
---
Not very nice...

Lol, Sidewinder isn't free

Relatable as hell. I actually just commented about this on a post complaining about plats and diamonds in casual, I often go into casual with a friend or because I don’t have a lot of time. So I’m not playing with any sort of ranked mindset and I have the exact same experience. I don’t believe k/d or w/l matters but I have a 1.3 on both and I’m level 200 or something, and the amount of times I get “you’re boosted” or “that was easy”. The other day I played a game with some lower ranked friends I met in casual, and this guy on the other team messaged me saying “GG EZ” and kept riding his own dick. As someone who plays ranked probably 95% of the time..casual lower ranks can be way more toxic at times.
---
They said they’re working on it stop crying
---
Have had better. (050 Horiz. sens)
---
*Gets black ice, doesn't even use it* smh
---
Happy cake day
---
I have almost a thousand hours on console and about 1300 on pc, and I can tell you from personal experience the skill gap is insane. It comes from first off pc players are normally more communicative and competitive(not less toxic though) because they are more dedicated to being good at their game, you don’t get a lot of casuals at the point where you have bought a gaming pc to play it’s obviously an advanced hobby at that point. Also the aim on pc drastically changes the game. At higher gold, plat and diamond experienced players will kill you if you make the slightest mistake, on the console level that level of precision is just not possible with a joystick. So being more vulnerable on pc leads to making less mistakes, you sharpen up gameplay, you have to peek perfectly, do the right strats, choose the right angles and combat situations because if you fuck that up there is rarely a second chance that round.
---
I had no fucking clue what I was looking at for WAY TO LONG!

Who?

Smoke?

count it
---
I believe you bud... don't worry.

I’m just messing man good job
---
Sledge?

Someone didnt have friends in highschool. Want some more attention hoe?
---
Did you not read the rest of the fucking post? I was obviously making fun of OP, you fucking dipshit. "Hur Dur I can dig true cowments and make assssumptoens aboot peeple". You fucking idiot, fuck off. See your dumbass in casual.
---
Twitch and Thatcher pick rate would rise even more. I like the idea of it being bulletproof so it actually constantly lock down some routes for the Attackers. 
---
I wonder how many alarms can be given to this operator. While it may annoy the hell out of Attackers, it doesn't damage or hinder movements like Lesion and Ela so maybe somewhere around 3 alarms?
---
80 bullets and a dream

A long time ago, there was a bug with twitch drones where it'd immediately shoot every single shot it had in one shot. This was also a time when the drone had 15 shots, so there were a few videos back then where a super lightening shot happened and instantly did 150 damage to one target.

Thanks for this! I will try remapping to something comfortable and just play until I get used to it. It’s kind of annoying since the game sense is there, but the speed in acting is lacking. I’m just gonna have to practice some more.

I was about to say that someone's been playing too much Tarkov when they made this lol.

Yep. I understand. I’m just pointing out that Siege or Quarantine shouldn’t be called Rainbow Six.

Holy shit this just happened to me last night, are you on PS4?

He should really go back to BF the man sucks at siege and his opinions on siege are annoying.

I totally get you bro, but like ghost recon, it may just be a totally different game with rainbow six slapped onto it
---
an auto turret would be so broken
---
Hey look, the entire r6s server machine
---
But you didn’t use the gun though.
---
Did you steal it from Villa and pretending it as a 3D printed one ?
---
It matters if the people you might be sneaking towards are already in a gunfight. They wouldn't hear you knifing a welcome mat but they'd hear gunfire coming from a completely different direction.
---
This should have more upvotes than it does
---
don't you disrespect nomad like that, his skin is tougher than blackbeards shield.
---
100% agree.
---
However I did play the Breakpoint Alpha twice and there’s aspects that take it back to tactical realism. Not always but a lot of the time. Rainbow Six is a different story.
---
So this is totally unrelated but my rainbow won't load up I'm on pc and I'll load in the uplay and start up rainbow and I'll just sit in a black screen for 15 mins if anyone has has this problem and fixed it could you let me know thanks in advance
---
A small price to pay for elation

you took their manhood ripped it to pieces and burned those pieces.

When you do, can you tell us her name?

Roaming Rook going for unusual angles. Lower ruins door on Coastline or south window of offices on Consulate nets me quite a few.

Still have a hole that was left by Vegas
---
1 minute to do, I think this can work in my future games....
---
Why?
---
Why are you asking on a post that will probably get deleted? Make your own post.
---
I found Bikini in a match once when I was very new to the game. I didn’t know that nerf_gsg9_pls was anyone special.
---
It’s not completely related to the outbreak event, but the system itself is based on the three man survival mode.
---
If I'm honest the glitches on screen aren't doing his editing any favors
---
The point is, win or lose, it shouldn't count as a game if someone was hacking.
---
Sb to double light to sb feint to gb to side heavy to full charge sb to cc. How to play Warden.
---
This was the R6 games that was coming before Siege. No shame in not having hear of it, it was cancelled years back. Some elements of it were spun off into The Division, some to Siege, and some say Wildlands as well
---
They wanted jackel or twitch
---
Oh then I stand corrected
---
I absolulty love it when a team goes all recruit thinking it's going to be an easy win, gets their asses kicked, and then goes full try hard the next round.

The playstation share factory but i think it looks better in my gallery but im working on getting better setup for this stuff
---
Sometimes I throw an EMP at a wall that the OBJ is behind and sometimes I get nothing IQ can help by pinpointing where gadgets are and guide Thatcher on where it's best to thow an EMP. 
---
Also not many people know this but IQ really pairs well with Dokkaebi If She decides to give everyone a call IQ can find their exact locations until the enemies reset their phones.
---
Other good uses are detecting Alibi holograms so that you won't get fooled by them and can discern a normal drone vs one that is hacked by mozzie
---
Delta exists, officially. It’s just very secretive. It’s called CAG, or Combat Action Group, these days, and they generally recruit the best of the Army, as it’s technically the Army’s tier 1 counter terror group, but they’ve been known to poach a few dudes from other services if they’re good enough. But 1-SFOD-D exists very much in real life. They just don’t advertise much because of how secretive it is. 
---
But they have annual tryouts and they even post about it on various Army bases. I’m talking flyers and everything.
---
Gonna say that's RussianBadger, chief.
---
And that's about it.
---
Mav is US Army Delta Force.
---
glad that caption is there I almost didn’t notice this was a rainbow six meme

Maverick is US Army Delta.

Rainbow 9

Close the game, open task manager, close the game and uPlay software, wait a few seconds, open the game.
---
Ok is Blackbeard good
---
welcome
---
Oof, didn't know that.
---
I've seen so many people  use aimbots or wallhacks on consoles
---
I also posted it to twitter and im not trying to self promo either but the quality looks better on it
---
Had to say it sry
---
no problem bro
---
I use him for fun, a lot of people bag on him for his shield being too weak/too strong (depending on who you ask) but it has saved my life several times and I pick him any time I dont feel like playing Zofia
---
Should be coming out soon since they normally release one at the begging of the season and mid season
---
Thanks. Reminds me of way back in high school a marine recruiter told me if I joined the army I’d probably die. He no shit told me that on Facebook. I pointed out respectfully that the Marine Corps has a higher casualty rate per capita in Iraq at the time and he blocked me. 
---
The Army recruiters had cooler keychains anyway.
---
oof. We’ll never get to see our PTSD Dubai buddy in team rainbow then
---
Ahh I remember those days. I would potato it so it didn't matter anyways.
---
What I do (I’m on PS4 as well) is I’ll upload it to YouTube and it usually has a pretty high quality. I’ll then post it on the sub as a “Link” post. That usually works the best for me. Or there’s an app called VideoSaver where you can put the link in there and download it and then post it here. It you want to edit it o recommend downloading VideoShop and using that with VideoSaver.
---
I'm poor so have a reddit bronze
---
!RedditBronze
---
Alright i will take that into consideration thanks for the help
---
yeah.
---
Now u dont
---
Yeah it is about mid season and I've been playing smoke a lot and I'm hoping to buy it soon
---
*fUcKiNg HaCkEr*
---
So, let's analyze this post:
---
You have a problem caused by *your own mic,* the game crashes after that you unplug it, you restart everything, get in another match and get banned? Yeah, that sucks, but instead of "FiX yOuR gAmE uBiSoFt" you could just read developers blog where they officially said that this will be fixed in the next patch, and for now instead of rejoining by clicking on the pop up "ranked" button, you have to go on the three lines, ranked and look up for a match to join the old one. **before speaking, inquire.**
---
They had people who fit the Rainbow Six image; like Sledge, Thatcher, Thermite, Glaz, Kapkan.. serious people. I thought it seemed pretty legit as a hostage rescue game. Then they started adding people who looked like they belonged in fashion magazines.
---
I miss proper stories like R6 Vegas but the fashion models were the tipping point for me.

BB is awesome, if your aim is good as soon as you get hit on the rifle shield if you can quickly react and kill, BB is crazy good.

You didn’t use the gun once

I just got my last achievement last night, myself.
---
That damn breaching charge kill was one of the hardest things to try and do. I once spent an entire day trying to trick my opponents into walking in front of one. Then last night I get it accidentally making a distraction explosion in ranked.
---
Casual is a nice break from the toxicity of ranked. Like a week ago I was in a casual squad full of diamonds and all we did was just farm renown.
---
I cant adapt to being teamkilled every other round for no reason and voted to kick along with these people that try hard beyond belief
---
👀
---
Noice

Honestly, you can report them for toxic behavior, but if you're on console that's as good as doing nothing at all. You could play t-hunt on lone wolf and avoid people, which also helps you practice anyways. In casual/ranked though, you really need a squad with friends to actually stop this tk. The community can be super fun or super toxic and you never know what you'll get
---
Rekt

I have black ice on the r4c but I can't use it because it's for ash and I don't play Ash because she's a try hard fuck
---
Explain what?
---
This is Rainbow fucking Six bruh, of they want something they get that shit made custom to their needs! :D
---
Play with friends, and always I mean always know you are the best player in the server. Now you don't tell anyone that only to yourself.
---
are u looking in the same email thats connected to the ubisoft account
---
Yes the exact same
---
That’s strange, all I see is a blank paper...
---
In all seriousness though, amazing drawing!
---
I personally don’t think it should. Now understand this is a teamwork heavy game that relies on communication, but I play on console where the only communication is someone saying “You Suck”. Now as some else mentioned, you just have to find a good group of people to play with. Unfortunately that isn’t easy, especially on console. Just this season I’ve found at least five different groups of people I thought would be good people to squad up with whenever we’re all on, however after one night no one even try’s to message each other anymore, so it’s back to solo queuing.
---
In addition to this, the MMR being based purely on W/L has so many factors it doesn’t take in, such as enemy ranks (which has been a major issue this season), nor who your teammates are or how they act. The other day I was playing a ranked match and we were tied in the final round, and during the prep phase three of the other guys started shooting each other. By the time the round actually started it was down to a 3v5 and we lost and I was once again put down a level. I could continue but I think I’ve said too much as it is.
---
how many times have u tried im not sure why ur nit receiving the email
---
They are on casual
---
Looks like you got domed
---
I tried it many times

I checked my spam, delete, inbox

I even signed in and out to see

I even went through my phone to see

Sry to flex but I upgraded from a 6 to an X which is BETTER then the XR. (Many reasons y it is better). Also I have AirPods!! Just had to flex :D

What’s wrong with casual ?

Bro how you gonna be in here calling people faggots when your second every post on reddit is a shriveled dick and balls.

Haha thank you!

You’re supposed to restart after 2 minutes, this is your fault.

Is that an emoji I see?

And whats so special about getting in a match with them??

Isn’t something like this coming to the game? Like next season?
---
Well we have sonic blitz
---
Honestly,I’ve done all the things they said to do I’m 2 away even though I’ve done both of those things in previous seasons. Fix your game Ubi

so?

Pure terror

Yeah I just got it a little while ago. The gold one for me was bugged too but then I got placed in gold for the 3rd time when burnt horizon started and it finally registered
---
Jesus did they nerf him again?
---
Nah don’t worry guys his render distance was set to low
---
I don’t think so but still... he was better before

Give him a ak 47

Ability 2: make him able to pick up injured people

How are they getting cocky?
---
Thanks!
---
Lucky, I only have 2 Black Ice skins, and I have been playing for 2 years.
---
This is sick. You should do some other maps!
---
Set up a custom game.
---
Have 6 players including you. 
---
5 attackers who cant fight back.
---
1 Caviera who can attack.
---
Tactical realism.
---
0 brightness.
---
Nice dude. I am just one trophy off of getting all the trophies.
---
You: "Wow sorry you got fricked but I won the lottery so that's cool"
---
MP5 would still be a weak weapon for an Attacker in the end so I wouldn’t be surprised if ppl are not happy in the end. If anything, MP5SD would be a better choice (same stat as FMG but with ACOG and Suppressed). 
---
Nokk is the only non Shield Attacker who gets outgunned easily. Unless her stealth (which is countered easily) is massively buffed, Nokk would need much stronger gun to ever be justified being picked over the other Attackers in general.
---
Been playing since Y1S1 and have:
---
M870
---
CAMRS
---
AR33
---
MP5K
---
FMG-9
---
SASG-12
---
But with the black ice glitch I have way more.
---
Black ice glitch. I don't even play Jager or Bandit often, I main Twitch, Smoke, Maestro, and Lesion.
---
Is that still working nowadays?
---
I was really hoping you'd get cav'd right after opening it lmao
---
I'd recommend AimLabs over other aim trainers as its, well actually an aim trainer and not a high score grinder. Free to play, tells you exact areas you need to practice in, ect. Also don't forget things like a higher refresh rate monitor and a mouse more suitable to you specifically can pretty much instantly break hard caps in your play. I know far to many people who were hard stuck then bought a 144hz monitor and instantly passed their previous limits.
---
Who was my the dishwasher in that gif?
---
“Take some trauma plates”
---
Stop posting memes
---
Same Aim, Different Game is what I use to figure it out.
---
I was referring to the sensitivity modifier that is present on the zommed in optics on Siege, I don't swap them depending on the sights I am using. And across different games I always attmeot to get them as close to possible but it is alway slightly off.
---
Ty for the suggestion.
---
... Lardex is better but ok
---
I would've left before they had the chance to vote kick me lmao... fuck playing that game.
---
Needed to play gsg9 and IQ was taken, I hate shield ops especially blitz
---
Fuze, you should have BE the angry Russian and 
---
Knife her back
---
Blitz, give the poor man a breach charge
---
Oh yeah 144hz is so smooth and I use a g502 currently at 400 dpi.
---
That's a jumpout. Similar to runout, except you don't mean to get back alive.
---
Fantastic shot but I can hear those Blue Switches from here
---
Ranked?
---
I was at the wall in the shipping containers on the backend of clubhouse leading into the basement for almost the whole round and immediately ran in and died and lost us the round, but 100% worth getting my friends to laugh at me for 3 minutes
---
Saaaame
---
Nomad became sosad, sohad to hang herself
---
I know you said you played a lot of t-hunt, but that's really the best way. You need to practice a lot, and I mean a lot. Practice leaning so that you can line up your reticle on the enemy before the lean. Practice turning and firing, not strafe firing. Run drills, like legit shooting or leaning drills. Get good at keeping your reticle fixed on a position while you are moving. Practice this a lot until it comes naturally. 
---
I also think that it is a good idea to get rid of bad habits like not droning, staying near teammates, being in a bad position/ somewhere where you don't have an out, etc. I think there may be a couple of YouTube videos that cover things like this. Remember to stay focused at all times during a match, and always be thinking about how to get kills and stay alive.
---
I'll reiterate about playing t-hunt. Run it solo on the hardest difficulty to better your skills, even if you only kill like 3 or 4 dudes. Keep trying until you can do it pretty easily. You gain map knowledge while doing this too. Your shot will come through repetition.
---
Also, I think it's important to remember that a lot of your kills are going to come from what you do before you pull the trigger. I've seen people with great aim, but they were bad tacticians, and people with not-so-great aim that could hold their own in plat. So, line up your shots before you even see the enemy. Remember to stay calm, and control your aim. Do it slowly at first, and you'll pick up speed eventually. Do these things well, and your shot will follow. Other than all that, you need to just play a lot of t-hunt or even casual until you are satisfied with where your aim is at. I don't like playing casual because I start to form bad habits. To each their own.

Three dots in the top right and posr flair

So with the clip ending early like that, did you lose?
---
Me too xD
---
"wHat GUn iS tHaT?"

thanks

I'll be sure to do that from now on. Thanks a lot!
---
konasuba am i right?
---
Hey Ubi, add this ^
---
Recruit obviously
---
Yeah someone else posted this. It was more the fact we played ranked for 5 hours. I set off for work and he said "I'm gonna hop on casual for a little bit to pack farm". Didn't even get to my car before he text saying "yo I just joined a lobby with MeatyMarley" it tilted me so much :(
---
We don't speak about that movie 
---
We never speak about that movie 
---
Marley :,(
---
That is cheeky sir! Thanks for the tip.

(That's what she said)

Me and my mate are British so we are on the EU servers. And yeah Dom was in the match too. Fingers crossed they were recording for a vid :)

He's British.. so EU I think? (My friend and I are also British and also on EU I believe )
---
Yeah it contains cards but where is it a Crossover with FIFA? 😂 You dont collect them in fut, do you? And the idea of getting them also for watching live events via twitch is awesome!
---
Yeah, the devblog debunks peekers advantage with arbitrary doubling the reaction time of a peeker. Seems legit...
---
Twiches mini film

Its always when you look away that the OPFOR peek ;)

You're hilarious

It's worse on console

I don't collect card, but in italy there is a society that collabs with fifa to make soccer related card and an album to collect em LUL, really hope they make this in a real thing!

Clearly nobody told Valk that this was an R16 game. We can't be having those explicit hand signals in the game. It'll scar the kids for life.

Indeed

Pfffdsshhhttt

once I met tux on Bank and accidently tk'd him

he complimented my prefire :)

You probably mean those from Panini, dont think they are anything related to FIFA, just soccer.
---
It's ridiculous the amount of times I've had people shoot through my Monty shield as I knife them, literally through it
---
Nope, not that, it was another brand, it lasted less then a year, reep.
---
Hey I have almost have the same kd as him
---
Tachanka should'nt even be in the tier list, he os above all that peasant ranking
---
Yeet
---
So I went to this Ubiday event. Ubisoft is definitely making a push into Korea now that they are “localized” to have a subsidiary here. 
---
By far the most popular was R6. Tons and tons of cosplayers. They had cloud 9 (korean team?) vs another team showmatch for like $5 grand. 
---
I also made some random friends and they said R6 is the most known Ubi game among korean college kids cuz it was released in PC bangs. They did complain about cheaters though.
---
She was meant to but R6 devs said she was to overpowered
---
I am not sure if I would consider the Wild West event a DM mode. Perhaps it was faster than the normal core mode. But it wasn't very close to typical TDM or DM game modes in other games.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A recruit only mode would work fine, Everyone is 2 speed and 2 armour. Very barebones. Would probably work. :P
---
Lmaoo konosuba, Aqua fits pretty well with fuze I think
---
darkness is monty
---
It happens when you find a match already but it won't load into it until everyone else has loaded in.
---
For a long time friend :), when you find a lobby you can talk to the other players in the lobby as well. It isn't very impressive in the slightest, seems like a weird Ubi bug than anything lol. But its there.
---
Hey Ubi, while you're adding this ^ please remove the fact that the white masks hunch over when you shoot them in the body
---
Yeah , this is big brain time
---
Shitpost.
---

---
I lol’d
---
It's not the PC, it's the ping.
---
Wat do you mean
---
Thanks but i alredy got them
---
Lemme just say something. Around 80% I have met play tachanka not for the meme, no. They play him for the TURRET. He is genuinely a good starting op and isn't a bad op in general. If you're saying this because you saw an enemy play him in ranked, that's kinda toxic (no offense), if your teammate played him and didn't do well, then you should just ignore it. I don't use him often because, I have ops that I use more for my play style. But the first ever time I used him was the first and only time I've ever gotten an ace. I'm not saying what you believe is wrong, just that I disagree.
---
They are all out of the AshCog Tea
---
Just gotta do lots of T-Hunt.
---
Unless you own CSGO, set up the same sensitivity. That is how I warm up for Siege, I found the T-Hunt lacking. I just use CS aim maps. 
---
Plat 1, 1.4kd.
---
Oh you meant like those are the last 2 you need?

Unroll you want to lean an hit yourself with an impact

Imagine the bobas are actually Fuze's clusters

Username checks out
---
That wasn't a 1v3, but ok
---
The easiest way to tell is to go to a spot, stay still and change between them. If you can see more with the 21:9 then it’s an advantage, if your image is just stretched to make it fill the gaps, then more immersive.
---
If it's not an 11 man it's not a Fuze ace
---
 I was gonna say I think there’s too much a chance of accidentally using gadgets or abilities by mistake, so you misclick the second time
---
More then 75% of the gadgets have real world possible counter parts, and the science behind them checks out too
---
The question is, did he know about it. If he did, then I'm on the same page, but if he didn't let him win his points back.
---
I’m potatoeater225 and I approve this message
---
Your using angled
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
My theory comes from games like wildlands where you press Y to switch to second primary weapon but double tap for pistol. It works there without accidents.
---
oof
---
That look like the Konosuba op dance for me
---
your username and flair. Yikes.
---
I was thinking just bind them to both thumbsticks while leaning and without and just move the melee to something else
---
Although some would say this feature is not neccessary on console, I believe there is a way for it to be implemented on controllers. If PUBG managed to map all them controls to controller im sure there is a way to have hip lean on console.

They said they were fixing this like 6 months ago, no fix in sight. As far as I know they haven't even addressed this issue in months. 
---
Where did they say they were fixing it next season?
---
they really arent getting cocky at all, they are just having fun in casual.
---
What an amazing Kobe
---
That’s an elite I would pay for
---
I'm grinning ear to ear rn.
---
What a Clutch 🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
You obviously killed before
---
Lalatina.... Hahahahha
---
You deserve it
---
what?
---
1-14 i think
---
When is he planning to do so?
---
If you aren't going for headshots only with the P90 you're probably dead anyway, so any range.
---
Niiiice man. So cool that you got to meet them!
---
Because its solely better
---
I didn't xD
---
Thanks for all the links &amp; also crediting the OG artist! It looks like really cool stuff
---
Sadly not
---
WA GA NA WA MEGUMIN
---
No
---
i only do it if they take more than 2 minutes to join and it delays the whole game bcz its only casual so it doesnt matter
---
Yeah she'll never be picked if you can pick twitch or zofia (not to mention 3 speeds with better guns and utility). And don't even get me started on Warden, the alleged 'Jager alternative' that's so overshadowed by him that nobody in their right minds would choose him over possibly the best defender... The balancing team must have been smoking some real good stuff
---
We’ll meet them as in get in a game with them lmao.
---
That does get annoying sometimes
---
N o
---
[this is why]
---
So Ela's gun has 0 recoil on PS4
---
Throwing EMP grenade...
---
Such balanced
---
I’m not sure who you’re referring to.
---
I used to get that all the time at low levels, too
---
Task failled succesfully
---
They are very op ur just too stupid to see it no op should have a 2 shot pistol and be a 3 speed shes the only one
---
Blitz and bandit, GSG9 for the win!
---
No kidding
---
I was gonna go for patches after I put everything else together, I’m still trying to work out the arm pads where the flags are, because the vest I’m getting which looks exactly like his doesn’t have those short sleeves
---
That was really well done. What software did you use to make it?
---
My suggestion was always if you don't want him to be an entry fragger make it so people closer that 7m don't show up on thermals, and let him move around- instead of being movement based make it based on how far he is....but Honestly just giving him a cleaner sight picture and getting rid of the darkness on the players that are not lit up in yellow would go a really really long way, I believe the way the "people vision" scope works right now puts glaz at a significant disadvantage when they when players are not lit in yellow because regardless of what they are wearing they are very dark and their forms are obscured by lack of proper shadows making target acquisition difficult compared to anyone else, which is a huge hit on someone who's sole purpose in life requires him to have great target acquisition...he has a whole shpeel in his video about the "details" yet he feels like he needs to see the eye doctor every time you move... I don't think they really should touch the damage or the anything because I really don't believe it's the core of the problem and even if there's hit registration issues with his gun I bet a lot of people just are missing but don't realize this because, especially with the dot, his reticles are made bigger and bulkier by the inhanced zoom and thus even if part of the dot is on another player the actual point of aim may not be
---
And where can I ask them to do it? Im kinda new to the game , Thx for responding &lt;3
---
I wasnt tryharding. It was 2-2 and my team was dead with their team still alive. I want to win not lose But I don’t want to sweat which is why I play casual.
---
Her pistol is a 2 shot down with an extra shot if you want to kill. Calm down.
---
Also another thing is that ur aim is shit try practicing on that no wonder you have to use cav and nokk
---
"Ba't walang bawas?" Why didn't she lose health basically, Just for people who want to know
---
Yeah cus they can shoot u while there down nice comeback dumb cunt
---
Keep complaining about toxicity, yet ur the most toxic person I’ve seen on reddit.
---
Im toxic for pointing out the fact you have no skill cool idc im just trying to tell you to use SKILLFUL ops like jager or rook
---
Lesion
---
Sad hammer swings.
---
You got the season pass with it?
---
It's no longer OP, but it is strong.
---
Shaap alibi main
---
 it puts you im the region where you have the least amount of ping. Meaming if you get a ping spike in yiur area it wont put you there if your internet is faster in another place so its not there falt its your isp's. Ubi is just trying to help you so dont be mad at them.
---
BO here, still fun.
---
The title has over 30 words so I think I get what you're trying to say. Plus Xbox and PS4 are still the same thing regarding the 0 recoil thing. As for the response to the video: congratz on killing people on Xbox.
---
Cool. Take your time.
---
Yes that’s why I called you toxic. It couldn’t possibly be because ur calling me a dumb cunt and talking shit about my aim and calling me unskilled because I play a specific operator. Couldn’t possibly be because of that.
---
Just a couple of guys with Siege usernames commenting in the K-on sub, couldn't help but notice lol
---
The exact opposite actually
---
Wow,
---
Also is a skilful operator a clash? A shield operator? I see.
---
If you check out my stats ull realize that i use SKILLFUL ops and i stay away from cav and ela and ash and nokk and blitz Im ColeSlaw Lamma4 on xbox btw if you really want to see and being toxic on reddit is if i just called u a toxic fag but im giving you reasons this is an argument not me just hammering you with insults the whole time sorry if i seemed dumb
---
Fuzuma Fuzuma!
---
Hai, Fuzuma desu.
---
Another issue with the K1A is Vigil has a rail that doesn’t seen all to common from what i’ve seen. It might be worth 3D printing one of you have access to such tools.
---
Shes way different that fuze montange and blitz u wouldnt last 2 seconds with clash pro league players like pengu say she takes the most skill to use
---
Slap an acog on that badboy.
---
I do, it would be a decently long print, but nothing too hard
---
Haha, I do, but can’t start until halfway through the month due to training dates, dbs/docs validations, etc
---
Copper adventures
---
Yes im sorry i just get pissed off when i see a player using unskillful ops
---
Like 25? Or 30 ?
---
Source Filmmaker
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
Wtf? ‘How do didn’t’ english please? I think you’ve already lost the argument your planning to start
---
How do I get one?
---
Damm blew up my ears
---
No, it's clash, that's one of her quotes
---
u/EMATACHI
---
Never really used red dot might give it shot thx man.
---
The mvp animation is him naruto running in circles
---
He doesn't have any ops other than recruit. Therefore, he can only play recruit. (This is in ranked BTW)
---
Sure ok what ever you say fucking retard
---
still got the 4 kills but you pinpoint that one flaw.. someones a little jealous
---
Nice shot on that shield pixel angle
---

Ok

Are you on Xbox? I’d play with you if you are.
---
*agressivly buys smurf account*
---
How do u improve ur aim? That's the problem I struggle the most. I heard u should go to terrorist hunt, turn off aim assist and just get as many headshots as possible.
---
My gt is JDawg537419
---
**agressivly buys smurf account**
---
Nice aim
---
What is near to you?
---
lol this isn't even that bad
---
Ok go get your eyes check beacuse how did didn’t if it flew over your head it’s what your where trying to say I spelled wrong but take a look at my post again
---
I have know about this since the start, wish I knew that it would get 105 upvotes haha
---
Use the ability and then run in like an idiot, garenteed 3k. Also use the V308 (I use reflex,flash hider, vertical grip, laser sight)
---
Gotta do headshots anyway so marshmallow headshot gun or newbies
---
60?
---
oh wait...
---
**thats illegal**
---
I specifically looked up for a Siege meet-up post so... lol
---
Maybe for some people, but for me it's painful hitting someone 10 times before they die. It has the same rof as the f2 but half the dmg
---
Frost elite
---
:) I don't really care about upvotes, I just want to share my findings with other people and hear their opinions about it.
---
Technically wouldn’t you have won with this since the hostage died last?
---
How is that even a question??
---
**the lord**
---
Long range with the shotty and extremely short range shredding with the P90, rite?
---
Those times were great why did they take it out?
---
https://www.facebook.com/Six-Tea-673046406499686/
---
There’s obviously no headshot..
---
Shit talkers were rave_R6goat and DeAundreRobinson. Fucking pussies
---
No need to be humble that's huge mate.  With all the leavers and teamkillers to deal with when solo queuing that's a remarkable feat.  Congrats!
---
&lt;3
---
Very generous of you
---
So
---
Play and fail terrorist hunt? Might get that score
---
That's some dedication to the win, i thought u will go for the ace in the last 15 secs. :D
---
Yo that happened to me today!!! 1st round of my ranked was good all the rest of the round, though my sounds were wonky
---
The audio thing happened to me too
---
In my case the enemybteam were making fun of us calling us noobs... I really cant find how a game thats been out for many years has this problem
---
When you died the guns became muffled?

Hello xMasterMelonx, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/clmoeg/blitz_extreme_nerf/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Maybe they dont play Glaz, and are trying to figure out how to play him to be more versatile
---
Yeah, and things like background noises like rain or a car we're amplified
---
Yup, it's a sad state of affairs. At this point I kinda want them to hide MMR in ranked so there's zero incentive to ddos. Honestly I don't really care about my rank apart from playing against people of a similar level as playing competitively is the best part of siege imo.
---
Oooh dont msg back!!! That's how they get your ip address
---
Sezuan Dipping Sauce
---
Cav is next
---
Hahah yeah like the drone hop.
---
I prefer Echo's MP5SD for Nokk, because it fit her role as flanker and if u want it balanced, just dont give her an ACOG.
---
Yeah it's a really weird glitch
---
Most definitely. Odd it surfaced at this point in the season imo
---
You missed my point. Your rank resets at the end of every season. The people that are unranked - as far as you know - could have been a diamond in previous seasons (or copper) and could have been clearance level 400. I have friends that have been plat every season since Red Crow that just the other day finished placements. My point being, just because someone is unranked, doesn't mean they are relatively new to rank.
---
Textless eh?
---
Somebody works in post production.
---
Holy cow dude it’s amazing 👍
---
now heres the issue with that, now we have either just new players like i, apparently wrongly assumed, smurfing diamonds, or just people coming back to the game late season
---
Not mad just disappointed
---
i'm sorry what? sketchy really? you do realize when he shoots through the wall, the person behind that could also see it?

Well you have gsync so why do you even consider vsync? I mean, Siege is a competitive game, you don't really play this game to admire the graphics but to have highest fps possible for fluidity without sacrificing visuals. I don't know why to play Ultra over Very High?
---
Twitch is the best looking one, Fuze is probably the most rare.
---
All range with the P90.
---
Not a hand-me-down
---
No cause I’m pc
---
I've been here since day one bud. Just because you like a game doesn't mean you can't criticize it. It's been 4 years and the game is still a clusterfuck. Faith went out the window years ago.
---
3rd floor
---
And iron sights
---
It's totally possible this new operator could be good, but I can only really see that on specific objectives with convenient hatch spots that are out of view.
---
For example: If I recall correctly Hereford 3F there's a hatch in the back corner of the site without the tractor (can't recall the name currently) and the only people I really ever see there are Echo or Maestro on cameras, or defenders who are just falling back to a tighter spot. Or maybe something like Fortress where under the drop in the NE tower there is a hatch which is more out of view then the drop itself is. Those could both be good because they're just not normally watched and they're a bit more out of view while still opening up to a useful spot. However a lot of hatchets on the same floor that is being defender is either in a spot you can just run to without issues anyways, or just in a spot that I'd ASSUME leaves you very vulnerable to people beside it.
---
Something I just thought of though, if a 3 speed, it's possible this operator could rush really well by popping a hatch and just going in quickly to avoid roamers. Like on Oregon 2f in kid's there is a hatch you could go up, you could likely just run to it within like 15 seconds of the round starting, pop it up and jump up and have a flank on people still finishing set up and/or returning to anchor.
---
Hi Drax!
---
How does one achieve this
---
i know how hard it is to solo queue, with so many people leaving and throwing it is very hard just to get to silver. congrats my friend :)
---
That’s just the P90’s Stand
---
That's just Cav unlocking her Stand ability: Recall
---
Why was this even worth being posted
---
...cause they each have gadgets on their wrists?
---
Well she entered in a pretty bad spot, small hallway on the side of the site with a 90° turn that Ash or anyone else could be easily killed fron someone just holding a pixel at head level. The Hibana hole is helping Ash much more than it's hurting her. Team can peak the larger hole and apply pressure from one angle while Ash advances to a forward position to apply pressure while the rest of the team moves in behind, Ash could be using her gadget to help the team advance by causing a bit of controlled chaos near the enemies but overall a good gadget use and game plan from Hibana.
---
to show the wrist mounted gadget.
---
They nerfed shields, they one melee will only down someone now
---
Most definitely Kapkan. Best elite in the game imo.
---
Creepy!
---
Cus Illuminati confirmed
---
You're really bad at being a normie
---
&gt;I thought that's what 90% of smurfs were not gonna lie 
---
Generally a smurf is considered an account who intentionally ranks down to play against weaker players or trolls... Hence why people dislike smurfs it can be annoying to play with diamonds in the newcomer playlist or silver que. This is also were the term elo hell comes from which is described on here often enough. A gold player drops below silver and cant get up again because they are only playing against smurfs, who usually play around that elo of low gold and silver.
---
&gt;why can't it work? Logistically it makes sense, hence the term  technical, whenever I do it (which isn't that often) I always refer to  it as a technical ace 
---
You kill all your teammates, kill yourself and then tell you tell them "its a technical ace"? Uhhh how often do you get kicked for teamkilling and who many games did you lose because of this?
---
Kaplan
---
Yeah I do realise that, cheers! I'm more interested in the way his aim is. Based on other feedback from other users, we have determined it's a bit of luck sprinkled with skill. Much love and stay safe :)
---
Yep. A super easy way to show this is to just stand in a corner, back against the wall, and look straight down.
---
This happens all too much now.
---
Sorry for this long winded answer but here we go. Been playing since beta and am a plat 1 currently. Hibana is useful for breaching inside walls and hatches really her strongpoint is that she doesn’t have to run up to the wall and expose herself to whatever trickery the d is up to. Thermite is best for exterior walls where he doesn’t have to expose himself as much running up to place the charge. For that reason I use hibana most for versatility as they both have good guns. Also use hibanas smg with no sight as it will help you control the terrible recoil. Hope this helps.
---
Just paranoia with a dose of skill from the other guy, cheers lads!!
---
I always use valk on third floor and throw cams out of the window onto the wall outside. Pretty known strategy but I like it.
---
console clips need to be banned from this sub, so painful to watch
---
Again I thought Elo Hel was just hitting a rank then go on a massive losing streak and not being able to go back up again, and the odds are is you'll never kill your entire team without getting kicked, although it would be marginally entertaining to C4 all your friends as they pick up rook armour, and no idea x2, but I can assure you when it's the ninth round and the three stack on my team who have a combined total of four kills and have not stopped talking shit the entire game and they get team killed, we didn't lose because I TK'd them lmao
---
I thought this was scrabble?
---
You say it like its an easy thing to update the engine of a running game. Not many game actually did it so far and I can understand why...
---
They benchmarked zombies in a Siege event. They will benchmark the new engine in the zombie game, then maybe they will think about switching the engine.
---
Definitely earned it
---
Ping pong but with a twist
---
It might sting A LOT
---
can you elaborate I cant understand what your trying to say op
---
I think they’re all pretty balanced (for the most part). They all have counters and sent really easy to use
---
Blitz(and Monty if he’s not extended) can be shot when he ads, the top corners of his shield usually don’t offer full coverage, and when he  stands or runs his legs r very exposed. 
---
Clash is easy to juke out by faking to run away (most clashs will switch to their gun) or if not  she is still very exposed after u melee her. 
---
Monty can be forced to deextend (and therefore be left standing and exposed for a sec) by a number of ways (examples would be Ella, frost, lesion, echo, kapkan and so on)
---
All r susceptible to well thrown c4 or even impacts. 
---
And when all else fails use ur brain and knowledge of the map to get around to their back. Or just keep ur crosshairs on their head and wait for them to ads.
---
I need a squad bro sometimes i get paired up with the stupidest fuckin players ever
---
He decked you
---
yeh it’s pretty much a better Dokk, but she can’t ring phones or anything.
---
so the whole team gets access to cams, but not ping through cams like the defenders can.
---
they gain access to this by tapping into a phone like Dokkaebi does, off a dead person. once activated it lasts the rest of the round. 
---
when the ability is activated it basically makes it so the whole attacker team has access to cams, and so do the defenders. but if a defender tries to go on the cams, it pings their current location to the attacking team.
---
hope that answers all questions! :)
---
Yeah players that know how to play and idiots who run shield and play stupid.
---
Wood IV confirmed.
---
i like both but the cz has by far the worst pistol sights in the game, so i use the smg 12 with a scope and bc console has no recoil on it haha
---
The cheaters dont joy the win... they joy the rage of the others... that is what cheating is making good. those loosers want to have revenge for everything someone else did
---
what is this? Wii sports tennis or something?
---
been using comp barrel on her gun ever since but shooting far away is hard recoil was ass feels like the gun is used for close range now
---
learned something new today
---
Many siege players do not know basic human anatomy, for example, here we see a confused siege player shoot an attackers shoulder and call it a headshot.
---
It had to be her neck then. Why doesn't a shot to the neck kill anyone.
---
I assume what looked like a third projectile after the second impact perhaps. I'm considering a gu mine but I didn't notice one in the kill cam
---
Delete this.
---
Seeing as I have Sledge, Ash, Twitch, Blackbeard, IQ, Hibana, Mute, Doc, Lesion, Frost, Bandit and Jagers elites. Safe to say I like there's. Kapkans not bad but I barely ever play Kapkan so its not for me
---
You can fuck off you condescending cunt
---
A really big fucking F coming right up
---
I’ll just assume his corpse body slammed me
---
Watch for the gu mine at the front door
---
Congratulations welcome to gold everyone's way to sweaty I've been here for the past year it's hard to solo queue out of gold get yourself a squad
---
What platform? This is just a basic thing on ps4 nowadays.
---
I think he means why dont sides change after rounds anymore but like you im not sure just guessing
---
Honestly, he/ she is way too edgy
---
# what gender is he/ she? #
---
B)
---
But ubisoft said, YOU SHALL NOT PASS
---
His gas. It’s quite inconsistent, so it’s plausible that’s what killed you, you just moved into it’s AOE after detonation.
---
Ubi is good at fucking up headshots in this game
---
If you are actually drunk then there would be no problem, but as you are clearly not then yeah, please don’t annoy people
---
Yeah what you explained. Why is it like 3 rounds of attack than 1 round of defense if it's a 4-0? why doesn't it go from attack-defense-attack-defense vice versa
---
I’d learn to main echo
---
He's reffering to when you changed sides every round, where as now Ranked has 3 Round Rotation. You'll play 3 rounds of Attack then 3 of Defense. Or vise versa.
---
Yeah that’s the plan.
---
Personally, I like the shields in the game, though I suck at using them. It's annoying and very much a cheap move, but it adds more risk to not having proper positioning and communication. Get a late flank from behind the op and he's a sitting duck, has to expose himself to one person. Now in a 1v1, god they suck to go against. Only one I can reliably beat in  a 1v1 is clash or monty since they cant shoot without swapping off the shield (clash) or deactivating the extendable part. They are sitting ducks at that point and you can melee the shield to get a few free shots. But blitz, fuze, and recruit shields are awful since they can shoot you from behind the safety of the shield, blitz being the worst since he can blind you and rush you without dropping the shield. So though I agree, they are always cheap, and only in the case of blitz would I argue broken. Like, make it so the glass can be broke after a certain amount of damage. Now a high amount of damage so they aren't useless, but kinda like blackbeard's shield on launch. 800hp maybe? Means they can take a beating but have a risk in staying exposed for too long. (now clash would be an exemption to that rule or else her all glass shield is useless)
---
Nowwa itass noot advisible
---
Waiting is all you can do. I'd reccomend checking the weather as that can also interfere.
---
I'd reccomend 10 minutes of waiting and if there is no progress you can play something else.
---
(Im on ps4 and it worked for me)
---
Not sure bruv they change the game alot
---
I agree with giving him another primary, but if they were to give him a new primary it would be fully automatic with a semiautomatic capability. But that would be kind of unfair will the thermal scope.
---
Bandit and Hibana
---
Congratulations once again mate
---
 GLHF
---
Wait till its on sale for 20 bucks..
---
If you are go into ranked
---
gg ez nice terrorist hunt boys
---
Thanks for the correction kind stranger
---
Thanks homie
---
What do you reckon?
---
Overwatch implemented this to a degree.
---
Its working out quite nicely for them.
---
Come on ubi!
---
Blitz and our Lord and Savior Tachanka
---
It’s used to. It now does not count because it was inconsistent and made it look like a body shot was a headshot.
---
Fuze, also I’m a hardcore cav main and she is by far my favorite operator in the game
---
Hehe
---
it's not a bug, it's a feature
---
Hello IllusiveGhost, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/clojy0/3_monitor_fisheye_with_nv_surround/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I actually don’t know if this is common or not
---
I really love playing Fuze, there’s something about nuking the entire objective site that really turns me on lol 
---
I also like playing thatcher so I can feel like I’m useful to my team haha
---
They should remove the blood splatter as well. It just making the process more confusing. Keep it for headshot but not anything else.
---
Gotta get to lvl 30 before you can play ranked.
---
Lmao, like every other or third casual match is like this on the WEU server on a friday night, all the chodes come out in droves just to ruin peoples fun
---
U gotta clip I believe u tho
---
I have so many hours dumbed into the game and I can safely say it is my favorite game of all time but I have never played the Vegas games so I’m not sure if they are similar or not
---
Even then if you can kill a tm getting interrogated then you should have a sight on the cav. 
---
Only time I can think of it being beneficial to tk is when you have a cheater on your team and you have to take justice into your own hands.
---
Im pretty sure its been confirmed that shes a woman
---
Nope but It happened to me 4 months ago with twitch drone
---
Did I say shields are op? No
---
When people type bad to act drunk
---
Why are u tiny :(
---
Game is fun. People will do their best to fuck your soul until you're crying. But... Eh. Still pretty fun.
---
Well I’ll look into it more.
---
Now that is the entertainment I'm here for
---
That would make shields entirely useless.
---
This task a grueling one

thats just casual, either u took someone’s main or they just thought they were being funny by kicking some guy for no reason
---
Because you pirated windows
---
This is beyond science.
---
I knew Alibi was short but not THAT short
---
Lol why tf are you reposting this so soon
---
Nomad
---
Is every character right handed
---
Shields are probably the most bipolar aspect of siege.
---
Well I hope that doesn’t get in the way of enjoyment.
---
Often you don’t have both impacts and also sometimes the shield user will just turn slightly to the left or right and take reduced damage because they’re shield will face the explosion.
---
People do this in half my games, I always wondered why, thanks for the insight
---
Fuze: “Hostage is my waifu’”
---
Hostage: *mumbling*
---
It was 800 but it didn't record
---
Did you pirate windows or what lol
---
Oh, to thaught I was the 1st person to come up with this epic prankeroo.
---
How.  It still blocks bullets, and getting knocked on your ass makes you vulnerable to close-range gunfire from the famously inaccurate shield sidearms.
---
Cav. Even if I need to tryhard, still Cav.
---
The epitome of “Right back at you”
---
its a really good game to have friends in, it helps guarantee that everyones on the same page and u can just fool around with people
---
This dude just hit you with the reverse uno card
---
I literally didn’t notice my video was paused lmao. It paused itself when you were aiming at the door so I just thought you were waiting and after a while thought “damn this guy could have at least cropped the damn video”
---
well i’ll try my best to ignore that
---
LoL lEt ThEm ChEaT
---
Not really, I got other stuff to do right now
---
I personally think almost all of the elites Ubi makes are super cringy to look at. Hers, Lesions, and Blitz's are cool though.
---
Very true, but the sheer speed in which I dispatched Blitz is the key point in this video and the chosen title.
---
That’s not true at all. If you’re a new player it’s a great way to learn maps, and it eases you into the game by putting you up against easier players
---
You can now take the skills you've learned in the game to the protests on the streets!
---
It is tons of fun when playing with friends, Even without friends it can be tons of fun if you get some good teammates.
---
Cus pirated windows

Hello YeboiHigh, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/clpec4/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You either pick between shit sights or shit recoil. Personally would rather use the c75
---
It used to be silent, but I think they stealth patched it recently.
---
Most people above at least gold 4 know not to hold the same angle and for damn sure don’t stay in the open on that site
---
Ranked has changed to more closely resemble Pro League rules.
---
Still alternates every round in Casual.
---
Just console.
---
"JuSt AlWaYs HaVe ImPaCts LmAo"

It helps to not take anything seriously. Rank,K/D or other things people stress over.
---
Nah fam maybe if I wasn’t over 1000 miles away from my ps4
---
Than why did you respond and downvote?
---
I think we can all agree that C4 shouldn’t knock around like a bouncy ball. It seems like the problem isn’t with shields, but how the counter to shields aren’t functioning properly.
---
I would argue that it is still a little bit less noticeable than just sprinting and with the ideal timings you only loose 5% speed:
---
I NEVER rush or play ash but I have to say that I really enjoyed my first time doing both lmao.

I feel like this isn’t just a spontaneous PSA.

Just gotta hope they have unique guns and these two will be awesome!
---
nice job respectable member of society
---
Lol I don’t think M&amp;K would give these kids any more brain cells then they have now.
---
The menus aren't graphically intensive, So yeah the FPS shoots up really high if you have V-Sync turned off.
---
If i dont do well i play it out and get off right after
---
Tbh I only noticed the bad depth perception in Siege, and I play many FPS games too. But dunno.

No, it's on pc also. (I'm plat 2 on xbox and like 3 games away plat 1 on pc)

It just put a reverse uno card nothing wrong
