Restart your game

This was after I restarted it, this was the 3rd try the other 2 got up to 10 mins.
---
\*Visible Confusion\*
---
As a platinum player I pretty much never play solo. I only play with at least 1 or 2 friends and now this season we are only playing with a 4 stack. Get that random 5th thats a mouse to go against the enemy mice lol.
---
Oh wow. Isn’t the point of the game to utilize the map to the maximum advantage? I’m just surprised cuz I’ve seen pro players vault in border twice to get on top of that one locker in armory 2nd floor. Never heard of this before
---
my favourite clips are watching cav get obliterated 
---
Try restarting your pc and doing it. It bugs out for me some times and fixes it self on restart
---
At least it isn’t a Alpha pack charm, which was my first legendary 
---
I can't say for certain that *isn't* why. However yes, I am talking out my ass.
---
IIRC there was a small buff this season as her traps are/were essentially useless at high level play.
---
Totally agree wait till i upload the other video from this round..
---
It's not that Ubisoft doesn't care about console players, it's that they are truly powerless to stop players from using keyboard and mouse. Native keyboard and mouse don't work on console. To get around that restriction, players use an adapter that converts keyboard and mouse input to controller input. As far as the game is concerned, those players are using a controller the same as anyone else.
---
Pmm cuz it is the best, the gsh is wack and weak 
---
this has been happening since two days ago i have restarted my game, and reset my pc multiple times since then.

PMM. Does around 55 damage and it feels great to use.

I'm just gonna say it...THICCCCCCC

It’s tough trying to control recoil on console. But playing enough you almost get used to it. 
---
Makes sense, he was the helicopter pilot in operation outbreak 
---
The primary measure of how well you played is whether you won, which in and of itself is not a crazy thought. Does it really matter how many kills you achieved if it wasn't enough to win you the match? There's also a concern that adding personal performance based ELO modifiers would encourage players to make selfish plays to light up the scoreboard rather than making the tactically correct play.
---
I know this will be unpopular for many, and I do intend to further clarify why individual stats are not reliable for determining rank, but I think a lot of players who advocate for individual performance to influence rank are missing the forest for the trees. In bomb without any rounds going to a draw, it's possible for one player to have 45 kills and 0 deaths yet lose the match 5 - 4. You could talk me into one of those round losses in which you secured an ace being just bad luck on the timing, but not five rounds in that way. If you were to have that stat line in a 5 - 4 loss, it's because you actively did not play the objective despite the opponents having planted the defuser.
---
To get into further details without the dramatics, there is no way an automated system can ever accurately pinpoint how well a player individually is performing in Siege. There are so many decision points players have to make that will never be registered as an activity by a system but which contributed to the success or failure of the team.
---
For instance, let's say you are watching a teammate's camera (be it a Valkyrie Black Eye, Maestro Evil Eye, Echo Yokai Drone, or a bulletproof camera) and a Zofia comes into frame about to flank one of your roamers. For the sake of simplicity, you have three choices (and you can potentially combine 2 and 3):
---
1. Do and say nothing.
---
2. Call out on Zofia's position.
---
3. Scan Zofia.
---
The only activity that could be measured by the automated system is number 3; it's also probably the most likely scenario to ensure that camera gets found and destroyed and likely not the ideal option. The game can't possibly distinguish between 1 and 2 so it has to treat both the same. Since the game doesn't know what you decided to do and more importantly won't know the impact of your decision, it can't attribute the outcome of that event to you in a positive or negative light. You can say nothing and your teammate logs the kill or you could've given the most pristine callout and your teammate ignored you or missed the shot.
---
Team performance beyond wins/losses could add an interesting flavor if they can figure out a way to balance the ELO out as a result and ensure teams aren't given an incentive to go for a stupid play to increase their potential ELO to their detriment. For instance, giving the entire team the same bonus to ELO for winning an attacking round via objective might add some spice to the ranked recipe for some teams, but I'd worry there would be teams which end costing themselves round wins trying to get that bonus when the most strategically correct play is to go for the frags.
---
How about remapping the key?
---
Was this ranked or casual? If it was casual then they most likely don’t know what to call it. Maybe they don’t know the maps well so they can’t describe it perfectly. 
---
yes but tachanka is useless at high level play, so is cav kind of. they shouldn’t model the ops based on pros. it ruins casual play where most players are at. i don’t hate frost i think she’s the worst operator but i can’t stand cav. they are both over picked
---
Ok I tell this to everyone just restart the que if it passes 2 minutes 
---
Hahahahaha
---
well aware...xD but still
---
imagine caring about a chubby female being added because it "ruins immersion." If they wanted to be realistic every character would look like the first 4 ops. It's not forced, your just a panzi edgelord
---
You're the one who's moaning about it.
---
Seems to be just that time of the year which people get siege on a discount and go troll. 
---
That’s happen to me but it was gridlock 
---
That's not what a few of my more I.T. savvy friends have said. They have said it would possible to create code to detect 3rd party adapter input or even track movement.
---
So, ya  Ubi doesn't care about us console players.
---
Very good, the joke is a nice addition. I’d rather they made her smg a bit more accurate 
---
Not sure how im an edgelord or a pansey because i dont like fatchicks, green haired 30 year olds, or furries in a realistic game.
---
But hey. To each there own.
---
You should cosplay nomad, you look exactly like her
---
Holy fuck my immirsion is ruined! They added a phat ass white girl. *equips IQ elite*
---
i’d say the pmm, but p9 for montagne. fuze needs to use that pistol so you want fire power
---
Jäger can fly anything.
---
Oh look, a comment. Nvm it's retarded.
---
the second face was the best one. the first is alright too. the third i don't like. 
---
Going by this logic wouldn't the 5.7 USG need the same buff?
---
Yeah changing the controls would be a stretch. Even if it was just to make the controls similar to PUBG
---
Why was 3/5 of your team dead before the round started
---
if you’re on controller try 
---
V-55
---
H-81
---
Deadzones-10
---
ADS-45
---
Quality content 
---
Yeah, making individual stats part of ELO really isn't a good solution as it discourages playing Thermite and planting the bomb/encourages baiting. It's honestly so hard to accurately measure someone's skill level that it's hard for me to really give any suggestions as well. A good starting point IMO is forcing everyone to que at the level of the person with the highest rank in the lobby so at least you won't be able to reach diamond by queing with your buddies on their copper accounts. 5 stacks should also only face 5 stacks.
---
Can hit me up I'm AydenPride on Uplay I tend to play solo or duo due to lack of friends playing this game. I'm normally gold/silver (currently gold) also I love Charizard.

Because I don’t care about him cheating stfu
---
Isn't that usually used in the background of the icon?
---
Yes but I’m just thinking about the P90 and how to balance it. In the interest of game balancing, the 5.7 USG should stay the same.
---
Was this beta? I never had this, at least in skull rain
---
I think that her hitbox is too small but other than that she's fine.
---
I actually forgot about Jackal, but everything else either openly exists, or probably exists but is classified. IQ’s gadget could be some kind of advanced bug detector. Blackbeard’s rifle shield actually exists, but has been made less effective than its real world counterpart thanks to game balance. I don’t know how a crossbow is unrealistic. Lion’s drone could function similar to echolocation. Nano machines do exist, but the function they serve in siege is ahead of its time. Doc could fire painkillers allowing you to shrug off damage. Castle barricades, BP cams, and evil eyes would eventually crumble under sufficient fire, but don’t for the sake of game balance. Yokai’s cloaking technology likely exists today, but is classified. As for the sonic blast that it emits, it’s been proven that sound has many applications, so I don’t see how that’s entirely impossible.
---
Somebody called it out that the IQ is literally one shot right?
---
Ranked?
---
oh shet.

It’s a fucking video game

Lmao I swear, I got black ice for Kaplan a while ago and I was like "well looks like ik who I'm playing for a bit"

Except that nanomachines actually exist, but do not have the ability to improve combat capabilities yet. Hence... Finka’s nano machines are ahead of their time.
---
Don't play her

I feel like its only a problem if you're copper /bronze and you face plats and diamonds queuing with coppers

I think that too whats your dpi?

That's not even much higher when I'm in gold I get placed with platinum when im platinum I get placed with diamonds get used to it

Playing ranked is how you learn to play ranked.  Once you know what the buttons do and how the basic round mechanics work, you should be able to start playing in ranked.  You wouldn't recommend playing casual for 50+ levels to someone as the best way to learn the game properly.  30 is plenty.

I bought a prebuilt ibuypower from Best Buy over a year ago, like you I was new to the PC. A year later the only thing that remains stock in it, is my cpu I7-7700k. Everything has been swapped out and customized. Mortal of the story, the prebuilt got me into the PC world, and it is a great option. Yes a prebuilt is more expensive, yes you can build better, but it will get you started. Either take the big leap to building, swap out as you go(expensive option) or leave it alone until it becomes outdated. Cheers! Have fun my dude
---
I wouldn’t suggest the red light green light strat, just use her as a defensive 3 speed
---
Nah he’s referring to the enemy’s strat of throwing in 10 flash bangs
---
She's thick not thicc
---
That’s called TTS t-hunt
---
So we have about the same all sens
---
We will eventually have enough to complete every map
---
It depends on the op but I would say first isn’t worth it. It’s totally your opinion tho
---
Can confirm that it can be done without breaking anything. This is one of my favorite spots on Bank
---
It seems weird how Newcomer would somehow help me at Ranked, since it’s just three maps compared to around 8 or 9. But, I guess at least it’s nice enough where I can learn the basics of the game.
---
Very good, I also did some r6 drawings if you wanna check em out.
---
Maybe don’t be a piece of shit in the chat?
---
A motorcycle one
---
I think you misspelled thick as fat 
---
We’ve had the ability to project images from behind to the front leading to crude “invisibility.” I saw this shit all the way back in 2005, so it isn’t too hard for me to believe we’ve improved that technology enough to make a small drone appear transparent.
---
I really liked it back then
---
Im sold
---
Sorry but that doesn't really help me decide. Maybe stop being such a snowflake?
---
That’s bait 
---
ill def be buying it.  own frost, blackbeard, and jager skins.

Well I must be mega lucky to pull this off every other match

---
Again, notice I said USUALLY, and also this is the first time this has ever happened.
---
That’s why I quit.
---
Well if you do get banned, then its completely deserved. Don't fight toxicity with more toxicity, it's a recipe for disaster. 
---
Nah. It was fun in casual, but hell in Ranked. Like the House map.
---
Yes, love how the head of the hammer trails off so satisfyingly. Great job!
---
Mav: Ill get the hatch guys don't worry about it
---
Sledge: No I have a big hammer
---
Glaz: Ill just sit right here, hope no body has a nitro cell on the hatch. 
---
I think he at least need a LITTLE BIT of tuning. He should counter Lion scans and Airjabs at the most. That would be a nice quality of life buff but that’s about all I would change with Korean Batman
---
I imagine they did this so that new players wouldn't get bored. Like, it takes a decent amount of time just to get to level 30. Getting to level 50 if you're not playing constantly I imagine takes a long while. If I remember correctly I finally got level 50 around the starting half of Y1S3. I started half through Y1S1. Level 30 is a good place for it imo. Ranked is a really good way to play Siege. 
---
Just let the new players experience this game that we love to play. 
---
Video games aren't toxic. People are. We need to teach the future generation better online etiquette.

the idea of using good strats went away the second you picked tachanka 
---
i bet that guy was watching the killcam and just said what the fuck really intensely 
---
People are fucking stupid
---
I'm not going to apologize for acknowledging a major flaws in a game i spent $100 on. I just think it is ridiculous that a company that has one of the largest videogame market shares, years of experience, and a huge production team can't properly fix an issue without making more issues.  I can understand small bugs (I.e. clipping items, or texture glitches) but I can't understand how there are constantly game breaking bugs every fucking season (I.e. Hit reg, peaking bug, rappeling through walls, gun sounds not working). Hell, some of the problems are reoccurring every season. Also, you are just being a stupid asshole that is butthurt about someone pointing out flaws about a game. You are just a dick sucking fan boy who can't bear to see criticism about his favorite game. You need to stop being a butthurt baby back bitch and understand there are issues with the game and that it will be criticized for those issues.
---
On Xbox as well?
---
LMAO
---
Aim high and put some momentum into it.
---
Playing PC at a young age can be fun and exciting, maybe there are better games to play underage than one of the most realistic FPS
---
I usually put mine low with barbed wire on the other side to try and counter maverick, or at least slow someone down/waste a grenade

i wasn’t paying attention, it picked random

---
CZ is good for full auto, but you're straight garbage if you suppress it. SMG-12 comes suppressed, has sights and grips, and is better for roaming. But it's spray is hard to control. But imo it comes down to what gun you like better. 
---
I did that when I first started. You dont need to be like that.

So play ranked lmao

I was playing maestro one time and this fucking Mira put her BM right on my camera breaking it, AND THEN SHE OPENED IT?!?!

I want to play Lion specifically because I love his gun, but there’s kind of a gentlemen’s agreement during ranked not to use him as an op

If people that play xbox report him hell get console banned.

Once had a team surrender after they were up 3-0 on us, after I reconnected to the game. Had net issues on the first 3 rds. Some ppl just do these for the memes.

A single report typically does nothing, why let him last any longer on the game ruining the experiences of other players any longer with the "nah, you report him" when he admited to it in a message?

Casual is True r6

Oh shit! I somehow forgot about the THICCNESS god that is gridlock

They probably have an elite on the way
---
It's called casual for a reason. I'm a high plat and when I get in cas I do things like this because it doesn't matter. If you want a serious experience play ranked or get a 5 man. Also, you went Tachanka why are you complaining? Tachanka is a meme op.

&gt;As an ela main, I don’t think the recoil is a problem, it takes reactionary recoil control to master her weapon which increases the skill gap when using her. 
---
LIE. There is no special skill gap because you can't really control the recoil... It's just too heavy, random and horizontal. Yeah i haven't forgot her goods but the she is limited to what she can do. Her mines are not as good as they used to be, her pistol has more damage then her smg (wtf), let's not talk about that it is not actually good for long range cause you'll die for any AR. She can be swapped to any 3 speed operator or even lesion and HECK even frost just because most operators feel the same now and there are better traps.

Well your a vigil main so understandable but can you give a reason why
---
Considering the different time on the que, i think both OPs had the glitch and a screenshot. Dunno if one stole the idea from the other tho
---
Am playing on GT 630m and you know , it's pretty damn good :|
---
its called an A pose
---
I am not a shotgun person, but yeah ik that, it shouldn't be like that
---
Country's trade stuff dude lol I'm messin
---
Omg! I had the exact same problem before 2 seasons. My ranked k/d dropped from 0.99 to 0.975... because I did a 3 month break. Although I was playing like shit my team won anyways.
---
Weak effort. I have waited 59 mins before.
---
You can literally give her Buck's recoil and it will be better. Or just give it somewhat of a vector recoil. Or just give her a normal recoil but reduce her ammo per mag and possibly damage or rpm a little. I think rpm cause the damage is so low and if it will be nerfed people will put suppressors and will start headshotting everyone
---
Mozlock
---
Any fix???
---
It's so annoying, what platform do you play on 
---
PC. Australian too.
---
I'm ps4 and neu 
---
From a guy to a monkey back to a guy. Cmon ubi
---
I've pre fired malleted before
---
I don't know if it's Ubisoft's new ways of balancing an operator loadout, if you look at Kaid, it's the same thing. 
---
The reason why they give the shotgun DMR an ACOG but not his AUG is because they want to create a 50/50 pick rate environment.
---
That’s not even close to hacks lol if u can’t shoot that fast ur girl is gonna get tired of u quick 😉😂
---
https://youtu.be/pIetNnqVmwk
---
Just use pc  xD
---
Vigil has better guns and mozzie has a better gadget. If you’re playing at a high level/competitiveness then probably mozzie but then again you wouldn’t be asking if you were. In that case get either, just whichever you prefer 
---
But in reality it's 95|5 pick rate... his smg is so bad.
---
They don't allow it. It only works on certain games where the developers allow it. It's disabled on siege, so people buy adapters to use mnk on console siege. Ubisoft has also said it's cheating many times.
---
In English this time? 
---
Try again?
---
Because they're bad and they say "I play this game for fun"
---
Don't tell people what operators/compositions are ideal, in my opinion that is the worst thing you can do to a new player because you're basically telling them "pick this operator to win, all other ops don't matter". Siege obviously doesn't work like that and sometimes you have to change strats. One way you could do it differently is to include a grid of all or some operators and say what their role is, what they're good for and their counters. 
---
He just said 50 levels if you're not playing constantly.
---
People have a life to live, mate.
---
Ugh no
---
They do, it's probably a glitch.
---
That keyboard position swag
---
Whoever you play the most. I’ve got about 700 hours in siege and I haven’t bought an elite skin yet.

I can buy a new phone number for 3,5 usd (converted)

Alright thank you!

Lol nice
---
I somehow get your point... But the thing is that Ubi can't do shit, it's up to Sony address the issue and ban this kind of third-party software for games like overwatch, r6, etc. 
---
Legit looks like a prolapsed asshole
---
Actually... it's exactly why she has 40 rounds for xd. I always aim for the head but sometimes it's not a kill, i either don't tracked too well so i go to the neck or i just miss by a bit.
---
Sometimes the game messes up like that. It’s happened to me several times like i’ll find the obj and it won’t even mark it
---
They do, uplay does not always to be up-to-date with your actual stats, phone app is usually more fast on the update but even that can lag behind
---
yeah what is that?
---
I remember seeing this on the cte 
---
yes
---
I wouldn’t mind making a few examples and have any operator available to request. If you’re really interested in buying some pm me!
---
Dunno maybe 
---
when this happens just switch to a different drone then switch back to yours and it will tag it 
---
Common bug, gets more annoying each update. Just switch a drone and come back and it should work
---
???
---
Didn't have my glasses on so I thought it said Hemorrhoid
---
Yeah,  so the shield doesn't totally cover the body when aiming or standing.  I think you are covered if you crouch though
---
Felt the same after reading this. 
---
.
---
Until I saw his flair as a lion main and immediately resented him and brain-tag him as a toxic unskilled player 😡 
---
hahaha ok, so a level 299 which buys a second account isnt a smurf? or a level 200 diamond who buys a second account isnt a smurf? also would you classify a level 300 who buys a second account but goes straight into ranked with it a smurf?
---
Every distance is turetting  distance for the Lord.
---
Rainbow is on sale right now
---
A combination of damage drop, multiple penetrations that  makes the damage go between 100 and 120. Rare, but happens
---
There has been a massive sale earlier this month so you might have to wait a long time.
---
The problem is I've deranked to the point were players are so unpredictable. 
---
definitely KB&amp;M. pretty obvious 
---
From a competitive standpoint, Zofia is a well-rounded operator and requires team coordination; Echo is not very viable on some maps, some sites, and gamemodes that aren't Bomb, but you get to be as lazy as you want.
---
This. Complete the situations and strive for 100% I did so in each difficulty as to build up my skills in game. Also try Terrorist Hunt (Lone Wolf or "solo game") T.H is a good means of warming up, learning/practicing with new/unfamiliar operators, and can help improve your map knowledge and skill set in game.

What did you make it with

Her easy train headgear is one of the only ones that is fine, but pretty much all the rest have at least 1 issue that wasnt present when initially released. Such as the balaclava having a horrible almost raincoat like texture to it on her Thistle and Frostbitten headgears when it used to be the same fabric texture as her default balaclava. Her Wren headgear having no metallic texture on the gold trim anymore. Her sleeves missing the ribbed texture on the upper arm for every single outfit she has, missing the camo on the hood on the Lilac Splinter and Splittermuster uniforms, or just straight up having extremely low res textures like the Tumbleweed uniform's gloves in 1st person.

Oh so we're playing the "your main is toxic" game yeah?. You pick on people based on their main so that tells me that your are the toxic one. I am not unskilled but I'm not diamond worthy nor toxic so how about you fuck off and go cry somewhere else "Ela main"

Maybe remove the unbalanced maps and stick to the ranked playlist. This and not being able to pick the def obj is my biggest annoyance grinding to level 30 right now. I'm lvl 200 on the xbox but recently switched to pc, but the grind was boring and annoying.

Mf's be thinking you finna ubercharge them
---
T h u m p
---
Not really, sur3 you need to know the basics and then some but thats why you need to be level 30. But ranked is for people that want to play competitive and on a certain skill level or simply get better in the game. If you're new and lack that skill you'll be placed with people with that same skill level(copper/bronze). But imo its the best way to learn the game and improve yourself.
---
The ear cup's not part of the hitbox. It's because the camera's on the bottom of your head, so they can see the top even though you can't see them.
---
lmao
---
I was thinking its madmax
---
Might be console, no tts there
---
Does it really matter? Anything over 60FPS is fine and as long as it's just Siege then what's the big deal? 
---
Just noticed there is an actual real door at the entrance on this picture. On other maps pictures there is just...nothing, no doors or barricades.
---
DONT JUST PUT THE SENSE AS OTHERS SAY INCUDING PROS! Try it out and find what you like and can controll, putting it on max if you cant controll it will fuck you up... 
---
Thanks. That jogged the memory. Updated.
---
Oh I definitely love it when as soon as I get into battle the internet suddenly craps out
---
Why would console users have to learn how to use a m and k in a competitive fps? It's not fair for them to have to worry about other people who have an unfair advantage 
---
🥺 please tell me you sell these
---
just keep practicing, and watch professionals or skilled players on youtube play to see what kinds of angles they hold, what strats they use etc. For placement games, try play with at least one teammate to have someone you can rely on.
---
Auto set it to something and then change what you want

Yes

For me and my friend the Trophy doesn‘t trigger on ps4 :( he has over 120 defends and I have 105 we still playing and hopefully it will trigger the achievement soon :/

Either do a fan fiction that isn't 18+ and get hate for it or do a fan fiction that is 18+ and get hate for it. Personally i vote for "Tachanka x Lion" but do whatever you like
---
If it retained a 740 fire rate then it would be second worst, however due to some Rouge 9 tests it actually appears that it has a fire rate of 780. So now, it’s still the second worst for body shots, but actually quite good for headshots with its *LAZER* recoil, but still not the best. I like using it sometimes for its recoil which is better than the SAWs by a long shot.
---
ADS Time, and i think also the AR has better recoil (cause it's vertical) but i'm not sure i haven't used the lmg in a long time. Also you can use angled grip on it.
---
The reason people call keyboard and mouse an unfair advantage is because it has to be learned, and that’s the argument they throw out; “why should I have to learn to use mouse and keyboard on console just because other people do”

Ace - the whole other team is dead. It doesn't say how much. Overwatch is 6 people and it's not an ace if you kill 5. So even if you 1v1 you can still count it as an ace

If tactical realisim ever became a thing I think calibre based damage might be cool to see in it. P90 would be good against 3 armour and ump would be good against 1 armour.
---
That is not the reason. M and k gives way better control than thumbsticks do and it is way easier to flick and make quick movements. They're consoles and they're meant to be played with their respective controllers

And knowing how these adapters work, you can see that it can't really be detected. The only way to detect these is to watch over the movements and aim of the characters (both uncontrolled and controlled environment), build a huge database from it, and then search for patterns that is unique only to a mouse and/or keyboard. And even if you do this and this could cost a fortune in itself (and i don't even know if it's possible to actually use it on a game), you always have to adapt to the companies making these adapters because they can easily manipulate their software to avoid these detections. That is what happened with Fortnite when they started to do something similar to this (but on a way smaller scale) and XIM just released a hot fix in a day.
---
Is Facebook really trying though? I don't think so

I STILL NEED TO GET THE 10 NITRO CELL KILLS AND THE BREACH CHARGE!!! KILL HELP ME!!

At one point you will come to a point where you realize that Ubisoft are a company and so they will only take actions that bring them the biggest profit. Also they are scared to change operators because they don’t want to loose players.

Both guns are great but after playing couple  of rounds i'll prefer the roni because of  its lower recoil (and my aim sucks in most cases) in the other hand the reload animation of the Commando is so damm good

They said it could not be done, they were wrong.

Just some kid trying to be edgy. You're not allowed to post gamertags here. I don't care because of freedom of speech in America. He can say whatever he wants if you get offended over it thats on you. It's a terrible thing to say, but witch hunting someone for a pretty obvious bait seems ridiculous.

Personally, Black Ice is probably my favorite. I know, everyone is gonna say I’m not original at, but I’ve liked before it was very popular (total fucking hipster/s. God no). I liked Black Ice since almost literally the beginning of the game, when you could buy it with reknown. I have it for almost default ops. 
---
I think it should be. But considering that is not the only mechanic I feel it pretty unbalanced. But idk, the thing is that if I would want to play pure FPS I would go csgo or any other, I expected more impact from operators abilities after 80 hours playing. 
---
Anyway you probably right.
---
A: you would have missed, B: the damage trigger on the animation wasnt complete. In the end you were dead either way. If you do hit somewhere it would kill providing the damage trigger completes.
---
He said that straight up, no one provoked him to say that.

Commando 9 100%

They have been able to disable it before but then the problem is back. It’s a lot like cat and mouse.

He's a troll. You took the bait pretty hard by the looks of it. Regardless this breaks the subreddits guidelines of "no call to action or witchhunting".

Concerning bugs this season runs better than the last one. I literally stopped playing a few days after my ranking cause I couldn't take it anymore... Buggy hitboxes, buggy sounds, buggy Nomad... I see at least a step forward in the new season.

Will people stop asking this? Just search for it, it’s been asked countless times
---
dude i wanna see more of this shit. i might start posting my own, it looks really cool. wanna see someone render a whole map
---
What i think this might be is that they changed the lean camera position to the centre of the head instead of completely to the edge, where more of your head and body sticks when peeking creating a situation like this. they did it to fix lean spam but created issues like this.
---
and i am pretty sure the kill cams are bugged so no point watching them.

She might: I haven't had a chance to use her yet.

I'm guessing someone has done that to you.

I don't know what you mean by "took the bait". I just saw what I saw and reported him.

I dont have a preference :/

I understand and I am with you. Usually I don’t get spawnpeeked because I am a long time player and I know what to look out for. But when I get killed it is always my fault. This is just part of the game. Be prepared for runouts when repelling that is all I can say. Put a claymore or an air jab and pray. How would you fix it?
---
Exactly so why doesn’t Ubi do anything about it or even try to do something about it

If I just sent you proof of my diamond rank then why would I lie about lesser ranks😂
---
Makes me wonder, could they make a 360 auto-knife hack that made you melee anyone in range at max range with auto aim?
---
Me either

He said what he said trying to get a reaction out of you. You're giving him the attention he wants, and further spreading his message by posting it here.

I thought a hs was 50x ? Nether the less it’s the same principle

Yea

He can go 3 speed with grenades, can use the German shotgun on attack and had the smg 11+mp5k  before mute 
---
Soo, mozzie is supposed to be the second smollest op in rainbow six, and is the shortest boyo in siege...so he gets bullied by the oof queen ela in this
---
Also, you don't seem to understand what tracing is. I'm not holding a piece or paper over a screen and TRACING the outlines. It's a free hand drawing, try it yourself first, then @ me again.

I get the joke your not alone

Holy hell people the joke is that videos of this kind of thing come up with Ash so often it's regular gameplay, not the exception.

I came looking for booty.

Hold your horses. It is only 1 minute and I had to wait up to 5 minutes before I found a full squad.

Spawnpeeking isnt toxic, when you reach the higher ranks you get used to it and realize that they generally arent unfair you just have to not walk blindly out of spawn
---
Youve clearly never been to a Melbourne suburb then. Its like this 24/7 there
---
Whaaaaat I thought my internet suddenly got all shitty. You’re saying something in the patch is making people lag more?
---
You may not call it insignificant. Imagine a 1 vs 1 bomb retake action by the defender where the defused is planted. 3 Entrances locked down by one operator.
---
This season is such a mess
---
I haven't played since the new ops came out but I've been seeing way too many videos that are similar to this.. Ubi pls
---
I waited 20 :c
---
She first looked like a 70 year old woman, now she looks like she can’t even count to 10

Is it universal though?

Is that 15,000? I have over 60,000 and the bike hasn’t left!
---
She looks like a fourteen year old girl 
---
i dont think i have had access to it since the second update after purchase. i dont use it unnecessarily so i dont think its a chat ban?
---
Why not? Siege actively lets you vary on your scope and grip options, even though many would consider you foolish to choose a short sight over an ACOG as an attacker. Angled grips and vertical grips offer playstyle variation, without being overtly balance-breaking. I don't really see how subtle incentives for forgoing attachments would be against siege's "identity".
---
It's a 25% decrease in hipfire spread for a tiny dot that will sometimes give you away if playing poorly, but OP obviously isn't as they are careful to move the sight onto the wall in front of them. 
---
Thanks for flagging this with us! :) We are testing the fix for it in the Test Server at the moment (also happens with Mira's mirrors), so if all goes well, it should be in the next update. Check out the latest Test Server's patch notes here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/b14pqz/march\_14\_2019\_test\_server\_patch\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/b14pqz/march_14_2019_test_server_patch_notes/) 
---
Is Cicada STILL going on? I stopped watching the season because it’s getting to just be the same thing over and over again
---
Mozzie is really versatile right now and buck is great
---
Yes, and when I beat my friends in a 1v1 I always say you lost against a deaf kid. 
---
Same I also like it but I’ve encountered people who think it’s absolute garbage.
---
Shotguns like Ela’s don’t take a whole lot of skill. At the rate you can put bullets down range with that thing you’re bound to kill *something*
---
Yurei head. All I gotta say.
---
I think I got level 90 on my smurf from like 3 weeks of playing 
---
Hope this isn't weird. I saw all the chibi's made and you have real talent. I'd definitely buy these. Great job
---

---
Dang that’s messed up
---
Ok I agree with that 
---
"You don't need to be more accurate, just fire more bullets"
---
why are you playing mp5 w/o acog
---
Second account doesnt mean a smurf. Playing on second account (or 3rd, 4th, ... ) for whatever reason is absolutly fine and there is no reason to flame people for it if they play to their actuall skills and tries to win normally. You can for example play with 2 different group of friends and so on. If you always try to win and play as you can, there is nothing wrong with it (and because of certain randomness with matchmaking, different group of people and so on), those accounts can even have different ranks even when you do as much as you can.
---
Smurfing is having different account which you troll with, throw games in order to be deranked and roflstomp low rank players, derank on purpose to then join game with others to boost their rank and other matchmaking abuse. And stuff like that.
---
TLDR smurfing is for toxicity and abusing. Playing on multiple account doesnt mean you are doing that
---
No team killing ( usually)
---
LoL
---
Since you have a disadvantage when it comes to footsteps and explotions, do you have a specific playstyle? 
---
From pro league pack collection.  You cant get this skin now. Sorry :(
---
I’m in the same position on PC and it has been so bad I’ve dropped from gold 1 all the way to bronze 1, getting above 10k per game but still losing because people don’t play properly. Then, the lower you go the worse it becomes. I’ve managed to get to silver 1 but my MMR is so bad that my chances of getting plat is very slim
---
Forgot discussion flair

You get to experience the wonderful side of siege, where toxicity has no limits and you'll be told to uninstall fare more times than you can count.
---
Scruffy
---
Yeah. It looks like future Grace as Cicada somehow has come back in time now though. Cicada is a decent villain. I think directing choices really screwed Chris Klein along with the filler episodes padding out Cicada's arc. If it was all condensed in a half season arc, it would have been so much better. The flash is general has fallen a long way. This arc with Nora has me face palming so hard. I stopped caring about her once she continued working with her father's greatest enemy even after finding out he murdered her grandmother. Nora is just an idiot at this point. 
---
Who here also mains Valkyrie?
---
Irl there isn't really such a thing as a "fast reload mag" for standard firearms.. how quickly you reload depends on how quickly you can drop the empty mag and put a new one in. So that would be a wonky COD like feature. Although I could get down for some mag-extention attachments

No to me he seems good he has the speed to rush and the firepower to back it up the tradeoff is of course his lower rate of fire but when you pair the m249 with smoke bolts and fire bolts and glaz it works very well the only challenge really is the clutches but even then its not that bad overall he is pretty balanced
---
He's definetly an operator that wouldn't really suffer much of he got this change due to his playstyle. 
---
The SAS shotty is statistically bad when you compare DPS numbers, but what it excels at is sending one guy to Hell instantly, or, in case of Sledge, denying you a hammer kill on anything smaller than a Rook with a plate.

Their entire job is to defend, if you expect them to let you walk right in the building unchallenged you're off your rocker.
---
If they're defending well. You just need to attack better. Complaining because you lack the ability to drone out peekers and check angles before running from cover just serves to highlight a lack of care on your part.

Honestly hate when people complain about spawn peeks. Drone call out where people are spawn peeking. The only real exceptions I'd say would be bank or any spawn rushes where you spawn and can be shot almost instantly. It's a little better now that casual can choose spawn but bank is a wildland. Spawn peeks happen it's part of the game just don't rush blindly into the open and you won't get peeked that often

The players aren’t client side. What you see here is the killcam being bugged. On her screen she saw you standing there with your back towards her. This isn’t a big issue and if you ever think something is wrong just by watching the kill cam don’t 100% believe it. Kill cams are unreliable in detailing exactly how you died atm.

You should take a look at which ops don't really relate to their gadget or themselves and change them up a bit. (P.S. Make mozzie's a spider)

I do agree with you that they should make an effort at least, but but I do see their point of not willing to waste money, because those adapters are patched 6 hrs later and the past development and money are going down the drain.
---
I think a joined approach of game and console developers could be at least something to start with.

---
A suppressor does lower damage because it uses subsonic rounds. If you use a suppressor without subsonic rounds the gun would still be as loud as a jackhammer. 
---
Muzzle breaks don’t decrease velocity or damage. One thing siege has wrong is that a muzzle break should increase flash and noise, but in the game it decreases flash and has no effect on noise.
---
Grips are tricky. In real life, vertical grips and angled grips are both used for recoil control, but vertical grips are better for controlling rapid fire while it can be easier to aim at small and specific targets with an angled grip.
---
In game, a vertical grip does not reduce your ability to lift a gun in game(as you said it does). In real life though, the increased forward weight could make it harder to quickly angle properly.
---
One way to make attachments actually have a disadvantage is the calculate weapon weight and have attachments have a negative effect on weapon handling, but that could get complex really fast.
---
Imagine just standing there and having to accept that a korean naval seal is about to fuck your day up

I'd argue it makes things more cat and mouse, not less. You have to drone out peekers and methodically clear before entry. If you just Ash rush in you'll get your head taken off.

Because making overweight people look normal is just sick, it's promoting extremely unhealthy lifestyle. If we make being overweight a norm, we as species, are fucked. I understand that there are some that cannot control their weight because of medical reasons, but in no way they would be able to apply to SASR or any other special forces. Making operator overweight is just bowing down to the PC culture that is killing the internet.

They seriously need to fix group teamkilling in this game. The fact that a group of 2 or 3 people can just take turns killing someone who basically can't get them back more than once without getting banned is so shit. I would suggest making teamkilling penalties apply to the whole group, so if different members tk you once each they all get banned. 
---
Fairly sure you mean 4.0x on headshot, because was it 40x that would need a 3dmg weapon to kill. and you deal 5 dmg throwing gadgets at someone so 3 dmg is impossible. Nice explanation thoe.

Its either a shotgun or cav stop posting these false bugs just to get attention.

If by tunnel visioning you mean barricading the entire team into OBJ, been there done that many seasons ago when I didn't know the map, didn’t know the operators and even did not know the difference between secure area and bomb modes - wondering why sometimes there was one bomb and other times there were two.

And those players aren't new. Mostly level 100 and beyond.

I stopped watching during the season with DeVoe, Season 1 was BY FAR the best season. There is no competition when it comes to that, season 2 was ok, and it kept getting worse and worse each season.

For me this depends on only 16:9 but not on 4:3

Bit sorry to beat a dead horse but, any progess on the game freezing, mostly on dual core cpus?

Except he was making a joke, as he clarified and it could've ended with "oh my bad" rather than "I'm conditioned to believe everyone is an asshole all the time."

easiest way to summarize it is to say it increases your armor rating by 2 (so a 1 armor with rook armor takes damage like a 3 armor)

And I didn't know it was a joke, as I clarified. I wouldn't type out an impassioned response like that if I had known it was a joke.

And still no Vega GPU fix...

I've never been shot from that position to be honest, but i don't like the fact that people are using exploits, glitches etc. and are complaining if they get caught. But maybe me and my team are just too fair for this game...

I'd have loved to have seen the reactions afterward!

no, it is 40x. You just can't headshot with any gadgets or explosives or shotguns.

Probably the worst part of this game are that's like this. You're online to play a game for a few rounds to unwind and you got needy twats like this desperate for attention.

TBH, sounds like he's got a crush on you and doesn't know what to do with it. 
---
Copper is the lowest ranking, and the red dot is the worst sight in the game
---
1/5 assumes that every outbreak item is equally rare which I don't think is necessarily true but is probably the case, yeah. 
---
People don’t like the red dot.  I don’t like the red dot.  Some pros still use the red dot.  When I see someone with a red dot I think “why the fuck is he using a red dot”
---
Please some of us on PC (uplay) have a problem with season pass4 that was eliminated after the last update, no more season pass for us, but still limited edition skins and R6 point....very disappointed and UBI support don't respond to question
---
Keep us updated! Looks like a fun little pass time

He describes it as a "gift to the community."
---
I’m down for some ranked if your curious I’m average gold 3-2 so I’m not really good though :/
---
I was kinda hoping the gadget would crawl out of the helmet and jump at the camera. Very cool nonetheless!
---
A copper is the lowest rank in the game, most people in copper aren’t really good, similar in other games to a noob 
---
Yeah it was like 6-7 months ago
---
As soon as Ubi rereleases one of these skins it kills the "Limited time only!" attraction of these packs so it seems unlikely that it'll be a solid business move. 
---
She is okay, the bad thing with her is the weapons and I feel you have way better options for roamers who not only have better weapons, but offer more utility for the team
---
Are you claiming to be put with sweaty players in ranked or casual? if ranked: of course its try hard no one wants to lose their ranked. and in casual: people are generally not sweaty in casual. They are just straight good players, its no easy to turn that off. just because someone has many kills in casual or spawn peeks doesnt mean theyre sweating. 
---
This has happend to Indian R6 players as well. Since 4Months i believe they give me site to go to vendors to check but i couldnt find the vendors.

how did they not hear the defusing sound? thats the first thing i hear from seven miles away lmao
---
I don't play points on. IDK how many friendly drones I've taken out. FeelsBadMan
---
that guy didn't do it
---
he didn't do it
---
Whatc
---
I have downed and killed a Twitch using her drone once. It was hilarious.
---
And you are?
---
Shotguns dont get the same headshot multiplyer as other guns, so you can headshot but down someone with them
---
I hope this is a Hammer and Scalpel joke. 
---
that is the best charm... wish it was universal 
---
Copper is the worst rank in the game, and the red dot is the worst sight in the game.
---
Again, I take this, which is more so just a obscure or anamalous continuation of the vaulting mechanic that can be easily fought by droning out, tracking, avoiding the area, pressuring, etc., over something detrimental like the shield glitch, etc. where fundamentals have to get changed, i.e. headshots have to be avoided as they'll be blocked. At most, this could be labeled an exploitation of the vault system rather than a glitch. 
---
In Ranked, especially in the Plat'/Diamond, expect this or far worse and scummier tactics, cheats, lag switches, etc. as some will go to far worse lengths to pad their stats' and Rank.
---
When will it be okay?
---
Join my discord.
---
This is my favorite map. I hope they don't ruin it with the rework.
---
I'm gonna miss throwing a grenade in the drone hole to take out a Gu, Frost mat, Ela mine, all in one throw.
---
And missing putting a magpie there on defense to grab said grenades.
---
It was a fun glitch. 
---
Ash too op, please remove all optics from both her primaries 
---
one thing i always wanted was a 2d side scroller using the pixel sprays from overwatch, this looks cool too. bring to iphone if it ever becomes something

Level 258

What?

When alpha packs were first introduced most of the legendaries that weren’t solid color skins already existed but on another weapon, these skins aren’t the only example of this

true tho

Ok, carry on

How would I do that without making a new post? I got a reply from the mod and he said he’ll try to undelete it and if that happens I’ll edit the comment.

My friend mains maestro, and we were playing defense, I was using Vigil, so they knew I was somewhere in the room, notherless they were being pressured to run in by the maestro cam, they forgot all about me and I sprayed them down as they entered
---
Was just memeing on all the post recently saying a weapon skin is the best and they wish was universal. The joke is all charms are universal. 
---
Rip primary 
---
Ohh ok kkkkkkk

Mozzie, his gadget is great and you should just unlock him for his reload animation

I better not catch that on ranked
---
https://ibb.co/nLRsJPS
---
That’s an interesting idea actually, il try it
---
Absolutely. Just code it to detect enemy players within knife range, and add aimbot to it. You could have it on button press or automatic.
---
Or he could just not be a dick for no reason and leave the blitz alone 
---
lol
---
Well, not everybody was at Gamescom at the same day or time. There were atleast 30 Siege-cosplayers at GC last year, hopefully we will get more on one picture this year :D 
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yo, finish it
---
I know right? Other games have a option for you to buy lootboxes, alpha packs? Nah in game currency only. Other games force merch down your throat, R6? We have to beg and plead until year 4 when these chibi are being expanded upon. 
---
Defuseris usually my primary focus during defuse phase.like i pick an angle that's exclusively the area around it and just wait.
---
This is awesome

Don’t question the lord’s methods.

Depends on what they can do with BattlEye. If they could, then they honestly should.
---
That's kinda toxic.

thx ubi, and plz fix shields thx
---
Back in the first few seasons of siege I used to use the 5-7 on ash and thermite suppressed and it took 2 shots to take out any stock cam from any distance. At first it blew my mind, but after a while I took it as a challenge to beat my friends at knocking out cams with their 1 shot. I lost that challenge a lot.
---
maybe :)
---
unfortunately if he ever tried to make money off it ubi would sue him to death
---
Breaking story: Alpha pack "legendaries" are a scam. In other news, water is wet...
---
Hayai!
---
you can just upload the image to imgur then send the direct link of that image. 
---
I once killed a Twitch main with their own drone.  He got trapped inside frost mat.  I zapped him while he was helpless.  I got so much hate mail from him my sides were in orbit.
---
Well I haven't been able to  in my years of seige so i don't honestly know

this is a crossup i did not expect but am loving

&gt;everyone actually has 120 health, but you can only see 100.
---
Does this mean you see it as a percentage or that it only changes on screen if below 100?
---
Open bob send vagene
---
Finka is "the medic" on the attacking side because she can revive downed teammates and give teammates a temporary health boost. The TEMPORARY health boost is (I think) because if an operator could give attackers health for the whole round it would be OP.
---
It's easy to say that now that they're no longer available, but Ubisoft never said any items in the digital content store had an expiration except for the pro league sets.  Also, you should come up with something better than insults.
---
Agreed.
---
Just got black ice for glaz  on 8th alpha pack  level 42 . But yeah I get your point they are unbalanced
---
Loser faggot noob
---
4 speed
---
REEEEEEEEEEE THAT WALL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
Thank you for trying to un glitch yourself rather than exploiting the unfair advantage you were given 
---
Well played
---
I quit the queue after 10
---
One dokkaebi and you are all doomed
---
I haven't made a complete decision but I feel like lesion maybe the way to go for me. 
---
Is there any official mention to the issues we are facing with directional audio anywhere? This is starting to trigger me lately and I feel it isn't mentioned enough here...
---
True
---
Damn just reset que every 1-2 minutes 
---
I suggest Buck if you can control the recoil on his guns. Frost if you wamma learn where is the best place for placing traps.
---
I guess they finally got rid of it? Not sure. It was 100% still there not long ago. Even Bartlett is still in there right now.
---
Didn't actually think of that myself and it worked 🙄 love you bud. 
---
I'm probably going to buy lesion and combine the roaming and anchor strats to get the most out of my strengths. 
---
Fuze pls?
---
Well there is a reason why I haven't played r6 since they came out
---
You’re Welcome

---
It's not an actual post, it's a cross-post. And military trivia on a subreddit made about a game made from a military book is not so unrelated.
---
Year I'd the drone
---
I would like to see *DETAILS* next 
---
(Glaz if you don’t get that reference)
---
Yeah but we want to max out the que time 
---
I expected that. Sad one
---
Who did you kill?
---
My favorite bullshit recently: I had a match where my screen would freeze if Jager was on my screen.
---
Not like crash, the entire game would just hiccup and freeze for about a second if Jager was visible for me on either team.
---
Normally I just yell "how was that not a headshot" but I don't think it really matters how you pronounce it.
---
At the top of the screen it says that he/she has all five teammates. The character screen shows 4/5
---
But you're playing Rook.
---
One of these things is not like the other...
---
...one of these things sure as fuck doesn't belong...
---
Wait.. I wansnt  looking or serious answers.

Thank you!
---
I don´t really know if it´s a bug ingame but it seems u get kicked by it so it could be a bug to fix for ubisoft post if it happens to people.
---
No because his team his orange 
---
Just posted it now to r6 reddit. There's a gun skin for his AR to go with the set too
---
silverleaf looks great though, legendary skins don't necessarily mean a flashy gun, i think this is a really nice skin tbh
---
Once they are hacked, they are permanently outlined in white if they are in sight.
---
I'm basically stuck with 2 decisions, it's either the rival 650 by steelseries or the corsair dark core rgb
---
Last player alive, do you think he should be roaming?
---
They should fix it to where even if the swipe hits them there dead right then instantly. I’ve have a friend and I witnessed he knifed and hit a maverick it even made a sound but did no damage.
---
i picture the shock drone in the middle kinda like picking between twitch and mozzie
---
I wanna play this. Please update us on further advances in testing thank you!
---
The intro was cool!
---
Moot 
---
Cuz he smol boi, and boi supposed to be tall like fuze and sledge
---
But this looks like it belongs in common. Something like black ice should be legendary. Something that makes it stand out.
---
But you’re right
---
If u place her special on the stairs behind you it’s a anti roamer 
---
U be soft (Ubisoft)
---
More like U be hard (Ubihard)
---
I’m a simple man. I see a blitz die and get salty in chat, I upvote. 
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
I guess she can throw her gadget on a way roamers go through and slow them down. 
---
Bruh mutes attacking
---
Was a very rushed job tbh lol
---
Yes. I was wondering why. Sound is nearly the same. Animations are relatively equally visible. Major difference is the defuse distance here can be stretched a little farther than in CoD, and the defuser in R6 can be placed anywhere, not just on the bomb site like the bomb in CoD. Unless OP means it’s harder since you die quicker.
---
She's spoooky
---
Oh I am in fact stupid
---
Lol, The game disconnected us after 59:59. We actually want hit the 2 hour record but the game didn’t allowed it.
---
Border was what i got it on, security room they only nether through 2 doors. I just played kaid and bandit
---
Good idea, but I doubt Ubisoft would ever do that.
---
Im afraid it’s terminal I’m sorry
---
That's a good idea. Restore a little balance. 
---
Using this as context for that video i uploaded earlier lol
---
You almost got TKed there
---
I love that wallpaper in the background.
---
There's a difference between I don't want to be involved and actively ruining someones fun.
---
If you're one defender that doesn't want to participate just camp the objective room.

Suggestion:Could you make this kind of like a t hunt and people come from both angles you have to shoot
---
Yeah I’m looking at your work again and you put great detail in the wall textures and other minor things not everyone will notice and I yeah I agree I might not be _that_ dedicated. Good job. 
---
That's lag mate, on your end I think 
---
Rook mine btw
---
it definitely is not, there is a reason it was removed from PL
---
Fuck off with that
---
Nah its cool
---
The community is so bad man, some of the comments on the post are bad too. 
---
i feel your pain. last black ice i got was a duplicate, but not only that, dupe for a gun i don't even use.
---
r/SuddenlyGay
---
Something similar happened in a final killcam on kafe with a mozzie. He got fragged and clipped through another wall
---
Oof
---
Fuze mains come get your holy water lol 
---
I like it a lot.
---
/s?
---
Lag on your end bud. The red icon shows that your connection dropped
---
This is a skin lol
---
I would like to know how you found this, this is, this is just completely fuckin EPIC!!
---
They should give all yhe acogs they took and put all of them on cavs pistol.
---
Exactly why I'm switching to PC. Immature little children.
---
Ok but what does that mean. It’s pretty unusual for people to just go nuts. Usually it only happens if you make a bad play or look clueless. 
---
Username checks out
---
3 words, *speed is key*
---
It's happened to me more times than I can think. I learn of these things through enemy players killing me from them haha.
---
Its how 8 learnt to spawnpeek with TACHANKA in certain places on some maps
---
Keep playing ranked. It seems youre above your intended rank. You will most likely rank down due to being lucky during placements. Eventually your rank will stagnant and youll be in the rank youre supposed to be in. From there your tactics will (hopefully) be even with other players. And then you can start learning what ranks directly above you do and you can either climb or stay where you at. Its how most comp games work.
---
Lmfao fuck i forgot
---
I just completed all of mine as well yesterday. Congrats I know how much of a grind that protect hostage on T Hunt is.
---
I'm a little more experienced but I have the same problem.  Idk man. I never do that well I'm placements tho
---
I was Second he was first.  I clutched and missed a couple rounds the first time, that's the story. 
---
Because, while some of the new legendaries (and plasma pink) are admittedly nice, most legendaries are garbage, since the alpha packs only money making purpose is to trick people out of renown (so they cant spend it on new ops and need a season pass, or buy seasonal skins with credits)? At least its a repurposed epic from different operators.
---
The spetznas legendary VSN SMG has the legendary skin "Politsiya". Which is  also a **rare** skin for their SASG shotgun.

Drax on the fridge 
---
There's probably YouTube videos of this somewhere, but I learnt of this from a casual game where a cav made her way up there and I watched her with my drone 
---
So your a mnk user on console?
---
Ya I learn a couple of things from enemies too, that's how learning strategies in siege works, or coming up with them your self
---
Well, this is incredible. I have never seen this
---
Nice job!
---
He is not me that’s why I sent him the pathetic message.
---
I'm gonna start using it. Thanks!
---
Play in 5 mans, then you can do really silly strats, it’s great
---
Capitao needs something in his life after ubi took his rework away.
