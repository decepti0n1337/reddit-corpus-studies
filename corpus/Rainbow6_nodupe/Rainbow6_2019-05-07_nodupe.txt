Sadly for Android only, sorry.

Thank you!!

Oof
---
yep quality enough
---
Thanks! You can find my comment regarding the download.
---
Seems too strong
---
Try the DMR with a holo or reflex when your trigger finger is fast enough. The RoF feels near unlocked and 69 damage with a 20 round mag is pretty dam good. I would avoid the acog on buck in general because using the shotgun in ads with an acog is kinda silly.
---
Hitting you up.
---
( VIGIL )
---
if you get "Luisoned" and leave while downed you should be auto interrogated. 
---

---
The game already tracks the difference between a normal pistol vs the "Luison" and weather the interrogation was started or not, so its hopefully doesn't need a full feature add just a few checks if the personal leaving/disconnected was downed by cav or not.
---
Enough quality is is.
---
Don’t down teammates when they don’t want to plant. Just deal with it. They don’t deserve to be downed just because they didn’t plant. You might’ve made that newcomer not want to play Siege anymore because of your toxicity(excuse me for the lack of another less harsh word). You don’t deal with toxicity with more toxicity. Other than that, have fun with the game! :)

*BEGINS TO PONDER ABOUT OBTAINING ACOG ONCE MORE*
---
Will I ever be able to set this as my wallpaper, it’s amazing
---
Because you stay incredibly still
---
I really don’t know, I think it also depends a lot on how the adapter is seen by the console iself. If it’s something like Generic USB, then I don’t know if you could tell if you were using an adapter or just an external hdd, let’s say. But if it was something like “Super duper MNK adapter”, then yea, I think that Ubisoft should immediately contact Sony and Microsoft and try and talk to them.
---
Holy shit it's been 2 years
---
No they shouldn't. People are allowed to be assholes. I don't agree with people slinging slurs and all that bullshit, but I also don't agree with censoring and banning them. That's just beyond fucked up. I don't care if they insult me, my race, you, your race, whatever. They're an asshole, yeah. But they shouldn't be banned. Eventually if they keep it up, they'll just be talking to themselves because everyone else will have muted them.
---
then vault of the 90 degree edge of the helicopter
---
The point is that Ubisoft doesnt like Jagger at all, and are trying to nerf him, but dont know how.
---
It's an Android app. If you're on iOS, then you can't.
---
Just report them for rule number three.
---
my man predicted the future
---
Too strong? Are you actually serious? You think getting auto interrogated is too strong compared to leaving the game to avoid it? It should be “too strong” since you shouldn’t leave the game downed in the first place!
---
darn twitch is a retard
---
Well, Ubisoft can't do anything unless they contact Sony and Microsoft about it, it's a third party adapter, that connects to the CONSOLE, Ubisoft doesn't own or have authority over the console, just the game it has released.
---
Don't get me wrong, I found the muzzle brake ugly as hell on pistols.
---
I really wish the R6 Dev could do something about this. They should keep the muzzle brake equipped recoil pattern as default pattern, and convert muzzle attachment as cosmetic items. Then only leave two options available, 1) Stock version 2) Silencer version, nothing else. 
---
As a result, the silencer version would receive a buff due to muzzle brake equipped recoil pattern as default pattern.

And you comment this because... why did you comment this for again?
---
Toxicity in rainbow six? Nah.
---
Its just a joke cause of the word deplorable.
---
You shouldn’t always interrogate a downed person, there are other factors and half the time you will get killed for an interrogation.
---
Checkmate, ive been in that situation 2x and killed them while blind after 360ing around them
---
Fuuuuuuck, guess I know what my next phone will be
---
i love it great job 10/10 i'm an iq main so yeah
---
Why so many fidget spinners?
---
The game has plenty of flaws, I just don't care why you quit. Everybody posts on reddit about the reason they quit a certain game as if anybody really cares.
---
I know
---
You're right. The sight of Blitz causing people to commit suicide is pretty overpowered.
---
Remindme!

what ? O.o

What is rule 3?

The SMG 11 had an acog...and a muzzle break. Rip
---
1. this is why you shouldn’t play hostage. even without this glitch hostage is a garbage mode 
---
2. it’s a glitch. not a hack. you can’t get banned for doing a glitch. they could lose some MMR or something but banning people for using a glitch is ridiculous
---
Ah ok
---
Can confirm
---
Yay! How do I get?
---
Whats unecessary about the joke, then? It doesnt make any statements. Just a reference.
---
you better have a bearing-9 as your secondary

Anyone else look at the picture without reading the title and thought it was a drawing/painting of IQ?

I have gotten 3 of those! And countless 4k's.

I can relate. Level 66 and still can’t get any more than 3 kills
---
i feel that way
---
Upvote for visibility.
---
Yes, but what if you do want to interrogate him/her, and he/she leaves. Let’s say in a different world, everybody leaves before getting interrogated, and your rules applied in that fictitious world where there is no auto interrogation. What happens? Caveira loses her main ability? Your answer does not make sense. Please explain why it would be a good idea. Let me say this again that leaving the game when you are downed shouldn’t happen.
---
Any constructive criticism?
---
? (i'm new to reddit)
---
Lol!
---
Show us your angle. It’s only the kill cam. Im pretty sure your perspective shows his head
---
&gt;Yeah, rainbows community needs a lot of fixing, especially on console (I know, I’m a peasant. Student wages are shit tho)
---
Not a console players here, but console ftw. Would deadass buy if I had the cash.
---
&gt; and Ubisoft needs to make a lot more bold choices.
---
Yep. Take try leap and just do it. Better that than listen to posts on give Thermite and iq and cap grenades, and buff BB.

I'm pretty sure he wouldn't done this without that shield :D

Well destiny and the division wont help you at all in this game but as for advise i'd suggest to use the british and french ops and focus on playing the bomb game mode. As for warming up play sone terrorist hunt and secure area

Lmao the vigil actually made me chuckle

I domy play this game what happened exactly
---
I've blown Cavs head off a few times sneaking up behind me on defense
---
As a Vigil main, that’s happened to me as well.

I totally deserve it though, for not saying shit and just sneaking up on people.

You do not have access to moving as slowly as a controller user can.. there is basically an infinite amount of speeds you can walk with a controller.. with a mouse and keyboard on console there is only 2.

Yes on PC you can alt walk.. but you can't on console mnk.

Yes

I just got a hyperx cloud flight. Bit pricey 130 USD I think. Not felxng here k. They have good mic quality and the sound is better than my wired raver kraken. Tit uses a USB traniter thing and also has a way to wire it (for aduoi only). Which you can plug into your phone.
---
not only is this a meme (which is against the sub rules) but it’s also a repost. good job

nah he just steal the pic like [this , its just under in the gallery](http://www.thumbnailtemplates.com/thumbnails/index.php?id=82) , pretty sad almost no one check source those days : (

They just have to build a ladder out of furniture to get in

That kinda ruins the purpose of sneaking.
---
It just seems really silly to me. In resident evil you’re supposed to be the only hope the world has but you can’t run and fire your gun at the same time. That’s just plain stupid. If your going to try and pass a game off as super tactical and invoke all these special forces, they gotta be able to jump. Seal team six is not made up of people who can’t jump. The gign doesn’t only have cripples. I just don’t get why they can’t have people jump in game.
---
Managed to drop to copper on PC.  
---
Literally did not feel like Copper until I was 20 matches deep into Copper. Hell, the trip to Copper didn’t feel different at all.

You’d be surprised how often this happens to me in casual (or used to at least). I don’t know it it’s for all caveiras, but when I’m silent stepping around, I generally shut it off near teammates that aren’t facing me because there have been too many times they turned around and fired first before realizing just because I was too close. Pros and cons to being spooky
---
Casual just picks random people for matches, if you want something more fair, go play ranked.
---
hey , he doenst monetize it but advertise r6scredits resell website and when he get caught just happen to advertise is merch , sick

But even in this case, you, probably, would can program a MnK device for changing character speed with mouse wheel(or keyboard wheel), like in Escape from Tarkov.

Because, I think, MnK device can emulate stick position, and nothing can stop it from making different software-side borders for it's values.

So true. I feel like I would have at least remembered I owned it though. It’s a solid rifle though. As for OTS, I just don’t use glaz a lot.
---
No it doesn't break anything at all, I wasn't meaning to act like they are super exclusive skins, I definitely wouldn't try to show off skins to a sub full of veteran players who probably got some amazing collections, I just meant I was lucky that I got 2 skins I liked for 2 Operators I used. Sorry if it came off in a attempt to brag, that was not the intention.
---
No outline nibbas
---
I appreciate that my good man, I happen to be a mav/fuze/thatcher main myself on attack side as well :) I'm 100 hours deep into the game and love this game even more than when I started

Ahh plone, always get excited to play on that mep

Same way on PlayStation, once you get to copper, you cannot leave

I constantly have audio glitches. My gun won't sound, my footsteps won't, footsteps will be double volume, its a mess. Between that, and rampant glitches on individual matches, people spamming shit that makes it so you can't even see them, but they can one tap you, it's a disaster right now. I stopped playing because it's pissing me off more than being enjoyable anymore.
---
I can only dream
---
Use the rest of the season to work on getting better the ranks will be a mess next season.  And ever one is pretty much stuck at this point.
---
Ikr
---
And I thought I was the only one who thought this game felt borked hitreg-wise since BH...
---
I believe Zoe Love created a whole bundle, w guns for various def ops. I have one such for mute
---
I support this idea, we need night versions for the new maps, just like the first two years of siege, no one is talking about this but the creative development of new maps is based on "proleague players opinion" and not the players that were since day one playing the game for fun. Many would say that night maps are broken but this is just an excuse to make the game easier and more appealing to new casual players, this needs to change
---
&gt;Save
---
I don't remember. (i was making a joke)
---
Play a few casual matches focused on ONLY getting headshots. What screws me up a lot of the time is that I'm not acting as quickly as I can. Focus next on reaction time. Try holding an angle and shooting as quickly as you can when you see anything move.
---
If you help your team it’s fine
---
play terrorist hunt and really focus on heads till you want to kill yourself
---
Why would you want to play in borderless? Full screen runs a lot better. Is there any specific reason?
---
Play any operator you wont and dont let other people control how you play video games on your time off.
---
If your in a team and they want to play a specific strat sure switch up the operators a bit(need a hard breacher, need a support etc) 
---
Shields have advantages like not getting shot directly but it also have a lot of disadvantages like no sealth, only pistols, have to hipfire most of the time etc.. Playing shields isnt a auto win like most people make it out to be and in higher levels a lot of teams know how to deal with shields just like the other operators.
---
Space martian for the famas
---
Cool mines the sharks hot for almost every shotgun I really want them to add it for the bosg
---
No, you’re only bad if you don’t help the team, Shield ops aren’t the easiest to use but with practice they can be really good for the team
---
The amount of drones that *weren’t* used in this video hurts.
---
You think that's bad, my friend was holding a room with Rook in the same room the whole match.  An attacker runs in and stands next to my friend, Rook kills the guy and saves my friend, so my friend is startled by the gunshots, did apparently not notice either our teammate or the attacker, looks at Rook, and sprays him for a good couple seconds spending almost a full 30 round magazine, cause potato aim on a stationary target.
---
Are you on pc or console. 
---
If pc have you tried different DPI levels on your mouse? different sensitivity ingame ? 
---
Whats your mouse DPI right now?
---
That's really cool is that the legendary one or am I thinking of something else I personally like the requin
---
 I’d give it a 100% for accuracy!
---
What frost main?
---
so you lost vs the enemy teams carry I guess he just knows how to play the objective better btw it was 19 kills vs 20 so dont even try to compare kd with your teammates
---
They’ll never do it, sadly. It’s so frustrating
---
I tab a lot while playing games. Mainly for Discord. Tabbing from fullscreen is slow and glitchy.
---
I love this post 3000
---
Sure is easy to hold obj when your team insists on roaming so it’s essentially a 1v5 every round huh
---
How long does it take? I find Siege to be one of the better games when it comes to tabbing back in from other tabs.
---
Because then it would just be every other game, COD, CS:GO, Halo, etc. In all of this games, you are basically jumping around half of the time to dodge bullets, and it’s pretty fuckin dumb. So in order to make the game more unique, and tactical, they didn’t allow jumping, since every match would just consist of an Ash or Blitz b-hopping into site.
---
Pls nerf too good
---
I think you misspelled shotgun recruit
---
Well depends on how you’re playing them.
---
As Monty if you’re helping your team and pointing out where enemies are and supporting your team than thats how he’s supposed to be played and you’re helping your team. Although if you are one of the scary Montys that just kill everyone its still good since you’re killing them and since its a bit harder to get kills with Monty.
---
Blitz is good for rushing in and killing people but since a lot of people don’t like him they will say you’re bad regardless.
---
Was that on purpose or a coincidence
---

---
This happens frequently at higher ranks.
---
Oh dude you got time. Most of the people that you go against on r6s has been playing fps games on pc with mouse and keyboard for decades. 
---
Dont worry about the K/d, especially if you are new to pc nad new to the game. I know some really good plat players with sub 1.0 kd since they play support type operators a lot, it doesnt really mean anything skill wise. Thats why the proL now uses [KOST system](https://siege.gg/news/946-player-rating-rebalance) rather than just KD.
---
Too bad not on a good gun
---
Does getting a drone ace only count during preparation (45 sec)? Or does any 5 drones count? Because once the round starts you have no way of telling which are preparatory drones and which are operator thrown drones.

LOL, the only one hating here is you dawg. I think maybe you might be the problem. Also my comments about your skill are coming from the fact that you acted arrogant towards someone proud of something they accomplished. If it's not true, then maybe clarify that but otherwise that's how it looks.
---
True, I do use it and the smg-11 sometimes though because it’s not like using the fmg over the shot gun (It’s honestly a lot better than the fmg for smoke)

Can you explain a bit more on what you mean by "the laser (should) reduce the bloom spread" 
---
Cause the laser already does reduce the boom/reduce diamond by 25% while hip firing. 
---
It tightens a weapon's hip fire accuracy and a shotgun pellet's spread by 25%
---
The guy who had his experience ruined. He cares.
---
Echo is S in bomb A on secure and like C on hostage so he averaged about A

It u kill 3 ppl or 4 ppl etc with a grenade at once it only counts as Ione team kill

On mobile, go onto the subreddit and click the three dots in the top right corner. Then select 'add flair' and you should be able to select from all the operators in the game

I do it instantly every time i get downed by cav, im not about to screw my team over and give the enemy team wallhacks, sorry not sorry

oh shit im sorry

Thor is that you?

I've had a guy with 3000 ping

Oh, you finally awake...

If you played secure area right, you were creating a killbox and defend the room from outside. In bomb you don’t do that, so often.

Prob leaves everytime he gets downed too

So this was actually my first video I put effort into editing I hope you all enjoy it for more to come!

Game coding is like a ramen soup. You want every noodle strand to not get tangled with any other. Fixing the game is like adding more water or changing the container so that the noodles get more space and don’t get tangled. 
---
A player playing the game is like eating/drinking the soup. Too much water or a very large container (like a tray) would just ruin the ramen (the game). And additionally, the player has to eat it with their unique fork or chopsticks (pc or console) which randomly makes the chances of tangled noodles (glitches) higher. 
---
TL;DR: Roughly, there’s a lot of randomness when it comes to coding because of the players and their systems. Hence, glitches.

And add a head.

No
---
leaving &amp; cucking someone out of something they deserve after they outplayed/outskilled you is toxic. countering an interrogation isn't hard, if a Cav gets an interrogation off that means you were:
---
a) too stupid to have someone on flank watch/place a claymore/airjab
---
b) not droning properly
---
c) off on your aim
---
d) too far from your team &amp; didn't give a callout that she was interrogating &amp; instead raged into your mic.
---
leaving after a Cav downs you is toxic &amp; childish as fuck &amp; you're not "playing to win", you're being a prick.
---
Haven't tested this but I'm about 80% sure it does not

i would say the reason i don't like it is because of limited vertical play and also how difficult it is on some occasions to find sites. 
---
i would say i love it because is because of how easy it is to defend an objective. the objective of the game is to win.

To me, it's a good map overall. Balanced enough with what they have. with the addition of Maverick, the map is balanced enough now.

he is a good operator. Though best if the map has multiple breakable floors. Yacht is a decent map for him but i wouldn't use him for pressure. Maverick is a better operator there. but like Fortress and Villa, he's excellent. And also Kafe. 
---
(All my opinion)
---
-Alpha Pack progress (percentage or count)
---
-Alpha Pack results and complaints about Alpha Pack results ("I keep only getting commons!")
---
i.e. no.
---
That ninja defuse

Rolling is faster than running

I see you have  mastered the REAL defense shield operator
---
Soon enough

Finka revive.

Yea, and it’s a known thing, not just your mic.

Very gratefull

CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW OPERATOR BIG CHUNGUS

my friend has every black ice and he's only level 327

Big chungash

It saus ‘polizie’ but isnt it ‘polizei’
---
Lol
---
In bacon grease.
---
idk. love the game, check. love the skin, check. love the fact that I got a rare item for my main, check.
---
pretty exciting for my mundane everyday life :P
---
Mfw small FOVs
---
If it's only on PC I dont have one
---
Yeah only pc
---
Once again. I should care Why? I don't fucking care about this guy. I'm not a dEgEnErAtE for not wanting to donate. Fuck off
---
noooo gridlock? you mean goddess right?
---
How? I always check there lol
---
Enough this content quality is
---
Come on man, that's not fair! Gridlock is big and buff, stronk like the Chunk, but this Ash, that's not thicc, that's not big and buff, that's just hella obese. Like "I lost one of my breach rounds in my fat flaps" obese.
---
Aw shucks.

Now just promise me you won’t Fuze the hostage.

Perfect attention to details

---
I won
---
Ah, but Kaid’s electroclaw doesn’t have to cover the width of a 3-wall to electrify it. Kaid’s AoE means that he only has to have the ApE touching 3 walls to electrify them, meaning the AoE would have to be increased (from its current size) by about 10-15%. 
---
This means he cannot electrify two hatches with one electroclaw at all.
---
The 3rd one is for Milan. I’m pretty sure bc I’m going at the event, the 2nd one idk sincerely
---
Shotgun
---
It looks more like a 3d render in blender.
---
Looks like a ranked charm you get at the end of each season.
---
Turn her into rook
---
Umad bout thathuh?
---
This headgear is as old as the time itself
---
r/bettlejuicing

😂
---
They call her "Ashdozer" 3 speed 3 armor, with an acog in each frag and akimbo primary weapons
---
100% original so far
---
Exactly, somethings gone wrong, veeeery wrong
---
I did this the other day. One shot kill with Ela shotgun :(
---
On the weapon he least needs it on

Recently a Chick-Fil-A got built in Ash’s hometown...

I dont feel bad for roamers

[Redacted]
---
Walked right into that kapkan trap*
---
Honestly,  it's the easiest lowest common denominator.   The fact that they haven't implemented this yet is just wrong.
---
My phone doesn't.
---
Wow
---
they fell into it
---
Yo. That made me crack up! Hahaha
---
What's broken ?
---
Depends what rank you are there is a gold1+ discord i know of that got a good amount of people in it
---
Got em'. I hate when Youtubers take credit for everuthing. I've literally rolled my eyes around 3 seperate times when Macie says "check out my new angle, chat," - *been using for months*

Ah ok thanks. ^^

Ah ok Thanks. :3

Now 822.

Why does she look like she was cosplayed by cartman

She now is a one speed and she finally has a head hitbox
---
He was my first GIGN operator as well. I use the revolver for all GIGN.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor
---
Not at least to those two they should be given. My suggestion to give them to Lion and Gridlock (for example). They are not popular(Lion isn’t even after rework), so this could help them with popularity.
---
Oh god Oh fuck

This. Exactly this. I'm getting sick and tired of facing 4 stack plats with a single copper 4 who also plays like a plat/diamond because "lol wrecking scrubs." I already know I'm not great since I'm bouncing between gold 2 and gold 4 putting me in the most average bracket of players. I know I'm probably where I belong because I know what the common factor in my games is. I don't need fucking diamonds and plats dropping into my games to remind me just how bad I am.
---
Rip flashing blitz
---
Now this, this puts a smile on my face.
---
Yes please.
---
Yea I think it has me and my friends are at low plat high gold and we are 4-0 every game winning
---
I know the one on the right is bandit’s elite, but who r the other charms for?
---
It's like grenades aren't real

"Haaax!"

Long ago he had frags, they were replaced by the claymore

Thatcher: **Hol up what.......**
---
I actually fucking jumped i swear
---
I Think lion should get it too, but Big Rhonda in the other hand's fine
---
I already found the solution (Edit in main Post). But thank you for your reply!
---
Just to answer: 
---
My CPU Temps peeked 81° Package, 80° hottest Core in a Prime95 (266.5) 12h Session, on 1,31V VCore, so everything is normal. Im running a custom water cooling loop with a Mo-Ra3 420 (9x 140mm).
---
No you lost the round
---
thanks
---
You can't fixe a god
---
Good to see I'm not the only one how did that Lol
---
great cosplay! but i need to know what type of tree is it in the back?
---
Wondering this too
---
So make him Vulcan Raven?
---
And what about making recruit a "random" operator? 
---
If you pick him you'll have a randow weapon and pistol with random attachements.   
---
Same for nades or defensive items.  
---
Same for speed and armor, either 1/3, 3/1 or 2/2
---
Thermite was a maybe, he had them long ago, in the 7th situation he has them too, but i dont think thermite should have it.
---
The 2nd its related to ubi events but not sure which one , the 3rd one is for the pro league finals in Milan
---
His dad. With a rolled up comic.
---
I only ever do this with frost traps and hella barbed wire
---
 Still looks dodgy as
---
Maybe dream hack?
---
uhhhhhhhhhhh no don't think so
---
Why make him random?
---
Hell no fam, Jackal's already too ''Cancerous'' i don't think he should get it
---
No, they have only made charms for majors (except twitch drops)
---
Agreed.  It doesn't belong in ranked, but it doesn't make me want to quit immediately (my feeling about Yacht, Favela and Kanal).
---
You're welcome man. Glad to know things are working out for you now :D
---
Idk man, the only thing I know is that is ugly af
---
 Still looks dodgy af
---
wait how did vigil get up there
---
I need to know that
---
I’ve been placing plat 2 for the past few seasons
---
Except it obviously *is* a joke. Smoke's ability is *toxic gas*. It's quite literally *toxic*.
---
Looks like Dirt IV to me
---
Rank 132 here, I prefer Casual most times, but the past few months both Casual and Ranked have been just awful. Ranked is full of smurf accounts and Casual is full of plats just wanting to smack you with their dick.
---
No, I just love doggos
---
😧
---
As far as keeping a steady aim I'll fire an entire clip into a wall w/out adjusting my aim at all to see where the bullets tend to go. Then when I'm in a firefight I'll pull in the opposire direction while shooting and it keeps my gun pretty level
---
As an almost valky main now I can relate.
---
nope its only equipment but equipment is not part of the challenge only gadgets and melee
---
You look like you’re smiling under that mask for the camera but you forgot you’re wearing a mask
---
Looks awesome! I downloaded the android version, but it doesn't update the seasonal stats. Showing zeros across the board for me. On PS4.
---
Yeah, it’s cancer, but hey, at least there’s no jumping?
---
\^.\^
---
Well I'm plat 3 so I guess it doesn't matter as long as you're used to it
---
I would love for this to happen, and tbh I don’t think ubi will follow through with a complete redesign, and instead just change the gadget like they did with Lion. Personally I think Tachanka is basically a manned trap operator, only it relies on your skill as well. While he’s not as bad imo as people say, he’s definitely weak for sure, and could always do with a buff
---
As far as I know the gun has a super slow rpm (it's going full auto at the end of the clip), is there a way to spam it faster? I never use maestro so I'm down to learn some tips
---
This looks great!
---
Oh my god that ninja defuse man
---
Well played
---
If you need any help with parts or building or anything like that I’d be more than happy to help.
---
Glaz
---
That legitimately the only way to play this garbage room.
---
Runs at stable 80 fps until effects get on the screen like smokes it goes down to 45.
---
She is one of the strongest ops for sure
---
Korean magic, great stuff
---
It's fine we won without him
---
yes, the smoke is indeed toxic
---
\_ C A S U A L \_
---
How come? We don’t have hip leaning, and the majority of them feel very weak at ranges past 3-5 metres, needing way more shots to kill than should be necessary, considering you’re being blasted with a shotgun
---
nope
---
All I saw was 1 IQ doing lucky-stupid and then stupid-lucky shit
---
I’m just annoyed at the fire rate nerf. It wasn’t even that good, and they took away the funniest part of it.
---
Hence why it is called an event
---
Mozzie is a lurker, play him like valk
---
Were you both traumatised? Whenever a player stops like that in Siege they’re either AFK or about to kill you
---
Fockin mate, fockin
---
This.  I think of it as a shotgun with less reloading instead of a machine gun. I leave maestro to the mains who know how to play him better. But casual on house? I couldn't resist the big cheese and his shredder!
---
Us Recruit mains are the Disciples of our Lord Tachanka. Convert or be eradicated!
---
r\suddenlythanos
---
Tbh I think the game takes more skill, as coordinating rushes and learning new recoil and strays to effectively learn the new ops adds a higher skill cap to the game. New Evil Eye and Valk cam spots are being discovered very often, and this does have been out for roughly 10 months and 2 years 10 months respectively.
---
You just try to burst fire you look to have trouble managing the recoil.
---
r/suddenlythanos
---
Whenever I see people get detected running up there, I laugh and walk in the bottom floor lol
---
I mean I used to play at a lowered resolution with anti aliasing off when I had a shit gpu and I gotta say, quality &gt; FPS.
---
?
---
If you shoot the dog you should get banned for a week
---
I like how you think that more time on a game means they are better
---
If you do squad only with just one other friend, as soon as you start that friend can leave and as long as you keep hitting retry and don’t go to the menu, you can farm by yourself, while getting the renown given to full groypw
---
Had the game a month still not mastered the art of aiming
---
Hm ... so everyone will become a Wobbuffet tomorrow.
---
So if i shoot my friend with a tachanka turret, I will receive the damage and he wont?
---
Is there any point in not putting a muzzle brake on a pistol? Just wondering.
---
"Mounted LMG (Tachanka; regardless of who’s using the turret)" so does that mean that if someone teamkills with my turret I get penalized, that sounds easly abusable.
---
Is this just you getting killed by a claymore?
---
When?  I will instantly sign it, I NEED THIS IN THE GAME
---
Black Ops 4 isn't battle royale its primary focus is multiplayer? Also CSGO is 7 years old and Siege failed to surpass it. You can't act like Battle Royale  is not a dominant force in the multiplayer market and siege still fails to top it's own genre in the market.
---
Fair enough just thought I’d see people’s opinion on the current state of the game cheers for the suggestion
---
Recruit Rush them. Destroy their pride. DDOS them.
---
Who is the good boy?
---
High ping doesn’t give you an advantage anymore. 
---
I also do agree. As a low gold I probably shouldn’t see stacks of Plat 2  players in my Gold 3-4 games lol. But I also enjoy the challenge at the same time.
---
Its weird that a bunch of clips recently on this sub have featured M4 maverick
---
👁👅👁
---
Imagine nerfing the worst operator in the game further instead of rebalancing/reworking him.
---
I need this aswell
---
Fookin’ wall bangs?
---
I was just about to say that too
---
Would say the bomb is planted, Renton he has to defuse but this is my favorite 👍
---
Were you team killing a lot before hand?
---
maybe younger people see him as cool or *edgy*. I just see an insecure person being arrogant and rude to cover up for it. As if he thinks it makes him a more interesting person.
---
Consoles can be updated weekly?
---
From Twitter
---
I don’t think there is, I just have a lot of pistols without muzzle brakes because i forget to put them on lol
---
If you place barbed wire ontop of a hatch will it stop hibana pellets?
---
I usually wait 3x the queue time
---
Why, there is no credit
---
The reverse friendly fire change is coming tomorrow
---
&gt; High ping doesn’t give you an advantage anymore.
---
thats just not true
---
I like the idea but I’m still skeptical, what if I play fuze and it’s a 2v4 or whatever. I fuse the room and kill 3 people and my teammate(myself now) and now the only person alive on my team is a low level,or someone with less than optimal positioning. This is a bad example but there has to be other situations like this with other ops. Other than that I personally like the idea even though I think a forgive system would have been better without changing core gameplay
---
Not only on twitter but he is the same way to his team even on stage ive heard
---
Your joke clearly calls Trump voters deplorable. That's an opinion which makes it not neutral.
---
I’m usually on attack

We really need a sticky post or something in the sidebar because this has been explained like hundreds of times and It isn't even funny anymore
---
Since you can deploy it and you are responsable for your gadget so yeah.. makes a bit sense imo
---
that looks so unbelievable fishy haha
---
With the power of autism, a recruit is unstoppable.

Rainbow 6 Siege: "The game you pick up for a quickplay match, get cursed at, then put down for another 2 months"
---
Not really no. Does that really have an effect on it?
---
*change team*
---
Yeah, after reading it again, it makes more sense. 
---
The Tachanka part is just identifying who the gadget belongs to, but the "regardless" text is to clarify who gets punished.
---
OUTSTANDING MOVE!
---
How was his last reply to a tweet 17 minutes ago? The reply was "Hahahaha"
---
I’m imagining fatass ash with a tiny vest on.
---
Well, if they're lower than 20, then you could always try.
---
Thatcher looks like: what da fook mate
---
Damn I saw that article, whoever made this sucks
---
When will people realise this system is only for when cheaters get banned. You dont instantly get your elo back if you lose vs a cheater it takes time lmao
---
He left pro league because of some family issues
---
Good bot.
---
God did him a solid and sent out some last tweets for him
---
His Twitter account replied to a tweet saying "Hahahahaha" 17 minutes ago as of this comment.
---
Power Plays.
---
Yeah that's why there's utilities (explosives), you can still melee to break them if reroute to get to it &amp; I'm pretty sure her mats aren't gonna be entry denial because there's usually more than one way to get into an objective &amp; she only has 3 traps. And so there for you're saying from a team of 5 not at least one person doesn't have an explosive utility to spare &amp; chances of it being under a window with a hard floor are slim.
---
Zig didn’t die
---
Excuse me but, where did you see it?
---
Exactly
---
I don't think Smoke canisters will work nicely. Let's see.
---
Ela's pistol apparently.
---
That makes about as much sense as blaming teammate deaths on Rook because they didn't pick up his plates.
---
And thats why claymores and drones exist. If you rush out of spawn like a headless chicken or dont cover your flanks when staring down a window in skyscraper its your own fault. Runouts arent toxic. learn them and play to expect them
---
I don’t like the BP idea either. Would be way too strong
---
Yeah his last reply to a tweet was like 20 minutes ago so uhhhh...
---
I expected a TK haha well done
---
After awhile it's all feel and becomes easy without even thinking.
---
Fear not, they have 4 stacks in mind.
---
'Further changes for Reverse Friendly Fire will come during Year 4 Season 2. We will introduce situations where the system will activate for the whole squad.'
---
there is a forgive system . there is something like "was this team kill intentional ?" with a yes or no for 30 secs . if you didn't respond , it will automatically active
---
Excuse me?
---
Critical, then. It was the proximity of them, more than anything
---
R6 Siege Operators are very balanced. Sometimes the vanilla ops are even more powerful than the latest DLC ops ~~***(unlike EA coughs)***~~
---
The game is very balanced, it just takes a veeery long time until they fix something if a character is broken at least until now. They want to update how they get feedback from the community by extending the period of the Test Server so this will likely be no problem anymore in the future
---
It used to take a very long time until you unlocked every char in the game (1y for me :( but they reworked the prices so I guess it takes around 4months)
---
And solo queue is... well let's just say that it is sometimes... *interesting*
---
It's amazing!
---
Ah how about it was caveira she only downs people even with a heatshot...
---
Why would you go that way? The window in courtyard is way closer.
---
Ela’s pistol
---
It really should be unanimous, I assume it’s not in order to counter cheaters on your team, but these days they’re probably boosting someone, so it’s probably not much use anyway for that reason.
---
It wasn’t silenced
---
Its not just with jagers ads its all ops with grenades 
---
Ive cooked a grenade canceled it and still got blown uo by it
---
It's a real joke, yes.
---
My bad, still yields similar results
---
\*console
---
Agreed
---
Why do you care so much about what streamers think? If you like the game play it, if not don’t.
---
That's what I've been saying all along.
---
Castle + Fuze is so much better than Thatcher +thermite.
---
Haha yeah
---
one more thing , is reverse friendly fire is available as an option in custom matches ?
---
I would like to know when the new operators will be launched
---
There was no need, the date was known. The date was announced during the Invitational
---
Someone get this man a bandaid
---
Because Ubisoft is doing nothing to punish toxicity and promoting good behaviour.
---
This might be worth trying out.
---
Same
---
I've played since the beta, but barely play anymore. Stale maps, cancer ops, every match is people boosting, no fun modes, toxicity, old ass game where I've done everything. I don't think this game is anywhere near as big as Ubi lets on. Everyone on console has at least 3 accounts, and the streaming numbers for people and pro league are pretty weak.
---
It’s what I’ve observed not saying it’s intended.
---
Meanwhile on console...
---
What rank do you want us?
---
Raiders of the Lost Rook
---
That’s just how casual works
---
I'm still a bit skeptical about this RFF thing, I don't deny it won't help the community and new players against assholes but maybe it's a too convoluted solution for a problem not that big (at least in my experience)
---
I'm afraid of this method being too intrusive but it's just the first phase so they can collect a lot of data and improve it. Idk will see how it goes.
---
Yeah I actually hate tkers
---
Did the same thing with that same handgun on kafe. That thing has magical tracking bullets!
---
Nice, is maverick supposed to be antman?
---
I'm just saying that that is excessive, being required to use an explosive on a frost mat is ridiculous. Currently they are best used under a window or other vault location due to it being more difficult to destroy, imagine vaulting through a window with no realistic counter to that frost mat, is it just me or is that blatantly op?
---
What if Kaplan was reverted to his old state where his traps one shot but now imagine they were impervious to bullets, cause that's basically what you are suggesting.
---
Isn't G2 invited
---
Lazy
---
So they removed tachanka from the weakest defender list? Alright then. **Buff him**.
---
It’s not that hard. You want him to do the “lock down a hallway or corridor” job, but you fail to make him work the way you want. You want people to have to play with explosives and capitao to get rid of him, yet you give him a breakable shield. Not only that, but the shield’s HP can get melted from a guy peeking once or twice and it doesn’t matter where they shoot your shield, it just shatters.
---
This isn’t hard to fix.
---
It doesn't look like he was trying to prefire anything, he was trying to bust the barricade with his shotgun...
---
Ah, the wording was a little confusing, thanks for the clarification
---
It’s a monty
---
I think my worst experience in this game was the one time I got a griefer in my ranked game. Actually that happened twice but the first time vote to kick was a thing in ranked and we executed order 66 on his ass fast as fuck.
---
Anyways, back to the one that was actually an issue. Guy would play cav and blitz. Every time we spawned on defense he’d shoot us once with cav’s pistol (pre rebalance) making us all 1-10 health depending on room size and armor type. On offense he’d spawn with us flash us, shoot us while we’re flashed, and run. 
---
That happened the entire game. We lost 4-5 because of some griefing dickhead on our team.... Uhg, that shit pisses me off still.
---
r/siegefashionadvice
---
I think you should definitely get the standard $30 version or even the $15 version. They have lowered the price of most operators so significantly it should be easy to get everyone you want in a comfortable amount of time.
---
I bought the $15 version and haven't regretted it. Too many characters can be overwhelming because the different guns can take some getting used to. Recruit (the free character) has so many different loadout options I spent a lot of my early games just playing as him. 
---
My friend with ~200 hours in the game only plays Frost and Twitch at this point, and although I own almost everyone I stick to just a few mostly.  
---
There is something very satisfying about getting the game at a good value, to me. And the satisfaction of unlocking new characters with Renown is also great.
---
I am on PC but the community is pretty solid. Shiiiit what else can I say at this point... Ask me anything i have ~600 hours in R6S and still look forward to my friends being offline in discord so I can play rainbow for a bit (they stopped playing mostly around 100 hours, not cus bad game just interest in other games). Probably my favorite FPS game atm.
---
Ranked or casual?
---
I made this before you even had siege
---
Thats the one thing that I, a new player, am TERRIBLY struggling with:
---
Map Layout.
---
I feel so goddamn confused on where to go, where to avoid, where enemies might be, how I should enter, etc. and it’s overwhelming.
---
Thankfully, I learned to play more patiently than other Objective-based shooters.
---
The absolute state of "gamer culture"
---
Thank you very much for the answer!! 👌
---
lol, thanks
---
Console is worse than PC in my experience and I never felt r6 was toxic at all when comparing it to league of legends
---
How cancerous.
---
Explosives wont be reflected for now so hopefully they address that for next season when they do (if I've read that right)
---
All hail the one true god
---
Hmm, I think we kind of need something for if the teammate was downed by the enemy. Situation I'm thinking of is cav downing and interrogating.
---
That has nothing to do with Maestro and Tachanka being the same operator.
---
Nomad is the strongest right now if you value the meta and such.
---
Hes still missing hair I see ;c
---
It is?
---
One way to play frost is to use mats in high traffic  areas where a push may come. Another thing is remembering that the enemy cant shoot you and the mat when vaulting through a window. You can position yourself in an off angle and shoot them as they are vaulting. Shes really good for slowing a push or rush.
---
Never noticed how her wind delta jumps up and down every season, along with Kapkan?
---
Scare you i will
---
Yeah
---
yep I do
---
**Laugh and say "Amateur" with Russian accent* *
---
the other guy is dead shitlips
---
I was answering your “two different strategies” retort. 
---
One has to stand still to use their turret, one can do it remotely and has the lmg as a primary. Power creep.
---
Back in BF3 on the Xbox360 I loved playing custom servers and getting banned for killing admins as "cheating." Its not like I would intentionally go after them, they would just happen to die a lot. 
---
Not my fault they would fly helicopters super low and not expect a tank shell to slam into their canopy.
---
Is it coming back?
---
Nah, you didn't almost lose then win also you weren't screaming the whole time.
---
Oh I like this
---
*force theme intensifies
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
I do, though I'm conflicted on using them or not.
---
Better with black ice ;)
---
Gj wrong sub reddit
---
I don't know, but I am guessing so, because people loved it and made ubisoft some money.
---
as a frost main, i gotta say, the assist number is still a point so i count it in my head haha. but it's better my team get the kill than me run away from my post just to secure it, i usually call it out anytime it happens so my team and get it, a w means more than a kill
---
Fuze at least has a killer gun.
---
Well you don’t have to shit talk Xbox players for it the people that talk shit suck
---
You can get away with an angles grip/flash hider.
---
In my experience PC is much more toxic. Every game has someone spewing some toxic nonsense in chat, and since you can't actually do that on console, it becomes much less toxic by default.
---
I don't know what half of your post means, and I think that is a good thing.
---
Thanks, I was ready to die when my buddy boosted me back up. New found respect and love for finka.
---
Almost died to claymore.
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
i know, 200hours later i dont have 2, you can do it :)
---
Alibi has a natural idle twitch and Prisma is stationary. Also the quality is a lot lower and they stand awkwardly still in weird positions. They also have default loadout.
---
Might as well get used to it - smurfing is everywhere. The matchmaking never improves, since you have these low level "silvers" who are actually Plat players "just having fun" at the expense of other scrubs who are legitimately silver and just want a fair game lol
---
Some nights its honestly better to play Ranked if Casual is too sweaty, which seems ironic
---
Ubi please ban rage quit
---
Awesome!

whats with these desert camos all the time? like seriously, i am genuinely curious. did the art team forget how darker colors look like...

Unfortunately there is a climate of this kind of behavior becoming more and more socially acceptable. In the US they have a president that is easily the most insecure and rude individual in the public sphere, and yet has literal cultists that follow him and think how he acts is "cool" or appropriate in any way.
---
That’s a really helpful tip thanks
---
Nerfing the gadget even more isnt gonna fix the problem...
---
Try moot
---
I already have, its not in there.
---
Okay?
---
So a clear typo on Jackal is as bad as "dont", "im", "cant", "isnt", "were" and "its"? Wow you are so petty and still so stupid. 
---
Did you jerk off on your keyboard and ruin your apostrophe key? Or are you too stupid to know when to use an apostrophe?
---
You don't know how to read OR write... absolutely remarkable.
---
But, there’s not much like the feeling of gettin a melee kill on and enemy that has thier back turned
---
It’s gonna happen quite often for next two weeks or so.
---
And if you’re gonna TK your friends, only do it in a 5 stack, don’t screw over randoms by throwing.
---
*Safeguard wants to know YOUR location*
---
Jk ...  r/roast me 😈
---
Uve reached Lord Tachanka level of awesome
---
Vert on aug?
---
All that was missing was some ranting about "SJWs"
---
Yeah, sorry. I forgot to trim. Anyways it gives some good buildup ;)
---
     Hey! Just wanted to say I'm loving the app. The UI is super friendly and easy to use, overall super nice. I do have a couple questions though. When I access my seasonal stats in the app, it says that I have a seasonal 1.39 K/DR, and a 4.5 W/LR, but when I look at my profile inside the game, it says I have an even 1.0 K/D and an even 1.0 W/R. 
---
     HOWEVER, in the app stats under GENERAL RANKED stats, it says I have a 0.99 K/D, and a 1.05 W/L. Also it says I've only played 238 hours of siege, when I've actually played 548, but that's not as important. So I guess I'm asking how the app gets the information, is there some sort of a mix up there? Or am I just understanding it wrong.
---
Wtf
---
you had to buy many with own money, it is not possible to get almost all w/o paying
---
That's just console peasants.
---
And bandit isn't??
---
Wow very cool. Nice job dude, keep it up.
---
I do this to gain intel. You shoot my battery - I know you are close.
---
I didn't either lol
---
Hey man, you said 1 op
---
very good! although my heart dropped when you got close to the claymore oh my 😂
---
I meant jager should be lower than bandit
---
Cause that makes the vest-wearer into a fucking tank. A reason why docs overcharge goes away after x-amount of time is cause 140 health is fucking ridiculous. No person could legitimately beat someone with that much health ESPECIALLY if the health doesn’t go away after a period of time.
---
He is good but bandit is better
---
Don’t worry I will teach you the way of the recruit
---
Of course, been playing with subtitle since the beginning, it's just like watching subbed anime &gt;:)
---
I would like to see it come back but fixed so you can actually find the prompt to pick it up it was hard but so very satisfying
---
That's how it reads for now, but it states that this isn't intended and will be changed Y4.2
---
No evidence. Good kill. How it should always be.
---
So basically don't use anything that explodes?
---
In BF3 and 4 I was scary good at taking out jets and helis with the standard tank rounds. And could pretty consistently hit cross map shots if the pilot was flying low thinking they were safe. 
---
I got banned from lots of servers since admins were notorious for helicopter and jet hogging. Didn't help them that when you killed them once they would jump into the next heli and try to get revenge. Always flying real low and straight. God I miss BF3
---
I miss the good old days
---
*I'M GETTING LIT THE FUCK UP OVER HERE*
---
Rip
---
Just saw that.  Freaky
---
That's way too powerful to be a charm.
---
I can confirm that a lot of videos I see here are indeed from console players. Pc every now and then but mostly console. It’s to the point I can tell the difference without seeing the controls
---
Lion is still very powerful just in a different way I think I may move jackal up to b I rated him so low because as a kapkan main a lot of jackals I encounter get very tunnel visioned and make them step into at least one edd pretty easily
---
I know, I want to shoot them SO BAD even though I'm in real life, even when I realise I STILL WANT TO SHOOT THEM
---
Am I missing something?
---
Clash really gotta be so low 😔 she’s good if you use her right. r-right guys?
---
yeah but this one would be more like echos yokai where if you try to run away the effects last longer and get worse.
---
Evidence of what?
---
Losing my chance for the MvP to the cav
---
sry pay to flex i guess
---
Lesion is S tier by a long shot.
---
Where did you get this from? I was under the impression that the changes weren't coming until Season 2.
---
It's IQ droning. Hence the floating phone
---
A body. Nobody will know ;)
---
Orange and yellow hat recruit are SS tier
---
Ah, haha. True
---
I swear its the people at the bottom of the lobby who talk the most trash or votekick when you dont get the 1 v 5 clutch
---
Thats why its rare instead of common like yings
---
My friend , it's time to change now . this has been posted before
---
Recruit in SS
---
No, just no
---
Hmm, yeah I guess he is really good.
---
you sound like a 12 year old, is the best you can come up really ‘yeah but you *seem* like you’re doing this thing that you clearly aren’t’
---
it’s not relevant and you’re moronic if you think it is. personally, im not particularly interested in getting into a long comment chain, see ya
---
though i get the feeling you’re the type that cant quite resist the allure of the reply button, have fun talking to yourself cause im sure as hell not reading your next genius comment
---
Honestly I do this all the time in casual because I’d rather take a lost than my team lose when the points are 2 and 2. And I respect anyone who leaves as well for their team. Mad Respect.
---
Can you please try to do it with a different operators gun
---
That’s one character my dude. Other characters like Thatcher using the AR33 or any of the characters wielding shields for example would have serious problems killing him. Additionally 140 hp would give characters tons of more opportunities of survival from both grenade and claymores that they wouldn’t have normally. The game should award attackers for smart plays, not reprimand them.
---
Why don’t you just use the Asian or African servers then?
---
Commando pro?
---
I want an April 1 update where smoke brings actual babes that he sends after people.
---
and y’all thought di vinci was dead 😤😤😤
---
By 4.2 it'll be pretty straightforward: any team damage, except for traps (claymores/kapkan) and timed breaches (Thermite, Hibana) will cause RFF when the damaging player either kills someone (and the dead player verfies it was intentional) or does enough damage to trigger RFF.
---
It's only confusing right now because the explosives aren't coded properly.
---
its both. read the ubi responses all throughout this post
---
I feel like that other than Finka (Who i still consider to be good in most scenarios), the rest of s tier is pretty solid.   
---
A tier are the ones that fit most cases but lack that extre OOMPH that gets them to S tier.
---
B tier, I feel i probs undersell how good ash is and may change her. But I feel these guys are good but are weaker than others.   
---
C Tier: Dropping Clash, Honestly, I dont even know what i was doing that was my bad.  
---
D Tier: Frost and Mute seem to the biggest complaints here.  I think these two come down to placements and how well they are placed. Sure they have their niches but i feel that their are characters that do this better. Of course i can be wrong and i probs am but Im willing to defend my points.  
---
F tier: This is the biggest one as many people think BB should higher. I can see why but as ive said in another comment, I find him underwhelming.  Sure he can hold down angles without worrying about being pinged in the head but that is it. his guns feel aight but i just cant feel better bout him. Will bump him above F tier as clash deserves his spot.   
---
Other than that, that is my reasoning. Feel free to argue ill try to defend my points and if you can change my congrats. But otherwise this is what I think and even if its garbage, Ill leave this up anyway no matter how much flame gets flak gets thrown my way.
---
*and*
---
never change siege
---
Before, I didnt feel he was s Tier prob high A tier (prob should of adjusted to show that apologies)
---
As a cav main I agree but people don’t just leave to avoid the interrogation some do it just so they don’t get the death on there record.
---
I had the same thing happen back in operation chimera when I was watching pro league and sat in cue for an hour
---
That's even more lame. Understandable though.
---
A P4 meme on the R6S subreddit, what a time to be alive.
---
May i ask why you disagree with my whole top Line?
---
I'll tone it down the next time! Thanks for the feedback!
---
“wHat THE fUcK wAs tHaT peEK”
---
Good shoot
---
I don’t like doing ranked on video games because it takes the fun out of the game especially as a solo. Can’t tell you how many people call me a “bot” or toxic for being unranked and playing casual :|
---
A hundooo percent
---
Depends which gun. Muzzle break for dmrs and flash hider for the rest
---
I think there should be a suicide mechanic where you just die instead
---
Use the famas lol
---
Or why Capitao didn't play outside of the windows. When I go for that plant I'm usually on the opposite side after.
---
I'm guessing here but I'm pretty sure its the thing that determines your rank in Ranked.
---
I do, but I like DMRs
---
Yeah i would be okay with that. Should take a few seconds to do it though
---
So flash hider overall is the better attachment?
---
Especially nice when your breaching a random window and the points stat says kapkan and frost mat broken it just tells me how much I was saved and makes me happy for a bit
---
Lmao i’m a boosted plat how am I supposed to get diamond.
---
Oh ok that makes sense and I think I remember now that that is what it is. Thx
