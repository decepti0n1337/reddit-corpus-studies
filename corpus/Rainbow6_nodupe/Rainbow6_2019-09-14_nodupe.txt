Good find.

FUCK
---
THIS

MAP
---
It is a practice zone. Same conditions, same heat, just no ranked.
---

---
So you can experiment, but you can't leave the way you can't leave in ranked.
---
Cool
---
"Just don't join" has worked for me over the years. I'd rather sacrifice a few chuckles than my IP address, but I get your point
---
Scam. Stay away from it.
---
The last season thing is a system where it moves you closer to a certain beginning spot (like gold something) depending on how far you were last season. For example, if you were plat it would move you to say gold 1 range for next season, but a diamond would be around plat 3.
---

---
The game has been alive for four years and trust me when I say they have to make new ops every season to keep up with their set standards plus it is a lot harder to deal with glitches and plan for new stuff. And with everyone wanting new things after a week of the new ops being released I was surprised they had so many ops at the beginning of the game being released so their ideas for new ops were limited even more.
---
When she was first released her arms didn't even fit in her player model. Bitch be thic
---
how
---
Her silent step ability was changed in phantom sight to allow her to activate it when it wasn't fully charged, but decreased how long it lasted.
---
I got a duplicate of that one 2 days ago
---
If you won 7 and lost 3 there is no way you got placed below gold, you‚Äôre either lying or confused

Nice!

This thing is beautiful
---
1. If you are  t bagging with an enemy and they kill you call them an asshole
---
what res?
---
If you're on attack or you know you're not fighting Blackbeard, you can also just use a low recoil/high RoF weapon and headshot. I find it far more reliable.
---
Like, if it's a high-skill situation, why set aside the effort to use a weapon that is just as effective as others with the added difficulty? Also lacks an ACOG, which on attack can be invaluable.
---
Also keep in mind that it's a machine pistol, so its damage fall-off is is also very punishing, so the low TTK is even further less accessible unless you are, like I said, right in their face.
---
At that point I'd honestly just rather use a pistol. Only takes like 2-3 bullets to down anyone not wearing rook plates, and its infinitely more controllable.
---
Okay..
---
Use him when a team mate is planting so if they want to stop it they‚Äôve got to risk being pre-fired

To be fair this is highschool shit.

To be fair, this sub is mostly in highschool so it‚Äôs kinda cute. Young love

1920x1080 60 fps
---
Are you playing from outer space
---
*upvote because girl* ü§£
---
I don‚Äôt think they said it released with the season
---
Wait. So it's hard to deal with glitches because they are working on new stuffs? How does other developers could manage to do it?
---
Alright dude lmao
---
Shes a 3 armor so they make her bulky but she doesnt have as much equipment to cover her up
---
I was plat 3 last season. So far have won 5 lost 2. My MMR according to R6 tracker is currently high gold 1. Each win/loss is about 115 MMR. So if I win the next 3 I will be plat 3/plat 2. If I lose I will be about gold 3.
---
Nope, I just have xfinity.
---
Ohhhhh I see what you mean. I play in 4:3 in siege so its rendered at 1920x1080 but the image looks stretched because that's my in game res. My bad
---
i thought that u guys where playing 2v2 knife and ur friend accidentally exposed his hacks lol
---
that would be the worst way to lose a friend holy shit
---
Definitely isn't termite after that rework
---
Out of the faces that have been revealed, I'd say Thatcher. I don't like Goyo very much. I don't know why.
---
obviously tachunks
---
Tachanka
---
Cause she‚Äôs an Australian wook
---
haven't seen anybody playing as her so never seen her in-game.
---
Before the dark times... before the empire
---
I feel you.
---
I'm gonna look this up. super curious about that lol
---
10/10 would bang again
---
There will probably be a free test version in this season. The full version will come in season 4
---
definitely lion
---
That's gay
---
Exactly, and this guy is complaining that she takes just two seconds, which is already inhuman. Like seriously you would need enhanced limbs to pull off what Amaru does, give the lady a break
---
On average attackers have a higher dps
---
Maybe not a ban but an automatic interrogation if the player leaves within an x amount of metres from Cav or if they were downed by Cav
---
Ok
---
Ouff another false statement of me not having money to buy it. Quality shit post 10/10
---
Also, when one team or player can use a certain op, but the other team/player cannot. That‚Äôs unbalance. It‚Äôs everyone or no one.
---
I managed to kill someone with an X-Kairos yesterday and I‚Äôm still in awe.
---
?
---
Hey guys I unlocked the most talked about skin and posted it but I totally don't know how cool it is.. welcome to rainbow you troll, you'll fit in very well.
---
I mean you got the hair right
---
good shit brother. got a page you upload your other stuff to?
---
This is getting wayyy out of hand now lmao
---
You can buy them with renown by playing the game, let‚Äôs not act stupid here. Quality shit post 10/10
---
I guess we‚Äôre just going to have to agree to disagree because we can‚Äôt convince each other. Have a good day sir
---
You can‚Äôt try out new ops in T-Hunt.
---
It was a glitch where jager was replaced my me
---
I wish they would just bite the bullet and recreate the game code and engine from scratch so it wouldn‚Äôt be spaghetti code anymore and shit would be easier to properly code and shit
---
does anybody know who the leaker is?
---
Mav
---
Ember Rise is honestly kinda glitchy
---
Controversial opinion goyo is just as useless, it I just his kit is amazing. A two speed with the vector or slug shotty wrecks shop, but his gadget is hardly ever useful, and can even be a liability.

Nah its the lord‚Äôs new headgear
---
&gt;Doc breaks a drone
---
Apparently ruins the game?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;You teamkill someone for something so small and force them to sit out for the remainder of the round, essentially losing your team the game
---
Nah, nothing wrong with that.
---
You stupid.
---
I couldn't contain my pure joy with the possibility of standing on 10+ Gu mines in 1 round !!
---
I did it in 30 seconds
---
Fortnite bad rainbow good
---
I meant it as more of a gun test, but you right
---
I peed white
---
Yeah sure. Maybe when you‚Äôre older you‚Äôll understand
---
i thought you were playing with a controller when i first saw that aim
---
Pretty shields aiming is the death combo for shields now.
---
Neither are good but N√∏kk is a little more useful for sneaking around and taking out the cams that cant see you
---
Amaru is good for rushing
---
Man I went full potato

About as bad as a Red Arcade thumbnail.

Its not just you, its happened to me once where the conputer went normal blue screen on me. But siege itself has chrased 2 times without closing anything else.
---
??
---
I feel like console Champions will have a few legit people who deserve it and the rest will be the Dossers and MnK
---
You have 2500 renown buy ash with that .
---
Maverick for sure.
---
nah thats normal
---
Her pistol is still better than her smg.
---
Ah,sorry mate.
---
It is actually broken. The website says I‚Äôm gold 1 when I‚Äôm only gold 3 in game, seems like the new ranks messed it up
---
Clash doesn't need anymore nerfs given her win rate, and being able to counter Mira with absolutely no risk and little effort is a terrible choice.
---
Pretty tight üòâüòç
---
All good
---
Preferred Black Ice‚Äôs screen but I really like the samba mixed with the Siege theme. 
---
(I think it‚Äôs samba, only played twice since update)
---
Imagine getting a boner in a skin tight suit btw nice cosplay
---
My ping has been fine but I'm still like lagging and freeing but still have a low ping
---
Get the blitz shield joke and ash has a one by one pixel hit box on all limbs to balence the 1,000,000,000% chance to die to a frost mat then gu mine combo trap and rage quit from netcode not giving a fuck when they fall for the Deployable Goyo shield or new one when fixed.
---
Thailand doesn‚Äôt exist then.
---

But seriously, cut down on down time and cut down on the amount of effects.

Having rap over idle gameplay is just funny tbh

Looks like you‚Äôre about to activate N√∏kk‚Äôs ability. Cool nonetheless.
---
"I just unpacked it today‚Äù
---
Desync has now become a massive problem again? How?

That's doesn't make any sense.

Should have let them kill you
---
And blitz for memes

Yes very good you are a lucky one
---
Behold his true form.
---
Oh I couldn't tell what this was at first
---
dude , ive gotten six ... once during ranked :/ . really wish we had some sort of TB so we could fix these problems before the update came out .
---
Just play unranked?
---
The level of envy I have towards anyone with this or the 416 for jager black ice is indescribable.
---
Yea
---
This needs to either be game mode or stand alone game
---
That‚Äôs actually sick oh my
---
Unless you got a degree in siege I hope you're joking about that price tag
---
BLYAT, GRENADAAAAA
---
I played the beta and the alpha you stupid fuck I don‚Äôt need to watch a video to know the ads animation was never that bad
---
Black screens and muffles sounds? I guess they added Helen Keller as an OP
---
Ahhh I want
---
I know I don't have enough, I meant more so why can't I see the new operator here.
---
No, it happens to my friends randomly
---
Did you eat rook?
---
What console are you playing and what rank are you? I never see ddosers but i hover between silver and gold. Is it much worse in the higher ranks
---
Early seasons I didn't feel mkb issue to be so common. Back then I just used to suspect of a few people each season. Not at high gold low plat I see 1-2 players per game.
---
Hm ok
---
Yeah yesterday I got ddossed (xbox) in casual going 2-0 they started to stress the servers towards the end of the match to try and comeback. But it didn't work
---
Good job
---
Nothing feels better than getting out of gold limbo. Congrats
---
You have to wait seven days so season pass people can play the ops for seven days
---
you buy the year 4 pass
---
Nice cosplay
---
You dont have the season pass
---
The moment before climaxing hahaha
---
they‚Äòre only available to season pass owners during the first week after their release
---
I'm on xbox and I'm at plat 2, dude it's like every other game I get DDOSed its not worth playing anymore.
---
Rofl I played with him yesterday I remember the name
---
Does it happen on any other game
---
Didn‚Äôt hit me if you look closely
---
ok thanks for clarifying
---
ubi finally made good legendary skins
---
No
---
You're a very lucky guy my dude
---
Nice clutch though. Did you win the last round? I am going to guess not sadly.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Well good luck to you!!
---
Just happened to me rn
---
Why being so rude ?
---
5 weeks? wtf drugs are you on? they left boo hoo, interro someone else.
---
I‚Äôm glad that he‚Äôs on the cover tbh. Sledge is dope
---
I‚Äôve been solo queuing
---
Perfect
---
Why do u have the operator symbols by ur name
---
List of gear- (Headgear: Mandible) (Uniform: INTZ 2019) (556XI Gun Skin: Glacier) (M45 Meusoc Gun Skin: Retrofit, aka Thermite Elite skin) and I have the Outbreak Breacher Chibi on him and all of the hard breachers because... well they breach reinforced walls.
---
This shit: happens more usual with each season
---
Ubisoft: ok it's time for more skins before this game dies completely PREPARE FOR NEW EVENT HOO HOO
---
My man! First time I got to plat was solo queuing.. you got it bro
---
Kills maybe? 
---
Idk could be wrong
---
I was so lucky to find my FM12 the way I did. I was completely unresearched at the time, and didn't know how good of a deal I was getting. It was the most expensive mask ($60) until I bought my S10 this summer.
---
Actually nice zofia gun skin too
---
My k.d was 0.9 his was 1.3
---
Did he finish his placements last season?
---
now this is legendary quality
---
nice resolution btw, how you installed Siege on Iphone?
---
Yes
---
what. you are special my friend
---
Thanks!
---
Probably because you guys were different ranks at the end of last season? That's being a thing for two seasons now.
---
Most underrated comment
---
are we gonna ignore philippines as a fucking pixel only
---
Mmm 140$
---
Your kd plays a good part in ranking. If you 420-69 with a friend going 0-4, youll have a better rank. I missed out on plat because of this and am sweating
---
No the glitch showed every single item out during the season, just google Alpha Pack glitch or something like that
---
I‚Äôm thai :(
---
They‚Äôre communists...they share
---
This is unexpectedly wholesome, take an updoot
---
Amusement I'm guessing
---
I‚Äôve never heard of ddosing on pc (I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs possible but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue like it is on console). But, it‚Äôs not something ubi can do anything about unfortunately. It‚Äôs on Sony and Microsoft. It‚Äôs also damn near impossible to detect thus making it hard to punish offenders
---
I'm wet.
---
only a minuscule portion of the community wants this, the vast majority do not want this for obvious reasons
---
I'm not bashing tryharding, I'm extremely competitive but I'm calling out hypocrisy
---
I don't know you should also specify platform
---
Because it's a crutch!
---
Is this content legit?
---
Some of those operators gadgets really aren't that far fetched.
---
Why is this one being downvoted? Not creepy at all, just someone complementing a costume. Meanwhile there are actual creeps elsewhere in the comments.
---
Sorry forgot .. for PC
---
Lol, bunch of bums
---
8/10 cosplay, I'll that's missing is the padding,kevlar, and   the ammo belt/vest. But even without those, you look great!
---
so an op that would make goyo useless, but also being useless if there isn't a goyo?
---
No, Something that could pop the shield and kill half the defending team in the prep phase would never work.
---
Seems right for ps4 community
---
i mean, it's not that big of a deal IMO
---
That is what I just said. It is not, however, lag.
---
Are they ever going to give Zofia a gun skin that looks interesting?? All of them are so bland and boring imo, only thing good for her guns are the universals
---
I know where I want to dock..my..kaebbi...
---
I'll see myself out.

You shouldn't know when you just randomly spray a wall that you downed an opponent, that's an unfair advantage and is almost certainly giving the kill for whoever got lucky.
---
Thanks so much!

I got some Massdrop HD 6xx, and they are amazing.

---
Yeah thats true, ngl it was a random idea that popped in my mind
---
No problem! I had this question too when I first got to Reddit.
---
astsros are always a safe bet, if your budget is 300, you can comfortably get a nice pair
---
Unless they release a completely broken op, which the last truly broken op on release was Ela, it isn't "pay to win."  There's no guarantee that having the new ops on your team is going to get you the win, and in fact, unless the season pass people spent a lot of time on the test server, they are probably more likely to get themselves killed playing with their new toy than they are to actually help the team.
---
Or when you just randomly use a thatcher emp, or just spray a wall trying to destroy an ads or bandit charges. That's a very big deal actually. It's just too much of valuable Intel.
---
The fat layers soak up the bullets
---
I got pulses headgear and didn‚Äôt think much of it haha hoping the bug stay
---
We probably wont get a lot of new maps going forward, forget Poland
---
Nice
---
I also feel that it would make mute more useful, although he is on of my fav ops in my opinion

You just had bad luck. It‚Äôs just rng

The chances of this happening again
---
I have heard that the game fills Blue Team first, so if you have a super fast connection then you will get into the match faster and be more likely to be put on Blue team.
---
Yeah but there's also people like me who are Diamond but have to solo-queue cus my friends flat out suck and/or I just don't have a lot of time to waste. Playing Diamond solo is hell. 9/10 games there's a 3+ player group in each team and it doesn't matter that it's diamond they still won't invite u to their discord or whatever and if you don't carry you don't win cus they're not giving any callouts. It sucks cus it could literally be pro players or those really good Ytbers and they'll just leave you out to dry. Not a single game in plat 1 and above is fun when you solo-queue.

what about the MMR system changed?

You‚Äôre the real Eliza Cohen! Can you show be more ‚Äúlauncher‚Äù.

I want it as a sorta zof main

At least I thought so  maybe I‚Äôm wrong but I swear I got that in a alpha pack
---
Bait and switch is my favorite thing to do as Frost. One that never gets old, put a shield in a doorway, put a frost mat directly behind the shield, then another one a bit further away. They'll think you're an idiot, right before their shin gets snapped.
---
If we mess with Fuze's speed they'd have to go in and change his player model for every outfit he has, which we be pretty tiresome.
---
how is the game shit? there's a reason it's 4 years old
---
I just told my friend he looked like bbno$ and looked them up and saw this post. I am glad I am not the only one.

As a zofia main I approve.

I actually made one for myself. Doesn‚Äôt look that great but at a distance it‚Äôs close enough.
---
It‚Äôs alright because if he blight the season pass and any operators he‚Äôd have lost all of those with having to use a new account.
---
can you not increase fov on console?
---
Thanks, this is actually the first legendary I've gotten in the last few seasons
---
https://youtu.be/P85lLHcB8W0 hey try this if your pings still bad man worked for me
---
Yeah toxic teammates are annoying but the consistancy of the amount of toxic players they are getting can't be right. It's not common to have such strings of toxic players. Also, TKilling is meant to stop people from spraying down enemies without reason as teammates rush. Its annoying sometimes but train to not shoot your friend in the head and you'll be fine. And, if your friends refuse to play the game because of toxic players, clearly none of you have had the brilliant idea of playing as a squad to eliminate toxic players all together.

He was not that bad it‚Äôs depends on you how to deal with situation like him with perfect time I was like you at the beginning but I kept learning from him with the time. ‚Äú Take a fast step back, aim to the head ‚Äú boom! He‚Äôs gone! And you complete the mission. That‚Äôs it.

bro im too high i thought this was an in game screenshot
---
No.
---
Could‚Äôve been someone on the other team purposely giving high ping when you guys are on attack for free round wins, happened to me and my mates earlier - worse thing was they didn‚Äôt even win
---
my problem isn‚Äôt the difficulty, it‚Äôs that I use terrorist hunt to train my aim and the bomber prepares for very few realistic situations
---
Then you are on a disadvantage. I don't want anyone to be in a disadvantage, we need an equally leveled playing field.
---
Big facts. I'd bang him and I'm not even gay!

What? They removed bomber?

Not entirely. It can allow for at the very least a basic understanding of one‚Äôs ‚Äúsize‚Äù, let‚Äôs call it.

No it‚Äôs the guy who gave me the idea I asked in a recent post that I would draw people‚Äôs operator ideas and I made this one for that guy
---
Yeah a friend of mine is a pro and he said he had it happen 3 times in 200 matches.  Could only wish it was like that on PS4
---
3 times for me
---
I've had zero problem finding unranked games on PC.
---
Oh trust me, a month or 2 later, you'll not even notice the disadvantage.
---
You'll figure out downing of the enemy by paying attention to the shots you landed, the writhing of the enemy when downed and the shuffling noise of him dragging his body along or the quiet wailing. Took me about 2 months but now I have that covered. It is a rare instance where I don't figure out that I have downed somebody. And other than that, there's no other scenario where having points actually helps, so it just takes practice to hone your attention.

Fuck fortnite
---
Iq can scan my electronics any day
---
I would edit your wording to "set" instead of "bundle"to avoid confusion as we already have bundles available for sale in the game, And people are assuming this is a purchasable item.

---
Long barrel is pretty much useless in all cases except for range fights, but nearly all fights happen up close. You're better off with any other barrel attachment.
---
NOBODY knows how to play them right now because it is new to everybody, even the pass owners. So banning the new ops is working against those who ban them instead  of in their favour.
---
They are just scums who work on the ideology of "if I can't get it, neither can you".
---
For some reason it didnt let me upload with audio. Basically mira told me to put a reinforcement on that wall and then they just said the N word after I put the reinforcement down.
---
Okay not good but at least I know it‚Äôs not just me.
---
Should mention too, it only happened when we were attacking so couldn‚Äôt plant bomb, or when they were about to plant the defuser on attack: don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a server issue

It's not a bundle like you're thinking. 
---
It's part of a matching headgear and uniform for Zofia that is  only available via Alpha packs.  A few operators have these available the only way to acquire them is to roll them out of a pack one item at a time.

You cannot sadly
---
In those lower ranks it‚Äôs pretty damn toxic. The higher ranks I feel are a bit better. Not entirely of course, but it‚Äôs not every game you deal with toxic players like in the below silver to copper ranks. I found, if you wanna solo stay between silver 1 and gold 2 or so. Still toxic in those ranks but not nearly as much and ddosers are in the high plat to diamond range.  So I think that‚Äôs a good place to at least get decent solo ranked games in.
---
I mean, not many people play hostage so I seriously doubt this is anywhere on their list of things to do.
---
It‚Äôs hilarious!
---
Loved it.

Look like fakeü§î

Maybe it‚Äôs USW
---
You play from Xbox?
---
I think it's like that for all ops.
---
my friend is the one idiot who only plays hostage. also its not only the hostage, my teammate shot it then ran into it and i got banned
---
Damn i think this happened to me earlier, so many things about this player base that make it hard for new players to enjoy the game, which sucks i really like it so far.
---
Tactical drawings on her tablet or boost moral

There no longer cannot be too much of a Elo difference between teammates.   
---
This is intended to reduce carries and also stop the elo boosting.
---
Yeah I would be keen to know what regions/platforms are being hit the hardest because I rarely see cheaters on pc as well
---
Perhaps the hard breach grenade leak might be true. We'll have to see.
---
My ranked experience usually goes as follows: Lose 7 placement matches because I'm playing like a fucking bot. Literally and unironically drop to mid silver because I have truly become a bot, quit the game for a week, return with the reflexes of gods and perfect aim only to win 30 MMR at a time, so doomed to be gold stuck for the rest of the season.

It‚Äôs great, but looking at the rest of your artwork tells me that a common trend in your pieces is everything looking ‚Äútoo real‚Äù. In the search to produce photo realism, many artists make renders that are great in every aspect ‚Äî except everything looks incredibly perfect. As if not a single spot of dust dared touch any object lest they scratch it. 
---
For a render to look truly photorealistic, there must be some realistic imperfection.

I think it would move the pegi rating or something. Thats why McCree doesnt have a cigar anymore in overwatch.
---
I don‚Äôt mind bombers but the C4 rooms were bullshit

That‚Äôs incorrect the person who is DDosing will stay at their usual connection level (ping 9 for example) and everyone else in the game including your on team will be lagging or unable to move

I made this post because someone came into a gun subreddit and wanted to talk about how realistic this game was. And it isn't I play it frequently and it's honestly not a super great game just a cheap one and easy one I can play absent mindedly
---
I‚Äôve found that recording the incident and immediately opening a report with Ubisoft support can help get them banned much faster. Just upload the video to YouTube and link it to them in the chat. Make sure to get the scoreboard in it for a long period. I‚Äôve started every round with my scoreboard pulled up for a few seconds so they can see it if I experience it. 
---
I‚Äôve also experienced a lot of ‚Äúlag switching‚Äù but I honestly think they are just doing a light DDOS on the server to cause lag but not actually crash it.
---
Yeah that game is devoid of creativity

Yes but they aren't doing that because that leaves a chance for solo queue players to get banned as well if they are unlucky. There really isn't a way to find who the ddosers are without leaving a chance for innocent players to get banned.

Yes I‚Äôve been getting sound glitches a lot more in this season
---
Not ubi. PlayStation and xbox
---
it's a midlife  crisis for being banned so much
---
I don‚Äôt see Cav bans that often because she‚Äôs not hard to deal with and she never really gets to get an interrogation off and Clash, while she is very annoying and sometimes a pain to get rid of, is one less gun on the other team and she‚Äôs only really ‚Äògood‚Äô if she stays alive to the very end of a round and Lesion is annoying but it‚Äôs not necessarily hard to get rid of which is why I think he isn‚Äôt banned often from my experiences.
---
lol @ unsupported video driver, they could shut up about that already.
---
They can‚Äôt prevent ddosing..
---
Tbh there are variants for sweaty players.
---
At the bottom there are just players who are kinda sweaty just to win a round to clutch up. Literally happened to me in my placements where I went 12-4 and still lost the game. Found myself in a 1-4, which I won, then a 1v3 next round which I lost. 
---
Then there are the ones who are sweaty and tryharding all game. Those players with the super fast turn arounds, trying to flick onto every enemy‚Äôs head and then getting pissy when they die.
---
Then there‚Äôs the actual sweat who only plays Ash and J√§ger no mater what the score is or the map. These are the most common sweats I encounter.
---
Lastly, there‚Äôs the epitome of sweatiness which is all of the above but against lower ranks in competitive while they get boosted by their friends. This is because not only are they a Plat 2 facing silver 4 players but they‚Äôre literally tryharding. 
---
Lest we forget, the classic kbm users on console. I never thought they were too much of an issue until I came across a three stack who were all clearly using mkb. Super fast turns with perfect stops, perfect aim and accuracy, etc. They‚Äôre literally console cancer.
---
Np. Ranked is a mess sometimes. If you like, play some unranked for a week or two and save the high MMR you get (and lose obv) for when the ranks have settled and you mainly play against correctly ranked players.
---
Old Flame I presume?

You realize the vector is a 45acp pistol caliber carbine  that takes Glock mags right? 
---
You're defending a video game that makes that pcc deal less damage per shot that a 9x19 ar-9 that also takes Glock mags 
---
You're arguing as if 9x19mm velocity has any difference in a video game where they haven't even factored in sights working in the game. 
---
Height over bore isn't a thing because the bullets leave your forehead in a video game and have zero drop or terminal ballistic features

Mira's a very strong operator. Once you get an idea of where are the best places to set your black mirrors, you'll become on of the best Players on your team. But the same can be said from Goyo. I'd stick to good old Mira
---
Oh so it's a new skin. There is a similar skin for Cav/Capitao secondary.
---
That‚Äôs very odd, but it may be because of the elo lock implemented last season
---
Wish he'd just stop being a scrub and ascend already

It depends on how many matches your win during the ranking and how well you did in those matches

yes

I don't know anything about actual bundles, i've just assumed these by the pic.
---
They literally changed ranked so people don‚Äôt get carried.

Why do you need to be carried instead of just playing the game?
---

Same here. Yesterday Ying throw her nade into bathroom on outback and just jump trough window sprinted to bedroom and killed me from behind. no sound queue of her movement at all. And i can continue and continue. To me it happens always after using op¬¥s ability.
---
On console its not hackers but ddosers freezing/booting the servers.
---
Basically they do this:
---
Freezing
---
Their attack: Freeze everyone during prep phase (def cant reinforce etc) then plant and freeze afterwards (defenders cant get to defuser)
---
Their defense: Freeze attackers from start of round, atk cant get to building.
---
Ddosers get elo and opponents lose.
---
Booting
---
Happens during operator selection, they basically boot the servers and cancel the game. 
---
Nobody gets elo from this and it doesnt count as a game.
---
It's gotten so bad that this season I have played approx 20-30 games, but I have completed 4 placements (!). 2 of those placements we played against freezers so stood in spawn for 2 rounds and surrendered.
---
So about 90% of lobbies are booted...
---
that was your wifi the plug icon in the top right indicates a client side issue not server side
---
The system is incredibly complicated but to my knowledge it takes into account your performance in those games and your past ranks.
---
i owned a couple of operators tho in each season. so if it revokes the yearly pass would it take my old ops i had already unlocked? I dont know how they would do that.
---
If you do it in t hunt you'll want to do it in multiplayer. Don't do it.
---
New operator screen renders them lower resolution
---
Skyscraper is a good map. Way better than those defender sided maps

i don't exactly know if there is actually a region problem or not, but from what i've seen and had myself, it's a uplay/pc problem.. try uninstalling uplay completely, try cleaning the files /registry/temp files manually or if all else fails reinstalling windows
---
Nope, when you have a lag and "come back", your position is re-updated, including your camera/view. I was pointing my mouse down but it stuck to the wall.
---
The ACOG takes a little time to adjust to but once you do it‚Äôs amazing, super-CQC fights can be a little disorientating though.
---
Yeah but it happens to everyone (I asked my teammates and they confirmed), so can't be my connection only.
---
I‚Äòd go with a 1x scope if you want to play vertical a lot (e.g. consulate basement attack from piano, villa etc.) and with an acog if it‚Äòs more about opening some walls and holding angles (consulate top floor attack from yellow skylight etc.)

---
This happens in basically every FPS, so it doesnt bother me really.
---
I've yet to experience a DDOS in about 15-20 hours of playing. 
---
&gt;you‚Äôre loud as hell but the enemy is quieter than a mouse, sound still not working, shields that can be shot through, stun grenades not actually stunning, CLIENT. SIDE. DEBRIS.
---
Yeah. These issues have been few and far between for me so far, luckily.
---
&gt;you can have a good time all you want, but siege is the crappiest built game, for a game revolving around sound and sights, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be very good at it does it?
---
Idk, I'm enjoying it very much and having few issues. Not sure why you've taken my question into just complaining about the game in such a way.
---
I use Compensator and Angled grip. It has zero recoil, so vertical grip is a waste. As for sights, use whichever you want, all of them (including red-dot) are viable since the gun is a laser. But DO NOT use suppressor unless you're good with headshots, as her gun is a peashooter.
---
Yeah that one

Thanks for the feedback. And yeah, the gadget is all about utility. After all, drones are the most crucial part of any Attacker's arsenal. Hope something like this happens, Twitch is the only op since release that has any unique drone on attack.
---
Kept asking people last night and you know how that goes.

Game is significantly quieter. I thought my settings were dimmed or something. Hopefully Ubi releases a hotfix.

Actually Ubisoft have only Microsoft to blame since they rent the Azure servers, Ubisoft can do absolutely nothing about DDOSers.
---
Your kd plays nothing. No.
---
It's not Ubisoft's servers that are on console. Siege on console is on Microsoft's and Sony's servers. Blame them not Ubi. It's also Microsoft and Sony's rules about updates that prevents a test server on console too.

Mozzie looks closer.  They had to include Monty's shield so they made him slightly smaller.

Not always.  Burnt Horizon was released on a wednesday for exemple. And some other seasons.

Bruh, dokkebi is the ddoser
---
when my friends play mira I always put an evol eye on the other side to kedd with him
---
I'm so disappointed...
---
Yes, yes it is
---
Yes this is the right question. In my 600+ hours of gameplay I've only seen two people hack obviously. They wiped the floor with the enemy team while we were still in droning phase without losing 1 hp. 
---
But 99% of the hackers I saw were just using hacking options that can only be proven by in depth video analysis or even post-game analysis.
---
Seems odd, may be worth reporting it as a bug to https://r6fix.ubi.com/ so that Ubisoft can take a look at it and see if it's a reoccurring bug, or if it was a one time thing.
---
Oh no she‚Äôs a hard breather, she opens up reinforced walls! And she can do it from a distance

5 or 6 kills on a 9 round match though? Although there is far more to this game than getting kills, consuming caffeine won‚Äôt actually make you play better. 
---
Caffeine makes some people jittery. It could potentially ruin your focus. Like me, for example. Not good advice.
---
Why Hibana with her old face?
---
Year 4 season 4 confirmed
---
Because there isn't the new one in high resolution; just like Twitch.
---
Of the cheaper ones I like Buck and Capitao personally, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting Capitao if you‚Äôre new. Buck is fun and easy to understand
---
It helps me focus, anyway.
---
Hibana is much more mobile than thermite and can mess with bandit when he tries to destroy your charges by placing charges everywhere. She can also be fairly safer when she opens hatches and all. So it's a less effective but much safer thermite.
---
Try with custom game?
---
You can connect your controller to your PC
---
Pathetic....

As a Zofia main, I want this badly.

Ddos are still active huh...guess I won't play r6 for a while

I believe currently they're only available to those who bought the season pass/year 3 pass. Wait a week and then purchase with renown.
---
Nice work man I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll love it

I was wondering the same thing because they‚Äôre not on the operator list.

You have to be a year pass holder to get them now. If you don‚Äôt have it, then you have to wait until next week
---
They‚Äôll be available Wednesday
---
Season pass, that‚Äôs how I got them. They will be available for everyone soon.
---
The 69 health wasn‚Äôt at the end so I think your title ain‚Äôt good
---
The year 4 pass owners have them early access for a week . non-season pass people need to wait a week after release then they can be bought
---
Just quit cos last 3 of my games were DDoS

‚ÄúStop, don‚Äôt fuse the hostage.‚Äù *instantly pulls the trigger killing the teammate trying to extract the hostage and the hostage*

theres nothing they can do, aside from make an entire new team for banning ddosers on console

No, test battle pass is coming later this season and the full one is coming next season

Hibana every day of the week

The frost mats are smaller and cooler
---
Hibana, she's one of the best ops in the game, Ying isn't that great anymore
---
Well maybe they could try out hardware bans that they issue through Microsoft and Sony to punish them once enough claims have been made against a team or player
---
Hibana unless you like big mags
---
That would make for a nice coaster
---
Oof
---
year 1 bundle was released around may 2017, i think we were half way to nearly finished into year 2
---
They added more report options which is a good thing but hopefully they actually review them this time. Cheaters were getting so out of hand at one point I got a notification that they were banned everytime I login.

The smurfs are because the season just came out and people are trying to hit champion.

In casual it isn't static you have a hidden mmr independent from ranked mmr. It should be the same there but it isn't.
---
Ah yes the cons-I mean pc master race at its best
---
which would also be an undertaking for them and most likely not worth it since its better to primarily focus on pc, theres a very noticeable difference in server quality from pc to console
---
Ugh the smores are disgusting
---
I'm aware it isnt static, I was talking about the new unranked mode. And no it shouldn't have a hidden or independent MMR, that's the whole point of the "unranked" part
---
Well this is the 6th time it gets reposted

Interesting idea . Maybe it shud be invisible like yokai but everytime someone scans with it, it gives out a small flash . Like a camera flash. Dim enuf that  it can't be seen easily but also visible if looked at

I understand but at the same time the majority of players that play siege are found on console, not only that but this is a huge issue thats killing off players &amp; potential investors

ffs this is some bullshit. It was working perfectly fine before, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

I didnt notice anything out ofnthe ordinary but I also wasnt focusing on it so there could be a slight change?

I can guarantee he does it in ranked because I've heard countless bum ü§°s say this same shit in ranked when they get called out for their bull shit. Usually when they're called out for not comming, going solo and dying with the defuser, etc. "I'm just trying to have fun!" somehow is an acceptable excuse for being a complete ü§° in ranked to these idiots.
---
Well thank you for the honesty.
---
Well, the ddos service wasn't easily able to shut down my website. Versus if you hit an R6 server for literally 1 second your ping goes to 10k and the server is frozen for about 10 seconds. Ubi just needs to implement some decent ddos protection lmao
---
Lol
---
Thank you. I literally posted a clip of amaru literally sprinting up behind me and not making a sound. I thought I was crazy
---
If you pay attention there's these awesome connection warning icons in the upper right, and 2 pop up right as you engage her to warn you of high long and server desync.

You gotta admit it, R6 skins are far behind these in CSGO

---
It something weird, there are also a few bundles in shop without rarity too (like bandit hannover bundle)
---
Please do it.
---
Tachanka‚Äôs scream kinda sounded like something out of For Honor
---
Reminds me of the popular spider drone concept that can cling to the walls and ceiling while moving quietly.
---
Why would you swap to a different console?
---
It‚Äôs almost like you play in a elo where people don‚Äôt drone before you rush. You don‚Äôt rush just to catch the other team off guard, you rush to lock down an area and disrupt. If your Amaru rushes a site and dies within the first seconds that‚Äôs on the player not the operator. The loadout is on the weaker side, but it‚Äôs all about synergy. Make noise in other areas so amaru can get in through a different way.  Not bad operators, just bad players.
---
This is really good, please do more.

Everyone has already seen this you don‚Äôt need to post it

You‚Äôre the same dude to complain about fortnite skins losing ‚Äòrarity‚Äô and ‚Äòexclusivity‚Äô ‚Äî get over yourself. You aren‚Äôt owed anything from the devs for playing the game earlier than others. If you‚Äôre over level 400, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got plenty of seasonal skins, early pro league sets, the glacier bundle, early challenge charms + skins, etc.
---
Welcome to my attempts on getting ranked up through an entire server
---
I mean shadows already give an advantage so it makes sense to adapt your brightness to see them anyway
---
It's an art tablet glove, I think. Saw those in my old digital art class.
---
Actually that‚Äôs lion and smoke.
---
That's the team liquid charm from the pilot program
---
Ohh thank you. Do you know why they started doing that?
---
There used to be no penalty for that. Then people would unplug their ethernet cables or turn off their computers if they were losing. Trust me this is the lesser of all evils
---
No all 4 sites are defendable, there‚Äôs not a bad site on the map 
---
Also really easy to roam on that map, has 4 staircases around the map
---
It would take such a insignificant amount of storage for that.
---
Noting a timestamp like "naxelk left the game 12:30:47" 1200 times would take about 80 kb.
---
Obviously you don't have to note it that many times.
---
Note it when someone leaves, check in the next four minutes to see if the player has rejoined the server. If not, handle out a ban, if the player is back, do nothing.
---
After each game this log can just be removed.
---
I've done this on my servers several times and the storage space is honestly not worth fighting for.
---
I agree that there should be a leave penalty, but not this kind of way.
---
Do it exactly like now, but do a timecheck. If the match ends, ignore the timecheck.
---
Im sorry to hear that buddy. Idk if its this season but my squad and I played afew games and during those games 2 of my teammates game crashed then got an error and got banned. Weirdly at that same time they got kicked 2 ppl on the other team got kicked so it was a 3 vs 3 and only 1 round in... idk whats happening but Bugisoft better figure that one out lol

‚ÄúSupernova ace‚Äù gets like 4 kills with the smg
---
Many people think Ela has good guns, which is wrong. Ela's scorpion "which although is of a carbine model" has the second lowest damage for an smg in the entire game (the lowest being the vector with a higher rof), uncontrollable recoil, and mediocre range. Her shotgun is way overrated. it has a slower max fire rate than the sasg of the Spetznaz, mediocre spread, also mediocre range, and quite low damage, and when it came came out, it was at weak as it is today. the best shotgun, which im really sad u dont know, is of course the m870 (lol)
---
Yeah always when I tabbed out it happened
---
Yup, what the actual fuck were they thinking when they implemented that?
---
A lot of those skins are not exclusive to the T-89
---
Can you explain it to me too please? I have no clue what this is about.
---
Perhaps they've just not been bought, or people don't want to use them?
---
I don't have Any Elite Skins because i prefer the  Vanilla skins-
---
Same here

Impatient child.

Cloud 9, a new one.

I didn‚Äôt say the Scorpion was good at all. But idgaf what you say her shotgun is top tier it absolutely shots on people and is better than the dumbass SASG everybody obsesses over
---
At least for me in the PS4 I have found more blue screen (crashes) than DDossers tbh. For example: yesterday I got 3 blue screens 1 after the other
---
thats nice. some people say casual is very toxic while i experience almost zero problems with toxicity and if i do i can always leave and move on

---
Yes they will never get rid of ddossing I get that, but if ubisoft knows how big of a problem ddos is in ranked, why in the name of fucking jesus christ would they suddenly implement 24 hours time ban after getting kicked out of a ranked game?!!
---
Because nobody plays the game anymore due to fucking ddosing and ubisoft long over due answer to its solution. ( 4 months)

ok, so her shotgun is kind of a shotgun of extreme. it is sort of midground, and it is build around the rof, and it takes time to kill, unlike the 12-gauges wielded by the sas or gsg9

That would be great

Yea it‚Äôs the opposite for me casual is always a pain with team killing and people acting like asses , so unranked has been awesome for me when not playing ranked , plus it has pick n ban shorter rounds and ranked maps n it‚Äôs only bomb so that‚Äôs also a plus
---
All 3 are pretty averages
---
Ela, nice shotgun and a good gadget 
---
Finka, has frag grenades, that's the most interesting thing about her

Ying, has an average lmg and her ability can be useful but after the rework she's much more difficult to use effectively

I mean one match of unranked and you‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs shit?
---
I was plat 3 last season and now im plat 3 so i dont think they did anything wrong buddy
---
Yea I‚Äôm on PS4 and my friends aren‚Äôt really into siege so my only shot at normal games is having my mic in and getting matched with normal human beings and then sticking with em

Ela is one of the worst operators in game currently so anyone else is better.

I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs hilarious

Good morning!

People launching ddos attacking are usually IP spoofing. No IP=no trace.
---
They could however ban the account.

Because it still records it as you left the match.

I mean, to be fair I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs exactly what a ‚Äúhome cosplay‚Äù is. Making as close as you can to what the character looks like using just what‚Äôs around your house, not going out and buying supplies and clothes to be as accurate as possible
---
yes, they were
---
I understand that i cant win every game but still for fuksakes the skill difrences between the teams are huge my other teammates literally had 0 kills almost every match and the enemies were all plats
---
I do agree though I think the ranking should be affected by your performance because I went 5 and 5 and got gold 1 but I should have been like plat 2 every game I had more than 10 kills but my teamates were just so bad if they made it so your performance affected your rank that would be much better
---
IQ or twitch would probably be your best shot at getting rid of his GUs
---
Usually i stay aggresive for one tick of damage then pull it out if i haven't been pushed. Seems to do the trick most of the time
---
He must've just had some bad placements, but if he's a previous plat he should have no problem getting back up there
---
Ahhh yes network cards. 25$.
---
This is a thing you can do?
---
Finka
---
Cause ubi can't tell if the disconnect was intentional or not all they know is your account left the match
---
I feel like you have to play casual for not be banned if you know you are leaving the game.
---
So I'm guessing this is the maximal value for R6 coins ?
---
That tends to happen when you solo-queue and don‚Äôt have comms with our teammates
---
Yes. I see obvious problems with penalty for leaving. I dont wanna end matches with toxic assholes in them neither i want to suffer through several or even one game with assholes just to get one game with adequate people

Lmfaooo just realized ‚Äújackal main‚Äù yea man there isn‚Äôt a game that jackal isn‚Äôt banned for me , luckily I don‚Äôt really have a main besides valk n she never really gets banned

My second rate quit on unranked and it escalates from 1 hour to 24 hours.

No you need to buy it with actual money (r6 credits) elites cannot be unlocked thru renown , and I agreee with them avoid having a bright gold helmet on , plus they don‚Äôt even look that cool

Hello runawaycandy513! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Don‚Äôt quit on unranked? Just play casual if you‚Äôre going to quit.
---
why do you think you deserve it? the reason why the skins are no more available is because the game rewards players who support early and the skins are a thank you
---
Definitely the wrong place to look for that
---
Play casual if you're going to rage quit.
---
No firearms beyond this point
---
You guys can play this game? Every match at least 1-2 people crash. I've played maybe 15-20 matches since the update and I have prob crashed 6-8 times at least
---
That's the point, stop abandoning just cause you cant control your rage.
---
Lol wow, why do you deserve i?. Maybe because I have over 1000 hours and want something actually good out of ubisoft for once?

This might be true but having switched to pc from Xbox and losing out on red crow and velvet seasonal skins and not being able to rebuy them is very sad
---
Great job!
---
I agree with this, as a day one player I own all seasonal skins through choice of being a collector except for one released during Grim sky. I respect that there are players who do not have them and so it shows who has played longer. Each skin is a symbol of each season they were released in, like that of the ranked charms. This idea would reflect badly on players who bought them with the sole intention of having rare never to be released again content.
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of the penalty, stop quitting in competitive matches. You just end up screwing over yourself and your teammates

I only use the Gold skin but if the gun as Black ice, ill use it instead of Gold.

Over a thousand hours yet it took me only a second to unninstall this steamy peice of shit for games i can actually control my character mister "we feel the player should always have control over their character" and sadly this community is as big as joke as ubi for just trying to pretend nothing is happening and or just shitting on people who are only complaining cuase they payed 60$ for a game they cant even play anymore and that they cared about. Yea fuck you ubi and the community.

Not sure why you want an AR15 when you already have its full auto variants in the game. Either the DPS will be too low since its semi auto or it will function like a DMR like Kaid shotgun and people will hate it.
---
I'd be curious to see how a sniper would preform in this game.
---
Looks pretty fotoshopped to be fair
---
IQ couldn‚Äôt take it anymore
---
This is the only universal skin I have, and I'm very glad that it's this one. It looks really good on most guns.
---
Ok so I'll opt for a copper mindset haha thanks for the input
---
I'd say asking for Ela smg to be buffed because you can't be bothered to control its recoil is pretty mal informed. If her SMG bothers you so much, use the shotgun.
---
no
---
I was asking for a competitive shooter. I know ARMA is more realistic but it isn‚Äôt really the same type of game.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve never played a ranked match in the plat &amp; diamond level
---
says the console fag that cant handle a big white boy running at him
---
You should write to R6 techincal support or google it up
---
That's "Aki no Tsuru", one of the four Y1S4 (Operation Red Crow) universal seasonal skins, which incidentally was the season Hibana was introduced.

This was on this reddit a while ago

Man, that's tuff
---
Must be cos she took off the chest plate that made her look like she had PS1 era Laura Croft tiddies.
---
Because people wanted to practice ranked, so if you had the casual settings with people leaving every round, it wouldn't be so competitive.
---
It used to be that reloads were not cancelable, and they \*fixed\* that. Rainbow is not about tactical realism. Go play Insurgency or Squad for that. Rainbow is about reaction and aim (this particular area)
---
If you are talking about what they use to hit the server off it's usually a ip stresser. Most people use free ip stressers instead of paying for a botnet spot.
---

---
only gripe i have is the weapons. nobody‚Äôs ever going to pick the T-5 over the G36 i feel like. full AR, with an ACOG. maybe give us a choice between the G36 and the 552 or 556xi. or a shotty for the memes
---
I got a sick common
---
Noooo don't normalize reused weapons.
---
My eyes are bleeding
---
I wish we could of just switched them on/off instead tbh because now Terrorist Hunt is way too easy. It would be nice to see them replace the Bomber with a new AI enemy tho. Maybe a sniper who camps windows maybe?
---
ah yeah, they keep nerfing dem peace boys
---
Probably older than you, and its a video game meant to have fun in. And im sorry your life is so dissapointing that you have to sweat and think anything remotely non competitive shouldnt be in a game. Repetitive use of "petulant" doesnt make you seem smarter either since you havent used it correctly in either instance.

I have a Ryzen set up so what I did was open up AMD Ryzen Master. You can download this on their website( depending on your CPU). It shows you your current set up for each cores speed, if any are disabled, your voltage control, etc...
---
From there if you notice next to cores disabled that you have 2 or 4 or 6. You can enable it by clicking reset at the top right while Current tab is high lighted. That will put your cores back to 0 disabled and your machine will restart. After that you can change your profile to Creator Mode, Game mode, or a Profile of your desire (you can also keep current mode as it will have all cores enabled at that time).  However, I do not advise changing your speed or voltage as it will void AMD warranty.  Unless you know how to overclock. I'd keep it as is.

lol for the record that wasnt me

It‚Äôs already has good damage and rate of fire so giving it more ammo may be a bit much

What do you mean? Just arrest them ez clap.  Five head plays.  Idk what op thinks he accomplished here.  I'm pretty sure people performing cyber attacks know it's illegal.

True, but I‚Äôd be willing to give up a few points of damage or a recoil change for a little more ammo. It does good damage, but 20 shots feels like nothing, at least she has the bearing.
---
Are we going to say Insurgency isn't immerse or realistic. Insurgency Sandstorm has lots of ballistic physics, gas masks that work, when you toss a mag you actually toss it, you have the option to pocket a partially used mag, and weapons behave somewhat realistically.
---
Every gun in Siege allows full mag bullet swapping without ever considering how much of the magazine you've already used. Reload canceling is no more immersion breaking than that.

ok

My unpopular opinion - casual should be all the maps not in ranked. 
---
No, not really I suppose, but I don‚Äôt want to be denied the chance to enjoy playing the smaller footprint maps. Balance might be lacking, but isn‚Äôt casual about having fun?

i just bought the nora rengo uniform and use the twitch prime gun skin with it... can't really tell the difference tbh

Is there a way to reduce this? I have astigmatisms and I don‚Äôt need any help making lights bloom, I actually adjust where I physically place myself in maps because I can‚Äôt see.

Then you can play with your friends, they just don‚Äôt want to play with you. Top friends there üëç

Yes I am.The thing is that I posted that text before, in which I mentioned that I was playing on console and the subreddit bot removed it because it thought that I wanted to report a bug.I had to change the title and it is not as clear as the previous post was
---
*insert that pikachu meme*
---
Yes it has happened multiple times and then the game has crashed like 10 times
---
I know they have to disrupt the beams but I didn‚Äôt know it went through his legs
---
Apart from the problem of genuine silvers getting spanked by a smurf?
---
It doesn't
---
But it's not an argument from realism, it makes sense to make reloads uninterruptible from a gameplay perspective. Having to makes decisions about when to reload would make sense.
---
Then they add Thanos as an operator too, right? Make them all default dance
---
I play Xbox and I‚Äôve never experienced it in all my play time idk if people do it in higher ranks or on other platforms or what. What players are being Ddosed?
---
Pretty sure you can't drop more than one rank a game. It should show you on the graph where you are, pay attention and make sure that's actually happening
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
i checked the rank guide yesterday, there is a silver, bronze and copper V, as well as no Gold IV
---
I figured. I find it strange that all of the ddosers came out of nowhere and are on such a massive scale. I know it's frustrating but just stay away from ranked for a bit, I am sure it will be fixed quick
---
Counldnt have said it better myself

Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt even old enough to play this lmao üòÇ

Is the measured skin not in the game anymore?

I mean it‚Äôs a difference if you pay 32‚Ç¨ for 7200 credits or 50‚Ç¨ if you want all Pilot Programm skins you‚Äôll Safe a lot of money that way
---
Its fookin laser cause ual
---
Nice username lmao
---
To be honest,ddosers existed before this update too.But when the new season came,it's like they multiplied themselves,they are everywhere now.Not only on Ranked but on the new Unranked game mode too!
---
No they're seasonal exclusives for a reason
---
But he‚Äôs kind of right, the dumbest shit works since no one is expecting it
---
That's a screebshot in the overview
---
As a redskins fan myself, I have to say your dad joke was real good.
---
That doesn't help because knifing and leaning are tied to the same button.  You can move knife off R3, but that also moves leaning away.
---
Good shit. I got 4 real quick last night with kapkan and they forfeited on me üò£
---
Well it's probably 4 vs 1, and he knew this change was coming. Identical or not, not having points to play for makes it a snoozefest.
---
Phantom sky? It's phantom sight and grim sky.
---
I dont know what that is unfortunately.. im new to minecraft lol seems like a fun game though
---
Then buy a current seasonal skin and play for the next year, boom it's rare.
---
Damn it, I get the names mixed up at times
---
Oh yeah
---
Vigil hes fun his guns are fun and cant really go wrong with him
---
gotta wait a few weeks after the season comes out, all the sweaties and tryhards dogpile on the game right after an update comes out.
---
Done
---
Or unranked, the new game mode genius
---
love to see it
---
You are gonna get really bored really quick, the game is the same exact thing over and over again, I guess you can say the same for rainbow but you also cant, rainbow has a diverse bunch of ops with a whole arsenal of weapons to pick from, in minecraft all you do is spawn in punch a tree make a house mine for hours just to find 4 diamonds, try to kill the ender dragon, kill him the end
---
that‚Äôs just rude
---
mp5
---
Wouldn't it be as simple as disconnecting a player with a high ping count? Say a 500ms Max would get you a disconnect and then they would be given a rejoin prompt. That way it becomes a hassle to stress the servers, and if say you have a random ping spike it won't penalize you for it.
---
Congrats :)
---
This is so amazing and so horrible at the same time
---
If the enemies kill the hostage they lose
---
The other team killed the hostage
---
When the goyo charge hits the hostage, the game counts it as the defenders killing the hostage
---
Goyos shield exploded, therefore making him kill the hostage with the flames
---
To be fair Japan in general likes a lot of red, red flag, cars and other things like antiques, red mushroom clouds
---
The fo-12 is actually one of the worst shotguns for game. Almost every primary does better damage per pellet at both cqc and long ranges.  It only does more damage than most shotguns at mid range. Because the fo-12 is one of the only shotguns that have a mid range stat number. And yes that's with an extended barrel.
---
Thanks! Had one ace and two 4ks I believe. Sometimes you just have a good game!
---
These are the most unique skins in the game wdym  i cant spot a single simmalarity
---
Still waiting for an airsoft version
---
One of the enemies had shot the hostage in the chaos of your hockey puck launcher, and then shot them again which killed them.
---
Happens to me every ranked game
---
Mate. Just try it again a few times.  Don‚Äôt give a knee jerk reaction to one game, that‚Äôs just fucking stupid. Honestly. 
---
I‚Äôve played like 4 matches of unranked and I‚Äôm already thinking it‚Äôs a great idea. Not too serious but not too casual. Perfect for a few warm up games before playing ranked. Just put your rage to one side and calm down my friend.
---
Because what killed the hostage was one of Goyo's Vulcan shields. If those kill a hostage, it counts against the defensive.
---
The fire from the enemies shield killed the hostage after you hit them with the explosion
---
Whats with the garbage ass resolution?
---
To be fair, Eldorado was a seasonal skin, not an exclusive to hibana
---

Fair enough but id rather punch a tree make a house and mine 24/7 than get ddossed 24/7 ya know

They are punished. You cannot reload and ADS. Also, reloading (and adsing) is loud and is interrupted by sprinting.

This has been happening a lot on xbox as well, they would spike everyone‚Äôs ping right before they plant, and in most cases we‚Äôd be unable to do anything about it. People have also been hitting servers for the sake of not losing the game. Has happened at least once every 5 games or so since the new update came out.

Did it have a hat?

She is an entry fragger op, made to be the first in, with an acog she holds angles instead of doing her job, and by taking away the acog on the r4c it slightly raised the usage of the g36c that has an acog, and slightly lowered her pickrate which was a bit too high(didn‚Äôt change too much, people still picked ash regardless)

Not really, I have seen a lot of people that have old things but rarely plays.

Is cause we only bloods out here

It's not a huge deal, 4 silvers and a plat 3 against 5 silvers. It's not freaking 5x Beaulo against 5x bronze we talking about. This man's plat 3.

It‚Äôs a shotgun. If she‚Äôs far away then she can‚Äôt kill you. If she‚Äôs close then it‚Äôs normal to die fast to a shotgun
