I take great pleasure in being the 69th upvote on this post.

I'm simply telling the truth. Not getting spawnkilled is by far one of the easiest things to accomplish in this game. You simply take 2 seconds to be aware and watch for shit, if you do that you drastically reduce your chances of being spawnkilled. Can you still get killed even tho you're aware? Sure, there are always going to be spots you didn't know of and simply bad luck, but that's part of the game. A little gamesense and awareness will usually save you.
---
Does this mean I never get spawn killed? Of course not, I get spawn killed probably once every day. But every time I do it's because I played stupid and didn't check shit, and that's my fault for playing stupid.
---
*also downvote = salt*
---
Big gay
---
That’s pretty awesome. 
---
Idk mozzie looks pretty feminine to me
---
At least OP would be prepared for an assassins creed cosplay if they do get rid of some
---
I play ranked quite a bit though and I do great with maverick. Everyone else who plays maverick I noticed does great too.

Thanx

When you get past silver, the time to get a match takes longer fyi 
---
Well if you’re feeling generous...
---
You had to have played *before* the event started, and then you played during it also.
---
She has a travel book? Do you have any high res shots of it? I didn't even know that was a physical prop!
---
I didn’t downvote you weirdo. I didn’t say I was playing stupid, just annoying how there are four fuckin windows a boosted doc can run out of and gun down at least one person before they can react. Sure we could take our time to learn the map, my fault. But its still fucking annoying. 
---
Sexy. 
---
Oh ok that’s how I missed it then
---
With a leg holster for counterbalance
---
Im plat 3, and it never tames 2 min to find a game lol, last season used to take more than 2 minutes but not this season so far
---
I think it went over your head..... 
---
I'm pretty sure that version is the one that had to be paid for, literally just a dark version of the free one.
---
Superkick paaaarty
---
Can someone get this operator a Nomad main flair!
---
Get a job
---
I can’t see the T-posing Recruit?
---
Nice one pre
---
Maybe the clip is longer then that I jus cut it down but he isn’t doing anything mostly just walking in circles.
---
Possibly I also turned on my laptop a minute before it happened but I always do that so you might be right 
---
As is the way of things
---
Just a joke bud but oky
---
I've played for 3 weeks and got silver 1. I am complete garbage if you're that good at silver
---
I really wish the Oil Spill skin was universal and not just pistols, one of the nicest skins in the game in my opinion.
---
Oh no an OP that might actually do something for a team other than abuse glitches.
---
I will agree on one point. Maps where there are like 6 different windows facing a spawn like Themepark are terribly designed and drastically increase the chances of getting spawnkilled because you have to literally check 6 windows on different floors right out of spawn.
---
I’d say sledge personally because his gadget is always there 🙈 
---
on tk damage reversal doesn't do anything to help in your current story.
---
Nor would it help if the griefing team would rotate TKing the same guy so they would never get punished.

I’m literally trying to get the exact same uniform and headgear right now
---
my first black ice was for the fmg, and I also have a black ice for the m45.
---
brother, is that you?
---
nah I did nothing they just killed themselves to me
---
Honestly depending on your rank I would just leave as it's just a game where it doesn't affect you in real life.
---
I never had an opinion on either of them, then I got black ice for the g36... so in my opinion, g36 best gun
---
Thatcher is useful if you have a thermite or hibana in the squad, sledge is good all round operator with a good secondary. I would choose sledge.
---
Sledge all the way. 
---
I don’t see the point in thatcher, really... I mean, wow, you can un-electrify walls..? 
---
Someone please prove me wrong I don’t see why people like thatcher someone educate me 
---
Exactly. This is just the normal salty post thats quickly typed up after losing a ranked due to two leavers as one of us got bodied by a runner out every round. We just never learn. After a while it’ll be like nothing to counter them though, just like theme park.
---
This makes me very mad...
---
I agree
---
Damn that sucks. I only noticed last night because my squad wanted to rush so I was running into the border like an idiot trying to vault over it lol
---
When the other team is about to lose they lag up the severs which causes a connection error and sends everyone back to the menu. This causes the match to be nullified. No one wins or gets the loss. It ends up just being a waste of about 20-45 minutes of your boosters and time.
---
Took me months to find out that sledges hammer can deteriorate
---
You expect her to work on her bike all day without going to the bathroom?
---
Maybe 50, I have work but when I play I only really do ranked

ok fine

here's a kiss *Muah*

I would pay Big Money for that.

They can't t-bag you if they are blown up

At least u got MVP lol

There is no "best" defender op. However suggestions for really good ones are.
---
Doc. Stims revive and heal.
---
Rook. Armor is always a good thing.
---
Jager. Great gun and helpful gadget.
---
Vigil. Decent gadget and awesome guns.
---
Lesion. Still good despite his nerf.
---
This is actually very accurate 9.2/10 lost .8 cause no drugs and an, oh my, an ACOG? *GASP* jokes aside nice cosplay mate would love to see more Male cosplay honestly.
---
Or they could just wait for someone to load in
---
Not yet.
---
just report them for toxic behavior, it'll get reviewed and if they seem they were toxic it'll be taken care of
---
I'm on PS4 and it's not
---
Shotguns don’t get a headshot multiplier
---
because of the changes done to the shields they are completely knackered. When I play Montagne, regardless if I'm fully extended my shield is lodged in my chest side ways exposing limbs and other things to shoot at. PLEASE FIX! it hurts so much as a monte main that I can't even play him :c         
---
P.S. Mozzie's pest launcher, when discharged, has a chance to shoot a pest and destroy/despawn on impact. This destroys the pest and makes it unrecoverable. as a future mozzie main this also makes me sad :c x2
---
Is that an ACOG I see?
---
I'm not trapped in here with you 
---
*thunk sound*
---
YOU'RE ALL TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME

Year 2: Velevet Shell and Operation Health. The game was admittedly pretty buggy but this was when Siege still had a mixture of old veteran players and some newcomers. All of the Operators had straight forward gadgets and Hereford Base was normal.
---
It’s insta headshot any pellet 
---
I see me!! good content. v proud of you&lt;3

Glaz and anyone with smokes
---
Is it under the Situations tab? Cause i’m positive it got Dumpstered on PC.
---
it's a glitch. it's not for this week. wait until tomorrow or next tuesday for it
---
Not really you shot a bit high and left, all the pellets don’t go inside the reticle circle
---
Now THIS is a fuking good cosplay
---
*What about the dev attack on the ACOGs?*
---
Looks awesome, definitely want something similar to pull my place together. Props to the artist, seriously sucks that someone other than him is profiting off this. 
---
That's a Nomad but ok...
---
i really dont want to say it online the guy might see it or something but..
---
so i joined the match (casual) i play for a bit then get tk'd the guy leaves the game another dude says "good job we might lose its all your fault" then the last player on our team dies and they win the dude says "have fun in copper fa\*\*ot then continues to talk about how i should go to a train station and lay down in the tracks
---
Can you be my new DRUG(/s) dealer¿
---
I am all for it. Any change that replaces his shield is great. 
---
I mean Gridlock seems ok. Did they really have to buff her like this?

is this an exploit? I've never heard of it being an exploit so much as someone having a shitty hdd

But it can’t be their first time, Ash mains have always been jager mains

If you say so.

I'm fine with feedback and constructive criticism. Next time I'll use less saturated colors and make the textures myself. I used the auto texture tool and it didn't work as well as I had hoped but, it was better than I could do myself. 
---
I want that :(
---
Wow.  
---
I'd have been furious especially considering Pulse is a character I will never use and his invitational skin is one of the weaker ones.
---
nice!
---
You can make it happen on purpose, people have done it to get forfeit wins by making everyone else on the other team leave.
---
ALL HAIL LORD TACHANKA
---
Under situations, right below Heavily Fortified. Gotta do all situations to do it
---
It cant be that as they have the ability to leave the game. It's been an hour and they haven't left. How is the one guy on their team that's loading and hasn't responded at all to our messages? 
---
One fucking hour. 
---
*Ayos, kabayan! Ganda!* This is a great thing to do.
---
I’ve done all the situations... do you have to 3 star all of them??
---
It does. If they got their parent or guardian to give them money to buy/bought that shit they can ask for a cheap headset and mic. Or save their allowance or whatever. 
---
Except my aim is so trash I would lose the fight regardless.
---
If they were going to use a F2P business model, then why didn't they just make the fucking game F2P? I'd have still bought all the characters anyway. There are so many editions of R6S that I can't even remember if $60 gets you every operator or not.
---
I'm not mad about the pulse uniform I love it and it's something I wanted (I love pulse) but the three charms is what I hate all I wanted was the pulse uniform and the universal skin 
---
How about no acogs on automatics 
---
Wow. I've never seen someone lag as bad as that Jager did.
---
THE LORD SAID NO ACOGS FOR YOU!!!
---
Report the players or something 
---
lol... yeah... last night I quit the game and logged back in to see if it would give it to me.  Nope... but today it is showing as complete.  Odd!
---
We have lol. About nearly 100 times. 
---
You spent 1 h and 45 minutes doing this...
---
Yea but like there are so many better skins and headgears and stuff lol and the first gold in 40 alpha packs it’s this lol
---
Shield bae❤
---
No wonder.

Uplay updates slow, if you restarted your game thru would probably register

Did you also cut off 2 fingers in order to perfect the cosplay? /s

Finally wont be with 4 Chinese speaking people in ranked even though im in New Zealand

You could honestly email Ubisoft and ask for their permission to do so. They probably email you back

well i just played another right after, won and gained MMR

what do you mean?

Agreed

Actually, this is something that Epi mentioned on the Hot Breach Podcast. Apparently they are working on it.

You mean to tell me, your playing ranked and somebody is cav?

I love Monty and he's useless now

Never too late, now is as good a time as ever!

Recommend you do a few rounds of Terrorist Hunt to get a feel of things. And try to stick with a few operators as your mains, but feel free trying all of them. 
---
As a defender, you may want to camp a lot when unfamiliar with the maps. You’ll gain the confidence to roam outside the objective later on.

They most definitely are copyrighted since they are at minimum part of Ubisoft's marketing portfolio, however its unlikely Ubisoft will sue the school unless your paint makes a lot of money for them, and even then, the backlash would be worse than the money they could win from a lawsuit. For any piece of artwork, it takes decades for it to become public domain and available to everyone, so its not that simple of a work you have, you probably should inquire for more details about why you cant use copyrighted material and if there is some leeway.
---
Cosplay is on point, very nice
---
Six is the leader
---
Shouldn't be a problem, unless you're unable to separate fictional content from outlooks applicable to reality.
---
Then you've got bigger problems on your hands.
---
So you can't mix for example an individual piece of headgear with an elite outfit? That's really fuckin lame
---
Well, at the current op state of lion this is still unfair for the defenders

There's another bug in bedroom where you can glitch under the table by prone spamming the bed.

Awesome! Definitely convinced that it'll be working worth the frustration that comes with being new to the game. Everyone has made it seem super rewarding.

Alright, I guess I should stop admiring Spider-Man and what his entire persona is suppose to symbolize.

No like your whole rig bricks as soon as a match is found.

**E-SPORTS READY, BEST PATCH TO EVER COME**
---
but why? it makes no sense. it’s the only reason i’m so far down in ranks. so stupid
---
From the basic ops that are cheap and easy to play, also based on you saying no shooter experience, i suggest maining kapkan/rook on defense and thatcher/thermite on attack. With thatcher thermite work with your team to learn the things to blow up

In a few days
---
i cant think of a single reason why it would be wrong to be inspired by a fictional character. get this negative nonsense out of here
---
What an arse op is. Sorry he stole your stuff, man. :(
---
Try the reflex or holo on the g6 with the flash hider
---
You should prob specify platform for the tips part and your main should be whoever you want for how you like to play, also you dont need to main someone
---
OP, you're an arse. 
---
I would've agreed with you if the title was about how broken the game is, (for that glitch when you got hit by the airjab), but this is just ranting. Not to mention it's just casual.
---
Activating windows will help :)

Nah but seriously this is just ubisofts mess up, im from new Zealand and instead of being NZ and Australia servers i was getting into games with chinese guys, pretty sure this was patched in todays scheduled update

My school has gigabyte per second downloads that are faster than the speed in my friends dad's IT office

I’m flagging for not being accurate cause bandit doesn’t have an acog

Edited to include my platform, also thank you for your suggestion!!

Yes. Season pass gets it one week early.

Yes you must get the season 4pass

Season pass 
---
all good bro. we normally play on fridays and saturday’s pretty much all day so i’ll see if you’re online then
---
Nice one
---
You can get them tomorrow with renown. But the season pass holders get to play them a week early.

Wow I just encountered 3 posts about this issue. They really fucked up this time.
---
In Tom Clancy's books six countries created a CT team called rainbow because of their diversity
---
Is this pc only? 
---
Oh yeaa
---
I miss Bandit's ACOG. More than Jager's by far.
---
exactly, it's casual, he's getting tryharded by a fivestack. That fucking sucks.
---
What is the funny part about this post? serious question.
---
Look at the time for the round. I planted it at the last second 
---
Yeah, mine stopped at one when I know I got at least 6. At least it's not that cool of a skin.
---
Digital achievements are coded in. If they mean something to you then you should look up to m

Master chief or fuck i don’t know Kratos? If we’re going to argue and be real stupid about it, then look at what those people achieved.

Same, might be a bug if you think you finished it, it might just pop up anytime or when new objectives pop up tomorrow
---
why would they issue MP7's in the US?
---
I'm sooo cosplaying as nomad someday!
---
You’re still probably right though 
---
Well too bad. Do you expect me to revive Vine from the dead and make a 6 second clip?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
I GOT x-kaiROOOOOOOS
---
What they should've done is just make leaning rotate the angle of recoil, since, you know, that's what would actually happen if you tilted the gun to the side like that.
---
What were you defending for? There were no attackers. Even if there were attackers and you lost, who care have infinity rounds.

Give him the M870 he can carry around like his pistol. Ez

But are you missing fingers?

Even better

I'm willing to accept this.

Lower ranks use him a lot because it’s less organized play
---
Told u 
---
He has a pistol with arguably the best looking acog in the game, he has a DMR on defense, and he can electrify hatches. Maestro can cover them, but maestro has a lot more counters than kaid in that scenario. Also they have a goal of 100 ops, there’s going to be a fair amount of overlap. 
---
I'm in your debt
---
I love contributing to this problem in the SCUS servers
---
Well damn okay :( I'm decent I promise. I dragged myself put of a miserable rank and was proud. These are ops that were recommended so I've learned to play them properly. I ain't trash but I aint cocky. Being cocky gets me back in copper. 
---
I only completed a couple of Situations after I started playing Siege. They're really quite pointless as you will learn much more quickly once you are in game - as in which button does what - which doesn't work in Situations or Terrorist Hunt since the AI enemies do not react to your gadgets.
---
For what to do in the game, watch Youtube videos of gameplay so you know why you are getting teamkilled and vote kicked out the moment you reinforce the kids' bedroom in the House map.

I remember that, but I can’t shake it that the physics seem off

only if i could get black ice :,(

This makes me happy
---
No actually that would be a bad idea I can’t stand when I’m playing overwatch in ranked and I finally get in a get and then someone leaves and I have to find a new game
---
This is amazing lol!!
---
What?
---
It is the best acog, but that doesn’t mean it’s better than just using the AUG. Especially when considering it’s low capacity, low damage (for a DMR), and high recoil.
---
You want it fixed, post it on r6fix and send it to Support. Ubi doesn't look at this sub as closely as it's players do unless it's AMA. R6fix and support are the only sure shot ways to fix it.
---
You'll only ensure more and more people becoming aware of this and exploiting it. That's the last thing you want.
---
It does 84 damage. That’s high as fuck. 
---
Haha Clever :) new hibana model looks great ! :D:D:
---
__Look at mr fancypants and his not 50 kb/s__

she looks the cutest in this headgear change my mind

Stop posting these.

Hibanna And Twitch and I'm pretty sure Rook
---
So it's been 3 days, still not fixed
---
I guess it’s not on high priority since it’s in casual.

You can upgrade for $10, however you have to be straight to do so.

No.

Meh it doesn’t really matter, it’s not the damage that makes his ability good.

Yes sir but she still has it rather than jager who is forever lost

Did you play during free weekends?

If you haven't already, try completely logging out of uplay and logging back in.

Then under the play button, click properties and verify game files.

If that doesnt fix it, time for ubisoft support ticket.

thank you, I modified some parts for trekking purposes but tried to be as accurate as possible. thank god nomad's gear is mostly trek-ready :D

That's terrible reasoning. There's plenty of ways to fix your issue too. Do it like Dota and punish the party members too, or make it unsustainable (bans for repeat offenders).

Nomad?
---
She is not being negatively effected by following in the characters footsteps regardless of the fact the character isn’t real. In fact her following those steps led to her climbing a mountain which regardless of motivations is impressive. You have not climbed a mountain. She has. Don’t give her advice. 
---
Yes! I absolutely love this cosplay but if I could give a bit of uncalled for advice, if you're shooting toward the sun you could also block the sun out with your body for a great silhouetted effect!!
---
Downvote me
---
Nomad also has a sexy ass voice but you only ever hear it in terrorist hunt 
---
If you listen to the placement of the thermite charge you can tick it. Only if the charge is activated, kaid is limited to stopping hibana.

Zofia has some sort of AK varient not sure if it's the beryll and Nomad has an AK Varient which is the AK74, I doubt next season with Year 4: Season 2 will bring the AK47.

Why not?

You're the reason why we need to wait 15 minutes for match to start, with those potato PC's LOL. =P

Nah but honestly, I play high ranks and when you get to a high rank u never really do anywhere below the low gold ranks. I stay roughly gold 2 at every start of the season. And make my way up to plat 2 and grind to 1, so basically I never go lower. So maybe they should just lock lower ranks for Last season diamonds. Or stuff like that. But then again smurfs and shet

In Dota, a game doesn't count if someone leaves in the first 5 minutes and before the first kill. If either of those have happened, the game counts.

also yeah sorry about that haha, and it was the best(and safest) among all parts of the summit. it's where the people wait for the sun to rise above the clouds (also where nomad watched the sun rise too)
---
I was scared at first to go to that area during sunrise(slight acrophobia lol), that when i mustered enough courage to pose there, the sun was already high up lol
---
my friend tried to lessen the glare but was about all we could do with my phone camera haha :D
---
And by multiple i mean more than 2 clips in 1 video... i've done that before and quite recently i decided to try my hand at 5 clips mashed into 1...
---
No 256k/bps is slow you privledged bratty child

Honestly it wouldn't be that hard for him to just push it with his foot out of the corner.

It feels like a lot of players are cracking the shits and leaving after 2 lost rounds. This isn't your typical modern AAA game that feeds you success just for participating and I think some people are struggling with that. It's a rough game if your a pussy or a tantrum thrower. If it's 1v5 I'm still giving it a go. I'm playing the game to play the game after all. Alternatively it could be a lot of dc's too.
---
We need to stay vigilant, we could be next
---
ah prepping for the trail we went through, in terms of buying stuff and packing, maybe just around a few days (I've been into hiking and climbing for a while so I already have majority of the gear)
---
but preparing for it physically, I'm a fairly fit person (regular cardio and into Mixed martial arts), so i just added a little more cardio in my 2 weeks before the climb :)
---
Idk but who else can counter him

If you're on mobile version, click in the 3 little points in the right upper corner and click in the "change user flare" button, then choose what you want

Too soon?

Her gun is fine.

thank you! I sure am thankful majority of Nomad's default gear is suited for climbing.  
---
except the combat boots. don't use combat boots for climbing HAHA
---
Ash lost her ACOG too?

Tachanka is too op he doesn't need ACOG

Well ya I hear what you’re saying and I play to the end of the game I just think you shouldn’t start a competitive match if you’re gonna leave go to casual and do that
---
It can’t be stressed enough, map knowledge is the single most important skill in this game.
---
wanted to go Akiki tbh (coz it's where nomad went to), But I was with friends so we went Ambangeg trail. It still was challenging tbh &lt;3
---
we reached the summit and it was still dark, saw the entirety of the sunrise and yes it sure was awesome. we didnt see the sea of clouds but it still was awesome!
---
were planning to go back again just so we could see the sea of clouds :D

Sounds like a Squeaker needing a carry.

What about hacker ?i met hacker in my opposite team he was using hacks blatently with 16 KD last season and no ban on his ID and i lost my placement match

16 KD last season still no ban help plz ban him

I’ve had this problem for the last week on pc but a update came today and fixed it so it should be fixed real soon on console

Fuckin hell, one of my colleagues gave up the secret of how we spread it

why’d you post it twice?

Ur first mistake was playing on console

Ur second was letting your abusive relationship continue with this game and tell your self you love it

TOSIC!!! Bannable!!

Im guessing you meant party room

This is where you stop.

That’s the point.

i agree with ash
---
As a ash main I can confirm this
---
Now this is cosplay. Dedication deserves an upvote
---
👌
---
True. Itd might be hard to implement in multiplayer, but if they had featured operators every other week that were free to play thatd be great. Sorry I got kinda off topic. Great idea. Though having 100 ops is far ahead of us I'm afraid. With 46 ops now and 8 a year, by the end if this year we'll have 52, if they stick to quarterly seasons. We should hit a hundred at year ten season four or year eleven season 1. Geez that's far.

\*insert crying Smoke\*

Keep it up! Looks amazing :) What operator next? ;)
---
My ritual on hereford with finka is starting at spitfire courtyard and shoot the cam outside only to reload for that one bullet.
---
what the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land
---
the same exact thing happened to me last week with the same fucking skin... i’ve gotten than fucker at least 10 times 
---
I bought Hibana but can't work with that 20 bullet mag. I can't aim so 20 is not enough for me. 
---
it still looks like shit...
---
1000 IQ
---
An operator only to counter another operator? Seems like a waste, doesn‘t it?
---
But it still looks like shit... They didnt fix it. 
---
4 years in and kids in this sub still can’t fucking spell the word caveira
---
Idk that still kind of helps
---
I don’t see a huge problem with her acog being removed. Can’t rely on one sight. I never even used it for ash. It wasn’t necessary. 
---
What's your sensitivity? It's impressive that people can play with high sensitivity
---
Burnt horizon has ruined this game
---
Cause its not as effective as modern day AKs

What is the other source? I would otherwise say 100% trust what the developers say.

It's not as easy if you play on console. They were probably in a party which is more comfortable and unfortunately, you can't communicate with the ingame chat and party chat at the same time.

And drone holes too but even then it still sounds somewhat redundant

What about her face though? That shit is pretty too

You know what a sniper and artist have in common? Details. Like when the bullet does not mach the target. Artist dont need to deal with that. So no, we have nothing in common.

This. Just copy Killa's gear and name the skin "Opachki" and I'll buy it faster than Ash mains can say ACOG. MVP animation is throwing 8 RGDs with one hand over House.

About 0,5 Rooks
---
At least the operator icon is right side up this time.

the color is based on the color from the operator, e.g. yellow for blackbeard and jager

I have the black ice on Bandit too! Great cosplay

You get comms bans if they report you for abusive or offensive talk or messages like spam, insults and such. Reporting people who isult you is a good way to annoy them bc the'yll get a 2 day comms ban eventually

That was QuiteBenevolent of you.

30fps is fine but it felt like it was randomly dropping to like 10

Ikr? I have like 2000 hrs on the Game so much of my life wastes waiting for marches. Playing t hints disconnections, fight among friends, saw the real faces of some of the friends broke up with some of the friends, stopped playing the game altogether.

Didnt csgo used to have like a multi day ban for leaving a comp game or being afk?
---
[Ubisoft loved that.]
---
Thanks for pointing this out to me.
---
Didn't happen that way for me. The way I noticed it, it was stuck there at 0/20 after I added the challenge in order to complete it and I then played a few casual games but it never updated for several days. Up until recently I got back on the game and it did update but was stuck there at 16/20 since then. 
---
Did it actually get removed?
---
I see what ur saying, I don't even know uni had no control over people using it, if we report people for using mouse and keyboard do they get banned? 
---
Are they diamonds ? XDD I think, this capitao didn't recognise cav killing jackal xD Maverick and Twitch w t h doing xD

My point is, he doesn't do anything, other ops don't do better.. He has nothing going for him

Bad guns, bad gadget

Even more annoying when they do it in ranked.

It is an ancient tribal dance originating from 699 BC, it was believed that performing the dance around the nitro cell would summon Tachanka, the god of war who would then crouch+lean spam their opponents into surrendering.

Like why is he doing that! Fuked up Ash
---
Oh damn. If it was on Xbox One, I could had helped u out, since I'm recognisable as the biggest Kapkan main with over 2000 trap kills + 500+ hours (with clutches, sometimes), but still Plat since Red Crow because of the terrible matchmaking :( I have some pretty nice trap skills by replacing them from [one kill to another at one door](https://youtu.be/wg3jZvoL_M0?t=267) before/after he got nerfed/buffed.

LOL i love it!!! Ohhh they fun Y1S1
---
I killed her in this I'm pretty sure
---
Before this issue they all had the same recoil. It was this gun which was buffed differently for the first time in the history of the game.
---
This is probably one of the most beautiful examples of non verbal communication I've ever seen.
---
someone said ubi is gonna consider it 
---
The game should atleast backlit to the operator pick screen an wait for a new player to join
---
Tachanka's shield is already strong (500hp), it's main problem is that it's destructible in the first place; this means it will just get destroyed with prefire **unless** you put it in very specific positions where your enemy cannot effectively prefire it.
---
Tachanka's turret has so many counters it doesn't need to also get countered by shooting your gun at it.
---
imo he could acually use a deployable shield as his mount as well as this, bc even then countering him would be a relatively simple affair.
---
here's a list of Tachanka's counters:
---
1. flanking/destructible surfaces. (available to all operators) 
---
2. smoke grenades. 
---
3. all blinding gadgets to a degree, stuns being the most effective. 
---
4. Frags.
---
5. Fuze.
---
6. Monty.
---
7. Ash.
---
8. Zofia.
---
9. Capitaõ.
---
10. Having a different way into the Obj. (Thermite and Hibana fall into this category)
---
For the exception of just a few guns, I run the flash hider on auto rifles. The first shot on the F2 has some vertical recoil which some will counter with the muzzle break, then after that there is some random horizontal recoil that can be countered with the comp. Both of those options are fine and you need to do what feels best for you at the end of the day. Personally I like the flash hider because its mitigates short burst recoil and helps with the flash when firing so I can stay on target. On PC it won't make a huge difference either way because after you develop the muscle memory you can be effective with any of the attachments. Hope this helped.   
---
Yes from the shop in the section for weapon and select frost 's shotgun 
---
I was 1 game away from plat then i had to go sleep and the update released rip
---
Oh so you've seen the picture too?
---
To prevent attackers from getting a visual on the entire laundry room ?
---
3rd: How about give the turret a quick overheat and hard to control recoil and can also be destroyed by enough bullet damage since its able to do a shit load of damage. 2: agreed 1: I forgot to add that the shield will be smaller and is possible to headshot chanka but will still have 500 hp
---
Take my upvote
---
I get around 130-170 ping just because of my shitty internet. I live in Asia however connecting to Asia servers give be 250 ping when Europe gives only 130 or so, allowing me to play. I feel this can be somewhat forgiven though I get accused of ping abusing in ranked. However the people who switch servers to ping abuse on purpose, that’s an oof.

---
&gt; But on the other hand, the duration of the smoke is less and less thick as well, Ergo, worse.
---
Yes, there are circumstances in which standard smoke grenades are better, which is exactly what my post says.  Standard smoke grenades and Capitao's smoke bolt have different situations in which they are preferable to the other.
---
&gt;So far nobody has been able to convince me that capitao is objectively a plus to a team.
---
You're completely rejecting any notion that situations exist when Capitao's utility will be more useful than options provided by other attackers.  When we're trying to get a plant off in laundry room of Oregon with the hatch open and we may not have burned all the ADS charges, Capitao's smoke bolt is likely a better option for our team than standard smoke grenades. Throw in the fact that he can also deny rotation from two locations as well.
---
Again, I'm not trying to tell you he's an absolutely required operator every round you play and you're hurting your team's chances to win if you don't bring him. But I also think you are greatly discounting everything he can provide in many circumstances.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong, I love cap. His design is great and I love the idea behind his gadget but he is just too situational to be effective and his guns are not gold enough to balance it out
---
I don't know what "too situational to be effective" is even supposed to mean. There is no shortage of situational operators who are desirable in enough situations that they make a significant mark on the game, even if they aren't staples round in round out.  No other singular operator brings smoke grenades that are immune to Jager ADS systems that are completely targetable as well as area denial.  Yes, standard smoke grenades are typically good enough and in some cases even preferable to Capitao's smoke bolts and there are other operators who can deny access to an area in various ways, though almost all of those methods require advanced setup and/or being in close range.
---
Thank you so much! Nomad Inspired me with her "keep moving forward" attitude that I just had to make a tribute to her in this climb &lt;3

yes, but operators get slowler cheaper. for example, the new operators of this season will cost 5000 renown less in a year.

How did a school computer actually run rainbow spec? 1080ti computer lab??

It’s still in the work, but the community immediately pointed out how it could be used to troll/ be toxic, when that system was trying to prevent that...

This made me remember that time where i once threw a C4 at my teammate to down and then revive him but accidentally detonated it when tried to pick it up. Both of us died.

I cried. Then left the game and closed my PS4 out of embarrassment, layed on my bed and asked myself "why am i this stupid".

What’s a glaymore?

---
I know you want a solid answer so I'll say year one if you want the most bang for your buck. Buck blackbeard valkyrie echo and hibana are always part of the meta. Caviera, capitao and frost are all fun to play. As a bonus, they have been out longer than the other dlc ops so they will have more cosmetics for unlock or purchase. 
---
If you dont like those for any particular reason then I'd say year two. Mira lesion and dokkebi are all game changing with a solid kit while the rest are damn good too. Zofia has a good versatile kit and vigil is a good aggressive roamer for experienced players (his gadget is only useful if the enemy team attempts to drone you). And ying can be really situational but man is it fun to flash a whole team and d*ck on their faces with that 60ish bullet lmg she has. 
---
Summary: meta/tryhard, pick year one. 
---
Wanna have fun with some decently well kitted operators, year two. 
---
This is really just my opinion but I've been watching this game grow since year one season two so I might be biased to older operators. I encourage you to look them up individually and on YouTube before you spend your hard earned cash, but, I'm sure a smart dude like you already has.
---
I see a lot of people say shadow play but if you have an amd card i would recommend the built in windows game dvr if you don’t want to spend money. The amd recording software doesn’t work with siege and has been hot garbage in my experience

although a silver is a silver no matter what platform the nice thing is on pc you can at least type to your team for callouts if no one is talking but the R6 discord is helpful for finding teams at least, I play both on on xbox and pc and yeah low elo is a different game down there.
---
hm fair enough
---
Why do I get the feeling you aren't so innocent?
---
Not really. People have left the game for others hacking and whatnot.
---
Omg my god. I’d like to thank my fellow redditors.
---
You have a CD-Key, or anything that could prove your purchase? 
---
As Trainy says, contact the support by Twitter or the Ubi website.
---
What level are you? And are you doing casual or ranked?
---
Because in my time playing I've never been voted kicked or seen someone get vote kicked for being low level or talking in voice chat unless they were being obnoxious.
---
Idk if it's the beginning of the season jitters or what but the toxicity and short tempered children seems like it's at an all time high right now! I mean i drop like 7-15 kills every game since my rank is silver so I'm definitely padding my kd but it's not worth it! I like winning
---
I don’t see how it would hurt if it got Acog. All his other guns do. The shotgun does the same damage as Glaz’s gun 
---
Is it true that the wheel was first lost to the ages, until they found the original design attached to the bottom of Tachanka's turret???

We dont know when that update is coming out but it will probably be during mid-season reinforcements. Which is usally a month after the the season has been released. Also you should've let him TK you to get him banned.

Gridlock is actually a Chonk, anybody who says something like I’ve seen big/fat people do athletic things don’t know how unpractical it is to be that big as a soldier. She weighs 103kg alone and still has to carry 2 guns, ammo, traps, armour and her various tools. That’s probably like 135kg she has to carry while running around lean spamming noobs. It’s just unreal to think that with that much activity she is that big

Yeah, no, i tried to be friendly but they just went tryhard mode

That guy didn't bypass the filter that way. I think I got proof, but left it because my recording software wasn't working right.
---
Yea
---
That i don't get... Still happens 
---
Heres the thing her gun is still one of the best. Hell to be honest the red dot is better for that gun as shes supposed to be up close and perdonal not at a distance. Personally though. But even with this it doesnt fix that the G36C is still worse in ever way asides ads time and recoil but thats only slightly. Her R4-C is still as powerful as it was and a scope isnt a nerf when it doesnt change stats. And for me acogs are not my first choice for a scope ever.
---
Best month

A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME 
---
lol good to here  about the PC though...I'm going to start watching YouTube videos to refresh my mind on how to build a PC. It's been a while since I've had one
---
Yeah I get the occasional arsehole who teamkills for no apparent reason but nine times out of 10 if I experience any form of toxicity it's leavers and throwers.
---
The best way to use the prismas is to just put them in places where attackers prefire (behind barricades, behind punch holes etc) 
---
Attention. I will send proof on YouTube to prove my point. I feel like you don't see it the way I do. 
---
Not from a Russian
---
ok its voice my bad. But if you dont record it then nothing will be done. Ubisoft does not record voice communication in game.

While I agree to some point, just shut up and enjoy the fucking game.  Bitching about a character model is like bitching about a charm clipping through the side of the gun.  Not trying to be an asshole, but just putting in my 2 cents.
---
Wow man that sucks. Hope your little bro is okay
---
defense should be that offense should be the same but breach charge. or anything to do with the m870 even if it's not equipped.
---
These are some of the most heart racing but satisfying scenarios in Siege
---
You qualify as a siege veteran if you remember siege looking like this.

Already watching it's pretty nice but I wish there would be more map related stuff tbh
---
It's both.
---
I'm pretty sure it's just a glitch. Unless that was apart the patch from yesterday or purposely intended.
---
Have you tried using your GPU's background recording? These days it takes almost no resources.
---
I heard people running outside but didn’t know he was standing there specifically. I just wagered that someone was standing at the window since people really like to do that on skyscraper. Still getting use to the MP5SD’s recoil pattern so I only shot a round.
---
I like the 2d trucks driving along, always facing you like a creepy painting with eyes 
---
They have the under level 50 queue for a reason you know
---
It's just a nice refresh
---
Report them directly to MS.

Thanks 🙂

My senior year of high school in PC support class, the teacher already had CS installed on all of the PCs and after everyone was done with mid-terms/finals, we all played as a class.  
---
Same problem with people cutting line fire.
---
They think you're deliberately shooting them so they TK you...
---
I look forward to the next MaJ which should fix this issue.
---
Oof google translate failed me
---
I mean cmon. Just because she's a woman means you have different standards.... Wait we dont😂😂
---
Oh ok
---
I use lightshot for screenshots and ofcourse shadowplay for recording but lightshot works no matter what. Its easy to use and i'd recommend it because you can use it instantaneously 
---
You don’t get hit with an sr penalty. Everyone gets backed out of the lobby
---
I’m thinking it over, and now I think another good idea for the animation would be recruit holding up the C4 phone in one hand and pressing the detonate button, making the whole map explode cinematically. That would probably be way too much for a simple MVP animation though :/

Mine was stuck at 10/20 last night And i was afraid I wouldn't get it but I woke up today with a notification that I earned it so idk 
---
Because I'm not toxic. I don't vote to kick people because of their level. I do it when someone TKs when it isn't an accident. I don't vote to kick because one of my teammates is under 15. I don't do it when someone even speaks a single word. I keep my thoughts to myself and don't always use voice chat. I only use it for callous and for when something cool happens, I react positively and say something like "nice" or "nice try."
---
He only exists now, in my dreams 
---
Jager's gun and charm issues tho lmao
---
You should use r6tab imo it’s better 
---
So no thermite? His bday is this week and I never got his dog tag.
---
Thatcher is a necessity in the case of a good bandit tricker. A good bandit can completely deny your ability to enter a garage site.
---
I think it's just because she's a 3 armor tho, people aren't used to fighting 3 armors on offense. I don't think she needs a nerf
---
That invisible glitch bullshit.  I hit plat 1 early in the season and that shit happened
---
i remember when i had to use my microwave to record something 
---
I have no idea, but I bought the season pass and got all the benefits except for the operators. The thing I bought it for was not given to me, please refund me Ubi or give me my ops
---
I'm confused
---
I mean..most ash mains didn’t even run an acog to begin with.   I didn’t see it as a nerf but I don’t really mind going against her personally.   
---
I agree with that, weird stuff. Could have to do with the rollback stuff somehow.
---
I’ve been saying nothing changes with ash removing the acog. That’s why people gotta stop acting like removing acogs is actually a nerf.
---
They are different colors for different ctus 
---
Level 10 on PC, maybe. Definitely level 99 on Xbox.

I’m doing this with my friends and one of us always gets banned for teamkill

Depends on if he agreed to it. Who are you to decide whether someone should play with a knife

Yeet

Too much to ask from Ubisoft. :/

you should add ash to that also
---
been reposted a thousand times 
---
Yep
---
The hero we didn't deserve
---
If you’re an ash main, you’re aggressive and push fast and hard and take map control quickly so you’re running holo.  
---
Yes
---
Yes, you will get all Y4 operators, you just won't get the lava camo that came with purchasing it before the new seasons release.
---
Yea you definitely must be doing something to make people Vote kick you because vote kicking in casual is pretty rare unless you do get asshole lobbies or you do something really stupud like, as I can probably guess, trying to tell at people for using the "N-word".
---
But did you commit to the cosplay and cut off 2 of your fingers?
---
Ultimate bro
---
I always use OBS and can screenshot while playing the video. I was just lazy and forgot to test my settings thinking I got it all right. I fixed it last night, so everything works the way it should.
---
Could just be a game bug. If your desperate, I would reinstall windows
---
Oh my God, this is the most romantic thing I have ever seen!
---
Nie ma problemu
---
I remember when I had to use my toaster to record something 
---
I was more thinking of some sort of list that lists off all possible spots, don't worry I'll just go about trial and error 😁
---
I mean you've still got a thick steel plate inside said Kevlar 
---
lightshot is easier though i just print screen then select the area i want to use. so easy 
---
Majority of Ash players did use ACOG on the R4C
---
Wholesome recruit 
---
From my experience (For reference, I usually sit around Gold 1 on PC, although I've never hit platinum) playing in silver lobbies on PC isn't all that bad... Realistically, there's not really any strategies getting played out, and there's very little in the way of callouts and effective teamplay, but there is far less toxicity in comparison to Bronze and Copper.... Silver on PC is the rank pool where you'll find people who aren't exactly \*good\* but they are starting to understand a little bit, if that makes sense?
---
I mean only the recoil. If the marskman rifle hadn’t such an unpredictable recoil it would be one of my favorites
---
I've checked and even met the same hackers. One of the hackers actually remembers me all the time and keeps bringing up the fact that he's still not banned.
---
And these aren't suspicious wallhacky types. I'm talking about hipfire across the map types of hackers 
---
Riveting footage. I couldn't take my eyes off it.
---
I mean “gook!” Is a achievement now so Gook!
---
Ya i think casual should be for messing around. Ranked for actually playing.
---
I mean there are some pretty interesting ways you can get ips on console but yeah for the most part the only way they can pull your ip is if you join their party 
---
Does he come with 3 sets of skins?
---
{-}7
---
You are clearly shooting the rock
---
Say goodbye to the subreddit mate.
---
Totally agree. His weapon is so satisfying (that reload animation), his PEST launcher is an incredible addition that is quite balanced, and his secondary's utility is great. Everything about him is so balanced and so fun to play.
---
Oh look, literally the same skin as Jager, with a just an operator icon change...
---
Fuck Ubi, we know you're lazy but come on...

When you change the data server in the .ini files, try making the file "Read Only" before you launch siege
---
Yeah I know my aim will be s*** for a while because I haven't played PC since Battlefield 2142 (the best battlefield) but it seems worth it for the community alone.

Her gun has not changed in any stat. Still a very good fire rate, very managable recoil, good mag size, good damage. The guns fine a scope doesnt mean anything in stats. A op like her shouldn't have that kind of range with as good of a gun she has now.
---
“Data limits”
---
Yeah, that’s why I run with a 5-stack when I can. Loosing due to that is something you shouldn’t have to deal with. Removing the 5 stack would be the death of any sense of coordination in R6.
---
$2,000,002...if you can tell me what that is in £.
---
For $26 bucks the gold is definitely worth it 
---
Don't buy the cheapest. I bought the one that was just slightly more expensive than the cheapest and it gave me 12 operators to play. I got to learn the game with those and slowly bought different operators as I gained money and skill. To me slowly unlocking the operators was super rewarding
---
JuSt UsE tHe G36 /s
---
We can never have enough hard breach mains! Stick with it. 
---
Yeah lol 
---
Happened last week too
---
just the operators, from my team and the enemy team
---
I do consistently good most games on Pc but not on console 
---
You should be using the Scar anyways. It’s the much better choice for most of not all situations. 
---
Doesn't work xdd
---
Game is fantastic... honestly I would get the gold. You will have a bunch of operators unlocked. If you actually enjoy the game, you will end up wanting them for sure. You can earn operations by generating renown, which is an in game currency from playing games. It just takes a while without higher editions. For $26, well worth it man!
---
This looks fucking retarded
---
**PRAISE THE LORD**
---
$2,00,003 (£1, 529, 502.29) 
---
Thx 
---
The only way to would be mod the games config files and that seems like a quick way to get BattleEye’s attention.
---
starter doesn't exists anymore, so there is no wrong answer
---
*whips out nitro cell*
---
Man I have to say I love the new outlines. It makes letters and words really pop out. 
---
Mozzie I think is a pretty good choice 
---
thats how the japanese would shoot their bamboo bows my duse
---
But running out of ammo.
---
I wish there were still people like that in r6 PS4 but I can’t even join a game anymore if I join an ongoing match I get kicked before I even get to play. Why????
---
Play other stuff. 
---
I highly recommend Insurgency: Sandstorm. Similar TTK to R6 but a bit more heavy feeling And with respawns.  
---
R6 is fucking tough. Not only It is very tough to be consistent unless you play 8 hours a fucking day, but all the skill shaming is really annoying as well. 
---
I play to have a good time, not to be Beaulo. But unless I put 3 hours a day in, I’m not gonna have  enough skill to even have fun 😂
---
Nice
---
👍🏽
---
Well it's a legendary and can only get it through alpha packs so it's is quite rare.
---
If you’re on ps4 let me know, i love thunt on house and it eara you approx  100 renown for 2 minutes
---
This right here is the absolute best answer you can get.
---
sorry brother, the other pistol
---
Rare when it first came out 2 years ago.
---
The Aug is a headshot machine though, virtually no recoil even without a vert grip. I would love it if it got an ACOG to make it even more deadly
---
Interesting 
---
The hero we need but don’t deserve
---
My bid is $2,00,004
---
Yep, was counting fine now it isnt, still at 8/10 despite getting jägers ads
---
Ah Mr. Homeless! Pleased to meet you.
---
I also agree
---
ima be real with you.... I want the charms back 
---
This would be a brilliant idea for the main game

noice

I would read that

i would consider reading that.

Still it reduce gameplay variety and it's only a top of iceberg.

Oi yee wee daft bastards! Good charm bud
---
Looks like there are also two vol 3 for some reason.
---
&gt; Either those guys need to learn to play Ranked or bring another friend in their party. 
---
First off just because they played the game for a while means they should be put into ranked. 
---
Second the matchmaking put you in the game with them, they didn’t choose to go against a new player.
---
And third, report, block, mute and move on. BattleEye and the Toxicity system will do their thing.
---
My Jager has an elite skin now!? Guess it's time to start playing again
---
Do the CG painting kuz this loops amaizing 
---
If the score is equal one player is placed at the top of the leaderboard and the other one is showed as the mvp 
---
Id die of alcohol poisoning
---
so 6 sips for starting a game
---
Exactly. I can’t even get back to my rank from last season which is the most frustrating part. 
---
Get an ace with each of them
---
Panzer?
---
No casual is fine for me, however newcomer takes a shit ton to find a match, you’re right about that.

Wow, solid advice. Will consider. Much thanks.

**NO IM NOT CRYING**

That glitch is not as gamebreaking to justify a ban imo

Skyscraper, i think.

There is not something they can do. And please don’t try to say Fortnite did something because they did not 
---
ash main doing her job, as always
---
new players please learn how your op works 
---
2-3 weeks after launch since it’s been that way pretty much every season lol
---
maybe because they want the game to be over so they don't have to sit through this?
---
Should i write SECHSHUNDERTTAUSEND instead of 600.000
---
Its their game, I’m pretty sure if they want dont want people to use mnk they can ban them for it. 
---
My friend also likes to say he’s mnk just for fun, but you can tell he’s joking, and that will change if they start banning people for it. Also there would probably have to be some gameplay proof too. Rn there’s people who everybody knows is mnk, they should be banned.
---
The update came out on Wednesday morning, you and I both have to wait one more day and we should be able to play them :) 
---
Ove seen a draw in wind bastion... I was soo confused
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b0a5yn/-/eidemx0](I have a solution here, hope this works for you) 
---
Pretty stupid idea tbh, their most popular operator and they give it for free. They probs wouldve made millions off her
---
a week after the patch.
---
This is targeted to attackers though. 
---
You mean aim-wise or damage-wise?
---
Cuz if it’s damage-wise, all guns can OHK except for luison

Seen this before. While I don't have a definite fix some pointers are make sure your ping is okay ~ 90 or below make sure you have a decent speed HDD or SSD ( it's okay if you don't have one) and check CPU usage. Otherwise idk why it lags.
---
I thought it would be a rook buff 
---
Probably to hopefully sell the seasonal gear. Luckily this season is actually pretty good.
---
If we petition Ubisoft hard enough, we might be able to get an elite Recruit skin.
---
But there is, I just said, they can ban them. It wont get rid of the ones who hide it, but the ones who show it off will get banned off the game.

I hate those toxic f\*ckers that make this game not fun to play.

Actually fuze is 1 speed

So you dealt with two toxic people. Not just one person being toxic. You shouldn't punish everyone just the assholes who do it.
---
I guarantee that exactly no one changed their minds about Cav viability in PL. It was a cool play and everyone had a great time cheering but it was a cascade of fuck ups on EG’s part that led to that happening.
---
Just because you say it doesn't mean it's true. Ubi can't and Microsoft won't. So deal with it sunshine.

Nice. Diamond is a hard one on console (which is what I play on) because of MnK. What do you play on?

No they cannot.  Epi just addressed it on the hot breach podcast. They cannot.  Banning on console is solely up to Microsoft and Sony.

xbox, mnk isn’t that hard to play against lol, it’s not as big of an advantage as you think

iirc she invented the nanomachines or whatever to help with a pain/condition she has right? So reworking that would mean they would also have to change her backstory. 
---
I think it would be cool if they changed it so you have to be close to finka to get the buff or make it so that its less effective/takes longer to activate based on your distance from her.

I imagine you'd be able to look at a short drone hole or upwards at a low-enough soft ceiling and get a prompt to use the charge. You then stick the cluster charge through the drone hole, or reach upward to mount it on the ceiling.

If you wanted to link them my Twitter (http://twitter.com/mrkingsudo ) as well the video is on there, and I plan on posting more stuff like this in the future. 
---
Same when people say oobe soft its weird to me 
---
That is true, but I believe this to be a fairly lighthearted discussion. A joke, if you will.
---
It seems like the current way Ubisoft is developing new characters is to create characters that counter certain abilities that currently have no good counter.  So the new defender that can see through smoke is good because currently attackers can rush and throw smokes.  So maybe in the future we'll see an attacker that can handle smoke's gas.  
---
I bet in the future we get a character that can see heat signatures.  Maybe a faint glow, ping-based (low refresh) and limited time. While still. and slow animation. 
---
Ping isn't intentional. I live in the middle east at the moment and EU servers which are the closest give me 80-100 ping. My friend in South Carolina has better ping in the EU servers than I do when he's playing with me. 
---
And can give away where you are roaming without actively looking for you. Best to use it when they have to find you. 
---
Hopefully ubi sees this up votes would be appreciated. 
---
I stayed up until like 6:30am playing casual hoping it'd update and then I checked after and it finally let me collect. Then maybe a couple hours later I got the notification on my phone about completing it so if it wasn't for me checking the Club first I would have missed it.

So Rainbow six has copied the P90 from Battlefield 4 because that came out 2 years before
---
Have you tried installing the Year 4 pass? That tends to help.
---
k.
---
OMG that's hurt to watch.
---
Cool story
---
He can’t do that! Shoot him, or something!
---
well it’s an unpopular opinion thread so I’m not going to downvote you, but that’s the nicest thing i have to say lol 
---
It fits so well with the Smaragd skin. My new fav skin/charm combo
---
fair enough
---
Whats wrong with the scan? He would be an extremely underwhelming operator if all he could do was look at cameras while doing other stuff.
---
no, look a little closer
---
Gridlock Therapy 👌🏿

tell me about it

Hello Kxdee, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b0dzf4/issue_with_streaming/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You mean "PP Roni"?
---
It’s not in this game
---
Who? Was it RussianBadger?
---
Thanks I tried hard 
---
Except for siege 
---
Personally mid gold... could probably reach plat if I cut silly mistakes out 
---
What

Not just doc mains, just anyone who's played with ash mains, as she is always some super toxic COD player
---
Spiderpig does whatever a spiderpig does
---
Force choke
---
Tomorrow 
---
...so you play mute normally? only people I see muting doorways and objective routes are silver or lower players 
---
So upset rn I bought lion yesterday
---
You-Bee-Soft
---
Not necessarily, watching cameras is an essential part of the game, but it leaves you incredibly vulnerable. This would allow you to make call outs while still being aware of your surroundings, and would make him immune to dokkaebi due to him not having a phone
---
Some people just like different game modes lol. They are there for a reason.
---
Better yet, Imagine hearing your dad through the wall telling your mom "insertion in 5 seconds."
---
He’ll still be good but just not stupidly broken. I play him frequently and im not worried
---
I really wish more people understood you can do both.
---
This is exactly how i play Vigil. I will go as far away from the obj as possible and use his gadget to avoid detection. Then as it gets later and the attackers have presumably moved in on the obj I will make my way back and usually pick off a couple of them from behind or on a flank.
---
Haha this is funny and relatable 
---
But proud enough to post it to Reddit? Game mode's don't really matter tbh.
---
Dang that would've actually been cool if she pulled the wheel over and started fixing it. Too bad it's a bug.
---
I think you misunderstand the point of Fuze. If you get a kill, it's a hilarious bonus, but Fuze's role is to force movement and flush an area. Of course people run away from the pucks, just as they would a grenade. The issue is you can "cook" q grenade, but if you had that ability with fuze's gadget, it would be considered VERY op. 
---
Fuze has a low pick rate in Pro league because he's a 3 armor, 1 speed, and in the hands of pros, speed wins gun fights. Also, while his ak is decent, and his pmm is a very good secondary, he lacks utility in a wider scope. For instance, why doesn't he have the option to use the Saiga 12, but Finka does? It proves utility as well as fragging potential. He currently has a shield in his 3rd weapon slot, which makes no sense. It's the same shields the recruits use, so not great at stopping bullets, and only slows his tubby ass down more.
---
In short, Fuze has a lot of problems, but his primary gadget isn't it. As far as drawing focus and flushing an area, he may be the best. He would be a strong target for a rework, but I don't think his gadget should be touched. 
---
It's an Aussie saying. 
---
Hahha !  I Recognized some of those machines from my days of being school....
---
Ive had shock rock 3 fuggin times, duplicates need to give you more renown or a small amount of R6
---
Thats absolutely absurd. This is a service that almost always provided for free for most games that can handle cross platform accounts. The fact you are asking to pay for it is beyond me, and then you want it 10-20 per cosmetic? Per weapon camo? Per headgear? Jesus. 
---
Thank u m8

i think it was marly or dils

thank you for telling me for now i can sleep in peace

When we finally figure out the secret behind Hibana mains' lack of intelligence... 
---
It is Skyscraper. If you're like me and don't remember map names, it's "The map that Hibana and Echo came with"
---
You serious?
---
Maybe only one to the whole team should be detected when you move or just one to three so it’s random meaning you can move but with the risk of being detected or not
---
Ubi is a free to ply company they are looking to make profits I’m sure many people would happily pay for there red crow or ash pro league set from year one like me. Die hard fans of siege that have been around for years would leap at this 
---
Yea I usally play vigil or jager. Damm man thank u soo much for the advice,  gridlock it pretty THICC 😂
---
As much as that would be fun, it would make Mozzie the king of runouts.
---
How about swapping defender and attacker OPs? I want Monty in defense.
---
I totally agree with that’s how he’s meant to be played, but like you said it doesn’t bring that much utility at high level. I feel like his guns are all fine, and I actually enjoy shield Fuze due to how powerful the PMM is (also has insane hipfire accuracy). 
---
However, don’t you think it would be worthwhile to change his gadget? Let’s say he had his current guns and was 3 speed, I don’t see him being picked over any other 3 speed op because his gadget is simply not very useful in most situations. I’d say that Ash, IQ, and Capitao all still have better utility that Fuze, even if he was a hypothetical 3 speed. 
---
Therefore, I think that his gadget either needs to be made more deadly or reworked into something more usable 
---
Or when you mark the last enemy so your 2 anchors know what angles to watch with 30 seconds left, only for both to rush the enemy, losing the round/game.
---
When the BM earns instant Karma
---
Probably the hardest carry I've ever seen. Nice job!
---
Zofia makes bandit tricking literally impossible in a lot of places, since her stuns cancels the animation. 
---
Is your VSync turned off? 
---
Wish Cav looked that cute. Her new face looks like a potato with paint on it.
---
Maybe.. One issue is that it might not have enough "levers" or whatever the siege dev called them. I can't remember if that's what they're called but basically they said Lion was a huge problem to balance because his ability is global and not enough little things (levers or whatever) they could alter to change him so basically he would either have to be overpowered or underpowered. For instance, they nerfed Ela's gadget by reducing the blast radius and giving her 3 instead of 4. This sounds like a global ability, which means they'd have a real hard time balancing it.
---
Gold 4-3, not any of the really good ranks though
---
True that

I said goobee soft just because I watch the Russian badger too much

I try. I play Terrorist Hunt yet I step into Casual and fuck up more and more. I'm afraid to solo queue in Ranked anymore because of last season 
---
I got this never use it though
---
Give this guy gold
---
Because it doesn't make money. Thus, Ubi won't do it.
---
Anyways despite having the choice between console or pc siege I'd pay for skins and get stuff on pc first as it's just the more better platform.
---
Understandable if you don't have a gaming pc though.
---
Honestly it feels like the players run the game more often than not. Yes, run. Like the devs just sit back and go "k".
---
Its a glitch with the new map
---
Thank you, my balls have never been sweatier

Is the shop offline?
---
Im trying to spend 10 dollars from my steam wallet but when it tryes to connect to steam it errors and a msg apears saying that the shop in unviable.
---
I have tryed restarting the game, restarting the PC, flushing the dns, port fowarding, copying the ubisoft shop link in the steam overlay ([https://webshop-r6.ubi.com/en/enUS/shop/products/undefined](https://webshop-r6.ubi.com/en/enUS/shop/products/undefined)), changed the proxy settings, checked the Frimware and firewall and flushed the steam configuration.
---
I have spoken with costumer support and I am not banned from performing transactions.

Pls help.

Ubisoft isn't one guy. Their priorities vary per team. They're not gonna tell the artists to just sit back and do nothing while a level designer works on fixing a broken window.
---
Wait, there is another way?
---
My friend reached 100 alpha packs recently and did an opening for our squad over discord. He didn't get any legendaries and the only epic he got was the French fry charm. He was so pissed off that he left his setup for an hour and came back yelling.
---
I love Oregon.

The least fav would be Favela.

TFW you get killed by your Mozzie controlled shock drones.
---
Its not just toxicity really. I'm tired of being put down because of my rank and nobody is willing to work as a team. I get called sweaty or a bot most matches and being the last op is always putting me into a state of panic. When I lose a round, I either get vote kicked or team killed. Every time I play other games I feel relieved and in control. But Seige? I feel like I have to suck it up and be better than others. 
---
Jäger's elite is pretty good imo.
---
I have notice this.
---
People shoot me before I peel before they even see me
---
It's like they moved the hitbox of the head

It is a low hanging fruit joke made by somebody who is obviously fucking terrible at the game.
---
Every season in silver I get people yelling at me that as mute it's my job to "hide the bombs", then by the time I climb back to plat nobody gives a shit about any of it.
---
Wholesome.
---
You're ruining their experience first. Knifing people isn't what rainbow is about, its not what they bought the game to do. Then again your flair is recruit main so you probably think its funny
---
GAMERZ RISE UP!

Buddy your late.

There was an old post back where Vigil got like 200-300 points for spamming his ability the whole prep phase and jumped to mvp lol
---
We should have an Defending OP that can jump up through broken hatches. But be loud as fuck.   
---
CaV would be So OP with that ability 
---
Or when your teammates get greedy to get the last opponent and he pulls off a clutch on your team.

I went to school for 6 years and have my masters in Kinesiology. It's universally accepted by my peers that BMI has some factor in health. While it isn't always accurate, it's always a good place to start. Again, until you've studied it, don't think your sad little Google search will help you
---
Ooh bee soft is what it is "supposed" to be pronounced according to the pun. Ubi (pronounced ooh bee) means where in Latin, making Ubisoft translated to soft where, sounding like software
---
If you jump through the window by the vending machine you can apparently push the terrorist into it
---
Uhhhhh

Unironically saying cringe and bro in 2019.

Now this is epic
---
I think 1 speeds are gonna loose it on attack ,and like you said that's probably an option there looking at
---
But those 2 points are amazing 
---
I use bandit as a bootleg mute. Barbed wire + battery = safe room
---
Primarily on maps like house or skyscraper.

I think the correct phrasing is “That’s what she said”
