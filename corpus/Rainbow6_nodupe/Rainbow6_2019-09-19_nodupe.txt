Yeah basically it would be fun to see what they would do with the gadget to

---
you'd think she's be smart enough to not hold it so close to her face
---
Yeah we can watch the arrow get stuck in ballistic armor
---
You can purchase through steam but you‚Äôll need to link to a uplay account and have to open the client to play
---
I think I'm just gonna stick with borderlands for awhile.
---
Whoops, my bad wrong subreddit, forgot people here can't actually take criticism of their gameplay and anything that goes wrong is the fault of either a hacker, ubi, hit reg, their teammates or is a funny moment, never actually their fault.
---
Also they can‚Äôt punish console players directly like they can PC because it has to go to Microsoft and Sony which they won‚Äôt enforce because they don‚Äôt see DDoSing for a 20 min match not worth the effort.
---
&gt;  up to 10 years in prison
---

---
Thats the key word. Normally those chargers are limited to the people running the botting services. The clients normally just get a small fine and worse case its a community service thing.
---
I've got it through steam, and it's no problem. Just remember your u-play login for the first time you open it
---
Thats the new iphone dude chill
---
Tourettes guy improving gifs since 2004
---
So its more reasonable to just get the game through u-play then
---
Lil update, my pc (gtx 1060 6gb, cant remember the cpu) gets average 150fps on siege so you should totally get 144+
---
Well, there's a lot of robbers, and people hate being robbed I'm sure, and I expect the justice system to treat them the same. No ones being harmed but money is being lost for the company and after all its clearly a crime that would probably land each of these offenders 2 or 3-ish years. There is no reason for someone to not be investigated given video proof, statistics and matching information from a player to a face.
---
The best of friends will vote kick you and leave so you don‚Äôt have to wait for them lmao
---
i understand now.
---
Ingame is an animation for a bolt action sniper tho. like the one when you shoot and are about to shoot again.
---
Sadly no ingame gun model so the leaker Rony used Ashs R4C and Meusoc to test out the animation. Guns only shot once and did the animation before shooting again.
---
So maybe we get next season new weapons again? Or next year?
---
Well not exactly, steam was easier for me to see who of all my friends play it but either way you have to go through uplay
---
Does this take effect on console? I haven't had that many people DDOS me n the boi's, but I have still lost a few ranked matches because of it.
---
Y'all working on my PS4 crashing every 20 minutes? I can't play till its fixed.
---
&gt;They invented TOR lol
---
That is not true. You can read up on the development here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tor_Project
---
Amen
---
Bruh
---
As an IQ main I am triggered
---
That was beautiful. Granted if I was on the other team I'd be pissed. Teammates that bail on you suck!
---
Oh okay. Yeah I was only asking to make sure I didnt make an oopsie and screw myself by getting it on steam. Ty for the quick reply
---
Peak siege was y1s3
---
Also on PS4 ü§ï
---
IP bans dont work, its way too easy to a new IP. 
---
Most countries you just have to restart your router. 
---
Its going to be an account ban.
---
It really just depends on which service you prefer, cheers
---
so basically just Sparrow from Call of Duty but without the explosive part of the arrows
---
Why?
---
MMR rollback system will kick in for any players in matches with banned DDoSers &gt; rainbow6.com/mmrrollback
---
I stand corrected. I do know they have invented a lot of tools though :P
---
I get paired with 4 stacks or 3 stacks a lot really fun getting tk'ed and having warden bans
---
Yes
---
Ok captain obvious.
---
You‚Äôre right that most likely he was on the cheater‚Äôs team and they won...
---
But you‚Äôre wrong about the other thing you said. When a cheater is banned, all the matches he played in a nullified, as if they didn‚Äôt happen. That means you lose elo if you won with them **or** if you beat them.
---
Atleast you got the re-fragüòÇüòÇ
---
Good job mateüëç
---
You gonna actually stop it from happening on consoles as well or just focus on PC? :/
---
This games entire meta is fire rate but fucken nahh lets add the awp in this bitch
---
Yeah shit would be cool not completely viable as a character but just fun and cool
---
You should equip the ice cream weapon skin on tachankas shotgun(if you got that skin)and then a pink cupcake charm.
---
You're very naive if you don't realize that one of the function of law enforcement is to protect profits above all else. They infact do work on this sort of thing because it is directly impacting Ubisoft's ability to conduct their business.
---
On top of that, if a botnet is being used on a videogame it can be used on other things as well. It behooves them to track down the proveyers of any sort of botnets.
---
Steam 
---
Helps keep your games and friends in one place
---
You‚Äôll still need u-play though
---
Can someone explain what these attacks are? Stupid question but I have no clue what they are.
---
I dunno really. I guess I just played better back then and preferred the operators of that time. No hate but I just ain‚Äôt a fan of what siege turned into
---
They don‚Äôt actually have a way to check which games they cheated in, and in any case Battleye bans in waves, not the first time it detects you‚Äôre cheating.
---
Nope
---
You can't cheat on xb1 and ps4, closest you can get is aim assist abusing with kb/m adapters on games like fn. 
---
R6 also does hwid bans
---
Hard to use but if you‚Äôre good with shields is very good
---
Gotcha
---
If you played him well . He is a nightmare
---
Go around as IQ in custom games on maps just going around finding all the cameras, helped me immensely when I first started
---
Boohoo, someone ruined my game, so its justified that they are put into the barbaric and unreasonable US criminal punishment system.
---
How can they tell who is doing it or not? I‚Äôm asking out of ignorance cause I am curious. Also, how can you tell if it‚Äôs happening to you or is just general connection issues?
---
Me and my buddies started reporting the problem when it happens.. no idea if it will help but yea it really sucks
---
So is piracy.
---
Enough people do it and it becomes almost impossible to enforce.
---
No its the worst gun
---
Can anyone explain what happened? I'm out of the loop
---
If it's anything like PC. Grouping multiple times with known cheaters gets you banned as well for boosting.
---
Thx man
---
Turns out it was just a bug xD
---
also type "you love to see it" in chat afterwards
---
Zofia is my favourite attacker because she has no whacky skins, I'm not sure how to feel about this headgear, maybe without the mohawk.
---
Goyo, Amari is kinda trash
---
Its there going to be Region Lock as well??
---
dude it‚Äôs just a game, chill out
---
Stop blowing my brain
---
Wait, there're people who rush with Thatcher?
---
I spent a solid minute thinking about how you were about to get plat 4.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure DDoS doesn‚Äôt mean google
---
Incels? Sure thing buddy.
---
Kid i said IF UBI IP BANS THEN IT WOULDNT MATTER if they take legal actions thats a alot of lawyers and if the console there going to need Xbox or Sony to ban them
---
I never had any freezing issues, but yes after the Ember Rise update, my game usually freezes either in matchmaking screen or after a match has ended.  Sound is still working (well stuck on a loop) but graphics are frozen and I'm forced to use task manager to end task.
---
Rook is the hardest character to play, why do you think he is rarely played in Pro League
---
Look at the NFL. They get caught all the time. Golden Tate just got caught. Edelman got caught last year as well. 
---
Would you look at that, they even got caught. Because they can! In siege, they can‚Äôt. 
---
‚ÄúTry again kid‚Äù ah yes, words of wisdom from an guy online always being right. Yikes
---
What about permanent bans for folks who use M and KB for consoles?
---
hey I have found  a workaround fix 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFyLnhCjqmw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFyLnhCjqmw) 
---
it worked for me I wish it works for you and if it does give a like to the man
---
Microsoft and Sony are bigger companies and they still have problems with DDoS
---
5hen they throw a tantrum when it actually happens to them lol
---
Banning because of overall utility is way more important than banning based off guns. Twitch‚Äôs drone is easy to take care of and Ash‚Äôs gadget isn‚Äôt all that special. Their guns are great but they don‚Äôt do as much for the team overall as other ops
---
What are Ddos or what does Ddos stand for?
---
That's a hardware issue, nothing ubi can do about that for now
---
I just sawed this hostage in half!
---
I believe someone further down the thread showed that someone in their group chat known to DDoS was banned from PS4, not Rainbow.
---
I'd still want the guy prosecuted for copying my car without paying for it.
---
&gt;Legal actions
---
üòØüçÜ
---
Distributed Denial of Service. Basically you send so much information to a server from many computers (DDoS) or one (DoS) that it can't process it all and eventually shuts down
---
thx
---
git gud then
---
No actually , because it‚Äôs social media and we are all strangers but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be a genuine person. But maybe the temptation of being a dick on the internet is too tempting for you
---
I‚Äôve had it happen to me twice. :( I think my teammates did it (in newcomer no less...) even though we were making a comeback.
---
Yep I just faced two ranked matches where someone DDoSd the server and booted everyone out. Basically meant the match didn‚Äôt count which sucked as we were 5 rounds in already. I‚Äôve seen people DDoS in casual too.
---
Oh merd√©
---
Yea deffinately. Quit searching about 1:20 in an retry seems to help
---
That's more about the morality than legality though. If someone copied a companies sensitive data you wouldn't say it was okay because the original data is still there.
---
Ill try
---
 kids are the usual ones that talk DDos, so wont be surprised if these attacks were behind one
---
What exactly is Dos/DDos ing? I have failed to find a good explanation on the interwebs.
---
Oh thanks man
---
Youre a fucking brainlet. Read the pinned post. When have they ever made the bans "IP bans"? Its just the account theyre banning.
---
Tbh I would love if Ubisoft went all-out and tracked some of the idiots doing this crap down with cybercrime units to make an example of them.
---
That's crazy honestly
---
Thx you üôå
---
which it *would* be gambling. nothing different from those and loot boxes
---
IP bans dont work in this day and age. Anybody with access to Google can figure out how to change their IP address or spoof one in like, 5 minutes.
---
I got a lot of downvotes last time I suggested prosecuting those people :(
---
Strongly disagree. In a even slightly coordinated team you can create three instant death traps with Goyo and Kapkan. Not only that, but you can electrify the key shields and protect it from Ash and Zophia and it doesn‚Äôt destroy the mine. 
---
That means the only reliable counters are Thatcher and frags. Not to mention these can be set and forget so Goyo can go off and soft roam and even if he dies he can positively affect the round. I can easily see him losing a shield.
---
Knowing is half the battle!
---
both of these can be changed (or at least they can be made to appear as if they have changed, but same effect) sadly. But probably a lot of cheaters will be too lazy to do any of that just to be able to get a new account.
---
Good job man! I remember my first ace. Ash still had here acog. And i was still a buck main! #BuckMainForLife
---
If you don't know how to report it, then why are you surprised that it goes under-reported?
---
frost inst from french canada only buck is
---
Try playing ranked. Nobody should be giving a shit about how good or bad people are playing in casual. Some people play the game a lot because they enjoy it, not because they are trying to get good.
---
They made some ip bans this hacker called Battleyetm got ip banned
---
That‚Äôs how I felt the first time I hit plat
---
.
---
100% goyo
---
How are you plat if u took out ur pistol with 24 bullets left
---
Fr that‚Äôd be dope. And on a less serious note also add a reflective safety vest skin so all the shields are flash shields in the right position. The balance is you are instantly visible, even at a glance or if you‚Äôre barely in line of sight
---
Sweet sweet sweeeet victory yeah!
---
No one uses warden
---
üëç
---
To bad they can't track who did it
---
Can someone explain me what's going no?
---
Lol
---
You really want to use the nfl? They don‚Äôt get caught, only the dumb asses with weed addictions get caught. They tell people weeks in advance when the testing is so they have time to cycle off and not get caught. 
---
&gt;Golden Tate just got taught 
---
Oh wow they are taking a past is prime receiver and making an example out of him lol 
---
&gt;Edelman 
---
Got caught using ‚Äúan unknown substance‚Äù that is deemed illegal by the nfl.
---
Why don‚Äôt you spend more than 5 minutes in google researching ped and hgh testing. It‚Äôs rampant in nfl/nba/olympics yet most avoid getting caught. [here‚Äôs an entire damn article about hgh and how players use it because there‚Äôs no way to catch them](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2602986-players-say-the-nfl-has-an-hgh-problem-even-if-peyton-manning-isnt-part-of-it)
---
I‚Äôve played 4 of my 10 ranked matches so far, 3 of which had at least 3 people booted due to their pings spiking into the several thousands for no reason. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt bad enough to shut the whole game down and most people rejoined but more often than not it ended up being a 4v5 in the other teams favor for most of the match. Shit gets old real quick. 
---
I‚Äôve also seen it in unranked and casual. It‚Äôs bad.

Any coordinated team will avoid these choke points unless absolutely necessary, plus ash and zofia can still destroy shields if the grenade is shot close to the shield but not a direct impact. He is similar to castle in the sense that he has too many counters to be considered a top tier op, he is still good though because of his batshit insane arsenal of weapons
---
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
---
Can they not make a system where we report and they review the clip? You can easily tell if someone is using a mouse.
---
sounds like mad cause bad
---
Why wouldn't they care? These people are hurting their game's reputation.
---
***sooooo was it worth buying mozzie instead of one of the new operators?***
---
I personally don‚Äôt have an issue with people buying them if they so desire. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not gambling. But if it‚Äôs fine now, I don‚Äôt think giving more options is inherently bad.
---
This makes too much sense. If it‚Äôs a 1v2 and you clutch up that should be a round win as long as you get the defuser before it goes off. 1v3 yesterday, I cleaned out all 3 guys and barely missed the defuse by half a second. A real kick in the balls
---
RIP then
---
Without hard evidence it's still iffy...
---
I know multiple people who got banned on XBOX for the old doc infammo glitch as well as temporary toxicity bans. Not to mention the temporary TK bans that are handed out freely.
---
People who rush in with defuser then die afterwards in a hard to reach spot
---
Not all of them, but some should be as a general deterrent from future DDoS attacks
---
I think it's about impossible to figure out just exactly who is doing the ddosing.
---
DEFINITION
---
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
---
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attack in which multiple compromised computer systems attack a target, such as a server, website or other network resource, and cause a denial of service for users of the targeted resource.
---
I'm so tired of seeing people ask an internet forum for the definition and getting told "Google?" Its not that hard to be considerate.
---
Nice one buddy
---
People mostly on high-rank console keep attacking ubi servers with a Distributed Denial of Service. Basically you send so much information to a server from many computers (DDoS) or one (DoS) that it can't process it all and eventually shuts down. When you do this during a game everyone's ping goes so high nobody can move or do anything, but the timer runs down. Now people who cheat this way will get permabanned
---
Did you try to reconnect?
---
Wow, even in lower elo you're not safe. Then again I got beat by a teleporting hacker in a casual match last season, so I can't really say I'm surprised.
---
Show me people who have been caught and banned by Ubisoft for using mnk on console. People in sports get caught all the time. Jon Jones got caught multiple times. He‚Äôs the GOAT but has been caught twice now. 
---
You‚Äôre just a sad little man who screams at people online. Get real
---
So like people intentionally trying to crash games
---
"to pay to win" Yeah gods forbid you spend $10 on a cheap mouse and keyboard at Goodwill.
---
Or just turn off his ringer
---
&gt; why Console doesn‚Äôt have different Recoil patterns than PC
---
It does have different recoil patterns. Majority of the high recoil operators have less recoil on consoles. Buck and kaid are really good examples of the different recoil levels.
---
Ok thank you
---
outbreak was an old mode in like  2016 lmao and a new game coming out in 2020

You're kinda sad, dude.

---
I thought so too, but someone  brought up an interesting idea: ubi knows what servers got attacked, when, and who was on it at the time. Using this they can find a pattern of people who are frequently in DDoSed servers and conclude they're the one doing it
---
if you read the pinned post it explains that they assigned 3 matches to 1 server. So it could be another game getting dos'ed and affected you as well
---
It gave me the penalty before I could do anything to the menu

Ash is a 3 speed and has barely any hit reg, Bandit can bandit trick and has a better gun and is a 3 speed, doc and finka are not on the same side, nor is caviera and nokk so you cant compare them
---
bruh moment
---
I am sad.
---
rendering cringe
---
Don‚Äôt even bother with ranks dude. These seasons with all the DDOSing and bullshit that happens doesn‚Äôt even matter. The higher your rank the higher the chance you‚Äôll run into doushbags like that. My placements were decent this season. Hit plat2 literally 2 elo points in and then boom, 3 matches ddos‚Äôed and dropped back down to 3400 elo. You‚Äôre better off where you are. Just coast and have fun now, stress free
---
It's just a line doing some cool flips to entertain you. He's trying his best
---
Good, now i just wonder why it took em so long
---
Mfw getting DDoSd during a ranked game
---
I don‚Äôt know if you are saying you agree with what I‚Äôm saying but I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. That‚Äôs the programmers job to figure out. All I know is that holding an angle and then dying from the spot you‚Äôre looking at without seeing anyone is very frustrating and you can‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs not a problem.

because they all have pro's and con's, they are not the same when you take into account speed and the gun they have
---
ash is also 3 speed with a better gun
---
bandit has 4 batteries and you can bandit trick(kaids gets taken out if you throw 2 thatchers down)
---
doc has much better heals/gun
---
nokk is on attack
---
Looks like someone is using their monitors crosshair addon.
---
how do you think they calculate personal skill level
---
When you loaded in was he still recruit?
---
That‚Äôs because console is generally more relaxed. Even in ranked, people likely are laid back in couches and are playing on a TV relatively far away from their faces. Another note is people may play their games muted if others are over. PC gaming, on the other hand, is much more intense and competitive due to the much wider variety of things available, an easy example would be leaning while not being ads, and the whole pro league thing exists on PC for most games, which is an incentive to get good. Who doesn‚Äôt want to possibly get money for playing their favorite game?
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah the first couple of bans are going to be on the top offenders list that has a trail of servers that are DDOS'ed on their matches. 
---
You know the ones on top of the MMR leader board with only 5 losses  out of like 200 matches. 
---
People who only attack one of two games a week is going to take a bit longer to track down. 
---
Same thing with hacking on pc really, If you teleport around insta killing the other team, you'll get a ban pretty fast. 
---
If you are using 'good' paid hacks and only use some soft aim or walls but hide it, you'll get away with it. Unless the hack gets discovered by battleye and added into the automatic detection.
---
If you're asking last French, Doc. If you mean Goyo, new operator this season.
---
Should've killed the kid anyway.
---
ela
---
i've seen too many people putting their goyo shields in the dumbest places where it just helps the enemy
---
If they did ban everyone on the team of a ddoser they would remove a major chunk of their playerbase
---
Yehehehes finally
---
wow
---
If you didnt buy any operator and play ranked, you get recruit as default.
---
Pressure makes plat
---
It's annoying but unless you want your head/hitbox to shrink to be just the camera, there isn't anything to do. Try holding angles from further away from your cover and not up against it.
---
If you disconnect and reconnect right before the game starts you'll get a recruit as a your automatic operator pick. 
---
Otherwise if you buy a new account and dont buy operators / the operators you have are already picked / banned, you'll get recruit.
---
If someone doesn't have any operators or all the operators they have been chosen, they will be auto picked to recruit
---
Is it possible for you to help me get the link? I don't see it on the website.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Get Goyo before he gets nerfed lol
---
You're right. I should appreciate it more.
---
Yea, for every DDoSer there are at least 5 people (the other team) who are innocent
---
They're seperating the Rooks from the Rookies.
---
i have also seen people putting a goyo being a wall, asking for a reinforcement and that reinforcement cause the shield to explode killing the 2 people who was waiting to rush to the explosion causing two teamkill and a 30 min ban.

I'm just hoping they don't try to take too big of a bite that someone like in my case gets banned for false positive. For about a week the servers I was on got attacked multiple times a day. I'm not sure if it was a squad mate or just bad luck. Even happened in casual lmao

How do you know Who is a ddos or sth in console? You need a battleeye or sth yo know from where is the packages launched, so... Only ban guys based in r6tab? In pc is obvious with battleeye
---
Not really obvious, last time ubi detected players who paid for boosting, the ban sadly lasted for few weeks only
---
On console there were basically 3 ways to reach champion before. DDOSing, Boosting and M&amp;k. 2/3 of these are gone. At least M&amp;k can be dealt with to some extent
---
yeah there are a lot of windows from what i saw on the outside
---
Aaaaaaaaaaahh I miss the outbreaküò≠
---
I don‚Äôt play ranked but I‚Äôve never run into DDoSers on PC, is this a console or ranked only problem?
---
Yeah the spawn peeking was a serious issue there
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a way to monitor that kind of activity
---
I would very much like an example of what windows you get too before 9 or so seconds of the round starting, because remember, it is only a 15 meter space.

A little abrasive but i get where you are coming from and have a legit point. Artificially inflated plaery count.
---
Sure they could monitor it but what will happen? If they just kick the person out it leaves the rest of the team a unfair disadvantage
---
Probably the best English any salt mine could have.
---
Ash vs Zof
---
Ash is a 3 speed and makes man sized holes guaranteed to rush through and has flashbangs to blind the people she jumps. Really simple tactic with her. Zof has impacts for vaultable or crouch holes and sometimes ones you can run through if its perfectly placed. She also is a 2 speed and lacks flashbangs which are super helpful in breaching rooms. 
---
Both have positive win deltas but Zofia is much lower and less picked.
---
Bandit vs Kaid 
---
Bandit is a 3 speed and can BANDIT TRICK which is one of the most useful things in the game at times and can determine wins and losses of rounds or even matches. Bandit tricking is when you wait for hibana or thermite to place their gadgets and immediately using the shock wire to break it whilst countering thatcher. You can do this with Kaid but with much less control and more guess work as both deploy times on hibana and thermite are faster than electroclaw activation, let alone throwing it on time. 
---
Bandit has a perfectly balanced win delta and over double the pick rate Kaid has. Kaid has a very negative win delta. You are much more likely to win with Bandit statistically speaking.
---
Doc vs Finka
---
This isnt any fair comparison as they're not even on the same sides. Doc is a defender and Finka is an attacker. Doc is significantly less advantageous operator to choose but you dont get to choose between Finka and Doc since they are on opposite teams. 
---
Vigil/Cav vs Nokk
---
Not comparing same side operators. Vigil and Cav are defenders while Nokk is an attacker. Nook isn't completely silent when using Hel but is much quieter. Cav is supposed to be silent when moving. Cav also negates footprints iirc so Jackal cant track Silent step. If Nook sprints, she doesnt get the quietness she has normally with Hel. Vigil is immune to Lion scans when using his ERC7. Vigil and Cav are 3 speeds.
---
Vigil has a somewhat higher win delta compared to Cav but is less popular. Nokk has a very negative win delta.
---
nah, but mute should get an acog on the mp5k

Already did, mate. I had problems to verify the game files (In Uplay and, later, in steam, when I tried to rollback my decision) and needed to download part of the game again. I'm trying to understand if this was a possible cause, because other than that, there's any. I already opened tickets and no one on Ubi seems to care enough to give me a answer; they just say that there's nothing they can do about Bans and that I should mail Battleye. And... battleye never answered.
---
Did you solo-queue? If so, why can't I get randoms like you
---
If you're not then don't worry, I'm sure other people are on the struggle bus today too lmao.
---
Is this also for console players?Or dose this only apply to PC?
---
Bruh moment
---
The game yes not the round lol
---
I feel this comment,  I'm a plat player but never got into plat without a massive losing streak before hand. Always gave up and came back a day or 2 later.
---
Then there's only two courses of action left - nag Ubisoft and BattlEye, or buying a new account.
---
Except the electroclaw is much easier to destroy and makes it next to impossible to bandit trick. Thats why its BANDIT tricking.
---
Hardware ban, IP ban, Credit card ban, and an account ban. If you make a new account and use the same card you're banned. If you use the same of you're banned. If you use the same IP you're banned. Keep them off at all costs
---
I like skyscraper. I don't like run outs.
---
No pls i want internet points
---
They did a global ban. Got my other account banned as well.
---
Yeah I solo queue; "Clandestine2006" was a little kid and he was level 11, asking how to crouch and he only had Fuze and no other operator. I helped him out here and there telling him some tips and who to buy but at the same time it was kinda weird him being in my team (I'm plat 1 level 250)
---
And this is why we ban thatcher
---
EAT A FUCKING DICK YOU LITTLE SHITS
---
I remember my first time hitting plat during Operation Burnt Horizon, and the game I made it, we won on Villa by killing the other team and were in the middle of defusing the bomb with less than 3 seconds to spare...
---
Then the screen froze for my entire team because we all got DDOSed and I got an abandon penalty, and I rage quit. Then I got on the next day and found I got refunded my MMR and was sitting pretty 7 points into Plat 4.
---
Long story short Fuck DDOSers.
---
Or a fireman
---
But yes Phil swift elite would be perf
---
Very, very trash
---
Her Spear is not all that good. 
---
Her heals are less than Doc overstim. She is also an attacker so...
---
That is insanity. Good on you for not being a total dick to a newcomer, kindness online goes a long way.
---
The sound it makes is so satisfying
---
Maverick, Twitch, IQ, Dokkaebi, Buck, Ash, Zofia, Sledge, and Finka can all destroy it without Thatcher's help
---
Aw man. Been about 2 months for me. I love doing it because it's fun. I'm trying to get better at it because maybe it will go somewhere. But it's time consuming and so is college lol. But if you want to take a look here's a link and I'll take a look at yours as well if you want https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxE1lX22FEA5a5UuR0tJAkA

"You have been charged with 15 counts of electronic tampering, 12 counts of online service denial and 4 counts of inappropriate communication. The sentence, is death. How do you plead?"
---
"I just wanted plat..."
---
"I knew you'd say that."
---
console aim lol
---
what?
---
Twice today!
---
Lucky, I got to about 18 MMR from plat then lost the next 16 games in a row
---
Ash doesn't need to be nerfed, I feel like she's in a good place right now.
---
I've never played competitive matches because I get disconnected every other games.
---
Thatcher rushing is BDE?
---
Just cause you ran into a team that was fucking around in a match doesnt mean the operator you used need reworking.
---
No I am talking about ranked my friend and I always get unlucky and our teams are absolute shit and the shitty teammates end up being around level 100
---
There is no universe in which the new Hereford is objectively worse than the old one.
---
Oh its cas
---
Best thing now is plat is easier to get into during placements if you were plat previous seasons
---
Nice. Was half expecting to see bronze 1 because it would have been a great joke but I'm glad you fought through all the bs
---
Oof dude, you'll get yours. I did manage to make it to 22 points within plat again. Crazy thing is this mmr was easy last season because plat was a full 100 points higher. It's getting over the cusp that my brain breaks.

Gotta boost your ego with some rank you got in a game by cheating
---
The old one was fun to play but not competitive, this one‚Äôs not fun to play and isn‚Äôt competitive either
---
Yeah lmao its shitty i switched my sens up a bit but its still a controller and at the end of the day its incomparable to mouse and keyboard
---
Basically just me and a random, trolling my friend, who has a sensitive headset xD
---
I don‚Äôt know if you read the whole thing but I said I am new to the game so I don‚Äôt even know what levels are good. Also I‚Äôm not even hyping myself up at all I just said I usually do better than the people who are in level 100.
---
I miss favela too! I know I'm in the minority it here, y'all can hate, but I dont care
---
This clip is not on loop. It just keeps rubberbanding.
---
They did
---
The Jackal was a bot
---
Lmao
---
Never thought id be able to pull this off with 8 randoms on console.
---
Account ban. Which sounds lame compared to a console ban but it makes me hard knowing that all digital content, including whatever game they bought through PSN, is now gone to them forever. Scummy little rats deserve it.
---
wow cool!
---
map knowledge if that hasn't been said already like 200+ times
---
Okay so I'm just going to assume you're on console then because hacking is super easy on pc you literally just go to "the" website pay them some money and boom you got wall hacks and aimbot. Way easier than using an ip sniffer and using a botnet, also probably cheaper too. I'm not signed up to their forums so I cant check the price but I doubt it's more than 20 bucks
---
Idk lol I didn't notice
---
People still swat people over video games even though it keeps getting innocent randoms *killed*.
---
Kids , apparently
---
You *really* think it‚Äôs a good idea for it to not affect your rank if a teammate leaves during a match?
---
It can also fuck up your router too btw. Knew a kid got a slap on the wrist cause he knocked someone off for 24 hours.
---
And make it not as visible to counteract the timer. Or not, idk how balancing works.
---
Git gud
---
Cool animation!!! 10/10
---
Doesn't the bomb beep on the site it's on? Or is it just a global beep?
---
europe
---
I have tried to find teams but they just abandon me so  I'm stuck with my friend who also agree that randoms are often awful. Especially on console. It's hard to rely on them when they can't tell their left from their right really. I dont solo queue unless I'm bored. Basic bans are a waste if you know how to counter them. At least use the ban on someone based on the environment like I said earlier. It's so useless banning Jackal on small maps. That's like banning Dokkaebi in Bank, a large map. Clash and Valk are no problem but their bans are dumb and a waste as Clash has many counters and so does Valk.
---
Big fan of the ending
---
ash  doesnt need to get reworked i know i put the first thing to my mind sorry if i offended any ash main

Then that might be why, it's early in the morning / night all over Europe right now.
---
I've been cursed in silver, started playing from this year beginning and everytime i need a game to get to gold i get into 4v5 and 3v5 games and then just go on a loosing streak back to silver 4
---
Its just sooo heart breaking 
---
Ps i solo queue
---
Ddos is the intentional overloading of a server using multiple computers to ‚Äúattack at the same time‚Äù
---
Dos is the same thing but with a single computer source
---
Well yeah , reduced matchs per servers , not deleting all of them
---
Invalid flare r/wrongsubreddit
---
I love this meme
---
Shouldn‚Äôt echo be with them? ü§îü§îü§î
---
C'mon i can't be the only one in my time zone trying to enjoy some r6
---
yeh, I wish they would so guesswork wouldn't be too involved in a tactical game.
---
I hate the second and 3rd floor of new hereford but 1st and basement are chill.
---
Explanation pls
---
bruh i could send you at least 3 1v5 aces with Ash and i still think she is balanced rn with all the possible trap ops to choose she cant even Rush as good so...
---
Thought i was the only one
---
How do I get the flair?
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ so freaking accurate lol
---
Its not just an attack on normalities of console, its blatant cheating. 
---
There are head turns and snaps that are close to impossible to do without mouse and keyboard, the mouse gives a HUGE advantage over thumbsticks
---
I dont even play ranked any more cause of how toxic people are
---
No gold 4?
---
If only they fixed this last season so I could get my Elo back from the two games I was DDOSed from
---
Lol yea it's horrible but that happened in casual
---
Favela is the discounter version of hereford.
---
Its just a useless map, but it can be fun if you want to just do shenannigans. 
---
Favela insta leaver here.
---
Halo had a competitive matchmaking system?
---
OoOoOoOh thats bismuth
---
Nice!
---
Noob question what is DDosing?
---
Lion: advanced drone
---
Just wondering, is PC included in this as well? I haven‚Äôt crashed a lot of times but, one time, I collected my first  weekly Ubi Club challenge and my game instantly froze.
---
Then coppers in casual
---
Yes and no. Old map with a covered outdoor stairwell and 1 or 2 subtle changes may have been just fine
---
That‚Äôs nothing boys. Will playing hostage one of my mates shot my shield it killed the hostage and a team mate I got a 30 minute ban while the guy that shot the shield got a reverse tk.
---
Cool thanks!
---
All the enemy‚Äôs are bots
---
He should change it now as maestro (a cam based operator) got impacts instead of the shield..
---
Dos
---
And the other one isn't?
---
Oh hahaha I got to shoot them again "Oh nevermind they left the game after 10 seconds"
---
When it does come back can they look into making sure accidental disconnects late in a match that you win still count and queue bans don‚Äôt follow? It used to be a lot to ask for but I feel like how we deal with disconnects going forward this could be sorted out as well. It‚Äôs sort of a night ender when one person in your premade times out or lags out the last round and can‚Äôt connect in time for the match to end, and then end up with a 2 hr ban. At the very least some things should be adjusted for full premades, including detecting friendly fire.
---
But her elite Frostmats are much easier to spot
---
The fact that he has a high dps attacker like weapon while being 3 speed? That‚Äôs enough for a nerf. No defender has something like that
---
I don‚Äôt even know, he was trying to peek someone and went prone and told me he was stuck then he crouched and got sucked in to the cabinet
---
#TOKEYOTOMAREEEE
---
hm? 4 seconds left and all i need to do is survive? better run around.
---
Daily dose of DOS
---
Too few entry points for attacker plus all 4 stairs are choke points for attackers. No window in 2f laundry room, compressor room is defender sided too
---
It's a smasher from the Outbreak mode siege had during operation Chimera
---
Idk alot about guns, im pretty sure his gun is not high DPS. Ela can shred faster than him and she is a 3 speed as well. 
---
|No defender has something like that
---
Then again Ela, Alibi, Bandit as well.
---
I always check on R6tracker.com if a player is legit. For example if his W/L in % is &gt;75% I know he is probably not...
---
My opinion:it's one of the best maps released in a while
---
Pros: opinion, it's a really good map
---
Cringe: people complaining about new maps without learning how to attack.
---
The pick rate of 70% was from July before 5 ops had frags. It was only buck sledge and finka
---
Ohh so that‚Äôs what it looks like to get DOSed, I‚Äôve had that a few times this week but assumed it was my WiFi
---
Should be an IP ban

Hello B3N_4279, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d6abnk/ash_ddosing_ace/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
YEAAAAHHHH I WON! IM PLA- BOOM
---
Good shit

You 4 months too l8

"made with mematic"  
---
  
---
made with mematic
---
Pdw has an acog, which I believe they don't want to allow else she would have gotten the mp5sd.
---
First, I‚Äôd say screw with your sensitivity, while it won‚Äôt fix your skill right away, it could help in the long run, jump to a sensitivity you know you wouldn‚Äôt use, like 80 or 90, then move your way back until you‚Äôre able to control your aim smoothly. Second learn the maps, especially cams, just jump into a custom match and use the defense round to look at where the cams are, go and shoot them, then test yourself on the attacking round. And don‚Äôt forget to look at the compass and learn the names and call outs for places, you could also use this time to look into different angles you could hold on curtain maps. Third, I would recommend picking ops that  have passive, or non kill oriented abilities that can help your team, or harm the opposing team, such as Rook and Kapkan on def, and Finka or Thatcher on attack. The main reason I say that is because on defense your gadgets are still useful if you die, and everybody likes a Rook, and on attack You don‚Äôt have to be near the fighting to be useful with Finka and you can work around losing a Thatcher, but it‚Äôs nice when there is one. Fourth, don‚Äôt be afraid to think outside the box, I would recommend watching The Russianbadger for a general idea of what I mean, and don‚Äôt be afraid to put things in the stupidest places for what I call the ‚Äú Why would they put that there‚Äù, effect: a Claymore in a random drone hole, a frost map halfway across the map. Fifth, think about how you want to play, do you want to be serious? Play ranked. Do you want to have fun? Play casual, and don‚Äôt let anyone talk down to you for your choice. I‚Äôve been playing since Velvet Shell, and I‚Äôve never been ranked. Finally, challenge yourself: many people have been playing the same way for years now, and if you force them to change they will go from gods to looking like you gave the controller to a toddler. Don‚Äôt be a one trick.

Attackers can barely get into the building. Relying on hard breachers the few hard breachers isn‚Äôt gonna work. Especially when there are 4 stair cases, and an outside rotation.
---
I could Come but im in school
---
No
---
good.
---
Thank you.
---
It's a serious issue but investigating every instance will literally be borderline impossible to convict everyone. Nobody will be getting jail time for DDoSing people on r6 a few times.
---
Yeah bur thr r4c standalone is a top 5 as well. 39/860 beats every gun on defense except the alda and smg11 which aren't beaten by most of the attacker guns.
---
She needs a REALLY good defense gun, or a VERY WEAK AR. And SUBSTANTIAL gadget buffs.
---
The MMR will most likely still be negated considering they aren‚Äôt able to narrow down each match. If everyone crashed out they will probably remove the win or lose ELO
---
Its an easy win for attack if you place gu mines near the hostage ... i always shot the hostage from far away, if i notice gu mines around it.
---
People will have someone leave any match they‚Äôre losing. People will even leave right at the start any time they don‚Äôt like the look of the matchup on R6 Tracker.
---
A Romanian man got a 1 year sentence in I think 2018 for Ddosing in WoW .  So with this I hope they make an example of as many people as they can and hopefully stop others from trying it in the future.

Graphic design is my passion

Pick 2 if you have the cash.

That way you'll never get bored.
---
Is it a good idea to buy an op skin for an op you dont play?
---
1. Kinda odd but I can accept it
---
2. Why? In your opinion at least.
---
I saw it happen on PC twice last season.
---
A lesson can be learnt to never just duck around until the game is *actually* won.
---
Hey I play on both, this is almost my usual experience with PS4 compared to PC.
---
Attacker : 
---
Name - All-Father
---
Gadget - Raven Drone
---
Ability - Drone can fly around, and if left stationary for 2 seconds turns invisible. Like twitch, this would replace his regular drones.
---
Defender:
---
Name - Freya
---
Gadget - Gugnir
---
Ability - Thrown javelin that attaches to any surface, and deploys a rope that can be used for rappeling from it.
---
Also Ubi is taking legal actions against ddos websites
---
U never know ,  we don't really have the complete story of "N√∏kk" yet, we'll see in the future what ubisoft decides to do with her (probably nothing).  But would be awesome if she wasn't Danish (since Danes kinda suck)
---
Oh ok ah well Im only an xbox player but i mostly matchmake with ok players
---
Totally unrelated, you're not going to get banned or anything as long as you aren't the perpetrator.
---
Nice to know
---
Maybe reducing the no of the destruction like they did with some of the windows on the new reworks and adding extra stairs inside that's all they needed to do, but instead they made it a maze and having bombsites where you drop in from a window and plant.
---
I dont think they would care. People can be cunts like that.
---
I'm pretty sure I put the battery on the left wall and it did nothing
---
yeah phantom sight charm
---
I dont know if it is a bug, or you just hit the pixel, long as i have done bandit tricking i know that that looks like the perfect pixel place where you can place shock at right wall.
---
A screenshot of a twitter post of a screenshot of a reddit comment.

Well done man üëçüëç

It's actually very easy when you have control of one node, most/all packets in are coming from the source machine and all packets out are going to the target. And packet tracing is very simple to do. And besides, I suspect most of these kids are skids with online booter subscriptions, not botnets.
---
Yeah it's so much worse now it's ridiculous
---
Seriously... I doub't they care too much. R6 is so cheap so often. What we need are Hardware ID bans.
---
U need new acc for deluxe, thats all
---
Imagine thinking original Hereford was better. It had a garbage layout that was unbalanced. Ask any pro league member lol.
---
You have entered the comedy area
---
u stoopid?
---
Same here. Xbox has been crapping out all night. Straight up stopped working, got it figured out, and then it would kick me out of the game after every match and have to reconfigure all my settings
---
3 french and a mexican.....oh lord it's 1862 all over again.
---
Youtube keeps pissing me off....  Way 2 much ads... Arent there any new video platforms?
---
He probably panicked and tried to run away from OP but in his haste he didnt notice the trap
---
You can see patterns of players that happen to be winning games and games that happen to be being attacked etc
---
But yeah, tracing it through a botnet is a very tall order.
---
Its still illegal in most western countries
---
I can‚Äôt tell what is worse, the DDOSing, or the constant spawnpeeking on reworked Kanal
---
Yeah but a doc discharging an entire clip from a p90 somehow manages to kill me smh
---
Honestly, me too mate ;) hahah
---
It's not a permanent thing.
---
i mean.... the new one isn't really a remake, it just took over the name. does it even share anything besides a theme and name with the old one layout wise?
---
at least haha
---
They can set up another account but they've lost access to any digital content that they had on PSN.
---
True xd
---
Yep. It's wonderful to see.
---
I mean some people are obvious ddossers
---
I'd actually prefer smokes. Her primary problem is not having team based utility and being a selfish op. While that would work on defense, it's meh on attack.
---
This would make her good as a fragger and utility op.
---
But I never use glaz
---
I doubt it. Recently a friend of mine reported to ubi with proof of being cyberbullied, they responded that the matter will be escalated to their security team, but ubisoft will not inform him whether any action has been taken against the bullies as its between ubisoft and the bullies.
---
There are many ways to buff her without changing the weapon she uses to another. This is the balancing factor that keeps her from being too strong. 
---
Don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt request for gadget buffs and equipment changes over any weapon (or speed) changes
---
my high score is 30:35
---
I love rushing whit lion shotgun
---
ahh aright thanks!
---
Yup. 
---
Smokes give her some team utility in terms of cutting off LoS or plant possibilities.
---
Frags allow her to have more killing power (to compensate for FMG9 if people have an issue with it), and allows her to take out more valuable utility, especially Maestro cams (which she can sneak past and then destroy). 
---
Both choices are better than Breaches and Claymore
---
Guys is ddos a thing in PC?
---
That was perfection. I wish more people thought this way
---
This helps nobody in this situation as Ubi are talking about DDOS attacks on their servers, not users themselves.
---
Sure, having a VPN is great, but even easier is just don‚Äôt join parties with people you don‚Äôt know or who are on the enemy team.. That‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôll get your IP address.
---
This is a tough one haha
---
Ah the claymores power
---
Only in plat or diamond or champions and all the dossiers are getting banned now
---
Trust me man it‚Äôs not lag. I have shit aim every now and then but like I said I‚Äôm a plat I run into it so often I often record clip of it not working, then again might be the console difference. All I can speak to is my personal experience but it‚Äôs awful
---
Then they would get sued.
---
whats wrong with it
---
CSGO seems to be in a fine spot too, I dont see any lawsuit against them.
---
G a n g
---
Yeah fuck favela
---
Why do people still take Siege seriously
---
Cause they have the rights.
---
New ops don‚Äôt get much I would say at the moment now but later they will
---
I don‚Äôt feel so good mister goyo
---
Do you have any evidence?
---
This is the real question. I completely agree. Game companies ban people all the time for cheating or something of the sort. But the only thing it does is get the banned player to make a new account. IP bans would really be the only option here. Otherwise the "Ban Wave" is completely useless.
---
As a zofia main j would like some kind of cosmetic that isn't just a slight colour variation or her just getting a winter hat
---
nice
---
Jackel is totally a word and totally his name it's not JACKAL
---
Ddos and hackers are pretty rare since i only saw 5 hackers in 1700hours and got my elo back when they got banned a day later. i have never seen someone get ddossed on pc
---
33 to 50% of my games currently in plat 2 rank. There are various versions of ddos.
---
- outright cancelling the match. Everybody's ping rises to 20.000+ meaning everybody is dropped. This usually (in my experience) means the match is simply cancelled and nobody loses or wins. 
---
- freezing attackers in place. They raise the ping to 1000-4000 meaning nobody can move, which is an automatic win for attackers. They do this for 3 rounds, lowering ping between rounds. When they  have to attack they rush site, plant and increase pings again. Defenders are unable to defuse. 
---
Ubi has just released a blog which implements some really decent steps to try and minimize the DDOSing.
---
I felt that
---
send any good evidence to support
---
Not with 10 windows and doors all around the site
---
And then there are kids that still think spawnpeeking is toxic and disadvantageous to attackers SMH my head.
---
Cuz they thought he couldn‚Äôt clutch
---
And this is a repost without credit
---
This comment right here is fucking golden.
---
That‚Äôs what they meant by evaluating their legal options and working close together with Microsoft azure
---
I mean, Polish ops are far from new. Finka and Lion have a lot of good bundles, and even Mozzie and Gridlock have way better cosmetics comparatively.
---
You are overthinking this
---
Ah yes, I know. Very good, ubi did something for once.
---
I'm not sure what Siege tracks but I would think they track every single action you take on Siege, so also matches that crash Midway through. 
---
Also, yes people are this stupid, your computer just shares your ip. If you dos from your own computer without vpn it's very easy to track the attack to you PlayStation. 
---
Combine that with reports (through their website) and there is quite a good way to track some of them. We just need a handful to be permabanned and suddenly people won't be as eager to do it.
---
PlayStation has also (reportedly) been suspending people from ps plus which means you could lose quite a bit
---

---
Sadly no, in hindsight looking back on what happened would make sense for some of the real weird ones
---
Most of the time, from the videos posted on here, it seems to be connection issues or aim. That doesn't account for 100% however.
---
On what base are you going to ban the people. 
---
Is it going to be community ss and video 
---
Or the top 100 ?  
---
Can you provide more information about this ?

IQ is the most complete elite in the game, i dont use her but is the only one with good skins, mvp animation and outfits. Sledge is too vintage, glaz not bad but there better then him

Ubi pls.

If he was hacking he'd be like a 2.0 or higher k/d
---
Somewhat next week
---
Read the blog post
---
In redit app and safari

So, no you haven't?

That clears it up. So they basically break the server so the other guys can‚Äôt win the game?

I think my Finka rush strats has worked up incredibly well, sometimes when the ying didnt fluke the throw

Tbh Im not quit certain on what to think maybe Ubi should try something like that out in TTS
---
"Bug Fix- Respawn Glitch fixed, Jesus has been banned for using it."
---
Tha chat is saying it. The team is gonna kick him if he doesnt clutch.
---
Well that isnt the problem hacking involves kicking persons in a match, ddossing them and seeing them through the walls so you shouldnt have to get much kills if you are hacking.
---
They‚Äôre all really good for individual play styles, and especially for team focus but if you‚Äôre mostly solo it‚Äôs probably finka or lion
---
How about a mmr reset after the ban wave? A new more fair start for everyone

I thought there is a nsfw video

I m getting flashbacks, same situation.  I clutched it from 1vs4 and killed the last guy with 1 second left

Kicked

More of this pls

kill it with fire
---
Because you can flick on console

Cuz toxic bois
---
That would be insanely OP, especially considering there are other ela mains like myself that can already control the recoil. She already has a really strong gadget so she shouldn‚Äôt get that significant of a damage buff. I fell like 26 damage (468) would be a more balanced amount.
---
I use both at the same level.
---
I'm torn because it's perfect and you shouldn't ruin it but on the other hand it would be so much better to see that in game. You have to play for other people to really see it. So I dunno.

yes, but ubi doesnt read reddit so... ):
---
Noice (:
---
Idk why he wouldn‚Äôt stay at the bottom of the stairs though. If that nomad starts planting with 1 second left he needs to be there to shoot her. 
---
But it‚Äôs easy to backseat game. I prob would have died to a doc spawn perk 1 second in anyway.

Well, it's not like ash is available on defense lol... No hard feelings though ;)

&gt;"Angered by a player he regularly competed against, the defendant determined to defeat his WoW opponents by interrupting the game's server so they could not access the game," according to a defense sentencing memorandum.

Yeah he is better than you. He took the corner wide and got an angle on you before you could see him because you're so close to the corner. It's basic perspective.

Since when people catch feelings for playing with ash ? tf

Is this just PC, or does it include consoles?

Ain't that a frag in the hostage room?

Agreed (and I love your flair)

You didn't have enough legs to kick them all
---
If someone team kills you and you vote "no" when asked if it was intentional, it doesn't turn on RFF for them.  I would assume that isn't changing... Although the one downside of this is that it's going to be even more annoying when it's clearly accidental and they vote yes anyway, but that's certainly less common than a squad having different members team kill each round so this is definitely a net positive.
---
Real question though is, why do you know about this site?
---
You absalute chad, well done.
---
But what if the boyfriend shoots you
---
That's quite bit faster than the scar isn't it? Kinda depends on the damage/handling, if it fires as smooth and hits as hard as sledges ar it could be op..
---
Whats the point in doing that if everyone knows you cheated?
---
PS: some clips are pretty old as I was too shy to share them :)
---
You‚Äôve always been able to lean while ADS on controller. Only difference is that unlike PC you can‚Äôt lean without being ADS

Can't stand boosters. Play with your own rank and not pick on lower ranks to get a rank you don't deserve

Headshots
---
Congrats üëç
---
I feel like there should be a picture here.
---
Congratulations my guy, I remember my first ace. There‚Äôs nothing quite like it!
---
Don't pass that around.
---
&gt; Her shotgun is actually only good at mid range.
---
This is the problem. Shotguns by logic are supposed to only excel at short-ranges, not medium ranges. SMGs are supposed to have more range, and better at close range than ARs but worse than shotguns, yet it's completely fucked up for her guns. Her shotgun is better at close ranges because it's still a shotgun at the end of the day, and it's better than her SMG at mid-range which makes no sense whatsoever. On top of that it's very accurate when people can fire it accurately without even ADS-ing.
---
&gt; Ela would still be the weakest defender by a long shot.
---
She needs an SMG buff, but the shotgun needs to go back to being just a shotgun.
---
She also needs one more Grzmot mine, and impacts I would say.

You‚Äôre right but you‚Äôre so whiny and annoying holy shit.

Or, when in ranked, ban Goyo.
---
...Try again man.

That's goyo's fault
---
Nah I tell him where to go and sometimes his resulting death reveals an enemy location
---
Would have been helpful
---
I've improved too as I've been lowering my sensitivity and learning game maps better over the last two seasons. I was a silver player before but now I'm high gold so this could very well be the case for me too.

Great, more skins we will never see. Just make them purchasable ffs.
---
I donno, I kinda like it.
---
Now I don't have to play with my friends who suck at the game and I didn't know how to say I don't want to play with them xD.
---
So you seriously believe those caught will get 10+?
---
No one is gonna get sentenced.
---
Hopefully fixed
---
I just looked the video up. It seemed almost like he was echo droned. But he was on defense so I‚Äôm
---
Not sure
---
I didn‚Äôt expect this position to work then I blasted her face
---
Yeah this has been there since early this year. My question is, is this only for PC players or console too? Because if not console players have lost a LOOT of mmr.
---
I saw the site here yesterday after the news broke they were gonna start banning people
---
If you play ranked with your friends you and/or they will be in games you/they have no business being in. If you want to play with your friends and your rank isn‚Äôt high enough, casual is the place for that. In competitive play players should be playing against other players who are considered to be of a fairly similar skill level.
---
Yeah same, every time I try it I can‚Äôt find a game
---
Smh, y‚Äôall sleeping on BOOSTIO
---
I like the other answer but it means "If I remember correctly"
---
You do realize that the severity of taking down 5+ services is quite bigger than taking down 3 games of siege, right?
---
And I mean, playstation network, steam, league of legends etc.
---
I dont care about your certifications, I care about your black and white way of viewing punishment. That's not really how it works. The guy wouldnt have gotten 10+ years if he didnt attack several targets.
---
‚ÄúIf I remember correctly‚Äù
---
900% of them are script kiddies and don't know how to cover their tracks, so bans are going to get skyrocketed, and the ones who were the most DDoS happy might be tried in court for breaking federal laws, if they decide to take it that far.
---
1000 MMR max difference
---
I seriously don't think she would have been powerful with AR. Vigil does the same with a better gun and 3 speed, he is considered balanced.
---
If the AR was anything like the F2 or R4C, I would agree. But if it was anything like Capitao's or Thermite AR, she would be in a lot better position than she is in now.
---
yeah i'm aware
---
 I did just check the site and this is indeed the message that displays. As much as I want this to be real, I'm not so sure this is an official statement. 
---
The logos shown for Ubisoft and Microsoft are both older versions, a bit odd for an official notice. Also the amount of detail and explanation in the description, as well as the style of writing seems somewhat rushed and unprofessional (lack of punctuation and proper copyright notation). 
---
I'd wait to hear official confirmation from Ubi, but fingers crossed this is whats coming to all DDOS services.
---
Well played my dude. I know how hard it is to pace yourself and remain focused when the odds of survival are this low.
---
I'm so mad you didn't knife her. She basically begged you to slide 6 inches of steel between her vertebrae.
---
Whats the fact?
---
10+ all depends on the judge it's less likely the judge will give them the max sentence unless they are repeat offenders (in this case i mean they DDoSed multiple times before they were arrested).

If you wanna have multiple mains you can only have 5 but you need to edit one of them delete it all then put :Ela:(capital and there has to be the two dots for each you can add spaced in between or text but I don‚Äôt
---
It‚Äôs a picture
---
Awesome job dude, keep going at it!
---
:o
---
Damn ok that‚Äôs a pretty big gap, so a plat would be able to queue with a silver? Isn‚Äôt that kinda what they were trying to get rid of?
---
Indeed... however I feel like it could hit soft yet have a bit of recoil that‚Äôs hard to control but would definitely reward accurate players and surprise attacks. Like hmmm like I would make the recoil hard to control, the fire rate slow, yet if you can get the shots on it would definitely kill, not the most reliable AR but one that would take skill to use I feel
---
it's not a trick, it was removed because it was a cheesy move. it wasn't fun to play against
---
Would buy and exclusively use
---
Wait.... that‚Äôs rook armor? When I could just stim my penis

Fuck yeah.

yup since the new season mine will freeze randomly and crash. happens way more with my steam version for some reason
---
They are,it depends on how old they are when they got release,for example,almost (think) Y1 ops are 10000 Renown (25000) back then
---
Or cause you to slip and fall on your ass like nomads airjab
---
This looks clean
---
I like to imagine GIGN members are lovers and feel emotional pain when another dies
---
They said they were aiming for 100, not a promise. But yes, keeping the abilities fresh will be a tall order. Different individual guns aren't important.

---
Well yeah, you'd have to be a repeat offender. They aren't going to permanently ban some script kitty. I hesitate to say they use a 3 strike rule, but the ToS outline only mentions repeat offenders of certain activities getting a device ban.
---
1 shot against any armor? what gun are you using, a 50. Cal?
---
Like? I'm curious
---
Let me rephrase. We made it on B site, killed echo, then frantically locked down the obj forgetting who even had defuse and it slowly fell apart Vs us expecting to breach the window and all die immediately
---
LOL
---
But do you think ‚Äò100‚Äô is a bit of a stretch?
---
Why quit
---
that's both the blessing and the curse of siege right there
---
Quite possibly yeah.
---
It‚Äôs not, I always get commons, I went on a streak with Black Ice and now I get commons
---
My friend‚Äôs POV because an error in the application killed my clip

From scale 1-5 how would you rate your life?
---
Since you're reposting content for internet karma, start from below 3.

Sure was. I know my shot was just suppressive fire at him. His shot was ridiculous.
---
As much as I would like to believe this, I do not believe Microsoft or Ubisoft has the authority to seize websites or issue warrants. EUROPOL, like INTERPOL just helps local police organize better accross borders.
---
Such a seizure would need to be made by the police authority within the country where the servers are located.
---
Or I might be completely ignorant.
---
Finally i opend 50 alpha packs this season and havent gotton anything better than a rare
---
Not sure prolly someone on TSM with Beaulo getting all the kills, I just remember Kixstar talking about it
---
Shit like this never works in my casuals. Half the time, walls are left soft or doors reinforced for bait
---
The battle pass sounds pretty neat, free stuff for playing
---
Sneaky cav
---
I lone how the name of the Operation is "(D)Dos off", which makes me think they really wanted to call it "Fuck off" but weren't allowed
---
what a fucking joke
---
Yeah I cant wait for it tbh
---
None of them have a below 1 kd lol. We're talking about in game kd. Not kd in a pro league match which can't have every pro being above 1
---
we have clips about it, it was nerfed after 1 entire pro league, almost at any match glaz would get a easy 3k
---
now is it real or not real, am confused.
---
I got the whole enemy team on casual to fuck around but my teammates were sweaty tryhardes and wanted those kills
---
Is it ip ban or hardware ban?
---
I didn‚Äôt know they added Liu Kang to Siege
---
It's not that much
---
This sub will upvote a video of their wife getting fucked so long as it has a funny epic meme edit on it

I love the AUG A3 (‡≤• ñÃØ‡≤•)

Why doesn‚Äôt the website work at all on mobile it‚Äôs such bullshit

Its not only by me, its a felony which can get you punished up to that amount, not saying THAT IS WHAT YOU GETl. But i really would love to see that happening to someone. This shit aint even funny

PLEASE do! That's the whole point of me posting it!
---
The unranked challenge is not tracking properly. I just won a game and i'm still at 0/3. Anyone else?

Or when people die and then just leave. That's very annoying.

I would have shat myself

---
Am I the only one who can never get into a game on Unranked?
---
It is not real unfortunately. At least Europol(see tweet) is saying it's a hoax, can't really argue with them. There are some mistakes in the text (warrant issued by microsoft etc).
---
Don‚Äôt think you can get DDosD by Ubi I‚Äôm not sure they would compromise there own server...

I have also been kinda burnt out of rainbow and it would give me more of a reason to play

Operators don't go on sale, but their pries do drop on the 1 year anniversary of their release. So when Ember Rise started the Y1S3, Y2S3, and Y3S3 operators got a price drop.

Of course not, software of that caliber can be used by companies or hired individuals for work purposes. Even then, it‚Äôs software, you can‚Äôt make software illegal, as it‚Äôll be hard to track people getting it.

"A warrant issued by microsoft" I thought warrants were a police thing?

I was worse when I got started.

I actually had this idea for a hard breacher lol. Freezes a window-sized section of reinforced wall and turns it soft
---
This isnt really a self promotion sub.
---
All I know with Polish Ops is, nerf, nerf, then nerf, and then nerf.
---
I personally think they should have made it so if the hostage is moved from its starting point then whoever shoots the shield gets credit for the kill, but before the hostage is moved Goyo gets credit. This way goyo has to be more careful with where he places his shield, and attackers can't just put the hostage in front of a shield and shoot. Idk how hard/easy that would be to implement, but that's how I feel it should work
---
Smh

Not the only spot on the new kanal that has you clip through walls.

They do, but the fact that "it is a federal crime" is irrelevant outside the US, yet people here say that line way too much.

When you are attacking, they ddos the ubi server so you can‚Äôt get kills or plant.

I know

So I'm curious who's actually going down for this, the guys who provide a service or the customers, and what about guys who know how to program their own packet sender thing (PhD in information technology btw)

That's not how a claim works.

//Distributed Denial of Service Attacks are illegal under California and Federal law. You can be fined or punished with jail time (Pen C 502). The relevant part of Pen C 502 says it is a crime to "Knowingly and without permission disrupts or causes the disruption of computer services or denies or causes the denial of computer services to an authorized user of a computer, computer system, or computer network."

The Penal Code also goes on to say that a violation of the above section is punishable "by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for 16 months, or two or three years, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment."//

Not the absolute fastest, but Unranked can amass a large amount of renown fairly casually if you win at least half of your games.

Plus, it isn‚Äôt brain dead like other renown farm methods.

Oh yeah, it's all coming together

Like with all the uplay club challenges, they might not register immediately. If you haven't got it, either restart your game, or restart uplay and you should receive it.

Thank god for the removal of increasing leaving I don‚Äôt wanna be playing and be basically banned because some ones raging also sometimes life requires leaving
---
Slap a Sledge sticker on your car and proceed to fucking T-bone them
---
It's probably going to be a mid-season thing.
---
You're not aware of the "ash main" stereotype? It's like Genji in overwatch or wraith in Apex legends. (If you play either of those)
---
damn. what gun?
---
Monty Elite when
---
Np bb
---
Didn‚Äôt come out of his head
---
Nice thx for the source!
---
The one thing this game needs is fucking INCREMENTAL patches. Not having to redownload 50 fucking GB every patch would be... honestly what I would expect from a AAA game.
---
Except that EA doesnt even have rights bit still puts guns in game with their full real names.
---
You cant deduce that "it exists, so that's what happening" 
---
Thats like seeing the ground is wet on a cloudy day but not seeing the firetruck putting out a fire right next to you. 
---
If EA, a bigger company than Ubisoft, can do it and get away with it, Ubi should be able to as well.
---
Thanks man. Hope you get better luck soon enough too.
---
Buy all of them
---
At the ripe age of 11üò≠üòÇ
---
Did they say anything specific about it being temporary?
---
Sledge hands down.
---
I can understand this being implemented for Goyo's case (so that there would be no griefing), but hey, if you shoot Capitao's fire bolt and kill the hostage you pretty much deserve to lose
---
Not the first time, no.
---
My first ace was with buck in the situation on house. Rip house, plane, and tower until they get rotated in.
---
CoD with leaning\*
---
Get whichever one you want, it's your money. I personally would get Sledge since I don't play Glaz all that often but the choice is ultimately yours.
---
Well you are kinda gay
---
I feel for you guys.  At least on PC we can blame ubisoft you guys are fighting players.  :(
---
The only issue we had that seems mostly fixed was the infinite load time glitch people would do to win ranked (40 minutes plus of load time)
---
why ash is handling a lmg?
---
Shame that they haven't done anything serious like this about closet wallhackers or aimbotter who toggle cheats on at match point.
---
why take the picture so slanted
---
Uh, that‚Äôs not how it works at all. Learn the range of the shotguns and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Only one or two are genuinely trash, the rest are at least salvageable or even decent.
---
Not a buyable defense anymore
---
The blood was from his shoulder. The recoil brought your aim up and to the left of his head. You could have gotten lucky when you over corrected your aim to the right of his head, but you didn't.
---
um mods now that this has been proven fake, can we have a stickied comment describing it? u/jeypiti u/LordKeren ?
---
This game is rampant with DDOSers this season.
---
That would be good
---
But glaz mvp is amazing
---
At least your not a pussy that ddos‚Äô
---
I even said they'd probably make a few scapegoats out of some people, but thinking they're going to prosecute a bunch of people is ridiculous. I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here.
---
I think the reason I like chimera is because it was the first operation technically that I was in.
---
keep crying bud you're clearly console gold lol
---
When the entire enemy team is a bunch of floor lickers that thirst for the final kill. Good ole casual
---
Honestly just get whoever's you play more.
---
I wouldn't get either (I don't play those Operators) but I prefer Glaz' elite.
---
No art credit.
---
Are should not. Wise words
---
What actually happens if you all pile up on one C4 and then make it go boom?
---
Fair Trade‚Ñ¢
---
Always is. Some 14 15 year old kid ddosing cuz he read it helps him not lose online. Communities service is all they‚Äôll get if anything. No judge in their right mind would give that kid a felony charge.

Go to the home page of the sub, click the 3 dots, click ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù

I play sledge and rarely Glaz. So I say sledge.
---
Don't ask questions you dont want the answer to ;)
---
I didn't get one when spinning the wheel and I didn't have any left. I also got it after cashing in the challenge.
---
Fix your grammar and I'm in
---
A what are rff again? B r/engrish
---
Entertainment is misspelled also
---
I only really soloQ so I feel
---
I play sledge more but I'll play glaz if I get the skin.
---
Very cute work
---
Yep
---
Can someone explain to me real quick what all of this is about? I've just bought the game, barely played it yet
---
It will just turn up in your inventory. You don't spin for it. Try restarting Uplay if it still isn't showing up.
---
*TRYHARD*
---
Yeah shield ops are kinda pointless now
---
Try do this on PC.
---
Which is why companies like Ubi need to take better measures in terms of tracking people. Add a "Prime" option where people need to link real phone numbers to their accounts. Sure, someone can steal a hacked account, but the victim can always report it in such cases.
---
Until gaming companies start taking cheats more seriously, we can't punish them properly.
---
I think it should give you the option to votekick someone only if they tried to teamkill or damaged multiple of the teams gadgets.  It shouldn't be an option at the beginning of the match at all
---
I used to love playing as blitz, but after all the bugs I experienced, dying after being shot or knifed on the shield, I had to stop using him
---
Finally
---
Since when is Microsoft issuing *warrants?*
---
6‚Äô4*
---
It‚Äôll get you to be president though
---
This has been posted before stop being a hypocrite
---

---
Imagine legally it's easier to prosecute the providers versus the buyers.
---
Yeah but mute hammers interfere so hard counter /s
---
Are u banned?
---
"At 14 years old, you know everything"
---
It makes sense when you consider one thing: corruption. 
---
The officials are paid by the providers to look away when they make the most expensive and slowest flatrates in the entire world.
---
f-2 :(
---
People were doing this shit in mortal kombat 11 too, you‚Äôre not even penalized for losing in the MMR system that it has, in fact you still get points for it.
---
I mean, there is an archived version of it that does look like an actual ddos service here
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20190408014720/https://r6s.support/
---
Edit: nevermind
---
I guess the code would be confusing with symmetrical guidelines for fire. The code would be like hmm this is goyo's fire ok. So defense loses, but oh wait let me confuse my logic by how did the hostage reach in this fire. Oh attacking team loses. I am not a coder but I am guessing the logic fallacies would be there.
---
Horrible analogy, it's more like hitting a newborn rather than an adult. Hospitals are way more important than a game.
---
What did you get in your pack?
---
console lul.
---
Go look at europols tweet
---
Imagine being so insecure that you have to commit a crime to win fake internet points.
---
Yes I tried all afternoon and played like 8 unranked matches where the enemies where god tier and my teammates did not even know what's a camera
---
So it wasn't that fun
---
Haven't won a single game
---
how long do these challenges last?
---
newbie here and ill probably play tomorrow or the day after. dont want it to end today :(
---
Ahhh then you must need mechanical keyboards!
---
She sees tachanka and blackbeard in full air cute one gear coming and she's like "aight imma head out" and quits rainbow.
---
I really couldn't believe so many people believed it, I can kinda understand how I guess. However I think the most obvious part is the second to last sentence where it just says "effort Ubisoft... , in cooperation with Microsoft." instead of "effort by Ubisoft...". Also the capitalisation of "the", i.e. "The Netherlands" but it has "the United States of America".
---
Oh damn 
---
IQ
---
Never played siege on pc
---
It would be an interesting addition to the free BP, but the paid one has to have more than just alpha packs.
---
Ddossers are shitting themselves right now ü§°ü§°
---
It's already treated as casual 2.0
---
You'd know that if you played at least 1 match in it
---
417 is dope this season
---
cool man
---
implying plat is hard to get, it's easy as even on pc.
---
but cool!
---
I think votes by a member in a squad should count as 1 and only 1.  How often is a squad going to vote differently?  They have too much voting power.
---
I'm so sorry for your post getting stolen :( people are so gullible for liking reposts on this sub.
---
WHAT YOURE LUCKY
---
I mean, you still have a legendary skin right?
---
She looks like she went undercover with Bandit.
---
Yeah I realized after I wrote the comment, hence the edit
---
I really like what Ubisoft has managed to do with RFF. All games with TK should really look at it as example.
---
Basically, if you‚Äôre going to be a little bitch and quit every game, don‚Äôt play unranked. Had a dude the other day complain and want to surrender because he didn‚Äôt feel like playing anymore. If you‚Äôre going to play unranked, treat it like ranked, simple.
---
Theres also something known as droning ahead
---
Bruh, I only play unranked.
---
Is there any ddosers here? who want to tell me why you‚Äôre such a pussy?
---
It's all fun and games tell someone has to pay compensation.
---
i'd cry too if I died to a j√§ger ADS
---
Oh dear god

Yes.

Why were they all at one window??

Only time I actually want commons

Imagine being so bad at a game you have to commit a federal crime to win.

Hey you can‚Äòt say that! We have the best officials money can buy!

why did they even give him frags? did they expect that to magically boost his pick and win rate?

Ight! Boutta head in!
---
The people using the sites to DDoS dont get legally charged, the sites they use get a cease and desist and get taken down.
---
Thanks I appreciate it
---
No hard feelings here anyway bro, just banter, all part of siege being a little bit toxic here and there. 
---
As long as we play by the rules in game and we‚Äôre not being hella racist/homophobic we can trash each other over a competitive game all we want. 
---
After all we are luckier than most who don‚Äôt get to play this great game.
---
*Mute walks in* DID SOMEONE SAY DUCK TAPE
---
&gt;At 14 years old, you know everything.
---
The law just simply doesn't work that way. Their assumpion is that you know absolutely nothing until you are 18. Of course in reality both are completely batshit crazy assumptions.
---
Filthy
---
Also known as Ash gameplay
---
He doesn‚Äôt shield himself, he just dabs on you
---
One: controller is hard enough. You want some poor sap with Joy cons to do the same?
---
Two: Frame Rate and performance would be bad in MP and hell on T-Hunt
---
Three: Ubisoft is already dealing with enough problem, especially DDOS. We don‚Äôt want them to just fuck off
---
Four: Another console to babysit with up to date update fixes and future problems. 
---
Five(?): they probably don‚Äôt have enough experience on the switch for it to warrant a switch release. They could release it but if they did, the bugs and issues would be even worse than what PC, Xbox and PS have, not to mention switch only problems.
---
TLDR: Controlling Siege with joycon is hell, more issues, problems arises with same issues as current plus any possible switch only issues.
---
I was thinking this last night
---
Now I want a switch skin for the cell.
---
Not all heroes wear capes. 
---
I sleep
---
I'm pretty damn sure the majority of people ddosing are doing it to boost up accounts then sell them or just boost others in general.
---
Were there any pitfalls with that method? The one where whoever shoots it is responsible?
---
ok
---
Well yeah, ddosing is a federal crime.
---
How much time remaining?
---
It's sadly fake:
---
https://twitter.com/Europol/status/1174691639673196544?s=09
---
I TK my friends when their AFK so they don't get kicked and i even exclaim that to the one random in the team and he still TK's me. So we go toxic and TK him every round until we can't. Yes it's toxic but when I tell you whats happening and you still TK for it then you suck
---
Goyo players were using it as bait to get the attacking team to kill the hostage. But that really just forces attackers to play a bit more carefully in order to not kill the hostage. Nomad even seemed to be a pretty decent counter against it.
---
Probably ddosed
---
But it would provide something more worthwhile than saving time on outside rotations. Honestly, if they never intended those things to happen, the idea of a grappeling hook op seems pretty useless. 
---
Apparently they even playtested it with more indoor interactions and said it merely ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt feel like rainbow‚Äô. Not that it was overpowered. And im led to believe it was more for fear of backlash they removed it, instead of for balance. I rather doubt it would be overpowered. Merely strong in some situations.
---
Ops will never be balanced around hostage. This is just a bandaid fix so the game mode isn't completely broken
---
Yes I am because that's what that was it's just unlucky that he was there at the wrong place at the wrong time
---
Okay I see. Yeah I personally like the sound of that as well.
---
Thicc daddy always wins
---
Imagen getting a duplicate black ice that‚Äôs what I got
---
I guess that‚Äôs why hostage isn‚Äôt on ranked
---
Scum
---
Wtf, what laptop is he playing on?
---
Nice
---
Not really unless you manage to buy everything available with rainbow bucks. At which point you can use it buy alpha packs.
---
They‚Äôre in armory on Clubhouse too. I mourn there daily.
---
It‚Äôs a shitty laptop that can barely run the game lmao
---
Check that head of hair out. My little mans growing up
---
Nope. Not DDoSed. We just crash randomly for no apparent reason other than some bug. It's usually one person per round maybe 2 if were unlucky but it's 100% not DDoS and I'll put money in it lmao
---

---
Zarya main, can confirm nano boost at Max charge does over 250 dps
---
No one plays Newcomer.
---
Cant wait for an another black ice pistol
---
3 downvotes lmao i just dont like cav
---
I don't know what you're talking about. This isn't a schoolyard tally-up of attackers vs defenders, it's about mechanical consistency. Don't lie to your players.
---
There is no reason to tell the player they have time left to win the round when they are incapable of doing so. Literally all they would have to do to maintain identical behavior to now is to shorten the timer by 7 seconds and then give defenders the grace period. Same functional behavior but no obfuscation.
---
Stressing the server can make some people leave. It‚Äôs like a smaller ddos where not everyone is kicked.
---
Ummm they do that all the time. Hell the new season was like 6 GB‚Äôs at most.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs happening to me too on PS4
---
if it aint elo, it aint worth it
---
Ya I was about to hit plat at the beginning of the season and now I‚Äôve managed to get lvl 30s to 60s and I am doing everything on my own
---
AVE CESEAR
---
Literally happening to me right now lol
---
Same here but bugisoft is a small indie developer... they can't possibly test their shit before realeasing
---
Thanks for the info.
---
So its not just me
---
yeah I know, I'm saying that happens regularly. it always eventually counts them though, sometimes it takes a couple days
---
Kill trades are one thing. But if my brain registers the kill before I get hit, then it's BS.
---
The worst is when you're fighting someone, recognize them as being behind cover, and then die unable to even have returned fire.
---
Hello Rrikster, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d6iv8p/cheeky_kafe_angle_ez_kill_rainbow_six_siege/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Just asked two of my friends and it‚Äôs the same with them too.
---
Dude does that not hurt his eyes or some shit?
---
You two should party up.
---
Because Nook isn't powerful because they obviously don't want another lion or ela, you answered your question right there.
---
Comparing her to vigil is also just stupid. One is a defender, one is an attacker, one's ability reduces noise in addition to hiding from cameras. I think if she got a neutered AR without an acog she'd be fine but I don't want an op that can silently and secretly appear on site with an acog within 20 seconds of the round starting.
---
Seems like the new contract is broken for PS4 then
---
No he cannot. Hostage is allergic to smoke canisters.
---
The SMG-11 is actually strong but I agree with the PDW9 it's on the weaker side, However since we're getting reused guns likely each season I wanna see the PDW9 on a new attacker.
---
And who is worse than him in your opinion?
---
Is the red dot good or bad? I‚Äôm still an amateur at this game so I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs meta and what‚Äôs not
---
Why yes, being bad
---
I bought this one also, instead of the seasonal ones (I did not like the current ones)
---
I feel like this could be abused though (this might rarely ever happen). I just feel like if someone on your squad accidentally kill someone and they don‚Äôt deactivate it so you all get rff and then you can‚Äôt screw up
---
Can't wait for my dupe black ice for the fourth time in a row
---
I hate this with shields too... My shield is fully up but they still headshot me
---
People still play secure?
---
finally ubi understands how to make people play there new shit, if only it gave you an epic blackice themed charm if u submitted and got a high number of bug reports acknowledged in the tts
---
Yep, and the new game will be canon as well
---
Hell yes
---
Dang me too. I‚Äôll try to add mine and see if I get the same problem
---
I mean, just google special operation units from around the world and you'll see a ton of different uniforms and set ups and looks based on what their mission is and where they're from. Most special purpose operators actually don't just wear jet black uniforms and big, bulky vests. So as far as realism goes, I think they actually got more accurate by adding in different looking operators.
---
But I totally get your point, looking back at older Rainbow 6 games, most characters were decked out in black with vests and helmets and boots, etc.
---
This is pretty hot. No pun intended
---
There was an update?
---
I mean it really doesnt matter lul but it can forsure look better than it does rn.
---
I can agree with that it‚Äôs cement

10/10 will reee again

The first fuck face that goes to prison all to gain ELO is gonna be absolutely worth all the times me and my squad have been DDos‚Äôed!!

Its got good clips, and a good concept but somewhat lacking in edits, unless your style is less editing and more content. Good transition but slightly overused. Great video overall!
---
Where's my beautiful pirate face though
---
And Nokk would just be [REDACTED]
---
that is just not english but what i assume you're saying is that crosshair placement isn't the first thing you think of but that just shows that you are a silver level player. the first thing any high level player thinks of before entering a room is where people would be and therefore where to aim to hit their heads. play thunt and you'll know where to aim
---
i can, but theyre like mosquitos. Fucking annoying. Using shields unironically is kinda sad. It just shows how little skill a person needs. A new player would be able to play a shield op and win.
---
Exactly and its been a problem since day 1 of Cavs release. Ultimately at best its poor sportsmanship and thus. in my opinion toxic behavior and should then be subject to the ban that follows toxic behavior or at worse is Exploitive of the game and essentially cheating so should be banned according to ubis policy on cheating and exploits.
---
Hipfire mostly hits toward the edges of the crosshair
---
So you'll wanna bias your aim to one side to have a higher chance of hitting
---
THIS HAPPENED TO ME AND I WAS LIKE
---
*stranger things intensifies*
---
Both,perhaps
---
make sure everything is linked up. if it is then contact ubisoft support

Put on a lion sticker and say they shouldn‚Äôt have been roming

Ahh yes, another zofia
---
It‚Äôs like the sound is flipped in some way? I hear people rappelling on buildings across the map but can‚Äôt hear my own teammate reinforcing next to me. Weird asf
---
Make sure your Uplay is linked to your twitch and you claim the skins on twitch. I don‚Äôt think you can get the Ash one now
---
appreciate the feedback bro &lt;3 I‚Äôll keep it in mind
---
Good
---
Clash is hit or miss I think as there‚Äôs good clash and bad ones however she is rarely ever picked so that‚Äôs something. Nonetheless cav and Echo are the main ones on console it seems, few times have I‚Äôve seen others banned unless you have a really good team that knows what the pros do which on console doesn‚Äôt really happen much.
---
If it's truly an accident, the person who was killed can forgive you and there is zero punishment
---
In all my time playing siege, I'd say that its safe to say that out of 10 matches, 2/10 would have a shield op. It takes much more skill to use a shield op and is actually more challenging, making it more fun. But go off, sit in your corner with your deployable shields I guess lol
---
I‚Äôm hoping ur new, but Buck is the guy with Skeleton Key, the shotgun attachment. Blackbeard is the guy with the Rifle Shields
---
Imagine this: 
---
You find sausage 
---
You place fuze charge with no regrets 
---
‚ÄúCluster Charge live‚Äù
---
The enemy team dies from big explosion 
---
Then in big beautiful words ‚ÄúTeam Won‚Äù instead of 30 minute ban
---
My lord its been like a week and you still can't adjust
---
He's definitely not OP, just very useful
---
Clash in my experience gets banned for the same reason as Cav, it helps prevent mishaps in lower ranked games
---
100% now.
---
Armour pearcing rifle bullets eh? Lol
---
It is a pistol caliber round. Plain and simple. Not armour piercing, not rifle bullets. Just pistol caliber rounds.
---
What? Y3 season pass skin was Damascus steel? It doesn‚Äôt even look similar.
---
big. It again, it works. I get that shit all the time
---
Can we just get pulse standing there with his camera hahaha
---
i thought you meant Nokk is fine i misunderstood that, But no Amaru is fine but there are complaints she's underwhelming yet the community kept asking for a grapple hook attacker since 2016.
---
Nokk is just trash
---
that's the point, they nerfed them. you can't ask to buff them right after
---
I am the lion in the clip my Xbox name is Ez3 Thor  you can message me for proof
---
Well i have yet to see a pro player use a shield op. Maybe because its a cheesy way to play and because they want an actual challenge instead of taking bullets like a chump? Idk, but i guess you can go around and rush with a shielr however thats possible lmfaooo
---
Yeah i have no idea why they would do it the renown doesn‚Äôt seem worth it
---
Pmm &gt; gsh
---
This happens with literally every placeable gadget (jager, mute, kaid, ela, nomad,fuze, breaching charge, claymore, thermite charge, valk cam, etc. ) Kapkan and frost are the only two exceptions
---
There absolutely isn‚Äôt a law against that. What
---
Looks stoned af
---
Last season that didn‚Äôt break the game was op Health, bc they didn‚Äôt add anything. From then it feels like getting worse every season.  
---
Gridlock runs at me from behind, making no steps, while I can hear Cav in silent step all across the map. Breaches not making sounds, barricades not breaking properly, Bandit tricking is pure luck right now.
---
Black ice dupe for the p9 lets go
---
I've seen plenty of people use shield ops in higher ranks but alright lol. Its more challenging to use a shield op. I can tell you that for sure as a Bandit/Blitz main. I see tons of cavs, and lesions but I don't complain.
---
2nd best season behind Parabellum imo
---
(Tower in Ranked aside lol)
---
Why have chat at all. Use comms for R6.
---
Doubt it. No way they made one gun for the season before testing if it was OP, then removed it. She was always going to have a recycled gun. The AR she had was likely already in the game. Not a Galil.

Dude I‚Äôve been ddosed so much I‚Äôve gotten  a penalty for 2 hours. They don‚Äôt care

Totally agree! Early day Vigil was the best Vigil. Tower though....ü§¢
---
Actual Mira strats in biohazard. Cool to see
---
What audio setting are you using in game?
---
You didn‚Äôt knife a single person, you punched them
---
Hi-Fi
---
You cant compare cav and lesion to a measley shield up but ok.  Also higher rank shield players are just sad, even i can get a high rank just by playing shields
---
The player doesn't have to be the best Mira player, they simply gotta commit to being an anchor early game.
---
Ok

I was a monty main. I would rather have the ads animation of the reveal trailer than having to carry a pistol that weighs 50 pounds.
---
isnt nuke the reason they did that lmfao
---
I think this only applies for squads TKing non squad members. But this isn't explicitly said anywhere so I might be wrong
---
win
---
I hope this makes it to hot, the caption alone was enough to make me laugh.
---
If it's casual I don't really care but people are such fucking tryhards that will leave in ranked, that's denying the operators ability because you make silly stupid mistakes
---
Plat on xbox - havent had hit reg issues in forever either. If anything, youre having latency issues. Talk to your ISP, or get a wired connection (if not already)/better connection. Or check and make sure youre on the correct servers.

Ok that‚Äôs fine, it works but is that ok though? Ngl I‚Äôm not happy with it and neither was the rest of my group since there is a huge skill gap between silver 1 and plat 3.
---
Glad to see both teams banned the most infuriating Op, NoBan
---
I have no idea what you're talking about. I dont get your reply.  
---
Or maybe you're understanding of my lame attempt at humor is lacking. That's alright though, I still think your pretty cool.

Why tf does that down people

They built a defuser that can withstand gunshots and c4 yet they couldn't make the thing work just a few meters below the bomb.
---
damn... double fail , god damn!

I see a heart with a crack in it

if you actually believe getting interrogated makes you thrash, worthless and makes it okay to leave a game you should not play multiplayer games until you get some tiltproof on.

Internet doesn't belong to US of A. if other countries seize domain it get different screens.

So why can‚Äôt you just pick up the defuser and rub as a defender rather than defusing it

---
Nope don‚Äôt fucking post this , it was been posted 100 times already
---
He said Bullet Proof, so shock and Impacts would work as well
---
Please explain how this is nonsensical.

I literally just gave you a situation. If you need wall hacks to play this game, it's not the game for you.

Yes, here!
---
Strange. Must have just been crappy connection or a lapse in connection is my best bet
---
Square up boi
---
Right. I am not advocating for the removal of rewards. What I'm saying is, there are better, healthier ways to reward people for playing than based on MMR. 
---
Used to be that cosmetics, which could be earned by investing time and/or completing challenges filled that role, but every publisher is hell-bent on selling/gambling those nowadays.
---
Getting better an increasing your MMR is something that should very much be it's own reward. Or, to put it another way, your primary reward for winning at ranked is to face more interesting challenges going forward. People who aren't interested in that shouldn't be pushed into playing the mode, because they'll just have a bad time and ruin it for others.
---
BABY! its a triple!
---
the only legendary I have is a banana charm.

thanks for a challenge i can never complete

Yeesh

No way

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you ‚Äúworked hard for the ops‚Äù they‚Äôre a pain in the ass and people don‚Äôt want to deal with them

Look at any template ever and it will say that all the compensator does is make the reticle smaller.

Yeah i thought so xd i couldve sworn ive seen this a couple times but ive seen so many caveira ones too i cant even keep track
---
ping it then they know what to do
---
Fairly sure he used the alibi to bait out the enemy, I've done it before
---
I think we all have comrade
---
Yeah we get very little for getting beat by one, we usually lose 50 for losing and because they were cheating we get 20 back, but when you beat a cheater you lose 50 mmr
---
I don't get tilt playing seige. I do that out of consideration to the people in random. I'll Alt-F4 against a Cav for the same reason I don't spawn peek, even if that logic is a little off.
---
Alright
---
Nah it works just fine. You just place the GU mine about a foot behind the welcome mat and you're good.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
If someone leaves, they should just leave a ‚Äúbot‚Äù to stay idle in the DBNO stage. If the quitter (somehow) enters back before anything happens to him he joins back where the bot is left off. Or if the devs want to be harsher, make the player join next round. If the bot gets recovered, it instantly dies. 
---
The ‚Äúbot‚Äù just needs to sit idle, waiting for the bleedout time to go down. It shouldn‚Äôt do anything else. 
---
This allows cav to interrogate a body, while allowing the rest of the offense to revive their teammate to prevent the cav interrogation.
---
What seems to be the issue?
---
oh, shits gettin hella real
